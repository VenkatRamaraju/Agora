"Pltr is a great company, but the market is not in a good state right now"
"Honest question: What do you guys think of the CEO? I'm very interested in the company and thinking of buying in tomorrow, but the CEO gives me some hesitation. Don't get me wrong, I do like him, but I feel he's too outspoken and political that, undoubtedly, he will burn a lot of bridges with potential customers. I feel he needs to bring it down a notch. What do you guys think?"
This is going up hill
like this comment and comment one company pltr is working with or has a contract with.
waiting for$ 23
This happened with draftkings also . The lockup expired and the stock went down and sideways for a season then bounced back .Lockup is over and that’s a great thing.
"Nobody knows how the end of the lockup period is going to play out. It could go higher or it could go lower. In many cases there usually is a decline, but not necessarily right away. Could happen slowly over several months. ￼ ￼Insiders were able to to sell 20% of their holdings when Palantir began trading as an IPO. When lockup period expires, Insiders will then have the option to unload the other 80% of their holdings if they wish, adding more supply of stock to the public. There will be some insider selling for sure, but I suspect most Insiders believe this is a great long-term play and will hold onto most of their shares."
If it breaks 25. Watch out below

"Bought 2,000 and sold 20 call option contracts April 16 $31 strike price for $1.03. Plan is to sell OTM calls for $1 a share every month until I pay for the shares, or for the shares to get purchased at the OTM strike price. Either way I'll be happy. Hopefully, the stock won't crash, which I don't think it will due to the cult following of Peter Thiel. Also that the young robin hooders and reddit crowd will continue to pay large premiums for the call contracts."
"That was one of the most confident, bullish reports I've ever heard. It's a software that saves clients millions and is unlike anything else out there. As Alex said, they expect to be one of the biggest, most important software companies in the world."

"So, since Cathie Wood ARK Invest portfolios have PLTR as one of their stocks, I did some research and it seems that:1. Cathie wood holds some 11 million PLTR stocks2. It seems that she bought in chunks at (approximate numbers):$21 = 0.5 million$23 = 2.5 million$24 = 2.7 million$25 = 6.0 million$28 = 1.6 million3. In other words, Cathie Wood bought at an average price of about $244. Is this a fair estimation of her average price?Peace!"

"In my view, 3M’s expansion of their contract w/Palantir, to the entirety of their (millions of) line items and huge data set, is serious evidence that Palantir brings value to a profit oriented company. But then, I’ve got several thousand shares, at a loss, so what do I know?"

The way this stock recovers is phenomenal
Short it as you please. I will hold it strong. Long term winner baby.
Added 5000 more shares. Love these dips.
I’m actually going to buy more!
"Too many people gambling on options rather than buying shares and investing is where we are right now. It is becoming a problem. Regardless, I am very invested in Palantir and have no intentions to sell for many years. This company will change the world for the better."
Worth noting that most of the sell off today could have been from soros dumping their shares. They said they were going to do to ethical concerns. They’ve been an investor since 2012. Seems like it’s held pretty well around the 25 range. If it goes green tomorrow this might be the bottom.
"My girlfriend said, Me or Palantir?I miss her.....$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Told my father to buy the stock. And he did. hehe

Come on. This is stock market. Of cause there is ups and downs. But believe in the long term portfolio of pltr. They are winning contracts and they have huge investors investing on them. What makes you think this won't go to 50 soon? This company is a gem. One of a kind.
Oh nooooooo! It's the yield. And I don't mean dividend! Run Forrest run! So I just started my first small purchase of Palantir.
Ouch 10 yr Treasury is bumping up against 1.50%. At one point it even went up above the S&P 500’s yield. The pace of rate increases is shocking. I expect people to be taking profits as this continues to occur as stocks valuations will be coming in.
So pullback day is over today. Back to $25 plus Monday
she really gets going now
Red but it will probably hit 40$ this year.
Over $40 On Thursday !!!

I like the company but is going to be a long journey. holding for few years.
bought more today to bring average down to 26.
They have to make our options even more expensive so these weekly games attract investors that seek insurance and not these abusive gamblers.
"Now that woods have some share. will this go up like ROKU, Square, FiVER.."

"This is the dirtiest battle on Call holders I have seen. They want to sweep the board clean before the next push higher. Not just Palantir options, on the whole tech market."
i bought this at 25.77. rode it all the way up to $30 and rode it all the way down to 20. There is Nothing happening in palantirs horizon. will follow nasdaq sentiment so im assuming this is all algorithmic trading at the moment.
I run out if money yesterday I couldn’t buy any more  come on PLTR
"LOL, I love how people on this board are telling others to BUY NOW! Even if everyone on this thread bought in, it would not budge the price. Same things with shorts telling people to sell. Even if everyone here did, it will not do anything to the price. Relax."
"I’m confused, people are actually selling?"
"Unlike others in the forum, I have no predictive abilities.After hundreds of pages that I read, studied and researched,I am convinced:After 17 years of development, the company has flexible, multi-industry products and a team of groundbreaking executives with a unique vision.The contracts that are being published these days have probably been in the pipeline for several months.Now ready for signing and publishing. Think, how many contracts are in the negotiation phase ....For me it's time to keep loading.There will come a day when faith will pay off."
I am now overweight PLTR and looking forward to tomorrow. I think markets will finish strong this week. Get out of cash. My $MS $GS $JPM $BAC looking good too. Buying banks at the bottom of the curve is prudent. Five year holds on all mentioned.
"I have one word for you bears.Cathy Wood. Sorry, that was two words, but you get the gist."
i hope it stys at this price so i can buy more for months. but it wont. ill just buy while it goes up the next 3 years then ride it until 10 years
If you need money now get a job. If you want money tomorrow invest.

"Motley Fool article on why Palantir is a buy:“I've been cautiously watching Palantir from the sidelines since its IPO, and I missed the big jump last year when shares went from sub-$10 to briefly over $40. Since then, the stock has been reduced to a much more modest valuation and the price is down some 40% from its peak. And after seeing the Q4 update -- the first for Palantir as a public company -- I'm ready to start (still very cautiously) dipping a toe in the water. My caution stems from the well-documented fact that the bulk of Palantir's business is derived from government contracts. There's also a lot of new stock being doled out as employee compensation that could throttle growth of a stake in the company. But Palantir expects its sales to grow an average of 30% a year through 2025 as data analytics demand picks up steam. Palantir has also made changes to speed up the rollout of its software for commercial companies, and it's posted some early successes on this front. Plus, Palantir is highly profitable (on an adjusted basis that backs out non-cash items like employee stock-based compensation, operating profit margin was 32% in Q4). The company also has loads of cash: $2.01 billion at the end of 2020, offset by debt of only $198 million. For a high-growth software technologist in a fast-growing industry, that kind of liquidity paired with a profitable operation is powerful. Granted, even after the recent taming of the stock price, Palantir trades for 32 times expected 2021 revenue (assuming the company grows sales by ""only"" 30%, although management said to expect ""30% or more"" growth). It's still a costly price tag, but not terribly unreasonable if the company does in fact deliver on its five-year plan. Thus, I'm ready to start nibbling a little here.“"
Sell off was brutal but I am still up over 65 percent. This is a long term play for my bull thesis to play out.
"Questions, what caused PLTR NEGATIVE EARNINGS to blossom to almost 1 billion. There will be more growing pains as I see it as they ramp up. I love pltr. But why buy it if it will forever be in a hole. Are the expenses one timers or forever on the books? The institutions are 6 months ahead in their views so 6 months from now were still in the 20’s. The pop to 30 was irrational unfortunately. Or the love of the stock to the likes or kathi wood could just propel this company but that’s a paper tissue narrative. It’s a tough call. What it her motive for buying. Will earnings be positive in a year ? A billion with of deals won’t be signed. IBM cooperation could be a positive because pltr sale expenses could hold steady as they piggy back on the few thousand sales staff at ibm facilitates contracts lowering the cost of client acquisition? I don’t know no ones discussed this who have better knowledge than I"
"I believe Cathie Wood recently purchased somewhere around 6.8 million shares. Pretty sure we're all going to he just fine. It was probably heading to 23 last Friday with the lockup expiration and her purchase news turned the price around a bit. This is a growth play not Value play, so quit squaking about the fundamentals."
"I’m ready for this thing to run to the 30s by end of month! To all you bears out there, don’t be surprised when it does. "
I’m long and don’t care if it falls to $10. Will just buy a ton more. Long term I’m not concerned one iota about the stock. Getting excited about all the cheaper shares I may be buying. Goes up I win. Goes down I win. That’s how I view this stock.
"Words of wisdom: If you have to choose between dumping your girlfriend or dumping PLTR stock, dump your gf."
I'm long and will remain long . But if this News is so great why is it fading into it ???
Let's get a good laugh
"1. Lock up is done2. Citron bs has passed3. Earnings report panic is overThe long-term steady growth continues. Embrace the volatility and focus on the long-term trajectory and you’ll sleep a lot better at night .I’ve watched multiple “selloffs” since I got in below $10 and it always ends the same way: those who sold impatiently regret it .Check the comments, been saying this consistently every time I’ve posted here .Weak hands lose out 9/10 times. Patience is a virtue but it’s everything in this stock market."
As usual. Red on premarket. EOD rocket.
"Rest assured this will reverse to back to the high side soon and move up to $34 before it takes another small hit. This is very clear on the graph. Keep in mind the 1st quarter will end in 30 days, and already PLTR said the revenue will grow by 40%, and I am sure this was a conservative estimate. I expect this to continue climbing up until Q1 announcement."
This could be a nice buy the dip entry point..whay you think!!
time to release pltr from its cage. i checked the same dates that gme went up last time. pltr went from 25 to 40 in same time 3 day period.
"PLTR tip of the day:If we cross $24 past Noon Eastern Time Zone, we may end the day at $25...However, the computerized trades using the power of PATS = ""Python Automatic Trading Scripts"":1. Must wake up at 11:30am2. Analyze the trades from 9:30am to 11:30am3. Adjust their AI = Artificial Intelligence input parameters4. Update the PLTR target price between 11:30am to 2pm5. Typically, the AI automated trades are fired to put pressure on the PLTR price in order to keep the $22 to $23 target price range6. HOWEVER, if you have OUTSIDE and UNPREDICTABLE behavior, such as REDDIT and WallStreetBets people messing around with the usual ""Institutional Pros AI algorithms"", then the AI based trades will go CRAZY and the price will go up in a very unpredictable manner7. When you are trading, you must try to OUTSMART both the weak hands and the Computerized AI Algorithms8. Now you know!!!Peace!"

It's hilarious how undervalued this company is. The societal shifts that'll occur in the 20s are going to break the brains of these myopic Wall Street analysts.
"Well, the stock is up because CPI was slightly lower than expected driving the 10Y Treasury yield down. Why was CPI low? Shelter inflation was at a 10 year low in February. Must be a housing crash going on lol"

$33+ at 9:30
Here we go! Bye shorts
I want to hold a position on this but after days of studying it I still don’t feel confident in it. I understand their revenue is going ok each year but the debt they have is horrible

There we goooo! I bought this morning more
"Guys...This price reduction has nothing to do with company's performance. Market in general has been weak for last few days. yes, insider selling has affected PLTR more than others but it is part and parcel of this business.Rest assured, it will start climbing upwards soon.Patience is the key .Remember this is Long hold company."
"i get in today , so far so good , 100% PLTR great company !shure 50 usd stock in the near future."
I have a feeling that tomorrow this stock is going very green.
Great buying opportunity at these levels!

"How much will this go upside when the ER is out next week? My guess is $50 anybody with me? Forget about locking period expiration, no one is selling and all are aiming for $100 in an year."
Set up sell orders to $40 at least
Very strange : it dropped so fast early in the morning in low volumesSomeone has sold a big block ?
It’s my understanding this stock could hit 60 by April. Did I hear this right ?Thoughts ? Catalyst ?
What a patriot. Gives me the chills. Game Changer. Visionary. Backbone. Balls. Genius. See you in el caribe

"Guys never vote for liberals again please, don’t vote for this globalist liberals see what’s going on with market"
I believe the earnings of last quarter 2020 will be one of the best quarter of PLTR in 17years. I can't wait to see it reaches $50 on Feb 17.
Its really interesting how low the niveau is in here. I don't get the idea of the pump and sell posts. To all the shorts and pumpers: check the valuation of the company and accept that your wierd messages will make the stock niether go up or down. Its tidysome to mute all this spaming. This place could be great for posting news and real opinions.
Can’t wait for 45
"I have a serious question for those of you with any sales background. I work/sell tech and most of our clients (especially in the current economy/pandemic) opt for 12 month or at the very longest 36 month agreements given the future is uncertain...What does it tell you all that BP has opted to not only renew but renew for another 5 years? Please wake up...Thiel and Karp have long felt like Big Tech has done everyday Americans a disservice. They direct listed to allow ALL of us to benefit and prosper off of their genius..Yet some of you want to ask why they haven't turned a profit? The answer to that profit question is EVERYWHERE should you just read into the company, watch some youtube clips of Thiel or Karp...They have a trail of crumbs that they've lift for retail investors and some refuse to look down to follow it? Buy and hold..."
Futures up we close at $30 tomorrow
Boom! New 6 year deal.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-faurecia-embark-long-term-115900407.html
Is worth to buy today?
Algo read my tag
I was out of chips for this dip. :(
Been accumulating and holding from November last year.
What? only up +.45 after what I saw and heard? Are we clearing the way for a large institutional buying today? I wonder when they will be done buying to let PLTR go over $30 again?
"I'm so bullish I'm selling my blue chips and buying LEAPS(long term calls) on this now. Y'all have no idea how big this company will be, honestly."

LOADING UP ON JANUARY 2022 CALLS CHEAPER AS PLTR GOES LOWER.Those CALLS will soar once the market recovers imo.
Can I fall asleep and wake up in 2 years time and see it at $350 wondering why was I stressed watching this loitering around $25...everyone please plug out from daily stress watching this...forget this for a year anyways...Thiel and Elon are from the same stables...they are the founders of the next industrial revolution!!!
Alot of talk on WSB about next week. I think its time to buy
I am gonna hold this for like 20+ years lol
"I’m 18 but only have 170 shares, buying since $9.03 at an average of $17 and won’t sell till I graduate university."
who is here not selling any shares before or after 2/18 and only buy more if dips nicely?
"Today's deep thinking:1. Imagine that there are ONLY 1000 trucks2. Each of those trucks can be loaded with PLTR stocks3. I have loaded my truck and I am waiting to unload when the time is right4. Now, there are 999 other trucks that are currently loading and unloading each day5. As time goes by, we will get to a point where we have some balance where these 1000 trucks are fully loaded with PLTR stock6. Just like me, these 1000 trucks don't want to unload until the time is right7. Now, the 1000 truckers (including myself) will wait... and wait... and wait... until buyers are willing to pay $30 per share...8. At that points, I become a little greedy and I start to gently unload my truck by selling 10% of my PLTR holdings and wait....9. Is this a good strategy to load and unload the PLTR truck?10. Is this how Cathie Wood loads and unloads her PLTR truck?Peace!"

"Cash 12-2019 = $1BCash 12-2020 = $2BRevenues will surpass the $4B guidance for 2025; according to historical ave of over 44%, expect revenue upwards to $8B. So how much cash will PLTR accumulate?"
"This is a marathon not a sprint. If you can’t handle the wild swings then this is not the stock for you. I suggest Costco or Visa, which are great companies, but move really slowly. I expect Palantir to be a roller coaster of a stock for several years until it becomes more stable. Most IPO’s are. If you believe in this company then load up. Five years from now it’s probably going to be worth 10 times higher than it is now."
Dear PltrWe have had happy days with you in the past ... Why are you doing this to us now?
"ark like ptlr, no worry !!!"
Palantarians: I hope some of you bought Yeti like I rec'd last week. It's not even close to done. Big Winner.When will we hear about TSLA and PLTR joining forces...soon enough soon enough.
Hold for 4 years

"Coupa over 1 year in range $25 -$32. PLTR platforms more superior then a logistics specific platform. Like Coupa and other important companies with platforms, Palantir building clients but much faster. Today COUP $250, 4 years after IPO. PLTR will climb higher each qtr."
Guys it’s time for this to soar. Let’s go Let er eat!!
Year over year producer prices came in at 2.8%. This is bad for growth stocks.
This stock is a big time yawner.
"TODAY was probably the *only* day in two months that it was good advice to ""buy the dip""."
heading back to $30+
Wow. The market really seems to be sinking into the close. A bad sign of things ahead?
pltr is down so much that a 4 percent day is only .90 cents..lol
"I remember when Palantir was $9.00, and the bashers harped the same rhetoric. Amazing..!!!"
You guys will be part of history on this one. Great vision in this company
"Going to be funny when we dont see lockup sell off , we are under the price before IBM , Rio,ect.. As we know , when it does take up it goes up with a quickness"
Guys look what just happened to GME LOL
"First of I am a long investor in PLTR. What happened today was typical of big money selling off and locking in profits to drive the price down and clear out short term investors then buy the shares back at a better price. Look at the low volume today. I expect tomorrow to be high Volume and would be surprised if we are not back to 36 or higher because there is no trading Monday and earnings are pre-market on Tuesday. So if you were waiting for a pull back in order to get in, today was that opportunity. Last thought, I would not fear the lock up expiration. If earnings are not as expected and we see lowest or high 20's after earnings do you think people will unload their shares when they see that it hit $45. Also I think Thiel and Karp have a ton of money to buy those shares on Fri the 19th if they beat earnings and get a pop to reward not only their employees but to drive out the shorts and reward us longs for our loyalty!! I want to wish you all good luck. In 25 years of investing and being in on some very good trades early in aapl, goog, Tesla. I can tell you PLTR is 100 stock in 18-24 months. I do think that values are stretched past 45 but at 40-45 is a good value if they beat on earnings especially with IBM being a great start into the corporate world with the GOVT being a solid income source forever."

"People need to do their DD, look at my history comments for this Stock, told ya there was a Dip coming, granted didn't know the dip was this high. Still I sold part of my shares to lock in the price at 38.00, now I am using the funds to get back in. My guess is tomorrow after the lockup expires, see where the price is at, to those that stay, its still good, this stock will hit triple by next year, I just wanted to cash out and have money to get back in to get more shares, I love this Stock!!!"
$25 average and holding for at least a year. Ya'll mfs either have paperhands or you love bending all the way down for Uncle Sam.
"Ark and others buying.Lock up is done.Earnings is done.We’ve survived citron.Survived the 25% dip in 2 days.What more can they do? . I appreciate the dip in price, added more and holding strong."
Tomorrow +18% ..... The lion has woken up !
All these shorts going to have nightmares all weekend knowing ARK bought 5M shares today
happy I just bought! Very nice entry point to load up again
Buy and hold. This stock will be back to $40+ within days.
Gap up huge Monday like at least 15% I’m loading up 2k at 4am! Will increase my position to 6k holding for 5 years! See you at 2k in 5 years!
$26 is now support. Next stop $30. Good luck
I did a little swing trading today to get chips for the dip!! Increased my holdings by more than 20%.
I like the vision and culture of Palantir. Worlds most important software company
Not Selling
Why is this the only red stock out there? What’s the deal with PLTR?
CONGRATS if you caught BFT under $15 last week. It’s still under $17 for now.BFT highly anticipated merger with PAYSAFE coming. 
looks like market bottom in futures rallying hard
Cathie is bae
all I know is my bosses hedge fund was loading up on this all week. He told me to buy all I could. He has only done that one other time. He is a multi millionaire so I will follow him.
Next week Tuesday $42 ~ $50
Event coming in April to focus on the Foundry platform.
Palantir refuses to work with China government! Just like Google!
"I don't like short term predictions, but here it goes.. $30 by 16 April."
"Don't miss the train, last call!"
breaking the 24.66???LETS DO THIS
About 50 days until Q1 earnings. Can not see too many analysts believe the $4B guidance for 2025 when Rev comes in at $350m. It will be more like $8B at least for 2025.
eh...futures -3.5%; another bad day? I'm a bit concerned about the trend
"These are very bad signs for the market in general. -2,5% NASDAQ ending +1.55% The market does not know what to think or what to do. Panic is very close."
Thank you who ever sold me their shares. Going golfing. See you all later. Don’t forget to have fun.

Once again shorts lose
Do you think Palantir and their technology can help me find my father? He left when I was 7 and I have never seen him or from him again.
Hit 30 today
volume is .....wow....
So much bashing of the founders and insiders. The same ones that cut out the bankers to direct list at $10.
The effects of the lock up expiration have been greatly exaggerated by the general market correction in tech. I am of the opinion that two birds may be been killed with one stone and this is the new ground zero and we go up next week.Good luck to you all.
The funny thing is that most who are selling don’t know why they’re doing so. Just following other blind sheep.
Will rip premarket! Cathie wood baby loaded up 81 million dollars worth of shares after market closed Friday! 30$ tomorrow!
"Read my previous posts guys I told you to hold, this is just the beginning of a great run PLTR"
PLTR = 19% SHORT INTEREST IM NOT SELLING@! I HAVE DIAMOND HANDS NOT PAPER TENDIES
it's like taking candy from a baby.
added more at 25.20!
I have come to a point where I do not care when PLTR is red because I know it has great future.
technical analysis says bullish trend beginning. hope everyone averaged down or loaded up!
A lot of emotion with Pltr on here. No panic... This is a great company.
"My girlfriend said: ""Me or Palantir?""Sometimes I miss her."

I see this ripping to high 29-30$ today!"
"Just keeps moving up in AH. Up now $1.50 (6.00%) on volume of 8.2 million, Yes, the Cathy effect does matter!"

150 @ 27 if it drops little more this week I will load the boat
After hours today back to 27.50
whats a good price to buy 50 more?
We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money. Check for yourself: $NDAQ at all time highs today whereas $IXIC slumps. IF this game ain't rigged to the core I don't know anymore. ALGOS + NDAQ Exchange collusion? You bet... $baba $tsla $aapl $momo $msft $dji $pltr $fb $goog $jd $nflxSEC please step it and go after the algo traders and exchanges. The fish always starts smelling bad at the head.
My net position in PLTR is +10% but I would not sell this. I have got diamond hands. Who else has diamond hands. Thumbs up! To the moon 
Holding 367 shares )) grabbed 100 more today at 25.05
ho ho ho! going up!
This is just the beginning for PLTR.

"I see PLTR started down, but is making its climb to regain ground."
Peter Thiel plans to integrate soft mechanics into the foundry platform so businesses like 3M can benefit from the ease of use it will bring. It's tremendous to bring simplification to the platform because it allow companies to mutlilayer their marketing. A lot of people will be able to join and sell their products and benefit from the pyramid. The oversimplifiaction can drive consumers into purchasing more of the foundry and government contracts like gotham brings the appeal of palantir to a different level.
"if this hits 100 usd in 1 year or more, i will give the first and last comment 10,000"
If it breaks 26 it should go to 29 right? Any graph guys here?
this stock is struggling and I own 750 shares 
Get ready for a string of upgrades today and tomorrow now that the institutions are all in already
Nadaq selloff picking up steam. Great (sarcasm)
Oh this was wild. The worst is over. Reflection is coming. I'm still -23% but i'm confident about PLTR.
"Once the insiders with zero cost shares are done selling, which is today, the buying pressure will bring this back to 35 in a breathtaking manner!"
"For those panicking, here’s some solid advice to reduce your stress in the future:1. Do your DD and never invest because of advice you get from a friend, yahoo, or firms. 2. Distribute your money with diversification. You’re much better off investing about 25% of your portfolio in 3-4 ETFs (spread across 3-4 different sectors) + the remaining 75% into a variety of companies you believe in, preferably around 8-12, spread amongst multiple sectors of the economy.Gives you exposure to many different areas of growth but also minimizes, not eliminates, the odds of you waking up one day with half your money gone in the toilet.3. You only lose when you sell impatiently. Avoid emotional highs (where the market is doing great so you keep buying up everything) & emotional lows (omg it’s red= let me sell and cut my losses). 4. Read above: be patient. When the next man/woman panics, you buy."
positive please
"Palantir signed an important distribution deal with IBM (NYSE: IBM), which will integrate Palantir's offering into the IBM Cloud Pak, immediately increasing Palantir's distribution to 2,500 IBM enterprise salespeople all over the world -- a massive increase over Palantir's own capabilities.

5 a.m. and all i have is PLTR on my mind
I anticipate news tomorrow 7am
Wish I could buy in premarket these prices are a steel
"Can someone explain why this i dropping? Serious answers please. Contract after contract good report,and a great future ahead. Don’t understand?"
"Cathie just added another 460,300 shares."
might as well just buy all calls on this thing up to 100
Sell Sell Sell
"WOW. Huge open interest on 30 calls, expiring 2/26. Following Kathy is gonna cost some people a bundle if things don't turn around quick"
Not sure about anyone else but it seems very reassuring that the price stayed consistent around $25. This is a great base to build from and go up from here!
PLTR $100 BY END OF THIS YEAR 2021
and there we go again into red territory  am I the only one that have a big portion of the portfolio invested in but not worried at all about this dip?
Everyone on this board expects price to go down at lock up exp date! Market is counter intuitive. The shorts already depressed the price re: lock up the last 3 days. Now they just need to cover after Tuesday morning!
Buy asap !
When the institutions next report their holdings which will include A LOT of Palantir you will realize that on days like this (if you sell) you have been played. Relax and look at the big picture.
Going to moon today

"AI competition just began w/ IBM's adaptation of Foundry...Will Oracle, MSFT follow? This is huge...huge for PLTR Stock."
"Anyone selling/writing covered calls here? I would like to generate some income with my PLTR holdings. I'm looking at April 1st expiration at $40. Premiums are currently too low but as the share price hopefully rises in the near term I hope to get a decent premium. My time frame is shorter than most of you so this strategy should work for me. If I'm assigned at $40.00, so be it. Looking at historical option prices premiums have been much higher over the last few weeks as the underlying share price was much higher. Hopefully our share price will move back to the 30's. What price premium appreciation could we expect, base on previous activity? Asking this to those who are considering a similar strategy. GLTA"
Why this stock is not moving forward at all :((
"Buy order went through at $28.10. Thank you. Next stop for me is $27.55 if you panic sellers bring it down further. Still way ahead. 30% annual growth projections for the next 5 years according to Karp. Ah, yeah."
That could be a good strategy! Lol
"Bloomberg reports “For the year, Palantir posted a first-ever operating profit, ending nearly two decades of sustained losses at the company. Annual adjusted operating income in 2020 was $190 million on revenue of $1.1 billion, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Each number exceeded analysts’ expectations. Palantir also issued a first-quarter sales growth forecast of 45%.”"
Every drop is a bonus.. every drop is like black FridayTake advantage and add more ￼ ￼
Thank God we’re not going to have to deal with all the lockup bs talk after this week. Finally people can talk about the long term future and not some meaningless short term insider sales.

I dont think the shorts will get enough sleep tonight knowing whats waiting for them
"23.36 $ resistance, if we break its down to 15-16$"
"Relax guys, this has to be fun and bring joy! Keep it that way"
Could this be the big purchase Peter Theil filed for? Maybe he put a buy order at $25 which is holding the stock there.
"I have said this before and will say again, it is all about waiting. Don’t worry for the flat days because it will take just 1 or 2 good days to reach 31 from 25. Look at the charts."
So let me sum this up . The insiders have the first chance to sell after 16 odd years and they are not doing that much at all and our friend Cathy is loading up . What direction do you guess this could go now ?
I believe PLTR will be $40-$50 next week. Bullish on PLTR.
"The irony here is shorts think that they have skills but are too obtuse to understand that brilliant a.i. machines on wall st created the bear market last few days. As fast as it goes down the same machines will reverse it. It’s a different game now. Human analytics are inferior. All the more reason Palantir prospers massively this decade. Fundamentally speaking, wow, what a company. And you know it, wall st knows it(though they will grapple with accepting it), hedge funds definitely know it, pension funds will get to know it more and more, quickly probably. Lock up schmockup. It will be pleasing to listen to Simon’s Sounds of Silence once this ephemeral storm blows over and the bears go back to their caves. Meanwhile the bulls will enjoy the sounds in their Catalonian Palaces. Lovely indeed. Winner. Cena de Pollo. Big"

"60 days away form 1Q +45% Revenue Growth. The second quarter, since going public, will hopefully reflect and validate the penetration into comercial business. In my opinion and watching PLTR for so long, the story gets stronger!!!"
"To be or not to be , that is the question . Tuesday when I wake up PLTR will be delivering music to my ears.Remember when Citron, MS, Sisi credit etc,etc call PLTR a casino ? Well,well,well, here we are looking at 40 pps .This is not a meme stock ! Release Tiberius !"
yes people were saying this will see 40 today looking at yesterday's AH action... NASDAQ sure gave a dose of reality!
Every day PLTR investors lose more money. Management is making millions.
If this was fastly the stock would be up 50
"i am really worried i bought some days before and now the price is going down, can i hold it ?"
Premarket means nothing
you should have bought the banks. much easier less stress ful ride.

If you’ve done some research then you should know this stock is way cheap than its competitors.
"I wonder what you expected when the CFO selling close to 1mio shares from 24$ to $29...if an insider is doing this, all others will do the same coming out of no sell timeline. This stock will go down before it goes up. Don`t average down yet. wait at least 2 consecutive days of green and then load the boat..."
To bearish investors
It's important to understand that Ark Invest has access to information most of us don't.
Increased my position to 27%. I hope I'm not making a huge mistake not going all in on this stock. It's really enticing but I have to stay disciplined
Palantir needs to ink a HUGE Military contract.
Any thoughts on why it’s in this price range the entire day?

"This is going to $100. May have a few pull backs, but once the short squeeze happens it’s gonna fly."
Here is the bottom line with this company. You buy at any price. And 5 years later you have no idea what you just did. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
S&P is flat PLTR is down 4.4% what if tomorrow S&P is down 4% ? It looks like company executive are still selling big chunk of their holdings. I was lucky selling all shares this morning. Good Luck PLTR bulls
7 of the last 10 days have been red. We need some news or something to pick this stock back up. Bullish but it's getting annoying.
Buy this now or go buy something else you heard PLTR will do well in the future

"This is where the real investors are separated from the wannabe “investors”.Anybody can look like a genius while buying stocks as the entire market is doing exceptionally well, NOW is when you really see who knows what they’re doing.It’s been a bloodbath in tech since feb 9th-10th.Everybody is panicking. People are selling to secure profits. THIS is where you are expected to sell, but if history tells you anything: it’s that emotional highs & lows are a bad thing.Nobody likes to wake up day after day and see they lost unrealized gains, I feel the same way, I’ve lost many MANY unrealized gains in tech since that date, but patience is crucial.Put your portfolio/phone away for a week or two, go outside and do something, and reevaluate later.Don’t do something dumb today because you’re on a emotional low and don’t see the light . The market generally grows. Be patient"
Ooppsss... it’s green already LOL
I was expecting to see $32-33 by now - Not Good!
This is testing my patience. Lol
Durning the last earnings report some pretty wild claims were made... 30% growth every year for 5 years.... if they hit this target everyone invested will make very nice gains... if they miss these targets but continue yearly billion dollar compensation then us investors are in trouble
Giddy-up Horsy!!!!The wheels on the bus go round and round....Do I need to give you a Scooby snack to go over $24?or maybe some LUBE to keep it up?
OMG Palantir is likely to explode towards $ 30 today. The upward trend looks bullish plus new great collaboration

Added PLTR this morning. GL guys!
Told you PLTR is going to soar up!
Buy and Hold!
does anyone have that problem when they sell it will fly? if you do can you sell? thanks.
is everyone here comfortable with the float?
*don’t you know pump it up* starts to play. Green here we come! 
"I have a feeling this is that phenomena in the stock market where, since everyone anticipates the stock to sell off, either because of lockup expiration or the ""stock has gone up too much. It's up x% this year!"", it'll only continue to go higher; leaving all the naysayers and non-believers behind. A selloff after a lockup expiration is not a sure thing. The stock selling off heading into earnings does not determine the move of the stock post-earnings either. Bears and short-term bulls are bearish. This makes me bullish, lol. Long 5,400 shares at $33.45."
$27 coming soon
"You don't day trade palantir, accumulate."
Keep selling guys
"The sentiment is negative on this board, therefore, the stock will continue to tank. Sell"
"I’m all in, way more than I should. 30% of my portfolio!"
"""Palantir said it has entered into a six-year strategic partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia"" What is meant by ""strategic partnership?This how customer-supplier relationships are defined? what do you think?"
Let's have a good laugh !!!
"I'm comfortable with a wide range of earnings outcomes. I'm long term. If it's upbeat, nice. If it's dissapointing, I look for the right opportunity to add shares. I own this. I don't trade it."
"$PLTR should rally Thursday with boost from the $BUZZ ipo, along with short squeeze from reddit and wall street bets."
Add 2500 shares .
"Palantir owns the future of data analytics and beyond. We only get to see what they show us. What other disruptive and ground-breaking initiatives are in the works? Palantir is like $CRWD $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $CRM $FSLR ...buy it, put it in a drawer, then open it in 5 years. You're welcome."
"If you didn't sell when it hit $45, it's because you thought it was worth more. Why would any one sell now?Investors always win. (ups and downs are part of the game) Gamblers always lose. FACT"

"Credit Suisse downgrading PLTR and then buying $200m worth of shares on 12/31 is a tell tale sign that retail traders are not in control. In the last week PLTR institutional ownership increased from 12% to 20%. Follow what the hedge funds do, not what they say. What you think the ER is going to look like doesn’t matter. But what the hedge funds think it’s going to look like does matter."
Nothing is happening with palantir. Tech and growth stocks under pressure with rising bonds. You dont likey what i say? In that case. Palantir just came out with a new program called metropolis. It's to combat the highly speculative news on facebook and twitter. They're going to data mine internet companies and capture ad revenue from B2B and B2G. They'll be working with high profile clients from bill gates and warren buffet to master the their metropolis platform and integrate gamma mechanics into their new metropolis ecosystem. This should give you some bulls to think about and make sure to buy more shares.
Cratering wahoo. Just when I buy
"25.20 ceiling, if broken, we will go to 25.45"
close above 26.55 today
Wow up today. What a surprise .
Cramer said he's not a buyer of Palantir. Cramer also said not to buy SNAP a few years ago. I did not listen to him on SNAP and made a fortune. I also am ignoring him on Palantir and except to have another multi bagger!!
"I like how they are investing aggressively now and for the future. Their outlook isn't short term, they have high growth potential, great team working and in a very high growth industry. In the 100-200 range next couple years"
Ouch
Red Monday it’s coming. Read walletinvestor forecast.. sell and buy Thursday.

Soon $45
Buy asap and Hold !

"this is def a discount, 30 tomorrow"
"will go to maybe 22.50, then that will be the last time to get it that cheap ever again, will be 50$ by the end of the year,"
"nice!, running up for open"
"Still love the company, but not good that $25 support just broke."
Am I Warren buffet? No. Am I up 253% this current year? Yes.How? Patience 
Any Guesses? will PLTR open on Monday premarket higher than $30 or lower?
Pump that volume up!!!
"Everyone, mark my words. Palantir will be the future of tech. No pump"
"If you're a long term - 5 to 10 year horizon - investor it wont matter if you buy it at 20 or 10. This is a 100 stock in 5 years. Do your research, their tech is way ahead of all their competitors. The coming data tsunami and the need to analyze the data will make PLTR the #1 analytics company in the world. And we havent even addressed the need to analyze logs to identify trails of hackers attacking Western companies/govts. Buy so you average down. But do your research."
Palantir rising war in the garden of Google. A must read on SeekingAlpha

"Bought the dip again, love the stock"
why is the market open early today
Crameer's own words before he was big public figure for stock forecasting were that he lied to get people to invest and manipulate stock movement. Nothing novel as that is how market makers/movers work the retail investors. With Palantir you have senior management encouraging long term holds. These guys are the real deal.
60 per share at the end of the year
150% of average volume in the first hour.
Q1 2021 in profit
"Buy at 10 no buy now, going to 40 no will be 50 soon.. Dont be a gambler, be an investor."
"Doesn’t matter the fluctuation of these days. Palantir will be $100 in a year. 03.2022: Palantir will be $100. If the price goes below $20 and after pop up to $30 it’s egal. I mean longs always wins. It’s all about statistics my friends. Buy as much as you afford and if you don’t need the money in next year, jackpot. Good luck everyone."
Alex Karp came off as arrogant. I do not understand how Karp criticizing Silicon valley executives is going to help Palantir investors. The stock price took a dive after his interview. I am disappointed.
Seems like everyone and there mother is a seller while the buyers are nowhere to be found. Where have they gone I don't see them anywhere?
Everything will be fine. Just wait and let the management come back from Europe from skis. Ha ha.
I THINK I should keep buying more pltr for long term because: They have tons of long contracts with many large cap companies and I believe in 10 years from now this will be added the the S&P500 and be also added to FAANGM I TRULY believe faangm will turn into MAPFANG the p got Palantir of course
is the AWS partnership priced in?
hoping the stimulus package contains a big contract for Palantir.
I am so glad I was able to buy more shares at $20.90 today.
I personally think that we will turn green after the market opens!
"Amazing how Thiel, Sankar, and Cohen tanked their own company by dumping shares. When your leadership doesn't have confidence in their own company, neither will the worker bees. Hence, the insider sell off. This is officially a Zombie Stock."

I am planning to invest in PLTR stock but not sure at what price range I should start my position. Any suggestion will be helpful..

"APRIL 14th is the day to watch.Watch what happened the week ahead of demo day 1/21, from $23 to $45 We are building a base for the big rocket "

"For those newbies reading all the BS on this board about PLTR reaching ""$100 by EOY"" and $400 next year and comparing it to Google, Microsoft, etc., do your research, its BS. If you're willing to lock up your money for decades (especially with the monster float on this stock), you have shot...if PLTR performs. And again, for comparison purposes, lets look at how long it took for two giants to reach their loft valuations (and yes both have massive profits. This could indeed be the next Google, but it also could be the next Enron. You'll have to lock up your money for years to find out.GoogleSept 2004 $50April 2005 $100April 2009 $200Oct 2013 $500Oct 2017 $1000Current $1800MicrosoftMay 1986. 12 centsDec 1996 $10Nov 2012 $26June 2018 $98Current $231"
Gonna finish green
I rembember times when PLTR used to rocket every time they announced partnership :D
another thing people need to understand is once several big corporations and governments jump on board this other private corporations will notice the positive side of having palantir on their side to help their business. they will have to use palantir to keep up with competition. it's kind of like the EV market right now everybody knows in the automobile industry that electric cars are the future so the first guy that starts the new EV cars I'm going to be the ones on in the front burner. if they don't keep up if competition does not keep up with their competitors they will lose out same thing is happening with palantir there will be forced to use their services because volunteers competition is out of their league
"10 y Bond 1,72 right now. Support 24,30 can be broken today and later come to $20 - Head and Shoulders line. Healthy correction needed under $20, preferably under $15, where it can be attractive."
"just bought 27 shares, not much but i hope it helps"
"PLTR is a durable company establishing a competitive advantage with bread and butter connections to the government producing IP that can be turned on the public providing almost monopolistic goods and services well into the future. This is a company to invest in as it invests in itself. Trading this stock isn't likely the best strategy but holding it for the long term provides the highest probability of outperformance. I bought this stock to own a piece of a company not to daily count the sheckles in my brokerage account. Patience pays!! If you bought a house would you worry about how much that house is worth the day, week, month or years after closing? Of course not because you bought with the intention of holding that property for a long time. If you bought into a franchise you can ask the same question. I am personally excited to own a piece of a company that could be the next google or amazon.https://youtu.be/uC2UZ4PxRWk"

"I was just reading a comment made by Jim Cramer that im really not sure what he means. He said,"" PLTR is a black box "". And therefore would not recommend it. Does that mean the company isn't transparent? I think that is what is means. For the record im bullish on the company and would like everyone's thoughts. Thank you in advance."

TESLA announcement soon
hello your friend Tesla is up 16bpercent so hurry up or else you lose your firend.
IM HERE! PLTR is doomed ! I bought in today at 29.24 . Every stock I buy gets crushed after I buy it! It will never go above my buy price as long as I am holding it . It's 100 % guaranteed!
Above 30??
I can realistically see a $30+ close today.
Buying back at $22

what's you price target for PLTR
I am getting in on Monday. This may be a good one long-term.
Just hit 1000 shares! This stock is gonna be big long term!!!
I'm dropping $2k in this thing tomorrow because all you people praying to break even has to mean something with the man up stairs & it has to go up I hope.
Doesn't take a genius to realize if it's holding on a day like today.... this is the floor
News every week. They can't keep this low forever haha.
Going up after that sleepy speech.
I ain't playing around. I sold most my stuff and made this 50% of my portfolio. Belive in Cathy woods and the hype

Just knowing that I'm early and it will continue to grow is all I need to sleep at night. fyi... $GBTC is number two in my portfolio. Another one I don't need to watch and feet over. I'll start wringing my hands when $GBTC hits 1200."
Roblox stock market dip. Sell your shares cheap and chase that scam. So disappointed with their misrepresentation of a DPO.
Should you believe in Cramer and hedgefund? Do you think they would want you to make profit? I just believe in my own research.
This is too cheap when we look back @100+ later! 
"The company had a pretty good year with 47% YoY Revenue growth for full-year 2020 and expects that growth to be bigger than 30% for 2021. Data is slowly becoming the most valuable commodity on the planet and Palantir is exactly where it needs to be to take advantage of that. Data collecting and analyzing isn't going to slow down in the years to come, it's only going to accelerate. And that's why Palantir is going to win and win big."
"the whole market down but we're still up nearly 2%just imagine when the market recover, how much we can reach :D"
another day another 2k of my investment gone..
PLTR: What a bargain price for such great company. May never see price this low again.
Broken 25
Whoever is judging Palantir by their current earnings is making a huge mistake. This company is in a space where there is no competition and they will be printing money in the future. Data mining using AI technologies is the future.
Be careful at the last 30 minutes of trading. Seems as if it slides down. Look at the 5 day chart. You’ll see a slide that happens every day. I’m in at 300 shares at $28.54. Holding. This is great software. I’ve used a small part of it.

I do not know about anyone else but I am looking forward to Wilfred’s interview with Alex Karp today.
Tesla is up almost 20% today...Any particular reason why?
"Being one of the only positive stocks yesterday shows the commitment of investors, amazing!!! GLTA!!"
so i really did miss out on 22$
You really think most insiders would sell after the lockup when the stock already corrected? Most insiders probably know it’s already at a value price. You’d think that will make it harder for them to sell
Can someone please explain to me the problem with Palantir?? They literally beat earnings estimate every quarter by A LOT . So what is everyone’s deal here??? What’s with the sell rating and the drop? What’s wrong with people?
"If you dont trust Alex Karp and his team to work on your $, dont buy.I have done my research and I like what I am seeing."

keep those hands steady
They said I was wrong to buy April 16th...$20 Calls....
"Whoa, pre-markets are sliding! Doesn’t look good for tomorrow!"
I'm adding more if there is any dips this week. 50k ready
everyone tripping on this lockup dip. nothing changed about the company and its future. all those selling just giving institutions and us long-term investors a gift. thank you paper handed peeps
It's a tug of war so far
I tell people to buy PLTR before it get to 108. Thumbs up  if you buy.
I don’t claim to be a PLTR expert but it seems this is the new Tesla stock. I’ve bought calls to see what happens.
"I was not expecting 30 today like many other posters were writing. I was looking for it to hold 25 or 26 though. As it turns out, we are or about to go red 40 minutes into trading..."
My sources tell me: PLTR is going To The Moon!!!
well im glad I didn't sell. thanks for the free advice.
"I’m going on record. I believe we see $50 by close on market on March 5th at the latest.Institutional ownership rose 8-9% in the last couple of weeks during the shale from ATH at $45.. That’s lot of accumulation in a short period of time all while keeping the stock at bay... Paper hands got shook out good...And rest assured there’s a whole slew of other institutions who aren’t as big of risk takers but are watching very closely to say if we deliver and potentially exceed our 1st public quarter guidance since direct listing. This is the 1st show me quarter after our come out statements. Institutions like to see a habit of beating guidance. Let’s be clear. We’re going to exceed and post our first ever profitable year. For some context:Tesla gained 700% since first reporting profitabilityAmazon gained 25,000% since first reporting profitabilitySee you March 5th for a check in :)#notallthatisgoldglitters"
ark got a lot. this is going to go back up easy
"There’s a rumour on Stocktwits that they are selling data to hedge funds who are shorting stocks with high levels of bullish sentiments so now everyone is tagging bearish on purpose to trick the algorithm. Should we try it here too? Haha On that note, pltr to £100"
$50 coming soon
Cathie Wood says Karp speaks their language and they're playing in a huge space...
"Cramer mentions absolutely nothing about the revenue beats. Q1 2019 revenue was $146m, we will start the year off $350m, passing 100% growth in 24 months (and starting Sept 2020 non government sector began to understand the platforms)."
Tmr will be the last chance to buy. While everyone figure out during weekend. Monday is going to the moon!
My goal is to get to 1k shares and it’s days like this that keeps making it easy
Why its up guys ?? Any news ??
Selling my oil stocks which have tons more room to go up to buy this dip. Might need to sell my wife next.
50+ in 2 weeks. Easy.
something big about to happen !
Slow and steady.
Why is this stuck?? And Tsla goes up by $118 in a day!!!...I'm having no luck with investing.
Wooow.... How a partnership with amazon leads this so down!
Today! Pré market should be over 8%!
"Palantirs revolutionary AI software will be lead top tier companies to modernized their existing hardware/software and thus allow PLTR additional growth. I wouldn't be surprised if PLTR is a major household name within the next 5 years. At the current rate of expansion, PLTR software will be used for every major industry and political governance. Big Brother tech at its finest."
This stock is a tremendous machine. 10Y broke 1.635 and it continues to go up!
Really? goes down 1.25 recovers .11?
We will close around $28 today

Since the insider unlock the air has really come out of this one. It's clearly outpacing demand. But one question: do all those shares now added to the float actually count to dilute earnings?
Palantir and Faurecia Embark on Long-Term Strategic Partnership#PLTR
We're proud to team up with AWS this baby will go to the moon.
up from here folks.
"If you’re in a long position, what are you worried about. I haven’t even looked at my gains on this in weeks. This is an easy set and forget it!"
Cathie found some change in her car's ashtray and bought another 145K shares. ARKW is almost at 5 Million shares. Will she push to it to 7.5 like ARKK?
with all the anticipation of a dip following lockup - why do you think Thiel's Hedge fund Mithril AP filed to buy some 180 million worth of shares? see you on the moon
why didnt I buy @ 21.00 last week :(
Thinking of selling my 2000 shares of AT&T and put them in Palantir. Thumbs up if you agree
Hold this stock & don’t look at it for another 5 years
Get ready longs
This market has so many IPO's and over valued stocks with little revenue. Palantir is exponentially gaining revenue with new contracts . Buy the dip and Hold
This stock is probably the safest stock to have your money in today (aside from large blue chip stocks).
I am all in @25.96$Can you also please put comments on what prices you got in? thanks
I can see your cards!
AMC about to break out gone green
Let the good times roll
$PLTR - rumorWall street bets hype about doubling PLTR.Need to watch if volume pours in.Possible 20-100% run
Did my DD and will be getting in tomorrow morning hopefully under 28$
Game-afication of stock trades huh? Wallstreet invented that with short/algo attacks. look at the ladder down in the last hour. :)
I actually purchased Software from Palantir and used it to aggregate/analyze the data from the price action and the consensus is that it’s going to the moon
"The Palantir says, ""Buy now or pay a lot more in 2022."""
my 1st cousin bought an apple and i am buying a palantire'
"ALL IN PALANTIR.Truly believe in the success of this company.Fasten your seatbelts, tomorrow we will start our journey. Enjoy ;)"

TEXAS POWER GRID CONTRACT IN A WEEK........
Let’s take this to $200 like we did GME. No reason why we shouldn’t....or couldn’t. Just have to work TOGETHER.
Added another 9k shares !!! To the moon we go !!
"LlOL. A replay of yesterday. Uo premarket, but will be down again once insiders ump their shares. Red by 10. Longs, please stay away from sharp utensils and open windows today."
this thing moves like a Toyota Corolla offroading
"No competition, many government contracts...this is just starting...this tech stock will be at least 1500+ in 3-5 years....look at other unique tech stocks where they r now..."
Back to $40
wish pltr stock going to up 20% + on Tuesday
let's close green 
Been watching this stock for awhile. Finally pulled the trigger. Long 500 at 22.33. GL all
$26 today!!!!!!!!!
Bought 2k more yaaaayyy
Today marks the final end of the Cult of Palantir.
Up after hours. We’ll see how tomorrow goes.
"guys be real... its extremely unlikely that the price will rise in the coming days. im long, sold my position with a broken heart and waiting for a re entry. No sane institution or retail would buy before seeing if theres going to be lockup volatility. Stop denying the fact that this might happen and stop bashing the stock aswell. This stock is a winner 100% but for a few days it will drop a bit and its normal. im buying back in next week. PS Cathie Woods can stomac the drops and she probably has multiple buyin prices. She's in for a forseeable long run. if you're not, you should not follow the moves of someone who doesnt have the same timeline, it just doesnt make sense. can't wait to be back in ! next week should be exciting"
$28 by March 20th
40$ very soon
30 by the end of next week
"CASH GENERATION MONSTER:PLTR basically has NO DEBT! Almost 90% of Assets are LIQUID (which grew 50% since 12-31-2019). The company has projected a very conservative guidance of $4B in Rev by 2025. So, if it grows $600m in cash with $1B in Rev, what will it generate with $4B?"
Yahoo boards are driving the markets since decades now! LOL
Above $25 at close...
Is PLTR going to be next stock craze???
26.20 was yesterday's ceiling. We can break that today and are currently poised to do so. I say we close between 26.65 and 28
Have a wonderful day longs and enjoy the coming...
Holding the support at 22.5 real nice. Things will be higher soon. Option call of Apr 18 at $65 strike is huge. This will go higher and higher very soon. Just be patients longs.
"“Come with me, if you want to live”I love Palantir!!!! I will buy more PLTR."
"This is not my style but that being said.....This is going to the Moon.Congrats to all long term holders, enjoy the ride."
"Over the past 3 months, $28.60 has been the biggest resistance/support barrier."
Green green and more green
should i buy it from 26 $ ? any thoughts ?
When you don’t have money to buy because you thought you bought on the dip yesterday.I need more cash   $OCGN $NIO $SENS $TSLA $PLTR $BLNK $XPEV $PLUG $BLNK $LI $NVAX $IBIO
"Have a multi-thousand load near IPO price, but will add more if it drops to $25 on expire. Thank you for selling, i gladly take your shares."
"If you haven't figured out this game yet then this is another clear example of manipulation in order to get in at a lower price before the earnings release. Don't get suckered in and sell, in the hope that you can get back in a lower price.It doesn't take much work to figure out how many new contracts Palantir secured in this quarter and I would be surprised if they didn't have some interesting news to reveal aswell.Remember who the management and founders are. The best in the business.Price target of $44 after earnings."
I’m muting all the bot trolls
"Keep running from the fire! I’m looking to free up any amount of cash possible to continue to take advantage of this gift. For the record, I believe anything below $30 is a huge gift. If not for market factors we should have never retraced below that number with the IBM partnership, Q4 Earnings, 3M expansion, ARKK, Vanguard and funds adding in truck loads. Don’t care what price you grab it’ll be considered a solid trade within 60 days of the market correcting. This is sprung tight with new investors and many who are holding from higher prices.If you’re scared, sit on the sidelines but know you’ll be full of envy when many add 20-100% to their positions at these ranges.I’m not a perfect investor. Bought here at $10, added at nearly every price from $10 to $37 and have added at nearly every price from $37 down to $24. Know and believe in what you hold. If in doubt REVISIT your DD. It’s one of the easiest companies to research and if you’re savvy enough you will look beyond just the company headlines."
"don't sell, let it grow"
lol ceo say shet so they can buy calls
"The question is how much pltr does Cathie have now I guess around 100 million dollars worth, anyone with up date would be helpful"

"I never understood the correlation of Pltr to Gamestop, a video gaming store. It's like linking in palantir to Starbucks or Deere or Victorias secret. Mash potatoes and ice cream...."
is pltr merger with amazon would be so great for amazon
When the shorts realize theres no more profit to be made this will start climbing quicker
"Well, well look who woke up"
4K shares since the IPO holding strong. No plan to sell for the next 18 months! 
Is this stock going to take off this week orbit it another 25-27 week ?
it appears nobody is sellling expect the insiders. get out this stock before u get gut. this stock is heavily invested by foreign retailers any stock with such high numbers of foreign investment is bound to get gut for the short term. u didnt think they gona allow those outside money double. dont get caught up in the mix. last chance out.
This stock is hanging in there trying to climb every little bit.
"Palantir doesn't hire/employ hourly workers. These are well paid...well above average earners. They don't need the cash. Expect the lock up expiry to be a big, scary nobody sells quality at a bargain."
Glad I doubled @22 lmfao let's go
"This stock was $32 last Friday, its still up compared to a week ago. Chill out everybody. This is not some kind of sports bet, this is solid and promising company. Relax, stay long and enjoy the ride up. "
This will be 5% core holding in my portfolio until I retire.
Lets get $26
I'm not joking when I say this is a 1000 dollar stock.....
Stay long and strong Palantirians!!!!!!!
Cathy Wood will be on CNBC after commercial break.

Got my 1 share today for $24.61. Not a bad price.

"My fellow PLTR believers,I could have sold my beautiful PLTR shares for a nice profit:1. March-01-2021: $25.902. March-10-2021: $26.243. March-12-2021: $26.924. March-15-2021: $27.475. Should I be depressed? Sad? Feel down because I have missed at least 4 awesome opportunities to sell?6. Should I be listening to my DEEP INSTICTS when my Combustion engine = heart + head = Telling me to Sell High and Buy Low?7. These are the emotions of many PLTR investors...8. However, investing is like religion: We all say we believe in GOD, but the truth is that we all don't know how to describe this GOD and we just repeat the same ""empty?"" statement: Just Believe in God... you will go to heaven...9. My heaven = PLTR = $50Peace!"
"Most of the stocks today fallen by 5-15% today including $tsla $amzn and $aapl. So no worries, it is going to go back to $30 when the market turn to normal. Take a break..."
Its going down to $15 soon.
"The most bullish reasons for investing into PLTR right now: 1. dropped 50% in the last three weeks. 2. Share lockup is over and done with. 3.meme stock, but a great one, like apple/TeslaI’ll send you all a postcard from my yacht once we hit $420.69"
i guess its 50 50 but i hope we see some more buying on monday and not the speculative buying
"one thing is sure bros, shorts made a fortune and then they will be buying stocks with longs money !! lol!!!"
how is palantir teaming up with amazon not on the main news!!!
This little dip won't last.
Been buying dips for 2 weeks straight. I’m ready.
Congrats lings! This will make FOUR straight days in the red. Had enough?
No reason why SNOW is valued at 30 billion more market cap. PLTR makes more money and is closer to being profitable. Wall Street games....
Yessss Based on charts We will fly to 50$
https://www.palantir.com/solutions/cyber/
We are surpassing ️️ soon!
Btw has anyone seen apple job advert in london requiring Palantir experience in key qualifications?
I was in with hype and average down to 26 now with 3000 shares believed in this stock/ company Will Green back sooner than you expected 
Most people believe that today is another red day for tech. Hope market suprises us with green!
You guys are buying because Cathie Woods bought and hoping it will skyrocket now. While Cathie Woods would love to see it drop below $20 so she can buy more. Nothing is going to make this skyrocket until we get a powerful ER.
ALL HAIL PLTR
lord of the rings iv starts at 24...its the story
what a #$%$! didn't even recovery yesterday loss and keep dropping..
Down 30% in 2 days...happens very time I buy!!!!!
I guess no one likes this company anymore after yesterday
It's a bad sign when insiders are selling every share they own for whatever they can get for it.
"Wish I could see the faces of weak hands selling this week, next month. It's going to be hilarious."
"I think long term this stock definitely goes up,. but there's far too many calls this Friday for this to break out this week. I'd be super impressed & broke lol if it skyrockets tomorrow. May the odds be forever in your favor. :D"
The never green stock
BUY BUY BUY!!!!
"lol, 100mil in one hour, I bet the volume today will be greater than yesterday"
"Investing in PLTR is an investment in the American Empire and its tip tier companies. Look at it this way, having America and its top tier companies succeeding by using PLTR's tech will lead to PLTR'S success and overall profitability. New investors only want a quick profit, bash the company when it's down to the overall market being down, and don't understand the fundamentals of the company. Buy the company and watch it grow for years to come. PLTR as a whole is fundamentally strong and can prosper in a slow economy, booming economy, and even in a wartime economy."
This is a manufactured sell off!! big boys are getting in before the open watch this pop today
"Sleeping Bulll, all aboard as soon as you can"
Great dip buying opportunity when nothing fundamentally wrong with the company and ceiling is at $45
I came on here 10 days ago and recommended AMC theatres. In that time AMC has gone from 11 to 14 while PLTR has been stagnant. PLTR is a great company but all of these huge 2021 runup stocks are taking a break - and it going to be for a little while before they are back in favor. Come read the AMC forum to see why this is about the best play in the market now. The proof is in the pudding there. Cheers!
"Cramer is always been jealous, he’s going to be eating his words very soon "
Karps says he has MORE things to worry about than peeps complaining about the share price. He says NOBODY is forcing you to buy PLTR.
i own 8000 shares at 24. Will sell at 50
Off to a good start
Cathie pumps tesla endlessly but little to PLTR. .....Marcia Marcia Marcia!!
Ark bought 50 million shares. The market ran out of shares to sell.
If no one sells it could be $1000 by March. Just don't sell no matter what!!
"What's the main reason why their IPO was below $10/share, and now they're $25, and were just in the mid-$30s, even $40? Are they worth 3-5x what they were worth 5 months ago?"
"2 years time, palantir will be in the S&P500."
"I have 7000 shares at 24.25 , what yo do?"
It's time for me to load up on calls here.
15 min. passed with 48Mn volume....party's not even started...yet...
yeah boyyyyy!!!!! broke 27
"Amazing how some pumpers on this board are constantly talking through their sphincter about what’s going to happen with this stock. HOD at the close! 50 by next week! 1000 in three years! Yeesh. They annoy me almost as much as the shorts, and I own 15,000 shares."
This is going to the moon! 
"1,560,200 shares were purchased today via ARKW, not ARKK, confusing a lot of people, W is part of their five actively managed ETFs, soon to be six, with the space ARKX launching next month."
Picked up a couple hundred. I think we’re gonna head back up tomorrow
"All what PLTR talks about is long term strategy. In order to reinvest in PLTR, We need to see short term strategy that will generate revenue within the quarter. Investors want return on their money today, not in 5 years."
When this will hit 100-200 bucks i am going to become a palantir millionaire
Thanks Powell :(
$PLTR Sell if it get back to $30 $NIO sell if it get back to $50
I'm scared
..when the Reverse Split?..
Look at Balance Sheets! Cash grew $1.4b to $2.1b. 50% change from 2019.
Every thing is collapsing but PLTR is holding strong.
I guess I get to take a break from reassuring people in here. Take it away boys 
https://youtu.be/c8KkCfvLcy8
sold nio . made good profit . throwing it all in PLTR . LONGTERM HOLD !!
Palantir why you doing this
Always best to invest early in a monopoly. Palantir's pricing power will leave us in awe.
"Only buy and hold , same with calls buy calls only for one year at least"
"Just need one green day, so my wife won't divorce me pls"

I feel sorry for those who bought this for a quick buck. This is a long term stock.
"It's nice to have the function of a mute button. All these bots making claims, only a bought vessel of interest would make, needs to be put away.

It is hard to changing from bull to bear. I finally faced reality and sold yesterday @27. I will establish short position from today based on its actual performance instead of bubble dream. It will be under 20 soon.
LET ME SAY THIS WITH FAITH AND HOPE : TO THE MOON!!!!!!!

"This is an small excerpt from Cathie Wood’s interview on Jesus Calling podcast... very inspirational.. she goes into why she named it Ark Invest... but couldn’t copy it all here... “I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, “Okay, this is the plan.” And the idea was basically, “Look, you’ve been a student of disruptive innovation your entire career. Why don’t you disrupt your own industry? It’s broken. Why do you disrupt it with some of these new technologies? Why don’t you harness social media? Why don’t you invite people in—even your competitors—to brainstorm about these new ideas, to help spread the word?” And so I did that, and it’s been amazing. It’s so much better than anything that I could have possibly imagined. “"
"Waiting for 22. Sorry guys, price is to high to get in now with this market condition."
I hope ark didn't lighten up here

"PLTR - Guys look at call/put ratio of PLTR - its 3 times for calls-also heavily shorted. If we can push this at 27+, this will cause ripple effect like GME...PLTR can reach 75 today"
Long with over 500 shares...not worried about lock up expiry at all. It will move up even if it drops. Key is to be patient and hold and keep selling covered calls to make money along the way...easily $50 stock in the next quarter or so.
August $40 calls. LFG.
Those who sold their shares at $21
Covered calls to average down if you don't have funds.

I have been in Qeth.u from $18 and made $5k. I am going to sell all of it tomorrow to add to my 289 shares of Pltr. I want to retire with Pltr.
CREDIT SUISSE bought 6.3 million shares!
Market will come back after Powell calms inflation fears. Fed won’t do anything to disrupt recovery.
Basically somewhat bullish long term but concerned short term. If the numbers miss the mark at earnings release then watch out below. Current valuation of the company stands at $57 billion or so. They will barely squeeze out $1 billion in revenue this year. Pretty high PE. I hate the fact that they have 1.7 billion shares outstanding. Institutions only hold 13% of the stock. What is going to happen after the lock up expires next week? It could flood the market with people wanting to sell their shares which will drive the price down. Be careful out there! Don’t back the bus up just yet.
Up 6% in Berlin
Glad I got out of this at 25
Imagine buying APPL at 40Billion market cap. That?s PLTR right now. This is the best time you will have to buy pltr. 40% dip from last month. Covid crash lasted 1 month. It?s been a month of all tech correcting. Bears are #$%$ to short at this point. It?s time to buy.
This is a great company. Zip y'all up!
AMC has earnings coming up so that may drop back down for a nice entry but pltr earnings already lock already insiders sold already. So back up we go
I am just in @ 27.90 bought the dip yesterday! hodling for longterm #notselling
I'm hesitant to sell a few Apple stocks and strengthen Palantir. What do you think?
Imagine that on a Green Day Ramses disappears......
"Been patient since $9.45, go ahead and panic, I’ll go for a walk and ignore my portfolio for a week or two, let’s see who’s crying afterwards"
I love all the repetitive negative tone articles from yahoo...omg insiders sold some shares after waiting 17 years give me a break......
FINALLY some good news about PLTR! https://mobile.twitter.com/deitaone/status/1364183109818867713?s=21
It’s like TSLA for me. I got in before it started making profits and refused to sell any share. Until I discovered palantir. I shaved TSLA at 700/s and bought PLTR. I am comfortably retired from corporate job. Sitting on 60k PLTR shares and not selling.
Looking like a Green Day  !!
Time for a power hour rise?
monday i will beable to trade margins. im gonna hold it though!!! yin buying 750 more shares monday
Any chance this goes to $20
we need this 26.5 bois PUSH THROUGH
it will be above 80 $ within a year. make a note of this you shorts
If you sold or even had the thought cross your mind after seeing 2% in the red today you deserve to loose money. Do your DD & stop using yahoo message boards as your answer to sell or buy.
Two words. Cathie Wood.
"Verizon , ATI , Facebook , Tesla , Morgan the list goes on who will be using Palantir to get the edge"
"You buy the company not the stock, Palantir softwares will optimize time of decision making for every company and that's a game changer. Add on it, the most important innovations started in the governments especially in the defense sector and in intelligence sector. #BIGDATA#AI"
"AH 25.51, hope it will be a good day tomorrow."
BOOM !!
Its coming back to 38$
It’s holding so nicely even tho insiders are selling easy 30 next week
I brought in at 28.8 can only lower my cost basis now
Not planning to sell anytime soon! I double downed my long term options calls today. Originally had 5 contracts with expiration dates of 1/20/23 strike price $10. I bought on IPO. Today I sold two and bought 3 options contracts at $22C exp 6/17/22. I can’t wait to make bank! Also I am long on a PLTR. Bought 152 during the IPO and haven’t sold any
Take a look at new positions opening up at PLTR. Growing!!!!
"Investing in the company that gives the US Military, Federal Agencies, and top tier companies the edge is worth investigating. company of the future"
Why is it that shorts only come out of the woodwork during AH to run their mouths when the stock is red on very low volume? They weren't saying anything during active trading hours when we were green almost the entire day while every other stock was getting obliterated.
Hey Redditers! Let’s do short squeeze for a while and take PLTR to moon!
I’m eating my sandwich and drinking a cup of tea. Nothing to worry about longs! Who’s with me ?
yesterday was a gift .... thank you... so grateful....
"the shorts have left, the stock is basing meaning it is the time to buy NOT sell..........counterterrorism software in the world we live in with the stock price trading where it is today is a steal imo.....also; i will be watching sales ramp up as the sales team is ramped up (headcount)......"
you are missing the point. If insiders are selling 257 million shares of Palantir why should WE buy it???? Who da hell do they think we ARE?!
"I am a believer long term. I only have 600 shares so not a ton avg of 25.88. I have stuck with them all the way to 20 and back to where it is now. I just dont like seeing red on back to back days where the market is green, If it was red on a red market day no big deal. I dont want to, but really thinking about selling now and just do some other things until this has had a chance to consolidate some more."
"FK The 10-year Treasury yieldThis #$%$ has caused enough havoc to our beloved PLTR...I don't know about next week, but the stimulus package is the only good news coming next by Mar-14-2021Are we expecting MORE PAIN next week?"
Patience! My father always told me> Patience is a virtue! If you're patient you will win! we will see this over 30s in some weeks!And Next Q we will see this over 45!
"I held Aphria from the summer of 2018! I was down 75%......I actually did lose hope. I told my hubby, it may take 5 years to get our original investment back. We finally made out with a small profit last month. I can’t imagine PLTR will take 2.5 years to break even. Aphria was totally dead for months on end."

"you never know becasue with algo market can turn on a dime...pray PLTR to the moon with $tsla, and $nio! and $lmnd!!!! and $BFT!!!!! and $baba"
I have never seen a company this good drop so far so quickly on nothing but good news. I think this makes 12 red days and one Green Day over the past few weeks? How long can this go on?
Cathy Wood is going to be on CNBC Halftime in a little while to discuss her investments.
3000 shares @ $40... when am I gonna break even...
"Loving seeing some green in PM. LeTs goooooNiO $XPEV, $CCIV, $PLTR, $NNDM, $BNGO, $RIOT, $ACIC, $GWAC and $ARGO"
"If earning is met with good guidance + partnership, PLTR will be north of $40"
You can leave.
"MY TRUTH...I am long PLTR and I'm also a patient investor. I can with all honesty tell you that if I had been working at PLTR for several years I would definitely have sold 3% of my stock ... no problem. I bet if you look at the average age of Palantir employees they are raising young families. If that is true they have probably been planning their dream house in the Denver area for a while now or perhaps buying a few acres in CO to build a second home or dream house. Thats what I would be doing. How fun and rewarding after working so hard for so many years. I wouldn't wait for the price to go up more since I would have lots more shares I could cash in at a later date. It's all good if you are a long investor you are going to be rewarded but if you are super impatient and maybe a newer investor who wants instant gratification with HUGE rewards immediately ... you may just make yourself crazy. Good luck to all,KC"
This happened a few days/weeks ago but then reversed and closed green! Don’t sell!
"Thanks Pltr, You made me surfer ,I was scared yesterday when i bought at 25.02.. but i did, i believe in the company ...i hope we go up."
March 1-2 Vanguard bought 20 million shares of $PLTR.
My price target for this stock is 55$
"Can anyone link me to a bearish thesis, no idea why this had been suppressed for so long when valuations are always so high"
Will this thing hit $30 within 6 months? 
YOLO’d at 26.22
diluting share holders 10X times.
it's losing the hypeheading downward towards $20 ahead
Shorts fundamentals do not matter. Do you want to get caught in this stock if it does something like Rocket out of the blue. Highly shorted/ large option calls and big investors buying. Same pattern. Be carful just trying to help don’t like to see anyone lose money.
Let's not get nervous ladies. Buy on the dips and hold for five years. Don't deviate.
Ascending triangle forming. Huge upside soon
As soon as the next Gig is announced this will take off....
"Get PLTR below $26, and wait. Thank me by the end of April when you get +$52! (this is based on options activity which point to $64; let's be a bit conservative)"
"Price to sales of 50x for a company that hasn’t ever turned a profit in nearly two decades and in a crowded space  . This is their huckleberry . We do love watching a good train wreck, as long as we’re not on the train LOL"
wow someone is buying a bunch.... tomorrow should shoot up or maybe the day after tomorrow... did not see this type of steady control for a while.
"Bought in today at 23.50, think it will continue to climb tomorrow?"
Just doubled my shares
"Hey look, @CovertAction is wrong...again....should be used to it by now."
If we close above $25 today we should see $29 soon! Still holding my 2K. If we hold high $20+ this week we will trade above $30 by the end of the month.
"So PLTR, CCIV and CHPT are all trading sideways in AH. Couldn't be more coordinated."
Let’s close $25?
poppes 50 cents in the last 30 seconds of trade.
I felt absolutely gutted when I missed out on Tesla several years ago.Nope. Not this time. I've learnt my lesson. I'm looking at a winner. PLTR is a game changer and the future. I've been on this train since mid-December and I don't plan on getting off anytime soon.PLTR is my winner and my life-changing moment.
I keep saying follow the money.FOLLOW CATHIE WOOD and her best performance ETF's for the last 3 years.BUY BUY BUY THIS ROCKET IS GETTING READY FOR TAKE OFF

"PLTR Stock Price: $40 Target By JefferiesBy Amit Chowdhry ● February 12, 2021"
Let's get the party started in here again!!!
"AWS, what could be a better contract for PLTR?"
"Folks, this is a BUY especially at this price. PLTR is a long term investment stock NOT a quick make a few dollars stock.Be patience and those will be rewarded abundantly."
I’m glad he is in our side and isn’t scared . At all.
Great article on seeking alpha about potential Q4 2020 earnings
I see 2 big sellers one at 27.79 289000 shares and another 300000 shares at 27.80 i wanna know y ? This will be at 30 dollars end of week so y so big sellers???
This stock is so unpredictable. You know the secret? Just hold for years!
Monday is going to be a great day
"whoa, what was that sudden drop?"
Great day to average down!!
To those who think PLTR is over price for bringing billions dollar in revenue are the same people who bought CCIV at $50/share without even have a product in place. Mind blowing to me to even think about it.
"The investment opportunity in PLTR really is quite simple. Currently trading at a 45% discount from all time highs, you have the chance to get into a SaaS leader in a big time AI data space that isn't going to be regulated but is actually contractually partnered with allied governments. Logically speaking, in the future of business across all sectors, you either operate using AI or you get wiped out by competitors that do. So companies have the option of creating their own ai budget, hiring, training, implementing which takes TIME which is equal to dollars lost. Or, they install a software that is the leader and most advanced in the space they require to not only thrive but survive vs competition. The fact that people don't seem to understand base level logic is mind blowing. When multi billion dollar companies are up against it penny pinching as interest rates rise down the road and the economy becomes even more competitive, there's no longer two options there's only one. Take from this what you will but for those who understand business forget the numbers and media for a minute and just use you brain, simply, make a choice."
I have a honer
"Please Read - Facebook Contract - Let’s put this one to rest. Commercial contracts do NOT require announcements and often kept private unlike public sector contracts. People are reading tea leaves due to Facebook job postings and there have been MANY more large Enterprises that have Palantir experience in the job descriptions.I believe a relationship with Facebook is imminent. The threat for child exploitation, child trafficking, etc is real on FB and Palantir helps in this regard already with orgs specifically addressing this real threat in a growing virtual world.I also believe the relationship of Thiel with Facebook (Series A and Series C investor) helps the relationship come together. I expect THE SAME from the likes of Tesla (to take autonomous driving, robo taxis, etc) to the next level and continue to help Tesla outpace Chinese brands like Nio, Xpeng, etc. because after all, Palantir doesn’t get down with China.I also expect the same with SpaceX as flying people around will require extensive data analysis and predictive outcomes..I expect the same with PayPal as PayPal has gone heavy on Bitcoin and the managing/security of the dark web on Crypto will require policing and that’s right up the Palantir playbook. So sit tight my friends. But don’t get restless waiting for a Facebook announcement. Not all commercial contracts are public. So we may not ever see the relationship in bright lights but the revenue could come pouring in.All roads lead to Palantir. #notallthatisgoldglitters"
Well well. Let’s see what next week has to say
"I'm not surprise if we have a jump to $30 before Market close, that would be sweet!"
"Thumb up if you bought, are buying and will HOLD for at least 1 yr.Thumb down if speculating for short-term profit.I’m confidently holding for 2-5 yrs. 15k+ shares in so far."
going back to 20.18?
Karp is doing like Elon musk! He said the same words before tesla's rally
Recovery week for the market
"This cannot hold $ 25 when the market explodes and dreamers are delirious about $ 30, 45, 60.The direction is clear - below $ 20. It won't happen quickly, but it is inevitable."
going up! 
"5000 shares , will wait 6 months before selling, not sure how much it will be"
"$pltr was at $45 on Jan 27th, lost more than 50% in less than 30 days. $pltr got hit since executives sold very few number of stocks when comparing 1.5 billions of outstanding stocks. Will be suiting moon soon when the market recovers."
Who thinks PLTR will hit 75-100 EOY?
this will be 30+ next week
Buy order in for 26.50 PM
"26.20, Like I've said a few times here, is a point of resistance. We will break that, and find support at 26.40 ish"
PLTR... just sit back and enjoy the ride... cashishhhhhh
Could we see a $50 on monday?
"If you liked Palantir at $32, you should love it at $22. (Think long.)"
PLTR on Fast Money ! They claim we got a boost from Reddit. Frankly I don't care where the boost comes from as long as we get $ 45 next week.
People that bought in the 30’s & 40’s we are coming to get you! No brothers & sisters left behind!!! Lets get it!
"Anyone see Cramer's BS this morning, he really bashed Kathie Wood and one comment was ""who will she rescue today"" The same Cramer that called oil un investable a couple of months ago which is now up 50% or more."
"Well... I will just forget about this money! And just accept that I lost 45k.... And never invest again...Nahhhhh, all in again!"
"Forgot to factor in that Monday NYSE was closed... So, since the earning details are going to be released prior to tomorrow's opening, is there anywhere where I can still purchase stock at Friday's closing price? Already own PLTR, but would like to load some more (from Europe)..."
holding strong at 25..no more selloff
"Dont mind me, I'm just holding bags strong at $29..."
Let's get this to 30$ today...I'm buy 500 more. Glta
NAZ down 210 buying opportunity
With the end of the fake pandemic and positive earning from strong companies the Market will turn positive. Hold on this Bull-run is not over.
30 by eod
"People who bought at $40s or high 30s, we are coming for you!"
Someone yesterday on here said it will close at 24.5 to wipe out calls and puts. Looking likely
All good. There is no way but upwards yesterday drop was by all mean manipulative. Next week am buying 500 more shares as my cash is on the way.
"guys lock up expiry coming on Thursday, we may see further drop in pricing, that's nothing to worry about, the the opportunity to buy in the dip like Ark investment did yesterday , this stock will go back to over $40 in the next few weeks. I am in at $26 and if it drops below that price I'll be buying more"
I just opened up a ROTH IRA that allows me to buy stock and I’ll be buying more PLTR so today’s price action actually works for me.
The trillion stimulus will inflate prices and interest rates. The market reaction today won't be sustainable for loss making companies like PLTR that lost -2B $ the last 3 years.
I’ll buy in at $15 CAD
34++ this coming Monday.
"I remember, a week back when I mentioned about $BANT, people started questioning. Whoever followed that advice, they can justify my comment.Happy trading!!!"
10 year 1.606 and rising.
Mute spamming all gif posting 
"I love how people are in here for short term gains. If you want stupid risky investments go to crypto or GME. Palantir is the next Google sized company, it won't happen overnight."
I considering selling off some other and going full in this . the other stocks are high this has a lot of growth ahead.
You are dreamers $20 this is never going to happen next week 30+ guarantee
need to lower my average Today . what does everyone think a good low today is ? im thinking 27.50?
100 dollars here we come
Jefferies’ analyst: “ Strong beat....long term outlook....implied 30% growth next several years”
"Funny how bashers came out of the woodwork to run their mouths now that we've finally seen a red day after several consecutive green days. A dip like this was a gift to anyone who has been wanting to get in on this stock, and also a gift for existing shareholders who bought more discounted shares. Soon we'll be leaving the $30s range and never coming back, just as we did to the $10s range and $20s range."
Bought in at $15 & I really don’t wanna get out yet....
"SNOW is just chilling at $250, had a jump scare. 70 Billion. Palantir is worth no less than 70 Billion at today's sale price of 44 Billion. $9-10 was such a gift. Thank Thiel for using the DPO model."
I am looking to buy if it drops below $23.00 tomorrow - the employees & insiders can sell their shares.
Even MeetKevin bought a lot of PLTR based on his video yesterday..
Don’t fall for propaganda
For me any tickers are numbers. $pltr trades more than any other stocks in the similar market value that attracted me. hopefully it will cross 30 when all the dust settle.
Seems like the sell it's over!
Prediction EOD 27.03
"PLTR is a long term play for the astute and patient investor. Buying under $30 should pay off handsomely down the road. Not expecting to see $40 quickly as some posters have posited. Rather, a slower climb to, say, $50 by year end. JMHO, but $100 is in our future. Just not this year or next. Finally, ignore any marginal drops in the pps. Remember, there are investors who bought PLTR around $10 not that long ago and have seen their investment triple. Gonna be some profit taking, and that's to be expected. GLTA. This is a winner."
The vast majority of people here does not understand Palantir’s future and thus don’t deserve the long term rewards
"I have a feeling that barring unforeseen events, we’ve already hit bottom. This is not saying the stock will suddenly rebound, but looking at the 1 month chart it looks like the drop is behind us and the stocks is just beginning to rise."
"So it’s down a little after hours for no good reason, other than the market itself is down some more. People never learn."

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest adds 3.4 million Palantir shareshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3667503-cathie-woods-ark-invest-adds-34-million-palantir-shares?utm_source=webull.com&utm_medium=referral
I found this a good buy at $31. Now it’s even better!!!
I had few shares of small AI company $VERI. Saw price going from 1.50 to 50 in a year.Where will be $PLTR from here in next one year? .... 200+ ???
wow strong on a red day. this reminds me when this stock was trading at $10. stayed in green while market was red and as soon as market turned green $pltr exploded. let see if history repeats again. holding at $27 avg.
We just need new contract release
"Oh brother, Wall Street Bets has picked PLTR as their new focus. I mean great I guess. But if you watch what happened to everything else they focused on it soared and then crashed like a rock. So we should be on our toes watching this thing the next few weeks."
"Big King Karp isn’t looking at the stock price day in day out, nor should you. Buy the dips buy the highs, just own the stock and HOLD. Karp and his team will make our pockets heavier and heavier throughout the years"
Is there really no end of the nasdaq crashing..
"Some Palantirians are spooked by the news that ""investment guru"" Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold off all of his PLTR holdings in 2020-Q4. Well, that means that he cashed out under the $30 level and missed the bull run to $45 on January 27. According to news reports, Facebook (FB) is one of his top holdings. Well, FB has lost 15% in value over the last six months, falling from its all-time high of $304.67 on Aug 26, 2020, to today's intraday low of $258.44. So he missed a >50% profit on PLTR while staying long on potentially a ≤ 15% loss on FB. That's one guru who might be in need of some further meditation."
$30 is in our near future
Welcome aboard wallstreetbets. Crushing shorty dreams. Love to see it.
"I am recommending all website publisher and software certification providers should partner with PLTR to create greater security authentication and stop malicious intrusion, malware and eventually hacking and/or fake news."
I do have some curiosity with 1 billion shares outstanding if Palantir will ever do share buybacks down the road.
hi
"Friends, I'm in a very difficult situation. Let's call for reddite together."
It was just $29.50 minutes agoDropped $1.30 I have to get on a broker who trades at 4am
Initiated a position today because of Cathy wood long term approach
"Glad I got in at 9.20 first and have a 10 average. Don't care at all about these small price swings. If you are long, you probably shouldn't either."
Cathie is going to make Pltr her top holding
"What's everyone 3/6 month goal on this hyper growth stock, I'm calling 40/50 again."
Thiel sold 20million shares when the lock-up ended...this is why the stock is down so much
Anyone see the CNBC ? What was said?
The robot knows all! PLTR is going to be epic!!
"Fair warning, I am buying this morning. It may dip further."
I don’t know if I’m glad or upset that this stock no longer moves with the meme stocks
I think this is headed higher sooner than you think
not a bad place to buy
Who held and remained long all the way from 45 until now?
Sell now and buy under $20.Who's with me?

"Holding tight since Oct, entertaining profitable ride. PLTR is like finding a franchise quarterback don't trade him (Houston)"
"Be prepared to suffer like Tesla did. But we make money, Tesla had a decade of promises and market share gains from the big three automakers. Like Thiel said. Zero to One, we don't compete, we own the market. Palantir is the next Palantir."
Funny saw that Cramer questioning Lady Cathy buying PLTR but now I saw in a interview that he was now saying that she is the greatest investor of our time and she has a plan like no other! Stay with Cathy and your a winner not to mention all news sources are saying the PLTR has years of potential for great gains.
They will reorder FAANG.
It will recover. Btw like the $AMC
That was tough. Still holding.
Any outlook after the lockup expires on 2/19?
PLTR is limitless. Let's go
When the short squeez begins...
Green is good.
"So, is today another 2% DOWN?"
finishes the day 25.50
Palantir will rise up to 60$ In 2-3 week
Sadly this will be a 10 dollar stock soon. Insiders sold off. Enough said.
Incredible hold at $25!!!!!
Whos with the diamond hand still? Im still holding 668 shares @ 10.45. aint selling a share till this reach 100.
"We had a solid week to buy in cheap.Congratulations to all those who did, time to go GREEN."
From Russia to America we bought 500k shares with my team
"They were just waiting to be unlocked to sell. They waited impatiently .... And they flooded the market with their shares, not caring about small investors. It will be dead money. This company will negatively affect the history of the US stock market."
Stay strong guys. This is only temporary 
"Where are the longs?!?! Where are the longs?!?! We're here, loading up!!"
Thank you Auntie Cathie for loading up 12 million shares last week. A triple on the way for this ticker!
$50 ies here we come
This thing can not get out of its own way. Where are the gurus that loved this at $30 plus.
"Question. - are there going to be, that anyone knows of, any more lock up periods hidden out there ? it looks like the shares have found a home - IT LOOKS LIKE.. as yesterday was the first day i saw the volume going back to nominal.. thanks"
If I remember correctly 2/18 $25 Cathie loaded that day and we jump to $29 next day. Let’s see some $28-$29 mo day.
"This is the PLTR I know. What are we closing at 28, 29."
Alex Karp is a GREAT American
"Against all odd Mama bear Cathy wood gives confidence to brothers/ sisters robinhood, Wall Street bet army Reddit marching Palantir to the mountain top, thank you Mama bear"
"Don't worry about the 10-year treasury rate. There's a growing consensus that the Fed will implement a ""Yield Curve Control"" in the near future. Will likely come up at their March meeting. FED YIELD CURVE CONTROL WILL DRIVE THE US DOLLAR LOWER AND VALUATIONS OF GROWTH STOCKS HIGHER"
going to the gym!!!
This will be over 30$ by the end of the week said no one ever. Where did the buyers disappear to?
Well this is either a good entry point for people to start getting in or to get close to doubling down how much more downside is I have no idea but it looks like he can go lower but PLTR is a good company is going nowhere has a lot of potential for upside for the long term looks like I will start by in a little while and see where it goes from there￼￼
What a joke. Stocks from + 10-20% gain became a 1-3% gain at 9am. $pltr $nndm $gevo $bngo $tsla this is pure manipulation
"And now out of blue moon al analysts and columns vouching for palantir, what changed overnight"
Im loading up today. This boat is leaving.
Y’all ever see minority report? Not even possible without PLTR technologies
Doubled my humble position at $26
Can someone provide insight on the high stock based compensation?
Nothing wrong with this company. Not going bankrupt. Maybe just a little ahead of its' time on valuation
"People are being too emotional and are overreacting. I started buying the dip at $23, and Im planning on adding more if the price drops even further."
Way oversold.
I will sell at $600.00
"As an IT guy now retired I watched Palantir's demo day and I have to say their products are truly game changers in the world of Digital Transformation and Big Data. The future IT landscape will be all about Digital Transformation along with Software as a Service as it relates to Big Data, AI and Internet of Things. Palantir is clearly going to be a major player (and already is per the contracts they are signing on a weekly basis).In the spirit of full disclosure, I have a fairly large position of PLTR and I'm very confident this company will grow exponentially over the next 4-8-12 qtrs! The world truly is their oyster and as all leading companies, globally, in any sector will gravitate to Digital Transformation (in a much larger scale), just to remain competitive, if nothing else!I recommend people due their own DD and watch the Demo Day and listen to what their products can do and are already doing after 15 years of development and continued fine tuning of their core products.https://vimeo.com/488141017"

Now that the Commie Soros is out of this stock it has a chance to go way up. looking for 75 by summer.
We’ve gone from 54th on ARKW holding size back when pltr was at ATH. And we’re now at 18th largest holding. While the price has dropped one of the best growth stock investors on the planet RAN towards the fire and has quickly made this one of her largest holdings. Adding where I can.
"The corporate narrative is building: ""Adopt Bitcoin or become irrelevant"". Just the beginning. We'll hear and see much more of this in the coming days, months, years. Expect largess moves in $BTC $GBTC when Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. announce their inclusion and investment. The genie is out of the bottle...has been for a while now, but you keep telling yourself that you're too late. I used to think that way too. Don't wait too long before you start nibbling on the $GBTC. Also gotta give a shout out to $RKT... the most undervalued stock in the market...and $PLTR my future 10 bagger which reports before the bell on Tuesday. Nice set up going into the print. Most stocks seem to be priced for perfection these days. With the recent pullback, Palantir could lay an egg on Tuesday and it'd still be grossly undervalued."
"Heck I bought More $qs, $sq, $pvh, $amd, $pltr, $msft, $tsla, and $gm, $pypl and $cpng....I spent $56,786 today. All out of cash now except for mortgage and utilities.Good luck, will be cashing in Friday or Monday as soon as they go up!Sowing now for reaping the crops!!!!!!"

"If this does go green today, it'll be a lightning quick move."
"Dropping 3-4 percent is PLTR style, it is not too hard to realize, people just do not want to accept reality."
"When the market recovers so will stocks. In the mean time buy the dips or hold & enjoy life. Not stressing about a few bucks here & there. It's short lived, April should see a recoveryWall Street is running the show!"
really wish i have the cash to buy the dip.. FML

"Ladies and Gentlemen,We are now climbing to a $30 cruising altitude...Please fasten your seatbelts, no selling is allowed, and thank you for flying PLTR airlines..."
This is the future. Investing in palantir today is like investing in Tesla in 2019.
I can only say this; deep roots are not reached by the frost ...
PLTR looks pretty strong than other stocks today. Everything is red...
Ark is loading....

"ark bought another 3million on Friday Cathie sold 551,000 apple shares 77,711 Facebook shears so with a bit of look we will see low 30 over the next 3 weeks"
Cathie Woods bought 3 MILLION shares of Palantir today!!
Tomorrow!!!
How many of you wished you could buy at $25 when the share price was $45? Well this is the time !!
Peter Thiel disclosed he sold over 20 million shares of Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) on 02/18 through a 10b5-1 trading plan as a lock-up expired. Thiel is the Chairman of the Board and one of the founders of the company. Shares were sold at prices from ~$25.06-$25.93 per share.
I fully expect a rotation back into tech in the next week or so. Not worried.
"If we close above $25.50 today, we will see $28 tomorrow."
the founder cashed out all his shRes..its long term so will buy it back when they actually make money while he invests it elsewhere
Recovery from yesterday starts now let’s make some money!
"Jobs adverts at apple, Facebook, Verizon & AT&T looking for Palantir experience. Speculation at this time. Something could be announced "

Went from 576 to 616 shares. Happy to own each of them ;) Go PLTR Go! ;)
Powell reassured rates werent changing in the foreseeable future. Markets regained confidence. and NOW we rise.
If +3% on a day like today in the markets doesn't show strong investor sentiment i don't know what does. This is going higher
"Can't see how there isn't 100%+ in Acquire phase customers for Q1 Earnings call..... IBM says 100/150 AI customers alone are on PLTR so that should be 100%+ Expand phase growth....I'm taking the OVER for Scale phase growth.....under promise, over deliver...."
"Palantir never disappoints...shorts, that is."
wish I had some cash to buy the dip. Pltr is a long term stock
Yuge volume way above daily average already.
Green today.
"Pleas, $25. Pleas..lol"

Nice to see 6 mil+ AH......too the moon in the morning.
"Storm before the dawn. Senate stimulus (done deal but fear milked to the max), 10 year Bond rate increase (nothing burger JPow downplayed it, Bears gaslighting of course calling him dovish again)Options Calls wipeout game is being played out. Shorts can't hold forever, but are fighting for Friday."
"There are other ways to make money. If you catch a leprechaun, he'll give you a pot 'o gold!Also, there's a pot 'o gold at the end of the rainbow. You just have to look for it."
"karp should keep talking.. soon ill be a short. actually, next time he says he is going to speak time to buy some near term putsthats the trick."
"Gl All technical and historical data show a move upward is due. Also, This is the fifth down day in a row historically has five down days it has a huge bounce on the sixth. If I was a betting man, and I am, and if I have any money, which I don't ha ha, I would back up the truck right now. I had to put money on it, I would say this thing is going to explode tomorrow! JMHO"
26% increase in shorts. Here comes the squeeze! All over WSB
I've got 100 contracts of pltr $30 calls expiring 4/1. paid $1.01 each. trying to decide if I want to cut my losses or hope this pops big time in the next two weeks.
"The ARK Funds just purchased three million more shares tonight, hence the jump!"
this is the safest bet in town.. geez.. good job palantir
can anyone tell me when the earnings is scheduled? thanks
under $20 by Friday
Elton where are you?We need help here!
Just rocket past $50 and get it over with.Sheesh...
Based on the interview they should go back to being a private company. As Cathy wood stated. This is a long term hold.
this is even good on a all red day. that is how you know it's a great investment
Is it good time to get in or missed the train ):
Pltr founder just on CNBC
The patient will prosper in the stock market 9/10 times vs those who panic at every 1-2 week downturn Relax.
palantir ceo to be on cnbs this afternoon at 3 pm
"This is not a PLTR issue. This is a tech issue as a whole.Not only will I NOT sell, I will buy this dip as I have bought the other dips.These same “experts” will be nowhere to be found later. I’ve been preaching patience and I will CONTINUE to preach patience.Put your portfolio away for the next week or so and HOLD. This is where panic will cost you! When they panic YOU HOLD"
According to Fíntel there’s a 14% Short Interest. I can’t wait to see the squeeze from this alongside the ARK push. Come on 9:30!
"COUP, FB, CRM, and many others took several qtrs before moving up. PLTR went from $9 to $25 in 120 days. This company will grow over 40% rev per year. It will get to a stock price which will make those who showed patience very happy."
"Lots of shorties in here. They might just win. But at the end of the day, this will continue to climb long term."
You can see above 30 within this week. Big boys are buying your shares.
No doubt PLTR will trade $35+ soon. Some hiccups due to insiders trading which is normal as they have been waiting for years!
have 20k shares Palantir. thinking about doubling that at current levels for long term. tjoughts
"Don’t let a short term emotional low dictate your long term positions.Take it from somebody that’s made that mistake before. This looks really rough and many of us in tech are hurting badly since feb 9th, but patience is still the most important aspect of success in the stock market.Don’t let a 3 week period of red determine your portfolios growth over the next 5 years. Get off the phone and let it run it’s course"
Very bad moods on Ark funds boards. Lots of people plan to sell to protect their profits.
Did karp #$%$ off shorties? ?
This is the next Tesla
"Shorters must be thinking all longs bought above $30 and they're happy thinking we're loosing money, but they forget we bought under $20 and we take this as a discount."
"the whole market is falling, not just palantir... Just be patient. If you're looking for a short term gain, that is not investing, it's a gamble"
Where do you think we'll end the day today? Above $26.5?
"For everyone complaining about the price not hitting a certain price point. You need to think about why you bought into PLTR in the first place. Was it for a swing trade? Then you're going to be disappointed often. If you're a long trader, you won't care about the ups and downs. All you have to believe is that PLTR will pull through"
Take advantage of these prices while they are here PLTR longs there will be huge institutional buying over the next few weeks. The 20s will be history. These prices are dirt cheap. This is going back to the highs and eventually much higher than that. You will thank me soon enough.
I'm down 16%
it is a great chance to get in while it is under 30 $
"I've had 3 people tell me to buy this stock. When I ask them to describe the business model, who the competition is, and what the market size potential is.....NONE of them could tell me! All they say is Peter Thiel is one of the founders, and that I should buy it because he co-founded PayPal. Consensus EPS is 16 cents this year and only 21 cents next year. Consensus price target for next 12 months is $25.83. Only 1 of the professional analysts assigned to cover this stock say it's a ""buy."" Are the robinhooder's and reddit users propping this thing up? Options offer very attractive premiums for selling PLTR covered calls, which I think is the way to go if you are going to speculate with this stock at current price level of $26.92."
I am in buying at the bottom now
12M premarket volume
"I'm just a student with almost 50 shares, but I'm proud to be able to invest in this company. Palantir is the future and is gonna be a giant in the tech sector. Get in while you still can or go home."
Happy to say I bought yesterday
No complaints.
Disappointing day.. onwards and upwards!
Long term goodie! Great company it will transform me to Superman. Today I'm more like the Michelin hubba bubba man.
Literally no gains when market was up but PLUMMETS HARD when market falls
What’s this Implied Volatility stuff all about?
Don't mind seeing a little red. Used to see it on my schoolwork all the time and I turned out just fine. So will Palantir.
Toooo the moon!! lets go back go to the 30's next week
"Powerful softwares, powerful company, powerful connection with government agencies, Powerful stock price10 x in less than 5 years"
That was rough boys
buy on the dips 
"Emotional highs/lows & impatience will lose you money 99/100 times.Been preaching it in regards to PLTR since the DPO.This is not the stock to buy if you want to quadruple your investment in 5 months. It IS the investment to hold if you want to 5-10x your investment in 2-5 years.Relax and accept the short term volatility for what it is, comes with the territory lol.I saw the same bashing, from different bashers, as it climbed from $10-20, 20-30, etc."

"Institutional Ownership WAAAY UP from previous quarter. Hmmm, follow some  on a discussion board who doesn’t even own shares or follow the smart people who have invested billions? That’s the bottom line people."
"bought at 38 now i need an exit plan,"
+5%b ah?
Keep an eye on these indicators:1. Bank stocks are down2. Airline stocks are down3. Oil stocks are down4. Nasdaq is up5. ROTATION is starting...Happy investing tips...
"My current stocks: 1) Apple 2) SNAP 3) VIAC 4) Palantir 5) Draft Kings. You have to be patient with stocks and ignore the noise. Jim Cramer held VIAC and sold last year, because he did not see the future. He lost out on astronomical run in the stock, I held and made a fortune. Jim Cramer blasted SNAP a few years ago and said it would never do anything. I purchased a ton of SNAP in the early teens and it has gone crazy. Jim Cramer does not like Palantir, but I loaded the boat! Jim Cramer is like the Dr, Fauci of recommendations. He is right 50% of the time, I have lost $ on one stock in my life, Trans Ocean."
It warms my heart to know the SHORTS lost another 2 billion dollars on GAMESTOP. Just add that to the over 70 billion they’ve lost already. Long and patience wins the race.
"What Is Quadruple Witching?Quadruple witching refers to a date on which stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously.

"looks like month long cup forming, probably going to bounce off 45 again before rocketing past 50 on Demo day 2 (April 14) for the handle"
"Once huge businesses like FB, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Ford, Tesla, etc are announced.....  Holding 2500 shares strong and riding this baby until I’m rich!"
"It's holding up pretty well for the red market sell off today, we're approaching oversold... great buying opportunity... buy into weakness...."
Nice day. Congratz longs...
"Forwarded as received from one Reddit memberAll of Palantir?s (weekly) blockbuster deals/contracts/partnership are being downplayed by financial media.Disclaimer: This isn?t DD nor is it financial advice. This post is for educational purposes only. My views are my own. Let?s talk about Japan, a notoriously a difficult market to enter for a slew of reasons. Successfully entering the Japanese market in any capacity is a big deal, especially for a western company. This has been completely buried by the financial media as we continue to see minimal positive coverage of Palantir. Once the Japanese market starts bearing fruit for Palantir the implications are huge. Rio Tinto, a mining giant recently signed a ?significant? multiyear agreement to license its Foundry analytics platform for mining. Again, the trend we?re seeing in the financial media is to downplay these big deals. Mining is extremely competitive, if one company adopts a tech that can save money or affect the bottom line others will have no choice but to line up. In a [press release](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-license-deal-mining-gian-rio-tinto-51611847014) Rio Tinto said that the deal ?is an important step in our digital transformation; enabling fast-paced, forward-looking decision making across our operations leading to improved results in safety, cost and production.?A giant, in the mining industry is using Palantir to digitally transform their business. The language is important. We?ve been hearing about digital transformation for years but all that?s meant for most is switching retail sales to online sales. Palantir is truly transforming the digital world. By taking data (which company?s usually have in droves and do almost nothing with) and turning it into a tool to increase productivity, efficiency and safety has major implications, not just for mining but for every company. Palantir seems to have found the new gold rush and they?re the only game in town. The latest partnership with IBM is yet another blockbuster announcement that?s been totally downplayed IBM is [fortune 50 company](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2020/search/), ranked 38th. For some perspective Disney is 49th and Facebook is 46th. But we?re not talking about IBMs achievements I?m getting at IBM?s gigantic customer base. IBM?s customer base include governments all around the world and even more impressively, the entire Fortune 500. As a partner Palantir now has a direct line to companies like Walmart, Amazon, Exxon, Apple etc etc. To say the implications here are massive may be an understatement. Just a quick factoid, Apple had to partner with IBM to fuel its enterprise growth, and their partnership did just that. What I believe is the most downplayed of all of this is the fact that Palantir is a downright monopoly. Right now we?re hearing that the market doesn?t know exactly what Palantir does or how to price it. This is typical #$%$ from Wall Street. Don?t these guys make billions of dollars from assimilating information like this before anyone else? If demo day showed us anything it?s that no company can currently do what Palantir does. In Theils own words Palantir is truly a 0 to 1 company, not a 1+. When I see Palantir through an objective lens and not Wall Street?s I can safely assume that Palantir, a monopoly, can achieve a 1 trillion dollar ($500 SP) market cap and above. With the explosive deals coming in weekly that would seem sooner rather than later. A couple of months ago I thought a 10 year timeline may have brought Palantir close to that number but I wasn?t factoring in some key statistics. The main one that I don?t exactly know how quickly a monopoly can grow. And that monopolies that were around back in the day didn?t have such a big market. I don?t think industries were as big as they are now with completely new sectors that have emerged since then. $1T MC was just an idea in the 80?s and 90?s. Now we have a handful of companies with trillion dollar market caps. Apple?s is 2.2 trillion while Microsoft is closing in on 2 trillion. With Palantir being a monopoly, inflation, and world trade opened to its fullest capacity I think Palantir achieving a $1 trillion market cap could be sooner than I initially thought."
This is pain
This will also rise with Bitcoin seeing they use Cryptocurrency for ROBUX$$$$$
"Such a big day in the market but as luck would have it, I had one of the stocks that did not go up at all. Sold out of it and now put all in here at 24.80. What comes first, 20 or 29? I hope for the latter obviously."
I add 2000 .$29.98
PLTR investors will make a few pennies today. Management will make MILLIONS!!!
It’s evident PLTR is head on with shorters
We’ll be back in the 30’s by next week.
26.80 is next resistance
My only winner today... love you palantir
"the manipulators will rap this one more time on Monday, to frustrate,then higher and higher like Jackie Wilson sings."
What will PLTR do with so much cash each quarter? Imagine buying back shared will be an option.
$0.30-$0.35 that’s all I’m asking for in the next hour to close above $27.
Ark! Likes! PLTR!!
The Guidance this year is 45% growth !! This is a phenomenal growth and this could bring profitability!!
"I heard on cnbc(?) that Ferari used pltr’s commercial software to reduce a decision process from 20 seconds to 3 seconds. An 85% reduction on a process important enough to put through this process. If they could use this to reduce vehicle handling, accident avoidance or fuel mixtures, etc they’d have real break throughs for their 458 Italia or 488 GTB.BOOM, Another $100k per car!"
The sharks push down the price before the demo day . So that they buy cheap . After the demo day the price is driven up . Don’t u guys see how the game is played ???
Bought 90 shares @24.43
"Lock up is over, and it is green!"
Imagine if we ended green today after all this 
"When will impatient “investors” learn, this is how the big boys make their profits .They count on your weak hands and lack of confidence to ride out a little month or two of red..Told ya"
CNBC is beginning a counter narrative against Cathie Wood. Just because of Palantir shares. Never a problem with buying $685 TSLA shares eh Goldman Sachs? (A huge position in it)
I see short squeeeeezeee this week.
when ARK start selling PLTR. then we know it's the bottom.
"This is going to be a very positive week, $100 before end of year maybe higher."
the boogeyman is inflation...we overcame.covid and nownworried about paying a few more bucks for stuff..all the money we lost isnsure to aid in deflation
Someone just grabbed 285k shares @28.80? who could it be?
Going to dump 10k tomorrow for long term. good luck
did anyone take a look at April options call? something big is coming in
PLTR might be back to $30’s tomorrow.
Scoopin some more shares today at market open let’s go. The best stock in my portfolio.
Grabage.. in 17 years this co have only 125 clients.. and debt.
"Yeah, this thing PLTR is beginning to boil. The MACD crossover, Williams%R, & HugeCall interest in the 30,32,35,40 Calls. It's getting interesting."
"Hey, be aware you might get 12 out of 15 days of red. Trade with caution. This is now called ""money management""."
"Okay Palantir, your turn to shine..."
Nothing new here $24.6 base
Will it reach 30. End of week
"Hahaha just quickly read through the comments, are people #$%$ off with a 6% increase, that's boss."
Picked up another 39 @ $27 Now 289 shares @ $26.20 I am happy. Wish I can accumulate 500
Why are we up? No news?
"Personally I hope this goes to triple digits in 2021. However, I think we're going to test the March 8th lows for all of these high growth stocks."
GOOOOO so my call don't expire worthless lol
This stock is waiting on me to sell some before it explodes. That's the way it works.
"this is strong growth stock, keep adding more!"
I think the stock performed great over the last 2 days!! Other companies down 20 to 40 percent!! Show investors are accumulating even on pullbacks with insider selling!!
"It's painful but I'm with Karp for the long term. As an accountant, I am delighted to know that most of the Q4 losses are related to stock compensation and not the actual cash expenditures. AS many have said, PLTR trimmed the loss from 25+ cents/sh to merely 8 cents/sh is a huge improvement."
Scared money dont make no money
NASDAQ just broke down the 50dma! So tomorrow nasdaq might go down further.
I bought FB shares when it dropped to $19 long time ago. I totally regretted selling too early at $59 with 300% return at that time. I am not going to repeat my mistake again.
well I guess I'll trust Cathie Woods and hold this for a few years. I wonder what 100 shares of Tesla @ ipo prices is worth now.
Just found out that my 19 yo nephew bought pltr today. So proud of him!!!
Good interview. The only frustration is you have to be an engineer to work there. Other than this the modular business model is common sense and they do it. We’re in good hands in terms of investment.
Cathy Wood could?
Like stone...down
"Load UP as you can’t win if not in it. The worst thing can happen is wasting some time but the upside potential is massive. From SPAC to Karl’s comment, Palantir is good for retail investors like us. US and allies will use Palantir and keep on using. No one can compete at this level of big data analytics. In 6 months, you will be bragging you got in below 25."
In since IPO baby!!! @10.60 Who's wit me!?!?
people want to buy the opening...they want to...all fed needs to do is not throw us another curve ball and not be confusing or conditional..just say it or be clear about it not say that they will say..just say rate hikes coming gradual.moves maybe once in 9 months and then based on need and be done with it
Thumbs up if you bought the dip!!!
"""We're proud to team up with AWS across sectors. Learn about Palantir's ERP Suite, optimized to run on AWS."" I thought this was the big fish PLTR was waiting for. But the stock went down. A lot. What gives? Why aren't we at $50 on this announcement?"
"From 2012: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 percent on Wednesday, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.“While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides.”Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebook’s May initial public offering.The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921-million-share “float” available for trading on the market until now.“We’ve seen this before with other lockups. People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring, and then they have a bit of a relief rally,” said Ryan Jacob, chief executive of the Jacob Funds, which does not own Facebook shares.In August, shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 percent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired. That stock’s rally was boosted as short-sellers scrambled to cover their positions when the expected flood of selling failed to materialize, say analysts."
Vanguard bought 6.5 Million shares today.
Just added 100 more shares on my way to 1K shares
"Last day of sell off:Its great opportunity buy more of these shares STRONG BUY : #NIO, #PLTR, #TTCF, #GHVI, #GSAT, #INUV, #SNDL, #VBIV, #SFT"
"curious, what's everyone's average?"
Finally got to 2000 shares. Started 1000 @ $9 and continued to add on the dips. I will now hold these for years.
SHORTS GETTING SMOKED TODAY
PLTR is a 100+ stock!
"Cathie bought 2 million shares yesterday of pltr you tell me she doesn’t know something, big news to hit this stock soon and it’s going going to mother of all moved I bet we get to $30 by next Friday"
Like those $30 calls.....
remember when 25 was rock bottom.
Yummi
Market is ripping today bulls! It’s really ripping and we might not even see a dip at the open since we got hit hard with a 50% drop last 10 days! If you wanna buy PLTR it’s a great time to load up now! This stock was almost 50$ You buying at a huge discount now! Even Cathie wood when she first loaded up she bought in the 29$ range.
The only way is up
Shorts getting squeezed
"What happened sleepy jo said he has a plan , that’s his plan destroying economy"
why is everyone obsessed with the lockup...if you had shares and knew the potential of PLTR would you be selling now? I expect mgmt to give a glowing outlook.
$22.50 strong support
Everyone have to step back and see what the market and PLTR really is. The market is going to bear territory. Been there since the dotcom days. You may see 10-15 continuous days of selloff so you should hold off on the buying because you will soon run out of money. Hold on to your money and wait for a rebound of 2-3 days of green. You may miss the bottom but it is ok since this is a money management game.PLTR investors will continue to sell their shares and dilute the float because many of them got the shares for free. It may be better to wait.GLTAL
Hope all the longs are doing great today! God bless America!!
"So, every time it is down a smidgen all of these 'told you so' shorts are our quacking about how right they are....but we heard zero from them when it ran from $9 to $45...and, yes it is in the mid-20s now....and? When you got in at $9 all of this silliness is just sour grapes for the losers who have no stones..."
Still needs to go lower to buy in. Under 25.00 is the key....Longs don't worry. it is only business!!!!!
You’re watching a leader....
"I was working out yesterday when PLTR dipped 14%. I thought I may hang around those levels for a little bit seeing how brutal things were the last 2 weeks. When I got to my computer to execute the buying, it was only down 4% and did not go down from there. I was soo mad...PS- I already own a ton at $24.18 average. Would have been great to get some around $22."
when this hits 80$ do i take it out and buy my mortgage or hold and rent? O.o
buy this and live it for 5 years..
Its holding today because people see the value of the stock we all know this is a good long term play big tech company's are not going to compete whit PLTR there going to hire them for there services this is only the start. If you short all value the big traders like Warren Buffet so much look at snowflake its trading at like 100 PE ratio for PLTR that would mean around a 65 dollar price target. This is why its like a bargain right now in a couple years.GL to all people who are short we cant stop you but advise to not.
"George Soros, has publicly signaled his plans to exit. There could be some more volatility this afternoon."

"If your investment horizon is 5years, keep buying...if you are trader, only I can say is that high rates could bring it down to a lower evaluation or overall market selloff...I have invested in Palantir as a part of my retirement portfolio and I will be adding more...."
60 dollars in 3 months
"Shorts are really playing with fire, this have huge support around the 22-23$ while this can break out anyday shorts should really consider their risk to reward ratio here."
Futures down 3.5 points. Lol. Real newbies on this board.
i want this to fall a little more. i want it cheap!
I was in at 34.5.....not sold at 38 and holded thru earning. Now I am 13.5k down :(.
My crystal ball tells me that today is a 50 cents day: PLTR is on sale between $24.50 to $25.00...
Next target 31$
"I don't care if it's down and losing, I buy the dip to average down. Remember, if this #$%$ analysts downgrading PLTR but secretly buying millions on shares, you know PLTR is a big deal."
He said #$%$k zuckerberg ??
"TOLD Y'ALL TO HOLD THESE $PLTR $NIO $TSLA, STRONG COMPANIES!"
"SHORTS ae loosing, like they always did"
yep!! what Cathy says I follow!! she's all in in Palantir for the long term!!
"Yes! -- as a company/conglomerate, do you want to project a carbon neutral emissions agenda to the libtard world? PLTR's gotcha covered!"
Market showing NO faith in the CEO. Down 2+ points today for sure!
PLTR my biggest holding waiting for Tesla and ATI and Verizon contracts
Is there a reason for this drop or is it just to wipe out options?
Snow is down AH and we're we're a tad up. The seeking alpha article percolating a little?
Raise your hand if you are one of the original investors in PLTR since November?
Hold. Pltr has a proprietary software with expanding government contracts and an expanded sales force. Hold Long term. put it away and look at it 2 - 3 years from now. leadership is still holding substantial shares. So they and some employees sold shares they've had for years. Completely understandable. This is the time to buy. This company is more than meets the eye and the customers are governments and large corporations.
Should I go long on Monday?
At least 18-22% up that I see after what I see after hours
I really think this could be the next parabolic stock...have a feeling!!!
Just bought 10 contracts with an 28.50 strike that don’t expire till 3/5. Hopefully it works out so I can sell to pick up more shares.
"Question:1. Yahoo Finance website says that the 1 year target price of PLTR = $25.832. I assume that Yahoo Finance analysts have done their job to crunch the numbers and they believe that $25.83 is where PLTR is headed3. So, does it mean we should buy in the $23 range and sell in the $25 range?4. Unless the Yahoo Finance analysts and experts are LYING to us?Peace!"
"sold short 500 shares @25.05, will add more if higer, strong sell."
Why would ARK or anyone buy before the lock up period expires? That makes me think that the insiders won’t sell much of their stocks. Any thoughts?
"ARKK bought ~2.5 mil shares, ARKW bought ~867k shares today."
"Okay, big cyber high five,  thanks for hanging in there investors. We’re climbing up bit by bit."
Crazy cheap again add another 1400 shares
The US needs this in multiple industries. I went shopping for a refrigerator yesterday and many are back ordered with a 12+ week delay. Our supply chain needs work and PLTR can help fix it.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/n95-mask-producer-3m-expands-182704300.html
"Paresh, where are you buddy? Do we have a deal?"
I’ll never give financial advice because I’m positive many do it better...So don’t do what I’ve done and go 100% in on PLTR..PS - I sleep like a baby knowing ALL of my money is right here.PSS - Don’t gamble on sports even though I’m a sports junky. Don’t gamble at Casinos.Let’s see how many others have done enough research to know they should be allocating more to PLTR than your typical investing 101 book would suggest to you.Again - Not my advice. My only advice is never stop doing your due diligence.
This Stock is going to 5x - 10x BEY
"So the Nasdaq plunge was hedge funds getting margin called due to the GME gamma squeeze and liquidating their most liquid assets. Relax, we will be fine."

"I asked my friend, who’s working at Apple, a favor if he can ask one of their software engineers if they’re using Palantir. He said yes."
Auntie Cathy is speaking tomorrow.
I can’t wait until 3 days after earnings when no insiders sell and this stock gains 10 points. I love PLTR!!!!
everyone knows PLTR is surging north! The most precious factor is the timing! The most precious timing is last week! All the sudden above ️️ @open next week! Jealous bashers just can’t get in right now! LOL
"A small gap at $22.5 was left behind back in January- once that is filled this will consolidate to over $25. Nothing has changed about this great company, earnings were good and deals are still coming - yield curve fears are overblown and shift to value stocks is premature. Watch for the next trillion dollar injection coming into the market and Powell confirming low rates are here to stay till unemployment is addressed. Just hang in there"
"Panic, panic, panic sellers are back. Here comes a tasty dip. Man this is way to easy. "
"Today is the mother of discounts as market breathes from highs for $NIO, $NNDM, $PLTR, $XPEV, $PLUG, $FRSX, which are my largest holdings as these are what I consider disruption stocks that have the best long term gains. Excellent prices for anyone looking for a huge opportunity. NIO's ER is March 1 and is expected to be positive.

PLTR Investors
Where’s all my diamond hands at?? 
Buy the dips.
You would think a spike to $25 in the premarket would be in order for the AWS partnership.
Bought at 28$...I’ll hold to 55$
In the comments people are saying this will be 40$ tomorrow. OK... lets be realistic. If the market doesn't tank it will be wonder for it stay at the current AH price... my 2 cents :)
Countup to March 16 CNBC Chicago club interview with Karp exclusive https://www.executivesclub.org/programs/upcoming/a-conversation-with-alex-karp
RAMSES know nothing
It is most likely the final bell to board the train.
After hours really doesn’t mean anything for how it will be tomorrow
hopefully stays low tomorrow. Will add more.
"If you know charting and draw Fibo retracement lines, you will see that it has hit the 0.618 line which is usually the bottom. Based on analysis I expect Palantir to go up from here, and we will probably never see this price again. This is no financial advice, just an analysis based on a chart & the usage of some indicators :)"
WallStreetBets is attacking PLTR....? To The Moon!!!
"I’m loving it, im in green since yesterday and gonna enjoy the ride, anyone else have another good stock idea for long term investment?"
I'm holding
Just got back. What did I miss? Oh I see it’s green. Sweet. Thanks again whoever sold me their shares this morning. It was very generous of you.
This looks like a lot of employees are cashing in some stock. I imagine the boat dealers and the Ferrari dealerships are doing quite well this week. Thanks for the discounted shares!
I'm hoping this company will be back to $40 in a few months. I do not see why not
Add more today after the great interview !!
I'm anticipating another news release this week.
Why release earning pre-market after a long weekend (President's Day) after your stock lost 20% value in the previous week ? I don't give my family bad financial news early morning when they are barely awake unless is to tell them we won the lottery ! get it ?
These Senate hearings are so scary for the markets. So so scrary...
Added another 100 shares + bought back all outstanding calls today. I like the stock!
"I bought more. 20,000 shares now - holding for years."
"PLTR catalyst coming boyzzzAlex Karp, Palantir CEO, will be on CNBC's closing Bell!! tomorrow Tuesday...get your surf boards ready..."
"Bruh! Can't you see a great opportunity! Last year, March, people were so scary to buy stocks thinking that it would be the end. When the market recovered they cried because they lost the opportunity.My personal advice is buy! And you will be rewarded.Look I'm trying to get rich and live with my wife in a good house with a better car.... And I want all the best for everyone. So, don't be afraid to buy! You will be rewarded."
"What do you think is the price end of day tomorrow?I'm very heavy in Palantir, I believe in the company having great success."
Funds buying up the float.
lol - This will reverse immediately at the open
What a #$%$ stock $PLTR is. Bought some calls that printed green for a split second then tanked.
"Don’t play earning, stocks usually tank. Invest for long term."
we could easily see $29.01 today
I just sold some stocks to buy $PLTR at. $24 but now it's over $26 again.
"i've become numb to seeing negative numbers on my PLTR holding, this doesn't even phase me."
My trucks are fully loaded....I will only sell for the right price...Any suggestions on what price I should sell?
i see this hitting 65 can you? by april
"Time to Buy, everyone is fearful"
"Today's profit calculation:If you like to Day Trade for quick cash, this is the best PLTR deal for today:1. BUY at about 12:30 Eastern Standard Time: Price = $25.582. SELL at about 13:30 Eastern Standard Time: Price = $26.253. Rate of return = (1 - 25.58/26.25) = 2.55%4. This means, if you invested $1000 at 12:30pm and sold your PLTR shares at 13:30pm, you would have made a profit of about $255. With an awesome profit of $25 dollars, you could have breakfast at Starbucks for about $5, lunch at McDonalds for about $7, and dinner at Chipotle for about $9 = Total $21 and you have an extra $4 for anything else your heart desires!!!!6. Conclusion: Today is not a good day to day trade because $25 is not a lot of money to risk $1000...Peace!"
The first wave of IBM-acquired clients will have PLTR at $50.
MANIPULATION IN PROGRESS....
"I’ll be buying on the open, on my way to 1k shares"
I have a feeling that this is closing green today.
Many stocks are too ahead of their values based on fundamentals. Stocks markets are no different from casinos in short term. In long terms those holding the right stocks will be rewarded big.
"PLTR will be the next TSLA. Few people believed in TSLA in early years, now they have all harvested if they persist. PLTR will be the leader in the pack, the exponential growth will happen year after year.."

It’s gonna be a long weekend
"""We don't want profits now, we want them to invest aggressively,"" company's aggressive investments are the right path forward. Sacrificing near-term profitability for long-term growth is a net positive. Cathie Wood said."

"Like I said 2 days ago, PLTR will trade sideways for a few weeks, there will be opportunities to buy under $25. It’s about $25.3 in pre-market right now. So don’t FOMO and end up buying high. Curb your enthusiasm. When people are no longer excited and stop posting “to the moon”, then that’s the time to buy."
"Hey day traders, nothing to see here. All the action is over at GME. What are you waiting for."
50 million volume
Cathie Wood speaks as if Palantir is the next sure thing Amazon or Tesla. Invest at any price long into the future regardless of current performance or valuation. She seems to place alot of faith in the vision and products of the company. Maybe it comes to fruition or maybe it doesn’t. Is this a lottery ticket? Does Cathie already know the winning numbers?
What effect will Reddit investors have on the stock ?

is PLTR a buy for a next week selling?
the squeeze is happening now
"PEOPLE BEHIND PLTR: Direct listed to eliminate big wall street from the going public process; gives ave. investor chance to buy at great levels. Growing the company 50% yearly. Impressive free cash flow growth. Plus add the track record these people have to shareholders of their other companies. Will go up, up, up."
"Horrible company. They’re only working with the government, gas companies. Amazon, etc. who are you guys working with ?"
"Here is the yahoo profile for the latest deal with PLTR. They were founded in 1929.

Cramer told Cathie to close her fund and do it like some old school old legend I never heard of.Quietly and secretly right Cramer? Your The Street not pulling in new subscriptions? We don't want to buy Walgreens man.
"Once i receive my $1400 stimulus check, I'm going to buy PLTR again.... time to load up."
Wondering why it’s up 5% after hours. Love to see it
I really like this stock
"Yesterday, Karp had to be asked about future growth and he should have given positive prospecrive."
"A crash must be coming, EV down, tech selling off, not looking good but I will continue to hold."
We need price momentum up in this stock not just volume to get more people buying long...
"SR is correct! $65 is a good number......but, I'm calling for June 1st. GLTA....."
30-32 next Friday I’ll buy more now 500 more shares
"My advice to you guys is that this company is worth at least 50 Billion. Morgan Stanley wanted to IPO it at 42 Billion by 2018. That's with half the revenue today and an operating loss. Today, over two years later, these Wallstreet crooks are trading it at 45 Billion and accumulating. Snowflake 75 Billion. Get the message? Don't sell."
New price target $35 by Friday and $40 next Friday
"Hey retail-turd fortune tellers, your homework for the weekend is look at all the insider sales since day one of the DPO and research the difference between an IPO and a DPO. Maybe just maybe then you’ll understand what’s going on. Although I bet you still won’t get it. That’s ok, we’re all enjoying the cheap shares. Longs here aren’t selling."
EV and Tech are inflated at moment. But this one still has plenty to grow. Think about it. Cathie wood wouldn’t have bought more....and she sold Tesla and Bitcoin/RIOT....says a lot
Expect the unexpected.
"Lets close over 27 today, slow and steady."
"If you find it necessary to ask ""when are earnings"" you probably shouldn't be investing real money."
"The product, named Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is planned for businesses in retail, financial services, manufacturing, and telecommunications, among other sectors."
"I've been in the investment business for 30 years and worked with wall street traders in my prime. It's not simply ""coincidence"" that there is a strong support level for this stock at 22.50, which is exactly 50% from the high of 45.00. This is where large institutions and fund managers will step in and either start or add to existing positions. Of course the price can go lower than 22.50, as seen on 3/5 when it went down to the low 20's, but the panic selling that day was bought up quickly. Follow the money.This is precisely why Ark and other companies kept adding shares around the $23 level (and lower) as it was getting closer to 22.50. Ask yourself, at what level do institutions wait to buy, 50% from the highs, 60%, 70%? They won't ""wait"" for 60% or 70%... Could PLTR go lower than $20, of course anything is possible, especially in this rate environment, but it's highly unlikely at this point. All of the angry posters on here saying the stock will go to $10 have zero experience.Bottom line, no doubt this will be a rocky road near term, but the market has already shown us the pressure points on this stock. Plus, the market has already shown how quickly the stock bounced from $20 on 3/5 low to $27 on 3/15, less than two weeks. So relax, use the dips to buy and you will be rewarded, not only long term, but within weeks. Leave emotion at the door and use logic. Think about it, what would happen to a stock if nobody was willing to sell?Full disclosure: I started accumulating at the end of February and now hold 1,000 shares. Will keep buying more at these discounted prices."
some serious daytrading churn...with all these shares now this is like a paradise

Al you really have to do is just look at Alex Karp and understand that this is a guy you speaks tech much better than he speaks English in a Social setting. And that’s the guy I want to invest in. Look at Jock Dorsey...guy looks like he hasn’t look at anything other than a Computer screen for the last 5 years. Those are the guys I want to give my money too.
"Why is a surprise to anyone that the reason they did a DPO is to covert 17 years of ownership into currency? It started at the DPO. The SP has gone up ever since and institutions are happily scooping up the shares. The leadership will be getting more bonus stock options as the company blows out their goal of 30% annual growth rate with a substantial pipeline. If you panic sell, there are lots of buyers."

Palantir ! Hold Be patient ! Billions of dollars will enter the market tomorrow ! Stimulus ! ! ! Buy Buy
So insiders sold 18 million dollars today worth of the stock and Cathie wood only bought 70 millions worth of the stock along with other 4 hedge funds! Lol bullish AF!!!
"i spoke with my stock investor today and told him I was still a hold on Palantir. He has been an investor for 35 years and says Palantir is a good company, with a bright future and he us going to buy into Palantir. So for all you people who bought in above where Palantir is currently priced be patient with the correction. There was a huge sell off by the insiders, plus a correction in the whole market. i encourage you to be patient even if Palantir sells off more tomorrow. You only take a loss if you sell below where you bought. The stock price WILL turn around. Thus company is getting into business with bigger businesses, 3M, BP, Facebook to name a few. Not to mention the huge mining company and the U.S. and foreign government contracts they have landed. Wait it out. Don't listen to all of the negative Nancy's out there. Do your own research on the company. My investor did and he is a buy!"
Cash is growing $200m each qtr 2020.
"I don’t quite understand why there’s so much pressure being put on the profit margins. RND usually makes companies operate at a consistent loss until they have a product that is finished and can then be distributed for a profit. I feel as if palantir was smart about using government contracts to fun their development before entering the market beyond. People seem to forget that Tesla since it’s conception operated at a loss for many of the same reasons. Tesla just this year became profitable but it’s stock was always seen as an overvaluation by those who couldn’t see the long game. Palantir is long, no short term profits here. They are a leader in their industry that has just truly left the development phase and are moving quickly into distribution. If they continue to sign great contracts like they have been, I see no reason why they aren’t posting profit post 2022."
Wth is happening to the markets everything is on sale
"Some of you trade like your day traders , seeing dips of 2-5% and selling only to buy back when it jumps up 5-10% ."

"Cathie said this is the next Tesla, not sure how she came up with that but I don’t doubt her . I’m all in"
Big manipulation right now.. will green after the bell 100%
"This board is so much more pleasant on green days.Gee,I wonder why?"
"I don't care if this goes to $10 or $100 in the short term, I'm covered calling and buying more every week, I'm in this stock for years. This is the next trillion dollar market cap stock. I can't believe the boomers don't see this companies future."
This is not going back yo 24! Accept the fact! We will hit 30s end of month!
Up to mid $30s

Bought this morning slowly. Now at 980 shares with 25.41 average. I am holding for 34.
Loaded up today. Support levels seems to be 35. Looking at 40 post earnings. Been in since 22. This is my 3rd buy.
And this is green! just WOW!
Cathy Wood is on CNBC right now praising Palantir!
https://gov.capital/stock/pltr-stock/1 year later 108.481681
I think most of the panic selling we've seen over the past week has much to do with the lock up expiry. I think it will be a nothingburger. Insiders and early investors are too intelligent to sell at 40 when they can fetch 150 in time. buy. hold. chill. (tried and true strategy). Stop hiking yourselves out of winners like Palantir. Tuesday morning will look like your birthday.
the last filer alexander moore for 35000 shares sold only...good man ..ye shall be rewarded...the selling is officially done we march upwards from here
"$30+ by end of next week, $125 by Christmas, IMO."
"Had 2800@25.01.Added 2400 in premarket.Now total 5200@27.02.Feels good, man."
Cathie Wood is the best investor of our time. Follow Cathie not the clowns.She said Palantir is a triple digit stock and she's 100% right
Today is the the day  tgif!!
100 dollar stock in a year 500 dollar stock in 3 years. Buy all dips the first year of this IPO
"Rumor has it that during earnings call, you'll see leadership pledge not to sell shares after lock-out"
Glad I added more yesterday!!!
"Bought 1,000 at $24.92 and another 1,000 at $24.84. Total position of 8,000 now. Set it and forget it!"
Let's make a cult of this stock! Target $500!
"I believe Palantir won't move too much this year since a lot of growth has already been priced in, maybe it'll get to 30-32. However, I believe this stock with take off within the next two years as they acquire more commercial customers and continue to give great guidance. I'm using this time to slowly build a substantial position while it's cheap and reap the award in 2-3 years."
It was a good day to buy
im still here
"Lol standard pre market green, open red"
Anyone placing a long option on this??
Another meme stock. And you wonder why it is red most of the time
7000 shares and will be holding for 1-2 years
Its holding very well considering the broader markets
I’m done with this stock. Not going anywhere
"Upside Down Report: PLTR, a company, who is the last 3 weeks partners with Amazon, IBM and 3M. The stock is $23.40 a share."
35$ counting in next week
I have 30/c expiring on Friday!
At this point it's just going with the market. That is the best sign one could get.
Quadruple Witching Day non human low volume traded options/futures shenanigans. No one talked about it this week on tv. Just sell tech scary bonds. Buy banks...the mass market algo button was slapped an hour before close...The wizard of Oz is real.

Looking at the call options, some people are expecting $65 by April-20214. Now, if all goes as planned, I should be the only millionaire in the neighborhood5. My backup plan: If PLTR goes south, I have one more horse left from my 4 horses. I will be heading West to find gold (My belongings will be packed in my small carriage and pulled by my 5 years old stallion and my family will need to learn how to live without toilet paper until we reach San Francisco sometime in the summer of 2025)6. I have literally bet the entire farm on PLTR...Peace!!!"
"This company is grabbing some solid consumer market foundation like IBM and Amazon, hopefully Azure will also join the strategic alliance too. PLTR they can start harvest the result year by year. $100 is really foreseeable with the earnings, not by shortsqueeze."

Got in today. Excited for the long term.
Why are the owners selling shares all the time if it's such a great company? Don't believe in your own company's success? Do they know more than ordinary investors?

I should buy more yesterday 
"I learned something else from CNBC interview with AR Sorkin about a year ago. First data silos. Look it up.2nd, palantir allows foreign users to use its software without the threat of accessing privileges data. So it can segment what the users see, maintain pricacy and integrity but still serve disparate customers allows collaboration and full speed ahead."
THIS SHOULD BE NOW +9%!
I haven't bought in yet....might do so at these prices

Low prices for a while isn't so bad. It gives us time to acumulate shares of our favorite stocks. Provided we have availiable cash ofcourse. Eventually we will be rewarded. Patience is key.

"Summary of Palantir interview. 1) Silicone Valley is phony. 2) Alex Carp stated that in the same way the Government protects us, they also support the Federal Government. 3) If you do not like the vision of Palantir, there are plenty of other places to put your money."

"Inflation fears continue to affect tech stocks. Palantir, Apple, Tesla, Nio are all down along with others. This downturn for Palantir does not reflect Palantir's growth as other tech stocks are struggling. Give it some time and Tech stocks will rally as inflation fears fade. Thank You"

"PLTR basically has NO DEBT! Almost 90% of Assets are LIQUID (which grew 50% since 12-31-2019). The company has projected a very conservative guidance of $4B in Rev by 2025. So, if it grows $600m in cash with $1B in Rev, what will it generate with $4B? This company will be a cash MONSTER."
Let the buying begin.. !!
I see $30 very soon. Strap in.
Used to be my best stock but this month became my worst stock ever. 1. Regretted not take profit2. Should have never average up in these 2 months!
"If PLTR is going to ""grow into its multiple"" explain how it hasn't ""grown"" over the past ten years? It has grown as big as it is going to be. Ten years of losses with a $47,300,000,000 market cap. The CEO gives you the finger everyday but you just keep telling yourself ""this is the next Google!!!"" No, it isn't. It is a symbol over everything that is wrong with tech stocks today and will be in the single digits by the end of this year. Get out now."
"Worrying about executives selling shares for profit is the same as asking why leaves fall during autumn. There’s a pretty obvious answer but I guess most investors use their feelings rather their brains. The markets been shaky the past weeks and the next few days are uncertain, why would you be surprised if executives sold and took profits early? Especially since they were rewarded shares as commission.The fact is the market is going to recover and when it does so too will pltr, once pltr gets back on beat we’ll see the price soar to sweet heights. We just don’t know when, all you can do is watch, wait and hold, or sell your shares and incur a loss. Shorts and bears can hop around all they want, but when PLTR flies all of a sudden don’t go thinking it’s some miracle."
You know what to do shorts. COVER COVER COVER 
This is the stock that will feed me during my retirement.
"Cramer does not mention Rev forecast of +45% for Q1. Does consider that maybe management’s $4B guidance for 2025 is conservative (considering ave rev growth is 44%), what is realistic is close to $8B for 2025. A lot of cash generation potential."
Great company & management. Wood likes it too. $70 in two weeks. Add all you can under $30. Short overpriced EV stocks like NIO and LI
People stop putting negative comments because you want to buy cheaper otherwise you wouldn't be here so don't play games with other people's minds.
Are we getting pegged an an option stock price?
Lock up fears over. No barriers to lift off.
I just picked up $20K of calls 
"See you on May 13 for the next resultsmy opinion is that PLTR underestimates its incomeI think we will be in a range of 400 to 500mio with profit.People have no idea what the partnerships with IBM and AWS mean.AWS has a third of the cloud market in the world and for PLTR the door is open to global application and visibility. I don't care about stupid emotion-based reviews, one day PLTR is worth 15, another day 100, tomorrow it will be 30 or 20, that doesn't mean anything.What I do know is that PLTR will become an inescapable monopoly and that is priceless. So don't rely on multiples and ratios. Remember TSLA AMZN GOOG FACEBOOK when they first started saying exactly the same thing."
"Palantir Strikes Long-Term Partnership With French Automotive Supplier Faurecia: What You Need To KnowMore content belowPalantir Strikes Long-Term Partnership With French Automotive Supplier Faurecia: What You Need To KnowShanthi RexalineThu, March 11, 2021, 8:10 AM·1 min readPalantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) shares were advancing Thursday after the data analytics software company announced a strategic partnership.What Happened: Palantir said it has entered into a six-year strategic partnership with French automotive supplier Faurecia to help the latter accelerate its digital transformation and move toward carbon neutrality.The French company will use Palantir's Foundry software to obtain better insights on data from manufacturing to purchasing, and from engineering to finances.The software will help reduce Faurecia's material consumption, improve R&D competitiveness, secure purchasing excellence and track and measure overall CO2 neutrality efforts, according to Palantir.""The range of uses for Foundry across Faurecia shows the breadth of practical applications for our software in the manufacturing and automotive sectors,"" said Palantir COO Shyam Sankar.Why It's Important: Palantir's revenue guidance for fiscal year 2021 suggests a slowdown in growth to 30%-plus compared to 40% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.The commercial segment's revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter.Partnerships such as the one with Faurecia are likely to accelerate revenue momentum, eventually helping the company to outperform expectations."

"Down day on slow selling and low volume. So far it touched 26.00$ two times with both dips being heavily bought. 26.00$ is becoming new POC with smart people accumulating shares around that area. Just my humble opinion, GLTA."
I have put a 1000 limit order @ 9$. Do you think I might get it cheaper if I wait another few weeks? Or 9$ in 2/3 weeks will be a good entry point? Help a man.
I bought in December $25.80 200 shares. Look at Premarket now at $25.90 lol. I held through $45.

"Imagine a company creating a product that ties various operating systems, search engines, data storage, and data sets all together. That company you just imagined is what Palantir is already doing."
I’m still here
"I find it ironic, that so many people say that they are long term holders of PLTR, and in the next sentence, they ask everyone what they think the stock price will get to this week. If you are a long term investor, who cares what the stock price gets to this week, month, or even year. There is not one person on planet earth, that can give you a price prediction, with any conviction. No one knows!!! Ride the ups and the downs, don't look at the stock price every 5 minutes, and if the company is all that it is made out to be, it will be a solid investment. Full disclosure, I hold 5000 shares of PLTR with an average price of $21.75"
$50 on Dec 2021.
Cathy Wood is buying more!
Nice price to buy in these economic conditions we are in. This is a keeper and could give 100% with in short period of time.The volume and technology attracts more funds.Keep buying at these levels.It could be headed to 45. This down turn is a boon
Congrats to those that just bought that dip. Easily 30-40. This is a joke.
Partnership is a game changer.....wouldn't want to be Shorty !
"Those who hold this stock long & strong will definitely make the most out this trade. Do not get panic in the short term's fluctuations. This will surely make the correction in the price and even go higher, It just needs time and patience (for long-term holders). As long as you believe in PALANTIR's success, the stock will eventually do great in the end. DO NOT SCARE YOURSELF WITH DAILY FLUCTUATIONS IF YOU ARE LONG."
looks like someone will test their luck @ 22.61. They said buy on top of me now!

"Plenty of buying interest folks, green by EOD."
"Wait until the market opens, that is when the real buying frenzy will start...IMHO"

Looking forward to next week!!!
This is going down to $18 for sure now
Been holding since $9.45 and not selling a single share 
Did Ark just bought another pile of shares?
"Cathie Wood is trying to average down to cover her portfolio paper loss on Palantir.Action speaks louder than words. If this stock has any potential of going up before next quarter, insiders would have waited instead of dumping million of shares already."
Tough question. Is Cathie Wood an investment genius or does she just allocate to extreme momentum stocks (which have done tremendous in this part of the cycle).
Right here is where the buy in and buy backs start
Wish I’d waited and got in below 33 but in the bigger picture it doesn’t matter

"Dear Shorts,1. Walmart has a sale in the LUBE section2. Get some Xanax at Walmart as well3. Xanax = Sedative = It can treat anxiety and panic disorder.4. Get Well Soon!!!Peace!"
Everyone here is like ohhh don’t listen to anyone that uses Cathie Woods to bait you into buying more - k why would Cathie woods purchase MORE of Palantir 3 days before she knows the lock up period is going to end. Why would the CEO of Palantir purchase 40 million dollars of shares of the company 2 weeks before the lock up expires.
All the bearish people in this comment section have no idea what they are talking about. The market began to recover at the end of Friday and will continue to ride on the stimulus news. This stock has been in the 20s for around a month now. This is a 30s stock but I wouldn't get your hope up on it jumping 10% in one day but it will gradually go up as the week goes on and the weeks to come. It hit bottom at 19.50 and for the people saying it's going below 20 are just trolling. Do your DD and make your own decisions but I think we will touch 30 at the very least.
"Karp should change his name to Krap. That what he does to investors. This is a person, no matter what a ""genius"" he is believed to be, who has absolutely zero talent at running a public company except into the ground. He needs to be replaced by someone with experience and that Wall Street trusts. Stock has no where to go but down."
the outstanding shares are so large that if it ever gets up from the selling by employees and pltr it will take massive buying interest
3000 shares and holding long 
"The market crash it's over, we'll see nice numbers on $PLTR $NIO! THE PAIN IT'S OVER!!! HODL!"

With all announcements I hope the earnings are a smash. Lots of speculation going on here but really nobody knows unless you happen to work there
today bought aark investment $40 soon
After hours 
From 44 to 27... wow.
"I see bashers are hard at it. Good, try to make a little profit. I hope it goes down some more, I will be a buyer on further weakness. I hav done my DD and am positioning for long term. Unlike other recent tech offerings this company actually makes money and has long term earnings growth potential. No rocket emojis or comments like straight to the moon. Those are as ridiculous as some of the ""basher"" statements and neither should be a influence whether you a should buy or sell a stock"
Happy Friday guys 
HOLD THRU ARK'S 150 PT. I'M AVERAGING UP.
Holding well considering 140M shares moving around.
This is a 100$ company folks. Just patient.
This panic selling happening these days makes absolutely no sense. Powell just said rates will not increase until 2022/2023 so I don’t see particular problems for stocks evaluations in the near term. Perfect time to add some nice tech and disruptive stocks!
Palantir will open at +15% above Friday's close and go up to +25% on Monday. Who's with me?
"Wow, sponsored posts pumping the stock. Not good."
I wish it were up more but glad to see people stepping in at every dip
should i buy now or wait for the dip tommorw... the whole market is green and you know that doesn't happen 2 times in a row
Just bought 200 more shares
"After hearing what the CEO had to say about the stock price, now I know why there was so much insider selling a few weeks ago."
I like this stock
"No one panic , u only lose when u sell for a lost. All these good stocks will be the first to fly when the market comes back"
Funny how when it is down in pre-market the shorts are so whitty and 'told ya so' written every 2 seconds but when it is up they seem to have better things to do...
Palantir sales is crew is at 30 reps....after IBM partnership....Palantir gains another 2500 sales reps through IBM....By percentage calculation...thats about 8233% more sales reps w/ corresponding rise to revenue.
"hope you got that dip,!"
"IBM was so concerned, went into a partnership. “If you can’t beat them, then join them”."
"When we see cash generation for Q4, most intelligent investors we see the engine to print money. Those trying to be clever exiting out of PLTR, thinking to get back in on a big dip (or correction) do your numbers and understand tax liability. Better approach is to hold for the long term."
Nice 
Man is doing your own research in this stock vindicating!Thank you Karp and Thiel for being blatantly transparent and leaving all the intel out in the open for the public to pick up on provided they were willing to do some reading and listening!#notallthatisgoldglitters

Opening above 28$ tomorrow! Thumbs up if you think so!
Given Palantir's exclusive relationship with our most opaque division of government...that's basically a monopoly... in and of itself that's worth 50.

I bet there's a lot of forced sales due to margin calls. That drives the market even lower.
"This 4Q I think we are expecting too much because it will only cover until December. ! But after this Q, We will see this jumping to 40s or even 50s. Always buy when is down, and hold!,"

"If an insider wants to buy a brand new Bentley and a $20m mansion after staying with the company for 17 years, they'll sell a portion of their PLTR shares to pay for it.

"Ok, time to buy!"
"I added to my collection. To me, this is no-brainer accumulate."
alright i scapped up enough money to buy one more share. everyone buy one more in about ten minutes from now to break the 24.50 resistance if we get this past .66 cents it will pop

"$1 bln revenue, $44 bln cap. Haaa?"
Jim Cramer right now
"We talked a lot about how prices in the last 3’days were depressed due to pressure like lock up exp etc. what you have not mentioned is those who day traded on margin did not want to pay interest for 3 days so they had to sell. There are companies that did so well like Apple recent earnings, but stock got sold immediately. Why? Because the price was at its top before earning. With PLTR, since it was bearish by 20%, and I’m not saying that it’s 100% that it would go up, the chances for it to go further down is less than the short covering, the buy backs after the long weekend. The market is so counter intuitive. But my understanding tells me that these traders were ahead of smaller long term retail investors, so they sold way before the lock up, plus the pressure of not wanting to hold the shares over the long weekend as they have to pay interests, they over sold the stock. So have fun catching up the prices Tuesday then!"

"Jim Cramer recommended Ulta a few weeks ago when it was trading 345-350. It now trades at 312. They changed CEO’s, and now have been downgraded by multiple analysts. On the other hand. He does not recommend Palantir. Because, according to him, he doesn’t really understand it. This alone is a clear buy signal for me. "
Heheheh I’m getting turned on now

"peter thiel is a republican donor and operative who's company, palantir benefitted while trump was in office. almost all of their new business came from the govt. how will he and palantir fair now that we have the democrats in office. haven't the analysts warned you about this? haven't they been ringing the bell about this? NO NO NO NO NO...........BUYER BEWARE."
"I forsee that palantir is gonna be huge. Making business decisions with analytics is some unique value proposition which you can't find it elsewhere. Furthermore with more government contracts coming up, it's eventually gonna reach its fullest potential. Invest in pltr now is like buying tesla when is was below $300 pre split. Potentially a 10x bagger company"
Am I the only one wishing it wasn't the weekend?
I bought the dip three times. And I will buy the dip three more times
"Few days in a row in red (when whole market is down) and local folks freak out. That's hillarious. Show some patience cry babies or sell and never go back. That's what Karp said. It's a long term investment. And for your information, for those who don't know what ""long term"" means. Even 3 years in red doesn't matter, it is still short term. Long term mean decade and more."
Why would the insiders sell if they can sell at $150. I'm sure they make good money already!!
PLTR going above 30s in near future.

"the report is going to be great. We are holding 10,000 shares strong."
Really? It goes up to $26 and people are selling? Doesn’t anyone want to make some *real* money?
"Gonna buy more shares while is still cheap, short-mid and long term is a no-brainer"
This is a joke right

2:30 is when the margin calls come in. Watch for a huge dump as hedge funds will have to cover billions on GME.
Fast Money Jeff’s closing trade selection is PLTR. Thinks it hit its level of support and will go up from here.
Time to buy more. This is going to the moon before and after earnings!
insert tendies here   
Don't buy this stock.
May add bit when it's under 20
Overall market correction. This is why you diversify and ALWAYS keep cash in your portfolio.
"I have to assume most of the bashers are secretly loading up right now before we run up to 40+ this week. If they have no interest in buying the stock, then why are they even here?"
Palantir is responsible for tracking down bin laden. Alex Karp said Palantir has stopped many terrorist attacks you don’t even know about before they happened.... let that sink in... how can you put a valuation/ price on this company? Next earnings report going to knock it out of the park
just watched the demo walk through video I see huge upside potential for this company especially if they can get major contracts with large companies like amazon
"Hey, it's red....come on out shorts...."
"Just watched Tom Nash YouTube video on why Palantir could hit 1T MC, does anybody really see this happening? I could see 300 - 400b MC but 1T....."
Buying more once it opens
"Don’t you love the whiners? Oh I’m long but why can’t this be $100 right now? Get real people. Didn’t you listen to Karp? You don’t like it, leave but stop your whining."
"dow and the S&P are both green now, Nasdaq appears to be upswinging as well. my long term faith in this company is utterly unshakeable -that being said if we finish green today I will literally nut"
"PLTR has become so big, it's attracting all the bot spammers."
++=Palantir=
Couldn’t resist added another 1200 shares
Patience and conviction in the stocks you own always pays off. Buckle up on the path to $45 and then some
Grandma Cathie Wood: THANK YOU for loading up the trucks...To The Moon?
No doubt During covid19 all cloud computing base company is earning good So no doubt that earning day will be perfect
"Last chance to get, sky rocket next week!"
Next week +35$
A lot of PLTR investors will become even more wealthy starting tomorrow morning!
Speedy recovery Tiger. We’re praying for you.
Who else bought under 26
"My sister loves this company. 90% of her portfolio is on this company at an average price of 24 . Me on the other hand, I like this company because it’s innovative and works with secret agencies . My portfolio is only 15% of PLTR shares. (Sorry, I love space companies a lot )In my opinion this stock will stay between 25-28 for the next week. After it consolidates the price it will go above 34 and try to reach a new ATH by around the start of May or start of April only if every with the stock market goes well."
Back to $30 tomorrow
Palantir will continue to land new partnerships. Amazon Web Services partnership and Fuarecia are just the beginning.
I’ve been warning all you permabull bag holders every single day for weeks! . This was a pump n dump meme stock scam! Get out while you can. This will be single digits soon enough!
Going red todayyy
No one stopped to ask themselves maybe the MM's are bringing price down so they can get in before the massive run back up past $40?? Think about it..
will it drop below $24.80 tomorrow???
I SEE 27
"Let's see a $2 jump today, it is about time, no?"
"Palantir's management are smashing this earnings call.These guys are not messing about, Palantir is the future.We are holding for many years."
"KARP is talking about Apple, FB basters, GOOG, AMZN, Twtr crack baby, and Soros a Hooooo"
"One of my biggest mistakes was not buying into Amazon at 400 a share because I thought their valuation was rich... I won’t do that with Palantir, I have a feeling this will be the biggest player in the data space in the next 5-10 years l."
"Was quite insightful reading on the simply wall st article about Palantir ownership breakdown: Retail investors 63.7%, insiders 9.7%, institutions 20.7%, public companies 5.9%It really does show the bears argument around insiders selling is baseless and fake news.It does also highlight that the recent pltr stock price drop is probably more likely to be result of immature and inpatient retail investors, hoping to become millionaires overnight and focusing on buying options and puts instead of actual shares.I must admit I have now changed my mind and I’d rather prefer institutional ownership to be greater than retail investors. At least they won’t be playing roulette with my investment.So, paper hands, sell sell sell! Move back to gme or wherever else but stay away from pltr. Serious investors, be patient, it will take a few more months but we’ll get there.Wouldn’t surprise me if pltr is not announcing any new major contract now because they are waiting for price to return to previous levels."
can't see this going much below this
There is a very high correlation between PLTR and NASDAQ 100. This means PLTR is down because funds are selling all high tech stocks. Nothing particularly wrong with PLTR per se.
a green start!!
"You can play games and buy GME and the rest of the meme stocks.Or you can buy the F out of PLTR and get rich over the next several years. Buy, hold, and never let go."
The executives held for 17 years. You retail-turds can’t hold for 17 minutes. That’s why they’re billionaires and you’re eating a hot pocket while bashing a great company that makes other great companies greater. Stuff that in your bong and smoke it.
I wouldn't worry too much about the drop. The rest of the zero profit tech darlings are down 3-4%. It's a sector dump.
Closing somewhere near $26 today. Watch those option contracts expire worthless.
shorts and pltr bashers are back to their caves where they belong
Tuesday will be glorious
skynet rules!!
PLTR stock is like a love affair...a. It's UP pre-market (Meaning: The infatuation period during the dating phase between a girl and a boy in love)b. It's DOWN during the regular trading period 9:30 am to 4pm (Meaning: Marriage + Stress + Fighting + Divorce)c. It's UP after-market (Meaning: After Breakup and/or Divorce the boy and girl are happy again)
Can everybody just shut The hell up about squeezing?Just because you learned a new Word a couple of weeks ago does not mean you have to use it Every Day
When Auntie Cathie load up more I am in peace with my 3000 shares. I am not selling.
It will test 20 for sure.
Did I make a mistake buying this? 300 shares at 26.18
"Faurecia deal is a really good news. Looks like France is keen on PLTR (actually its 3rd largest market after the US and UK) : - Airbus (to allow Airbus to keep up on A350's production); - Sanofi to gather clinical data; - DGSI (kinda like the Homeland department in the US). They have renewed their contract with PLTR in 2019, even though Thales ran against; - and now Faurecia, which is a major automotive company. Take note that Palantir France's CEO is the former CEO of Airbus (2012-2018) and thus know pretty much everyone, including the present government. One more interesting thing is that Faurecia is owned at around 40% by Stellantis (PSA and Fiat Chrysler). That deal was thus most likely overshadowed by their boards. More opportunities for PLTR in that sector.PLTR knows how to lobby and it's only the beginning."
"When it passes $30 IMO, it will be a psychological pass and it will accelerate the rise faster..."
PLTR is a retirement stock buy forget it 5-10 years
auto buy order @24
In 5 years I see this at 5 dollars. Hehehehheh.
its risk off bc of possible inflation reaching over 5 percent...housing running at 25 percent over on coasts and higher byilding costs...and if course autos high costs...thats whats gonna empty our pocketbooks and cause real world inflation erode savings...inactually think thats a good thing if you own stocks bc theh just have to charge more but only for companies selling what people want...is pltr that company i am not sure
"once the gme, and other #$%$ meme stock hype is over, they will all move back into pltr which is the golden meme stock"

"Don’t worry too much about the lockup period ending. ￼it only happens once, just like a Texas winter snowstorm"
Let’s take this baby back to $45
Already $24.80 in pre marker. CEO interview did it
"I keep remembering what Cathie said in one of her recent interviews about Palantir. She said she loves that they’re still aggressively investing and that we’re in a “winners take most” market. Every deal they land, gets them that much closer to the “winners take most” goal.They had 20 deals over $5M last quarter alone. Simply impressive."
Wait till this goes to 8.
Diamond
"I am long this stock, but will definitely not be adding to my holdings right now. The Fed is losing control of things, and with the 10 year bond yield increasing daily, and very rapidly too, interest rates are going to go up, and Tech is going to suffer. This $1.9T relief package, is also a disaster, which we'll be paying for in the years to come. Full Disclosure: I have 4000 shares at an average cost of $21.75."
"Interesting how they sorta buried this news release today: Palantir and 3M Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply ChainFebruary 23, 2021, 5:59 AMPalantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) today announced a multi-million dollar expansion of its relationship with 3M. 3M has chosen to expand its use of Palantir's Foundry platform to support its digital transformation, assisting in the build out of a dynamic supply chain that enables the global manufacturer to respond nimbly to changes in demand across tens of thousands of products."
69$ stock
"As I told yesterday this will explode any time and break GS upgraded price and continue moving. We may see couple of breaks before that but it is imminent that this will go higher. The price movement today, I don’t rely much because it may swing back down. But this move is good to take support lower side."
Told you PLTR is a 100+ dollars stock soon!
Let's moon now!
Added another 750 shares
I cannot let go for less than three digits. I am looking at $125 EOY and forward to $200+ EOY 2022. This is my midterm outlook and I realize it is aggressive. 6 months will be a hard catalyst and this will bring $50-70. Any ideas?
leave your holdings. Let it work for you. Just get out and enjoy your weekend.
PLTR Kathie wood mania
I sense the shorts beginning the panic
buying 200 shares now
USD is rocketing higher. We're going to have a good day!
PLTR TO THE MOON

You are buying Facebook for 27-28 ...............
This ER was exquisitely and strategically planned after a three day weekend and before market open on the 2/16/21. You think Thiel and Alex Karp don't know what they are doing???...they are geniuses at the highest level.

Where the shorts at? LOL
"you want be miljonair ( not in one week), buy PLTR and look 2 years from now ."
"Others can trade but I’m holding as long as it moves up steadily. If there is some ridiculously inflated move, then I may step aside for a while but it’s now doing exactly what it should."
PLTR shareholders.
"Come on keep selling, $29 is my next buy limit order."
I've had enough of the stock market I really have.
"Oh snap, we’re green for the day. This could very well close above $27!"
1 min chart ended in an ascending wedge. Tomorrow is going to go hamsammich
"My fellow PLTR investors,Don't mind my ramblings, I am just doing some calculations because I am dreaming BIGLY and planning on becoming the first millionaire in my family in less than 2 years by investing in PLTR stock (I am trying to impress the wife by betting my entire farm on PLTR)1. Current price = $26.502. If it goes by an average of 5% per day, then we should be at: $27.825 by this Friday3. By Monday next week = $29.224. By Tuesday next week = $30.685. By Wednesday next week = $32.216. By Thursday next week = $33.827. By Friday next week = $35.518. If ALL goes well, I should be a millionaire in less than 2 years.9. I haven't taught about the consequences of the worst case of losing our farm.10. I am fairly sure that my wife will not understand why we are suddenly living in the van down by the river.Peace!"
Just ran to the store to buy some diamonds for my hands.
Short this dog. Too much future competition. Buy below 24.00.....!!!!!
"Like I said before, PLTR will trade sideways for several weeks. Be patient, no rush."
Don’t know if anyone has mentioned it but it finished +9.11% up In Frankfurt. 
aunty cathie are you buying more today?
Every next day PLTR is becoming cheaper and cheaper. Palantir is making new juicy partnerships and price is going sideways. Best scenario. I need to get more money to buy more shares ASAP
"OMG you bashers and negative people, get over it, it's a market crash, all tech stocks are affected. It will go back up. Stop freaking out and cause panick in others that will sell."
"Credit Suisse just congratulated them. Shorts, did you hear that??Who you going to follow now??"
"OK, Buy PLTR asap and Hold for long !"
Ark invested about 45mil today mean something
Yesterday report called us the next fang stock. 300 to 500.
"Oh snap! Cathie ""Tiger"" Wood buys 1.5. I guess she wan't listening to the bashers on this board today. ( and CNBC )"
So far we are a go for green and continued upwards momentum any +announcement 30.00 pps and change. my analysis is the latter. gl
Keep an eye on the options. Somethings coming.
wow so many good news
"Palantir and 3M Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply Chain, lets go"
This should have a positive increase in share price tomorrow PLTR + AWS for all customers now available https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-aws-team-erp-suite-205011002.html
"As I approach retirement and look back on my life, I like to reflect on all the things I've learned along the way. When it comes to investing I haven't done to badly with what I've had to work with. On a blue collar salary and no pension I'm doing pretty good. There are few things I wish that I might have known a little sooner. If I had, I would already be retired. The single most important investment strategy is to find a company that is going to change the world and invest in them. Palantir is one of these companies."
$32 today
Go babe go. Go up to 30 today.
Anyone who can explain me the business case of Palantir? The market value is is like 40x sales.
You better believe my stake in PLTR will go up today if this continues. Don’t worry I’ll be thanking all you panic sellers as will many others including all the institutions.
This stock will make me rich! Come on!
"Karp needs to focus more in talking about the Palantir technology and less on irritating his enemies. They are dangerous enough with out him aggravating them! Other than that, its one of the best bets in Tech today. IMO"
anyone have the premarket volume numbers?
just got in for the first time at $27.10 lets go Longs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"What fund manager wouldn't pick up more $PLTR stock on Amazon news. Don't tell Cramer, it's too much for him to process."
Broke $22.50. Down to $22
"The peak at open today above was above it’s 5 day peak. Double top attempt to short was thwarted by 24.50 wall. Trend is upward albeit deliberate (on purpose strong algo consolidation and selling of puts). However, there have been some big buys and big short closes to test various short term ceilings. Amazon, Army, BP, Rio Tinto, IBM...just to begin with. Fundamentals are too strong - markets prevail over short sighted. Always. It is a battle for shares by institutions thus the deliberate pace of sideways consolidation. If you build it he will come.Patience."
If this is under $75 in 2022 I will be genuinely shocked.
Watch this double prior to next ER.
Mon:RedTues:RedWed:RedThurs: Redto be continued......15 is coming soon.
Time for that power hour to start. Push toward that Goldman Sachs price target of $34!

"Wow congrats to all the lucky longs, see if it could be 40 EOD?"
"Again, than you who ever sold me your shares this morning. When will you guys learn?"
Should I buy another 100 and average down for a 3rd time!!!!
"Where are my homies at?The Reddit boys and girls are not doing their sacred job yet?Many commentators are saying that The WSB crowd (WallStreetBets) are targeting PLTR stock.So, since I do own PLTR stock, if the WSB crowd targets PLTR and make PLTR stock go to $250 per share, this means I can become a millionaire before Spring timeOK WSB boys and girls... I have no idea how you guys do your magic, but if PLTR goes the same way as GameStop, I will quit my job and move to the Bahamas this summer"
"I’m prepared either way, hold or load. Shorts have one option, cover."
Buy the dip and enjoy the show
"This post is just for understanding, PLTR has about 45 Bil of market cap, but only 1,5B of estimate revenue in 2021 and 16cent of estimate earning in 2021. It makes a P/E of about 150. And in 2022 it will not be much different with a P/E of 110 at current price. So the current price appears so high. the question is: WHY?"
"Why the f are we down 6% when the market has almost completely recovered. I'm long, but this is not cool."
Added 3700 shares today

Short-term relief coming later after 2PM. Say hello to my little friends ...

Hope hope hope 
People are hyping this stock too much... hope they are right though because I bought at 39 )-;
Are we going to retest $8.90 during this downtrend?
I’ve been buying all day long in increments of 25. Hard to believe anyone could see the ER as a reason to unload shares.
Daddy just picked up more :)
Adding
"Long since $15. Honestly, I dont even care about the price. Days like this are healthy, you get to add some shares on discount. Who cares if the price dips to $28 today. If you are in it for the long haul you expect $100+ in 2022. Thankfully there are a bunch of overly emotional people in this stock that gives guys like myself cheap shares."
I believe Palantir is developing the evolution of the OS. Operating systems allow us to manipulate and store data. Palantir creates software that allows us to make sense of that data in ways we never thought possible.
just bought more
How much is everyone losing on Palantir?
Want to hear a joke?Cramer says Snowflake is high growth.

Over 100K $30 call options were purchased today expiring fri.
I don't think PLTR really follow the ebb and flow of any indexex. PLTR has beed trading sideways and ending par this entire week regardless of the movement of the indexes. You bears really know nothing
Like if you think Cathie Wood bought today

"In a world where countries and companies data is the most valuable asset, which other countries steal and get rich from, PLTR becomes a national security and economic sovereignty paramount necessity. Mark my words, this stock is goes beyond some ""quarter earnings"", it is a paradigm shift from naive digital age to complex/segregated data necessity. The sky is the limit. FANG is old history..."
"cathie woods works for the hedge funds milking the sheep, next stop shearing pen"
"Just closing flat on a day like today is an accomplishment. We’re still working through the share overhang from lockup expiration and all the people underwater from the 40’s. There’s room for steady gains from here, but I don’t think we get over 30 until after the next earnings report."
"My fellow PLTR comrades,1. I spent time analyzing the PLTR trades in the last hour between 10:30am and 11:30am2. What I noticed is that almost 90% of the trades are for 100 shares3. In other words, The VAST MAJORITY of trades are small 100 shares4. Where are the BIG BOYS and institutions buying 1 million shares, 500K shares, 100K shares...5. Are the BIG BOYS done buying and loading the trucks BIGLY in $23 range?6. Is this a sign that PLTR will be going up?Peace?"
Anyone else expecting a power hour to begin again today?
Reddit boys are back!!!!!
yep... we made it... tomorrow green at minimum 28 but may see 29 in my opinion...
"PLTR has no debt, 90% assets are in cash. 2021-2025 will generate over $20B in Revenue. What will it do with all of the cash?"
Btw..........what part of America or the world are you in? North/South/East/West parts of America? Foreign countries?? GLTA......
I’m betting at 5am PLTR will trade at $25.25. Don’t sell and take advantage of this drop to add more. Any announcement of a multi million dollar account win and we will be back in the $28’s $29’s maybe even low 30’s.
And who did not expect sinking today?
"While nasdaq rises, this trades sideways. While nasdaq plummets, this plummets!"

Thanks whoever sold me their shares at $23.80. Heading out to the course. See you all later. Remember just mute the  just like you would a telemarketer.
Bought it at 35... contemplating selling it before losing it all
Question guys. I have 20 shares of Tesla at a cost basis of 400$. I’m up about 61%. It’s my biggest holding. My second biggest holding is palantir and I’m extremely bullish on it too! My cost basis on palatir is 25$ at 200 shares. Would you guys consider selling some of my Tesla to increase palatir?
"Pretentious shorts acting like PLTR is crashing. Look around. Nasdaq is down -2.46%. Every major tech stock is red. Compared to the beating that other stocks have taken today, PLTR did just fine today."
OMG the sky is falling. Send in the clowns that I haven’t muted yet.

Look last time when Ark bought shares in 14 of January... they bought 500k shares in 14 of January and Palantir goes up 50%.... they bought 1.6M shares yesterday...
"35 by the end of this or next week, probably some consolidation and then fly"
"Keep an eye on Nasdaq.... Correlation between PLTR and Nasdaq...Now, Nasdaq is up 410 points... ==> PLTR up 5.3%"
Amazing results and more to be exposed in Q1 and you guys are selling? I think we’re not listening to the same presentation 
Bruh it’s down cuz of the Nasdaq. Why do you think a company like Microsoft who’s had its best earnings went from 245 to 229. Everything is down. Palantir is down because the market is down. It’s poised to soar. Don’t worry
Anybody think we'll hit $30 by the end of the year?
"I have 15,00 shares at $39. I ain’t worried this is going to $200 by next week. Trust me"
Im getting about ~$3000USD in tax returns in a few weeks.I am fully intending to dump the whole thing on PLTR.Someone talk me outta this or im going to do it lmao.
deep red in premarket. i am not sure how long i can hang on...
Why is it that every time this gets momentum SPY dips and it takes PLTR a week to recover.
"just trying to spite Cathy Woods, pltr should be at 27,jealous people, market is rigged"
Anyone else scooping up more shares of palantir at a discount?
Looks like another buy day when I get home.

Incredible resilience!!!
"It's always cute to see the people stressing and fighting HARD to make sure the price of PLTR at the last 2 minutes of the trading day go up by 5 cents or less...Is there a reason why there is this ""last minute fight to push the price up?"

Where’s that beach Cathy Wood?
"More contracts, more partnerships, more revenue = more shareholder value."
"Good qtr. What is happening here is there was massive short covering and some accumulation on the run to 30 twice. Now, banks are selling shares short and skimming just like retail shares in the lows 20's and lower. The fundamental story is in tact. It's amazing how strong the algo's are on a put insurance and bear controlled day where the flooding of shares overpowers correction buy in opportunity. I have seen it 100 times. Game changer of a company. Big Winner."
i am 16 years old and i have a crush on Cathy Woods. please help what should i tell her?
"Just bought 200 shares at 29.44. Hopefully, it’s not to late"

"10 year treasuries are so shorted that dealers cannot even find them and short sellers are willing to pay the 3% penalty rate for not delivering. Imagine, being so confident you are willing to stare down the Federal Reserve who is buying billions a month. Someone has an inside scoop and see a major move, obviously this means to you that your future returns on PLTR will be discounted further, reducing the share price further."
Who else caught Palantir on CNBC Fast Money? Every trader said they’d invest in PLTR.
I wish he had kept his mouth closed .. attacking Tech industry & Silcon valley .. granted maybe gave him points for his military contracts ... But didn't make him any freelance gains in Public market... just saying & I have the stock not happy...
Still incredibly low share price....considering the future. I'm a buyer for the long term. Glta....
Bought another 1600 this evening... 4300 now. Live long
"I have said it before and will say it again. Palantir, AWS, IonQ make the pillars of future progress."
"IRS needs a HUGE contract with PLTR!! Nearly, 1.5 trillion dollars per year in tax dollars is not being collected because people are under reporting income from their various businesses and pass-through businesses. By collecting the income tax which is due, this could eliminate a lot of our deficits and help to fund infrastructure and other social programs such as health care and education. A powerful big data software program could eliminate this fraud through cross-checking peoples various monetary accounts. It isn’t fair when half of the population is paying their taxes and the other half is skirting their civic and fiscal responsibilities. PLTR could help bolster our fiscal picture improving our quality of life and increasing our national security at the same time."
Called this earlier this week about it hitting above $25+ on or before EOW.
We shall see that we won’t ever see anything under 25$ again today! That was a hell of a drop the past few weeks! No PLTR is ready to explode!!!! Back to 45$
"20,000 shares. Down 170K. When are we going the moon guys?"
"it's first jump from $9 to $30 was followed by a pullback all the way to $23. We then hit $45 and have been pulling back since in an up and down pattern between $31 and $38, once it breaks the pattern upwards after earnings it'll eventually be up past $45 for sure."
"This is probably the most talked about stock on WSB seems like everyone is going to buy long term which is good news ,we will see ."
gonna be ling term for sure maybe 10 yrs ir more
Loss was because of stock compensation. Still +30% in revenue. Worth the buy at open IMO.
Long term this is a great stock. Buying more and holding!!!!!!!!!
"Keep these things in mind:1. The USA Senate has received the stimulus bill approved by the House2. March-14-2021 is THE DEADLINE to pass the bill make sure that the American people keep receiving unemployment and help...3. WAR NEWS: Israel may attack Iran because of 3 things: ...a. An Israeli commercial ship was attacked in the Gulf of Oman (Middle-East)...b. Israel is blaming Iran for some Oil spills in Israeli waters (Blaming Iran for this ""environmental terrorism"")...c. Israel wants the USA NOT to go back to the Nuclear Deal with Iran4. Finally: WAR = MONEY = PLTR stock goes UP5. So, the next 10 days will be interesting...6. Now you know!!!Peace!"
Bought 600 more shares come on Wall Street bets
"This is panic selling by insiders. Nice vote of confidence in the comapny, huh?"
"Sell, keep selling, true believers don't care."
We should get a fairly decent space here!
I am singing.... PLTR To The Moon!!!I can see clearly now the rain is gone.I can see all obstacles in my way.Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind.It's gonna be a bright (bright)Bright (bright) sunshiny day.It's gonna be a bright (bright)Bright (bright) sunshiny day
tremendous upper pressure after hours closing. if you are in the stock yet you better get in early Monday morning pre-market hours. this is the temporary bust out move this is a temporary bust out move to the upside due to CNBC analyst projecting upper movement short-term too many people agree that it's going to bump up Monday so get in early it may bump up again Tuesday I'm looking for a minimum of a 34 based on Goldman Sachs projection they're going to make sure it gets the 34 probably going to see 35 and then come back in 33
buying back started
You buy a stock with huge volume. This is her good stock to own The action will be where the volume is. We still could close 27
Based on SNOW's ER report it shows how undervalued PLTR was (another post on this board highlights this better) but because of this new info - Cathie Woods bought 2 million shares for ARKK and 660k shares for ARKW. If you are a long then buy and hold and continue to buy the market crash price. GLTA
plenty of spring I t his to get to 28.35 maybe tomorrow or whenever soon
"My target for this is 50-60... it will come, but you will have to be patient"
We'll be back up to where we belong - 35+ in no time
Added another 100 on the dip

the 30 year bond is heading to 2.46 % all this is technical and has nothing to do with inflation.
Haha 2% up. I love it. Slow and steady. Nothing to see here day traders. 
"Guys, did they say on the call that the stock comp is one off event? I didn't catch that part but I definitely got the future project with Lockheed and other weapon manufacturers."
"Well Well ,,, GREEN ,,,,, ‘SURPRISE’"
when you wake up at 4:30 cause you know it's PLTR earnings

$65 by April 16 based on the options calls.
"1. Staff selling after lock up period is normal. It is their bonus, which they waited for years. 2. Stock is down due to meme traders who panic sell and trash talk all day. 3. You panic but and you panic sell and you shout scam. Get a life.4. Day trading and leverage is a sure way to lose money. There is a reason why apps like Robinhood CLEARLY state that.5. Yahoo finance is completely ruined by you people. Can’t even find descent opinions any more. 6. Just can’t. You are absolutely exhausting."
I only have 4 shares and I get so hyped that I’m profit 10 bucks ahahahahahahahahah yay me
Uptick coming.
IMHO there will be a big contract announcement in the earnings report.
what a ride today; picked up another 500 - doubling my holdings.
oush
The bears need to leave it’s not happening pltr is corrected and at a stable price.
we need Republicans to fixed the market
"This is dead money for quite a while, several insider sales as well..."
"In 12 months, PLTR could be trading in the range of $80 to $115/share."
Put your trust in the Lord. Jesus saves. JESUS SAVES!!! ￼
j.wieder and serg1011 are same accounts trying to pump this stock.
"Added to all my major positions these last 3 weeks, down 33+% since February 9th.When others panic, you buy & hold.All these red is irrelevant, the market grows in the long term regardless of whatever “sell off” these “experts” are currently talking about.They count on your weak hands. That goes for everything, not just PLTR.Appreciate the $22-23 range we’ve had these last few days though, I’ll gladly take the cheap shares.This is a long term hold, short term movements are highly unpredictable, embrace it"
Bought in at the IPO. I'm not going anywhere!
Short are fleeing -38% so far!
Hmm looks to me this is a little oversold wouldn't ya say?
Cathy Wood added more PLTR & DKNG and both are down. Now is time to buy and hold!
A tech stock that has already been corrected - perfect to rotate into and buy now.
https://cathiesark.com/ark-funds-combined/trades
lmaooooo over 50 stocks in my portfolio and this is the only one green right now
It’s funny to watch the bears post on here because they also don’t know how to spell or anything about Palantir... at least act smart!
"Market seems down in the stocks I frequent, besides having great taste in stocks, do you think it’s in preparation for the Fed’s comments?"
I have been wanting to write some covered calls but I can’t bring myself to go against it in the short term.
Hearing chatter about WSB Reddit all talking PLTR. Hmmmm
"Stimulus package rally next week, take it to the bank."
go pltr
Don’t miss the boat to 30 in short term.
Another green day. Nice.
wow
I like this stock. It will be a turbulent week coming up but in the not to distant future this will rise above $40....
Options open interest @26+ for next week is unusually high.
What’s your guys average and shares?
Somebody is continuing to buy ah.
Don't forget Karp's interview on Cnbc next Tuesday !!!!! 10-11 am
Even with the increase we got Friday there is still a lot of upside to this stock
"Stimulus In, added more shares!!!"
"it's cheaper than when i sold it in november.always wanted to get back in.ibm cloud venture in pipeline,many government contracts,best data analytics software on the market.and ive just jumped back in cheaper than cathy woods.happy days"
"Did Cathie buy more pltr today, I bet she did one smart cookie"
Going under $20 before it climbs unfortunately. Will climb next year
Arkk has 9.8 Million shares now (1.0%) I guessed right she's loading the mothership. Arkw has 5.5 Million shares (1.67%)This woman is working hard for us. I liked her story of the newlyweds that thanked her for recommending Tesla in 2019. Cathie even paid for their dinner. The reason she gets up in the morning she says. One of the few heroines in the industry.
Added 1k to my 401k account! Again follow the volume! 7 institutions loaded up again today billions worth of shares.
Thiel and Karp unloaded their sjares at these prices almost everything they had.
"I added shares of PLTR just now, buy asap and hold for long !"
"People who are short sellers and newbees let me tell you this “its not only pltr which going down it is the whole market going down because big companies are investing in bond yields that is why bond yields are going up and stock market is going down. Furthermore, you guys please check all bond yields all time graph bonds never go high in long term it always go downwards. So why big hedge funds are buying bonds because the are balancing their portfolios and for the good interest rates they do this all the time but only for short time period. So please stop blaming companies use your brain do research about companies as well stock and money market and then invest. As far as my knowledge the market will gain in 2 months”."
"My $1,400 stimulus check didn’t show up in my bank this morning but my $6,997 IRS Tax Refund did, Whoo! Whoo! Buying PLTR at these bargain prices with it!"
Did you all noticed that yahoo is repeating the same news over and over just to say that has fresh news!
"For 4Q 2020 management said 27%-30% YoY, realty blew past these numbers. Q1 guidance 45%, it will be past this number. 2021 over $1.6B. Every qtr this 4 yr target of $4B will look ridiculously too conservative."
Red... red... red.... all the time
Palantir Technologies Inc. is down 5.97% to $22.52
"Exited out of my position at 28. Please be careful, and make your own decisions based on your analysis don’t take what a persons opinion as gospel. Be safe "
Amazon will be using pltr in all of there cloud function
I LOVE THE TEARS OF BAG HOLDERS!!!
6 minutes until the buy orders flood in
"A large short position means they have brought down the price already, when they start covering, some will wet in their pants when they see a $5-$20 jump in share price IMHO."
"If ARK is staying in, I'm staying in."
"My youngest employee asked me if she's going to get a $2,000 stimulus check every month from now on. She also wanted to know when I was going to pay her $15 per hour. As it's rare that she shows up on time, and frequently asks to leave early or work from home, I bit my tongue and smiled, then said only time will tell. We're nearly $30 trillion in debt, which equates to nearly $100,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. We've spent over $5 trillion on COVID related stimulus bills so far, which equates to around $41,000 for every single tax payer in America. We're giving people more unemployment money than what they earned while working, and telling them they don't even have to look for a job to get it. We're giving families that make as much as $150,000 a year stimulus checks. We've spent more on COVID, which for the most part didn't even represent a significant threat to our children, than we did on WWII! Our country is in deep, deep trouble."
This is basically a war against Cathy Woods. Wall Street wants to burn her because she did so well last year. Buy the stock for the next couple of years and you will be well rewarded
I kept buying the dip from 38 $ now I'm -36000 loss i am not sure how much more I need to buy the dips
"Come on, let's see some green"
pltr is going to predict inflation
"I sold. You can thank me, it should now go up from here"
I’ll be buying more tomorrow 
Why is PLTR down so much on no news??
75 percent if pltr ownership is retail..do yourself a favor and enjoy yourself. dont waste your money on this
"PLTR is goes up for one reason. It was over shorted for no reason. It is a great company. PLTR losses is mainly employee stock compensation. It is an one time thing. PLTR goes up not because Cathie woods bought. She and her team great at understanding and analyzing tech companies. She is ultra transparent in her trades where other hedge funds do all sneaky tactics and afraid of front running their trades. Mark cuban went on TV and said, why analysts go out on TV and say short this or buy that. They are simply creating demand. If that is a company, they should just buy. Cathie does that. Most analysts have no clue of understanding tech. They are just number crunchers and do some DCF stuff."
"The market is reacting to the bond market, and the bond market isn’t making much sense right now. In any event, the Fed isn’t going to stand by and do nothing. Everyone should know that by now. They’ll stop at nothing. That means more liquidity and continued low interest rates. That might be bad for the dollar, but if you have good stocks, so what?"
Pre-Market looking good for PLTR. 30 and below will never be seen again.
Where do you all see pltr end of year? 5 years10 yearsThank yiu!
This rally is BEFORE all the free money gets put back into the market. Think about that for a moment.
"If PLTR below 20, i will sell my kidney and buy more shares"
"If it cost $4bln now it would make sense. But $40 bln - Sorry, but No!"
"Wow, that was exciting. I picked up a bunch more towards the end."
I would not be surprised if PLTR closes at $35 today.
"This company is one of the few in this era that has built such a strong foundation contracts with Amazon and the government this will one day grow to a Lockheed Martin and even bigger because of the public and private contracts Queen Kathie knows this, be investors not day traders and"
It would be nice to have a good day
"Very happy to have bought yesterday. I waited patiently and we now have a nice base formed around $24 from which PLTR can soar. We have a great company with excellent revenue growth, huge institutional buying, and a massive market. Will hold and enjoy the ride!"
I bet it’s positive today
"Palantir is the stock to watch.Youtube video today, already has 5,430 watchers!""Why Palantir Is A $1 Trillion Company"""
TO THE MOOOOON!!!!  
"Got in @9 and @25. Holding 2522 strong. Worst case, it won't go down from here. Best case, anything over $395 gets me a cool million. Not bad odds to play if you're long-term (5-10)."
35C 4/16 any chance ? I’m down 270 bought in February for 330
My account is bleeeeeedinnnngg holy jesus man
this going to 40-45$ next week
"Inveating in Palantirs AI Software is investing in the might of the U.S. Defense Deartment, Federal Agencies, Local Law Enforcement Agencies, and top tier companies that make the U.S. what they are. Palantir is a company that will help secure the U.S. and assist top tier companies with logistics, operations, and finances. Only major company with data integration on the scale that Palantir has and is constantly improving is Google. No reason to short just for a few dollars."
"I see Palantir going down to the 22-24 range where I plan to scoop up large and by EOY we should see $35-40 range. There will continue to be a bit of volatility as expected, but it will continue to make gains in 2022. I can’t even think of the next closest competitor in the space, likely C3.ai that’s trading in the 120+ range."
"Oh man, we have a wonderful president why the market keeps going down :))"
I trust cathie!
"Man, if Powell does nothing about the SLR exemption we could see some dramatic swings. Unbelievable."
All those panic shorts are claiming pltr to be the next GME for no reason 
"Cash grew 100% Dec 2019 to Dec 2020. PLTR guidance of $4B will be way short of reality, will be closer to $8B (44% ave growth). Generating over $20B Rev 2021-2025. The CASH holdings will be above $5B by 2025."
Stimulus passes and Palantir will get tons of new government business...
"Karp just won the hearts last evening,It’s real long!!!"
"I love it. A retail-turd day traders nightmare, but a long term investor’s dream."
Added more troops to the battlefield @$21.40Next week gonna be superb 
Price targets for Monday?
"PLTR, a good place to park money b/c none of us are selling."
ARK certainly loaded up on PLTR today. Hopefully the value they see starts resurfacing in the stock price.
Hype stock. Without the pumping of Ark it would be worth about $5. Just look at the float.... omg
"Just finished my Zero to One audiobook! Never been more confident in this company, it's management, leadership, and structure, or it's outlook."
No panic. Just buy
Great buying opportunity...see you at 100...longs game
Company news?
"It's climax time baby.... Thank you for flying with us here at PLTR airlinesWe are now cruising at an altitude of $25We do have a few minor headwinds ahead of us, but we will soon turn off the seatbelt signLet's make some Mother F... money..."
recovery progressed faster!!! We are heading to 27 to 30
"3 bucks to 30, move it!!"
More buying opportunities
"This is just the start longs! This will be a multi day high Flyer, will see all time highs very soon, could be end of this month or early next month!"
Palantir is creating the software that will empower users and businesses like never before.
Realistically how high do we think this stock can go?
Will sell my shares at 150$
Whole market is red but Palantir is up. That should say something
Exhausted from accumulating shares of PLTR. Now the waiting game. Let’s go!
got my limit order on $23.5
"Guys the worst is not over yet, on March 25th you will see the lowest point off this stock, save my comet and remember me on 25th"
Holding strong
"$30 calls for June are cheap af, bought some at close"
"I guess if there's going to be a run-up to the next ER, you better have  's to hold. We'll see who does."

"I'm $1.3m into team Palintir and 100% confident they are a game-changer. I used their software in the Marines and it helped us gather the data to map, target, and disrupt terrorist networks. Now I am a management consultant for a large business solutions firm, and I have seen the #1 challenge large organizations have is consolidating data from multiple systems, and in disparate formats, and drawing the insights to make executive decisions, without data scientists. What PLTR appears to have created is close to data-management magic. This might drop 30% after the ER, who knows? but it is definitely a game-changer and I have no doubts about their long-term prospects. GLTAL!"
Palantir Technologies I announced Friday its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with Amazon cloud service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be available to all AWS customers.
Check out Diligent Trades on YouTube for his Palantir Technical analysis. Dude spent $15k on leaps and says it will go up by next earnings
Time to cost average down?
This will fall fast now on the ER
"I got in at $ 30.00 and I am holding, and buying more. I believe in this company."
Cathie Wood is all in: https://youtu.be/3-Cdq_13Osw
Just buy and hold...patience anyone?
So happy about the insider selling this past week. This dip is a blessing for all young investors. I’m holding 3000 shares and buying another 3000 at close. Goodluck longs
"Bruh! NASDAQ is down almost 3%.... Of course, that's not good! That's life. This will back up soon!"
Looks like shorts are working really hard to move it down but I know they can't and wont be able to stop the stampede.
$100 within 12 months. Thumb up if you think it’s supported.
You can tell this will skyrocket after earnings next week because of the lower price they forced so they can get in because they know it’s going to be good 
"It’s the panic sellers who sold last Thursday and then bought back Friday, now they’re scared again. "
"Kathie Wood doesn't have a crystal ball and she is not the stock goddess. Peter Lynch lost a fortune in the early 2000s, Warren Buffet lost a ton of money by betting against airline stocks last year, George Soros lost nearly $1 billion in 2016. You shouldn't invest in stocks if you are the type of investor who buys a certain stock just because someone (Kathie Wood in this case) bought 500,000 shares of PLTR. You need to do your DD and take advantage of the momentum to make money in the market. Based on my technical analysis, PLTR's next support is at $22-23 and $19.75. Also keep in mind that Kathie Wood's 1.5 million share is nothing compared to 800 millions shares soon to be go on sale."
WSB is no longer playing in PLTR as it has an actual product unlike GME and AMC lol
Vanguard added 1.5 Mil. shares to it's mid-cap growth ETF VOT.
Where’s the Reddit buyers?
anybody else love this stock?
Board full of negativity = Time to buyBoard full of positivity = Time to sell
As I wrote - Judgment Day today -10%.
I betcha it's back to $25 by Thursday (or sooner).
"I give up, sold all shares, really do not like it stays read when market is green."
I see lots of comments mentioning about the shares that were sold by some of the management members. Some people claim that if the company would be more successful why they already sold these share with the cheap prices. All those shares are given to them with the cost of 0 $. They sold them around 26 $ which is 26X up. So I am here to simply ask those people who keeps asking. Would you not sell your shares with 26X ? the reason they sold is not because they do not believe in the company's success.. only because they sold it with 26X profit.
I think Cathie is doing her thing this afternoon! 
"Wow, Cathie bought quite a bit of our PLTR... Palantir Technologies (PLTR) - 3,365,400"
Where are all the shorted people
I wish to all shorts a creative and productive day! Your posts here are every day the same since September! Looking forward
"The fact this held up like this today, whether we finish slightly red or slightly green, is extremely comforting in a time where consistency is hard to find."
"Is our next recession on the horizon with increasing rates, shutting down profitable industries like drilling and oil, and also increase cost of doing business for small businesses by increasing minimum wage to $15? Thoughts?"
This market is an emotional wreck. Filters through the good news to dwell on the bad.
"Picked up 200 more shares here 22.51, at support. Tomorrow will be interesting."
WSB will join the party?
the only stock currently green out of 24 on my watch list....
Am I correct in saying the last 20% of the shares ‘locked up’ will be released today?
just read what may be the best article written by seeking alpha about pltr. it was about valuation and expectations it was in my opinion honest and accurate and I'm pltr or bust
26 lmfao get some vasoline its coming
This is an amazing company for long term. +100$ within 1 year easy
Don't bet against Mama Cathie
Why is it falling!!!!! It needs to break the resistance and go over 25
VIX and PLTR only green today.
When is PLTR next earning date?
At the gym
"A lot of you guys have mentioned that information is ""the new oil!"" And I agree 100%"
If people cant see the manipulation when a stock opens at $29 and hangs in this range despite 150 Million shares trading you are BLIND or short...To have the 10% pre market drop continue to stay steady throughout day despite that volume and VERY bullish guidance tells you all you need to know...This is institutions parking the boss right here given what they heard today is categorically more bullish than even the last earnings call...
been holding 4k shares for quite awhile and won't be selling for at least 5 years.
$26.50 = resistance?
"Trade smart, place sell orders GTC at $65 Prevent short sellers from using your own shares against you"
The 30% guidance for 2021 will be met in Q2 earnings.
"I'm salivating at this buying opportunity, if it keeps dropping, that's a huge buy, if it pops during the day, that's a huge win. either way, it's a win win"
Bought the dip and im almost all-in in PLTR now
It seems that the average volume of 72 million prior to lock up has returned. Does that signal that most of the insider selling is over and we can anticipate continuing 72 million shares traded on average daily.
I'm happy for this weeks result. !!
Just got back in and couldn’t help buying more at these prices. I’m bringing my average up since starting at DPO but that’s ok by me. PLTR is about 13% of my portfolio. I might stretch it to 15% but that’s about it for me.
is this a good stock for long term?
"I have full trust with the CEO and the company, i am holing my stocks tight!!"
"IMHO, PLTR is about as low as it's going to be in the short term. Stochastics look oversold below the 20 mark, there is something close to a bullish pin bar candle, and the 100-day moving average just kicked in and is at about $22.70 and rising. So you have oversold conditions at a longer term moving average and a candle showing bearish sentiment is slowing down and being overcome by bullish sentiment. No promises, I'm not a financial advisor, make your own decisions, but IMHO I think it is more likely the share price has a several dollar increase on Monday than a decrease. Longer term, I hope everything is done with this correction soon but I also get a bonus in March so I wouldn't mind getting a bonus at the bottom of a market correction. How long do corrections usually last?"
Whisper ATI and Facebook contracts
Remember when you bought MSFT at $24? PLTR is deja vu all over again. Thank you Yogi Berra!
Tech up tomorrow Buy Buy Buy PLTR!!!
I got faith keep your heads up 30$ by Friday. 
you can't keep this stock pressurized for a long time. it will jump soon
"I see no comments from anyone on this thread who sound like they have any investing knowledge at all. No legit arguments to own this thing. None. Instead, I see a Bitcoin mentality here. I see people who treat this stock with the same gambler's mentality most people would have while playing the state education lottery, or playing slots. Take your money and go to Vegas. You may have a chance of getting rich there. It's not going to happen on this bet."
Have you guys seen the open interest on the $26 call for this Friday 3/5?
this is obviously gonna blast off I'm buying more here
"This is being led purely by algos and not actively-trading pros. Which makes the risk / reward risky prior to earning. Depending on movement after Powell on Wednesday, I may sit it cash for a while."
With all news it should be around 45 now 
It is becoming more stable! And soon to da moon!
go on whale wisdom and look at the 13F filings for Palantir from yesterday. Do with that knowledge what you will
I get all of the long term talk but honest people will admit that it’s disappointing for the market to have been up all 3 days this week while we have been down each of them. Come on already and give us a good green day.
"After Hours it was all PLTR on CNBC! First on Options Action where the whole panel was bullish - and lots of bullish options activity. They also featured an entire segment with the founder of Thinknum, an alternative data company that tracks trending companies on Reddit's Wallstreetbets - and apparently PLTR chatter is up 30% yesterday. Could be the next Reddit darling (for better or worse). Lots of these players love PLTR and anticipate a big pop."
Well someone got pumped up by YouTubers and now holding the bags? Like #cciv*this is for entertainment purposes only
"Investors in Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 16, 2021 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
Ark bought another 2.5 million shares
"Thanks to whoever sold me their shares at $24.50. There’s always panic sellers out there. Going golfing. Have a great day. Oh yea, just mute the "
"True longs cannot lose tomorrow. If it goes up, great, if it goes down, buy. This is one of many ERs."
65M in 1st 3mins!!!!
"I hope everyone $ cost averaged down today. Here's how it works. Everyone on this board is an individual investor. The Pro's goal who works for the hedge funds take advantage of chaos in the markets. If they unload millions of Palantir stock, it can really move a stock down. This causes the individual investors to panic and then the bots take over and drive it down further. However, when there is blood in the streets, this is when you need to buy. By the time the market closes today, Palantir will almost be back over $23 and the Pro's win again."
"Can someone explain to us how the WallStreetBets crowd can make PLTR go To The Moon?This is what I was able to learn from the GameStop drama:It seems that WSB geniuses were able to buy GameStop stock cheap and HOLD it in order to LIMIT the available GameStop stocks. In other words, Less available GameStop stock = Higher PriceHOWEVER, the PLTR stocks that are available to the public = 1.07 BILLION stocksSo, the WallStreetBets crowd doesn't have enough people and/or assets to buy and hold PLTR and make it a ""scarce commodity"" = PLTR stock can go up to $250 like GameStop?"
Congrats to the strong holders and everyone who topped up yesterday.Cathie Woods endorsement is the only thing that needs to be said today.
"PLTR is a growth stock that won’t be affected by yields. In 3-5 years this will be $250-300 per share, $500bn company."
Buy the dip. This is only way to have profit in future.
Take off!!! Automotive partnership!!! Flyyy to mooonnn!!! Let's goooo!!!
Palantir is now the go to place for big corporations to save millions of dollars and it's working. This ship is going to sail.
I’m selling now tomorrow will be disaster
Thumbs up if you honestly think we end green today.
US Stimulus package that passed on the weekend will put more pressure on teck stocks this week for sure. Don’t be surprised to see an other dive in the next couple of sessions.

Boys and Girls: The TECH stocks are now turning GREEN...
Leaked video from an hour ago.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc2LEsNtm10They're aiming at Salesforce's market share.
"My fellow PLTR comrades,It seems that between 9:30 am to 10:30 am, there is a lot of PLTR stock price fluctuationsMany commentators seem to make PROFITS by selling HIGH between 9:30 am and 10:30amat the same time, there are many other commentators who BUY LOW during the 9:30 am to 10:30 am timeframeI understand that it's HARD to time the market, but is there a SECRET ART on when to sell HIGH and buy LOW...In may case, I obviously want to hold until the mid 30's or 40's at least (depending on what PLTR good news and contracts are coming)HOWEVER, in my specific case, looking at the charts, my portfolio is currently GREEN, and there were at least 3 chances, in the last 5 days, to SELL and make PROFIT... then I could have bought LOW again and I will still be ahead...It seems that BUY LOW and SELL HIGH is an art for some traders with GUTS...Please provide simple insights on how to maximize profits using the BUY LOW and SELL HIGH strategy.Peace!"
$29 and $30 are the resistance right now. Support seems to be holding at around $28.60
How about a -10% today? Huh?
Should we be panicking? Great numbers and we are red?
"As I’ve been preaching for months (go ahead and check ), remain patient.Nobody can predict the short term movements of PLTR, you see “too the moon” and “on its way to $5” every day, all full of .This is a long term play. Buy the dips, hold when others panic, thank me later.I know a lot of people’s portfolios are tech heavy nowadays and are hurting, hell my portfolios hurting since February 9th, doesn’t matter in the long term.Sit back, relax, and accept the volatility for what it is."
I smell 30’s this week
"If bashers are so confident that this stock is in a bubble and will crash immediately, why aren't they taking out loans to short this and make easy money?"
"OK, who's dumping?? Speak up!!"
"Soros Fund Management, which revealed in November it began investing in Palantir in 2012 and owned 18.46 million shares, has said it will sell for ethical reasons. The firm said at the time that it had sold all it was able to and “will continue to sell shares as permitted.”"
dare i say 35+ tomorrow. bond yields retreating. lockup over. earnings good. jnj vaccine approved further fueling positive economic outlook. looks good to me

Hopefully Karp was successful in his message to the retail-turd day traders that this is not the place to be. Go back to GME and AMC. That’s where the quick action is.
Easy money. $ 100 on Monday.

What’s with the after hours activity
Bets against PLTR are closing in AH today
Goldman upgrades Palantir !
this product is not tangible to the average consumer. This is a B2B product. What you guys have is Cathie Wood and wall street bets to keep this going. Wall street bets being the bigger contributor to help prop this palantir up. Long run this is going up. FOR SURE. It's going to be a looooooooooooong run though. Like I said this is going nowhere and when it goes nowhere it trades sideways and downwards.
just patience !
PLTR = the new TSLA
the stock mkt is coming to an end soon...
The whole market is down. I blame GME.
oh yeah 28 tomorrow
Tesla heading to $409
To da moon we go
Too many pltr shares out there
"The BEARS OF WALL STREET just did a hit piece on PLTR to create a SHORT ATTACK. For all you SHORTIES out there let me remind you of the plus 70 billion dollars losses you incurred with GameStop. WALLSTREETBETS are monitoring this stock, so please short it so they can take another billion dollars from you. It warms my heart to see you suffer such massive losses, KARMA a @#$&."
The new partnership will be a really big deal. Imo
"For the new guys around (shorts), This stock had bounced multiple times 40-50% up in 1 week easy.Its gonna bounce soon and Aunt Cathie knows it that's why she keep loading up.Follow the money not the clowns. Recovery is coming soon."
Holding until $300...PLTR will establish a whole way of valuation in time.
This selloff will make selling after lockup less attractive.
I'm down -27% on Palantir which is only about 50 bucks thank god i did not put more money into this.

Hi Palantir Investors Does anyone have an intelligent and professional explanation for the stock's behavior yesterday? Sharp decline during trading and pre-closing correction?
Who's adding shares today??
It's also a RED DAY so this selling is expected since most of the market is. so in other words this is on sale and load up while you can!
Nasdaq futures reversal spike off double bottom. 10 year retreating. 10 year step up not ominous. Bullish long term for markets (the bond bears know it because it is basic market theory). Inflation is GOOD in economics. Too bad the low IQ’d commenters on this thread understand the game worse than I crochet (I‘ve never crocheted). Sorry. Sleep tight and wake up early if you‘re short. Real early. Ferarri going to be fun when it hits its straightaway. Adios Pelota
Plummeting to $24 now....
They need to meet growth expectations provided last quarter with path to profitability. If that happens during the next earnings the upward momentum starts. If not we move down further.
"I saw Catherine Wood interview today. I really like her and her 40 years of experience in this industry. . My advice to those who want to buy this stock to wait for signs of short squeeze to get in as we don’t know how low it could get. My warning to shorts is, having seen her interview and her prospects of PLTR, i warn shorts, don’t mess with Catherine Wood!"
"It can close now, I'm happy with this price today!"
Huge manipulation today

Cathite wood interview about Palantir https://youtu.be/atjQcRXX-NI
What’s powering this move up? Not complaining but don’t see news.
I’m buying the “upcoming” dip — obviously
So many etf’s added pltr in funds.
I have never been so sure on a stock until now!! I have decided to hold all my 1.2 k shares also after the lock-up!! There is a high chance that they will announce Facebook between 16-19 so the institutions will buy more and nobody will sell!! Think about this..
ARKW - went from 4.04 million to 4.15 shares. I believe they added today on the dip
Today +29$

How long until we $45 a share again?
"Many have been saying that we will see 20 soon... I believe that it depends of today's chart. If it ends between - 2% and +1 %, believe that we will see it reaching 20s. If wee see a jump over +5% well, hehehhe! My friend! We will reach 40s soon!"
GUYS ITS GREEN
Don't sell any shares until after the 2024 election. That way you don't have to pay high taxes on your $300 stock!!

"Wizard Saruman is looking into the Palantir crystal and see's an incredible future. He see's $30, $50, $75, $100 and beyond!!"
"I had purchased at 24.80 but got out once it came up and hit 25.01. Then I went around and lost money on other stocks but because this one had gone down, I was able to get 100 more shares of this than the last time. Back in at 22.82. Let's go for a ride up."
CATHY WOOD IN THE NEWS!
This is getting into bear territory. Everyone might just have to hunker down and wait it out. Averaging down might not be the wisest choice at the moment.
"Hmmm. ARK holding 2.4M+ PLTR in their Next Gen Internet ETF. They loving throwing away money over there, don't they?"
waiting to buy more on red open
I just bought at 37.80 is that a good move?
the thing about powell is he says he doesnt know what will happen but says there will be temporary inflation. what is that

If only it was not correlated with the nasdaq etc. it would have been already 50 usd.

Cathie Wood Thinks PLTR is The Next TSLA - Just Bought 5 Million Shares!
Be careful with this market. We lost our market cheerleader and this administration is extremely depressing. Wall Street is trying to get rid of the retail investor. Hold or stay out for awhile.
Crammer Lol! You can tell that he is really jealous of Cathie Wood's success.
"Sorry, but the down trend continues. Wait 'til it reaches $11, then buy."

you heard it from me first. mark my word it's going to bump up to the 34 based on Goldman Sachs projections they're going to make sure it gets there just like downward pressure with the shorts. it'll probably hit 34 maybe 35 and then bounce back down on the 33. getting quick Monday morning free market before the Reddit Robin Hood GameStop players jump on board and push it up even higher

Cathie Wood just loaded up 3.4m shares more for ARKs
Why would anyone think this is some sort of bottom and accumulate shares at this level? PLTR is showing weakness and a dip into the teens is not out of the question.
This is a 3 year hold minimum stock
I don't know what's harder - holding throughout the past month or no-nut November.

Suddenly green AH
"My fellow PLTR holders,I have been watching PLTR Pre-market and I noticed a few strange behaviors:1. There are MANY trades where people are buying ONLY ONE SHARE of PLTR2. There are MANY trades where people are buying 5 shares of PLTR3. There are hundreds of trades where people are buying less than 50 shares of PLTRQuestion:It seems that the people who buy just ONE SHARE of PLTR are paying a ""higher price"" ON PURPOSE in order to somehow TRICK the market that PLTR should trade higher in the $24 range...Are the PROS using this ONE SHARE trades as a TRICK to manipulate the share price?Peace!"
everyone buy NOW u are missing out on a buy like apple but way better. this is gonna go to 400 in 5 years BUY NOW

Well that was an eventful day.

"As I said before, Facebook and Apple are now recruiting people with skills in palantir. It might mean something. I truelly belive that Facebook will use Palantir services soon.

If you have some knowledge we all know this will hit 40-50 this year.
Hey guys. Where do you guys go to see ARK’s daily acquisition of shares?

Notice how Amazon and other software giants are scrambling to secure government contracts. Palantir already has those locked in.
Teaming up with AWS is huge!
Let’s be honest. We all saw this coming. Believe in the company long term and this will be a blip
I love investing in companies that have great CEO’s like Karp and Musk. Hence why my portfolio is 60% PLTR and 40% Tesla. I like investing in winners.
Bought 9 calls for a break even price of $39.....good idea or no
will buy at 20... I find this to high.
"Follow the money people, not the "
Clearly there’s some big players loading up on shares today. Otherwise we’d be red just like everyone else
You want price to keep going up? Pretty easy... STOP SELLING for some penny gains and high taxes..
Could this go any lower? Or was that the dip?
3m deal shows you what’s going on. ... pltr once it’s in your company it can never leave. Gold mine.
In my list of 60 stocks. PLTR is the only one positive.
"Big buyer at $25; however, when they're done buying look out below. Meanwhile, the insiders are still selling."
I need to lower my near-term expectations for PLTR not to be disappointed over and over again every day...

I'm officially own 2K shares of PLTR again! 1K at $25 and 1K at $22.84. It will spike up to $31-$33 when the trend is back up.... if it hold on it will go to $50. Diamond hand is back!
Lock up expiry will yield little in terms of movement. Early investors are often smart investors. Smart investors don't sell shares at 40 when they know time will fetch triple digits or better. These are not hourly workers that need the cash.
Is this going back up to $30 anytime soon?
The loss has decreased from 29 cent per share to 8 cent per share in one year. The Q1 revenue is expected to rise by 45%. No way I sell a single share of a company with such amazing progress.
wow i think we actually slowed this down on the downside so lets get up
Great comeback even after all the negative news.

"Ark is the reason for everyone who owns PLTR became poor and PLTR employees got rich. On the day of expiry, Ark buys large number of shares pumping the stock up, raising everyones hope for a higher price, buying more, yet PLTR employees enjoyed the hike in the price and sold driving the price down. Everyone under the sun knew the stock will take a big hit, but they listened to her because supposedly she knows her stuff well."

"The captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Relax and remember that if you own 1000 shares, unless you sell you will still own 1000 shares. Good luck."

How low can we go

"$40B authorised investment to the energy sector by the US government. I have upmost confident that Stem will receive a large portion of this.

My top conviction stocks right now are $STPK $SFTW $PLTR and $CCIV once the Reddit losers get lost."
All in 2500 shares
"i bought more, thank you newbies."
It would help if someone could contextualize how meaningful PLTRs contracts are with IBM and Amazon. And explain how it translates to revenue. I know Alex is setting this up for monster gains as they sweep into the commercial sector. But it needs context. No reason this should be in the low 20s because their bread & butter isn't tech - it's B2B - including value stocks which will benefit from a strong economy with the help of PLTR.

Palantir DPO'd at 17 Billion out of pure generosity to retail investors and these Wallstreet crooks could have loaded up like I did. Why do you need intelligence when you have a ton of cash, financial weapons of mass destruction, and an algo time machine that just bum rushes at their time of choosing..."
"$25.08 is the bottom, this could shoot up at any stage and back to $29 within a few hours. I have shared every one of my buys of Palantir since started at $9.90 and I have added more today and last week when it was at $25. ARK has identified the bottom here and I am happy with that assessment too.Insiders have sold a very small percentage of their holdings and I would too if I held for many years in a company I have contributed so heavily to.Do not wait for this to drop below $25 because I personally do not see it happening.Remember, you are buying the company, the product and the management.

"For those who care about such things, a reverse head and shoulders of sorts seems to be forming."
I understand how Peter Thiel and Elon Musk think!!!!
Cathyjust sold Tesla and bought more PLTR
This is like watching anime! Every week a new episode!Every week a new partnership 
Must see this three hour long brainstorming on Palantirhttps://youtu.be/daQ45sU_dtw
Anyone registered for the Chicago exec. interview today?
"10,500 shares with 31.06 average :("
im gonna take my ole sweet time to think about whether this isna good company to invest in for the long term whenever that may be
"Wow, it really gets going now"
Today’s closing price: 27.1
Is it Christmas tomorrow? It sure sounds like it.
Serious question? This has 48 billion market cap. Blackberry 6 billion. My opinion go buy $BB tommorow.
earnings looking good...
Up 10.5% in Deutschland. That‘s Germany. Careful shorting game changers. Look: ptx.de
Palantir looks good in green. She wears it well.
"Everything that Peter Thiel touches turns to gold - PayPal, Facebook and Tesla.Palantir will be the greatest of them all."
"This is a great LONG term investment, but is WILL trade between the $18 to $30 range until the next quarter. People stating it will shoot up to $40 - $50 in the next couple of weeks are dreaming. If that's the case, don't you think insider would have held it for a bit longer? Again, it may pop to $30, but can easily drop down to the high teens with negative economic events. The first quarter that shows strong growth will almost certain propel this above $80. But, it could take 2 more quarters at minimum."
"Thanks for the discounted shares...In for another 1,000"
"Ok, who do I thank for selling me your shares at $27.60? Don’t be shy. Chime in."
The lock out period ends in three days is that true?
"Market is having a tough time and so too are most stocks. Technology sector being the most popular is even down. We are in the middle of a correction and this is normal and the perfect time to load up on stocks, especially stocks you see as long term investments which PLTR is suited for. Any short term gain stocks are a no-go unless you get lucky. There could always be a rebound for us worried investors to be happy about, we just don’t know when or how long this correction will last and when our stock picks will follow up. Either way don’t panic and think you made a bad choice. We will see PLTR and all these other stocks rise up and rise up quick. We just play the waiting game"
I am a certified bag  holder. please go green tommorow.
"I actually hope retail investors flock to PLTR.. WeBull, Reddit, RH groups - you are welcome to buy up stock and ride the success of this great company. No need to let big institutions get all the gravy..."
27 hedge funds and institutions bought billions of dollars worth of the stock this week and last week! Check their 13f filings on Fintel. And today Ark loaded up again 3.3m. Cheapest quality stock in the market. PT 100$
"Look up Luke Nosek- he owns 93 million pltr shares, is part of the PayPal mafia AND sits on the board of spacex. Very promising, and there are less and less shares available for trading for every passing minute. "
"No matter what anyone says, the street has decided to not like this stock for whatever made-up 'social-justice' drivel so it just needs a hard non-nonsense catalyst that the street cannot ignore and then, as if by magic, all the 'social justice conviction' will just float away."
Look at this little gem the whole market is down and this is green. it sector especially down and it's holding this line that means it's a great investment.
"According to seeking alpha: Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is scheduled to announce Q4 earnings results on Tuesday, February 16th, before market open.The consensus EPS Estimate is $0.02 and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $301.07MOver the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 1 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 0 downward."
Is this good buy?? Big float is concerned
40$ in a day or two imo
I’m selling all my stocks in the Nasdaq and buying Palantir
It's funny how newly baked user names are pumping PLTR and same on downside bashing it
Putting all my tip money into pltr 40-120$ a day about
Will be $100 plus eoy
The big boys like myself woke up early because of Powell speech so we could dump our large quantities of shares before dummy retail investors wake up.$NIO $BNGO $PLTR $GEVO
"Shoutout to the true PLTR longs that have been encouraging people to hold steady during this volatility .We got us a strong group in this forum .Check the comments, I’ve been preaching this to y’all since DPO lol. PLTR is a huge moneymaker long-term. Ya just gotta stay patient"
This is the last chance before surging above 30 all the sudden!
Verizon and AT&T possible deals ....
My first post. Bought 1000 shares last week at $24.5. Sold DIS and AAPL for PLTR. 30-40 before July?
"Great technology, badass attitude and even outrageous hairstyle, you’ve got to invest in that"
"This could be the best investment of 2021. Come back in January next year and find it over $100. It bounces around, it goes up, it bounces around some more then goes up some more. People will call it a missed opportunity."
PLTR seems to be gaining momentum. First it catches the eye of Cathy Wood from Ark Investment and she purchased millions of shares consistently for ARKW & just recently 5.2 million shares for ARKK. Goldman Sachs increased PLTR to a buy rating with a price target of $34. Then JP Morgan Chase bought 19 million shares. Anything else I missed?
probably more share will be sold the coming month by more company top people
"Funny how these longs are soooo excited that PLTR went up today and only recovered what it lost yesterday. And it took the Nasdaq to go up over 450 pts to make it happen, LOL. If it goes up that much every day for a week, they have a chance of hitting 30...maybe."
"Someone that explain why this stock is down when nasqad is up I saw Tesla, NIo and other texh stocks are down thanks"
PLTR has been outperforming NASDAQ for several days. Passed inflection point!
"I believe what we are seeing is a tax season sell off. There are a lot of people who entered the market this year and made some money, and now that its tax filing season, they are realizing that they owe taxes, and the only way to pay them is to sell some stock."
"Shorts, quick! Time is running out for your prescient, ever wrong comments!"
40M in the 1st 30min...impressive
Bears don't understand PLTR business and potential!
"Invest into the future, money will come back to tech bcos the post pandemic world will only be driven by tech."
Why down ?
"If you're a true long, the best thing to happen was PLTR to miss on its earnings. If they beat, the stock would just be frothy and lockup shareholders would feel compelled to sell and shorts would short en masse.PLTR is growing revenues at a extremely quick pace, and that is what matters. 30.00 bucks seems just rightfor the time being with lots of upside on the horizon. For all intents and purposes, this is a brand new, young company, that has refined its products. What a client list!"
in at 37 with 2000 shares will be holding it till 75.
this could be multi day thing better get out buy back 17 or 15
"As of tomorrow my portfolio will be 100% Palantir, 1340 shares all in, they say don’t put all your eggs in one basket but never been so addicted to a stock!! 5-10 years hold to be mortgage free"
longs will have to hold the bag for LOOOOOOOONG time
"Long term investors know that an investment in PLTR is an investment in US national security and in top tier US companies. No reason to sell but excellent opportunity to buy the dip. PLTR will be a giant in the defense, government, and private sectors"
oil shock
10 Minutes for a run to $25 Call holders. This would be a WSB legend. But GME is their god.
talk about resistance level...
I added wish we could get a dip to buy longer .
"Remember, investors have options to sell at $45-$50. Shorts don’t have much option. They have to cover! Good luck shorts."
"Didn't have the balls to buy the dip when it dropped to 21. Lesson learned, always listen to Cathie mama and never look back."
added
I love how this slowly grows. I’m not made of millions but this stock let’s me buy in gradually as pay days come. Everyday I expect a huge spike and count my lucky stars I can buy in at the mid 30’s range
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-akin-gump-collaborate-legal-115900132.html M. great news
Bought so much on the dip. I love it.
Free fall

hello April
"“JPMorgan invests in private stock trading venue with Palantir link amid demand for pre-IPO shares”... this could take the stock over $35 this week!More positive catalyst will come soon including some new clients, PLTR is a definite hold till it touches $100.. good luck longs!"
$ 30.00 and below is a very good price if you are in it for 3 years and longer.
#Palantir has entered a six-year strategic partnership with global automotive industry technology leader
is anyone else concerned at the amount of outstanding shares for this company?
Big money is trying to run down the stock to enter big time. Idea is to hold as this is going to be a life changing stock.
Monday..............wow! GltA
RIP...The blockbuster of video games is up 60 percent today and this is down. F this market.
Was today's market an indicator of beginning of 2021 recession due to rising interest rates and inflation??? I feel like a really terrible stock market crash is coming soon but I hope I'm 1000% wrong. sigh..
picked up some more 
"Its obvious that Cramer is in someone's pocket, probably Andrew left."
I am going to put my head on the block and say that tomorrow is the big day. This is ground zero - up from here.
300 millions shares trading today?
I'm better than ANY fund manager on Wall Street. Proof is in the pudding
"Palantir is the new Tesla. Tom nash bought it, Kevin bought it, chicken genius bought it, Cathy woods bought it. All mentioning that they found some leaked data and detailed research on the company. Amazon, IBM, 3M partner Palantir within weeks, there must be something out there that is yet to announce. Everyone is afraid to invest because they do not really know and understand Palantir fundamentals, but if wait till you would understand it, the price would be at hundreds as layman will would invest in it and it’s too late. Give a thought, the feds invested in Palantir for 13 years, 13years ago I’m only 20 years old! Palantir is The Best Bet you could take it on now. Just imagine with 500 shares and per share is $400. Just imagine."
"Catalyst 1 q 2021 forecasts 45% growth yoy , back to $40"
Anyone thinks this might go below 20 by next week?
team up with AWS and this is falling almost 6%...
I have an average of 21 USD and held all the way from 45 until now. No weak hands let's go!
Its gonna be $100 soon after..
Looks like investors are buying the dip!
if you listen to cramer and base your investing decisions on his advice them oh boy circus medrano will happily hire you congrats !!!!
can't believe $ocgn recovered back to premarket drop while $PLTR $BNGO $NNDM Tanked hard and in a state of injury.
22.50 a good entry point
bought 250 at 10 and 250 at 43.51.......... and some iin between total of 527 shares!!! this hurts!!! butIM NOT LEAVING
Oh $pltr will be $90 EOY!
"What’s up with the volatility of the 10 year Treasury? It is hitting this market hard, especially Nasdaq/tech stocks."
"Only PLTR is green today50 %of portfolio goneJust wandering, how long it will continue? Why is taking profit?There is no profit anymore"
What do y’all think about Monday? 
"Foundry could go to personal besides business. Individuals are facing more and more data created everyday, one needs a powerful software to analyze the data to make personal decisions daily yet protect privacy, the business potential is up to the sky."
this is at the prices it was back in like DEC.....before the IBM and a few other deals....think about that.gonna be a great week
Forget about individual stocks. If you are panicking during this market correction. You should probably not trade at all.
"Reddit is behind the stock per CNBC!! Sit back, hold your shares and enjoy the ride!"
Volume is decreasing...
"How many people think when PLTR starts moving, it will move up fast $5-10?"
anyone knows why the stock jumped up 1 dollar this am ?
I have more cash ready. Who’s going to sell me their shares this morning?
I think this is undervalued. I’m in for 500 shares.
im still holding
is aunty Cathie buying today. any news?
The Best US Stock for the 21 Century.
Good news coming at 3:30pm today...
IM 23 AND CATHY WOODS IS HOT. THERE I SAID IT!
Everyone knows this stock is gonna be a winner. Don't chicken out and sell unless you need to feed your kids. Why pay the high taxes for holding less than a year? People who think they'll buy back in later invariably buy back in a higher prices. Don't think too much.
seller right now will be tearing out their hair later
"Thinking of buying 3000 shares here. My question is, for experienced to traders, Am I better off waiting until after earnings and the lock up.? How many new shares will be available After the lock up.? Thanks in advance for any intelligent responses."
"Just like EVERY stock I have positions in, and have had positions in for a long time (newer to Palantir) - wake me up in 3 years lol. Never have I ever let random people on a message board determine my view on a company, and thats why I continue to win. Palantir wont be any different."
Get you some of that Cathy Wood special lol.
this is the only thing on wsb that makes sense.
"It dips more, I say ""Thanks God, Im out till $15."""
"In 5 years this is going to be over $100B company....The value of company is tremendous especially when you see it is an operating system for data, analytics, AI, etc. I think that analysts are not able to understand it and evaluate it properly due to not only technical understanding but also market industry fit...It is difficult to understand that a company that started for government in the US, can be both global and support all other industry segments (where i see revenue exponentially growing over the next 5 years. I think that next 3-5 Q may be not as strong, but from there it will beat any expectations. Buy and hold..."
Are we going to have a squeeze on PLTR with wokians having to cover their shorts before this takes off next week? I think we could ...
Be ready !Tomorrow another squeeze Big winner tomorrow 
"Governments and companies with global footprints are hiring Palantir. I believe they will successfully scale globally, in multiple sectors. Proof will rely on their numbers. We shall see."
"Big thank you to crooked market and scared retail...While I have not been in love with the timing of some of my adds to my position...$37, $33, $29, $27, $25, $24...At the end of the day NONE of this matters in the long run and I should consider myself blessed to have added at any of those prices...Had this remained at $45 or above there's no telling where or if I'd have added given the run up... Started my position at $10 have 4x the shares at an average of $20....See you at $200 and beyond...Will look back to these days and realize we wasted our time lamenting vs finding ways to pump more cash in...This is not a pump, the company is as rock solid as any business in the market..Short term bashers know that, but they're here to screw with you during these fluctuations and we always knew they'd show up hard in and around lock period...Bravo to them! My position will teach me about a new decimal point the moment this hits $112 per share, then we'll see who is laughing...Stay strong brothers!"
The stocks goes down 6% and everyone is panicking. You all need to relax. If it goes up 6% everyone is hyped. This is long term play. Relax and hold and enjoy the ride.
omg wasnt even a normal.blip up..how dmaGed did krusty do
Two reasons why we dropped this past week. One is our corporate wxecs are brilliant people and they made millions by selling. So what? The second reason a more serious concern which is market stability. Honestly I’m out after the Stimulus bump
Be patient! The smart insiders waited until after Day 1 of the lockup to start selling. The next few weeks are likely going to be sprinkled with sellers. Some will wait until it doubles again. None of this will change PLTR's final destination of $1k+. Holding 2500+ strong!
buy and hold monday $40 news coming soon
Cathie Wood is losing millions on $TSLA and she will lose millions on this too. Most overrated investor in the history of the stock market.
Wow I’m bag holding at 41 fml
"hope you longholders have a strong stomach, no stop losses and no margin."
you guys do realize nasdaq futures is manipulated right to drive sentiment. hedge funds have large stakes in or out of something and they can drop a couple shares in the futures market to make you think it goes in a certain direction. jim cramer is well aware of this manipulation as he's done it himself.
@Jing Ren $22.50 on the chart (Dec 2020) before a strong quarter in (Feb 2021) confirms the value is there. We are bottomed out. Talk without a thesis beyond UP/DOWN is cheap.
"Karp tried his best to message the growth story over the next two years, the media disinformation, the freedom to be a critic elsewhere. Buy or live in regret."
$GME is fun. Keep pumping! But also consider $PLTR for a long term play
Bought 100 @ 24.18 lets see
"So, same old same old:Spike in bond yields = FEAR in stocks = PLTR DOWN...Is there a mathematical formula to this logic?Peace!"
Long term hold
"So much good news and this stock still can't get into high gear,some hedge fund is stepping on it."
I bought SBUX so many years ago at 10 a share and now 104...Thats how you profit..Let Planter sink to mid teens and sit on it...Dont panic!!!@
"in trust we Peter Theil. Airbnb is not profitable but it's a monopoly. Palantir is creating a Monopoly , I don't wanna Miss out on Gain. I'm willing to hold the bag for now. average price $29. I'm not selling will be adding more if it goes down more."
Cathy just added 3.4m shares of Palantir today. Honestly think that we're up from now.
ARK bought more = I buy more
every time i buy in the 24s it drops 
Going to gracefully bounce back this week.
Who bought the dip... again? Picked myself up 250 more
i will hold for 30 years idc! diamond hands mightt give all my shares to my grandson when im 90 and have him give it to his kids!!!!
Still holding since September.Long for 2 years my firends!!!
800 shares today at the close. Up from here.
I hope Vanguard decides to add PLTR to VTI fund .
"I don't think we can expect the same volatility as before the Lockup expiration.the float is now HUGE, it's very hard to move the price.unfortunately 40$ is many months away, if not yearsI have 2000 shares @ $10.5 which I did not sell @$40.beating my self.."
someone bought big shares this morning
I'm actually depressed. Time for an 8ball and escorts.
2500 IBM Professionals started promoting PLTR software today........ Worldwide..
My portfolio = 60% PLTR 40% Tesla 
Laughable how hard hedge funds and big banks trading teams are working to keep price from gapping higher. How many margin calls can we pick up before we ALL decide to let‘s it‘s TRUE market value occur?What a sad job they have. Create an illusion and fail at it. Fortunate to be independent and pick winners without being corrupted by greedy short hogs who shall get slaughtered like last time. Oops last two times. Fact. Chicken DinnerSee you en el caribe
after watching cNBC. it's obvious Kramer and others are conspiring to run down the NASDAQ stocks especially stocks like palantir that Kathy wood owns. they're now trying to tear her down by saying shes dumping money in certain stocks that are down because retail investors are chasing what she's buying and she's just trying to keep her ark investment numbers up. and they are pretty much saying that she is going to fail. sounds to me like Kramer and CNBC are working for the short hedge funds
Longs be like 
pltr look good now buy it forever its going to 24.68 for sure on monday
"Cathy is the same person who predicted Tesla hitting 3,000$ pre split. And look what happened to Tesla. That’s good enough for me."
We will open $123.34
33 next Wednesday
Buy buy buy !!
Let’s bottom line this. The whole goal in doing a DPO is to convert 17 years own ownership into currency. That’s it. How else would they achieve their goal? By holding another 17 years? Get real people.
"Yeah right... keep ignoring back to back deals of hundreds of million, like the one with Amazon, and listen to Cramer, meme traders."
what time today will go back to $36 ?
Added 100 shares on this dip.
Cramer who? He ones said TSLA is over valued when it was 500 dollars before the split . 
32 open....squeeze
"Yes! Buy order went through at $23. Ok I’m done buying for today. Going golfing, see you all tomorrow. Thanks for your shares."
"Not sure if we have reached a point of capitulation yet. When the pump stops having an effect, my history shows that it typically results in a slow leak as we have a new round of price discovery."
Now is the time to buy bought 10k
"All PLTR investors should keep quiet. Real investors want the price to go down, so you can buy more. Quietly ARK hoovered up another $60m worth yesterday.The experienced will make a killing in this market correction (it is not a crash). The new should learn from it."
Buy the stock
Next Week they will sign the big contract we will see $ 30 easyWatch it
Here we go As soon as I buy it’s drops Who care it will be 200$ in 2-3 years!!!Stay long my friends
"just bought 4000 shares ,i can smell rally soon"
"Palantir is going to be among the big public companies in its niche likes of Netflix, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM. Oracle. Apple, Facebook. I think within 5 years from now it will transform ""FAANG STOCKS into ""FAPANG!"""
"Most tech stocks are down today, don’t let the clowns get to you. They are just after your shares. Ignore or mute works a treat"
FYIThis steaming pile has been up a whopping 2 out of last 15 trading days
"Back to 18, don't fight it. Flying Cars Sector, total wash out today EXPC RTP EH, buy buy buy!"
"30 sales staff before IBM; now 2,500 sales staff. This is the wee early innings. Had to double my position."
Usually when the market goes down bonds go up... now the market is going down because bonds are going down uhmmm
Lift off to happen any day in next 2 weeks
I mentioned and was flamed that balancing your holdings with a couple of banks would provide a hedge. FITB bac wfc key.
My PLTR net is in green. But I won’t sell. You know what hands  I have got.
Tiger-Speedy recovery.PLTR-30-32 by Fri.Now lets make it happen.
Look what they did to Apple the last 10 minutes of trade. 17 Billion share float just algo'd to opening price in the last 10 min. Unreal and fake.
"Let's not forget that PLTR closed above $30 for 16 straight trading days in a row from Jan 22 through Feb 12. February 12th was just last Friday. As recently as this Tuesday it was also trading above $30. Since Jan 22, we've really only had three trading days (this Weds, Thurs, and Fri) in which PLTR has traded consistently in the $20s. Today's test of $30 and its closing price of $29 are very positive signs that it's on its way back to the $30s."
I love the company but the valuation is ...
Just entered my first position in palantit with 6500 shares. BEO will be 120 per share.
PLTR is the unique game changer which solves the problem world can’t!steady government endorsementunlimited commercial roof to skyrocket!
We no need shorts here go somewhere else shorts this stock is not for ya
Before the end of March this will go up to 40s mark my bloody word!

"Don't be surprised if all institutions are selling including Ark. They made tons of money,"
PLTR up up up...another good DD videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_Z5DG3eC3Y
Tasty tasty end of session dip. Thanks panic sellers. I’m ready for tomorrow however it goes. Always have cash available in your portfolio kids.
"Why buy any stocks right now, everyone knows the 10 year yield is going up and how stocks react particularly in tech. Wait until the yield rises to 2.5% then stabilizes or you're gonna get rekt."
Another institution might buy this dip after hours.
My hair looks like Alex Karp's after this week.
"Stop crying, nobody cares .. most of us here are down 20k-30k but were also up 20k-30k few weeks ago"
"I thought 20 would be bottom , but the Tech correction is not over . Looks like new Target is 15."
is palantir signing another contract with verizon or at&t or is it just the rumor spreading around just to pump it up? lol....
5.2m more shares for ARKK today
ARKW purchased 1560200 shares today...
"I dont understand the lockup period. As far as I can see, the insiders have already sold $530 million worth of shares in the last few months"
only stock in ARK ETF that's green.
"All of this media exposure will create interest in both government and private sector corporations. In addition to being tied to a strategic relationship with IBM. This will significantly have an impact on growing revenues, and, improved margins going forward. Just understand the dynamics as you invest wisely."
Palantir will be as big as Microsoft in 10 yrs.
"I adjusted my portfolio to capitalise on the market pullback. I sold 1/3 of my CCIV shares and invested them in $STPK $SFTW $PLTR $VACQ $CTXR $SPFR and $HITIFThe way I see it, if CCIV moves up I make a lot of money. if Lucid goes low 20’s / High 10’s I buy in large with my profits from the above high growth stocks.Win WinDiversification is King.A huge believer in Lucid, haven’t loved a company this much in a very long time.P.S. I also believe $SPFR could be merging with Tonal. (This is from personal DD and no official / unofficial rumours have been confirmed)"

"Someone check CovertAction please, i’m worried"
SKYROCKET SOON!!! GET READY
I love slowly up trend . Not a fake pump and dump
the downforce is strong
"Lol @ everybody who stresses every little period of green/red days so much.Been holding since $9.45 and I’ve watched people claim “  SELL” & “to the moon  by next week” every day.Reality is this is a slow and steady position to hold and forget for the next 5 years, anybody who tells you different is full of it.Nobody can definitively predict this market, especially in its current state.So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. Patience is a virtue, but it’s everything in the stock market/investing game. As you saw with GME, big money counts on your impatience and short-sighted buying/selling for measly gains.A little red day is just as irrelevant in 5 years as a Green Day or week."
JPMorgan reported 19+ million shares in PLTR... how about that bieatches...
i thought that was pretty amazing! also very positive feedback from all analysts! feeling super bullish!
"Wellness check. How are all the people saying they are going to buy back under $20, $15, $12 yesterday doing?"

"My fellow PLTR investors, 1. PLTR is teaming up with AWS.2. AWS = Amazon Web Services 3. What is AWS?4. Answer: If a private company wants to rent computers. They go to AWS and rent them by the minute, hour, etc...5. If a company wants to rent a service such as database or storage space for their massive files, they rent it from AWS6. Finally, AWS offers ANALYTICS services as well7. Since Palantir deals with data analytics, it makes sense to team up with AWS to use the many AWS services and help generate REVENUE using the millions of companies who are also using AWS services 8. Imagine if Palantir SERVICE is sold as another ""standard service"" by the existing AWS service framework.9. Maybe some of the Palantir services require massive computers and databases and storage. So, AWS is an ideal ONE STOP SHOP...10. Feel free to add/correct any of the above points...I hope this helps my PLTR homies..."
$100 today...
stock just got upgraded to 40$$
Hi guys Im new in palantir I just moved from tesla to palatir I bought 1100 share now
ARKK bought 5.2 million shares today
Im all in!
"“All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.”The frost was temporary, the fire is soon to be woken."
Institutional ownership now up to 21.9% and climbing
That’s not cool compare PLTR to GME as WSB. This is great company and has good fundamentals. Oh well market can say whatever but we know better.
"If there is a short squeeze, how high will it go?"
PLTR coming up on CNBC right now. Karp is a genius. Think Steve Jobs but for Enterprise Software. Take a look! (3 PM ET now)
We like the stonk and we have vanguard and cathy woods.
Pay close attention to the spin doctoring over Snowflake and learn how they scam. Are we worth 70 Billion in comparison? Pretty clear we are now. Cramer should answer angry investors for pumping it so sky high.
Easy hold. Sorry shorts but you bet wrong.
haha look at me i actually looked at their financials for once....they have a lot of selling and r and d expenses as well as.admin expenses with only 2 billion in cash...theyll burn that in two years if they cant get costs under control...ill dig deeper but from i can see they need a real financial dude in their not thisnsankar he knows they can be gone in w yrs so orobably why he sold the boat....i guess you have to believe theh gonna reign in costs soon or theh gotta charge more. this is not like money loosjng uber is it..shouldnt people pay if they buy a service and why is pltr selling services at a loss..absokutely make no sense to me unless they gonna start selling subs
"Tomorrow the question will be ""Who bought the dip yesterday?"""
This quite a unique software play. PLTR uses high quality datasets for it'sbreakthrough software resulting in outstanding results. This company is very wellpositioned for the future.
"I'm begging this doesn't go higher than $25 until next Monday. I get paid next Monday so plan to buy more then and I'm feeling gutted I wasn't able to load up/DCA when it was in low $20s.Regardless, I am long and bullish on this stock. And I expect lots of volatility on the way."
Look up wallet investor and type in PLTR. Never knew there was a website that predicts stock prices. After 5 years? Estimate PLTR @ $421. I wouldn't be too surprised if it even beat that.
Imagine selling PLTR yesterday.. oups
I thought things would steady after the bottoming out on Friday and lead to a good week. Sure doesn’t look that way though in the futures market. May be a here we go again type of day.
Market begining to reverse already!!
"Karp has a rare personality type, he's able to see concepts and connections others can't, on abstraction levels few can even fathom, which allows him to ""see"" far into the future with high accuracy. He is also guided by strong convictions not easily swayed by day to day concerns like shareholder sentiment, which is positive. To normal people, this easily comes of as unhinged or arrogant. To me, everything he says resonates deeply and I would follow the guy off a cliff. Of course there are obvious drawbacks - if not constantly fact-checked, these guys end up chasing chemtrails and blaming the govt for 9/11, and the only way to really tell the difference is to look at their history - are they delivering on their grand visions? Well, with PLTR, the answer is a resounding ""yes"", they are frigging changing the world to the better already (finding Bin Laden??). The only thing you can know is that what happened ten years ago, Karp figured out 20 years ago. So everything that's happening now is part of a plan, and I'm going to sit back, drink a few martinis, and enjoy immensely how the coming five to ten years unfold according to his (and Thiels) current plan."

"I sold everything...wife, kids, houses, went on margin and bought at $45"
I have added 1000 share today
"Overall, for the last month we've moved sideways and slightly down when looking at the total lifespan, ie. 6 Months since direct listing. You need to expand your scope when looking at $PLTR, I'd personally wait untill May for price expansion to 30s, and then further along I'd say midsummer for any higher 30s-lower 40s action. Bullish EOY is 65, Neutral 48, Bearish 35. With Quarterly growth 35 or higher percent, shouldn't expect too brutal of a decline going into Q2. I'm not an advisor. Just a guy with Gotham user end experience.225 Shares, 14 Call Options, with most in for next January.Holding until I'm not."
God is Man made
Today’s accumulating... is for PLTR to explode!
Never gonna sell this stock! In at $24.95
"CNBC pumped PLTR hard today and Reddit has major interest and upgrade target,this is going to moon tomorrow "
"$AMC, $GME, $BB, $NOK, $PLTR ARE ALL GOING TO THE MOON TODAY"
Not much buying at these levels which is surprising
Hey Bag holders how is everyone feeling today??

I’m probably gonna buy calls for March 19 30$ calls they’re is a lot of interest in this call and it does have the potential for next week since stimulus just passed
BOOM 27 here we come
Everyone is worried about the price today. If so buy INKW or AITXThis is about what will happen in a year or longer
"Really interesting patent awarded to pltr. Basically a Bloomberg modular for other stuff (military, government, huge companies). Pltr is building some fancy prototype for the army that sounds like this."
Interview was refreshing and I'm happy to be invested in Palantir

Like if you're holding to $50 
If Tesla signs you know GM is signing it’s a bloated bohemoth lots of data silos to organize. New to palantir look up data silos and you’ll buy more when you’re done.
200$ by 2023!!!
I looked up recent institutional ownership on fintel and a ton of mutual funds and ETFs are buying. Not just ARK but even Invesco (they outperformed all of ARKs ETFS in 2020).
"the CEO appeared on cnbc last nite ~~~ he is saying as an investor you should look at the bigger picture for pltr and sell if you are a short term trader looking for fast profits i.e. quote ""no one is forcing you to buy"" so move on and buy another stock if you think it is better.....perhaps this explains the selling today which imo is a buying opportunity agree with me or not ~~~~~~~"
Such a nice bipolar stock buy buy buy
in a sea of red WE HAVE some pretty Green

I have about 184k invested with PLTR at an average of $27.
Stephen Cohen only sold ~6% of his shares. He sold most of ONE CLASS of shares. He still has like 20 million shares in other classes. Plus he GETS MORE SHARES AS BONUSES
Let's go Palantir!
Ok who do I thank today for that delicious dip? Come on don’t be shy. Speak up.

"Short PLTR! No, not me."
Back to teens. Heheheheheh.
Cup and handle formation for SHORT SQUEEZE!!
This is the only stock that does not scare me at all when it goes down. It’s expensive at the moment but in a few years you’ll be complaining in the 100 dollar mark.
so strong ..i like pltr for the long term...but please get to 26
happy for this dip adding 5 . this can stay here for a long time so I can keep adding!
Just wait until TSLA brings PLTR aboard. Geniuses with similar values come together. History repeats itself. Good history too.
"Just so everyone is clear.. the lockup expiration is tomorrow not friday. Google it. I thought it was Friday as well, but its saying tomorrow. Tuesday counted as day 1."
Think about it. Blue Ridge Capital has somewhere in the area of TEN million shares. PLTRis a very unique company.
"Bulls never wanted to address the elephant in the room, that the Fed wasn't going to extent the SLR exemption. Yet here we are and they won't do it."
Hey bag holders just checking in how is everyone feeling?
You will regret not buying more.
Average price about $35. Holding
"REALITY CHECK:1) If you bought at 25+, this stock will be a real test of your patience 2) At 25+ PLTR was trading like it was 100% certain it’d be the next Amazon/Apple/Google3) it’s not 100% certain. I believe it’ll be it’s own thing, better than any of those companies 4) the price didn’t drop because of the lock up expiration, that was always baked in. It dropped after earnings call because the CEO of the company provided future earnings guidance that was LOWER than anticipated - thus the share price adjusted downward 5) The market is trending down. There is a rotation happening from tech to inflation resistant and COVID recovery stocks. This impacts PLTRBottom line: If you believe in this company, and the 4B rev guidance by 2025, just relax. This ride will not be for the weak of heart."
"So from of show of thumbs down, how many bag holders are still hanging onto their $45 shares??? lolzzzz"
"If you have been investing in Tesla for some years, you know exactly what happened yesterday."
Instead of buying door dash for $65B you could buy PLTR for $55B at this price and have $10B leftover. That may speak more to doordash being overvalued then palantir being undervalued but still...
$ 25 today
Get in the pool you goof ball investors. Personality of CEO has no bearing on the price. This is a gift at 24.50 or less. $40.00 real soon with this slip up Biden. Tracking needed. Buy Buy Buy PLTR...!!!
Seeking Alpha negative article again.. Basically listing every downside attribute while not mentioning the IBM or AWS growth sales prospects
cat just ran away from home. (gonna put the money I would be taking care of her for) towards pltr
"I believe in the company, its managers and its unique products. I really think these are products that will dominate in the future. The company is a consensus among investorsAnd also among opinion makers in the capital market.On the other hand, very confused.It is still difficult for me to understand the massive declines yesterday, today in early trading is down about 6%.My fear that even if it is indeed a future is bright,Stakeholders are currently operating in the stock in their favor, whether options traders or employees selling “locked” shares.I would appreciate your opinion guys"
"Oh, Yea! it's also a massive ""scam"" according to some, and this is why the pentagon gives PLTR research and development contracts."
"Love it , very stable here"
Shorts will get played like a fiddle.
Should make a run to $30 within 48 hours strong hold

"We do not need any actions for PLTR. Palantir is just fine, it doesn't need robinhoods. Just buy as much as you can it and enjoy the ride."

"Well I’m happy with a upgrade from Goldman only means the rest will follow from here jpmorgan, credit suisse, etc the hit mafia is on our side now I’m happy"
"Breaking news!It’s almost like investing requires patience and an emphasis on the BIG PICTURE instead of being focused on whether PLTR is $24 or $25 by EOD.Shocking I know, take a seat and breathe ."
"29.4% Put and 70.6% call options, which means 71% think PLTR will go up and 29% think/hopes it will go down."
Just keep buying the dip
give me a ring when it hits $14~ so I can buy in then.
The stock is up solely because the 3Y treasury auction was successful. Future stock swings will be mainly driven by interest rate expectations.
"This will bleed down under $20 and maybe into the $13-17 range. Everyone says that it is a long term hold, I truly believe that but I think there is a much better entry point lower into the teens."
"DayTraders bashing PLTR....Go somewhere else, in six months it will double."
"The CEO says in a few words, BUY AND HOLD it will pay off soon"
I thought it was going to $9?
"Do you think Cathie cares that the stock goes down a couple percentage points literally hours after she purchased? Haha get real. Watch her interview on YouTube and learn something about how really smart successful investors win long term. You heard it from Alex and Cathie reiterated it, Palantir is not catering to investors looking for short term gains, they’re investing aggressively because we are in a “winners take most market”. They’re goal is to own this space. Short term profits is NOT THEIR FOCUS. Why would anyone want to day trade a stock who’s CEO said that?Baffles me that after hearing that, people are still chasing those pennies. Oh well, my shares are safe."
Picking sure winners like this is easy. Finding money to buy them is the problem
"My fellow PLTR Minions,1. I have a feeling that the BIG BOYS are nice to us Minions on Fridays2. It seems that the BIG BOYS make their millions of dollars in profits Monday through Thursday3. However, the BIG BOYS allow us Minions to profit between 20 to 40 cents on Fridays 4. Thank you BIG BOYS for being very nice to us.5. Conclusion: Buy Low from Monday to Thursday and then SELL on Fridays for a small profit to pay groceries, gas, cigarettes, diapers, etc...6. Rinse and Repeat?Peace!"
Watch out! Pltr will turn green!
It is just amazing at how cheap this stock is.
Back to 34 soon
Get ready

What a Bargain PLTR is right now
Alex Karp seems to be brutally honest. Especially when he tells people to “go buy another stock. There are plenty out there.”He also said that he “wants to build one of the top software company in the world.”That statement seems so much more real to me now.

"Wait for the last hour, it will be interesting,..."

Thank you China for flooding the market with printed cash and driving down the 10 year treasuries therefore driving the stock price of PLTR higher.

flgt i believe is going to make a major move to upside soon.......yes im pumping but being honest. check out chart yourself do your due diligence....they just had a blow out quarter and have a high ceiling
So we had a better price last Friday before the ibm news ..not adding up
you guys aren't going to like it but this will drift down and sideways for couple months. it will go below 20. don't sell because its hard to time the market but have cash ready to average down huge on this.
"Palantir is a required skill for data analyst at AT&T , check their website!"
The people selling now in the 20’s will be buying later in the 30’s. Once in the 30’s people will sell and buy back in the 40’s etc. etc. long term hold not just 6 months but years....10 years from now this company will be a house hold name such as the FAANG stocks and prices 10X....

"This is becoming boring to watch today, maybe this is it for today hoping for another good day on Monday."
Ok so when can PLTR get some of that GME type action?
"Full disclosure, I am long PLTR. For those of you talking about a short squeeze, you are obviously not looking at the statistics of the company. Only 3.25% of the outstanding float is short (that is a VERY small percentage). There is not going to be a short squeeze. This is a long term holding and there will be ups and downs, just like with any other stock."
"PLTR is just set for a very big rebound. I still strongly claim that this will be doubled in 2 months (I am not just saying this because it is increasing, I kept saying that even when the stock sharply declined for weeks I guess some people would remember my comments ) if PLTR is not over 45$ in 2 months, I promised to give up investing in stocks. Regards"
Must close above 27.74 baby...next stop 29
"Did I write this yesterday? Yes, I did :). More to come caballeros. I will update the thread occassionally like I did with Weight Watchers (WW) several weeks ago. I will not steer you wrong. Tech Analysis from yesterday below:The peak at open today above was above it’s 5 day peak. Double top attempt to short was thwarted by 24.50 wall. Trend is upward albeit deliberate (on purpose strong algo consolidation and selling of puts). However, there have been some big buys and big short closes to test various short term ceilings.Amazon, Army, BP, Rio Tinto, IBM...just to begin with. Fundamentals are too strong - markets prevail over short sighted. Always. It is a battle for shares by institutions thus the deliberate pace of sideways consolidation.If you build it he will come.Patience."
Everyone switched up all of the sudden
29 please

I bought this last week at $38. It has been a stomach turning week but I am not selling for less than $100 no matter how long it takes. What this company does is the trend with a lot of potential..
"This dip in the market really tests the wisdom of traders. If you panic sell, you need to stay calm like the pros do. In the end, you should be investing in companies that you love and understand why they will grow. If you can't handle volatility, then you didn't love your investment or do your research. If you panic sell, you need to improve your investing skills cause there is a way to win in the stock market and a way to lose. You bought high and considering selling low? how will you ever make money? then you wonder how you keep losing money...buy low, sell high and invest in companies you absolutely believe in..."
You will see when it start to run up no one can stop it Then you will regret why you were late
"As far its volume stays above 30m everyday, this meme stock can’t make a reasonable rally."

Added shares. Long-term value here is just ridiculously underappreciated. I thank Karp for being transparent about the market and PLTR.
"Karp exclusive on CNBC March 16 = stock flies. (new contracts). Palantir Demo day April 11 = stock flies.$50 this spring.But yeah, keep selling for crumbs cuz that's the only thing you know."
Stock very strong. I expect down much lower to $20

It’s funny how the bears think that the lock up expiring is only a bad thing... they clearly haven’t read into the history of some ipos and their lockup’s...
Very frustrating. Drip drip every day. Ok just got to hang in there if your long. It will get better. Jmo
Holy Amazon!!!!!!!!!
"Been preaching the same thing since DPO day. Chill the hell out, on both green & red days, and remain patient.No, the odds are we are not going to the moon by next week.No, PLTR is not trash just because it’s struggling as the ENTIRE TECH MARKET & NASDAQ have struggled in recent days.Yes this will pass and be completely irrelevant in a few weeks-months.Some of y’all really treat long-term investments like they’re supposed to make you 100% returns overnight. You won’t get anywhere in this stock market game with a approach like that. These hedge funds have millions behind their risky plays, you don’t. Act accordingly and stay patient when others panic.-spoken as someone down over 30+% the last 2 weeks from my 2021 high, and I spent today buying more of my current positions.Patience pays off more often than not in the market."
"Alex acted like a little kid yesterday in the interview with his comments to the wall street investors, basically telling them I don't want your money, go somewhere else, plenty of other stocks to invest. Such comments will tank the stock further unless he was speaking from point of power with a good news to come out soon to boost the stock. I hope this is the case."
BREAKING INSIDE DEAL WITH TESLA ELON MUSK ACQUIRING 5 MILLION SHARES
So the dip and market crash also had a lot to do with a fiscal year profit pull for many companies. Where you see many people sell off their shares take profits and reposition. Think about owning pltr and in a year it doubles in sp... wouldn’t you take profits as well?That should explain some of this. The rest is just time. GL
The 3M win is huge. It proves that PLNT provides private sector companies with a competitive advantage. And the fact that 3M is increasing its spend shows there is measurable ROI.
"Buy, hold and then purchase that Porsche you want!!"
"Either Aunt Cathy has no idea what she's doing by buying 1.6 MILLION shares BEFORE the lock up period expires, on this red sale day, OR all the sellers of Palantir after a great earnings report, made a big mistake and are unable to see the bright future of this company."
"10% down is no big deal. I am still up pretty nicely on PLTR, and will add more shares...in it for the long haul...3+ years."
Only holding 575 shares what will it be worth in 5 yrs
Always have cash in your portfolio for days like today.

Rant over..."
Will open greeeen
Hopefully this will be the next leg up.
Not much more downside to this stock with all the tutes and the WSB crowd buying in
"Just added 800 more shares at $32.13, bringing my total up to 2,000 shares. All of my shares are insured by $40 puts. Separately, I have plenty of other puts and calls to capture the upside or downside movement next week. If PLTR plummets, I'll just take profits on my puts and add more shares. But in my opinion, PLTR has already proven that it has consolidated the $30s price level. A breakdown to $29 and below would be a sign of serious trouble. I think it's more likely that it will re-test the $40s (and maybe surge to $50) after the earnings and forward guidance are announced. PLTR continues to be undervalued in the $30s. A year from now, it will be in the triple digits."
2 weeks in the top 20 most bought stocks by Hedges funds
AT&T will be using PLTR.
Just a quick reminder: Watch what happens at 3:30pm TODAY!!!
I could be wrong.. or I could be right.. but I don't think we'll ever see $25 ever again..
Pltr comin back folks!
AT&T announcement soon.....
I am bullish on this I have half my portfolio in this. I had 100% until yesterday so sold half with the spike at even money. Just didnt like having all of my money in one stock but feel even better just having half as I can enjoy it more even it it goes down a little as I have another half to play with now. GLTA of us longs.
close green 
"ARKW bought 1,560,200 shares of PLTR today!"
Good price to enter at these rates. 28-30$ seems possible next week.
tone has totally changed of the board...means its going up
Goldman upgreaded PLTR from Neutral to BUY with 34 price target!!
"First they cried about valuation.Then they cried about profits.Then they cried about the lock up period ending.When will you “experts” learn that all the bashing you’re doing is pointless .Any long-term investor can see where this is going based on their leadership & product. If it’s good enough for the US government, IBM, and other power players, it’s good enough for me.Patience PLTR longs, patience. Scared money don’t make money in this game."
Fun day buying :) Thanks sellers
going for more support @ 26.40
good time to buy more during pre-market before it change to green.
im pretty sure this is the best stock EVER. i love karp too. reminds me of the smartest people I've ever met. NEXT level processing in his brain. I would just hand him my wallet if I met him. no jokes.
When are insiders able to sell? Today or yesterday after market closed?
But the dip and be patient. In a year you’ll be laughing
yeah ark bought 45 million dollars worth today
Volume looking to reach 20 mil higher than yesterday. These are good signs for overall health of the stock
When PLTR hits $100 I’m going to start looking at Rolexes... always wanted a yacht master
Got it at 24.90$ soo sweeet!
We succesfully hold on $28 and ready for $30 tmr
Just 4 hours left to accumulate or sell before earnings move it.
I am sitting with great pain with 500shares @35/share. Insider played big game. They have unloaded and made big profit. Security exchange should take action.
"Palantir Technologies Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he sold 757,510 shares between Feb. 19 and Feb. 23, at prices ranging from $24.59 to $29 a share. Proceeds were about $21.5 million.With the sales, Sankar now owns 2,879,793 shares in the data analytics company, not counting 1.07 million shares held in two trusts he controls, according to the filing.The disclosure followed filings earlier this week covering 2.7 million shares sold by three other Palantir executives.As reported, Stephen Cohen, Palantir's co-founder and president, sold 2 million shares, on Feb. 18, 19, and 22, at prices ranging from $25.07 to $30.03 a share. Those sales generated proceeds of about $53.6 million.Matthew Long, general counsel, sold 503,864 shares on Feb. 18, at prices ranging from $25.04 to $25.86 a share, for proceeds of about $12.6 million.Ryan Taylor, chief legal officer and business affairs officer, sold 218,255 shares on Feb. 18, at prices ranging from $25.07 to $25.85 a share, raising about $5.5 million."
Friends like I said buy at $24 levels. This is a good dip buying opportunity.
Good News : We downBad News: We down CEO interview : We downYield up : we downNasdaq Green : We down Nasdaq Red: We down!
"""This is a long-term investment"" = I bought this overpriced junk above 30 and I won't get my money back for years if ever!"
"You just need to think, are you trading or investing?"
Wallet Investor AI 1 year forecast for PLTR is $86; 5 years forecast is $331.
110 viewing.. this late.. well what is it this and when in rome... but you can't stop it... we start cooking... today.. tommorow... PLTRRRRR!
"If it really drops like this today, I’ll get out of everything else and be 100% PLTR. "
"30+ EOD, let’s make it happen fellas."
Still holding since $9.04...
What contract will be signed and when? PLTR has been averaging 2 announcements every 13 days. Next one is around the corner.
"Dont care if the price will be 20, 30 or 40 in the next weeks, in 5 years from now you will laugh and cry about it at the same time, because you’re counting the money Palantir has made for you "
It's the second most traded stock today by volume and yet the price is stable at ~$25. It looks like someone big is picking up all those shares. Perhaps this is the right time to buy.
"This stock will be bought out with six months $ 80 to $ 100 a share , the government loves this company that why you will see a buyout to strengthen a big player in military contracts"
Your missing variable in your equation : Spike in bond yields = FEAR in stocks = PLTR DOWN = buying opportunity
go up a lot please
"The truth is it’s dropping because the lock up ends Friday, so it will go lower as people sell before the employees start selling 100s of millions of shares over the next week.When it’s over, the stock will shoot right back to $40 within a couple weeks.I sold last week before the big selling started, and you should not hold going into the weekend, next Monday & Tues will be a blood bath, possible Wednesday also.Good, solid company, just not one to hold over the next week.Just my opinion, not financial advice, do your DD"
Plug  will be pulled on every stock involved. Then thousands will be in federal institutions.
Giddy-up Horsey....
Haters back off
"Place sell orders to $40Or more, this is going to fly"
"Been looking to get into PLTR , thank you for the dip ! As I’ve now bought in"
Like this post if you think Cathy Wood is a QUEEN and will bring us to the promised land (aka the triple digit club)
"For those who stomached these past 2 days, you will be heavily heavily rewarded in the future. Palantir is here to stay."
Bought 1000 share today. Tomorrow another 500 . Let’s see where it will end .
I bought at 29.50
Volume 314M+what is going on here???
Guys I’m long pltr but 100+ by EOY?? Let’s be real..
Multiple new big deals upcoming!
"bought at 13, been averaging up with every bit dip, didn't sell any. now average $24...hum, am I doing the right thing?"
"There were 62,000 options for today's $26 call strike price sold yesterday. Some person/group is expecting a big positive move today. Or they are planning on buying a ton of stock today and wanted to benefit on the options."
Are you seeing that V shape in the chart?V = Viagra...Let's hope PLTR can keep the hard on...
Just put a little or alot into a meme stock and your attention will be diverted from this slow growing (but amazing and big potential stock) and watch the drama unfold. Pltr is 95% my port but is was nice to get a break from watching it today Pltr eoy 125
I'll continue adding shares. I think we double then triple by year's end.
We will end up green! Guys!
AT & T deal imminent
"Tech sell off; This is today news. MMs getting ready for Friday for options to expire worthless. Completely rigged market. This has been there for long time but now it is at new proportions. Mainly because, Wall-Street is upset with main street making money."
Added 300 shares
STIMULUS PASSED!!!
"Alex Karp told you from his own mouth that this is a long term investment. He told short term investors to take a hike. Why are guys saying thing like ""TO THE MOON!"" ""$100 COME SOON!"" Did you watch the conference call??? He basically told you this will be dead money for maybe a year. Will this be a $100 company in two years? Yes, this is very likely. Make your investment and just forget about it. Don't look at it daily and second guess yourself."
Just got another 100...let's roll!!!!
Draftkings soaring with 46% institutional ownership and a bigger than expected loss (-44.70%)Perfectly rational.
I just started putting some $ into this. I only have 100 shares. But my goal is to keep buying dips until I reach 1000 shares. Then I plan on forgetting that I ever put anything in this company. Then I will check back in 20 years
"The market is way down, the stock is up which is a good thing. The market is up and the stock is down which is not a frustrating thing. The positive side of all this is that the stock might be creating a base at around $23/$24."
Algo pointing to $28.
bought more on the dip.this company will be huge
See you at $34 by Friday
Bear market has officially began. 2-3% will be knocked off every week for next 2 years. Hahahahha
buy. hold. chill.
"In my opinion, now that lockup is over we're going to see a recovery, $50 price target MAX next month"
flood gates are opening
"Bought in at 35. Bought again at 32. Bought again at 25. But yeah, now I'm still buying. Because I believe..."
What’s going on with this stock? Nasdaq is up and this is down. Doesn’t make any sense. They sign more contracts. And this is remains neutral. CEO sold his shares. Other members sold as well. If you believe this stock is great why sell? Keep it. But they do opposite
One of the few stocks that are up ALL DAY LONG and then after hours the manipulators drop it a dollar!? What a load of horse shhh...
i am stuck with 5000 shares at 28. any idea if this will ever go back to 28 again ever ???
Went from 100 shares to 147 & selling 30 CC... not much but we'll get there
Can someone tell me why you think this will go up to $100 in the next few years?
31 Million volume in the first 3 minutes.WOW
Shorties think they could win us :D
Karp is really a patriot. Bashed silicon valley for being unwilling to help the country in which they are protected and make money. Love this guy!
Is AWS confirmed?
"I see a news in Yahoo ""Palantir As WallStreetBets' Top Interest"", is that the reason why it went up after hours? next GameStop?"
Read the entire conference call. And you will really realize. You invested in a dynamic company. And you will be rewarded
up in Germany 6.02%
"Ladies and Gentlemen,If you sold your PLTR babies below $27, you made a BIG MISTAKE... Now, for those of us who will not budge and will not even think about selling our PLTR babies... See you when PLTR = $30Come an get it!!! $30 is the MINIMUM price to possibly return your buy call...As usual, after Noon time, we are back to $27.... Peace!"
Best of luck short sellers. See you tomorrow.
can we meet $30 today ? or at least this friday
https://pulse2.com/pltr-stock-price-nyse-palantir-technologies-40-target-by-jefferies/amp/
Not really a surge for PLTR...either way come on baby!
We might see $5 jump tomorrow! Everyone is buying. Let’s push this baby to $50!
And failed 27! Who was right?
Well just lost all my gains from last year.
"I feel bad for those who sold yesterday. Nevertheless, it was a lesson for you! Patience is key."
Can anyone please tell me? for those who are not happy about this stock - why do they always keep being on PLTR'S BLOG and always trying to comment badly? those who are smart enough will immediately find out the real answer. you can spend your time on other stocks if you really think this is a bad investment. DO NOT ACT LIKE A KID YOU SHORTIES COME ON !!
Aunt Cathie is back ........... Could hit back to 45 in a few months.
"Ramses where are you? U, #$%$"
"Palantir, Anduril Team Up to Develop Tactical Ground System Prototype for Army"
Imagine selling at 20-22. 
I'm happy with a daily increase of 3%
"The chart is favorable, $29 is the first target most likely early next week."
"Next time this dips below 24, I am increasing my holdings. I've seen enough to understand how this is playing out. This stock is going to be like TSLA, Parabolic for the next year and maybe forever. Remember when everyone was laughing at TSLA and how overvalued that was, yep just like that."
Come on let's get going already?
"I'm buying modest amounts of shares at various levels: 10, 20, 50 shares whenever I can. It adds up going forward. One day we will all be looking at $150 plus per share."
$PLTR options are damn expensive 
"In October Lonsdale mentioned that PLTR will be very, very profitable in a couple of years. It will be!"
"PLTR is a great company to invest in. for now, my account has gone down $42,000 in PLTR. Am I scared? None at all. I will make $70,000 if it go back to $40. But I won't sell it then. I will hold it for years. This is my chance to retire early. "
"$100 before the end of the year in my opinion, no doubt!"
This is when Catherine Wood increases ARK investments significantly
had my opportunity to buy in at $25 and i blew it ...
Very interesting post from a former engineer at palantir on Reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/

Tesla contract next $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

"I wonder how much this contract is worth? These guys are NOT small. Many haven?t heard of them but this is a big customer.Founded in 1997, Faurecia has grown to become a major player in the global automotive industry.

Guys! Palantir is on sale right now! This is a great buy point! $40 by March 1.

"Palantir time is ticking, dip won't last forever.Palantir has dozens of open jobs worldwide, hundreds of job postings require palantir skills.Funds are buying, while clueless retail is selling. Major catalysts March 16 and April 11, plus new contracts announcements in the interim.Ready for gapping up."
Went from 230 shares to 310 today:)
To the moon Alice lol!
I like this stonk
In what world would you want to go to sleep NOT owning PLTR shares? They drop news on a regular basis and once WS is done loading up this train will no longer wait for anyone.
Gonna be huge next week
"LET ME REMIND ALL THE PALANTIR INVESTOR:When this stock was trading over $33 there was not a single negative comment or a dislike at all in here, All these negative comments you are seeing are from short sellers that are here for a quick buck.IGNORE THE NOISE! This is a great companyAverage down if you can and hold for long term to make 2X 3X on your investment.For short sellers, remember this bounced from $23.5 to $40 in 1 week and it will do it again and you will run to cover. Its a matter of time.Good luck to all, enjoy the weekend"
27 close or more
Don’t panic over numbers.The target on this stock is 60$
Market will be record green tomorrow where PLTR will spike $28-29 easily!!!
"Just wondering when the PLTR leadership exercise options to buy shares at zero dollars, are those just created out of thin air and added to the float therefore diluting our investment?"
"Someday, all the right investors will own this stock and it won’t fall any where near these levels. It’ll be over $100 a share."
"Under 20 coming. I'm better than Cathie, proof was today ;)"
"I like the stock, I also will bet you this moves positive 10% today"
What a buy!!!!!!
"Ark over 62000 purchase today ,look at AH going up"
"If you haven’t already, subscribe to Palantir’s YouTube channel, Follow them on Facebook. Help the brand"
What would Cramer say if he had bought PLTR?
This boy ain't right.
Its going up in heavy volume..
whats a good entry price
"I guess that Ramses has now gone back to Egypt, Mario_111 has returned to being a video game, Elon Bezos has just smartened up and shut up, and Covert Action is now so covert, that he actually cannot find where he has hidden himself."
"Having just read over the transcript of the earnings report, these seem like some very impressive facts and figures. Eighty-four percent margins and 30% compounded annual growth over the next four years are nothing to cry about. From last Monday's high of $39.22 to today's low of $28.00, PLTR has seen a -28.6% decline in just one week. It's possible that the end of share lockup might send it crashing down to $23 or lower—but that would represent an additional -20% decline from what is already a heavily corrected price level. Today I took profits on some puts and repositioned myself with new calls and puts at even better strikes and expiries. I haven't bought any new shares today, but I might do so soon. I currently own 2,000 shares, and I'd like to double or triple that amount this year. If the end of share lockup sends PLTR crashing down to the low $20s or high teens, I will start adding as many shares as possible.A year from now, when PLTR is trading in the triple digits, it would be nice to be sitting on 5,000+ shares."
"With those vols, I guess this stock is heavily traded by day traders."
"Ladies and Gentlemen,We have reached an altitude of $24.We are now going to try to beat the headwinds..."

"Morgan Stanley downgrades PLYR and then double down when the price drops. Now they are hiring palantir analysts on their job website. “CRGT is seeking an experienced and highly motivated candidate to manage the Palantir application architecture and data within Morgan Stanley. The ideal candidate is a hands-on and detail-oriented architect-level developer with strong communication, coordination, and data analysis skills. Demonstrable expertise working on large-scale and cross-firm initiatives, interacting with technology and business use case owners, and vendor management skills are all required for this position."
"Last dance, last chance to buy!"
Today +25$?
65$ by april
Amazon partnership confirmed on Twitter
Sooner or later: PLTR will blast by $45 on its way to $175 plus.....
"6 year contract? lol, do some of you not comprehend the bullish sign that a business in todays economy is willing to go into a 6 year agreement? That is an eternity but should provide some understanding of just how powerful this software is. They wanted price lock for 6 years because they know the price of this oil (data/AI) is going UP as demand for it increases.$55-65 by end of year. $150-250 by 2025Those who can wait until 2030 likely have $350-500 and that’s potentially modest."
The 3m contract yesterday was clouded over by the Federal reserve deal. It really should not be overlooked that PLTR made Millions and Millions of dollars yesterday closing this important deal. A small rally is in order. Not a decline in share cost. Uptrend confirmed
"Growing revenue, a new deal just done with IBM and you're going to sell? lol."

"Well, good morning all. I like to come in a little late so I don't have to sift through the juvenile and moronic posts in the mornings. Anyway, looks like the morning dips are getting shallower quickly as expected. It should be green by EOD if you believe the charts and historical movement. I know the overall market is moving all tech right now but it will recover nicely. Just be patient! GL and God bless."
This is a $100 stock in 9 months
I love all the negative sentiment here. You all know what that means?
"Behold, the total sweep of calls from $65 to $25 by Friday. This is a legal practice by WS. To sell contracts and manipulate open markets with trading machines."
Don’t mind me. I’m just here to do my GIF poster muting morning clean up.
25 all day long? What's the significance of the number?Hundreds of millions of trades...yet it stays locked in at the price...days like this u know the market is rigged

"The stock came back to pick you up. Don't miss the opportunity, LOL."
Why did Cathie Wood buy AHEAD of lockup? Makes you wonder.
$29 so close to being in the money
For the bears. Palantir has been profitable you just don’t see it Q3 earnings - one time direct listing fee of 800 million Q4 earnings - decided to invest more on there workers for their hard workAs for q1 of 2021 lol prepare yourself
"up or don't care. cash on the side to pick up more. been holding for long time. we know the drill. Long time play boys. hit 20 no problem, hit 15 no problem hit 45 still no problem"
Amazon grabbing a sure growth partner to grab more of the cloud market. They were first in that business and lead Google and Microsoft. I'm impressed. IBM was first and Amazon wasted no time to compete. I'm expecting Oracle to jump in next very soon.You guys think Microsft Azure will play ball? Google even?
when will george soros get out? really want him outta this stock. didnt he said he will sell when he can? ill feel safe when he is out

"It's obvious that printing 100B a month is not enough to keep Treasury yields down. The Fed needs to bring in yield curve control and print whatever it takes. If it means trillions a month, so be it."

"ARRK investors received notification (I did) that they purchased 1,560,200 shares of PLTR today, they must be more than confident in PLTR's way ahead! This stock is one good partnership being announced and immediately jumping north of $35, get in at these prices."
$27 is huge resistance
"Hipster stock $8,99."
"Got in at 25, good enough"
pltr couldnannounce somenbuy backs please
Great discount!
okay by 4:00 p.m. today this stok will be in the green along with the NASDAQ probably be up 150 points..... watch
If it breaks through resistance at $30 we are smooth sailing.
BAAAAM!! Hello 30!!
"Pltr turns green, we all know how hard it is when Nasdaq is down more than 1%"
"Is PLTR becoming a go-to company for climate change and striving to be carbon neutral? BP, PG&E, Faurecia, etc. tracking supply chains inefficiency and ways to streamline processes and offset carbon consumption."
I bet all those bashers from the last 4 weeks feel very smart waiting on the sidelines right now 
$65 stocks are traded at 29 bucksWhy not???Super Sale??????
Way Oversold....
Karp is right though. short sellers ruin everything. you have to think about long term investing
"Many people are saying that this stock is going back to 20s....this is a thing that I disagree! The actual price now is undervalue! If we see a new contract this week, For sure we will see it over 45.We are just waiting for news...Not going back to work 20s!"
Cyber Security Hackers be careful! Palantir is coming to town

"Good investors don't care about the day in and day out of the share price, just keep adding to your position and in 5 years you will be looking like a genius!"
"Wish i got in lower but screw it, im sure at some point Ill reflect on $24 as a “sale” price"
I'm a lomg for at least 2 years. These prices are a gift from God.
Pltr will get the energy grid deal in Texas. That’s a no brainer.
Buy as much as you can afford. This is short term pain for long term gain
THE best CEOs don't care about being rich.
"As predicted the dead cat bounced back like the rest of the market. What's important is how this valuation bubble will handle slower growth, operating losses and the upcoming Nasdaq meltdown."
CEO ripping on face book right now 
I’m more than happy to buy more 
"What we are looking for tomorrow is not necessarily the earnings but Palantirs forward projections, in light of a very active few months, I think a few surprises may be announced too."
"No matter the price you, you still own the same amount of the company."
$45 soon
This will hit $30 this week easily after that is anyone guesses.
"My next entrance is $22.84. That should be the bottom, if not we are dead for awhile LOL"
"Cathie Woods like PLTR , add more !! this is a long hold ."
YessThis is a huge contact
"Instead of throwing his anger at wallstreet, PLTR CEO Karp should look at mirror and anger at his own board of directors who unloaded millions of stocks last month when it was trading high!"
Being patient makes you successful 
"Guys listen my words, around June 18th you will see this stock at 55 dollars!"
Bears can’t even tell you why they think the stock is bad...not selling for a longggg time.
Flying high! To the moon!
"Looks like the market is finally waking up from a drunken state. Highly speculative stocks, such as $PLUG, $FCEL, $BLDP, $RUN, $BLNK, $WKHS, $SNOW, $PLTR, $PTON, $FSLY, $ZM, $W, with no real prospects of good long term earnings, but astronomical valuations, are crashing! Long term, earnings and valuation always matter!"
Suzanne Orman says this is a buy!
"after any conference with Jobs, Gates...the shareholder was immediately rewardedlook at PLTR DOWN DOWN DOWNguess the management is very good, technology the best but f...communication"
Told u it was gonna go green this is the longs time!
"Wouldn't it be nice if $25 is our new low and everything from here is up? The lock up really didn't shake the tree too much today. Smart share holders that were able to sell today will wait for the real money coming later. Unless they were strapped for cash, Why would anyone sell PLTR at $25? We all know by EOY that it will be considerably higher. The future of PLTR is extremely promising. I am holding my 1600 shares like a roll of toilet paper in a pandemic. P.S. Please say a prayer for 2.5 million people in TEXAS that are effected by the storm. No water. No power. Sub Freezing temperatures. It could have been you just as easily."
"Yahoo Finance won't post the Amazon Partnership. Ironic we let them data farm our sentiment, while they feed us bearishness."
My dog after watching Alex Karp’s interview a couple of days ago...
everyone buys one share to get this to $25
PLTR sees Q1 revenue up 45%
Closing in on the $27 call strike Mar 12. Watch it climb.
"Anyone who is bearish on Palantir probably has never read or even heard of Zero to One - one of the best business books ever written. I'm pretty sure Thiel wouldn't have started this company if he didn't have something special. In fact, I think it is going to be quite funny in a few years when Thiel is hauled before Congress and has to explain why Palantir is not a monopoly, while Senators are reading direct quotes from his book to him. I will be watching from a beach somewhere on a remote island."
PALANTIR'S next target will be above 45 $ Make a note of this
Every down turn. I am buying more.The CEO has convinced me that this company if the future of software.
Back down to $25 where I’ll buy more.
If you people sell this stock your going to be mad in June......as in mama June.
Good stock bad market situation. Simple as that. Bears please don’t try to act like you’re smart and make up reasons as to why it’s declining. People are scared and selling because of a correction or market decline. Once this is over this will rise considerably
Added some more at 29.3I’m happy.
"shaking weak hands very obvious,and based on volume so many weak hands are gone already"
"Got another 500 shares to increase my position to 3,000 shares. "
Expected revenue between $ 327m to $ 350m against analysts expectation of $ 304m
"Check the daily chart, you will see that PLTR is going up every other Friday. And if it’s the Friday , the following Monday will go up too."
I don't like this stock as ARK has it. If she sells out this goes to 10. I don't want to take that chance.
Buckle up.
"This Faurecia partnership is a lot bigger than most people realize. ""Faurecia is a French global automotive supplier headquartered in Nanterre, in the western suburbs of Paris. In 2018 it was the 9th largest international automotive parts manufacturer in the world and #1 for vehicle interiors and emission control technology. One in three automobiles is equipped by Faurecia.""Revenue: 17.52 billion EUR (2018)"
This is the worse stock to own in a tech correction.
$200 by end of 2030
I think we will reach 26 now.
This company's name is from Lord of the ringsI think its good sign
AI is not the hottest thing roght now as earnings have been dissapointing...itd be best for pltr to sell itself as a software that does a lot ofnstuff. instead of AI
This seems to have settled down at the $25 range. Just about all the Tech stocks and companies that shot-up fast are getting massacred yet this is holding strong. That a very good sign. I added more today.
Shorts reaction!
actual EPS changed???it looks like 0.0678 instead of (0.08)anyone can verify it?

"Just bought more at $32.69. Like I said a few days ago, PLTR will trade sideways and consolidate for a while. But you will make far more money by buying and holding instead of trying to sell at the top and buy back at the bottom. PLTR is still in an uptrend."
"This should be trading at the highest P/S ratio in the game.The fact that it is not is a beautiful opportunity.The world is going to be unrecognizably different in 2030. China will likely surpass USA in GDP.Rewatch the palantir scene from LOTR. There’s an important reason, even from an investor standpoint, to understand why they named the company Palantir."
got my stimulus and tax return money. added 101 more pltr shared and going to work now and will be adding my tips that i get from work to pltr too
"Just bought 4K shares , this is now my largest investment. Did I make the right move guys"
"Hold the line, $30 here we come"
"Everyone on here is bashing like an expert but fails to realize the NASDAQ is down 2.5% and the S&P is down 1.5% Ya thanks genius, obviously every major company is going to be down today Whatta surprise. Pltr will be fine. This company isn’t going anywhere."
"Apple, great earnings and trading side ways, ￼ peloton great earnings but sold off because of demand issues, Palantir sells off after great earnings, Twitter goes higher and barely beats earnings. This is the market we live in."
"Cathie ""Diamond Hands"" Wood"
"Shorts are so funny, go ahead and short $27 and recovery your lost at $30 tomorrow haha, or shortTesla at $3,500 per share haha...."
"In the same breath Cramer says PLTR ""...is a very good company."" Only questioning a quickly ARK increased position. One minute he says it's solid, another minute questions why invest so much. My guess is he wants in at a lower price before Q1 earnings."
i listened to those shorties and sold all my PLTR positions yesterday. what do I do now?

The company for people who don't bash America!!
Like = BuyDislike = Sell
Amazon AWS news is bleeding through the wires and MM are still shorting. Market manipulation.
Buy the dips
Today we are manipulated by market makers. All charts are following the same intraday pattern.
"My fellow Palantir comrades,Hold on to your PLTR stock because:1. PLTR has virtually no competition2. PLTR worked on its software for 17 years3. Think of 17 years = Gathering specific requirements from the government, DESIGN, CODING, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION, etc...4. Any competitor has to deal with a LOT of time to try to catch up with PLTR5. Google is SCARED of the fact that team (AWS + IBM + Palantir) are now working together to Bring down the Google house of cards (DATA is what Google collects from all of us)6. There is a possibility that Amazon or IBM may ACQUIRE Palantir for 100's of BILLIONS of dollars7. Many people don't know what Palantir software does. Here are some examples:...a. Many businesses have millions of customers' DATA located in many files, databases, and profiles. ...b. Palantir will gather this historic data, analyze it, and actually tell your sales team that this customer will be ready to buy a $25K car because his/her current car is old and historically this person NEVER spends more than 30K to buy any car....c. Palantir will tell your sales team that this person prefers to fly United Airlines and goes to a Beach vacation during the month of July. So, your sales team will be presented with a nice offer to fly to Virginia Beach, with United Airline, Hotel, and free museum tickets to Virginia Beach any week during this coming July....d. Obviously, Palantir works with the government/military and many of the services that Palantir offers to the government/military are NOT available to the public... BUT, Palantir can leverage that experience to create Commercial software because of these government/military contracts8. Now you know why Google who COLLECTS and ANALYZES data from your email, search, Google Drive, etc... is SCARED of team (Palantir + IBM + AWS)9. Fair enough?Peace!"
"Congratulations to everyone who bought yesterday on the big dip. Every time a stock like Palantir dips and you buy, you’re just buying value. This is an amazing company with strong contracts that are locked in with the government and just those contracts will increase 30% year over year. This company is strong because they sell contracts left and right.I <3 Palantir"
A no brainer $60 in 90 days
These discount prices make me want more 
"Hey, could Palantir-Foundry implement their software to a, say, Bloomberg terminal? I'm sure Big Banks, Investment Banks, and Wallstreeters would love the extra layer of Financial Analysis DD at their disposal. Just wondering."
"Let’s be very clear about the lockup expiration. It makes absolutely no difference what amount of stock gets sold, as long as investors see the value in a stock and a company then there will buyers.Palantir has a monopoly on what it can do and it is the future. There will be buyers today and tomorrow and ever increasing amount as long as Palantir offers value. I did not buy Palantir to get fixated on a few days of trading, particularly on something that we have expected since October. I bought Palantir because of its products, management, future growth and that it has a monopoly. Peter Thiel and Founders fund own nearly 14%. Palantir is his baby and he will make sure his company becomes the next conglomerate, as he has done in the past. The DD is done, hold or buy the dip. Then let Palantir do all the work then."
"An International Mining Company... California Electric... British Petroleum... and the biggest fish so far, IBM. PLTR landed all of these in the past few weeks, plus others. And they are just getting started - just like your portfolio...because this is going to be $60 by spring. Mark this post."
"Oh boy, once we break through 26.00 this is gonna fly so fast"
"$150 stock by November, the Stupidest analysts will soon be crowned for lack of knowledge, like Cramer...."
"GUYS, THE WHOLE MARKET IS DOWN. JUST BE PATIENT"
"Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP announced today they have collaborated to introduce Akin Gump’s RegSpot, a new legal digital services platform powered by Palantir’s Foundry software that will allow Akin Gump’s clients to access innovative solutions to meet their legal needs."
Nice to finally see this stock spark up a little  pltr needs a few good days.
Unusual activity coming for PLTR same like RKT GME.. get ready everyone.
$30 today
Palantir and IBM partner to deliver Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data
Is this forum just for short sale day trader? I don't understand how a stock only down 3% in a day is considered a failure when the whole market is in red right now. These are the best days to buy and average down for bigger gains in the future
I got to ask. I might understand if you are day trading. Who cares about the price a week from now. This is a buy and 5 years from now you will be grateful. September was 10 bucks. Stocks don't go up daily NEVER
Cramer has a lower price entry point for PLTR. He wants to buy but will try to push it lower before buying.
Next week the big contract is coming be ready shorts
"Lol imagine being the guy who sold around $21 thanks to peer pressure, BS, and panic "
"Made more research, HD, COCA, AMEX etc bought PLTR' service years ago. and cancelled later because can not bring profit rather than high price cost. even such big player do not want spending on PLTR, strong sell for sure!"
PLTR lets ....

Lost a fortune in this stock this week. But  s
CNBC reports thisPLTR reported 4th qtr 2020 earnings of $0.06 per share on 2/16/21. This beat the $0.02 consensus of the 6 analysts covering the company.
"Cathy added 1,560,200 shares on 2/16 (Tuesday). I think I will follow suit."
This will be very active at 3:30 as this is last day before earnings Tuesday morning as market is closed Monday.
I’m so tired of Palantir’s red days.. and my portofolio being on negative..... come on men..
wondered what price AARK paid for this
Hooders..double down now. Sleepy Joe has already promised to send a $2K stimulus check.
"$30s next week, March will be a great month and now stimulus 1.9T approved!"
Feels like something weird is going to happen on Monday.. something doesnt feel right
"Just picked up some more, buying opportunity"
Thank you again for your shares. Heading out for the day. See you all later and have fun.
"Its starting to take offff, lets break 26"
"lol, check the daily chart... a huge volume... interesting......"
I sold out all of PLTR between 40-45. I am scared of Cathie playing.I be buyer again at 10-12 till then let Cathie do whatever.
Let’s break 26.90 come on !!!
"Still pricy today, from $11 jumps"
"Hey everyone, tough day today, tough week!It will come back, just gotta wait it out. I've been in since $10, and I'm not selling!"
Tomorrow will bring more....
How are you $20 bagholders feeling today? This is an expensive lesson to not get caught up in hype
Hope you all bought the dip last week
People think that Stocks never recover and that we’re all going to live in Caves soon
"ARK yesterday bough $45,220,957.44 (3 times more why they bought in November)... and by the way, they are not loosing money. Inform yourself (e.g. Tom Nash on youtube)"
West coast wake up now. we go 30
just a thought...imagine palantir create a search engine for public use like Google -
"Got more at $20.95, averaging up."
"Can you guys imagine, next Q we will see this company becoming profitable! That's gonna be amazing! The price will jump so high!  My guesses are 65 dollars a share! And EoY we will see 95!"
I was all about diversification etc... until Palantir started dipping and sold all my equities to purchase Palantir...Wish I had more to have a bigger position ...
"Bears enjoy your time, it wont last for long. I dont want to see you next month or next year. I don’t care if it drops 5 o 10 or 20%, this is an investment, a value investing. If it dips i will add more, for sure. This will probably join the s&p one day"
going to 28
M is on mute. Board looks better already. There will be more to join that lost soon.

Palantir rumored to be signing with AT and T or Verizon or both
Palantir $PLTR deal with AMAZON AWS came into effect today. HUGE.
Shorts!
Did I hear them correctly? They've done 47% growth in 2020 and they're looking to grow about the same rate for Q1?
Bought in today when down a little over 9%. Could have waited before the close but I'll be holding this for years. The operating loss is due to ramping up and expansion.
Wow... glad to see this week gone
Investing in Palantir is honestly a no brainer. In the past 3 months there's been positive report after positive report - deal after deal. And this is just the first year of going public!
I’m going to put half my stimmy into palantir I don’t even know what it does but who cares
US stimulus approved......big things for Palantir?
Panic buying on tech stocks seems to be starting.
"Future me will thank myself for holding. This is the next Apple, Microsoft, Tesla stock"
"nice bear trap tracing the Nasdaq, might be a red day today but monday will be green"
JUST 5 DAYS TO GO!
"Will this correction continue tomorrow or not, that is the question . . ."
i am in at 37 will be holding till 80.
"but Catty bought more, but but.....rofl"
"Sold mine $27.45 a while ago. Meant to buy back around $25 but failed. Watched it all the way to $45. Never wanted to chase due to its high valuation. Thought it might stay above $30. Well, time to buy back?"
When I bought Tesla it collapsed aswell...then it doubled....Hold the line!!!
I'm going to make a bold prediction and say Nasdaq going to $10000 if all tech stocks correct to reasonable values.
"Stop worrying... its not the stock, its the market"
So are we going to make more volume than yesterday? Thumbs up if you think so!
27 today
i learned a very painfull lesson with MODERNA.....lesson- $20 stocks can be manipulated just like $.20 stocks just in a different manner...i will hold for 200+...no doubt 1-3 yrs....YeshuaIsLord
If you guys want this continuing going down! Let it go! But pump it! Again to 40s! In 1 month! I will hold! I won't lose money with this!
We are back baby let’s do this 
i have lost 10s of thousands now in this and what makes most annoyed is that the company doesnt have a vision..just some vision to be the united states ..the eagle eyes like in the game of thrones and karp thinks hes the freezer king ...its totally annoying..give us real updates like how many hits on aws or ibm sales etc...thats really whats supposed to be happening yoj cant start blaming non western values for not making money
"Q1 Guidance is 45% rev growth, +$103m. But guidance for entire year is 30% (+$327m). So Q1 will represent 31% of the guidance for the year, leaving 3 more qtrs to generate $224m. Clearly the large amount of Calls reflects a big “beat” is coming, plus a big guidance improvement. $4B will be the target not for 2025, but 2023."
ARKK and ARKW added. A lot.
Who wants to buy my PLTR shares for $50?
Strong base at $32. We will never dip into the 20s again. Only up from here $50 by earnings.
Shorites lol
$44 by tomorrow
AWS tendering offer for PLTR - could be as high as 41.50 per share -----
"If you were an pltr executive, would you sell a boat load of PLTR options at $25 knowing in a few months it will be some crazy high price like you believe. Thoughts ? The entry point for this stock is below $20 to hold for a few quarters."
Goldman has a $34 Price target. They're relieving GME traders of their Palantir shares at a discount for themselves.
"Add another 500 shares short, trend is so clear, thanks for dreaming bulls!"
Never ever bet against Peter Thiel!!! He will make use all RICH!!!!!!
"Remember that ARK, Baillie Gifford, Blackrock and Vanguard all added in Q4 2020... also PLTR have made very interesting new deals. This will be a winner in 2021 and forward... Long and strong in this awesome and interesting stock."
I like Palantir have a long position. Just took a position in AABB a company creating a crypto currency backed by gold. They are up over 90% in just two days. It's OTC and risky but sounds very promising.
"Whatever happens today, we are together longs."
"So, where is Karp? Skiing in Austria?"
40 end of March
Wow so it broke $28. Time for $25 again I guess
Less than 24 hours!
$TSNPD & $PLTR are my long term babies. I feel bad for you if you don’t agree.
I’m jumping back in at $20
Can you imagine... Everyone expecting 50s....and this is now at 25! BTW... I'm 30% down! 
"This week bites but if this will one day become a trillion dollar company or anywhere close, I will give the ups and downs of times like this a pass lol. Let’s get to it..."
Keep on Lifting...Higher! Higher and Higher!!
Everyone knows PLTR is above 100 in️️️️
"Those that are selling , have no Confidence in Management for ER. These people know what they are doing, Tues will be Great."
"You make the $$ not in selling or in buying, but in Holding."
"$15 target, maybe lower."
So I watched/listened to the call earlier and I liked what info I got out of it.I listened to the questions from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs analysts both congratulated the Palantir team on the past quarter.Then the sell off.And then this evening we learn that one fund has added 1.6 million shares. The only one that reports daily. So what do we learn? The big money wants in. I suggest you follow the big money too.
Of course the final price will be right on the pin for options reasons.
"Lesson for you all. I had 1100 shares of SQ at $38, sold it for 10K profit, I had 1000 shares of PINS at $19, sold it for a few thousand in profit....Lesson to learn? Look at these stock prices now...HOLD pltr."

Ok longs... just relax.. it will finish green. It my take 1 step back but in a day it could walk up by a few steps. Relax!!! Stay long and strong!!!
This is very heavily shorted and it's still happening those are facts...it will swing back..but not until alot of damage and sellers or panicked people give up...I've seen this game 1000 times..this will be 50 or 60$ stock by Summer guaranteed
"anyone know about the reddit group coming to pltr? if it's true, oh my gosh. PPS $100,> 150, >200, 250, 300, 350 $400 PPS. If not I'll settle for $100 PPS."
"As the price of a stock falls it becomes less risky, not more risky."
i'm just about done with my 1500 shares in this thing. so frustrsting

I am reading karps thesis. Just thought you d like to know.
Should be a very easy $40 reach in the short term 
AH don't mean anything unless its earnings or a big announcement. Look what happened today with AH. Now if you have CCIE then you should worry!!!
"Day traders' easy money buy 1000 shares @ $26, sell @ $27 reload and repeat all day long..."
It is all right now. Red.
20k shares added today y’all. Let’s go 
"from what I gather the CEO is unwilling to tell the world about what pltr does with the information it gathers he also doesn't care if people invest or not he states it's a big world out there and we can invest in whatever we want no one is forcing us to buy pltr I genuinely love this idea that he can't be bullied nor bought or pressured by wall street or big investor companies I believe the secrecy around pltr has more to do with keeping control of their business more than anything if they start telling the world everything we should see copying so I'm 110% investing in pltr not only have they secured almost 20contracts in the past 4 months on this year but they have successfully gained confidence in renewed contracts. ark BlackRock and many more investors have bought millions of shears I see a future in companies that refuse to be controlled so #$%$10,000 of my personal money will be put into this company and left for 5 years I won't look at it again till this day in 5 years"
"Huge dip AH, who sold their shares?"
the sellers who feel smug selling their tech grow stocks right now they're gonna go over and get steamrolled ... cramerhttps://youtu.be/tFwxNk5dit0

glad you didn't panic sell :)
waiting for a lower dip to get further in the red hahahaha
"$50 in two months..... sure, I'll buy all I can at $25"
Palantir is 47.5 Billion and Snowflake is 50.5 Billion today. What's the deal? We're worth more at 40X than their 85X price to sales.

So proud of this investment. We could weather reports of an alien invasion. Try using that one Wallstreet.

"Volatility and algo arbitrage make each dip in momo a massive buying opportunity. Why? Because this is a pure momentum trade that has nothing to do with fundamentals.

WE FOLLOW CATHY AND SHE WILL LEAD US TO THE  SO STAY STRONG AND LONG 50.00 COMING!
"Lots of pointless talk and guesswork.Is the stock on its way to the moon in a crazy run as many forum participants hope? It may or may not be.Would be very nice if so.But, we invest in a stock that we believe in its vision and future-breaking products.The stock will grow as the company continues to develop and market its products. I believe IBM joined the partnership on the understanding that “if you can not beat them, join them.” Think about IBM's considerations in the deal and understand where PLTR is going...... Patience is the key word and for the kids investing in the stock, I would love a quick run to relax a bit. good luck to us."
I'm losing my school money. let all pltr investors write to support reddit and elona parlantir
Today $26?
plz someone call the KARP to inquire why I'm going bankrupt after investing in this future company
As I wait for the US market to open
Ya im out. Out of palantir. Out of all nasdaq stocks
"NASDAQ is going green very soon, so do we AH."
Good to see Palantir partnering up with many tech companies. Future is very bright!
that runup at the open yesterday probably had nothing to do with retail investors. i'll bet that a fund got wind of the deal and added to their position. about 8 million shares.
"Are you a  follower or have you done your DD? Makes no difference to longs. If you panic sell, we buy. Longs win, shorts win, panic sellers lose."
THE PLTR TRAIN ON ITS WAY TO $40+ALL ABOARD AND FASTEN YOUR SAFETY BELTS!GO PLTR!
I can laugh about this “misery” ‘cause eventually I’m laughing all the way to the moon bank with this stock.
I loaded the boat again and drove my dollar cost average down to $23.38. You have to take advantage of these days and dollar cost average down.
Great company to write covered calls on
Bought more today. I thought I got good deal when I purchased some shares yesterday. Looks like today is even better. On sales guys!
can PLTR ever keep its gains.... up 2$ in the morning and now up a mere 0.50 cents.

Shorts should get concerned today
If u didn't buy that dip to 25 u really missed a once in a lifetime opportunity
big news on the way dont sell
PLTR: looking for upward move from here. Going green later today and next week!!! GLTA
It’s strange how so many of you bought the stock and have no clue what you actually invested in  Wow.
Buy at open before it blasts off!
Why hasn’t yahoo said anything about Jeffries raising price target to $40?
Palantirs AI software's ability to read in between the lines and configure data for top tier organizations will lead to multiple awards due to their service of assisting organizations throughout each industry to operate at optimal levels.
Bro these next few days/weeks are a golden opportunity to scoop this up
I'm at peace with PLTR. I trust this company and its upside potential. You should too. Dont watch every price change. It will just stress you out.
Institutional ownership dropped from 22% to 18% over the past month (includes the lockup expiration) - thoughts?

Great work today guys! Keep holding WHO IS WITH ME
I opened a cashapp just for the sole purpose of buying 1 PLTR share per day. It's obviously not my only brokerage acct or PLTR position but it keeps me committed. Goal is to have 200 shares in that account by the end of the year. It's kind of fun to log in each day and see the price I'll be paying.

Interesting article by John Rhodes on seeking alpha concerning his view on upcoming earnings and price going forward
PLTR id honestly the best stock you could purchase on the market. It’s like buying apple or Tesla at 40Billion market cap. I’m not selling for anything less than $420.69
"1. I will start thinking hard about selling PLTR once the price goes up to $272.0 It seems that PLTR will be playing between $23 to about $28 in the next few weeks3. Many commentators keep saying ""To The Moon"" and saying that PLTR will trade for $100, $150, or $200 in the next 2 years...4. These same ""Cheer Leaders"" said the same thing when PLTR traded at $30, $35, $40, and $45... Then: BOOM, the price is back to reality and trading at $23 to $25 AGAIN5. Conclusion: If you bought at $23, SELL when it goes to $27 and buy again when it goes back to reality around $23 to $256. Today's stock market is not setup for LONG TERM anymore...7. The Millennial Generation as well as institutions and people like Catherine Wood will QUICKLY FLIP PLTR stock and move on to the Next FAD stock...8. Fair enough?Peace!"

what a coincident that GS upgrades it to a buy right before the lock-up period sets to expire on 2/18... So they want you to buy it when their clients are selling... Umhhh....
Looks like the larger players want to accumulate PLTR. HOLD
This is Soros dumping his shares. Short term fall but good riddance to him and his cronies.

"I’ve been in this company since $13 a share; buying various lots with prices ranging from 13-36. Haven’t sold a share and have been trading covered options against my positions, slowly inching back some of my losses. I originally bought this on hype, but once I dove into the fundamentals and watched their demo day, I was sold for the long haul. I’m a firm believer in the long term total addressable market here, that has, for the most part, not been fully tapped, and I’m excited to see what other companies will decide to partner. These last few weeks have been incredibly difficult, but I haven’t considered selling once. Both green and RED are an integral part of being an investor in the stock market, you must take the good with the inevitable bad. I’m not going anywhere anytime soon, cheers to the ride for the next few years."
"friends, everyone should comment on elon musk and reddite to support pltr"
"House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters is urging regulators in a recent letter not to extend banks supplementary leverage ratio SLR. If this exemption is not extended, banks will be forced to sell hundreds of billions in treasuries by month end."
ARK doubled today their position from 5.2 million shares to 10.5 million shares. They also sold all SPLK shares (competitor of PLTR..)
PLTR inks a 6 year deal with FURCF to use their Foundry platform
predictions end of 10 years? i think if the contracts come in steady as they are now. this company may certainly have a value of 350$
could go up to 45 by next week
12 pm was screaming buy
See the live press conference from White House
People with cash should take this as opportunity. Wait for the bearish market to bottom out and scoop up the opportunity stocks.
We live in a world where a company without financials and mere speculation can run 1400 percent in 3 months. but palantirs revenyes increased 47 percent from last year and people sell.
Pltr to the moon 
ALL HAIL PALANTIR
if we open above $30 we can see an interesting day
Was always a hype stock. Going to $13 quickly.
You still doubt?
"Okay, instead of ""Buy the dip!"", do we have anything else cheery to say? How about ""Set it and forget it!""?"
"Ark now owns 16,010,363, added 400,000 this week and purchased as it went up !!! The upcoming Demo will shed light on the future, buy on any dips because this will head north very soon."
Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes.
"Insiders and Soros keep selling.Cathy is a paid buyer of stocks because Wall Street,institutions and insiders need people like her to buy and promote stocks.I've seen this movie 100-200 times before. $15 coming."
Why is everyone hating on the insider sales? If I had put in the sweat-equity for 17 years building a company I’d cash in some rewards too. Everyone just goes immediately to the negative.
ARK is over 100 percent ..ARK buying the PLTR like crazy humm im buying more .https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/03/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-over-2-6-million-palantir-shares/
I think 27.25 is where its headed
very interesting the way this has held up recently
"As the late,great Joh Belushi said...Let's do it!"
"My fellow Palantir amigos,1. Cathie Wood seems to be a smart investor2. She did buy PLTR at different prices this year and it seems that she bought, mostly, in the $22 to $26 price range3. So, it seems that, as far as PLTR stock is concerned, Cathie Wood has paid, on average about $24 per share this year...4. Looking at the current price of PLTR = $24.86, as I am typing, it seems that Cathie Wood is doing ""OK"", but not ""Extremely OK or Great"" as far as her PLTR stock pick5. In other words, considering the period of this year from Jan-1-2021 until today, it seems that Cathie Wood is ""really no smarter than the average Joe who is buying PLTR""....6. Is Cathie Wood = Hype? Shall we follow her stock moves? Is she working with these companies to trick investors into buying stocks that are just average stock? Does she get financial kickbacks from Palantir? Tesla?...In other words is there a conspiracy between big investors and hyped companies?Peace!"
300 more shares then in part of the 1k club!!!
What a great buy opportunity! 
Really nice to see that PLTR has been consolidating quite steadily even with fears of rising 10 yr bond yields.
"I'm a decent investor, not an expert by any means. For many of us retail investors, this is a long-term no-brainer. A.I. is going to be a huge part of first world and emerging economies long into the future. Growth in this sector is inevitable and stock prices can seem disconnected from the reality of the moment but it's important to have forward thinking hindsight to really experience growth in your portfolio. Keep doing your research."
Just remember when countries have problems who do they turn to? You guessed it !
"I’m cashing out, will be back at 23"
SOMETHING REAAAALLLLYY BIG IS COMING.....IBM + AWS= FOUNDRY
Who’s holding for $50 or HIGHER?
This is too painful to watch...Let's change the subject...I bought a Big Mac for lunch and 6 pieces of Spicy Chicken Nuggets My first time trying the Sbicy Nuggets. They were great.
"Remember: Buy and hold is the most consistently successful investment strategy. 1. Buy a company with a compelling business proposition, 2. Don't get distracted by the noise of occasional bad news and red days, 3. Focus on the long-term (2 years and longer). I went all in on solid Oil and Gas companies exactly one year ago. I am now millionaire and I am planning to retire this Summer when I turn 40. I'm using much of those gains to invest in the Palantir team and I have no doubt they will succeed (and I'll succeed from their success). $20, $30, or $40 is all the same when this thing is $200 in 5 years."
Next support $22.50
By April 50+
Revenue up 40 percent and it drops like a rock?
"+ 2,54% in preopening Frankfurt"
Bought some more shares and muted a lot of clowns. That’s a successful day in my book. Thanks again Alex for doing a DPO for the retail investors. 
"When others panic and sell, you hold.Scared money don’t make money, if a 3 week period of red is enough to make you give up all hope and cut & run, you’re clearly in over your head when it comes to investing.At that point you may as well stick to gambling in your free time .If it was as simply as buy the stock with a “buy” rating, fancy PR news, 2-3 month trend of green, and good “fundamentals”, everyone would be rich.This is a game of risk. Every stock has risk. Any given day, week, month, or year (COVID 19) could be trash . If you can’t handle losing some unrealized gains, this isn’t for you.Idc what these trolls say, neither they or you can predict the market with certainty. Your best bet is to focus on the long term, where the market generally grows."
one of these days
"This has been a TECH sell off, not just a PLTR sell off over the last 2 weeks.99.9% of the “hot” tech stocks like PLUG, NIO, TSLA, etc etc are in the red the past week-2 weeks.Not a PLTR issue, hold strong or regret it later.You don’t sell because the next guy is selling. You sell if you believe fundamentals have changed, which they have not . People are panic selling because they haven’t seen green in days, that’s when you hold and trust the market will rebound. 99% of the time it will "
will be $50 on Tuesday
I have a total of 541 shares now. 250 at 10 and 250 at 43.51 and 41 buying the dips.This stock is long term play and I plan on keeping this for 30 years. I am 23 years old and will be putting 30 dollars a week into this stock and 70$ a week into the s$p500 Although pltr will be 30% of my portfolio. I believe in 30 years the price will increase so much that it will invert the effect of the 30/70 split in doing and be 70/30
The pre-market means nothing as volume is very low and spread can get very wide.I don’t see the price going under 25.5 support at all and even if it get there it will be by the end of trading day as some traders might decide to take some profit before the weekend.
do you think that palantir price will go up after earnings? It looks like earnings will be positive so I think it would be good to load some more shares
The year is 2025. PLTR has continued it's tremendous growth rate of 45% a year and forward guidance looks to be about the same for the next 5 years. Stockholders rejoice as the bullish outlook pushes the stock above 30.
"Can't stay down for long, Green closure."
"Worldwide revenues for artificial intelligence software, hardware and services will grow over 16% annually from 2021 to 2025 to reach $327.5 billion, forecasts International Data Corp."
way undervalued
"If you are a seed investor who is seeking a good future harvest $$$$, P'Lant'ir."
"Can’t be too emotional on green or red days. Considering how the market is in its current state, nobody in here knows what PLTR will do in the near future, if they say otherwise they’re BS’ing just like the trolls telling you to sell .Embrace the short term volatility and accept it for what it is.Whether up or down 10% on Monday, it means nothing in 5 years.THAT is where I can tell you PLTR is still a sleeper and will be worth considerably more long-term.Lock up is done.Panic selling due to citron/earnings/lock up period is done.Now it’s catalyst based growth moving forward. Those earnings should continue to improve as well.Got in <$10 and will be holding for the next 3-5 years.Appreciate the 25% discount "

I am young and holding because I am a data engineer and I know what this company is. 2000 shares strong and not selling regardless of the outcome on Tuesday. To have a government contract is not easy.
Looks like the nay sayers ran out of stories to tell.
"I will not sell! Repeat 5x "" I will not sell""!"
Follow the money flow. Last 2 weeks big money are buying tech sector and retail is shaken out as always. Sell now and buy back in 2 weeks LOL
"Nice, but all those shares she bought at 25 didn’t stop us from going under 23 today. If she becomes too overweighted in this stock, the danger is that other Wall Street predators will do to her what WSB did to Melvin Capital Mgt with GME, but in reverse. Still heavily long, but nervous."

Move up on strong volume is what we needed to break through and looks to be what we are getting. Keep pushing.

"Lol so much impatience.... you make me laugh.If doing well in the stock market was as simple as buying a stock that’s been trending green week-to-week, is upgraded as a buy by so and so, and had a phenomenal earnings report: we’d all be rich.Reality is this is a risky business. Your portfolio could be cut in half tomorrow. The entire market could crash due to some insane event. Etc etc.Patience is your best bet. All this red/green/trash/to the moon stuff is nonsense.PLTR is experiencing the same volatility as much of the tech market currently, + some hangover from the lock up expiration.Facebook was down 50% for quite some time after it appeared on the market, countless other examples out there.Accept the volatility, stop stressing day to day and stress year to year = you’ll sleep better.Have a nice day, shoutout to the REAL longs that have been here since DPO day like myself.

I always wanted to buy this stock. starting with 500 shares @ 25. let's go
ARK just bought 5 mil in shares
$40 Baby !!!
I didn't have any more chips with which to enjoy the dip...
Dont get it.. if insiders are dumping why is cathie woods buying... what sdoes she know that they dont...
"a manipulating hedge fund is Very Jealous of Cathy Woods, it won't work,Reddit gang will get them."
Will it close at the high of the day?!
looking based on the fair value (from simply wall st) this is undervalued (fair value @28.83) 
PLTR is the only one queen which is running.Hence I feel whoever buys here will double their money fastGl
For people who’ve been bag holding at 30: we’re coming for you
"there are plenty of other places to put your money said KarpI've never seen a worst communication, maybe a genious but must be helped by a real communicantHe doesn't need our money ? But glad when he sells his options and free shares"

5000 shares holding till 500 a shares in 5 years !!!
brought 600+ @ 28 wishing for the best rn !!
The graph shows a positive move for the next week or two. Enjoy it while it lasts.
I like the stock
"Yup ,1.6million...ark must be worried about the lock up as well"
The whole day around 25. Feels like manipulation. Anyway bought today
We will close today $67.05
"keep adding little by little since $29 after it fallen from 45. Never expected that $pltr will hit hard. If my predictions are correct, $pltr will turn back to 30 by next friday."
Been an investor of Palantir pre direct listing. Just give your money to the smartest people in business and let them grow your money. Just keep adding slowly and I believe in a few years this stock will be trading in the 200s.
That jump to 28$ at the end should tell it all

That is how I feel
"Just saw the interview with Karp...The is THE reason why I have put some much $$ into PLTR, a man who does not shy away from the cowards among us so full of courage to complain on a twitter machine because someone hurt their feelings and they want someone to lose their jobs. He is not a 15 yr old in an adult's body! I will keep on buyin'...."
Upcoming news....people know! Its been two weeks since last contract announcement.
I want to own 100 shares of this before it blasts through 50s. adding slowly.
Thumbs up if your excited for the week coming
"All IPO/DPOs have to go through the founders/employees/investors cashing out their investment. If you are long and bought PLTR shares back in Oct-Dec 2020, your investment are safe forever I will be as patient as Cathie Wood to wait for longer term big return. There is some risk and may go down even lower, but the return is worth waiting."
i can only hear the short sellers screaming.... 
"Investors in Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 16, 2021 $65.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Buckle up!!"
2000 shares added at $26.25People can fret the drops or stagnation. I’ll remind you it was at $9 5 months ago... The earnings were as solid as we could ask outside of the negatives from stock based compensation.Insiders selling? lol. This your first rodeo? Name me one mega cap company where insiders don’t sell. These dudes get more shares as they hit milestones. Not like the rest of us who need to hold to realize gains.Grow up or get out. Money is moving from the inpatient to the patient as we speak.
"Chief Operating Officer, Shyam Sankar, Bought 600,000 Shares worth approximately $16000000, on 02/19/2021.Follow me on @money_stock_pick on Instagram for more details and Form 4"
volume .... isnt really speaking to me right now
if we hit back $40 i will sell half !! I'm super regret not take profit on last time.
This reminds me of Facebook s chart in the beginning Only difference Facebook had a ton of controversy before takeoff and still does
"Spent $1,287.90USD buy 53 shares of PLTR two weeks ago.Spent $242.10USD today to buy 9 more.I still owe $29kUSD in student loans. Logic tells me to pay off my student loans first but dammit, PLTR is too good of an opportunity to pass up. One way or another I will pay my loans..... BUT IM NOT SELLING MY SHARES."
I expect Friday to be an AWESOME day for PLTR.... To The Moon!!!
just bought 138 shares
Just added 200 shares
I lost 7K in less than 4 trading days.
Point and Figure improved with the breakthrough of $26. Should have little resistance there in the coming days.
been in pltr since 13 my favorite by far
This stock is 10% of my portfolio . I’m long dawg
in at 27. not selling untill i reach 100. #$#$ off hf
"Lol @ anybody who sold this past week or two.The entire tech market is down. All the favorites are in the red anywhere from 15-30% during this last 5-9 trading days.I spent the day adding to my positions in PLTR, PLUG, NIO, TSLA, APPS, OPEN, NET, CRWD, and others.When others panic for the sake of panicking, you hold strong and double down in the stocks you believe in.Will it work out for you 100% of the time? No. Will it be the correct move much more often than not? Absolutely.These big hedge funds can manipulate prices any given second, a little PR here & there, and boom: price is manipulated. They count on your weak hands to get in where they see fit.If doing well in the stock market was as simple as: buy the stock that’s been green for 3 months, everybody would be rich. If you believe in this position and/or others: STAY PATIENT. It’s been proven time and time again: the turtles win this race more often than not.I saw the same panic in PLTR when it was climbing from the 10s to 20s. Been holding steadily since $9.45 and adding on dips.Relax. It’s just a momentary down period, completely irrelevant in the 2-5 year trajectory of this company and others alike."
"If you don’t own PLTR and bashing. your a Fan , I’m shareholder I will give you autograph."
Some people on this board are comparing this company to FB and AAPL. Seriously? What is so unique about PLTR that the SP will 10X long term?
maybe I'll add more. moving out from $aapl to get into this $pltr
IM STILL HERE!
We can do it
Thanks for discount!!! <3
"Tuesday morning, release earnings !"
The price getting drived down before earnings is something to see from a good eye. Ive seen so many run ups to earnings and major selloff even at good news. So i think this is just perfect. People are not buying as much as they are waiting to see whats going to happen. The entry price will be a lot more alluring when the news come out. if this was in the 45's it would be perceived as expensive. In since 10 with a 19.40 average and looking forward to Tuesday! See you at 60 after earnings lads
why isnt this going up its supposed to be songreat
"The CEO said we hope long-term investors stay with us, if you expect short-term returns take your money to another stock. With that statement, I don't see this as the best place to put your money the next 3-5 years. But beyond that, I see it go parabolic"
"visited the website, looks like a scam to me. where is the product? quotes are cited like ""Executive Director—World Food Program"""

Thousands of tech-savvy IBM salespeople are currently scouring the world for new PLTR clients. :)
Believe in Cathie woods not any other agenda analysts. She said they not only invested in TSLA but traded it and made 175% profit on it. She bought millions of PLTR at this level. She knows other walstreet crooked tricks and plays against them very well.

"For those who want to sell the stock this morning, please think about why you bought ? Please calm down, don’t let the anger control you, you don’t want to live in regret, do you?"
Slowly but surely! Reddit investorsAre gathering their funds now! Wait!
Nice that Palantir is discreet until big deals are done. Sudden revelations will make it likely that shorts get torched real good in due time.
anyone know what this uk lawsuit means for pltr short term
"At $27 several of my shares get called away from me on Fri. I'm still net long, but it's gonna be sad to watch them go... but that's why I loaded up under $22. I LIKE THE STOCK"

Palantir is a software innovator that will disrupt more categories than you realize.Today with market sentiment pulling back shouldn't stop PLTR from breaking 32 this week and continue climbing.Keep buying PLTR and holding 10+ years. Same goes for others you should be holding long include $NIO under 55, $NNDM under $14, $XPEV under $40."
News! Check their twitter!
40%+ in revenues and people are selling? I'm laughing all the way to the bank.
"you guys paying a premium on ""growth"". inflation is a guarantee and people will value fundamentals because they dont want to be in a hyperinflated environment. Do you guys think the economy will recover? If yes then you know interests rising is inevitable. This will be below 20 in like a month"
I’d give Cathy all my shares for Whig of her taint. No joke
ARK is in it for long term and they made it very clear. If you are in it now today for quick profit then you need to keep up with the pricing action and make your call.
Cashing out
I just bought 350 shares! Am I too late for the party?
HEAVY institutional buying. This is an undervalued gem that will be a 5x bagger at minimum by years end.
"rsi turned up, it's trading above the 13ema, on 3/5 we had a hammer at the bottom of the downtrend started the trend reversal to the upside... we begin the climb.... next stop 60.22ish.. let's go PLTRRRRR...."
I’m buying huge on Monday hopefully stay around same price. This is steal
https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-joins-weprotect-global-alliance-a22641c9670d
"we keep strong and long ""leaving the ship"""
It has traded in a 70 cent range today. That won’t last and it’s looking like the extension will be a move to the upside.
Pre market looks bad
I just want one day where I actually make more money than a day where I was down..that's seems almost iij impossible bc of math...or percentages. they should stop showing percentages bc that makes people stop
Holding for next five years
As I said 500m volume today to 33-35
Did you hear the good news...
"thx buy more , under 26 is a bonus!"
"Not bothered, very happy with earnings and plan to buy more today. Long and strong."
Held my 8000 shares through today’s dip and bought 5000 more shares. As a mid 20’s millennial. This is the easiest 10x I’ll ever make in the next 5 years.
We will end up green!
"How funny! Almost everyone here says buy, buy and buy including myself. But the more we buy the further it goes down. So who is selling? Is it hedge fund taking profit from weak hand?"
What is this! We were 5 % up! Now we are almost negative!
we are holding tight and thats awesome. as long as insiders stop selling we are good to run another good one....
If ur bearish than buy puts 2-3 months out and see what happens...
PLTR is a steal when it's below 30$. It will be above 50$ within next two months. 
we closeda @ almost 24.
If this hits 24$ it goes to 27
I see 50+ in the very near future
BEWARE: bashers on this board have no game in PLTR. they do not short or invest at all. they are dried up stock market geeks that make money commenting on comment boards.
"it will be green tomorrow. Friday, end of the week end of the month. everybody just hang on good news is coming"
Let’s go!
ALL IN
finish the day over 25 $$$$
A green day is a green day. I’ll take it.
What does this company even do?
I bought 3k yesterday at 37.37. Let’s keep it up
"“Oh now tech is doomed”“Market is crashing SELL NOW”“You’ll be a bag holder” “This thing is ”...they said.Yeah ok. See you in 5 years champ, let’s see how that money you saved by waiting on the sidelines pays off for ya.You don’t sell because others sold. You don’t panic and let a emotional low make you doubt your DD.So glad I bought the dips in TSLA, NIO, PLUG, PLTR, GE, among others. Idc if they dip further next week.Bring on the discounts .Shoutout to my real longs, oh and to the wannabe Nostradamus’s: you don’t make rash decisions based on a month of red. Having two brain cells will tell ya that.But your tears do taste delicious. I know you’ll be back on the next 2% dip to claim we’re going to $5, see you then (: "
"great price, i got in cheaper than ark. i'll hold as long as she does "
I think Palantir will get more news. It will go past 60$ without you if you get scared
The reason why it’s going down is because of the 25 USD put option which is expiring tomorrow.. so everyone is jumping on that ... so if I were you take the opportunity to buy tomorrow because it’s expiring tmrw.... this will shoot back to 30 with call options for March.... no brainier really
Someone bough 900K shares at the bottom.
Even some of you perma bulls will be blown away by the sales revenues we will soon start to see. Karps guidance was massively sandbagged growth numbers... Positive enough to justify valuation but limited enough to being consistent beats... We are 3-4 quarters away from the IBM and AWS partnerships to provide parabolic revenue growth...
PLTR is hiring in a lot of places.
Buy the DIP and let it RIP
"I have been selling off Apple shares every time hits highs and buying $tsla and $pltr....I think Tim Gay cook company is dead and Tsla will be next hot item to have, but I still do not know what pltr does..really. I just buy pltr because C. Wood buys it."
Has anyone else noticed the increase in market cap? Nearly 10 billion increase?!
"It may go down $1 in next 2-3 days, and then in one day it will go up by $10.That's how big players crush retail investors."
May see not $45 but $35-$40 again in 2 weeks???
"Executives selling Shares, This should be under 20 soon"
Karp is our leaderrrrrrr..... battle it out!!!!!!!..... No surrender!!!!!!!! 
Anyone using margins on pltr?
What’s the P/E of this company ?
Its gonna touch green and falll
What do y’all think about Monday?
ARK Invest takes another 24K of shares
Trying to break $24 be like
"I have a reason to believe all defense companies. i.e. Northrop, Lockheed, General Dynamics, Boeing, Raytheon, L3Harris, United Technologies, Rockwell, Honeywell, Harris etc...will soon adapt PLTR's Foundry Software."
Good times ahead for Palantir:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4412244-palantir-amazon-aws-partnership-is-game-changer
PLTR is a screaming buy stock.

"Just bought another 1,000 shares to help finish over $ 27 today and fight for $ 30 tomorrow"
"Germany is up 7.52%, 28.60 EUR ~ Approx. 34.71 USD. Shorty where are you now? This will fly from here."
"25 support needs to hold, its critical"
"Tomorrow PLTR, will be 33-34$ remember this."
Long. Will be nice in 2 years.

"Could any of you savvy technical analyst traders tell me 5-7 good indicators I should use on a chart...and should I really get caught up in charts if I am a buy and hold kind on investor...tyvm. I am a small investor but from what I have heard and read , I really like the long term upside to this company. I only have 50 shares, but I have a feeling I will be adding more."
"I’ll be the first to admit, when we were in the 30s I never thought we would see the 20s again. And, it resulted in high levels of stress when we plunged into the early 20s. BUT, what a blessing that was and it was the perfect opportunity to build a larger position, which was not part of the original plan at all. With that said, let’s get back into the 30s!"
tech getting wscked again like everyone warnee
Cathie wood is smart she dumped Apple and Facebook and loaded on PLTR and Teledoc on the dips. No bling PLTR will hit 100$ because it’s the cheapest quality stock now.
"What is negative about this stock? Only lockup, thats it."
for ARK a dollar or two down means nothing compared to 100 upwards... thats why they bought... like Karp said and Woods agreed short term means nothing to her... these shares yo her will cost double in a month if she does not get it NOW.
We will be just fine
"I can't buy. Etrade submits the market order, but it will not fill."
280 Million of new shares ????Huge dilution. Extremely unfavorable for investors.

Watch what happens to PLTR at 3:30pm...
"How can you trust people who say: hold is long term stock.And the next day, the same people are selling massively."
I keep accumulating
For the 1000th time. For those fear mongering about the LOCKUP PERIOD....Who cares about lockup period. Do you think employees who are making $200K+ will burn money and sell all their shares when they know this is worth 5-10x in the long term???? what's wrong with people!
this is where smart stimulus money goes!
"Next couple of weeks are crucial- earnings and lock in expiry - what’s your take,  we make it through with ride up,  we just bleed down to under 30’s.I am hopeful to higher 30’s."
If today wasn’t a change in the tide then I’m not sure what is. Fantastic and I’m drinking the good stuff tonight. Not every day needs 10% to be a good day. Cheers!
Anyone else enjoy that delicious breakfast dip?
"We know how meme stocks can skyrocket. This is the only meme stocks that is also supported by growth and fundamentals...in the right field. Whoever bought in the 30s-40s, worry NONE. Step back and have a longer perspective than a daily or weekly view. In even several months you’ll feel great you HELD ON. And you will also learn how to build wealth in a great company long term. Patience=Wealth"
Partnership with Amazon Web Services?
I am pulling out any Cash I got to BUY at this price. PLTR is the future of Data Management. Evey DEV OPS will need access to this software that keeps getting better. Bonus ZERO competitors in this market.

The Karp always wins!!! 
"Nasdaq up, PLTR down!"
"So y'all are nervous because insiders are selling shares. Well, think about it in your own life folks. You work for a company for up to 17 years, take a diminished salary in exchange for stock options over the entire time you worked there (maybe you've left the company but still had a lot of shares), then your shares are released and you have the opportunity to cash in at 5-10X cost. DO you do it in order to diversify, pay off debt you incurred because of the smaller salary, invest in another startup? Yes you do, and you should. Stop losing your minds over a selloff when 800 million shares enter the float overnight. If you didn't expect this you don't belong in the market..."

Just added to my position...
"Insiders valuated fair the value to be 7.25 $ at Direct Listing. Now they can sell for 25-30 $ to amateur investors, that has inflated the price 400%. Oh I forgot the 258M $ stock option program for the management. Thank you for our early retirement. Regards Cohen and his team."

we should positive around now
I'm seeing a lot of false reporting Pltr had a .06 earnings beat.
"Jimmy C says he cannot recommend PLTR because he needs to know what it does with the darkest, most secure corners of the government. Guess what Jim? You'll never know. Palantir is a monopoly. You always buy a monopoly as early as possible."
buying opportunity
"hey paaaaaaaaalantir, we wanna see the 45$ again! GO, PLTR LONG AND STRONG!"
It’s on sale!! BUY it up
It'll be a down day like this when we get the first big run!! Scare everyone out reverse sides up like a rocket!! They be very tricky!!
Palantir need to form alliance with 5G network vendors particularly NOKIA & Ericsson.

Picked up another 100 shares today. In ten years this will be tantamount to buying NVDA when it was $30.
0.8% of Ark invest portfolio is in PLTR! Follow Cathie wood bulls and load up premarket! See you at 30$ tomorrow. And for the bears your dip will be above 30$ this week!
Alex Karp always does his media interviews in the snow. The real SNOW.
Huge volume in pre market. Lots of attention. Folks are aware of PLTR>It should be at $35 plus.
Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin upgraded Palantir Technologies ==》2.5X 
"PLTR tickerRemove from watchlist (Yes)Holding 2,011 shares - how much I care about the price now. There is a snail trying to climb my outdoor stair case, I think I’ll watch that."
"I’ve got 500 shares at $13.5, should I add another 500 and at what price?"
Mama Wood said it best earlier today. If you are in PLTR for the short term wanting profits this isn't the stock for you. Long term story and they are investing for the future now.
This reminds me of TWLO early days. Mid 30's to mid 20's and plenty of bashers. 4 years later 20X higher!
Broke through the $25 wall
. green ! let's go
I am in. Looks like $35 tomorrow.
A $27 open would be nice.
"If PLTR announces a new big deal, everyone will flip their jacket over in 2 seconds and say Karp is fantastic, his frankness is miraculous, this guy is awesome and everyone will want his barber's address.Okay, his communication is terrible, but I still prefer Karp instead of hypocrite Zuckerberg talking like a robot. Don't confuse Musk, this one is a junkie who has no talent other than having burned tens of billions with investor money.Karp is right, most people want a 10% or 20% gain every day, so actually go to the OTC, the bitcoin.On the other hand, he should attack algorithmic trading, HFT, robots that manipulate the price not small investors who invest their savings"
why didnt I buy this last week?
well that was easy
"Hahaha, I bought more..."
"1.9 T printed & oil are going up, another painful week."
"Nasdaq up to 2 days, PLTR drop on both days. No good."

AWS AND PLTR TEAM UP
treasury yield is tickin up again. it was bound to happen ya know.. good luck on monday because i really dont know where grwoth and tech stocks are going but its not going to recover for at least month plus
$45-$60 after earnings?
Thumb up if you agree PLTR is a 100+ stock in ️️️️！
"Ok, so everybody was wrong regarding huge sell off happening today beacuse of lock expiration"
we’re mooning 
"PLTR is a long term investment as in the interview. Stop buying high, and selling low. Let the shorts do that, and buy back low under 25.00"
I believe that tomorrow the recovery will start.
Bears get slaughtered.
Good thing I grabbed those $29 calls!
So... do we recover tomorrow or Monday?
alot of buzz on this company from every where. AT&T hiring someone with experience in Palantir software. interesting
"It is sad to see small investors fall prey to the sophisticated game. Videos on YT, interviews, huge hype. And today you can see that small investors will become poorer and insiders will have additional $ billions."
"When Palantir breaks $ 20, both those who bought $ 10 and $ 30 will wear pampers."
The next tsla
"I’m in at 37, any opinions would be appreciated"
Reddit crowd just started action today. Much more to come.
26 calls expire toorrow!!!
thumbs up those who remember what i said last week about PLTR doubling up to over 45$ in 2 months or I would give up investing in stocks. I still believe that this will be over 45 in may. regards
The face of Cathies copy cats after looking at portfolio...
"I think one chance at this . I think Monday pre trading will be big. It’s time to clean out my watch list. Monday I will buy huge PLTR. Of course every one of my biotech stocks will triple as soon as I sell them . Let’s see how open is in morning first ...actually, I should give a hoot how it opens just do it"
Why is it falling
"As advised yesterday, buy under $25.You don't understand this company if you don't buy this under $30.PLTR is a $400+ long term stock. I expect it to be in triple digits within 6 months.Keep buying under 30 and hold until retirement."
So Woods was sitting at $25 all day buying and that's why it wouldn't go lower?!?
PLTR will become SkyNet!!!
HAPPY SAINT PATTY DAYS!!!
Let’s go
"PLTR is close to finding its bottom. Like I said before that big money will come in between $18 and $22, and it did on 3/5 and 3/8 between $21-$22 on above average volume. The stock may not go to the moon right away, but it will not go much lower either, it will likely find its footing in the next several weeks. Thus you will still have the opportunities to buy under $25, and this is close to the bottom."
"of course, as soon as I buy, it goes down. fml!"
PLTR solves problems the world can’t! Longs and shorts both know how high PLTR will surge!
"On the subject of value investing, SNOW just released Q4 earnings of 190.5 million revenue and 70 cents per share loss. PLTR released Q4 earnings of 322 million, and 8 cents per share loss. SNOW's market cap is 70 billion, and PLTR's market cap is 43 billion. Who would you invest your hard earned money in?"
"gonna get Whacked monday,cnbc reporters all jealous of Cathy Woods,try to show her wrong,they are"
any news about bonds?
Do you think this stock will go lower than current price? I bought months ago at $26.77. Should I sell and buy back when it’s lower?
"ARK bought 142,968 shares today, total today: 15,896,853. Cheers."
Wow PLTR contract with AWS. That is monumental.
This is like a huge middle finger to the market hahaha
"Just added 20@$24.76 for a total of 1,480 avg $15.5629 different lots lol The march to 2K continues!Good luck everyone!"
"We reached the bottom now, guys. The only way is up!"
Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t the AWS huge news? This opens up tons of potential customers. Stock barely reacted.
Wondering why 24 is so hard to pass.
Anyone know what Typhoid Cathie's latest picks are so I can short them?
"Sometimes with stocks, there is one final huge  dip and then it takes off. I’m thinking will be in the green April 1. ￼"
Does anyone know if Ark bought today?
"Bought in at 27, but no worries here with a likely >2x from here this year. Stay schwifty"
Why would anyone pick $SNOW over $PLTR makes no sense.
"If Ark paid around 28.00 average for the 1,560.000 shares they bought today the tab would be about 44 million. Hard to believe no upside from here, numbers improving and more clients, I have been in since 10 bucks and not going anywhere."
Don't pull up your pants just yet. We still have tomorrow.
$25+ will hit on or before EOD Friday. Mark this post!!!!
"let it dip down for us! Opportunities raises once in a while, take it or leave it."
"Wow if ARK bought PLTR today as somebody mentioned, that is the best news so far..."
e everything looks great for tomorrow..so I guess this will end up down a dollar only
welcome to the bag holders meeting everyone please have a seat. heheheheheheh
"It will be awesome if we close above $30 today, that will be a great start to next week on our journey to $40"
Even I can spot a market manipulation of PLTR. Somebody is quietly accumulating shares.
Bag holder at 32.00 will triple my shares when price goes below 20.00. long and strong
22 is upcoming!
"...and here the shorts come, just like flies to dung...or DemOs to politics, whichever you prefer."
Seems like it has bottomed out and now ready for bull run. 32 is in sight within days if market remains green.
Holy smokes...Just logged on for first time today and that Anonymous guy is making some of us Anonymous's look bad... lol
The calm before the storm
Who said we weren’t gonna break $29? Later 
I hope we will not see this price again
This stock has only been around for 4 months on the open market and is JUST now getting more notoriety . What the heck do you all who are bashing performance expect? Delusional expectations are ruining your portfolio not this stock.

Very interesting article on PLTR in Seeking Alpha. Second headquarters in Switzerland? among other tidbits..
"Reality Check:As we speak, Pre-market (8:48am Eastern Time Zone):Volume = about 2 millionHigh = $23.85Low = $23.0So, we should expect PLTR to play between $22 and $23 as usual?"

So sad. Our friends at PLTR are losing money again.
I got 3000 at $17 ... and I am down by like $30K but still in GREEN. Not gonna sell anyway :) I believe in this company for the long term.
PLTR wil rebound back above 30 next week! It’s just My conservative estimate!tons of tailwinds in long term!
"In today with 1,200 shares. Not trying to time the market, long term hold, waiting for larger deposit to hit, want to own 6,000 in the next week when the deposit hits. Just looking at fintel, endless institutions keep buying and 0 are selling. I want to buy, lock away and check back in 10 years."
"They try to break the people and make them sell. If you’re in HOLD and don’t worry, it will go up again. They try to manipulate stocks like always do. Remember, the big money are made the the people panic. The big boys now they’re making good money."

"Before you add, market capitalization is at 45b.Think twice, do your own assessment. Cathie wood saying this stock will go to 150$ is highly unlikely"
lost all my money uff
Just bought by daily share at $24.17. Should have grabbed it earlier but it's been a busy morning.
Shorts are panicking hahaha uve had your fun. Our time to shine now. See you at 40$. Feeling sorry for shorts who can’t trade pre and after market hours. Tomorrow’s we open 30+ you won’t have time to cover.
Kinda feels like we are still absorbing all the unlocked shares IMO.
If institutions are buying I won’t be selling. Follow the smart money
Good job numbers. Taxes to spend on Government Programs.
Cathy my man
amc gme up pltr down...why pltr onlymcompany with any revenues
why this Pltr barely move since people keep buying?
"Panic for no reason, the company expects PLTR to grow at a 45% rate, which is phenomenal!"
"Remember, max pain for this week's calls is $27. Huge open interest there."
Going back to 30
Loads up ppl bring your average down.
I’ll be very surprised if this stock doesn’t hit $40 on Tuesday!
"Management gave 2025 Guidance $4B. But average growth is 50%, which converts to $8B in Rev for 2025. What will the company do with so much liquidity???"
"Hey, someone check on Simon to see if he’s ok. Gonna be a rough day for him."
28 today
“Technology as Sword and Shield” a conversation Palantir CEO Alexander Karp with CNBC’s Wilfred Frost. 10am EST on Tuesday. Recommend you pay attention - could be our next catalyst.
"If you're smart, this is when you add or buy."
setting up margins account!!!! will all in that on pltr. then will have about 1450 shares
Congress posed all the wrong questions to Brokerages.
Guys I have asked NASA this morning and they confirmed PLTR to the mooooooon

With everyone now getting that extra 1400 you can bet the market will explode. From Bitcoin to Palantir. I'm buying lots in premarket for sho. GLTA 
"Relax longs, this is no squeeze yet. This is just a warm up signal for players to get into the game!"
Those calls I bought today are gonna be gold soon...
Have shares been unlocked yet!? Pls anyone
"Elon Musk - Tesla, Peter Thiel - Palantir"
"Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.[36] Also, according to TechCrunch, ""The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.""[36]U.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.[68]Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California.[69] In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.[70]In 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its ""final operation capacity"" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]Palantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.[72]International Atomic Energy Agency EditPalantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran is in compliance with the 2015 agreement.[40]"
She is making way up. Undervalued stock here It will go back to previous high
$50 end of year.
cathy wood wasn't wrong. if you're short term focused then palantir isn't for you. this is going to be short term bearish.
Can we get a round of ￼ applauds for Palantir.
Almost to my 1k shares
"Insiders are buying, and retail investors are selling now. Employees - insiders - have started to buy PLTR again on the assumption the company will outperform."
Bullish news = price plummets
Looking pretty bullish. Consolidated @ $25 all day with 300 million shares being traded. That's a pretty good sign when 80% of shares became available to be traded in the markets. You could fish for the bottom again on Friday but that's just trying to gamble the bottom. Whoever bought @ $25 did a good job today. Good luck to all tomorrow.
By the end of next week $PLTR will be about $45 I think
Any guesses for closing price? Mine is $25.01
AMAZON BABY
Then they said Futures and Frankfurt is green so we're set for a green day $NIO $PLTR $GEVO $BNGO $JAGX
Bought 950 shares today.
is this a good start or what?!!!!!
"Until the wolves of wall street are finished squeezing every last share out of inpatient investors you can expect to see this same trend. They know that todays ""investor"" i say that lightly given everyone wants immediate returns anymore are losing hope and getting antsy. They also know that there's no company in a better position to absolutely take off on fundamentals AND growth prospects. It's usually one or the other that someone might get in an investment but with Palantir it's very evidently soon to be both. Until they're satisfied there's no use in discussing this stock price"
"OK... I can't buy any more dip.. I'm so tapped out like the guy who threw all his money at the strip joint and can't afford to pay for a lapdance.... Then he comes home to his wife and coudnf afford to pay electric bills... So he had to sell his house and now living in a 1996 Honda civic hatchback... And a gas tank so low, he can only move the car from this block to the next block.... And the block has a liquor store, so he spend his last dollar on cigarettes and will smoke until his last death.. And then his wife cash out his life insurance policy and become 500k richer.. Finally, she will used the money to maybe buy some more palantir on the last dip just before it rises.. She go to her husband graveyard and told her husband he could have been alive to see palantir at 1000 a share."
the only stock I have that is actually green 
"If you don’t buy more after hearing Karp’s comments, you have no idea what you are doing."
We are allowing the rich to get richer because of week hands 
"Just bought 500 more, this is just an expected refuelling pit stop on our way to the moon"
"added 3k at 25.04, thumps up if I made a good decision."
"Why people think contract mean the company will pop??? This is a contract, this is not AWS or MMM will give palantir tons of money immidately.... is a long term good news not short term."
For a Friday beautiful!
"How much do investors really want to keep punishing this stock? Corporate insiders sell shares all the time. Over at Facebook, COO Sheryl Sandberg sells shares pretty much every month like clockwork. It's not as though the insiders at PLTR have sold off all of their shares: they sold a portion and kept a portion. And I'm sure they have share options as part of their compensation package and will be obtaining and selling more shares in the weeks, months, and years to come. But again: How much do we really want to keep punishing this stock? Do investors really believe that this is a $10 or $20 stock? If so, it never should have gone to $45, as it did in January, and it never should have run for 16 straight trading days from late January to mid February with closing prices above $30. Yesterday, for two minutes, investors thought PLTR was a $30 stock. Today, for 15 minutes, investors thought it was a $20 stock. Obviously, it can't be both, and it's unlikely to be either. PLTR is going to become a $50 stock, then an $80 stock, and then a $100 stock. Then, over time, it will become a $200 stock, a $300 stock, and so on. Basically, all it will take to become a solidly $50 stock is news of one or two new major clients, such as an Apple or a Facebook or a foreign government, and a Q1 earnings report that reflects net-positive earnings per share. All the signs are there that from now to the next earnings report, such developments are likely to materialize. By May, if not before, we should see PLTR trading solidly in the $40s and heading into the $50s."
Keep for a week. This will be well above 30sGl
Every time you sell someone is buying
Board up the windows from inside if you bought a lot of shares from PLTR.
THANK YOU ALL WHO SOLD 4K SHARES TO ME AT $28.
Karp was daring you not to buy. He will see where the price is at in a year or so. That's confindece. Lawyers will not let him say anymore.
Stock markets move higher on stimulus and PLTR rises on more news
"Broke 30, Let the WAR BEGIN"
Do you know why Palantir is not going up. Too many people goofin off with contracts instead of picking up shares. Too many of you guys are rollin options. You have to buy shares to bring this up. Period.
Palantir to the moon today!! hit like if you agree
Wonder why insiders are selling the stock in volumes? Any thoughts?
"I'll admit - I'm long as anyone but these last few weeks have truly killed momentum here. I never envisioned multiple visits back to $24-25. I truly believe we'll all look back one day and realize this was just a moment in time. I added 2k shares at $26.25 and thought I was getting a steal. That steal won't be recognized for some time it seems. The earnings report was strong but this stock based compensation negative and the subsequent sales that are being promoted by Yahoo like a feature film while contracts with 3M and others are hardly a blip is putting pressure on the stock. Lastly - I'm of the belief that this is where the stock market saying of money moving from the inpatient to the patient is reality. While our options traders and short term swing traders get burnt and move on, the institutions use that as an opportunity to grab shares without having to move the needle. We may have weeks more of this BS but I do believe that over the next 2-3 earnings calls we'll finally reverse this back to the upside and for the long haul. Gluck everyone!"
Cathie woods only looking at her brings joy  hehhehe . Love PLTR and love cathie . To cathie with love
I have 6100 shares at an average of $26.50...I will hold for 1 to 2 years.
Buy and Hold.
whats you guys price target for this one?
Highly correlated to the Nasdaq index
"hello...all the big upgrades... they can't keep it down forever.... they know... it's the future of technical, analytical data collection... Morgan, Suisse, Goldman... all upgrades... they know.... going to 100 and beyond...."
every tech is green? except pltr? lol
CNBC is doing the job for the boys upstairs .Scaring everyone to sell so they can buy
Who was waiting for $15? Shorts never learn 
AWS = AWSOME!!
Could be huge
once wall street bets is no longer on this. THAT is the time to buy. they're still in denial. have to crush that for this to climb.
SHORT SQUUUUUUUEEEEEEEZEE
From $45 to $23 in one month! Where the longs?
Bagholding 100 shares at $25.69. Any chances of it going upto $40-$50 at all this year?
"Still holding my 2K shares. 1K at $25 and 1K at $22.84. I added 500 more shares at $21. I just can't pass it... PLTR is the future of change, if the trend turn around $50 is coming in a near future!"
In 5 years this will be $250
How about a Costco contract? Need help with the inventories. My favorite bag of snacks is often unavailable ...
Just bought 150 shares
I’m buying way too much of this stock
"All aboard, the  train is leaving the station. Lots of empty seats today."
Average daily volume now doubled in less than 90 minutes.
I'm in 200 shares gl
"In the meantime, analysts at Jefferies Financial Group are also bullish on the stock after earnings, raising their Palantir share price forecast to $40 per share from $30, with an upside scenario price target at $55 per share and a downside target of $20 per share."
pltr is just testing patience right now. hold strong 
notice how they are increasing corporate relationships and didn't list the names of 100 companies they're dealing with. Translation: shorts getting REKKED and they set a consecutive growth number despite 40+% revenue in 1 QUARTER for a reason. The drip of news and PR onslaught coming is going to destroy shorts now. not even considering the one-time IPO costs and compound effect of already signing industry leaders in completely different business domains SELLING ITSELF. Palantir is in a class of its own and the industry leader. Good luck  s
"Oracle earnings very good, this will continue upward momentum for PLTR..."
$RKT and $PLTR in sync today. Like these two companies
What’s everyone’s average cost per share? Holding for 10+ years
"PLTR has strong revenue growth, have strong management team, have strong support from Cathy Wood, and now have strong volume! Share holder goanna sooooo rich holding this stock long term! I predict this stock will be a blue chip stock some day!"
"Dear PLTR stock...Yep... I can see that you are still dancing around $27Nope!!! That's not good enough for me... baby...Get your fat a... [[s]] ... s to $30 Pronto!!! CAPICEI am listening to Justin Bieber song (PLTR Baby):You (PLTR) know you love me, I know you careJust shout whenever and I’ll be thereYou want my love, you want my heartAnd we will never, ever, ever be apart....Baby, baby, baby ohLove..."
45-50 by Friday
My gas and electric company(pg&e) signed a deal with pltr.
"Pretty disgusted with the performance of this stock. Whatever the NASDAQ is down, this is down 3x times as much.￼ But I'm in deep, so I'm staying."
Fast Noney talking about Palantir being the company to help with data analytics in cyber security.
This is going to run again. Tech sell off today as money is rotating into value stocks. Temporary rotation unless 10 year spikes but that shouldn’t happen. This stock will run higher. Too many big institutional buyers and sponsors.
ARKK just bought 5.2 million shares!!! YES I was right about this one-) up we go!
Today volume is so high compared to average volume!
To this over 27 we need a really big contract and good 2nd demo day...
"Karp may not be the best spokesman for a FinTV interview, but his confidence in PLTR reflects where these guys are going. Lonsdale has been the same. Up, up and up...."
New partnerships almost every week! My opinion is get in now!
Cathie Wood on CNBC Closing Bell today:https://youtu.be/SaAt-9OIizw
"After lock up period, only 80 % of initial investors are free to sell not 100% as the lock up was only 80 % of their investments. So if you are one of those investors, have seen this stock at 44, would you sell right away at this price? Maybe some, but No prudent investors would do this. The would wait. I think we are way too bearish about lock up exp and gave shorts such chances like the last 3 days to depress the stock by 20 %. That was the punishment! Shorts won’t stay here for too long!"
How low can it go
wiff on 25
I am so tired looking at the market down every single day!! :(
"PLTR is undervalued if you were to compare them to TSLA. Almost 1/15th the market cap. I also have a position in TSLA but they too must grow into their valuation. Also, the press saying it’s a meme stock is full of it (complete agenda). Wall St and Big Funds do this to delegitimize it and blame someone else for big moves in either direction. Talking heads. The TRUTH is that retail does NOT gap stocks up and down. Period. End of story. The sooner one comprehends and realizes that he or she is one step closer to understanding another part of the game. It WILL be the big funds that move it when sentiment changes and guidance numbers justify large rotation back in and selling insurance puts by funds close. Game changing software. Disruptor. Unique."
GME is going to crash the market again. Hedge funds are being forced to liquidate their liquid assets.
Two companies you should invest now: IA and Blockchain!!! That’s the future. PLTR is a leader in IA besides IBM.?
"I dont matter what happen this week, I'm sure PLTR will pay my payoff home in 1 or 2 year, is very easy know that the price of this company will be up in the future"
"GNOG ready for a huge reversal during early march when warrants expire, easy $30 sp"

This is a $35+ stock
"Im in for long here. But this is stressful, ive lost 13k in this stocks. Idk if I will continue to hold or get out wait for the best time to jump"
"“Over the past two days, three executives filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose the sale of about $18.5 million in stock. That brings total salesdisclosed by Palantir’s leaders this week to nearly $112 million.”...Barrons..."
Limited downside risk but potential of high profit in short term.
this thing isndead in the water
PLTR is a long term play. I will continue to buy shares at these incredibly low prices knowing PLTR is poised for greatness. Just give it 5 years and we’ll see $150-$200
GME all over again. I am in.
Of course Cathy loaded up so do I
Covert Slacktion where are you

ARK has 150 price target !!!!!
"Red on Mondy, Red on Tues, Red on Wedensday and so on... Regardless market is green or red. Is it too hard to tell?you can never wake up a person who is pretending sleep....."
"I saw all these comments when PLTR tanked 16-20% after the Citron news, followed by a period of red as the market struggled.And today we sit discussing the mid-30s and potentially reaching $40.What’s the point: stay patient and enjoy the ride .Held through all the volatility and red days during the consolidation period when we couldn’t seem to break the $20s and I won’t be selling a share.Scared money don’t make money. $9.45/share and long"

Whats a fair market cap for this company? 100 billion or $50 ish per share seems to be best case scenario?
I have a first confession:I have 100% of my account loaded with PLTRI have a second confession:I have another 100% of another account loaded with PLTRI have some good news:BOTH accounts are GREENI am a BAD INVESTOR because I am not diversifying my portfolio...BUT... I like to login to both of my accounts and see GREEN everywhere...It's definitely RISKY.... Pray for me!!!

Fly baby fly!!!
Tired of seeing this in red
Is this a temporary blip on my screen? I am seeing it over 25 in afterhours now. Please let there be some news driving it...
"I think we found support. It’s not going down to 25. Boys that bought in the 30’s, hold tight we are coming to get you."
I am long at $32.50. Long term this company is a no-brainer. Short-term volatility and downward pressure are normal especially with the lock-up period expiring recently. I have a feeling next quarter will blow away all the estimates and we will see a consistent run-up. GLTA!

"There is a number a reasons why it is up after hours. Big buyers last couple of days, the agreement with IBM but Snowflakes earrings and forward guidance is what’s moving it after hours."
We are not gonna move up until we see good earnings report
5hrs and 6 mins to end green plenty of room for upside
The stock is tremendously undervalued rt now. will be over $50 by end of June!!! Stay patient
I would already be happy if we hit 28$ during the week.
A correction was inevitable tbh. But the conference call should relieve investors

"It seems that we need to CONTINOUSLY COUNSEL our PLTR brethren to HOLD THE LINE..We do know ery well the games played by both the Shorts and Hedge FundsDo not trade PLTR on a daily basis.I understand that you want to make profits.So, how about this: Hold for 30 days until Quarter One Reports.You have to understand that squizing the Shorts = FORCING the Shorts to cover = FORCING them to buy PLTR at $30, $40, $50, etc...You have to understand the game of the Shortz and play hard balls..."
Already trending
Company has been around 15+ years but suddenly it's going to be worth hundreds of billions? This is a $10 stock at BEST.

should I sell at $200?
I just really need to see a couple of green days please.
Do you guys know at what time is the interview with Karp?
Monday opening price 32$
The share price is going down. I guess something good would be a statement from the management or CEO and calming the market?Why is this not there?Are they too busy selling their shares?
Palantir will be trading around 168 end of year... No need to trade. Just let the stock work for you.. Long term play..
The overall trend of PLTR is upwards. The trend is your friend. Thank me later
200 more shares at $29.85Just moved my average to $20 per share. In since $10.
"I don't know about you all, but it's kind of hard not to want to give all your money to a company whose Chairman wrote a #1 New York Times bestselling book about business and gives interviews and speeches telling everyone that competition is for losers and monopoly is the condition of every successful business."
"Why Palantir is King of AI? Because I said is was first, it conduct business w/ gov & wants to take seriously privacy & civil liberties by creating council of advisory, so on & so forth."
Facebook contract announcement coming soon. New Facebook job postings note experience with Palantir software.

Not even Google AI or AppLe AI can beat Palantir. This is like SkyNet level.I will buy more. PALANTIR
Slow and steady is much better. Great day!!! Will continue green into earnings
"It turned out shorting PLTR is very right decision, 15 is first target. This is just a friendly reminder to dreaming bulls as I was before."
"Market will try to shake weaker hand again, I am assuming it is going to stabilize by the end of the week, the stock broke a very important support at 23-22.5 on Friday. it should continue the down trend for few more sessions or at least retest the 20 level before bouncing back. I think it is good idea buying more shares if it goes down and averaging down. The a very strong long term investment stock, but it may be painful for short term trades."
Load the boat time!!
"Bought 1,500 shares @ 28.05, will be holding for the next 1-2 years. GLTA."
"This is the calm before the storm. Get in now, it's oversold, by/after earnings this will be $40-$45."
Appreciate PLTRs transparency with a Q and A from shareholders. Very bullish.
This thing is gonna rebound to $40 soon.
The fact that we’re in green today shows that PLTR is very strong.
Hopefully this is a consistent climb into the close.
"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/george-soros-top-5-stock-picks-2-921203/4/Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), which was founded by legendary investor and PayPal’s cofounder Peter Thiel, swelled significantly since its debut on New York Stock Exchange. Soros Fund has converted its early investment in Palantir into publicly traded shares in September and it is the second-largest stock holding of Soros Fund Management, according to the latest filing."
"Healthy consolidation. Buy, buy, buy!"

Still buckled in
PLTR earning report on Tuesday before market opens.
Green in the end
"Feeling of shorting PLTR is so sweet! thanks for bagholders, you are not investor, just a wishful dream bull."
Although we aren't close to the record highs late Jan/early Feb. the performance of this stock over the past several weeks should shut up the naysayers about the future potential of this stock and its future exponential growth. The share has been diluted by insiders sales and it still is holding strong. Time for all the haters to go elsewhere or tend to their own portfolios lol
"What... am I reading things very wrong or is institutional ownership now at 22,49%, up from 12% a month ago? Source fintel"

"Daily, 5-Day, 6-Month, YTD, and 1Year chart are all green and higher. The only red chart where PLTR is lower is the 1-Month chart, but that will change very soon as PLTR takes off."
"Big dumps simultaneously across the board in $GME, $TTOO, $SENS, $BNGO, $ZOM, $CTRM, $AMC, and $PLTR. Talk to me about manipulation."

"We are at the bottom now, it will not go down any further."
Sell on the news!!! Buy back and now I think 22.00++ and I will be in like Flynn....
"Biggest problem for PLTRThis company has a lack of communication, it remains in opacity and doesn't understand how to be transparent.I wrote to the investors relation dpt but no answer : i'ld like to know what does mean stock-based compensation. Is it a one time charge or a recurrent charge. This is important. Without that, pltr generates earnings.Very strange that we have no idea of earnings guidance and no analyst is able to give some prediction.Communication is very bad and it's not Karp who is able to improve it.Think to Steve Jobs, Bill Gates...."
Back to be red for days straight

Let’s hope for a nice green for PLTR tomorrow
Expect strong short squeeze tomorrow and Friday to tackle unusual $23 option calls activity seen yesterday!
PLTR Announces a Six Year Deal with French Company!
"What we will find out Tuesday and what we’ve been saying for a long time, most private sector companies, DO NOT, want their name public after signing with Palantir, for obvious competitive reasons. We know from their website that they are now in many many new industries. Also, through great detective work from members on this board, high level companies are hiring people with Palantir experience. The numbers will come out during the ER, that they can’t hide. With software companies, they recognize a portion of the revenue during the quarter the contract is signed and the rest as incurred. That’s the beauty of long term contracts, they recognize maintenance and support revenue every quarter for the duration of the contract. They essentially become utility companies just like Comcast or National Grid. It’s the gift that keeps on giving."
Can anyone tell why the value is falling when the company has shown good reporting and confidently predicted further growth?
Isn’t it at 45 not long ago ?
Strong rebound. Glad I bought into the dip while this was in the $21s. Officially in the green overall on PLTR
Ending $25+ today!
Slow bleed now to $20

"I do think the huge dilution since the lock up expired is our worst enemy. That's the only way to explain why this is at 23 and not 43. The business is amazing and during one all cylinders. It's the 2,500 employees who are shooting themselves in the foot by selling their shares at a discount. Once this levels off it will be up up up. But when will that be?"

Ok serious question tho. To the moon but where is the moon. Should I sell at 100 200 or 300. If Monday reaches 90 should I take profit?
Calling all bulls
"Another demo day... Imagine.. Instead of reaching 45 dollars, we reach 60s!"

SNOW dropping after hours.
TESLA and ATI contracts could be coming very soon
"Instead of selling average down. If you sell on a loss within 30 days, you get ding during tax season. Also, PLTR is one of a kind AI / SAAS company and with economic uncertainty comes opportunity."

"Hey bashers, it was nice having you all here for the laughs, but we’re gonna have to cut this short. Palantir is going back up now, bye!"

bought more CALLS.
"ARKK bought another 460,000 shares on an ugly day and sold Appl, Facebook, PayPal and Google... Let that resonate some.."
"Today signals what many of already knew. This company is a paper tiger. There is no confidence it it either from investors, and especially insiders. When Thiel, Cohen, and Sankar sold millions of shares in the 20s, I jpknew this was headed down fast. These guys are capitalists first and foremost. If they thought the 40s, or even the 30s was quickly within reach they would have held of an up to 50 percent increase in gain. Instead, they dumped bigly. Talk about sending a signal to shorts. They may as well have put up a billboard in Times Square saying “Hi, I’m Palantir. SHORT ME!” As I’ve said before, this company has been commented on as the next Google. I see it at the next ENRON."
We have support above $24 now
PLTR is BIG ... new contract after new contract ...etc
Buy-dont mind short time fluctuations- keep look back in 5 years = rich
"Hamilton themed PLTR, just to annoy the shorts...https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxgpa3/i_spent_four_hours_writing_hamiltonthemed_pltr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb"
"PLTR is the Microsoft of data management for now and the future...btw MSFT = 1.79 Trillions Mkt Cap, but PLTR = 48.7 Billions and their next goal of Mkt cap will be 100B, 200B, 300B+..... during the next 3-5 years with a many more big partnerships....coming soon."
"Hey yahoo, why do you keep deleting comments?"
"Yep, this is more like it!"
30 close possible with funds buying
Snowflake is at $300+ and these guys are only at $33? PLTR has more employees and has been inking some big contracts. Hopefully more commercial presence. Also teaming with IBM? Maybe these things provide a boost.
I really don't understand how the SEC don't see a mayor fraud with Shorts and Options manipulation with a tone of options due tomorrow at $25 to $20 strike price.
I'm a longterm investor and I'm glad Palantir is down and might be down for some time. Good opportunity to get rid of all the spineless jellyfish who can hold a stock no longer than a fart.
"I have no idea what the overall market is going to do, but I love that this stock wants to outperform. Very encouraging."
"Institutional investment is up 100% from 10% in December to 21% now. if you don't understand what this company does and why this stock is a goldmine, go and trade something else. you do not belong here."
"Wow, who dumped these 120,000 shares afterhours?!"
Just out Blackbro just added 3 million shares...
"Regarding the lockup period expiration, if it were in the high 30s to 40s I would say we would see a sell off but since it’s been demolished like it is now why would one sell when it’s low and potential so high??But of course nothing makes sense with this stocks movement :))"
5 other institutions besides Ark invest loaded up today billions of dollars worth of shares. Again this is like getting in Microsoft when it was 20$ It’s crazy cheap now. For sure will pass 100$ this year!
$31 opening tmr?
You still have a chance premarket
What negative again? This doesn't make any sense to me! We just had another partnership and this keeps going down?!
Prediction:1. PLTR will go up to $25 by 10am Eastern Time (ET)2. Then it will go down to $24 and $23 by close of business3. Commentators will say the usual: Cathie wood is buying. Vanguard is buying. Shorts are affecting the price. etc...4. While others will say To The Moon!!!Fair enough?
It will be great to wake up Tuesday morning and see my money in PLTR double and shorties scurry to cover their lost.
Stuck at 37 Fml
"ARK , Mrs Wood bought more today , $60 million worth , google it"
"The company, co-founded in 2003 by billionaire Peter Thiel, signed 21 contracts each worth $5 million or more during the fourth quarter and said it expects sales in the first quarter to grow by about 45% from a year ago."
Strategy:1) Let girly weak hands continue to sell at a loss.2) Wait until the carnage stops.3) Swoop down and scoop up all the cheap shares.4) Stay long and get rich.
Sell Apple And buy more pltr
Black Friday?
have no idea. why people are bullish on this but okay.
ARK also bought 2 out of the 3 stocks I bought today! I’m patting myself on my backLet’s go!!
CEO SPEAKING RIGHT NOW CNBC
Just imagine what's gonna happen when Palantir announces a big contract with a Microsoft or a Tesla. To the moon !
Ark buying up shares large blocks
"got in at 29, been down ever since...."
"Wow, 170M shares exchanged today. Why did it tank on a green day? Can Cathie continue to double down or must investors stop her? My friend bought some Ark ETF and is losing a lot of money."
The only regret I have is I didnt buy more 
"GME gets halted, NASDAQ recovers! haha"
Premarket spooks.....
"Just purchased $28,500 worth of shares. It's flattening out at a good support I like this one. Happy to lose."
"Lol, short shorts are so desperate here. Watch they run for cover once the lights are on. Stay calm and be confident. BUY and HOLD."
Wow 3 plus mil shares. That’s a lot of shares!! Some shorts in here have 20 shares and trying to bash the company. GTLA
"Cathie Wood’s funds take big hits as Tesla and the tech trade show signs of unwinding. Shares of Palantir, Tesla, Roku, Square, Paypal, Teladoc, Baidu, Zillow, Shopify and Spotify were all down big, in many cases by double-digits. All were major holdings in funds like her flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).Shortly after the open, her flagship Ark Innovation Fund was down 11%. By 10 a.m. ET, a half-hour after opening, it had already traded more than 8 million shares, a full day’s volume. By midday, it had traded 30 million shares.And then, a half hour after opening, the selling let up. The fund was last down about 6% and 11% for the week."
In 10 years I’ll be one of the early few who has shares under 25. Very excited to watch this grow slowly. Excellent company with a bright future
If this dips to 22 I am adding another 8000 shares..PLTR and NIO
Been wrong all day but now it's my turn to be right. This will pop big time after hours and into tomorrow.
"Weak hands are all out, right? Now it's the show time, it will get back to $40 in 3 weeks. Why? Because money talks. ARK and other institutions invest heavy money in PLTR, they will turn it on. Plus it's a great company, whatever you weak hands think, the earnings report increase my confidence. It's actually a great report, it's just too many short term gamblers in this pot, now they are out I am happy."
why did cathie sell aapl to buh this? isnt aapl part of a bigger thing...and why this? can someone help me pleease i have lost so much money that i actually needed for other things but got caught up in this ...it was like a video game...i just kept putting credits in to play and before i knew it i was down like 18 dollars and then you know its history
"I bought at $9.34 for 10k shares and I added another 1k shares at $24.01 today. I've been through ups and downs from $9 - $45. I won't sell any single share for the next 2-3 years. I will add more, if it's down lower than $24 again."
JUST ADDED 400 SHARES
40 by Friday !
"How does a company continually make no profits and proceed to stay in business? It seems counterintuitive at best. However, companies can become successful even without turning profits for extended periods of time – and can even simultaneously continue to attract investors.There are three basic ways big companies survive without profits.Purposeful Reinvestment – Earnings are significant and large, but the company chooses to put most of its revenues back into the business to keep propelling growth. Amazon is the king of purposeful reinvestment, infrequently reporting a profit in its more than twenty years of existence and following an overt strategy focused on continued growth over profits. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the revenue and base to allow profits, but it argues that without constant investment in its business, the company would be overtaken by competitors in different fields.Hopeful Expansion – Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is a good example of this category. With recent acquisitions such as Vine, Periscope and MoPub, Twitter is trying to carve out a larger social media presence but is dealing with considerable expenses, including almost 45 percent of revenue paid out in compensation as stock options. As opposed to Amazon, the intent is to reach and sustain profitability.Initial Growth – The company shows incredible growth and promise in its early stages and secures venture capital..."

"In the end the shorts are not going to matter. All the analysts aren't going to matter. The statistics and technical data is not going to matter. The only thing that is going to matter, is Palantir is producing products and services that companies and governments simply, can't do without. And right now, and in the foreseeable future nobody else comes close."
Cathie’s target is $150 is this true??
"Going to fair value = 7.25 $ soon. Last chance, let's do it..."
I’ve been doing this for awhile. This isn’t a pajama boy Reddit stock. I hate that it’s come to that because this is a pioneer in an industry that’s going to be needed more than ever soon. Long.
30s
BFT OVER $17 soon
On my way to 1k shares thanks to those who are selling
sounds like vegas in here
I don't worry about Palantir at all. I bought a few thousand shares and plan to hold for many years! We could be looking at a $200 stock in 3-5 years.
Palantir. Possibly the greatest bag holder stock ever created.
"I’m in at 37 down heavy, what’s the timeline im looking at here"
BUY and HOLD !!!!
is it me or does it feel like something or someone high up is trying to keep this stock down ?????
"For some reason I compare this to the facebook IPO, it will go to $100 and $200 in the next years. Just be patient and add more on the dips"
Who is buying this #$%$ tonight?
Hi - My name is John and I’m really bitter towards PLTR. Can you help me find my baseball?
Soros selling for ethical reasons. Have seen it all now.
"I’m sorry, but does the WSB crowd actually know what direction the moon is in?"
Karen from fast money mentioned about $PLTR.Looks like bottom reached.

"PLTR has read color only. 15 is short term target, long term is zero,"

Newbie here... I have 400 shares of this stock which I’m not worried about but I also have 3/19 55 calls... are these call options dead?
Guys pls don’t sell PLTR.. more ppl would panic more the selling will occur and prices would drop.. let’s stand strong.. pltr to 50!!
"For the fourth quarter, Palantir reported an adjusted profit of 6 cents per share, including stock-based compensation. Revenue climbed 40% to $322 million, said the provider of data analytics software to U.S. government agencies.Analysts had projected a 2-cent adjusted profit on revenue of $300.7 million. 40 % not good enough. . Show me another company that has a 40 % revenue."
This seems like clockwork. The yield on the 10 yr Treasury spikes today and suddenly PLTR stock drops at the same time.
"Special companies only come around rarely. If you lack the conviction to buy Palantir at $26+, then you might as well keeping loading up on AT&T for its dividend."
Yesterday bears where are you???? uh

"ARK bought 57,720 shares today, in ARKK etf"

Truly appreciate honest and insightful feedback form finance forums but can’t wrap my head around how many trolls waste their time posting nonsense ..Why waste your time being that person?
It boggles my mind why this stock performs the way it does. all signs say it should be rising

Long and strong....bought my first shares October 1st.......
I'm all in since the day one when they went to direct listing. Palantir is one of the most innovation tech company in our life; Gotham & Foundry are pretty much dominated the government's sector and Apollo will be changing the way retail and commercial user in their OS in either #$%$ Back Office. I'm long in his stock because I see their potential...
Just received my salary and I wish this could be under 24...to buy more...
"Love seeing news coming up and price stay pretty much the same, more opportunities to load some more shares with greatness certainty.I won’t be surprise to see price go sharply upwards in the next 1-2 months when more deals and coverages will pop up. GLTA."
"I am long and holding. Tomorrow will probably be rough, lock up expires. Be prepared. Brighter days ahead for longs after that."
I'm 30% down 
"one more thing: having worked with Amzn, I can tell you that if Palantir enters into a partnership with them it is because Amzn does not have sufficient capacity to do it himself. This is not pejorative because amzn already has very good engineers, PLTR has the best.We will quickly see the results and many companies around the world will be won over by Palantir's platforms.Apple, Facebook, Google and others?"
A lot of new enthusiasm : )
"Same old Wall Street move :1) Sky is falling market crash, stop losses are taken and panic investors sell.2) Pundits come on Saturday morning cable shows to remind us they knew this was coming,3) Message board at Yahoo gets wild with the short haters and the cry baby's that lost their lunch money and blame, curse PLTR.4) Next week PLTR comes with more great news and we move back up to 30 range.5) I watch ,wait and learn . Release GOTHAM !"
The controlled dip right before close to 24's then uptick to close over 25 is indicator for call pricing.Going to be fun when the Ferrari gets to her straight away...

"if palantir dips today again, no worries because mama Cathie is going to buy more shares. But its not going to dip.......still very undervalued for what they do.......and pre market says it all"
"I have finished watching the interview with Palantir CEO Alex Karp.Here are some points:1. Palantir is working hard with both IBM and AWS (these companies like the modularity of the Palantir software)2. Invest in Palantir long term. He specifically mentioned some good stuff coming in the next 2 years3. Alex Karp has a PhD from Germany4. Palantir software = Modular = Easy to integrate with the software of other companies5. As a CEO of a public company, he's not allowed to predict where PLTR price will be (His lawyers told him NOT to speculate)6. Alex Karp thinks that many people investing in Palantir are engineers who are investing their own money, with no safety net, and believe in Palantir's future7. For some reason, Alex Karp doesn't seem to like Silicon valleyPeace!"
"If Aunt Cathie bought over 3 million shares, then PLTR is going to be just fine"
Funny how people say $ 24 is in support of that shares. If the Nasdaq drops -1% it will fly -10%. It doesn't have any support points.

"Any shares bought under $30 will make you money in the short term (less than a year). Any shares bought under $40 will make you money in the long term.

We in a good place now Tec. rebounding hard. this going back to 40
I have the impression Wallstreet is shorting the FAANG's at stupendous levels. They targeted Apple the hardest. They're grabbing two quarters of solid earnings at November levels. Behold the genius of Wallstreet. Robot trading and collusion. They get to peek around the corner and compress the stairwell to ground levels. They created a financial time machine. No risk for the real insiders. Martha Stewart went to prison for a 100K trade though. Nice system.
lets not celebrate now. Our real victory is when it crosses $30. Lets hang in.
"No matter the results, this company has just started. BP contract was biggest-1.2B for ten years in 2014 and was extended. On IBM interview they said IBM is bigest so far. It needs more time to monetize all contracts."

"Just looking at today's chart, if it can hold above 24.65 or so and rise to above 25 again, that will be a definite trend of higher highs and higher lows intraday. While we know anything can happen, and Nasdaq is taking a dump, it does look like it is on a good trajectory today! We'll see."
Massive volume!!!!
It’s only down because of the lockup expired employees can dump shares and lots of em. Can’t blame them they been holding since they started most are holding. Good sign
I just bought 100shares
"I told you this is going to be like Facebook. first 6 months it was going up and down, their data is massive, and eventually , this will go higher . just hold on to it. do nt do day trading on this stock , you lose"

Palantir’s double-click event to demonstrate they platform across multiple industries. Hopefully they can demonstrate client testimonials.

Going to be a huge pre-market Tuesday!! Could see a 5 point jump. All institutions buying is like a smoke signal seen from miles around!! FOMO

"Palantir and 3M Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply Chain02/23/2021DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) today announced a multi-million dollar expansion of its relationship with 3M. 3M has chosen to expand its use of Palantir's Foundry platform to support its digital transformation, assisting in the build out of a dynamic supply chain that enables the global manufacturer to respond nimbly to changes in demand across tens of thousands of products.“In an increasingly complex world, the success of our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to changing facts on the ground,” said Brig Knott, 3M’s Vice President, End to End Service, Operations & Lean Six Sigma. “In the midst of a global pandemic and significant changes to our demand across products, the Foundry platform enabled us to react quickly and effectively. We’re excited to expand this work across the 3M enterprise.”“3M has been at the forefront of digital transformation, and we’re excited to deepen our relationship with this innovative and global company,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir.This expanded relationship builds on the work Palantir already supports across 3M’s efforts in supply chain alerting, demand forecasting and business planning. “Palantir has played an important role for our Enterprise Operations digital migration strategy; we’re eager to keep pushing the boundaries to ensure a continued focus on our customers,” noted Shaun Braun, 3M’s VP of Digital Transformation."

They raised interest rates on bonds so they could pull big money out of stocks to buy bonds. “Legal” market manipulation. Just hold or dollar cost average unless you really need to sell.

So glad to be here at the beginning. I see Palantir as the next Tesla of the data. Information worth more than almost everything. I see it above $1000 in the next 5 years.
Everyone thinks they are smarter then the next guy.

CEO Alex Karp. The shorts’ best friend!
"Perfect, while I was hoping it would be a little higher, that was the top I was looking for. There is enough intraday data now to confidently say there is an upward trend and momentum on the stock today. Barring something stupid happening in the world, we should see a reversal of this slide down trend we’ve had over the past three or four days.JMHO"
Hit 30 so I can sell this.
Poor people who sold on fear yesterday never let your emotion interfere with business remember the fundamentals of the company you invested in.PLTR is a Diamond in the rough ￼
Just bought 19.800 euro’s of palantir shares!!!Greetings from Holland!
My average is $34 guys and hope to see $50 this year!
My only red stock today. Lets see what the last 36 minutes do.
We closing Green today
Samething in November 2020. Miss ER and stock price dropped 1 day only and never see 13-14-15-16 again.Now is good time to buy. Never seen 29-30 again.
i like it very slow lets go pltr! not too fast!
please go to 15
i guess good news is no news these days with tech...i thoght amzn would have had a bigger effect
6.6 million shares traded during after hours ... interesting trading day tomorrow! Wallstreetbets?
Will jump once NEW lucrative contracts are announced. Stand by.
This is 50$ by June Watch 100$ eoy
Shoutout to the bashers who told me I’d be a bag holder buying below $10 after DPO day .Hope you spent that money you saved wisely
PLTR will print in the power hour
i just get in 26
craxy trading again. oh
$45 looks like ancient history. We seem quite range bound in the mid $20's and can't see us going up from here until earnings improve dramatically.
"Temporary slowdown into lunch, have a great green day longs!"
$30 by Friday...
"i just grabbed shares at the low of the day with pltr being well off its 52 wk high in the mid 40's ~~ software for counter-terrorism in the world we live today seems like a no brainer on this one...... go pltr,,"
I bought at $32 thinking it can't get below $25. Really annoying and it is surprising how little love the stock gets from the media. I don't plan to sell until summer at least but I can't say I didn't expect it to move down this fast.
"To all the people out there fixated on why insider's sold their shares.......I believe in PLTR's bright future as do the insiders. They did not dump every share they own, no just a small portion. Now if I had to the chance to take a little money of the table, I would do the same thing. It's just good horse sense. A) Maybe they want to splurge a little bit and B) Most importantly DIVERSIFICATION!!!!!!! Other than the YOLO crowd, would you leave all your eggs in one basket! This is where the good horse sense comes in, take a little of the table and diversify. Makes perfect sense to me."
"Public Announcement folks, Please realize that you shorts have been fighting to get the price down vs Longs betting the price will go up but for the last two weeks the price still +-25. a share and the only ones making money are the hedge funds that manipulate your thoughts by selling you false dreams and misleading information on both sides and we make fun of you when the price goes up and you shorts do the same when it goes down and we are pinned against each other and the winners are The HEDGE FUNDS.Palantir will go up to $50 by the end of March and yes it will be over valued and will correct itself then you and I can really make some money."
Will pltr be the next Apple? Yes.
Mood today
"I'm ready for the thumbs down. What a bunch of WHINERS the majority of new posters on this board have been. The fact that this is holding up at this price despite what's happening in the market at the exact same time of the lockup expiration is not only a miracle but a show of strength. You have funds ADDING regularly while the many of you complain of stagnation. For starters, this is up 150% since DPO only 5 months ago. The earnings report was a thing of BEAUTY outside of the stock based compensation (which means very little in it's infancy as a public company). The insider sales have happened at EVERY SINGLE company regardless of vertical. Facebook, Google, Appl, AMZN take your pick people. The village nit wits that want you to believe this is some malpractice by PLTR leadership are a joke and only attempting to scare you.This is primed and pumped to be a CASH COW...The upside to this pandemic has been many more people are at home and investing out of boredom. No boss or anyone else to look over your shoulder while you frequent message boards or your holdings account. That downside is every Tom, Dianna and Harry wants to be a day trader, looking for immediate returns. Invest in this long term and be graced with profits that you've only previously dreamt about. How many times has someone said ""wish I bought TSLA"", ""wish i bought Appl"" ""wish I bought Msft"" etc etc. This is your opportunity to buy a future MEGA cap company. Enjoy the price stagnation by loading up. I was able to increase my position by 4x since my initial entry at $10...I continue to buy because I've done my RESEARCH...It's a beautiful thing to educate yourself and have a vision for the direction of our planet..If you can do both you sleep like a baby owning this stock...If rely on others, you're subject to manipulation from the best of them.#notallthatisgoldglitters - Yes thats PLTR password for the demo, same PLTR that issued 30%+ growth guidance through 2025 but certainly feel free to disregard and listen to a message board bear on why this is worth $10."
"Tuesday morning... AMAZING news and BLOWOUT earnings, pre market price $45!"
Why is this meme stock down
Whole market was down and this is up. Amazing
"Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years - LL Cool J"
Just added more... IBM doesn’t partner with pump and dump companies and neither does the United States government.
OTW to $30's.....
"It s amazing to see masive drop after amazing earning report today,, i think some people dont know math and calculation..Hope it drop a bit more than i can get more shares ,, easily $50 after a few weeks time with that financial reports inc lockup period,, and many hedge founds get your shares very cheap prices...i am quite happy for my investing so far with palantir..."
"Why is Yahoo removing some of our postings? Over 50% of my postings get censored because they don't apparently coincide with Yahoo's leftwing agenda. Anyone who said they don't understand how Adolph was able to rise to power in Germany back in the 1930's merely has to watch what is happening at CNN, MSNBC, Yahoo, Huffington Post, Twitter, and other extremist leftwing anti America propaganda outlets to see that it could potentially happen here!"
"Yes, $29 buy limit went through. Next stop $28. Come on panic sellers keep doing your thang."
I remember the First day this started trading .. this was the day that changed my future .. considered myself to be a lucky one!
Doubled down and bought another 3000 shares. I love these dips. Long term hold and pay less in taxes when you sell a year later for $69.420 a share.
We win today because absolutely nothing happened. lol
"Baron Rothschild, an 18th-century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that ""the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.""So, shall we buy PLTR?"
Gonna order that black 2021 corvette I dreamed of so much
"Even if the price is going to $15, Palantir is gold and the price will come back and go forward. Don’t worry longs!"
I heard short squeeze starting March 5
There are more ballers on yahoo finance! Every board has tons of people buying 1000s of shares a day . Unbelievable
The night never sleeps in denver!
What a surprise?Still 25#$Lol this is too funny
now or never
Fellas Where do you see this stock in 5 years time ?
Get in the discount
this has been oversold since its IPO release hahahahahaha
Every time I sit on the sideline I miss all the action on every stock i have owned...when i buy the bottom falls out everytime and when I sell they all rocket!!! Hard to win.
Weld Fargo and chase won’t deposit stimulus until Wednesday.
Bought 100 at $31 and add 100 more at $24.99
$50 by end of next quarter. Latest deal hasn't filtered through so expect a sharp jump to 30s.
POWER HOUR BABY
you guys see how the dow is trading close to pre-pandemic levels. nasdaq needs to correct to those levels as well. that's why you don't put 40x multiples on a stock. It's insanity. This is going to drop to like 15 bucks probably.
"It is really funny. I love this bad sentiment and loser sellouts way more than optimistic buying spree. When the consensus is bashing the company, that is the time where you can make money. Not when everybody si hyping like mad."
https://youtu.be/cJbuDp5bLjw
did everyone hear the news about pltr teaming up with AWS whoever they are. they're new ability to unlock 50 million dollars worth of savings with companies and will only gain strength with other companies wanting the same abilities
"Normally CEO is a very top position who declared completion of sales yesterday. Probably that’s the end of selling for now. Now that the sell is completed for now, it should slowly turn green starting tomorrow. They will try to ramp up the price for a while and then probably when the price is above 45-50 they might sell again. That would be a logical action for them rather than selling this cheap."
Nasdaq broke 13k support. I do not know what will happen now but I stay long PLTR.
WoW: 10 million shares so far and we are still holding the $23.5 defense line
Palantir can predict a lot of changes and the Company uses their own software for their own gain as well. Sky is the limit!
People taking profit?

"in earnings call , they said PLTR tech will be inside every rocket every Humvee. they signed biggest deal with US defense Dept. if you heard the earnings call you know why stock recovering again ."
"Ark like PLTR .. where is the problem ? hold , buy on a dip!"
"Mute the  people. They want you to sell your shares. If you do panic and sell, there are plenty of true longs, including major institutions, that are happy to buy them."
This is going to the moon.
I dont think the interview w Karp went well. Who wants an emotional leader with a chop on his shoulder running a billion dollar company? He sounded unhibged and unfocused on the goal.
Be patient. It did this yesterday too
"Dear Shorts,1. YOU gave all of us LONGS a heartburn and headache for several weeks...2. It's our turn NOW...3. As Bart Simpson says: Eat My Shorts Man!4. I am singing loud:....

Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!....5. My dream of becoming a millionaire in the next 2 years is starting to take off today!!!Peace!"
Lockup expiring tomorrow...expect a lot of sell off and a potential price dip...an opportunity to buy more!

"Just bought 100,000 more shares!!"
Do those who have taken a short position realize Revenues will most likely be close to $2B for 2021? A lot of cash!!!!
Reddit investors will set this stock go real soon $ 75 soon
Only bought this because of Cathie.
I feel like im taking an educated gamble with PLTR. The more DD i do though the better i feel . I think this company has the potential to help form the MORTAR for many solid companies . In a post COVID digital economy I see more and more cracks opening forPLTR to fill with such great innovative products.
"Confessions of a PLTR stock holder:1. I have loaded the ""F"" truck and only 9 dollars are left in my investment account2. I want PLTR to reach The Moon3. I am OK with $1 to $2 up per day and hopefully we'll cross the $30 bridge sometime in late March-20214. I have goals and dreams to become a millionaire (YEP!!! $1 MILLION dollars) using PLTR stock...5. I was told if I LOAD the ""F"" truck, I can get there sometime this year... or maybe next at the latest...6. I am just counting on $1 increments per day for PLTR stock...7. I have been listening to this song since 8am EST time: ""kiki do you love me"" to keep my hopes up8. The song ""kiki do you love me"" worked great from 8am to 10am EST when PLTR reached about $25.69. The afternoon was depressing... I am going to find me a different song for tomorrow... Any suggestions?Peace!"
Brothers in PLTR...who’s got diamond hands???
"Repost - Important people understand this. Not looking for love just want those who care to be long to understand impact.AWS - If you don’t understand the impact of this agreement. You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused. Which is where the small PLTR sales team and IBM reps will pitch PLTR.AWS enterprise agreements require customers to spend x amount of money per year but that money can be spent across their platform products as well (which now includes Foundry)That’s right if you have an AWS Enterprise Agreement you are obligated to maintain a certain amount of spend across their platform products in order to maintain your EA and it’s negotiated discounts.Customers will literally be using Foundry, making palantir money simply out of necessity which will lead to further adoptionLastly - My tech sales counterparts who work for Amazon (AWS) are incentivized handsomely for selling adoption into partner solutions. Aka we just gathered an AWS sales force as well to go along with our IBM team and our direct team.AWS accessibility of Palantir for customers is a big deal."
IN AT 43!!! WITH 20K!!! still holding strong
This has to be the biggest steal in the stark market today.
Palantir or Apple? I have a lot of money in both. I am down 8k in Apple and 2k in Palantir. I need to sell some for personal reasons. Which one would you sell?
"Shoutout to all the Nostradamus’s & experts that are nowhere to be found since tech started bouncing back.Yeah, told ya this would happen.Wannabe “investors” running at the first sign of trouble, lol laughable "
"About 65 days until Q1 2021 earnings. 45% YoY growth (and take into consideration that management normally gives conservative guidance). During these next 2 months, announcements will come. So now the unskilled retail investor sells, but institutions (smart money) adds b/c understand what's coming."
Palantir will be the most important software company in the world delivered in the world's most efficient way. Period.
Thumb up if you caught the dip of PLTR in the past 1 week!
NASDAQ and S&P500 are down! It is good to be green! and not 8% down!
"With all the gov contracts pltr gets, and now commercial contracts with foundry and Apollo. That makes pltr more expensive than Lockheed in my opinion"
If it does fall in load up
Analysts expect Palantir earnings per share of 2 cents vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue grew 31% to $300.7 million
"Hello everyone, I am new to this forum, and I am not so sure if you use this via to be serious, or just nonsensical comments. Queation: Does anyone know or can explain why this company is almost 8 times more valuable than Globant (Glob), which is a technology company, with more experience in industry, the same business, and with practically the same level of revenue and income? I'm analysing which decision is more convenient for me. I read you.Thank you very much!"
green baby that like shows a long green bean on charts it s agood thing
Ok so insiders sold. So what? It’s nice to know that PLTR is not run by dummy’s . They did two things. They made a lot of money and they gave us an opportunity to make money too!
These bears keep acting like they know more than Cathie LMAO
"Saw many bearish people comment here right now, which usually means pltr will soaring today"
Sold some AAPL to load up more. Thanks panic sellers. 
This a long play
This stock will drop again

why would people sell this lol!!
It's ready to take off
"when you hear ""LONG TERM"",thats Looser terminology, ceo is a big Loosa,get ready for the losses,Cathy is selling now."
Ten year Treasury is 1.672 and spiking again.
Cathie bought 2.6 million today stockwits say that numbers watching are up from 90 thousand to 130 thousand and speculate over the next 5 days the redit group have pltr in its sights for a push now I personally would rather redit stayed away we don't need them pltr is an honest company with powerful fundamentals with great investors behind it it's massively undervalued tomorrow we should see $27_28
"I'm liking this price action. All the technicals are pointing up for continued stock price appreciation, and any surprise customer/partnership announcements will be icing on the cake at this point. Onward to another all-time high! Everything is not about money .... but it sure seems to help in most cases!"
It is guaranteed we see 27-28 as PLTR pass the pivot point.
"I AM IN AT 43.51 AND HOLDING! i aint got no #PAPER HANDS! only have Diamonds. I will YOLO, I will buy these STONKS To-The-Moon, only Paper Hands will buy Tendies. We will Come TO Get Her! #WSB, long TERM #PLTR I LOVE THIS STONKIM NOT LEAVING!"

"Vanguard buying, Cathie Wood buying, Motley Fool buying, Yoda buying today also. The Force is strong here. I can feel it."
"And you cry about ""buy another stock...IBM and AWS with such resources were not able to develop what PLTR did.Try to sell box of pencils to 3M, BP, Rio Tinto and others and then sell ERP software.Try to launch a business/establish relations with Japan-good luck.European countries and Israel in terms of data protection are much havier than US, and PLTR have a big footprint in those markets with gov and commercials for years now(prior DLP)PLTR aims for small and medium sized enterprise as well"
"I feel like amidst all this panic this really needs to be said: 1) This dip was to be expected following earnings and the lock up period expiring. 2) If your long-term and believe in the technology this company brings to the table with minimal competition in the field, just turn your phone off for the next week or average down your costs. 3) THE ENTIRE MARKET is down not just PLTR. A lot of this is due to investors dashing to GME and AMC for the pumps taking place right now. Keep this in mind too.With all being said, make your own decisions but to my fellow PLTR longs just grab a coffee and take it easy"
"No worries folks, PLTR is still trading above the pivotal point which means if we hit $28.60, we could close above near $30."
I see an earnings surprise. Make your opinion heard. First thumbs up.
"Six years partnership, huge! they are really saving the moneytalk until Q1."
Holding stillFrom 43.51!!!!
"Let's break this down nice and simple.'We incurred a loss from operations of $156.6 million, which includes $241.8 million in stock-based compensation'The loss was due to a once off payment of stock-based compensation, which is very common post IPO.If this once off payment was not paid, the net profits would have been $84 million, beating the EPS.Anyone who understands this and see's what the expected growth will be for Q1 (45%) will know that Palantir is in an extremely healthy and profitable position now.Learn to control your emotions and weak hands, Palantir will be enroute to $40 within a few days"
"P/E = 2,471 at current price assuming an unlikely net profit in 2021. Cathie's dart throwing chimp Bubble recommends Bye......"

95 by summer
ark going to make a nother 100 percent on. this easy.
I am a actually really pumped for the buying opportunities over the next few weeks. This company is awesome and will not continue to be in a bear market indefinitely.

Friday is Palantir Day.
"Hello guys i need your opinion please , I bought some shares @ 37$ last week im thinking to sell it next week if the price goes up and then buy again when it drops. What your thoughts please?"
This will trade at $100 before EOY. Mark it.
Government wants Robinhooders out of the market.
"Insider sales have slowed, getting ready for blast off!!"
so good news and pltr is frozen...
Cathie wood stock picking is hot as she. I love PLTR and I love Cathie too . Although am in PLTR before Cathie but when she is in I feel comfortable that someone really understand PLTR.

All this moaning and negativity on here! Almost seem to forget that this is up 175% since November! consolidation is healthy
"I’m learning. Does the 1 year chart show an inverse head and shoulders, meaning potential run up?"
"As of today, ARK owns 4,040,066 PLTR shares. That's 1 million more than last week!!"
So the ECB said they would buy more bonds (driving down rates) and the US 10Y plummeted and here we are up 5%.
Seems like the war between Hedge Fund Manager and Retail Traders is now out of box!
when will it go up?
"I was about to sell when it was $25 today...BUT, since I am GREEDY, I said WAIT....Dear Jesus: Don't disappoint me to today..."
This is like buying Tesla in 2015
Nice pop after hours. Tomorrow is looking good.
Might start to add under 23$ or 22$ market is plunging and 10year bond yield is shooting back up!
Very happy with this outcome.
"I play GME for the adrenaline rush, but holding PLTR for a 10+bagger down the road. Green Monday? We'll see!"
"Why are the insiders selling now, why don't they wait until Pltr hits $40 or $50 per share?"
"Bought at $33, sold at $45, bought back at $33, sold at $39, bought back at $32 bla bla bla. No one believes you  are timing the market, NO ONE. "

let's close the market green THUMBS-UP
PLTR has one of the smartest CEO.
"Cathy added 10m shares avg $23.78, do shorts think that they can get PLTR cheaper than this. They must be out of their minds !"
"It feels so good to be invested in a stock like this. Never have I been more sure of a stock, last Friday they released news of BP and today IBM? Back to back news, earnings during premarket, PLTR knows what they are doing. They care about us shareholders, stay long and strong. End of year target: $270. Position: 2k shares at $142k shares at $25"
Bunch of passive aggressive small ..... on this board :) Can't spot a trend reversal and consolidation of shares.
THIS WEEK WILL BE A HUGE REBOUNDING !!!
"If you go under LinkedIn you will under sales International positions opening up for their commercial modules, untapped virgin territory... Palantir is Microsoft in 1983...."
ARK bought 1.5 million shares yesterday. This will go back to 40 soon
100$ share Next year they have billlons and billions in the backlog
If it goes down by 30% in 4 days.. it surely can get back up in 4 days or less. Stay put and hold tightly onto your shares.
ARK spent $45million ￼ purchased ￼ PLTR shares yesterday. I believe ARK bullish on PLTR. I personally Bullish ￼ on PLTR as well￼
"shorts are celebrating ash Wednesday with their cent money. buying cheap fish while we gonna buy steak the next 364 days of the year also uh when you guys type the letter P into the search engine. uh. whats the first thing that pops up. because for me is ""pltr stock news"""
$1 down each day. LOL
"My fellow PLTR investors,1. We are ALL GREEDY, including myself2. We all want to make money3. This means you win some and you lose some4. Specifically, I have loaded my PLTR truck and put my loaded truck in my secure garage.5. I am waiting to start selling my PLTR cuties at a price of $30 minimum6. This basically means that I will make a good profit and somebody else will have to deal the PLTR cuties I sold them.7. The people who buy my PLTR cuties at $30 a piece, may sell them at a higher price or they may lose money and sell them at a loss.8. From an ethical point of view, should I feel bad if I sell my PLTR cuties at $30 and then the price drops to $25 again, and I come back in and re-buy my PLTR cuties at a cheaper price again in order to load my PLTR truck?9. In other words, I keep loading and unloading and this means other people are getting hurt.10. Why am I emotional today?Peace!"
Palantir will provide very good guidance after announcing their explosive earning. Expecting share jump to $50 range. There are only 2 trading days before the earning is announced so buy more while you can.
More contracts coming any day
Just broke that resistance. Going to go to the MOON now!  
"What does Karp say when he leaves the office? ""Another day, another dollar (down)."""
either drop below 20 so I can buy more or go up to 30 where you belong!
This would be $100 already if people didn’t run with a 4% profit. Up 300% and holding.
read what employees say...its not software its maybe more value but its labor intensive sql scripting..i am not sure why other companies couldnt do that
$100 per share ?
This is the next Tesla.
Let’s close at $26 today
Must be hard to invest in something that is always red
I love it. More panicking = opportunity. Thanks!!

Just for fun.....everybody add a small buy.
"Let's look at today's market. Most sectors down. What is up Consumer Staples, Utilities, Communication Services, Big Tech and Semiconductors. With the weird exception of Financials this looks like a day driven by the bond market and inflation. You should be prepared for daily volatility in stocks like PLTR. If you want some peace of mind during the near future, you may want to look at a more conservative investment strategy."
"This is for the Bulls that a thinking of selling Look at your company Eyes Open Google ""Palantir Gotham 21 Launch""Watch the demo video & Sleep Well"
Just about time to buy some more.

"Amazes me how many people in these chats want other people to lose money. One of the most insecure things a man or a lady can possess is to want others to fail. Everyone is on the same boat the pros and and the new comers everyone is down. Some of you need to see the millionaires accounts, i know someone who shown me there account last week and i cant imagine looking at it right now. Some of you need to grow up."
"PLTR under $25 is a fantastic opportunity. If more civilians understood Palantir's business model, products, and services, they would be buying and holding PLTR anything under this important consolidated levels of 25 range. I expect PLTR to return to 32+ by next week."
"My fellow PLTR investors,Can someone explain to me what is going on with the stock market?PLTR was $25. Then it jumps to almost $30. Then now it's back to the $27 rangeHelp.... any fundamentals or just buy and hope for the best?Peace!"
"All pltr Investors should write elon musk and reddite on twitter, please let us make our silent all my school money is about to go"
Lmao where’d Ramses go when it turned green :p
$50 easy next week
I dream of that it will open with price $180
I am not a day trader. I bought this last week at $38. I don't care too much for the price drop because I know it is temporary. Go ahead shorts and hate this post :)
"Goldman Sachs upgraded PLTR to ""buy"" from ""neutral"", raisinf the price target from $13 to $34!!! The sky is the limit!!!"
45$ before may
Why is this still not moving up?
if this goes below $20 im throwing my life savings in it so it can double within a year.
Way over sold will go back to 32 soon
"It's time to sell, before this stock falling. I guessing next month this stock should be around $20...or worse."
Pure manipulation of the hedge funds they were aiming to hit 20 in outs and now I see they are heading to 26 where the calls are set with today’s expiration these are the same who brought it down now they are taking it up
news should be coming tomorrow
Palantir software should control the US Stock Exchange for the betterness of the citizen
I sold due to weakness in tech
to the moon! let's break 45 this month
rkt going to 120
"If you saw the interview with PLTR yesterday, the CEO did not criticize retail investors. In fact, he praised them. He said he admires that they are using their own money to build some wealth for themselves, admiring their initiatives. He just said that we have a long term focus at our company and if people want quicker returns there are other stocks on which people can focus. The irony is is that we could have short term gains with pltr if only people went long and stayed there for a little while."
"Ooooh the stock isn't going up as quick as GME...Cry me a river. You were never going to get short term gains from this, If a 6% increase isn't good enough for you, you shouldn't be investing"
YAY got me some pltr!
Last chance to onboard $SHIP. tomorrow will fly up!. Don't miss out!
25 was the bottom...people who missed the bottom are bashing so hard right now
Today +27$
Bought some $PLTR for the first time at $25. Let's see how this goes.
"The upcoming massacre of PLTR shorts is not a question of ""if"", it's only a question of ""when"". Before the middle of April, no doubt."

Imagine selling yesterday. 
Slow and steadily boys! 
History bites: SEC had a contract with PLTR back in 2011
volume way up
If $PLTR stays above $22.70 it should move up to the mid 30's before drastically retracing.
up or down still chilling long term play
Look up the new short data! It’s heading to 22!LOL
"PLTR is amazing. With IBM and BP contracts in and more to go, potential is huge. Shorts keep bringing this down with the hope that we sell with panic. Stay strong"
"Another article just came out by Barron's, these insiders keep selling, unbelievable."
Cathy Wood sends out an email everyday with all the shares she’s buying and selling. I won’t be shocked if I see another 1.5 million bought.
$33 tomorrow enjoy everyone
enough said ! $40 pps
"15,000 shares here LONG PLTR LET'S GO!!! "
I’m a time traveler sent from the future. My objective is to get rich fast !!
Anyone else feel like you understand this company and the potential deeper than many around you? It's frustrating to no end when I hear friends suggesting to buy companies like Boeing because they find comfort in a household name. More specifically they lack vision or belief that something that was previously thought IMPOSSIBLE is now possible in a matter of weeks/days/minutes through Foundry & Gotham...Thankfully my vision aligns with Karps on US dominance and empowering people. My vision aligns with Thiels on go to market strategies and monopolies. My vision aligns with Cathie Woods on an eye towards the future which might provide small near term gains but mountains of gold for those patient enough to let the new world orders take place...Long since $10. Averaged up to $20. Waiting on an old company IRA rollover of 80k to purchase however many more I can get. Set it and forget it.
"Few good AI stocks. Microsoft, Datametrex AI, Palantir, Baker Hughes and Fortinethttps://www.baystreet.ca/stockstowatch/9558/Heres-Why-Investors-Should-Pay-Close-Attention-to-Artificial-Intelligence"
I don't care 1 smidg how low PLTR goes. I will buy more and more. Long diamond hands.
Market never makes mistakes . I own PLTR . Volume speaks
bought 460 @27.06
A few days ago but reassuring!!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-XQwaJJMNI
"Put it away and dont look at it for 6 months. Maybe dead money, but any huge contract or two, or three can make this jump 20% in a heartbeat"
One of the easiest setups buying at $25 yesterday.
"This is a 100 year hold for me. Might freeze myself down for 60 years to reap the benefits of this lovely stock. Might buy a spaceship once I sell or maybe invest in a Benjamin Button thing where I age backwards.. can probably afford both. All in all, I'm very bullish on this stock."
come back here in 2 months and check the price again if it is not over 45 $ i will give up investing in stocks. mark my word. regards
"PLTR is not an ATM machine, and Alex Karp didn’t say anything wrong. We r here for long haul, people and business may not see the importance of big data analytics, but they will in the future."
"Meanwhile Karp, Thiel, Cohen, and Sankar fiddle while Palantir burns."
got in at 21.91 boooom
Stock is holding up very well today less volatility I’m loving it
I was looking for $24.90 today. Looks like $24.50 though.
Remember when the price used to go up? Those were good times
Cathie was right about PlTR 
I’m all bullish. Cathie Wood is bullish too and oh! She bought millions of shares and she will obviously buy more and more.
ppl think that insiders selling their shares is bringing the stock down? it's obvious SHORTS running out of excuses. The market just had its worst week in months.. Gimme a break. this stock is 230% up since DPO and in a growing TAM and No competition. Go find another stock to bash. Please go play with the children at GME. Leave the adults aloe
"Took a look at open positions with Palantir. A lot of new roles looking for sales staff worldwide: Tokyo, London, Rome....they are gearing up and investing now for future growth. If you don't need the money now, let this investment ride for 2-3 years. Compounding rate of returns will be great. If you're looking to day trade, more opportunities else where that can be worth your time"
"In 2020, the Faurecia Group posted sales of #$%$14.7 billion and Palantir might save 10%, as it did to one oil company, how much would Palantir get for such work? $100 - 200 mils a year? In total that's already more than 20% increase of revenue a year of Palantir. Just my rough estim. Wacha think?"
"Downtrend broken, patience paid off and obviously the silence muting the annoying noise of bashers made that a whole lot more enjoyable ! Good job to those who held!! Follow the money"
$pltr will be in 28-30 for sure with the JNJ approval & stimulus news. Note that $pltr is been down for last 8 to 11 sessions. Shorts are going fried.
This is just the recovery! We’ll surge even bigger next week!
Just hold and buy more if its dip. Hold and soon it will go on positive. It happened so many times to me when I panic sell until I learn that we shld nvr panic sell as it only benefits those shorts.
Cathy woods just bought..omg..tjisbis gonna rocket tomorrow
3138 shares fellas!! Tomorrow we will go to the moon!! I like the stock
"every market was going up.. on pre market ... and now almost every are fallin... take a look. (well but you should looked 2 hours before to compare as me, lol). it could be the next jerome Powell interview on the day... or the last consumer reports (it says the consumers arent in the best levels)"
"I’m down about three grand in this. However… Every time I think about selling, I look at the bullish options activity and I don’t."
25 today. Who knows where it ends up Friday.
Should I add another 100?
"You're going to wish you bought Palantir 10 years from now. They're literally building the next-gen online ecosystem for businesses, and eventually for the average person. This is the company that takes us beyond the standard operating systems we have now."
Do you think that it'll work to turn off the stock market off and on again to make it go up?$nio $tsla $aapl $amzn $pltr $arkk
Cramer said he's not a buyer of Palantir. That means you should buy and it's a good investment.
At least this company isn’t some old rust bucket company.... like Sears.
Cathie Wood: The recent sell off in tech was a broadening of the bull market just like in 2016/17 and is good news for the bull market moving forward.Josh Brown (one of my favorite traders on Fast Money): Cathie Wood is exactly right.
"My prediction for PLTR earning tomorrow: eps 0.07 beat the est. 0.05Explosive guidance, open up $9 per share and close at day high $44... GLTAL"

price target within the next 3 months? any thoughts
"If you are posting about how bad PLTR will do today at 6am, you clearly don’t know that premarket doesn’t matter. For those of us that have been here a long time, there have been plenty of days where this goes green after being deep in the red premarket."
Omg I bought 5k yay earnings next week after it’ll skyrocket
this stock has some serious issues... whats the possibility for a squeeze.. im sure this stock has some shorts
Who else ain't sleeping tonight

This will go parabolic like Tesla...Peter and Elon set up PayPal 20 yes ago...this is it!!!!
Next week 30+ in no time I’m so happy to buy soooooo cheap
"Our price action is slightly delayed of Snowflake. The mutual market caps were both in the 40 Billion range (41.5 to their 46.5 at the bottom) That says a lot about our company, 3X better and a 12% market discount to Snow. Warren Buffet should buy Palantir."
PLTR and GME kept strong today
"Krap Yap, stock redKrap no Yap, stock greenNo Yap from Krap!"
I bought the dip. And if it dips further I will buy some more. Long and Strong. I liked it well before Ark liked it. I like it even more now.

Let’s go!!!!
"AWS - If you don’t understand the impact of this agreement. You don’t realize how this opens up an entirely new addressable market that was not even included in the investor day presentation.Palantir made a shift from having companies need to buy Gotham or Foundry in full. To deciding to offer Foundry up in modular form. Meaning they give organizations who didn’t have the budget, approval or foresight to its full capabilities org wide. The option to bite off components of Foundry and in smaller deployments.That modularity was a genius move as many medium/large business may not be able to justify massive enterprise wide deployment. However, by letting these companies dabble with aspects of Foundry they know it will lead to more wide spread adoption across other functions of those business and allow organic growth of Foundry within those accounts.Now bring in AWS partnership and you have your Trojan horse into those many medium/large businesses that were not a part of your TAM as the TAM was entirely Enterprise customer focused. Which is where the small PLTR sales team and IBM reps will pitch PLTR.AWS accessibility of Palantir for customers is a big deal. Don’t listen to a word the village idiot Ramses says to make you think otherwise."
"Same for pltr . Buy and keep . 6 mths down the road , see who is laughing :)"
PLTR customer base has only one direction: exploded up.PLTR SP has only 1 direction: go up.Keep buying if you can.
No stock can withstand to this magnitude of selling in the market.
"Someone bought $PLTR Size: 652293 Price: 24.26 Time: 16:01 Amount: $15,824,628.18"
Float is too big. Brace for 1 for 10 reverse split.
The American Rescue Plan has been passed.Merrick Garland has been confirmed.Palantir is up.Today is a good day.
I'm long on PLTR but if Alex Karp shows up again bashing like what he tried to do I'm out. The guy might be on top of the world atm but not everybody has a billionaire for a college buddy. His generalizations of the valley mentality are very articulate but mostly bigotry as well as extremely shortsighted for a company looking to expand in the private sector. Ms. Karp chillout and buy a ssl cert for your previous venture.
This is not the time to be long the market guys
"Guys, whatever happens this will be 100 dollars at the end of the year!!"

"I can give you a 100% guarantee that the PLTR price will be either up, down or the same tomorrow! and I stand by it 100%!"
Mind blowing interview
Anyone still holding from 43?
PLTR has 1.5 billion shares outstanding and the media harps about a meager 2.7 million shares sold by some insiders. What a flipping joke for content. There are various company insiders all over the freaking place buying/selling stocks. It happens everyday somewhere in the Russel 2000 index & S&P 500.
So close to pushing past $24.
why is pltr acting like pltr :'(
"I don’t know which is sweeter, a 6% gain or knowing the shorts are realizing they picked the wrong battle to fight. Cover and get out is the best advice I can give them. If shorts can’t see the writing on the wall, than they deserve every penny they lose. You’ve all been warned."
Holding up at 30$ for everyone
Buckle up boys and girls.
"Just so we are clear on how things work. ""Shorters"" are professional traders with access to real capital and armies of quant's. They may have a script that scrapes keywords from this board to make a retail sentiment indicator for a dashboard. You can yell at them all you want on here if it makes you feel better."
Shorts caught in a vice- backs getting broken.
"Where is CovertAction? Oh, where is that wit and fount of all wisdom regarding investing....? How we miss that razorlike sarcasm that was always wrong....ah, good times."

Worth the wait
"They dragged the Nasdaq to the 100 Day MA, they got their buying dip. DOW and S&P are just coasting."
PLTR is a future
Is this a squeeze? I do reckon it is.
The he company doesn’t have bad news. So don’t panic guys. It will be up in a few days or weeks. Don’t sell now and regret later. My opinion..
once market settles this is going to 40ties glad to be here now
Is PLTR a good buy at this price or wait for a dip?
"Little volatility today, I'm happy with that. Long term folks"
"Great seeing 2% increase AH. What drove that, btw?"
No one see the future But we know alteady having big contract with bigest army in the world is not easy . Just wait Ofcource it will fly next few days

to the moon indeed. let the AWS news sink in for a bit then institutions will realize soon enough what just happened!
Oh why didn’t I buy it when it was $24? Because you lack conviction and guts. Because you don’t understand the business and can’t assess its value. More than anything you don’t have the right stomach for investing. Your mind is less important and is what leads you astray.
AMZ WSB partnership with PLTR !
"When Everyone wants to buy the dip, there will be no dip but big green tmr!"
Let make it st. Patrick
oh wow nice little burst there
Cramer is poking at Cathie Wood and Palantir. What a montebank.
Nothing positive these days
"I have a feeling that PLTR might go to the 20's.For some reason, it doesn't matter if there is good news such as:....a. The passing of the stimulus package....b. Cathie Wood buying millions of shares....c. Amazon signing contracts with PLTR....d. IBM signing contracts with PLTR....e. Etc...So, it seems that we are going to just let PLTR work its way down to $18, $19, $20, $21, and $22...The hope here is that 6 to 12 months from now, the PLTR stock allocations will stabilize and then we start going to the $30's again...Oooh! Well LET IT BE..."
Avg SaaS company trades around 10x revenues. I’ll PLTR again below 20x revenues. Not at 38x lol.

"I believe this dip is Options expiration; No other reason why it should go down 10_12%. Nasdaq in correction mode, still 1000 points + to go down"
"I would encourage all to take the time to read the recent ""Earnings Call Transcript"". It is often difficult to take in all that is said during a live ""Earnings"" call, but in the quiet of your own time, you can spend the time digesting and understanding what was communicated. Not only have I taken the time to read the transcript, but I have also complete follow-up research on key points I want to understand better. For example, there is so much chatter about the US government being a single point of failure because so much of Palantir's business is with them. For this reason, they must diversify their customer base to grow and thrive. Although this would most certainly be beneficial, it belays the fact that the US government alone spends 4.4Trillion per year - 12% for Defense, 23% for Healthcare, and 25% other (as an example). Palantir only did 610Million in business with the US government (in 2020) because in the prior models they focused on the IT sector within the government. However, with the investments in the end-to-end workflows (Apollo and Foundry), they can now focus on nearly 250Billion worth of business with the US government. The deal with IBM was made possible because the investments made to improve the cradle to grave process (or as they say mud to space) delivered 84% gross margin - do you know what that means? They can now bring on channel partners because there is enough compensation there for everyone to be paid accordingly. Furthermore, this means that they can now extend this offering to other channel partners. Another note-worthy nugget was the fact that they already have 2.8B in the sales pipeline with an average contract duration of 3.8years. Do you understand what that means - customer stickiness! And the final point I will draw attention to was their projection for sales of 30% compounded annually for the next 5years (2025). A question was asked by one of the shareholders - can Palantir sustain such growth? Shyam’s response was thorough and he ended with this line....""And these are examples of why we're confident in our long-term growth of being greater than 4 billion in 2025"". For these and many more reasons I will be a long-term holder of this stock."
Buy as soon as market opens or hold?
Take a look on 6 months graph. Palantir 264% growth. I don’t know why you guys are panicking? Give this stock sometime it will grow more.
P.S. I love to see the billionaires crying on TV because they lost billions shorting GameStop. I hope the same happens here.
Up 4%
They announced new deal with 3M this morning...
Good to see the Premarket green! Hope we end this week with $30+
"Alex Karp kindly asked for any short term investors who didn't see the potential to simply leave.Say goodbye and say helloSure it's good to see you and it's time to goDon't say ""Yes"", but please don't say ""No""I don't want to be lonely tonight"
Post earnings is $60............
Close above $28.28 would be super bullish. Retest of $30 today expected.
"The Stimulus Bill opened the door for PLTR to access the following budgets...-$47.8 billion to detect, diagnose, trace, and monitor COVID-19 infections, while requiring HHS to implement a national strategy for testing, contact tracing, surveillance and mitigation of COVID-19-$8.5 billion for vaccine activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including $7.5 billion to prepare, promote, administer, monitor and track vaccines and $1 billion to improve vaccination rates;-$750 million for CDC global health activities efforts, including global health security, global disease detection and response, global health protection, global immunization, and global coordination on public health;-$500 million for CDC data modernization and forecasting;"
This will rocket on Monday.
"Literally the worst stock you can buy today. In an insanely overvalued market, PLTR looks expensive, really, really expensive. With the average contract under $100,000 per client and less than one billion in annual sales, how on earth can anyone justify a $50 BILLION market cap? They can't. This is a MIME reddit stock that will be trading in the single digits next year. Get out or better yet, don't buy into this fraud company."
Who else thinks it’s gonna close above $30 today?
Cathie price target is $ 75 I like it
See yaa $45 soon !!!
Anytime the fed even mumbles about opening its mouth the market always falls...
"If Snowflake is still worth 50 Billion today, we are worth 60 Billion. Load up Institutions so you have skin in the game and pivot to bullish.Well, Roblox Fake DPO'd with the Wallstreet crooks managing it and closed up with a 38 Billion market cap. What a joke, it was valued by them at 4 Billion last year... The abuse our company's share price and strong fundamentals take at the hands of these crooks is totally laughable."
"Like I said, green"
Discount buy is about to expire
ARK now has over 4M shares... last week was 2.3M...
"Lot of folks taking a bath here. It's tempting as hell to sell when everyone is trashing the ""valuation"". Notice how no one trashes the products, business model or management team. No company is esoteric for sure, but that will pass, but it's passing like a kidney stone. Don't watch and don't give your shares away."
"Might as well lay it out here, 2025 PT $350"
30 more minutes before this hits 40
PAMAZON
John...It's OK...Let it go...Release PLTR and let it fly...It's OK...There is nothing wrong with letting PLTR flying high...We are all praying for you...
Yay! My another 34k shares order executed @23.81...holding long with 856k shares
Why is everyone panicking we knew this time would be volatile and we know it could be back to 28 in a day
Open above $27 tomorrow?
5200 PLTR added
Right now all shorters watch spy and qqq and with their fingers on the button. Surely for us as well as for many other stocks. Scary moment.
"If some on this board make decisions based on the posts here, you should be investing, the market needed a correction but in Q2/3 this will be flying"
"Open admission. Got in here at $10. Have bought on FOMO and dips from as high as $38 to as recent as $23.My position has grown 3x since initial entry and my cost average has increased 2x going from $10 to about $20. Rough times watching account drop over 150k since the ATH of $45. AbsolutelyPlay the coulda/woulda/shoulda game all the time. As I did not sell a single share and I’m left holding it all. That said, end game was NEVER $45 per share. I’m looking for 8-10x that share price and I’m rather confident with patience I’ll get it.Can’t wait for these shares to settle with all the institutions who were able to shake out the ill informed returned investors. Was hoping we could all get rich together but I guess that’s reserved for those of us who actually poured hours into their due diligence.No better tech company in town. That will be a fact to the world in very short time."
"Lol bears are so funny, whole of tech is down and they think their best position is still a good idea. Trust me on this, I know what you don’t, PLTR is going to punish anyone shorting below $30 by the middle of April."
I do hope that we get a real good pop in the morning.
whose gonna buy this dip
Trillion dollar market cap. Here we come. To the moon.
"The trains has left the station bye bye, $23 hello $50.."
"@nvstsyle I appreciate your contribution because it helps affirm my decision to buy more at the support level. I am sitting mainly on cash and 4350 shares I bought all the way up to 36. As a senior, going all in one stock can sometimes give pause, but I don’t feel fear investing in this company. It is like MSFT I had in the 80’s. Some folks on this board give me insight that my ex-brokerage firm Never took time to provide. I left them in 2007. I trust myself. I have done a crate load of due diligence, and I am not concerned. Moreover, certain posters have supplemented my learning curve; I am grateful to them. To all of y’all who help me, many many thanks. I feel lucky with you and Palantir."
I bought 25 call selling at 26$
Cathie becomes majority shareholder soon
The entire market is down today and people are acting like it is PLTR's fault... LMAO
Someone is keeping it under $30 because there is a lot of calls expiring today at that price!! $30 triggers a jump to $40s !!
Looks like we may be going up from here. I am in 100 shares at 28.71
"Let's see:People are still saying the usual buzzwords (claiming this will make PLTR go up):1. ARK Invest = Cathie Wood = Buys more PLTR2. Keep the hope alive = Long term (5 years from now?) PLTR will go ""To The Moon""3. Palantir employees are done selling their shares4. IBM and PLTR signed contracts5. Amazon and PLTR signed contracts6. Biden is going to sign the Stimulus BillWell, I have to add one more:...a. I ate breakfast this morning (TWO French croissants and a delicious HOT Starbuck coffee)...b. I drank a whole bottle of water...c. I went to the bathroom...d. So, I expect PLTR to go up today!!!Fair enough?"
Slow and steady. We like it that way 
a 300$ stock in the next 2-3 years.remember when AMD was $15 ?
"Big week , with the CEO talking on CNBC @ 10 on Tues. Wait a see ."
Gonna give back yesterday’s gain.....and more.
Let's get this boy to $30 today
Insiders taking small profits ppl are panicking....
"I guess buying 2 million shares by Cathie can move a stock, see you at $ 30 next Friday"
thisnaction is songood..i just rolled all my option over for 3 minths
"Funny thing is, its President Steve Cohen, helped tank his own company!"
"Karp, do you know what he did? Stockvadar-asks.He ""karped"" on all of you.-sv"
Strong Short squeeze on its way and very well supported by CNBC this time!
Will $24 be the low for 2021?
The only stock I know that is down when the market is up and the news is good and up on no news and the market is down.
let's take this to the moon
"Did anyone ask Krap, why he never made a profit since 2003 despite giving management generous free stock option programs?"
The march to $15-20 resumes. Lube up longs.
"I think PLtR can hit $50-$60 in no time. But just a thought though, if Reddit could bring a troubling company like GME to its high, they can certainly buy up to $200 in no time. The difference is if the Reddit decided to push this up, then they are smarter this time around because this is a great company. Just my 2 cents!"
"PLTR may go up this week, next week, or in a couple weeks. It will be going up, it's an investment."
Allegrophobia!
"Bought 500 @ $25 - Unlike Nickola, Palantir has a product and is actually growing the business. The Q4 loss is not really a loss, it was a write down due to stock based compensation."
"Regardless of earnings, this company is solid and if you have done your own research you would understand why. If you’re scared then take your money and move it else where."
"When it breaks 23, look out below"
Keep shorting as much as you can. Short interest is at 18% pretty high.Get ready for a big squeeze when a big contract is annouced
Time to buy the dip?
Buh bye.

What Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Mystery Stock? Big Investment by Warren Buffett Could Be Disclosed Tomorrow.It's going to be PALANTIR. To the moon.
Looks like we are officially the market leader now. No Wallstreet bs will hold now.
"250 shares, can’t wait to see who’ll still be here in 5 years"
"If there is a major downturn, the government connections will keep this afloat."
$ai $pltr all pulling back after the initial morning pop. fully expect $cpng to do the same.
"Before next earnings report and demo scheduled for April under $30/share is a great price....However if you are planning to invest for a long term, current evaluation is just a little fraction comparing to the value of this company....Some people are claiming that companies such as Databricks and Snowflake are competitors....That is not true.. Products are complements of each other...."
who wanna bet this goes to 15? maybe 11 dollars?
Algo owners what to print those options today!
"This guy has big Kohonas, its going to be a wild ride but in the end we will WIN BIG!!!!!"
I am waiting for $18/share to buy. sold yesterday
I love Palantir for 1 simple reason. THEY HAVE NO COMPETITION!!! Nobody even close! Long 22000 shares
I see some shorts are nervous this evening
"Believe Rdy and Bull are the smartest guys in the room.now, w/ even a small announcement from Palantir on biz capture, it’s going up significantly."
We finally broke the wall of 26. Only good days to come
Gotta ask all the bashers - Who’s the daddy now!!! 
Who has an average above 40$?
The stock always go the opposite direction of what most people think lol 
"Chill out, nothing big is going to happen today..."
"Guys, If you feel that you are getting rich by buying and selling in the same week/month, you are doing it wrong.You should hold for at least one year, I know you will say, one yeaaaar???? Yea, one year."
I'm starting to think I made a mistake investing several thousands into this.
Last chance to hop in for sure
I will buy more today for sure
"Look at the call options for Friday, someone expecting a BIG MOVE UP in my opinion, not financial advice cause I eat crayons"
Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Buys Over 2.6 Million Palantir Shareshttps://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/03/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-over-2-6-million-palantir-shares/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+247wallst_partners+%2824%2F7+Wall+St.+-+Syndication+Partners%29&mod=mw_quote_news
Futures just turned green lets see a 20% plus day tomorrow. I loaded on SKLZ also today. It dropped almost 20% in the last days.
"Buy the more shares, the federal reserve will bump it again, again, again"
Take profits when you can. Can make a lot of money with this volatility.
"Ok, time to go up now PLTR. Please?"
"It will take a few more days to break out of its current pattern. It's more of a bullish pattern but it's still has small chance of breaking down. This stock took 5 month to reach 39-45. Even if it break down, it still can get back to 40 in no time. This company has great potential and foundation. Long investor shouldn't worry at all. Short investors just are trying to make profit in short term. Once they make profit, they will have to buy back and will push it up again."
oh man 29 in play as people see how oversold this was
"Today finally we will break the strong resistance 26$, with strong volume we go straight to 30$.Let’s the party begin bulls!!"
AMAZON AND PALANTIR LETS GOOOO
just bought 1000 shares @23.75.... to the moon!!!!
"It is funny, Jim Cramer advised Cathie to close her ETF instead of taking money and investing when she bought millions of PLTR. Cathie reply - ETFs can not be closed like MFs. (Hmm. Jim doesn't know but advises her). She also said they double down on stocks when they think their high conviction stocks are cheap. Jim and entourage think - this is a day of value stocks and stupid of her to invest in high growth stocks. Too narrow thinking. She is positioning her ETFs to lift off next ride."
Picked up more March $28 calls for $0.66 each
"Some point today I'm adding , maybe down this week but this company is going to expand and the money will come back .."
Yeah this a long term hold. As in it will take 20 years for it to reach $30 again
"it's a slow climb, bit it's a climb and not a decline. Have faith in PLTR. Honestly believe with money coming to peoples accounts and states opening up that next week will explode for PLTR. "
"Apple looking attractive again, algo's are running their course... Cathie talked about being caught flat footed by Wallstreet algorithms. She underscored the importance of AI and grabbing lion-share of the TAM early and forgo short-term profits. Which is slated in the Trillions. She basically repeated Alex Karp's words to investors at Earnings."
Someone is really trying to keep this under $29 I hope they fail.
"Fantastic opportunity to invest on your future.Buying more, may not get another chance to do so."
Hold and be rewarded later in the year....
"How’s that Amazon news working out for you longs, huh?"
18 by next Friday market will crash stimulus didn’t work sleepy jo is sleeping on his basement
BE GREEDY WHEN OTHERS ARE SCARED!
"classic but today i sold pltr, tomorow 25% up Whatever enjoy it guys not my month"
@anna your comment just made my day
Hoping to break $30 soon.
"I wonder if the DNC will use Palantir Foundry to help integrate disparate voter fraud sources and make the best possible use of their criminal media accomplices? The DNC could use Palantir's Foundry software to gain further insight into its forged ballot harvesting across the country, from manufacturing to transporting across state lines, from voter machine rigging to dead voter generation."
Looks like Palantir is the light on the shore for a sinking boat..
$30 by Friday in the bank
A three month run to glory........$175?
This is going to rocket into the 40s next week
Buying a likely dip this week.
Get a free stock when you join webull. I just got a share of tesla for joining. https://act.webull.com/k/CX3WA9e15h4s/main
Holding steady.
Waiting it to up 10% at Pre market
"I’m new to this convo so forgive me if its already been mentioned but I haven’t seen it so I’ll mention it now. Palantir is contracted by the LAPD, the 3rd largest police force in the nation at 10k officers. Thats what convinced me to buy. I’m in at 2400 shares @ $13ish! GO GO GO!!!"
Big investors example Ark are loading up recently. Don't you trust their judgement? This stock is a gem
Sold my Fisker and bought more PLTR today
Probably the the janitor at Palantir selling some of his shares
This will dip until 11am and then finish 12% up by EOD
"P/E = 2440 at share price 24.4 $, assuming the unlikely - they make net profit. A real bubble. Twice as overrated as TSLA."
This stock is not good for my blood pressure.Added more today and not going to look at this stock for the next month.
Bought 100 more at $29 today
Timing the market is mainly just luck. It's so easy to say buy low sell high. Just buy and hold if you trust the company. Fundamentals did not change these past red days!
"Cathie Woods purchased double the shares she had since last month. 4 Million shares as of now. Now rank 32. Palantir passed Salesforce, This holding will be positioned in the top 15."
Wow where have all the bears gone
We’ll see a relief rally tmr! PLTR is going to surge back Bigger than ％！
It’s the year 2022 and Palantir is 150$ a share
"CEO is rightFor example Google and Facebook will take your data, monetize it, and restrict your freedoms on their platforms. They also trash the country that allows them to do this and they won’t support the government that gives them their safety. They need to be taxed to hell because there is no free lunch."
"Bloody, tomorrow is the first day of Palantired IBM cloud. lets go up!"
"ARKW sold 149,850 shares and ARKK bought 481,772 shares today.So a net purchase of 331,922 shares."
"So many bears crying, can’t stand seeing pltr move sideways in this market. "
"Just Curious. If PLTR doubled in a week, you would normally anticipate a slight sell off/consolidation afterwards. SO.......What would most of you do with your shares? Hold long and strong ? Sell a few to skim a profit but hold a core amount? Sell all of them and move on? I am not trying to BE IN ANYONE'S BUSINESS here. I am just curious what other retail investors think."
Karp is the person I want running my company true to his conviction!!
"See all marker Tesla , apple amazon all are redSome things is wrong with market So just wait Wait there is nothing to do more"
"Right here. Slightly green, so going to be a great day. Especially since the Nasdaq is going to sink. Poor longs."
"I'm actually laughing so hard at these bashers. First off, no real investor has ever posted a GIF to get a point across and secondly Palantir is doing something right if there are this many haters. So honestly down vote this post, bash it, talk trash - because it justifies my point :)"
"PLTR is not a scam lol, and I'm holding just a couple hundred shares long. But, seems Cohen and the other insiders are doing quite a lot of selling & Trading in the millions which is sure messing with our share price. I haven't been thru many lockup's on my other investments so my question is this, is just a normal thing around lockup period, I mean we did know some would happen. I did look at other charts and saw that it does often take a few weeks sometime to recover, but they usually do. I'm in it for the long haul, but if they continue to do this all year I'll be trimming for sure. Thankfully I got in very early. What are others thoughts that have been thru lockup periods before and have factual info that this is normal?"
What a good day for pltr haha all considering 
anyone standing in front of this train is really wrong...I'm helping you out here win win don't sell this
Anything under 30$-35$ won’t last long. This is a 100$ stock minimum!!!!! That’s why Aunti Cathie loaded up last week almost 300 million dollars!!!!! Follow Ark!!!
Amazon gets exclusive NFL Thursday night games.... tech stox going up from here bc that makes as much sense as anything in this market
Will fly tomorrow
Tom nash
Alex Karp is a great American!
How much $$$ will you lose today?
"to be honest, quite surprise that it is holding quite well if u go compare to those even big tech stock. overreaction on the unemployment."
comment below to place your hypothetical bet on pltr stock price tomorrow!!! buy in is 10k to bet. minimum 500$ bet
"Dumac fund filled today : 2,828,000"
Karp's confidence during the CNBC interview makes me think we will have some 'big' deal surprises that will be announced over the next few months.
It's clear that the entire movement in the stock has been due to the treasury yields spiking due to inflation expectations rising due to the stimulus package. What's to stop the 10 year treasury from hitting 2% after the stimulus package is passed?
Will rip hard monday! Cathie wood baby! Loaded up 3.3millions worth 70million dollars and you tell me 18 million dollars sold by insiders! It’s nothing! Follow Cathie!
@tom
"No reason to sell right now, today was a slight pullback after a great Friday. Lockup is over. It’s onlyup from here, just be patient"

OMG ARK INVESTMENT BUY BUY BUY. i I Love Catty Wood
"Karp is a visionary along the lines of Bezos, Musk, Gates, and Jobs. It won't be long before he joins their ranks."
Since they announced partnership it’s going over $30 bucks today
"You think YOUR stock is down? Think about the poor insiders. After all these years with the company, they saw their almost-unlocked shares at $45. Finally, after salivating over the $45 price a few months ago and still not able to sell, the long-awaited unlock date arrives and they have to sell at low to mid $20s."
i get the feeling this will rallly regRdless of mRket its yptrend now
My Palantir hat and shirt just arrived!! Perfect timing for a BIG day tomorrow! I’ll be wearing it all day.

I missed having a new high for PLTR...
"Hello, any buyers out there?"
Bought more at $25.00....I suggest you do the same. Good luck.
consolidating?
"sign of bottom: low volume, lots of bearish posts"
Still undervalue buy buy..!
When is the SEC going to act and do their job with Hedge Funds criminal activity?
Earnings are gonna be great
Hopefully the PM price will transition into a gradual 10% rise today!
Dont come on here and act like being down is specific to palantir. The whole market is down right now!
Breaks 25 and this will play in the teens
"Are we done with PLTR executives sell off? It seems they sold 5M shares, and all bought by Ark."
now that my friend is what i call great news
Me looking for the first dip like...
"PLTR will be in the hundreds in the future. It's for long term investment, which is years. Don't pay attention to the short term fluctuation in the market. If you are still worried, look up ARKK and ARKW holdings. They hold more than 16 million shares PLTR. Buy and hold the fear is a way to invest in this market."
By Thursday we’ll be around 35-38...
PLTR gaining momentum. Tomorrow it should be close to $30
Yahoo has entered into a short term contract with PLTR to clean up it’s message boards
where is cathie wood speaking?
Hurry up FOMO's while quantities under $30 last! IMO
Never been a PLTR shareholder. A stock with 1 billion floatable shares takes alot of institutions to move the share price. Its gonna be awhile before it hits 50...
2800 shares and getting more. LETS GO!!!!
Look at Fintel. All institutions buying and doubling down! Going to run on us! Follow the money!!
They want the $25's to expire worthless....
oh wow. look at this rally. lol. but why?
Ark bought 50 million shares. There’s no shares to buy anymore.
"Yep, I am buying from the fearful."
$31 tomorrow !!!
I loaded up at $22 ! Feeling good about PLTR's future !
Good day Palentarians
"So, here is my situation:Since I loaded the boat, I missed THREE OPPORTUNITIES to sell and make a ""good small profit""If I did sell, in each of these THREE OPPORTUNITIES, I would have made a few 1000 dollars in profit...and I can buy back at a lower entry point at $21 or $22THE POINT: Is holding LONG term a bad idea?"
Paper hands
thumb up if ur buying
"Why is everyone so worried about market going down just let it crash and get it over with, it always comes back,always has always will"
Heck with all the short interest we could run to 40 today!!
"As living in Europe, is Karp's interview on Cnbc after closing bell ?"
"The CEO and Elon are the most down to earth dudes, Karp and Musk have very similar insights to silicon valley bs. I love it."
Cathie Wood just bought 5M shares!!!!
"I will sell half my position when it reaches 65. Then, I will wait until it reaches 50s and all in! "
my price target for this is 200 by dec 21
day traders must hate this stock 
"ARK bought 130K today, total today: 16,027,007, which reminds me about James Bond. LOL"
This is the last week of this sell off none sense. I would load up big time here....last time you’ll see 20s
Y2014: PLTR signs 1.2 BUSD contract with BP for 10 years. Y2021 BP deepens ties with PLTRY2021 PLTR tie-up with IBM is its largest.Y2021 PLTR team up with AWSEndless list...
This is getting ready to fly when market opens
"I love PLTR and is my biggest holding at more than 30%, but come on ,stay real. F...king Noob investors want the stock to jump 10% a day, 100% in 2 months, 500% in EOY. Dont ""GAMBLE"" your emergency $$, max out your margin, steal from your mother in law. Ya'll watching too much youtube stock Mogue's video. They are making more $$ from YT than from the market. Invest the $$ you won't need it in 5 years minimum. Talk is easy, if the stock plunges 50%, let's see you kids gonna have to balls to . If you really trust this stock, buy more when you get paid no matter it's sunny or rainy. In the end, market is from impatient to the patient. "
"Oh what a gift to insiders and institutions, they will start unloading at the open."
"So many overreactions from “longs” and trolls during every green or red day .It’s always either:1.PLTR is going to the moon by next weekOr2.PLTR is trash and is a bag holder’s worst nightmare.The reality: a little red day/week/month or Green Day/week/month is irrelevant in 2-5 years of growth.- PLTR is not a 10 bagger overnight (at least by the odds), it’s a 10+ bagger over the next 2-5 years.Check the comments, been consistently preaching this since DPO and I’ve done very well with it since buying at $9.45.This company cannot be evaluated based upon the traditional “fundamentals” like current profits etc. It is something unique and quite frankly, has tons of room for growth on the commercial side of things, excluding big brother who isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.“Fundamentals” sound great, doesn’t always apply as you have to adjust to the current market where anything goes and tech is overvalued as a whole, not a PLTR issue.-Citron did their damage, others have downgraded this company as well, and the lock up period is over. This stock is a few catalysts away from serious gains to the $40s and possibly $50 if it’s substantial enough.Either way, patience is key. The stock market rewards the guy who’s willing to wait it out > the guy who panics on every red day, 9/10 times."
I am beginning to forget how happy I felt whenever I checked the PLTR price in green...
I’ve been laughing all day at the bashers over the last week... I knew this will have its day and it will keep going next week!! 
when sankar 3 exercutive sell stock then you shouldsell stock donot hold or buyit it just probably show they have no confidence in the company and company business model andprobably see no growth if theysell stock then youdeserveto sellyourstock also scaryscary crashbackbelow $13 soon beveryvery afraid tolossalotlot more money get what you can now or getalotlot less then $13 soon
Don’t worry be happy!!
I am not shaking... love this stock
"Zoom out to 6m chart, and look at the insane volume of shares that were traded during lockup. Consider the fact that it actually made it to the other side without dropping below 25. (Miracle? Mithril?) Now play with the idea that long institutions and insiders now own close to a majority of the shares and they won't sell anytime soon - what volume is then required to make this move quite drastically upwards? My bet is that it won't take much, as the actively traded shares are actually not that many, less than 600 million, which is basically pre-lockup levels. With a loooong list of catalysts ahead, probably including but not limited to, Apple, Facebook, this is perfectly positioned to have FOMO applied to a limited number of shares. Perfect storm conditions, but we'll have to ride out this current situation first."
