Recent headlines and conversations for HOG

Dying company that makes loud obnoxious vehicles for old fat racists.
This pc of garbage got a free pass by the market. Dropped only 5% so far? Should have dropped at least 15%.
"Should be an up day for almost all stocks today as vaccine testsare progressing quickly.However, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo said Tuesday that they earmarked nearly $28 billion to cover credit losses last quarter, wiping out a huge chunk of profits made between April and June. JPMorgan, the largest US bank, reported a 51% plunge in second-quarter profit, citing the need to prepare for ""increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook."" Wells Fargo reported its first quarterly loss since the Great Recession. How does this affect Harley, with its almost half billion in debt?How will downturn affect financed bikes, etc."
Harley reports crumby results and promptly announces their fifth Five Year Strategic Plan in five years. Did the Sears Management team relocate to Milwaukee and start working for Harley? Ordinarily I would suggest they sell the company but no one wants this pile of garbage.
NIO $35b market cap. Haaaaa.
I got 1 put @22 on $hog. Y'all want to make fun of me on that too...plz

"And by no means is this the Presidents fault. HD has been on the wrong path for some time now. They treat their customers like Cr*p. Nobody is happy with their products.All of this would be very simple to solve, but of course, HD will not listen to their customers who they rely on to buy their product.GO FIGUREIT COSTS ME ABOUT $140+ TO DO A FLOID CHANGE.

Lock and reload my short position at 49.6 and will cover under 48 by Friday or Monday
Motorcycles will thrive in the post Corona age. No brainer. Their electric bike a stunner. Plus growth opportunity there immense. Winner
Millennials abhor anything wearing the brand name of HOG. They think the whole lifestyle is #$%$.
Why would anyone own Hog when Indian is taking sales away---This is going to get UGLY for the next 3 years
"Ronny Raygun, AWOL Bush, and tRump... Name three Presidents who turned a booming American economy into economic Depressions."
The SEC really needs to throw some people in jail in order to protect the integrity of the markets. What little there is.
only reason to buy HOG at these levels is if you need losses on your portfolio to mitigate gains.
"Yes, just like McAllister said in 2017 - opening the factory in Thailand will not impact jobs in the US."
the new HD Bronx
Lock ? in your gains before this #$%$ goes back to $22. Lol ? I really can?t wait till earnings !!
Dinosaur company. Millennials not biting it.
They can’t push it higher ...no sucker left for to unload their overvalued shares .lol
"they sold less motorcycles, right?should sell off as it was selling offat least not recover totally and somegive it time"
Hog has history of disappointing It’s gone up too fast
"Weeeeeeeee...If this keeps up, I'm going to trade my King in for a new Road Glide. :-) GO HARLEY!!!"
"From $32 last Wednesday to $36.50 yesterday... I don’t think it can hold. We are going back to $30 or lower after earnings. Sales have been very weak worldwide. The economy is slowing down and having a HOG is a luxury item. Good company don’t get me wrong, but it has come up to fast on no news."
"Not only are these bad earnings, the reading between the numbers, current Q looks like 20,000-30,000 bikes shipping. That is going to lead to a big loss."
Thailand offers $1 per hour labor. This has nothing to do with Tariffs. It’s all about labor. Big mistake. Harley Davidson will become the “Kia” of motorcycles. It probably won’t matter. They won’t survive.....nobody under the age of 55 buys a Harley Davidson.
"This company was going extinct soon anyway, just like the dinosaurs that ride around on its products. Trump is just hastening the process..."
"Harley Davidson was at 11.50 when Obama took office, and 58.60 when Obama left office. Look at it today. I bet they wish Obama was back"
"Harley-Davidson's Electric Bike LiveWire Sees Soft DemandHarley-Davidson, Inc. HOG electric motorcycle, LiveWire, is witnessing lower demand. Due to a hefty price of $29,900 and the model’s limited range, dealers are struggling to sell the electric motorcycles. Additionally, the company shipped the bikes almost two months late, which left just a month for dealerships in the Midwest and East to promote the model before the winter lull in bike sales.The target market for high-tech LiveWire is young, environmentally conscious customers.It appears that management has miscalculated the demand for LiveWire. The company anticipated the sale of the electric bikes to lead it to its former glory. Instead, it is predicted to witness more declines.With motorcycles losing its appeal, especially among the youth, Harley-Davidson motorbike sales are witnessing a decline. The firm is having difficulty attracting new buyers as millennials do not value the motorcycle status symbol. As millennials prefer convenient modes of transportation and ridesharing platforms like Uber, they don’t see owning motorcycle, electric or others, as an attractive option. Thus, the company’s retail sales have been declining domestically as well as internationally.Harley-Davidson has been witnessing declining sales trend for the past four years. Its sales are anticipated to decline in fiscal 2019 as well.Notably, over the past year, its shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to. Over this period, shares of the company have declined 17.4% against the industry’s growth of 5.4%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHarley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector are BRP Inc DOOO, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Lithia Motors LAD and CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy)."
Well that's the first dump
"I've been on a road king most of my adult life-I won't support ANY company that does business with Chinese communists...Harley just ended the great tradition and pride of American bikes, built by Americans for Americans ...woon't ride #$%$crap, won't drink swill from Starbucks, won't buy Asian-go custom or go home"
It’s struggling to stay above 37 with market at all time high.
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 17.02
"this company is a giant dump, should be trading mid 30's"
"Congrats to the Mgt Team - you have ""managed"" to drive the stock price down 30% in the last twelve months. You must be feeling so proud!"
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 29.82
"Trump Hoggers are nothing but spoiled babies. No NA-bound production is being shifted only European bound. Anybody buying a Harley in the USA will be buying a American made Hog. What a bunch of dumb,uneducated, babies Trump Deplorables are."
HOG is down 15.68% to 20.00
"Bear of the Day:Harley-Davidson has been the symbol of mid-life crises for decades and has profited off the massive Baby Boomer generation, but there is a new group of consumers in town and there set of demands is quite different. The chopper is going out of style and leading its progenitor, Harley-Davidson, down with it. Analysts continue to pessimistically lower its already deflated EPS estimates for this seemingly antiquated stock, pushing HOG down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)."
Hog- not going to bite
Todays snowflake generation are more the Vespa type. HOG is a thing of the past sadly.
"Why we ""Fired"" Americans and replaced them with H1B from India ?"
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 21.01
So what does this mean for the huge factory HD started building in Thailand last year? The only way this factory made sense was to reduce production in the US. Will the Thailand project now be cancelled so that HD's management does not have to face the wrath of Trump?
Haha this thing is gunna tank even harder now
"the product has too many loud versions that offend everyone they ride by, need to ticket them all"
"HD's service and warranty issues are dismal. Product reliability isn't just going downhill, its running downhill. The new M-8 still hasn't been fixed. When HD replaces motors instead of fixing them, you know you have a problem.Why HD doesn't listen to its customers is beyond me."
Fair value right now. Need 20% discount to buy.
This stock has been in decline since end of Jan. Tarif ain't the problem.
Honda is more American than Harley.
This Hog turned into a Dog and it is Dead.
My prediction is that Harley-Davidson will close today at $34 - $34.25 just watch the smart money  sell to lock in their gains.
"Just look at the financials, the consolidated. Lower rev's, Lower Operating Income, Lower earnings, etc, etc, etc. https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harley-davidson-announces-first-quarter-2019-results"
This could be a huge opportunity....provided Harley is willing to ride the EV wave higher. In my view.
"Hog- Already is at the peak, had a huge run up in a month. Buying it now into the winter would be foolish"
Harley needs to stop pricing itself beyond the average consumers purchasing power
up up an away$64-68 end of yearnever bet against an American icon
"99.88% of this company not owned by you ( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOG/holders?p=HOG )it inches up again, once 64% of this company was owned by you. AMF"
HOG is going bankrupt. Head for the exits. Millenials HATE everything about HOG products and culture. As a gen X I've always hated HOG with passion.
"I’m confused, we’re these good earnings?"
chart says 19.00
"Someone asked if there was another American made motorcycle, you should look at Indian, older then Hog, better, cheaper and more options"
Beautiful day today !! HOG is coming to Papá!! Lol  will cover at $35.00 Yay 
"HOG has gone up in Approx. two weeks from $32.85 to $40 a 22% increase in share value and the quarter was not a stellar quarter, on the contrary if was a 24% decrease in net earnings compare to prior year. I don’t think it will hold these levels for long."
"HOG made me money being long in the 90s and 2000s. That was then, and this is now. Short now...Munitions manufacturing has helped revenues, but not enough to offset declines in in sales."
"The over-all market held up better than I thought today, yet we added more hedges like SQ, PYPL and V last week and again today, for all long heavy accounts now 15% “short” most in a while. We think this is a serious bubble in payment names.We sold all ORIT for a huge gain, close to takeout price now, what a move.TCF we added back in a little today under $22.50, we got out to soon, this is a good deal for both banks and a sign that there will be 400 deals this year not 200, already over 20 banks sold in 2019 wow! This will be for a trade only.This is really a wake-up call, for all banks, to merge now, sell-now or be left behind, you need size period.The new tax laws have helped banks for sure grow earnings, free money, thank you, Donald. Earnings reports are very strong, even without the tax cuts for many small banks, so far this quarter and the next 2 weeks all the reports, will be out, so far great reports, mean much higher stock prices.NUBK got almost 2 times book, wow. In sleepy upstate NY. Northeast banks always get a good price!Even THFF ,which opened lower after they announced there deal, is now way up from those levels.If you are very long like 15 names and “short” a few high priced ones, you should do very well again this year, as the market made a firm turn today for bank stocks, almost like the Internet bubble, when stuff like NVDA, gets crushed, the banks run and run, looks like the same kind of period we are in now as back then.Even JPM was very strong again today.I would bet we see 200 more deals by summer, in the biggest wave of deals in over 15 years.OPY will have earnings out soon, they should blow away the numbers and look for a push back thru $30 or $40, as a deal is coming this year 75% chance. Still our largest holding at 66% of all funds. Can’t wait to see if they bought back any of there shares under $25 last month. I bet they did if so that’s a huge statement for OPY. We added some RCBC under $185, AVBH under $21, QNTO under 12.20 and MCPH under $27 this month, and will keep adding these.RCBC worth $285 very cheap, strong management a sale is coming in 2019.AVBH worth $30 very cheap (as long as no bad loans, pop up, most risky but best earnings growth period). A sale will happen 1 to 5 years away.QNTO earnings out this week, buy heavy up to $12.50 before the bank does, cheap worth $17.00 no downside risk. CEO old a sale within 1-3 years. Just sold off in the recent year end downturn. 50,000 share buyback should start this week.MCPH cheap worth $41, no bad loans, buy up to $28 heavy, CEO old a sale very soon! Also, just sold off in the recent year end downturn.PA has way too many banks, look for deals in all our past names, many are still cheap enough to buy today and PA is pretty safe state for asset quality.We are 130% now long and 32% “short” for all very long accounts, have not had these kinds of numbers in 12 years, but there is a time to make money and it is now, bet heavy with “hedges”. Enough said!!!PFOH adding some back in at $28.50 or less, very safe and old CEO.We sold the last bit of IBKC also today, wow what a move.NKSH we sold all for a flat trade, better values now.COFS will add more under $23 if it gets there.TRCY added a little back in under $19.00I know this is a crazy market and you must trade it and take advantage of this, volatility.

Those Harley Puts I bought are doing work today. 
"Trouble in paradise.The Harley-Davidson LiveWire is making the headlines yet again. After media outlets reported that the premium product meant to attract younger people to the brand failed to live up to the expectations, it is now victim of a false start. The Motor Company confirmed in a press release published on Monday that production of the LiveWire has been halted. This isn't linked to the models underwhelming sales, but rather due to a glitch in the quality controls, resulting in what the company describes as a ""non-standard condition""."
Any word on the electric motorcycle progress?
Let's see if this touches 40s?
Reloaded my short 1500 shares at 37.06.
"""Its a hell of a price to pay for being stylish"".Dirty Harry."
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 17.87
It’s going to finish its upwards trend first. There won’t be a big reversal until it hits resistance.
Jumping in as soon as stock hits $45.
Hog director Sells 100k shares.NICE DUMP
anytime there's any size on that bid it gets fn nailed!! too funny!! can't believe more can't see that. this #$%$ is going doooooown!!
Harley is a BEAST! Better get in now! tomorrow HOG skyrockets!
Harley-Davidson reached a 52 Week low at 22.60
Frankly if you can afford to stay short this stock for the next 3 years you will make 100% on your money. YKITRW
One other choice Bill and Hill in black leather each with a hog between their legs.
Anyone else see the premarket activity in Hog and know what's up ?
Harley-Davidson is up 10.52% to 32.05
Anyone have a good free resource for market research in the motorcycle industry? Really just looking for more high level information so don’t want to have to pay money for a recent report. Thanks!
"HD has been outsourcing parts and closing dealerships for years,And they are about to pay a a price! Sears closing stores and not maintaining the rest-Management that only cares about THEIR compensation and screw the company! Both companies have the same mentality."
Hog will close below $25.95 today... analysts are trying to push this Pig    higher to sell before earnings and short it. Folks the name the the game here is to read the analyst and out flank them to make money . I feel bad for the little retailers that doesn’t know how the game Is played.
If Harley Davidson $HOG had great earnings then $KMX should do well too.
"This stock and company reminds me of GE, both dead ducks. Nobody rides a Harley because its a good bike, they ride them for the social element. For crying out loud, up until 2 years ago they still had CD players on their touring bikes. Who the heck still uses CDs? BMW bikes are better in every way! Fact!"
Harley-Davidson puts motorcycle launch on backburnerhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/harley-davidson-bronx-motorcycle-launch-postponed
"Watched HD for a long time while new electric car, scooter and bike companies came and went! "
HD ought to be ashamed of themselves
Trump lovers need to stop riding their Harleys immediately - or they hate America.ROFLMAO!!!
"Trump has been stirring up trouble everywhere, trade wars, Amazon etc. It's becoming impossible to invest your hard earned money in his debacle."
"I can't tell you how many messages I have read talking about Harley and people will want to buy motorcycles because they're tired of the virus and stuff like that,well let me tell you I ordered a Honda and it took eight weeks to get it in the same thing with a side-by-side dealers can't keep bikes in stock the problem is Harley nobody wants one"
Senior executive turnover and layoffs mean things are bad. real bad
"My friend, an accomplished designer and machinist once said that Harley didn't have any engineers, only blacksmiths."
Harley-Davidson is up 7.10% to 39.81
This is pennies away from its one year target.Overvalued now?
Can HOG get Livewire and other ebikes down to competitive pricing with volume?Livewire would do well at $19-23k? ( not the current $30k )
35C 3/19 . All over it at $2 after the fall 3 days ago . Will go back to $44 by eom
"Folks cash  in your gains before they are all gone !! HOG just broke to $38’s and it’s going down to $32 which is what it was only 2 weeks ago. Indian Motorcycle ramping heavy competition against Harley will not help HOG sales !! Also the worldwide  economy is slowing down. Buying such an expensive Harley in Europe will not work. The average Joe in Europe cannot afford a Harley and the Electric bike is out of the question ($30,000). I predict that Harley’s $30,000 electric bike will be a big mistake."
This should bounce nicely
This is an example of the worst FED corruption I have ever seenTHIS HAS TO STOPMARKET SHOULD BE AT 17K NOT 25KWorst part is its my tax money they're committing crimes with
The livewire is a joke.
Wow.........what a wild ride today has been...........Go HOG......you are a day trader's dream.
I do not see how the up and coming QT report can be anything but dismal.
"Caterpillar stock falls after losing 6.97% year over year, Harley Davidson losses 24% year over year and it goes up. Manipulated by Wall Street. After going up 9 out of 10 days, today is going down to $38. Worldwide economic conditions will not be good for Harley’s high price bikes."
"Trump confirmed it, Harley's no longer being American made will be the end of the brand and the company"
"Glaring Problems With Harley Davidson That Everyone Chooses To IgnoreQuestionable Lending HabitsHarley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) is not exactly known to scrutinize applicants requiring financial assistance for a Harley Davidson purchase. The newer the bike you’re interested in, the better they will be able to do for you. They’re much more lenient with bad credit scores and the application process as a whole when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers.It’s not uncommon to be approved for a stupendously long-term loan, in an obvious effort to further extend monthly payment plans and make purchasing a Harley Davidson more attainable for the average shopper. While we most certainly appreciate this boost, it’s definitely a bit sketchy. Of course, when you really want one of these spectacular bikes, it’s easy to turn a blind eye to this.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
"Technology Passed Them By #13There are still bikers who love how ""old-school"" a Harley is. They prefer a more straightforward bike that just offers a great powerful performance rather than something fancy. Sadly, that base is slowly shrinking as technology has advanced. Scores of bikes on the market provide top-notch tech with their engines while Harley seems reluctant to keep up.It also means too many of their bikes are prone to issues newer models have long moved on from. Harley-Davidson has been working with new tech but they've been lagging behind other companies and are hard-bent to catch up."
"Harley & the Davidsons had been building motorcycles for 40 years before the first baby boomer was even born, so almost 60 years before boomers became the main market. Sad to say, but boomers will pass completely out of the market eventually. Since HOG is going global, and since HOG acknowledges that many potential consumers here have very limited discretionary funds available, they should consider going back to closer to what they started with: something more like a moped. It doesn't have to be that, but lightweight, inexpensive, transportation. A lot of the expense of present day Harleys is the paint: best in the industry. But people living on a tight budget don't want to invest in a world class paint job; they would rather it had no paint at all. They don't want to pay a lot for a place to park it, and they don't want to pay a lot to insure it or store it. They want reliable transportation that doesn't require a lot of maintenance, and what little it does require, they can do themselves. That is the status of the billions of people who live in the global market at this point in time. Catering to that would be American ingenuity."
Time for a split 5-1 would be nice 
Rally has to do with dividends play til 12-17 . I will reload my short position after that .
I loaded more around 10 this Am .Good ER This could be a 5- 10 X in a few years .IMO
"While hog still try to wear lipstick, everybody knows that hogs cannot fly."
"Attention Trump bashing idiots. Try reading the newspaper on a regular basis and educating yourself. Harley already announced well before the tariffs that they were shutting down the Kansas City plant and building in a new facility in Thailand. This is just an excuse to take the heat off the Executives who are killing yet another business by moving to Asia for cheap labor. How are Harley riders going to insult ""rice burners"" when their own bike is now becoming a rice burner?"
"It's the reap-sow continuum on display. Trump blew through his inherited fortune and many bankruptcy proceedings later, cached in on licensing his ritzy, garish brand with arguable success. You probably want to ask consumers of his products (Trump University Alumni (cough), various hotels and condo's around the world...) So c'mon folks. There are some coherent political arguments for voting and still supporting this guy, but if it's business prowess you're a fool. Can't you find somebody with high integrity, high morals, economically savvy, and who follows your ideals? Trump? Really? Throw us a bone in the name of common sense will you please."

The little retail investors need to know:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rideapart.com/articles/429513/harley-davidson-removed-sp500-index/amp/
HOG is toast. New sales are plummeting. Used market is glutted with inventory. Less younger motorcycle riders and they’re buying cheaper/cooler brands i.e. Indian. Older riders are riding less and not buying new. You’ve been warned longs. Look at a chart to see where we’re going. #truth
I've been searching for a good 'short' candidate and this seems perfect.
Harley-Davidson will pull back today... it’s gone up too fast in the last 5 days. Options activity are are looking very weak.
looks like the downtrend has begun.
"Wow a head case President who seem to want an American company to go away. The GOP sits back and lets it happen. When asked about it they skirt the issue and cannot answer a simple question. Sad and dangerous for America. Trump cult followers seem to think his steps across ""all"" lines is OK as well as his lies. Again Wow, where are the American who stood tall before? Silence."
Have you guys seen the debt load Harley-Davidson has !! When in the hell will they pay all that debt ?? It’s already losing steam... will close today at $34 and by Friday we will see $32. Mark this post.
Unless the CEO is removed Chapter 11 Is coming and that isn’t a club
just like i said to the moon in the am yaw never listen .your all wrong
Harley service tech's. are telling people to stay away from the M-8. The motor is just not fixable.
"Harley are too expensive for foreign countries! Hell, Harleys are too expensive for Americans, thats why sales are down. Lets not forget the quality is has been going down hill once again. These bikes have serious issues.Look at the Institutional ownership, very few to most do not own Harley, this company is floating on managed money, not a good sign. My advice is to"
Harley-Davidson is up 6.46% to 29.34
Never count out the HOG.
up$4 a share after earnings tommorow
"Ok where are all the analyst and smart ones here pumping this Hog    , I told you guys it was coming down and it did. Stock Trader knows this game !!! Pay attention folks don’t let the analysts steal your money !!"
"HOG from $32.75 on October 9th to $37.15 now in just two weeks!! It’s gone up to fast with no good news, poor little investors they will be left holding the bag. Lol "
Harley numbers will confirm my expectations of a turnaround 
It marks a new low when an elite politician / ex-reality star targets an American company and threatens to put them out of business. Is Trump setting us up to be a new Russian state?
From 2015 till today HOG has added an additional 1 billion in debt will sales have been flat. This little rally is weak short covering... stay Strong  shorts don’t cover yet. This thing will crash on Tuesday.
Harley-Davidson has enough problems without insulting the President of the United States. I would guess that 80% of Harley's customers are Republican. Unfortunately your executives are dirtbags.
Can't break the fib re-trace. This'll be $30 by March.
"HOG keeps coming down and we might even see RED today. Folks the numbers were all dressed up !! The quarter was weak on all metrics.... sometimes it takes a little time for people to digest all their #$%$ ?. I will be covering between $34 hopefully, but at $36 I am good !!!!"
"This board has nothing but ridiculous clowns blaming their stupid investment decisions on Trump. Was here 3 months ago, same idiotic #$%$. Nobody twisted your arm to buy this stock. Now you can start bashing me for pointing out your stupid investment decision. Later Bag Holders."
Traffic in the Stealers is dismal. Downright sad.
"They have such a smart management team. Keep going everyone, there is a light at the end of the tunnel..."
Motley Fool writes very good articles.
"I just shorted 75,000 share of HOG at $36.10... earnings will disappoint and it’s gone up to fast. Sorry "
"This cant also be short squeezing price up, can it? Short is less than 15%, which isnt insignificant, but its not Gamestock levels. Regardless, this company is on long decline until they merge or get bought up"
"HOG is down due to Trump's terrible tariffs. The company got hit by a double whammy. First Trump imposed steel and aluminum, then the EU reacted by imposing tariffs on US build motorcycles. No wonder they are moving operations out of the country. I would do the same."
"Countries accounting for 70 percent of the global market recorded a 19.2-percent decline in Harley registrations this January, Andress said in a Thursday note. Last year, registrations rose 19.1 percent over the same period."
look for a wall st push up to 58 before earnings then shes all down hill from there
easiest short in the market my Harley dealer it's overflowing with inventory but my Honda dealer has no inventory and things are sold before it hits the door
Gotta love a HOG 
HOG is up 9.97% to 22.61
why is Dennis Bowe still there?
Unprecedented!!! This seems like it will only get worse.
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 26.69
How much meth to you have to sell to buy one of these things anyway?
didn't expect the upswing today
"Harley Division.... practically canceled the dividend and is cutting jobs drastically. Sales are really bad... after earnings we will see $18 - $19. Shorts continue to pile up, now HOG has 12% shirt interest from a short interest of 7%. This is not looking good for Harley. I say this Pig    is coming down hard."
Harley-Davidson Investors Sour on CEO Zeitz’s Turnaround Planhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/harley-davidson-drops-first-loss-133937207.html
"Sad to say and admit this, but Harley is dying rapidly. Globalist millennials won't buy their products no matter what they try to do."
"Please, don't blame Harley Davidson for what is happening, blame your President!!!!! When does people are going to realize that not to make America great again. Other company are going to follow and move in other country.... and I personally don't blame them!!!! Remember, Trump started everything, Trump is a stubborn greedy as>>>> and he will hurt the US economy..."
"We saw the high of the year for HOG today... from here on is down hill to $12 - $13. I am serious about this, Harley is in a terrible position right now. Polaris and the others are eating their lunch. After visiting the 5 South Florida stores I am convinced that Harley is not only dead money, but negative money . If this coronavirus does not go away in a quarter or two... Harley might be forced to file for bankruptcy. They are burning lots of cash and they have approximately $8.2 billion in debt. That is a huge number for a company that will have sales of only $3.2 billion and twice their current market cap. I will cover at $20, but it’s going lower long term."

Question: Is America Harley`s biggest market ? Moving production over seas makes no sense then..
how bad or good do you guys think it's going to be this morning
"Production cut, layoff's, just the start. HOG is pricing itself out of production. You should see what they are trying to charge for brake pads, batteries, etc.In a slowing economy you should be discounting, not inflating. Run don't walk."
When's the 10Q getting filed?
dealers still cant push out 16s ..they are full of bikes ...a good short I think here
$30 a share within 3 months
Didn't HD lobby the US government to hike tariffs to save their #$%$ from foreign bike manufacturers?They've done well but how well did they plan for the future?
"Maybe the farmers in Iowa could trade some soy bean for a harley, I hear they have plenty on hand..."
Daily reminder; If you a short HOG you stand to lose a boat load of cash
New revamped Indian Motorcycle is Awesome !! They are going head to head with Harley Davidson... more trouble for HOG. Not a good thing... HOG will have pressure from all sides. Today we break to $38.
Time for a split!
"Ten years ago Harley-Davidson was a three dollar stock, its going back to three dollars. this is a replay."
Pump and dump at its finest
Buying more shares today.Adding to my GPK position too.
keep punching that bid fund trader. I like your style and your exit finesse. you hide your trade very well and are obviously an exit specialist! Cheers!!
"Numerous researches indicate that young Americans do not ride motorcycles, #$%$ HD style. Dying brand, waste of money."
"Wait until the earnings come out in two weeks, this thing will sink like a boat ancohor."

HOG resurrected with the 3 new models and a electric bike for all the millenials And a new CEO .
Harley will survive but as a much smaller company. the stock price is going sub 30 within 12 to 18 months.
Harley-Davidson is down 5.58% to 23.87
"It is funny to me to read conversations from the people who short stocks. They are always in a panic watching the stock market. I have owned Harley for 28 years. I have never sold a single share. I do not feel I have to watch the stock everyday. Harley has been good to me, even in the last bearish years. They are a solid company and will come back. I do not think it will be electric cycles. Harley as been forced to go over seas for assembly and parts. Labor charges in America is crazy when a guy making french fries wants $15.00 an hour. He is a $7.50 hour person. Harley will make a comeback."
HOG=PIG
How much longer will the board allow the CEO to run this company into the ground?
At least their tax cuts will help pay for the move. Winning the Trump way
Nice downside move today! Historically Nov. is a good month for HOG meaning 80% of the time it closes out the month higher. Then Dec. is one of its worst months at 20%. GLTA!!
I have had 8 new Harleys over past 25 years. I sold my last one this spring. For Harley people the models you would want are 35-45 grand ! The small sportsters are not going to do it for seasoned rider. I cant wait to see who would buy the Live wire? Big money without the Harley sound !
Last chance to get out over 34 .Market has topped out with big pump so the big boys can dump on retailers.lol
I wish I was in the know on the manipulation also. SEC how about a little transparency here.
"HOG is fighting to sray up with the big boys, with weak volume, would like to see the inevitable slide start now rather than wait until next week to get out of this dying stock."
"Did you see the new 2020 CVO Limited? $46,+++.00 almost 47K. Do you think they will sell how many of them? NOT MANYNow you add pipe and tune it which will cost another 2K, taxes, title out the door your looking at 50K. O'ya, then you have to add the warranty to it, OUCH.Do you think HD of figuring this out yet? NOPE"
"15 Reasons Harley-Davidson Is In Serious Trouble In 2020Harley-Davidson has been struggling for years to keep up with younger companies, but they're in serious trouble in 2020, and here are reasons why:There are things in the auto industry most take for granted: The Big Three will still be a force even if Detroit is in rough shape. Europe makes the best sports cars. And Harley-Davidson will always dominate as the best motorcycles in the U.S. But in the last several years, that last point has become less sure. The fact is that Harley-Davidson never truly recovered from the 2009 recession, and things have been rough for them in the last few years. CEO Matt Levatich abruptly left in March after a tenure that saw the company's sales slump majorly.This was before the current pandemic threw the entire automotive industry for a huge loop, and many companies are struggling. But even before that, Harley-Davidson was entering 2020 in bad shape. The company suffers from a poor image, a lack of good products, and numerous mistakes that make it harder to get back on track. While some hope they can recover, 2020 could well be the beginning of the end for an American institution.15 Supply Chains Are Breaking DownThe current pandemic is wreaking havoc with the auto industry. For a company already facing issues like Harley-Davidson, it's even worse. The shutdowns of factories mean that Harley-Davidson has lacked in the simplest materials for everything from bike steel to even rubber for handlebars.While dealerships can be open, they have no new products coming in, and repair shops also lack the proper materials. The pandemic is exposing how fragile the auto industry supply chains are, and Harley is struck by their breakdowns."
"For those interested, I found Stock Trader! He's currently blowing up the following boards:$HOG$PINS$CGC"
It’s going to be sell on the news on Tuesday... since HOG already has gone up 12% in two weeks.
HOG is done. Millenials and gen-X'rs think the whole leather vest fat bodys in as$less chaps movement is totally ga y. Nobody wants a HOG any more and the only one's that ever did are TOTAL LOSERS
Distressing to see that Nov inventory was 16991 and today is 18129. Hope they can capture the younger crowd bc the older/baby boomers are dying off.
"Wow, YOY sales down, profit down, tariffs looming. And HOG management moving this 100 year old USA company to foreign countries? Great time to short, millennials not buying HOGS and they are losing their old customer base and cache. Dead brand in USA. Great long term short here."
Is this STUPID or DESPERATE ? It could just be DESPERATELY STUPID !!!!https://www.wsj.com/articles/harley-davidson-acquires-stacyc-expanding-electric-portfolio-11551798276?mod=hp_major_pos13
Hope the shorts on here are enjoying this steady racheting towards $150
"There is nothing wrong with HOG. They build products guys my age want. The problem is that guys like me are old, infirm and are dying out. Young folks are much more enlightened at the age of 25 than I was at that age. They do not want a hog."
Be thankful if you took profits. This company is a joke
Slipping below $20 this morning.How low will it be in a month?
"If Lib Morons believe just a fraction of the nonsense they post here, their party is doomed."
Take your whole company overseas Progressive losers 
I have made more money trading Harley Davidson every time it spikes up and shorting it than any other stock that I’ve traded. I know how this works it’s gonna go down to $32 - $34 easily by the end of the day or if not tomorrow.
Sell with both hands up to technical resistance around $27.80. Often see a little pop as the dinosaurs add to their 401ks on Monday. $24.38 is ST downside objective. GLA
Harley-Davidson is up 7.92% to 34.60
Made a lot of money shorting this HOG pig    .... might go long before earnings this time if I can catch it at $34.50.
"Its starting, Its time to run. time to get out of this mess. by next week this stock will be ten dollars. Jim."

"This stock was DOA many a moon ago. The aging Baby Boomers with their thick wallets have come and gone forever people. Kids don't rode motorcycles. They're nerds. lazy, spoiled rotten brats. Locked onto their childish toys like the iphone. #$%$. How myopic are you folks anyway?"
"Harley-Davidson was in trouble before all of the coronavirus shutdowns, and things haven't gotten a lot better in the interim. But now, as H-D's factories in the US start to get back to work, the company has a new plan to break itself out of its longtime funk.Part of that involves paring back operations -- specifically production. The company is going to be making fewer models, with fewer available options and in fewer colors, and then it's going to make fewer of them, according to a report published Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal."
Went short today. Maybe they’ll surprise with some fancy accounting but long term Harley will have great difficulties. Very little risk has been priced into this once great company.
"LOL. Memories of a long time HD rider (pans &shovels) I got into this early on (1990) but unfortunately I didnt have much money back then, so I bought four shares, got a paper certificate. Anyway, the stock rapidly split 3 or four times. It was doing great. Of course, being a young guy, sooner or later I needed the money to get out of some jam I got myself into. So I cashed most of it out a few years later. I still have four HD shares for nostalgic reasons. Now Im more successful and invest elsewhere. Anyway, all the best to the die-hard Harley investors!"
"CAT , BA , TXN , MCD all missed their earnings and lower guidance . Market is toasted ..FED keep pumping $$& .lol"
Folks this is not your typical high flyer .... it will come down like a rock !!
"Harley-Davidson is overbought at this moment !!! It will pull back, if your up substantially sell and lock  in your gains, don’t be left holding the bag. Folks its not straight up it needs to consolidate."
"$15-17 is about fair value until HD can demonstrate that it can increase earnings for at least 1q to stop the bleeding. they can promise all they want with new bikes and new focus, but at some point they need to deliver and show it in the bottom line. yes the pandemic affected this Q and will the next one, but it has been 13 straight quarters of earnings decline. can't entirely blame the virus."
Correction is coming.
This is taking off
Look out below!!!!
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 19.02
The market needs to correct 3-5 % .all the bs trade talk hope will not hold up into the 4 Q .
I hope the new SEC head takes this this manipulation more serious than the previous hump. Time to put Gordon in jail!!

"Harley’s new competition is going to be a whole host of small Japanese scooters and bikes, I don’t know how you make money competing with the $3500 Honda cub"
"At the first quarter report Matt said that shipments were up for the first quarter. What he failed to say is he held back shipments in the 4th quarter warehousing the bikes and shipping then January first !!! He did not tell a lie to the stock holders he just tell the whole story. The also got in bed with Eagle Rider the rental company what cost the motor company over 700,000 last year. and it affected used bike price at the HDFS auction lowering the price to them too so they even hurt there Bank !!! Matt NEEDS TO GO !!!!!"
debt level is a bit concerning
And the big boys are selling !!! This pig    is cooked. Lol .... see you all experienced traders at $37 very soon !!
This Hog is cooked!
To many here are negative . This is a great company with a great product. Will be at $36 to $39 in a few weeks or sooner. It pays a very good dividend while you wait for stock appreciation. It’s a win win !
There's a lot of negativity on this board.Time to buy.
"7,500 not 75,000... lol "
Harley-Davidson reached a 52 Week low at 26.69
"The bottom line on why Harley is failing is the price of a Harley and the pressure on the dealers to make a profit .You get low balled on a trade in and who really wants to spend over 30G on a bike. I have been riding for 40 years and have been buying used Harleys from weekend warriors that keep them for one year and sell them. You get great deals. The key for Harley to recover is to cut production ,make more custom looking stock bikes and get some unique colors the line of colors suck and enough with the denim .FTW"
Harley Davidson Is Revved Up. Why One Analyst Thinks the Stock Could Idle.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/267d5f9f-d6a5-3cb9-948a-97555c44fdd5/harley-davidson-is-revved-up-.html
paulw do some homeworkhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16955928/harley-davidson-electric-motorcycle-2019
breaking news hd discovered people buy used motorcycles and like them and are getting I the used market
Overbought at this point .
HOG is down 45% over the past 5 years. Management has been riding the old HOG horse into the ground. The company is headed that way too. The didn't get the Hotwire right as their next big thing. Just too expensive and not enough range for any kind of riding. On the highway it has less than a 100 mile range. Sorry HOG. The competition in EV motorcycles will come in at about half the price and more performance. HOG management needs fresh blood and fast. Their bikes are just not what the younger generation wants. It has been years since they should have know this but they have failed.
thank you HOG!
HOG clearly being manipulated !! Keep buying it at these levels... your going to be played !! The analyst at the moment just want to get out.
Loss -35 vs +est +. 08 it’ fell off the cliff
"First Gibson, next will be Harley Davidson.Two companies selling expensive products that nobody needs."
Fingers crossed for a s*it show!!!I've got nine $16.5 May 8th put contracts. Send HOG to ZERO
"Hog- with cheap gas, most won’t go for cycles"
"this week we'll see if 34.80 holds, don't think it does and think we settle at around 32s, market has been negative this week and weak and this was overdone with short covering from the run up."
I'm going to wait it out and pay 37k for an electric bike from Hog instead of buying the Mercedes Benz for the same price.https://www.indianmotorcycle.com/en-us/special-offers/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvdOsqv314gIVByDTCh2YOQ5nEAEYASAAEgIvdPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

Amazon earnings miss and it’s down $120 bucks !!! Tomorrow the market will be down and HOG will be down big !!

Looks like it is starting to roll over
please for the love of God short HOG! I absolutely looove taking all of yalls money!!!!!!!!!
"Just take a look at the financials,all segments, bikes, part, merchandise down, the only thing up was the need for HD to finance their products people are not buying.

Selling 50 year old technology at double price. This should be a cash cow. Where all the money goes?
"Associated With Bad Boy ImageWhen you think of Harley Davidson as a company, it may not just be the bike that pops into your mind with vivid imagery. The “bad boy image” is clearly attached to ownership of this motorcycle, and is something that everyone purchasing a Harley either embraces or overlooks. This is definitely known as a “bad boy bike”, boasting an aggressive sound and a widely dominant culture of bikers that look, and sometimes act, as loudly as the bikes they ride.Everything associated with Harley Davidson seems to be aligned with projecting a bad-boy, ultra-cool, don’t-mess-with-us persona. From the attire that is branded to the accessories that are sold, every aspect of Harley Davidson perception seems linked to being part of the bad-boy-club.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
wow some B's manipulation on this today no logic
"Well worldwide economies are slowing down, not many can afford an expensive Harley. And here in the USA sales continue to drop 5 years in a row quarter after quarter. I will be holding my short position and might even add another 2,000 shares to average up. It is a surprise to me that they failed I very metric and this thing is up... Unfathomable."
You gotta love it - General Donald T tells the Chinese - HEY in my war only I can attack and have weapons OK...what a loon. He actually told them not to raise tariffs on US after he just raised them in a huge way on them. That MAGA hat turns off all higher level mental processing for sure. Maybe now the republicans will finally fight back FOR AMERICA and not the party. Remember Charlie Sykes a conservative radio/speaker from Wisconsin came out early and said Trump would destroy the republican party and he is right. WOW. Boolean
Every member in my Dallas trading group shorted HOG yesterday. No one is buying motorcycles anymore. This one is a no brainer.

"9am tomorrow morning, thats still the earnings release?Should be a fun day."
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 22.60
loses 45% profits. divvies cut 95% 13th quarter in a row of earnings reduction. this is a penny stock. you're watching a company go slowly out of business that uses every trick in the book to sound better on paper. earnings 'beat' expectations even though it still decreased. lol.
"manipulation to push shorts out12% shortno earnings, sales fall around 10%how could it go up?"
The Milwaukee Eight is a game changer. The top line is reflective of the anticipation of the Milwaukee Eight while the bottom line is reflective of the investment in the Milwaukee Eight and development through the addition. Harley Davidson's 15 percent growth and 3 percent dividend is respectable. The current political climate and the Milwaukee Eight set up Harley Davidson well going forward. Harley Davidson is undervalued with its financial metrics suggesting a $120 a share valuation. The tea cup technical aspects don't hurt either.
Is it time to short HOG?
HOG is down 4.90% to 34.14
As long as HD ties itself to the Trump Administration 1/2 of their potential markets (like me) will shop elsewhere.
HOG reached a new 52 Week Low at 42.79
"So Many RecallsWe wish we could tell you that this bike is expensive, but it’s so reliable that it’s justified….but we can’t. Harley Davidson recalls are plentiful. There’s definitely no shortage of issues with these bikes, and they constantly top recall lists for various components.These recalls have affected everything from the front wheel to the taillight and nearly all parts in-between. As recently as January of this year, headlines everywhere were blasting the news of over 44,000 Street motorcycles being recalled for braking issues. Back in 2015, Harley was recalling more than 185,000 motorcycles in the US because the saddlebags were falling off and increasing crash-risks. These bikes cost more money & come with more problems!https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
Come back to Papá .... we see $38’s today and when the market corrects back to $32.
Always knew this was a good investment but some idiots on this bored say I’m out to lunch if u never driven a Harley then u wouldn’t get it if u have never felt the rumble as u rev the engine on a brand new Harley then just move on there’s nothing here fir u
"trumpty had to import bikers to country club in Bedminster, N.J., where he likes to cheat at golf on the weekends. There, in what used to be horse country, rode in a group of so-called Bikers for Trump. The old white biker dudes were invited by Mr. Trump because it’s likely that none of the old white golfer dudes at his club ride hogs; they’re more Audi than Harley."
"Calm down, calm down, calm downNever owned a motorbike, but 175 cars/trucks have come and gone. The Trumpster talks big, but does carry a small stick now and then.GOD BLESS AMERICA and the WORLD...."
bunch of clown non riders here for sure ..None of you even own a harley or have ever been in a dealership 
"Bought 2,000 of HOG at $30.50... yes I did. I was a short before, but this entry point is very good."
Year over year sales down and net income down... they are simply dress it up with #$%$. Who in their right mind would be committing new money here at these high levels.
We will see 40s very soon in next week or so.

"Wow, recalling 175,000 bikes due to brake failures. Can the news get any worse for HD?"
HOG is desperately trying to stay relevant. Should have kept up with the times and made some cool scooters. The whole world ride scooters nowadays. Only the geriatric crowd still ride the noisy pensive hogs. Nuff said... it’s marketing myopia! Dinosaurs die.

Game over for HOG the big boys will start dumping on the retailers .Tutes ownerships is 95 % it will get ugly once market start to correct. IMO
Just hit the analyst consensus target price for the year. LOL.
How are you gonna ride now with the stay at home orders thrusted upon us. Where are you gonna ride to with everything closed up. Basically we are being held prisoner at home for the time being. With all the job losses buying a Harley is the last thing people are thinking about. That applies to cars and boats too as well. What a mess we are in.

Buy American is not just a fleeting trend! Buying patinaed zippos on ETSY watching netflix and a hog in the garage is not a bad way to live. Wishing this one higher!
seems like david's great analysis is just calling everyone idiot lol
"Anyone who buys Hog now, should get a check-up from the neck-up. If you wait a week you can by for three dollars a share or less."
Big SELLOFF is coming
Dealers are reporting increased sales.
What an excellent entry point to buy Apple  before the ex-dividend and before the new product announced on the 10th. Just ordered 4 iPhone  12 Pro for my family for Christmas . Apple will close around $120 by this Friday. Buy and hold you will make money 
Any weakness in the market it will drop 2-3 % .The big boys are dumping on any rally .
when will Polaris acquire HD nameplate it's just a matter of time
I guess you can only rip off customers for so long.
Let the weak shorts cover... we don’t need them. Will crash tomorrow !!! Sales flat and weaker ridership.
"I am considering shorting this stock although I'm thinking of buying a bike. The way I see it most of their bikes are owned by old geezers, who are dying off. There are all kinds of ads in the paper here of people trying to sell their bikes. Few bikes for sale have a lot of miles on them. Once built they last pretty much forever. Who would buy a new HOG? I think the fact that Trump has been elected also hurts this company a lot. The possibility of expanding sales overseas has declined substantially, overseas citizens now hate this country because of Trump and so I doubt they will buy anymore bikes."
All I can say is wow .. and hey thanks trump
by the way the recession has startedthe numbers will back it up later
"So let's stop selling small bikes at a loss and we will make more money? Wow, it only took around five years to figure that out? So glad the prior mgt team members have now all moved out. What a clueless bunch of arrogant clowns they were."
This is a typical Warren Buffet stock. Now too small for his fund.
With nearly 8 billions in debt this company completely bankrupt.
told y'all sowe move aggressively higher from here next quarter will be a blast off to $70.00
"Over 40% of HD cycles are sold overseas and growing. It’s a smart decision for the company, to expand, and grab market share where they can. Sales have slumped in the US for years"
I went on to the Harley-Davidson Twitter page to see what the backlash look like but there are no comments from consumers
What surprise will we get tomorrow????

Between the false economy the overpriced products and the louzzzzzy colors these bike are sporting, who could have guessed.The pain will most likely gets worse, HD motor company just doesn't take a hint and they don't listen to their (used to be loyal customers). 42K for a bike is a joke, parts and accessories are absurdly priced, and the new counter balance - what gives with that?You want to know a secret? Saving the air cooled is easy, fixing all internal combustion motors is easy. But these motor companies just will not listen."

This is crazy insane !! 31% in 10 trading days with all the problems they have. I don?t buy it."
Does hog have pricing power. That’s the key question. If so it’s a buy. If not it’s a sell.

I'm 62 years old retired and purchased a new Hog. Retirement will be great! Don't want to be seen riding next to an electric Harley.
HOG is up 4.92% to $36.47
Trading doesn’t have to be about losing all the time. It doesn’t have to be about letting the markets pummel you day in day out. Fight back with (http://Pick-stocks.com). Beef up your defenses and join them.
How low does it go in the next two weeks?
So 12 quarters of falling revenues and people are buying this pig. Really folks!!!! Keep buying it please.
For the short term HOG could climb with the market. A rising tide raises all ships. Thoughts and comments are appreciated!
"Hog- peaked, over bought"
This is just a short squeeze. Enjoy it while it lasts.HOGs get slaughtered
PR from Sturgis isnt what HD needs to sell smaller bikes and ebikes to non-traditional customers.
"the economy is supposedly doing goodbut a recession is in the cardsHOG will do bad then electric bike is cool, but expensivegood company, but tough to be themfolks like the cheaper rice burners"
"Still long and strong since I got in at $19 a few months back. As soon as the remainder of weaklings finish selling out because of the earnings miss, HOG will breakout above $30. For the short term, the big boys on Wall Street are in charge of this one. May have additional short squeeze in coming weeks."
"Seven Hundred People out of work will not make you any money, it will buy you some time and thats all it will do. They did this ten years ago and it did not work, and it will not work now. I feel sorry for people running companies that have no idear what to do, they are just running on dumb luck. Jim."
"Someone dumped 500000 shares at $37,, they made a lot of $$$"
Do you notice how my post was deleted.Wall Streets and Harley can't handle the truth.This report is very bad news and thats why Institutions hold basically 100% of this company.Harley could be fixed almost at an overnight pace and yet the company chooses to ignore the solution.The new M8 is turning out to be a major failure.
"dealerships are empty, factory working 7 days a week call your local dealer and see how many names are in the list for the new pan america bike just unveiled, sales gonna skyrocket"
buy up suckers!!

Anyone know whats news made HOG jump up this morning or is this a death rattle ?
"Harley Reports 2Q Loss As Retail Motorcycle Sales Drop 27% GloballyHarley-Davidson Co. said retail motorcycle sales fell by more than a quarter in the three months ended June 28, reflecting how consumers pulled back on spending as the coronavirus spread earlier this year.Harley on Tuesday said consumers purchased about 52,700 motorcycles globally in the second quarter, down from 71,800 the year earlier. Sales fell 27% in the U.S., the company's largest single market, 30% in the region including Europe and the Middle East, and 10% across Asia.At the end of the quarter, about 93% of Harley dealers around the world had their stores open, following interruptions earlier this year caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said.Overall, revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 53% from the year earlier to $669.3 million in the second quarter. Analysts predicted $761 million for the period, according to FactSet.Milwaukee-based Harley reported a loss of $92.2 million, or 60 cents a share, down from a profit of $195.6 million, or $1.23 a share, the year earlier.Excluding restructuring expenses and after other adjustments, Harley said its loss for the quarter was 35 cents, weaker than forecasts from analysts.Harley in July said it would cut roughly 700 jobs around the world, or about 13% of its global workforce. The company has said those reductions were part of its broader overhaul plan.Even before the coronavirus created new challenges for Harley, the company had been pursuing efforts to reach younger and more diverse customers and develop new products to kick start stronger growth.The company said its turnaround plan had resulted in $250 million in cash savings, excluding restructuring charges, at the end of the second quarter.Harley also said on Tuesday that it isn't providing a forecast due to the uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic."
My guess is that HOG is due for a pullback in the short-run. This is so frustrating trying to find trade ideas. I've subscribed to some email newsletters which helps me with new stock ideas. a.awesomestocks is the one i like best.
Doing good... need the dividend up tho
Dead money!
Harley-Davidson reached a 52 Week high at 39.04
"Wow, nicely up.Time to short?It only gets worse from here.HOG reported earnings per share of 45 cents in first-quarter 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. The bottom line, however, declined from the prior-year quarter’s 80 cents per share. Total revenues from Motorcycle and Related products, which form the bulk of overall revenues, declined 8% year over year to $1099.8 million in the reported quarter."
The great thing is this will end the terror of Donald Trump....one of the great disasters of our time. Boolean
WTH HOG is selling E bicycle?It’s same version of The Marlboro man smoke E cigarette . lol I’ll cover my shares under 31.
Will cover tomorrow at $35.00... I love  this game
Harley riders are now traitors to America....they need to start riding public transit.
This HOG pig    is stating to come down boys and girls. Sell sell sell before you lose your gains.
Harley-Davidson is down 5.04% to 26.40
Money are pouring into EV and EB . Don’t short Stay out of the way for now .
Folks if this quarter was bad I can just imagine next quarter !! The new smart CEO will reduce production to increase demand on a falling iconic brand. Lol  I don’t think that is the right approach at all !!
This increase now at the end of the day is short covering not buying due to improving fundamentals !! HOG will go down tomorrow substantially.
The only thing holding the stock up is the company buy back.
Due to the Dotards comments I’m buying a new hog....
"All you big time traders out there, you should drop this zero and find yourself a hero. This stock will be a couple dollars soon."
what did you all expect its down 50% on rona .and not so bad earnings.this is there season starting real americans love HOG
HOG will hit below 10.
"Will cover my HOG short position at $34.00 today or in a few days. From $32.75 to $37.30 in a about 6 trading days before earnings without any good news. It’s going to be the typical sell on the news today and lock in profits. I say the shorts will prevail, it won’t be till mid 2020 that any big progress will be made. HOG will be dead money until they show growth in sales again. The $30,000 electric motorcycle will not sell good here in the states or international... its to expensive and you can not compare it to a nice FatBoy gas bike. Good luck today shorts and don’t panic cover early in the day, this thing will tank soon."
"A lot of options here, all well under 30khttps://www.indianmotorcycle.com/en-us/motorcycles/"
"I saw the upgrade today on Harley Davidson, so I took a look. There is no reason to buy this stock other than an upgrade by a bag holder of this stock. Good thing Harley records a sale when they force dealerships to take delivery of a bike. That is the only way they can record sales of an electric bike that no real Harley Davidson purist would ever ride."
HOG will not come back until employment comes back strong and that will be at least 1 year at best. IDK what is going on with the recent crazy movement. I figure its insider buy but insiders are not always correct. Support will die as it has at the end of every day this week.
"I tried to tell you people about 2 years ago this was coming. It will likely get worse. HD new counter balance system is a joke, its worse than the B-motors.There's a very simple way to solve HD heat/milage problem. All internal combustion motors can be improved dramatically (over-night). Management simply needs to listen to the people who know what they are doing (thinking outside the box so to speak of).HD is forcing their product onto the dealers, bike are stacked up in the back. HD keeps a very aggressive set of books and it could hurt very bad."
"Trump got a few votes from HOG supporters during election, but HOG business got hurt now. The rest of stocks suffered even more. Which one is true?"
"Polaris sales are up, HOG sales are down. Same environment. Many dealers had record sales while people weren't working, so HOG just lost big market share, missed an opportunity and has nothing of interest for the younger generation. Bail."
"Yea, this market or this trade makes sense. Be very careful."
Great american company ! Winning! Harley Best MOTORCYCLE COMPANY ! HOG HOG HOG BUY BUY BUY
I wanna hear you guys squeal like a hog! LMFAO!
Give me $36.25 and I celebrate  my vacations soon !! Good thing I averaged on the way up. This HOG pig    is overpriced.
"How's that whole Trump-endorsed boycott thing going? Sold or scrapped all your bikes by now, you White House-visiting rebels? :)"
"Another insider SELLING---Insider Lawrence G. Hund sold 12,537 shares of Harley-Davidson stock in a transaction on Friday, August 5th. The shares were sold at an average price of $53.23, for a total value of $667,344.51----------------------------"
"A company that continues to have shrinking sales quarter after quarter and reduced it projected ridership target by 50% should not be trading higher. The electric bike at $30,000 was a sign of desperation and it will not work. Not even the Harley Davidson sales people at the stores like it. And that is a fact Jack !!"
Heard the new electric has a great rumble.
don't bet against an American Icon
Donald T duh prez is bashing the HOG again...loves the drop. Once again the voters for the DON are getting slapped. Way too funny ain't it. Boolean
"Well, HD's new 2019's are out, and once again Harley just choose not to listen to their customers.The paint scheme's bite big onesThe M-8's still having problemsThe big screen TV still on the dashboardThe air vent is so HONDAThe price, well lets not go thereThe gages are still shy of logicalDon't count on HD doing better this year."
wow looks like Trump was right about the HOG.....total waste.......game over for Harley. Had a nice history though but now it is outdated and outmoded and mostly a product of overseas...shhhhh don't open that door and blow the riders mirage. Boolean
I would buy a Triumph or an Indian any day over a Harley
As older Harley riders retire from riding the next generation of blue collar workers don’t make enough to buy a new Harley any more. This company and products will change in ways that no one can predict.
Debt will be the killer as Harley downsizes.
Hey Bill why no comment?
Yayyyy .... this Pig  is coming down to Papá. Folks I knew this can’t be happening!! The numbers were terrible. I did my physical homework and was told by several sales people that sales were very slow. So this coming quarter is going to be worse for HOG. Stay the course shorts we will win this battle.
alot of
Hey Milwaukee: 'Fess-up that you SCREWED the POOCH... and bring back ERIC BUELL.
thanks for the tariff's trump.
I see hardly any new harleys on road. many dealers in south were having fire sales. I just have a hard time believing these numbers. local dealer owner told me his numbers have been on slide last 5 years no sense to me.
"Ok just bought 2,500 shares of HOG at $34.95 !!"
how much will we bleed today
"and that new Harley motorcycle the Pan America let me tell you BMW and all the other off road Adventure bikes are so far ahead of this I'll be surprised if they sell 10 of them at $20,000 a piece that's ridiculous. Harley Riders won't even recognize this as a Harley and most of them are so stuck-up they only wave at other Harley Riders"
This is up b/c the market is up 300 pts. Not sure how earnings will be but it makes sense that these guys will be hurting and don't think guidance will be good if they give much at all.

Good income stock that is just a bit weaker in the fall.."
"Just finish reading up on the history of Harley - Davison. An incredible history !! For a company that was founded in 1903 and dominated the world in motorcycles  for many years. It’s said to see how top management has loaded up on so much debt. Harley has on its books over $8.2 billion in debt while it expects $3.2 billion in sales for 2020. Harley has a current market cap of Approx. $4 billion ... with sales dwindling and the new electric motorcycles not sell, it will take a miracle for Harley to stay out of bankruptcy. They need to really take control of all aspects of spending. It going to be an ugly earnings report, that’s why I am short 10,000 shares and possibly adding more this week. Yesterday I visited 5 Harley stores and what I experience was dead stores !!"
Game over for this overvalued HOG . I will cover around 39-40 or lower.
"didn't they file bankruptcy?$8.891B debt already$530M more from last quarter to the 12/31/18 quarter (last quarter reported here on yahoo finance0I really like the electric motorcycle thing, though. Maybe too expensive. There are a lot of electric motorcycles out there.Their finances look really bad to me. If you come out of bankruptcy and go that far in debt with such low sales dollars to start with, that ain't good."
Wait til market makers squeeze last of the Robinhood chasers when they realize they went too high off the jump... it may overdrop when it goes back to where it should have risen to - 33

"I spoke to owners of to dealerships, one in N.J. and one in PA., and both said their sales are way down due to covid-19. They also stated that no-one is interested in the Bronxs motorcycle. They feel it is not a mans bike, stated by many customers. Jim."

game changer news for hog
"Going to go DOWN, DOWN, down to Chapter 11. All you have to do is look at the prior recessions and what happened to HOG in each of those recessions. Just multiply it by a factor as this is even more severe a recession."
"Hello  my Harley Friends I just shorted this Pig    again at $29.25... (12,000 shares) thank you thank you for taking it from $24.50 to $29.30 in 4 short days. This will not hold... Especially for Harley Davidson stock which is a dying company. The Web Bush upgrade is bologna... they always do this before earnings and earnings suck anyway !! Shorts hold on to your positions because HOG will retrace back to $24 again."
"With HOG getting all these downgrades, we'll be lucky to stay in the green today"
All these people talking about the greatness of HOG. #$%$ pure and simple. We now have the savior at the helm??? Not one quarter of proof and now this stock is climbing because of what???? The sheeple will follow anything now.
"It just a matter of time. HOG is in decline and this is a designed squeeze. About to end, let’s see who has no chair when the music stops. Longs turn soon."
"Getting anything meaningful done at HD was always next to impossible. It was run by consensus and so just one idiot could hold up progress - and especially if it involved their sad, little sandbox."
"Folks I am doing my short position homework today. I personally visited the following HD Dealerships, asked questions and looked around. 1. Cocoa Beach Harley2. Space Coast Harley3. Treasure Coast Harley4. Palm Beach Harley5. Alligator Alley Harley6. Peterson’s Harley 7. Peterson’s Miami Beach Harley 8. Peterson’s Harley South All stores very slow and several salesman told things have been slow. So I really thing earnings report will not be good. It will tank on Tuesday !!"
"appears the large fundholders are colluding on their exit strategies here, in order to prevent massive sell offs and losses for the big funds. they are most likely organizing options postitions to mitigate losses through their combined exiting of HOG. funny to watch it trade with the knowledge of what is going on. slow run ups then sell offs . on down the line until they reach the exposure and agreed upon price."
no revenue + no balance sheet = fail
"Do people really still own this dog? Not only are they generally a terrible bike, their market share only has one way to go and it’s not up."

"These earnings will be some of the most horrible we have ever seen.They missed Q4 earmings and revenue by a lot. What do you think is left for an earnings that has at least 4 weeks of coronavirus in it, in a company that was struggling while everyone was going up.I expect a bit of a selloff after 3PM and tomorrow morning it will look like a massacre."

"Good idea, introduce new $40k cruiser to geezer market, this should really pop now!"
Got some Jun 23 $55 Calls before market closed. Im anticipating a 3-5 day run up and I'll close my position before $HOG starts to consolidate. We'll see...
may have found the bottom
"There's no new line up, it the same old product with the same old colors. Bad news!!!!"
"Harley Davidson's practice of calling a forced delivery on dealers as a SALE is bogus. No one will pay $30,000 for a bike with batteries. Their vision of customers is messed up and their sales accounting is shady financials. Thank goodness that this is an institutionally controlled stock. Hedge funds control the trade. The new crooked wall street."
You can tell how over priced these bikes are and the clothing from over seas they sell the AMERICAN MADE crowd....who don't realize how much of the bike parts are made...overseas.....kinda funny how the company has been able for years to psychologically manipulate the minds of all these people....just to BELONG....the pure basic need to be wanted.....they played you well. Boolean
"Lots of used HOGS for sale up here, why would you pay 3 times more for a new one?"
Five days til ERIt's like waiting for Christmas!
"Why didnt HD just suspend the dividend?Eight cents seems like more trouble than its worth,especially when theyre in a cash crunch.Would it really have affected the share price that much?Yield is less than one third of a percent."
I do not see this trade war ending any time soon. Other nations are totally dependent on money from tariffs. The USA just brought in over a billion dollars in steel and aluminum tariffs alone in a month. Our government needs the money to save health care and social security. Tariffs are not only here to stay but more are coming.
"Bike sales down from the US to the far eastShipments, parts & accessories, merchandise, revenue, incomes, margins down across the board.Financing up, due to un-affordability, this is a sign of desperation.Buying shares back to help fudge the EPS.It's all bad across the board. Is this a strong economy or a rigged economy?"
"This makesno sense, I expected the big initial drop we saw earlier followed by a slow tailing down, not up! Any theories on what has buyers interested in this dog?"
"Beautiful just covered my HOG position, not to bas for one day !! Thank you thank you."
Is there still a dividend?
Hog MAY open in he 30's Thursday after TRUMP !Ever Hog owner is a PROUD TRUMP SUPPORTER !Harley selling out he REPUBLICAN PARTY !
this hog will have not so great earnings but do your history research Everytime they report bad price jumps they report average price dropshog 35 end of next week
"Huge orders coming in, and they are all BUY!"
HOG is up 5.09% to 36.56
The stock just got beat up on CNBC. Why is it going up?
Harley is doing the right thing. Their mistake was in announcing it.
Feels like a top here. Back down to $15 now.
Up almost 10% in four days.
This stock always comes back. The million dollar question is where is the bottom.I am waiting to see it whats your prediction
"6 Recalls Are Way Too CommonRecalls are a way of life in the auto industry. Yet it's appalling just how many Harley-Davidson has fallen into in the last few years. In 2018, nearly 239,000 bikes had to be recalled over a clutch defect, which cost the company $35 million.In 2019, production of the Street had to be stopped when 44,000 were recalled over faulty braking. Why would customers be interested in a bike that has a chance of breaking down on them and having to be returned? That the recalls have increased over the last several years shows this is not a minor problem."
"Bad news and articles today and the HOG pops up. Looks like being played for short squeeze. No doubt the company is going downhill from dominating the market (like Schwinn, Rubbermaid, etc.) What happens if this goes private? Stock will go up?"
"Harley-Davidson factory cancels Trump visit, fearing protests over travel ban.And here all along I though WI stood for cheese and morons. Looks like they actually have residing there some folk with class/brains. Poster reads: NO TRUMPSTERS ALLOWED. Hail to that brothers and sisters."

Don’t commit new money  at these high levels... you are playing Russian Rullet. Lol 
"I just can't see anyone spending $30,000 for an electric motorcycle."
Give me a $38.00 today... come to papá  !!! The big boys are cashing in... who in their right mind is buying Harley-Davidson at these ridiculous high prices ???
Harley-Davidson is down 8.32% to 24.01
"Time to short this pig again, 30k for an electric motorcycleperhaps HD should hire a Marketing MBA, this makes no sense at all."
"Now that Honda has released the Rebel 1100, might be neat to see HD beef up their Street line with a budget 1200 model."
My guess is that Harley losses half or more of its market value!!!!
"It was older bikers who kept Harley going for this long, but we are getting old, the young don't want this brand, and the company is being run by non-bikers! No biker will ever buy an EV bike...especially for $30,000! We ride for the sound and we ride long distances! Harley will eventually die!"
HOG is going into single digit . The older generation are too weak to handle the giant bike and millennials aren’t interested in an expensive bike .Uber and lyft are their thing for transportation.
"Fellas, this baby is going to $100+. #$%$ your shorts!"
"The price target  is for a year, but yet all the little retailers jump on it nowadays and think the price target is for now. Lol  That why they are left holding the bag !!"
"This thing is going the way of Sears and Toys R Us. The whole bad@#4 image of someone riding on a motorcycle wasn't sold as much in the movies to this generation, haha."

Looks like reality is rearing its ugly head again for Harley. hope you took advantage of the 52 week highs of the next year that were the last two days. 50 here we come.
"I have seen no positive news/information from this company or new CEO.Be very careful, this guy looks like he's a cookie cutter who's going to go with the flow."
"HD has a cult following, and its name is used on many products. Clothing and motorcycle accessories. The problem is can it get the attention of the younger generation. It will survive. I am waiting for the share price to drop to $10 before I buy."
This is one ugly chart.
US GDP revised down to lackluster 2 percent rate in Q1So much winning under the dopey trump. LOL

"I find this unprofessional by Citi. They upgrade this stock with a price target of 33.00. What evidence do they offer other than a new CEO? Quarter after quarter they continue to see sales dropping and revenue and now this is the great turn around story. It's unethical for a Citi to recommend this. Citi, I want you to justify your recommendation. Please make a case for your recommendation. Otherwise you should be liable for misleading statements. People are buying this stock and when they loose money, what will you say then. Oh we didn't understand the depth of the issues and challenges HOG face! A new CEO doesn't change what has been in place for years. The market has changed and it will take years for his actions to take effect. Unbelievable that people are buying this now."

"When I was a young investor, HDI was one of my first individual stock purchases. at that time an experienced person said, ""bulls make money, bears make money and only pigs loose their shirts"". I should have sold a few years ago and really raked it in, but didn't because of capital gains. well I don't have as much of that to worry about and don't want to be too HOG-ish. I'm selling all HOG by the of the week. it's been a good ride, but time to ride off into the sunset on another investment"

Harley is being forced into a strategy of turning into a high end low volume electric and specialty bike company OR they could choose to make low end inexpensive smaller conventional bikes. My guess is in the end they’ll do both simultaneously.
I'm doing my part by buying a 21 flhc
"Wedbush analyst James Hardiman where are you??? No comments? Come on, you misled people by upgrading them. Why are you not defending your upgrade?“We have long been among the most vocal of Harley-Davidson’s critics, and yet through both direct action and unintended circumstance, we now find the combination of potential demand drivers and margin opportunities to be extremely compelling,” Hardiman wrote in a note to clients.So you upgraded HOG. We are wanting you to defend this upgrade? I guess throwing darts is the latest way to determine an upgrade or not!!!"
I told you unitard's not to bet against an American icon now pay the price$60 here we come

"Morgan Stanley drops Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) to an Underweight rating from Neutral on its view that shares are overvalued and it is too early to extrapolate ten years of results out of one quarter.""The market has turned bullish on the potential turnaround of Harley Davidson. While Q1 earnings were strong and management's strategy for 'profitable growth' appears to have resonated with investors, we believe the market is under-appreciating the secular challenges ahead,"" warns analyst Billy Kovanis.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3685009-harley-davidson-falls-after-morgan-stanley-warns-on-secular-challenges-in-downgrade"
FED doesn’t want market to go down.DOW components missed and guided lower yet they are still up .
"how can trumpers drive a ford series pickup , 50 % of the parts are foreign....how can trumpers eat the tomatoes and avacados and salads much of which comes from Mexico.and you want to pay $2000 for a trumpiphone 100% sourced in the USA rather than the current $800 or so, right?so how come you whined about the extra 50 cents papa john said health insurance for his employees would add to the cost of a slice of pizza?"
"When will loyers start to sue HOG for noise polution? It's their responsibility, and it kills many thousands yearly. It needs to be stopped."
"Hog is Downgraded from SELL to RUN---insiders sold this Q Hund sold 12,537 @ 53.23 $660,344- VP Jones sold 2517 @54.03 for $135,993"
"Do you really believe people want a $50,000.00 bike? Todays market action is just the beginning."
Obviously you do not like HOG Bill. So why do you spend so much time on their site unless you are hopelessly short on this stock. The fact that almost every post here has your name on it says a lot doesn't it NEW YORK STUCK?
"Livewire as a brand, I'm not sure how that will work out.If its not Harley as a brand, can Livewire command a premium?Livewire bikes are more than 30% over priced."

Owning a Harley is like herpes. You cant get rid of it without some damage. Ask any HD owner who bought a new bike and tried to resell it. Feel free to comment if you experienced different.
Liberals buying this up
They are going to get grilled on call tomorrow
People who buy motorcycles will actually admire HOG for selling this accessory with the bikes.
CNCK looks poised to move higher. start your research on it now. It has been creeping up and volume is buildings.
My poor Harley had been kidnapped by institutional shooters
"Nice EV bike. The price? Not so much. Really, Harley, you float a $37K EV bike? Really? Slice that price by half, at the least, and then you might garner some interest in younger buyers. Otherwise yours is a fail....they'll stay with what interests them most...like the latest smart phone, etc..Your price will just be relegated to over-priced transportation and nothing more..."
The kids aren't buying these. The boomers are croaking at the pace of 5000/day.Wheres the market?
People who buy Prius and Leaf are not the ones who buy Harleys..........An electric Harley ? Please.....do you even know your customers ?

For the first time in my entire life I am seriously considering voting straight ticket democrat. This man has to go.
"Sturgis Biker Rally A Threat to StateMany Wisconsin Harley riders attending event that will likely spread COVID-19.Wisconsin citizens and public health officials should be paying close attention to the massive motorcycle gathering now underway through August 16 in western South Dakota.Yes, that’s hundreds of miles to the west, but in COVID-19 terms just a sneeze away.https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2020/08/12/op-ed-sturgis-biker-rally-a-threat-to-state/"
"100 new models? No way that works. Folks will come in and to buy a bike, see so many models then have to go home and research be so confused that they don't buy. I know I sell Yamaha waverunners, They come in see all the models can't decide and don't buy. I then try and get them on the Kawasaki as they only make 2 models instead of 20."
mej- another trump half wit IMOHOG to $30
HOG is going to be a screamer higher and the shorts are going to squeal like little pigs. LOL
"Mgt finally got a clue and is leaving India. Keep going, there are many more places to cut costs. Just look at the bloated finance and HR depts at HQ."
HOG reached a new 52 Week Low at 40.90
stocks gonna soar this week mark my words
Only losers ride these old style obnoxious machines nowadays. That’s why company will go back to 5 bucks a share
"Ten years ago hog was a three dollar stock, these guys running this company are doing the same thing they did ten years ago, where do you think we are going today. DOWN. Jim."
"Numbers for Q1 were BAD and Q2 will be way worse. Companies credit rating was downgraded with negative outlook. Use common sense, this thing deserves to tank."
"Donald J. Trump@realDonaldTrump A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!HOG said the motorcycles built in Europe will be sold in Europe, not sent back here. And does this mean that all companies building stuff overseas to be sent here will be treated the same? Since when does the President have the power to tell individual companies how to do their business? Doesn’t sound very Republican to me. And what about him with his stuff made overseas? Why is that brushed aside?"
"The stage for Mr. Trump’s corporate mugging was his country club in Bedminster, N.J., where he likes to cheat at golf on the weekends. There, in what used to be horse country, rode in a group of so-called Bikers for Trump. The old white biker dudes were invited by Mr. Trump because it’s likely that none of the old white golfer dudes at his club ride hogs; they’re more Audi than Harley. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/opinion/trumps-tariffs-trade-harley-davidson.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region"
"How can Harley compete with the largest growth in the industry, that of Sport Adventure bikes. Think KTM or BMW GS model. Harley is way too outdated to compete going forward. They need to completely refresh their line up, but to do it would be a massive overhaul and upset their 60+ year old riders. This is a DOG"
"I knew this Pig    had to come to Papá. What a vacation I am having next year !! Nobody is buying the electric motorcycle , I mean no body !!"
pig gets slaughtered
"Holden sounds like a Gay guy,go ride your trike!!!"
"I listened and read the conference call from top to bottom... what a joke. “On a year-to-date basis, Harley-Davidson’s retail sales decline of 5.6% compares favorably to last years decline of 10.2%.” What a bull crapper this CEO is. Lol  sales continue to drop the last 5 years. Why HOG didn’t tumble ? Manipulation by Wall Street, but it will not last and it will retrace."
"I don't have a position in HOG but have been watching from the sidelines with a view to shorting, declining sales and changes of demographics, but one thing that may be the death knell for not only HD but all bike manufacturers is the rise of the autonomous car. You can't make an autonomous motorcycle, they can't share the same road if all other vehicles are autonomous and nobody will invest for the infrastructure to make 'motorcycle only' lanes countrywide.Add to this the hatred of the motorcycle by local, state and federal government and we may see the industry and lifestyle in it's death throes."
CEO just bought $1M of HOG stock:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/793952/000122520821001732/xslF345X03/doc4.xml
"this company has debt twice the size of its market cap. i wouldn't be a buyer here. this looks like a sinking ship. this company has an iconic brand, ..sad for America. some other company will scoop them up, but that will probably be after bankruptcy and the clearing of their debt ."
"Thought it was the industry, but its Harley:"
Today the Market will be down and HOG will break down to see the $38’s ... just watch and see. I should have shorted more in the high $40’s . This Pig    is coming down !!
"Harley has learned nothing from the last few years. Same ugly colors, same M8 failure. How the hell can anyone buy this stuff?Listen to you loyals ""NO MORE""."
"HD has closed many dealerships in the USA,many of them profitable. Instead of a family owned business it's just another corporation with no loyalty period! And they wonder why sales are down! Another sears in the making!"
2022 Indian lineup is going to crush Harley Davidson
Looks like the market is in for another trump rally today.. so much winning
"So here we are with Harley-Davidson stock rising 65% in less than 2 months. From a low of $22.56 on 9-25-2020 to a high of $37.17 on 11-20-2020. A whopping 65% increase in stock appreciation while the company’s sales continue to fall year over year, for 5 consecutive years. A debt load of approximately $9 billion, twice its yearly sales. Current sales estimate for 2020 are approximately $4.6 half of the total debt outstanding of the company. And a book value of only $11.70... management has destroyed this company. And now they are banking on overpriced electric bicycles , that is laughable. Just a few months ago the rumors of bankruptcy was circulating and now many analysts are pumping this thing after a 65% run. This is manipulation at its best. Well all I can tell you is that pretty soon all these people that have been making lots of money are gonna be pressing the trigger and cash out because this thing really has no more room to go up. Lock  in your profits cause this PIG    coming down hard next week. Every time this happens when it gets high enough they just dump it again . By the way I own a 2007 Harley-Davidson Sportster 1200, I keep clean and in excellent condition. Like my bike, but not the stock !! This is an overbought and overvalued stock. Don’t go by emotions... use your head."
I can barely get around in my car with all these idiots on the road and you want me to get on a bike??? Never again
cramer said he sees Harley Davidson going much higher from here the new ceo has saved the company up up and away folksnever bet against an American icon
"I'm one frustrated maga-Trump dude! I can't watch the NFL, I can't wear Nike's, and I had to sell my Hog!"
Harley-Davidson reached a 52 Week low at 21.01
is it going up or down today??
They squeezed the shorts on bad news by playing ping pong with the stock.It will drop 2-3 % today . IMO
BIG DUMP TOMORROW!
Go Trump! Are you folks in Wisconsin felling happy that you helped vote in Mr. Trump?
"A lot of misinformation. Harley is only shifting production to Europe for bikes that will be sold in Europe. It will not impact domestic sales; those bikes will still be manufactured in the USA. As for the boycott, Harley has probably the strongest brand identity in the world and Harley riders aren't going to switch to another brand just because Trump is unhappy with the company."
Well just shorted HOG at $26.41 thank you guys !! I think this PIG    has to come down. They are doing so bad they practically suspended their dividend. This quarter will be bad... who would buy a new bike I drink a pandemic ?? Harley is an iconic brand that is slowly dying as the old boys get older. The new kids have no loyalty at all and like buying the Chinese Rice Cookers. We will see Harley back at $14 - $15.
"Every time they try pushing it over $40 it does not hold, that means it will retrace back to the low $33’s in a few days. Especially if the market makes a small correction."
here comes the rally
"MORE TARIFFS COMING by DONALD - the boy who lost billions of daddy's money, pays no taxes, got out of the service for shin splits and of course money bags daddy and wait until you hear the rest of the story. Boolean"
"Any company building a product overseas is bad?Next we hear that using parts from overseas is bad, this is a really bad road to go down"
Good day yo have gone short at $29.88Cant believe this is much above $20it was a tough environment prior to CCP virus
Why is HOG is trading at a 52 week high? Is this based on PE buyout rumors because the fundamentals look horrible. Any thoughts?
I guess you guys didn't hear the news. Harley Davidson is working on a vaccine for Covid.
"Well now, with HD's new line up, colors, and pricing structure, it doesn't look like HD listened to their customer. Used bikes are going up in value. Anything without a TV screen will go up in value."
Money moving to HOG.
Where are the 2020's
They need to make bikes that appeal to black people. Lots and lots of shiny chrome and gold. Gaudy styling.
Hog has gone up to fast in the last two weeks. If you are up and making money on HOG sell now... earnings will disappoint and the stock will fall to $33 or less after earnings. It’s a no brainer !!
"Oh oh, the redditters are coming in. No other explanation for this dino going up right now when PII which just had stupendous earnings is now down. Hunker down and wait for them to blow over, not enough short to keep their attention long"
Good time to either short this stock or buy September puts.
"this will be in the teens next week, below $10 in 2021 and probably circling $0 in 2022"
Zeitz assumed the acting CEO role on Friday after the board and Levatich agreed that it was time for new leadership. Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) has seen its sales decline for the past 12 quarters
I don't recall Harley complaining about tariff (http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/02/business/us-raises-tariff-for-motorcycles.html) and the effects on the auto industry at the time.
"Harley-Davidson is in trouble. The company has seen 17 straight quarters of bad news, and the decline accelerates every quarter. It’s not a pretty picture for one of the most valuable and passionately followed brands in history. And while the causes for such a catastrophe are always complex, in Harley’s case, there’s a single fork in the road that exemplifies, if not explains, the death spiral that very well may be the end of the company.."
"Harley Davidson cannot sponsor motorcycle  racing... another big mistake !! Let the other companies shine & showoff in front of the racing community, while Harley-Davidson sits on the sidelines. This does not make sense:“Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) has a rich history in motorcycle racing that spans over 100 years, but amid falling sales and purposeful spending cuts, it has announced the company is no longer backing a racing team. It makes sense that Harley-Davidson would cut racing from its budget. After laying off hundreds of employees; withdrawing from numerous global markets, including India, one of the biggest in the world; and narrowing the selection of models it will build; financing a racing team is an extravagance”."
"I'm taking my 30% profit! I'll get back in at $15 If it ever goes back down, I'll wait patiently."
recovering
Keybanc downgraded HoG .
"See you on the moon, shorts. Zeitz and the motor co are going nowhere."
How does a stock go up when it’s sales have declined for 11 straight qtrs.
"this board is pretty quiet, even during ER season."
I don’t think many will be committing new money to HOG.
Harley's contain a lot of Chinese parts and tariffs will impact the bottom line on all units.
Harley-Davidson - worldwide motorcycle sales by region 2020https://www.statista.com/statistics/252220/worldwide-motorcycle-retail-sales-of-harley-davidson/

recovering tomorrow
"#8 Younger Buyers Aren't As Interested In Harleys""Generation gaps"" have been an issue with the auto industry for decades as what appeals in one time does not to another. In terms of Harley-Davidson bikes, their sales come from their core base of old-styled bikers who love a huge machine.The problem is that younger customers prefer a bike for regular everyday traveling and transport, not traveling across multiple states in the summer. Throw in the high costs and the weight, and Harley has failed to appeal to a younger demographic."
"Come to Papá... Lol . HOG going down to $36. Today’s big drop is the beginning, stock is heavily shorted."
"So let me get this straight - the Fed is propping up this stock via a wink from Pres Trump with printed money while us little guys are trying to make sense out of the rise in stock value over the last couple of days. Also, the acting CEO lays out plans to cut costs, etc via ""The Rewire"" and is in ""talks"" (just talks - not actually happened) to secure $1.3 billion (that's B as billions) causes the stock to jump 17% in one day is unbelievable. Also, this stock moves outside of the normal trading day so the ""little"" people always seem to lose out on these big up moves. Totally rigged. Then one sees these wild swings in the first 30 minutes that makes one dizzy as you don't know really which way it is going."
Do people buy Harley's? Why are u people long?
What do you call a Harley that doesn't have a puddle of oil under it?Empty.
an american icon sliding into the deep
"""and Mexico will pay for it """
A day to short big drop @ 1 today
"Any truth that AMF is buying Harley, and wasresponsible for the design of the M8?"
"Bike buyers could care less about EU tariffs. Investors care (big time!) that their ""made-in-USA"" mega- brand is now moving to Asia. Bonehead move shows lack of judgement/leadership at HOG. Bad company leadership = Bad stock."
30 k a the electric bicycle.lolThe younger millennials will gladly pay that for a Tesla.
This company would not able to survive newly imposed by EU 56% tariff. Combined with the demographic changes HD will go bankrupt eventually.
Maybe all of the unemployed folks will have plenty of time to ride their harleys...especially if the dont have to make any payments. BULLISH!
Does anybody know the real P/E ratio after new earnings?
"This Hog is dead. Please tell me who is going to buy motorcycles in the future? The Baby Boomersare getting too old to ride and many who are still working now find themselves jobless or furloughed. The Millennial generation was broke before Covid, but more importantly finds loud motorcycles to be extremely dangerous and undesiring. This generation has zero nostalgia for Harley and would rather ride an electric scooter. Someone, please tell me who is going to buy them in the future?"
I tend to think a large percentage of us of a hog riders buy them because they are American bikes...going overseas for production is not a smart move...im dumping this stock!
Covering a few shares below $48.50... and I'll short more if it heads up again.Love when this moves up without reason.
Come to Papá big Hog  ... Lol .All I need is a firm $35 and my vacations are paid for next year.
Hog got downgraded I’m out
Not any better from here
"seems like the new ceo is trying to make harley a luxary brand, thing is that is not what it's demographic is. this might juice profits for a while with the cost cutting but it will alienate those that buy harley, cutting back from countries operated in will also raise the 10b in debt they already have. new lock downs coming, shops going to shut and people out of work, don't see this stock continuing to stay at these elevated levels"
Having some flash backs of when I was shorting HOG and not making many friends on this board. But there was several good Harley Davidson fans out there.....Franko. you still around?
"I have never seen such a low volume day on Harley-Davidson... Wow  unbelievably slow. A true sign that it’s lost all the steam going up. I has hit the top, from here it goes down down down. This iconic company’s sales continue to slow down and now they’re counting on electric bicycles to make up for it, this is really unbelievable !!"
Their main customer base is 60 to 80 years old now. The young are too busy with college debt andtrying to buy a house. Not a great scenario.
Is this going to get high enough to short again?
Bad news and stock goes down. More Bad news and the stock takes off. I guess two negatives make a positive. I dont think an electric cycle would save this. Huge used inventory and forcing dealers to take on bikes is just a recipe for disaster.
Lucky me made a great call yesterday!!
"the mood is definitely UP, and 2 large insider buys are confirmed."
Great earnings!
"In order to fully participate in the HD boycott, you must first get rid of your TV, computer, cell phone, stereo, car, clothing, and all other household items. Then you will be a free, proud American. (Whose ancestors came here from somewhere else.)"
Looks like a buy around 40
Bouncy days. -8% at earnings and recovered 8% in the same day. Day after back to the shadow.
Yeahhhhh baby
Better shorts some more HOG is starting to go higher LOL
I opened a short position @ 43.05 for 3 k shares.
Looks like we might see HOG at $37’s today. For sure by next Friday at $34.
"The company said it's aiming to expand to 4 million total riders in the U.S. and to grow international business to 50% of motorcycle revenue, launch 100 new high impact motorcycles and to do it profitably and sustainably. After watching the Livewire fiasco, I think thats somewhat delusional."
Bring this pig back to 40 so I can short and cover at 35. Rinse and repeat
"so the CEO screws over customers by limiting supply and charging more money, and they get rewarded"
Buy HOG (Harley Davidson). Down 50% from recent highs. What do they say in golfing terms: “form is temporary but class is permanent”.
I heard today that Baird and Co is going to lower their rating on Harley to Sell because of lowering sales and tariff issues? My understanding is that this stock is going to be lowered to $35.00 a share. Anyone else hear of this? Earnings are falling fast and material and productions costs are up?
"This could literally go back to $20 again...wow, unreal they posted such a big loss when automakers are booming."
Just because a stock goes up doesn't mean there's rationality behind it. Look at CAR
The end of Harley?
Jim Cramer is not a buyer of Harley.
"much! is owning HOG, and TLRY..smoke on a harley"
I do not remember correctly but was not speculation last year of HOG being in negotiations of being acquired?
sell the pops!! going down down down. going down down down.
if they think electric bike are the way of the future none of them ride their products. short the the ground of this is the case.
"U.S.Steel CEO said steel tariffs would only add one cent to an aluminum can and $700 to an auto. Harley says $2,200 increase also because steel prices have gone up. They still want to buy Chinese Steel I guess."
If you are up on Harley-Davidson you better sell now before it tanks !! Sales have been in the decline since 2014 and the new young men are not into the Harley’s. Only the older dying generation buys the bikes . This is company will end up going private when the stock goes to $8 to $10 dollars. Sell and move on before you lose all your investment in Harley-Davidson.
"Exactly how does a deal with China ((if we get one) Maybe)) get Americans to buy more Harleys they don't want? $50,000 for a bike?Where she stops nobody knows. Be very careful, you can get burn real soon."
Has anyone actually gone through HOG's filings with a fine tooth comb? HOG is known for playing accounting tricks.
I want Harley's electric motorcycle
"hahaha I love it, You fools keep on betting against an American icon and you lose lose lose while Harley is going to gain gain game just got another upgrade up up and away"
Trump-loving Harley riders are now traitors to America....they need to start taking public transit.
made no moneygave out $253M in dividendsdo they do buybacks?check the debtthey probably have to hold it up or get debt downgrades
"There's a lot of competition out there now and the younger generation wants sport bikes andcafe racers not HDs. They are looking at Triumphs and Moto Guzzi, retro Japanese bikes andBMWs. That is if they have the extra money."
If you were long HOG and you are not cashing in your gains  you are Loco . I can guarantee you it will be down you.
Rising interest will kill their subprime loans .Repo market is upside down liquidity will freeze up again .HOG will not able to service their high debt . IMO
Trade the Harley in on a BIRD scooter... Man that is where the gig is.... People wore all that Harley garb trying to look cool as most of us looked at them like...wow... Way too funny... They took the Harley bait hook line and sinker and maybe even the boat. Boolean
"Harleys new line of bikes will be a costly mistake, bigger than the V-Rod. You see where that went."
US durable goods fell again and market keep moving up .FED kept pump more $ to keep the Casino going. Lol
Hog will crash down to low/high teen . IMO
Maybe Harley could make a riding lawnmower with the...Potato Potato sound?
"American company you all keep saying 40k bikes I can tell your not a biker and have no clue that is there top price bike. have you looked at a ducati or a ,BMW or full loaded kawasaki or yamaha? they have alot of people that beleive in  company."
Polaris is doing better symbol PII
I reloaded my short position at 50. It’s now way overpriced .
Reload my short position 37.7
HOG is up 8.93% to 16.71
Real bikers Ride harleys ..all the #$%$ bike riders get older and buy HD FACT
The country is going electric. Check out Acrimoto fun vehicles. Ticker symbol FUV which is flying today. They just bought a plant five times larger than the one they own now. The company is just getting started. The future is here.
Harley Davidson can always sell their bikes to Home Depot. Harley's vibrate so much that they're great for mixing stain and house paint.
"Detroit automakers are evaluating how they might pivot to making medical-grade respirators or ventilator. Why hasn't HOG, which has been on life support for years, found a way to make a contribution to this global pandemic? Wake up!"
"Well, the facts are in:Harley product sales down all around, some seriously down. Increase in Rev (and I'm surprised) shows you they are raping their customers (I'm one of them, future purchase will not happen).New products are not being well received and just too expensive for an economy on life support (and make no mistake-this economy is in very serious trouble).Harley loyal's have or are walking away, not to return if HOG doesn't start listening to its customers.The large tax base suddenly hitting a lot of companies tell me they have been pushing back reality to help cook the books for back qtrs., making the last 6-8 years look better than they really were.Most of Harley's problems are very easy to fix, wall street greed needs to be removed. Look at Institutional owners, they are holding this thing up, the public isn't buying it."
What a wild ride today (pun intended). Just wish I would have picked up more but I bought LMND instead on the pullback. Either way this stock is headed for $32 short term. Don’t believe me just watch!
WOW! Could this be anymore rigged. Who are the market markets on this stock??
Since Harley is now building their tooling in China I have no use for them.
Mid-life crisis stock.
"HD is a luxury item. People do not buy HD bikes bc they need a mode of transportation. With this new generation not even buying cars or getting drivers licenses, I am hoping that HD can get things rolling otherwise they will suffer the fate of Oldsmobile. I dont think even an electric bike can do much to impact sales. Far too easy for other companies to enter the e cycle race."
This company will be like Sears in a few years. The half-life of HOG is about up.
"Any Trump Stains here? Look what you elected, dummies."
"Personally, I am still blown away that people voted for this guy. He is, by a large margin, the most divisive President we've had in my generation."
I WANNA AUTOMATIC!!!!!! My ankles and legs hurt too much!
"over priced bikes,plenty of clean used bikes for sale,baby boomers are getting older,Indian bikes sales are increasing.poor economy, stock market is in a bubble about to bust.NOT looking GOOD"
have you scene the option #$%$ get ready for the boom? gonna be raining???
40% increase on the price target? Laughable.
"First mistake, exiting the USA to use cheaper foreign labor. Second mistake building an ugly electric bike that costs more than what a excellent new car costs !"
Show of thumbs - who thinks this will go red by end of day?
"It isnt just COVID, Harley has had problems for awhile:2019."
"Overpriced product, full of Chinese garbage parts. BFD"
HOG is down 4.93% to 37.00
wow - being managed nicely. But can they get out quietly in Q3/4. Watching this one.....
"Not the best environment for HOG right now. Their bikes cost as much, if not more than a new car and the younger generation isn't even buying cars, because most of them are broke. The ones that aren't broke don't like cars or bikes and they probably work a 9-5 corporate job in tech. They only spend money on Uber, iced coffee, vegan fake burgers and 1$ phone cases China that they throw away after a week.That being said it's probably a good time to buy, but you'd be catching a falling knife. Might buy, but I want to see some sort of innovation or the current downfall of the auto & bike industry turning around. So far there's no signs it's recovering. Maybe in 2021."
"Here we go... just shorted 10,000 shares of Harley Davidson at $27.50.... thank you so much !! Now let this Pig    roll over and hit $25 again."
"Well deserved, horrible management culture of aged tree-huggers who only care about keeping their jobs."
"With this stock price don't miss your lifetime opportunity to sell it, three years high today."
So who will pick this up?PolarisBMWBajajHondaHow much is a name and spare parts worth?
Wait till someone writes and article about how loaded the dealers are and how HD forces bikes on them. I don't think the bottom is in yet
how much will we bleed today?
Time to buy is now.
no way buying a 45x P/E stock in this sector
"never bet against an American iconThe dealerships are screaming for motorcycles, call your local dealers or look online new motorcycles are actually selling for more than MSRPtime zone back 1999 waiting list to get new Harleys I'm going to ride this baby out"
Great chance to get short
Harley-Davidson is up 11.67% to 21.15
What a disaster
Harley kicking #$%$ today!!!!!
"HOG is going the way of the dinosaurs. Admit it and bail out. No millennial wants a loud obnoxious ""look at me"" motorbike."
The Harley image is antithetical to millennials.
"HOG investors are screwed! Trump started a trade war, now Europe announced they were going to impose tariffs on Harleys. You can thank your president for that; most Harley owners are die hard Trump supporters. Good luck!"
"While they're enforcing the emission regulations on hogs, they should also enforce the laws related to noise. Hog riders would not be able to attract as much attention (which they obviously crave), but maybe they could make up for that with added costuming??"
Why doesn't HD build bikes people want to buy?
Oversold... school of fish investors...
Their financing service is loaded with with Subprime Debt that won’t end well for Hog .We’ll see pps in the low teen soon then single by 2021 . . IMO
Harley-Davidson is up 12.14% to 24.47
Huge miss down to 22 again
18% short interest as of yesterdayhttps://fintel.io/ss/us/hog
"I no longer ride because of distracted drivers using cell phones and texting, that may be the reason for lower motorcycles sales in the US."
Good entry point ?
THE entire market is down . First thing people are doing with stim check =down payment on a new Hog
Can't buy a Victory motorcycle but you sure can buy a Harley Davidson!!!
secured 350mil credit (06/02/20) facility / will draw 150 mil.
"If them moving is so good, WHY does the PPS keep going down?"
Whoever is watching this reaction... this is the time to short it big at $39.50 !!!
"Trash stock, debt almost equal to market cap. Dying brand, ridiculous ratios."
up almost 5% ? huh ?
The Harley Davidson Motor Company should SUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION!! What he is doing is illegal! Sooooo glad I did not vote for this divisive CLOWN!
What is the current tariff rate for Harleys going into the U.K. and the rest of Europe? I would like to see the actual tariff rates of all of Americas export. It seems that a trade war has already been started.
damn I sold on the open this #$%$ gonna be green by eod
Stock will go up more.
HOG reached a 52 Week low at 24.01
"The more they sensor this [these] boards, the more desperate they are getting."
You guys are going to get killed buying this stock. Its will take three years to turn this company around if we get out of this Covea-19 mess soon. Jim.
"Phew!!!! Good thing Harley Davidson records the sale when they force dealerships to take delivery of bikes they can not sell. Otherwise the sales miss would have been much larger. As for the posted income figure, the market and the SEC is permitting creative accountants to post what ever number they dream up to keep the stock going to all time highs despite lower and declining numbers dressed up to look like good numbers. Did they also announce that HOG is now a tech company starting their own streaming service? That seem to also be the hype trend."
"This company needs a lifeline of some sort, soon. Otherwise they are not far from BK. fair SP under $10 IMHO"
Somebody musta poked the shorts with a stick!!!!
"Harley Davidson died the day that Governor Scott Walker told the world that he's the ""Harley Man"". What a freakin' dork. What a freak. Harley would have been better off hiring Pee Wee Herman than Walker to sell their bikes."
Millenials don't like motorcycles; they can't text and take selfies on them!
It's not just a Harley problem but mass inflation and gross devaluation of the dollar is ahead. Prices of all assets will have to drop dramatically or everything stops.The moment approaches.
more clueless harley talk on here look up east coast sturgis 1000s of harleys brandnew there new riders
HOG was removed from S&P 500. This will go lower when index funds and ETFs rebalance in July. DON'T BE A HOG!!! SELL!!!
"Something smells rotten in Denmark, or Milwaukee in this case.Numbers 30% higher than HD estimated 2 months ago? Huge loss and product flops last quarter and opposite one quarter later? Hmmm?"
I am selling half of my position in HOG---getting worried
Pure straight fraud.Disgustingand they'll bury or erase this message
"Think I'll pass on this. Way too high for the downside potential imho.. I'll revisit when prices become more realistic with the times. I am sure there will be Tons of used bikes & repos for sale. Call it the lost generation or dead money heaven, there are plenty of reasons for a serious Decline with this hog.."
The very low volume tells you people are scared and will not commit getting in at these high levels.
I added another 2K shares 39.5 Let’s rock NFLX is getting kill too .lol
"I know, I know, just double the price on everything. That'll raise the Rev's."
"how do you get $9 Billion in debt, grossing $1.9B in salesdang! out of controlhow can they pay off the debtmanipulated by the dividend payouts, but thats a long way out at this point, its only about a dollar per quarter"
go hog gobought at 15 c'mon 30 and beyond great new CEO zeitz
Screw the stock price! AMERICA FIRST!!!!!!!
"Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Sales Evaporate in Face of COVID-19 PandemicFirst-quarter motorcycle sales for Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) were as terrible as you'd expect, plunging 18% worldwide from the year-ago quarter and down more than 15% in the U.S. It doesn't bode well for Harley-Davidson's second quarter, which is typically its biggest sales period, and perhaps for several quarters to come. Harley-Davidson's revenue fell almost 6% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter while net income plunged 45% year over year to $69.7 million, or $0.45 per share, as the COVID-19 outbreak sapped sales globally.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/54bc84cb-a0b0-382d-be79-dddb298a8e98/harley-davidson-motorcycle.html"
Folks this thing has to come down... terrible metrics... they had lowered number so much so they can beat. Wake up folks there is nothing to like here. HOG is deteriorating has a company fast !!
I have never seen such a low volume day... something is about to happen soon. And most likely it’s going to crash if no new buyer come at this high price. HOG has an 11% short position. Will cover after earnings at around $33 - $33.50.
Look at the 5 year summary/chart. This company has been losing value since 2013. This has nothing/very little to do with Tariffs.
After buying the dip this might earn me a free Harley 
$HOG Initiates Coverage On Bank of America Buy USD 55Initiated by D.A. Davidson Buy USD 55
"I now respect Harley motorcycle owners more than I do myopic Harley shareholders. When you have a man, with a spine, fighting for US jobs, and trying to keep Americans employed, and trying to keep 50 billion a month from leaving the country, you either have to be ignorant, or a globalist who only wants to exploit workers worldwide. Remember, when enough money and jobs leave, we will become socialist and Harley will become nationalized, and your investment will be good for wiping your rear end."
"Look on Craigslist, there's an endless supply of these things that people sell after a year or two."
Harley is dead money for the next three years.
For those of you that think debt doesn't matterHOG debt now 10.222BGoing up quickly!https://finbox.com/NYSE:HOG
read Motley Fools article that came out right afer the #$%$ earnings report
Amazing this is up again. Shorting here at $40and hoping it goes even higher.
"The only reason Institutions can't run, nobody to run towards."
Oh look! It’s going back up. Just like no one claimed it would.. :p
All Harley riders are now traitors to America and the American worker.
"WOW. Just a blatant analyst pump and dump before earnings. Heavy bikes are not selling right now. Everyone that wants one bought it last year. And the electric bike will be a failure at it's outrageous price point. Come one, really? Do you hear anyone talking about that bike??? No one. The only thing that saves Harley is that they record the sale when the FORCE their dealerships to take delivery of a bike they can not sell. Harley is way over priced here and the new target price is a total joke."
Rather stick with iron mountain
"Thoughts on the Pan America?Harley killed a lot of designs but went forward with this one.Perhaps because it was nearly ready for production.Pan America faces a tough market, with BMW and KLM being very well established,but it does sound like Harley did a decent job with this one. Not sure how I feel about liquid cooled though?"
Less than two hours left and HOG has not traded 1 million shares ?? Actually not even 500 hundred thousand ?? No one will to buy at these high levels. The crash is coming after earnings
Harley - one of a kind product - no worries
"Hog has been on life support for last couple of years. Old guys that are HOG customers are dying off, no younger customer coming in the door. Their bikes really haven't been updated in years. They won't sell in europe, india or anywhere else they try to build them. Basically their bikes, clothing and everything HOG is dying and the company is headed for bankruptcy again. Has nothing to do with tariffs. Has to do with product mainly, and kids on cell phones not getting out and wanting to ride!"
HOG has been selling used bikes for as long as I can remember. What a farce!
"So once again, emotional traders have taken the market. Really Almost 18 for this stock. I want someone on this board to justify the price. This company has been downgraded, it has stated that they are facing headwinds that cannot forecast this year and people are buying it!!! Is stupidity that big today that people just throw money at this company. Come on....let's hear it."
Will be under $35 after earnings call.
"And the idiots keep on buying this Hog. Please do so, when when next quarters failure comes out, I'll short it again."
$7 BILLION DEBT / BOOK VALUE LAUGHABLE $11 / REVENUE COLLAPSING = BRUTAL PONZI SCHEME BUBBLE HERE ..FAIR VALUE $13-14 AT BEST . Looks like heavy stock promotion in progress to attract Newbies so the banksters and board members can dumptheir brutally overpriced junk to them .
"Be careful,They are comparing this qtr (opening up qtr) against a shut down qtr. This is not apples to apples. All of 2021 will be compared to a shut down year. Compare this to 2019, 2018 qtrs. HD also uses aggressive accounting practices."
Q4 wholesale units down again. Watch this slide another 15-20% when the official announcement is released.
"never bet against an American icon , I'll get back in at $29.."
"they need to have the market cap at a certain level compared to debt to avoid a major downgrade in debtso, give away money as dividendsfinancials suck bad"
"Just look at the recent gains in electric auto manufacturers like TSLA, NIO, NKLA, etc. If speculative E-bike investing catches fire like speculative E-vehicle investing has, then look out to the upside because HOG may be going much higher. (portions of this market are not currently trading on fundamentals - imo)"
Folks based on dead options activity... I tell No Bullish sign at all before earnings !! Short this Pig    . I say $34 on Tuesday’s closing.
Harley is growig their debt in a BIG way
told u don't bet against an american icon
"H-D should be ok if they listen to their customers, young and old. I don't have much hope for the LiveWire at $30k. Wish they would bring back the V-Rod with a high output V4 to compete with the crazy fast Yamaha VMax."
Markets are stretched that’s why short interest is creeping up everyday and everywhere.
Morgan Stanley upgraded price from $30 to $32 and overweight. Analysts seem out of step.
"If you voted for trump, you deserve every bit of this beat down."
Trend is horrible.
"Good article today in Barrons about HARLEY-DAVIDSON.......stating it is at the end of the road due to it's customer base shrinking and younger consumers aren't much interested in its motorcycles, further stating trouble ahead for the stock!Read the article!!!"
Who the heck is going to buy their $29k electric bike? They are trying to connect with millennials? Not happening. Nice press but costly blunder in the making.
"Harley-Davidson will be bankrupt before Christmas, run the numbers boys and girls and you will see with clear eyes. Jim."
Short at 39.01Should be a lot lower after earnings.
"Harley Davidson is back on track selling motorcycles  like crazy and increasing production in all factories because the demand is incredible !! They have reduced their $8.2 billion debt by half last week. Folks this is the time to buy the stock cause everyone wants a Harley. Why do you think the stock went from $22.50 to $29.50 today, $7.00 a 31% increase in 10 or 11 trading days. I think with the awesome earnings it will jump to $45 like a crazy technology growth company. Lol  who the helm is drinking the cool aid ???"
So much winning!
Could this be dropping below 40?
"Bloodbath inbound, noone is buying overpriced American junk right now. Most of the people I know with HDs spend most of their time in the garage fixing their bikes.. lol!"
Only a couple more years to go of Trump screwing up country.
"Sideways, sideways ,sideways"
"HD is not just one of the strongest brands on planet earth, it is also the finest motorcycle producer in the world, period. Never bet against an American Icon. Numbers can be fixed, debt can be repaid. This isn't Tesla, you're not going to see killer gains, but you sure as hell are going to see a brighter future. Best looking ADV bike on the market? Check. Most aspirational motorcycle, possibly even vehicle brand? Check. Huge super-fan base? Check. The writing is on the wall. Dismissing these guys is like dismissing Mcdonalds."
Short this pig on Friday close...tomorrow !!
Good news guys lots of shorties on this forum desperately trying to spread their lies so looks like we are going much higher
Is the low corresponding to Dow decline for the past 3 days
Wait til their subprime loans get default and we will see low teen to single digit . IMO
I will buy when it hits 10.00
HOG is up 8.01% to 21.99
"wow, Harley...c'mon don't break your running streak! *then yelps bc Flippy tries to kill her*"
It's official. Added HOG to my LOSER list!
"So Morgan Stanley and The Market Watch. Where are you now you upgrade the stock and profited off of people. The so called experts that just manipulated this stock. This company is going no where you people actually bought it. Now they feel the pain of listening to these experts. I DON""T SEE ANY OF THEM DEFENDING TODAY THEIR UPGRADES!!! Come on, let's hear from you now."
"Baby Boomers have come and gone people. Who is left to buy these big hogs? Not the younger I can tell you that. They don't believe in John Wayne, wars nor loud pipes. They want sleek, fast machines. Ducati anyone?"
Short this stock!!!
BMW motorcycles as big as a Smart car will tread on Harley-Davidson's turfBMW's motorcycle-building division is thinking extra-big.

No way I am diving in this
Carrier and harley both are leaving while trump stands there in his trump brand made in china suit...
HOG reached a new 52 Week Low at $37.30
HD is climbing back up. You can't seem to see the more negative press the more it gors up. HD will have a big spring sales number.
Notice the headlines don’t mention the good news about distributors interested in selling the bikes. So misleading. Got to read past headlines or find news elsewhere!
"@at Booleansearcher. Wrong 100%. Every one, motor cyclists or not just dream about riding a Harley Davidson."
Harley Credit is doing bike loans for some pretty bad credit individuals. Gotta gets those bikes moving one way or the other.
"Harley want to expand into asia, adding shipping cost to asia to a already high bike will not be competitiveNOT LOOKING GOOD"
"If you believe in Trump you have to sell your stock, he has called for a boycott, then you need to sell your bike!!But maybe you don''t love Trump."
President Lawrence Hund just sold 8000 shares
Can someone explain to me why the 21% jump in stock price in only 4 short days for Harley Davidson ? From $24.21 to $29.31 = $5.10 a 21% percent jump with no news ??? It will retrace back to $24 and lower after earnings.
"If hog does not wake up and start selling a motorcycle that the working man can afford, hog will be gone in 5 years. I have several friends who want a hog but can not afford one. It is hard for them to fit the amount of money into there budget that hog is asking. A motorcycle is a toy to most people. A car is something they have to have."
Hog was reading at $22.61 on June 26th... no doubt it has trace to $23 soon before earnings !! And after earnings $18 - $19.
How is Lego connected to HOG?
"Just shorted another 1000 shares of hog at $37.20 I’m short 11,000 shares of hog. This thing will crash."
This is going to be really ugly when reality catches up to this stock.Debt is a killer.

I'll vote for Trump if it helps to kill Harley Davidson.
Think about this. Up until a year or so ago they were still manufacturing bikes with CD players. Need more be said?
HOG is up 4.95% to $33.49
hängeblibe wär hardley davidson kauft
HOG is a joke. $12 at best. On the way to bankruptcy. Massive debt and dwindling shares. Easiest short on the market.
HOG had 17 million shares shorted... and so far today only 3 million shares traded. I think HOG will continue to have a bigger short interest after investors digest how bad the and dressed up the 3rd quarter was. Hang in there shorts we will prevail.
Game over for HOG millennium don’t want these expensive bikes they prefer Tesla or any EV
"Hog wants to continue selling high priced, high margin bikes, and that's not going to work. They are going to have to downsize the company and work on lower priced and higher sales volume vehicles just to survive. They need to maybe look at other ways of using their manufacturing plants to pay the bills; use motorcycle engines to power things other than motorcycles."
"Wait.......So all the new stock millionaires are running out and buying heavy, loud, expensive motorcycles? Do you really believe that? Even the electric bike is almost as much as a low end Tesla. This stock is at a five year high based on new targets by institutional bag holders. Amazing how corrupt the market has become. % year high is a joke for a company selling heavy bikes to customers who are now too old to ride. No one under 55 wants to pay 30, 000 plus for a loud heavy bike."
I see where HD has pulled its factory support for drag racing and track racing.
"Boy, that was a flop of a launch of live wire.Should be called “strive higher”"
HOG needs to stay out of politics. Than big Biden sign at factory posted on internet not going to help them with sales.
Well it’s going up
"Big mistake to have bet against this, who would have thought with bad earnings this would go up? At least I only bought puts rather than went short."
"ok so anyone with a MBA or good fundemental business knowledge want to give the masses a heads up of what Harleys plan to come out with 50 new models means? anyone? ok ok, guess ill tell you. First off it means that they recognize the brand is tired, sales are dropping like a rock and basically a lot of negative factors rearing their heads. Now from a financial stand point this basically means much higher cap ex., lower profits, higher costs all around, re sourcing and re tooling of plants, marketing campains etc, and all depending on the fact that this hail mary works!! and basically a much lower stock price. thats all."
I reloaded my short 1500 shares at 35.
"Nothings changed.Great bikes, horrible financial headwinds.."
this stock is going to pop big tomorrow
h
takeover
looks like it will bo gokng up damn..
This company is for old men with self esteem issues.
This might be the first stock I ever short in my life! I think I’m the next year this will test the lows around $10
"GTFO! Can’t race, needing gov’t bailouts, & riding on nostalgia. Maybe we can live with a little more peace & quiet. Descent product - the people."
"What is wrong at HOG????Too many used bikes for sale in US now? Like 250,000 bikes?"
what's the breaking news did Harley come out with a new road glide matching underwear set?
Harley-Davidson stock is going up another $2 or $3 tomorrow also. Lol 
Why is nobody talking about the firing of Neil Grimmer? Why was he hired and what did he do to get fired?
"Harley invested millions in marketing to create an in-your-face tough-guy image that simply isn't connecting with younger riders. This decision was made years ago, aimed at attracting Baby Boomers who didn't see themselves as hippies, but it's left a lasting, dated impression of the brand in the minds of most Americans.."
"What is Harley supposed to do? Donald John Trump has instructed his base to stop buying Harley products. Donald John Trump is predicting, with robust language and enthusiasm, that Harley is going to go bankrupt.Why? Because Harley is transferring some more manufacturing resources to EXISTING overseas manufacturing plants.Why? Because Trump’s mega tariffs and retaliations overseas make Harley products non-competitive in overseas markets.Why? Because Harley has a binding responsibility to it’s shareholders and employees to stay in business, in all markets.Harley simply stud up to Trump by defying him. And Trump has gone public encouraging people in his base to stop buying from them, and expecting they’ll go out of business as a consequence.What other President of the United States of America has encouraged his core base to stop buying from an American landmark business just because they defied him, and are looking out for preserving their business? And he predicts they’ll learn their lesson and go out of business."
HOG is up 9.70% to 21.37
Apolitical? It started with its political bike match in DC.
Very Nice week for HARLEY DAVIDSON !with all the new x gen buying up the harley's at a discount . Been told at dealerz there is already a back log for paid custom bikes.
Please take a minute to view this w.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4s7L23D7g
I am thinking 32.00
"This company as well as others are owned by money managers who are churning to keep a gain on the books. If you are positive GET OUT NOW.Just look at the financials. They are scary, and to make things worse, the stealers can't get rid of them, the decline in parts & acc. tells me people aren't riding them. Not a good sign."
"Harley: A company that uses the same engine to build 199 different ""models"". All Harley does is change a color, then claim they have created a ""new model"". They are all made of the same ol' #$%$. They all vibrate. And they are all sold to old geezers suffering from profound hearing loss due to their removing all of the muffling...And so goes the HOG story...BORING."
Hog makes unique bikes with good pricing power. Buy
And the Parade of analysts continues !! More upgrades for Harley before earnings and conference call ?? Do these analysts have inside information ?? How could so many firms and analysts upgrade on hopes of a new CEO cutting back on production and Closing stores ?? This really smells funny to me. I wonder if they all loaded up before they teamed up to upgrade... which by the way is illegal !!
CFRA downgraded vs upgraded by Northcoast research .Them S. o. B want to pump or dump ? lol
"Robin, are you guys passing around the crack pipe, nothing will save Harley. Jim."
SLOW BLEED for this HOG
"Well now, lets see: https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/about-us/hd-news/2018/harley-davidson-announces-third-quarter-results.htmlU.S. sales dropped 13.3% OUCHHD has done a very good job of ruining its customer base. Loyals are going away.World Wide sales dropped 7.8% OOCHyAs the bikes become more complicated these sales will most likely go down more.Motorcycles forced on the Stealerships up 16.8%This is the killer, the stealers can't sell them but HD forces their lame product on them and they can't do a thing about it. In turn the stealers have to fined more ways of ripping off the customers, AND THEY DO.Parts & General Merch. all downIt's shows you the loyal customers are not happy with the overpriced products. Bikes are problematic, the shirts S*ck big dogs-very expensive too. $18 for an oil filter, Al Capone was a better guy.Rev's & Income up slightlyIt shows you that HD is pricing their way to an end, and it's coming."
"The hog is peaking out, volume down to 50% of average on positive day."
"those who sold when i said to at 55.00, your welcome =)"
How much of Harley is made from parts over seas? So good to see them flip off Twitter Trump - he is not paddling with any oars - even far right wing conservative Charlie Sykes of Wisconsin and George Will have been anti-Trump since day one and their voices are getting louder. And - they are right. Harley did the right thing. Boolean
CAT is another good short .they missed Earnings and lower guidance yet it’s up 1% .Look at their 3 months chart .
Trump personifies the ugly American which is reflective why HOG sales are down and will remain down. Working poor can't afford to buy a Harley and the rich prefers Bentleys.
and the perpetual bleed out begins until some good news
Wedbush is taking about next year... lol   . These Bozos are pumping the stock before earnings like they do every quarter !! They the stock crashes after earnings. This is Wall Street manipulation at its best... short this Pig    !!
we seems in our bottom as per the chart in past as well. What do you think?
Ok HOG can down from $40.89 to $40.03... tomorrow we see $38 or less !!
"Bought 1000 more shares of HOG today.Bought F, moving upward."
"Oil LeaksOil leaks are simply part of Harley Davidson ownership that you’ll have to overlook. There’s hardly any room to get a torque wrench on the drain plugs for proper maintenance on these bikes. Many riders wrap the drain plugs in Teflon tape to prevent, or shall we say, delay, the leaking process.You’ll need to buy a cheap (yet still, this is a pain to do) plastic piece to shove under the filter, to keep it in place during an oil change, or it will get sloppy. Fans and supporters of the Harley Davidson brand will insist that their bikes are not leaking oil at all - they are simply marking their territory!https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
How many will stay with Harley after what Trump Said ?
I'll ask the question. Why do you want to invest in this?
"Take a good look people, https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOG/holders?p=HOG , Institutions own this thing and thats not a good sign.If HD doesn't reduce its costs and improve on the quality it will be AMF-ing again."

Thank god this closed over 15 today.Hope I didnt end up with any shares as options expired.
Harley Davidson is going to be another foreign bike just fit it in between Honda and Yamaha...The Hog is Slaughtered..if you were wise you would dump your investment....going down..down..down
Bernard ask GE and Ford share holders that same question. Fundamentals and growth will make stock go up not other stocks.
HD is a dying breed . Their electric bicycle eh Motorcycle will not be able to compete.Their subprime loan will crush the balance sheet .It’s an easy short at 30 . IMO
sooo overbought it's comical
Surprise Loss. How funny.
5-yr hold and this stock earned -50% price appreciation. Absolutely amazing.
"Market should be up tomorrow, HOG will be over $30!"
"Thank you thank you !! Just shorted another 1,000 of HOG at $36.75 to bring my average up. HOG is a beautiful short at these levels."
the majority of nations don't want a HOG...that is not their style of bike. And as for American made...how many parts are from over seas...come on kids take a guess....and you will be wrong as you will under estimate it. Boolean
"Lower Volume on higher stock prices = Big Downturn coming !!Analysts- “Harley-Davidson Inc gained 2.52% in the last trading day (Friday, 10th Jul 2020), rising from $25.75 to $26.40 , and has now gained 4 days in a row. It will be exciting to see whether it manages to continue gaining or take a minor break for the next few days. During the day the stock fluctuated 3.84% from a day low at $25.55 to a day high of $26.53. The price has risen in 6 of the last 10 days and is up by 8.15% over the past 2 weeks. Volume fell in the last day by (-880.50) thousand shares and in total, 3 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $87.09 million.

They will need to cut dividends to survive. IMO
"The market has gone up so much it’s scary !!! I again sold everything and will hold to see what happens. The market has to come down soon. Meanwhile I shorted 10,000 shares of (HOG) Harley Davidson... it’s gone up so much and nobody is buy motorcycles now."
"Over 550k shares sold within 15 minutes after market, what does this tell you?"
young are buying used older buying new
pump action fake quick 10k lol sold at 35 will be back to 32 before end of day..

"HOG, use to be. Now it's made in China."
"HOG seeking to become a global brand by accessing local world markets. Its partnership with China will win friends all across the globe and keep America great to spite Trump. Good to see HOG spitting in Trump's face for raising their costs w/ tariffs. Hopefully global sales will offset the additional costs via tariffs paid by American riders to keep prices affordable for Americans. Bikes manufactured and sold outside of the U.S. are exempt from US tariffs, but the profits need to be returned to the US to make HOG strong."
Short Squeeze has begun!
crazy pumping
"you read an article about HOG and they talk about $24M here and therethats so small potatoes compared to other companies on Wall Streetandthey earned no money (maybe lost money)in this great economyrecalls, so what, other recalls may happensales falling like a rocknot good,"
Market is way overbought.All good news have been priced in with lower interest and job report what’s there to push it higher..trade talk hope .lol
Harley's unique selling proposition in Europe is the fact that it's made in america... without that they've got little on bmw's and honda's.

It looks like Institutions have dumped 10% of their holdings https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOG/holders?p=HOG .I'm surprised they found that many fools out there. Maybe yahoo isn't reporting things accurately.
Weak shorts are gone .They will dump on retailers.lol
Beautiful day to short this HOG and pickup a $1 or $2 within a few days.
looks like takeover
Bull Trap is happening right now with HOG. It will bleed into and after earnings.
this is so oversold

"""A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country – never!"" President Donald Trump tweeted. ""Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end."" 2018"
If it gets to $41.00 I will short more... this PIG    is coming down !!
"This is a great chance to short this,"
"I'm an avid motorcycle rider. Harley colors are the absolute worst! Orange, black, Dark Grey, Grey.......depressing. Fire your stylist...start there."
Company is nearly broke. Accounting methods are very doubtful.
"If you are serious about riding, buy a Ducati. I did."
HOG has been going up because shorts are piling on... soon it will breakdown.
They threw good money after bad $ by buying back shares .
"Harley-Davidson, the iconic American motorcycle company, is set to lay off hundreds of American workers at its Kansas City, Missouri factory while creating jobs in Thailand.After laying off nearly 200 American manufacturing workers last year, as Breitbart News reported, Harley-Davidson is expected to fully close its Kansas City manufacturing facility, leaving 800 workers out of work.Harley-Davidson executives say about 400 jobs will be sent to the corporation’s York, Pennsylvania manufacturing plant, but union workers allege their jobs are being sent overseas to Thailand.In remarks to USA Today, a manufacturing worker who’s been at Harley-Davidson for more than 20 years will lose his job at the Kansas City Harley-Davidson facility. He says his job is going to Bangkok, Thailand, where the corporation is expanding jobs.“Part of my job is being moved to York, but the other part is going to Bangkok,” manufacturing worker Richard Pence told USA Today.“I am being directly affected by a corporate decision that I had no say in,” Pence continued.Harley-Davidson, though, claims that while its laying off Americans and expanding jobs in Thailand, the two projects are “unrelated.”Harley-Davidson executives said in a statement: The plant under construction in Thailand is a separate and unrelated issue. Part of our long-term strategy is to grow our international business to 50 percent of our annual volume by 2027. The Thailand facility will allow us to be competitive and provide riders greater access to our brand and our products in an expanding global marketplace. Increasing production capacity in Asia is consistent with the company’s long-term strategy to focus on growth internationally. It is not intended to reduce U.S. manufacturing.Harley-Davidson famously opposed President Trump’s pro-American tariffs on steel and aluminum, saying the decision would hit their profits, as Breitbart News reported. Harley-Davidson, though, was protected by tariffs in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, when he raised tariffs on imported motorcycles. At the time, Harley-Davidson was “delighted” by the tariffs.In 2016, Harley-Davidson decided to contract the outsourcing firm Infosys, which is responsible for the displacement of hundreds of thousands of American workers who have had their jobs sent overseas. Breitbart News."
I covered and went long for a trade . Morning Gap filled
"This new CEO is putting a focus on EV Motorcycles, making the campaign's name ""The Hardwire"" and then buys $1,000,000+ of HOG's stock, sounds good to me. HOG's Return on Equity is only 6 right now but that's due to pandemic related problems (the 5-year average for return on equity is 25+%). The P/E and PEG ratio are only high because the earnings are currently in a slump due to Covid-19 warehouse closures. I also noticed in the last six months over 30 inside buys occurred versus 2 sales. Can Harley Davidson become cool again and gain popularity?"
Why did they make an e bike with a fake gas tank? They could have done something revolutionary with the design to define the look of e bikes and we get a fake gas tank? This company is hopeless.
going higher ..........I just sold at 40.50 so it will likely keep rising . Too far too fast I'm thinking so Im out
"#HOG We may have here an upside runner to watch. Buy rating: 7, target: 52.45, at 9trading."
"Has Trump called off the boycott, or is that still on?"
Reloaded
"I agree that Harley is likely to survive, but maybe as a much smaller company. Perhaps where it was 30 years ago when they were happy selling about 50,000 bikes a year which about a doubling from a decade earlier. I at am not sure how many of the commenters here are motorcyclists. I have been riding since 1972 and have bought three new Harleys, the most recent a 2017. I have also owned BMWs, Triumphs, Hondas, Ducatis, etc. Every motorcycle manufacturer has their strengths and weaknesses. Yes, there is a demographic problem, and I am a perfect example at 68, but there are people who want to do things that are out of the mainstream. Motorcycles, and specifically Harleys, became almost mainstream from the early 1990s until somewhere around the Great Recession. Call it 2006 or 2007. The people buying new bikes today are riders for the most part and the folks who bought bikes as Butt Jewelry are mostly gone. Long story short, the only thing that could kill Harley is poor decisions at the top (think MV Agusta) and a huge increase in bad loans on bikes that are under water. Harley Davidson has been around since 1903 (or 1904 according to some folks) and my guess is that they will make it to 2103 in one form or another. And NO I don't work for Harley or a dealer and I don't own the stock. I just love bikes."
how many bikes are being sold? how many are being build?
So company buying back 15 millions shares. Have they completed this repurchase? Just curious on why stock price is up even though dismal news. Anybody have any feelings on if good time to buy or sell?
They have been screwing their customers for years with outrageously overpriced junk. #$%$ company.
Bankruptcy soon lol
"Yahoo article this morning: “Did Trump’s tweet(s) impact HOG stock?” Well, duh! What other President in modern times has encouraged his base to boycott a company’s products in retaliation for going against him and his tariffs — just to stay competitive overseas? And Trump has threatened to impose tremendous taxes on Harley if they actually transfer a portion of their manufacturing overseas to stay competitive as a consequence of his tariffs? And Trump has publicly predicted that Harley will soon be out of business when his loyal base follows through. What other President has had such a vendetta against a manufacturing company that is simply exercising it’s fiduciary responsibility to safeguard the interests of its employees and shareholders? And all Harley wants to do is remain competitive in overseas markets as a direct consequence of Trump’s tariffs — that don’t seem to be working, as predicted, with a cost consequence on U.S. citizens who are paying more for imported products?"
"Good luck HOG ,You betray your stock holders Hilarious , headed to $ 25 in 2018 ! "
Overweight old folks driving a motorcycle dressed in Halloween garb type wear is not really appealing any more. Harley used the age old selling tactic of telling you to LIVE THE LIFESTYLE and BELONG....basic low level psychological winners.....you were had and now the ride is over. And besides...The Donald says it is over......way too funny. Once again The Donald hits the same people who voted for him. Boolean

Total Debt (mrq) 7.47BWhy so high?Do they finance vehicles?
Harleys I am afraid are going away along with vintage cars . This younger generation does not care about what us older dud's did . Harley may sell a couple of electric bike but will not be near enough to save them . It breaks my heart to have to admit these facts. I really want Harley to live forever .
recalls means a quality problem in generalwhat about everything else?
Looks like UBS is pulling the old pump-and-dump to get rid of their stake. No one in their right mind would be bullish on HOG. Forget corona virus. Millennials hate Harleys.
Earnings will be positive
I would fear for my life if I rode a Harley into Sturgis and if you think this will be ok with Harley riders you are unaware how patriotic and devoted they are to the USA. iT'S NOT OK AND IT WON'T HELP AMERICAN WORKERS. Fire whomever made this decision otherwise this will be a great short.
Finally getting some volume. Longs getting out. Look for big volume after hours. Then rug gets pulled out to open.
"Any strong views on where the stock goes? Setup looks reasonably strong after resetting expectations lower recently. Financial Services business worth a little more than $1bn, and for a company that does $600-700mn yr in free cash flow, the stocks trades at a reasonably attractive multiple of FCF after stripping out HDFS. I assume they will meet / beat expectations after lowering the hurdle last week with poor guidance. Any strong thoughts here? Setup and valuation look nice here. What am I missing minus the demographic issues (everyone knows about this so assuming it is already factored in)?"
Tomorrow we see HOG pig    at $35.00.
Maybe HD will have an Autonomous bike up its muffler. They thought the big screen TV needed t be bigger.
OK I'm in ....A part owner of the Harley business. Yup electric bicycles. Its huge and getting much bigger. New management is stepping up their game and the brand is iconic. I expect to hold the shares until Elon Musk buys in or partners up . Batteries are the key and improvements are stacking up on each other. CATL already make a million mile battery for cars. bicycles ....take them camping in the new vacation close to home world.
"Yahoo showing 50 pe..for what.....a high growth company? Been shorting Harley for years...Bad loans, bad ideas, front running, failed stock buy backs to prop stock...pension plan debt along with other debt. Only way now is a massive downsize..."
"Harley Davidson lost a generation of riders with millennials. They have no interest in motorcycles, and couldn't afford a Harley if they did. Harley will be gone in a decade if they don't radically change their product line. I had hope with the CEO's record of turning around Puma, but I lost faith a half dozen earnings reports like today's."
I would imagine that not too many people are buying $40k motorcycles right now.
Effective jun 1st EU putting a 56% tariff on harley's
HD is working on E- Bicycle price range $2500/5000. Competitors sold for $ 800-1500 .Would the public buy one in that price range?
"If you ride a Harley, you are a traitor to America (according to Trump and his supporters).ROFLMAO!"
Small time shorts were covering... that’s what brought the price up. Silly Willy . Stick to your guns boys and girls this pig is coming down.
Hi my name is Kevin McCuck and I am greatly looking forward to the Harley Davidson livewire motorcycle. My husband and I can both ride Harleys now that they don't pollute or make noise. I am also buying shares today I sea $80 in the next few months.
Their high debt will crush the PPS with market correction. Low to mid 20 are coming.

WellsFargo sees Harley Davidson overprice and says weakness will continue.
That trend reversal today was crazy. With all the negative results and down market I would have expected this stock to drop to $24-25 range. What happened today was totally unexpected and not justified.
"I have been trying to sell my 2015 ultra low for over a year and a half. I couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t sell. Not even one phone call. Then I researched how many Harley’s for sale in the country the number was 50,000 used motorcycles. The markets flooded. It’s a buyers market."
Funny how idiots think calling someone names somehow changes the deteriorating fundamentals of this company

Which company do you think is hated more: Nike or Harley? Nike for Colin Butmunch and Harley for being loud and obnoxious to neighbors all across the world.
"What is so good about this:Analysts words... “Sales of the company’s big-engine bikes have fallen for five years, so recently-appointed chief executive Jochen Zeitz is cutting nearly 12% of Harley’s workforce and thinning the number of units sitting on dealers’ sales floors.Spak believes that U.S. shipments could drop nearly 50% in this year’s second half, leading to ugly sales numbers. Most dealers won’t get any more units this year.Other analysts haven’t yet accounted for this production cut, says Spak, and still forecast shipments at twice the level he expects. Spak predicts that Harley’s 2020 revenue could fall by a third, to $3.06 billion, with a loss of 12 cents a share.“This tells you Harley is doing very bad. Where is the good news ?? This stock is going down and down."
Pathetic anti-American Trump trying to destroy another Great American company. This won't be the last.
"3 They're Too ExpensiveThis has been a critical problem for Harley-Davidson for years and one they often refuse to see. Compared to other bikes on the market, Harleys are ridiculously expensive. True, they can back it up with the quality, but they also are far more costly than bikes of the same level at a lower price.It's created a bizarre contrast as suddenly, Harleys are out of the price range of the very people they're marketed for. Thus, Harley can't even sell to their core customers which is another reason sales have been declining rapidly."
No problem
I covered and will reload on next pop .
Wishing for a simple downgrade and this HOG    will fall like a rock !!

Harley is going up. Open roads without traffic. Harley is an American icon brand. People retired and can afford as well as safely travel on motorcycles. Go to the Harley websites they are out of inventory compared to before.
"I get a kick out of HD trying to blame this on the President, HD has been outsourcing more and more with every passing year. The bike are over priced, the quality is getting AMFy again.And HD will not listen to its customers, fixing HD is very simply but how do you make them listen?"

Everyone Enjoy Your Summer And get a VINTAGE Harley Davidson because that has and will grow in Tangible Value."
Anyone worried with the fact that HD inventory is starting to stock pile and growing. The dividend is great but my concerns are that it is just a decoy at what is to follow around the corner. Iconic brand that is making great strides to reach the younger generation while loyal buyers aging and dying off.

I love it markets down and hog is up just wait fellas $40 or higher by end of year something big is coming...
"Rebound from the pandemic, just a temporary bounce. Nobody is buying those electric bikes. They don't have that Harley sound. The HD demographics (over 55 years old) are very limited. HD finance is a real loser as they finance anyone, and have huge defaults. Going to be a great short.DucatiSteve"
This would be a high risk long position....i would short to sub 18
"The fat people who bought Harley's are now just going to sit on the couch and eat and not ride as there is no where to go....Harley is dead - young people don't want it and old people are OLD and toast. The scam of Harley making you feel so esteemed and brilliant for riding a HOG and working your basic psychological weakness to be needed and part of group was brilliant and worked on the old folks but now it is DONE. OVER. Finished. The ""We are Harley People"" is now just a sad sad ending to a saga about human weakness and the need to be wanted and part of a group.... Boolean"
Sometimes I wonder who are the people buying at these high levels ??? Before earnings that will not be good.
markets down and hogs upI told you people don't bet against an American icon $40 end of the year maybe sooner and you can take that to the bank
HOG is down 6.31% to 32.64
Take this brief moment of strength to short more or buy puts. HOG will die soon. Chalk another business failure up to failure to adapt.
"4 Lighter Bikes Are Now All The RageThe push of Harley bikes has always been their size. They're known for those vast engines, powerful pipes, and being able to handle large riders. But times have changed, and lighter bikes are the current fancy of motorcyclists. Harleys are just too large and often unwieldy to handle (especially in a city).Many riders have difficulty with these bikes as the larger weight can affect their driving. Sales show how customers prefer smaller and lighter bikes, which means Harleys are no longer as popular"
1. This is an old age company -- it has lost its core consumer. 2. Motorcycles are even more dangerous than ever - you don't see as many on the road for that reason. 3. Going to E-bikes proves that #1 and 2 are correct and won't save this sinking ship. 4. The Harley is an outdated bike -- not cool any more and never really was except for the old core consumer who made it appear so....I never road a Harley as you could see it was a company playing on the basic human need to be wanted and be part of a group who accepts you....so sad. They basically told stock owners that in their reports. SELL THE STOCK...move on. Boolean

This is a good opportunity to get rid of BIGOT fan base of Harley. May be it can be rebranded for everyone else. Bigots had kind of occupied this brand on and off preventing sales to other regular folks.

"I think the reason for HOG to be down was the excessive used bike inventory. Does anyone have an insight whether HOG has worked it through? If so, the standard pricing is back in, which is what the market is waiting for. Given the activity in the last several days, I am thinking that these guys are talking to some analysts.

His (totally correct) response was that only an idiot pays taxes that they don't have to. HOG is doing exactly that.Moving on..."

Been holding this stock for a long time nothing like a Harley I love hearing the roar of a fresh Harley pulling off the lot I remember when I got my first bike i pinned it out of the lot with the tires smoking one of the best moments in my life this is why I’m loyal to this brand because the feeling I get from pinning it on my hog is a feeling that not many will know about unless they buy a Harley

HD culture is all about rough and tough and cool dudes and gals jugging the vtwin, making a lot of noise. Also, I was looking at the charts to see just a few instances of sustained pop in the price, I could not find any. I want to buy some, but I am not sure. it does not make investment case, it doesn't make trading case. But I will watch"
HOG is down -100.00% to 0.00
"After seeing HD's new lineup, my EVO Softail just doubled in price.Sorry boys, no need to buy new for a while, if ever."
Shorted today at $49.88No reason for this to be moving up.
It's time to hop on this HOG. Great buying opportunity here.
HOG is looking like a very good short at $26.25... something to consider!!

Why is the COO leaving?
The volume has dried up since 11:30
I reloaded my short at 36.45 and will cover under 34 whenever trade talk bs failed again . Lol
Bernard is an odd name for an in-bread Russian troll mefinks

They brought out the pump again ...upgraded with TG PPS $55 . Lol

Take a look for yourself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSyvgMdD1U the new line up stinks big piggy. Down right scary to think someone would buy these.
Harley-Davidson is up 12.82% to 22.18
"Their main customer base is rapidly touching 70 yrs old, zero growth, LOL."
"Donald had quite an effect on the price of HOG today! What a doofus. They already have numerous plants throughout the world. He could not pass Economics 101, unbelievable."
Dope Brand. Dope Stock. Super trend with 17-25 yr olds. Harley single stitch vintage shirts alone go for $100 each
"Trading now at 72X (TTM)! This is no Tesla, so I'd be very cautious at this evaluation! Lots of debt. Especially with all the uncertainty coming in the next few days..... JMO."

One of the easiest shorts out there. This is a $14 stock at best.

"Stock Trader: I got lucky when buying HOG stock in mid-April 2020. Didn't expect to be up 50% in 3 months. Agree with some of your statements about HOG debt and state of their business, however the market feels otherwise. Maybe it would make sense to purchase some August $30 calls as cheap insurance for all the shares you shorted? HOG was approx $35-$40 per share pre-covid. With layoffs and a renewed focus, Wall Street could take this stock much higher (especially with the significant amount of institutional ownership).Good luck to all!"
"new e- harley bicyclesserial 1 looks pretty damned awesome, millineals will love it"
I covered at 24.0 and will reload on next spike.Easy money playing the channel 24 - 25.5 .
back to 54 today
Harley-Davidson is up 8.01% to 21.99
Already making money ... folks listen to stock trader !! Harley had a loss of $0.60 vs a profit of $0.08. The pumper analyst were just playing with you since Harley had a big short position. So they used Harley to squeeze the weak shorts and make money. This is ilegal manipulation and should be reported to the SEC. I am ridding this PIG    all the way to $22 - $23. Said to say but Harley is really in trouble.
How long has Harley been in decline?What was its high point?I'm guessing a high point around 2001?
sellers were losers today the 3 new desighned bikes with water coolin and modern desighn will reboot harley.
When the virus is behind and lockdown states come back the economy and Hog will rebound. Look for a Trump win to prime the pump. There’s a pent up demand for fun.....
It’s looking very good for the shorts tomorrow. Worldwide markets futures very low. This HOG    will see $33 tomorrow.
Decades of ripping of customers on ridiculously high priced accessories is finally catching up. This stock has lost half its value in 3 years. This is a pig stock and they deserve it. You can only raise prices so much until the consumer says f#@! it! Owner of a 2007 Streetglide. This will be my last Harley.
Has anything really changed for HOG?I think it continues its long downhill coast.Management has failed.
Ironic. This drama will hurt HOG.
Totally overpriced
"Questionable Lending HabitsHarley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) is not exactly known to scrutinize applicants requiring financial assistance for a Harley Davidson purchase. The newer the bike you’re interested in, the better they will be able to do for you. They’re much more lenient with bad credit scores and the application process as a whole when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers.It’s not uncommon to be approved for a stupendously long-term loan, in an obvious effort to further extend monthly payment plans and make purchasing a Harley Davidson more attainable for the average shopper. While we most certainly appreciate this boost, it’s definitely a bit sketchy. Of course, when you really want one of these spectacular bikes, it’s easy to turn a blind eye to this.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
Todays run up does not correspond with what going on in the economy. HOG or the market.
"Ouch, Harley's been falling hard... when'll we get back up?"
do a few spot check at local dealersthey are screaming for new bikes used inventory very low raising the price of used bikes a very good season for HD coming right up
There’s something funny going on with this stock. Yesterday it jumped .40 at 3:59pm. Then it adjusted. Now everything is dropping like crazy and this is just stuck at 5%. Hmmm.
"Do you believer me now? The accounting tricks can't cover up the downturn anymore. Management still not listening to its loyals.Nobody wants big screen TV's on a Harley, bike to expensive, colors eat dog dics. I could go on and on, but maybe now HD will LISTEN TO THEIR LOYALS.https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harley-davidson-announces-fourth-quarter-full-year-2018-results"
Bankruptcy coming
Hope HOG goes into bankruptcy. 
"sounds like Andrew lost his life savings what was it 2,000 on hog never bet against an American icon Harley has no debt they have been buying back millions of shares at a time it's company is rock solid"
ouch
HOG is down 5.58% to 23.87
"Would I buy HOG stock ? Not unless it is a big discount. I had thought about purchasing a sportster though. BUT, if I have to join a religious Harley circle no thanks. I grew out of that long ago and don`t care for that environment. If you want a real toy try trucking. Biking is too much of a drug culture."

nice bear trap
"Folks my instincts told me to short 3,000 shares at $40.00 on margin... crazy but true. It looks like I will make profit on my short position soon. Just have patience... the quarter year over year was terrible !!! This Pig    is coming down back to $34 just watch. Stay the course shorts we will prevail."
I now ride in a four door air conditioned car with air bags. Got to keep breathing and pay the bills.
"No Bullish option signal... so it’s going to drop hard after earnings for sure. Weak sales and electric bike a disaster, plus super expensive. Not a good sign."
"30k for their electric bike, is insane! why would anyone buy a 30k electric bike? and it's no longer made in USA. you'll spend more money charging it and limit your distance."
"Well now that the new line up is out. Take a close look people.Every year for the last 3 years Harley's line up has become more and more expensive. The bikes look uglier and uglier. The shear number of models alone is staggering, I don't understand that one.Unless Harley pulled a trick with the new 4 valve heads, people are going to find out dual valve on a low end motor don't work well."
"1 They're Cutting Down Big Time On ProductionGiven so many issues with factories shut down and the market itself unsteady, this should be no shock. The company has already laid off or furloughed much of its staff due to the factory shutdowns. Also, executives have seen a drastic cut in pay.Now, it's confirmed that when factories reopen, the production will be drastically slowed to the point 70% of dealers will not see any new motorcycles for the rest of the year. This means said dealerships will also be failing and hurting the bottom line. For a company already on the ropes, the current pandemic may be the knockout blow for Harley-Davidson."
"If you own HOG, you should have some stake in TSLA as well due to the companies electric vehicles."
They had planned to do this anyway in January. Sales are down in the US. Shouldn't come as a surprise. No longer an American ICON.
Hog ran out of steam . 34 is coming.
Waiting for 12
Take a look at the 5yr chart. Nothing has changed. Except somebody (the fed maybe) is pumping lots of money into this market. You should worry all. This company is toast unless it changes its product line.Nobody want big screen TV's on a motorcycle. Wait until those communication screens are no longer produced. HD is very good at stoping production on parts needed.
My first buy in at $36.05. Great expectations for a $10 rise in the medium term.
"They keep trying to bring it up... but it’s not working !! They are running out of money, LOL . No matter what they try it’s not going to work. $34 by next Friday."
If you are up... sell this thing before it goes to $30. A 26% moved up in one day is not sustainable at all. I wonder what investors think  sometimes. It’s freakin crazy !!
"Great day or what?Covered at $26.55( where I should have gone long, but it didnt occur to me at the time - especially since I was selling a lot of my long positions as I think we are headed for some problems shortly )and just replaced those and shorted again at $28.79Have a couple more orders in just in case it goes higher, but I think thats itfor today?The price movement on this stock makes no sense, but I love it!"
HARLEY FINANCE. for the Win
A $5000 bicycle is going to save this company?
"Will add more to my short position... even if they beat by a few cents it’s already baked in, in know this game well. From 33 to $36.70 in 4 days ?? It’s not going to hold after earnings."
The stock price has gone back up but the dividend hasn't moved?
I have an order for 2000 shares at 37 and 3000 at 38 .
"If you ride a Harley now, you hate American workers and are a traitor to the flag."
They are trying to hold this #$%$ up.

Sturgis is not good PR for HOG this year.

They’ll run the price up so they will not have to pay a stock to dividend bigger payment to stock holders then the price will plummet
"The bad attitudes at the stealers tells me things are going to be worse than the $0.09 the street is looking for.Institutions own this company, that means people don't https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOG/holders?p=HOGLook at past earnings verse expected https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings?from=2020-01-12&to=2020-01-18&day=2020-01-17&symbol=hogNo body wants big screen TV's on their bike. I think they call them communication centers. I ride a bike to un-communicate from this world."
They lowered guidance so low so they can beat yet cash burned more than 100 Million.I’m holding onto my short and might add more as the day goes by. Market will correct and it will take everything down before year end . IMO
The pumper analyst will push Harley to $34 before earnings. That is the middle of the $31 and $36 new analysts year target  which in today’s market is really a few days or weeks. A stock use to take 6 months to a year to hit the price target... nowadays is practically immediately. Well let’s see what happens after earnings.
It will be under 36 by Thursday or Friday. IMO
Reloaded !!!
Harley-Davidson reached a 52 Week high at 42.66
From $32.80 to $36.20 in three days... I don’t buy it
what's the resistance today? S & P is running out of steam
Don't bet against an American iconup up and away
stock market has green day HD goes down....better get used to it..
Who do see riding these things under 50 years of age. Me neither. Like hot rods and muscle cars it's slowly dying.
"5 The Image Is Hopelessly OutdatedFor decades, Harley-Davidson cultivated a unique image. They appealed to hard-core bikers, who loved a rebellious style and standing out from the pack. It helped create the biker culture as we know it. But in 2020, that image looks hopelessly outdated.An entire generation no longer feels that same ""rebellious"" attitude or enjoy riding these vast hogs. Harley-Davidson still tries to push an image that's decades in the past, and that's a key reason they're failing today.Less"
"I was wondering how Harley could survive with such a limited product line, and such an expensive one at that. But many years ago they also made smaller machines. Maybe it's time to revisit that. Today I see heaps of scooters and these electric bicycle things (which do have pedals but look a bit heavy to actually pedal very far) littering the sidewalks, so these are apparently selling quite well. I'm still a fan of the heavy iron, but I do want to see HD survive even if it means fewer big bikes and more smaller models."
$HOG Upgrades Robert W Baird Outperform USD 38 » USD 45
"I like bikes. I like Harley's and Indians. I've ridden both. That said these bike cost more than a new car. The fuel economy is at times worse than a fuel efficient car. They make no financial sense but bikes rarely do. If you ride you know what I mean.That said, the market place for bikes is changing - people are increasingly looking for value. For that reason think HD has painted themselves into a corner long term with expensive glitzy bikes. Changing up their bikes waters down their brand but their reluctance to change will be their eventually demise. Young people are about tiny homes, wanting less, new technology, and travelling. They are more discerning and savvy. Furthermore, generations are becoming less wealthy now.HD is about being cool. What is cool is changing and HD doesn't appear to adapt. Take a look at the live wire - sadly overpriced and underwhelming when compared to their competitors.From an investment POV this could very well be a good time to buy. But make sure you know your exit. There are tougher times ahead for this leather clad dinosaur."
They should be cutting jobs in their bloated finance and HR depts.
Very surprised that this is still trending up. Why are people buying this HOG? I have bank stocks that need help and this POS is going up.
"Beautiful short investment... folks when you see the analyst pumping a company that has nothing to show for it’s called illegal manipulation !! That is what has happened here with Harley Davidson, the analyst brought it from $22 to $29.95 in less than 17 trading days. Everyone liked and pumped Harley, but Harley has nothing good to show. HOG is coming down to $22 - $23 soon after earnings call. No more stock buybacks, practically no dividends and sales dropping like a rock. Hold the line Shorts this Pig    Is coming down !! Stock Trader knows his game !!"
One of the most shorted stocks in the market.
"Harley’s only hope long term is getting acquired.This brand (loud, ICE, older rebs) is going the way of the buggy whip"
thought it would drop back to $32 per share after the earnings report
Look at me look at me. My mommy and daddy never paid any attention to me but I'll force you to by removing the exhaust baffles on my hog.
To HOG shareholders Trump supporters will never buy another Harley. Your sales are capped forever 
"Under Obama foreigners loved this country and wanted to buy American, under Trump foreigners hate America and don't want to be seen owning anything so obviously American as a HOG."
Lot of shorties coming in. be careful

"of ALLLLL the various companies Ive invested in that released positive earning reports, this company gets the biggest jump in price? #$%$ im starting to think 99% of investors are #$%$ stupid. this is probably one of the dying industries due to the new generation not liking bikes and covid and yall gonna dump your money on them???"
"I'm an old timer. Never thought of the trill buying junk and having to work OT to pay for all that fun. Just me. Oh then there's all the tats to buy, leather ect. So what then some idiot runs a stop sign and ends it all. Hope you're wearing a helmet."

"HOG has gone from $22.50 on June 26th to today July 14th at $27.50 that is $5.00 bucks a 22% increase in only 9 trading days. This is insane for a company that is in deep trouble. Adding more to my short position before earnings, it will come down hard after the terrible earnings. Let’s see how smart the analyst are o this one ."
"UBS weighs in on the decision by Harley-Davidson (HOG +9.8%) to lower inventory in the dealer network by limiting production for the rest of this calendar year.""The inventory strategy that HOG just communicated to dealers could suggest that at Street's 19% retail declines, consensus shipments would have to go to down closer to - 26-30% in order to reach inventory targets. That 600-1,000bps of lower shipments could impact consensus EPS by 20-35 cents, or a 15-27% reduction in EPS,"" warns analyst Robin Farley."

The writing was on the wall years ago with HOG. Aging Baby Boomers and their fat wallets have gone away. To be replaced by whom? Kids with skimpy wallets. Not good for HD folks.

Why is there even an SEC anymore. Gordon Gecko acts with impunity. I hope this activity gets looked at when warren is in charge.
"Almost $2.00 off from today’s high... not a good sign, the possibility of turning red is real !! I think we had panic Little shorts covering at the open. Nothing has change with HOG... on the contrary all numbers were bad. Even after HOG buying back $112 million shares back they couldn’t make the bottom line year over year decline of 24%. I say $35 or less by next Friday !!"

Next leg down we’ll see under 36 .imo
"#10 They've Never Been As Popular OverseasMarketing a bike as being part of American culture can be useful for domestic appeal. The problem is that it's harder to sell outside of America. Harley-Davidson has never been as popular in Europe as many roads there aren't meant for those huge hogs. There are also cultural differences as Europeans prefer smaller motorcycles for quick drives and not a huge machine.To put it in perspective, Harley sales in Europe, Africa, and Asia combined are less than half of their sales in the U.S….and those numbers are dropping. The lack of international appeal is a massive blow against the company."
HOG reached a new 52 Week Low at $38.34
What was today all about.............???????????
"Interesting, HD restarts the FireWire. The issue didn't really exist, it was a one off issue. They halted a production line before they could figure that one out? Laughable, its sounds like the typical stealership No Problem Found to me.https://www.foxnews.com/auto/harley-davidson-restarts-livewire-production"
"This Pig    is going back to $22 - $23, just watch and see. And it could be in just a few days. HOG has gone up dispite all the challenges it’s facing. They cut the dividend, are loaded with debt, sales declining and burning cash like crazy. The new electric bike is a flop. Not good for Harley Davidson !!"
"SummaryThe stellar performance of Harley-Davidson in Q1-21 has helped the stock rally 15% and settle at 10% higher than pre-earnings.The market seems willing to push the stock up even further based on guidance provided for FY-21.However, there's a long way to go before the company can start posting $5+ billion in annual revenues again, which makes the stock expensive at the current price.That being said, if you take the long-term view, which I usually do, the company is still a long way from achieving the kind of annual revenues it was posting before the declines began to show. Even a stellar FY-21 will only be on a YoY comparative basis rather than a turnaround to historical highs. Sadly, for now, a HOLD is the only recommendation that makes sense to meBeulah Meriam K"
Harley needs to go private to escape the pressure from the market before they die and kill off an iconic American brand. nothing wrong with being a niche/boutique product that you can sell and run as you wish and answer to no shareholders
For those that think debt matters:Total Debt (mrq) 10.22BHarley needs to downsize faster before it digs a hole it cantclimb out of.

"Historically UnreliableVia Harley-DavidsonAfter spending a lot of money to own these expensive motorcycles, you can surely depend on them to be reliable motorcycles, right? Wrong. The Harley Davidson brand is synonymous with unreliability. The brand felt the hit from this reputation and needed the AMF revival back in the ’70s to stay alive.Reliability issues trace back to numerous mechanical issues and varying models, spanning over the lifespan of this brand. After being plagued with this issue for so long, it’s now commonplace to see a Harley on the side of the road and not think twice about it. Most would barely bat an eyelash when seeing a Harley Davidson on the side of the road – it’s to be expected.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"

"So you want to play games with PaPa ... just shorted another 4,000 on margin at $29.37. I am so sure this Pig  is going down that I have exercised my margin buying power to add to my short position. This one is a easy one."
Sick of prices getting elevated by “experts” raising guidance. These experts guidance are worthless. I’m putting my full load shorting HOG into earnings next week. The truth will come out on how horrible sales are (though watch for them to promise the moon in the future). Targeting 36 by end of next week and then a slow slide to 31 over the next month
Feels like the execs at HOG care more about politics than the fine history of a great American company.
Tarriff man hints he will retaliate against China for the coronavirus. H-D manufactures bikes in China. expect more pain when the Chinese specifically retaliate back tit-for-tat against US companies.
HOG is up 5.58% to 39.15
Horrible earnings and the SP soars...
"HOG makes most of its earnings from financial services side which will get crushed due to delinquency and payment deferrals. Q1 is a fraction of the disaster or Q2. Fact they kept paying dividend also stupid, they need all the cash they can get"
"Love the bikes, short the stock."
"It looks to me that I may be able to get back in at $15 while I wait patiently, but I'm afraid that it will go lower than that, so I will lower my point of entry at $12 while I put earplugs on, good luck and be safe to all!"
Harley Davidson’s is overvalued value this talk is coming down.
Harley only survival is to be bought out by the one and only Tesla!!!!! Come on Musk the world a better place!!!!
"It is NOT A TRADE WARIt IS a NEGOTIATION TO GT A BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICANSvous mousez la mâchoire,"
"Not the image Harley needs to sell scooters!No masks, no common sense.."
So over valued is this stock/company...I mean fat guys don't ride electric bikes and the fat guys are all getting too old to ride so this is just a get lean and leaner and leaner-yet to reduce costs and try to look viable. But...it is over for Harley...RIP. Boolean

Held this stock for years... and am finally able to exit with a small profit. (Wanted to hold but refused to get greedy after being let to leave with some green)
sell sell sell. Chinese company now
Numbers out !
"Harley Davidson has for a long time been a production artist. They build and hopefully sell what they want to build, not what millions of potential customers need and want. They should do similar to what they did with Buell, a sub company with a different name to sell the inexpensive, but reliable quality transportation the younger generation needs. Harley doesn't need to sully their bar & shield or antagonize their fat men who ride fatboys, but, they need to produce a more salable product and generate more revenue like all other companies."
"Any astute investor can see through the accounting shenanigans that produced these results. Look at the unit sales, especially international. That tells you all you need to know about a business that is going nowhere. Execs have truly lost the plot."
"Just take a look at Harley financials, please. https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harley-davidson-announces-second-quarter-2019-results"
Harley-Davidson is cutting 200 positions to adjust for its lower production. In July shipment guidance was cut by 5K bikes $HOG
"Covering on a few shares premarket.... just a few because it's going lower.Great bikes, but Harleys heyday isnot returning."
Microsoft is down premarket around (-$4.25) after great earnings !! Harley-Davidson will see $33 today for sure... yesterday we have a 13% of short covering. That’s why the stock went up so fast and so much. By Friday Harley-Davidson will be back at around $30 - $31. The electric bicycle  will not be able to complete with the current market. This PIG    Is coming hard fast !!
Scam company stay away!
"Their last ex-dividend date was May 29. theoretically they should go ex-dividend this week for the next quarter. However they have posted nothing to that effect, so we called investor relations department at Harley-Davidson to find out what is happening with the dividend and we were told that they did not know at this point either. They told us to stay tuned to see if the board was going to declare a dividend or not for this quarter. this is obviously very strange and concerning."
"5,000 bikes at $15,000 = 75,000,000. less in sales OUCH"
Hit fifty today. Anyone think it stays in the fifties?
It jumps 4% because Hund retired. lol Re short on this pop .
Curious what the consensus is.Thumbs up if you think HOG is headed upafter earnings report.Thumbs down if you think its headed lower.
HOG is down 9.28% to 18.29
"You should not expect good things from the earning report, forward looking statements-well I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.Harley has done well to lose its loyal customers and they are not likely to get them back.Over pricedUgly colorsConstant problemsetcetcetc"
"I just wanted to let the general public know that Stock Trader, and James and Jim are two differant people. I don`t know Stock Trader. PS, Al Bundy the shoe salesman will not turn Harley- Davidson around, he will be Fired before that happens, that is for sure.Jim."
So they will cannibalizes their own products by selling used bikes . Lol
"first support at $35but it really deserves to go back to where it was before the preearnings run up, around 33and that's just for starters"
Back to the drawing board ...
"HOG is moving some production, but the point is, HOG is in trouble, before the trade thing. Demand is dropping and motorcycles have reached top pricing, cutting demand into the future."
"Did you see the movie ""Get Out""? HOG should be the sequel."

"Declining SalesHarley Davidson sales are on the decline and have been for quite a few years. Consumer Reports has been reporting weak sales for this bike brand which date further back than 2011. The biggest issue that Harley Davidson faces in this category seems to be a generational one. Younger riders are not only finding it difficult to afford these bikes, but they are also not as inclined to buy into the status associated with Harley ownership in the way that generations before them had so seamlessly embraced.With that status adoration they had in the past, it was easy for Harley to charge a premium price for their motorcycles and get away with it. That’s not the case anymore.."
"To the HD EMPLOYEES: this will get fixed. However, hopefully you can now see through the con man you voted for."
HOG has had a big run on terrible news... watch the downgrades start coming in.
"I love this game... shorted an additional 5,000 shares at $26.65. I guarantee you that it will hit $23 after earnings!! Who the hell in their right mind is buying Harley at these high levels ?? Freakin insane."
It’s losing steam folks !!! Stay the course tomorrow HOG will drop hard.
told you folks never bet against an American icon hog long 55 eoy
Up with no volume hmm
Is this the end of the road for Harley Davidson in India?.
TODAY...shorts are running.
MM playing ping pong with the stock . There aren’t real buyers . Lol
"I shorted another 2,500 on margin at $40.15... Harley Davidson is the stock that I have shorted the most and made the most money. I understand how this stock works, folks this will reverse back to $35 possibly before this Friday, or next. This is completely overbought sales have not really picked up and this thing has gone up 70% in just a few weeks."
"heres how the stock market works. as long as your sales decline is less than what analysts expect, the stock will go up. doesn't matter that sales still declined. it doesn't matter if HOG lent out tons of money to people with subprime credit scores. it doesn't matter if this is the 13th quarter straight on declining sales. it doesn't matter if no one is buying $40k bikes that make up a bulk of its sales. only have to not be as bad as analysts expect and the price goes up."
Soon back up
up up and awaysorry shorts that must be a tough check to write I'm loving it told you don't bet against an American icon #fools
"Owner denied making statement, rejects the statement and says he has always welcomedall races to his dealership.Why is Harley dropping the dealership so quickly over a denied allegation?Is this what cancel culture is?."
There was a recent article in one of the magazines that I was reading that said about 10% to 15% of the Indian is foreign origin... about 20% for Victory... and 35% to 50% for HD's.
Eleven days until earnings! We'll get to see the plan that Harley hasto turn around years of decline?This should be interesting.
HOG is down -6.47% to 51.71
"You guys have just been ""MAGA'ed"". Sad."

Nothing has changed. Harley will continue the downward slide.Check stats and charts back to 2016
Its about to get ugly
Drug addled actor responsible for millions of fat people pretending to be Capt America finally kicks the bucket. Harley will now go banko.
"Most of those who comment here seem to be bearish on Harley Davidson. And based on the historic evolution of sales and demographic of current Harley owners, I would be too. But I think most of you dismiss to easily the impact of the value of the brand. It's still top of mind when you talk about a motorcycles. On top of that, Harley is ready for the future challenges (Electrification, cleaner watercooled engines etc.) Also the new Pan America model is very well received by the motorcycle press. Even in comparison with the top seller, the BMW GS 1250, it holds it's own. And at a reasonable price for that market. The livewire was great but overpriced for most clients. But the Pan America is priced for success. The new engine is also very well received and opens new possibility for more modern bikes. If you only focus on historic analyses, you are missing the drivers of a turnaround."
Someone wants their options to strike. I hope warren cleans this up!
If HD were to announce that they are developing an electric self driven motorcycle the stock price would double over night. Other companies who already market electric motorcycles are in a much better position to do so but none of them have the fame of HD. All of the technology already exists and there are a lot of HD lovers who are getting too old now to drive the way they once did. They would jump at the chance to get back on a motorcycle and leave the driving to IT.
Harley-Davidson is up 6.84% to 50.95

Been a rider for 40 years even if they offered ZERO financing on new bike they are still ugly and priced to high. Reminds me of the AMF day the vibe is real bad from corporate. FTW
"But I would really like Hog to go to 38, then I will add a ton of short positions"
"I listened and read the conference call from top to bottom... what a joke. “On a year-to-date basis, Harley-Davidson’s retail sales decline of 5.6% compares favorably to last years decline of 10.2%.” What a bull crapper this CEO is. Lol  sales continue to drop the last 5 years."
"These brokerage houses, 401k people, and analysts are setting up alot of people to really get hurt. This is not an investment, This is a real mess and will be for a long time to come.Jim."

Hello his one is an easy one folks. HOG will drop down today before closing at least $1.25 - $1.50 it’s always the same thing.

"What a coincidence! On Friday I buy to cover a month and half old, 1,000 share short position for a $6,783 loss and the stock drops like a rock two days later. The price kept climbing the day I shorted it for a month and a half, despite low demand/volatility, it climbed and climbed for a month and a half. MM rigs the price and doesn't allow us to sell stocks to each other. Rigged system. Eliminate the middle man and let buyers and sellers trade at prices we want to trade at. SEC needs to investigate."

"Here is another big disconnect on wall street , a company like ( HOG ) is trading below 12 X past earnings.than you have a company like (BYND ) is trading 1400 + past earnings and that is why I always say that wall puts a lot of air in all worn out tires, and it is the reason we are having these 1800,700, of down markets,on the way to below 20,000 for the (DOW ) BOOYAH"
"There must be a few hedged funds holding the bag on this terrible stock. If anyone believes that people are lining up to pay 30,000 for a noisy bike, you are being foolish. Iconic, historic, great come back story 25 years ago but not anymore. People on Social Security can not afford this bike and anyone under 40 has absolutely no interest in these heavy bikes. And if they think electric will sell, it will but not at the Harley Davidson price. People are no longer willing to pay super premium price just for an brand name that no one cares about anymore."
"I simply do not understand how HOG can be relevant in the Millennial market.

YOU looser haters need to move on you dont own a bike and are clueless about one of the greatest American company there is.
Would be nice to get an update regarding the electric motorcycles
"7 The LiveWire Was An Epic FlopIn desperation to join the new electric bike craze, Harley-Davidson released the LiveWire to major buzz. It was going to be the start of a new wave of bikes to bring Harley into the 21st century. Too bad no one wanted it. The critical problem was its hefty price tag when scores of other electric bikes sold for lower.The fact the LiveWire itself got poor reviews for how it handled hardly helped. The bike is already one of the biggest flops in the company's history as a Harley electric bike never seemed a good fit."
Blowhard Trump supporters are going to have to start driving electric scooters now.ROFLMAO!!
"Sell sell sell... before it goes back to $33, folks Harley-Davidson is super overpriced and overvalued !! Lock  in your gains because the next couple of days the markets need to rest, don’t be left alone holding the bag . It might close today at $35.50 or less."
News on stream hasn’t been good here lately. I don’t think HOG can hold these levels much longer.
HOG's debt on balance sheet exceeds their market cap. So what is a com;any whose ridership is in decline with more debt than equity actually worth? i'm afraid not much. better to buy Polaris {PII}. They reported today and it was solid. Including motorcycle category.
Short it on any pop to make money.
HOG has been Slaughtered wrapped and is now ready to buy. HOG going higher
HOG is down -4.93% to 48.33
Most political stock message board I've ever been on. Ya'll are a buncha lunatics.
There’s no volume it probably will close under 39 .imo

The Chosen Moron was making a fool of himself yesterday.Xi got him by the  with the bs trade .lol Up and down like a yo-yo.Let’s see if HOG will hit 37 again today .
Looks like a great short opportunity here.....
"2 They Missed Out On A Key Buying PeriodSpring is usually a top time for motorcycle purchasing. With winter ending, bikers are eager to get some new models for the coming summer riding and enjoying the great outdoors. Even in their last few years, Harley-Davidson still sold decently at that time.A motorcycle was low on the list of essentials for many due to the huge shutdowns in areas and the colossal loss of jobs. Thus, Harley-Davidson missed a critical buying period at a time when they can't afford to lose more customers."
HOG reached a new 52 Week Low at 39.72
Bad timing if we enter a recession.
Gonna be knocking on $60 soon!!!
"I applaud any move that will keep the costs of the company I invested in down. Here's to hoping that Harley's management sees the reaction from their hourly workers, cuts their dead weight, and outsources more of that work at cheaper rates.I'm here for the gain + dividend, not to prevent people from voting against their own best interests like Harley's workers did.Bring on the robots, HOG!!!!!! Let's trim the fat and increase my divy!!!!!"
HOG is up 4.90% to 39.38
"What am I missing here people, please help me out.HOG's financials show lower everything except for the finance division. People obviously won't or cant' buy these bike unless Harley takes the risk. If the people stop paying and they will, Harley takes back what they can't sell.Sounds both fishy and predatory"
Covered my ADP short position at a loss and considering to go heavy on HOG !! Why ?? Very simple they only have 155 million shares outstanding and they have a massive buy back program in place. They pay a good dividend and this time the street is looking for only $0.09 cents... they will definitely blow that number away. At $35 this can go back to $41 - $42 in a dime. Yes I am bullish !!
Very weak shorts covering . Stay the course shorts this Pig  will crash soon !!
With free money from the Fed HOG extremely easy manipulated on very low volume.
can't wait for ceo to explain this quarter. it was declining before the virus started. hog baggies will not enjoy this ride down.

"Orange Idiot can't make a ""deal"" to save his fat life!"
"Harley’s brand strategy in the ‘80s and ‘90s was to go all-in on Baby Boomers. It was as shrewd a choice as a brand had ever made: Boomers were a large, well-established segment with money to spend, proud of Harley’s American roots, and eager to hold on to their glory days. As Harley built on classic icons like Marlon Brando, it cashed in on suburban executives able to plunk down thirty or forty grand on a shiny new taste of rebellion.Then, in 2003, Harley bought Buell Motorcycles. Buells were a faster, rowdier type of bike that had been created by a young Harley engineer a decade prior. Buells didn’t look much like traditional Harleys, and they would have been unrecognizable to Marlon Brando. But they had the same spirit, updated for a new generation. Buell was the first bike of, among others, Walking Dead actor Norman Reedus, whose Gen-X take on rebellion sounded more like the Ramones and The Clash than The Beatles and The Stones.At first, it looked like Harley knew exactly what it was doing. The brand marketed Buells with smart, edgy ads that read exactly like Buells rode: a younger member of the Harley family with a new spin on the same heritage and values. Headlines like “It’s a fast, rude ride. But so is life,” screamed, “Harley is more than just your Dad’s bike.” Harley seemed to have concocted the perfect way to stay relevant as its cash-cow core began to age.But after just six years, Harley killed Buell. The move was ostensibly a reaction to its core demographic: Harley’s traditional audience didn’t like sharing its identity with the new kid on the block, and Harley chose to tie its brand to a product and a demographic rather than a spirit and an idea. There’s been nothing like Buell for almost two decades, and Harley has retreated to its comfortable and well-known lineup of classic V-twin bikes built for Boomers. But today, aging Boomers are buying fewer motorcycles, which is why the decision to end Buell coincides almost perfectly with the beginning of the decline that the giant still hasn’t been able to reverse."
It has topped out time to flush it down under 36

All I need is for HOG to hit $35 on Tuesday premarket and I will be sitting pretty. Will cover 50% at $35 and the other 50% at $34 later.
"From the CEO:?Share repurchase remain suspended, and today we announced the Q4 dividend of $0.02 per share, which is in line with Q2 and Q3.? That is a #$%$ dividend !!"
All you Harley Davidson enthusiast....buy.....buy.....buy!!!.....company is starting to think In a different direction...new models are coming out this year....Pan Am ...Bronx.....
Who’d you rather - HOG or PII?
Crazy to see HOG pricing follow PII almost identically in recent days. One is increasing sales and offering expanded product portfolio and the other is HOG
"Giant selling opportunity,company betting the ranch on electric motorcycles, marketing 101 this is not their brand at all"
"Perhaps the company could be smart enough to buy back stock after announcing earnings and crashing the price, instead of buying back stock from insiders at high prices?"
This company has raised prices for years for no reason except profit. Now they use the excuse of moving for the sake of consumers. Yeah right.
HOG is down 5.04% to 26.40
"Nothing will change Harley has lost many of the older generation, a 56% increase in share value while the company has a super high debt, decreasing sales, lowering production. That’s crazy!!""Harley was losing money pursuing those [growth] initiatives because we believe they don't have clear avenues for growth,"" Farley wrote. The stock's rally comes a day after it surged 5.6%, after BMO Capital's Gerrick Johnson turned bullish, and lifted his price target to a Street high $33. Harley's stock, which is headed toward the highest close since March 4, has soared 55.7% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, 0.57% has advanced 15.7%.“"
Justice for Harley dealers!.
"Who isZed ..... Zed is dead baby, this is his chopper."

"I believe they pay well over 5%. I looked it up once, their debt cost them over 5%, maybe 5.5%. I'm guessing from old data.Anyhow, that means they owe.5% $8.9 biilion or more in interest per year$445Mhard to pay off without in incomewhat if they get a debt downgradewhat if they drop the dividend and the price tankshouse of cards"
It ran out of steam and will go back down to 26 ST then gradually will hit 22 then single digit. IMO
"I have always wanted a Harley. Everyone in my family owns one and love there Harley. I am going to purchase a Harley in 2018, early 2018. If you are a young person, you more than likely just want a cell phone. They keep there nose in the phone, text messaging. Young people today are very misguided"
end users will pay - but not the BMW bikes or Ducati
Market correction will take it under 30 .imo
Pump and dump?
The bottom is about to fallout on this one.Bank on it
Short it on any spike and make money. HOG could not even sell their bikes when the economy was red hot before Covid 19 .
Next 3 days rise to 45-47 range.
Time to short
HOG reached a 52 Week low at $32.29
40 looks like a good buy
Just spoke with my Morgan Stanley friend at the West Palm Beach branch. He said HOG is dead money until they show increase in motorcycle shipments in the next few quarters and that $40 is a premium for the stock. He mentioned dead money and practically losing money if you bought at these levels. I totally agree with him.
these post are so stupidbunch of people sitting home unemployed with no money
"Thanks Obama for having the biggest decline in unemployment and the highest corporate profits ever under you! The economy was doing great under you, then Trump inherited it, took the credit and is now destroying Americans companies like $HOG. Don’t worry Obama, the truth will reveal itself and the frauds will be exposed soon! The righteous shall win"
Hog went up Approx 29% yesterday on hyped news and short covering. Today it will go down at least the 10% - 15% so sell and lot in your gains ASAP. Lol  cause this PIG    Is coming down !!!

HOG trading volume is dying.
Every quarter before earnings the analyst pump Harley to squeeze the shorts and later dump it.
They tried to push it above 39 and failed. CAT is acting similar to 136 . The market is out of whack .The big boys are making final push then short the living daylights out of it . imo
"This is sad. In the early 1990, I sat down with Harley’s Rich Teerlink (sp?) with a video crew to talk about the amazing cultural change they made to turn the company around. This is along the lines of listening to the customers, listening to employees who are actually doing the jobs and know how to solve problems but are being ignored by management and educate management to respond accordingly.Other CEOs included Bombardier in Canada, the Rover Group in the U.K. and Superquinn supermarkets and shopping malls in Ireland. Including visiting and shooting footage in the plants and stores. (Neat assignment.)Sadly, over the years with senior management changes, they all have seemed to lost the magic and the lessons learned. It also doesn’t help Harley when the President of the United States urges potential customers to boycott the company."
"if everyone knows this ER will be bad, isn't it already priced in?"
Who’s the pig bought this Hog at 43+ ? Pump and dump by the big boys again .
Any news if HOG is bringing out an upgraded 6 speed FXR 110?
Harley riders are now TRAITORS!!

Pretty said Harley has to censor this board. It shows you how dangerous of an investment it is.RUN
Harley's constant deletions of negative posts shows you how concerned they are. They are very concerned. HD's new game plan will sink this company.
Does this mean the price of a bike will drop i have my eye on one
Milwaukee 8 engine. Short of their counterbalancing aspect they offer very little in improvement. They should ALL have rubber engine mounts but do not. They should all have the upper head water cooling aspect but they don't and finally the 114 should be in the 118 or above arena.
"Many fools here are casting blame on Harley. You are the same people who defended companies who held their profits in the Cayman Islands and other countries rather than pay tax on it. Now you attack Harley for moving after Trump promised that he is standing up for America. Many Harley workers supported Trump and he repays them by adding over 2000 dollars to the cost of a motorcycle. Now way can Trump and his Republican party get away with this. They scammed the working man! November we will make the proper changes and we will elect working folks and folks who support working families. Donald Trump does not support working Families, he says he does, lies and does the opposite."
"seems like the dividend is the company's way of manipulating the stock up as much as possiblebut they seem to be paying it out of debtdebt is up $550M more in one quarterdividend was $253M or sono reason to buy this stock or to own it, very risky, likely to go bankrupt again and shares will be worthless"
I won’t want to be on one with Kids texting while driving these days Lol

HOG trading at 36 is more hilarious than Chipotle trading at 1380
"Plenty of politics noise on this board, but no sound advice. Blame The Donald for stock's decline?? That is a cop-out for those who are obviously holding a handful of HOG's bad stock. Lesson #1: Try buying/selling based on merits of company.....you may be surprised to find you could make some money. Lesson #2: Sell when things smell (hint: now). Holding onto a story-stock who has already run it's course is bad investment strategy and looses money EVERY TIME."
I have owned Harley for more than 20 years. I have not purchased any stock in the last 5 years. I did purchase a lot of stock in the 90s. I still own every share I have purchased in the past. It has all come by the way of drip plan. I can tell you I am up by quite a bit. Harley is a good company with a lot of potential for the future. The reason I have not purchased in the last 5 years is I do own other stocks which I have tried to keep up.
see how this goes tomorrow. funds has been buying this for awhile. market down 2-3% this is up 1.5% is silly.
Seems overvalued now
Harley should just go private. wallstreet will crush them with constant desire for growth quarter after quarter. HD can make niche products and grow as slow as they want if they're private. way less pressure

"Shift to EV wont work. Plainly put, it's not the Co2 stupid. Those Gen X customers reject Motorbikes as foolishly unsafe. Those that do buy, buy mostly on a lark ... a present to themselves, but understand ride time would be limited to good weather. They wont drive in the snow, rain or windy days. The Millenials won't even go there. IMO, inexpensive EV have a shot in Europe, but I think HOG is late to the game and will fail. The legacy business is toast. The only think HOG had going for them was the perception of Made in America. Their shift in production was foolish and will cost them dearly. I expect a reduced PE of 6 next quarter."

I bet you they all bought in the low $20’s and are using this upgrade to sell higher and get out. Stay the course shorts Harley Davidson will have a terrible earnings report that’s why they fired the CFO and are saying that things will improve. Don’t buy it all tall. $22 - $23 after earnings or less."
Harley's entire selling proposition is that they're American... may as well buy a Honda.
"Come to daddy Piggy    I am going to buy you some barbecue sauce when to get to $23. Lol . My friends learn to understand how the world of these analyst and their manipulation works, there was no news other than Harley Davison was gonna change CEOs and that is the excuse they used to hype it up from 23 to almost 30. I love the Iconic America Brans don’t get me wrong, but once they started manufacturing in India and China, I knew they were in trouble. The famous Harley Davidson bike no longer 100% American made. just to save a few bucks they took some production outside terrible terrible decision !!"

"I am back hello  to all my short friends. Just shorted this real HOG    at $36.66 (10,000 shares) thank you thank you. Made a killing shorting Square today covered at $183. Forget if it’s a Zach’s rating of the 1 I still shorted Square and made well. It went up to fast and it’s overvalued anyway. Harley Davidson is super overvalued at this point also !! Harley-Davidson was at $33 on 11-12-2020 and today at $36.70 this is ridiculously insane. Anyway those new electric bikes  are super overpriced and their is so much competition already with a much lower price. Sell and lock  in your gains this pig is coming down hard."

Just shorted this HOG    at $34.85... absolutely overpriced and this 20% jump is not justified at all. Buy the way shorted on margin... that is how positive I am this Pig  is coming down to $28.59 - $30.00 in the next few days. Super hyped !! Stay the course shorts.

"Twin Cam Engine ProblemsOne of the most central and most commonly overlooked issues with Harley Davidson bikes lies within their Twin Cam Engines, specifically, with the design aspect of the cam chain system. The plastic shoes rest on the cam chains and actually wear out over time. Talk about a design flaw! When the shoes rub against each other, the friction and constant contact with the other shoes wears them down. Left unremedied, the entire engine of the Twin Cam will be destroyed.Weak durability of the shoes equates to frequent replacing- roughly every 40,000 miles or so. To compensate a bit, a fan assisted oil cooler can be applied to assist with these twin cam engine problems.https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"

"Same HOG, just a different quarter. A 5 year plan??? This company will be roasted on a spit by that time. Again, I will ask. Where are all the analysts upgrading this stock. I noticed no one came out to defend them now. Typical."
Harley Davidson has many manipulated upgrades because the new CEO has a magic wand and he will turn things around during this high unemployment times and pandemic !! So I have decided to give Harley an upgrade and a new price target  to $75. It’s now time to buy folks !!

Not sure if bringing out a new GMC truck will help a motorcycle company?
Very smart analyst tricked you and pumped Harley all the way to $30 from $22... they hyped it up and later dumped it. You were left holding the bag !! Will cover at $22 - $23. Pay attention to Stock Trader... many here were thinking I was crazy... I have learned that analysts are in it for their buddy’s and themselves. This Pig    will continue to come down.

HOG is down 8.32% to 24.01
To all of you that thought I was wrong... well here it is this HOG    is going down !! I should have stayed with my big short position and made a killing. This will soon be a $25 stock.
Laying off 40 people is a penny pinching moment. Desperation. It also tells you that the Millennial Fad is over. Harley will not likely regain the loyals they pushed out.SAD
"Bought HOG on October 2nd for $25 and just sold for $27.50... 10,000 shares . Not bad for a few days !! Folks it’s time to short it now... it’s gone up to fast in only 5 days. HOG will retrace back to $25 and after earnings you will see the $23’s again. You need to be smart, analyze and move around. For now this Pig    Is coming down."
Why today when it did nothing yesterday. This stock is so manipulated.
Used to be you could search these boards and look back at previous posts. I'd like to chat with the folks that told me why I was a fool to short this at 34 8 months ago.

"Hog is down due to its lack of customer service. I financed its top of the line $43,000 2018 CVO limited. 600 miles later the oil pump went. Bike overheated and shut down. Bike towed. 700 miles later the cam hold down bracket cracked. Engine made clanking noise. Dealer replaced both heads, cylinders, everything. Dealer took for test ride today and in 13 miles engine started making noise. Scoped it and it scored one cylinder. i called Millwalkie and told them ENOUGH...send my dealer a new engine. They declined. They going to tear engine down again. i told them please....my bike has been in the shop a month for repeated engine related failures. Please send a new engine!!Nope. Sorry sir. They wont make good on tha faiures by putting an end to this nightmare.Never a call back from Factory management. Never a fix. im stuck with a brand new $43,000 bike with repeated engine failures. No concern from factory or management. I been riding Harleys over 30 years and never has any company treated me with such total disregard.if your investing in this management to make you money....reinvest in something else cause they could care less about the customer. if i was the CEO i would clean house at the Service Factory level.

Milwaukee-based Harley swung to a loss of $92 million, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter, after a profit of $196 million, or $1.23 a share, in the year-earlier period. Its adjusted loss per share came to 35 cents, short of the FactSet consensus for earnings of 11 cents a share. Revenue fell 47% to $865 million from $1.633 billion, ahead of the $761 million FactSet consensus. U.S. motorcycle sales fell 27% to $31.3 million, EMEA sales fell 30% to $11 million and Asia Pacific sales were down 10% to $6.9 million.

"New name , Hardley"
What gives HD owners the right to make so much noise in my neighborhood? They look like complete idiots.
"If you think this is BAD ,just wait and see what its at in 2 weeks"
What a dumb move. Did they not learn from Starbucks upsetting half their customer base?
"Historic GrowthAnnual growth, past 5 years EPS-70.37%Revenue-7.53%Dividend-18.72%"
"One time great iconic American company and brand, but it is no longer in favor with young people. The brand is everything. If it no longer has the cachet it once had, i cannot see a reason to buy this stock. go with polaris."
Where did all the upgrades go ?? Stock Trader nows his game. This Pig    is coming down to $22.
HOG is wedded to the base of people it's marketed to for decades. They will ride the decline until another company buys them at a discount for the brand name.
Bets on this opening up or down tomorrow?I think down.
"Harley is like Teslalets make an electric car, charge $90,000 for it and have it weigh 10 tonshow efficientHarley electric motorcycle, $30,000duh, look at the car you can buy for that pricelooks nice though"
"I'm still boycotting Harley.... Harley stabs America in the back every chance they get.... If it costs a penny cheaper to make a part in China, Harley will move all the America jobs to China."
Praying for afternoon rally that erases todays loss
wait till earnings call$50 within a monthu heard it here firstdon't bet against an American Icon
Hog's business model was to continue to sell to aging US riders but grow the company by marketing America to the international markets. Trump has made America a hated brand overseas.
"HD lends a TON of money to subprime credit score people. how else will they sell $40,000 bikes? People buying $40,000 bikes with credit scores less than 640 are goin to default after job loss. HD over leveraged when the times where good. now they're bad. it will come back to haunt them. this is like 12 straight quarters of declining earnings. they also are using new accounting methods to show losses up front from credit they haanded out for financing. for years HD has used shifty accounting tricks to look better on paper than they are. it is over."
"A board member brought 97,850 shares in May 2020 at $21.26 per share ($2,080,085.52) and made a further purchase of 71,450 shares in August 2020 at $27.86 per share ($1,990,832.79). Good sign?"
"all KTMs, BMWs and millenials snuggle up on the couch with cornflakes or veggie burgers for dinner... we're going out for steaks!"
"Harley Davidson was doomed when Scott Walker plunked his wrinkled butt on a Harley. Walker called himself, ""Harley Man"" but his real nick name is ""Scooter"". Very few people want to be associated with Harley bikes if Scott Walker is Harley's spokesman."
"Trump farmers, Trump Harley workers, Trump Trane workers, middle class taxpayers who's taxes are going up, and soon to be Trump supporters who can't afford insurance. How dumb will his voters continue to be?? Is this what winning feels like?"
Short covering is over .
"Reason why Millenials and gen-X's don't buy a Harley's is because of money, they don't have it. Too much student debt and partying."
"5k reduction in bikes will hurt struggling dealers,Look for dealers going out of business.The domino effect is just starting"

Let’s see if it will close under40.
You have 4 choices. 1) do nothing and die 2) launch a Harley on the next Space X mission 3) do an action packed thriller where the Harley is the heroic figure 4) put Ronald McDonald on a Harley and offer Americans discount tickets to KOA campgrounds. You decide.
"Rumored that Cathi Wood, is asking TSLA to buyHOG. Please verify with Wall Street Journal."
"I love Harley but not the stock, still wonder why it’s going up even with worst numbers"
Harley-Davidson reached a 52 Week high at 40.63
HOG reached a 52 Week low at $33.21
"Lol  this is crazy at its best !! Shorted another 5,000 shares at $36.60.... come on bring it on. This Pig    is coming down !!"
Harley owners average age is ~55?Going to be a glut of used bikes in next few years?
"Basic economics tells you, you must lower cost of product to start selling again. The more people can buy with a strong dollar (a real strong dollar) the sooner manufacturing churns. And that starts things moving again.Raising prices to offset lower revs is stupid."
"Harley is here to stay. I have owned Honda, BSA, Yamaha, Kaw, then : Three Harleys ( in that order) They were all good bikes, but Harley is the best and when you grow up you want a Harley."
HD is an american icon in name only
"You will wake up one morning and this stock will be down twenty dollars, I`m telling you this is a real first class mess being pushed by all the know it alls.Jim."
"Dipping below $28, not a good sign prior to EREOY = $23"
cover youre shorts she is going higher ................vaccine relief rally could go on for a lot longer
"Great, now they can overcharge for garbage accessories again."
"Ouch what is going on, down 4% premarket?"
Love to short HOG.
Hog- why would anyone buy on green when profits DROP like 45%?
"Sell Now or get trapped , Hedge funds will be dumping SOON"
"Is HOG being acquired by TSLA?At $60 per share, i am a seller.My source is Donny Pugatch."
This is a stock that Trump would personally demand that the Fed backstop. It gets his white male racist base all riled up.
HOG reached a 52 Week low at $31.83
change the name of the company to Hog Inc. ..Maybe we might get a buck pop..
You survived Covid lockdown might as well buy a HOG and distance yourself on the open road.
"sort term... just day trades but long term IDK? HD always bumps up during ""normal"" season $25-$28Grew on Gov'ts high import fee's for Foreign bikes & Nostalgia.But can China & Japan come back & compete?? - IMO Yes, & Indian (aka Polaris)."
Higher low and lower low HOG will be under 32 by end of May.
HOG is down 5.06% to $36.77
"Shorting $HOG at $36.60. No way they hit estimates on April 22nd. Will be their second big miss in a row. Bad weather, aging demographics, and better competition will beat them. Overpriced new electric models will not save them. 3 Billion Market Cap at best. #dothemath"
"Twin Cam and the M8 are creating serious problems, with the run-out. Harley doesn't want to address it.Class Actions may be on the way, AGAIN"
I prefer Kraft over hog. More divy. Less payout.
"HOG is so full of #$%$.. They can't deliver part for almost six months because the painted parts come out of California which it's closed again. 80% of their part are made in China so no part available, now they're scrambling to have them made in Mexico. New bikes have issues with ABS failure and of course no available. Now they announced to the dealers that we're receiving only 5 new bikes for the remainder of 2020, so now we're scrambling to buy bikes at auction! Worst franchise in the industry..."
They propped it up so the big boys can dump 537 k shares yesterday.lolHOG will get slaughtered and cancel dividends to survive.
Ratings est. was 57 cents actual was 7 cents. Any other retailer would have gotten a beat down.
Youngsters are not buying these huge expensive bikes even their E bikes are too expensive.NIU is making money hands over fists with their E Scooters .
The ticker name of the company speaks louder than word. Glad I am out on time.
CFRA upgraded this pig to 32 from 28... that’s another 15 % hair cut from current pps 38 . Lol
"The only good thing about Harley Davidson are their customers. The CEO, Matthew S. Levatich, should be removed by the Harley Board of Governors before he damages the company more than he already has. I'm not in the market for a new Harley, but if I were, I certainly wouldn't buy from a company that insults President Trump and is anti USA.."
Harley is at least now admitting its needs a turnaround. The problem is they still don't understand why they're failing.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-harley-davidson-1-6-175202441.html
Back to 20 HD can’t service their high debt without sales
Going to come back and close the huge gap up created this morning.
"HOG has about 7 billion dollars of debt and just over 400 million in cash...Earnings percentage has already dropped and now they are going to eat costs????? HOG cannot do that for all that long, they must be begging Trump to change his mind.....Great Job Wisconsin!!!"
ZEITZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #$%$ THE SHORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Sad, but largely true."
"New Pan America seems to surprise the world by it's technology, price and weight. This can be the game changer for HD."
"Sooo, this is their strike back against the tariffs? Obvious, sad and pathetic. If you sell, they will impact the market, you think the idiots at HOG aren’t trying to do this!? The equivalent of taking their ball and going home. They will buy all their stock back when it gets low enough. Watch."
All the nay sayers can suck it!
why up ?
I noticed the call volume increased towards the end of the day. I had been waiting for the price action to break down.......never happened. See what after market brings
HOG... is at a great entry point here in the low $33’s !! Solid financials and lays a good dividend of 4.5%. Expecting very good growth in 2020. It doesn’t get any better than this. Buy and hold.

"you are much better off buying shares in Polaris {PII}. it is a very well run company, more diversified with off-road vehicles and boatinf division. wish i had bought some PII shares back in March when they were much cheaper .."
fixing the trade debacle isnt a win win and is exactly why 4 other presidents were happy to avoid it. Sell your harley shares so you arent losing money then it will be easier to support this necessary adjustment for the USA. it's not like harley has been a great performer or sells a necessary product. ...Over priced death traps.
The younger generation use Uber and Lyft. Big bikes are out of style.
this may be one of the worst messages i've heard from earnings call. How anyone can be bullish on this is beyond me.
look at this rally pointmay finish in the Green I told you savages nitro bet against an American icon
"Harley davidson wont even get affected by the tariffs, they havent been hit yet by it and wont. They are creating a consensus that they would, stop overreacting, the earnings will show a positive instead of a negative. Im not a long or short."
perhaps the younger generation is not attracted by Harley?
"The HOG is a DOG!!! $35 would be a good buy price, as this thing is heading south!!"
"I'm not a big motor cycle guy but I got to say "" Hats Off"" to HOG for having a great quarter and standing up to the big yellow moron in the White House. It's even better since he had his photo op with HOG at the WH. You have managed to make him look the fool that he is good job !!!!"
"I know it’s a rookie thing to say, but I truly wish that people couldn’t make money on the stock decreasing! I can’t wrap my head around it. It’s awful! Motorcycles should be popular right now. Everyone is stir crazy, you can social distance, and everyone is already wearing a bandana haha. Hopefully all will be ok soon!"
"1.8 millions shares shorted on 7.8 million volume yesterday, that represents 23% shorthttps://fintel.io/ss/us/hog"
Rising interest will crush the PPS with their high debt ratio.
stings as much as Indian challenger passing you on your new Harley road glide later fan boy
It's perfectly logical for this pig of a hog stock to be trading at 52 week highs with unemployment rising...and negative earnings.
I would have guessed sell the news would be right with hog
"AMF Years Were EmbarrassingFor those who aren’t up-to-speed, AMF stands for ""American Machinery And Foundry,"" and also very much stands for the biggest embarrassment known to the Harley Davidson brand.We have to give credit where it’s due in recognizing that Harley Davidson may have ceased to exist without AMF involvement when they purchased Harley-Davidson in 1969. However, 1969-1981 Harleys are among the worst, and the AMF years are definitely the worst period that this company has ever seen. During the AMF years, bikes were of bad quality when pegged against their counterparts. At that time, Harleys were nicknamed “Hardly Driveable,” and became the victim of many jokes. This may be an easy one to overlook – all you have to do is purchase a 1982 or more recent model!https://www.thethings.com/glaring-problems-with-harley-davidson-that-everyone-chooses-to-ignore/"
HOG normally goes down after earnings and subsequently spikes back again. Got in today again @46.75.
"I thought the electric bikes were going to be stupid idea, especially since when I've ridden the feel of that engine roaring was awesome. however, but I know a few people who are interested in electric bikes. now they're buying bicycles not motorcycles but there's demand from individuals who in my opinion would never consider this. I think the big danger is if Tesla says they're coming out with an electric motorcycle that'll completely take away from whatever Harley's doing."
"Couldnt wait for $30, started a short position at $29With or without the virus, vaccine, etc ... the trend is not good.That said, come on $30! The more irrational the better.... and btw, if I have profits they're going towards a Harley.Hoping to get a late model repo."
HOG is down 11.01% to 18.47
Been hearing rumoers about a Harley Davidson ev not entirely sure if it’s true but has anyone else Ben hearing rumblings around the industry let me know
I actually like some of the new ideas for the E bikes BUT I don’t know if Harley realizes how much competition they’re going to have very soon with other E bikes and low cost traditional bikes and scooters.
All this did was slow the decline for a few days.
Personally would not pay 14x earnings for hog. Might pay 5 times tho
"Just covered my short position on HOG at $26.85... not bad for a few hours made $6,500. Love  this market !! Now take it much higher before earnings and I will short it again. Thank you thank you !!"
Harley-Davidson is up 7.27% to 35.55
already rebounding off the pre market lows gotta love it
Shorts are piling up today !! It will close much lower before closing today.
"10b debt, going back down, covid lockdowns and unemployment"
I love how CONs call DEMs Socialists and then slam Harley for placing their profits over American jobs. That's capitalism.
Does anyone know when the new models come out?
"Harley-Davidson: Don't Touch ItQuad 7 CapitalSummary:There is nothing like the wind in your hair and thrill of being on the open road on a bike.Just because you love a company or its products does not mean you should own the stock.Millions are out of work, businesses are struggling to survive, and it will take months for people to rebuild financially.A two-week period of weakness was enough to send sales down massively, expect Q2 and Q3 to be disasters.While the company has cash to weather the storm, there are so many better places to invest."
"HD couldn't make Buell work, they couldn't make their Super Bike motor work which led to the V-Rod (with Porsches help), they couldn't make Aquila work, many years ago HD has a lot of bike built by the Italians and they didn't work.Why do they think they can make Ducati work. If Ducati was brining in the money, Volkswagen would keep them because revenue never hurts."
Damon Motorcycles Says It#$%$ $20M In Electric Presales Alonehttps://www.rideapart.com/news/493566/damon-motorcycles-presales-numbers-funding/
HD has been on a downward trend for several years. Do not see anything that is going to change the trend!!!
"In about four years ,HD will be begging for a government bailout"
"there is no plan, they are closing stores and slowing production.. time to sell"
I would say that Harley-Davidson is one of the best shorts right now !! This one is an easy one folks. Their is not much steam left in this stock. Sell and lock  in your gains before it goes back to $31 - $32 again.
