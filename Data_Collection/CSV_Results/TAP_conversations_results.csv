Recent headlines and conversations for TAP
"Total dead money stock, won't move until mgmt. team is changed out"
buy at 37 yesterday ... sell target 45 which is average of 16 Analyst price target
Whispers pulling down yoy eps by another 5 cents in the last 3 days. management already making feeble excuses. TAP bag holders may report to Gianni for their membership cards starting now. lol lol lol
I should have sold. What a piece. I'm out.
"After hearing the cc, I thought their strategy was awful.They can only blame the pandemic and Europe so many times. Why was their channel mixed screwed up? Why didn’t they put more efforts into e-commerce? Where’s marketing? Why was profitability tied so much to on-prem in Europe?"
"I've spent my money on buying the beer not the stock. Too late to get in, or only the beginning of the turn around?I see great potential in the Rock's/TAP's new energy drink."
The shorts are scared now. See if the buy orders can push it to 80 to welcome the next earnings around the corner
Up we go.
@R you must be losing a fortune on this stock. LOL
Happy short squeeze everyone. Everytime i say ill blow a goat the short squeeze comes so now i don't have to do it.
Just bought 5000 shares. We shall see but I agree should be huge upside here. Amazing Company that bleeds cash. Able to get it at a 52 week low after a earnings miss when it was $100 share within the last year. Hard to pass up
"Interesting, people are actually buying in now, knowing it will dip even lower today."
"Dow up, TAP down. Avoid this POS at all costs."
"Stock down , they had a shooting"
"Stopped in to take a look.. ..there's an article on MarketWatch mentioning this stock as a ""bargain"".. But on looking at the chart they've been down trending for YEARS. This isnt the same down trend as many-many stocks getting caught in the December2018 downturn.. Not even close. Not for this guy, but good luck to y'all"
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 41.28
Why the big afterhours drop?
Est a small position and will begin to add....like TAP risk/reward vs valuation of SAM
Corn syrup... they easily lost 10's of thousands of consumers over that ad alone. Inventory is building up
This stocks about to take off. There’s no better time than now for one of those Mickeys 32oz.

Too many South African Brands (SAB) rejects in high positions. They are killing this company. Time for completely new management team. 7 years is long enough!!
Buying
stock market was doing OK until Tramp got involved
Who thinks tap will acquire hexo soon?
"Drinking my first Vizzy's. Very good. Work in retail stores and my Bud rep said they won't do very well, have too much sugar. He was totally wrong as each only has 1 gram of sugar"
Thad can not read the balance sheet thats why he shorted
molson overpaid by about $4 Billion and that is why their stock price is lagging the industry average and will continue to do so for years to come. Much better beer stocks out there to buy than TAP.
Upgrade
LOOK AT TOM'S POST HISTORY. ANYTHING THIS MORON SAYS IS A STRAIGHT LIE. HMMMMM 3 WEEKS OF NON STOP POSTING ALL DAY EVERYDAY ... SURE SOUNDS LIKE A FUN EUROPEAN VACTION ... BTW ... COMMENTING ON PUTIN AND TRUMP DOESN'T QUALIFY AS A VACATION... PFFFFFFT MORON!!!
"Dear Jesus, please make this go back down to 30s, I NEED TO BUY MORE. I won't make the same mistake twice. I'll literally remortgage my house and buy more shares. Also, have mercy on those who can't read financial statements in this chat, they are not worthy of your almighty grace."
"@Gianni You have another buying opportunity!!! LOL. As long as the management team here is still in place, long term investors should look elsewhere."
"Surprise, surprise!"
TAP down a buck.....like clockwork
"Neptune nept thc extraction for liquid concentrated bottles sold to make thc pharma pillsjazz pharma , cola and alcohol, edibles will need this solution in drums.flying cars rtp altu bldenext confirmed moderna is tbiosince 1997, Sektor your teachernot a robinhooder though have lifted many"
What recent news does anyone know about Coors owning 57% of the pot co HEXO on the NY Stock exchange now?
keep buying @gianni!! Glad u held on to your shares. lol
Notice how these clowns at awe*some*stocks were dead wrong on tap. You learn by doing. If you use these stock tip sites you will never learn to trade. Maybe a hammer today. Don't see any real strength in TAP before earnings. TAP is looking for bottom.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-43313147
Vizzy flying off shelves with no marketing that I have seen. Get it on TV!!!!
The Rock's energy drink exclusive to $TAP easily worth an extra $3 per share load up while it's cheap.
Made tons
coca cola is worldwide. this stock is not bearish at this price. My calls looks great last few days
as a rule wait a few days b4 jumping in. will fund manager clear tap from the books for the march report to fund holders? they always clear losers to make them look good.
more institutional investors selling tap. not a good sign.
Dig deeper into the full quarterly earning report and their annual report. This company is in big trouble. What are they doing with the class action law suit about poor accounting practices that made the restate 2 years of earnings?
"Bought this at an average of 34$ with a plan of selling in the low 50s, but at this point I don't see deep value anywhere else in the market. I'll just keep it in TAP for now. Easy 60$ by summer. If it ever gets valued at multiples similarly to other beer producers, this is an 80$ stock."
TAP is down 4.92% to 52.00
Luv Molson Ice but cannot buy in my home state!
The Cobra Kai Coors spike!! Cobra Kai just hit Netflix and it's the #1 show. Every episode features lots of Coors beer and when I went to the store the Coors section was completely sold out. Coincidence?
5 Days!?!? Go back 5 years Broke Millions. lol. share price down 60% and same management team in place. More of the same until they're all fired.
"Started buying at 50 cent drops intervals. 100 shares each lot. Remember: Beer is Here (to stay). There will never be a long term dip for Beer - Bar closings or not. TAP problems are mis-management that are being disguised as coronavirus. If management continues to play victim, TAP will be bought. I will support the buyout at $50+. All shareholders should start becoming critical of current management. Geez - these guys can't think up of a Home Delivery Program for Good Beer during COVID so my stock never runs out !!!"
TAP is starting to become a dividend high yielder (4.5%).Would anyone invest for that as I am considering???
anyone dumb enough to locate in chicago......forget it....i will put my money somewhere else
"@Thad. I agree. BUD is having the same problem as this stock: simply saddled with too much debt. The current CEO of BUD retires this year, and it can’t happen soon enough. BUD’s acquisition of their portion of SAB Miller has ruined them. It will eventually recover, like TAP will. Question is: how long will it take? Thanks for your posts."
Someone please buy Molson Coors. This stock is worse than the debate last night.
"Warren wouldn't invest in a beer company, but if he would, this would be it. Significantly cheap against their peers, vastly oversold, Great Brands, Great Cash Flows, 10x earnings, pays a dividend, predictable business model. Buy the stock, don't look at the price until 2025, click reinvest dividends, and you will make a boatload."
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.95% to 54.44
hi
wait for it. you can only close so many plants and have so many layoffs. u will see. and you KNOW I'm right.
Here is a good read for all $TAP investors. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4129724-cheap-beer-cheap-stock-consider-adding-molson-coors-portfolio
Hearing rumors that tap getting bought out soon.
TAP stock price will be below $33 a share by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. BANK IT!!
"relax guys, we all know this stock is shooting up on earnings. Whatever price movements happen until then is irrelevant. We all know this is trading way below intrinsic value. Patience."
SInce the new Heineken CEO ran the US and is close to Molson Coors - will it lead to him buying the business as his first big action that defines his legacy?
"If I had cash on the sidelines I’d dump it in for some more TAP but since I don’t, I’m over here like zzzzz - wake me up next year and I’m going to reinvest my dividends in the meantime."
"why would I put any additional $ into TAP. Even with their stated intention to raise the dividend, the TAP dividend will still be substantially below competitors like BUD. BUD has a current dividend yield of way over 4%. So sorry I ever put money into this dog."
This thing looks ready to go up hard.
"That Zaaaacks article from yesterday is really looking brilliant, yet again. This is what happens when you have 20 something year old's who have no idea what they are writing about trying to grab eyeballs."
Boston Beer is now a bigger company that TAP.
Looks like they are going to walk TAP down into the 58's by the end of day
"If your short Tap say ""me"" so that I can say a prayer for you."
Does TAP have any exposure to CBD/THC beverages?
4 days until earnings report...
TAP officially welcomes a new group of bag holders. Please see Gianni to get your welcome packet. LOL LOL LOL
"TAP growth plan is in traction. The craft beers vendors were knocked out by pandemic due to lack of distribution and financial capability, many will go brankrupt while TAP is picking up the market shares. Moving forward, the dominance position is solidified further and in a position to grow."
Need new management team here before anything changes.
TAP and your Partner Hexo come up with a CBD beer.Come on Arvada a Colorado Beer Company hgv as A CBD beer. Be the first beer company with CBD Beer Draft on tap. Go for it. Dont Procrastinate. Do it.
It's going to see low 20s. Demand destruction and debt load. Wait for 18 support to pick some.
"I'm convinced the market is smoking crack  Right as we approach the eve of lockdowns and creeping to 100,000 cases a day, this and Constellation turn into bulls . Should have been at this level all month and starting to go down its doing the exact opposite"
"You go and shift into 2nd gear Bunny but unfortunately TAP is stuck in reverse with a brick on the accelerator and closing in on a cliff it's about to fall off of. Share price has decreased over 50% in the past 5 years, recent increase in institutional selling off massive shares and feckless management team that failed to take action and make decisive decisions in an industry that is shrinking. Add to that a culture of no accountability and allowing everyone to work from home in marketing, finance, strategy and HR and you've got big problems that will continue to make this and underperforming stock. Dont even get me started on how much they overpaid for the US joint venture buy out and sloppy internal finance processes that have opened them up to massive class action lawsuit that will be an additional drag on performance."
Motley Fools recommend to buy Molson.
In 3 months @Woke Millions screen name will have to be changed to @Broke Millions if he buys much more TAP stock. LOL
This thing is tracking to be the next KraftHeinz
This stock doesn't make non tatsy #$%$ corona beer. they make nice cheap canadian beer with product from canada. I dont get how the crises could affect TAP as this. this should cause the opposit effect. People see they are now broke so they will drink their sadness into cheap greath beer rather than fancy micro brewing bottle.
s junk an NEVER pull 2 green days in a row. FREAKING DISASTER STOCK>
"Folks, let me get you all in with another piece of education in the beer business. There is this thing called shipment, which it drives the top line in the company’s p&l. It is the volume that shipped to the wither the distributor or retail channels if sold direct. The other piece of volume data is called depletion. Depletion is what retail channel sold to the consumers. This is a critical piece of measurement to me. It is the true demand side from the consumers. It me be clear, I don’t know what that number is. How do I gauge it then, you ask? Simple, I “walk” the market. I observe people’s purchasing behaviors in the beer isle of all stores. I observe what people drink when I am at a on-premise establishment or when I go to a party. Let me tell you people drink all kinds of craft brews. A few macro brews here and there. It tells me that volume is not picking up. Ford motors also offers a larger dividend payout, but I don’t buy ford stock either. Have you counted how many vehicles drove on your street that bear the ford plate?? Enough said."
Time to turn on the Tap. All these recession nonsense were spreaded likely by big boys. Tap should shot up strongly as a offensive and defensive play.
Am I reading the new organization chart correctly? After the money saving reorganization there are more Vice President and senior director positions than before the job cuts. That's TAP for you. Senior management lining their pockets at stock holders expense. Can hardly wait to hear about the VP incentive compensation packages. That will be a laugh and a half. Probably money incentives to work from home.
The Vizzy launch shaping up to be another failed product. No resources behind it and way too sweet. And all the company department heads up to vice presidents getting the biggest salaries in the industry and no reduction in bonus. So sad what this company has turned into in the past 7 years.
Now they're losing money and of course market share. Looking at 35 and slow recovery from there.
"Same like Coors making beer we at Constellation are making CORoNA....workplace shooting is a tragedy..due to.employee termination..We '""fired"" an employee in 2002, and been in litigation ever since, we blocked only few months the proceedings by way lack of jurisdiction. See case: Edwin Moldauer v Constelation Brands v US gov in Washington DC 15-5103 Court of Appeals.We had the case in abeyance for last 5 years. Although we gave him a severance in 2002, we chase him out of the country, we turned around and sued him soon after and filed criminal charges for stealing our trade secrets. He complain beforehand to FBI and SEC about our accounting. Later he complain about our severance and our retaliation, see Sarbanes Oxley Act. We got the courts and goverments to character assasinate him as we do to all our problem employees. We use social and printed media to do that behind the scene. We even had a sexual harrassment case widely published were we smear the plaintiff with juicy stories. At 51 there was nothing left for the terminated employee at Coors to look for. If to compare to us, another 18 years of wrongful litigation he would have been 69 and deadbeat broken. Sad case indeed."
So basically they fudged their books saying they made 400 million that they did not make.
I don’t believe tap will reach $40 again for a long while. Sub $40 is the new top.
This is a great value and value stocks will dominate market soon
This short squeeze will be fast and swift. Don't hesitate to get in. Tap will be at 50 by feb. This is your one and only chance. Please don't blow it with hesitation. Each day you will have to buy higher and higher.
I bet a lot of people working from home are drinking. TAP will bounce back.
Holy! Am I dreaming?
What to choose? $KHC $TAP $MO or $BUD ?
Dan says its time for a Kona Beer not a Corona
Earnings whispers signaling big drop in 6 days. Beware!!
"Every thing was red yesterday, this stock was red. Everything is green today, this stock is still red. Lol. What a dog."
LOL the one red day yesterday had yall short-sellers pretty excited. Was a nice discount for the people like me around here that can actually read a financial statement :)
Train wreck of a management team. What happened to Sol. CEO communicated huge expectations to the street and went nowhere. Another example of no accountability.
I bet TAP share price between $28.50 and $32 by year end. BANK IT!!
"This could be the next short squeeze candidates like GME, AMC, SKT...."
Bunny- come out of hiding. I am superior than you.
Oh nO. Bunny is here. I think she's one of those pumpers that comes out right before the next drop. My short squeeze call is off now.
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.92% to 59.75
What just happened to the Green Day
"Congrats to longs on a good quarter. Take this gift and lock in your profits, execution & market trends haven't gone away. May not see a price this high again for a long while."
TAP is down 5.74% to 38.13
"Well, I have been waiting months for this to get over 40. It might be time for me to fly. Decisions...Decisions......lol"
TAP has fallen $10 since blowing out earnings. Wow.
"BUD P/E 41, TAP P/E 12 , you pick, add more"
"Over blown bill? Really? How long have you invested in tap? Have you look at the Chart for the last 6 years? Dig deep into your thoughts, I mean really deep. And ask the question- in the last 6 years, what new product did tap produce sticked with consumers? To be fair, Beverage business is extremely tough for all, not just for tap."
Get ready for the Vizzy preliminary sales numbers.
The acquisition of Miller was 12 billions. You can pick up the parent company at 13.x billions and wait to harvest the merger benefit for a great risk adjusted return for a steady consumer staple stock that poised for a game changing move to the globe. Time to go all in.
This is unbelievable! bizarre!I have no words left
Z
Getting crushed. Down $4. How low do we go?
"Earnings call whispers alarming. More YoY declines... Question is, how low will TAP drop? 8%, 10%..."
What’s going on with tap they need to do some m&a or buy into something to get moving otherwise this is basically dead money
This Pig stock is complete garbage. Im selling it all tomorrow morning at 9:31 am and buying tech stocks. Noone drinks beer anymore. They all smoking weed now.
Over 30% increase proves that management is confident on the growth and increase profits. Job well done! Need to jump 10% tomorrow. This is only the start.
"Next time this goes up to 40, I'm jumping out. Should do it now, but I still have a little bit of patience."
"Tap reported U.S. sales growth for core brand Coors Light while its other premium light brand Miller Lite recorded its best U.S. performance in five years, chairman and CEO Gavin Hattersley said in the company's fourth-quarter conference call."
Wow! I'm sooo excited. TAP is up 1%. JUNK
6 days until next earnings call...
Stock up beers at home to drink
Need to get rid of entire management team before I buy a single share. until that happens share price will lag industry. If anyone thinks cannabis play will save this industry then invest in constellation brands. They have a big play in cannabis. TAP is a marginal player in cannabis because management is timid and clueless. Bad company and bad stock to buy.
TAP reached a new 52 Week Low at $56.08
millions homeless will have more money to spend on beer. expect earnings to be very good.
Now that grains aren’t going to Asia there no competition for ingredients. the farmer had to get subsidies but now with usa holding on to inventory I’ll gather companies like ADM or Beer companies who buy vast amounts of grains to get good deals for bottling. Helping out farmers and banking on larger profits on the forward PE.
TAP seems to be slightly overvalued. (at 93 and change) But so does the market. Upper 80's seems to be a good entry point.
the beer company hired Bank of America to conduct a strategic global review.Sources indicate a sale of Molson's European operations is a possibility.
Reversing my negative take. This will be in the mid 50's by early summer. Hearing of momentum from the trade.
"Debating on buying in here. Do you think it's too late or once bars open up with larger capacities in several months, it will jump up again?"
"Do your own dd (not a place to explain mine) ... If there is no black swan here, my target is over 100 in couple of years"
TAP can double and triple its sales if the MU drink can take off .
@R where are you. Everything you said about TAP was soooooo wrong. Embarrassed to show your face?
Cannbis drinks are ready! Set to go.
Oh no. Vizzy launch not going well at all. That's a shocker. Not! LOL. This company is doomed until new management is brought in.
"Ok, i thought we are on our way to recover from this disasterwhat is happening today when overall market is up?"
"@Tom Horrible mgt team an molson Coors would make me look to stz or bud if u want a position in this industry. they will recover much faster than molson Coors. molson Coors dividend is at risk. until completely new management comes in, I'd stay far far away."
OMG. Analysts have been adjusting anticipated 1Q top line sales for TAP downward in the last couple of days. Strap in people. Looks like this is going to be another horrible earnings call coming up. Zach's listing TAP stock at Sell.
Back in the $30s soon. BANK IT!
Someone give Garrett Nelson a cookie.

"Hmmm half my portfolio is in Facebook because it's trading at a forward P/E of 19, but this is looking really appealing at this price. I'm really hoping this can go to 40$ so I could have a 50% upside to 60$ for TAP."
@Bigbadwolfe You are correct. But I dont think that's a good thing. Now they'll just do more things poorly. Do u really expect this management team to be able to expand into new products when the cant even get their core business under control? Dividend is at risk. This dinosaur is a dog that will lag for at least 5 years.
Molson Coors Beverage is down 9.03% to 42.00
Back to cheap beer for the world public. Good buying opportunity at these levels.
Rock 'N' Roll!!!
people are drinking micro beer now...real beer drinkers don't drink swill like coors and bud light...Bud light is just a social status but in reality it's the worst mass produced horse #$%$ out there.
Another day another analyst downgrade for TAP. Seems institutional investors starting to sell off now. That is really scaring me away from this stock. BOD need to take action and sack the management team. Dark days ahead for this stock.
"70s by August, BANK IT!"
My buy order executed yesterday at $59.60.
Tap is unpredictable and very resilient.
403k shares bought/sold at 55.57 right after market closed
Do they even have a buyback program?Under 10 PE now how does it go down day after day?
Nothing changed. Still the good old tap. Lol.
"Strong brands, very cheap stock. Tons of upside here if you're patient. Right at its previous bottom."
can you say... VALUE TRAP!!
Somebody KNOWS something and is selling. Dropping like a rock. OUCH!!!
Molson Coors Beverage is down 6.63% to 43.48
"Dow up 400, TAP RED. Biggest PO$ stock on the market."
Crooks............TAP was on the buy list issued by Goldman at the end of April 2018............Yeah.........last week!
I am holding 1 long term 40 strike call on TAP. A PIG dropped from the roof can't go down anymore after it hits the concrete.
Bought some UBEr calls today. starting big move upward. anyone else on the uber train?
TAP is down 6.85% to 53.02
"Buy Tap and Bud soon, if you are confident that we will start to have a vaccine for the virus by Q1, 2021. A number of Drug/Bio companies already have a volume ramp up schedule. I"
tap is one of the best buys
"This was a very alarming earnings report. Debt level is crazy high and they are burning through working capital. That's a big red flag. This is the worst managed company in the beer industry. Bloated middle to upper management teams that do nothing except protect each other. Need to cut at least 35% of all associate director to vice president positions especially in the United states. Half work from home and make an appearance once a week from what I hear. it's a company joke. This company is run like a country club not a business. Sad to see this has happened to a once great company. BTW, whatever happened to the CFO who had to restate earnings going back 2 years due to sloppy internal accounting practices? Nothing. I rest my case."
Years ago I purchased this stock at 17 a share and sold it at 85. Maybe we can do it again. HEXO may help.
@Oswald I think $40-42 would be a more prudent reentry point but I did purchase a couple cases of Coors Light to honor those involved in the tragic shooting that occurred in the milwaukee brewery this past week. Thoughts and prayers go out to all involved. such a senseless tragedy.
"The starter yells GO! at the great cannabis drink race and TAP is stuck in the starting block because their horrible management team screwed up again. we are all left to watch the stock continue falling. Down, down, down..."
I own both ACBFF and APHQF in my retirement fund. I strongly believe TAP will partner with APHQF.
"Of all the stocks I bought at the bottom of the market in March and April this is absolutely the worst, absolute worst stock I picked. I'll let half of it ride but I dumped half of my position today at a small loss which is just insane, so I'm sure there will be a bounce now. But whatever, I'm going to put that money in other positions with much better momentum."
What is the current dividend?
TAP is up 5.89% to 40.08
"Oh, I see why down 6%, makes total sense. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this beer maker would post earnings of $1.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.84, delivering a surprise of 17.20%."
"These 60 large U.S. companies are ‘susceptible to a dividend cut,’ according to Jefferies https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-60-large-us-companies-are-susceptible-to-a-dividend-cut-according-to-jefferies-2020-03-31"
TAP has been sold!
"Now that Bunny has showed up pumping TAP. I would run and fast , Why because the firm she works for is shorting and they have all the funds shares to drive it lower . I would wait to buy now until the low $40's. They know how to use the Wall Street AI computer to drive TAP lower. They destroyed M and X and main other stocks. Better to just stay clear and pick up the pieces in the low $40 because that is were they will drive it to. Just my take and what I have seen them do."
Then $39 after earnings call. Bank it!
when are they selling coca cola products?
Thoughts on next consolidation wave? $OGRMF Organigram $EMHTF Emerald Health $THCBF THC BioMed & outside players to buy in $PM $BTI $BUD $TAP ???
"Bunny, if I listened to you I would be penniless. BOD must replace all management at Miller Coors and most of the eexecutive leadership team at Molson Coors. Down to below $56 today. Pathetic! Must have everyone stop working from home in the US and replace feckless and clueless management."
Tap is going to go down as one of the biggest BAG holder stocks of the decade.
Yahoo's price target is spot on. Very good 2019 total annual return coming. Defensive industry group will perform in slowing growth environment. Tsing Tao!
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.93% to 52.13
In many ways this decline is worst than 2009 when the whole financial system shut down.The stock was trading around the same level. What were Coors- Molson sales and EPS were back then?
BUD now looks like she is following the same death spiral down as TAP did. Only worse because of BUD's NFL related boycott. Plus TAP has better beer.
TAP is up 4.98% to 45.15
11 year low. Passed in market value by STZ. Missed the hard seltzer boom. Demolished by tiny White Claw. Soon to be passed by Boston Beer.....AND ALL UNDER THE EXISTING CEO when at MillerCoors or MolsonCoors.. We want ACCOUNTABILITY. We need a strategic and decisive CEO and strong management team or this POS will fall further into the abyss.
A clear reversal from capitulation lows is happening
Very small change from a reactionary company that continues to become less and less relevant with each day that passes. witnessing a company entering its death spiral. major change needed. not cut a couple hundred more jobs and move HQ to Chicago. Most retained wont even move. they allow everyone to work from home.
"dont understand how this company is doing so terrible. I work for a company that distributes coors products, and the off the shelf product has increased significantly! how is this stocking doing so badly!"
"OMG. A little technical uptick got everyone excited. It has had thousands of these technical upticks over the years! The long term trend does not change cause e underline business condition has not changed. It will be down again once the technical movement is over. Then you all will be silence again, just like the other thousands of times in the last 7 years."
Back to the $30’s where it belongs. No dividend either. BUD is far better play
Building up steam here. Looks like we are going to rocket a lil by the end of the week. prolly get close to 40-42 range.
I am doing some voodoo tonight to get this stock to go up tomorrow and next week. That short squeeze is comming. The IWM is outperforming over last couple days.
"BUD trades at 26 PE, compared with 9 PE for TAPBUD trades at Price to Sales ratio of 2, TAP trades at PS ratio of 0.7BUD has 100+ billion net debt, TAP has net debt of 7 billionNo matter what matrix you are looking at, TAP is trashed like it will not exist 2 years from now.It is disgusting what they has happened to the stock"
The 90 puts expiring in 4 days are fetching $1.05 today. There are huge premiums to be had in the TAP options. What new news is about to come out that is anticipated to dramatically affect the stock price?
Maybe they announce a buyout at $62 tomorrow. One can dream.
"Dow up 100, TAP up a measly few cents. Total piece of junk stock. I literally will celebrate with a 12 pack of miller lite when I can afford to sell this junk."
Will it go to 55 next week?
Biggest PO$ on the market. I will literally scream with joy on the day I can sell TAP.
Dow up 300. TAP down a buck. Like freaking clockwork. POS
"What did I tell you. RED, This is the biggest PO$ stock on the market."
"If it breaks out 68, I will add to it. ."
the champaign of bottled beer's
$TAP 4% up while $BUD is down 2.7% and $SAM is down 1%. That is more like it. Have a Miller or Coors light or a Vizzy! haha!
out of all the stocks I could buy in the market... why would someone buy TAP?
"Not many pumpers here, could be a good buy."
7 days until next earnings call...
"Garbage company. Outsourcing everything, and still losing. It's debt, just debt. PE is just a mirage. Wait for 10-12 at max."
@Kenneth it's even worse than you portray. Management at TAP has been fleecing shareholders for over 6 years. Exorbitant salary and bonuses while driving share price down year after year after year. All new product launches during that time failed and recent Vizzy launch doing horribly. No cogent marketing plan behind it and definitely no resources. Until management is completely replaced. new 52 week lows will continue. Let's not forget how leveraged they are after overpaying close to $3billion for the Miller coors joint venture. Will take years to recover from that. Dead stock with no dividend. Game over.
bought 1 share of tesla today to counteract the dogs in my account
Molson Coors Beverage is down 4.97% to 41.71
Today I learned humility.
Existing customers include $AMZN $WCN and $TAPLION has charging expertise and works with $ABB as a reseller for EV charging infrastructure Don’t SLEEP!!!!
Buy steady/solid consumer safe havens they said.. :/
"Well Bunny, are you sure the ""secret insider purchases"" weren't just soon to lapse stock options? Do your research before posting. Volume fell 4.7% last quarter. Dying industry and feckless management team with increasingly poor internal financial controls tells me not to invest in this company. I see only more disappointing earnings moving forward. So do all the analysts. Read their reports. This company is dead until Canadian and United States management teams are replaced. Prediction: dividend cut coming soon and more lay offs especially in the bloated USA division."
I hve heard that Cannisbus drink are ready whenever the govt permits the selling in fall with Hexo.. Some of them from other states were sold out as soon as it was for sales. TAP is leading the consortium and a great force to reckon with using its powerful marketing and distribution engines I believe that it is leading the negotiation with govt to fine tune regulatory rules in using large scale production plant. .
Who is buying 58
"This is a stock that was beat down on earnings, yet held its own through the drop today. Moral of the story is that beer stocks always run on bad days. What else are people going to do with bad news but drink beer?"
"I should call my shares back , switching them from margin account to cash account. This will trigger margin calls."
"Massive LA County to Expand Capacity Indoors, Reopen Bars ... Have a Topo or beers to enjoy the summer. The vaccination has been increasing and so will the sales of Topo and beers as CocaCola indicated."
Heineken deal?
"i just bot in after hours for 38.88. A 6 percent dividend rate is pretty good and the company seems to be solid. Sold off a couple of duds to pay for it, such as FLR and ERJ. I also bot GBX, another solid company with a solid dividend. Hope this is fruitful."
Molson Coors Beverage is down 11.70% to 37.58
Results were just awful. The CEO blaming the weather is a total joke. Time for some serious changes at the top. This company failed to see and act on the changing tastes and preferences of consumers.A weed infused beverage will not save this company.I own 300 shares and wish I sold. The dividend will support the price for now but this company needs to pivot and merge with another.
"Sigh, this stock just has cement it it's shoes. Nothing makes it go up. It is depressing."
Looks cheap. Earning 6 a share only paying out 2 in divy.
u will see an uptick 8/11 to 8/12. then flat through the rest of the week then BOOM!! A drop of close to 6%. BANK IT!!
Still waiting for it to fall a bit more before I get in.
Their Flagship brew 'Molson Canadian' tastes and smells like Cat#$%$ Unless of course you're a brain-dead eastern bum from Central Canada who is used to drinking tainted lake water
Happy valentines $105
Credit Suisse says SELL TAP. Target $31. LOL POS
"TBIO confirmed Next Moderna as we thought, both using sanofi for vaccine productionNEPT thc extractor, you buy the dip, 20's in June easily, pricing mismathflying cars sector altu rtp acicnkla junes waiting on upgrades"
The Algo also detected 60 insiders purchase. They provide the guiding light. I verified in Nasdaq.com on Tap
"Until fundamental changes, this is still the same tap. It will come down. Enjoy your short term technical correction. Soon tap will give you heart burn again."
"Zoom, zoom, zoom"
Tomorrow morning $58.50 will be on TAP for the morning low
"AND... Premarket open TAP has already given back ALL the gains made yesterday after the ""spectacular"" (LOL) earnings call. I told you so. And so did many others."
"In case you haven't heard the vaccines work.Selling today makes no sense. Yesterday's results before vaccinations is basically meaningless news. Moving forward restaurants, bars, stadiums, will sell again."
Today was the day to buy under $35. Trade between there and high 30's. Dividend cut is built in...and it is a good thing because it is too high and should be used to invest in marketing. Craft beers are being devastated. And if/when management is replaced can go much higher.
I can only see this going up once they reinstate a dividend and lockdown ends. IDK why there is such a high percentage of shares shorting this.
Wonder how this management team can stay on with a clear conscience...
"Aphria pairs up the best for Molson, They have 225 million in the bank, They are profitable, They have the lowest cost per gram. They have international affiliations, Selling to Israel, Australia, Germany, Columbia, South Africa now! They now have a vested interest in liquor stores across Canada which will sell their products, Aurora? too much debt not profitable yet, to many bought deals which are the same as secondary's here."
And down we go again. I guess I just gotta hold this pig of a stock until the entire executive management team is replaced. #DefundTAPManagementTeam.
"Since the ball game got moved to the Coors stadium, I will boycott Molson Coors products for years."
Way to cheap
"Gianni and Joe are delusional. Yes they paid down $1.1 Billion in debt because they are debt laden. They WAY overpaid for buyout of the JV, to the tune of over $3.9 Billion. They were the joke of the financial industry. Then when stock price kept sliding for 4.5 year BEFORE COVID they made foolish desperation deals like hexo/truss where they have little upside, feckless management team then brings Vizzy to market too late in the game with NO marketing resources behind it! Have they successfully launched a new product in 6 years? NO! Vizzy sales are pathetic. Now that they know Vizzy will flop the sign deal with coca cola that industry insiders are laughing at. TAP has to do all the work and has little upside. signed that just before 3Q earnings call to divert attention. Now add playing fast and loose with their financials and having to restate 2 years of earnings and the resultant class action law suit!! LOL. u guys are foolish to invest in TAP. BAGHOLDERS!!! LOL"
The worst run beverage company in the world. An complete and utter disaster. Only salvage here would be a hostile. Terrible beer too. Good riddance
How does Aphria size Up
when are we supposed to see the first hexo pot infused beverages launched? wasn't molson pretty close to getting this done?
The rock! Wow
"After doubling its sales from acqusitions, writing off and increase plant efficiecy are expected. quarter to quarter comparison may be misguided. I would buy more as Molson will expand to China as scale matters."
Here's a great bit of advice. Do the opposite of what @R says. LOL
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 51.26
"BEAUTIFUL, was able to load up BIG when it was up only 1% on open. These earnings are insane!!!"
I dont like the 5 year chart.
Attn. TAP management. The number one rule of any business. Especially a consumer goods business is PROTECT THE BRAND! Stay out of the pot business unless you want the brand trashed.
Molsons hope you have chosen Aphria promise you won’t be disappointed 
If this goes to 43 put all your money in
thoughts on dividends folks ?
I think the color on my monitor went bad. It's showing a green color. Is that correct or do I need a new monitor?
tempting at this price
why the big reversal??
"Management...Divest, M&A or sell .... or step down.. do something at least in terms of structure. Europe is bleeding. US is miserable. Come on"
Why the pop? Earnings leaked?
they have enough money to runa super bowl ad so they must have some sort of profitability. this sucker not going to go low enought to get bought out . final bottom is close or history.
Buy this aggressively at 43
Wow what happened this titanic lol
Wow. Molson Coors and Coca Cola partnership
I’m down 10% on TAP. But i will never be down as much as I’ve spent on booze in my lifetime.
people are depressed and this beer company will never shut its doors. it will only go up. why is it down from the march highs. its better now than ever.
Yes. I hear rumors of the buyout also from some well connected people
"A few shorts on this board. It is good to have shorts especially of they have a reasonable perspectiveAs far as today's action, all booze stocks are down including STZ, SAM"
The Veryvell cannabis drops sold by MOLSON And $hexo are very good.....I add them to my herbal tea.....zero calorie.....great for diet season and New Years resolutions. Doing well in Canada.....hope they expand distribution to US.
It is a miracle that they still have not cut dividend. This in itself does not make sense to me. My guess is the Coors family and the Molson family are resisting it cause they receive large share of the dividends. But simmer or later they will cave in.
"I hope you like the AI algo is doing all the heavy lifting. if you feel historical low P/E of 12 for TAP is expensive and buying it close to book value is expansive, please short it, i am happen to borrow you the stock and then call the margin loan."
"After the little earning bump, now begins the slow slide back down to reminding me what a fool I was to buy this dog. Management team is in need of a full house cleaning. No accountability. VP's and directors have gotten soft and company is managed like a country club or public school. Play in cannabis is desperation at its finest. Give us shareholders a gift and start running the place like a business. No hope here until senior leadership team is replaced and support teams in finance, human resources and marketing are held accountable."
"Taste Great, Less Filling,for your account!"
I speak the truth and now u all know it. stock will be in the low $50's by end of march.
The working class take 6 months off and see where the free checks for everyone will come from.
"The low was $34.01, and we're at about $37 now. I get they cut the dividend for 2020, but this seems to be an undervalued stock with a consensus target of $45. Am I missing something?"
"For the MC management team we are now approaching the escape the cold weather and create trips to conferences in warm weather season. This is where they talk about everything they will do, and at the end it results in more negative performance and a lower share price. Exactly the team we need. We need to see a visible change in culture. No ""boondoggle"" trips. Focus on growing the business please."
$26 per share by late October. Bank it!
this is the last test of the lows before the big short sqeuuze. any day now. dont sell. time to double down.
Bloody.. But long TAP
"After a 72% profit, sold at 60$ the other day and used all the proceeds to buy more Facebook. TAP will likely go to 70-75 within the next few months, this is going to be the age of the roaring 20s. Goodluck to all, and a big thank you to Thad for his continuous support. BANK IT"
Management best hope Eps will be flat if sales pick up by 5-7 percent for 2021. What if sales continue to fall?more downside risk than upside risk? I will buy in at $35-40 level
they won't even commit to an investment.
"Management does seem to be leftovers, however the book value is still currently above asking price as of today. I look for this to only hit the 30's in Thads dreams :) It may offer a buying opportunity after earnings, last 2 earnings reports have been up, and Burry may have bought in the 30's."
What a bunch of dead beats! Time for new management. Use your votes.
@Benjo Can you be more moronic?
Guess what guys.....$50 by Easter!
"@John is 100% on the money when he talks about obscenely high salaries and compensation at molson Coors! Board of Directors should do a calibration of what CEO all the way down to line managers are paid in base salary and incentive compensation (bonus, stock grants... ) and compare to other co's in the industry. I guarantee it would be eye popping! Appears these people are just raiding and plundering this once great company while they drive stock price down for 6 consecutive years. HOW CAN THIS BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR!Until management is FIRED down to all the VP's, nothing will change. Board of Directors please WAKE UP. You dont pay your people 20% above industry average when they have horrible results for 6 consecutive years!!! Shareholders are all getting fleeced."
+100$ end of the year
"Well, I have given you the mock earnings announcement a few weeks back. It is pretty much how I announced it. Always expected earnings to beat because of cost cutting. But earnings can be manipulated. Volume still indicate this company is not just not growing, it is in fact continued to shrink. The illusive growth is still not there. You will not see a stock appreciation until volume at least stabilizes.In The mean time. The headline out there is “the Dow and SP 500 posts new fresh highs”.Bunny- pull your head out of the sand. Show your face here cause I am LAUGHING at you!!"
Get ready for the ugliest performance in CPG when MC reports second quarter. Hard Seltzer is flying off the shelf for everyone but this company. They have taken over the reigns from KraftHeinz as the most incompetent team in Food and Beverages. Look out below $35/share.
"""Miller Coors sues AB over corn syrup ads"". Wow. What a bunch of litigious little babies running TAP. The claim is true and bud light uses no corn syrup. A company managed by a real executive leadership team would get their creative department together and come up with a campaign that would hit AB back. Instead TAP starts crying and pouting and lawyers up. Pathetic wimps running the show at TAP. TAP will continue to lag in profits and share price because if the wimpy babies running the company. Pathetic."
"TAP is a dinosaur of a company. way too top heavy. they have executive VP's in every function with VP under them (HR, Finance, Operations...). No nimble well performing company in the industry has had that structure for at least 7 years. Just fleecing the shareholders and protecting their own big salaries and bonuses. This company needs to chop at least 30% of its top leadership positions and run lean and efficient like their competitors."
Wow... look at 5-yr chart of TAP. It's no longer in a long-term downward path. The trough has been passed.
Told you not to buy once Bunny and the Vanguard crew showed up shorting TAP. Vanguard will know use your funds and drive TAP lower so I would just wait until the low $40 to start buying
The synergy with the 2016 acqusition is showing up soon with increased revenue and slashing costs of employees.
"Haven't heard much from Thad, see and ma. Making fun of me for hyping Coors. I'm up $16 a share."
Beer is sexy again!
Dividend cut coming. Vizzy DOA. No product innovation. Poorly positioned portfolio. Underwhelming marketing. Weak management team=$30-35 share soon.
Repeat after me.TAP is worth more than BUD.
Did Truss and Hexo start producing CBD Infused water yet?
Any word on a Dividend in 2021?
Burwick would have been an incredible choice. Tenacious and focused. Demands accountability and expects all to be at work in the building during business hours. Has always been on top of frivolous perks and puts an end to the foolish spending. I don't think TAP wants to change. Mgt at TAP protects their own and could care less about us stockholders.
Who in their right mind is buying this stock today after such bad earnings? This thing will drop significantly after open.
"Thad told me to come back here today. Here I am, but the first digit of stock price is not 3 though."
Trading like BK is inevitable! LOL
Molson Coors Beverage reached a 52 Week low at 33.66
"When Reddit crowd is in, then you will know the truth of under valued gem."
"Really looking forward to the earnings release... Sales during the pandemic will speak volumes here. With all the turmoil and uncertainty, it would be likely that people are buying extra Miller Latte's to cope with the stress. Even BUD has rebounded since March.. I think it is safe to add at these levels and ride to $40. Some companies are raking it in during Corona (PTON, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, etc) why not TAP?"
I hope you did not miss the great news that Ontario has liberalize beer sales that is positive to TAP on back of up coming Cannibus drink liberalization.
"Buying Molson for free. Molson paid 12 billions to acquire Miller brands for global expansion. Now, you can buy the combined entities for slightly above 12 billions. In other words, you buy the original Molson almost free. Sale what you own, i would love to acquire more. Delusional are the venturiest who does not read financial statements. High insiders ownership gurantees shareholders interests are look after."
This is starting to look pretty attractive
... How does the aluminum tariff effect things here?
Well at least we got the short term pop to almost 40 last week. Looks like back down we go for a while.
STZ is killing it and TAP is an utter disaster. When are we going to see some bold actions from the US division. We get the same old formula with more brands and ugly performance for the brands that matter.
"Now with the BUD horror story announced TAP is next. To have any chance next week must close down MillerCoors operation and wrap all under MolsonCoors. Costs are too high for a declining operation. Find another $300-500m with investment in core brands. Dump the cannabis idea its going nowhere. JV with Heineken, since both are in trouble."
dividends returning soon ?
Gap at $53.40 that must be filled. Usually goes 2-3% lower than said gaps - look for bottom around 52.06 or so - give or take 25 cents.....that will be buy point.
50 is usually where I buy this but not this time. I'm thinking 45.
any news or this is a gift?
"There's a lot to like about the quarter. Cant argue with the tick-up in EBITDA. People talking about sales volume as if restaurants were and still are operating at full capacity. A decrease of only 3.1% y/y is certainly something to be celebrated. On-prem orders allow company to move greater volumes but at cheaper wholesale prices-- apples and oranges-- off-prem is higher margin. So, to point to a 3.1% decrease in sales without considering the shift from on-prem to off-prem is just poor analysis. What people should be asking is: how sticky is this incredible off-prem growth? Will a return of on-prem come at the expense of off prem growth? Because, if any of you guys care to transpose and extrapolate a trailing 5 year average on-prem sales volume over the top of recent off-prem volumes, you get a high single digit comp y/y-- I reiterate, something to be celebrated. What's more, the company proved to debt holders that it's not completely dependent on restaurants, and, therefore, less tethered to the uncertainty associated with virus closures."
TAP reached a new 52 Week Low at $58.09
It made national news. A WWII Vet turned 100. He said drinking one can of Coors a day was his secret. We need to get this guy to headquarters ASAP. Could this brew be the fountain of youth?
did people quit drinking beer after the election?
Bottom is in
"This stock is dead until they get rid of entire management team. Two analysts recently pointed out TAP is in a terrible position because of management's failure to act and make bold moves in a struggling market that will only get worse. I've lost all faith in management at this company. Need new blood that will run TAP like a business and not just protect each other. Everyone works from home. No accountability. Redundant job titles and positions. No one ever leaves because salaries are the highest in the industry and work load is small. Could cut 50% if associate directors and above and still be overstaffed, especially in the USA operations. So sad to see what this once great company had become. Next stop will be a share price below $50 and another brewery closing then dividend cut."
AMAZING EARNINGS FROM $ACB wow! $HEXO $TLRY $WEED $CRON $FIRE $NRTH $CANN $MJ $NBEV $TAP $TRTC
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.98% to 45.15
this is very cheap if you have a 3+ year investment horizon. checks almost all the buffett graham deep value boxes.
I strongly suggest @R and Wokemillions buy more TAP. Then we can chat with them after next earnings call. LOL. Major downgrades for TAP in the last 2 days and they say buy. LOL!!!
Molson Coors Beverage is down 5.11% to 47.56
Really bullish now... can’t believe it.
52 week low for stock price on the horizon. Bank it!
Buy now at low price...great reopening play...
Still can't get over how cheap UNP is
I think this is pretty overblown. Looks like a solid buy when they have enough free cash to buy back 10% of shares annually.
"For the current market cap of 11.97 billions and earning at least 1.3 billions. as the company presentation indicated, with staple free cash generated every year with increased reduction of costs of 200 millions per year for next 5 years, the free cash it can generated is what that counts, simply read the company presentation , you know the positive strategy is excuting. The rsik know. Tap is a defensive consumer staple stock with insiders buying and align with mine, it is the type of stock that you can sleep at night if buying st this price level knowing that it will increase in value for sure and earning money everyday with minimum risks"
"Could be turning on the weekly chart, I'm bullish. It's also outperforming its peers on a relative basis over the past few months."
Go Look at GE stock. Tap is Next.
$50 by Easter
Better sell fast Gianni. The afternoon drop is starting to form.
$53 before close
im a buyer and a believer in TAP
Watching this be up over 5% while the rest of the market is a bloodbath is better than watching porn
This pig is growing wings and is getting ready to fly. This time is different. ITs really going toi fly this time around. Need to Flush out some shorts to balance out the decline.
"More Blue Moon, and VIZZY hard seltzer coming in March 2020!"
it's down significantly today because it appears they were misstating their earnings for the past two years. article states they had poor internal accounting controls. they have to restate their financials for the past 2 years and take a big hit on their retained earnings moving forward. SEC frowns on such sloppy internal financial processes and as an investor it makes me wonder about the competency of management especially the CFO. Also has me thinking if it was done purposely to mislead shareholders. people should be fired for such a horrendous screw up. as an investor I no longer have faith in the people running this company. sure we will see class action law suits on this for misleading investors. where do I sign up?
1....2......3.......TAP OUT!!!
choo choo here comes the bull train
When does truss start producing CBD Infused water?
"$BUD and $TAP have a near monopoly on the Canadian beer market (including many of the beers Canadians think are ""Craft"" like Mill Street Organic, owned by BUD). Molson has already said they plan on cannabis products rolling off the assembly line in time for October. Molson's partner $HEXO has already said they flavorless cannabis molecules that can be added to any beverage. We already know Tilray has flavorless cannabis oil as they are selling it at the OCS under the brand name Irisa. You can bet Bud will have competing product rolling off their assembly lines at the same time as Molson.This is high margin as beer is much more expensive in Canada than in America. In Ontario, the cheapest beer is $1.50 a bottle. The government actually sets a floor (a minimum price that can be charged for a beer. It was recently lowered to a buck and no brewers are selling at that price). The third largest player in Ontario is Sapporo, which co-owns the Beer Store with BUD and TAP. It will be interesting to see if they enter this market. Whether they do or not, all of the big names in this space makes it likely that institutional investors will now make more moves into these legal cannabis stocks."
The surge wow. This is like my only green today lol. Hopefully it doesn't do a reversal tomorow like shopify is doing for me
"More than 10 year low. The management s**t show continues. Let's see if there are any insider purchases after the lock-up. To date no, which is an indicator of the confidence management has in their ability to turn this disaster around. Need a new CEO please."
"The main problem w molson Coors is that ever since we absorbed the us joint venture we have become an inefficient organization. Especially here in the US. No accountability, fragmented work groups scattered all across the country and half of the HR, Finance, Brand/Marketing employees work from home. Add that to flex work schedules for salaried employees has created no accountability and a general sloppy product from our internal partners. I've slowly sold off much of my stock because this new relaxed culture since the joint venture ended has made us a careless and lazy organization. Huge inegfuciencies and 3 people in HR doing the same amount of work that it used to take only 1 person to do. sad to see this company sink so low."
8 days until earnings call...
No dividend no buy!!!
Can someone explain to me why TAP is the only damn company that is losing so much in the entire beer sector?
"almost same market cap as beyond meat, with 100 times the sales and makes money unlike BYND. Beyond will never be the company Tap is. Has the world gone mad??"
With this incompetent management team the shares will be in the 20's very soon.
"Wow, that bounce did not last long."
Maybe it'll drop to $0 and I'll get free equity...maybe!?!?!?!
mid $40's before year end.
How about launching blue moon light?
Doubling up
Another day of market huge gains while TAP is red. Biggest PO$ on the exchange.
Summer is upon us (unless you live in North Dakota....) and it seems the forecast is that people will stop drinking beer over the next 6 months...................... Yeah right........
When do you think you will pay dividends again?

what day and time is this stock expected to report earnings anyone pleeze?
Lead analyst Praveen Chawla nailed TAP in a recent article. Atrocious financials with underperformance for the foreseeable future. Believes company MAY be able to reinstate dividend by end of 2022. Sees potential looking out 3 to 5 years but that's a long time in this industry.
Impressive that it's up to 50 again with a now 10% short float and analyst downgrades. Deep value at its finest.
morons saying it will be terrible earnings. Anyway I have sold everything at 36
Dying company run by dinosaurs who are lining their pockets at shareholders expense.
Another strong quarter from STZ should lift all the beer stocks. Strong portfolio coupled with a single digit P/E makes TAP a compelling buy.
Careful chasing here 50 pin
I'm adding 1800 more to the ridiculous price of $ 36.86
The current heat wave will increase the sales of beers . The price /sales at 1.3 or price /book is 1.1 are at historical low. It should be great entry point for the MU boost coming.
Congratulations to Joe. The newest TAP bag holder. You can pick up your welcome packet from Gianni! LOL LOL LOL
"kids these days are getting drunk in their basements with a sort of Red Bull energy drink mixed in with some alcohol. No doubt in my mind this has cut deeply into beer sales. could be a fad, especially with governments starting to regulate that industry but I havent seen the beer companies react to this growing trend."
eaning increase 7 to 8% is completly a beat to me. Slightly lower volume but earn more in the quarter tells me efficiency is improving
I put in a stop loss at $33 but never thought it would even get close. Might have to change it before the close. This is absurd!
Last chance to buy before they announce an MJ tie-in
Beer never loose the Value!!! Summer is coming..plus we are at home doing cook-outs drinking..so we all going to be fine in this invesment
"Soothsayers make predictions, Analysts often lie and mathematicians make projections. The abbreviation for Motley Fool is . . . Oh yah! I sold out my soul a long time ago. TAP, OK, I agree, and even better drink some product! Summer is coming gonna stock up!"
I bought shares going long. people are depressed and Coors is the beer of choice. look at cobra kia on Netflix down and out Johnny got his coors banquet by his side. in a bad economy buy alcohol guns and rope shocks.
"DOW up 300, TAP DOWN. Biggest PO$ on the stock exchange. SELL NOW before the sell off. Just think of how low this PO$ will get before Nov 4th. Maybe low 20's"
"If it was $PEP or $BUD or $DEO,, $DPS,, $TAP ....We would of doubled pre market, They might be #1 but they are no way going to take over this industry without the 'Big Boys and their lobbyist to help with red tape"
"$PDRDF? $DEO? You paying attention? Now is the time to make $BUD, $TAP and $STZ look foolish!"
"With coke partnership, CBD and their other selzer drinks coming out, I think TAP is in a good position for a rebound."
"Morningstars web site in the key stats tab, it is showing TAP is increasing its Trailing Twelve month Free Cash Flow to 1.7 Billions! What a bargain !"
Will buy at 43
Changing direction!?!? From bad to worse?
Bud has recovered more than this. Is bud a better buy?
What is most scary is the management team on the earnings call were proud of their results. Just shows how low the bar is for this group. A leadership team change will take this to the mid-40's very quickly.
What's the difference between tap and tap.a?
millennials don't drink beer? volume have dropping for the last few years b4 covid. permanent change?
"I really want to buy this stock but their 5 year chart is scary, this thing has been on the decline for 5 years, why is that?"
It’s time to consider a strategic merger with Heineken.
This thing is a #$%$
This is the final washout before the big short squeeze. We are in capitulation phase now. Not sure exactly how deep it will be. Institutions are running stops so they can cover there shorts from 3 years ago. We need to group together and buy heavy and make institutions cover there shorts at 50. This sucker is going to change fundamentally as soon as election is over and virus magically dissapears and peopel go back to restaraunts and order beer and wings.
How can this be down? Bars are opening up!! Better products than Bud.
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 51.84
Lets Go
#TAP We may have here an upside runner to watch. Technicals are looking bullish at stoxline. Target: 73.83.
more poor people means more alcohol consumption. these people will not be buying craft beer expensive. and they wont be buying Budweiser. they will go for the best tasting beer that is under $20 and that is TAP.
anyone buying more tap
What a miserable stock. Worst stock I have ever owned.
Molson Coors Beverage is down 4.93% to 52.28
Beer sales are declining. All the more reason to buy HEXO.
"need to market more of Select 55 half the alcohol, half calories and 1 carb and tastes great"
"This company is becoming very aggressive in expanding depth of its business. Entering the coffee,spiked seltzer and Cannabis infused spaces etc."
Miller high life
"Will take at least 3 to 5 more years for them to recover from the gross overpayment of the SAB/Miller Coors joint venture buyout. Foolish foolish decision and the people responsible are the blokes still running this organization. BOD must take action. Until then, more stock price run down and probably a dividend cut."
"Being on the losing end of a trade sucks, right? I found LoinStockAlerts the other day and they are pretty good. The alerts are quality, not junk and they are straight forward and cut out the hype."
Is the marijuana drink supposed to have beer in it or just marijuana?
what the hell just happened?this stock is so screwed up!
TAP always does the opposite of what you would expect. We have to deal with it.
crystal ball says TAP stock price down to $22 to 24 by late 1Q early 2Q of 2021 and bought out at an effective price of roughly $25 to 27 per share.
News Update!!! Bunny has lost so much money on TAP he can now only afford to buy fractional shares.
"Molson Cannibus drink will be the booster. I am sure Tap , Bud and constellation brand are very HIGH with Cannibus"
"Yep you are the best on Wall Street at working together to manipulate a stock The SEC needs to look in to your crew and what firms you work for . Just maybe they will put you in jail just like the guy from JPM LOL,LOL,LOL"
New 10 years lows every hour. Easy money short.
What happened at 12:31 pm? did someone have a FAT finger?
Everything is starting to open up just in time for Beer Drinking Summer time and Once it's open we are not shutting it down again. TAP is now so cheap everything bad is already priced in and any good news should drive it higher. Worth over $50 today.
"I'm happy to have added a few today. Not sure when this will eventually turn around, but hard not to believe it will...Multi-billion dollar company with a huge presence in Canada...and already racing forward into a world of possibility.Cheers to the future with TAP!"
this suckers goign to suprise this weeek to the upside. Locked and loaded here.
"This shouldn't be jumping 5 % the entire market went down tremendously this week Nasdaq, S and P and Dow all in major sell scare off from covid resurgence and weak economic outlook. Bars and restaurants are closing"
"I think there is much more going on here than meets the eye. go back to the accounting irregularities that made them have to restate earnings for 2 full years causing class action law suits against TAP. Finance and accounting seem to play fast and loose with the numbers. I think if someone really pulls back the curtain we will see a complete train wreck financially. BTW, all executives keep pulling down HUGE bonuses and variable incentive comoensation awards and Grant's while stock prices has tumbled for 6.5 solid years. Wish I never would have purchased this stock."
"I own quite a bit of $KO, but I'm intrigued by TAPs moves lately. I like they are diversifying their drink selection with partnerships into THC drinks and now with $KO. The partnership didn't do much for $KO stock yet, but at these prices I might just be a buyer."
Maybe gonna get into this lol
"wasting shareholders money again. they protect their own and pay exorbitant salaries compared to the rest of the industry. between the corporate jet travel, country club memberships for all executives and luxury boxes company could have saved 100 jobs minimum. Is it true every director or vp and higher get country club memberships covered? unbelievable. all rewards for running this company into the ground. so sad."
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.91% to 36.99
wonder how the management team will spin the horrible Vizzy numbers at the October earnings call.
Brewski time again. - Pete
is coca cola still working for alcohol beverages with TAP?
This stock is a good long position. Earnings at the end of the month plus peoples alcohol consumption has gone up since COVID-19. You're looking at better yields on the back of this!
TAP stock price will be in the high $20's by year end. BANK IT!!
Anyone think a deal will go through between BUD and CBRL? Could TAP be a good match for CBRL? About 650 restaurants for distribution (and advertising).
Climb Baby.......
TAP-A is down -6.52% to 81.33
TAP is down 4.97% to 41.71
60Comin
Have a beer and a hard seltzer if you must.... hahaha! I do prefer beer though.
Cost cutting on track in realizing acquisition synergy. Savings of 200 millions a year will go to the bottom line.
"As it is often the case, among a sea of green there is this red beacon that goes “tap” “tap” “tap”..."
This PIG is not performing. Might just throw in the towell. Glad I bought tesla on the dip.
Dividend suspended.
This should tank hard today
Buy at $60.00........or a bit below may be.
Bunny- buy - bunny. It is so much cheaper now than you were pumping it at 59. I would not accept anything less from you.
"This is the definition of panic selling! Q1 (historically their softest) accounts for less than 15% of total profit for the year. Management re-iterated their full FY guidance and the market responds with this? Sorry, but this is anything buy rational."
Still waiting
"Stop blaming management, or talking div cuts and everything. And stop selling. this is going down like everything else with the market. Personally, I am layering in on all of my holdings, adding in at this point. And also layering in with my index funds. Now is the time."
TAP resumes rising trend
I believe TAP will continue to lag until management is replaced.
nice article about the earnings dates of Aphria n Coors on the same day
"TAP at $33.81 per share is already dipping below March 2020 lows. This is quite significant. Will it go lower from this point? I see light at the end of the tunnels. At most, I believe there will be another 2 quarters of negative comparison, by second quarter of 2021, there will be nice year over year growth."
How much lower? $85?
"This bubble is going to POP soon. Gianni, tell us when you sell and for what price. If we dont hear from u we will know ur just another bag holder after the big drop comes"
TAP need a cbd partner 
"So the shooter was black, and victims white ?... what was the reason for termination? selling trade secrets to Constellation Brands?"
"Both of the CEO's should have been fired. Both have the personality, strategic mind and creativity of a piece of cardboard. Neither have the capability or urgency to set a new and different path for the company. They try to do the same old thing slightly better and think it will work with incapable teams. However the Board couldn't let both go or the stock would have dropped to the mid-forties in no time. Unfortunately we will have to wait for at least another year of failure before there is truly a top tier management team that comes on board."
Michael Burry is loading up
@Pugi Dont u understand? This company has been mismanaged for close to a decade. The past 6 years saw the biggest bull market run in history and during that time TAP share price fell over 60%. Yet executive compensation for the VPs and directors went up while they all barely worked. No one came into the office before COVID hit. It's a bunch of dinosaur management team lining their pockets until they are all sacked which should have happened years ago. Dead company until major management shake up.
Definitely not enough. This should have been done many years ago. What they think is big change is small to everyone else. This company is a dinosaur and continues to speak and act like one. It needs to start with talent that has a track record of delivering big transformations and this group is not it.
Short squeezes happen when people are affraid to buy it because they think its going to turn down again. Not this time. Bottom is in. Going to 50. This PIg is too cheap to go any lower. Tap has a strong balance sheet and peopel not going to stop drinking. After the UBI kicks in your g oing to have a lot of lazy loozers drinking 24 hours a day.
STOP SELLING!!! Market is up huge. Why are you selling. Who cares that they suspended the dividend forever. Don’t ever buy for the dividend.
look at 2008 when people are depressed drinking fellows. it won't be craft beer they cry into. it will be a brand that is American and stood by them their whole life.
PEP and TAP ought to merge
Did they cut dividend?
"Time for the fools to sell me your shares LOL,LOL,LOL Love clueless fools LOL,LOL,LOL"
@Bob it's very hard if you have a management team that has instilled a culture of no accountability and a country club like work atmosphere for the past 6 years. Add to that the board of directors allowing lucrative salaries and stock bonuses to all management employees year after year when they have all achieved terrible results that have run share price down over 60% during those 6 years. Shareholders left holding the bag while Vice Presidents to CEO make off with bags of money year after year after year.
"Video is mainly about ZOA, but they make some very good points about Molson Coors and how undervalued this is. Be warned, it's a recovery play, so don't expect earnings to turnaround until coronavirus is in the rear view mirror :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1ii6Icr2dw&ab_channel=DumbMoneyLIVE"
"Acquisition of Atwater is what in trend. Small craft brewer are consolidating as they cannot compete with Tap as Tap move in with modern plant on the 10th street, Chilliwack, etc that craft brewer cannot compete."
Going lower today.
my second favorite beer is now going to sell my favorite beer in my favorite state. Cali love!
The shorting crew is running out of sellers. Here are the big owners of TAP and your going to find it gets harder to get shares to cover withhttps://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=TAP
"Molson Coors Brewing Co -B (TAP) moved this week from #401 to #10 overall stock, passing Yahoo Inc (YHOO) Nxp Semiconductors Nv (NXPI) Western Digital Corp (WDC) Mffais Flow$ 455,999.443 (K)"
Been a nice bounce from the low below $35. This is a tradeable stock at that level. At the current price its a sell. One big reason is the hard seltzer miss. With Vizzy they have a 2 share of the segment. And from what I hear it's struggling. Lets get it back to near $35 again. Second quarter performance will help it get there.
Literally the worst stock I have ever owned. I hate Molson Coors.
One big advantage of distillers over beer makers is their inventory doesn't go stale.
"Please go back down to 40$ i want TO BUY MOREEEEE. This time I won't miss my shot, I'll dump 50% of my portfolio in this one jewel."
Stz looks cheaper than tap
Hanging in----10-31
TAP will rise as bars and restaurants open
8% down in 2 days this is on the top of rock bottom valuation.BUD trades at 17 PESTZ trades at 19 PESAM trades at 50 PEThen we have TAP at 9 PEI thought last earnings report was outstanding considering challenges in the industry. Beat consensus by 127%. The call was also very positiveNever thought it will go this low after that kind of earnings.
Good news to hear about the dividend from the report
Saw Vizzy in Publix today. Looked great but why enter the market at $3 over all the comps?
"38.88 per share, it's like money in the bank, this will be 59 again soon."
The cc was surreal. It was the CEO patting himself on the back for all of the success in 2020 as a result of a great strategy. A PR event to keep his job for him and his homies. All of the numbers were manipulated to make bad look good. What he has to understand is the scorecard is the stock price and under his watch since the MillerCoors days it has been a complete train wreck.
"Dow up, TAP at a fresh 52 week low. DEFUND TAP MANAGEMENT. TRUMP 2020"
I want to rebuy soon. Coca Cola in January?
"Truss bev""s will smoke beer sales long term V :P"
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 48.51
Gotta be bullish on tap
"CGC Canada just made BUD legal,let’s drink to that"
"Been a long-term holder due to the valuation. Seems like analysts are finally turning more bullish on it. The new management is executing nicely on their plan. And the economy reopening is another catalyst. Still significantly undervalued to peers, but I think TAP is a better business than the other players."
Molson Coors is the worst stock on the exchangeChange my mind.
Worst run company in the beverage industry. We have witnessed continuously poor results from this CEO since assuming the position. Sadly it is now the shareholders who are assuming the position..........bend over!!!! A message to the BOD..........WAKE UP!!!! SHARE PRICE DOWN 7+% AFTER ANNOUNCING 1st QTR 2019 results.
"If your a bag holder say ""ME"" just curious on ratio of bag holders in this pig."
30 to 32 would be neutral area
Wow still at 50$ even though float short is now at 12%. This baby is going to murder shorts once it pops sometime in the summer
https://www.millercoorsblog.com/news/no-holiday-for-beer-industry-which-posts-tough-independence-day-sales/
Funds are buying Tap
"Wondering how people bought recently feel about this now. They bought in the 38-39 range thinking this is such a bargain and “overdone”, “makes no sense”."
Good luck shorts. This is the turning point.
Outperforming the market today! Muhaha
Something is up.
New CEO is just more if the same. Ran US operations into the ground with redundant bloated positions with no accountability and relaxed culture. Can't believe this is the guy they picked to run the entire company. Look for a more relaxed work environment with many working from home and all protecting each other at the director levels and above. Will probably give everyone more vacation time and paid holidays while the company continues to decline.
TAP-A reached a new 52 Week Low at 60.00
"The PE of TAP is just over 8 and BUD is 42, can anyone give a justification for TAP being valued with such a low PE and BUD with a high PE? However, Sam Adams is a better beer for drinking. Just my opinion"
You have big investment in Hexo. Announce a Beer with CBD in it. Dont be last and miss the boat.
By far the cheapest beer company I've looked at. Buy.
"just FYI Q2 : eps beat +143.28% , earnings beat +4.36%"
purchase of Atwater craft brewery out of Detroit just shows how archaic the MC ceo and management team is. ABInbev bought numerous craft breweries from 2004 to 2012. at the time it was a good idea until craft brew drinkers figured it out and ran away from ones that were gobbled up by a major. I'd assume MC way overpaid for them as well. This company is a dying dinosaur.
I have put my order in to buy shares of TAP at $40 and change. We will see if I am right or not
epic reversal
@james @R @Alex funny to see these people coming out of no where to pump. Hoping for a short technical bounce gain? Just make sure you get out in time. Cause your posts are rudimentary as investors.
TAP-A is up 15.90% to 61.60
Goes down a buck every day! Biggest POS on the market. Only about 30 days until it's 0.
"if Tap aligns to the valuation multiple of Cannibus stock, it will triple at least"
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.96% to 49.33
"TAP is a dying company run by dinosaurs who are lining their pockets at shareholders expense. Any other place the executive leadership team would have been shown the door over 2.5 years ago. Major shake up is needed here. Not another reorganization or layoffs but COMPLETE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP!!! Until then, expect more share price decline and more excuses with promises of better days ahead. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!! 6 dismal years is long enough. Change leadership team NOW!!!"
"I think that being acquired by Heineken is the ONLY path forward for MC. Question is, is there any value for Heineken in such an acquisition? Of course there is, but not at a valuation of $55 a share. Maybe $40 or $43. MC will continue to erode in volume and share price and Heineken will scoop them up at a fire sale price and dismantle many parts of this non focused dysfunctional company."
For those I read here that touting the lines of “people are at home” or “employment is high. People are drink out of their sorrows “. Since when you can see through the walls of people’s home? Pure self imagination. You can stop that for your own sake.
"What first drew me to TAP is how they made 250m$ in Q2 when everything was shut. Turns out selling beer in grocery stores has much higher profit margins than selling beer in bars and restos. In the low 40's, the market IS CURRENTLY pricing in shutdowns."
@John Agreed. I actually really Doug into 3rd quarter earnings report after the earnings report and it looks horrible. Cutting 500 jobs and moving headquarters wont fix the dire financials. Their BOD better get a handle on executive and VP compensation. They are paid handsomely for ruining a once great company.
in Micheal Burry I trust
"2021 eps reduced to 3.92 from 4.62 , that's not good news,"
Will it keep going up
TAP is moving toward growth
thinking early hours will be down with profit taking
Should be #$%$ instead of TAP.CEO crowing about limited growth in the US....lol.Stock used to be great.
short squeeze is over now. sell tomorrow morning.
Tap has little pricing power. Low priced beers are everywhere. Too much competition.
"Nice Earnings Report, I'll be back in a year from now when its pushing 100, good buy, you need not reply, I wont read it"
@Edward your ignorance is showing. It's the current management team that is ruining this company. They drove share price down 50% BEFORE COVID hit. Do you really think they can navigate the company out if the pandemic??? This company is dead until entire management team is replaced! AB InBev or constellation brands much better buy if you want to be in this space.
Which company is Molson going to buy into? Any inside?
Topo Chico is flying off the shelves. Not sure though the financial benefit for coors and how it might be hurting Vizzy. Have to say though my favorite now is vizzy lemonade
"WOW, Q2 and especially Q3 is going to be INSANE if this was the result during Q1."
Hey Ozzie. Let's see if you're singing the same tune on 2/12 when earnings are reported. Another quarter where share and volume decreased and share price drops 3 to 5 %. I hope ur right but history says you're wrong.
"I live in Denver and went to an event last night that was called the Denver Burger Battle - with 20 restaurants competing for the title ""Best Burger in Denver"" No in the city of Coors Field (home of the Rockies MLB) and International HQ for TAP in"
I see this easily hitting $61
Tapped out junk. Sell.
Pure suffering. SABMiller made a brilliant move selling out to ABInBev. Cashing out at the high. Both ABInBev and Molson Coors have been suffering since the acquisition closed.
WoW! Did someone blow-up the Rocky Mountains?
Dow up 350.....TAP is RED. What a POS
Not a single analyst upgrade can be found. What is bunny talking about. All I can find are downgrades for MC going back 8 months. One was a double downgrade.
Has TAP ever had 2 green days in a row? LOL. POS.
"What happened did they start locking up Thad and his manipulators in Jail if not they soon will LOL,LOL Their action or orders to sell are all recorded LOL,LOL everyone for the last 4 years all the data is there to put them away for years . Just like they did that manipulator from JPM LOL,LOL"
Here til we hit $50
"Ok. Looks like this PIg just bottomed this week. The short squeeze is goignn to start slowly, should gather steam in a week or two. Will shoot up violently when short realize the gig is up on this PIG."
Eye poping results!
Biggest POS on the market.
"wow, only 2 peeps viewing this board..does anyone out there think it will go UP tomorrow?"
More layoffs? Furloughs? Another plant closing? Sales down drastically even when compared to slide encountered by direct competitors? Lots of rumblings all pointing to more terrible news and stock price cratering. May be good that it happens as it should speed the sacking of the entire management team which is already long overdue.
"There is only 1 Thad and that would be me. @See is right on the money, though. This company has a management team made up of dinosaurs lining their pockets with shareholders money. We can chat after next earnings call in less than 2 weeks. Bet u TAPs numbers will lag compared to industry. Dividend cut coming soon. Bank it!"
At 43 look for BTI to take a stake
Water is cheaper and pot gets the buzz why spend for beer . $55.55 will be on TAP here sorry to say
"This stock is cheap, add to it"
This share is loser share
"Buy low, sell high. Buy 33 sell 40+. Easy Peasy."
i c a $25 stock pretending to be a $30 security
see you all next summer
That coca cola deal sure fizzled out after the terms were leaked. TAP has always negotiated horrible deals. Will hurt TAP in the long run. TAP taking on all the financial risk in the deal with little upside even if the product is successful. just a diversion to take eyes off the upcoming terrible earnings call. so sad.
"I love TAP and KHC, time to shift to the second gear"
Where'd Broke Millions go???? Would love to see him pop up after the earnings call.
@summer have bought to high. Sorry for you. but this stock will go up. look @BUD
Down over $4 pre-market. Earnings were horrible.
Molson makes more money on retail formats vs on premise and also owns majority of Truss Beverages with Hexo....expecting nice positive surprises next 2 quarters.....the forward valuation offers way more upside vs downside risk.
I hope you all bought some with me at $33.18 yesterday
I bet TAP makes announcement about their joint venture with HEXO (TRUSS BEVERAGES) to start selling Beverages in Colorado this ER.
Down to $35 by early next week.
"Holding this until lows 50s, but there has to be a little correction in the short term. This stock has been going up every single day for the past week"
TAP 4 cents away from falling below the price before last Thursdays earnings report. I told you so. Bow down to me!! TAP could be the most mismanaged company in history of the beer industry. Until management team is sacked it will be same as the past 6 years. #DefundTAPManagementTeam
You will see Gianni. You know I'm right. Back in the $30s soon. Horrible management team. Bottom going to fall out soon. LOL LOL LOL
Guess what? Another day RED! PO$ TAP
Tap is up on a market down day. Means insitutions starting to cover their shorts quietly.
Oh. Looks like Tap is up on a market down day 2 days in a row. looks like some big players are covering shorts. The BIG short squeeze is getting closer. ONce it pops it won't stop. now is the time to accumulate. don't wait until its at 37
https://mobile.twitter.com/TheRock/status/1364714087414861827To the moon!
Earnings beat here people
SAM is nearly double the market cap of TAP now. Never in my wildest dreams did anyone see this coming. TAP management must be replaced.
wow ABIO will go up to 60 % today!
"I started following ""awesomestokcalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
"I think @R has lost at life. That's why he lashes out. It's ok @R, the world needs ditch diggers too."
"@Edward, they did not cut dividend. on the earnings call they briefly mentioned the do not believe there will be any change to the dividend which makes me fearful because I believe they just threw that information out there and it was not prompted by a specific question. you can listen to a replay of the earnings call on their website. I suggest u listen. very eye opening. I think late entry into seltzer will be very expensive and have little return."
Sweet. Eat that CFRA.
Boom!
"that's why all the wallstreet analysts have downgraded TAP to ""sell"" huh @R? LOL"
"Opening up play with 30-50% near term upside due to beaten down valuation, in my opinion. Has become one of my top by last few weeks...."
Anyone buying hexo?
why is Bud up? Tap not?
Simple Wall street also upgrades it with a more than double target price.
TAP-A is up 27.40% to 63.70
I'm just amazed at this stock. How do you screw up selling Beer.? Hopefully it will go up sometime in my lifetime.......lol.
"TAP bagholders since the shooting at Coors brewery, read what happens in the industry, organized mafia with judges and politicians on the roll , biggest STZ Ponzi unfolding... judges from Rochester NY blocked arbitration as requested by STZ in NY in contradiction to their forged severance were they agreed on arbitration in NY, .so that they could lodged civil and criminal charges in California....lol.....in breach of Sarbanes Oxley.....lol .....What kickbacks the judges got to cover up the con???....years later they the judges and US gov invoke PLO cases lack of jurisdiction defence .....lol......what a scam !!!!the employee caught them with a bogus severance written not by the employer lol and cooked books by racist pigs. 40 or so judges over a 18 years to hide it."
Two analyst downgrades in the past 2 weeks and Ryan and Gianni scream BUY!! Now that's some funny stuff. This stock is a classic value trap. Until management team is replaced this stock is dead. They are grasping at straws and making desperation moves. Much better value plays than this dog. Company is run by dinosaurs using a playbook from the 1980's.
give 35$
Congrats to the (Mis)Management Team in reaching a fresh 600 week low.
What’s up with post market action to the upside? What’s the news?
"Bunny, you are delusional. In line brands continue to lose volume and share at an alarming rate. Increased marketing and development spend is not helping as it is being used in an inefficient and ineffective manner. I'm worried that the dividend isn't safe and may be cut. Need completely new management team. until then this stock will continue to lag. Dinosaur of a company and management team spells disaster for investors"
Silent rumors board shopping for a new CEO and management team. If new executive leadership team comes in expect BIG changes . All for the better in my estimation. If current leadershipe team is sacked then the sky is the limit!!!
TAP stock price will be $29 by the end of the month. BANK IT!!
Dilly dilly!!
Why is this working its way down all the time..some people drink this beer right now at home.
TAP is up 5.61% to 36.50
The whispers were only in your head Thad
this drop today is a fake out. Going to trick the shorts. This is the beginning of the short squeeze. start loading the boat on shares and call options. will be at 45 by christmas when people start drinking for the holidays and new years.
Has this been beaten enough to buy a little bit? What say you?
Turd of a company. Lost management team. It will get slaughtered after this release with sales tanking.
"Correct me if I'm wrong but TAP has made a lot of seemingly good deals recently from getting into cannabis via Truss beverages, Coke, Yuengling, and are focussing on premiumizing their brands and adding newer beverage styles from Seltzers, trendy beer brands, etc etc. Isn't all this signs that the company is awakening up and turning around? Isn't this different compared to when the stock was $70 etc?? Why isn't the SP reacting and climbing higher? What am I missing?"
can't stay near 52 weeks low. Bullish at that price
"I just love how Thad comes out after 6 months when this stock is trading 30% higher and tells everyone ""I told you so"". Buddy you know damn well this is the only quarter you're not going to sound stupid, because covid 19 is only going downhill from here, and this baby generated 1.1 billion of free cashflows during a full year of lockdowns. You don't need to be a genius to know sales and profits are going to be insanely better going forward. How did it feel to see TAP going higher and higher everyday while you told everyone it was overvalued?"
"Dow up 100, TAP down. Miserable PO$ stock."
up in pre market..will it possibly get to 1 year est of 43?
is it considering essential?
"I sold my TAP position ahead of the August earnings report. Bought it back today. I like the company a lot, but the bizarre swings in the stock have made it a predictably profitable ""trade"" for me. It's market just never seems to find footing. I like that in a trade stock!"
SRMX just announced it's venture into the pot industry today

Up 50 freaking cents. What a POS. Red by EOD
"In 2016, Molson Coors acquired the full global brand portfolio of Miller Brewing Company for approximately US$12 billion. Now you pay 10 billions dollar, an amount less than the acquisition, and get the original Molson free. From 2016 to 2020, TAP has paying off the essentailly the mortgage loan with earning before tax., 5 years have gone by in reducing the mortgage, rationalize the operations and increase products to beverage in maximize utilization of modernized plant. The mortgage is about to pay off, Boom, the free cash flow will take off. I look forward to the mortgage free day and growing the Free Cash generated again. The best COVID recovery stock with lots of weak craft brewery had to shut down for good that cannot compete with the scale and financial flexibility. The end result is that TAP will continue exercise its market dominating position. Its is an over 100 dollar stock still on sales."
"i do not trade TAP. it is providing great risk adjusted return. Listen to Peter Gramham. In the short term, it is a voting game. In the long term, it is a weighting game. The moat of TAP and free cash generating capabilities has not changed a bit."
Love this management incompetence. Top tier. Getting closer to $35.
Another day. Another downgrade for TAP. When will this horrible management team be replaced?!?!?!?!!!!
Stock price of $44 to 46 by mid january. Bank it!
"This is typical manipulation of stock. Despite great earnings and outlook of TAP, someone provides his analysis to sell it, causing panic sell to unbelievable levels. These days trading is done based on those puppets LOL. TAP will be up next Q."
i'm in. I see few profits ahead
How come SAM skyrocketed and FIZZ and STZ do very well and even BUD is well above it's March low but TAP is still at March lows?
up up up
Summer+Nati+Peter= three peas in a pod? The hot air in the pod is bursting.
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.92% to 46.30
"Hoping for a miracle at this point. Hopefully with the CBD water and a good earnings report, I can make some money."
Our only hope as shareholders is a hostile takeover for 15-20 billion.
"Between the Topo Chico release, the strong Vizzy product and Blue moon Sky light, this may be the cheapest stock with strong tail winds."
hey Thad ...horribly managed company? up 8 % today!
Forward price to earnings of 11 and majority ownership of Truss beverages with leadership in RTD Cannabis space.
"Is anyone suing them over their creative accounting? I thought by now there would be an announcement of a Hexo infused beer. Got to find out what I paid for this underperformer. If it were not for the dividend I’d probably be in the red. Our neighborhood liquor beer store says they raised the prices dramatically a couple months ago. The Indian fellow was complaining. Stockholders, we are really gamblers, should get a free case of the product for hanging in there. All while they mismanage things."
please dont let that stop u from buying. I've been holding for years and need an uptick in price so I can get out without taking too much of a bath. buy this stock so I can get out. please.
"A letter I sent to Corporate via email a couple days ago What the H*ll is going on with your company? Your stock price has taken a cr*pper!!And it's clear why- NO NEW products. Last night on TV, AB was advertising 2 new Bud Light beers (lime and orange) and a new Michelob 'Pure Gold' - while you guys ran an ad for the same ol Coors #$%$! Do you REALLY think that's all it takes to gain back market share??? Oh yeah, you geniuses are down 40% on YOY growth - BRILLIANT!! Just keep running the old products with new ads - that's SURE to fix it!Get innovative! Get savvy!! Maybe Buy out Modelo? Christ - WAKe UP!! Otherwise it's clear that management doesn't give a #$%$ about it's future or it's shareholders! Thanks a Lot!"

"Golden - essentially a Suburb on Denver - Goes which of the BIG Brewers was there for PR/Marketing with a crowd of 2000 young people that could be reached for beer sales? Yup! You guessed it! It was Budweiser! In #$%$ Coors Backyard! TAP marketing and management are CLUELESS and asleep at the wheel - no wonder this POS stock is doing nothing! Oh, sorry I'm wrong - it's going DOWN!!"
Just click on the yahoo 5-year chart for tap. It has gone from $112 to about $50. AND just think about what the broader market has done in those 5 years! You could have picked a wining stock by throwing a dart! But you are stuck with tap.

Something is going on here
Take a look at all the insider rat sales before the news.......
"@Bunny, yes Vizzy is coming to town and that makes me very scared for this company. Read analysts report - MC late to hard seltzer market and this product is doomed. Here's what many think will happen with Vizzy: Big money invested in the brand only to find out launching late into market has headwinds that con not be overcome by uncreative marketing and feckless management team. Let's chat again 6 months post Vizzy launch. Management at MC must go before this co has even a chance to turn it around. bunch of dinosaurs just throwing random ideas out while lining their pockets as they ruin a once great company. BOD wake up!!!!"
so they are doing a deal with hydropothecary
"With no dividend, all income/dividend funds have to sell. It is as simple as that. What’s the big surprise here??"
Sweet bottoming tail candle from yesterday
Pete Najarian sees unusual option trading activity in Molsen Coors Beer.
"My biggest mistake this year was not going all in on this stock, TAP had no business being in the 30s. Shame on me for not loading up harder on Q3 earnings"
This is an easy buy. People everywhere are buying beer bottles to make molotovs.
"Luke, come out! I told you we don’t have to wait long to sniff you pumper out! You are just like bunny. Gets pounded over and over by your own imagination. This thing is written all over the wall and yet some people here don’t see it. You are not investors. You are gamblers. Your words “beer sales are up and up” as if you know the data before every body else or is it you guessing in your mind? Off premise sales are never going to replace the loss from on premise sales. Do you even know what that sentence means? Like me tell you one more little piece of the trade. What is the largest on-premise account for Molson Coors? I know you don’t know. You don’t need to pretend. The answer is MIller Park and Coors Field. With that answer you think about huge consequences of the upcoming baseball season or lack of it.That’s called beer business acumen and an investment research."
P/e is super low and it pays a dividend. They have tons of cash and are exploring new markets. Dunno why in the world this is down today.
Im like the main poster on this board. i guess its my board now and I own it. I will put my flag here on monday. Ill be the chat room cop too. I am queen of the turd stock.
TAP is down 6.67% to 38.21
Watch the number of people in the TAP forum grow.
Beer store monopoly is ending and great for beer sales
Earning actually increased in constant currency term

"If you at smart, you would treat this technical move up from 33’s to 35’s (maybe a little higher) as an opportunity to get out."
Selling below 1 times sales....BUD is 3X that yet Coors Light and Bud Light essentially the same liquid......for those looking for entry take advantage of the entry point (wish I had waited....I bought at this price 5 months ago!!)
"BBBY short squeeze was pretty good, up 400% this year.Bear in mind high short ratio that fuels high institutional ownership is bullish.Shorting stock in sister funds can increase long position and goose returns in flagship funds, effectively transferring wealth from the sister fund to the flagship fund.Thats why short ratio is still high, the wealth transfer is still in play."
Back to 50
this stock is a loser stock. it does nothing.
Guess what guys.... $30 after earnings report.

"The greatest force known to man is not power, but that of pleasure. No need to worry with one's Investments here, for this is pleasure of the liquid form."
This ship is changing direction.
This stock is such a dog. Trying to get out of it but just need a little higher stock price to sell off and kiss good by. Happy to lose 8% just to not have to shudder at feckless management decisions. Do you guys still have half of your middle and upper management team working from home? TAP the country club of the beer brewing industry. That should be their new motto.
Tap follows GE more than the spy
"The problem with TAP is management. Until all management from VP's to CEO are replaced u had better invest in another adult beverage company. Even for a long term play. BTW, I think we can all agree that @R is a moron. LOL"
March towards 100 can be expected..... The doubling of revenue & volume from 2016. The stock price should double from where it was in 2016. The surge is just the beginning.
@R seems really desperate. lol
share price will bottom at $57 to 58 and not regain growth for at least 18 months. still a bloated US organization even after the announced reduction in employees. 350 is a good start. a lot more needed.
"TAP already downplaying their 3rd quarter numbers to be released at the end of October. OMG, could this company get any worse???!!! I'm a 5 year bag holder and we need a management house cleaning here. Board of Directors PLEASE DO SOMETHING!"
Bought at $36.87 - Small pump at the being of each day then back down. May exit if we get to $37 and wait for a better entry.
another plant closing and a reduction of dividend on the horizon. bank it!
"I stand with my prediction that TAP will need to Close another brewery in the near future. Volume is just not there to support it. To keep up with the dividend payout, they have to cut cost. It is a shrinking business. Main reason stock is not moving anywhere."
This is so crazy to watch TAP continue to push higher. All I’ve seen it do for the past 4 years is continue to go lower. Hopefully the trend is here to stay. The valuation is still very CHEAP.
Budweiser will now gain huge market share in Colorado and across the US Rockies and west.

"urgent change is needed and current CEO unwilling to make the moves needed. True cost cutting is needed. Chop the bloat of executive positions. Look at the human resources, finance and even marketing org charts. way too many people in silos. Run lean and efficient like competitors. getting rid of people actually enhances communication. less bureaucratic processes. TAP is 20 years behind the competition. This company is dead until completely new management is brought in."
$39 after 1st quarter earnings are reported. Bank it!
"Scary, we are green again..."
"@Bunny. Hello? we are still waiting for you to provide us with the ""three analysts big upgrades for TAP"". All we have been able to find for the last 8 months are downgrades and one DOUBLE DOWNGRADE. Were you making the up? please respond."
Why is this up 6% in pre market?
"TAP and Miller Coors are the Department of Motor vehicles of the beer industry. No one ever quits because there is no accountability, everyone works from home and are protected if the massively screw up. Had any action been taken on the ""accounting/financial errors"" that has spawned massive class action law suit and caused a restatement of earnings going back 2 years? No. They probably promoted the vp of finance."
added more this morning. WONT go down forever.
"Truss, the Companys Canadian cannabis joint venture, has quickly become a market share leader of ready-to-drink cannabis beverages in Canada we estimate a market share of over 50% in key markets, such as Quebec."
Institutional investors bought $436M worth of TAP shares and sold only $142M. ++$294M in 1.5 month.
"down, guess some are not celebrating today"
"Coors Miller are iconic brands like- Briggs and Stratton, Sears, Kmart, and Schlitz, and Pearl. Have faith and hang in there, management is managing the best they can."
My 5k shares I bought at 51.35 sure is looking good 
Coors will be back over $65.75 by Friday
Hexo will save this stock
This stock is out of the Weeds!
TAP involved with Hexo now they should look at Curaleaf. This Cannabis expanding all over the country.
WORLDWIDE VOLUME DROPED BY 4.7%!! Enough said. Shrinking again!
"BUNNY - stock is at $54!!!’ The more you pump the more it goes down. It’s been going down every time you post. Post all the nonsense you have in your sleeves. The stock price tells the story everyone sees but you. It is $54!!! It is clear if there is ever anyone listening, no one believes you."
I am a buyer now. Raised the dividend. It will be back to $55 shortly. I think. And if not I don't mind getting paid to wait.
"Molson Coors Beverage Company (TAP)RICH RATING = 118,88220 up = STRONG BUY195-219 = BUY150-194 = HOLD130-149 = UNDERPERFORM129 down = SELL"
"CVS is the Darling as i mentioned and as a bargain as KHC, TAP.. They provided more ammunition in consumer staple sector for the secular rise"
BUYING 10000 SHARES NEAR THE 52 WEEK LOW- STOCK IS CHEAP
Why's she up today when everything else is down?
I sold.
"Had some Coors beer yesterday. It is not bad testing at all (I am an IPA person Terrapin IPA is usually I have it occasionally and it is very good) I think Miller is equivalent to bud light.Have not had their seltzer products yet, but heard they are good.So I would think products are not an issue here."
Molson Coors Beverage is up 7.88% to 41.34
cheers!
"Please please go down to 41-42, i'll just dump the rest of my portfolio in. Easy 60$ target by June-July. Management doing a fantastic job, free cashflow has been great during the pandemic and even prior."
No more Miller Park!
"@Richard in tumultuous times like these I look for companies with solid, innovative management teams with a proven track record. The last 5 years of this team has been abysmal in a good market! Do u trust this team to shepherd the company through these times. If u think objectively the only answer you can come up with is a firm and resounding NO!"
"Thad, I see many parallels between TAP and STZ, STZ has been in litigation since 2002 on a wrongful termination, TAP with a mass shooting and few dead people rip.....there is something very bad and ugly under the veil"
"The biggest problem for TAP now becomes that they replaced the CEO with the worst possible person they could. They promoted the President of USA operation to CEO and he had single handedly ruined the US division. It's the worst performing division in TAP. I hear since he took over, US division had been run like a country club. Most directors and above working from home. Dogs barking and kids crying on all conference calls. I hear it's an inside joke. This is the guy they choose to be the new CEO!? Need completely new blood in US division and at the global headquarters."
Thoughts and prayers with everyone at the Milwaukee office. So sad. So senseless!
Trimmed at 68. Looks like resistance. Will buy cheaper.
Could be deep red today. Time to buy more maybe
"While other pot related stocks move up and down like someone flushing a toilet, this one is a gem. I laugh all the time thinking back to the 70’s. No one I knew of ever smoked a joint without having a beer with it. Also having a Canadian history, it only stands to reason that Canadians will invest with Coors. So glad that I saw this opportunity early on for infused drinks. Heard that Coke has completely abandoned pot based drinks."
Short sellers on suicide watch. You have to be an idiot to bet against a stock with a wide moat trading at a forward P/E of 8 and p/FC of 7
Finally some nice volume today!
Seems like with people spending so much time at home drinking a cold one and shopping on ETSY for patinaed zippos and patinaed artwork that this would trade higher.
This PO$ will be RED by end of day
"We believe TAP will test support at Dec. 24 low at $55 and change. If that fails, look out. A ton of investors are in this at higher levels and will be involved in the coming class action litigation. Damages could run high. Do your own DD."
Upgrade revision by analyst. The analyst is catching up with upgraded earnings. Long way to go up as money is flowing in.
should have listened to a good friend and avoided this stock. live and learn.
Molson Coors Beverage is down 6.41% to 45.84
Vizzy is coming to town
"@Jdiaz Talk to Bunny. He's been saying that for 6 years and all the while TAP stock lost 52% of its value before the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic began. Dinosaur management team, dying industry and country club corporate culture = run far away from this company until entire management team is replaced. Vizzy is bombing. Have they had a successful product launch in the past 6 years? NO! Good luck with this stock. You're going to need it."
I'm scared for the entire hospitality industry covid is coming back hard . Hopefully market won't turn on this and hit a new lower price. Almost hit lowest 52 week price this week 
"I’d say we’re in position for a surprise. I’m sympathetic to management issues. But retail has likely consumed more low cost alcohol during this time, partially offsetting largely down commercial sales. Estimates may be overly pessimistic. Check out TAP and BUD afterhours. Somethings up!"
"You can't loose with alcohol. Its very, very addictive..."
The amount of beer being sold in Canada during this pandemic is mind blowing. Huge shift from micro brew to Molson brands.
TAP shows its attractiveness in a volatile market with its stable earnings and income regardless of the outlook of economy. Consumer staple is much better than high flying stocks
anyone hearing any news about potential Heineken tie up with TAP? Been very quiet.
Have we hit a bottom?
Thad sounds like someone who sold at the bottom
It is pretty simple. You either pay a dividend or show growth. The only the reasons people invest. And tap has none. It is not that complicated.
TAP is down 4.95% to 61.01
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 51.83
"Your about to witness a short squeeze by the likes of which you haven't seen in a long, long time."
i cant beleive 3 days before ER and this caca is down...maybe that should tell us all something!!!
Looks like the short squeeze isstarting. this time is going to be different.
Kinda think this is a good company.
"My friend orders beer for a very large distributor. They ask for 25,000 cases of beer from Coors and are told they can only get 5,000. This has been on going for months now. He said they sold a plant in California last year and have been way behind ever since. Management denies there's a problem, but the fact is they are only providing 1/5th of what is requested. If I were you, I'd chose wisely on what to do with this stock. No, I'm not short or own any. Just passing along good info."
"Horribly managed company. overpaid for the US buy out of Miller Coors. will never achieve synergies they thought. US management team teams in human resources, finance and sales are a joke. no accountability and lax oversight. more like a hobby for these vp's and directors than a job. Most work from home."
"Under book value, I'm in!"
"Short % of the float is now over 8%, wow. You have to be really dumb to be shorting a company with such a brand and moat, trading at a such a high free cashflow yield. The short squeeze is going to be epic whenever it comes."
How is this thing gonna open up with missed earnings and already outreaching its steady pace?
Well I didn't buy yet. Maybe at 40.
"The bull thesis is a cash flow story. Too many people are addicted to growth at whatever cost these days—grab a beer, chill. The comps will get easier heading into FH21 and sales will undoubtedly recover with the reopening of restaurants. The real question is: can the co satisfy its debt obligations in time to fully realize the incredible cash flows. If not, co will need to divest of assets, which dilutes expected future cash flows. Like I said in an earlier post a TAP short position pairs perfectly with a SAM long— classic long/short hedge fund strategy— this trade is super stretched. I expect a mean reversion heading into end of year. Shares will also get a little help if management can assuage debt holder worries by delivering incremental Q/Q improvement across all metrics with sustainable guidance."
New 52 week high coming soon!! Drink up!!
This is going to get ugly again...but what do you expect ? They say $55.55 or lower
No management accountability. This is how they role at MoronCoors. I'm sure all are still being paid full salaries plus bonuses while the the company has tanked for years and even faster this year. No hope.
LOL. Down a buck . POS!
Looking to buy around 56
Yahoo took off my post!! - I sold ALL my shares yesterday - couldn't take the steady LOSS over the last 2 years (and I am a LONG term holder/investor) This company has NO clue what to do to turn around their slide and TAP's latest P/E and EPPS is WAY WAY too high and low compared to their peers (check out BUD). I'm an investor - but after averaging down over 2 years - I had to throw in the towel and take and significant LOSS! :( Buying PUTS now to try and get some of my $$$ back.

The result of acquiring Aspall should show up positively in next earning. ....The growth and expansion to UK is very positive
"price/book value is less than one. the company is not bankrupt and this as irrational as the FAANG stocks and their ridiculous valuations. I'm not a long, but I bought the 52 week low and will sell when the the the p/b ratio is back at 1"
"Hallmark of a company that is in distress-does not participate in market rally, but participated in market correction. Low confidents by shareholders.Plus side is that as the share price dives, you will begin to see offers to buy the company out sooner. I personally think this company this company is worth 40 per share buy out if only for the cash flow for a while."
How easy it is for a company to lose money (using actual accounting principles) and even when they use imaginary numbers...they still miss expectations...AND THE STOCK PRICE CONTINUES TO GO UP??? My small company produced more cash profit than Coors did last year.
will close below $47 day before earnings call then bottom will fall out. earnings will look ok but there will be another quarter of decreased volume and they will try to spin Vizzy as a positive but a good look at numbers will show Vizzy is an early failure. then the stock will sink. Bank It!!
When do the Truss beverages get released? Canada wants to go Higher.
Dow up over 100.....TAP down.....LOL. Such a POS
Tap shines with its stable income and growth even the market is jittering
"Wow, this board if full of shorters. Can wait to see you squeeze soon!"
"Devision.A dropped yesterday, i think it will affect this devision soon."
After reading the article it was clear that Hexo partnered with the wrong #$%$ beverage company. Molson Coors had driven their own stock price down for 6 years all during an unprecedented bull market through botched product launches and inept management. Now they bring that track record to Hexo?! You've convinced me to buy any marijuana stock that ISN'T Hexo!!!
This is probably a better investment than airlines or hotels 1000% no one can disagree bull or bear LOL
"Lol, one just need to read the earning presentation to know that TAP projects Earn more, cost less, strategy in trimming the merger left fat that will save 200 millions per year on top of Pressurization is working well on top of the 1.4 billions +- 10% free cash flow generation. Add more shares for the projected double digit growth going forward"
A tall cold one sounds pretty good right now.
tariffs...no deal with Canada?
Don’t fight the tape. What’s that now? 5 up days?
"The lipstick will soon fade on this pig. Managements inept decisions over 6 full years will not be easily overcome, even if an entire new management team is brought in immediately. New management that is willing to institute austerity policies and make bold decisions is needed NOW!! Board of Directors WAKE UP!!! This company isn't a country club!! it's a business with shareholders. No accountability here! NONE! I wish I would have never bought this stock!!! No turnaround plan in place. Just throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks. Like the ridiculous coca cola deal. coke exec's will be laughing all the way to the bank. they get all the reward and TAP has all the risk. Why is TAP so foolish. Replace the management team NOW!!!"
Down in Canada up in the US.Has TAP ever done a share buyback?
I expect sub par earnings but it doesn't matter. Buy at 50.
Dow up...TAP down...... EVERY FN DAY
"Glad they cut the dividend to zero. And still, they are drowning. Get it together TAP!!"
The worst stock in the entire market = TAP

"I’m not familiar coots business is there any reason why this stock has been in decline since 2017, have millennials become teetotalers, or is coots just sucking?"
The market is sleeping 
with Bill gone i think TAP is positioning itself to sell in 2019

Coors could learn from Constellation Brands made $700 million invested in Canopy. Coors need ACBFF or APHQF. Don't miss the boat Coors.

is it true TAP will be the manufacturer and distributor of top chico hard seltzer?
House of cards. Value trap with $10 B debt.
Looks like shoppers will be able to pick this one up in the 20's real soon. Brutal.

Molson Coors Beverage reached a 52 Week low at 46.00
looks like the beginning of the short sqeeze. This is where FOMO will help you if you don't hesitate./
"Let's take a look at the TAP management team chickenstick. They drove share price down over 47% during the unprecedented 5 year bull run prior to the pandemic. Same management team in place. same desperation deals being made to prop up the company (coca cola...). Finance team plays fast and loose with the numbers (had to restate 2 years of earnings and class action law suits because of it). Volume and share of core brands continue to shrink and we celebrate when we reduce the velocity of volume decline!!! I could go on and on. Foolish deals that are one sided against us and will cannibalize our seltzer share. I'm afraid this company is dead until completely new management is brought in. Until then, expect more of the same dismal results and share price erosion. Maybe a couple more layoffs and an additional plant closing."
What's the story with truss?
Unbelievable........lol
"Boston Beer up 20% today and big time for the year. When you hire the right CEO it makes a difference. MolsonCoors missed the opportunity to hire him and this is where it stands...a 60+ week low. So, don't blame COVID next week. Just hire the right management team."
"Barring a buy out, if sells volume does not show a turn-around, I don’t see this stock reaching $70 again."
"Remember 6 days ago when Thad said that because the stock was down -2%, it was the beginning of an erosion? Back at almost 53$ now with a 13.33% short float. The squeeze is going to be epic in the summer."
TAP is RED on a huge up day. LOL. PO$
Where's Gianni? stock going down below share price prior to recent earning report. Gianni!! Where are you?????
"Terrible results, terrible call & message. These guys don't have a clue"
"Man, the last months were hard..."
Poke through long term resistance now. Very bullish.
2 upgrades thank you
"I think we're at or close to the peak for the rest of 2020 volumes are slowing down. Don't see market fundamentals improving from here. Election is over. Vaccine price boost is over. Now in lameduck session and 130,000 cases per day and increaseing with bars and restaurants almost guaranteed to face closures."
Positive results from technical analysis.
"seems like every message board for every value stock has same idea. EVeryone thinks is going to be the next gamestop. Problem now is that everyone knows about it and unless everyone sells all tech stocks and puts money into all value stocks then going to be hard to find out which one going to the moon. Unless they all go to the moon, which is possible."
"Given management and the awful state of the beer market, I think you should be looking at $35 or below before you even consider buying into this dumpster fire. I will. Too many other places to put your money and better beer to drink."
TAP is down 4.95% to 49.88
I reiterate. This stock will be in the$30's by end of June if not sooner. Horrible management team. Don't end up being another TAP bag holder chump.
"Back to $60 in 3 weeks, heavy calls on that"
Wow. Up a whole buck. PO$
is it the $10 bill debt.?
"Wow, be strong "
they just how this will explode. It just went down 4
the company blog is really good to follow whats going on with companyhttp://www.millercoorsblog.com/
"This stock is oversold...I couldn't care less about what big money or Wall Street or the algos are doing...The more this stock drops, the more I buy.Good management, great distribution network, and an opportunity to hold a marquee defensive stock at a very reasonable price!"
"These posts are depressing, guess I won’t buy any, looking for a solid dividend stock"
"Tap is back to its long term up trend support line of the long term chart. Fundamentally, you can hardly buy a beer stock at P/E 8 with its stable predictable income"
All my other stocks are pretty much down today except this one. This stock amuses me.......lol.
@john I agree. Another problem the company has from what I hear is there on NO accountability and they protect their own. Especially in the US division. The place is run more like a hobby as opposed to a business. There seems to be no set hours for white collar workers. people arrive and leave their offices at leisure. So many just work from home. Very different when all were expected to be in the office for 8 hours every week day. Sloppiness and no accountability now prevail. Sad to see what this company has become.
"I own a bar/liquor store in the Rocky Mtn region. Miller & Coors just raised wholesale prices by 5%. Bud did not. Miller stuff barely sells but Coors/Coors Light does well but now they are more expensive than Bud across the board, including on tap in the bar. Doesn't seem like the best strategy in a flat to declining market..."
I'll be ready to buy the dip when they report on Feb. 12th. More volume declines and poor performance. Nothing in the short term that should be pushing this stock up other than the algos working overtime.
HAHA THIS IDIOT TOM.
"Tap is okay. I basically performs with the market. It's cheap, pays down debt every year and is streamlining operations. They now have production lines that operate on demand from the field and can switch brews anytime."
uh oh. MC earnings call coming on 12 February. Like the last 2 years will it be more volume and share decrease? Worried. Very worried.
tesla is prolly the way to go. thats where the growth is
Are there anyone here received the dividend of TAP stock on 3/15/18 yet?
People and investors can see a buy tonight will get wiped out tomorrow morning . Someone wants this lower and it surely will . I hope that $155.55 wasn't a slip flash
Still short
"Glad I own GE, TAP and UNFI."
this board is so quiet. you've got a thad and gianni love affair...and nothing else. holding up at 44 like someone trying to beat the rock in arm wrestling. not selling!
"if this goes to sub 50$, I'll jump back in, it'll be free money"
"Another tailwind for TAP in beer consumption for the very hot summer season in US. 2019 may be the hottest year yet spurred by a likely El Niño as well as climate change, the planet is expected to heat up even more, warmed by scientists"
"""...TAP is very, very cheap and we are hard pressed to give a good upside target here as it may seem fantastic. At the minimum we think that a 12X EV to EBITDA makes sense. Once the debt target is achieved, that would translate into a $95 price (Market Cap of $20.60B, Net Debt of $9.4B & EBITDA of $2.5B).That is a 62% upside here on a large consumer staples stock. Even Anheuser Busch (BUD) is trading at a 11X EV to EBITDA after cutting its dividend and having a 2019 projected debt to EBITDA of 4.7X. We had previous identified this stock as a ""top-pick"" for 2019, but we believe we just heard TAP say, ""Hold my beer"". ..."" Source SeekingAlpha"
TAP-A is down 5.95% to 60.90
gotta be ready to jump sometime soon
Zaks consensus estimate for MC earning on Thursday had moved downward twice in the past week. Get ready for the carnage.
InBev will eventually buy out KO to rule the beverage world. Just watch.
Looks cheap. Heading higher
"Bought today at 33.5, thought I was getting a deal. Already holding a bag. lol but this is a long term play for me. Alcohol and MJ will always be consumed......will add more if it breaks 30."
"Just dropped a toe in on this one. If nothing more, it allows me to justify drinking a little more after work."
Shorts attach will soon arrived.
"They have growth in their terrapin brand who’s cornered the market for weed-flavored beers in the southeast. Unfortunately, many other brands are restaurant dependent, which makes this a quasi reopen trade. Although, 2nd quarter profits/cash flows definitely didn’t disappoint with strong DTC resurgence. Deeep value around these levels. I took a bite today."
Jeeeeeesh.........How low will we go?????
Wow I’ve owned this for a long time. Seems the only time up after earnings lol
"Warren Buffett is looking for elephant size acquisition. Tap is the kind of staple business he can understand with predictable free cash flow, moat in oligopoly market. Hope he will put in the offer soon than later."

Where did Thad go?
"hexo is tanking..cfo left , who in hades invests big money in these shark tank flop companies !"
"i am a alcoholic , i drinks tones of this stuff. you are all safe"
"Great opportunity to buy the dip this morning. So many positive catalysts... bars re-opening, live sports coming back, ZOA crushing it, Topo Chico hard seltzer crushing it, dividend re-instated later this year, Coors Field hosting MLB all-star game."
"Let the excuses begin. COVID, weather, you name it. Saint Archer Gold a bust. Sol a bust. LA Libations a bust. Columbe hard coffee a bust. They will tell everyone Vizzy is a hit(only in their world). Just be honest....really bad management is the issue."
This is what you call pin action off STZ!
@Richard and Robert isn't there an impartial human resources department available to the employees at Miller/Molson Coors? Couldn't he have taken his grievances there?
Ceria Beer is a CBD infused beer company out of Colorado.He worked for Molson Coors Miller Cant you get a CBD product from Hexo and get a drink out in the market. A beer on TAP regardsmarshall
"It's going to take a lot more than cheap grain prices to turn this falling company around. look for continued falling share price, more lay offs, an additional plant closing or two and more no accountability attitude from management. Must have a complete transformation in culture. Will also need about 5 more years to get out from under the gross overpayment of the miller coors joint venture. put ur money into ABInbev or constellation brands if you are looking for an alcohol / cannabis play."
hydro is the winner
"Hugh insiders purchase in March gives me the feeling that great news are forth coming. With Motley Fool recommendations, other buyers are flocking in , 2 years MACD are trending upward."

It's the horrible management team!!!
forward P/E of 8 and free p/FC of 7. #$%$
Starting to look like GE’s chart. Uh-oh
STZ is a scam like all alcohol industry.
anyone know when the specifics of the Atwater Brewing Co purchase are to be released? Worried stock price will take another hit if analysts perceive MC overpaid. I'm hopeful they mix some of the mgt team from Atwater in as they seem to have a clue. Worried this purchase is another albatross though. If history is any indication we should all be worried.
Smart move Nati. dig into the numbers and volume still shrinking and shrinking faster than competitors. like prior earnings calls they get a nice pop early then people really dig into the numbers and stock closes below the pre call price. This management team must go!!
All bearish indicators on this stock are maxed out. Stock is in final bottoming process. One more flush to downside possible but not likely. Going to start slowly building higher then will start gapping up hard. This stock is almost being given away for free.
It is said a dead clock is right twice a day. BUNNY is wrong ALL the time. A dead clock has more credibility than BUNNY. Astonishing.
"DOL since 2002 dismissed 98-98% of Sarbanes Oxley claims, many claims dismisses using made up justifications from Constellation Brands SOX claims that are untrue.

all beverage stocks will recover where it was. just wait.
Hello
Very little pricing power. Bottom line
Slowly sliding.
TAP is up 5.69% to 40.22
Ended RED for the day. An absolute miserable PO$ stock.
is it considered an essential good
"Further volume decline, blamed on the pandemic. Partially true, it not all true. Spoke of rosy off premise sales increase at first. We knew that is true for every brewer. Bottom line is 4% volume decline still. Sounds like aggressively expanding non-beer portfolio. But non-proven get. Green shoot at best at this stage. Not a turn-around story yet. You may see a short term price pop as market maker will bring this up to make money from their share inventory. But it will wane down."
This should be down more than this. Thank goodness the market is booming today.

Where will this stock go short term?
Still pricy
Tap my girl
Does anyone know where this PIG is going this week. Im not sure if i should buy calls or puts. Made 60 bucks last week on calls. I can really use some extra money so i can get some new toys.
Molson Coors Beverage is up 6.97% to 39.29
TAP is up 4.92% to 43.91
TAP-A is down -8.40% to 60.00
Molson Coors Beverage reached a 52 Week low at 38.21
all stocks are down due to Coronavirus but TAP is getting hit so much worse than others. How come when the market is up TAP lags to th upside and when the market is down TAP LEADS to the downside? This stock is horrible.
Another week and ANOTHER analyst downgrade for TAP.
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 53.60
dividend is too small
"I will give somebody about $8 for their shares, that is all they are really worth! Get ready, down down down this stock will go with a price target under $10/share!"
dividend cut coming soon?
Just maybe the board will call the SEC to look into the group that is manipulating their stock . But they would have to do something as a board to make that happen. Most companies are clueless on how easy it is now for just a few firms on Wall Street working together to manipulate their stock both up or down with the new and improved Wall Street AI computer. you now don't even need to sell shares just place a order to sell. So the board just needs to track the orders place to sell and they will know which firms are manipulating their stock .
"well..... don't guess we ginna see 40, or 39, or 38 by ER.. ginna have to take a damn loss... tired of holding this caca."
and another down day. dipping a toe into infused beverage market when competitor effort there is 10 times the TAP play shows how weak and indecisive this co's leadership is. wont be buying any shares until current management is shown the door. United States operations at Miller Coors is even weaker. Time for a full house cleaning. TAP results over the past 2 years is pathetic compared to our peers. Change management NOW!
"rip , but most likely yet another wrongful termination gone bad in the alcohol industry, most likely shooter terminated by swat sniper team, case closed."
Back in the $30's by end of April. Bank it!
"TAP needs a major organization restructure like KO to rightsize the company with its business. Without any new product innovation, its at least two years before on-premise losses can be made up off-premise. There is a lot of fat in the company and times have changed. Could also reduce the office footprint in Chicago. Might able to get a slight positive bump in price. Let's see if they have the leadership to make this happen."
"In a very short time, gianni and others will realize they are the new crop of TAP bag holders. Congratulations! Well deserved! LOL LOL LOL"
If anyone on here hasn’t tried Vizzy it is a great drink.
@see and other morons were saying terrible earnings ahead and bearish. where are you hiding morons.?
Going to close RED
"I'm considering buying some stock at 37, but this company seems horribly run. Does anyone know why their earnings fell so much last year/quarter and the financial report I see actually says TTM loss?"
really hoping this crash and burns after earnings so I can buy more under 50$
I sold a chunk of my shares a couple days ago. getting back in slowly. This could be the start of a deeper correction.
TAP is down 11.70% to 37.58
"This is really a leadership issue. It is all about cost cutting, getting out of Europe and India and concentrate about US beer drinkers. And realize that MC is the only old large US brewery left - and tell the americans the fact. I think Gavin is too much of a nice guy. I doubt he can initiate the urgent change.."
"I think The Board should consider to divest european division"" In fact, Europe which accounted for only 16% of our revenue in 2020 contributed to 61% of revenue decline, and 83% of our EBITDA decline for the year, and 92% of the revenue decline and 56% of our EBITDA decline for the fourth quarter."""
Does ANYONE think this POS stock/company will recover to the previous 52 wk high? Or is this DEAD money and I should even consider taking my loss and bailing? Thoughtful comments only please TY
Wrongful termination at Coors ends in tragedy...mass shootings..... or targeted shooting....there is a difference.
Looks cheap
"I have a minor holding in TAP from last summer and will certainly own up to the fact that I do not keep a close enough eye on this name. We seem to have some decent strength/resilience lately. In your opinion, is this in sympathy for Boston Beer’s report, the relative value of TAP to broader market or something else? Hoping to hear more cannabis-infused products on the call. I know the boys behind Blue Moon are working on something for us. GL to you all and thanks for your insights"
this pig going to go sideways for 3 years. will reach a new all time high in 2031
"TAP stock price will be in the low 40's by late autumn. Next earnings report will be atrocious. TAP just received a double downgrade by analysts this morning. Hold on to your hats, this puppy is going down fast. Get new management please!! BOD wake up!!!"
Ok back in at 55.65 come on beer
Shorts seem to be having a hard time with the change in direction.
For 6 years TAP rises lower/slower than the general market and industry and falls deeper/faster. With no change in management or strategy it will continue to do the same.
TAP is up 6.68% to $62.10
"Hey all, what’s your opinion on private equity firms buying out TAP and taking it private or STZ or Bud making a buyout offer ? "
"Another day the Dow is up big, and TAP just keeps falling. I will be ecstatic when I can sell this miserable piece of junk stock"
TAP is down 6.16% to 36.24
"more than 70% of the companies listed on the market and including large oil companies such as EXXON mobil and many more cut their dividends or suspended them to conserve liquidity, it is normal in these months of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 and the closings of businesses and people staying at home made these companies decide to make these changes to protect themselves from the current situation and I think 100% that TAP did the right thing at the moment to compensate for the damage, I do not see why the news of TAP has fallen so badly To analysts or shareholders, this was a good temporary decision so that shareholders have less risk of losing any investment,,,,I am long and strong ,I see $47 in a month.good luck"
Big deal. Stock is at a 10+ year low. It would have to do this for about a month straight for most to get back to even.
Continue the rocket and it should double at least
"Stock benefitted with all others since the election, but when results matter you wont get it with this management team. All they do is push out the turnaround to the next year or two. been the case for many years."
Lack of pricing power is the main problem here
"No. Timid feckless management team failed to make decisive bold decisions in the shrinking beer industry and will be playing catch up to AB and constellation and the likes for years. Overpaying for US joint venture buy out is also going to continue to hurt the company. Look for more layoffs in the USA, another brewery closing and a dividend cut in the future. US operations will continue to be a drag on the organization. New leadership is needed."
There has not been a better time to buy TAP since April 2014................ Of course.....if you bought in April 2014..........you might not be very happy...........:o) but don't forget you got some dividends.
Turn those machines back on!
"Continue the ascending,"
$50 by Easter.
Investors do not like JV's - and cannibalizing products on the same shelf as well
"Does anybody know? With the new joint venture between Molson Coors and Hexo to make the stand-alone company of Truss, does this mean stock holders of the parent companies will translate to stocks in the stand-alone spinoff? Thanks!"
YOU WILL NOT DO THE RIGHT THING. SO DON'T EVEN TRY.
Consumption of beers will increase as consumers spending increases with full employment.
"As expected, TAP continues its appeal and people realize the attractiveness of this low beta, free cash generating machine with a great total risk adjusted return."
its showing up over a dollar in pre market at TD.. why not showing here on this site?
They havent even announced who they are holding accountable for the sloppy accounting and reporting practices that led to the major problem. VP of finance should be gone! it led to them having to restate earnings going back 2 years and now the class action law suits are the result!! pitiful. and no one was ever held accountable. Unbelievable.
Think you Molson guys want to read this article THOROUGHLY!!!
Startet Short Position to get my money back
"Did some work on this last night and am starting to warm up to the idea of taking a stake. Q2 numbers were quite constructive.

TAP is down 5.11% to 47.56
Boom! on earnings call. It looked to me volume was affected positively by loading product last month of quarter. others must have caught it too as stock price dropped sharply right after that statement. this mgt team is clueless.
I should have bought more at 33$.
July 4th around the corner.
TAP will be down 8% by the end of this week. Bank it!
"Entered for the first time today after showing relative strength to the market, after a long downtrend. Good luck to me and other longs!"
what is going on???????????????? in few minutes
Ya I'm FREE... Free FALLING...
I had their Hard Coffee product over Thanksgiving and was pleasantly surprised. The hostess offered it with the dessert table.
"while I agree that management hasn't done the best job the last few years, growth projections at other beverage companies are very similar. Down this year and regaining most back next year. TAP is by far the cheapest packaged beverage company out there. Price to enterprise value is as follows, KDP 4.9, Bud 4.3, coke 6.9 and Tap is 1.67. If it doesn't start going up, someone will want to buy."
TAP is on a breakout and has passed the resistant at 52.7 as it is showing improving costs synergy from acquisitions.

Just started following this one. Thoughts? P/E and earnings look good.
What do ya know. TAP is DOWN! 32 coming.
AH News!?
so this stock is now at the same prices it was in 2014. Thar is concerning to me. what are your thoughts ?
"Short position entered. Short term technical correction. No fundamentals behind it. Yep, you heard it."
hearing rumor of more layoffs in usa operations. could this be cause of the little stock uptick today? Anyone hearing anything?
"All I know, I'm picking up a 15 pack of silver bullets on the way home."
Is it just me or is this sell off a bit overblown? Down 12% and they actually beat what was expected? Other companies who reported similar results are down 2% and 3%.
I really should just sell this and cut my losses
you all were right. This stock is DEAD duck. just get it to 20 and get it over with
This stock just makes a lier out of bunny at every turn. Can’t even hold a small up tick on a 30% dividend increase. Just tells you what the street thinks of it. Lucky if it does not make new low.
There’s no yield to be found anywhere in today’s fixed income. With a PE of 12 and a 4.5% yield this is an attractive play
"I just purchased 1,000 shares for the same reason. I’ve never owned the stock before. "
Oh and here's the other thing. BUD stock is trading at a 52 week HIGH - and of course we know where TAP is trading

poor John losing money
You all know I'm right.
This stock should be cut in half. Pro forma earnings are smoke and mirrors. 35 cents was the true earnings. this stock should be no more than 30 bucks
This is a CEO that led MillerCoors years ago focused on an economy strategy and not hard seltzers. This might be the biggest miss ever in the industry. And guess what. He is still employed making millions. It doesn't matter if the stock falls another 20-30% because he will still make millions. Talk about a screwed up Board of Directors. The shareholders mean absolutely nothing to them.
TAP is a HUGE value trap stock. Back in the $30s soon - BANK IT!
"For the Americans that didn't know, here in Canada, the province of Quebec just shut down restaurants completely again and Ontario is likely to do the same thing soon."

No one else can say that in MJ industry. NO ONE!!! WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION, GMP FACILITIES, MAAAAAAASSIVE GROW IN GREECE 5K HECTARES AND THE TOP CEO OF ALL LPs 1 OF 25 MOST INFLUENTIAL ... AURORA CAN LICK THE BOTTOM OF MY APHRIA BOOT."
"Bunny, I've read the earnings presentation. I've looked at the ratios. I've read the analyst reports. TAP stock is horrible and will continue to be horrible until big changes are made at the company. I dont believe any guidance they ever give because it all seems to be #$%$. Old recycled management team and board that allows company to be run like a country club. Everyone in the US works from home!! Management team must all be fired. Until that happens, you can expect more share price erosion, brewery closings and dismal dividends."
"Thad, note the wrongful termination lawsuits against STZ is also against US gov DOL FTC, after years in abeyance US courts locked it in a lack of jurisdiction based on PLO cases. Must be very big and nasty, a SArbanesGate"
"@R keeps talking about TAP being in an up cycle and how stocks have up cycles and down cycles. I think @R is confusing the stock ""cycles"" with his own manic and depressive cycles. Pretty sure after reading some of his posts he's also having cycles of delusion. Like when he accuses everyone of stock price manipulation. Like market manipulators jump on yahoo finance. LOL!! What a piece of work."

"I was once down a lot on TAP, now i’m up a lot on TAP. I went from drowning my sorrows in Mickeys, to celebrating my winnings with Miller High Lifes: it’s the champaign of beers."
Better sell before the earnings report on 30/10/2019. that's this coming Wednesday!!
TAP is up 5.10% to 61.01
"With the fed probably lowering by at least 50 bases points, is the bleeding of TAP finally over? Comments please."
Good value at this price - I am long and believe will benefit from opening up and also ownership of Truss\hexo jv that has grabbed #1 spot in RTD....
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 38.21
"Been waiting for a chance to buy back in after selling earlier this year at $42. Finally pulled trigger againt this AM at $36.47. Missed the bottom (hopefully) but feel the onslaught of recent news is too compelling to wait any longer. Coors Seltzer finally, tie up with Coke, Yuengling and coffee, and reboot of cannabis strategy. Seems like mgt finally gets it and Truly (pun intended) is committed to making this a beverage company. The debt is manageable and the valuation is very reasonable. Coke just may buy it outright next year if their seltzer takes off- basically Coke broke the glass and can have an instant global footprint with TAP. Have to think hedge funds, etc. see the turnaround taking hold. Not too many values like this in the marketplace right now. GLTA Longs"
The vaccines are working and restaurants and stadiums will reopen again. I think I heard the Divi will be reinstated in the 2H. I'll buy today at a discount and wait. Things will get a lot better fairly quickly imo.
Molson Coors Beverage is down 5.02% to 36.74
What just happened?
https://www.dxc.technology/cpg_retail/case_studies/146615-transformation_on_tap_for_molson_coors
Came here expecting some actual numbers and facts only to find thad. Smh
Did you see the three analysts big upgrade on Tap? I am fortunate been buying as finding a great growth and income stock
Does anyone still drink Coors? I haven't had it since high school 30 years ago. Act of desperation
Molson Coors Beverage is down 6.41% to 44.36
WANTED! More bag holders for Molson Coors to allow the management team to continue to be over paid and make more foolish decisions with shareholders money. Please contact Gianni and Greg for more information. LOL LOL LOL!!
Hi! why is this down so much? thanks!
"can't see why,anyone wouldn't want to buy this at this price. hold 5 years."
"Man, this one is really down today. Earnings?"
Big turnaround coming for this company. Vizzy sentiment is positive so far and people will always drink cheap quality beer in a depression.
This is crazy................Simply nuts.
@john I completely disagree with your statement. No beer companies’ focus is economy brand! Tap is no exception. Their focus has always been premium light aka miller lite and Coors light. Plus crafts and import divisions. Premiumization is the key word in this industry. You don’t know what you are talking about.
"@R's up cycle / down cycle assertion is absurd and not based on any even basic financial/investment principles. Just wishful thinking. Until management is replaced expect more share price erosion, declining sales and share, failed new product launches and anger at allowing yourself to be so foolish as to buy stock in this sad company that is being raised by a greedy and inept management team."
Buyout by Anheuser 
Tanking fast. It's gonna be a miserable day ...
TAP is up 5.17% to 40.50
"I reiterate, in the $30's by late spring early summer. BANK IT!"
VALUE TRAP!! BEWARE.
A short squeeze is comming soon by the likes you haven't seen a long time in TaP
How hard can it be to sell beer people.
"This company will continue to underperform until entirely new management team is brought in. Until that happens, good luck."
TAP is down 5.81% to 34.79
Has coors always done a webcast for earnings?? Just curious
Can't keep my mouth shut. Sorry. But not sorry
that was a pretty good short squeeze. Too bad its over now. I have to find the next short squeeze. I specialize is short squeezes. I like the short squeeze the most.
I need a beer. Or two. This Covid stuff's been a pain.I need a pizza too.
Michael Burry recent buy is an endorsement of TAP's deep value. It co-incide with the Seeking Alpha article in recommending TAP.
"The ""gurus"" and ""oracles"" predict that TAP will be taken over by ........ DEO in 2018........may be.I see that as a great future for TAP shareholders."
good buy and hold before it reaches 40$
"Great news, TAP starts to sell POt drink in DEc, another growth engine"
People not buying Corona beer and buying Molson Coors cheap beer
"Wait for it people!!! The take home of this earnings report is VOLUME DOWN OVER 12%! Now watch stock price over the next 3 business days. You can only close so many plants, lay off so many people and cook the books for so long. Last report was an earnings beat with a volume decline and it got a pop in price then dropped significantly. Price will erode to lower than pre earnings share price very fast. BANK IT!!"
sold my uber calls before close. got lucky. make quick 75 bucks.
The biggest change in marketing is shifting some marketing spend to digital because more people are going there. Wow! What an insight. This company is a dinosaur.
TAP stock at a 15 year low.... this is an opportunity to buy when others are fearful
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 42.23
OOF sorry Thad.... maybe 30s by December?
"Look I understand if you guys wanted to short this at 100$, even 70$, but at this price, it's selling at a free cash flow rate of 8x. It produced 200 million of net income last quarter with restaurants and bars shut down throughout North America. If you're shorting this stock now at 34$, your in for a lot of trouble. A bunch of value investors like myself are getting in the low 30s and will sell around 50-55$ for a quick 40-50% gain within a year."
Self medication. I’m in
"Over reaction, it is a buying opportunities as it is likely accounting write down allocation."
"Ma, are you working for Dodge & Cox. trying to buy the stock cheap? The growth is coming. Value stocks are in favor. Insiders are buying !"
http://www.molsoncoors.com/en/news/molson-coors-canada-and-hexo-launch-truss
This first quarter will be an ugly quarter for many reasons. One of the down 8-10% couple of day varieties. Then it is time to buy. This has been the pattern and won't change in April.
I'm a HEXO owner thinking of buying TAP Hello partners! What do you all think of this partnership?
https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/molson-coors-said-to-be-in-talks-with-pot-firms-as-legalization-looms-1.1097480
I hope @Pugi had a stop loss to protect his investment at $37.50
"@Summer. You should really do more research before posting about goats. Have you seen the recent analysis Upslope Capital management did on Molson Coors, ""Even from a long perspective there are much better uses for capital than Moloson Coors"". Pick out a good goat my friend. Even hedge funds are running away from this company. Double bad news coming with financial specifics will come out prior to earnings report on the coca cola deal showing TAP taking all the risk with little upside (desperation move) and then earnings reported at end of this month. Stock will be in the high $20's by year end. TAP needs new management. THAT is the problem. Dead company run by dinosaurs. May already be too late. Probably be taken over by Heineken end of first quarter 2021 for about $23 to 25 dollars per share. Sad. I'm going to lose money."
Even the inept Wall Street analysts are calling out the incompetence of the management team. Missed out on getting Burwick the Boston Beer CEO to lead the company. Could have popped the stock 20%.
This PO$ can NEVER string together a real upward movement. Sell before it's too late.
"As crummy as this stock is, that price action all the way down to $60, did seem a bit overdone."
If any company should be bid up its this one. Discounting cash flows into the future the stock is 50% undervalued.
Tap officially welcomes a new group of bag holders.
https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/molson-coors-goes-national-with-vizzy-amid-hard-seltzer-boom/ar-BB12oaHsSummer coming and Coors will be flowing.
DEFUND the TAP Management Team!!!
TAP reached a new 52 Week Low at 68.02
"Today could be some portfolio window dressing, with some actively managed fundsnot wanting to report having TAP at the end of the quarter. If so, there could be a modest rebound later in the week."
"next real bad day in dow,looking to take a position here. can't chart this its down so much.but valuation is different.the company has a ton of cash flow. another thing keeping me back is one of their beers,colors light. maybe poorest excuse for beer on market."
The problem now is the new CEO ran the US operations which is the most screwed up business unit if them all. We need completely new management from outside the organization. This is worse than not firing the original CEO. SELL!
"summer is over, tap will go down"
I am long (bought in last summer) and disappointed....that says some of this looks like cleaning up balance sheet in pandemic year especially the Europe reset. New CEO who was CFO tanking 2020. I wish I hadn’t bought in last summer but continue to believe this is low price to sales and will benefit from opening up and also new launches like cannabis and flavoured waters etc.
why haven't they talked about Vizzy
"Ok, goodbye Shorts. Party is over."
I'm waiting. This week let's see something positive.
"back to the low $30's soon. Suckers and bag holders fell free to offer your ignorant ""insight""."
what's going on today literally everything down except this. everytime I feel like I should sell this and move on. it surprises me
The market has very clearly thrown in the towel on this POS stock
I have a feeling that this virus is going to put all of the local breweries out of business and the only players in the market will remain the “big boys”. I am not sure how much more this is going to drop but this will come back very strong
STRONG dollar?
is it going to go back up?
colors/coors
87 more days until earning call...
Bunny is either clueless or a reckless pumper. I think he is a clueless pumper.
still holding my long term call contract. I got 2 now.
"OK, I'm in.A little."
Why is Bud up? Tap not doing much.
Come on Coors make a deal with Aphria or Aurora .... You have got to keep Pace !
Aug 1st should be the day Coors announcement with Aphria ! Get it done !!
So... Who all are going to get fired for this major screw up in earnings reporting? will be interesting to see what the company does here. it was such an egregious error that they have to restate their financials and earnings reports going back 2 years!?!? Class action lawsuits for misleading shareholders already starting. this will be a drag on TAP for years to come. Such a mismanaged company.
Last three quarters have seen steady top line growth in TAP. This slide in the price of the stock from its high point really doesn't make any sense.
"TAP has been taking off this week? I am wondering if the deal between The SABMiller/Anheuser-Busch InBev deal continues moving forward, and supposed to be of the biggest potential mergers in history, could be the reason for TAP'S recent stock rise? There was a buy rating several months ago and I bought and just now back to what I paid for it...I have learned to be more careful about what some of the analyst recommend? Anyone care to comment on this?"
Any thoughts on when they could announce reinstating the dividend?
Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.91% to 35.02
"It's a beautiful day - sun is shining, TAP is popping. Go get yourself a Vizzy and kick back."
There is no way dividend will be reinstated by end of this year unless it's a fraction of the former dividend. They have way way way too much debt to buy down. They'll probably pay out like 5 cents and say see we reinstated the dividend like we said. That would seem about right for this management team.
I think we need a reaction and a comment from the CEO - or the board. Valuation is now similar to a middle sized european brewery...this is not a good sign and even long term investors turn to the nervous side.React please
that was the blowoff top for tap. might of sucked in some beer suckers. Glad I sold my calls. made 60 dollars. still holding some common shares
"Pugi, I hope you enjoyed your very short term technical rebound gain. Did you time your exit well? Did you get out? Regardless how you planned to play this stock, you are a rookie. Investment buy? Out of the question. Technical Trading buy? This stock has had lower highs and lower lows for years now. Tough trades no matter how you do it."
I bought a load of Tap and Aphria ...sold both yesterday at open ...then they proceeded to go in different directions .Tap went up $6 and Aphria went down :-( ... I played this one wrong because they both went down since my purchase even before yesterday :-( .... I took a chance ... all in all you need to win more Than you lose.I will win the next one !
Seems like a couple of malcontents on the board bashing Tap. Maybe they should short it here and make some money instead of bashing. For me I have usually put a stop here. Made good money though from 50.
Ryan. Your holding at $44 comment sure didn't age well. LOL LOL LOL
They need to buy CBA Kona Beer and stick it to BUD.
"I got in for the potential of the Joint Venture with $TAP Truss.I want to hear about their drinks lineup in the next ER.The VERYWELL Drops are exciting and I have not seen water soluble drops from other companies, so innovative. This is good. Long $HEXO"
SAM makes the breakthrough for TAP. It does not make the case for the management. We need change
"I'm surprised there was no bounce. It's appears this is going to be dead money for a while. I really like the stock, but I can't commit the money."
What a joke. I'm not selling. We will see these guys generating massive amounts of cannabis revenue before we know it. HOLD!
hope they buy out Hexo
Long term this stock is dead. Has nothing to do with COVID. management team ran stock price down almost 50% BEFORE COVID. Classic value trap. Until management team is replaced STAY AWAY unless u want to become a bag holder like Gianni. But Gianni will be ok because he owns Facebook stock too. just ask him. LOL LOL LOL!
A $51 buyout would only be 1.8x enterprise value.
Huge cover-up..maybe the Coors shooting will trigger an investigation.
Does anyone knows the book value of TAP?
"Missed the boat on march 23rd. Thanks to program trading to lower the entire market, I just got in. Anyone selling now is nuts."
"Constellation Brand up, Tap will follow with the beat"
i see a bullflag on the 6 month. Finaly
P.E of 7.87 implies negative growth. Well see at earnings whether that is true or not but the estimates don't reflect that.
Another day and another analyst downgrade to sell. Seems like many have lost faith in the management team. This stock is dead until new management is brought in. Board of directors better start cleaning house or stock will be in the low 40's by year end.
You go Bunny. in my estimation you have lost over $9.8 million on this company over the past 6 years and that's including the dividend it pays. so you go ahead and buy more. We'll all just continue to watch you crash and burn.
9 days to earnings call...
"I don't see anyone talking about this.. why hasn't MCBC sold its Europe and MCI (LatAm, Asia Pacific, Africa) segments?? I just don't see the synergies.. they virtually don't share any of the same brands (except Coors Light sold in LatAm - but MCI sales are only 2% of total). They need to sell those divisions, deleverage, then focus on operations in U.S./Canada, driving demand for market share in premium/economy segment, and possibly acquiring one or several microbreweries at an attractive price as microbreweries begin to go under / merge / look for acquirers."
Nice bottoming base forming just need to get past 66-67
"Molson stock = $33.30 new 11 year low.“R” - “it is in an up cycle. Lol lol lol”“Molson stock” - POW! (Right hook)“R” - “but, but I am the greatest. Lol lol lol”“Molson stock” - POW! (Left hook)"
Up a dime. PO$
I believe ULTIMATSTOKCALERTS has the very good trading alerts. look them up .
TAP is down 5.62% to 45.34
Greedy management team will make sure they get theirs at the cost of shareholders. Highest salaries in the industry paid to vp's and even associate directors at Molson Coors while their share holders are spat on by them.
I'm gonna put money in here. This actually seems undervalued along with a lot of other stocks in this industry.Dividends returning next year but let's be real. Everyones gonna want s beer after this mess lol
Solid base to shoom to 120
"Strong sell, right????? Someone does not think so."
"F%ck It, just going to have to ride this storm out. Trying to stay patient."
Huge short squeeze comming. By the likes which you haven't seen in a while.
Biden wins and the Corona closers this stock goes down.
"Another analyst downgrade and price cut. Time to cut ties with management before the stock drops in the 30's. Bring on a team, particularly in the US division that knows how to build and market a brand portfolio and build and execute on a strategy."
"$32 again? will buy in, let see how much more down in the next few days.$39.80"
TAP-A reached a 52 Week low at 54.42

Molson Coors Beverage is up 4.93% to 44.28
"I-am a very nervous man, Cramer of CNBC, came out with the whole story of our favorite stock, TAP, $. The infused beverage story, and the rebound from their cost cutting. I am a long term holder. But, recall how Cramer named his dog Nvidia. Most know that holding is now in freefall. And if he gets a dog named Tap, I am out."
TAP reached a 52 Week low at $54.87
The MillerCoors share numbers this quarter are an embarrassment. When will we have a management team with accountability that can grow the business and stock price. This thing is a disaster.
and she continues to go down..... How low do we go? $70
ffs i shouldve bought more in the 30s
Tyler is the Only guy who posted today ! If Wednesday goes our way we will get 100 posts !! Let's go Coors make us look smart !!
"I see that Molson Coors is forming a joint venture with Hexo to make CBD Drinks... IMHO, some of the CBD companies are currently priced for a fire sale so Molson should look at picking up one or two to own a few suppliers of CBD. One that I've seen torn apart by Covid-19 is cbdMD. Folks at Molson should take a look. Now is an excellent time for picking up companies that are struggling as it opens the doors for new product lines (like beverages) while potentially boosting the sales of existing product lines (like cbdMD's products, see their website)."
$100 tomorrow/ earnings beat sends the stock up 9% why not?
"Off Premise alcohol sales:Beer sales were up a strong 21.4% during the 16-week period, with the super premium category outpacing the craft category. YTD off-premises beer category sales are up 16%"

Shorts are covering $TAP and $MIK as valuation super low and very profitable businesses......they are worried that Robin Hood Game Stop phenom spreads......
I finally get what @Bunny was talking about with all the posts about TAP's increased efficiency. TAP very efficiently had been eroding share price and stockholder value. Could we please get rid of the entire feckless management team and hold our employees accountable?!Board of Directors please take note that big changes to personnel are needed. Dividend cut coming soon.
TAP-A is up 6.91% to 64.97
SAM go buy TAP - get rid of management - divest TAP europe - and add a superior NEW business culture.That is gold
2 day until earnings call...
Marching tune is on....
The acquisition synergy starts to take traction indicating by the company can start to reduce headcounts after the merger to realize the savings
"TAP has lost 60% of its share price over the past 6 years. that's BEFORE COVID. share and volume shrinking for the past 3.5 years. horrible management team that needs to be replaced. until then, expect this dog to lag the broader market and its' peers. Last 4 earnings calls were horrible. maybe this one will be better but probably not."
"bottom for TAP should be around $24.50 to $26. But I still wont buy a single additional share until entire management team is replaced. once that happens, I will double my position and hope the purging of the dinosaurs that had been running this place allows this once great company to get back on track. Current management must go. All the VP's and above are all still lining their pockets as they have been for the past 5 years as they let this once great company slide into a sad marginal player. they are more concerned with making their exorbitant total compensation (biggest in the industry) than turning this company around."
im taking profits I will rebuy a dip. I'm very bullish on this
I just looked up tap thinking of buying yahoo finance showed no dividend what’s. Up
Strong compared to market today.
"Hurry you better sell more . SELL, SELL,SELL TAP is going to change from a long term down cycle unless you keep selling it lower. The new up cycle is going to start LOL,LOL hurry SELL, SELL, SELL or TAP will be going higher and higher"
The newly minted bag holders are mad now. Lol.
im 2 deep on long calls. bought another one at 3 minutes before close.

I would be more concerned about PURA and their EVERx CBD Sports Water!
TAP will bottom at $43 around late October then continue to lag other co's inthe beer/alcohol beverage industry.
TAP is up 4.93% to 70.31
"Did Pabst Blue Ribbon exercise option buying Coors Brewery (15801 W 1st St, Irwindale, CA 91706) happen today? The package is 150 million dollars."
How much lower must TAP move to become a Buy?
Stock will be below $36.73 by Tuesday of next week. BANK IT!
"Agree even if books are off the current Book Value is $62, they still have a huge market share, good products and most of the issues that they are dealing with all of their competition has too. Industry issues for materials etc. Even if Book Value is half of what is reported, they are still in good shape."
"I am a former TAP shareholder and still track daily. I had sold because two undeniable truths bode poorly for TAP future. 1. There is virtually no barriers to entry. Where I live alone several microbreweries opened. Even in COVID times their outdoor gardens are open. This is taking away any potential for sales growth IMO. 2. Milleniels will not drink if it means drinking the big brands. Once more, the bars I do go to are pulling Miler/Coors/Bud taps and replacing with micros. I am a Miller Lite guy and when I do go out no one, and I mean no one under 40 is drinking the national brands. This demographic reality is showing up in TAP numbers and I see no catalyst to change that. If they do sell their euro brands then this is just a zombie. Too late to seltzer party as well. I studied the beer industry and it is a mirror image of the 30 year period post prohibition. In 20 years I believe Miller and Coors will ultimately be local brands around the breweries that remain (Milwaukee, Golden) that do contract brews as well. Just my 2 cents- I have no shares and sincerely feel bad for LT holders here. Same happened to me with Natural Gas stock and it took 5 years and near destruction of my portfolio to figure out only the Managements made money."
back to 38 soon.
Nothing like a Molsen and a big fat blunt......... ;-)
Stopped out. Huge profit though.
This is prolly the suckers price. I'm in today.
Thad is your short position in the negative? I just wonder why anyone would bash a stock so hard they they are invested in haha.
Clank! Wow! I think that's the sound of the market price hitting the bottom! Maybe it's time to buy some more!

i cannot believe i was attracted to buy TAP yesterday and today. it looks very cheap at this market cap. people keep on drinking forever hahahahaha
"TAP is dropping too much today, it makes no sense.I can't find bad news for this exaggerated behavior, it is extremely misplaced and I add 2270 more shares to $ 34.14."

"I don't see much of a mention at all about Vizzy in the earnings report. Hasn't been out long but from what I've seen in retail outlets, it's doing well and will be formidable competition for white claw."
"up $1 in a month, I'll drink to that"
why down so much today ? I may take small position.
Unf****believable. What is it going to eventually trade at? 6 PE?
"At the current cheap valuation, Tap is the type of predictable free cash flow generation business that Warren Buffet is looking for. I would not be surprise that WB is accumulating Tap, and even offer a full buyout of Tap.I know that he has too much cash and is looking for sizable acqusition that is cheap, with strong moat, easy to understand business. Tap could be the buyout target by Warren Buffet. Boring business that can earn incredible free cash flow in good time and bad time. It is a recession proof stock."
Dividend cut coming - Bank it!!!
sold as much as I didnt want to. I'll check back in a few months
"It’s hard to comprehend what a dog TAP has been lately. I bought 1.5 years ago thinking it was cheap relative to other brewers. I’m down almost 25% today. Fortunately I didn’t take a large position and it’s mostly been a great lesson in what a value trap is. They are least phasing out old plants and attempting to cut costs. In my area they’re replacing old plants with more efficient new ones, but as I understand it mgmt is still bloated from the merger and they still need to cut the fat. Add that to the fact that the whole industry is down (demographics in my view, millennials like me are now in their 30’s and can’t guzzle beer like we used to) and it makes sense why TAP has struggled. Decent dividend at least. I’m long for now..."
"Topo and Vizzy, big money there."
Come on....get off the ground TAP!!!

Motley Fool recommends TAP
"Yuengling JV? Great, another distraction from solving the real problems with the business. Look at how the JV with SABMiller worked out. Market cap is back where it was before that JV."
Some body told me TAP is in talk with a merger
"New to the stock, not new to the company. Seems like the carnage has been priced in, on top of what they had to deal with before all of this started. Great brand (thank heavens Corona isn't one of their products), cheap options. I think craft beers will struggle a bit until people feel comfortable with their finances. Not everyone will change, but it is just an example of people pulling back on ""luxury"" at the grocery store. And one thing for sure is the BOOZE ARE FLOWING with how on edge people are. Any other ideas out there? Dipped my toe in the water today with CVX,PSX,INTC,CSCO,ADM,MDT, VZ for my dividend buys. Went into international for the first time as well,and gold yesterday. Plan on averaging in."
"like I said, stock will continue to drop and earnings call next week will be the same dog and pony show like all the others for the past 5 years. until new management is brought in this stock will lag."
"Haven't seen any posts on product news. Vizzy variety pack 2, vizzy lemonade, Coors pure, and new MGD packaging plus vizzy launch in canada. With summer and live events and all, it might get interesting for Coors."

"Pete Coors sold 40,000 shares at $35.06 on July 2nd (form 4 on MCBC website). Not looking good for Q2 results."

"This stock is going to the moon within the next 4-6 months as vaccine rollout speeds up.

Marketp HUGE. TAP down. Biggest PO$ on the exchange. Sell b4 its too late.
Sales has gone up from 5 billions to 11 billions from 2015 to 2016 with costs are coming down from synergy. Great cheap stock with moat
"management needs to take salary cuts. I contacted investor relations. I had suggested to them that they split the stock and make it more attractive to the retail investor. Well, I guess the price came down to what would have been a 2 for 1 split. How do these people justify their salaries when the stock has been halved/ ? A monkey or a Democrat could do as well"
"The Barclays conference this week was enough of a disaster to bring the stock down 8%. All the CEO focused on was activities and things, and not results. There is no accountability. What's worse is he thinks the company performance is a success. That has been the story for years. Lots of product announcements with poor marketing and sales execution. It's obvious with the stock price others feel this too. Wait for $30/share."
"Wow, nice Coca Cola deal... turning point."
"Another day, another downgrade. JP Morgan the most recent to downgrade TAP. Can u say value trap? Bubble about to burst."
Hmmmm... Not the way I'm seeing it. This is the beginning of another slow erosion in share price until earnings are reported then - BAM! - The bottom drops out! Look at the 5 year stock price chart. Horrible management team running this company into the ground.
Worst investment I ever made = TAP
"Pretty simple. Until tap announces sales volume has stabilized, stock will not perform. As the matter if tap can say volume did not further decline in the next quarter call. Stock will shoot up 3 bucks. It is THAT simple. You simply can not a expect a stellar stock performance when a company keeps shrinking. Like I said before, many more people bought in when it was 38 and they become bag holders just like many people here already are. Turn the sales volume around and you get a turn around story. Period. Until then, pump all you want. And feel relief in trading upticks. In the end, it is all air."
"Start the upward march, boys and girls"
Mixed 2Q results but TAP is up. Odd.Molson Coors (TAP) Lags Q2 Earnings; Sales Beats Estimateshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-tap-lags-q2-120612031.html
"This is a dying company with horrible leadership that has run down stock price for 6 solid years during the greatest bull market in history. Vizzy 1.5 years late to market with no resources or marketing plan behind it. Even worse, it will take MC at least 3 more years to recover from the $3.1 Billion overpayment for the joint venture buy out. This company is doomed until entire management team is replaced. if you like losing money this is your company!!"
Reduce headcount. With AI and robotics could cut 5000. Is this freakin Union? Get rid of those expensive parasites.Marijauna initiatives needed too.BOD contains some rusted buffoons. Chop chop...
For the rivers!
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 49.32
SURE YOU HAVE ... YOU KNOW WE CAN READ POST HISTORY HUH ...
PO$ DOWN AGAIN. EVERY FREAKING DAY.
I wish i put in more and didnt loose so much with aph
I like blue moon!!
"I sold my position in Hexo today...up over 100% from buying last summer.....I still like their partnership strategy just feel valuation getting a bit high......I have switched to MOLSON Coors $TAP on basis that they own 60% of Truss, have a beaten down valuation and believe they will benefit from opening up trade in coming months........their valuation both PE and price to sales is way below BUD which is also beaten down. I remain a long term fan of Hexo but will look for an entry point if there is a pull back. My thoughts for what it is worth."
As soon as dividend is cut look for 4 to 7% immediate decrease in stock price.
ME!! So sick of the 6 year record of this company. Truly convinced it is management to blame. Doing all I can to have them removed. I'm so below water I have to ride this out for the 5 years it will take to turn this company around (if it's even pissible). Board of Directors MUST clean house. Now I'm hearing Vizzy launch is failing miserably. Great. Another failed product launch which will drop share price as soon as the numbers are made public. This company is dead until entire management team is replaced.
Molson Coors Beverage is down 6.67% to 38.21
It's showing higher higher on the 6 month chart. Both technical and fundamentals side indicates that it is a screening buy
"boohoo now im only up 32% since buying in 6 months ago. This is why I said 60$ by summer, thats when covid restrictions will be lifted. Next quarter earnings will be even worse, then its an easy uphill climb."
"who's going to get fired for the poor internal financial accounting oversight that caused TAP to have to restate their earnings and financials going back 2 years and cause the stick price to drop almost 9% in one day and launch numerous class action law suits which will be a drag on stock price for years to come? Probably no one. They will protect their own at the cost of us the shareholders. I haven't heard a peep as to what TAP is planning to do to make sure it wont happen again. Terrible management. TAP will continue to disappoint until new management is put into place. come on TAP, at least tell us who's going to be fired over the sloppy financial reporting catastrophe that cost us shareholders close to 9% of our investment in a single day. This company just doesn't care about their shareholders. sad."
"9b USD valuation, trades at 8-10x net income, 1x top line, nice brand line up, owns 49% of the beer store in ontario, concerts and sports reopening play, will automate production in breweries, weed drink play too, largest domestic US brewer"
Some of the worse comps in history to work off of.
TAP-A is down -6.31% to 60.00
TAP reached a 52 Week low at 46.00
"This company had become nothing more than a shell game of one sided ""deals"" or co promotions to keep the turn around ""lie"" alive so current management team can continue to line their own pockets at shareholders expense all while ruining a once great company. Board Of Directors WAKE UP!!!!"
Insiders are raking up the shares
this suckers getting ready to pop up hard. hopefully by end of week. if it drops in the morning need to double down.
Talk to any ad agency. TAP is viewed as incompetent suckers that can be played if u stroke a few egos and sell them a dream. Management has to go! They allowed this to happen for over 6 years.
"You've gotta love the idiotic forecast by Credit Suisse analyst:""TAP will either go to $43.00 or to $71.00............ ""and they pay people to forecast that ? I should have been an analyst............"
Coors family no longer behind this
Molson Coors Beverage is down 5.62% to 45.34
"Beer is out. Hard seltzers are in (for now). But you can just mix your own drinks with spirits... it's a no-brainer, so one that even even the young dumbazzz selzter-guzzlers will figure out eventually. Spirits-makers is the obvious choice if you want to invest in booze.@@@The heads of the three largest beer companies in Canada were together on a stage, sitting around an unusually small table, talking about their collective decline to a crowd of bar owners and restaurateurs. “Am I concerned? I’d be a liar if I didn’t say yes,” said Kyle Norrington, president of Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd., the Canadian wing of global beer conglomerate Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. A recent report from industry group Beer Canada had just shown a three-per-cent drop in total sales volumes in 2019, compared to 2018....But beer brewers might be the only ones in the alcoholic beverage industry fighting such declines. Despite some signs that younger generations aren’t as into alcohol as their parents, Canadians don’t appear to be drinking less overall, just less beer. Annual beer consumption fell by more than 10 litres per person aged 15 and older between 2004 and 2018, according to Statistics Canada’s most recent data. But in the same time period, the total volume of pure alcohol sold increased modestly, to 8.2 litres per person per year from eight litres.https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/are-we-really-drinking-less-or-why-white-claws-arrival-means-more-bad-news-for-brewers"
Bought BUD yesterday at 52 week low.....gettin' ready for the next recession.....people will buy plenty of beer!
looks like tomorrow is going to be a nice pop.
"I've said it before, but based on below average beverage company valuations, this company is worth double what it's trading today. It will get there, maybe require new management."
Already starting to downplay earnings report. it's not going to be pretty. Dividend cut coming. Bank it!
"Any truth to the rumor that management changing or cancelling meetings because the dates dont fit into their personal schedules? If that is true, what is going on?!?! This company needs a complete management house cleaning. Until that happens this stock will lag."
"Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages, some infused with CBD and some with CBD and THC go on sale in Canada sometime this month."
"Zoom, Zoom, Zoom"
"guess that ""short squeeze"" really fizzled out before it even started. LOL!!"
@R where did u go? Now u see how wrong you were. TAP down over its 5 day chart. See! You lost a lot of that fictitious $400k you invested a couple of days ago. LOL!
good bye to molson Coors dividend as we know it. it's going to be smaller soon. Bank it!
Surprised to see this pop up so much in one day. Anyone have a clue what went down?
The Raptor games have already pumped in extra cash to the coffer.
TAP should buy Hexo Outright and make a CBD infused drink in a bottle or on Tap. Pump up Miller division sales with this creation You have Molsons Blue Moon now be Ahead of the beer wars and get a CBD beer out there.
Buy more gianni. BUY BUY BUY!! TAP management thanks you. Tell your family and friends. Bag holders wanted. BUY. LOL
Biggest PO$ stock on the market. Red by EOD
Way too cheap..hoping for a pop on Thurs earnings
"TAP is clearly gearing up for the move to $80. What TAP has going on excites me. First, their expansion into the alcohol seltzer category and their reduction in operational fat were both a success. Second, there will be no BUD commercials during the Superbowl that take aim at TAP this year. Third, TAP is not trading at all with the potential they possess of being first to market in the emerging alcoholic-weed infused beverage market (assuming their partnership with HEXO is actually getting this play right) and actually having a P/E sub 20. Most investors know that all of the publicly traded marijuana companies lose money (which a view TAP slightly as) and this seems as one the safest way to play both of the world's most favorite vices."
@M you are so spot on. VP's and executives will make huge bonuses and stock Grant's. They always do at TAP. Performance doesn't matter. They are raiding a once great company. Have driven stock down over 6 years all during a huge bull run. Nothing will change until management is completely replaced. No one is ever held accountable there.
Earning Report in 1 day. BOOM! This dog will sink like a stone after the report. Bank it!!
Tap needs to buy Samuel Adams or invest in aphria that’s where the next evolution is headed
"DONT blame the shooter at Coors Breweries, corporate layers have the dismissal process stiched to a notch, like a pack of wolffs they will pick a target and pursue a constructive dismissal process to include not only warnings, and made up claims but lots of abuse, harassment , intimidation, bullying and many other crimes months event before employee is terminated ; subsequently may pursue further various illegal retaliatory actions, from malicious prosecution, defamation, restriction of trade, money theft, surveillence, property damage, physical damage, and other behind the scene actions against the individual his family for cause or not"

Why is this going down
"Love how this is green for the day, while Nasdaq is down a whole 1.5%, great value stock at current valuations. Hoping this goes back to 32 so I can load up more."
#$%$ is with this stock? I'm in long but show some signs of moving forward.
Molson Coors Beverage reached a 52 Week low at 32.73
"Molson Coors stock is now a ""strong sell"" at CFRA ahead of earning call, as entry into competitive hard seltzer market is ""too late""... Another analyst downgrade that references poor management decisions of the new management. Should be an interesting call tomorrow. Earnings should meet with the plant closings and layoffs but should see even more continued sales volume decline. Sad what this company had become."
"OK, I will say it since no one else will.... impressive to finish green on Friday with the two downgrades. Downgrades seem very short-sighted to me. I think it's pretty obvious that their #'s over the next year will look a heck of a lot better than last year. The beer is going to be flowin' this summer in the U.S. I have a feeling."
Back to 39
Molson Coors Beverage is down 4.95% to 49.88
Fire at the brewery in Golden
this is a great American company. no mater what happens people will crack a cold one. proud to be long and strong
"TAP said Wednesday it will buy craft beer maker Atwater Brewery.Anyone care to comment, seems inconsequential based on reactions here...none"
When the new CEO comments that the Coors Light and Miller Lite TV commercials are breakthrough the stock is in trouble. He is in living in the beer world of then years ago. Unfortunately it will take at least two years to remove relics like this to turn the business around or sell it.
Hold ur shares folk this is a $105 by mid feb.....
TAP is down -5.11% to 68.02
Be patient
"PEOPLE!! It's the management team here that is killing and has been killing this company for the past 6.5 years!! Giving themselves huge bonuses while dragging down share price over 60% during the largest bull market in memory. Until management is replaced, prepare for more disappointment."
merger? getting bought?
How long will this downturn last before someone looks to buy the company?
I believe TAP has the most potential of all the publicly traded beer companies in 2020.
Impressive... Turnaround?
A new 52 week low
LETS GO TIME TO BUY BOYSSSSS. MICHAEL BURRY IS NOW OFFICIAL ON THE $TAP TRAIN WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOhttps://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM
"Can someone explain how TAP has $40/share net debt, but book value is $60? Does not compute."
I told you so! I've been right on every earnings call for 2 years. Bow down to me. Dividend Will be lowered soon. Bank it!!!
Looks like i started my position at the perfect time about a month ago. Been nothing but green since
Loading up huge. Keep selling your shares to me at these low prices. Buy low sell MUCH higher. Have over 15000 shares already. All aboard!!!
"Surely nobody wants to work for a company that abuses you, destroys your property, breaks into your house, keeps you under surveilance gets cops and tugs to manhandle you, run character assassination campaignes, slanders, steals your hard earned money, uses the system to illegaly retaliate against you."
You should expect a cover by corporate judiciary gov as they did at Constellation!
cutting dividends shows this company will regrow in short term. great way to save capital while summer will skyrocket the price. we all need a drink right now
"Workers on strike, and now a cyber attack.. I'm out."
"""The Denver company reported first-quarter profit of $278.1 million, more than the $208.5 million for the same period last year.""And this was for Winter Months.................."
$TAP Initiated by Wolfe Research Peer Perform Target Raised by Morgan Stanley Equal Weight USD 45 » USD 49
Has anyone heard who they are holding accountable for their poor internal financial and accounting controls that caused the stock price to drop 10% in one day and require them to have to restate earnings going back 2 years? Me either and that is why I wish I had never bought any stock in this poorly managed company. They just protect their own and gouge us shareholders. Hope executive leadership us shown the door soon. No hope for this company until that is done.
Molson Coors Beverage is up 5.86% to 40.65
this stock sucks
Dow up 260. Tap up 20 cents. POS
