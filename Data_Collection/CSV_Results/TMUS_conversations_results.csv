"Comcast is somewhat unlikely to acquire T-Mobile because the price would be too high. Think about the industry from this perspective: Fixed cable and fiber optic, fixed wireless and mobile wireless access are at the stage and in the process of converging. The next field of dreams is ""5G"" wireless access. However, 5G is not at all just about wireless technology and networks because high capacity wireless must be built using massively interconnected wide data pipes for backhaul. Wireless is what the consumer does now most often connect. And that is ture for connections to cable, DSL, and fiber-optic networks because the final connection is most often via WiFi or, less often, a 3G-4G femtocell. 5G is an extension of 4G, pushing it into 'massively smallcell' in which base stations, as small as what can be embedded into a parking meter, part of a utility lamp post, or in the ceiling of a building (among many other places). Some countries, including Japan, S. Korea and metro areas in China, are making use of 10 to about 50 times as many base stations than is now common in the USA. Softbank Japan has deployed over 235,000 base stations, most of them smallcells in a country the size of the state of California. That is about six times as many as Verizon, the leading US operator has deployed in the entire USA. What does that mean to the USA operator landscape. If the US is to catch up and then keep up with the higher bandwidth delivery model, then this means major shift in how networks are deployed. That drastically impacts the cost of deployment unless the methods of deployment are modified to reduce costs by a corresponding factor of, make it idiot simple, 1/20 (lower) cost per base station.The US freaken A stands out as having among the world's highest cost per subscriber while delivering the 32nd rank in bandwidth. Pretty sick. The excuse is that the USA is a big, highly varied country that makes it hard to deploy at high density. What more stands in the way is we have brain aneurysms, blood clots, and calcified bones.. the USA is mortified in its regulations of spectrum and local backhaul access and politically incapable of easy fixes. We can't change that much so what comes next hinges on how to get bandwidth access to smallcells and in-building access points effectively and at greatly reduced cost.Voila! The stage is set for crusty old Comcast and Charter to enter the wireless arena. Are they too feeble to take advantage? Maybe.. thus far they have pathetic follow through in wireless."
Why boomers here don’t want John Legere to be the next CEO for $T? $TMUS is exploding their post paid subscribers growth quarter after quarter and you don’t want him? Am I missing something here?

"What do the charts say about the merger?There has been much public push-back on the merger, public hearings and lots of articles. Big mergers are controversial because they impact competitors, partners/MVNOs, labor/labor unions, etc. While this merger is between two companies in the same industry, thus consolidation of their core market, it is between two underdogs who have struggled to be profitable and hold onto their minority, narrow segments of the business. While Sprint and T-Mobile talk big about their business, government, IoT/automotive offerings, the reality is that they hold tiny percent of those '5G markets'. The DOJ, therefore, should see the merger as a way to provide more competition in the diversified mobile and IOT markets than without the merger. And because Sprint and T-Mobile cannot compete well across the board without the merger, this can provide a positive impact on market structure despite causing further consolidation. There is no doubt that the merger will positively impact competition for home broadband, a market that has very limited competition now. What the charts show is that while there has been much noise about push back in the media, the stocks are up near yearly (Sprint) or all-time (T-Mobile) highs. The gap between TMUS/9.75 and the S stock price shows that FUD remains that the deal will be approved. However, S being near its highs shows that despite some trepidation, the majority of investors think the odds of approval beat out the odds of defeat."
"This one edges up after earnings I'n our opinion. Trade entry of $60.83 yesterday, Tuesday the 7th of Feb '18. Will exit Friday morning on the momentum after the report. Five point model, like none anyone has ever built - built by a couple of millennials who scored top level Series 7 and received advanced degrees in Psychology and Sociology. Why does it work - not because statistical, technical or charting strategies or analysis, although this is a piece of five. It works because of the key. It works, because our strategies include activities such as calculating our estimated percentage of cell phone screens during the Super Bowl halftime show, average based - given on our determination of an assumed sample square, screens showing us the SNAP snapchat app face open. We then understand user direction. We understand the price of consulting in social media monitization - and an average statistical assumption of earnings, given those assumptions. These strategies can be used by anyone, daily, over and over. TMUS - easy. Easier than SNAP even. TMUS offers us all a test environment, we can walk into their stores. We can talk to the barista across the street. We can long. We can short. We can allow every other individual and entity to have their own opinion of our strategies. And we can give every cent that we take away to those who can be helped by it. Because material positions mean nothing. Trading is simply a game; a simple game. Open your eyes."
"Deutsche-TMobile should not acquire Sprint unless the price is cheap and all-stock IMO. The coming era of fixed-to-mobile wireless services will see accelerated convergence that leads to stagnant to lower combined ICT industry revenues. The overall US economy will either remain in slow growth or deflation, neither of which will be able to fuel tax revnues to the extent it extinguishes national debt. The US may be able to go on for years like that. However, it does not make sense to do M&As that please the pig investment bankers at the sake of 50% premiums over the rational valuations of the already well levered separate companies.While the buzzards are circling the carcasses, it is better for T-Mobile/Deutsche to sit back and smile at the glorious horizon. The cable companies are dying a slow death relative to their zenith position of power in the lucrative consumer marketplace. Sprint has been a zombie for years, existing on the brains of outside investors. T-M should not let their enviable position swell their heads such that they listen too intently to the harpy investment bankers... doing nothing in M&A may be the most decisive thing DT/TM can do IMO. If Softbank were to acquire Charter to roll it into a new financially structured Sprint-Charter, that won't likely deter TM's progress. The nemesis will remain to harness wireless networks efficiently to take share away from the obese AT&T and Verizon. TM can play at the user-deployed network equipment (First-mile first) as well as."

"I was with Sprint for 18 years. Started at 80,000 employees. Ended at 30,000 when I left. Sprint offered a generous severance package and I took a year off from work. Now working for the US Government. Liberals are creating fear of layoffs, life does not end after a layoff. My skill set I attained at Sprint provided me the opportunity to go anywhere. Sprint is a great company. Sprint & T-Mobile will be even greater! This merger is must for the future of wireless in this country. MAGA!"

Legere staying...BOOM!
So the combined TUMS and S will have 110 users. TMUS is adding about 0.5M this quarter. with all that incentive of free NFLX and shiat. Growth rate is what ? 1 %?Dilution causes PE to be 40. It was expensive already. Now with merger.. DEBT load is almost 1.5x of sales..
"T-Mobile (TMUS Quick QuoteTMUS - Free Report) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.51 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 101.96%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this wireless carrier would post earnings of $0.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.17, delivering a surprise of 129.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.T-Mobile, which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry, posted revenues of $20.34 billion for the quarter ended December 2020, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.88 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters."
"Zacks is whacko. The recent article points out a high volume of AUG puts. Puts are a form of insurance that seldom make any sense for small investors IMO. Who buys puts? Institutions and high work laggards. It is a lazy way to seek peace and have job security against screwing things up royally. Small investors do not have the problem of back-stopping large blocks of shares and should be placing stop-loss orders against a collapse in prices. There are options strategies that use puts as part of it that can make sense but few small investors use them. If markets become extremely oversold similar to many tech stocks during the Internet bubble collapse, writing/opening of put positions can make sense. However, that has a huge risk so is not recommended for all but the most skilled hedge fund and professionals. I know of people who did very well during previous downturns only to find themselves forced to liquidate put positions because the market continued to deline. That forced closing of position changed large paper gains into nearly total losses of those positions.Anyway, Zacks, once again, failed to provide the context/logic. Merely pointing out that there is a large number of puts or calls traded is like lighting a match in a oil distillery."
well this is anticlimactic
Sprint needs Tmus
how does T-Mobile Jump Up without carrying Nokia with it. Those wfx boxes or cans are Nokia scans with T-Mobile just white washed it with their than label. if anything T-Mobile should be thanking the very day that Nokia has the technology to bring it to this Forefront to destroy the cable companies and Verizon and AT&T all in one Fell Swoop
What is going on????
The pull back helped a lot. Now we March to $75 by December. Christmas gift.....
All time high is coming!! Great ER
T-Mobile management is increasing the emphasis on SCRUM management process. T-Mo has been using SCRUM principles for several years. This fits into T-Mobile's approach to markets as well as how services and management are implemented: the approach encumpases looking for and putting out 'pain points'... both those within a company and those that are not being addressed by competitors. That makes SCRUM influential in producing results in developing solutions and also in go-to-market strategies. This approach helps to use technology capital investments to go after both new opportunities and to create opportunities from the failing of competitors.
"They are not working on anything. Dish does what it does on every deal in the past 10 years, ask for it all. That is why they have not merged with anyone before, Ergen is hard to deal with. If this guy is getting your spectrum, believe it does not help TMUS. They should have done the MVNO rights for backhaul network rights maybe with 2 or 3 companies. They could lower costs and at certian point charge for spectrum. Dish is setting themselves up to be a middleman with no costs and all the 5G. He will do the deal I described and not pay for backhaul or 5G. MVNO builds the backhaul and TMUS builds the 5G. Dish would have a lower cost structure than TMUS at that point and they will at 100M customers in 2 years. TMUS wont know what hit them. Wireless customers are not loyal and the switch to other carriers for less cost people will flock to it."

Softbank selling its stake to DT to help cover losses from other investments...that news was released over the weekend. Just some profit taking after hours most likely.
T-Mobile is a heartless company. Check out what it is doing to its prepaid carrier Metro By T-Mobile. Dealers being put out of business left and right in their post/prepaid business. TMUS lied and cheated to make their way into a conversation with VZ. Internally they will fall apart.

"Process of elimination look at T and VZ numbers and guess what, TMO is going to killl and destroy earnings this quarter. Now the question will it effect the price. It freaking better!"
"The trial is proceeding as expected; The trial has gone straight into the testimony to support or refute the case theories. There are no surprises... none were expected because the 'case' has been tried in front of the regulators and the public over the past two years. There has been plenty of time for both the opponents and the proponents of the merger to marshal their expert testimony around legal theories. In doing so, the merging companies have worked with the FCC and DoJ to counter the opposition. We can say 'the opposing claims are already anticipated.. we baked them into the cake'. The arguments of the AGs comes across as flat-footed: they claim the merger will result in higher prices. The counter is a combination of price commitments and supply side economics for which the opposition has little response. They leave that out of the analysis along with the long-standing track record of T-Mobile and the motivation to seek increased market expansion as the long-term competitive solution.So long as Judge Marrero keeps to the law, the ruling will come down in favor of the merger/defense. That appears to be so."
Way overpriced

"Autonomous Driving reality depends on Seamless Low Latency Connectivity. This will require a combination of Satellite, Terrestrial 5G, V2V & V2X communication. Tmobile has THE BEST multi Spectrum 5G network needed to handle the massive amounts of real time data transmitted to and from the vehicle. 5G will be especially critical in densly populated areas with high traffic volumes and buildings making Satellite coverage not feasible. The value of this important piece of an Autonomous world will soon be realized!"
"I've been through four big market corrections. This one looks less scary in the short to mid-term but maybe that is just because I've ridden through similar occurrences before. The macro-scale economic picture has looked whacko since the 80s... the country has gotten enamored with fixing the downturns by going to further and further extremes. That worked so long as there were larger drivers such as the computer-networking boom followed by the Internet and telecommunications booms. Then we had the Iraq-Afghanistan boom - because there was no not a tech or foreign market explosion to exploit, we decided it was wise to pump up the economy by spending $1.8 trillion on wars that have netted nothing much other than a higher debt and a better bombs to blow up more money. That is scarily off the rails.. I can't say where that is headed. Now instead of figuring out positive ROI investments in the economy, we lower taxes by an unprecedented amount. Maybe that is all we can do, throw a few trillion into the general economy in hopes it will create an explosion of growth that will offset the prior explosions in spending on fruitless endeavors. I can't help but imagine that there is a master plan for if the tax cut fails and the US slides into stagflation instead of inflated prosperity that wipes out the vast national and personal debt levels to a sustainable level. Maybe the US and world are headed to an Orwellian like controlled macro economy... as if we are not already in a form of that. But the eventual outcome may be that the US effectively writes off its debt because the leading economies take that as the only way for balance to be achieved. If so, then the US inflato-world economic system will have been grandfathered into a world economic scheme in which, most likely, the richest 5-10% of US citizens are part of the international aristocracy while the rest maintain a declining share of world wealth. In the near term, the stock markets have been due for a correction. It may go on for a while with trading opportunities as wild swings continue before the markets settle down and then rise again. What stocks move up the most when markets bounce? Those with the highest volatility obviously. Those companies that are in high-growth sectors that have gotten overly punished. Maybe there was too much speculation to the upside and some investors got overextended on leverage... in past declines some of the most actively traded and most loved speculative companies got hit the hardest. T-Mobile is liked but I don't think it was irrationally priced and the volume has not been high. I think it will be a fair company to buy because it is growing and the market tends to look for stable growth during recoveries and shy away from the more risky stocks... nerves are worn too thin for that. However, if you want to develop a list of stocks to buy or sell at this point, TMUS might be in the top 30% but not the top 15% of the best IMO."
"""A ruling in favor of the AGs would be “remarkable,” given the arguments that they observed over the two-week trial and because it would effectively reverse the work of 40 DoJ staffers, 54 FCC staffers and the approval of two federal agencies"" $S $TMUS"
"Reasons T-Mobile went up after hours: besides the big three no other companies made big purchase therefore less competition, dish got very little and cable companies did not win any spectrum. Therefore no other companies will challenge this oligopoly in the immediate and long term. People worried that dish and cables would spend big and challenge the big three . That threat is now non existing"
The spend on spectrum shows how smart TMUS was in buying S. This is what is called VISION.

"T-Mobile is the only US operator that has a large amount of low-band beachfront property spectrum for 5G. All other competitors or DISH either have no low-band or do not have the several tens of billions of dollars and five-years of time to build a nationwide network from scratch. T-Mobile will launch their nationwide 5G coverage in December according to the latest PR. Is that 'true 5G?’ yes. Does it have enough depth of bandwidth to be the long-term, do everything 5G network? No. Can the combined T-Mo+Sprint produce a more competitive network? Absolutely yes.The proper questions for wireless is ALWAYs whether what the operators are building a competitive network and will it produce sales and profits to keep the company competitive in the future? T-Mobile will have the most competitive 5G network to fulfil most market needs over the next few years. It can benefit consumers by merging with Sprint before that momentum runs out. Bigger, Bolder, Better. The public is better served by the merger. The AG's lawsuit will fail. It is scheduled to take into the 1str quarter of 2020 for the court to determine that. It holds the stock movement back until then."
"Thanks Len , as soon you said it will crash , became a buying opportunity"
"There will be multiple motions filed in the lawsuit in coming weeks. Most of these will be procedural and may not tell us much. Some may seem to be important while are par for the course.. motions to dismiss can be routine... and just as routinely shot down. Motions to bar witnesses, lawyers (today's news of late filing to remove a former DOJ lawyer), motions to suppress testimony and evidense as being proprietary or senstive corporate inforation... most of this can be ignored or looked at for what it says about how the case is being comported rather than what it says on the surface. For example, the news that DOJ had requested to remove an AG lawyer who had worked for DOJ on the AT&T+T-Mobile merger shows that DOJ is somewhat active. It also shows they screwed up by not filing sooner which might mean they are lax... mistakes happen but this is one of the things that is routinely handled.The preliminary motion stage can reveal clues to the legal case work. Things like the witnesses, evidence requests, motions may give some indication of the strength of the case the AG's are building... I do not look for any surprises because they are on thin ice. Given that, the fact they have a lawyer who worked on the most directly related prior case at DOJ shows that the AG's may have their arguments spelled out better than in their complaint. However, it would be a big surprise if they came at this as lame as they have done up to this point IMO."
"LeGree is going to bankrupt TMobile,they can't sell any cheaper without a loss and they can't compete on content either,I smell a shift coming and it's not TMobile,sorry for the bad news Cramer!"

"Why haven't T-Mobile and Sprint moved higher than the recent range upon news that TMUS parent company, Deutsche TK, is reportedly preparing an offer to acquire Sprint?1) The rumored deal offer is all-stock - no quick buy-out redemption for current shareholders.2) The deal would take 12 -18 months to work through the regulatory and other government approvals process. It could take longer if the deal is opposed in court and the judge agrees that regulatory approval must await the court's decision.3) A merger between T-Mobile and Sprint comes at a time when the mobile broadband industry has reached a plateau and is readying for what may play out to be a capital intensive push into local/home broadband delivery as well as higher mobile broadband speeds. This has led to a) Price competition for established services including unlimited mobile plans. b) Stagnation of growth that causes operators to jump quickly on any weakness they see developing among their competitors. c) Attempts by AT&T and Verizon to package home video services and broadband with mobile services. This can be a differentiator between the top two dogs and S and TMUS. However, thus far it has not appreciably been a market influence in maintaining market share Premium video content and home service may help maintain overall margins that would otherwise deteriorate more rapidly in the congested market. 4) Details and timing of a deal are sketchy - investors don't know a) if the deal offer is real. b) what it will amount to in share price. c) The longer-term results of a merger.5) There are execution, financial and strategic risks to doing a deal vs doing nothing - for T-Mobile/DT to continue along the current stand-alone path.6) An all-stock deal would reduce Wall Street Investment Banker whackos participation. Wall Street is a big spin-machine for generating interest in major deals, particularly those that have several billions of new debt to finance and stock that is being dumped into the market. An all-stock deal would not require a large debt placement to finance it and would reduce the sale of existing shares.An all-stock deal places execution risks of a merger more equally distributed between Softbank-Sprint and Deutsche-TMobile. That would provide greater motivation for the two large conglomerates to work together. Particularly, it would keep Softbank in the game... which should work to the parent company's long-term benefit. Otherwise, SB would likely have to settle for a discounted cash buy-out, if one was forthcoming."
"Ok TMUS, we're ready for you. Wow us."
"sales growth of 54.6% in 2020 (reflecting the merger with Sprint) and 11.6% in 2021, after a 3.9% rise in 2019. ,,, Strong Buy recommendation reflects our expectation that TMUS will continue to outgrow peers .... 12-month target of $110 applies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.0x to 2020 estimate....Source CFRA"
"Real Memories Of Sprint/Nextel, Tmobile Will Get Burned And We Will Be Down To Two TELCOsI can not believe that some in their right mind would think creating another Sprint/Nextel merger again. It took us forever to clean up and get rid of the Nextel network mess. It was to costly to run two networks until we finely closed down the Nextel side. We lost a lot of customers in the process and went farther into debit in the process. So if you are a Tmobile person you can see what happen to us at Sprint and how our company and stock sank. Even back then everyone was told they would not lose their jobs but it did not take long to get rid of most to the Nextel people and then Sprint people were next in line. I saw a lot of good people get let go. Some were outsourced and then let go causing Sprint to lose customers faster.By the time all of this is over, if the merger goes through, there will be just two remaining telcos, ATT and Verizon. Tmobile will be wiped out by debit load and the lost of customers. Do you really want that?"
t-mobile is getting hit harder than sprint
Its Great that more Groups are working together to stop this Mega-Mergerhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-union-urges-states-look-173939732.html
"As reported in Barrons, Fierce Wireless and elsewhere, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has scheduled a preliminary hearing on the T-Mobile+Sprint merger. It was previously reported that California, New York, and some other States Attorney Generals have initiated investigations into the merger on similar grounds, namely the concerns over the impact on competition and benefit vs. harm the merger might have on consumers.The articles say the CPUC regulates utilities, including communications infrastructure companies. It is scheduled to render a decision next June.Does the CPUC have a veto power over the FED's decisions on the merger? That is complicated because the FED has the power to regulate things that are considered part of the national defense and security and commerce that crosses state borders. Wireless communications company both build nationwide networks and those networks serve the US public and economy with the expectation of use nationally. However, states have the right to govern operators in the areas within municipal, county and statewide jurisdictions. The problem is that they must slice down to the local impacts and cannot issue rulings that have an adverse impact or are contrary to FED rulings as determined in the national interest. That is complicated because each state or region could have different opinions about what is in the states and the broader public interest.I am not a state's rights lawyer, however, IMO the CPUC has limited authority to issue rulings that would impact the decision or timeline of the FCC and DOJ. What this, and potentially other, state public utilities and solicitor's general hearings and decisions may do it to cause delays in the FED's ruling. One or more state actions could result in lawsuits down the road. The state's activity might have some influence on how the FCC and DOJ influence the merger, including how they regard the combined holdings of the spectrum. For example, part of the FCC's prior requests for detailed information from New T-Mobile included details of plans to use combined spectrum. Opponents to the merger have requested a thorough screening and possible spin out of spectrum so it can be put up for auction."
"Any companies stock price will go up as long as they are growing.So where will TMUS price be 5 years from now?I personally think it will be in the $400 range.It's how Warren Buffett gets rich, he dumpes a lot of money in something he knows is secure and he holds it for a long time."
"Parent company Deutsche Telekom, DT, received a favorable rating by Moody's of Baa1. Among the reasons is that Moody's views T-Mobile's acquisition of spectrum as a strategic move that lowers risk. Why would it lower risk? Although not so explicitly stated, it is due to T-Mobile being in a position to mve forward with the bolstering of their spectrum position without the need to engage in relatively risky acquisitions such as of Sprint or DISH. Instead, T-Mobile has an improved ability to move forward to compete favorably by using the available capital, cash flows, spectrum portfolio and market position on their own. ""Stable momentum"" is a valuable thing in market that is seeing tectonic shifts."
"I believe if Son walks on this deal TMO owners will be on the phone begging him to buy TMO.Simple reason this merger got TMO to $90+ cause when you compare Verizons customer base and their network and share price TMO is not even in the ball park.$90+ without Sprints 2.5 spectrum and customer base turns TMO into a bouncing dead cat cause they can't survive but Sprint on the other hand can join hands with Dish or any other cable, say company"

"CTL backhaul for TMUS 4th carrier based on ATT problems.In a Congressional appearance last week, Sprint CEO Dan Hesse explained just why his company objects to the proposed $39 billion AT&T and T-Mobile merger. Aside from his previously expressed grievances — that the merger would create a wireless duopoly and stifle competition — Hesse also noted another possible paradigm: the deal could lead to Sprint being bought or acquired as well. “The most likely buyer is CenturyLink, the biggest company in telecommunications without a wireless unit,” writes Bloomberg, quoting industry analysts. Other potential Sprint buyers on the publication’s post-merger hit-list include Comcast Communications — a company that might be interested in bundling home internet, phone and cable services with wireless offerings. Most analysts agree that a Sprint purchase would come at least two full-quarters after the AT&T and T-Mobile deal has been finalized, although the idea of the Now Network being procured is still very speculative. Representatives from Sprint, CenturyLink, and Comcast all declined to comment on the report."

Things look good from here
"What is the high volume on May 21, 135 calls? Someone betting the farm?"
It seems like we add ~$10 to stock price every quarter. We should be around $170 this time next year.
"Dear Honorable Judge Marrero,On behalf of the consumer and country, and based on its merit, please set this merger gift to us free from its political bondage.Thank You,5G FOR ALL!"
Remember any move higher is now only a chance to sell even more TMUS EU's one world order data collectors
Fools buying this junk
Stock is bouncing on the 100MA in an uptrend. Time to buy folks!
Love the TVision/GoogleYouTubeTV collaboration! Watch out ATT & VZ....
"Due to voicemail issues, I had to migrate from the Sprint network to T-Mobile. Now my data service has gone from CDMA/LTE on Sprint, to GSM/UMTS on T-Mobile which is 3G. Why? The phone I purchased from Sprint doesn't have the GSM/LTE chipset. The T-Mobile store I went to said I was the first Sprint-to-TMo conversion they had done. Just imagine the ramifications of my experience, only on a far greater scale. It's going to be a catastrophe, but not until all the executives have made their money. Just like when Sprint acquired Nextel."
I am lost a lot $$$ with this TMUS they are like RED...
TMUS is down -4.91% to 59.01
It emerged from the long sleeping period after stabilizing around 105. This is a long term 5G play and move higher. It is the No 2 carrier now in terms of subscriber base.
Buy now target number is $40 in one year
"Down,Down,Down! Ugly chart points to no real support until around $49. ish"
"Well, I guess Len finally gets it right for a day. A looooong way from $80 though!"
Did they raise that fantastic divident?
Buffet doubled his stake and he is loser for big time

"One factor that gates how 5G will work its way into mass markets is how it will impact the power consumption of battery-operated devices. 5G technologies include more ways to manage power consumption including more graceful tailoring of what gets turned down and off in mobile device connections and the human interface. The power management functionality of devices must work with the network so that signaling is better optimized to achieve low power consumption. This has to be enabled in the chip-sets and antennas that are onboard the devices. 5G increases the use of multiple bands and wider bands of spectra and can use multiple-station connectivity enhanced by MIMO to connect to multiple points. More is better but crunching through bandwidth comes at a cost of higher power consumption. The proven way to deal with that is based on the ability to shrink semiconductor chips and use lower voltages, thus lower power, and incorporate more ability to lower power or shut off parts of the chip when not needed. The chips evolve to be made smaller and pack in ever increasing power management capabilities that result in lower power. Meanwhile, demand for higher bandwidth, lower latency and jitter put pressure to drive up clock rates, thus using more power. Suppliers attempt to aide this battle between ever-rising market demand for bandwidth and processing power with the power management and with higher-capacity batteries. These factors are analyzed extensively and shown on graphs that depict the individual trends and combined results so that appropriate choices can be made in the chip, mobile device and network equipment designs, How does the power factor impact how operators roll out 5G?It favors rolling out 5G in the polarity of approaches we see now between Verizon and AT&T vs, T-Mobile. VZ and T's rollouts, if they can be called that, uses the line-powered network and home devices, thus avoiding the problem that will present itself in 5G mobile devices. While that short cut has the benefit of not being dependent at first on battery devices, it uses mmWave frequency spectra which requires much higher power levels to connect on the uplink. That can be skirted by making use of WiFi and 4G connection to user devices, but, then, that is not 5G. That is probably why AT&T does not want to back down from re-naming 4G-Advanced as 5Ge. If mmWave is used as a direct connection to mobile devices, it will zap the life out of batteries.T-Mobile's 'Mobile First' approach, (I'd love to take credit for coining that but it has been used in multiple contexts), will have much less of a problem with battery-life impacts because of the use of 600MHz and mid-band spectra. The 600MHz band signals travel farther and while inside buildings multiple times better than the use of mmWave. There are design issues with the fractional-wave antennas that must be packed in with other antennas, but those are surmountable. A more difficult problem is that by traveling father and through things, low-band 5G signals interfere with each other, making it harder to pack networks densely. However, if you have the option to ""pick the problems to deal with"", it is better to build 5G starting with low-band coverage and then scale up to mid and high band. That benefits more from the evolution of the chips and layering of the 'network of networks' with multiple bands that are occurring progressively over time. And it greatly helps out in tackling problem areas including the 'rural digital divide' that has recently gained attention in Congressional hearings and media."
bought some at 61.2 each. let see how it turns out...
Simply put dish is the investment of my choice in playing out tmus -sprint . My bet dish is going to move much higher. Buying @ open

“Former Sprint Corp. CEO Marcelo Claure plans to buy 5 million shares of T-Mobile US Inc. stock.” - Kansas City Business Journalhttps://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2020/06/24/former-sprint-ceo-will-snatch-up-t-mobile-stock.html
TMUS just got another $47B of debt. That is huge.
T-mobile> At&t and Verizon :D
"The merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is 15-30 days away from an agreement that will proceed to regulatory approvals. That stage is at least 90% certain IMO.The regulatory review process can take up to two years. It probably will take as short as 14 months judging from similar regulatory actions.The parent companies, Deutsche TK and Softbank, have more than the needed majority ownership needed to approve the deal. Public investors could oppose the deal but that could be ignored. An investor lawsuit could be entered against either company, however, I think they would have little chance of derailing or delaying the deal. Final approval is around 85% certain IMO. I would almost say 'done a deal' except the review process won't start until the companies agree on the deal and submit it to regulators. That leaves their reaction to be based on general comments and positions. That unknown adds to the chance of not being approved. A little information could go a long way: A comment by the FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, after the merger proposal has been sent to regulators, for example, might add or detract from the likelihood of approval.,"
information about TMUS and S merger can be looked up at the FCC dot gov website using a search for Docket 18-197The formal document is said to be due today from New T-Mobile. That should include the request to transfer licenses from Sprint to T-Mobile and other details.
"Now that took the Smartest people in the world to find a way to take over the world without firing a shot. Germany and their one world order know as the EU LOL German's WWIII without firing a shot and they have taken over 28 countries already LOL you don't even need to make stuff up when it all so true. Amazing how dumb Americans really are as they are now getting taken over from within to become part of the EU one world orders . The DEM wits think OH they like us LOL,LOL all the time they are planning to take over America and make it part of the EU's one world order.

"The gross miscalculation of the Industry growth due to IoTIoT is the Next Big Thing because 1) the unit numbers are gargantuan. 2) It touches 'almost everything' from wearable sensors to control of a floodgate in an unattended location. 3) The Internet and communications Industry, ICT, need something new to be excited about. 4) The media has liquid hype instead of blood running through their veins.IoT is often cited as having a huge impact on mobile operators. Wait a minute, where is the money? Not there yet? OK, where are the projections and how were they derived? IoT is far from being complete hype because the degree of coverage, low cost per bit, number of connections that can be supported, security, etc. of 4G-5G networks combined with low-cost sensors with embedded radio capabilities and other contributing factors make new and enhanced applications possible.However, there is a whole lot of talk about 'big impact of IoT' with little or no supporting market numbers. The gross numbers of IoT points are enormous but most of these are already installed, such as millions of smart power meters, environmental and industrial sensors or will not be owned or installed by mobile operators. The bulk of sales will be by companies outside of the wireless operators. The mainstream equipment and network service management companies such as Ericsson and Nokia will get a small share of the IoT spend. In many if not most cases, the mobile equipment suppliers and service providers will be participating as pass-through integrators or only to supply a low-cost per unit communications service. Many of the IoT applications envisioned as driving up the numbers into the billions will be absolutely brutal in price, driving out every tenth of a cent possible. One reason for that is many high-volume IoT applications can use alternative communications methods or can use localized sensor networks that aggregate traffic and either report only if thresholds are met or on a scheduled basis while normal operating conditions are reported are communicated less often or not at all.IoT is a catch-all basket that has ill-defined boundaries in the minds of many who report on it. The numbers magically add up to 'big impact' without the rigor of knowing how they will get so big and who will get a slice of the money. ""Show me the money, not the dumbed-down hype""."

"AT&T has announced a new service plan that includes 60 channels of video service (480p similar to BingeOn) and 22Gb 'unlimited' data before throttling. The plan also includes unlimited text and voice that covers the US, Mexico, and Canada, The 60 channels of DirecTV Now is a basic package. To get HBO, Showtime and Stars costs an extra $18 per month. That raises the bill to $88/month which looks competitive. Adding a laptop or other data device costs another $20/mn, raising the total to $108, still a respectable figure. I am not sure whether the data device can stream the DirecTV package over home WiFi without impacting the 22Gb throttling threshold. If that is doable, then some cable customers might consider dropping their cable TV plans while sticking with cable for home broadband. AT&T's new service plan both reacts to T-Mobile's unlimited 'all in' marketing and is a packaging of TV video content gained from the acquisition of DirectTV. This package looks more competitive than what TMUS has faced from AT&T in the past. The question remains whether a TV package combined with high bandwidth mobile service is what a large portion of the market wants or whether the bulk of the market wants choices for their content providers on top of a voice-text-data unlimited plan?There is no doubt that this is an example of where AT&T and Verizon are heading and, thus with them, a 2/3 marketshare audience. The counter to the 'embrace and extend' BORG strategy of AT&T and VZ is the 'All In' package plus OTT content from the dozen or so suppliers including NetFlix, and Amazon, Might T-Mobile extend BingeOn to extend to home use? They can, of course, offer subscribers to use BingeOn over WiFi, that is probably already the case. What if they push into home broadband more directly? That appears to be part of the longer-term game plan but remains to be put into action."
"Better get your shares of T before you lose even more money in T Mobile LOL,LOL,LOL"
They drove the Friday 114 calls up then the stock sold off ! Selling some to buy Apple ! Want to stay in 5g
"Hopefully TMUS starts back north after the market noise settles down. The Nasdaq fell for the fifth time in six sessions as tech stocks extended their selloff.A rotation into cyclical and value stocks and away from some of the high growth names that led markets higher last year has picked up steam over the past week. The energy, financials, materials and industrial sectors have outperformed strongly over the last five trading days, while the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors declined."
"Some analyst said, If you allow the AG's to do this they are going to want to do this every time there is a merger."
"TMUS adds 400K entire quarters after ""announcing free NFLX"" users. That is about the amount NFLX added last quarter in USA..It is a joke... so it cost TMUS $12 a month..."
The junk has no tech advantages
"If Dish is involved in this merger, it only stands to weaken in TMUS. TMUS was not prepared for a No answer by the DOJ. This is one of the most unprepared mergers in a decade. TMUS should have had a contingency plan, but it just seems with Dish they are desperate."
"Masa, What are your plans to change this metric? Take another shot at $Tmus or make your move with $Charter? Sprint’s scaleAs of January 16, 2018, Sprint’s (S) market capitalization was ~$22.4 billion, making it the fourth-largest US wireless service provider in terms of market capitalization. In comparison, T-Mobile (TMUS) had a market capitalization of ~$52.4 billion, Verizon’s (VZ) market capitalization was ~$210.7 billion, and AT&T’s (T) market capitalization was ~$225.4 billion."

"Sprint has a great spectrum, which could be used in IoT in addition to Mobil communications.

"The merger of Time Warner and AT&T is hardly the same as T-Mobile and Sprint: T+TW was a horizontal merger that had been approved by the regulators under the Obama administration. It had passed the hurdle of meeting the established limits on market control. The courts rule based on laws, regulations, and precedent and they are not supposed to impose structural remedies, As such, they do not bend with political times, such as the leaning of the Trump administration to foment structural remedies rather than rule strictly on the issue of market concentration. The court test was, therefore, highly unlikely to have overturned the regulator's earlier decision. The merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, on the other hand, is in the hands of the new administration which can press its own interpretation of the laws to exact a decision that is swayed toward structural remedies to offset the apparent over-concentration that is present in the mobile sector of the ICT industry. If DOJ and FCC decide to allow the merger on that new and somewhat unconventional methodology, it would have to be contested in court in order for the new approach to be tested. Otherwise, it would stand and would likely serve as a new precedent to be considered for similar mergers."
"T-Mobile’s parent company cha-Ching news. BERLIN, May 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom on Thursday raised its medium-term core profit outlook to 3%-5% growth per year through 2024, while maintaining an annual revenue forecast of 1%-2% increase.Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to more than 1.75 euros ($2.13) by 2024, compared to 1.20 euros in 2020, the Bonn-based telecoms group, with operations in Europe and the United States, said ahead of a two-day strategy presentation.Management would propose a divided of 40-60% of adjusted earnings per share, subject to a floor of 0.60 euros that was introduced in November 2019, after U.S. unit T-Mobile agreed to take over smaller rival Sprint."
"T-mobile is hurting everyone with this price war. Yea, they can grow subscribers but have weak earnings by doing so."
===7/28/2020==$130 price target===> Exane BNP Paribas analyst Joshua Mills initiated coverage of T-Mobile with an Outperform rating and $130 price target.

"T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) today announced plans to expand its collaboration with Google across a wide array of customer experiences later this year, including establishing Messages by Google as the default rich messaging solution for millions of T-Mobile customers with Android smartphones; promoting Pixel and Android devices and the unique experiences they can deliver on T-Mobile’s industry-leading 5G network; harnessing Google One as the preferred phone backup and cloud storage solution; and embracing YouTube TV as T-Mobile’s premium TV solution."
"The Market REalist shows the churn rates for the four leading mobile players: Verizon and AT&T have churn that is less than 1% while T-Mobile is shown at about 1.15 and Sprint at about 1.7. The churn rate of all of them has come down from the levels a few years ago. This shows that the bulk of the market does not flip their service. Most of the churn occurs among a small percentage of the overall population - about 15% account for about half of the churn rate.Is there ""Intense competition"" among US mobile operators? On some levels, yes. However, there has not been enough competition to make US operators move to the top of the rosters at crafting mobile applications. Verizon's attempt at an OTT content app, go90, showed better than average prowess at app building including the important aspect of the interface. Where T-Mobile has excelled is in the MNAV, Mobile Network Applications Virtualization. MANV is a term I use to describe the building of new applications and services that must be orchestrated based on capabilities of the 4G-5G network. T-Mobile's offering of 480p video from popular content providers including NetFlix and Hulu is a prime example. There is much discussion in the industry about network virtualization of various types including CRAN, centralized Radio Access network and DRAN, distributed RAN virtualization. However, 4G-5G radio access networks remain in a state of flux of ongoing development and are extraordinarily more varied than wired endpoint networks, making the virtualization of service based on the abstraction of the hardware more difficult and business-case driven. However, MNOs can abstract Network Applications from their networks as T-Mobile has shown. T-Mo also has done this with Digits, the service is not unique in that several OTT apps now provide similar capability. However, T-Mo was the first MNO in the US to provide this as a coordinated application. The app has a 3.1 rating on the Google Play Android app store. It has about equal numbers rating the app 1-2 as it does 4-5, which shows about half of people hate the app and don't use it... if the app were from an independent startup it likely would not get venture funding and would go bust. Many of the complaints are about crashing and other things that users find unacceptable, particularly where this shows the most commercial promise, ie. the enterprise market.Ericsson and other respected industry leaders envision Telecommunication IT and applications virtualization as an essential path for MNOs to pursue over coming years. Even while T-Mobile has pushed into MNAV more aggressively than its peers, it fails along with them in doing apps at the level of 'best of their breed'. I think this shows that the mobile industry is NOT competitive to the extent and in the ways that they should be. They are pigs like the rest of us... and must be prodded by markets to do better."
T-Mobile US is down 4.95% to 124.91
What was the conversion rate of Sprint shares to T-Mobile USThank you
"No point investing in any pure telco except TMUS. They will shine in 2021, even though VZ is waking up to the threat."
Roger Houston... this is T-Mobile One.... Second Stage Booster Fired... ALL Systems GO !!!
10000 June 2nd 70 calls bought today. About .65 cents I believe. One buyer. Biggest option bet I have seen in this stock since tracking it.
"===8/10/2020==$150 price target===> Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft raised the firm's price target on T-Mobile to $150 from $140 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares after the company's Q2 results topped his forecasts driven by lower churn, higher net adds, and higher ARPU. While acknowledging part of the company's core EBITDA outperformance was attributable to temporary factors, Kraft thinks the majority of T-Mobile's expense savings were tied to strong operational performance, he tells investors."
"Sprint and T-Mobile merger is a purely horizontal merger of 2 companies in the same business which, violates US antitrust regulations.at&t Time Warner merger was a vertical merger of 2 companies not in the same business which, is why the doj lost its 2 court battles opposing the merger. In fact the at&t Time Warner merger created another competitor in the streaming service to Amazon, Disney and Netflix. If the law is followed, Sprint and T-Mobile merger will be denied."
"Why is there never fanfares for TMUS ER? Every quarter I have been trying to find out when, then boom, the ER is passed. So when is the date for this one?"
"Recent free unlimited giveaway by Sprint is the latest in its attempts to turn the tide of marketshare and bottom line losses around. This latest move flies in the face of what the CEO of parent company Softbank said he wanted for Sprint - for moves to produce a positive ROI. The free unlimited effort is, thus far, limited to specific phones that target Verizon's customers. This is a clear indication of the position Sprint is in: unable to grow share despite having the lowest prices among the top four mobile operators, and unable to raise prices, as their CFO, last summer, said was the company's goal, Sprint has shown more losses despite down to bone cost cuts in capital spending and operations. The wireless ICT industry is journeying from an era of extending coverage to the entire nation and selling service to almost anyone with a pulse and anything that benefits from data connectivity to an era of slow growth during which debt levels must be reduced while technology and business methods must be used to increase capital efficiency. Networks and devices must follow 'Moore, Cooper, Alimouti Law' to deliver about twice the performance (double the bandwidth) every 12-18 months at the same price. That is because the progress of chips, smart antenna technologies, virtualization, and applications propels the industry forward like a rapidly flowing river that no operator can swim against. Taking a few steps back, the picture the various brush strokes create is that the industry must become more streamlined. That means it should not be taking on large gambles based on rosy forecasts for revenue and synergies. The trends tend to show that 'doing more with less', particularly through innovations that can be delivered from more efficient use of spectrum and networks and through creative business practices and marketing approaches that place the customer's needs (pain points) first, will have a better chance of 'optimizing profits' in the long run IMO."
So So Going down tomorrow
Be careful with TMUS. The PEG ratio (5 year) is very negative (-6.50). This may mean that its earnings are shrinking. Its share price may tank significantly at any time.
"===12/22/2020==$160 price target===> Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan upgraded T Mobile US (TMUS) to Buy today and set a price target of $160.00. The company’s shares closed last Monday at $130.22, close to its 52-week high of $134.24."
"What a wonderful market correction! Oh happy days! More, more, more... how do you like?, how we like it!"
here the time TMUS is going down can't hold
Watch as ...... Buffet traders move in for CHEAP SHARES... close near $119
new ceo!!!!
Comcast and CNBC is becoming the joke
Scale it fly be patient
Judging from my recent experience with customer service I can only see bad things in the future for a company that can't do simple things.
"Walt Piecyk tweet in the last hour.“After sitting through 2 weeks of court testimony, it’s hard not come to the conclusion that this deal is destined to close. "" $S $TMUS $DISH"
The solution is simple. $T is too big of a company with too many parts unlike the one trick ponies of $VZ and $TMUS. Hence the archaic infatuation of looking at individual subs and micro analysis will ALWAYS find something to worry about in ATT's case even though the overall Cash Flow and Revenues are humming along just fine and in line. ATT needs to simplify it's earning reports and take off subs info and compile the +/- revenue into much fewer defined segments only on its quarterly reports. Just like Apple not showing iphone numbers.
Anybody's opinion on when this company may reward shareholders with a appropriate dividend?
see y'all in the winner's circle tomorrow
Wow thanks for the dip. Added more
Seriously what is holding this stock down? T-Mobile killing the wireless industry
Guys last chance to buy a $100 stock for $75.5All this State AG #$%$ is just an opportunity for big boys to buy your shares for cheap
T-Mobile is officially telling its customers not to use its service and instead use the communication services of its competitors like FaceTime and WhatsApp.

This is in my top 10 for 2021
sell.sell.sell.
So basically they are working harder(more customers) for the same money. Something isnt right here
BUYING OPPORTUNITY !!!!! Will be up BIG TOMORROW

"The main thing investors need to know about stocks is 1) Does the company have good manage4ment and have they been delivering? Part of that question is how reliable management has delivered results. It is not enough that they are smart, educated, have good personalities and are nice looking, the main thing needed is that they deliver results. 2) Does the company deliver results that justify a higher price? If the results are good but growth and profits are slowing, then what generally happens is the multiples such as P/E and P/S contract. The market rewards growth and momentum. 3) How healthy are the sector and the economy? These environmental factors can influence stocks in the sector and broad market. Investors should always have an exit plan such as using trailing stop-loss orders. It is better to take money off the table early during a decline and re-enter the market after the environmental risk has subsided.T-Mobile has been meeting or beating expectations for several quarters. It beat last quarter and financial analysts have raised the quarterly and annual earnings forecasts recently. That improves the outlook. A couple months back I said that if you project forward by 6-12 months that the forecasts would probably lead to a higher stock price. That has been made more likely as results have come in and forecasts have been raised. So long as the trends remain in place, TMUS remains a stock to accumulate on dips IMO."
It will over take Ma bell soon
TMUS reached a 52 Week high at 71.65
I stand by my $140 call end of tomorrow
The New Name will be Suck-er Moblie. LET THE SHORTING BEGAN!!!!!
"I believe the deal is going to go thru, someone is manipulating for personal means."
"slow growth (if any) now, TMUS should be priced PE of 10. back to $30"
Wow Tmus got great price for 2.5 ghz frequency ( More 50% rate even if everything else worth nothing on sprint side). And Stock gone by 8%.To be honest At&t and VZ is in big trouble. They don't even have frequency to support 5G deployment.
"Oh, happy days. Oh, happy days.. when DoJ and FCC put the blues away.The New T-Mobile merger is as certain as it gets.The New T-Mobile merger is as certain as it gets.The merger is 99.5% certain to be consummated. The read of the case files is a bump in the night."
"Looks like you are learning to SAY OH NO down TMUS goes LOL,LOL Why because TMUS is a Foreign Company with a Foreign EU one world order agenda LOL,LOL"
T-mobile under $90 after SoftBank Sale. I will commence looting of T-Mobile thereafter.
The FCC pausing is a political tactic because Legere and Claure stay at Trump hotel in DC. Cable is the most evil and hated industry and the Feds just let them consolidate and price fix all they want. Wireless is a commodity now and ATT/VZ lobyyists are hard at work protecting their crumbling cash cows and prices foisted upon 200M users prior to TMO kicking their butts.
Looks like merge is  % a go !
No dividend and 38 PE ratio.... that's why it is red for a while
"Sellers will regret selling, just saying"
As soon as this Merger Mess is rejected then Tmobile can get back to real business and get this stock to the $100 range.
The TMUS board is alot livelier now....love it!
"California can stop the deal on its own unless Sprint/TMUS share the synergies$$$$$$. Think about it. If the merger requires 97 and later 99% nationwide coverage, and California stands against, how can the FCC brokered conditions ever be met?"
tmus to help with Capitol Hill protests. Why don't they help with election fraud.
"Longer term, there will be not just tens or hundreds of mMHz of spectrum that can be used to displace control of access to fiber optic, cable and existing wireless interconnect, but 2-4 GHz of combined contiguous bands made more feasible by advances in technology and manufacturing methods. The removal of open-Internet rules will create waves: it could cause toll-booths to be set up and favoritism on flow of data and media content that favor the BORG operators. Longer term, however, the revolutoin that has taken place in wireless broadband will make control of fiber optic innefective as a means of setting overall industry trends. And fiber optic combined with wireless interconnect hybrid network competition will be fueled to circumvent Verizon and AT&T's relative current advantage. I don't know how the numbers work out well enough to understand how much the change in rulings equates to dollars and sense - can Verizon and AT&T charge more for access in places like New York City where high density of interconnect is required to grow? Or is it now feasible and timely to kick them to the curb?"
when is the #$%$ earnings??
new heights and no merger yet. looking good.

To all T Mo share holders to consider what's next on T mobile share price future. Now whatever price T Mo pays per share for Sprint with T Mo Shares to Soft Bank what soft bank might do is dump all T Mo shares and that will drop T Mobole shares alot once T mobile reaches highs and they sell all at those high t mobile share prices. the merger already damaged both Dhare holders . more to come ;)
No dilution......unless exercised. No one will jump ship. Too much good news on the horizon.
"Sievert is a cool dude, I like him and his vision."
Who would wanna get from mobile to boring offices.. no one!
"we have already added over 602 K net subscribers for 4th quarter thru 12/11ish. The is,, is cuz I don't get the most up to date numbers. Thus I just say what is already out there on the street. We looking at over 2 Mil Net adds for 2020, the year of RONA. Not to bad!!! This stock will be over $140 After 4th quarter results, so all those investing will be rewarded nicely! Merry Christmas to All!!"
"customer service - it's actually the customer aggravation department - dropped T-Mobile. After several trips to an actual physical store (actually 2 different ones) and multiple phone calls, my combined several hours of effort went ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE! I was lied to more than once. I am incredulous - what utterly shabby treatment they deliver."
"Marcelo Claure spelled out the basic rationale for the merger: the combination of the two company's spectrum and networks will create an eight times increase in capacity that will put downward pressure on pricing. Marcelo made the analogy of a factory that increases to 8x capacity: it would have a lower COG, cost of goods sold and would be motivated to lower prices in order to fill up the capacity, thus increasing the sales and profits. That has been the basic factor that resulted in T-Mobile's ability to offer lower pricing and 'all in there' packages including freebies like NetFlix, that has resulted in higher sales and profits. The long-term benefit is the growth of marketshare and the ability to grow into diversified wireless segments.Claure also talked about what would happen to Sprint if the merger is not approved: Sprint would need to spend about $25 billion on 5G. However, that would not build a nationwide network. It would require Sprint to trim its objectives to building out in metro areas as it is now doing. That financially and spectrum constrained strategy would result in Sprint becoming a different kind of operator, one that would likely need to trim the number of employees and store locations. Why? Because it could not compete in rural and small-town America because competitors will hold a financial and market scale advantage.These arguments have been mostly ignored by the opposition. That is because the core rationale makes sense. The FCC is in the process of studying T-Mobile's 5G deployment models: that will show that the combined customer base plus the combined spectra/networks will result in the ability to deliver a wireless broadband replacement to much of urban and rural America. That has an impact on both the wireless competition and on cable and satellite competitors."
DISH is working with DoJ and Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank to smooth the remaining issues needed to complete the side deal that allows approval of the merger.The AG's case will probably be dropped if this follows through.
"That's #$%$ insane, will buy more tomorrow morning for rally"
"T-Mobile (TMUS) has been on a five-year upswing: going from a low around 8 to the current price level of 60, a gain of over 7 times, That is a compound rate of around 48% per year. To coin a phrase of former Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, ""pretty amazing, huh?""With such sterling past gains, can TMUS continue to move higher? Sure, but only after periods of consolidation and continued results.With the mobile industry maturing and consolidation between wired and wireless communications and data networking, isn't shake out of the converging ICT industry likely? Yes. However, the basic formula for success remains valid: wireless is an enabler of social and economic life. It increases productivity in the overall economy. That is just the backdrop... some individual companies will become the losers in the process of survival of the fittest and most agile. What will determine success in wireless is the most efficient harnessing of the core values it brings to the economy and personal and social spheres. And that depends on harnessing of spectrum and networks that provide the springboard. T-Mobile remains on tract to produce higher gains than competitors over at least the next three years IMO. That does not mean that gains will occur at the rate of 48% going forward. However, so long as result come in along the lines of the consensus forecasts, the investment theme remains valid... ie. to accumulate on dips for long-term gains."
tmus longs can just wait and collect that divident
"TMUS and S are in M and A mode, together or others involved. Any one know who all is involved in the mix??????"
"TMUS and S remain buy-accumulate despite the short-term pullback.. which I had warned about several days ago as a time to put in stop-loss orders or take some profits. With the stock now at a support level it becomes more bullish for long-term accumulation. The stock may well move down 4-5% to a lower support level. That won't change the long-term outlook, price targets, or improved prospects if the merger is approved."
"Keep your powder dry.“In a quarter when Verizon sacrificed growth for profitability, and AT&T sacrificed profit growth for customer growth, only T-Mobile delivered customer growth and profitability growth, beating consensus on both,” Sievert said. “We’re about to take all of their customers.”T-Mobile sees the good times continuing in 2021, as the cost savings and economies of scale from its acquisition of Sprint kick in. The company has already achieved $1.3 billion in annual cost savings since the combination closed in April. CFO Peter Osvaldik said on Thursday that T-Mobile expects to see $2.7 billion to $3 billion in annual synergies in 2021. That includes savings from combining networks, brand and marketing budgets, and reduced administrative and back-office costs."
Merge done deal ! Bank  on it !
"Preface:The 'hype is ripe' about 5G and that creates confusion and misunderstandings about where growth and profits in the mobile segment of the converged ICT industry will be generated. 5G standards are set by the 3GPP/5GPP standards group. 3GPP issues releases of the wireless standard that does not coincide exactly with the generations because many of the technologies that comprise the3 standards overlap and carry over to the next with from no change to moderate or to the further extent of using new waveforms. 5G does not use new waveforms as could be said for the jump from 3G to 4G. That required a change from WCDMA to OFDMA/FDMA which meant that 3G networks were/are not upgradeable to 4G. The signals can not use the same spectrum bands - why the FCC released 700 Mhz and AWS spectrum bands and operators paid a combined about $70 for it and the roll-up of other licenses. They needed 'greenfield' spectra to deploy 4G. The 5G standard has been released even while some portions of the 5G NR standard will not be finalized until 2020. The nature of the wireless standards is that they will remain a 'work in progress' because it takes years for them to unfold during which time market applications have evolved and promising new technologies have gone from the research labs to the stage of being practical for use.One of the myths promulgated by many in the industry is that 5G NR, new radio, is a new waveform'. The waveform has enough to differentiate itself from LTE 4G-Advanced to technically call it a 'new waveform'. However, 5G NR is based on MIMO-OFDMA, the same core technology that IEEE 802.16e WiMAX and 4G/4G-Advanced were based. In one way, 5G NR is more like WiMAX than 4G-Advanced: It has adopted OFDMA as the primary waveform for the uplink. It does greatly extend what's called 'adaptive modulation' so that SC-FDMA, OFDMA, and new '5G waveforms' can be used while maintaining backward compatibility. 5G increases the 'opportunistic' use of waveforms, carrier aggregation, and frequency access modalities. That could eventually extend to using both FDD and TDD in the same carrier band on the basis of how that would work to improve network performance on the fly. Howe3ver, for that to work out the network would already have to be populated by devices capable of using the 5G methodologies.Many industry hacks are saying that 5G is a 'new waveform'.. and then going on to explain how the waveform is being made to coexist with 4G-Advanced. Give a technology to the marketing department and they will screw up the telling of it."
Is CTL finally merging with TMUS? They bought back all their Senior Notes and Refied them for a merger. TMUS and CTL would give T and VZ a run for their money. They would have backhaul finally.

"Tmobile stockholders will like this: Great News that the MegaMerger has lost steam. It is now obvious the true intention of the Merger was to corner the market with three Mega Companies. The only Benefites would be Higher Prices and less choices, That's the Norm in these types of MegaMergers. It was funny that they used China as the reason for their MegaMerger. Thinking that people would fall for the 5G excuse. Hurry up and Build it before the Chinese do. What a Joke. Just more Investor Hipe so to scam money."
"TMUS has dropped about 8% since reaching a high around 101. What could longs have done to maximize profits?Longs of the merger stocks should be smug after their stocks vaulted as much as 45% higher in short order. Prior to the move higher we discussed the rise in the stock options for Sprint (S): the call options had seen some buying but remained pretty quiet. The prices had jolted up when S shot from a low of 4.26 to the 5.00 level the week before the big move. That move resulted in gains of 2X-4x for many of the closer-in call options. The big move the next week shot options prices to high levels. I mentioned the strategy of selling covered calls rather than selling the long positions.A scan of the various call options for expiration dates over the next three months shows that implied volatility shot up, the prices, of course, shot up with the now in-the-money calls having gone up by as much as 10X or more. The out of the money calls are a different story: the premiums are low. These have dropped since TMUS and S have dropped off a lot from the highs. The strategy of selling slightly out-of-the-money covered calls during the 2-3 day peak period would have paid off, a textbook strategy, would have paid off handsomely because the calls could now be covered (bought back) at a fraction of where they were sold. The sale of covered calls can often be repeated: “Wash, rinse and repeat” cycle to achieve 10-30%+ annual gains while seldom being sold out of the underlying position.So what do longs do now? You can hold for future gains which is the lazy way and can result in upsets. Or investors can use the trend-following stop-loss algos good brokers have available to defend against drops in the market or other causes. And they can continue to use the coveraged call strategy when the situation arizes as it did over the past days. Study up on it if you aren’t using more than the ‘buy and pray’ of the novice and lazy-brained investors."
Hello...Hello Hello ..hey Hello! HELLO!! okay then fu and goodby
Contacting your AG ahead would guarantee win in court if incause theres losses on shares since AG will ask court to ask for guaranty from T Mo and S print that this merger will not drop the shares and damage losses to both companies share holders. later time will not do much it must be talked and discussed in court by AG and both companies to protect all share holder of both companies.

NEW VALUATION: With T-Mobile loss of income over gimmicky deals + ADD $Billions of Dollars of anchor debt EQUALS stock value of NO MORE than $52...so T-Mobile HAS MORE PAIN BEFORE GAIN
"For TMUS to grow from here, a new CEO will be necessary."
Will all the states that are sueing to block the deal willing to offer tax incentives and joint partnerships to help Sprint compete with the big 3? Since the government wants to get into picking winners and losers they need to have skin in the game.
This called good earning? Its better to get Bankruptcy.
"Who is leading in network virtualization among US mobile operators? It is not that easy to tell because all of them talk as if they are the leader. So I did some informal research. I picked among the best methods of virtualizing different aspects o the network and combined them with the operator's names. The name that came up the most was T-Mobile. I also found that T-Mobile is hiring engineers skilled at stuff like Ansible network automation and open cloud virtualization methods. I have a few Linux Centos 7 virtual servers and am considering using Ansible to take advantage of what are called PlayBooks that can be used as starting point templates to automate tasks. That appears to be a good choice because it reduces costs and there are many leading-edge server stacks and applications that can take advantage of it. That also provides a way to extend a network easily and in a well-documented way with clients who can make use of the same sets of public domain or proprietary playbooks. The automation of standardized cloud server platforms is something that is a current 'wave of the future' in providing more efficient virtual servers of multiple types that can be easily containerized, secured and controlled. Parts of MNO's networks remain hidden.. the core RAN is not normally exposed clients except for their own private LTE/5G network.I am looking into this to help figure out how well the MNOs are prepared for 5G virtual applications etc."

"The short term chart has turned extreme bullish because TMUS has broken out to new highs after multiple attempts on higher than average volume. Stockconsultant and stockcharts sites are among those to observe this.Does this mean TMUS and S will rise straight up? Of course not. Investing has become a 'Game of Tools' in which it is usually not the 'best man' that wins but the steadiest at using the best available tools of the trade. Investors must compete with full-time traders and with their own time, psyche and capital limits to buy and sell to beat the market. The top 5%, according to numerous studies, make about 80% of all stock market profits. If you use simple to understand tools, such as setting conditional buy orders to buy as stock starts a move higher rather than ""I'm smarter than the pros, I will buy at the lows!"".. as the falling knife slices through your outstretched hands. Buy only based on confirmed personal skills and attention span and/or using programmed trade executions. If you are not doing that, pitty the fool."
great guidance ...beat eps ..little miss revenue .
"Seems like it's TMUS / S concerns again, though S only off slightly in the pre."
TMUS merging with S with that huge amount of long term debt just for customers? There is usually large for a wireless provider only. TMUS will pull back if they accept the merger. That and giving away the 4th carrier. Ouch. TOO MUCH for S merger.
"Verizon's results showed the market leader is vulnerable. This comes at a point where questions of whether T-Mobile can continue to grow as competitors have all responded with unlimited data plans. T-Mobile offers lower prices while its networks have improved to be able to make marketing claims of becoming 'equal to the high priced spread'. However, T-mobile is still viewed by a large segment of the mobile market as margarine compared to Verizon and, to a somewhat lesser degree, AT&T, as the 'butter'. Verizon's losses may show that a growing part of the market views mobile services more as equal commodities or, more correctly, a comparable basket of features and services, so that they are willing to change service providers."
"Man, what a buy opportunity. Was waiting for TMUS to head to under 110. With new iPhone 5G and Samsung FE 5G phones, this baby will rise up to $130 levels."
The pre-market price of Sprint (S) shares went down over 14% - an arbitrage strong buy based on the likelihood of the deal closing.
Do I hear a split???????????????
"TMUS joins SP500 on Monday , it will be 80+ on Monday"
When will T-Mobile put the horrible Sprint out of business?
Now this is funny and WOW lets just raise Tmobile to $299 per share. Must have been a late Friday night for those Chinese Pumpers. The real truth is that TMobile is pumping their stock just to keep it up and this will drop like a rock if the BS Merger goes through just due to the massive debt load. Tmobile shareholders sure are not going to like this when their stock tanks with this Exciting Merger
Y thing looks nt moving? Any thoughts?
"TMUS has moved to the upper end of its 18-month range as the company has turned in good results and the prospects for the merger being approved by US regulators has shown some signs of improvement, namely, lack of negative and some reported (Washington Post) positive rumors.This tends to confirm that if the deal is approved, the stock of New T-Mobile will move higher as previously thought. However, the move now does not necessarily mean TMUS will break through the range to new highs. The regulatory procedure involves hearing from the merger denouncers and Verizon and AT&T will be moving forward with their 5G plans. VZ or T could announce more aggressive plans for 5G deployments (they already have to some extent). There is a threat, although highly speculative, that VZ or T could make a move to acquire DISH's spectrum or the whole company and, coincidentally, announce plans to deploy 5G nationwide using the expanded spectrum bands. That move is more likely to come from Verizon than AT&T since T might have less chance of gaining regulatory approvals IMO. Verizon might view the acquisition of DISH's spectrum as improving their ability to compete against the aggressive plans of New T-Mobile. Industry analysts have in the past questioned whether Verizon holds enough spectrum to cover needs over the next several years. VZ's response has been that they do have enough as they plan to make use of 3.5-3.7 and mmWave bands and 'other options'. The speculation has been that other options infer the acquisition of DISH."
By Blocking this Merger both Tmobile and Sprint will be saved from a big disaster https://finance.yahoo.com/video/doj-continues-probe-sprint-t-212959476.html

"TMUS dropped 3.4% on Sprint and Comcast+Charter being tied up for two months in talks. Thus far, no deal has been put on any table but discussions are moving closer to frameworks that look reasonably doable: The price of Sprint (S) shot up this morning and then pulled back to stay well within its recent range. That was because early expectations of a full merger taking place subsided to the likelihood that a deal between the cablecos and Sprint would more likely be an extended MVNO or joint network development deal rather than a direct capital investment and ownership in Sprint itself. Softbank's Massa Son appears eager to stir up the pot to make a deal happen with either T-Mobile or Comcast-Charter. T-Mobile recently spent $8 billion to acquire ""beachfront property"" 600 MHz spectrum that can be combined with mid and high-band spectrum using either licensed or LAA LTE+WiFi/unlicensed spectrum. T-Mobile's has 30-45 MHz of overall low-band spectrum that can provide a path to deliver broadband to the premises when combined with higher bands. In other words, while T-Mobile has a go-it-alone alternative to striking deals with either Sprint or the cablecos, Sprint has much more limited options, some of which look uncompetitive going forward. The CEO of parent company Deutsche Telekom has repeatedly said that a more strategic partner for TM would be Comcast, and, to a lesser degree, Charter than Sprint. The shift in interest back to a deal with Sprint stem from Massa Son's willingness to do a deal in which Softbank takes a minority position and the cable companies locking themselves from doing separate deals with wireless players over the next ~11 months. That could shift back to a hook-up between T-Mobile and the cablecos either as an alternative MVNO supplier top Verizon or as a joint network development.Perhaps the most creative arrangement, one that has not been mentioned, is for both Sprint and T-mobile to supply shared MVNO capacity to Comcast and Charter while the two cablecos agree to provide cost-effective access to their fiber optic networks including branched capacity deep into the local network that could be used to build 5G smallcells and distributed networks. That type of arrangement has been done in some parts of the world such as the Netherlands where the costs of building multiple networks are prohibitive of government mandates to supply service throughout the country. The objective of such an arrangement in more densely populated regions is to reduce costs compared to building a duplicative deep network and wireless capacity."
Up BIG AH....whats up?
"Only downside for TMUS is that they loose the Sprint spectrum. Thats was the only value Sprint had to offer. As a standalone company TMUS has risen up against VZ & T. TMUS is the only company to add subscribers & show +ve cash flow every qrtr this is just a bump on the road.. Option PUT trades will play out this week & next, following these two weeks stock price will revert to the mean around $65.00..."

"We are the BORG. You will be assimilated. Resistance if futileThe digitized 5% ownership BORG techno-society has arrived. The efficient cube-shaped ship wants only one thing, to gain control over all of earth's governments, people and resources. 'We, (the BORG) Won't Stop!""Nonsense? Economists and societal experts explain that much of the gutting of 'middle America' and small towns across the nation is due to mechanization of factories and farms/Agra. The consolidated supply chains and Big Box Stores have taken over the brick and mortar 'Mom and Pop' retailers. That started before the Internet and SmartPhone transformed the world as we know it. eCommerce companies that are owned by fewer and fewer people as they squeeze out the masses have reshaped America and most of the world. That is the Orwellian world we now live in. 5G will put AI and mobile eCommerce and payment systems 'on steroids'.Point of ContextI am not trying to call people to arms to stand out in front of the tank. However, we, our government/society should know how we have reached the current socio-economic stage and the ramifications of where we are headed. It is not up to individual firms to do much more than bend the direction the whole of society takes because they are both unable to do much other than help to seek positive changes in how they are governed. The BORG Empire was purposely created similar to the Medical establishment... they both do great things but once given unequal power over society, watch out. Is this a rant? Several years ago when I voiced these concerns they looked much like that. Now the top 5% of citizens hold the vast majority of wealth and automation of white collar jobs is here. Having a drone-like BORG society with a supreme leader at the top is not all that far fetched."
nice gain finally
TMUS Please make Amazon the 4th Carrier we want all the amazing devices tied to Alexa through 5G and I will have one monthly cheap fee that I can get everything. Economy of scale from Amazon that will be amazing and TMUS will realize then they gave up too much.

"If the NY SD DC would overturn the DOJ and FCC rulings, Judge Merrero would likely not be pushing the case on a break-neck fast-track and would do more to discount the defense's testimony. The courts have not overturned such joint rulings on mergers and only oppose them rarely. (This DOJ sued to block the AT&T+ Warner Media merger... which I agreed with rather than with the prior Obama administration DOJ). The regulators let AT&T and Verizon acquire too much - should have stopped allowing acquisitions by them several years ago IMO... then the problem of over-concentration would be less and this merger would have not been so much of a problem meeting HHI 2500 number. Teh culprits of consolidation? VZ and T. .. not the small fry T-Mobile and Sprint."
"T-mobile is so happy with the increasing in post-paid subscribers. But, wait! The increasing is low end users. People are moving ahead eventually and T-mobile will go down. Why? Because it is not improving in quality but just cutting fees to attract low end users. The competitors are moving fast ahead by acquiring different advanced diversified companies to suit high end users. T-mobile will go down as time goes on."
"right a chance to sell even more LOL,LOL"
FCC is trying to free up more 5G spectrum. This even further dilutes the value of the purchased spectrum.

T-Mobile US reached an all time high at 122.58
"TM had been trading at $78 without DOJ approval, without Dish deal to create 4th player, without last quarterly all-time records, without the like 50 mil S subs they're adding with all the needed spectrum, without the like $40b in synergies, and with more AGs suing, etc. And, after ALL that and then some (no repricing), it's up like a peddly 2 bucks a share? Just read that worldwide McDonald had like $5b in rev compared to TM's like $10b. TM does twice the revenue as McDonalds? Amazing! Anyway, was expecting $85 min (if not $90) on the DOJ approval. How can this not even have gained 5% on the day?"
"Holy smokes. TMUS is dropping too much. Too many merger heroes just running away now?Wow.. I had TMUS just after the last judge gave the merger the go sign, then I was out.I thought I might have been out too early. I am not this fortunate with all of my stocks but fortunate enough."

"Got 428 Mbits/sec early in the morning, up from 330 on 12/12/2020. BTW, I'm on Mint Mobile, an MVNO of T Mobile. South Florida 5G."
"When will 5G kick into high gear for T-Mobile and Sprint/NewTM? It has. However, much of what is taking place is behind the scenes and it not being glorified by lame announcements such as those of the Dueling Bandits Verizon and AT&T who each have claimed to be 'First 5G' and the many firsts that some PR department loves to sicken up the space with. Many technologists have the opinion that 5G will take well into 2020 to be ready for a prime time for fresh network/band deployments. That is because the newer version of 5G, 5G NR, New Radio, is coming available now so that when you add 6-12 months for it to ramp to satisfying commercial availability it will be in 2020.5G NR is being deployed now. The network infrastructure and devices that can take advantage of the New Radio, virtualization, and other features are just entering the market this year. T-Mobile has announced trials and given a few demos of devices made using Qualcomm's latest 5G NR capable chips. It includes 4G/5G radio architecture with discrete process implementations (some common functions). The chip set capabilities include several variations of the RF sections and matching antennas. Third-party vendors also supply antennas. Qualcomm has won most RF chip business because they have invested heavily in the process technologies and the RF designs which put them on top in performance. Blah, blah, blah....All that matters to investors is that NewTM has a competitively daunting array of spectra bands available to deploy the wondrous New Radio platform.Why does it matter... how unique of a position that put NewTM? About as unique as can be for this industry. The combination of the array of usable spectra, with a beachfront combo of 600 MHz and 2.5 GHz augmented by other 5G bands cannot be matched in nearly the same way by Verizon or AT&T. That is a major reason why T-Mobile ignores some er, analysts who have said that the company should give up the pursuit of Sprint and go it alone. The going it alone with 18% marketshare concentrated in a single part of the business is a fools game. Go back to basket weaving."
TMUS is going to hit $60 soon. It is in a no win situation. The merger goes through it has to share spectrum with a competitor at a negotiated amount. The merger doesn't go through S gets merged and their competitor rides the network for free. That is down pressure of the stock. I have been suggesting the competitor to give something back in trade in lieu of just cash. I cant find many to offer anything back but CTL that TMUS really needs.
ATT will go bankrupt soon. Future is $TMUS
"No reason why not, here."
Good news VZ loses to TMUS yet again. TMUS is still very cheap compare to VZ
what is going on today????
Drexel Hamilton Initiates TMUS a Buy Rating with a PT of $80.0/share! Time to climb up and finish strong for the week.
What I don’t understand is why masa would want to sell T-Mobile? Its future is more promising compared to his other assets. In addition to sell the shares does he need approval from other shareholders besides Deutsch telecom?
Bounced off the 50dma...going higher.
how do you owners of t mobile feel about John Legere not being ceo anymore.Since he was the face of the revise tmobile and how much do you know about the new incoming ceo?
"It looks like the merger has moved forward; The immediate hurdle was codifying of terms in the terms sheet that was needed to pursue a final agreement that can be submitted to the BODs for approval, and then on to regulators for their approvals. The merger is about 95% certain IMO."
"Nice to see a 2,000,000 after hours share buy @ $63.83 @ 17:39:52. Let the gains keep rolling in, as the future for TMUS just keeps getting brighter."
"""T-Mobile CEO (kind of) changes his tune about Comcast's wireless service"" Bizjournals.The primary factor in the approval of the merger by the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, is that it not cause over-concentration such that it leads to price collusion among the remaining market participants. The NewT-Mobile proposal argues that the industry has become broader so that the hybrid fiber-cable companies, satellite, and MVNOs are now in the same market, thus reducing the degree of concentration. In the past, including up to about 18 months ago, John Legere publicly dismissed the cablecos ability to compete in the wireless arena. He may not have been wrong but now that stance is seen as being the opposite to what the merger proposal to the FCC and DOJ says: it says that the cable or hybrid fiber and cable (HFC) as they are also called, MVNOs and satellite companies are competing directly for the same broadband and media customers. John Legere is attempting to walk that back. On his side is the fact that over the past year the cable companies are gaining new subscribers at a more rapid pace the Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint, vaulting into second place behind T-Mobile in terms of subscribers gains.The problem with the earlier position is that it did not serve much of a purpose - why rag on the cablecos at a time when they had yet to enter the fray? I should have been guessed that this would come back to haunt the argument that the cablecos are now part of the market mix that the DOJ should plug into the HHI and other considerations for the structure of The Market. Its probably is not a big strategic flub and can be chalked up as coming with the territory of being an outgoing, flamboyant CEO who has been very effective in shaping the image of T-Mobile as the pro-consumer, pro-ease of use, etc. company.A new theme song might be ""If I could turn back time..."". Don't we all wish we could make some moves differently?"
5G is barely getting off the ground... for everyone expecting it to be 100% different within a week need to calm down and be realistic. TMobile will figure it out and everything will be fine. breathe

Sabotage?? What the heck happened?
7 million subscribers for 2019 and stock still $78? I see something not right lol. T Mobile may not need Sprint but it definitely needs Spectrum which Sprint has got it all ;).
"Not sure if the rally lasts, now TMUS has to absorb the S debt."
"Thanks to the ATT/TWC deal now SPRINT/TMOBILE consumers can see what is getting ready to happen to them. Higher Prices, and Less Services and Perks. ATT did tell Regulators that they would not raise prices and they have now done it twice in one week. Move over Rover and let Tmobile take over WeeWee,"
TMUS news is now trading assets and services and not cash deal with Dish? Does this seem nutty or just odd? There is more to this story. Dish doesn't have assets unless there is some spectrum hole?
Needs a few weeks to digest the news.
Nice bounce! Now lets get back to $100...where it should be :)

"If a big cable/media/tech company were to want a 5G network of their own, who would they target for Buyout? Hmmm, TMUS trades at 30-50% discount to ATT, VZ and has the only High Capacity 5G 3 layered spectrum network in the Country. Also, no old legacy wireline units to deal with. Pure Ultra Capacity 5G wireless play. Only a fool would invest in the over bloated ATT and VZ!"
"Ericsson announced new field tests of the company's Multi-operator DOT DAS type 5G-LTE ready system that incorporates massive-MIMO smart-antenna capability. Massive MIMO (also referred to as' Massively MIMO' technology) can use 32x32, 64x64 or 128x128 component antenna array elements. These can be electronically aimed/steered to create signal paths from the array to user's devices. Newer phones have up to 4x4 MIMO built in, allowing them to send and receive signals along multiple pathways. When used with the Massive-Mimo in-building DAS, links between them have improved signal strength and reliability. The reliability of the connection is enhanced because the antenna array actively beam-forms the signals even while the user is moving within the building. The signal may travel along alternate paths and multiple signals may be selected which provide the best service quality for a given location at that specific microsecond moment of adaptation to the changing surroundings. OK, why is this important to T-Mobile? After all, Sprint recently reported working on Massive MIMO and the technology will be available to other competitors - I'm sure Ericsson would love to sell it and other 5G ready equipment to 'all of the above' customers. Ditto Nokia, Samsung and others who are not exactly laying back on a beach sipping drinks.It is opportune for T-Mobile because they have more recently gained momentum into the enterprise markets. While Verizon and AT&T can benefit as well, they are in the position of defending turf more than unleashing expansive un-tilled fields. This is part of the capabilities that are standardized within the latter releases of the LTE standard, ie. '5G'. Particularly the ability for the in-building units to be used for multiple operators. That provides a new path for T-Mobile to push into enterprises with the added message that 'We are built into your enterprise as part of the 5G fabric as well as your current preferred operator.. give us a shot at your contract or as your alternative to the preferred.' It also allows T-Mobile to drive the DIGITS ability for enterprises to shift to a BYOD relationship with employees: they bring their mobile phones on which the corporate number ring into. That potentially breaks the lock that the leaders VZ and T have held on about 85% of the enterprise.I can see where this is going, and it looks likely to help extend TM's push into the enterprise and some government business."
Sprint is Worth way more than T Mos low offer of 26.5 billion and if merger falls S will have more buyers for 1 and half or even 2 x more than that. Sprints worth more in assets and Spectrum in $100s of billions so who cares of T Mo merger fails? theres more money in the current S price with merger and even more money without merger. S is good here .
"C'mon T-Mobile let get our groove on, the locks are off. Let's take more share from AT&T and Verizon. What are you waiting form"
"It will not surprise me that c band eventual price tag is more than 100 billions, the higher the auction the higher the the stock price for T-Mobile , but the lower it will be for att and Verizon"
"bet you are now learning to SAY OH NO down TMUS goes LOL,LOL,LOL like the Foreign Company T Mobile is with their hidden agenda LOL,LOL,LOL"
$TMUS - Strong earnings and future growth is locked. See new highs coming and should break $150 within next few weeks.
"A move by Softbank to make an unsolicited offer to acquire Charter cable can be seen as both a last-ditch effort by Softbank to position Sprint as a front run player in the coming 5G quad-play market. If this bid overcomes hurdles, it would pit Charter-Sprint against the consolidated service offerings of Verizon and AT&T. There would be several caveats: 1) It must overcome the Comcast-Charter agreement that requires joint approval of any wireless deal. However, that may become irrelevant due to time frame and precedent of required regulatory approvals. The deal would amass the debt of both companies. However, Softbank would be supporting the deal, perhaps with some additional funding from Malone and other sources. And the combined HFC+wireless network would be limited to Charter's cable network footprint and about 30 million subscribers.Major positive of the merger of Sprint+Charter would be the leveraging of Sprint's 2.5GHz spectrum with Charter's in-home and metro gird cable and fiber optic HFC, hybrid fiber, and cable, network. That has the potential to get a jump on competitor's efforts to push wireless broadband into homes and offer quad-play services.This may also be viewed as a way to put pressure on Deutsche Telekom-TMobile to do a deal with Softbank-Sprint. The combination of the two junk yard dogs is seen as providing cost savings but has had problems. An ideal combination would be between HFC and mobile wireless network operators both from a regulatory approval perspective and leverage of 'future proof' networks platform."
"===01/06/2021 price target $172 ===> Bernstein analyst Peter Supino maintained a Buy rating on T Mobile US on Thursday, setting a price target of $172, which is approximately 30.77% above the present share price of $131.53."
"Mike Sievert is suck a suckupT-Mobile stands with the Black Community. We firmly believe that racism, hatred, and inequality have no place in our world—and every person has the right to feel safe, seen, and heard.At the same time, we know that systemic racism is real. It has been persistent. And it can’t be wished away. If we want a better world, we have to ACT to create it.We mourn the senseless killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and all of the victims of racial injustice across the country and around the world. As George Floyd has been laid to rest, I want to be clear that we at T-Mobile are firm in our belief that Black Lives Matter—and we stand for change, for justice, and for equity.Across history, we’ve seen that real progress often follows real adversity, if it is addressed with intention and urgency. Together we can and we must seize this moment—and sustain it into the future.At T-Mobile, we are committed to growing, learning, and evolving. We have spent the last two weeks listening more closely and learning from our Black employees and from voices all across this country. We have been intently focused on identifying immediate steps we can take for our team, our company, and our communities.The Un-carrier has long stood for Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion—and that will not change. We are committed to support a diverse market with a diverse organization. We are a stronger company because of the diverse talent, diverse backgrounds, and diverse experiences of our team today.But we need to do better.So, we are making significant changes. We will bring more diverse talent and better representation of minorities into leadership roles through new programs and processes that improve how we hire, how we recognize and reward people, and how we mentor or develop our talent to grow their careers. We are taking steps, such as our decision this week to ensure every job we fill and every promotion we make should include a diverse slate of candidates for the opportunity—and our high potential management and executive talent programs will include significantly increased participation by people of color. Intentional steps like these are an important start, and they are just the beginning. We will also work to ensure better inclusion across our business, and deliver on plans to continue this conversation with our teams and educate them to ensure we have an inclusive workplace.We are also establishing programs to support Black businesses and minority communities across the country. Much of this work is already underway as a result of the diversity partnership and Memorandum of Understanding we signed with six National Civil Rights organizations last year, including our commitment to fund their important work on behalf of all Americans with $25M in grants. We recognize that we have an opportunity and the responsibility to take even more action—and we will.Our magenta team remains committed to keeping families, colleagues, and businesses connected during this complex and historic time. While we do that, we will embrace this moment to use our position to help make change a reality. We are listening and learning, and we accept the challenge to do more and to make a difference.As a society and as a company, we simply must do better. We’ve started this important work, and we’ll keep at it until real change is accomplished, and beyond. That’s my commitment.We are for you. We are with you.Mike Sievert CEO"
"Verizon is marginally higher while AT&T shot up 4-5% today on news that it fared better than expected last quarter and is not seen losing ground to competitors. There has been a disparity between the valuations of Verizon and AT&T compared to T-Mobile and Sprint. The two largest operators are valued at lower multiples even while they pay a dividend to shareholders. That is not unusual - mature companies that have low growth tend to trade at lower multiples to faster growing, usually smaller competitors. However, the amount of difference may have become unjustified as it is tied to the prospect that the smaller operators will grow marketshare. Of course, Sprint has not been growing and has continued to lose money with the resulting increase in debt, recently reported at over $38 billion. The mobile operators are experiencing a shift in how marketshare is figured: content and other services have grown in comparison to other components. That offsets the impact of the changes in subscriber counts. Very roughly, this diversifies the market between those gaining ground in video services and those who fail to capitalize on it enough to grow overall sales or, at least, offset declines in unit pricing for the unlimited service packages. That measure can be used for both operators who sell their own OTT content service and those, like T-Mobile and Sprint, who package popular OTT service provided by market leaders NetFlix and Hulu respectively. T-Mobile's market strategy is the 'all in there' rolling up of additional services within premium best-of-breed service packages. That has been a winning strategy as it offers simplicity and overall value.However successful T-Mobile's strategies have been, analysts and the market will always be looking for how well it is holding up. The 30,000 foot perspective is that there is a battle between the more aggressive T-Mobile (and Sprint?), and the scale advantage of the larger companies who are seen to leverage that scale position to engulf content, IoT, and government & enterprise markets. It's good to take into account what is happening in the mobile sector so as not to lose sight of relative opportunities for these companies to see growth. The sector tends to get viewed as competition between VZ, T, S, and TMUS to the point that opportunities for them all to benefit from expansion into home cable and TV replacement and expansion into emerging market segments is discounted. The mobile sector remains very healthy."
"Watch out for next quarter earnings as they were relying heavily on merger to go thru,once they miss estimates watch out below,it's been a fun ride up for Legree but it's gonna be miserable going down,as soon as customers realize all their getting is a $10. credit for Netflix compared to free HBO and a $25. discount on DirecTV Now from AT&T they will switch and just take the free Netflix trials to binge,after all HBO is normally $15. month(Game Of Thrones,WestWorld)"
"T-Mobile has retreated from the high 60's to the low end of the range it had established last year. There is significant market concerns over trade wars, rising interest rates, investigation of administration participation in the election meddling, and concerns over growth and price pressure in some segments of the economy. That can create or amplify downward moves in the stock. I still think TMUS will stay within a range between roughly 61 and 67 and that investors who have a tolerance for market upsets that put downward pressure on the stock should accumulate TMUS on these dips. Using conditional trades with stop-loss/profit reaping conditional orders placed afterward makes good sense.I have seen markets where stocks went down to much higher percentages than the recent drops. At this point I don't think that degree of a sell-off is likely. However, as circumstances unfold that opinion may change."
Let's Celebrate the New T-Mobile Success !!!
T-Mobile US reached an all time high at 131.43
"The prospects that DISH will acquire Boost Mobile and some of Sprint's 2.5 GHz spectrum is gaining support as details have come out of the financing has been arranged for at least a $6 billion purchase price. The deal isn't done until the fat lady sings - but she appears to be warming up her vocal cords off stage.Why will the DoJ approve the merger if the DISH deal is included?The merger has faced opposition as reducing the competition. The DoJ and economists measure the market concentration to determine how competitive they are likely to be and evolve. The spinning out of Boost's 8 million MVNO subscribers statistically reduces NewTM's marketshare. The enabling of DISH to enter the market more increases the firm's chance of making use of their own spectra to build networks. That reinforces NewTM's argument that the merger will significantly increase capacity while extending coverage to rural and other areas. The basic equation that determines the pricing in a market is supply vs. (divided by) demand. If supply outstrips demand and there are enough competitors engaged in the market, prices tend to move lower, towards a 'market-determined return on investment' level. The DoJ will likely approve the deal if it becomes finalized. The AG's lawsuit was dead in the water as far as my opinion goes, but it will be certainly dead if this goes forward.If the fat lady sings this song then the result will be a NewTM with DISH starting into operation as a nationwide MVNO operator that starts to roll out its own network, probably on a low-hanging fruit opportunity basis."
"T-Mobile is moving forward with multiple pre-certified types of equipment and site trials of 3.5-3.6 GHz CBRS spectrum. The 3.5 GHz band will help provide 10x10, 20x20, 30x30 and multiple sub-band bonding that can be used for both connections between base stations and end-user devices and routers such as 'Home eNodeB'. The amount of initially available spectrum in the band is greater than the contiguous spectrum that Sprint has available in the 2.5-2.6 GHz LTE Band 41."

"In a few years, Sprint will battle with TMUS to zero..."
"The website cellularmaps com 5g-coverage.shtml shows the current coverage of 5G. Nobody has 5G to a fraction of the degree of the early stage of 4G 'roll out'. 5G is not legitimately rolled out anywhere. The reason why AT&T is selling 4G-Advanced as 5G and Verizon are claiming to have the first deployments of 5G is that they are trying to get out in front of the curve to brainwash the public before New T-Mobile can do a rollout on a scale that earns the name.T-Mobile's CTO, Neville Ray has been straight forward in describing T-Mo's plans. The company has not resorted to over-hyping the plans for 5G mobile and 5G home broadband. That is because T-Mobile is, by far, in the best position to roll out 5G mobile. T-Mobile plans show a 'true rollout' mode of 5G introduction at a time when people can, believe it or not, buy devices they can actually use."

Reversal time - T-Mobile hit a WALL...(not the Trump wall)- CAN'T break out - even with Stock Market record highs.
"TMUS being added to the S&P 500 Index on Monday is huge, and if merger happens then monster bonanza. Just that exposure will automatically and constantly bring in new buyers. Plus, I can only imagine that all the Mutual Funds, ETF's, etc. that track that index, will have to buy serious amounts of shares Monday to meet their objectives, won't they?"
Back to 103 please
In a future that change is inevitable...owning a network of scale is insoluble.
"The New T-Mobile merger with Sprint will be approved IMO. Here's why:1) Sprint is not competitive. S cannot be effective in lowering prices because all competitors know that is a bankrupting marketing strategy they do not have to react to. That was proven by years of giving away service at below Sprint's cost: the result was a loss of 3-4% marketshare, lower sales, and a damaging shift to the wholesale side of the business that does not provide the funding needed to build 5G.2) Sprint has $40 billion in debt and needs an additional $20-$25B to build out 5G in about 130 metro areas. While that would be a big improvement in the current limited 5G coverage plans, it is not nationwide 5G. 3) Without the merger, Sprint will continue to lose marketshare because customers demand better coverage. Coverage is the #1 reason people select a mobile service. Second is quality which also incorporates coverage. #3 is bandwidth. However, since the vast majority of people are satisfied with the bandwidth they currently receive using 4G, building high bandwidth that does not have the coverage or building penetration will not yield a competitive return on investment. 4) Without the merger, Sprint will sink from a level of debt that reduces the attractiveness as an acquisition to a much worse position. Softbank is on the hook for about $12 billion in loans and the $36B invested in Sprint. However, they may call the FCC/DOJ's bluff and let Sprint go bankrupt. That would kick the financial wreck into the courts with the shareholders taking the biggest hit and debt holders have to take pennies on the dollar. Softbank would likely pick up the pieces or carve Sprint up and sell off its service operations, networks, and spectra.5) The best of bad structural choices is for DOJ to allow New T-Mobile to consume dead Sprint before it decays and become unpalatable. 6) If not approved, Sprint will cut jobs as it is forced to restructure its business to a bare-bones wireless utility operation. The loss of jobs critics contend might happen must happen if Sprint is stripped of the opportunity to fix its failed business the only way that is feasible - merge. New T-Mobile has provided price assurances, a continuation of MVNO, roaming and other contracts. the merger DOJ and FCC could require that John Legere/New T-Mobile 'put its contractual obligations (money) where his mouth is' by requiring New T-Mobile to embrace and extend like agreements Sprint has with Altice and COX to any party that can fulfill similar build and roaming obligations.Altice has petitioned the FCC to require New T-Mobile to live up to the Sprint agreement and also to divest some of the combined spectra and put it up for auction. I don't think that makes sense. Instead, the DOJ/FCC should require that a blanket contract structure is put in place. That could include an arbitration clause to iron out differences. What would that look like? That would depend on whether the two largest fiber-cable operators would sign up. Comcast and Charter/Spectrum have an attractive MVNO agreement with Verizon and, thus were not interested in partnering or acquiring Sprint. They could change their minds because New T-Mobile's 5G coverage will threaten to take away share at a much more rapid pace and lower cost than Verizon or AT&T. The cablecos will soon wake up to realize that they must spring into action to compete in wireless broadband while offering competitive out-of-franchise area 5G coverage.The merger is going to be approved. DOJ and FCC should be requiring some tweaks that will assure that the market structure that New T-Mobile insists will be are in fact put in place. Ifs, and buts.. the motivations of business pivot on power and profits."

"So, NY AG Letitia James publicly states to peon that the government shouldn't be picking winners and losers, and then she does exactly that like a token hypocritical politician. She picks a dying Sprint heading for bankruptcy as a winner to compete against the Almighty AT&T, and then picks Dish as a loser to compete. Never trust any elected official that doesn't practice what they preach. NEVER!!!When Bernie Sanders stops flying on private jets, when AOC stops eating cow, when Beto takes his gun confiscation idea to Chicago that already has an assault weapons ban and is still the murder capital of of the USA that just saw an innocent 9 year old executed in broad daylight (ask him why do populated places without the ban not have so many murders), when Kamala stops laughing about smoking weed while she incarcerated all those for doing exactly what she herself did, when Warren stops lying about being an Indian (not to mention her so called cookbook), and about not benefiting at all from her scam, when Diblasio stops saying we all can't have the same guns/ammo that he can have, etc., etc., etc. then maybe we'll believe a word they utter. While they're elected to lead by example, they never themselves live by the law they impose on the peon. Like, while they lied to the peon about the ACA, they passed a law excluding themselves from it. Can you imagine the peon ever voting for these hypocritical individuals?"
earnings report was good how come nothing happens
How will SoftBank effect the stock?
"nobody likes mergers, takeovers at first. will it be approved, can they successfully integrate? when Marriott first acquired Starwood, Marriott stock went in the tank for a month, then when the street saw merger would be successful, Marriott stock went from $80 to $140. expect stort term volatility. It's the way it goes."
"Unless the other carriers step up, TMUS going to the moon. Better priced, consumer focused, network built to scale heavy data use, free benefits (unlimited netflix.youtube, spotify streaming), free data internationally, wifi calling, free wifi on most planes for a period of time with unlimited texting) So many reasons to use them with benefits other carriers do not have or charge for them. CEO is awesome and is so focused on making the customer happy. Long TMUS"
My bet is Comcast makes a bid for TMUS.

"$TMUS + $S will increase competition. THE company will become stronger and will start doing everything it can, to take away clients from $T and $VZ, To do so, they will have to lower the prices and i provide insensitive to acquire new clients. $S alone is powerless.

"Investors and traders who use the program trading algorithms that are available from all the good brokers would have been out of the positions set to be sold until recently. They may have experienced buying followed by selling recently. A buy order would have executed today if the limits were set to buy when a stock moved higher by more than the normal daily volatility. You would be in TMUS, S, DISH now after having been sold out of positions when the merger stocks started dropping. If the market causes the stocks to head down by more than normal daily amount or you set a structural limit such as when the stock breaks through a support level, the algo would get you out of the positions until a new buy order gets you back in. This looks upsetting to some novice investors: out, in, out, in... you thought you were long on these stocks (or short) and yet over the past month you have been on the sidelines. That's right. When the markets or stocks are more volatile than usual there are big losses as well as big gains to be made. The objective is not to prove that you can be right but to buy and sell right according to the statistical odds. If this makes you 60% gain for the 12 month period/year, which it should, you can complain to yourself all the way to the bank."
"Democrats make the US weak. As a result of failure of merging, both Sprint and TMUS will need to waste tons of money to build infra for 5G. While Korea, China, and Japan are organized to share common network infras together. Dems are so incompetent in business"
"5 days left for NY AG Letitia James to start a new (and hopefully the last) New TM merger chapter, and to show the world how all those high ranking Fed. officials, corp. executives, corp attormeys, vast majority of the other State AG's, etc.""without any doubt"" are trying to scam the country with an illegal merger, and to concoct the potion that gets the Judge to rule her way to protect the Almighty Duopoly. Amazes me how this NY AG is hurting my family and me right now, and many others, while frivously wasting precious resources, when the merger is a dream for any AG (and that even before Dish). China/national security alone to me is good reason enough to merge, even if my rates have to go up, much less this whole package which has like trees in a forest that you'd have to be blind not to see.Thing is, on top of cutting the lowest price plan in half (much less an increase), creating jobs (much less new center in NY), building out farther and faster, national security/China, Dish, ending the Duopoly & Cableoploy's reigns, etc, you save 1st responders billions of dollars over the next 10 years which is used for other needed equipment/services that ultimately saves lives. Again, the merger will SAVE LIVES! Meanwhile, instead of using this time/resources on saving/enhancing lives in NY, AG James seems to envision this black, no ... magenta ... phone bill plague that will kill us if she doesn't kill this Fed approved merger or something (not that Verizon's HQ being there has any bearing, no AG has ever before in history done it, and ok if China rules I guess). 5 days left and counting for the start of the greatest and most costly show on Earth, and coutroom is open to the public, and/or press will report daily on the events?If all goes well, how much do 1st responders pay the Duopoly now, I wonder? Will the Duo be forced to match TM's deal, or lose those subs which if they do and they got great service will likely stay on as New TM paying subs. Really genius innovation there don't you think, which to be perfectly clear for these of the most important calls being made, is a merger creation. Only if they merge, can the scale/synergies be realized/shared. Yet, NY AG Letitia James, in 5 days, will at State's expense, put on a show to kill it. And, is really her show now, without FL, TX, MS, CO, AR. Becerra as co-Lead would fold without her, as the others would too. You think say the IL AG has dissected this merger and would go it alone if she had to, verse is just going for a ride with Letitia? How about the HI AG? Would Connors try to kill this merger herself, if no Letitia? Frankly, Hawaii is first if China/N. Korea want to play war games on the homeland, and would think she'd want the best, fastest, most robust, advanced communication tech for her State, doesn't she? I had written once that in Honolulu alone, I think the Duopoly each had like 10 stores, and Sprint had all of 1. Beautiful forest, but how would you know, if you can't see the trees? Perhaps, open your eyes?"
Such a value stock for affordable market cap. Needs to be at least valued at 200b
It looks like market makers are taking this down before earnings.
TMUS reached an all time high at 93.62
I'm New to the game any tips
T-Mobile US is up 4.92% to 124.44
"The spin out of Boost Mobile will have no net detriment to NewTM because 1) Boost is tied to using the NewTM network, and 2) The combined network will improve more rapidly than competitor's network that Boost might consider shifting to or co-using in future years. While nobody knows for certain, the chances are that Boost will find it advantageous to continue to use NewTM for several years beyond their commitments because 1) NewTM will have excess capacity that makes more sense to fill up despite providing MVNO's with attractive wholesale pricing, and 2) Boost will be able to offer unique services including home broadband that Verizon and AT&T will struggle to expand at a higher cost.The spin out of Boost is not at all a game changer in the context of the overall enterprize."
"TMUS 12 month analyst target price = 88 (Zack's) and growth trends remain in place.S trades at a discount to the merger exchange ratio: 39% 88/9.75 = 9,03 (S current price is 6.48)The market is deeply discounting the odds that the merger will clear the AG's court challenge making this a speculative but attractive bet.Meanwhile, Sprint's parent company has been beset with troubles in their WeWork holding as well as Sprint. The SFTBY is down about 1/3 and remains under pressure. Softbank has yet another financially troubled bail out situation to deal with. I had my doubts about WeWork: there are too few barriers to competition and not enough benefits delivered in that space. Optimized office facilities have been around for decades. Uberizing that is not likely IMO.DISH has pulled off its highs but I look for only modest potential gains. Either it needs to move down more to become attractive or there needs to be more visibility on its prospects for executing on the merger... which holds the price down until it moves forward.While SFTBY can benefit from a resolution of the trade war with China, the other stocks will only do so as an environmental impact on the broader markets."
"Sprint pleads of we will go out business means nothing, when you sign an agreement that you can use another network if they don't have coverage. How does Sprint lose in the merger breakup? They only gain an entire network availability.Tmus signed a stupid meger agreement and now everyone sees why."
"Gonçalo LOL,LOL,LOL NEVER EVER invest in a Foreign Company like TMUS with a hidden EU foreign agenda and For sure NEVER EVER do any Business with T Mobile because it's a Foreign Company with a Foreign agenda that's not in the best interest of America"

TMUS is up 6.26% to 78.97
"Considering Sprint being absorbed into Tmobile, and many people probably just making switch to Tmobile now, instead of buying new phones in a company soon to be phased out, Sprints net adds weren't bad! Nice that TMUS pre released these numbers. This merger will be smooth...just like with Metro PCS!"

"#FactorDaHypeWhy hasn't TMUS risen as some posts suggested? 1) There has been an M&A speculation factor built into the stock in previous months that saw both T-Mobile and Sprint stock move higher before the 'blue sky' open speculation was dissipated by actual news that shows that outright cash buy mergers are not what either the cable companies or DTM's parent Deutsche TK have in the forefront of their thinking. Many investment analysts were working on the assumption that once talks were freed from the gag order imposed by the FCC auction that a feeding frenzy would ensue. That might have happened in the much more expansionary times before the financial melt down and follow the decade-long period of rapid industry expansion and huge debt building needed to acquire spectrum and deploy 3G-4G. The wireless industry has grown to be huge but debt has grown with it and now that industry growth has slowed to low single digits from tens of digits seen several years ago, every inside and outside potential funding party of M&A must look more closely at what are boring details such as what the impact may be to marketing image, retention, financial flexibility and opportunity costs. T-Mobile's fundamental performance has continued to show better than expected results. I have been pro T-Mobile's prospects for several years. I met with Neville and other TM managers at an industry event about five years ago and came away mostly thinking that they had things figured out better and fresher/more from a clean slate, then the other of the top four operators. And years earlier I was calling Verizon and AT&T the 'BORG' operators who had a goal I tagged as ""Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated."" I advocated that the 'junk yard dogs' Sprint and T-Mobile should position themselves as the guys willing to defend the public against the vision of all of their services being bundled by what Legere latter called 'Dumb and Dumber'. That general idea has strung a chord with the public to an unbelievable degree. It has really taken off with younger Americans who, as each generation tends to do, as being outside of the old establishment. It also plucks a chord because habits have drastically changed - people use SmartPhones as their primary device. Many only use laptops or computers if their jobs require it and more companies have shifted to mobile-device centricity. In other words, that market has developed to deliver more of a captive audience for the ""Un-Carrier"" (Un-BORG like) message to be sung and consumers have amplified the message through social media well beyond initial posts, pictures, ads, and store visits. T-Mobile has executed marvelously. Sprint proved to be the brain-dead laggards as always.. or until it was too late. And the BORG operators are too big to go against the mold they themselves depend upon to sustain revenues and push accumulating profits into new ways to blow it up.. or away."
"Being added to the S&P 500 is not what it used to be. This does not have the same impact of 40-20 years ago because a very small share of investments are pegged to the ancient major indexes. These serve more as bookmarks that continue to be used in order to provide continuity. Who invests in the DJIA, S&P 500> Maybe your grandmother."
This quarter seems very similar to Q3 2019 in terms of net adds and postpaid phones. So expect a bump of 150 million to 200 million in service revenues.
"I agree with @Mark, considering getting out of this garbage..."
Sell Short now and enjoy
Beautiful bounce back!
"What happens to the ICT, Internet and Communications Tech, sector if the USA/world economy heads into a recession? The economy has become driven by consumption and a service rather than manufacturing economic engine. The service economy consists of many segments, the most vulnerable tied to discretionary spending. Among those are often found parts that are considered more essential: for example, people must eat somewhere but can scale down their consumption and eat out at less and at lower-cost establishments. Mobile phone service has become an integral part of many jobs and personal use. It can be scaled back by dropping family members, media services, and delaying the purchase of new premium phones and pads. Mobile operators provide tiered packages that range in price. AT&T and Verizon have the market image of being higher priced but traditionally more inclusive - the premium-priced sandwich spread. MNOs have endeavored to put together packages that are 'sticky' - they have parts that are essential to work and personal use that the premium services are upsold. Over the years as the industry matured the distinctions in coverage and services has diminished. Churn rates, the rate that customers have left to competitors, has dropped to under 1% per quarter (except for Sprint which is soon part of nTMUS). The more important figure is the capture ratio between MNO. T-Mobile has led in capturing net subscribers from competitors in recent years while absorbing much of the consumer sector and diversified market segment growth. That historical and structural information changes what is likely to happen if the economy and industry head into a protracted downturn: Past recessions impacted the stocks but not so much the top or bottom lines. Sure the forecasts had to be taken down but compared to other sectors, ICT faired well. Data consumption continued to grow but at a reduced rate, premium devices ditto. The US industry has become more mature since the last big market downturn, the mortgage crisis. That probably means topline sales are more vulnerable to decline. It also means that chinks in the brand image armor of Verizon and AT&T will be more vulnerable. There are a number of related factors that impact enterprise, government as well as the big consumer sector. The impact of a deep recession or any that shake consumer confidence is likely to be more of a long-term positive benefit to New T-Mobile than a deterrent because the zeitgeist of nTMUS is growth through 'more for less' business strategies made workable by having the more efficient network platform."
"Verizon has participated in the case that reached the US Supreme Court regarding whether a warrant is required to obtain data on US citizens cellphone/Hybrid communications. Verizon is the only operator to actively pursue the side opposed, putting them on the same side as public advocacy groups. That is not the kind of thing that is favorable for T-Mobile because it goes against the market image building of standing up to the BORG-like monolithic operators VZ and T and for the customer, ie. the 'Un-Carrier' image. Verizon could use that, when the timing is right, to slam T-Mobile (the marketing image) with a face-slap."
"The Unpopular Sprint, T-Mobile Merger Looks Increasingly DoomedRegulators aren’t sold on the companies’ claims that fewer competitors means more competition and lower prices."
Looks like a perfect cup and handle
DOJ sell off unwarranted.
If they did merge they will be like ATT&VER sit on the money and do very little with 5G. The extra money would go to Bonuses for Sr Exe Management.
Don’t believe naysayers.This merger will INCREASE competition!It WILL fly through the feds.
TMUS up 13% after S deal. Is it still a buy for long term holders? No dividend and most of the upside seems to be built in. T and VZ have great dividends and are both on long term growth paths.

"I don’t see much upside here, I would buy at $100 but I don’t think it’ll get quite that low"
Deutsche-TM should not overpay for Sprint. Sprint's 'market price' is a manipulated price due to massive intervention by Softbank that was aimed at prepping Sprint for sale or other deal that would get iftoff their back.
Fantastic to buy rn

"Merry Christmas, Happy New Year! There has not been much to cheer about for lazy longs or financial managers. Hedge funds and investors who went short on the market are having a good time. The longs who invested in tech stocks and other areas that have gotten hard hit have gotten another reminder of what the textbooks on investing have advised over the decades: have stop-losses in place or manually sell when the market starts selling off. Since the Internet because popular the way people invest should have changed with the times. Nobody should 'trust my hunch' entirely. It has become very easy to set up stop-loss orders that sell if your chosen conditions are met. One form of them is 'trailing stop-loss' orders. These will sell based on where the price has moved rather than a set price. If the stock trend is up, the S-L order 'trails'/follows the order. If the price drops by the parameter you have set, such as by a higher percentage than the normal volatility or a combination of that plus volume or another indicator, then a sell-order is generated. Many brokers now offer simple stop-loss. 'Trading brokers' offer complex algorithms and some have open platforms that allow customers and third parties to create their own trading algorithm scripts that can combine complex rules to determine when to buy or sell.Today's investors are suckers if they are not using some form of protection."

"Zacks Equity ResearchWed, November 4, 2020, 8:45 AM ESTInvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because T-Mobile is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TMUS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 64 cents per share for TMUS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TMUS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +25% heading into earnings season."
Time to pay a dividend $0.15
"Guessing TMUS promise to hold off merger till Oct. is now off the table since trial was moved back to Dec.Once FCC and DOJ issue final approval, in coming days, $TMUS and $S should have legal authority to begin initiating merger.States AGs have no authority to stop merger, they only can sue to seek concessions or remedy and there's no way FCC/DOJ will allow their work to be ignored and disrespected by these incompetent fools..."
"T Mobile has nothing to stop the drop until around $70 when the analyst finally downgrade it to a sell , ZERO Dividend to help stop the drop TIMBER think down and RED , Down and RED and DOWN TMUS goes"
Great day!
"Auction 107 - everyone is waiting for the results of FCC spectrum Auction 107 - which we already know raised over $81B. The question is who secured spectrum and where, and most importantly how much they each paid. Keep in mind this auction is for 5G midband spectrum than cannot be used today and is inferior to TMo's 2.5 spectrum. Since TMo already has deep assets like this that they acquired at a deep discount to market value when they acquired Sprint - then it's so curious why they would be in a stock slide...unless someone knows that they got caught up in the auction excitement and dramatically overpaid for spectrum they don't even need and cannot use for as long as 3 years. Maybe that's why they cannot hold their analyst day until the quiet period ends, and then they can explain the implications of their spectrum bidding mistakes... But even if they wasted billions of $ on spectrum (which would be embarrassing) - they are still way ahead of VZ and T from a competitive 5G perspective - and will continue to be for several years."
$20 soon after merger
Anyone get an increase in their Sprint bill?
Drop the price! Drop the price! Drop the price!
Why the big hit in price today?
VZ tearing yall up lol
"T-Mobile turned in another solid quarter results, slightly beating analysts forecasts... which has magnified implications (not just media hype) because of the continued momentum substantiates the attractiveness of the brand image despite the uncertainty of the merger. Anytime a company as large and complicated as the leaders in the wireless space merge, there is a degree of uncertainty/risk. If the public perception were that the merger was likely to be more disruptive than beneficial, then you would expect that competitors Verizon and AT&T would have seized on that to take subscribers away from T-Mobile (and Sprint).I think the prospects for Sprint's results may not be as bright: Sprint has disclosed that they hold a weak position relative to competitors and may not be able to fully fund a push into 5G. While many subscribers won't be aware of any details, enough may filter through the ether to impact the ability of Sprint to hold onto or grow subscribers ahead of the merger IMO.The theme of New T-Mobile is based on leveraging of T-Mobile as the core network and marketing juggernaut. Therefore, Sprint's results won't matter as much, S will continue to ride on T-Mo's coattails until the merger is approved. If not, watch out, S will drop."

"Can the USA or T-Mobile profit from denouncing China and the rising 5G suppliers including ZTE and Huawei? Only ephemerally. T-Mobile is on a plight to gain approval for their merger with Sprint. They need to gain support among the USA's highly short-sighted and dysfunctional government. Therefore, it is in T-Mobile's interests to make any attempts to dissuade the caliphate-like government agenda to strike out at China and its success. The USA has gone down a path that has resulted in our nation being unable to grow without the further bankrupting of the national debt. So we strike out at China which has targeted growth industries including 4G-5G and beyond wireless.Ho hum. T-Mobile's role;e is not to be the arbiter of national dysfunction. They, like all of us and all companies, must to the best the can with the circumstances at hand. So, Huawei and China are bad, the USA is being stolen from. The problem I have with the the3 situation is that we are not facing up to reality. This is one pucked up but plugging situation. We have to face up that we pucked ourselves royal and must take deliberate steps based on reality, not from the delusional thinking of past, overblown egos."
Any word if Tmobile will be laying off like at Sprint.
"What is the market saying about the prospects for T-Mobile/Deutsche to acquire Sprint? That paying the current multiple for Sprint looks like a losing position. To be fair, the market does not know all the details including what the detailed financial due-diligence and strategic evaluations might reveal. A portion of the value of Sprint is what can be made of the pig: can T-mobile turn the sow into a purse or will Sprint stink up T-Mobile's image and dilute growth prospects to the point that the value of the company declines rather than increases as a result of a merger? There should be a lot of trepidation that DT maintains as they pursue a deal with charming Masa Son. From the outside, Softbank is attempting to unload a perpetual loser that has painted itself into a corner of debt and fierce competition. As I've said many times, the deal has to look SWEET to make sense to DT-TM. The investment bankers will want the deal to happen... that butters their bread man. Make them justify the valuation and then discount it by 30%... and that will be a historically justified valuation. the idiots oversell acquisitions as their modus operandi.If T-Mobile does acquire Sprint at a fair price and terms, it can prove to be of significant long-term benefit to both Sprint and T-Mobile shareholders.. which is mostly Softbank and Deutsche Telekom. Otherwise, this could turn into another boondoggle of the investment banking brainfarts."
Sorry earnings Thursday
Can someone tell me what is happening
Merger is dead in the water as of today. Tmobile was spared a headache
"my opinion is the merger goes through. Tmobile will help create a 4th carrier, through divesture, spectrum sale. Tmobile will take on the challenge and more than likely come out ahead, if it can compete and create paradigm shifts with those two, the tiny fourth will not be an issue. Boost Mobile?. I don't see an issue here. Easy decision on TMUS decision to do it. Those Sprint customers, will more than make up for it. The market will not turn its back on the 'disruptor'."
Tmobile is doing so good they do not need Sprint. I do not seeing this merger getting approved since Tmobile is kicking #$%$

UBS lifts the target price for tmus from $96 to 112...
"TMUS is ramping to new highs over the past few trading days. It remains a buy-accumulate. S has also moved higher but the gap between the current and exchange valuation remains. SFTBY, another stock on the merger playlist, is close to its all-time highs as well. All of these stocks have more room to go if the merger is approved, which is 95% likely IMO."
"T-mobile’s Changemaker’s Challenge shows what an admirable company and its CEO are. Love to see investing in kids, communities, life that can create new ideas to solve problems to positively change the world for many lives/years. Brilliant to allow nationally the kids to form an entry to compete, and let those chosen to be the best have a chance to decrease human suffering. TMUS’ performance is #1, growth potential is #1, customer service ranked #1, CEO is #1, and even #1 in civics. An enormous salute to TMUS, thank you, and keep rolling."

"===11/06/2020==$155 price target===> BofA analyst David Barden raised the price target to $155.00 (up from $130.00) and reiterated a “Buy” rating. “For the second quarter since the Sprint merger, T-Mobile posted results that were better across the board with net adds, service revenue, adj. EBITDA, and churn all better than expected. The company raised 2H20 guidance for adj. EBITDA ($6.5-6.6bn implied for 4Q) which looks conservative relative to the $7bn in 2Q and 3Q,” Barden said in a note to clients."
$76.90 SHORT IT!
Why was this up today?
"Super happy sprint/tmus merger got done before new administration change. Remember under Obama, they refused to let Sprint to merge with tmus."
"The definition of the market structure is the pivotal factor that determines how the US government regulators treat the companies in the wireless sector, including how they have treated the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint over the past few years and how they treat AT&T and Verizon's aspirations to dominate the entire sphere of applications that are enabled under the 5G umbrella. The DoJ has decided to view The Market as being just the consumer market as defined by mobile subscriber numbers. As explained previously, this no longer fits with the convergence that has taken place that pits wired, wireless, media distribution, cloud computing, IoT, security and other markets in competition and used as monopolistically tied products. This has become very apparent in the recent sparing between the Elliott Management and AT&T's CEO, Randall Stephenson: Elliott M. has requested AT&T to divest portions of the business including DTV and media assets in order to improve stock value and pursue market development independently. If these diversified markets were not able to be used to extend and protect AT&T's market position, we would expect management to seriously consider this. The CEO has struck back in defense of AT&T's strategy to assimilate the market segments that can be sold across the common platform and that most people in the industry think are important to the future of 5G. If the diversified market segments that make up much of AT&T's sales are not part of 'The Market' then why has AT&T and Verizon spent a fortune to acquire and grow these segments of business? Why has it become the common gospel for industry management to extol the need to expand into these businesses as a way to protect and extend markets? What in the brain rot are the DoJ and other parts of the US government thinking?"
TMUS reached an all time high at 101.12
does anyone think sprint or tmobile can go bankrupt? I am sure they cant and won't so buy more while the price is low. Listen to Warren Buffett strategy. which is when things looks worst and you can buy this cheap you will make money in no time.

Whats the case for TMUS at this valuation?
"TMUS: Transformative SprintT-Mobile/Deutsche has flaunted the prospect of merging with Sprint because Softbank wanted more than was merited by the value of their US holdings. Sprint has been destined to failure for about 17 years unless it took decisive actions to unleash the 'next generation' of wireless disruptively. Simply put, Sprint failed to pursue the limited alternatives available at the time that would have averted a fate of sliding into decline. That fate is now sealed no matter what Softbank does short of acquiring Comcast or Charter and infusing about $20 billion in additional capital in order to change up the competitive environment.T-Mobile's course of action is 'to keep on keeping on' - to follow the course it is on and further leverage its spectrum and marketing differentiation advantage. The management team leads an efficient operation that has a spectrum leverage and timing advantage as the underdog up and comer."

"It’s time for the United States of American to be great once again like the old days!If we continue to allowed foreign companies to get rich and allowing them to destroy American jobs. Which China has done. We won't be in a recession or the economy being slow. In the first place just my opinion. If this merger gets approve. I can predict a massacre can happen for thousands American jobs from T-Mobile and Spring and started sending jobs overseas. Which T-Mobile has track record lying and paying fines. I am pretty sure no government officials in the United States of American want to take the fall for the layoffs since the economy slow and a recession is occurring around the world and the USA. There's one thing. I just don't understand. Why is J. Legere continuing to lie government officials. That they need Sprint to roll out the 5G. Didn’t he stated, they were going ”leapfrog Verizon and AT&T in 2017”? Now they rolling out home internet service only to selected areas? I don't get this guy. He needs to get his story straight."

TMUS looks to be bottoming on Friday. TMUS should benefit as it is not in one of the high risk categories of stocks + the S deal is coming. Look long and hard on buying now. The unknowns can still impact all stocks like a big virus scare in the US.

"John Legere once said; Sprint is a bunch of spectrum waiting to be utilized. Welp, that utilization gets started in earnest soon...."
Have T-Mobile’s earnings numbers leaked or is the market just that fickle?
Both CEO of T-MOBILE and Sprint got cream pie yesterday by subcommittee. In my opinion it’s very clear that T-Mobile is trying to monopolize the wireless industry and its trying to buy government officials to help them get the approval of the merger. So they can started lay-off American Jobs. Just check out T-Mobile CEO track-record. How he kills American jobs and sends them over seas. This man doesn’t mind paying fines. There’s tons of proof out there people. I just don’t see. How this benefiting the “United States of American” and the people. I strongly believe the FCC and the DOJ should block this merger.

"We have talked about why New T-Mobile (therefore, S until the merge on April 1) are less vulnerable to economic downtrurns as COVID-19. New T-Mobile is 'on a crusade' to deliver higher 5G capacity to more places by using far more combined networks and open spectra using 5G than Verizon and AT&T have available. Howsoever, the 'buy and pray' strategy of lazy investing resulted in S and TMUS taking a hit as the market sold off. They did not go down as much as many stocks but they are not made of Teflon.. the events of the past weeks have stuck to them as well. TMUS was down last week close to 12 month lows, having given up all of the recent gains due to the merger. The bvest strategy was absolutely not to bend over and take one for the gipper. Insiders routinely sell portions of their earned stock options and public investors should have tghe same bloody attitude... or be even more ruthless because they are not also earning paychecks from the companies they hold shares.Anyone who says 'ring and bear it, the pain will eventually be over' is lamo nuts IMO... or they are just doing their jobs working at the companies they are promoting. Can't blame them for that but also don't want to follow their swill."
"NY State AG dropping of the lawsuit appeals is admits the weak position the lawsuit faces. The way that Judge Marrero wrote the ruling was an admonishment of the AG's position: distilled down, it says that the AGs failed to meet the higher order of proof needed for overturning the regulator's decisions. In the discourse of the ruling, Marrero said he ruled based more on total context issues than on the finite economic, technology-network aspects. That is like saying “I am so confident in this decision that I can state it as contextual rather than starting out with point-couter point legal arguments that build up to a split-hair decision. The ruling did not have to split hairs to come to its conclusion that the AG’s case should be ruled against.The ruling covered the legal point-by-point tear down of the case to show that it stands on a solid footing. However, the ruling put that most important justification as if it were secondary to comport of the competitive environment that will ensue rather than details of enforcement. NY State AG probably aired the situation with current or former appellate court judges and experienced lawyers and found that their opinions were uniformly that the appeal would fail with upmost certainty."

So DISH will have full rights"

"Shenandoah Telecommunications, aka Shentel, has revealed that it’s in negotiations with T-Mobile to continue on as an affiliate of T-Mo post-merger. Shentel has been operating as an affiliate of Sprint since 1995 and has more than 1 million wireless customers in states like Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.In a filing with the SEC, Shentel explains that its affiliate agreement gives its 90 days to negotiate with T-Mobile about staying on as an affiliate. If no agreement is reached between the two, then T-Mobile will have 60 days to decide if it wants to purchase the assets of Shentel’s wireless business for 90% of its entire business value.If T-Mobile does not purchase Shentel’s wireless business, then Shentel will have 60 days to buy the legacy T-Mobile network and subscribers in its service area. And finally, if Shentel does not buy those assets, T-Mobile must sell or decommission its legacy network and customers in Shentel’s service area.Neither T-Mobile nor Shentel have given any official indication about the negotiations or what they expect to happen. Analysts at Raymond James speculate that T-Mobile may want to work through the process quickly, while analysts at B. Riley FBR feel that T-Mobile is likely to buy Shentel’s wireless business"

"Most analysts don’t see a good chance that this merger will get regulatory approval. I, in contrary, think that it will pass. Son met Trump in December 2016, in 2017, the previous merger talk began. The talk came to an halt in Nov 2017 because Son wasn’t satisfied of the terms. Now, May 2018, the merger deal finally arrived. Son is a businessman, a successful one. He does not invest efforts and time into something if he doesn’t think that is fruitful. He stated the merger talk after talking to Trump, so there are chances that he got some kind of go-ahead node from the then elect d President."
I'm buying some down here...at least some. Sold my entire Sprint position near the merger peak of $10. Stepping in a little now we're down 20% in just weeks!
"News articles have to be weighed or else they can lead to confusion. The negotiations are occurring behind closed doors with leaks apparently coming out from parties putting together bids or at the investment bankers involved. The news can also lead to confusion because the details can change within hours. Despite that, some news has information worth noting and 'filing away' for consideration as more information filters in. Take this from the recent Reuters article:""But the carriers are currently debating whether to provide the buyer an infrastructure-based mobile virtual network operator deal, which would allow the buyer more control over the wireless plans, including control of the user’s SIM card, one source said.These are details that are important to how competitive DISH might become. NewTM obviously is not selling off Boost or spectrum out of preference but because DoJ demands that more competition is enabled. Whether with the cablecos or DISH, I have thought that would be what DoJ would require from the start. That could help convince the Department of Justice to approve the merger, which has held discussions on how to preserve competition in the wireless industry.""A key element of the DISH deal that improves the odds that the DoJ will approve the merger is that DISH should be able to use Boost to gain a market presence in mobile that they can be expanded to their own facilities-based network. However, the devil is in the details of how much control DISH would have of the user's registration and data. The core authentication and user information are stored in the SIM card. The critical data is registered with the core network and parts of user data are gathered by various applications based on the rights given by users for location and page tracking, etc. The infrastructure-based carriers control the authentication of the device through the SIM and that can lead to a lack of ability for DISH or other MVNO from using that same SIM to authenticate on their own network. There are ways to handle that that basically require switching access from one network to another and keeping tract of the usage across both. Google's wireless service uses both T-Mobile and Sprint's physical networks that way. The article mentions discussions are continuing about ""provide the buyer an infrastructure-based mobile virtual network operator deal"", That probably means an arrangement in which parts of the network DISH build out would fit into the MVNO arrangement similar to the deals Sprint has with Altice in which they build local 5G from their neighborhood/home fiber and cable that their customers can use without using the wider-area Sprint network while Sprint's mobile customers can use Altice's network seamlessly."

Guys I told yesterday that this will go up todayAlthough market conditions were not good$71 coming by 2/13/2019
"T-Mobile and Sprint have turned short-term bullish due to the renewed merger talks reaching a stage where it is likely to move forward toward approval by the BOD and shareholders and final approval by the DOJ and FCC. I think that there is a better than 2/3rds odds that a merger will be consummated so long as the parties agree to the terms sheet, a step that outlines the structure and basic stipulations of the merger. Deutsche/T-Mobile has gotten into a position to demand that the risks of executing a merger be born by all parties, insisting the deal have the structure of being a stock-swap or 'all-stock' transaction. There are several ramifications of such a structure: 1) It locks management teams of both companies to work together for a longer period of time and with a clearer understanding than could be expected from a cash deal. 2) It helps create a new focus for the merged company, one that is forward-looking. An all-stock deal says, ""We darn well better work together because we are all in the same boat. Our personal wealth will strongly benefit, making us tied at the hip to each other.'. It also sends a clearer message to the public, competitors, partners, regulators that there is merit in the merger because there is more solid motivation and forward-leaning structure. The approval by regulators will be likely. I give that 95% odds. However, it will take time and require extensive work with the regulators including hearings. Outside groups will be able to lodge their support or objections. Competitors will weigh in with the FCC, if they wish, on how the FCC should treat the combining of spectrum holdings. Since the cable companies are entering the wireless arena and DISH has told the FCC that they will deploy something, the impact of the merger on competition has diminished. The fact that T-Mobile has become the only competitor that has been able to challenge Verizon and AT&T's market dominance has two sides: the combination of the smaller competitors reduces the number of competitors, which is anti-competitive in nature. However, the story on that can be flipped upside down in light of new parties, the cablecos, and DISH offering up the competition. Although their market impact is tepid, it offers to fulfill the 'fourth leg' to the competitive stool that DOJ and FCC have figured out over the decades is necessary for competitive balance in the wireless space. What does this mean for TMUS stock? It is a long-term bullish event. First, the deal will take several quarters of arduous efforts to be made final. Or course, we are assuming that the deal does move forward through formulation and approval by each company. I think that is very likely because the outlined terms make sense for both sides. Masa Son needs to do a deal that looks reasonable fair to Softbank shareholders and provides a path forward. Fortunately, Masa is a long-term kinda guy who is very down to earth. He miscalculated about how easy and soon Sprint could be 'turned around', however, a share-swap deal that would put him in a position as a part-time strategic maestro, while giving Softbank shareholders long-term upside so long as the merger bares fruit, fits the overall intent of acquiring Sprint. With such a deal, Msa Son would more than 'save face': he would come off as having worked his magic once again even while the grand hopes had not panned out.The deal works for Deutsche as well: T-mobile has grown into an enviable position as part of the parent company. It contributes almost all of DT's growth that adds to the parent company's stock multiple. DT has plenty of reasons not to want to screw that up with an all-cash buy-out of Sprint. The all-stock deal structure helps to reduce the acquisition risks while ensuring a high degree of alignment in goals between the two companies. The theme for the combined company is still ""Us gainst them"". Even though the merged company would have a scale that is about equal in number of subscribers and more than equal in terms of the key asset of spectrum able to be put to use for 5G gigabit class wireless networks, they will certainly try to retain the Zeitgeist of the challenger against the ""BORG Empire"" juggernauts. The theme must be modified: instead of being crafted to the reality of being 'just another among equals', it can shift to 'we can do much more for you (consumers) because we are different - we think of what benefits you not assimilating everything around us in order to shaft you."" OK, even that message is going to be hard to maintain because Verizon and aT&T have gotten into the practice of adopting the strategies of their smaller competitors. However, T-Mobile has a discernably different market image that has a basis in differences in how they put together the service offerings. It is subjectively more friendly to consumers. As mentioned before, T-Mobile has prospects to grow into the enterprise, government, IoT sectors. A merged company would be in a stronger position to compete in those markets. However, these impacts will take time.This looks like the end of the beginning is near."
"The mobile, cable and satellite operators may remain in a sideways trend until clarity emerges on how the converging business and major revenue tributaries will be channeled.The communications sector had reached a level of market saturation while the new streams of revenue from mobile broadband data had reached a stage of maturity. It should not be surprising that the smartphone environment that had become the prime driver of the overall market had generated creativity in OTT, Over-the-Top, applications. That has helped to create new and reinvigorated categories of business surrounding devices: Facebook, YouTube, NetFlix, Twitter, and several content and communications sharing applications have seen much innovation and proliferation. That has stimulated video and other content traffic that has mainly been captured by mobile and cable operators through sale of broadband capacity. The mobile payments and other transaction applications that are facilitated by mobile devices and connectivity are as yet small contributors to mainstream mobile revenues. There is no reason to expect that per-subscriber revenues can fuel growth. The tolerance for increasing of prices should be controlled by market forces. However, mobile operators have the opportunity to exploit the efficiency and lower bit cost of 4G-5G+ wireless using fatter spectrum pipes to capture/assimilate formerly 'fixed' broadband delivery. That may not cause an expansion of overall converged industry revenues but it holds an opportunity for 'wireless broadband everywhere' companies to cannibalize their competitors business within ICT.The mobile sector may continue to move more sideways than higher. What can change that is if the perceived risk of price competition abates or is overcome by rapid winning of cable replacement renvue. Otherwise, this industry may not develop new catalysts for growth and multiple expansion until 2020-21 time frame. Of course, any long-range outlook must reflect the emerging circumstances."

"TMUS should spin off Sprint, T can spin off DirecTV and VZ can spin off Yahoo! - everyone wins."

"Do higher than 4G bandwidth matter? Not to most people and applications. Currently the cable access and wireless networks far exceed the typical end-to-end bandwidth availability and is not what determines the latency critical to real-time video communications. There is a gap between what these networks are shown as delivering based on network surveys and consumer apps such as Speedtest: The raw bandwidth these measurements show often greatly exceeds what is needed for video chat, movie/TV viewing etc. However, the end-to-end bandwidth of many applications and content servers limits the user experience. For example, we have Internet service through Charter in a location that serves university and other high speed users. Speedtest and other apps typically show bandwidth of 150-180 Mbps. However, connections to popular services often show much lower bandwidth is achieved, often 1/10th the theoretical rate. Mobile connections are similar"" While operators tout rates in excess of 50 Mbps, connections to apps teeters at much lower rates. That can be due to local network congestion or limitations at the media content servers or any link in the end-to-end router pathway.T-Mobile is the most honest about this... while they sometimes get caught up in the 'hype cycle', most communications, particular that of the CTO, are based on reasonable measures. T-Mobile does report peak rates that will not be delivered until the peak rates become the median rates.So what? The reputation of MNOs eventually depends on delivering on promises. Competitors are touting vaporware type 5G rates - rates that are available on unloaded networks that have limited coverage."
"TMUS is beyond oversold, this is the Best Stock in the Telecom Sector, price target $89."
"I'm not that optimistic for a couple of reasons. 1) it takes time to merge two companies and reduce costs. 2) just about everyone in the USA has a phone and phone plan, so TM would have to take customers away from Verizon an T to gain more subscribers. 3) Verizon and T pay nice dividends, TM pays 0. If I'm going to buy a company stock that pays zero dividends, then it better be a darn good growth company. TM is not a growth or hi-tech stock. No thanks, I'll pass on this. GLTA"

"One way to appreciate how valuable it is to have a mix of low and mid-band spectra to build out 5G is by what US operators have been willing to pay for it. Operators paid $41 billion for the AWS-3, FCC Auction #97 which comprised about 65 MHz in the 1700-2100 bands. This is considered choice wideband spectra because it is in a sweet spot between wide coverage of lower bands and the high bandwidth of the mmWave bands. Signals travel decently far and beamforming works and interference mitigation works better than the low-band. The various auction and private acquisitions in the low band rank at a similar price tag. The low-band provides very wide coverage and excellent building penetration that results in the ease and low cost of deployments.In comparison, the ongoing mmWave licenses cover much wider bands but are expected to bring in much lower combined revenue. The frequencies about 6 GHz are difficult to work with and costly to deploy. The range is very limited, requiring higher power which is a problem for battery operated devices. New T-Mobile will have the best spectra portfolio among US operators. The value using price-paid or revenue assessment is lower than portfolios held by Verizon and AT&T but that will quickly change: the price New T-Mobile paid was low. As they put it to use the assessment value of the spectra will increase dramatically. I think it may be 2-3 times the value of competitors portfolios but that will take several few years to prove out."
"With AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) quarterly results now in, Sprint remains the only stock left to report.VZ and T results confirm that 1) The mobile communications sector is not being crushed by extreme of competition. 2) That the two top dogs are not seeing a rapid drop in their competitive positions despite all operators networks becoming closer in performance and aggressive marketing from the two 'junk yard dogs'. 3) With T-Mobile continuing its growth trend while Verizon grows modestly and A&T holds a relatively stable marketshare position, Sprint (S) looks very unlikely to report a better than expected increase in either post paid or pre-paid subscribers despite offering 1-year free service and lower prices."
"I was wrong. I never thought John would leave at least not this soon. Anyways, Tmo will continue to be run by great people who have John Ledger's vision."
"Simple rules: If you do not know how to trade volatile markets you should have gotten out days ago and be sitting on your cash until things return to 'normal'. The simplest way to reduce market risk is not to be in the markets. Advisors, insiders, companies, media will make money off of investors without risking their own money - they have no real skin in the game and, therefore, cannot be trusted further than you can throw them in times of crisis.If you like to learn and assume the risk, you should be taking advantage of the downturn on both the short and long side. In any case, it is your money and nobody pulls the trigger except you. Do not cry if you have spilt your milk."
"The prospects for the T-Mobile merger remain strong IMO. I find it difficult to fathom the WSJ report that said that meetings had taken place between NewTM and DOJ during which it was expressed that DOJ is concerned about the impact on the competitive structure. The fact that there are career professionals within DOJ Antitrust Division that use the regimen that would find, if 'The Market' T-Mobile+Sprint, Verizon and AT&T are in does not compete with the satellite, DSL and cable broadband and MVNO companies, then is should not be allowed on the grounds it will lead to what is already an over-concentrated mobile market sector. However, the industry expectations have increasingly become backed up by hard data that shows increased overlap in markets: wireless is offering a new choice for broadband, particularly in rural markets where choices are slim to none, and cable companies have become the second fastest gainers of mobile subscribers, behind only T-Mobile.The opposition was expected. What wasn't so expected is that their arguments appear contradicted by recent trends and compromised by their own competitive positions. DISH, the Communications Workers of America, a surrogate for AT&T and Verizon, the WISPs that find themselves outgunned and overpriced by the entry of mainstream wireless in rural and suburban markets, and the many 'consumer' groups that are usually headed by pointy-headed lawyers who know far too little about the impacts of how companies compete using the Bits and Hertz of wireless. The DOJ and FCC sometimes act out of political pressure, such as allowing the structure to have grown so out of whack that it now serves as a wall against a more open competitive structure that NewTM should be allowed to be a part."
buy At&t.much more opportunity.also pays dividend.

stagnant for two weeks. calm before the storm. not necessarily saying it's going to shoot up but we're due for some movement. waiting to see earnings?
"TMUS is not going to go anywhere despite the gimmicks. They have no long term sustainable plan and no dividend to attract customers besides the leeching off customers. ATT will have the content and the distribution, bundle plays like NFL Ticket and HBO along with box office hits like Wonderwoman, IT etc. Not to mention the new untapped ad revenues that they can literraly cherry pick and charge their fees with their existing consumer data. You can park your money in it and pocket 5% /year regardless if the stock trails the indexes. TMUS on the other hand will have to continue its dog and pony shows to keep people interested in its gameplan long enough to hopefully exit the market gracefully like it tried so hard to do with the broken merger deal with ATT(Sprint is the current one no one wants.... TMO is next)"
Bullish Flag/Pennant formation on chart? Kinda looks like it to me....
Sprint was smart in nixing the deal!
Check out NEXCF. Uplisting to NASDAQ next week.
Wow it looks like T-Mobile is going big with the coming c band auction. They just issued more debt in addition to the 4 Billions in September. It looks like they will have 20 billions in cash vs debt maturity within one year of 4 billions.
"Looks like my order for more at $120 ain't gonna happen. That's okay, I prefer that green close! "
Why is this going up today?
should go up 2% tomorrow is my guess. thoughts?
"T-Mobile bought Sprint synergy news. AT&T (NYSE:T) is scheduled to announce Q1 earnings results on Thursday, April 22nd, before market open.The consensus EPS Estimate is $0.78 (-7.1% Y/Y) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $42.69B (-0.2% Y/Y).Analyst expects mobility net adds of 3.47M; FCF of $4.96B."
"It looks like there is no predominant leader in any ICT industry stock. The satellite, cable, and mobile network operators have been trending more sideways than up or down. Several of the stocks have been 'consolidating past gains' or otherwise show little upward momentum.The broad stock market had pushed higher last year in anticipation of big tax cuts. That is now baked into the cake even though it will impact earnings going forward. What will it take for the telecommunications sector stocks, particularly the MNOs to move higher? Higher sales and earnings could do it of course. However, the entire field is not growing by enough to be a short-term influence. T-Mobile has been taking share away from competitors but it may be months before the roll-up of sales and earnings lifts the stock price to a higher level.I think this mood of the market toward the mobile stocks is partly due to being undecided about how the convergence of fiber-cable, satellite and mobile will take place - whether it means a bloody price-cutting competition or for some companies to steal share away from others to a degree they see higher growth. Financial analysts have not done such a great job in predicting what would happen: as a group, they went overboard on speculation of M&As only to see that fizzle. There does not seem to be a consensus of who will come out as the winners and losers going forward - will cable companies prove to be resilient in the face of the 5G 'broadband everywhere' threat or will mobile companies decimate them as customers drop wired service? While there is much happening in technology and network deployments, the surface layer of the event horizon looks unsettlingly calm... flattish sales, flattish subscribers, flattish profits... rather than '5G broadband revolution' or 'merger mania'."

"Verizon, as mentioned last week, is pushing their rollout of 5G fixed wireless broadband service in a few select cities. This is of critical importance to VZ as the company has built their brand image on being first and best in delivering new technology.However, Verizon's brand image has been built on 'can you hear me now' mobile service across the widest coverage in the US. In recent years competitors, most noticeably T-Mobile, have closed the gap and in some places and ways surpassed Verizon's coverage and bandwidth per coverage. That has made the brand image in jeopardy before 5G becomes available. That is, obviously, why Verizon is spending heavily on the 'First in 5G' advertising campaign in preparation of the limited rollout of 5G. Verizon's 5G is limited in two regards: 1) It is not available on any mobile devices or as a mobile service except as WiFi or frequency down-conversion to mobile 3G-4G. 2) The service will only be available in a half-dozen locations to start.Verizon's advertising is purposely misleading: it strongly touts being first with a 5G offering but fails to mention this is only fixed wireless broadband service that is available in a handful of easy deployment locations. It is a cheap shot. However, it is a good move given the company's position which is at a disadvantage to New T-Mobile: if the merger goes through, NewCo will be able to deploy mobile 5G at the time that significant numbers of 5G mobile phones are on the store shelves. N. T-Mo will also be able to offer similar 5G home routers as Verizon but will have use of the 2.6 GHz Band 41 that also works as a mobile band. Verizon has an extensive amount of fiber optic and wireless backhaul that helps in the build of 5G. However, the company lacks the depth of unused low and mid-band frequencies with which to roll out 5G as a nationwide footprint. If the merger is allowed, New T-Mobile will have a 2-4 year window during which they can claim having the 'First true 5G network' while slamming Verizon as making a mockery of the claim. That could fit with T-Mobile's brand image and past attacks on Verizon and AT&T as companies looking to take advantage of their customers: ""Verizon (AT&T) claim to be the first to offer 5G but how stupid do they think you are? T-Mobile is the true leader in 5G because we actually deliver what we say to you, our valued customers."""
Sprint is mortgaged to the hilt and can't hardly give itself away.

"Hang up on Sprint and T-Mobile: Consumer ReportsMarta TelladoPublished 4:45 p.m. ET May 1, 2018 | Updated 6:33 p.m. ET May 1, 2018Here's how this mega-merger could be good or bad for long-time customers. USA TODAYAnti-competitive merger would leave Americans with fewer wireless choices: Opposing viewSprint and T-Mobile executives must be tired this week, having spent the past few days on Twitter and TV advancing the unenviable argument that their proposed merger — which would cut the number of major national wireless carriers from four to three — will somehow increase competition in the telecom industry.Time and again, corporations promise that mergers will bring untold benefits to consumers. But it doesn’t take an advanced degree in economics to understand that when our choices — already so meager that they can be counted on one hand — are further slashed, the results are usually the same: Competition is slackened, innovation is dampened, and prices go up.Increased consumer choice paired with decreasing prices is what a competitive market looks like. We’ve seen how competition serves us and our economy in the wireless arena: Prices have indeed dropped in recent years, and when T-Mobile introduced its unlimited plan, AT&T and Verizon were forced to roll out rival options. Remove a competitor from the field, and the incentive of the remaining three to compete on plans, price and quality shrinks in turn. It’s not just basic economics. It’s basic history, too.OUR VIEW:Let T-Mobile and Sprint link upIt’s crucial that the wireless market remain competitive. Having access to affordable, reliable service is no longer a luxury, nor should it ever be a privilege. Consumers depend on it for far more than calls and texts. They use their phones for business, school, in case of emergencies and for everyday activities such as directions and shopping. Moreover, many low-income households are “smartphone-only” Internet users due to the high cost of broadband.Regulators have been rightly skeptical of mergers like these in the past. Only seven years ago, they blocked AT&T’s bid for T-Mobile.This merger would fail consumers for the same reasons, and we hope that regulators remain logically skeptical of any deal that leaves Americans with fewer choices for wireless service.Marta Tellado is president & CEO of Consumer Reports.If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.What do you think of the opposing view on the merger? What do you think of the opposing view on the merger?Strongly agree 45.48% (1,725 votes) Agree 16.77% (636 votes) Don't know 8.01% (304 votes) Disagree 12.63% (479 votes) Strongly disagree 17.11% (649 votes)"
you are a serious flip flopper...
It took few weeks to rise about 2%. It took 1 day to fall back 3%. What a joke
TMUS doesn’t need the merger other than adding some reasonably priced spectrum since Sprint is such a mess and won’t demand a hearty premium. I took advantage of this temporary pullback to enter the stock for the first time in a couple years.
I just sold all my shares..the stock will go down as soon as T-Mobile starts renegotiating the price per share
"If this falls apart with sprint, we are doomed. Sprint has a lot of spectrum we need and they are in motion for a big turn-around to the North."
Who can see $150 by end of the year???
All aboard? Shorts.... better jump on this as each day it will only GO HIGHER!
"===01/06/2021 price target $154 ===> Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Brett Feldman maintained a Buy rating on T Mobile US on Wednesday, setting a price target of $154, which is approximately 17.08% above the present share price of $131.53.Feldman expects T Mobile US to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.01 for the first quarter of 2021."
"just remember any move higher in TMUS is now only a chance to sell even more LOL,LOL LOL Buy T before you miss out , T pays a dividend and it going higher"
R....do you have evidence that customer data is not safe using TMUS? Are you spreading false information/allegations about a company to manipulate the stock price? You better check with the SEC before posting stuff like this. It is illegal....
$90 was a piece of cake
Okay.... Time to BREAK THE $123 Barrier.... Heading Higher!
Merger with Sprint is not approvable. TMUS is heading to its 52 week low. Achievable in a month or 2. Good luck!
Once synergies are realized TMUS goes to $150+ easy....

": As everyone knows that Deutsche Telecom is strapped for cash and in recent articles is concerned about rolling out real 5G in Europe. If this MegaMerger goes through they will assume a massive debt load and will not be able to roll out fake 5G in America like they promised. Tmobile will be forced to raise prices just to pay on the interest of their loads. In the mean while Verizon is cash rich they will roll out 5G everywhere. Customers with The new Super Expensive Tmoble with Poor Coverage will bail and go with Verizon. Within just a few years Tmobile will file for Bankruptcy and we will be down to Two Carriers, ATT and Verizon. Can You Afford To Get Wiped Out with this Bad Deal and Having This Big Bad Debt Load On Your Books."
Merge is on !
Would not invest or use T Mobile because it's not an American company and was founded by the EU to collect data on America. The EU and their one world order is not in the best interest of America so at some point they will use that data against America even it they give it to China maybe they already have !
"A group of senators is urging regulators to closely scrutinize the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, arguing that the deal could hurt wireless consumers.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) led a group of six Democrats along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a letter to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), warning of the potential dangers of the $26 billion deal.“As more than three-quarters of American adults now own smartphones, including many who depend on these devices for their primary connection to the internet, an anticompetitive acquisition in the wireless market could result in higher prices for American consumers or force some people to forego their internet connection altogether,” the senators wrote.The letter — addressed to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust — notes how their predecessors had previously warned against the deal, which would reduce the number of national wireless service providers from four to three.Critics say that shrinking the market would reduce competition among major carriers, thereby leading to higher prices and a decline in innovation.Spokespeople for Sprint and T-Mobile did not immediately respond when asked to comment on the letter, but their executives have argued that the merger is necessary in order to compete with Verizon and AT&T when it comes to 5G network development.The senators called those claims into question Monday and asked Delrahim and Pai to scrutinize what effects the deal would have on pricing, network expansion and innovation.“The Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission must carefully consider whether the proposed transaction may lessen competition or harm consumers,” they wrote."

"Amon the 'New Frontiers' that wireless operators can hope to participate to achieve a) a new or increased revenue stream that contributes to the overall revenue while generally using the same 'unified services' mobile network, and b) that fits well with operators network infrastructure, thus leveraging CapEx and expense that must otherwise be made, and c) that fits with the operator's 'modus operandi' for gaining and keeping customers is the SD-WAN, Software-Defined WAN (wide-area network). 1st some clarification: The WAN, wide-area network, has meant somewhat different things when used to define a corporate network vs. when used in context to a mobile operator's network. Corporations use the term WAN to define their computer network environment as extended to branch offices and provided to employees away from office locations using secure VPN connections. Mobile often refers to WWAN, wireless wide-area network, to refer to the geographically distributed network of base stations and servers that make up the mobile network. They both incorporate software that is used to operate and manage the network. This software includes a layer that allows communications between various hardware and groupings to occur harmoniously, keeping track of what is deployed and how well it is working, and help manage how each part of the network functions. There are several aspects to this including security, provisioning, diagnostics, redundancy, etc. that generally applies to both the WWAN and the corporate WAN environments.Over the past 10+ years, the shift to software-defined networks has accelerated. This is helped by the adoption of common sets of standards that apply to mobile, wired, and mobile and captive/corporate or government-owned networks. The result is that it has become easier for mobile operators to offer services that work well with corporate environments and with cloud-services they and others offer. There are two basic approaches that can be taken by mobile operators to sell into the corporate environment: 1) Is to offer cloud services and mobile and data contracts that compete for a share of the overall spend. 2) To offer data and phone services that work with corporate WAN and other providers cloud services in a way that is more like a smorgasbord choice. The second way does not attempt to lock up the corporate business under a prime contract and it does not require the exclusive or primary use of specific services from the mobile operator. Instead, it takes the approach of you can 'bring your own' devices, 3rd party services, equipment, etc. and we will do our best to work within your environment.""Which approach is most appealing to the market? The one that gives the customer the most flexibility to fulfill their needs and to lower overall costs. A mobile operator could have the latest, best-of-breed solution to offer to fulfill parts of the overall requirement. However, if they require a lock-in or a blanket contract for a package of services, they are likely to lose out IMO.Why mention this? Because I see the evolution of network equipment and services as being in-line with the general approach T-Mobile has been taking. It so happens that TMo is one of the small dogs hoping to gain a bigger slice of the corporate and government enterprise pie, which makes the approach make a lot of sense. My reason for pointing it out is because I follow the developments regardless and I want to differentiate between the 'winners and losers' as ICT moves forward."

"Chinese EV company's with massive losses are catching up to us in Market cap! TMUS should be $1,000 per share based on those valuations.

Solid company and investment here."

"The Holiday shopping season may lead to disappointment for mobile sector investors: This holiday season there will be more new devices on store shelves and online than usual. The long-anticipated release of the iPhone 8 will follow new devices from Samsung. The iPhone 8 is expected to be a success. Both Samsung's and Apple's new devices are getting favorable reviews. However, all is not good in tower town:Over the past few years, the marketshare of leaders Samsung and Apple has shrunk to less than half its former glory days: Samsung holds about 24% while Apple holds about 15% according to IDC. Other device analyst reports come in within 5% of the total share of around 38%. The remaining 62% is spread equally among tier 2 suppliers like HTC, Huawei, and OPPO and a large number of mostly Chinese suppliers who make up the 'others' category. What that means is that while the new devices will cause the business to stir more than usual, it impacts a smaller segment of consumers.Another factor is that the iPhone 8 will have a price tag of around $1,000. That is speculated to include extra things like some attachments. However, it appears that Apple has conceded the middle price range shoppers to concentrate on the niche premium segment.In addition to its high-end product line, Samsung is rumored to come out with a new S7+ series that targets a price range between premium and Chinese lower cost devices. That makes sense. However, the Chinese suppliers have been moving upper scale by including former high-end features such as dual cameras, finger print readers, edge-to edge HD screens, more memory and storage, use of titanium, aluminum alloy, and composite materials, and use of the latest scratch and break resistant screen glass. Big product introductions are swimming in a more crowded ocean of devices that look more alike. People are holding on to their phones twice as long as a few years ago. And every national operator and many of the MVNOs and regional operators have similar models. It boils down to the new models from Apple and Samsung having less impact on any individual operator."

"Several T-Mobile executives including John Legere, Mike Sievert, Ray Neville have sold stock over the past two weeks. This may indicate no more than the release of locked up shares pending the approval of the merger. It is something to watch. Until the merger is complete and merged financials and a track record for the new company emerges the cost impacts (pain before gains) financials and performance will have a margin of error and FUD, (fear, uncertainty and doubt).

Going GREEN!!!!! next few minutes!!!!
"T-Mobile (TMUS) has moved up over 2.5 times over the past five years. Sprint (S) has gyrated up and down but has remained in a relatively tight range. The price is almost exactly at the average price of five years ago. If SoftBank had not bailed out Sprint, which I had written beforehand, the Sprint would have headed lower than 2 and possibly to pennies as it headed into insolvency restructuring of debt and equity holdings.I bring this up because many posts here and on Sprint's Yahoo!, Seeking Alpha, and other sites and in investment webzines and blogs have been calling for big moves in these stocks if certain things happened in the merger approval process, earnings results, etc. These things have become intertwined to become New T-Mobile's DNA and even though the genes of one parent impact the other, the fact that the wedding is still pending the court review means that the impacts are in limbo. Besides that, the market bakes in what is common knowledge. The market has come to expect T-Mobile to continue on trend and only rewards or punishes the stock if results deviate to a degree that it alters the trajectory. That means posting on web boards to impact the price is unlikely to do anything to impact the stocks prices, making that a waste of time. The bet on TMUS has been to buy and hold based on the continuance of the established bullish trend, watching to see if the trend continues or pent up buying pressure develops because of fear the merger won't be consummated or the growth trend is upset. These same fear factors impact sprint to a much greater degree as the merger is the only lifeline it has to a growth scenario for shareholders' equity and resolution of debt. If you have more confidence than the market that the merger will meet the court challenge, then Sprint is the higher gain bet.These stocks can’t be played based on things the market already knows such as T-Mobile results or rollout of 5G because that is factored into the forecasts and public expectations. The media hype factor for the merger had moved the stocks up and once both regulators approved, T-Mobile slowly regained lost ground based on improved results while staying discounted to the 12 month analysts’ price targets. Sprint dropped as their performance has continued on the trend, summed up as sucky, and news came out they have been cheating in reporting LifeLine subscribers which distorts how well they said they were doing, the role they played in under-served market segments and may be subject to large fines by the FCC. So, how does anyone play these stock? TMUS - long term buy-accumulate. Sprint the same but knowing that it is more volatile and has some risk of the deal ration being re-calculated if the FCC slams them hard for the cheating. The best way to play stocks is to use technical analysis to determine key support and resistance levels, chart formations, and technical indicators and set program buys and sells accordingly. Since the stocks have been in limbo due to the lawsuit, they are not that great for trading. That is clear by the lower volume, articles, posts, blogs, etc. The stocks have been head-locked by the lawsuit into boring. A way to get a jump on the market is to follow the lawsuit. Once it gets underway there will be legal motions filed and likely reports of the court hearings that may indicate the direction the proceedings are taking. Hours to weeks jump on the market may become possible. Some hedge fund managers and others will be looking at this... I don’t know if I will share it here because why do that? This insight will be valuable and too timely to share."

T-Mobile also enjoyed fortuitous circumstances including benefitting from BORG AT&T's misbegotten attempt to acquire the company (doing what monopolists like to do), and then acquiring MetroPCS at a juncture at which it fit well with TMo as the way forward. However, if John Legere leaves to head up WeWork I will enjoy watching his efforts to turn that pickle into a master chief’s sandwich. He would be missed greatly. But TMo should be able to move on... put his picture on the wall behind the press conferences, turn around and salute him... them move on to matters of the day."
Pierce thru $90?
Just was ripped off by T-Mobile- Bait and switch!- Switching service from Verizon-they told me I-phone 7 was accepted for trade-in discount- When I signed the papers for T-mobile service- I was told the Iphone was not a Plus & could not qualify for the deal/ Not only that!--I am stuck with the early termination fee from Verizon ($364. for 2 phones)Will DROP T Mobile ASAP-They kept me waiting on the phone for half hour at a time- Very POOR Customer service!!!!!
Are we expecting good earnings report tomorrow?
TMUS reached an all time high at 82.56
A hell of a ride
The 7.5-8 ratio is reasonable ... otherwise S will die
Gap up after tonight (Price target 125)
T-Mobile's acquisition of Layer3TV looks like another great move. This is the type of video content platform that T-Mobile needs. It fits the modus operandi of offering 'All-In' services and extended services including OTT over universal broadband services.
I definitely think there will be a pullback to about 72 next week
If T-Mobile is so good then why does my step-daughter always have a connection problem?
The rumor he is selling T-Mobile does not sound rational for a man like masa
You see! I won’t give up on you TMUS.
Buying any dips.....
TMUS is down -4.94% to 61.33
"Credit is cheap and even if apple borrow 300 billions to take over tmus, it translates to about 9 billions in annual interest expense because Apple can borrow with less than 3 percent rate. In addition tmus will generate 2x this amount in free cash flow on 3 years"
Charlie G Updated SCOOP-@TMobile - @sprint execs believe @JusticeATR announcement on controversial $26b merger is imminent could be as early as today so stay tuned interesting to note @JohnLegere and @marceloclaure spent the weekend and into Monday in DC story developing $TMUS $S
Insightful analysis Teamrep. TMUS will be higher next week after strong earnings report.
"This whole concocted mess about Huawei is a delusionary tactic of either befuddled minds or purposeful misdirection.T-Mobile, like all operators, test devices allowed onto their network (as much as is able to be controlled under the brand name that is). All operators want to qualify their devices so they can sell them. We are all of the same basic intent - to sell something to your bosses to get paid for what you offer them. Once you reach Legere's position your boss is the Board of Directors followed in importance by fellow employees, self-worth fulfillment, and somewhere in the mix, investors and ability to borrow to get more jollies doing mind-blowing things with billions of capital and cash flow.The supplier companies are part of the food chain that must meet, within worthwhile commercial objectives, the needs of hundreds of network operators around the world. What does this tell you about T-Mobile? I most respect Verizon and T-Mobile among US wireless companies because they turned around to agree with mine and they have grown on me as making rational decisions about major aspects of technology and execution of the format of their business. The testing of devices using 'robots' goes back to the 1960s with a big boost from the microcomputer revolution. Manufacturers of test instruments that included software-driven computer-based interfaces rigorously tested their own and 3rd party software they used and the components that came under the most abuse, including keyboards and switches. I've walked through the engineerings departments at Fluke, HP, Intel, Honeywell. I've walked products into test labs at Boeing. I've been there, seen that. The modern mobile phone is something like the most advanced electronic gear in the past... it requires rigorous requirements for working with the software and aspects of the man-machine interface. The 'Machine' is the operator's unique 'network of networks' operating platform environment. What the dispute is about is, on the surface, is whether Huawei a 'bad actor' and also whether can use the world-leading company as leverage to gain trade agreement concessions. What the underlying information shows are favorable to T-Mobile: Huawei' communications shows that TMUS developed very tough testing requirements, so tough that vendors, including Huawei, would love to skirt where they must in order to gain approval. T-Mobile's engineering group comes out of an environment that places an emphasis on eliminating problems at their source rather than wait for them to blow up in upstream revenue-generating use. I took mental note of that about six years ago."
"Under 60 again, go Legereguess his cnbc lies didn't go over so well"
"The two streams to growth and their problem:The future of wireless is for it to become the 'universal solvent' for all communications and the most malleable platform for all of ICT, Internet and Communications Technologies. Wireless that can be built to connect ""everything everywhere' through a service platform plays an indispensible and pivotal role in most software, hardware, networks, and application of AI and human intelligence integration. The industry invented 5G to be that universal platform. Let’s call this stream of increased revenue the ‘innovation factor’.The Innovation Factor is not the primary path for NewTM to grow over the next 3-5 years. That is because large opportunities for growth can be gained in existing markets and expanded with better integration and OTT content and services starting immediately. While the 5G opprotunities are exciting, no new applications hold the promise of becoming as large as existing broadband, media, and mobile markets.The first and largest market is for NewTM to go after the cable, DSL, fiber-optic, and mobile market share of the incumbent service providers. Another “Clash of the Titans” episode is about to happen.The clash will be on two fronts that cross: The 5G Home Broadband market comprises fiber, cable, and DSL. Fixed wireless broadband and competitors nascent 5G is a small part of this market. NewTM (and DISH) will offer a lower package price and, hopefully, more innovations in ease of use, OTT and additional features. The second, overlapping market is mainstream wireless service. AT&T and Verizon hold about 68% market share in consumer wireless and much higher in diversified segments. That reigns as the largest target market. It has been difficult to take share away from Verizon and not so easy to gain share from AT&T because customers stay with their providers (less than 1% churn rates). However, a combination of best-of-breed coverage and bandwidth plus ‘more for less’ all inclusive pricing strategy which has proven to be a modest success against the incumbents should take a step up to a higher success rate IMO.When I say ‘modest success against the incumbents’ it is because T-Mobile has taken most of its share from smaller players and absorption of market growth. T-Mobile has not dented the Duopolists market share as much as the common impression. That should change over the next 2-5 years."
Are your Sprint shares all converted to TMUS this morning?? I've moved my position over to TMUS during the Corona Dump.
Well I just order my S20 Ultra...maybe should have waited for bigger discount offers.

DISH is down the most of the merger stocks. I expected it to be more volatile than most tech stocks because it is venturing into unknown waters. TMUS and S are down but not nearly as big of percentages. That does not mean DISH becomes a better long-term accumulation as part of a portfolio. It means the stock may move up by a higher percentage rebound... a 'trading vehicle' stock.
"Sun Trust began coverage of wireless stocks today. Only TMUS PT above current level, which they put at $76. T VZ and S all already within 5% of the PT. It's clear that TMUS is the best one to currently own. I agree with the firms PT's. (Outside of M&A for S)."

tmobiles marketing cannot market 5g without sprints 2.5 ghz. spectrum.
Go T-Mobile !!!
Sievert's next Uncarrier move tomorrow!
Earnings to be reported shortly. Heard lots of good things about this company and they just moved into my neighborhood with their second headquarters. Good luck to all longs!!!
"Verizon is rolling out ""First on 5G"" a service that will use mmWave to deliver cable replacement service. The website shows the price at $50/mn with 3 months free if you sign up now. There is no long-term contract.However, the service will only be available starting October 1st in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento.This is clearly a case of Verizon trying to claim that they are leading in the newest generation of wireless. VZ had more substantial claims when they rolled out LTE in the 700MHz band because they had pushed phone suppliers to deliver devices that would be compatible to their network while LTE was in the early stage of commercial readiness. The 5G deployments that use mmWave rather than mobile spectrum and deliver fixed wireless broadband rather than the mobile version are 5G in name only. Since this works as a separate service rather than an extension/enhancement to mobile service, is available in limited locations and tacks on a $50 bill, it hardly stands as a revolutionary development.T-Mobile plans to deploy 5G using the combination of 600MHz and mid-band spectra as a broad deployment. It remains to be seen what will be the starting point for the rollout slated for next year. However, T-Mo has said it will cover a nationwide footprint and include content.One thing Verizon is doing that goes after the pain point for cable service is offering 'white glove' help for setup and 24-hour call in customer service. The 3-month of free service for signing up now is a big incentive for people to try the service. Customers can keep their cable service, as far as I can see, and get 3 months of free 5G Home to judge whether to ditch out of the cable service."
"The IBD article mentions individual states filing lawsuits to block the merger. As pointed out, the states have no standing outside of their state jurisdiction (duh). And states cannot preempt national laws unless they do so through the courts as a matter of their constitutional right of governance. That means they cannot block the US government's authority to approve a merger of a company that operates in more than one state unless, theoretically, all other states joined the lawsuit. Then it remains a grey area because I don't know of any test of that situation that has reached the Supreme court, the final arbiter. Since T-Mobile has already gained the approval of the majority of states that had raised concerns, that means to block the merger prior to a FED regulatory decision is dead in the water.The individual states can enter lawsuits or join in another after the FED approval. However, they would have to show sufficient cause to overturn that decision. The bar would have been raised to put the shoe on the other foot: from New T-Mobile needing to show conclusively that the merger will result in the better ability to compete on price, the pace of innovations and deployments to the opposition being required to show conclusively that it would not. I believe that New T-Mobile has presented an overwhelming case and that the majority involved at the DOJ and FCC will find so and will approve the merger."
"Utility stocks are a safe haven in times of economic threats. Utility stocks are also among the go-to places to invest when international troubles rile the markets. The US-China trade war is both the 'beginning to an end' of past decades of US dependence on global expansion as the way we consume more than we produce and exhange and a last-ditch effort to somehow redesign our long-term outlook. This gambit is bankrupt and is destined to largely fail... our piggisnesh is not earned. We are exploiters more than free-enterprisers or free thinkers.But even while 'Gone with the Wind' saw a clash of cultures that led to much gnashing of the teeth and loss, the Rhett Butlers saw an opportunity: the utility type stocks will do better than most parts of the economy if the trade war continues or expands. Revenues could be impacted if the USA heads into a recession, a very real possibility. Growth would be impacted. However, the wireless/ICT companies would stand out more than ever as the bastions of innovation, as a way forward and would retain the position in society, come heck or high water, as a 'must have' utility. Most people and no organizations will give up mobile. It has become almost like the air we beathe."
"The opposition to the merger was expected and there is nothing in the various opposition to be unusually alarmed about. This has been discussed since before the regulatory review process started. Opposition from public advocacy groups was as expected as Christmas. The comments by MVNOs, DISH and cable operators may be viewed as sharks circling around the wireless broadband competitors in hopes of carving out pieces of flesh. They do not oppose the deal so much as they seek to have it work to no harm or to their advantage in pursuit of their wireless efforts.Verizon and AT&T have kept mostly quiet. However, they may be doing things behind the scenes as the merger is being reviewed. They may push for a review of New T-Mobile's spectrum and make suggestions that some of it be taken back and licensed to others. What analysts will look for are new details to be unearthed or a new tact pursued. Thus far there is nothing unexpected that has come forward. While expected, the opposition is part of the pros and cons of the merger that regulators will consider. The opposition comment papers are important in that regard."
Yahoo lists yield and ex-dividend date for TMUS. Does TMUS offer a dividend?
"Sometimes we overlook the real improvement. Calendar year 2019, combined EBITDA for tmobile and sprint was 19 billions. 2020, after adjustment fir leased devices, EBITDA was 22 billions."
Get real. Outage is not a sign of reduced profitability or future inability to serve.
"Tmus would be stupid to renegotiate, sprint painted a bad picture for approval , if tmus plays games don’t be surprised if Amazon or Google jumps in and offers more money"
"T-Mobile continues to add subscribers, exceeding competitors by a wide margin.From the PR:""Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2018 Customer Highlights:2.4 million total net additions - best quarter ever1.4 million branded postpaid net additions - best Q4 ever1.0 million branded postpaid phone net additions - best Q4 in 4 yearsLowest ever Q4 branded postpaid phone churn of 0.99%, down 19 basis points year-over-year135,000 branded prepaid net additions79.7 million customers in total at year-end 2018Preliminary Full-Year 2018 Customer Highlights:7.0 million total net additions - accelerated year-over-year4.5 million branded postpaid net additions - best in 3 years3.1 million branded postpaid phone net additions - accelerated year-over-year460,000 branded prepaid net additions""This adds to recent quarter results to put fears to rest that the merger might threaten to change the prospects for T-Mobile's renegade type image, the perception that it will remain an innovator and provide good value .. and other factors that might impact growth in subs.Competitors results and expectations show that Verizon remains T-Mo's toughest competitor, with modest growth while T and S continue to drift marginally lower. The industry figures confirm the slowing of the mainstream mobile market due to industry saturation, device maturity, and the ability of 4G/4G-Advanced to meet the bulk of current market demands."
"The telecommunications sector has among the lowest P/E, P/S ratios among all US stocks. T-Mobile had attracted about twice the multiple of Verizon and AT&T, but the market tends to reward growth disproportionately. Why does the telecom sector attract lower P/E's than many others, particularly among the 'high tech' and service stocks? It is viewed somewhat as a utility service despite being in among the most dynamic and impactful sectors. One reason is that the high growth of past decades will be almost impossible to match going forward. About the only market that is big enough and may happen soon enough to cause mobile operators to grow more rapidly than expected is if wireless obliterates the market for cable and satellite broadband and TV/video services, thus capturing the bulk of the $120B business into the mobile camp. Nobody expects that to happen because the envisioned capacity of 5G will take several years to have that degree of impact and people/households/businesses do not change their habits that quickly.May telecom stocks be rewarded with higher multiples in the future?Multiples expansion tends to occur gradually unless it is impacted by an acceleration of growth or, in the rare case that a company makes and acquisition or change of strategies that 'changes its stripes', ie. it morphs into a new type of company such as changing from a products company into a cloud services company. Amazon, for example, has changed the way it is viewed from an online shop to online services and cloud-connected products and content company. There are few prospects for mobile operators to turn their cloud services business segments into that of a more glorified set of services. Frankly, no mobile operator has been that competitive in apps, cloud services, online payments or banking, etc. to merit premium price status for the stock.What may change, IMO, is that the market's fears that the mobile sector will become price competitive such that margins and profits contract are proven unfounded, thus causing the risk/reward profile to look more attractive. There are already indications that market concerns of severe competition in the sector are misplaced: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint have reported higher margins in recent quarters despite the much reported 'extreme competition' that was expected to follow the breakdown in merger talks between T-Mobile and Sprint. Instead of entering into price competition, Sprint and its competitors have pulled back on the price lever. If that continues to be the case, it stands to reason that multiples will expand.Besides all that, multiples for the sector are now at the low eb of the normal range. Except for forT-Mobile,"

"The headlines read ""Why Sprint Plans to Spend More Than $5 Billion to Bolster Its Network"". What is missing is the obvious fact that Sprint has become incapable of investing to revive its network without further financial help from Softbank. What this probably will amount to is a further taking over of hard assets by Sprint's parent company in exchange for being bailed out from an uncompetitive position. That might seem like a fair proposition. However, from Sprint's standpoint, it is a move made in desperation because the option of growing the way out from under a mountain of debt while remaining competitive in the network has become impossible and the option of being sold for a price that would redeem Softbank's total investment extremely unlikely."
est. earnings 0.883. Actual 0.87and .87 is less than .883
It almost seems TMUS is dragging the merger talks out to get publicity for merger to attract investors. The talk about the merger has driven people to invest on name recognition and possibility of making a profit. Dish is overhyped and made money on the leaks and it appears TMUS is in the same boat.
"===11/11/2020==$143 price target===> Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery raised the firm's price target on T-Mobile to $143 from $124 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following what he called ""an impressive beat and raise quarter"" that left him with higher confidence in the company's multi-year outlook. He expects 5G network leadership to drive 3M-4M in annual postpaid phone net adds and annual service revenue growth of 4%-5%, up from a prior view of 3%-4%, Flannery noted."
"Analyst Walt ‘The Sprint Bear’ Piezyk tweets:""A ruling in favor of the AGs would be “remarkable,” given the arguments that they observed over the two-week trial and because it would effectively reverse the work of 40 DoJ staffers, 54 FCC staffers and the approval of two federal agencies"" $S $TMUS"
If merger doesn't go thru T-MO should immediately raise their prices approx. $5 across the board. Other providers will gladly follow since T-MO is the one who calls the shots. Sincerely a T-MO customer.

"Can the mobile wireless guys create a common message that helps shape consumer acceptance for wireless broadband to replace cable? The wireless operators, particularly, T-Mobile, have differentiated themselves as either being better, more comprehensive (bigger packages), or just being the big kahunas in the space (VZ and T). Does it make sense for them to each craft a marketing message that comes together to say the same thing, namely ""You are being taken advantage of by the cable companies who do not care as much as we do about your business.""? This probably will happen as a matter of course from going after the cable market. However, the marketing/PR departments may start thinking about how they can both keep at the throats of their competitors while, at the same time, send the message that '5G wireless is better and more caring of customers' than cable. That can be done as each operator shifts their marketing from being laser-focused on the mobile space to, for example, showing users at home watching TV/movies or video facetime type use. As 5G gears up so that a home-broadband tier of service can be offered, advertisng wil be able to take direct aim at cable."
"The AG vs NewTM et al pre-trial hearing is taking place in the US District Court, S. District, NYC.I am monitoring a twitter feed of a person in attendance. Thus far, a court date of October 7, 2019, has been set which is estimated to take 2-3 weeks. The case is effectively tabled until after the DoJ renders a decision."
TMUS should have a great quarter....why down so much?
"This is the last thing Sprint and Tmobile wanted to see was a delay in this merger process. They wanted to have all of this done before the mid-year elections so they would not have to deal with a new Democratic House and Senate. S&T knew there was a very little chance of this going through but roll the dice. There are just way to many issues with this merger that this could not just slide by with out being stopped. Once again Son has wasted to much time and resources with this merger mess, when he could have been moving Sprint in a more position direction. He should have kept Dan as CEO, he would have got it done and Sprint would be in a good solid 3rd going for 2nd place."

Great first earnings call by Sievert and team! I like Mike's comments about realizing even more merger synergies than initially thought and the future 5G wireless broadband business once the network is fully deployed. Covid-19 was the only real downer here.This company and stock will be a winner!

Why the price drop today?????
I just got a text (I have sprint) saying that I now have access to a higher level of data due to the merge
Guess tomorrow this will go down and VZ and T will go up
John Legere is more into high tech.I don't know about WeWork but it doesn't seem high tech.
"Verizon is matching T-Mobile's offer on the iPhone8: up to $300 off over 24 months for the trade in of an iPhone 6 or 7 and three months free service for an Apple watch, $10 thereafter. Sprint said it will announce the best deal on Wednesday. I don't think that T-Mobile will follow Sprint in offering a more aggressive price or freebies. Instead, T-mobile will push the 'All-in' feature set that will include the NetFlix on Us' service for family/multiple line plans."
"T-Mobile (TMUS) looks technically short-term oversold. It may be at a point that favors ST trades to the upside. However, there may still be expectations for an M&A that is overblown and the growth trends may not be as good as the past few years. ""May you live in interesting times"" - the current juncture for the ICT industry is for more robust clash between major segment players over combining markets. If any segment is 'in the driver's seat', it is wireless because it has the ability to serve as the most common service for endpoint connections and, if engineered and executed well enough, is the most cost efficient connectivity method. In theory, wireless should beat out wired connectivity, relegating it primarily to a subservient role that supports network interconnect and backhaul/fronthaul to content and Internet servers. However, in the near-term, there are both great opportunities to recast how the network architecture is built and markets are served that can lay waste to any company not able to anticipate changes caused by market shifts and use of technologies. Investors can't assume that because T-Mobile has beaten the odds to grow against entrenched competition that it will gain similar leverage on network and marketing to extend that in the future. I think TM's management 'have their heads screwed on right' and the company has the financial strength and network infrastructure and market momentum to continue for at least a while longer. However, the combining of markets may also cause increased price competition that favors T-Mobile's larger rivals. If the company continues to play its card right, it should continue to hold a 'cost to serve' advantage that allows TM to grow profitably. However, the sleeping giants (BORG Empire) Verizon and AT&T have copy-cated T-Mobile on many aspects of service to the point that gains may not come as easily. At the same time, TMUS must engage in a fresh round of network building that anticipates (or partners with) 5G's competitive requirement to densify networks well beyond current levels. That potentially pivots and advantage to cable+wireless hookups or the larger, higher capitalized rivals."
"RED like the Communist company TMUS is , TMUS can never be trusted to have any ones data in America because of the EU one world order agenda and the collecting of Americans data to use against them .

"T-Mobile and Sprint customers are low income people, these people maybe don't have enough money to buy 5G networks, SO T-Mobile and Sprint sales will decline and no growth,"
Where is infamous Len
Does anyone here know who T-Mobiles largest business customers are?
"The impact of 5G is difficult for many to understand: it requires a new way to build networks - as distributed, virtualized hardware and software layers and slices. The physical structure of networks is becoming distributed and based on the increasingly available spectrum bands that are used in higher numbers on the best available and best-use basis. The number of base stations/cells used is 10x-100x+ greater than the previous macrocell or low-density hetnet architectures. That greatly increases the cost which results in a business scale advantage for the largest firms beyond what they have held in the past. Moreover, the majority of '5G applications' are in segments of the industry that are either already under Duopoly market control by AT&T and Verizon or are prone to be tied up using product package marketing and discriminatory pricing and contract policies. This market distortion is likely to be exacerbated as 5G gains momentum due to the tendency for segments of the markets to favor the scale of providers in the purchasing decision. While T-Mobile has done well in consumer and some gains in enterprise and government sectors, competitive scale barriers are likely to appear that limit long-term gains."
Any one know what is going on with TMUS....NOT many months ago...analysts were screaming. 100 per share....

"If you want growth, hire John Legere. $TMUS is killing it in subscribers growth quarter after quarter. Just imagine how big T-Mobile would be if they have the same network as big as $T."

Without Sprint T Mo not worth over $30.
Probably old customers want it for free too. Cancel NFLX and ask TMUS to pay for it.
THEY SOLD US OUT
TMUS is booming. Late to the party. Buy or not
"There is a new document available on the FCC and other sites: ""Overview of Network Model"" presented by T-Mobile's Neville Ray to the FCC. This presentation was done at the request of the FCC to explain the benefits of the combined network operations.While the information in the document appears to be similar to the details found in past documents, it emphasises the gains in broadband delivered per subscriber: if T-Mobile and Sprnt merge, the network is expected to deliver over 100 Mbps throughput per user to 293 million population coverage. Without the merger, Sprint would be able to supply >100 to out 2/3rds as many people while the coverage inside of buildings would suffer as well. And T-Mobile will be unable to provide >100 Mbps to only half as many people and the drop off could be steep.When combined, the benefits are far greater than 1+1 = 2 because of the ability to use the spectrum more efficiently to achieve a balance of coverage and bandwidth. There are several technical and practical reasons for this. 5G technology can use spectrum on a 'best connected' basis to fit the user's demands. That results in a more cost-effective (capital efficient) use of network resources while providing more frequency channles to deliver the service to each user. In simple terms, it means users would be able to connect more reliably for all of the various applications from calls, messaging, web, watching videos and participating in real-time video and gaming applications. The network model of New T-Mobile would be able to deliver the '5G experience' across about 85% of the USA at a reasonable cost within about five years. And that should put downward pressure on pricing because it will create an increase in supply that economists explain drives down pricing. Putting that is simple terms: if you had the option of subscribing to a mobile service that provides >100 Mbps bandwidth with about 25 Gb/month would you continue to pay for cable? Do you imagine using video messaging"
"How's your 5g coming along along aling not not not without sprints 2.5 ghz. spectrum, hopefully not."

wishing everyone the best of luck with TMUS not only today but in future years.I decided it is time I exit the markey due to age and this uncertain Vitus life period and disturb my cas among family members when they can use it the most.I didn't make a million but have called the shots very well since I bought into sprint and clearwire then merged to TMUS.have a Great day and may your future be filled with $$$
$TMUS........ Want alerts on momentum stocks before the run happens? I have the solution…Google “loinstockalerts” and thank me later.
TMUS $125.28 (-4.07%) at the close today. Brutal...unless you subscribe to the Warren Buffett rule...
Time to roll the dice on some options.
If I were Sprint why spend any money on Cap-Ex. You will get the coverage from T-Mobile. TMUS has now had to start the 4th carrier becuase DOJ and FCC knew they had the leverage.
Latest from Charles Gas. SCOOP: @DOJ announcement on @TMobile @sprint merger could come any day; outline of a deal reached requiring major divestitures; cos exploring potential buyers for assets. Both parties could still walk away more plus latest @CBS - @Viacom now @FoxBusiness $TMUS $S $CBS $VIAB
"Ok all you girlie-men need to chill, and not pee your pants about a price dip, price dips are God sent buying signs, so take advantage of them. I have traded Tmus many times during 2020, and made BIG MONEY. I bought back in @128.69 yesterday."
I can’t believe both parties won’t appeal a weak case
"Great beat on earnings, increase in subs and revenue. 45 cent beat in earnings but yet still tired to move higher. But no tired to go down to $50. See you there soon tmobile."
TMUS looks technically oversold short-mid and long-term buy IMO.
"We should not give the AG lawsuit as much attention as we are giving it. It has almost no chance of success: zero chance of overturning DoJ and only a slight chance that NewTM will give significant further concessions. The AG’s have lost because the merger is pro-competitive: when a merger, company or government action produces more products and services among the same or higher number of competitors. They will spend much more on capacity that will serve the market for several years; that is pro-competitive in textbook fashion. Pro-competitive is another way to view antitrust monopoly formation. If something is pro-competitive near and long-term, it might still violate antitrust laws in particular instances, such as within a particular geography, but is impossible to violate antitrust on the scale."
How low can this stock go?
I would be surprised if Germany alouds this MegaMerger with this going on. https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-tech-firms-hit-by-spy-chips-row/a-45769353
hold TMUS like i said before the stock will reach $100 by next week good luck
Lol look who is back ! Hides when stock is up ! Out on a down day lol
"Mobile wireless broadband expansion is a process - TMobile may not have the best spectrum or network service everywhere nationwide today, but they are still best positioned for growth over the next 24 months vs T & VZ. It’s a safe bet that TMobile stock outperforms both over the next two years."
Sievert is one of the coolest dudes ever at C level.
Do you even trade bruh?
"Nothing, Party Poopers with little interest. Tomorrow will be big!!!!!"
"TMUS $135 target price, 5G will rock and the share will go like rocket"
New AT high.
Please go above $100. I urge you to increase 20%
Accounting Irregularities
Legere will destroy earnings
Happy thanksgiving Canadian God blesses you. Thanks to t-mobile good jobs 
Sell this stupid company.
John Legere will be retiring soon and then this Stock will slide back down to the $40 range.
"This trial is an antitrust case. The judge is only required to examine if this merger is within the law and established guidelines for interpretation of the law regarding competition. The judge is not required to review Sprint's current financial statements or access any future bankruptcy. Current sentiment is that there are just 4 providers. Reducing that number to 3 would be potentially anticompetitive. All resellers (MVNOs) (including Dish) should be considered as full competitors, making the field on the order of 10. Therefore, Tmobile main argument should be the net change in competition is not -1, but 0. The burden of truth will be on the defendant to prove this point."
$126 CLOSE !
"lucky you, Awesome retirement Nest Egg for you."
Anyone catch the action in ERIC today? Is this a good sign for TMUS short term? long term?
"Since 2013 T-Mobile (TMUS) has moved up almost 6 times. 'The trend is your friend' - meaning not to buck the major trends. However, companies must be watched closely for changes in the competitive and financial markets, regulatory environment and structural changes in the industry that may favor one group of companies over another. The mobile industry has matured over the past few years, resulting in low growth of subscribers. However, it is benefitting from convergence of broadband capabilities that shifts data revenue from wired services to mobile. The industry is also expanding as the ubiquitous layer of connectivity for IoT, automotive, medical, emergency services, etc.Not all trends are necessarily advantageous: Recent articles point out the gap between the capex spending of T-Mobile and Sprint and that of the larger broad-based operators. Verizon and AT&T. These operators are more aggressively expanding into cloud services, IoT, medical, automotive, satellite and media services. The question is whether that strategy will result in better overall competitiveness and capital efficiency that leads to further domination that squeezes out the smaller rivals. Or the market could persist as bifurcated between full-service provides and 'lean and mean' smaller operators. In the longer term view much may be determined by how the economy develops and how mergers take place between the cable and mobile industries. Ride the tide but keep eyes open for corrections."
"T-Mobile put out a basic sketch of their plans for 5G that 1) Calls out the leading competitors plans as being chock full of Bullshisa (BS). and 2) Tells at least part of what 5G is and what it is not.There is much confusion about 'what is 5G'. Maybe it is best to ask ""What can we (operators and users) do with 4G"" in each of the rising star wireless segments and in the structure or the network. Then ask 'What can we do with 5G that can't be done or done well enough to create or satisfy markets (customers)? The market does like buzzwords until they ring in their ears enough time and long enough to become a boring drone of noise. Over time markets expect; more, more, more.. according to ""Moore's-Alamouti-Cooper's Law"". John Legere hit the message exactly right ""We will Never Stop"". That is exactly where the industry must be because we are at least ten years from reaching a mud wall on the progress of LTE, long-term evolution of frequency-time-space wireless that is whatever the puck generation you want to call it. T-Mobile has it correct in saying that nobody can deliver 5G by using the technology in just one frequency band. That is only a sub-set application of too little of the technology to have a major impact to consumers nationwide. While an operator can include 'use case' parts of the 5G recipe earlier than the full standard is ready, they are stretching the truth to the limits similar to what was done with pre-LTE that Verizon had deployed. The subterfuge was done by using at least some base stations that were software upgradable to the full standard. However, even then, antenna systems had to be capable. We are seeing some early 5G SmartPhones planned for availability latter this year. Are they 'real-5G'. Qualcomm's new chips going into to them appear to be 'early 5G capable' including being able to handle higher order MIMO and multiple signal channels aggregation and higher bandwidth. However, until the devices are available to be torn down and analyzed, the tech community will not know. Everyone, including T-Mobile, might become guilty of slapping a '5G' label on stuff they sell. Being 5G will require that 5G features are built into the devices, not just by virtue of using the first 5G capable chips."

"Curse democrats to misguide people to think merger is anti-competitive. Technically and strategically, there is no better way than letting Sprint file bankrupcy and let Duopoly of ATT and Verizon reign supreme in the US"
"===12/08/2020==$172 price target===> Bernstein analyst Peter Supino maintained a Buy rating on T Mobile US on Tuesday, setting a price target of $172, which is approximately 29.36% above the present share price of $132.96.Supino expects T Mobile US to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.01 for the fourth quarter of 2020."
Small pp
"TMUS and S are up from lows earlier this year but remain buy-accumulate. The drop to the lower-end of the recent range provides a modest incentive to place buys. That may not be a period low... the stocks have bounced lower recently and may again. The media has little to chew on except the opposition to the merger. They posit Legere's recent statements as if the deal was not likely to be consummated and the opposition posed a legitimate threat. However, these concessions are exactly what was expected... its like a big ""Doh! Who woulda thought this merger would have opposition based on job cuts and the impact on pricing?"" Everyone."
"Guidance for 2021 was a miss, it’ll trend slightly lower for a couple of weeks then head back up... My 1st small buy order is $115 then a few higher ones down to $105 if it goes that low..."
IT is ALL UNRAVELING. The merger debacle of the decade is happening before your eyes. TMUS having to give an enormous amount of concessions for this merger and they cant backout. That CTL backhaul for MVNO rights looks much more attractive that Dish Chtr Altice fiasco.
Is there some industry news that I missed?? $5 drop on nothing??
"A T-Mobile plus Sprint merger had the primary benefit of having a larger marketshare to spread the cost of CapEx and operating expenditures. Those 'cost synergies' equate to higher margins and staying power in the face of changes in the competitive environment as all broadband services come under the umbrella of wireless. T-Mobile has no immediate prospects that would be enabled by access to Sprint's spectrum. Over the first few years of the merger, there would be a need to convert the customer base of devices over to a common base. T-Mobile will face the difficulty of continuing to slug it out for share increases in the mainstream consumer mobile market. Opportunities for growth in the small-mid size company enterprise market look good. That is helped by the ability to secure and use phones independent of a single operator. The prospects for growth is not as easy as grabbing share through a merger. However, T-Mobile is in a good position."
Such a waste lol

Merger is Dead according to WallStreethttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/12/06/traders-are-betting-on-a-deal-breakdown-for-sprint-and-t-mobile.html
The New Tmobile will collapses if this deal goes through. Massive debt and Legere will bail once he gets his MegaBonus. This stock will tank and we will be with just two Telcos ATT and Verizon.
TMUS has moved up to a resistance level that is at a former support trading level. The upward momentum may continue but watch for stalling. What may propel the stock beyond this resistance would be the initiation of the company stock buy-back. That will probably put a floor that prevents much of a pullback from occurring.
They say 5-g is going to cost billions so I bet the merger happens soon with sprint.!
T-Mobile will choke on Sprint just as Sprint choked on Nextel.
Horrible customer service. Buy T instead.
"======>Dow Jones News Mar 3: DJ T-Mobile Lawyers Ask California PUC to Move Up Merger Vote -- Market Talk 17:26 ET - T-Mobile attorneys have asked the California Public Utilities Commission to move up a planned vote on whether the carrier can merge with Sprint, citing the companies' planned April 1 closing date for the deal. It is the only such body that hasn't yet approved the transaction and has said last month it would vote as soon as April 16. ""Delaying beyond April 1 would result in substantial-and ever-increasing-financial harm and risks, and other harms"" to Sprint and T-Mobile, the lawyers say. They add the regulatory body's jurisdiction in weighing in on the merger was limited to wireline assets, not wireless service. It is unclear how much power the California"
Guidance will likely come during Investor day.
There we gooo! Green soon for the day!
So the day has come that the combined companies are reporting as one.Hopefully we see a good jump in the share price and a bright leading light. being a old Sprint holder I myself am looking for a good exit point.

"The two largest diversified operators have held a near-monopoly in the BORG-like industry for ~15 years despite the nipping at their heals by the two junkyard dogs. Americans love to 'root for the underdogs' but the vast majority, over 2/3rds. have continued to consolidate their individual, family corporate and government purchases with Verizon and AT&T. Size matters. Size matters even more for the communications field because of the massive investments and time-to-scale needed to compete. After all, communicating between people and things requires common connections. You can pick a different brand of car, box of cereal or a bottle of shampoo off the shelf and not worry about the invisible connections between them. You can't change mobile service suppliers without considering the impact on friends and family, the company you work at, or impact on your own use of the services and content. Mobile is about connections that are not easily given up. Mobile has a built-in 'constraint of trade' monopoly factor that favors scale.If the US industry had more ways for people to connect using the public spectrum, (the public legally is the owner of US spectrum, not the government which is charged with administering it), then there would not be as much concern about over-concentration of the wireless connectivity marketplace. The US has created a BORG industry and allowing T-Mobile and Sprint to merge will provide them with the scale to compete on a more even playing field. The only thing that makes sense is for DJ and FCC to allow the merger and take steps to ensure competition emerges from outside of the remaining three assimilators."
so why the big drop today on good news?
"Please confirm Victor Marrero is still the Judge hearing the case in Dec? Unless I'm mistaken, Judge Marerro was initially scheduled to hear the case in October, and heard the pretrial hearing on 6/21/19.On 7/31/19, Attorney for AGs sent a letter to Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger, requesting the new Dec. trial date, which evidently was granted.Fargo's Fritzsche noted that the Judge at the hearing, will not be the same Judge at the Dec. trial. Thus, presume Magistrate Judge Lehrburger is not the Judge for the Dec. trial.Now last Thurs., I read that a Judge Timothy J. Kelly of the D.C. district court, has to sign off on the DOJ's agreement. Since that is not a U.S. district court in NY, I presume Judge Kelly is also not the Judge for the Dec. trial either. Thus, appears is still Judge Marrero, but am not 100% sure.."

TMUSR Subscription Rights deadline was today....i put in for all of mine plus oversubscribed for a few more if available.
"With the new 5g network on the move, TMO will compete with cable and streaming companies. TMO TV and a stream device can shift the playing fields. AT&T is having a rough time with in home video. That because they are using old and dated technologies that require Installers. TMO with 5g can just send you the box or streaming device like a Roku. They can even sell them at large retailers like Walmarts and the likes. This mergers is huge in many ways. They are given up a lot of old business to gain a foothold for the new trillion dollar market space, 5G."
the junk is losing customers
Nobody walks. Everybody bound by the laws and previous agreement. NDo the work and stop jabbering on it already.
Tmobile is the better of the sector but even it is overvalued at this point. Needs to go back to proper valuation before it's worth buying. This is ridiculous.

"GasBag moments ago.SOURCES: @TMobile @sprint officials believe DOJ decision could come in next day or two, say wild card in timing remains @dish chairman Charlie Ergen more now @FoxBusiness $TMUS $S"
"An investment in NewTM is a ride on the wild side: The proposition for T-Mobile in the past and New T-Mobile going forward has been to disrupt the status quo that held that the industry was headed towards two behemoths who would grow, by their nature/positions, to drive wireless into a Cash-Cow industry that attracts investment by paying out hefty dividends while putting the screws on consumers. The success of the industry has led it towards corrupting influences of being overly concentrated into the hands of the two largest companies. Yes, there is a structural problem caused by over-concentration. But no, that is not a problem that is offset by keeping the two weaker MNOs from merging. The way to break up the competitive gridlock that is forming is to further incentivize and enable the bottom third of the market to take advantage of the maelstrom they can create by unleashing their combined spectrum and capital resources in a way that forces the competition to be based on price, capacity, pervasive availability and innovation. NewTM plus DISH is the antithesis of locking down the market and resigning of innovation in favor of cashing in on existing markets that AT&T and Verizon, by nature of their positions, represent.I expect that NewTM will defeat the AGs lawsuit in the Feb-March time frame. There will be multiple stages of developments over the next ~seven years as NewTM and DISH strive to take advantage of a disruption caused by lower pricing, higher bandwidths, home broadband replacement, stronger push into diversified markets, and building of momentum of new applications. As discussed many times, the low handing fruit will be going after lower prices to take share away from VZ and T and the home broadband or 'broadband everywhere' market. These two are tied together... lower price points for mainstream wireless and replacement of the need for many customers to keep their home broadband service. As that shapes up, NewTM will be able to roll in more media services on the basic proposition of offering a one-stop-shop that is clearer and easier to sign up, easy to try or drop, far more flexible, and that provides by far a better value. This sounds all too easy... just sell cheap and the market will knock on your door. It is easy in the sense that the ground-up capabilities make it feasible. The NewZTM team are proven capable. But they are idiots like us all who can grow complacent and make mistakes. And the two BORG Empire slugs may not want to roll over and play dead."
Any talk of a dividend for TM?
No big Insider Sales have occurred leading up to this earnings report...good sign for the quarter? I'm thinking so...
"with so many analysts supporting AT&T strictly for its dividend, people on forums upset in the loss of their portfolio value with AT&T but keeping it due to their dividend yield, and analyst reports that if AT&T were to cut their dividend that their stock could drop >20%... imagine if TMUS were to announce dividends. I know they're more focused on reserving FCF to buildout their network, but I'm sure it's crossed their mind in the massive capital inflow in equity if they were to impose a dividend yield with a schedule to increase it over time like AT&T. How awesome would that be to kill two birds with one stone? Expose AT&T for what it is (a massive scheme to hold people's money for its dividend for a soon to be failing network) and bring in new money for a network that will surely become the best and #1 network for 5G in the USA?!?!"

"Where you live, how much and where you travel to, and even what kind of phone you use impact how your carrier performs. For most people, any of the four are probably good enough (which is a point Sprint makes in its marketing). Best means different things to different people, and finding the right fit for you likely involves a bit of trial and error.So with 5G in the near future will it make all that much difference to the average consumer most likely not in my opinion cause from what I have researched 5G is set to run bigger and more important things then your phone not only in the U.S. markets put around the globe...So point being is if it works for you at the right value where you spend over 90% of your life that would be the Best Carrier to go with..By the way all of the above has been parts picked out of major testing reports so you can always read it for yourself.Also I understand 5G will come with a Additional Cost"

"If the merger with Sprint (S) makes it through the gauntlet of regulatory reviews, New T-Mobile will have an unusual degree of flexibility to move customers to different networks like pieces on a chess board. Users do not normally know which network frequency they are connected. So long as the transfer occurs smoothly from one to the next, T-Mobile will have a whole new experience in merging Sprint's network onto its own and, then, re-purposing their combined spectrum to use it as 'greenfield' spectrum. The big difference with what is normally required is that no or very limited situations will arise in which a network must be turned off in a way that users service is disrupted. That would likely make the acquisition of Sprint relatively easy and painless. So much so that those working on it would feel like they are walking on air compared to all the hassles normally encountered."
"How much competition will there be from the new web satellite, CBRS WISPs, and other spectrum bands? Will the combination of these added to MVNO's mobile service result in a new form of hybrid competition? Will the much talked about private/enterprise 5G networks compete with mobile networks for part of the cost of service?NewTM argues that these new players will change the structure of competition going forward. There have been glowing reports of trials of CBRS and Google's support adds much to the credibility. However, Google got behind the use of White Spaces, an effort that has yet to gain meaningful momentum. There was much hype surrounding white spaces and the noise about CBRS may prove to be just more hype. However, the availability of mobile phone devices able to work in the band makes adoption much more practical because users will be able to use their home broadband modems for Internet access and the mobile phones for most of their mobile phone and broadband use, thus providing a way for the costs to be driven lower to compete with the mainstream mobile operators. The mixture of the multiple services will make the analysis difficult. Meanwhile, the two big satellite efforts claim to be redying their global launches of satellite constellations. Bold claims are made to provide broadband Internet and phone service for low prices. OneWeb and SpaceX claim to have service available in 2021 have launched some satellites but the numbers must grow into the several hundred each for the launch of the commercial service. Amazon's 'Blue Origin' has joined the low-earth orbit web satellite fray but has yet to file for spectrum or provide details.There are bold claims being made from each of the satellite efforts. The presentation looks impressive. However, this has been something that has been claimed in the past and the big launches of the 100s of small satellites are yet to happen. The NewTM merger depends on there being more competitive in the field. I've mentioned how expensive it is to build a nationwide mobile broadband service. The new satellite efforts are hyped as a way to cut across national boundaries and deliver low-cost service to under-served populations. If the launches start picking up as claimed, then by next year the outlook for this new competition may firm up.What if the satellite ventures pan out, won't that fulfill the DOJ's requirement for more competition and shift in industry structure? It depends on how the devices work with existing mobile service, what caps are placed on the broadband, the pricing and other factors. The plans have not provided details of the service or new devices. The problem that the DOJ has in accepting satellite as a real competitor is that this was tried and failed in the past and there are no results from these new efforts. Wireless has had several attempted efforts including WiMAX, prior satellite launches, White Paces, and WISP service but none have provided real competition. The DOJ, unfortunately, will be unlikely to look at the recent satellite launch activity as tipping the scale in favor of the merger. That could change in two+ years but not in time to influence the current decision by much."
"Sprint and T-Mobile are foreign companies and shouldn't be allowed to merge, period. Lots of non competitors would buy Sprint. This merger would give them undo advantage with the spectrum portfolio that it includes."
CTL now rumored to be 4th carrier as TMUS would get backhaul for spectrum and towers. CTL going up on news. Seems to be the logical win-win since they have good relationship.

"Small investors should be more active now than ever: when markets are volatile and irrational, small investors who have equipped themselves with the minimal tools and skills to trade stocks effectively have a distinct advantage. This type of market is like 'counting cards' against the casinos (the major markets, ie. NASDAQ, NYSE). Where the index, mutual, and hedge funds often must sell because their clients are withdrawing funds or investors have gotten over their heads in leverage or investments elsewhere that require stock sales to fill, or when business turns on its head to require belt tightening that impact investments, the cool and collected individual investors can take advantage of the market that normally works against them. The tools we are talking about include a basic understanding of chart technical analysis: looking at charts of stocks to see where the support levels are, if there are textbook chart formations such as ‘cup and handle’, base formations, volume indications, candlesticks (usually for the more experienced), pennants and flags, etc. Fortunately, there are several websites including those I’ve mentioned (stockcharts, stockconsultant, tradingview, etc.) that provide technical charts, indicators and general recommendations, The methodology of these sites has to be understood - for instance stockconsultant is a short-term biased analysis. The main tool that gives individuals an advantage is use of program trading or algorithmic (algo) trading. All hedge, mutual funds and professional traders use these. Smaller investors gain the advantage in turbulent times because they can move in and out of markets more easily and they are not being forced to sell. Market downturns should be taken advantage of because ‘shiksa happens’ whether we like it or not and because small investors need every advantage, they can get... the market is normally rigged in the ‘elephants under the tent’ favor."

"Based on the call where they mentioned their new lines were mostly adding to existing plans, I estimate growth in service revenue will slow in Q4.I estimate Q4 service revenues at $14.3 Billion, up from $14.136 Billion in Q3."
So the Melt Down begains
"Today's announcement that T-Mobile has added two LG flagship phones to its lineup sheds more light on the device landscape: There are several nice phones available. All have the basic top-tier features that have been refined from experience of previous models. All have high-resolution screens protected by scratch-resistant surface glass. All have good cameras: although camera and related software remains somewhat of a differentiator, the gap between suppliers has shrunk despite the continued evolution of this feature. What stands out is that phones continue to become commodities. That contributes to why people are holding onto their top-line phones longer than in the past. The influence of new product introductions is there but is not as much of a factor as prior years. Some speculate that this Christmas season will be strong because several new devices will be on the shelves and online stores. However, every US operator will have a comparable line up.What is needed in devices? Phones that are magic: The can't be lost or stolen. The hardware morphs into new upgrades using shape-shifting metal. All software apps work with each other and stay connected seamlessly. The software is so intuitive that it anticipates your needs before you begin to think about what you want. Batteries last for a year without action to recharge them - they are charged by movement or galvanic skin response or some other 'magic' and the devices come to sip power rather than become potential bomb threats. All that is needed for each generation of new phones to have as much impact as during the earlier years of SmartPhones is magic."
"A phone company trading at 47x next year's avg est? After it's already run 20% just in the last few weeks? RSI at 75?? Come on guys, if you're being honest, this thing needs to cool its heels for a while."
"Hey NY and CA....I mean I don't understand this...how could Tmobile surpass ATT? I thought this was going to be an anti-competitive situation, a monopoly of sorts. No competition right?"
"The NASDAQ sold off more than 3% along with other exchanges and indexes. The telecommunications stocks as a group held up better than most sectors. DISH was up a bit - I understand that the companies is profitable but don't understand where it will go from here.TMUS and S's ability to hold steady in stormy market conditions shows that there is not many investors willing to be shaken out and some investors willing to jump in to take the place of the squeamish IMO. I reiterate that both of these stocks are buys: Both have recovered from the sharp extreme oversold condition but have near-term upside left. The stocks are not as much trading buys but remain strong buy-accumulate for long-term investors.Again, what helps take the risk out of the risk/reward ratio is to use protective stop-loss orders, the use of covered call writing, and use of portfolio diversification. Careful use of trailing stop-loss orders combined with covered call writing can significantly enhance investment performance. The reduction of risk exposure can allow buying at times when the market is in the mood to sell stocks. Pros learn not to be scared by the volatile market conditions and to take advantage of them instead. In a good year, one in which there is 'blood in the streets', or in which the market is exceedingly frothy, I have seen pros make 50%+ annual returns... no malarky. Of course, the best traders are better than I am in skills, perseverance, and ability to use the tools of the trade."
T-Mobile is outperform. Next year is much more bigger than this years of 5G future. Good for long term investors staying invested reward is greater.

"T-Mobile/s 'NetFlix On Us' for family plans looks like another offering that is certain to gain popular support. T-Mobile's is positioned to go after the BORG-like 'Resistance is Futile, you (everything) will be assimilated' of Verizon and AT&T with user choice friendly marketing."
Comcast is coming!
"No bad news released on TMUS yet it is down $9ish since last earnings call. All analysts are postive, 5G is the future, all device makers are counting on TMUS to deliver the network for future sales. Apple, Samsung etc all banking on TMUS to get this rolling. Many new devices in development counting on TMUS. That is the opportunity in the next 3 to 5 years, huge money connecting devices to the network on 5G, not just phones. The industry use of the high speed network is endless and yet to be discovered. The kicker here could be a big tech company buying the spectrum, raising the costs up significantly, build out will be very expensive if that is the case. Way too expensive to stay competitive. Ask the Sprint execs that could not handle the heat and got beat at 4G..."
I believe I read a blip on the internet that D. Telephone is having a little financial trouble. They may be more interested in a. bed partner other than Sprint.

"If you don't know which way the market will head, you may have your head on straight. In troubling times for individual stocks or markets, it is fine to admit you don't know what may happen to move them. Even while you may believe the company will make long-term gains on competitors, who is to say that the economic impacts of COVID-19 won't override? Playing the stock market is betting: except it is perfectly fine 'to count the numbers' that would get you thrown out of a Vegas casino. In fact, the more you use tools the better your odds according to consensus of studies. Charts, indicators, cyclical timing, program trading tools have the same basic purpose - rigging the odds in your favor. When you can't figure out which way the market will turn, place bets for a move both ways. Many were expecting the conclusion of the merger to trigger a rise in TMUS, It might have gone up if not for the virus. However, I did not expect that because the expectations had been built up the attention TMUS had attracted during the battle to gain approvals was going to end. TMUS would have to build the New T-Mobile networks and get the cost synergies. The big news was that the stage would be set for gains further down the road as those cost savings came in and the combined networks allowed selling of new services. In the near term, the improvement helps maintain T-Mobile momentum but does not instantly open up that much except for the industrial/IoT, government, enterprise markets that take time to develop.New T-Mobile is the best long-term play in US wireless imo. The early results will say how soon and how far."
T and verizon will die with lousy services... believe me.
"Paid shills on here trying to use Sprint merger costs as detriment to the business here. Give me a break! The spectrum alone was worth the cost they paid for Sprint and they got the whole customer base with it! VZ and ATT are in panic mode with the amount of debt they've had to take on to even attempt to ""catch up"" spectrum wise. They are now using negative hit piece PR tactics now to smear TMUS's dominant image. Good luck with that!"
It's nice once the announcement go out about the Merger Rejection. then everyone can rest easy with their stocks and focus on building their companies and not this distraction.
"===01/06/2021 price target $160 ===> Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan maintained a Buy ratingto T-Mobile US, (NASDAQ: TMUS) with a price target of $160.00."
"How the DoJ has defined The Market in which New T-Mobile operates is faulty: ""The Complaint alleges a national geographic market for retail mobile wireless service."" The excuse is that the consumer wireless market is able to be manipulated by price coordination among a limited number of competitors while producing less innovation and MVNO participation. That in itself is justified. However, the DoJ's definition of The Market conveniently (grossly), ignores the fact that operators build their nationwide service networks to satisfy needs that has engulfed IoT, automotive, medical, first responder/security, enterprise and government, and cloud business segments. These diversified market segments often are the ‘tail that wags the dog’, the pivotal factor that determines consumers choice of their retail consumer wireless provider. ATT and Verizon derive a monopolistic enjoy the underwriting of MNO infrastucture by the combined capital spend enabled by participation in the diversiifed market segments. AT&T has become the world’s largest media company. Media as well as the diverified severvices segments often binds consumer’s decisions in a way that is highly monopolistic. To ignore this is warped, sector-socialist dogma. 1984 Double-think, here we are.Because the DoJ has gone down the path to define the Wireless Market in such a confined, out of touch with the reality of the capital-intensive industry way, the AGs are able to pick up the cockeyed banner and wave it over their heads in the pursuit to block the merger.The Double-Think way of looking at the US wireless market is a pig in a poke ruse that is perpetrated by the government organ that protects (sic) the public from such abuse. It is made possible because the public is largely ignorant and lazy so that the puzzle-palace DoJ can fail their responsibility.Shame on the bloody barstools."

"Thanks for posting the statistics.Phone sales are down for the mobile operators because people are holding onto their phones longer. That is a continuation of past trends but has grown more pronounced. There is hope that newly introduced models will turn over during the Christmas season but I have seen no expectations for a blow-out quarter on phone sales.TMUS has seen higher phone sales because they continue to grow subscribers and they have turned on new LTE-Advanced (5G ready) networks that can provide better coverage and bandwidth if customers buy the new phones equipped to use them. T-Mobile and Verizon come out on top of the heap because they have a favorable subscriber mix and are growing sales and profits without problems of a failed performance of subsidiary units (AT&T/s DTV). They also come out looking good in respect to how their business is likely to roll into 5G. Even though Verizon is pursuing fixed wireless broadband, they are preparing for when mobile devices have 5G capabilities. T-Mobile has the more new spectrum to exploit for 4G-advanced and 5G.Sprint was able to show better than expected results. Even though the scale and the mix of the results look much weaker than VZ and TMUS, S was able to wean itself from past deep discounts without a steep exodus in subscribers. The combination of higher average prices and holding onto net subscribers resulted in better than forecast topline sales.You must read between the lines of Sprint's results to get a clear story - they can sucker in novice investors into thinking there is a broad improvement taking place. The results came in better than expected because sales and earnings have been revised downward in past months because analysts figured that customers who joined Sprint to take advantage of '1/2 off' and other deep-discount promotions would leave at the end of the promotion period. Many subscribers did leave as today's American City Biz Journal article points out. A factor that has impacted the reports of subscriber growth has been the sale of additional subscriptions for data access. Do subscriptions count as new subscribers? Not fully. Sprint has had some success selling bandwidth plans for dongles and laptops because the peaks of network performance are higher than competitors due to the large aggregate channel bandwidth. However, that only works out in metro areas where the 21,000 smallcells and use of massive-MIMO are concentrated. Sprint is rolling out 2.5 GHz to more base stations and will use m-MIMO in more locations, however, the coverage will remain the weak spot of the service profile. It is being filled in by roaming on Verizon and T-Mobile's LTE networks.Thanks for posting the statistics.Phone sales are down for the mobile operators because people are holding onto their phones longer.

Many subscribers did leave as today's American City Biz Journal article points out. A factor that has impacted the reports of subscriber growth has been the sale of additional subscriptions for data access. Do new subscriptions count as new subscribers? No, they should be called what they are. If an operator loads up on multiple subscriptions per subscriber and has double the churn rate of competitors, then they are more at risk of losing those multiple 'subscribers' if the data plans run out of steam and real subscriber loses continue. Competitors are gearing up their own 3X-10X higher bandwidth rollout plans that are aimed at home broadband and mobile service. That will narrow the peak bandwidth advantage near towers in metro areas while making it more widely available due to the greater use of lower frequency bands.I hate to be so repetitive, but it's worth pointing out that Sprint's 'sworn testimony' statements to the regulators paint, I'll be kind, more complete story."
It will hit 83 tomorrowbuy now
T Mo $82 now and if Sprint deal fall out we could see it under $30s easy ;). All eyes on T Mo and Sprint . T Mo over priced by alot should be under $30.
Earnings call May 6th
"Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool movie star, has made a 25% (reported) investment in Mint Mobile, a T-Mobile network MVNO. Some reasons this makes sense to Reynolds: Ryan will serve as a spokesperson similar to his role as an owner of Aviation Gin, (I've tried it and it's good). Ryan has cache with young movie viewers and has established among the stronger celebrity branding positions. He probably has the strongest celebrity brand as the contra-establishment but quirky good guy catalysts. That image fits well into the role that MVNOs can play in the emerging market. It is possible that NTM's modus operandi and market image will be driven towards their newfound position as an equal against Verizon and AT&T while going after growth in the diversified markets. That can conflict with the image as the 'Un-Carrier' as it becomes more difficult to present the company as the underdog. Rather than the underdog, NTM's role should become 'capable innovator' with a cost-conscious part of the market being served by MVNOs. In that regard, T-Mobile should be pleased to have iconic celebrity-branded MVNOs to go after AT&T and VZ. That allows NTM to concentrate on growth and upscale all-inclusive market innovation."

T Mobile porting ratio against other carriers is 1.7 % for the 1st two months of the quarter. This is an improvement from the 3rd quarter.
The spectrum (180 Mhz of 2.5 G) acquired by TMUS by buying Sprint is much better than the C-band currently being auctioned. TMUS shareholders got a bargain and a huge upside...
Great time to buy more! $7 drop unjustified. Should be $140-150 right now.
Poor JohnnyDetroit trying so hard to manipulate TMUS higher and it just keeps going lower and lower . Told you any move higher was only a chance to sell even more and I have told you why. Learn to say OH NO down TMUS goes like the Foreign company it is with it's hidden agenda
U guys think it’s worth buying at 86 or wait
"Just what makes that little old ant, think he'll move that rubber tree plant. Anyone knows an ant can't move a rubber tree plant. But he bought TMUS at $135.54."
"nobody know the true reason why the merger fell off. It could be somebody wanted already wanted to buy T-mobile out and said we want to offer a good price to buy your company, but you have to shake off Sprint. Then TMUS goes to Sprint to offer a ridiculous price. If Sprint is desperate and accepts, TMUS can go back to the potential suitor and say sorry, we decided go ahead with merger with Sprint. If Sprint is cocky and back off, so be it. We wait to be acquired. Of course there is another possibility that the original suitor did not really mean to buy TMUS out but just cheated it into being tough with Sprint and after the merger fell off will not buy it as promised. But that is fine, regardless the T-Mobile brand will continue to attract new customers because so many family member and Friends are already using it."

"Expert traders, hedgers, and institutions tend to dominate short selling of stocks. Retail investors tend not to understand it and treat it as risky or taboo. Treating any investment strategy carte blanche as taboo/forbidden is utter nonsense. The fact that the pros tend to dominate short selling does not mean they are always right... but the history of short selling in general and in Sprint (S) in particular shows that they get the moves in the stock right far more often than the amateur idiots who think they can spend a few hours a month, swoop in and beat the pros at their game. Very few would think Joe Blow off the street could swoop in and beat them at their jobs unless they had similar experience and training. The stock market is too easy. It is designed to make it easy because an entire industry depends on trading to make a living and companies look to the markets to provide liquidity. Everyone benefits from the ship of fools operation called the stock exchanges. Buy or sell a stock, and you contribute to the industry funny money machinery. Lose money? Don't worry, the pros will benefit so that the game balances out between winners and losers. No worth is created in the stock market. Not a single tangible product or service outside of the execution of trades is involved. That is why the market depends on amateurs to invest... they use real, hard earned money, to pay into the system.Blah, blah, blah.The short sellers apparently are concurring that the merger is becoming more likely to be approved:Short Interest (Shares Short) 112,937,300Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover) 7.7Short Percent of Float 18.49 %Short % Increase / Decrease -10 %Short Interest (Shares Short) - Prior 125,745,900"

"Recent articles point out statements from the management of leading HFC companies including Comcast that say that they can beat 5G data speeds using DOCSIS 3.1. However, that totally misses the sweet spot of the 5G market: Cable and DSL (AT&T) providers make live a living hell for their customers: bait-and-switch rate programs that start out as low as $50 basic charge per month but escalate higher until that basic package of VoIP phone plus broadband soars to over $80 with taxes and fees included. Making it worse, is the continued upselling to include TV/movie content. Bandwidth is no longer the problem that consumers are most concerned: they pay multiple bills for home cable broadband and TV, mobile broadband, over the top programming, and get a confusing array of offers for more services. T-Mobile has attacked the 'pain points' as an effective way to drive sales momentum. While consumer ratings of wireless providers had room for improvement, the cable-satellite industry is rated much lower. I call it 'the most hated in the nation' of things people routinely buy.The problem cable faces is that while it provides a broadband pipe into homes and businesses they fail at delivering broadband to devices. That is caused by the way people connect - through wireless WiFi rather than Ethernet. That leads to finger pointing: ""We checked out the service to your home, the signal levels are good. The problem is your WiFi"" is often used. The is a major pain point because the service provider is supposed to be the expert in what they are selling, not the consumer. Its as if a new car dealer said ""So, the wheels fell off... that is the problem of the roads... they have potholes. Take it up with the city."" The big difference between wired fiber or cable and 5G 'broadband everywhere' service is that it is end-to-end. Mobile devices connect to the primary service network. If it connects in the home or office through WiFi, the wide area network backs up the connection. And the mobile service provider can take on the responsibility for the connection by extending the 'all in' service package to include 'T-Mobile experts' who help solve the device setup and in-home service issues. Rather than finger pointing, New T-Mobile plans to extend the 'all in' strategy to the 'always connected' through the one responsible provider. That will result in the cable guys saying ""The bandwidth at the end of this new DOCSIS 3.1 cable is up to 1 Gbps!!! Oh, your WiFi keeps dropping the connection to your smart TV? That's the TV's problem."" Summary: HFC and satellite providers are going to be crushed by 5G. That will particularly be the case if the merger is allowed to go through. The cable guys will try to sell 'we beat wireless in bandwidth' but that is not the pain point. Getting the 10-20 Mbps needed to stream HD video and download files already satisfy the two-thirds of retail market demand. The 'your problem' and bumping up of rates while delivering 'less for more money' is the bane of the cable-satellite industry that allows wireless to kick their buttocks with ease."
"Long live wireless! Wireless is dead!Long live the wireless technology and social transformation revolution! The revolution is dead!The wireless industry has become the BORG Empire. To a large extent, T-Mobile's claim to be the 'un-carrier' is about as meaningful as Ghingus Chan claiming to be the liberator of conquered lands: the peoples and wealth that were put under his boot by virtue of his wielding of superior technology of skilled horsemen and modern weaponry, for its time, saw some immediate benefit from consolidation under a common flag (4G-5G) and more open commerce across vast pan-Asia. However, the long-term proved that out to be a short-lived travesty.Will T-Mobile live up to even part of its promise to be the 'Un-Carrier'? That almost totally remains to be seen. Why can I say that while T-Mobile has done much of what I had hoped for a US BORG industry operator? T-Mo has made every move correctly in acquiring spectrum including having negotiated break-off terms for the merger with AT&T, the outstanding merger with MetroPCS, the acquisition of 700 MHz in various parcels, the acquisition of AWS, and the fantastic acquisition and quick clearing and use of 600 MHz. John Legere joined an already great team to add the out of the BORM Empire image to the endeavor. However, nobody at the control of huge wealth or power can be trusted to do 'the right thing'. And the situation all wireless operators/carriers find themselves is that of sitting on top of monumental power that us underpinned by a monopoly on wireless spectra. These guys are in a Godlike position that should scare the bejesus out of from us mere mortals to the Congressional and regulatory idiots who supposedly know how to run our government for our betterment.Wireless is perhaps the single thing that has the ability to unify humanity and deliver us from self-annihilation. While that may seem way over the top, suggest what else is so enabling... you can't.That means the role John Legere and all the other wonderful guys and gals play is way over their pay grade... because of its way over all of our pay grades. If they want to rape and pillage their positions, they have the power to do that. On the other hand, there are few groups of people on the planet now, or at any time, who hold so much promise in their hands. T-Mobile can become more than the sum of its parts."
The way the stock is moving up today would indicate it's a done deal.Of course I don't have a crystal ball so it's just a guess.
"""What value do you see in opening statements in these circumstances?” Judge Marrero asked one of the attorneys representing T-Mobile."" - WSJJudge Marrero asked the side proceed without opening statements and with a reduced set of witnesses. This fast-track approach bodes well for the defense IMO. If Marrero were to overturn the DoJ And FCC decisions to overrule the merger, he would be more inclined to lean towards admitting more, perhaps dulipicative, testimony and allow more grandstanding of the advosaries. But let's not make more of this than that Mararrero hopes to speed the trial along."

"The news that John Legere has been in talks with WeWork-Softbank about becoming its CEO has not been welcomed by TMUS share holders. It has been rumored for months that Legere might leave NewTM after the merger. T-Mobile's COO, Mike Sievert, is thought to be the likely replacement if Legere were to leave. John has committed to staying around for three years or longer. However, since this is a SoftBank company it opens up the possibility that Legere could depart NewTM on good terms as part of the corporate realignment under the merger.How would that impact New T-Mobile? John Legere was 'the right man at the right time' to help the company (keep) heading in the right direction. However, T-Mobile has, IMO, a deep professional work force including top management. John Legere would be missed but that should not upset the direction or way the company operates. Sievert is very capable... however, I don't think of T-Mobile as being a top-down driven company. The technical team headed by Neville Ray, the financial management team with Braxton Carter, and several other managers fill out a deep group."

"Trump closely watching will trump most mergers especially with phone carriers, not enough competition already, so any speculation regarding anybody being interested in T-Mobile...is just pump and dump hype. It seems to be working today...but the high bidders today may be just realizing it......."
I’m sorry but this company is horrible. We live in Dallas and our phone internet is always down. Always. This is by far the worse phone service we have EVER had in our life. Once apple gets there act together with the 12s (no inventory anywhere) we are leaving immediately.
John Legere is a used car salesman. If this Horrible Mega Deal goes through this will be a great stock to short. All of the Hedge Funds are eyeing this one to Short down to the teens.
"What is the impact of excluding equipment made in China from being used in US networks?The US has no suppliers of 5G wireless equipment or manufacturing of equipment or devices. Huawei and ZTE had been used in less than 5% of the network and that was primarily for equipment outside of the network core that administers network security, user authentication, etc. None of the four nationwide carriers use Huawei equipment and have removed the small amount they once had. A few small WISPs and localized operators continue to use Huawei as last I read about it, however, few see that as a threat to national security. Can America cause the development of a resurgent wireless equipment industry? Throw enough money at it and who knows. However, if the goal is to become a leader in 5G, throwing money at the problem won't fix it and could make things worse in the long run. A major problem is the US is a high-cost country to build electronic equipment of any kind. We have higher labor costs and also higher real estate costs, site permitting, environmental, legal, medical, education, etc. costs. Pig Nation now wants to get back into manufacturing. Development of an equipment industry takes several years of front-end R&D. China and some other countries started decades ago by stressing the core areas of higher education that would be needed. They emphasized the STEM engineering, higher math and science fields and encouraged basic research at their universities, research institutes, and in the private sector companies including ZTE and Huawei. Huawei has about 2-3 times higher proportion of STEM employees than was the case for Motorola, and Nortel (Canada). The company continues to pride itself as having more STEM researches than Intel or Qualcomm. How does the US compete against China for advanced technologies fields?1) Stop denying the validity and importance of the sciences.2) Stop idolizing 'Stars' including star CEOs because they cannot fix things that are fundamentally broken that are issues that first must be taken up as national priorities.3) Reduce the costs of doing business. That includes winding down of sector-socialist market protections in medical and outlandishly inefficient spending on the military. Sunset all spending that is out of date or for which there are better alternatives. T-Mobile cannot fix the problem with the US supply of 5G. It buys equipment primarily from Ericsson and Nokia. (However, much of the stuff is built in China.)4) Let the free enterprise system return to more self-regulation, including letting the economy have downturns that shake out weak players, bogus fields of technologies and wasteful government spending. Can America turn on a 5G equipment industry? No. By the time we could assemble the efforts within the areas of higher education & research institutions, somehow incentivize or subsidize companies to invest in a similar degree of R&D, the gaols will have shifted to 6G. It will take nearly as long as it took China, about ten years, to field a competitor. The goal would be a moving target. Qualcomm could serve as the starting point but Qualcomm stopped making equipment years ago except to prove out their chips and technologies. Making Qualcomm in a Huawei would take combining them with Cisco and other companies and funding them from outside. The additional problem is that the USA has not developed nearly as many experts in the advanced fields of math/physics, RF and digital electrical engineering, etc. We have a skilled labor shortage that has partly been filled by foreigners. Math and Engineering is hard work and boring compared to being TV celebrities and social media moguls. The reforms are too difficult. Maybe we need the economy to collapse before the mass of the population will take it seriously."
"The WSJ headline reads: ""Few Rivals Speak Out Against Sprint, T-Mobile Merger""The opposition that has submitted papers to the regulatory review process (fcc.gov) has shown no surprises:1) The other Big Four mobile operators, VZ and T, have kept pretty much to themselves. They are in a position to not directly oppose the merger because they themselves are pursuing mergers or media, mobile payments, advertising, cloud computing/network services, etc. They are motivated not to oppose the merger directly because that would tend to galvanize the environment against their acquisitions.2) The public advocacy and interest groups including the Consumers Union and Communications Workers of America (CWA) have expectedly come out with opposition papers. These follow the lines of the historical conventions that calculates the mobile industry as distinct from other broadband, wholesale and OTT markets. While the methodology used, including HHI calculations, remains valid, the way these have been applied purposely ignores the transformation of the wireless and wired broadband services industry has undergone: Both wired and wireless are now 'All IP broadband' in their technology and how that gets consumed. Cable broadband connected via wireless WiFi and Bluetooth over 90% of the time. And wireless broadband is predominantly used for broadband data connections. Text messaging far exceeds voice communications and people increasingly use video chat and social applications across both cable and wireless connections. The convergence has already gone too far to treat the market as separate.Once treated as common and significantly overlapped markets, the HHI calculations offered by the CWA, CU, and others are made much less impactful of a consideration.3) The papers by DISH and Altice confirm what I had said over the past 18+ months: The approval of the merger may hinge on providing assurances that the wholesale MVNO and joint 5G network development that either T-Mobile or Sprint has engaged must be strengthened and continued.The merger can withstand the opposition if it provides a clear path forward for robust competition. If John Legere has grown too many cybergenic eyeballs, wireless mind-hive collective thinking, and armaments, the effort to merge with Sprint to take on the promise of full-spectrum application of 5G may be doomed to failure IMO. If, on the other hand, TMo helps arm the cablecos to enter the space while simultaneously increasing its own odds of mid-long term success by partnering in the 1st-mile 5G tier with cablecos, the deal will be approved and Newco will be lead company on the path of revolutionizing the ICT space over the next 20+ years IMO."

"If the merger fails to gain DOJ approval and fails to challenge the block in court, investors can blame John Legere for lack of understanding of what T-Mobile would be up against. If you dig deeper, the blame probably rests on the government relations experts, attorneys, and consultants that T-Mobile hires to guide their strategic moves. If, on the other hand, DOJ succumbs to the pressure to let the ball roll downhill, figuring that its better to let T-mobile and Sprint merge based on the short-term consessions, then John Legere will be the Ghingus Khan of the US wireless space... rape, pillage and let the long-term consequences be dealt with latter.It is easy to claim being the 'Un-Carrier"" when you are the ""Un-Competitor"" that does not let mere sentimentality about being an American and while lying out the teeth about standing up for free enterprise.

Excellent piece on Defending the rationale for the Sprint-T-Mobile merger.
"Buyers spooked... • T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is seeing some quick choppy trading after its Investor Day presentation proceeded to a slide on new financial targets. • The new targets exceed the original merger plan, CEO Mike Sievert says, adding expectations for cumulative free cash flow of about $65B through 2025 - about 20% higher than previously expected. • The company also expects higher service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA, and it's raising midterm free cash flow guidance by about 30% ($3B)."

I don't know why some people here think TMUS giving dividends. From what I understand TMUS has not given the dividends since May 2013 because the investors wanted their shares to be bought back instead.
Someone ask John Legere when the next div raise is?
"TMUS cancels Fox ads in boycott of Tucker Carlson's calling it as it is. Cowardly TMUS CEO caves to the rioters, looters and America haters. Cancel TMUS family plan. Hopefully, the CEO gives away every dime to BLM. Hopefully, stock goes to zero."

If this Monster MegaMerger I can only speculate that Son will be able to comingle his stocks into the new Super Tmobile and then Sons plans will be complete. Since Son has really no real voice in the company he will be able to start reduce his exposer without anyone noticing before the stock start to drop back to the $20. Then he will be able to find something new to invest into. Then Tmoblie shareholders will be stuck with an empty bag as the stock sinks.

"other than buying cheap TMobile shares for now, there is nothing to do here until after the trial in December. Money needs to make money, so it's time to invest elsewhere for now and come back to this gold mine in a few months. stay strong folks, this is the last struggle with the merger before seeing TMUS to go over $100."
"The merger prospects have not changed. The Bloomberg article is a lame reporting of a situation that was, had and will continue to be a part of the situation: that some pointy-head lawyers are opposed to the deal based on primarily prior assumptions about Sprint's competitiveness and survivability and the structure of the wireless/ICT industry that no longer has suffici8ient weight to deter the approval. There will be those within the DOJ and the FCC that have the opinion that the merger is more anti-competitive than pro-competitive and will do more harm than good to consumers and industry structure. However, the majority opinion will win out to approve the deal.There may well, as I have said since before the merger was announced, that the DOJ and FCC may place requirements on the merger in order to gain their approval. There have been multiple concessions made already. Further concessions are possible, IN fact, I am of the opinion that New T-Mobile should be required to extend Sprint's deals with cablecos to a blanket deal that would help springboard New T-Mobile through the use of the hybrid fiber-cable operator's 'first-mile' access networks. Talk about a powerful combination. 'Give to get' as the new top dog in the US industry. This is a buying opportunity. Buy, buy, buy."

"5G is a culmination of advances in many technologies and business developments that have come before it. It is the most dramatic, society-changing development in the history of mankind because it represents the building 'on top of the shoulders of giants' of the previous generations of wired and wireless networks, the Internet, computer and software. No G would have been possible if not for prior 'revolutions' in chips, RF, antennas/antenna systems, networking and virtualization, etc. The chips that made the computer revolution of the 1970-80's possible led to the networking revolution which led to the Internet revolution, which combined to lead to the 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G+ wireless broadband revolution. 5G represents changes in the world that have occurred 'on Internet time', or, more appropriately, on 'wireless Internet Time'. I have had the pleasure of visiting many countries and talking with leading technologists and managers of the chip, device, equipment and network operators and the regulators and standards groups. What is clear has been that the 'wireless revolution' was occurring everywhere at once, not just in the countries hosting the leading chip, device and equipment suppliers. No country has or could have done it all or contained the 'revolution' that has transpired since. The US is something of an adolescent country - amazed by the freedom we have grown up in but unable to fully cope with the responsibility. We screw up more than we admit and that includes and maybe is more so on the big things like xG-5G policies. Nowadays, if we can't win in the marketplace, blame whoever does it better. China is the obvious target.Excelling in wireless was almost inevitable because China lacked wired communications infrastructure while their export-driven economy, that the USA enormously benefitted, demanded more and better means of communications. China's wireless communications would have advanced if the Chinese government had not arranged low-interest loans and if Huawei had never sprung into being. China's 1.4 billion people and the massive export economy would have filled that vacuum regardless. That is free enterprise demand vs. supply at work, the fundamental driver of China's communications 'miracle' that some now find so startling. What is startling is how fat and lazy much of America's industry looks in comparison... ""take the old horse out back and shoot it"". This should be cause for self-reflection and new ideas, not the blame games. Its time to own it and move forward.China will continue to excel at wireless communications because they will continue to far outspend the USA and any allies we might align on graduating the core STEM employees and doing the R&D that has produced competitive products. The USA has zero chance to deploy 5G on a similar scale, zero. China will deploy based on commercial needs, not based on government programs. Anyone who claims otherwise is being foolishly in denial of the facts. That will do more to hinder the USA by diverting decisions from what is needed to the realm of tariff wars and other easy blindfolds. China's recently announced policies and the corresponding plans of the five leading ICT companies leads to the analysis that China will deploy faster and more 5G than anywhere in the world: from FP, ForeignPolicy.com: ""China Mobile says it will invest approximately 17 billion yuan ($2.5 billion), and it expects to have as many as 50,000 base stations deployed by year-end."" What this shows is not so much that there will be a large number of base stations deployed but that the cost of deployment is so lopsided: this works out to about $34,000 per base station. The cost for US operators to install a new base station, not just a new generation at an existing base station, is 5X to 30x higher. The 5X higher is limited to installing of pole-mount and other lower cost smallcell installations. We are one fat and happy country of back slappers... but all the BS will not overcome that and the internal supply advantages China will continue to have regardless of our late-game bench quarterbacking."

"WOW talk about a data breach By the Government to even let a Foreign Company to have so much access to peoples data , Companies data and even Military data, T mobile is not an American company it was founded by the EU's one world order to collect data. FACT. No one in the USA should be using T Mobile unless you and your company you work for don't mind their data being taken. I would bet most did not even know that T Mobile was not an American company. If you are going to Change companies I would not go to VZ either, VZ Gave away the Company to Han's from the EU's one world order and they are now CENSORING what Americans can see and read with their EU run Yahoo NATZI. That only leave T and the government has already moved the first responder system to T."

"You may question why all of the four major US mobile operators are down today. I think is may have something to do with there being a let down among some ANALysts of their expectations for the mobile sector that is tied to T-Mobile's success at developing an alternative to the BORG business track of trying to gain direct control over media revenue streams. Of the four, T-Mobile is down about 0.85% while competitor's stocks are down about twice that. Maybe this is my ego getting carried away.. it is boasting that my understanding of the course of developments has been basically right so that T-mobile is able to build momentum around being the Un-BORB-like or Un-Carrier carrier. By 'carrying' unlimited broadband, multiple phone numbers (DIGITS), and, now the popular NetFlix service at a competitive 'all-in' price, T-Mobile has capitalized on building more efficient networks rather than clumsy acquisitions of media content and other ill-fitting pieces of an assimilated package. For similar reasons the the BORG Empire fell apart in the Star Trek series, individuals that make up the market want autonomy of choices and to deal on fair terms. I think TMUS is a buy at the current price despite the chance of pull backs. Over the next three years, the stock will be much higher. I do not like the platitudes like 'a sure double' or even firm targets. The market, the economy, and intervening events make that foolish IMO. However, TMUS looks poised to move higher because their position is strong relative to their size because that provides room for expansion of marketshare in both the mainstream consumer and the additional vertical and enterprise markets. I have to give a hand to Neville - I met him before TM started into LTE and was more committed to the continuance of 3G+ CDMA technologies. Since then, the paths they have chosen to pursue have been nearly immaculate. That has allowed the underdog to gain an upper hand relative to its size and make Sprint look like what it had become - a lost cause due to irrevocable past decisions."

"One way to gauge the impact of each new generation of wireless is to look at the availability of devices and compare that to previous xGs. A report published by the Global mobile Suppliers Association, (GSA), identifies seven 5G device form factors and announced devices. This shows close to 40 devices in total with 12 5G Smartphones. How does that compare to 3G and 4G? When the earlier generations rolled out the early devices were 3G and 4G HotSpot dongles with few phones initially available. The hotspots are easier to design and require a lower hurdle for qualifications on the operator's networks. They appear before there are many active networks to sell them on. 5G is different because the earliest networks have used the mmWave bands and have worked as fixed-broadband service to the homes/premises. The first 5G devices sold are 5G Home BB boxes. These are hybrid devices that used 5G as backhaul to the base station while using 3G-4G and WiFi to connect to users and home devices. Thus far, there are only 2-3 mobile phones available from Verizon and AT&T. By mid-2020 there should be six-12 phones qualified by each operator.T-Mobile has not joined the pre-availability hype stage of 5G. Verizon and AT&T's 5G programs amount to: '5G is great! You can now get it in 3% of the country, pay 2-3X more for devices that will be obsolete by the time you can use them! Join the Mad for 5G Club Today!'"

"According to T-Mobile's CEO John Legere and Softbank/Sprint's Claure, the WSJ and other reports that the DOJ has recently expressed that the merger is in difficulty is incorrect. ""The premise of this story, as summarized in the first paragraph, is simply untrue."" John's tweet Marcelo Claure's tweet looks a bit less definitive: ""This @WSJ article is not accurate. We continue to have discussions with regulators about our proposed merger with @TMobile."" It suggests that there are ongoing discussions with DOJ while Legere's tweet and previous statements seemed to indicate that the merger discussions were done and the merger process was likely just weeks away from reaching a favorable decision.The truth of the matter is that the DOJ maintains its independence. Until a decision is handed down, even the CEOs are guessing based on the odds that they have met the hurdles to gain a favorable decision. My view is that there are and will remain those within DOJ Antitrust that are 'strict constructionists' who rely mostly on the HHI and statistical observations of marketshare within wireless. That group sees less merit in the argument that the 'market' is one that has seen a rapid convergence between all forms of broadband and content delivery such that they must, at least to a degree, be considered to compete for the same markets. To simply ignore that overlap makes no sense as it has become evident that more consumers now consume broadband media over mobile devices and the fiber-cable companies have entered into the mobile market and are accelerating that push.I also think that New T-Mobile should have gotten further out in front of the issue of structural change that the DOJ and FCC have long said they wanted. This could have been made a positive factor in the proposal that would have countered the criticisms that the HFC companies do not compete in wireless to a degree that matters.Those two weaknesses are apparent: 1) NewTM have not emphasized that the two individual companies hold minor shares of the '5G applications', Failure to allow the merger will result in Verizon and AT&T holding a full duopoly position in the majority of 5G. 2) The argument that the Hybrid Fiber-Cable companies are competitors is not well supported by the statistics at this still early stage of the development of the wireless portion of their converged business. NewTM could have reinforced that argument by extending the Sprint+cableco working agreements into a blanker offering to do similar deals with all HFC companies. That could also offer to extend to the satellite companies - However, a different framework agreement would be needed as the satellite companies do not provide the similar exchange of infrastructure that benefits NewTM.Maybe this is just headline grabbing based on the dissonance with DOJ that runs counter to the main line of thinking. Or I could have been thinking that what is obvious is still not so obvious to pin-head lawyers."
Why does TMUS rally on merger failure and merger approval. This appears to be a red herring.

"If Sprint declares bankruptcy which may happen....who pays the bill? Tax payers. Than Att and Verizon get to buy more cheap assets and Jack up their prices. Also, 5g will most likely cost you way more than if Tmo has sprint and rolled out cheaper 5g plans. Att and Verizon has spent million lobbying against this deal for their greedy executives. We will find out soon how much dirty money is i. play to kill this deal soon. A tragedy of the public trust when they push this lie of higher prices. Remember it was Tmobile who lead the race with $100 up to 4 line with all the bells and whistle plan. The other carriers were over charging for the same plan as much as $50. They are afraid that the same scenario will play out with 5g plans."
"5-star JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick looks at the implications of the completed Sprint merger for TMUS, and writes, “We believe that T-Mobile will continue to offer a solid product for a lower price than peers AT&T and Verizon, and that the combined company’s network in a few years will be closer to parity with larger peers than it is today, offering more relative value to customers over time.”""Trading at 7.3x 2021E core EBITDA (or 6.0x including full EBITDA synergies) vs 6.6x Verizon and 6.3x AT&T we see T-Mobile as attractive,"" Cusick concluded.Cusick is impressed enough by the possibilities to initiate coverage of the stock with a Buy rating. His $110 price target suggests an impressive 34% upside potential."

"The NewTM merger is very likely to gain the approval of the DOJ in addition to the FCC without significant added requirements to what was worked out with the FCC. I think that the DOJ is justified in having concerns about the structural markup of the US ICT industry: we have created two major sectors of what is merging into the one Internet and Communications Technology Industry, ICT: the HFC, Hybrid Fiber-Cable infrastructure-based companies and the mobile-networks based companies. Both of these sets of broadband fracture are needed to deliver the cost-effective benefits of 5G. And that makes all of the buoyant talks about competition with China and miraculous popping into existence of 5G a big industry mind fart.If you want to see America advance better, and advance more quickly than China, then the two capital-intense pools of infrastructure must be put together asap. Why hasn't that already happened if it is so capital efficient? Because each of these ICT segments is effectively state-sanctioned monopolies that are bent on maximizing profits, not, ultimately, helping out poor slob consumers or promoting the competition of America versus China/Asia, Europe or anywhere else.To say otherwise is a bald-faced lie... the public may buy it but when you tuck yourselves in at night, your own brain doesn't."

"Mike Sievert t-mobile COO. makes strong arguments in his testimonial to the merger application.Among them is the plan to push into the home broadband/cable replacement market. The basic story has been around - that wireless can provide the first real alternative to cable service, thus causing much-needed competition in the field. What is interesting is that Mike mentions the expectations for market penetration. As a preface, Mike talks about how New T-Mobile would continue to follow the 'more for less' philosophy because that is what has and is expected to continue to lead to the company's success. He points out that it would be nonsensical to raise pricing as a result of the merger and spending near $40 billion on 5G over a 3-year period. The path to success is gained by filling up the network with new subscribers and new applications and usage patterns. That would further differentiate between T-Mobile and fric and frac (Urban dictionary ( ""Those two idiots you know and see often, who always hang out together"") and lead to greater sales momentum.Mike says,"" ..By 2024, New T-Mobile is expected to provide in-home broadband service to 9.5 million households nationwide, equating to approximately 7 percent market penetration, and making New T-Mobile potentially the fourth largest Internet service provider in the U.S. by subscribership.""I guessed it would be around 10% as an upside forecast, so a 7% figure seems doable. The thing is that while this would be a substantial new market that adds to revenue, the 'rest of the story' is that gains in the home broadband market would lead to extended gains in mobile subscriptions and strengthen the company's ability to pursue enterprise broadband and other applications. A gain of 9.5 million subs at a price level of just $30 per household would result in added revenue of $3.4 billion per year. The overall impact would be much greater, there would likely be 3-4X as many mobile subs added plus extended services that can ride on the beefed-up lower-latency network. The big reason why this would work, besides the technology aspect, is that the cost synergies of the combined networks, spectrum and operations would pay for the needed CapEx investments.It comes down to 'it would be stupid not to do it.'"
What out TMUS is dropping ...very deep
TMUS is the most expensive ever in relationship to DTEGY today. You should sell your TMUS stock and roll proceeds into DTEGY stock as they own over 560 million shares of TMUS. Plus you get a 4.29% yield on DTEGY stock.
Great analyst event...not sure why would drop so much. Maybe Hot money looking for quick pop just bailing out? Weird...
"Are you ready to T Mobile to go a lot lower. The White House has called T's CEO to the White House Because the White House now knows that T Mobile and VZ have been taken over by the EU one world order and both can not be trusted any more . LOL,LOL,LOL"
"T-Mobile has promised not to raise prices on plans for three years, and it will offer 5G connectivity at no additional charge. Similar 5G plans from Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) come with strings attached, requiring higher-tier plans or other upcharges.T-Mobile’s pricing is generally 10% to 20% lower than its larger rivals, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Philip Cusick. “We believe that T-Mobile will continue to offer a solid product for a lower price than peers AT&T and Verizon,” Cusick wrote in a recent report. He noted that the merger should allow T-Mobile to bring its network quality in line with AT&T and Verizon, “offering more relative value to customers over time.”"
"Let me just share how profitable the Sprint business is within TMobile umbrella:- Interest Payment - $2.6B before and less than $1.3B now- Churn - most of the Sprint customers churned to Tmobile - 1.8% before - less than 1% now this translates to more the a $1BSo just with this merger the Sprint business goes from break even to $2.3B +ve per year. Now kick-in the synergies around network, marketing, spectrum and new business opportunities. This will be $150 stock in less than two year...."
Though corruption is wrong and if judge Victor Marrero is of that kind then let's not forget all the help T-Mobile gave the island of Puerto Rico when they had the hurricane. The judge is Puerto Rican.

What is the reason today for this drop ? There is no news ? Is this profit taking or something else?

"The FCC formal ruling to approve the merger was long expected - it was simply a matter of timing. It does not change the odds of overcoming the AG's lawsuit because it was already considered in the defense of the merger. It has not sent the two stocks higher because it has already been fully factored in.The AG's lawsuit to block the merger is not a state-by-state vote. Some states, including New York have Public Service Commission (or called utilities commissions) that have approved the merger while the AGs in those states have joined the lawsuit to block it. Testimony can come in to support both the AG's and NewTM's side. However, the judge is not gong to rule on this on a state-by-state basis."
"Chart points to $49.18 before some support,safe short to under $50. with $42.50 as major support to cover short postions."
Best Thing about T-Mobile is they are not US owned. You get to hate on America and be a true Patriot.

What happened to TMUS 5G construction? I knew they were lying just to get their merger approval.
Once again network surveys determine that Sprint has the slowest network speeds according to PC Magazine. Network speed is an average of speed. Recent studies have also shown that Sprint's network varies in coverage quality and bandwidth speed to a higher degree than competitors networks. The underlying reason is the reliance on higher frequency 2.5GHz band spectrum.
"Looks like you are learning just to sell any move higher and for sure learning to say OH NO down TMUS goes LOL,LOL"
Do you know the number one reason not to do any business with TMUS. The fact is TMUS is not an American company. It was founded by the EU
So glad I held that position. I thought I was going to have to wait a couple weeks!!

"This merger is history, gone with the wind."
"Early in the morning on 12/12/2020, I booked a download speed of 330 Mbits/sec on 5G in south Florida."

Big earnings coming!
"Nothing but rave reviews coming in for TMUS, and all 12 analysts recommend buy, as she heads to $70+ with virtually no downside risk. Adding over 1+ mil subs for 19 straight quarters is an epic growth story that continues as TMUS opens up in markets it was previously not serving. CEO Legere has long left Sprint's crooked CEO Claure back in Bolivia, and has never looked back. The merger debacle was brilliantly played by the parent over Softbank, as Sprint heads into (or remains in) the abyss, TMUS soars to projected profits, and cash flow percentage increases that investors adore. With more buybacks expected, and the bullseye now on cable, plenty of good still expected to come under a solidly well run company and its brilliant management. If all that's going on, plus adding more subs each quarter against bigger and inferior comp in a very tight industry, and being ranked #1 in customer service by J.D. Powers isn't enough, how about being ranked having the best network too? Can that be true? If so, no one can stop them and who knows how high she can go.Buy / Hold TMUS for your profitable pleasures."
I hope it drops quiet a bit on averreaction because it will be good buying opportunity
"LOL,LOL,LOL even TMUS is going to have a hard time keeping customers. As T is now taking customers away more and more everyday now from TMUS . Why because of T's new unlimited cell plans that gets you HBO MAX for FREE that lets you drop NFLX and you can save even more money. WOW you don't even need to make this stuff up check it out on the T web site it's all there for anyone to see I am telling the truth. Just wait once T leverages it other assets to drive new customers , TMUS will be shaking in the boots. LOL,LOL,LOL T has built a real monster that no one company can compete with FACT"

Not sure where Verizon and att will find the cash to bid for c band. Right now both of them just have enough cash on hand to cover debt due in one year. With att expensive promotion of 550 on average per phone and 25 millions att customers are eligible this will cost them over 10 billions. For Verizon they just paid 3 billions in cash for track phone. Whereas T-Mobile has excess cash over short term debt of 15 billions. There is no way att and Verizon can bid against T-Mobile in the c band auction. It looks like T-Mobile is determined to maintain their 5 g advantage for a long time

"T-Mobile has improved as a long-term investment because they have ventured into the next phase of wireless expansion: bridging the home broadband and TV content services and wireless mobile space. This provides a path forward that goes beyond mobile expansion that might run into a level of exhaustion of easy opportunities such that it slows down. Media tied to advances in social media networking and unified services across devices/screens provides a $100 billion traditional market to pursue. It also provides new horizons of developing market opportunities. These include social-media tied to content and mobile payment services. These are numerous. For example, integration of FaceBook, Twitter, and other social-networking platforms into video content can be used to create user-authored content delivery that is social-network driven. That could mean that TV producers, actors, and media commentators could develop their own viewing 'channels' that watched popular movies, shows or sports events live or at their chosen time. The actors, writers, producers might answer questions in a side panel as the video is being watched. After the show, they would hang around to answer questions. The reason why they would do that is to promote their content and gain a loyal following. They might offer merchandise such as T-Shirts, coffee mugs, costumes, movie set memorabilia, etc. for sale.What's in that for the service provider/T-Mobile? They get free press and work or mouth advertising and build loyalty to a platform that is largely self-building. Instead of paying tens of billions for a content delivery platform that is static and costs money to populate, they build a user and content provider maintained a platform that largely is self-fulfilling. Wireless and cable companies are generally lousy at delivering content. That is why NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon, and other services have grown crazy even while the field was often called saturated with providers already. Many ANALysts and industry people got it wrong. I think they continue to misjudge what is transpiring. Which is great for T-Mobile because it is much easier to compete with the brain-dead."
"By raising its plans by just $5 a month (still less expensive than att and Verizon), its service revenue will increase by more than $5 billions annually and most if not all will go to the bottom line. This does not even take into account billions in synergies and increase market shares"
Now that they are woke let's get ready to short. happens every time.

"===Price Target $123 ==> T-Mobile price target raised to $123 from $105 at Argus Argus analyst Joseph Bonner raised the firm's price target on T-Mobile to $123 from $105 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company's competitive position in the wireless industry should be strengthened with the completed Sprint merger, the analyst tells investors in a research note, even though it may see some pressure from the impact of COVID-19 and integration challenges over the next several quarters. Bonner adds that the success of T-Mobile's service plan innovations has been evident in its ""robust subscriber acquisition metrics""."

I am a Sprint stock holder and I am wondering if the people here on this board think that a merger will happen. I have a profit and I was wondering whether to sell and keep away from Sprint or be taken into the TMUS family. Any ideas will be appreciated.
Warren Buffet bought 2.4 million shares of TMUS.
Verizon stock is not doing well. I will not be surprised if buffet trims vz and adds tmus
T-Mobile needs to bend: either they agree to help enable a competitive field that includes cablecos and satellite or DOJ might crush the deal altogether. The vague promise that the field is broadening has to be made real by offering a blanket structural deal.As it ever was.

"Could this be the reason for the recent selling? T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) showed a loss in earnings since Q3, totaling $820.00 million. Sales, on the other hand, increased by 5.55% to $20.34 billion during Q4. T-Mobile US reached earnings of $2.56 billion and sales of $19.27 billion in Q3.Why ROCE Is SignificantReturn on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, T-Mobile US posted an ROCE of 0.01%."
S brings $45B of debt for $36M rev to add customers? The 4th carrier would not make this much debt worth taking. TMUS needs to win customers not overpay for them. S is not innovative and only brings how cheap can we sell it to get customers. They sucker people in with a low rate and then tell people they have to lease a Sprint phone. There reputation is not worth $45B.
"Point72 added more than 636,000 shares to its position during Q3, an 84% increase. Billionaire investing legend Warren Buffett was also buying loads of TMUS shares during Q3, 2.4 million in total. The telecom giant grew revenue by an impressive 74% year-over-year in the third quarter to $19.27 billion and crushed rivals AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in postpaid net additions, topping the 2 million mark."
"From the self-serving and misinformed opposition group:""And, while the parties tout the merger’s supposed benefits for rural Americans, the evidencedemonstrates that the merger would do nothing to enhance service for these consumers. As atechnical matter, the merged parties’ spectrum would not be particularly well-suited for ruralcoverage. The parties would, instead, be faced with the same challenge that exists today, whichis the need to make significant capital investments to reach sparsely populated areas. There isno reason to expect New T-Mobile to be motivated to make that investment post-merger, ascompetitive pressures lessen.Even more troubling, instead of enhancing coverage, the merger threatens to undermine theservices that rural Americans currently enjoy. Today Sprint stands out for its willingness towholesale its network to rural wireless carriers – making roaming services possible for theircustomers – as well as educational entities that lease spectrum to Sprint. T-Mobile, on the otherhand, has shown no such interest in partnering with rural providers or continuing the public-private partnerships with educational entities.""'No reason'? Greed and power, the biggest motivators for much of personal and business activity."

"New SmartPhone announcements have become less newsworthy as the devices and market has matured. It is important for New T-Mobile to have store shelves fill up with mid-priced models because that will enourage customers to switch to take advantage of the dest deals among US operators. The early 5G phones have been pricey: $1,100-$2,100 price range. ""Today T-Mobile announced that the OnePlus 8 5G smartphone is coming to T-Mobile on April 29 and the Un-carrier’s got the wireless exclusive on the Interstellar Glow color! The new Sub-6 5G smartphone taps into T-Mobile’s 600 MHz 5G network, the first and only nationwide 5G network AND it’s ready to rock 2.5 GHz as the Un-carrier lights it up."" These devices will be around $700. The early reviews concur that they provide most of the advanced features found in high-end models and are a good value.The ability to use both the 600 MHz and 2.5 GHz bands helps set the stage for the shift to a unified network starting this year.This year, 2020, is going to see the announcement of the unification of T-Mobile+Sprint networks, customer service, retail operations, and targeting of diversified market segments. However, it will look more like the ground-breaking of the 1+1=3 leveraging that will come as the talk of network and service capabilities is fleshed out.The device piece is an important foundational element."

"Reuters and the Financial Times report that Deutsche Telekom CEO, Hoettges, said, at a recent convention, that the ""big M&A"" was T-mobile recent acquisition of $8 billion in 600 Mhz low-band spectrum that better allows TMUS to compete as a stand-alone company. This should sound like a skipping record because that type of statement has been repeated by T-Mobile's executives on numerous occasions. In a staff memo this week, Mr Hoettges said that the valuation, financing, regulatory issues and control had been four issues that derailed the merger talks. He told reporters on today in Germany that the two companies could re-engage. ““I rule nothing out,” he said. (meaningless cookie-cutter type statement).DT reported slightly higher than expected quarterly results and increase in company forward guidance. T-Mobile has become the highest growth part of DT's operations. There is little reason to do a dilutive deal or one faced with control conflicts unless it is otherwise compelling. I think that basically what Hoettges position has become is to let T-mobile stay independent so long as a great deal comes along. If the trends remain in place, T-Mobile will continue to gain scale and expand into vertical markets and market segments at a more rapid pace that the US industry growth. In other words, T-Mobile's bargaining position will improve over time.The fact that M*A activity with cable companies, DISH, or Sprint do not threaten T-Mobile. IN the 1st place, mergers look unlikely. In the 2nd, the impact of mergers would not offer up much change in competition. Overall there is a low risk that convergence or consolidation among like companies will avert T-M's trajectory."

"Are CEO Legere's attacks on Verizon justified? Given that the reported loss of subscribers was relatively modest, Legere's attack on the leading consumer wireless company may be viewed as crossing a line. However, when taken in context, Legere's bashing of Verizon fits in with what he should be doing as the as the 'Salesman in Chief' of the junkyard (under) dog. A key to the rising underdog's success is to point out the opponents weaknesses while emphasizing your own strengths. Whether anyone likes or totally takes the statements at face value is not as important as making the point that you are gaining on them by making fewer missteps and offering a better value. ""The media is the message' - not as much the details of the message as gaining acceptance that the basic premise holds up and is of value to consumers. I like Legere's style even though I might find it hard to wear pink so brazenly. But even if you hate the guy, the message may stand out as being worth considering."

Now that Tmobile is taking on Verzion they will not need Sprint. With the new hearing starting to take place it is obvious that this MegaMerger will be denied.
This company needs buyback programs- strong aggressive PRWe could take it to $300 Then split to accept initial buyers
TMUS might have an upward bounce inititaly because the merger was costing them a lot. Then reality will set in that now they have a 4th competitor. The pain wasn't worth the gain.
"This is the only stock Warren's bought that I will touch. TMUS has no competition, it's over. T and Verizon are deadmeat...."
"Zack's article asks if last quarter's growth among the top four US operators can continue through all of this year. It may but that is not that important: if the 1.8 million post-paid subscriber gain were replicated each quarter of 2018 the percentage gain for the mobile players would be less than 1/2 of 1% annual growth. The economy is showing improvement that carried over from teh Obama administration and is now being stimulated by the deep tax cuts. That should result in additional growth in the sector. However, the degree of new subscribers will depend on how broad-based the growth turns out to be and whether inflation in basic goods, rents and mortgage and auto loan interest rates zap the strength of the recovery. However, that is likely not going to happen for at least a couple of years. The current outlook is for an acceleration of growth in the economy that should help the marginal parts of the population to become mobile subscribers. The Zacks article highlights IoT as the segment most likely to spur growth. It should help but not to a degree that kicks growth into the double digits. What will continue to propel growth for T-Mobile is taking share away from competitors while gaining a larger proportion of new subscribers. The fact that all operators reported some growth last quarter throws a bit of caution: is this a sign that competition for subscribers is heating up and that T-Mobile will no longer absorb 'all of the mobile growth' as the company has boasted in the past? There is a combination of a stimulated economy, high saturation of the market for basic services, and possible evening out of the competition that may lead to continued growth for T-Mobile while it is also harder to differentiate, causing more of a sharing of industry growth.The biggest opportunity for mobile operators is expansion into cable-replacement, IoT, and automotive IMO."

That puts even more pressure on TMUS stock. The current quarter, to be reported Aug. 5, may also be pressured by the pandemic.Yet the shares are rising. Some smart money is piling in. You might want to think about joining them."
"The problem T-Mobile faces is convincing the FCC and DOJ that the merger of the two weaker MNOs is a better alternative than leaving Verizon and AT&T control 2/3rds of a market that is gobbling up surrounding segments of the ICT business.Mobile operators have become monopolies, tying together products and services that retail, enterprise and government buyers cannot avoid. That applies to the entire field of operators, not just Verizon and AT&T. That view is held by DOJ and the FCC as they look at the decision whether to allow the merger. Already, the industry practice of packaging services and devices can be construed as anti-competitive and the standards and practices promoted by 3GPP, CTIA, and other industry organizations are under scrutiny as being anti-competitive.The industry has developed to a point that it will encompass broadband to the home and cloud IT services. That creates a scenario in which the industry is certain to run up against greater resistance to its market power and further consolidation. That is why it is only a 50:50 shot, at best, that the merger would be approved unless it is constructed to be a structural change that enables cable companies to compete. The cable companies are the only service providers that can fulfill the 4th leg of the competition. While Legere likes to present them as competitors 4 through 7, that is hardly realistic. The cable companies have scant chance of competing directly against the MNOs. There gambit is to hold onto wired broadband as the anchor to extension of service to mobile. Even so, wireless broadband remains the force to be rechoned as capacity grows over coming years with the use of mmWave bands that compete with the need to use fiber optic and cable.If T-Mobile is not offering to help cable companies compete, the chances of the merger are greatly reduced. That would be what looks to be in the best interests of the Carriers, which will make T-Mobile's claim to be an Un-Carrier false.As for the investment, T-Mobile remains on track. If the merger fails to gain approvals, they will continue to push on. However, the claim of being the 'Un-Carrier' will likely tarnish as the public comes to view the company as being little different and government regulators come to pressure the sector due to its monopolistic bent."

T-Mobile earnings one week from today.....trades appear to be setting up with a positive report expected.
"Sprint (S) is locked into the merger deal until it is ruled approved or not. That pegs the price with TMUS. The market has discounted S by about 10% below the deal exchange rate. Most likely, the stocks will trend sideways within the same range as prior to the deal. Right now, both stocks are at the low end of the months-long range. As there is reason to believe the deal will either be approved or not, the stocks might move up or down accordingly. Since they are at the lower end of the range, there is some reason, although not confirmed until it happens, to think that the stocks will be biased to the upside as uncertainty eases. A minor indication that DOJ is 'listening' to the merger proposal might be taken as a positive because it would come as news that counters the common opinion that the DOJ is inclined to deny approval and might push against it as they had done a few years ago when Softbank wanted to acquire T-Mobile shortly after acquiring Sprint.There is the congressional committee on foreign ownership of US companies that must give its OK, however, since both T-Mobile and Sprint are majority owned by companies in Allie countries already and they would certainly agree with security and other US interests, I doubt that will be a problem. However, it must be mentioned because 'you just never know'."

"My experience with T-Mobile:Long story short, worst customer service I've ever experienced in my entire life. So bad, I can only think of one other awful experience with an auto repair shop. Partnered with a relative on my plan. That person died. 3 visits to 2 separate dealers, 3 phone calls to reduce my bill failed. I'm talking about 3+ hours of total time of my getting the run around; months of being overcharged. After destroying both sim cards in front of staff at 2 different stores, and false claims that my request were to be honored ( a lowered bill), I simply dumped TM. But WAIT! There's more! Because of weak Wi-fi in certain spots at my home, TM offered a personal Cell Spot booster, for free. At the time I thought, NICE! They were clear, I would need to return it should I ever leave TM. Of course, no problem --- so I thought. Finally recognized by TM that I am not paying anymore, soon I get in the mail their procedure for returning the booster. BTW, it clearly states that I can return it to a store or ship it. Ummm, good thing I saved the box and it's internal partition! That said, the repackaging requirement was never mentioned when I got the unit. So to a store or shipped, those 2 options only, either way it stipulated the unit must be returned in it's original box, repackaged properly! I get to the store, they tell me to ship it. They're refusing to accept it. After much discussion, even showing the notice with the store return option and my getting a bit loud, they agree to accept it. However, they will give me no receipt for same. I leave it. Snap a pic with my new phone. Over the previous several months I learned of 2 other instances. One an actual TM employee who died. His parents had extreme difficulty getting that resolved. Another, a military guy who was shipped overseas for 6 months. They wouldn't suspend his bills. What an awful company!"
"From what I understand, you receive a TMUSR for every share of TMUS you own. For every 20 TMUSR you received, those can be exchanged through your broker for the right to buy 1 share of TMUS at $X price offered by T-Mobile. Effectively, T-Mobile is letting you buy 1 share per 20 you own at the reduced price of $X. I would expect that you can exercise them anytime up to expiration. You can also trade your TMUSR to someone wanting to invest the capital to get the discount. Based on the price of TMUSR, you would trade 20 of those rights to someone at $0.18 a right for them to buy a share of TMUS. So it will cost them $106 - 20x$0.18=$102.40 all in to purchase TMUS. So, I'm guessing your offering price is $103ish? If so, you save $3 share as of today since you don't buy the TMUSR but can use 20 of the ones you've received to buy one discounted TMUS."

"T-Mobile is likely to be the greatest beneficiary of the US FCC's 600MHz auction. The FCC 'Incentive Auction' is in the final stages of bidding that determines the final price and allocations of spectrum. The prior 'Reverse auction' phase determined that 84MHz is offered up by TV broadcast license holders for the 'Forward auction' phase that fine-tunes the spectrum and prices paid. The results of the forward auction, which has concluded, determined that 84MHz of spectrum total with 70MHz licensed to operators is on the auction block for the final phase. It also determined the baseline price at which broadcast holders are willing to part with their spectrum and clearing costs. This works out well for T-Mobile because 1) there is a 20MHz set-aside for bidders who hold less low-band spectrum than the key holders Verizon and AT&T. The amount offered assured this set-aside and enough more to allow TM to better fill low-band needs. 2) The price level has dropped from the pre-auction process speculation of setting a new record price that would be as high or higher than the AWS auction around $2.50/MHz/POP. The target for the conclusion of the auction is now $1/25/MHz/POP and current bidding for bellwether New York City area currently stands at $1.08/MHz/POP. Since NYC tends to be among the highest price areas for spectrum, we might assume that the average price will fall somewhere under the target of $1.25/MHz/POP. That puts T-M's likely cost near the same as the 700MHz auction that took place about five years.The auction has some problems: some analysts think it may take up to six years before all the licensed spectrum is made available. T-Mobile's Neville Ray and others have said they can get some of the spectrum cleared much sooner - within several months of the conclusion of the auction. That makes sense from the view that T-M needs deeper coverage of low-band to reach into suburban and rural areas that may now be unused and thus easier to clear/put to use. Why has the auction not come in as high as expected? Verizon and AT&T already have significant low band spectrum - up to 60MHz with 20-40MHz in most areas. And the two had spent heavily (recklessly?) to acquire AWS spectrum that put a lot of debt on the books. Another factor is that LTE-Advanced 4G-5G technology can help extend coverage using mid-band spectrum while having fewer interference difficulties. For whatever reasons, the auction appears to be headed to conclude to be a major benefit to T-Mobile as they try to continue their momentum in networks and marketshare gains."
Democrats fought for 2 years to stop this merger....R must be a die hard Socialist too.
"T-Mobile Wins 5G Availability Award: Customers Get 5G 56x More Often than VerizonWhat’s the news: In its latest 5G report, Opensignal found that T-Mobile customers have the best 5G availability and can get a 5G signal more often than customers on any other network. Meanwhile, Verizon 5G customers only connect to 5G 0.4% of the time.Why it matters: Customers need to have access to 5G before they can experience it and benefit from it, so T-Mobile is making sure customers have coverage. Opensignal’s latest report shows T-Mobile customers have the best 5G availability. Which is no surprise because T-Mobile has the largest 5G network – 28,000 times bigger than Verizon."

"Today's headline is about T-Mobile and Sprint working together to implement joint-network spam/robo calling. The FCC has chided the US industry for not having implemented spam prevention methods that had been developed a few years ago. Despite the rhetoric, the industry had not rallied around the shaken/stirred broad platform spam recognition and banning protocols. The FCC pushed this forward last year and the operators are, finally, responding to control what is obviously in their wheelhouse. Congrats on doing your job VZ, T, TMUS and S. The broad Spam/robo call protection is a much needed layer of security. It amounts to removing abuse that cropped up due to the ease of spoofing and call automation... a taking back of control lost to the proliferation of wireless and IP based calling. This is good for consumers and it indicates how closely Sprint and T-Mobile are now working together to align their network operations. The core networks will be consolidated under the merger in a process that started several months ago. It might be considered to have started with Google Fi which requires that the networks hand over connections seamlessly from the user's perspective. The seamless handover and multiple-band aggregation of networks is an important element for making the user experience better rather than disruptive. The way for New T-Mobile to deliver the benefits of 'best US network' that will be claimed is to make the new co-network devices that make optimal use of the combined networks. That is how the 2.5-2.6 GHz will have the most significant impact: delivering the wide coverage reach and building penetration of T-Mo's low band plus the high bandwidth using Sprint's spectrum that is re-organized into wide-channel bands. Older devices will not be able to deliver the full promise so the merger will initiate a more potent upgrade cycle than Verizon and AT&T can deliver upon. The newer 5G modem chips from Qualcomm and other suppliers have greater ability to use wide channels, 50-100 MHz and wider through carrier aggregation. That is how nTMUS can fulfill the plans to deliver 100-300 Mbps per user cable-like broadband performance across most of the country.Blah, blah, blah... filling space."
Remember the stock mkt is gambling. Just never bet the rent and the grocery money.....
"T-Mobile recently announced the rollout of NB-IoT. This uses what are called 'guard bands' to transmit the low-bandwidth data that is needed for most types of IoT. The guard bands are used to buffer the channels used for mobile or data-link communications. A narrow band of 512Khz to over 1 MHz is used on both sides of an up and down FDD link or TDD channel. This has been the 'no man's land' that has been left unused because radio waves can spill over into the bank through harmonic distortion or improperly isolated RF. However, modern 4G-5G systems have become much better at reducing interference so that, most of the time, the guard bands are not needed. And the 4G-Advanced and 5G systems do a better job of measuring the signal environment so that if interference occurs they can use other bands, trim power, or use signal processing to reduce the impact. This allows the guard bands to be used. IoT fits well into the guard bands because it can be designed to use low power, thus causing less interference with the adjoining high-power mobile band.What is ""the big deal"" about T-Mobile's introduction of NB-IoT is that ""they did it"".. this is not likely to generate an immediate surge in revenue but its something T-Mobile is again first out of the gate with and it has real benefits. I have spent little time pondering the use cases. I think it will take time for IoT to spin up the more exciting opportunities because many are already being satisfied or are low cost and will take time to generate large numbers. I was searching this weekend for a medical alert monitor for my Mom who is 88 yo - maybe NB-IoT would be a benefit for this type of application."
"Why should investors be interested in the mobile wireless sector? Fear that growth has stalled and that competitors will head into severe price competition have held down P/E, P/S ratios despite the majority of companies reporting better than expected earnings. Sales have flattened out, particularly when compared with prior years. The biggest growth opportunity for mobile operators over the next three-ten years is providing a replacement for cable and home phone service. John Legere has repeatedly pointed out that cable companies are pigs that have an abusive relationship with their customers. ""The most Hated in the Land"" wild-west slogan applies to the cable monstrosities. What's more, the CEO of Charter and Comcast seem to gloat over it. Spectrum-Charter's CEO, Tom Rutledge, chortled that Spectrum would end the more consumer-friendly rate policies of Time Warner and Brighthouse cable after acquiring those companies. Spectrum soon institutionalized its bate-and-switch foot in the door rate plans and raised pricing across the board to its existing Charter subscribers as well. The company has tightened up on the tactic of customers to drop service and then reconnect in order to get the lower promo pricing. And it has shortened the duration of the bate-and-switch promo period down to 12 months.This has caused a lot of hate to build up among customers who cannot switch because the only choice is almost equally despised AT&T or other DSL slower broadband provider.The US market is primed for mobile operators to take share away once they build cost-competitive high sustained bandwidth 5G networks. That is not as simple as some of the PR and articles suggest - the speed of the 5G connection to the user's home is only as good as the end-to-end network can provide during peak usage periods. Mobile is a 'different ball of wax' but in order to take a major portion of the home cable broadband service market away from the Most Hated in the Nation cable slobs in a way that they can appeal and charge as such, T-Mobile must be close enough to the sustained broadband speed so that the user experience is acceptable to 80%-90% of households (""under the bell curve""). The market opportunity for mobile to take dollar share away from the cable muckrakers is coming. It won't have a significant impact until probably 2021 or 2022 but early signs of how well cable-replacement is being received in the market will start to appear next year.. maybe a few trial signals late this year."
T-Mobile is unlikely to acquire DISH because it does not need the spectrum or satellite operations that much. DISH's stock price is at a level that does not discount the erosion that will take place in satellite subscribers as high frequency spectrum. Wireless broadband will become a more competitive way to deliver TV/movie video to the home plus mobile service than cable. Who might acquire DISH? 1) Nobody. 2) Verizon - they need more spectrum. 3) A cable company.
"T-Mobile management represented at the MH communications forum said that T-Mobile is enthusiastic about entering merger talks with Sprint, however, is also excited about possible talks with Charlie Ergen/DISH and the cable companies. T-mobile's starting point for talks is that the company is doing well as an independent company and has a long-term path to success while remaining a stand-alone. However, the company recognizes the benefits that might be derived from achieving higher scale through a merger with Sprint so long as that can be made to be financially viable.Braxton Carter said 'talks will take place' which probably indicates that preliminary discussions have already taken place that spell the make or break rules for proposal options. T-Mobile sees potential deals to set up joint networks that wholesale access. Braxton describes the perspective as being what has previously been the long-term outlook: that the wireless-wired converged space will have multiple service providers that take part in mobile wireless through their own and shared and wholesale access to networks. The foundation of the 'network of networks' marketplace will be having the most capital and network efficient exploitation model that also is leveraged by the most efficient and opportunistic marketing approach, which starts with network capabilities to achieve coverage and penetrate into buildings.So, while the meeting provided little in the way of new information, it did emphasize that T-Mobile is eager to hold discussions... as the kingpin 'decider'."

"The merger has a very high probability of being concluded: It remains about 99.5% odds IMO. The AG's lawsuit will put the conclusions of the DoJ and FCC to a test in the court, basing it on the antitrust laws and facts-based analsysis and testimony. The case is not a vote by individual states - that is not what determines the merger of national firms. If it were, how would the judge tally it? Would the judge consider the Public Service Commissions rulings in favor or the AG's against? Or would the judge let the two cancel each other out? That is, of course, making fun of the way some are looking at how this case will be heard.Testimony opposing or supporting the merger will be entered into testimony but it must be done in support of the impact of the merger on a nationwide basis. The complaint does not claim harm or remedies on a state-by-state basis."

"Will T-Mobile (TMUS) move higher?Since hitting a low early in July, TMUS has shot up and has now closed a gap and hit a strong resistance level around 63. Chart analysis suggests it may take time to get through that resistance. My opinion is that TMUS faces two major currents: Continued improvement in fundamentals suggest a continued upward bias that, so long as it continues, will lead to higher prices. However, the speculative adder seen in past months has reason to continue to dissipate as what I suspected has come to pass: DT-TM strong position has led to confidence that they can continue to grow. Despite the prospect of a substantial network, financial and operational efficiencies, there is also a huge risk factor and, possibly, derailing of the growth engine that propels T-Mobile well above the improvement in spectrum position and networks alone. I think TMUS will be in a range for a while. It may burn off the overhead resistance or just trend sideways through teh summer. The fundamental trends remain in tack and that eventually drives the stock price. However, there is speculative and reading overhead resistance. The market still has lingering fears that T-Mobiles performance is 'too far out there' to be sustained. I think the performance speaks for itself, however, given the way media and image are projected into everything, it will take a while, perhaps another quarter's results, before TMUS heads much higher."

"California and other states dropped their opposition to the merger as expected. This will have a minor impact because it should already be factored in. Some financial analysts apparently have a limited understanding of the way the regulatory and legal system works: recently one was quoted as reporting that the merger still might not be final... as it there was serious chance that California or the Green Meanies of the unknown might block it. The merger was a done deal except in the minds of the feeble-brained or those who get paid to sit on fences imo (ANALysts). They should grow balls (or vagies). Anyway, the focus can shed that saddle spur and get on with the ride."

"TMUS needs to start paying a dividend. Legere likes to brag about all these new customers and increased revenue/profit, but the average share price hasn’t moved much in the past 2 years.

If the merger happens then I think there is a possibility that they will end T-Mobile Tuesdays and instead pay dividends.
"If DOJ is primarily concerned about maintaining the ability for MVNOs to compete in the space, that would be great for the New T-Mobile merger. The MVNOs carry the low-price-plan banner partly because the brand name facilities-based operators have intentionally gone along with a bifurcation of the market. During the evolution of the industry, MVNOs have come into existence due to pressure from regulators to have more competition and the desire of the facilities-based 'carriers' to shield their customers from lower price plans under their own umbrellas. Like it or not, infrastructure-based operators carry the traffic and the access no matter if TMUS labels themselves Un-Carrier.If the majority of what DOJ and FCC require to allow Sprint and T-Mobile to merge is for them to continue to provide wholesale MVNO service, they will come away with a better deal than I have expected."

"Appraisal of TMUS and S's investment theme:Stocks will be volatile because of the exaggerated uncertainty of the AG lawsuit, markets, and change of focus from the merger to the obstacles and promise of the outlook for New T-Mobile (NewTM).There well may be more shake-out periods in which the stocks move down sharply, losing 10-30% of their value in the span of a few days. The enforces the role that stop-loss order should play. Unless you can sit in front of a stock screen every hour, moves can occur too quickly to react manually. Since over 75% of NASDAQ volume occurs using program/algorithmic (algos) trading, small investors can get crushed before they can read about it. Time for some investors to step out of their horse and buggies and into the sports cars that pros routinely use that are now widely available. S, TMUS and DISH are at the point of selling that they can rebound given a market rebound or encouraging news. Buy-accumulate on dips... this is a dip."

"Taking profits before next big leg down,Analyst all agree Tmobile peaked and it is showing in the sell off,get out while you still can!"
"The odds of the merger remain high. The opposition to the merger, including those within the DOJ, have been known and expected. Since the DOJ Antitrust Division is the toughest hurdle and can decide regardless of the FCC's opinion whether the merger is approved on antitrust grounds, those outside of the DOJ cannot know for certain how the heads are leaning until they render their decision. Unintended leaks occur from DOJ. It is not uncommon for the WSJ, Barron's, etc. to write about rumors. Sometimes these prove correct, often they are only part of the story.It is been understood that there is a methodology of determining whether companies enter into antitrust concerns and that there is a group with DOJ who routinely practice it. Among them are those who I called 'strict constructionists': they rely more on past decisions and strict interpretation of the guidelines including the HHI for determining if there is too much concentration if a merger is allowed to move ahead. However, there is also the growing awareness and statistics that show that wired, wireless, computing, media, industrial, automotive, defense and first responder, etc. have and will continue to converge at an accelerating pace. The merger between T-Mobile and Sprint if not the same as it was five years ago. The merger of AT&T and T-Mobile is very much different than NewTM."
If I am tmus I would back out now ! This S is a mess and bad press .
"Will TMUS trend up down, sideways? Is the stock worth holding now or does it make sense to pull out for now and return if the prospects for the merger become better known?My guess is that TMUS will continue to trade in a range. The stock has seen over a 10% gain since May and is now at a resistance level. The momentum in sales and financial performance look good, however, the deal may hold it back from breaking out.Sprint is tied to TMUS - S's performance remains sub-par with its merger hopeful. It trades at a 10%-14% discount to the deal ratio. If the deal fails, Sprint will likely head lower IMO. If you are a stock trader vs. long-term investor, there are more exciting stocks than watching the paint dry on the New T-Mobile merger stocks."
"As posted earlier, the delay in striking a deal to merge with Sprint has been seen as being needed by T-Mobile and Deutsche Telkom in order to peg an exchange value on Sprint shares and other terms. It may also be delayed to allow the new head of the antitrust department of DOJ to get situated in the job. That is thought to be helpful in overcoming DOJ staffers historical opposition to a merger between the remaining four nationwide mobile companies. It may also be delayed in order to give people working on the merger to work on alternatives to counter DOJ's objections based on the merger is anti-competitive. It could be that they want to explore more options for overcoming those objections. Besides that, working more on the strategic alternatives may be worthwhile as it may help position the companies to think through the way forward if the merger gains approval."

"""To be, or Not to Be ... the BORG... that is the Question""The wireless industry is on a path to compete directly for almost all broadband services, including Gigabit IT network connections. This adds to the what I long ago posited as the ""Resistance if futile. You will be assimilated"" theme that the wireless players, particularly fric and frac, er. Verizon and AT&T, would grow to become like the BORG Empire.T-Mobile is a mobile operator despite branding themselves as the 'Un-Carrier'. The industry, like any other, has the objective of gaining competitive ground. In the process, it helps to craft industry standards, lobbies Congress, engages in PR, gives to charities, etc. in hopes of creating the environment in which it can embrace new markets. ""Business is War!... take no prisoners!"" ie. business tends to push the limits imposed on it by economics, application of technology, the ramp of markets, etc. In doing so, it can run afoul of public and private interests. Competition has winners and losers. And it has rules that government has established so that a fairly level playing field is maintained. There will be an increasing clash between the wireless industry and IT/networking, Internet etc. that causes friction. Some of that will boil over into anti-trust issues. And if the industry, particularly the smaller players including T-Mobile and Sprint, are not careful, it can tar the underdogs with the same brush that it does the larger companies who stand to gain the most. T-Mobile and Sprint must not jump into the bad graces of DOJ and public sentiment if they hope to lead the way forward. If TM pursues the same control-freak objectives that VZ and T are pushed towards, they will lose out on the broad objective to gain on the competition and lead a way forward that is acceptable to 'the rest of us'."

"LOL,LOL,LOL good luck tomorrow LOL,LOL,LOL one day soon the FBI will show up at TMUS offices LOL,LOL,LOL You are know now it's coming"
What the hell is wrong with T mobile
"Should I mention my strong belief in dish again? :) seriously, Dish is going higher and tmus ~ s whatever comes of it has been beneficial"
"""Why is T-Mobile stock down today?"" Best answer: Because the price for stocks in the market move up and down by the minute, hour, day, week.. and longer."" While the title helps catch eyeballs, the 'down' move was within the normal range of movement. Looking at the all of the longer-term charts shows TMUS remains neat historical highs. That means that the down statement is being sensational in order to sell the articles advertizing. If taken literally, some fellow idiots might sell based on that headline. With TMUS near its all-time highs, who is to say that might not latter prove to have been a good short to mid-term move. Or the stock could break to the upside if there is improvement in the expectations that the merger will be completed. The certain thing is that the headline is worthless and could prove costly if taken at face value. The article does provide a good recap of the quarterly results... but Market Unrealist should use more intelligent headlines IMO."
this is all bs. sprint merger or not tmobile has spent most of the past 52weeks in the 60s so this is a buy opportunity buy while its this low because its not going to go down much if any from this point... look at the EPS growth year over year!!
After-markets is going to burn ..
hmmmmm
"Like I said yesterday here, this will trade below 70"
I bet Tmobile cancel this merger within the next 30 days once regulars realize this is a rich mans scam
ADDED SHARES ON THE DIP. EASY 3 YEAR HOLD.
tmus does 82 plus today
If GameStop is $120...TMUS should be $1200!
US Market at all time highs and greens daily most of the year by why the individual stocks acts solo performance like downs and reds while theres no reason for example t mo and sprint down today and many other days daily? is this market fakesim?
AT&T is a better player. This is absolutely ridiculous for me to even get .

Where's the dividend on this German owned company??
$TMUS $S https://t.co/zs0ndffbqI
If this MEGA MERGER is canelled this TMUS will jump to 80+
Best ready for 5G.I would choose TMUS over VZ anyday.Best spectrum means less overhead cost due to less cell tower. 5G is 15x more expensive to set up and VZ needs a lot more cell towers (possibly through lease and joint networks). Also TMUS isn't necessarily in needs for mid band whereas VZ must have this. VZ's network plan will be in mess if it goes to 6G and beyond. TMUS is a clear winner
T-Mobile US reached an all time high at 119.18
I just read that DISH is very interested in Sprint .
"Earnings likely will take a hit because of merger costs. I suspect a short term pull back, before it takes off again."
"Sprint has become a strong short-term technical buy: the chart has hit short-term trading buy while the mid-term chart has a favorable 'head and shoulders' formation while hugging the 200-day moving average line with a bullish rise in accumulate/distribution. Sprint (S) remains event-driven and correlated to the price of TMUS. This chart formation trading set up is best handled using a program/algorithm conditional trading order: while the stock may be bought at the current market price, an order to sell all or part of the new position should be set. If the stock falls below 5.80, to sell. However, the odds look better to the upside: The stock looks ready to bounce. Further than a bounce, if S breaks above the 6.50 level it could head significantly higher IMO.Longer-term investors should continue to accumulate a mix of TMU and S. SFTBY was a buy late last year and in January 2019. It has since soared from a low under 32 to a high of over 50. I think there is some upside left but the stock is not nearly as depressed. Favorable news of the merger may have less impact at this point."
Why Sprint Stock Should Be Avoided? Be cause its going to drag down Tmobile
TMUS is currently being heavily shorted. There's a lot of total BS on here. There's not a single Analyst rating it a Sell. Smart money will hold and accumulate driving the price back up soon.
"The state AG's case has made a big deal about an internal study performed for parent Deutsche Telekom on the prospects of T-Mobile within the US business and regulatory environment and the merger with Sprint. The plaintiffs pursued testimony that construed the report as having been done internally rather than commissioned to an outside analyst firm. The key points the AG’s tried to convey to Judge Marrero was that Deutsche thought the merger would provide less competition and allow maintaining higher prices. The AGs elsewhere asserted that the set of agreements including the DISH agreement has not facilitated structural reforms as the AG’s strongly assert, was the aim of DoJ AR’s Makan Delrahim. However, the Deutsche study that the AGs strenuously sought to be disclosed outlines the underlying reasons for the conclusion that the US market was less competitive and thus higher prices than the EU and other markets in which Deutsche TK operates: “Still no mobile wholesale obligation, thus no new market disruptive market entries (MVNO),”Once again foiled by their own lop-sided view of the world: The AG led the charge to disclose the Deutsche TK internal report that said the US market WAS more attractive and ripe for a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint by virtue of having less threat of wholesale competition to the level that it would create market disruption. However, they dismissed out of hand the impact of the merger agreements that include a seven-year wholesale commitment to DISH for access to the latest deployed network, first rights to the decommissioned base stations, first rights to Sprint low-band spectrum, etc. In effect, the AG’s have helped make the case for the merger: The situation that the Deutsche report outlines has been the US competitive status quo that would otherwise continue if the merger is struck down. This points out that the nature of the agreements orchestrated by Makan Delrahim’s DoJ AR department has gone directly at the causes (including cable competition shortfalls not discussed here) for lack of disruptive competition from new players in the USA.“Youse wants disruptive wholesale agreements like in more competitive markets? We be given you what's youse wants and then some …suck on that.”"
"Hmm... I am surprised that this stock is so cheap. It looks like a really good value buy based off of my analysis. Also, I noticed while browsing through the SEC filings that Deutsche Telekom Holding B.V. scooped up 570,000 shares on the 14th and 15th of this month (February)."

"The first combined quarterly earnings is out tomorrow TMUS, what is everyones sentiment? IMO, I think they will beat and excite the market."
Congratulation to T-Mobile and Deutsch Telecom. You will beat AT&T and Verizon 10 years from now. Just do it right.
Tmobile sure knows gow to crank out profits! The merger synergies will keep 5G deployment costs from cutting into these profits and allow new Tmobile to continue to provide lower prices for consumers without hitting the bottom line.. Merger is a no brainer positive for consumers!
"Well into the 2nd year now: T-Mobile and Sprint, WT Docket 18-197Jun 15, 2018 - Public NoticeBetter hope these $1,000/hr (whatever) corp attorneys did their homework this weekend, and have a winning strategy to close this thing, for how many years will it be in the end?

"These guys are going all out on this merger trying to convince everyone that this is a Good Deal. They have created their on BS website, AllFor5G.com, they are paying analyst to write misleading positive information that this merger will be great. They even had Jack working the board till everything crashed. What a mess they have created. Major job loss, crashed stock price, upcoming higher consumer pricing and poor service. Just a Rich Mans Game."

Instead, he said, such an increase would come only if accompanied by improved service""."

"Less Masayoshi, better management. Don't repeat the mistake Sprint made"
"There has never been a requirement for a fixed number of wireless carriers. That assumption is a mischaracterization of the antitrust laws and how they are regulated. That arose because AT&T and Verizon had consolidated smaller operators and grew from wired underpinnings to capture about 70% of the consumer segment of the diversified wireless empire. Because of that lopsided market structure, it became impposible for any further consolidation to take place. However, the limit is NOT the number of carriers but the structure of the market. This should not be this hard for these wingnuts to understand: Take a ""for instance"": What if the FCC and DoJ had not allowed the two largest companies to acquire as much marketshare? What if DoJ and FCC had been doing their legislatively assigned jobs and had stopped the two BORG Empire ships from carving up more marketshare once they had reached the 50% level? And imagine that each held 25% share.Here is how that would work according to the HHI calculation:25x25 + 25x25 = 625 + 625 = 1250Now suppose the that T-Mo and Sprint held 17% and 11% as they approximately do now:17x17 + 11x11 + 289 + 111 = 400That considers that there is 12% marketshare made up of smaller operators, as it was before the BORG were allowed by DoJ to acquire them.Now let's see how the DoJ would view the merger of T-Mo and Sprint:The merger would create NewTM with 28% share as is the case with the current scenario. But since the lopsided market structure created by the BORG Empire Duopolists was kept lower the HHI would look much different:28 x 28 = 784Added to Fric and Frac’s market composition: 784 + 1250 = 2034 Added to the smaller players contribution which would be well less than 100Grand total of the HHI = 2034 + 100 = 2134 Since the threshold of the HHI is 2500, the DoJ and AG’s would have zero grounds to contest the merger on the grounds of it causing the market to be over concentrated. Economics for Dummies and the corrupt duopolist lovers:There is NO requirement for there being four carriers. The requirement is for a market, any market, to not become overly concentrated as that has proven to lead to fat pigs that pay out dividends to fat idle investors who head up Barron’s and other investment media rags. Get off it brain deads... show reasonable grace to compensate for blatant greed."
"The market is intuitive and forward thinking. The real competitive edge against Verizon and AT&T is the combined resources of T-Mobile and Sprint. That seems like what the market is saying now. Go back a few weeks and look at the charts regarding T-Mobile's share price the day that Sprint said they were pending talks with T-Mobile and starting talks with Comcast, etc. how did T-Mobile's share price react from that day forward? Bottom line? T-Mobile and Sprint need to find a way to merge."
"T-Mobile and Sprint build 5G networks will waste huge money, because T-Mobile and Sprint customers are low income people, they maybe doesn't have enough money to buy 5G wireless network, 5G wireless networks license are too expensive, SO I think T-Mobile and Sprint will return their 5G networks license to FCC, SO sell T-Mobile and Sprint, buy VZ and t."
T VZ TMUS Red. Dish green. Dish reports earnings before market open on Monday 2-22-21.
"Good idea, everything T-Mobile besides mobile phone service. Oh, wait; there isn't anything."
I think the biggest advantage for TMUS is to eliminate a low cost carrier. TMUS and S have been in a price war forever. Operating costs to go down and margins to go up. TMUS may not need S but is much better off with them.
"I have been posting that 5G has been hyped beyond what was the norm for prior generations of wireless. The level of hype for 5G is much greater than 3G and 4G because those gens had growth trends for broadband demand that could not be met by the prior generation. In some cases, including AT&T's deployments, 4G was needed to fix bogged-down networks and growing consumer dissaticfaction with the service. Sprint faced multiple problems of having used up low and mid band spectrum to transition to 4G but was forced on that road regardless of the disruption that led to shedding of about 10 million iDen and WiMAX subscribers. I have supported T-Mobile's resistence to over hyping 5G and waiting to announce the roll out. TMo has scheduled to roll out 5G early next year but sped that up to ahead of the trial date. That came as a surprise because lower priced devices and those that can work on both TMUS and S networks are limited.The reaction to the announcement has been overal negative. I think much of the criticism is unfair: the lack of devices, the fact that the bandwidth capacity is not a large improvement over 4G-Advanced have been known. While some of these media sources have criticized AT&T and Verizon for lack of devices and limited range of coverage, they have more often gone along with the hype about high bandwidth even while penetration into buildings makes that largely a mute point.What does the reaction to the 5G announcement show? That 5G is not nearly the same as 3G and 4G in terms of satisfying current market demands. 5G is much more a new platform environment that needs years of cross-fertilization before it takes root and grows lavishly. However, there is a greater impact of using low-band than achieving a large improvement in broadband capacity: the current generation of chips being used are unable to make fuller use of the technologies and wider span of spectra. The biggest impact on bandwidth will come from layering of mid-band and high-band spectra. The first step is to achieve wide area coverage. The following steps are to progressively layer networks with smallcells that have denser cell footprints and distributed server capabilities that is needed to fulfill the new platform approach to hybrid wired-wireless networks.I can't say whether the early announcement was a mistake because it may prove to ahve been helpful in the legal battle or to counter the hype from VZ and T."

"Regardless, the demand is here..."
TMUS almost zero sale growth now... PE of 23? and now buying money losing Spring for dilution?
"T-Mobile is the best positioned US operator to attain profitable growth over the next 1-6 years. That is mostly due to being in a good position in the spectrum that is open to exploitation by a good set of management and a team of employees. Management is often lifted up as the 'game changers'. While having management that is at the top of their game is a necessary requirement, they could do nothing if for the capable teams of employees under them... the guys and gals who do not get public recognition for putting together the solutions that drive T-Mobile to be competitive. Management is overrated. And that is being said by someone with a BSEE and MBA... I should be a prime cheerleader for the management mantra .. the media generation that thinks the CEO and other managers are responsible for all of the success and everyone else is simply followers. T-Mobile is a success because it has good managers and because those managers are supported by among the best teams of employees. They all benefit from having made the 'right decisions' on acquisitions of spectrum and other companies, and on a fair share of luck.I like T-Mobile. That is a bias/prejudice but it is based on the company doing what I had long thought made sense for this industry. I am prejudiced against Sprint for the same reason: the past management teams were brain deads who did not follow what made sense for the company's position within the evolution of industry technology until much too late.T-Mobile is just as fallible as any other company or person. Nobody should trust them to always make the best decisions... why should we... when we hardly trust ourselves to do so?"
Why are Sprint shareholders so dumb? You might think the public boards would have gained a common sense ability to take in the information available so that it stops the speculation that Sprint will merge with T-Mobile or Charter or some other thing will happen to force a premium valuation on the stock price.
"T-Mobile was downgraded as analysts figured that what companies have been saying was not the devils talking inside their heads... that Comcast had not been scheming in secret to acquire Sprint or T-Mobile and that what the company had said about taking advantage of the MVNO agreement with Verizon and their own WiFi HotSpots (Comcast claims 16 million of them) is what they will do.The obvious came home to roost: The easiest, lowest risk way for Comcast to offer a mobile service on which they can extend their OTT app access to video content subscriptions is to offer MVNO mobile portion rather than build their own network or acquire one of the smaller national operators. No Skin Off Their BackIf Comcast is successful up-selling their customers to use their mobile service, nothing prevents them from pushing into their own network other than device compatibility requirements. Nothing would prevent them from eventually acquiring T-Mobile or Sprint if the converged competitive landscape looks favorable down the road. A big advantage of going ahead, as Comcast's CEO has often indicated, with MVNO mobile is there is very little downside risk. Very important to the future should be the experience they gain in the mobile space. That can help if the company later decides to push into wireless infrastructure.Bot Sprint and T-Mobile have gone up in recent months as speculation of mergers taking place has helped fuel investment. TMUS looks less lofty than Sprint (S) IMO because it has positive trends in sales and profits. However, there may be limited upside for the near-term."
T-Mobile going to kill innovation within United States and prices will go up for consumers .The United States market is not the same has 5yrs ago. Just see the stock market. There’s tons inflammation within United States tons companies see it. DOJ and FCC has to block.

"The gating factors for the benefits of 5G are achieving widespread and low and mid-band coverage combined with mid to low range priced devices. The impact of using high-band spectrum depends a lot on what the advocate uses as the definition of the high band frequencies. That definition has progressively changed as chips and antennas phones and other devices has made using higher range frequencies more practical. Just a few years ago the high band was considered all frequencies above about 2.6 GHz. The frequencies under that were allocated for mobile use. The range shifted higher as ITU, 3GPP and other standards associations expanded the use to coincide with the ability of RF and modem chips and components to handle high frequencies using battery-powered devices. Today's T-Mobile PR shows maps depicting the coverage of TMo's 5G vs. that of Verizon. This is both informative and potentially misleading because the goals of the use of 5G are diverse and not as simply summed up in a coverage map. Yet this and similar maps clearly show that using 5G in high-frequency mmWave spectra provides confined area coverage. That raises the question of whether most customers can benefit from that type of 5G. Thus who work, live or attend outdoor events at mmWave locations can benefit if they have 5G capable phones that only about 3% of the US population now enjoy. Otherwise, those who are outside of the range or indoors most often will not benefit... so why pay to be a 'first adopter' of phones and premium service?On the other side of the picture is low-band 5G coverage. This can be misleading because it teases the understanding of what 5G delivers: while use in low-band improves coverage, bandwidth and latency, unless it is combined with wide-channel mid-band it only improves bandwidth by about 20% over 4G LTE-Advanced. That can be enough for consumers to use it for their primary video and broadband Internet service in some instances, however, in general that does not change the picture much from 4G. In either case of using 5G in either low-band or high-band alone does not live up to the 5G hype. To its credit, the PR partly makes that point. While touting the low-band coverage under the same banner of hyped up expectations of 5G, the PR goes on to say that the merger with Sprint is needed to provide what we should think of as the 'True 5G Experience'. In practical terms, all operators must deploy 5G across at least the mid and lower range of what is now considered part of the high-band (2.7-6 GHz) to reach a level of difference between current 4G and 5G to have significant impact on the user's experience and to generate the level of new applications and adoption momentum.While recent keynote speakers have intoned that 2020 will see 5G become widespread or that it has a bigger impact than 4G at a similar stage of introduction, the feet on the street impact still fails to show that. When 4G was introduced the demand for broadband use outstipped the supply. 4G coincided with availability of large amounts of low and mid-band spectra relative to what had been available. Therefor, the impact of 4G was more immediate and far reaching. 5G can have similar ground-up impact IF and when it is used across low-mid-high band spectra. That requires building the network and populating the customer base with devices capable of getting on board. 5G is also used for specialty type applications including autonomous vehicles, low-bandwidth IoT, and medical applications. But those are not immediately available or enabling of themselves. Those apps require their own ecosystems developments to take place and cannot merely be rolled out in a network and sold on store shelves."

"RCR has an article that talks about the early indications of pricing for 5G service. Verizon has two types of packages: The fixed location wireless broadband (WBB) service is priced at between $50 for existing customers and 70$ per month for new customers. The mobile service, which will have very limited coverage compared to 3G-4G will $10 over the current premium unlimited plan.T-Mobile's approach is different even though it will provide similar 5G eNB router boxes as Verizon's fixed wireless. The difference derives from the spectra each will use: T-Mobile will use 600 Mhz augmented by other bands including Sprint's 2.5 GHz band 41 when that is available. Verizon and AT&T are using mmWave spectra which is classed in the 5G definition for the high-band. Because T-Mo is using lower bands, it can penetrate buildings and coverage about 10x wider areas. That greatly lowers the cost for rural to suburban service because density can be built as revenue builds to support the spend.Each generation of wireless has increased capacity and lowered cost per bit. Usually, operators charge a premium for use of the new generation network in order to pay off the large capital expenditure. Then as competition increases, prices are able to be lowered while still making a profit because the initial CapEx has been paid down. If the merger goes through, T-Mobile will gain Sprint's additional customers to cover that cost while benefitting from cost synergies. The combined impact will be to lower the costs per bit and per unit of service (all the other costs of delivering the service and devices). John Legere, CEO and Mike Sievert COO said that the company will not charge a premium over the mobile service packages. That will effectively be from a $10 to $70 lower cost in additional the current price differential with Verizon. Of course, this is before T-Mobile's service has been launched and is subject to change.This makes sense because among the goals of 4G-Advanced and 5G is to bring down the cost while supporting a broader array of services, including economical home broadband and universal broadband or 'wireless broadband everywhere' using one 'network of networks' that uses a mix of low-mid-high band spectra that is built to suit the needs of the locality and market demands."

"The Department of Justice (DOJ) has rejected similar mergers in the past because of the impact they would have on prices, innovation and consumer choice. This Merger is no exception. In fact, it was T-Mobile’s desire to gain market share in 2013 that has led to a 19% reduction in wireless prices over the past five years. They brought innovation to the market, like getting rid of contracts and even introducing unlimited data plans.By merging, T-Mobile and Sprint will no longer have to compete – meaning there is less incentive for them to offer competitive prices and innovative services, and taking pressure off of AT&T and Verizon. This merger could also have a major impact on mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) like Ting and Google’s Project Fi. Sprint is a major wholesale network provider for MVNOs and this merger could lead to increased rates, which could affect retail prices, customer choice, and the viability of the MVNO business model."
5.5M Postpaid customers in 2020 under these conditions is crazy!! future 5G deployment and this should be over $250 by EOY
I find it very funny that the CEO of T-Mobile stay at the trump hotel and afterwards check out of the hotel after journals ask him personal question. Which result the next following day to check into a four season hotel at Georgetown. The signs are very clear. This man trying to play poniz game with the government. The FCC and DOJ need to block this merger more then ever. The evidence is ever clear. This man will lay-off thousands of American people.

"T-Mobile had pushed through resistance and then has moved sideways. Is the stock likely to move higher or stay within this range or even head lower?I think TMUS will at least hold the current range and has a fair chance to move higher. That move will depend on easing of fears that the company is running out of headroom for growth against leading competitors Verizon and AT&T. Thus far, TMUS has confounded critics and financial analysts alike who thought growth would have started to sputter by now due to exhaustion of the easy to sway 'young and restless' segment of the market. T-Mobile has continued to innovate and capture the zeit gest of the maturing US market that, naturally, yearns for more for less. The stock price is not cheap... until you compare it to some alternatives like Sprint (S). Growth is almost always rewarded by the market with an expanded multiple. Thus, if T-Mobile is able to turn in another good quarter and give guidance that more of the same level of growth is to be expected, then, IMO, TMUS is set to move up to a higher price level by the end of this year (2016)"

"I believe the other telecoms, T and VZ are reporting weak numbers because T-Mobile is eating their lunch. We will see the new subscriber numbers next week and I'm sure they'll be record high."
"Where is that icon TeamRep for input here?Only those around before the merger know what I mean. The analysis was both good and bad, but it had substance, unlike R. In 30 to 60 days or less, everyone will say ""I wish I bought that day..."""
"TMUS, S, and SFTBY have sold off to a level at which they become targets for short-term and trend trading buys.As always, use the tools the pros use or invest in mutual funds. There is no room in the market for lazy pedestrians."
what impact will the rights expiration have on the price.?
"T-Mobile's majority owner, Deutsche Telekom, is in no mood to sell off their stake unless for a double in the stock price according to a recent statement: ""The company scrapped plans to merge T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS.O) with Sprint (S.N) in November, but Deutsche Telekom was ""not dogmatic about the subject"", he added (DT's CEO) ""If someone were to come now and offered, say, $120 a share, all cash, then we would have to think about it,"" he said."""
Regardless what happens to the deal t mobile will fall...not worth to buy S shares...its $5.50s even If deal pass most you get anything under $5.66 maybe even $3 or u see again it depends how much t mobile shares drop by that time....I think most likely this deal gonna be rejected because it has no good and no one will benefit but Tmobile and Softbank ....of this deal fail mostly Softbank will let sprint go bk...they are not doing well as we can all see $15 per month unlimited everything still not selling due to bad service . theres only t mobile and sprint that competitive all other don't compete or care ....so you take these 2 then good luck consumers....bad bad bad...every 2 company that merged they cut and layoff people as they save money managing 2 companies in one...history to prove not their lies to pass the deal...and remember that Regulators stop Att T mobile merger and att had to pay billions in break up fees? now imagine if this deal pass what att will do to regulators and tmobile/ sprint ? they will sue them and get that money 10x or more...how much problems would that already cause ? think think and think
"A major fallacy: That 5G is going to be a 'Race'.5G is more an evolution than a revolution in technologies. ""Wireless network technology"" today is more like a smorgasbord menu to select from than a single recipe. Unlike the past generations of wireless, 5G, including 5G NR, New Radio, is going to roll out as an extension of 4G rather than as a replacement. If you ask the question ""What new markets does 5G create or expose and when will they happen?"", the answer is that all of the 5G markets are already here in 4G. IoT? Here. Cable replacement? Here. TV/Media over wireless? Here. Mobile payments and other financial services? Here. If you look hard, you will find some new applications. However, 99.8% of them may be considered 'new' only because they work better using 5G than 3G or 4G.The issue is no longer a matter of when can a new generation of the network be rolled out.The opportunity of 5G is that it improves network efficiency and provides more ways to leverage the network going forward. That means that there is not a 'grand opening' of 5G in which the market will open up and customers will rush in.Take, for example, Verizon's plan to roll out 5G fixed wireless using 3.5 GHz and mmWave: The plan has been criticized as not being 'true 5G' because it is a subset application of the mainstream '5G Mobile' experience. However, this is useful to understanding the role that 5G will take. While VZ starts with 'fixed wireless broadband', everyone knows that when devices are available to use the 3.5 GHz band or as routers down-convert the signal to WiFi or a lower frequency 4G-5G band that phones and other devices support, that the distinction as a 'fixed' deployment vanishes. Verizon's approach will turn out, in a few years, to be just another way to layer higher frequency bands into the overall 5G network. The takeaway is that the approach is being taken because there is a market opportunity Verizon is pursuing, ie. the cable replacement market, and that deploying 'fixed WBB' is the way that the company thinks is feasible. What Verizon nor those who criticise the approach have failed to come up with is a 'Grand Opening' approach that will launch 5G into the market. 5G comes into the market at a point when 3G-4G have already opened the market. When Verizon launched 4G-LTE they did so using what was then a ground-breaking amount of low-band 700 Mhz spectrum. That had the impact of opening up a market experience that, although mounted on the shoulders of 3G, was closer to a 'Grand Opening' launch. 5G will not have a Grand Opening... all the PR statement and media articles that tout that will be a bunch of marketing department and media maggot BS."
oh wow im out

Get ready to say OH NO Down TMUS goes because they are losing customers to T and it shows in T's earnings report
"OPPO.OnePlus phones has been a line that has been working upstream in the competition. OPPO started out making Google Android clones a few years ago. While fair mid-price phones were included in the line, they had nothing that came even close to the flagship devices from Samsung or Apple. Other suppliers such as Huawei fit in the same low-mid end of the smartphone market. The 'Chinese Android clone' device suppliers mostly sold in Asia and India, the African continent and value seekers in other parts of the world. Because those markets represent about 2/3rds of the world's population, the volumes have been greater than for Apple and Samsung. That has led to more use of leading-edge components including the latest cameras, usually from Japanese suppliers, phone modem processors from Qualcomm, and the corresponding graphics processors, usually from Qualcomm but sometimes using other sources for software. The top of the line devices from Huawei, for example, are much closer to the newest Samsung and Apple devices. In some aspects/features, the upstarts have bested their rivals. What differentiates the OnePlus is use of the fastest Qualcomm chips plus near the top cameras, and most significantly, good refinement of the Google Android operating system including use of gestures that really work (according to multiple reviews). I have personally used phones with the gesture recognition and soon stopped using the feature because it never seemed to work well across apps. The OnePlus 6T looks like a grat phone.. yet there are aspects of it I don't like: I have come to use wireless charging: just plog the phone into the cradle that is left plugged into a 2A+ USB Q1 (quick charge version) charging stand and the phone seems to charge faster than when plugged in directly to the USB charger. Or maybe it is just easier so that the charge tends to stay topped-off. Anyway, it sits there waiting to grab and use or run out the door with. The OnePlus has rapid charging but that requires plugging in the mechanical connector - no matter how good USB is fashioned into a device hard-wired connections tend to be a common point of failure for battery operated devices. The other thing is the glass case: many people want what looks the coolest and feels good in the hand. I can think of other things that feel good in the hand but I don't need a phone for that. Many reports of the back cracking on 2-3 foot drops is not what I like to hear.. but then it may make for more sales if that is the game ya want to play. Getting a new device from a leading Chinese supplier is a good move. It has a small cult following that fits the Zeit Geist of T-Mobile but probably won't challenge the current flagship devices soon."
"What will be the initial and 1-3 year impacts of the New T-Mobile merger?New T-Mobile and Sprint have an existing roaming agreement which Sprint's CFO said they have shifted as much roaming traffic as is practical and that has resulted in some operating savings. The participation of the two in the Google Fi multiple-operator network has provided experience in making their networks and a few devices work together. They also have been working on building harmonious networks upgrades and expansions and in re-structuring of their spectrum allocations that will make for an easier, quicker and more efficient transition. All together, they should be in a good position to reap operational savings and better performance and user experience from the combining of the networks and operations. But what do they do with that? John Legere has sworn that they won't raise prices and other statements and analysis indicate TMUS can and will be motivated to lower prices where it can be used to gain marketshare.New T-Mobile will be in a position to deliver the US's first mobile 5G network across much of the country starting in the 2nd half of this year. A few devices have been announced but plans are vague phones that will work on both networks using compatible 4G-Advanced and 5G. Also, there is not much known about plans for low and mid-priced devices. In order to have a similar impact as 4G during the first year or two, there has to be mobile devices that a good swatch of the 90% of people 'under the bell curve' of market demand can afford. Otherwise, the campaign would be just like those of Verizon, AT&T or Sprint if it were not merged.I suspect that there will be multiple devices that will work on the combination of 600 MHz and 2.5 GHz bands that will meet the low-mid price levels. If the number and pricing is enough to beat out Verizon and AT&T, then the broader range of 600MHz and 2.5 GHz coverage will be a significant competitive advantage over the Duopolists.In one way, it is good that the merger is not likely to be decided sooner than now appears likely: for maximum impact, New T-Mobile needs to have both the network coverage combination and the availability of mobile phones. If so, then the marketing blitz will ring true and stand out against the competition. If not, then T-Mobile would look more like one of the hated Carriers instead of the 'Un-Carrier'.Apple 5G iPhone had been delayed until a likely release in early 2020. A March 1 Forbes article points out that Apple has had some technical and legal difficulties: It is engaged in a patent lawsuit with Qualcomm while Intel won't enter the market in time for an earlier launch and internal design efforts have reportedly run into snags. Forbes echoes device analysts:""Consumers Turning Away From Expensive iPhones Apple’s current generation of handsets are priced at premium levels and they have not been well received. While there are other circumstances, the broad sweep of selling more phones at a higher price has not been a successful strategy. Apple’s COO Jeff Williams acknowledged that the company is aware of issues around the high price of the latest iPhones this week and while he didn’t offer any salve to consumers wallets, the issue has now been publicly acknowledged"". Consumers have been turning away from the highest-priced models of Samsung, Apple, because they tend to be the highest priced and competitors, have closed the gap in features and quality... and in some cases surpassed them. Apple and Samsung have retained the worldwide lead despite increased competition partly because the majority of consumers are not being peeled away by the competitor's leading-edge devices. The trend has been for people to hold onto their phones longer and buy devices after the 'bleeding edge' introduction period. That is helped by the price of the 12-18+ month older models often being sold at half the price of the newest models. Thus far, that appears to be the case for 5G phones and other devices... and that gets back to there being zero '5G killer apps' out there to drive consumers to pay twice the price.The '5G killer app' that T-Mobile can deliver over the next several quarters after launch will be a cable-replacement level of bandwidth and the supporting core network capacity. That will most likely take the form of a continuation of OTT replacement with 'more for less' rolled into the package including T-Mo's own media-made-easy consolidated service. The marketing can be simple, ""Why pay for cable when you no longer need it? Come over to New T-Mobile's 'all in there' plan: No bait and switch price rises. All taxes and fees included. Netflix on Us. Media Made Simple on Us. T-Mobile delivers the fully mobile 5G coverage experience Verizon and AT&T cannot come close. Sign up for the family plan and receive the latest LG XXX or Samsung XXX special addition 5G phone for half price."""
"tmobile must be hung for money. worst customer service ever, I switched to consumer cellular. selling all of my shares while they're up today."
After softbank sales an enormous % of tmobile shares; how does the tmobile price react??
How far can this stock go- into and past the 199 Mark is that being overwhelmingly optimistic-?
"AGs have no factual evidence to back their statement, meaning the verdict is ready. New T mobile is here"
"I don't even have to try and make stuff up when it's all so true LOL,LOL,LOL Sell any moves higher in all your stock and just let the CRASH happen , because it will be a lot less painful than down down down down down for a decade LOL,LOL,LOL Even a Blind man can see the carnage , Slaughter , bloodbath , destruction that is now coming to the stock markets LOL,LOL,LOL"
Up a buck and a half...Great way to end 2020! What a year for Sprint and Tmobile...Happy New Year to the entire TMUS team and shareholders! Looking forward to the continued strong momentum in 2021!
Tmus will not going any where between $12.00 to $14....up &down ....bankruptcy...
TMUS has become a must...
Earnings date?
"I have T Mobile and it's slow. And after couple months on my bill I noticed a bunch of small ""fees"" i didn't see before for services I didn't ask for."
"Tmobile not reliable ..... but hey, you get what you pay for LOL"
I would not do any business with TMUS if you want you data to be safe. TMUS is a foreign run company by the EU to collect data on the USA and use it against the USA to farther the EU's one world order Agenda
"The real facts of why T Mobile is falling they are a foreign company, They don't pay a dividend , They are now losing customers to T's new unlimited plans with FREE HBO MAX and T Mobile was way over priced FACT over hyped and over priced"
Tmobile does not need this Mega Deal of Debt.
"One aspect of the sie deal with Dish is that this takes Dish's spectrum off of the market for Verizon to buy. Analysts have long questioned whether VZ needed to gain additional mid-band to efficiently deploy 4G-Advanced-5G networks. It might also use more low-band but the company has not expressed much of a desire to do so. I've often said that VZ was the best candidate to buy Dish's spectrum but that the FED would be much less likely to allow the company to buy Dish. Considering that the side-deal was needed to gain approval and that it keeps the spectrum out of Verizon's hands, the positives start adding up to more than some may have thought."
Crushed it
"There is much confusion about how the merger of TMo and S would impact consumer and the industry. The merger comes at a juncture in the development of the IT and communications industry, which has become one in the same thing despite being dominated by market segments and different capitalized groups of companies and their suppliers. They all serve an increasingly common market. That changes what the impact would be and how DOJ and FCC should consider the merger. This is not an issue that is likely to be as straightforward as most merger in which the merging companies present their plans which are either accepted or rejected with minor concessions if accepted, required by the FCC on behalf of the DOJ. This is much different than the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T. The consumer groups are troglobites: they have a misguided understanding of the issues imo. That is because they lack an understanding of there the technology and industry segments are heading so that they jump to conclussions that the deal would be bad for consumers. The problem is that it could be bad for consumers... if the FCC and DOJ fail to require the type of structural reforms and some concessions, such as continuation of budget plans for the low-end of the market.The main thing that the FCC and DOJ should be striving for is something that T-Mobile probably does not necessarily want as their first choice outcome: require the idiots to provide '1st mile' network access by offering deals to cable companies that enable them to use their essential cable and fiber optic infrastructure in partnership with New T-Mobile. John Legere has said that he does not see that as being good for mobile operators, screw it, DOJ/FCC should require it for approval, period."
"Last week a HR rep at Sprint. He ensured that the jobs in OP are safe. The bulk of layoffs will come from the T-Mobile side as their salaries are 30-40% higher than Sprint employees. The brand may be T-Mobile, but the corporate culture and compensation will be strongly influenced by Sprint.I believe the new CEO had said the same thing at one of the roadshows"
"Earnings are up:Total revenues of $17.7 billion and service revenues of $13.2 billion• Net income(1) of $110 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.09• Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $7.0 billion• Net cash provided by operating activities of $777 million• Free Cash Flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps(1) related to mergerfinancing of $1.4 billion"
Somebody splain this $h#^.
what will happen to T Mo without Sprints Spectrum? no need for Sprint but huge need for Spectrum .
"Would not be surprised if this deal doesn’t happen albeit it probably will , who is dish’s financial partner ? This needs to be known before the deal closes . Any guesses?"
"So much for a piece of the uncarrier. I got an email telling me that the 1 share they gave me is going to a new broker come May 22nd, and 'by the way' you will be charged $5 a month to use this new broker. I sold my share as soon as I got that email. It was a cool idea but now it seems like a money grab, hoping people won't respond and then suddenly get a bill for the new broker. hmmmm...."
"They wanted low pices for consumers and they got it all 3 same pricing with AT&T matching their free Netflix offer with HBO for life and DirecTV Now for only $10. month,those margings are gonna get squeezed by all those Netflix subs their paying for,strong sell as Tmobile has already peaked and without Sprint merger left without much needed spectrum for 5G rollout and hardly any free cash flow compared to Verizon and AT&T,I sees trouble ahead for Legree!"
Apple drop after hours is a yawn...everybody was waiting for the NEW 5G iphones!
"Sprint says they won't charge higher prices after the merger, but for 5G they will force consumers to get the most expensive tier of their unlimited plan. Currently there are 3 tiers, Basic, plus and premium. Premium being $10 higher than Plus, and Plus being $10 higher than Basic Unlimited. If you buy a 5G phone today, you have to get the Premium unlimited plan."
Democrats have said no to this MegaMerger Game Over!!! No MegaBonus now
"The bear market impacts interest rates to move lower. This sharp and deep of a downturn is sharper than past recessions and was quickly countered by the coordinated efforts of world banks to provide extraordinary funding to patch up the holes to keep the international economy afloat. What will be the overall impacts? Will the downturn harm New T-Mobile more than competitors? Does it lead to drying up of the bond market funding? Or will the expectation for gaining market share in a stirred up market mean New T-Mobile will look less risky, thus resulting in lower interest rates for debt and higher stocks prices? There are both positive and negative impacts of recessions - the winners and losers. Some companies and more efficient was to deliver goods and services gain on competitors as consumers become frugal and seek more fulfilling alternatives. The turmoil can shake up the market psychology because it derails the comfort implied by sticking with the current purchase habits. Stock markets often retreat towards safety during recessions. However, when the turmoil brings the consensus opinions about the direction of the economy and markets, that can cause a reshuffling of market priorities that favors growth. Growth in topline sales and profits is the golden rule of market logic - if a company can grow relative to competitors and the broad market, that dispels fears in a blanket fashion. New T-Mobile is in a good position relative to competitors in the MVNO/ICT field. The coronavirus shakes up fundamental understands of how reliable (risk vs reward) and stable business and investing will go forward. I have more questions than answers on this. That’s a starting point."
There is only upside to TMUS 5G supremacy. Spectrum is the most important asset in this biz and TMUS is way too ahead of competition. The cost of rearranging Sprint Spectrum is nothing compare to profit and cost cuts TMUS will have for next 10 years!!

"Yes ,listen to Legere rip btig analyst on C.C. pretty good stuff . Merger should happen , California should sign on . merger makes so much sense . Trump love s it"
Just blew past the AT high. does this stock go up or down if merger gets approved??
"5G means wait and hold, don’t get impatient with this one, next year will be monumental!"
"While the approval decision by the FED awaits, the DoJ Antitrust Division (ATR) has reached out to the state AG's to gain their support for the merger. That is likely to increase the odds the lawsuit will be dropped or the odds are significantly increased in favor of the defense, NewTM et al."
Why did T-Mobile go down?
TMUS is winning the 5g race! We will see some big moves over the next couple of weeks. At&t and Verizon are late to the party.
Nice Volume..... Should bring a Close of $124 PLUS!!!
"Just one piece of GOOD NEWS will bring this back to $130 plus.The ""Buffet News"" is certainly good, but goes without much conviction as CNBC is only interested in the ""NEW Positions"" and Buffet already has had a substantial position in TMUS and now more than doubled it. I believe the ""Buffet Team"" sees this heading to $150 as other analysts do.... in the NEAR FUTURE! Suggest to hold and one day you will see a HUGE POP!!!! as its becoming a coiled SPRING!"
How much will T Mo drop after S shares exchanged or maybe even before drops? I say big drops in T Mo coming soon ;)
Will T-Mobile talk about consolidation plans? Will sprint be mentioned?

This definitely took a hit!! WTH..!!
Looks like it's about to end finally. Tomorrow this puppy is about to fly.
"For the Spetrum, VZ has to come with huge money, their stock is down, TMUS must be in with the billions, the auction is 4 fold over expectations, rumors must be out. I suspect the extra that is paid for spectrum is the reason for the price decline. We will see soon enough. The more it costs, the more we pay as users, the govt screws us all. The money goes to the treasury. What a scam if you were not aware."
An more higher is only a chance to sell more before the US Government stops TMUS from collecting data on Americans
"Everyone is forgetting, masa can now dictate terms , he can even buy T-Mobile or wait till charter , dish , Amazon , Google or even Verizon comes a calling"
Next leg down gonna be painful to watch!
"T-Mobile can get to 5G without acquiring Sprint. However, the merger would help TMo to fight with Verizon and AT&T to build a business case for extending wireless broadband to the multi-billion dollar fiber-cable replacement market.Sprint's stock price has moved lower, now around $7. It may head lower still. What appears to be shaping up is that S's parent company, Softbank, is setting channeling Sprint's network assets to a LendLease, an Australian 'tower company'. LendLease will manage about 8,000 tower and building roof sites. This arrangement has the advantage of lower costs because base station sites can be leased out to multiple operators with a site and network management being performed by the leasing company. Softbank is making an investment in LendLease which can increase the parent company's ROI. CEO/COB Masa Son has been preparing Softbank investors for the merging of Sprint at a lower ratio than has been represented in the stock price relative to TMUS. Recently Masa said that Sprint has returned about 41% to SB shareholders. That came from the business that runs through SB's other companies including Brightstar."
At&t is dropping customers like crazy.
I said it before Split the stock Time for the retail investors to buy TMUS
TMUS is up 4.90% to 83.66
The reason T Mobile is dropping has nothing to do with shorts and all to do with T Mobile is a foreign company founded by the EU's one world order to collect data on the USA and use it against America to farther the EU's one world order. Up to you whether you wan to support a Foreign company of not and the collecting of data on America for their own agenda. I only support American companies I can trust. FACT
MO. There is a lot of wheeling and dealing going on in the back room of both S and TMUS.
PVHO could be the biggest growth opportunity of the year. I know this post looks like junk but do your own research. PVHO already has over 1M in revenue + major contracts with national brands. Intel even got behind this one. Do your research before it’s too late.
Apple hits a new 52 week high today and now has a market cap almost twice that of $T $VZ $S and $TMUS combined.
"This company has nothing other than going up by taking more market share. Bigger the pie, more profitable the wireless business is."
"Why and how can Verizon offer unlimited data plans?The why is that the market has matured and become saturated so that there are few people in the USA who do not already have mobile phone service. The push in recent years is the expansion of mobile data to computer-video supplanting SmartPhones. But that is maturing such that all major operators offer most of the same devices and user experience. During the past three years T-Mobile and, in its 'lumpy gravy' fashion, Sprint have increased coverage to be able to compete on an equal basis. The junkyard dogs have, however, been required to distinguish themselves as providing more bang for the buck in ways that please the market. They have also pitted themselves against the 'BORG Empire' carriers as a cliche metaphor of the underdog.Verizon has, in the past, resisted unlimited plans because they thought service should fit the bell curve of supply vs. demand: the average SmartPhone service customer consumes about 5.4 GB of data per month. A 5GB plan satisfies maybe 95% of the market and the overages among those who splurge on (just) one movie over their allotment are lucrative. There is a natural-selection process that is supposed to occur in a tiered-price plan market. That top-down market approach is, however, exactly the type of vulnerability that T-Mobile has effectively exploited - the 'pain points' from the bottom-up view of customers.The why Verizon has swung back to offering unlimited data is because the market has matured, saturated and become more competitively targeted at users. You know what? That is how free enterprise is supposed to work according to pointy-head academicians but sometimes get lost in the luster of Fith Avenue marketing.The other side of the supply vs. demand equation is the supply of bandwidth has sufficiently been increased so that unlimited plans can be pushed out into the market without detriment to the customer experience. Verizon is the consumer market leader. It has a reputation of anticipating demand in time to build out capacity to meet it before bottlenecks occur. VZ has avoided more of the demand side problems of bogged down networks, outages etc. experienced by AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. To meet growth in bandwidth demand, all operators have acquired more spectrum and made use of 4G and 5G network and device technologies. Verizon has increased network density and made use of more mid-band spectrum to build for demand growth to the point they can now support unlimited plans forced by competitive pressures without adverse impact on the customer experience.The why is to fend off competitors erosion of marketshare. The how is by first providing fatter pipe networks."
This is a $150-$200 stock in a year
Fri 2-5-21 TMUS closed at $125.28.What will it close at on Fri 2-12-21: 2-19-212-26-213-5-213-12-213-19-21.......
"Welp, VZ disappointed. T reporting tomorrow. AAPL reporting tomorrow. TMUS continues to head north."
"#TMUST-Mobile (TMUS) beat on earnings at 67c. This is ahead of the high-end forecast by financial analysts according to Zacks: earnings consensus was 34c with the high estimate of 54c. We have to see if there were any one-time or other adjustments that brought the number up for the quarter. TM did raise pricing on unlimited plans which may have some impact in the quarter... but could not account for the bulk of it.From the early release, TMUS did better than I had expected... showing better top line sales as well as earnings."
Walt Piecyk Twitter feed today. There are no Republican State AG's in the group that is suing to block the Sprint/T-Mobile deal. $S $TMUS $DISH
A lot of scared shorts on here. Their gonna get burned.
Caching!: Braxton Carter: Starting to have a conversation about a small dividend and stock buy-backs.
If you didn’t sell some or all at 65 really ?
Has the potential to be a $300 stock in 3-5 years.
ULTIMATSTOKCALERTS is great with their stock suggestions. Google them .
"Say OH NO down TMUS goes LOL,LOL,LOL Why because you now only sell any move higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
TMUS reached a 52 Week high at 79.88
10% of those surveyed will switch carriers in the next few months. This helps the share takers $TMUS $S & hurts share losers $T $VZ
Who's selling. Small volume.
Heard of ULTIMETESTCKALERTS ? They have been killing it and just send me a huge winner .
Why is this down? Earnings were great
"The merger agreement values Sprint at 0.10256 per T-Mobile share, so $S should get up to $9 min based on $TMUS pre-market price."
CNBC always negative ! Now we don’t need 5 g ! See me in a year and we will see ! Len you still have not unveil your short position lol
"I feel life stock price will continue to go up regardless of the sprint merger outcome. Possibly a slight set back in the short term, but overall profitable long term."
Team rep you dont know CTL has every tower connected to every data center with conduits with fiber not just cables. They have so much of what TMUS needs You cant backhaul 5G wirelessly. VZ and ATT don't have the Fiber CTL has.
"Craig Moffett is crazz crazz.Anyone who thinks that building a 4th carrier from a satellite company with Spectrum (DISH), a cable company, an Internet service or eCommerce company (Amazon, Google, Facebook) fails to understand the basics of the costs, time, amount of building of networks, etc. that are required to compete. These Big Companies did not get so big by throwing money away. On the other hand, Amazon sells many services that might be sold on top of an MVNO mobile and 5G home broadband service that could result in benefits. The benefit is leveraging off the brand name and a well organized, synergistic package of products and services. I have argued against these companies acquiring T-Mobile or Sprint and that has not changed. However, acquiring Boost Mobile would not be a commitment to spend several tens of billions of dollars on top of the ~$3 billion acquisition price tag. That would be crazy.The wireless services arena is going to be very competitive. Included in wireless services will be a large growth in wireless cloud broadband services and low-latency capabilities that must be built out as an end-to-end network comprised of both wired/server farm and wireless broadband connectivity. Does Amazon, Google, Facebook NEED to acquire Boost or get into the infrastructure business themselves? They do not have to do that. However, if they can put together a set of commitments from NewTM that allows the acquisition to be used to market a package of 'first to market' capabilities, then, Craig Moffett is Crazy... it can make sense. Part of the sense of this starts with the low cost, only about $3 billion, and then goes to using that as a way to distinguish the brand for consumer and enterprise-class cloud services. There is a basic problem in trying to make sense of the reports that Amazon is interested in acquiring Boost because we do not know what the deal would include. Wireless and cloud services and devices to some extent could benefit the 'all Amazon' and advertising aimed at ""nobody has this except Amazon"" brand imaging.The MVNO part of that would 'just go bump in the night'... Amazon would not need to invest heavily or try to change the way that works. The enhanced services, such as ultra-low latency gaming, conferencing, face-time applications that could be both offered to the public and offered to developers and businesses would help Amazon compete across the board as a leader in (the much hyped) 5G arena."

"The market loved the court decision, TMUS was up almost 20%. There will not be any price renegotiation, TMUS can't afford to walk away from the deal."
"TMUS is an evil company. 6,000 layoffs when they claimed their merger was job positive. They will fall apart internally. As of 12/22 they began poaching pre-paid customers from Metro to come to TMUS... they are the same company. Metro Dealer commissions have been slashed dramatically over the past year. If you don’t believe me look up “Dealers Lives Matter” - there are hundreds of individuals dealers and employees fighting TMUS. Jon Frier has even threatened legal action against his own dealers as recently as December"
"Some investor's reaction to Sprint's recent quarterly report was that the reported earnings caused almost entirely by a tax accounting gain would propel Sprint higher. The $7B+ gain was from how tax deferrals are accounted. (see latest 10Q). As Sprint states, this is not a cash-flow item. In other words, Sprint cannot directly spend that money from the accounting gain.Competitors that are making profits and can take advantage of the tax rate reduction can see an impact on their cash-flow. The tax benefits are more complex than the understanding of the change in the corporate rate because companies have various deductions, such as depreciation of assets so that the full reduction is not experienced. Potentially, a tax rate reduction might help the marginally profitable company more than the highly profitable because the leaner competitor can leverage the gains. However, if there are few profits and a lot of tax-loss carryforwards and other ways to reduce or eliminate taxes already, the benefit may be less. Competitors might, for example, use the tax reduction to pay out a dividend or to cut prices. The former might spur a higher price for the stock while the latter might spur an increase in marketshare which, in turn, encourages the stock price to rise. The mobile wireless industry has been, by and large, highly profitable. The tax cut may tend to help T-Mobile out more than its competitors. My thinking is that although TMUS is currently profitable, it has more recently joined the ranks with competitors Verizon and AT&T. Having a bigger TAM to pursue as the smaller company, T-Mobile is likely in the position and has the long-term objectives of pursuing marketshare. Verizon and AT&T are like the BORG Empire - they can attempt to assimilate everything in their path, but the impact on their business is less (having more means less). The challenge T-Mobile faces from having an additional lowering of costs is finding additional markets that can net the degree of growth the company and its investors have grown accustomed. That would be the case with or without the tax cut."
"If you don’t understand how to access and read T-Mobiles SEC filings, you probably shouldn’t be owning TMUS securities."
"The acquisition of Sprint looks more likely to happen this go around. Sprint-Softbank need to merge. Despite having finally adopted a deployment strategy that includes end-point LTE Home eNodeB network nodes that reduce costs and improve the performance, particularly for higher-band spectra, Sprint lacks capital to stay competitive as wireless enters the gigabit broadband era. There is a lot more to it; an auction for '5G spectrum' is planned to take place in November (may be delayed). The MNOs must have a competitive amount of low, mid and high-band spectra to efficiently compete long term. While Sprint has long touted their Band 41 spectrum as an advantage, it is not enough as competitors can be expected to amass several hundred MHz of aggregate high-band including mmWave spectra. Some of that will be shared access or licensed light. But the majority will require licenses acquired at the FCC auction or in the aftermarket.T-Mobile's Legere and Neville Ray have lashed out at AT&T and Verizon's plans to provide #Fake5G/Fixed 5G as not focusing on mobile customers. The reason why they can do that is T-Mo has enough 600 MHz combined 700 MHz and with mid-band and some mmWave (200 MHz that covers 100 million of the population). The discussions of MNOs 5G plans are complex because they aren't endpoint strategies. However, due to the combination of spectra with 4G-5G technologies, chip and device availability, and the subscriber density T-Mobile needs to satisfy, the company should be able to roll out 5G as a nationwide deployment. That plan could and probably will be criticized as not having the capability of delivering the 'Gigabit wireless' needed to compete for home broadband. However, that is not where the majority of market demand is plotted to be over the next few years. And it is not what any US operator can supply as a nationwide roll out. Therefore, the 'neiner, neiner, neiner, my daddy is bigger than your daddy' cat calling by T-Mobile makes good sense given their technical prowess, spectrum portfolio, capital position, and run-up of market segments. On the other hand, it is not quite legitimate to intone that '5G Mobile' has to be done in a nationwide rollout to mobile devices. 5G is a grab-bag rollup of 3G-4G deployments and markets. It has both general mobile market application and focused market applications including IoT, transportation, medical and enterprise markets that have overlapping but distinct requirements. Some of those requirements can be more a virtualized/contained set of services combined with the clients in-house and partnered networks and IT/cloud services. Given T-Mobile's position, their approach and messaging make good sense. And that will be important going forward because it is simpler to explain to the public and rhimes well with the overall marketing theme."

"When will 5G have an impact on mobile operators and how much will it change the competitive landscape? Will 5G cause mobile operators sales to grow or will it usher in more competition that fights over a ' fake bigger pie'? Does 5G cause a 'true convergence' between wired and wireless services that, although the 'pie' grows larger due to market convergence, the competition from multiple directions, (ie. cable-to-wireless, wireless-to-home broadband, wireless-to-media convergence, wireless BB-to-IT services), the competition drives down pricing that stamps out gains that might be expected from 'value creation'?There is no doubt that the confluence of 5G technology combined with several times more spectrum than available during past decades will cause a flourishing of 'value creation'. There is also no doubt that markets will overlap more directly, offering consumers much needed alternatives that have the impact of providing 'more for less' or, ""Moore, Cooper, Alamouti's Law of Wireless"" - that the capacity of wireless at least doubles every 12-18 months while the cost remains the same or lower. It also leads to the assumption that more capabilities can be packed into wireless services as the capacity reaches more useful levels, for example, cable-replacement and adaptive IT services."

"Most often stocks move up ahead of earnings reports being released. Since TMUS and S have been flattish, the better than expected reports from the two, particularly T-Mobile, and the favorable financial analyst reviews since, has led to a rise in the stock post-report. The two still trade within a range that is lower than before the deal was announced and significantly lower than the merger-talk period highs of a year ago from last February. What sums it up is that the market hates uncertainty. Even though the earnings reports, rolling out of 600 Mhz, some encouragement from Sprint's use of Massive MIMO and Home eNodeB smallcells, and other factors that work in favor of the two companies as either stand-alone or as merged, and several other indications that further growth and financial improvement is likely, the stock market seems predisposed to wait for the end to the wait and see decision from the FEDs."
Is TMUS/S market cap worth $125B strictly wireless business? VZ and T are about $100B more market cap and they have $100B long term debt and TMUS/S have $60B. Seems the valuation of this is more than VZ and T? Why?
"A New York Post article this week says that DOJ Antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has negative views on John Legere/New T-Mobile's price containment commitments. The DOJ Chairman and staffers have said that they want to see the structural type of changes in the wireless industry rather than 'behavioral remedies'. As I have often pointed out, many of the behavioral remedies that the FCC has imposed on device commonality, rural coverage, number portability, co-use of spectra, etc. became drawn out or never acted upon. That is because the FCC lacks effective follow-up and operators find it more profitable or strategically advantageous to flaunt the rules. The best way to resolve many issues is to require that a structure of commercial agreements be put in place that evens out the competitive playing field. That allows the marketplace to impose its 'invisible hand' to cause market players to conform because that is in their best interest to do so. The problem DOJ has is that despite good arguments that New T-Mobile will be motivated due to market opportunities they need to expand into in order to become a better rounded diversified service operator and the excess capacity the merge of networks and spectra will create, the long-term picture is far from certain. This dovetails back to what I said when the talks had begun: That New T-Mobile should be required to continue and extend the joint network and MVNO relationships with the hybrid fiber-cable companies and with satellite companies (DISH). That would help ensure that the emergence of the fourth leg of the competitive stool will be filled by these competitors entering the universal solvent field of wireless everywhere competition. I had suggested that T-Mobile put this out as part of their merger proposal. That went up against John Legere's repeated voicing of an opinion that such move would be counter to the company's interests: John Legere told investors and analysts in April of 2017 that he did not agree with Verizon's MVNO deals or Sprint's push to do joint venture development of 4G-A/5G networks with the cable companies, ""why would we enable out competitors?"". Legere also slammed the cable companies wireless efforts during that period prior to the merger proposal. These and other statements have come back to add support that the merger cannot depend on T-Mobile's claims that new competition from these companies is creating a fourth (or 4th-7th) major competitor in the converged space.T-Mobile Should have Anticipated This Backlash to Mere Promises of behavioral remedies to the structural dilemma.The fix has always been for New T-Mobile to 'embrace and extend' the type of structural changes that DOJ (and many others like myself) have long sought.The solution looks simple: New T-Mobile should offer to extend the 'first mile 5G' joint network development agreements that Sprint has engaged with Altice and Cox to include all fiber optic and cable (or hybrid fiber-cable), satellite and MVNO operators.Why would T-Mobile agree to enablement of more competition? Because that is what they advocate the DOJ should take for granted will happen even though John Legere had scoffed at cablecos or DISH being effective competitors until such time it was prudent to do a flip-flop. That is just too funky."

T Mobile was founded by the EU to collect data on Americans and T Mobile is foreign Company so you can NOT trust your data to T Mobile because they have a agenda to farther the EU's one world order. not protecting your data."
Who thinks that TMUS will merge with CMCSA or CHTR after the merger? I don't see it as they would want to be alpha company and TMUS would be no more. That would only work if they needed the cash. I think that is floated as a ruse for something else.
"How much will TMUS results impact the stock price? Probably not much. I don't expect the results to do much because T-Mobile and Sprint are locked into a range pending the merger agreement being finalized and moving forward. The deal puts the companies into somewhat of a limbo with respect to the stock market as the deal structure, exchange ratio, prospectus for the merged company, and early rounds of feedback and disclosures with the regulators will dominate the outlook."
Beautiful Bounce!

"The markets have continued to move down, making it clear that if you try to buy falling knives you get your hands cut off. Use of program buy order during such times may get you in on false bottoms but out again when they break to the downside. A common program/algo trading strategy that pros use is to adjust the limits for their trades depending on the market and stock trend bias. In down markets and stock trends, that means setting the buy limits high, and the sell (again) limits low. That means that you respect the fact that the trend remains down but try to catch a real reversal. If the stock moves up more than normal on volume momentum, the trade executes. The follow-on conditional order is set with tight limits. If the stock, index fund etc. falls you want to get out quickly."

"""All four major US wireless carriers received DOJ requests""Are mobile operators in collusion to control their markets?You bet your sweet bippy they are. They are companies run by massive organizations, funded by 100s of billions of bucks, in charge of among the world's greatest efforts as mastery of the sciences, and headed by the same human idiot monkeys that we all are. It is part and partial of the effort to gain control over the engines of technology, capital formation, government control, legal defenses, public relations mastery, and bedazzlement of investors as is possible. That is what companies and people who work for them do. And, to a large extent, that is what governments and citizens want them to do. We, out government regulators and the rest of society conspire with industry to doggedly pursue their interests so long as they further the common interests.That is the thing: Companies are pigs and like for the rest of us there has to be limits on what they can get away with. With great power, comes great responsibility.The wireless companies are given monopoly licenses over the irreplaceable resource of spectrum. In most countries, starting with the USA, the spectrum was determined to be owned by 'we the people'. The government, the Congress, the White House, and the judiciary are stewards of the public trust. The Congress established the FCC to administrate communications of airwaves and other means of communications to fulfill that public trust. They initially gave licenses away for free but, as multiple uses were found that made spectrum sought after, licensed it for revenue that Congress could blow up, er spend as they sought fit.Thank goodness for free enterprise - that is what caused the motivation to employ wealth and talent to develop scientific inventions into practical applications of chips and electronics that are built into networks and devices. The world has been transformed. However, this was not the effort of just the four companies the ride on the wave of industry success. It has much to owe to waves of growth set in motion by early and supporting waves of growth including earlier military-aerospace, wireless broadband and WiFi in the hands of 'we the people'. So should DOJ look at what the pigs are doing with their power? You bet your sweet pitouney. They should have been pushing the FCC to open up more spectrum, including low-frequency spectra, for shared access IMO. Why? Because you can only trust the system to work so long as there is real competition and checks and balances against the BORG like the power of the scale of the industry is enforced by the only entity that has the power to bring it to bare - the DOJ/government."
"What a comeback, pullback over?"
Say what you what but I don't see Son taking any lower offers for Sprint but the on the other hand I do see him looking into other options due to the Spectrum and Patients owned by Sprint and walking off into the sunset with someone else.Dish could become a very good partner also with the Spectrum chest they are holding along with others.Sprint is in a much better position to service the TMO if everything is taken in consideration

FYI my training started in telecom in the 1980’s. I am a financial person that knows telecom. Old telecom networks like AT&T are a hodgepodge of disparate networks patched together. Why do you think the reason that AT&T gave up their DSL rural business? Because it is in the ground and not cost effective to manage. t mobile swooped in and recently gained this 20 million potential customers and all they have to do is let these customers activate their own internet service. This shows the advantage of a new network compared to an antiquated network. T mobile technology will distribute telecom the new 5 years. You can bank on this.
T-Mobile has terminated thousands of American jobs and on top of that have paid 40 millions fines for misleading billions American people and the US government for ringtone. This should be Red Flag for DOJ n FCC.. Think about the American People.
My bet is still Comcast will make a big bid for TMUS.

"Why isn't TMUS soaring on the announcement of ""NetFlix on Us""? That is partly because it spoils the fantasy that the mobile industry can become the BORG colossi that 'assimilate' everything around it: online mobile transaction, TV/Movie video, home broadband, etc. revenue directly under its fingers. Many financial analysts have bought into the vision held by Verizon and AT&T that mobile operators can grow and acquire the converging segments of ICT, the Internet and Communications Tech, industry, thus growing significantly larger and more profitable. T-Mobile's vision is that the overall revenue of enfolding cable-fiber, satellite, media, participation in financial transactions, etc. may decline as the multiplicity of networks combine to become much more efficient and harmonious, benefiting customers with greater ease of use and more diversity. Who wins? By pursuing the side of the 20-year-old maturing vision of the ""future of wireless"" that is focused on 'what do consumers want/need' instead of 'what will gain us the most control/power?' T-Mobile chosen the side that Business and Marketing 101 school books say will eventually win out.Tests of these two possible futures have already been occurring, transitioning this topic from the 'future think' to the present. And this testing has not just been here: in fact, prior testing has been done in the EU, parts of Asia. The combined examples show that mobile operators fail more than succeed in media. Where there are signs of success tend to be at the grassroots. For example, mobile transactions have become huge in Africa, Asia, ie. the 'BRIC' countries but have failed miserably by comparison here in the USA despite relative massive investments. Has anyone been to Africa, emerging parts of Asia, India? If you have, you know what I am talking about."

"Verizon and AT&T have cut 5X more jobs than Sprint. T-Mobile has added about 20 thousands jobs.AT&T and Verizon plan more job cuts as they continue to consolidate their businesses. The wireless industry will reduce jobs needed to deliver basic phone, messaging and data bits. The growth of jobs will come, as they always have, from the new frontiers of service, most of which are outside of the wireless/ICT companies. This is not theory, it has already been happening: AT&T has cut employees multiple times over the past few years. Indicative of the reasons:""""To win in this new world, we must continue to lower costs and keep getting faster, leaner, and more agile,"" AT&T Technology and Operations President Jeff McElfresh reportedly told employees in the memo. ""This includes reductions in our organization, and others across the company, which will begin later this month and take place over several months.""""Verizon has cut jobs multiple times in recent years for the same basic reason - as an industry matures and consolidation has taken place, mainly by AT&T and Verizon, the BORG assimilators, the companies need fewer workers. They need job cuts so that they can be the wealthy 5% of Americans who own 95% of the stocks. The lordly class is superior to the commoners who must work for a living - they deserve to make their money from dividends. It is natural for societies to stratify with a dominant group of the most bloodthirsty rising to the top to bleed the profits. (is this not a bit true and also ""anti-American""?). The jobs issue is largely a ruse. The wireless industry enables more new jobs outside of itself than it creates internally. About 7 times as many. It is the 'broadband utility' and rising applications platform that society feasts upon. It makes no sense to pick out New T-Mobile as a threat to jobs when the history of T-Mobile shows they have added jobs while VZ and T have cut jobs in order to pay the idle rich 5% club to sit back and pontificate on how great they are at building a better America."
Seems deal now it includes Google / Dish. They are setting TMUS up as Google has the funds to start a legit 4th carrier. Google has hard ties to CTL for backhaul which has the largest FTTT footprint. Google will team with CTL if they are part of the merger. That will leave TMUS without leverage on a backhaul provider. I have said the MVNO trade agreement for fiber backhaul rights is the deal TMUS should be making. I guess they are helping others make the same deal and leaving TMUS as an island without a partner. Bad Deal for TMUS.

"Critics Slam Sprint-T-Mobile MergerA tie-up between Sprint (S - Get Report) and T-Mobile (TMUS - Get Report) would encourage collusion between the newly created entity and the nation's two largest carriers: Verizon (VZ - Get Report) and AT&T (T - Get Report) . That's according to the American Antitrust Institute, who's president, Diana Moss, chatted with The Deal's David Hatch about the problems with creating a third dominant player in the U.S. wireless game. ""All remaining rivals would have the same market share,"" Moss told Hatch. That's a ""setup for the firms' losing their incentive to compete head-to-head"" and instead following each other on rate increases and other business decisions, she explained."" While T-Mobile has said it would maintain its maverick style after acquiring Sprint, Moss isn't buying it. Dish Network (DISH - Get Report) raised similar fears in its own proclamation against the merger. T-Mobile would be ""much more aligned with the pricing incentives of these incumbents than it would be with T-Mobile or Sprint as standalone companies,"" the satellite television provider reasoned. To be sure, supporters of the merger also caution that AT&T, as the leading carrier, would have had less economic incentive to disrupt the marketplace after acquiring T-Mobile than T-Mobile would after buying Sprint. We now await responses from the various regulators on the complaints."

"The adjustment to the Sprint to T-Mobile stock exchange ratio has been settled to the favor of shareholders outside of SoftBank. The number came in within what I have posted was likely 10-15%. I had a wider margin months ago but as events unfolded thought it would be resolved lower. Even though Sprint's fortunes had deteriorated over the about 2 years since, the way the set of agreements were fashioned that placed emphasis on DISH's participation to cement approval increased the value of Sprint's MVNO operations and spectrum over what it had been. 'Timing is everything' for many things in business. The timing of access to Sprint's combined spectrum, particularly the 2.5 GHz band, has become more critical for T-Mobile's sustained momentum. The fact that the deals remove DISH's spectrum from being sold or partnered for use by competitors improves the chances for T-Mobile to capture share for a longer period of time and forge a greater distinction between nT-Mobile's bran of 5G and Verizon and AT&AT's 'lumpy gravy' coverage and bandwidth mmWave-based 5G. If DISH were not able to be swayed by Sprint's on-ramp MVNO entry into mobile, the company might have sold off some of its spectrum or partnered for join network access with AT&T, Verizon or the cable companies. Either would have created more potent compatitors with lots more cash to spend to fight New T-Mobile ramp up of 5G.As it turns out, this is close to what was expected except I did not see SoftBank's absorption of the valuation difference that leaves other S shareholders at full value."

"One factor of 5G that has not been heard much about is the enablement of private cloud 5G networks and other 3rd party networks including municipal and silo applications. 5G wireless enables network and service virtualization and for enterprises, governments, and others to build private, shared access, and co-use wireless networks. This has the potential to speed up deployments by 3rd party deployment of smallcells, in-building, municipal, venue, and use-case service profile builds. However, that can be seen as mobile, cable, or other infrastructure-based operators giving up business and control over the market and its critical data. This capability extends worldwide, certainly not just confined to developed and push-effort countries like China and India. A lot has been happening in parts of Asia and Africa where it gained support starting several years ago and where deployed resources are less. Since enterprisess, industrial IoT, medical complexes have the motivation to make use of broadband cloud, in-building signaling, etc. it is possible to innovate business arrangements that benefit customers as well as the mobile/ICT operators. How much this will impact the competitive landscape has much to do with the innovation that mobile operators open up to their clients and, likewise, welcome from outside, including open source developments."

"Is this a good time to buy TMUS? The market may stay in a correction mode for a while. When stocks or the market sell-off by enough to reverse the long-term averages, they either tend to have a capitulation, which is a steep decline as some investors give up, or the market 'finds a bottom' and the oscillations narrow into a sideways baseline that establishes a support level. From that point, the market takes its cues from economic and business trends, such as increased or declines in sales and earnings. The tech sector has had the wind of the tax cut stimulus and favorable worldwide economic trends that have built momentum since the financial crisis of nearly ten years ago at the start of the Obama administration at its back. That stimulus is significantly baked into the cake so that improvement in sales and profits for many companies must come from foreign markets or an increase in consumer spending to continue to lift the boats. TMUS (and S-) are less dependent on the broad economy due to advantageous circumstances which can be enhanced by the merger. So, yes, it's generally a fair-to-good time to buy TMUS IMO. Of course, any time you say 'buy' it must be predicated by ""don't be a total idiot, use stop-loss orders or closely monitor the situation. If things change, re-evaluate the premise for your investment."""

"A recent article shows that telecommunications sector stocks are turning in better earnings than forecast. There has been a propensity of articles and analyst reports about there being 'intense competition' in the mobile industry. However, when you look at the margins and profits reported, it is shown that over the past four years in which subscribers have grown less than in the past, margins and profits have not gone down. The health of the industry has remained good despite maturing growth, the threat of new competition (but little to no actual new competition), and what is said to be very intense competition in rate plans and devices. Have device prices actually decreased? Only at the margins. You can get better devices for less money than a few years ago. However, the leading edge devices cost about the same and have more and better features. Have rate plans come down a lot? Consumers average bills have increased over the past five years. Recently, average ARPUs of the top four operators have moderated: they are about the same but more bandwidth is being used on average and there is more use of facetime type video calling and messaging apps. Thus, consumers are paying about the same but getting more on their rate plans. ""Gee, giving consumers more for less means operators are marvelous philanthropists!"" No, it means they are following down the path of technological progress that delivers more for less. Today's networks cost about the same to deploy than five years ago but deliver about 5X the bandwidth. Latency has dropped to about 25% of what it was. Applications have improved that take advantage of the bandwidth and low latency so that video apps work better. Therefore, competition compels operators to give you more for the same money while they remain about the same level of margins and profits.The point is that the headlines do not sell ads based on ""Everything are the same, operators are competitive but the industry remains boringly healthy."" Analysts don't make the news or sell reports that say ""Everything is on within 10% of the trajectory I reported a year ago, only further down the road. No need to subscribe or pay for my advice, stick a pin in it."""

"What are the opportunities for T-Mobile if they do not merge with a cable company or Sprintsy wintsy? It is impossible to sketch out every opportunity because some only become available as the ITC industry professes to expose either new merger priorities or ignored opportunities that are exposed by the progress of technologies and markets. T-mobile has not 'invented' much of anything. They have pursued patents in a few things. However, the use of the techniques, such as optimized 480 bit video streaming is oh so mundane when it comes down to it. The VoIP/VoLTE multiple phone numbers thing is effective but not rocket science. It is that competitors had not exploited the developments that sat there that made that available to T-Mobile. What does that say about the company? That these guys are on the ball and, most important, willing to take advantage of confluence of technology and markets when their BORG or otherwise brain-dead competitors are not.What is most exemplary is that this pattern can be repeated again in the future. T-Mobile or even Spritnsy wintsy could take advantage of opportunities as they expose themselves. Many of these can be mapped out ahead of time: 'if Verizon and AT&T continue to act like the protectionists they have been, we should be able to strike at xyz when 5G such and such network or device capabilities are available or, as the market moves on to want more bandwidth, lower price points so mass consumption can selfishly progress or a new combination of services is exposed as then being feasible.The factor that is significant is that the mode of taking advantage of untapped opportunities because that is sacrificial of some of the current fat revenue streams is an open ended situation. Wireless and hybrid network technology will progress regardless of who takes advantage of it. Markets will evolve as they always do - propelled by competition and raising of consumers expectations. Any operator who tries to stand in the way of that will become vulnerable to being outflanked or directly challenged. Why should T-Mobile expect untapped opportunities to arise going forward? Because some of them will necessarily be cannibalistic of current revenue.streams. Take the recent decision of Verizon to re-enter unlimited service offerings. Veriozon has had the philosophy of providing capacity to fit the bell curve of most of customer requirements. They were happy to ride that demand curve, charing the outliers with hefty overages charges. VZ was able to do that because they had the best coverage and capacity. So long as they shifted up the bandwidth caps to keep the majority of users from revolting, VZ could ring the cash register for billions of extra charges. That created an opportunity for T-mobile to stand apart, not just by offering a lower price but by shoving the strategy up their yanowhats in their messaging to the public.The industry will continue to be impacted by the ""Moore, Cooper, Alamouti law"" of wireless progress: that core wireless signaling capacity doubles about every 18 months. This is similar to Moore's law for semiconductors that has enabled computers, networking and wireless devices to increase in capabilities to offer double the capabilities for the same money or more than that for more money. Going forward, new opportunities will stem from this such as offering replacement for wired broadband and video services at a competitive price. The bloodclots in the evolution will spring up because less amenable to change operators will try to hand onto current fat revenues for as long as they can. That is the nature of the beast. So long as VZ and T are fat cows, they will lag in taking advantage of changes that displace current modes of delivery. T-Mobile does not have to do a damn thing in terms of mergers and acquisitions so long as they keep the current zeitgeist. Furthermore, while T-Mobile has done a lot, they have hardly pushed the envelope as far as they might. Sprint, on the otherhand, has moved at a glacial pace, failing to take advantage of their wealth of spectrum to implement more than incremental, industry groveling changes. T-Mobile has more than ample opportunities to continue to tear open fresh wounds in the lethargic nether beasts."
"Not good....SCOOP: NY, CA AGs looking to expand coalition to block @TMobile @sprint merger; NY, CA AGs asking other Dem AGs to join lawsuit to block merger; State AGs seeking injunction which could delay deal indefinitely more now @FoxBusiness @TeamCavuto $TMUS $S"
"Wrong.The path to 5G is no different as a business model than 3G and 4G: the approach that made textbook sense and has proven out is to acquire capital through the sale of public shares, take on debt to acquire a mix of spectrum needed to satisfy customer needs. As the type of service has changed, more spectrum and newer networks were needed. If the business was a success in the previous generation, then sales and profits would be pouring in to more than pay a breakeven return on the investment, thus affording the build of the new latest generation deployed in denser multiple-spectrum overlay networks. T-Mobile has adequate funding to deploy 5G. That is helped by having wideband spectrum in the 600-700MHz low-band that is complimented by wideband spectrum in the mid-band. That allows 5G to be deployed in a way that fits market needs rather than as required by the limits of the spectrum. Sprint, for example, has a preponderance of high-band spectrum that requires dense deployment from the start in order to be used as 5G. While the capacity is potentially larger than the currently licensed spectrum of competitors, including T-Mobile, Sprint's spectrum is impractical to deploy 5G into because the company only has about 14% of marketshare. Its customers are spread too thinly to make dense deployment profitable. And it is a question of what comes first, the chicken or the egg - can an operator collect eggs (revenue and profits) before they have the chicken that lays them? Of course, it is not as simple as that analogy but is nonetheless how it is.TMUS is making billions in profits and will spend billions in cost-effective network builds."
"What will TMUS have to give up for the merger is the big question? Sprint will be the winner no matter what, the backout clause is huge for TMUS and good for S."
"Same amount of subscribers with VZ and T, but less than half the valuation. I am working in this industry and it is all about scale of economy. More subscriber means more profit"
Leader in 5G spectrum with lowest operational cost for 5G.No worries - this will go up and catch Verizon for 1st place
"The only company that can give TMUS a run is VZ. That will be a year. However, TMUS is doing some dumb things right now...really missing with the Metro dealer base. Cocky move. That’s a mistake VZ will capitalize on."
tmobile has played its cards mostly right up to this point and i have been wrong about this stock from time to time but if this merger goes through it will not be good.

Little known things:Alibaba is the fastest growing e-commerce platform and cloud services provider in recent years. They compete with Amazon almost across the board. This is far more of direct competition between the USA and China than the building of domestic 5G networks. Communications networks follow the money or get out just ahead of it. e-Commerce IS the flow of money and it is increasingly turning to Artificial Intelligence applied to Big Data in addition to customer-specific data.Both Alibaba and Amazon have their own AI chip efforts. The Chinese government had made AI among its top priorities. The US government has turned to companies to sort out AI and invest in it. The sideline argument that we need the merger to compete with China can be considered to also be 'and let American companies work with NewTM on 5G in the areas where they excel.'
Len should come out soon ! Lol
"Verizon has announced additional '5G' initiatives to develop infrastructure equipment and devices using 3.5GHz and microwave band spectrum. Verizon and allied companies present their focus on 5G as 'fixed wireless'. However, it is too early and too dynamic of a field of development to say how these efforts will play out: The big takeaway of 5G is that it is an extension of 4G that broadens the field of applications using a tiered wireless and hybrid wired-wireless network approach. 5G is aimed at fulfilling the long-term goal of using wireless for almost any conceivable combination of use cases under a common umbrella. While a specific aspect of 5G can be said to be used for 'fixed wireless broadband' or for specific vertical silo applications such as homeland defense/emergency responder or for automotive, operators will build their networks to serve multiple purposes, not isolated use cases. 5G use in higher frequency bands is anticipated in the 3GPP-5GPP standards for both fixed point-to-point and point-to-multipoint grid/MESH backhaul/fronthaul network service and as an additional layer of service for existing mobile networks. It is like a nervous system - very difficult to separate out distinct parts of it without cutting off the function of the other parts. While Verizon says their approach to 5G will start as 'fixed' they are working with chip supplier Qualcomm and equipment suppliers Nokia, Samsung and Ericsson and multiple device suppliers to use 3.5GHz as an additional mobile band. And while a large aspect of higher frequency use will focus on the heavy lifting metro grid back/front haul to smallcells of various types, among the development intent is to use low power so that mobile devices work well. Why worry much about battery life if the primary focus is to use the abundant higher frequency bands for infrastructure? I think it extremely likely that Verizon is trying to do an end-around fake-out play: By promoting the image of building a fixed wireless network, they hope to catch T-Mobile, Sprint, and maybe even AT&T off their guard. Make no mistake: There will be a race to get into a position in high bandwidth 5G that locks out competitors through market dominance. This will take a few years to play out. However, steps taken over the next three-five years will likely determine the outcome."
Geezus...this drop ain't fun!
"Great News! TMUS and S are down on the news that 10 US State AG's will file a lawsuit to block the merger. I gave the odds of a lawsuit at 50:50. The odds the lawsuit will succeed in blocking the merger are low, I give it no better than 6%. However, this can cause some delay in the deal being considered final.The DOJ ATR looks close to approving the deal after working out some additional commitments with NewTM. The rumors are the spinout of Boost Mobile with Amazon possibly acquiring it, to spin out of some of Sprint's spectrum. That could be done in a way that is not so typically castrated as the actions the FCC has taken... we shall see. In any case, the reason why the State AG's are filing a lawsuit is that they know that the US DOJ is going to approve the merger along with the FCC. The bottom line is that the FEDs will render their decision to approve the merger as early as this week and that this will, despite the multiple concessions, lead to a rise in the merged stocks over coming quarters.Markets hate uncertainty which makes this a buying opportunity IMO. TMUS, S, SFTBY are buys. As always, use stop-loss orders or only have at much at stake in any one stock to absorb the risks. I think the odds are excellent that the merger will be approved and overcome legal opposition and that the impact will lead to a few years of growth that makes this a good buying opportunity."
"===11/06/2020 $147 price target===> Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised the firm's price target on T-Mobile to $147 from $135 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following the company's ""impressive beat."""
"I know one thing. If T-mobile falls low enough, instead of it buying somebody else, it will be bought by somebody else."
Seems to me that the AG's are just delaying the merger to give time for the Duopoly to catch-up.

If the deal fails Sprint will be bankrupted anyway. We will either bail them out to keep 4 carriers giving them billions to upgrade to 5g. Or let the merger happen through normal atrision. The merger is good for everyone.Stonger competition means AT&T and Verizon have to keep prices down and invest in innovation.

"US mobile operators have gone through contortions over time: The industry used to subsidize the sale of phones, pushing the upfront cost of the purchase into the monthly charges. This has financial implications and was often voiced as something the industry wanted to get away from. The solution was to lease devices, sometimes with a substantial upfront payment. Leasing was seen as a way to cement subscribers to the mobile operator. Strategies then shifted to get away from leasing as a way to free up billions of dollars of carrying costs and shift financing to separate units of the company or third party facilitators. While tat freed up capital it also made it easier for customers to pay off their balances and shift service to other carriers. Competitors picked up on that to offer deals to buy out customer's contracts, taking in the phones to be refurbished and sold back into the market to recoup much of the balance owed. Sprint and T-Mobile actively went after Verizon and AT&T with these offers. However, once that became a common practice, the rationale for continuing with finance programs that cede control to the customer became more of a wash-out. So now we see Sprint and others shifting back to leasing rather than financing the sale of devices, thus making it more difficult for their customers to leave to a competitor as the device can't be transferred.Comments?"
Go Big T-MOBILE !!!!
"I do love Mr. TRUMP, wil VOTE for TRUMP because he doesn't like RED"
"The merger review process is on track. The delay from the 180 shot-clock was expected because it takes longer for mega-mergers. That has been the case for all mergers of similar scale, complexity, and market impact. Therefore, the fact that the FCC has said it is setting up more teams who will need more time to study the details is a favorable indication.The opposition to the merger was expected because MVNOs, DISH, cable companies, other mobile operators, government entities, and consumers will be impacted. Some parties want assurances that the deals they have with either T-Mobile or Sprint will be extended to New T-Mobile. They would like more than that in order to compete. That may appear out of line with what can reasonably be asked for the government to assure under our free enterprise system. However, the government helps put mobile operators in business and grants them licenses to keep competition out. Under the circumstance in which New T-Mobile asks to be granted an exception to the normative procedure for determining a merger in a concentrated industry, asking for more out of the deal struck between regulators and the NewCo is copacetic. Everything is fine."
"What is wrong with the President Trump administration's approach to negotiating trade agreements with China? It is being made personal and confrontational beyond the degree of America's ability to walk the talk. Trump asserts that he can do without trade with China. He may but the many companies that rely on trade to China cannot. Trump's belligerent strategy and personal attack demeanor plays to China's stronger position as the leading manufacturer supplier nation. Trump says that China is hurting more than the USA from the trade tariffs. That is saying that America can afford to toughen it out to pressure China into reforms to open up to foreign participation in its economy and trade and IPR concessions. To some extent that is possible, but the way Trump is going about this is potentially deadly for US interests.Trump says that China is paying for the tariffs. Yea sure, others pay for everything, the wall, wars, tariffs, government spending.. click your rubby-red slippers three times and you will it will transport you to Kansas. Trump says that his tariffs are causing harm to the Chinese economy. He says that he, embodied as America, can back down China’s Xi by imposing tariffs. China has responded with their own set of tariffs on the relatively small amount of imports and by devaluing China’s currency. Trump asserts that is a foul play as if tariffs and other measures are the norm. What Trump gets grossly wrong is that the devaluing of China’s currency harms their economy and helps trade of US firms: the impact is 180 degrees the opposite. The Chinese government devaluation of currency results in lower prices for its exports while US imports go up in price. That has the opposite of the intended consequences of Trumps tariffs which are to cause US exports to increase and imports from China decrease, reducing our trade imbalance. Trump is a fish out of water.He is causing China to work to develop alternatives to products from the USA while causing immediate harm to exports from US companies into China. Trump Claims China is HurtingChina’s economy has boomed over the past 15+ years. About six years ago the Chinese government sought to reduce growth from what had been 12% down to a goal of 6-7%. They imposed restrictions on lending and real estate speculation. The impact of the tariffs has is offset by increased government spending on high-speed mass transit, airports, green energy, and other initiatives that American can only dream about because we cannot afford them under the current government priorities. What Trump asserts as hurting the Chinese economy has been the reduction of growth from about 7.2% to 6.1% which is within the goals set for economic growth. That has left China in a position of strength that allows the government to devalue the currency to offset the impact of Trump’s’ tariffs. Trump attacks people on a personal basis if he does not get his way. That is not ‘how you do things’ in Asia and most of the world. The Asian ethic is not to attack people in this way. That is taken as showing crude behavior that can not be responded to either in kind or by giving way. In other words, Trumps conduct is beneath eliciting a favorable response. It sends a clear message that Trump lack due respect for China’s position in the world today and is willing to tear up personal and diplomatic understandings in favor of temper tantrums."

"The US wireless industry, as represented by CTIA and 5G Americas, has taken a position on '5G spectrum' (all spectrum) that the FCC should make it easier for mobile operators to monopolize use and exclude corporate, WISP, and public use. The selfish piggies want it all under their control. For example, the FCC has been criticized from both sides on how the rules are set for CBRS auction: the WISP, Wireless Internet Service Providers, a group of small wireless operators that have made use of unlicensed and lightly licensed (cheap) spectra, have criticized the FCC rules as providing them with too large of plots to be economical and for giving in to the demands of the mobile operators. The mobile organizations have criticized the FCC for retaining the joint-access sub-bands and not requiring incumbent users to clear the band.T-Mobile could take advantage of the CBRS to go along with the intent of the FCC: to work with enterprise, government, and WISPs to make use of the band for both an overlay to their network and as a shared-access band that their customers can (help) build out. By seizing on the band to help build a common-access network, New T-Mo would accelerate adoption of the band and would change the metrics for engagement with enterprise, government and third-party network developers. The reason that makes sense is because the band needs to be built out densely in order to take better advantage of its mid-range coverage and high bandwidth density. While that approach can be taken in other bands, the CBRS sits 'in the middle' of use case scenarios which makes it usable for computer networks and high-bandwidth in-building networks that then feed into the broad Internet and mobile/everywhere WAN of T-Mobile. T-Mo can become the sponsor of wide adoption of the CBRS and other bands that significantly improves the business case for these market segments. And because the co-op use of part of the band will reduce the cost of building densely, that will bring a cost and time-to-market advantage to the table that will be attractive."
JohnnyDetroit Here some Questions for you and you will find all the answers are yes if you really want to look for them Always remember peoples and companies actions always tell the real truth. Is T Mobile a Foreign company?Did the money that founded T Mobile come from the EU?Does the EU have agenda to Farther the EU's one world order agenda ?Would the EU's use any and everything they can to farther that agenda ?Did the USA move the first responders to T's network ? Why ?You can do or invest in anything you want but in my opinion T Mobile can NOT be trusted because they money that founded T Mobile has an agenda and they would use any means they can to farther that agenda. FACT
Latest Update from Charlie G:SCOOP—PE firms interested in spectrum from @TMobile- @sprint merger calling on @JusticeATR for meetings. But DOJ said to be averse to PE in spectrum sale process. DOJ telling $TMUS $ it could make merger announcement before spectrum divestiture finalized more now @FoxBusiness
T-Mobile has figured it out. They can and will compete head to head with Debt laden T and VZ
"Looks LIKE you get to SAY OH NO DOWN TMUS goes LOL,LOL, WOW you have a long way to fall before Analyst even start to down grade and nothing to stop the fall no dividends nothing but DOWN and RED for a while LOL,LOL,LOL"
Well we all knew this was going to happen The MEGA-MERGER is Deadhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/b8e5dd78-c08e-38e7-b517-7c108ed7eb1f/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger.html
$TMUS cancelling plan to offer TV service this year. Although since it's 12/20 I'm not sure of which year
This thing acts like a bumstock. Somebody needs to give it a good kick.
RELAX...Its a Non Dillutive Secondary Offering. Masa just selling his shares to raise cash to offset losses elsewhere.
UP BIG IN AFTER HOURS !!!!!!
The only reason tmobile has put 5g on hold is they don't have a future without sprint they got caught with there you no the rest of the story..
"MO....in the back conference rooms of Sprint. TMUS and about 6 others, big wheeling and dealing is taking place....M. & A. is the subject"
"Next year will be a big year for preparing the market ahead of the widespread availability of 5G services. Operators will start chipping away at cable replacement and other areas of business that are better enabled with 4G-Advanced+ and 5G networks. The biggest thing to change over the next 18 months will likely be the public perception of the role wireless service can take. While a large and growing portion of the market uses their wireless subscription to view a video as well and text and voice messaging many still do not think of that as being equal to a cable or fiber optic connection. The advertising blitz and media coverage going forward will change the perception to put it front and center as the one subscription that can, location and other limitations considered, be used for all consumer needs.What will be the impact of 5G on the operator's revenue? Through the rest of this year and into the middle of next year, the revenue probably will not be broken out to a degree that it can be quantified. The subjective influence of 5G on revenues will likely not become significant until early 2020. By then there should be a number of devices available to reach a level of market saturation that is measurable in context with the scale of the mobile markets. The fixed 5G market should be easier to figure as it uses distinct devices (for now) and subscriptions.In the meantime, there is risk for mobile stocks from changes in the perception of the role media services may play. T-Mobile and Sprint are far less dependent on selling their own media packages or the success of media units OTT and wired services than are AT&T and Verizon. Recently, AT&T's DTV has disappointed and new OTT services from Time Warner have been delayed. DISH's results also throw cold water on prospects for incumbents sale of OTT or satellite services. The global trend continues to be that the upstarts including NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube are on the rise while the conventional media suppliers businesses are seeing fracturing as more of the 'channels' use multiple OTT outlets including their own. While the future of media sales by mobile operators is looking a bit tarnished, T-Mobile or New T-Mobile are on a path to deliver the more efficient, higher bandwidth/buck networks that will benefit from OTT media whether they are in the middle or because the demand created helps shift customers to them."
Schadenfreude has a short life. Other companies' debt doesn't make your company better.
"20 T-Mobile Analysts report forecasted Growth Estimates for the Current Quarter for TMUS to be -14.7%. They are projecting Next Quarter growth of -32.1%. For the next 5 years, this was reported Jan 25 2017 by Adam Smith from the News Oracle."
"Remember, today at 4:40pm is Sievert and Team's business update at the UBS conference...stay tuned! (And maybe cover your Shorts before the close in case any positive news is given!)"
Cramer picks TMUS in his list of favorite 5G plays! Booyah!
TMUS is up 4.90% to 93.75
"Tmobile money. Earn 4% up to $3K. Haha. They should enter the financial services business, like Venmo. Where you can send money to your fellow Tmobilers...."
Only Place for this stock to go is up imo nothing negative really ever comes up with TMUS
"Many Sprint customers are already switching to Tmobile...if you need or want a new device, just switch over now to avoid the hassle later."
the buyback is to cover the preferred share conversion.
the call volume is kinda low for this traders are missing out
126$ nice chance to buy!!
All utilities up their prices about once a year. So why are AG's being so hard w/T-Mo. Sounds like some corruption going on here.
This will see RED once ER comes out. Guaranteed
Very weak indeed; I see $65's short term...Maybe as early as tomorrow....
"Good idea, that T-Mobile Cloud Unlimited. Oh, wait; that's Verizon."
"For next 2-3 years, Tmus will outperform VZ and T because of spectrum they got. TMUS is a clear winner"
"Sprint reported a modest gain in subscribers but also lower revenue. This shows the impact if deep price cuts to attract customers during the Christmas holiday season. Sprint reported a profit of $1.79 largely due to a tax accounting benefit. It is interesting to watch the stock - it had been down over the past several weeks to become short-term technically oversold. Despite that, the earnings report has, thus far, failed to cause the stock to jolt higher as the report should have suggested. If S continues not to react to the news, then is may show the axiom that 'buy the rumor, sell the news' applies even when a stock was already down. That may be influenced by the fact that Softbank has been the largest buyer of the stock since the end of the mergers talks, having entered with the purpose of supporting the stock price. With Sprint's prime mover out of the market, the remaining float is left to figure out which way it will go."
Att has more problems CNN reporter Jada Sacker caught on video in the Capitol with left wing activist John Sullivan before riots and from inside encouraging them to riot. After they do shes said WE DID IT. The riot led to alot of loss in investor money on Free Speech issues. CNN will be sued.
What will be the new name of the merged company?
"Based on the ongoing c band auction , T-Mobile got sprint at real discount. Sprint 2.5 ghz alone is worth at least 60 billions. T-Mobile got the whole company for just 70 billions."
T-Mobile (TMUS) remains within a few points of its multi-year highs and less impacted by recent market selling than the majority of tech stocks. It is a buy based on both its own prospects and that of the merger with Sprint IMO. The recent dip to the low end of the recent range should be used to buy-accumulate. More market turmoil is quite possible. The 'Santa Claus rally' proved to be a sock full of coal and year-end window dressing and news about CFIUS and DOJ's reported acceptance of three major mobile network players being enough to constitute a competitive market only helped soften the blows given by repeated market sell-offs. The move to the current price should be taken advantage of to accumulate the stock IMO.
TMUS reached a new 52 Week High at 67.32
"T-Mobile US’ TMUS 600 MHz 5G now serves more than 215 million people, including citizens of Detroit and Columbus, while 50 million new T-Mobile devices have access to the 600 MHz LTE network. The company has deployed 5G sites in Philadelphia and New York City using Sprint’s 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum on its 5G network.The merger with Sprint enables T-Mobile to deploy nationwide 5G at a much faster rate. Within six years, the company is expected to provide 5G to 99% of the U.S. population and average 5G speeds above 100 Mbps to 90% of the population. T-Mobile has a market cap of $134.15 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for T-Mobile’s 2020 sales suggests an improvement of 51.8% on a year-over-year basis."
Sprints latest pricing plan is probably a subtle message to the FCC\DOJ prior to SB's bid to acquire DT's stake in T-Mobile USA. Sprint is telegraphing the Duopoly it's too damn big for the little guys to catch up.
$140 by end of week
"There are Bright prospects for the three merger stocks in the New Year. With the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint likely to clear the AG’s legal challenge, the uncertainty of these investments will diminish as investors shift focus to their near term and extended outlooks. TMUS is trading at the lower end of its range of P/E multiples of the past few years near 19. The high end of the P/E range is 28. The new composition of the stock may tame the high water mark going forward - we shall see. A look at the range of valuations:Annual earnings forecast (Zacks) consensus - high - lowDec 2020 4.88 5.25 4.51 Dec 2021 5.7 6.34 4.91 Dec 2022 6.1 6.98 4.46 TMUS Forecast numbers at 19 and 25 P/E values: for Dec 2020: 19 P/E 92.7c 99.8h 85.7l25 P/E 122c 131h 112.8lTwelve-month forecast for Sprint (S) using TMUS x 0.10256: 19 P/E 9.5c 10.24h 8.79l25 P/E 12.5c 13.43h 11.57lOn a risk to reward basis, S looks good: if the growth trajectory were to be similar to pre-merge TMUS, Sprint’s stock will be higher at the end of 2020 than the current price by about 12% using the low range for earnings and multiples. This is, or course, an imperfect evaluation because the merged company will have combined financial projections and performance objectives. I think there is upside to this projection. However, experience teaches investors to ‘see the results first' before believing your own or other’s projections. ‘Execution’ is the post-merger buzzword."
"R actually TMUS holding real well vs market , what is oh no going down is T. TMUS is actually winner of the pac and median target was raised to $149 high $175"
buy opportunity. back up to 129-130 Friday
Cramer said T-Mobile is the winner.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cramer-shares-thoughts-cvs-health-143214305.html
The S merger is not looking good if Comcast or Charter get the 4th carrier. The both have the juice to overtake TMUS /S. I don't see Comcast or Charter as friendly foe.
"expect TMUS to give us Bullish Guidance nextt week, we go over 90$$"
"Americans are so dumb, in Asia and Europe people pay a lot less for wireless service because tons of competition and better cell service coverage. All 3 major carriers here have tons of bandwidth and they are overcharging us because most Americans are just sheeps for Facebook and Apple."
Where is Len
Or is it maybe something evil t mobile doing next wave of Coronavirus on its 5G ? 5G clearly looks like to contribute to Coronavirus and many other future controlled crisis . biography is real guys one day you all will witness ;). I am always the first to call ot ahead of all and know things better ;l. lets see
Sprint has become a short-mid term buy based on tax windfall and being technically oversold. I can't recommend the stock as a long-term investment despite the strong backing of Softbank.
This is a great long-term investment. T-Mobile is going to eventually lead in market share.
What's going on with this stock? I was quite sure it would go up at least 2% today following the excellent quarterly results announced yesterday.
"A 2-month target price for TMUS is around 65. The stock will likely head back toward the previous range between the low 60 and 67 if performance is seen to continue on track. At this point, I doubt TMUS will achieve new highs until sometime next year as that will depend on how the competitive landscape continues to evolve. To maintain T-Mobile's momentum will require the continued discipline in harnessing of spectrum-networks to provide the 'All-In' set of services that help set the company apart from the competition even as competitors adopt similar strategies. That has helped to create a favorable brand image that is harder to step to a higher level but remains the key to continued success. Meanwhile, TMo has the improved coverage, reliability, bandwidth, and pursuit of the innovations in VoLTE and other features to make substantial gains in the business, IoT etc. that expand growth beyond the retail consumer markets.Less"
Adding more!! TMUS is going to breakout
$300 then split back to $301:30
Masa is a big time loser.Series of misjudgement are sign of alzheimer. Be aware Softbank investors. You are about to experience armageddon
"TMUS is a bit of a gamble IMO, i saw on https://www.yahoo.com/news/. that they expect lower quarterly ratings than anticipated"
dish is trading less than 5 years ago and is a takeover target due to spectrum inflation
Close over $135...All aboard for the launch to $150! TMUS is the 5G network DOMINATOR....and Value leader in the Industry!
R is politically CONFUSED here
"The market action should be looked at as a blessing: the US has many problems and we are one funky bunch monkeys in charge of industries and everyday things that may prove toxic to human survival... but that is irrelevant. Trump exposes many things wrong with our direction as a nation IMO. Sometimes it takes a fool to point out the the emperor is running around naked. The USA has been running around like we are lunatics... crazy spending on wars that make lots of companies and wage earnings vote in the next fool. Tax cuts as a means of paying off debts. Companies either run a 'balanced ship' or they sink. That can sometimes take several years but they cannot print more money to bail out (Sprint's) debt. They sometimes can reformulate the business to 'right size' and go after new opportunities. Even a nation as large as the USA can't float turdogovernmentspending downstream forevery. Sooner or latter the books have to balance. Tax cut nation has to result in bottom-up growth that leads to replenishment. Tax cuts must be an investment that, like for any business, pays back more than is spent. The problem is that tax cuts on top of a bloated economy in which 17% is creamed off the top for healthcare and 12% for military and another 4% for homeland defense and more to build a wall? Imbalance. The expense side must be directed at things that fuel useful growth. We do not need more hospitals and insurance companies. Yes, ranting. That is what the markets are now doing, ranting because people have come around to be concerned that there are no easy answers like tax cuts. That could help but the problem is that the US has several protected industries that suck the lifeblood out of the benefits that tax cuts are supposed to deliver.That all makes TMUS/New TMUS a better investment than otherwise. T-Mo is not dependent on tax cuts, government spending programs (although all the US operators benefit from being part of the state-socialist enclave that grants them monopolies over spectrum). The US economy is still being pumped up by the huge corporate tax cuts and healthy worldwide economy. The USA benefits from no longer being the only large driver of the world economy. We get to suck at the tit of China! Soaking up cheap imports while our own industry spews out Cheetos corn chips for the average American slob to get diabetes! How splendid. We are living in the lap of luxury!LOL!Back down to earth: TMUS and S are buy-accumulate despite all the madness. The economy does matter. What happens in the markets matter. But the stock is on its own fuel."

Chart looks solid. Long over 79.26. http://www.foxchart.com/share/353609979.png
"CNBC's David Faber reports that the negotiations between DISH Networks/Ergen and NewTM/Deutsche TK will continue into next week. Deutsche Telekom is said to be the hold up to the deal structure: Deutsche does not want NewTM to give up as many assets that would allow DISH to effectively compete. As mentioned in the past, DT has resisted attempts by Germain and EU regulators to share facilities and spectrum access and tie in their backhaul - efforts that have similar goals as those of the US DoJ, that is, to ease the entry of additional competition while making combined use wired-wireless network assets between the multiple market participants. DT has sued to overthrow such requirements: see an article ""Deutsche Telekom sues German government over 5G auction""). The DoJ should not be backing down. Even though the structure of the US industry is largely determined by the huge marketshare positions of Verizon and AT&T, the FEDs are extremely unlikely to go after them to break them up or otherwise cause them to be the ones who absorb the pain of restructuring. Money is power and there is not enough political fiber on either side of the else to make that happen. So NewTM finds itself in the position of needing to take one step back to take two steps forward. The structure issue was destined to be the stumbling block to this deal. Maybe something could have been worked out prior to T-Mobile's bid to merge with Sprint. Masa Son and Claure had repeatedly tried to merge Sprint with cablecos or anyone else with no results. That led to being eventually resigned to signing deals Altice, COX after trying to cut deals with CharterMalone and Comcast. That might have been extended by NewTM to offer a frame agreement to all fiber-cable and satellite companies in which NewTM would be the network development partner that offered shared access on the Band 41 spectra - the same spectra they now face losing their position entirely.How the structure issue if satisfied boils down to feasibility for both sides of the structure deal. It has to make business sense above all else. The reports of the DISH talks looks like it would not present a big problem for NewTM: they will be giving up some spectrum and Boost Mobile but will gain in added investment that can turn the band into a more effective space for 5G broadband.This merger will probably wrap up within two weeks. How do you play it? Why try to play the minor ups and downs based on when a decision will be made? You play the investment based on risk. There remains a high likelihood that the merger will be approved, 90%-95% IMO. The remaining is mostly due to Deutsche TK's possible veto ot the terms. I think NewTM and DT will come to an agreement that the DoJ can accept. And Ergen/DISH will like also because if they don't the FCC will no longer be their willing partner and Sprint or T-Mobile would be the spurned lovers."
CMCSA going to make play for Sprint when the merger falls through.
Stock is down due to delay in 5G launch by almost 9 monthshttps://www.engadget.com/2019/02/25/t-mobile-5g-launch-delayed/?yptr=yahoo
So the only way to approve their merger is to bribe the officials with infrastructure deals? Good idea.

"The Grinch that Stole Christmas was finally overtaken by tidings of joy that a new year will begin. Trump visited Iraq which takes our minds off of domestic politics and back to wrecking other countries as a way to salvation. While that is a morose take, tell that to the orphans in foreign lands. Anyway, make marry on the new year for it is a time to view the glass as half full and take on new challenges with renewed vigor.TMUS was 'bent but not broken' by the stormy market. The prospects for rolling out of 5G using deep-penetrating coverage low-band spectra in T-Mobile's capable hands bodes well for investors. If the merger is approved, which looks incredibly likely to occur in the first half, maybe around April, the New T-Mobile will be able to shift the time-to-market advantage of 5G Mobile to spring forward with the long sleeping promise of 'wireless broadband everywhere' and for almost every purpose. T-Mobile has not claimed to be First with 5G as its competitors have chomped a the bit to proclaim (3 competitors each are first?), however, New T-Mobile can be first in delivering 5G to most of the country that most people can actually use. And because the cost of delivering 5G that starts with low-band will be lower than fric and frak (VZ and T) can muster, T-Mo should be able to grab marketshare. How much marketshare is an open-ended question> The 'value proposition' should rather easily allow the continuation of T-Mobile's current sales trends. However, there is the potential to break down the barriers to taking share away from Verizon and AT&T: mob/mass psychology sways people to join in when the tide shifts in sentiment. That is the case for when a nation throws off disbelief to throw in with dictators. Hitler was great at rallying national pride and wealth. It is human nature to follow leadership because we have innate fear of our own abilities to reason things out and come to the consensus that is in our own best interests. That aspect of human nature can come into play with New T-Mobile. I like that the company is not trying to claim to be first... it is best to let actions speak louder than competitors can deliver because that will ring true when 5G is ready to have the real-world impact for the majority of people. New T-Mobile can be in a position in 18-24 months to be delivering the benefits of 5G including as a 'cable killer' home broadband play while Verizon and AT&T have only reached less than 50% of the country. That should be seen by the public as very strange... shattering their perception that paying more for Verizon and dealing with shady sales practices of AT&T for sub-standard DSL and satellite service is worth keeping. It is possible for New T-Mobile's sales to accelerate so that the company takes 'real share' away from the seemingly well-entrenched competitors. If that rosy scenario plays out, the stock value would rise. It is too early to start guessing where price targets might be placed.The sell-off has presented a buying opportunity that has not closed with the recent rebound. Those fortunate enough to have gotten in near the lows should not be eager to take profits quickly."
Well my call of $4-$5 run today is off by a few cents.
"Hm... not really moving after earrings, what’s going on?"
"The approval of the merger is a major milestone for the US wireless industry as it increases the momentum of 5G and should increase innovation in services when in gains traction in the market.What DoJ's approval didn't do was put asside all of the hurdles and it opened up the can or worries about how NewTM will execute, the impact of the economy and who knows what else. That is becaue the focus on the merger approval is simple to grasp, its almost a binary decision. The variables involved in execution, competitor's response, the economy, etc. take over the focus that is left in a vacuum. ""OK, you have our attention, now what are you doing for me today?"" Recent market focus has shifted to the economy and communications sector. The economy has been bumping along fueld by years of back filling helped by record low FED interest rates and, more recently, the huge tax cut. The worry is that those simulous are running their course without a hoped for growth in domestic productivity that helps balance out the tax vs. debt equation and foreign trade imbalance. Some fear another busting of the bubble with nothing much the FED can do but lower already low rates. The immediate problem is a growth of expectations and suppressions of concerns about the trade war impacts or resolution and exploding national debt. Robust growth should be a time when debt level shrink. That was the leading rationale for granting tac cuts.Anyway, the FED's 1/4 point rate cut and announcement that trade talks will take place in Shanghai were not enough or were a catalyst for enough investors to think ""I'll lighten up/sell when the next good news comes out to spur the market"", and thus, the rally did not happen. It's fun to conjecture but it does not much matter. Investors should not be trying to outguess markets. Insteads 'go with the momentum flow' and use tools."
TMUS is selling more shares stock price will nose dive
Watching this one soar today makes me realize my small investment in S back in November is not in vain.
Did they announce?
This company will be huge. It took few years to rise from $3 to almost $20 Now big endowments and institutions will pile in. Watch it go to $ by next earnings. 5 G is about to begin in $Aapl. $TMUS already sells Samsung 5G. This it the Time.$Apps will be $200 in 5 years.
"We have stopped the BORG before, it just takes a Nasty Little MegaMerger Virus and down they go in Flames. There will be some work involved with this new 5G network install, but it will be several years along as the old equipment fails then it will be replaced with 5G gear. It will bring very little new jobs since Tmobile already has the staff for the upgrade. If this Nasty MegaMerger was to go through there will be 40,000 jobs lost in the first 6 month to one year. It is just not worth the massive lost of jobs that this job killing merger will bring. Sprint is already moving forward with 5G and does not need the negative baggage that Tmobile will bring: More Debt, Lost Jobs, Higher Prices, Lower Pay,and less 5G locations.Stop this Nasty MegaMerger NOW!!!!!"

"What War or Race for 5G with China. And they say Huawei is the only company. This proves them Wrong AgainChina is set to have 5G technology commercially available in 2020. However, because Chinese authorities control the implementation of the technology, the process may be slow. The implementation of 4G technology did not occur until late 2013, many years after Korea, Japan, the United States and other nations had 4G technology.Many people are questioning which Chinese telecommunications companies will receive 5G network licenses. China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: CHL) took over 4G network operations from 3G network operators China Telecom Corp. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: CHA) and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. (NYSE: CHU) in 2013, as they were unable to provide the necessary requirements for 4G technology."

"T-Mobile and Sprint have submitted the prospectus to and which are published by the SEC. These are niceties - an over the top gesture to keep everything tidy and legally tight. The Deutsche majority ownership is sufficient to vote approval of the deal and the T-Mobile BOF has given their consent. The great thing about mergers in general and the way the parties are handling this one is that 'all of the cards are put on the table'. American business has become so farcical - many companies issue laughable quarterly and annual reports that hem around substantive issues and hide behind the ruse that they cannot disclose stuff because it would give competitors knowledge of their position. Anyone who has been in business knows that there is a lot of information that can be gotten at 'by hook or by crook'. I can tell stories, as can anyone who has been around the block, about hired agencies and old-fashioned 'detective work' of internal and external analysts so that everybody knows pretty much what everyone else is doing. I did my own groundwork at times... you'd be amazed at what can be found out by visiting cell sites and crews or digging into suppliers of products that are used in deployments. Even retail store managers can be 'bribed' with little more than recognition and insider talk about stuff they are interested in because that is their job. So much is known that digging around in the trenches is not needed.Now with the merger comes an outpouring of information about how the back and forth of the deal occurred and the positioning and coming to terms was arrived at. It came about as it was expected: Softbank/Sprint had to accept a market valuation for the exchange of stock in an all-stock deal while conceding control to Deutsche, the majority owner of the combined entity. That was as it had to be to make sense. Softbank finally came to terms with the deal being the best they would get while the clock might otherwise run out. While that meant giving up control of voting rights and the Newco BOD, the result would likely prove favorable - converting failing Sprint into a part of an almost certain success that should result in a multiple of the initial investment. It probably will also result in sustained business for Softbank's BrightStar and other subsidiaries ... however, that can be viewed as a side-benefit if it shapes up - it's not explicitly talked about as I have seen,"
"Good day like this, we should hit 130."

"The recent headline reads that Verizon is experiencing a higher churn rate due to a fallout with COX media group. This sheds light on the bigger picture: the industry has matured and media is trending over-the-top, OTT, in more diverse ways. The task of offering service grows more complicated as wireless and cable operators layer multiple services on a unified hybrid fiber-cable-wireless network. This provides a double-edged sword: one cutting edge of growth and profits is to sell more services. The flip side is that this needs to cut down costs through higher efficiency and cut through the growing challenge of dealing with media, social networking and information overkill confusion to deliver more for less that is easier to use. Verizon does among the best jobs in managing the software-faced user environment. However, the company is cast in the mold of trying to do everything in order to grow and control revenues. That inevitably leads to friction with providers and competitors, often one in the same. nT-Mobile's path is not without possibility for increased friction as they expand service beyond the core mobile experience. However, the primary theme is to eliminate pain points however that makes sense - through internal developments or partnering. The goal in coming years will be to do more with artificial intelligence both internal to the running of networks and customer facing applications. Most of that cannot be done through any single company. MNOs are not best of breed in apps developments because the best apps spring up in either expert companies or out of the worldwide developments. The market will be shifting more to OTT and ability to manage information easily… do more simply. I think nT-Mobile is well positioned to wrestle share away ... more so from AT&T but also from top-heavy Verizon."

"HIGHER PRICESReducing the number of national wireless carriers from four to three means higher prices across the country.Today, Sprint and T-Mobile are the “maverick” competitors that drive down prices. If they combine, it would create a new incumbent with the ability and incentive to cooperate and collude with the other incumbents. Say goodbye to the “Uncarrier,” and say hello to price hikes.T-Mobile and Sprint have been “maverick” companies, forcing AT&T and Verizon to compete on price and match innovative service offerings. If a competitor is removed, consumer prices could go up by more than 15 percent in many cases, according to one analysis.Higher prices would be felt acutely by prepaid wireless users, since the combined company would control more than 50 percent of that market. Because the prepaid market predominantly serves lower-income customers, this deal would make it even easier for the company to increase prices on the most vulnerable consumers.Don’t take our word for it: In other countries, four-to-three mobile mergers have already resulted in price increases, providing further proof of the harms of consolidation in the mobile voice/broadband market. When two Austrian mobile providers merged in 2012, prices went up an average of 14 to 20 percent – and even more for prepaid users.Eliminating Sprint and T-Mobile as “maverick” competitors would create a new powerhouse with the ability and incentive to cooperate and collude with the other incumbents, causing both consumer and wholesale prices to increase."

"Peon would sure like to know what NY AG James is doing exactly with her extra 2 months she said she needed, and got, to prepare standing up for her power house duopoly donors, and try to kill this merger for them … all on behalf of the best interests of all New Yorkers of course, right? Kind of like AOC infamously killing Amazon's NY plans, where just a stupid selfish bogus personal political move is made at the worst interests & expense of all New Yorkers. Every week, peon wants a general update on how much time/money she (and/or her public office) is working/spending on this case, and let's see what she did that could not have been done next month (original trial date). Peon is real curious to see exactly how much time/money over the extra 2 months she squandered, and the product (or fruits if you will) produced to legally stop this merger and save her fellow New Yorkers from all those harms like deploying 5G faster and to rural areas, less money due to synergies and having for the first time ever a true competitor to the duopoly (ENDING THEIR REIGN ON NY), thousands of more jobs being created, and again forget about Dish, China, National Security, etc. benefits because NY AG James is looking out only, and for all of New Yorkers, right? Sure, and I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge today for $1 too, LOL.As much as I need this merger for my livelihood, if it's against the law and/or hurts country/consumer as a whole (which it doesn't as per FCC & DOJ all is good), then I sacrifice my personal gain for the greater good and cheer you on James. Thus, give James the benefit of the (enormous and nothing but) doubt, another 2 long months after this month, and let's see the dance before the Judge in a public courtroom for all to see. From now until then, not 1 more month on top of all the time since you filed but 3 more long months away, sure hope you're spending your time and people's money wisely on defending and protecting the powerhouse duopoly, and sticking it to the country, companies, investors, and New Yorkers (guess how much of their money is sitting in Dodge & Cox (among other) Funds.James has no case. James has no chance of winning. Is all a tragic waste, isn't it AG James? Go there if you must, just be careful not to fall on your own sword as they say. But please, real anxious peon wants to see how you prepare, made thoughtful legal strategic decisions/moves solely on behalf of New Yorkers, legally have the authority to blow up a Fed approved merger with all of its benefits that at least 1 side and all the other AGs are claiming, AND get a Judge to rule in plaintiffs favor including all the needed appeals (if any) ... and do it! Yea, peon real anxious to see in December, after 2 extra long months you got, all of your legal brilliance in defending the duopoly's reign, and killing this merger on behalf of all the citizens you represent of the great State of New York. Too bad presumably peons wanting a weekly update by the AG's office on this merger, is not as much of a priority to NY AG James as defending the duopoly's reign, and thus peon is not expecting James to oblige. All comes out in the end, and peon is sure to learn something. Peon really can't wait, but will, if peon must. Whatever it takes to end the duopoly's rule, for no doubt that is what is truly best. And no doubt, NY AG James is using her office solely for her own politcal gain, launching a futile fabricated legal witchhunt opposing this merger, and your average Jane/Joe New Yorker to her is nothing but a powerless peon."
AG should put a block on both T Mo and S from releasing any news positive or negative before this merger ends. that guarantees fairness on stock price for both merger
Where is Len been ! I hope he did not short this
Merger will result in about 50% dilution for shareholders.
"The single most important economic justification for the merger is that it will increase the supply vs. market demand for the number of providers and the bandwidth, performance and connectivity. What most determines price in free enterprise markets is how many choices consumers have and how much supply exceeds demand. If there are at least two competitive suppliers who each have products to sell, competitive pressure will drive the price down to a level commensurate to the cost plus a reasonable sustained profit level. By that logic, will the prices get driven down to a level that makes long-term investments less likely? It does not look that way because for at least a few years NewTM and DISH will be the only US (un)carriers to have the needed mix of spectrum bands to deliver 5G Home Broadband and expand the mainstream mobile market share more rapidly than Verizon and AT&T. The new 4G-Advqanced+5G network will be the most efficient and cost-effective network platform. It should be among the most efficient in the world (factoring out labor and other things that vary by country and geography). While the devil could be in the details, the deal with DISH raises the odds of approval to 99,5% IMO. That is probably an unreasonably high vote of confidence because Deutsche Telekom can veto it. However, both DT and DoJ are almost certain to approve because there are no better alternatives likely over the next few years and because if not acted upon the competitive field will shift over time to a less favorable market structure for T-Mobile, Sprint, and DISH, and therefore, for the parent companies."
Why is the P/E so high on T-Mobile compared to Verizon? Seems the price is way over blown here. Sons will look to merge at a much lower valuation

"The State of Texas has settled with T-Mobile/Deutsche Telekom et. al.Texas is an important state behind California and New York. California is one of the states in which the public utilities commission and prominent public advocacy groups have come out in favor of the merger while the State's AG is a party to the lawsuit. I view New York and California as the anchor states. Texas appears to have gotten additional low-price duration. The recent plans to provide low pricing for increased data buckets with follow-on increases (as opposed to industry price-jacking synonymous of AT&T and the cablecos) mean that providing price assurances to the states is somewhat of a foregone conclusion. However, each additional agreement helps cements the confidence that future management of T-Mobile+Sprint won’t renege on the commitments. The packaging and pricing of services can be complex. Even though T-Mobile is known for making it simpler and more inclusive, the fear that stems from the merger is that future management might change the policies to pursue cashing in on the improved market position and financial leverage. As more states have secured commitments, that adds to the exceptional agreement already in place with the FCC and DoJ to reduce the odds that could happen. Of course, the proponents of the merger say that the parties are amply motivated to pursue supply-side economics strategy that goes after gains in market share rather than the Cash Cow strategies pursued by AT&T and Verizon. Why do AT&T and Verizon treat the US mobile market as a cash cow? Because they own over 2/3rds of the business and over 85% of the profits. They cannot use a growth strategy to attract new customers. New T-Mobile can pursue both the single-digit industry growth and taking share away from the Duopolists. Because Verizon and AT&T have over 250 subscribers (multiples of US citizens), NTM can be a success if the company gains a couple percent market share per year. However, NTM has more than mobile to go after: 5G using the combined TMo_Sprint spectra makes it practical to go after fixed fiber-cable-DSL broadband markets both as mobile expansion and as an anchor home-entertainment service package. That adds significantly to the growth prospects over what can be achieved in the mainstream mobile segment."
Missing the CTL boat on CNBC today. TMUS should have done something with them. They need backhaul and no fixed backhaul will work in near term. It about wavelength. The faster the less they travel. It have to have 1000 hops bouncing tower to tower to get back to fiber.

"All of the US mobile stocks have come under pressure due to dispelling of merger fever and lack of further upward momentum in the broader stock market. Attention has turned to what is perceived to be higher degree of competitiveness that will ensue due to the ending of merger talks. However, this awareness is partly misplaced: the merger was going to be a long drawn out affair followed by a period of consolidation. The competitive environment would not have changed by as much as some think IMO. Three+ years out the impact would be increased as networks and devices would be more fully merged to yield cost synergies. I do not think that the merger would have resulted in a big difference in the competitive environment because it would remain in TM+S's interest to continue to fight to gain share, particularly in the more entrenched segments of the business. The industry will continue to change and swallow up surrounding services or work in hybrid combinations. That disruption will lead to competitive friction that would likely keep the pot boiling. From a theoretical standpoint, the convergence of wired and wireless broadband and other segments should lead to much lower cost and simplification that also contributes to efficiencies for the operators and, to a larger degree, for their customers. That has followed the combination of Moore's Law for semiconductors combined/multiplied by Cooper's Law for harnessing of wireless in space-time on a dimensional basis. This leads to roughly the doubling of capacity of wireless networks and devices every 12-18 months. Given the same spectrum, capacity will increase from 10x-100x going forward. Add 'sliced' access schemes using multiple bands and sub-bands of 5G spectrum and the capacity of the wireless portion of hybri wired-wireless networks is slated to grow exponentially over the next 10+ years. What is remarkable about this phenomena is that there is no upper limit yet insight: Just a few years ago the authors of the standards were conceiving of LTE+ 3GPP/XGPP networks achieving about 1.2 Gbps top data rates. That has been pushed higher as it has become increasingly feasible to use higher frequency bands. The large-scale integrated microwave chips and other components make use of higher frequencies cheaper. It makes it possible to combine multiple signal path processing and multiple post signal acquisition 'radio' processing needed to perform to the new 4G+ and 5G or beyond 5G standards. The Cooper's Law piece has been happening for several years already: as networks have grown denser, the use of Smart Antenna Systems that take advantage of multiple antenna elements to produce multiple signal paths that direct signal energy between bases stations and users. This has progressed to the use of higher-order MIMO and multiple-band aggregation methods. It advanced further with 5G including the use of multiple simultaneous bands and higher order MIMO on phones and small network node devices. The network is becoming sliced/tiered in a combination of the frequency and spatial domains to increase re-use factors almost exponentially. Interference mitigation has improved greatly and has moved beyond conventional avoidance of signal interference and more being used to avoid interference or counteract it by use of the multiple frequency channels on an always-best-connected basis. The reason to mention this is because there is a lot of changes coming that spell opportunity for those willing and ready to compete. I think T-mobile likes to compete more than sink back into their easy chairs."

"Companies and investors face multiple choices/avenues they can pursue. Before wireless broadband arrived, operators were trying to figure out how they might extend voice and text services and the limited capabilities of 'Smart Phones' to the broadband arena. Video/TV content services were part of the vision. The conjecture was that operators might either serve as 'dumb pipes' over which services ran over the top (OTT) or that they could provide a large portion of the media as premium services. In other parts of the world, there have been concerted efforts to offer video services as part or in addition to traditional mobile service. That has rarely worked out because content providers have emerged and social media content has thrived. YouTube, NetFlix, Hulu, Amazon, FaceBook, and 100 other sources are available for both TV and movie but also new forms of shared media.That does not mean that there will be only one alternative. There are many ways to slice and dice service offerings to make it fit what people want that can include both free, OTT and operator provided content services. Verizon and AT&T are very unlikely to be able to shape the environment such that they can be the gatekeepers. There is just too much momentum that would force that dam to stay open. T-Mobile benefits from the inherent weakness of AT&T and Verizon's position as 2/3rds marketshare owners in a maturing mainstream market. VZ and T are driven to build walls to protect their sales and profits while TMo can assail the walls with flanking actions rather than direct assaults. That works not because it is based on what T-Mobile wants but it is aligned with what the bulk of consumers want."

TMUS has outperformed our expectations with limited competitive response as its peers seek to maximize FCF. TMUS owns 50% of the sub 6GHz spectrum, but has only 30% wireless market share; this should even out with the C-Band auction but will take several years and this spectrum is inferior to its 2.5GHz. TMUS is building the only true 5G network on 80MHz of this spectrum, giving it a two-year-or-so market advantage from a 10x improvement in speed. We think TMUS trades at an attractive valuation compared to peers."""

"Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) continue to trend together. T-Mobile is up about 1.7% while S is up 1.7%.

If you use a deep-discount broker, one that charges from tenths of a cent per share per trade, you could set up a program-trading algorithm to buy and sell the two stocks in equal dollar proportions based on that gap. Otherwise, it is noise."

Cheech and Chongs let’s make a dope deal headline: AT&T buys DIRECTV for $48.5 billion￼.T-Mobile buys Sprint for￼ $26.5 billion.
THE MERGER is FAILING. Make a deal for backhaul for spectrum. CTL is the biggest and the most friendly to TMUS as the CFO worked there. TMUS buys backhaul right now from them and there have been rumors about buying them. I can only think TMUS does not want to make deal with CTL as they want to merge later to get backhaul.

"A basic reason that COVID-19 will lock-down the US economy longer than it should is the lack of testing and a accounting of infected has made it impossible to target what population centers should be locked down, and who can return to work to get 'America working again'. Without hard data the government has resorted to a shot-gun approach: requiring all localities to go into a state of lock down in which healthy workers a fired or put on furlough. That is contrasted with the way China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and many other places have responded: they led with mass testing programs. The USA has not used the national crisis powers to suspend intellectual property rights (IPR) for the manufacture of critical supplies. Instead we use the government sanctioning of specific businesses. That has resulted in higher prices and continued limited suppliers for testing kits, respirators, and other critical supplies. I consulted on patents and IPR and firmly believe in upholding the rights of patent holders. However, in times of national emergencies when the US and world economy is at risk, a suspension of those rights makes sense IMO. Get the job done and then figure out where the chips fall once the dust settles.The USA plans to FailThe American medical system puts the emphasis on the rights of the producers. I agree with allowing the free enterprise system to manage the economy as much as is feasible. However, when the national trust is given to the private sector without a clear line of responsibility, including torts laws enforcement, human idiots and organizations will abuse it. That understanding should come with the territory. Thousands of doctors offices, clinics and hospitals have been aware of the posilbility of a pandemic including those worse than COVID-19 yet failed to invest the relatively modest sums needed to put in a rapid response. The US system talked a big story but failed to follow through. Individual doctors and administrators are to blame for ignoring the fact that with ownership in a business comes responsibility to handle the monopoly power entrusted to them, IMO. TCOVID-19 will have a longer term impact because a shot-gun approach had to be taken due to the failure for the world's most costly medical system to step up to their individual and joint responsibility. It was their jobs, they failed the American public.Because of the situation much of the country went into lock-down mode because they it could not be determined which locations and individuals needed to be isolated. The problem will persist longer than it has in the better organized parts of the world because the spread of the diesease is from areas of high population density to lower and more remote areas. Congress is to blame by allowing the industry lobbyists to draft the legislation that become laws. The US public is to blame because of belief in fairy tales - white witches who will show up to absolve us from following through with the big talk to force government to take decisive action."

"So you sell TMUS and buy T why you can still get in and lock your shares of T up with long term sell orders over $60 to start and you get your shares of T before April 5-9 2021 you will get the dividend or you can get them after and you will get the next dividend T Mobile you will just get more and more PAIN LOL,LOL,LOL Until even DEM wit Joe knows he has to shut down T Mobile and their one world order before it's to late. That is why the Government is now using T network LOL,LOL,LOL"
Tmus is working 24/7 to build cheep 5G for all . Tmus is going to swallow the market . you should have some and hold . good luck
"$T is mismanaged Company, relative to $TMUS. It has $172,000,000,000 Debt. Cost of Debt is Huge. Current ratio is below a $1 it is a read flag, Bankruptcy bound. At&T will need to cut it's 7.30% dividend, to start paying for its debt. $T needs to restructure itself, if it wants to survive.. They need to reinvent itself. Otherwise it will collapse."
How high can this go? Aug 21 115 call.... will it be underwater? thanks.
"The consensus of financial analyst forecasts shows a price target for TMUS at 72 (Zacks) and an average rating of buy+. The trend in the forecasts has been positive with more upward revisions than downward, seeing the average estimates moving higher over the past three months. Some of this could be expected due to better than forecast results and a raising of forward guidance during the last quarter. If can take up to a few weeks for all financial analysts to revise their assessments. It is also common for analysts to first provide guidance to their customers before releasing it publicly and for the tallying of revisions to take some time. TMUS is likely to move higher over the next 12 months so long as the trends stay in place or bend upward."

Great chance to get in or add with this little dip!
"At end of day, the less masa owns of this the better!"

"Why are T-Mobile and Sprint down today? Sprint was down about 6% in morning trading today (Thursday, Feb 1st) while TMUS is down almost 2%. This is not an unusual percentage move for TMUS, but it may have to do with recent quarterly reports by Verizon and AT&T that show that they are not losing much ground to their smaller competitors. The numbers are not as clear-cut as figuring the net gains and losses for core and pre-paid plan subscribers. The numbers are shifting as consumers ask for more value for their money and the shift to over-the-top video services over broadband connections vs. traditional cable-TV and satellite packages. The topline sales have stalled because of lower overall package pricing from the more highly integrated market behemoths. AT&T reported a gain of over 300k branded monthly subscribers while losing core DTV satellite subscribers who have switched to OTT service. Despite the gains being made by Verizon and AT&T represent a market shift that has resulted in stalled topline sales, the fact that the two BORGE Empire operators are not seeing a loss of overall marketshare to their two junkyard dog competitors adds to the concerns of market and scale disadvantages for Sprint and T-Mobile.As I conjectured, Sprint may be losing subscribers. As the top three competitors, including T-Mo, have reported their subscriber numbers, it looks very doubtful that Sprint's numbers can be met. Something has to give - all four cannot have gained the number of subscribers reported and forecast."
This is a $120 value ... most people are using Tmobile ... cutting the wires
"Typical hedge fund BS. TMUS obtains ZERO benefit by getting entangled with a mindless hardwired cable company that can't even kill its own competition in ATT. Think about it. Here is Comcast with a big Pipe and ATT with DSL that is limited in actual throughput to about 25 mbps max and less with a long cable run. Meanwhile Comcast doesn't open the throttle and lower the prices to demolish ATT. As a topper Comcast service remains notorious. Now compare with TMUS. It is only a matter of time before wireless fiber gets rocking. Even at present speed, the TMUS phone tethering is very good.. There are a lot of new strategies such as PCell that make wireless MUCH more attractive. Cable is now 500 channels of nothing. People are watching less TV because its garbage. Over the air radio is dying. Brick and mortar retail is dissolving. Handhelds are getting more powerful but they have a lot of limitations. Nobody wants to write a letter or essay on a handheld device. Eventually hat will change but don't expect Microstuffy to lead the way. Handheld units will eventually work like the echo in which you can carry on a conversation. TMUS is more valuable real estate than any cable company. The worst possible story would be ATT trying to buy TMUS. That is a clash of cultures that would destroy the company."
"Why SENS is so Revolutionary technology If you truly believe SENSEONIC is going to revolutionize CGM technology in a few years, then hold for long term. It is high risk, but very high reward stock. It could easily 30X from here, don’t pay attention to constant gyrations in the market. I always get inspiration from this Biomedical scientist who has been long term holder of Senseonic. If anyone would knows about CGM technology, it would be Biomedical scientist. He is also Founder and CEO of FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond.“"
If by any chance this merger fails or drags out to long without any break up fees Sprint really has the best chance to to search other options that most likely will see a better share price then what TMUS has offered. Dish is still needing to do something soon and put that Spectrum they have to use.All roads point to Sprint giving up spectrum and Boost not sure what Pinky is thrown in but haven't read anything on that issue.One other thing everyone seems to forgot was the partnership Sprint and Dish entered into just after Dish stepped back during the bidding for not only Sprint but also Clearwire..As Son said there are other options on the table as they entered this merger with No Break up feeDish could offer a all stock deal such as TMUS did but even sweeten the pot a little .May not be the plan A Son was looking for but could workout also
I wouldnt be suprise with closing green!! No reason TMUS should be done today with good ER.
Future $200 stock!

BOOM!!!! GAME OVER.... Going higher! WallStreetBets!
"AMZN afraid of the edge network according to Bloomberg, so buying DISH for spectrum and CTL largest Fiber edge provider appears to make those buyout rumors true."
"TMUS, S, SFTBY remain buy-accumulate regardless of Congressional hearings and other stuff. The merger is now 'on skids' to slide through approvals. That is not to say that Legere, et al may not have more assurances to make. T-Mobile, Sprint and their majority owning parent companies should be very willing to provide assurances. They have a creative opportunity that seldom comes along. And they are grossly well-rewarded pig farmers."
"What is TMo's spectrum position?T-Mobile has close to the same mix of available spectrum as Verizon, the US consumer market leader that had, for years, been recognized as having the best network coverage and reliability. However, T-Mobile has arrived at the situation at a juncture that it can deploy fresh networks, including the new 600 MHz band. Neville Ray has blogged that TMo will deploy 5G in the band. Using some of the advances of 5G in the low-band spectrum is made difficult. 5G includes new and improved methods to do beamforming of higher-order MIMO signals and multiple-device complimentary signaling. The great thing about low-band spectrum is signals travel far and through and around obstructions better than mid and high-band frequencies. However, that causes signal paths to overlap, causing more interference. Signals scatter and bend as well and penetrate and travel further. That makes differentiating signals harder in real-world environments.However, the fact that T-Mobile has about half as many customers as Verizon works in the company's favor as they scale up their networks with 4G-5G. 5G improves on the number of bands that can be aggregated and allows multiple simultaneous band operation. That provides greater flexibility to render the low, mid, and (soon) high-bands as an adaptive 'network of networks'. For example, T-Mobile can use the 600-700MHz spectrum for wide-area coverage for rural and IoT applications while using the same band as a broad-coverage overlay network while mid-band is used for higher bandwidth in urban areas. As 3.5 GHz and other high (or as reclassified as being part of the new 5G mid-band designation), are available, the role of 600-700 Mhz and mid-band can shift. This allows T-Mobile to plan more effectively based on market needs rather than on 'rip and replace' or capital replacement cost restraints. 5G provides a more robust application environment for operators to build their networks more 'organically' based more on emerging market needs rather than as a more speculative bet on unknown market developments.There are also differences in how the two companies spectrum is metered out over the country. I think T-Mobile has the overall better position because of an advantage of having more 'greenfield' spectrum at an opportune time and due to a geographic advantage in depth of coverage of the mid-band. Coverage of major metro regions is deeper. Combined with having lower user density, T-Mo has more room to offer high bandwidth and compete for cable replacement before the major push occurs to use 3.5 GHz+ and mmWave. Company executives are often eyeball-deep in BS lalaland. As a rule, you can't trust them farther than you can throw them in order to be reasonably safe. However, Neville and others do not have to spread it on thick because they have crafted a good position in the spectrum at an opportune time to intelligently exploit the robustness of 4G-5G and the harnessing of higher frequency bands into the mobile environment."

"""TRUSTING SPRINT AND T-MOBILE WITH AMERICAN JOBS IS LIKE TRUSTING A VAMPIRE AT A BLOOD BANK""Washington, D.C. - During today's U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology hearing on the T-Mobile/Sprint merger, witnesses raising concerns about the proposed merger offered detailed and extensive documentation and analysis, while merger supporters relied on vague and unsubstantiated claims.Chris Shelton, President of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), delivered testimony during the hearing that concluded as follows: ""30,000 fewer jobs. Lower wages by as much as $3,000 per year. Disproportionate harm to low-income communities. Higher prices for all consumers. All to help a state-owned German company and a Japanese billionaire make more money. Members of the Committee, that is not in the public interest.""President Shelton's testimony also captured why the testimony and related jobs, consumer, and rural pledges of T-Mobile CEO and President John Legere and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure should be viewed with a skeptical eye: ""Without binding and enforceable commitments – and I mean commitments that have no loopholes – such promises are just cheap sales talk and are easily broken. ...Trusting Sprint and T-Mobile with American jobs is like trusting a vampire at a blood bank. These are two of the worst companies in the United States when it comes to labor law and the treatment of workers. In recent years, T-Mobile has been charged with more labor law violations per worker than even Walmart.""Shelton highlighted T-Mobile's track record of buying companies and then cutting jobs, noting the aftermath and harm of T-Mobile's 2018 acquisition of Iowa Wireless (the subject of a CWA report, Disrupting Rural Wireless, released this week). As Shelton noted, ""After it acquired Iowa Wireless in 2018, it closed all iWireless call centers and more than 90 percent of its retail locations. It closed every single store in rural Iowa.""In his opening remarks, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) noted, ""As part of [the Committee's] oversight responsibility, we must make sure that the FCC is carefully reviewing the facts and keeping consumers' best interests in mind when deciding the fate of the merger.""Members of Congress expressed skepticism about the companies' claims during the hearing, pressing T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure on jobs, consumer prices, rural buildout, and their commitment to the federal lifeline program that helps low-income consumers access critical telecommunications services.As Subcommittee Chairman Mike Doyle (D-Penn.), said in his opening statement, ""I've seen a lot of mergers in this industry and others, and it's hard to think of one where consolidation didn't result in people losing their jobs, prices going up, and innovation being stifled.""Read a copy of CWA President Chris Shelton's written testimony to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology of the Energy and Commerce CommitteeRead CWA's detailed economic analysis on why the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger would eliminate 30,000 jobs (find a state-by-state breakdown of projected retail job loss here)Read the February 2019 CWA report, Disrupting Rural Wireless, explaining why T-Mobile's 2018 acquisition of Iowa Wireless (""iWireless"") undercuts the claim that the T-Mobile/Sprint merger would benefit rural America and the small businesses that serve as authorized dealers for T-Mobile and Sprint servicesRead the December 2018 report, Labor Market Impact of the Proposed Sprint–T-Mobile Merger, by the Economic Policy Institute and the Roosevelt Institute, which found that reducing the number of wireless carriers from four to three would reduce retail wireless workers' wages by up to $3,276 per year."

"One interesting tidbit from Nokia's 20-F is that they used an EUR to USD exchange rate of 1 EUR = $1.1422. As an example, they reported 21.852B EUR in revenue and converted to USD as $24.959B. Today the EUR to USD exchange rate is 1 EUR = $1.1918 which would translate from 21.852B EUR to $26.043B. (A $1.084B increase)The EUR to USD exchange rate is fast approaching a 5 year high of 1 EUR = $1.2555 and based on all the Gov't spending in the US, it's likely that the value of the dollar will continue to fall. With that being said, the 21.852B EUR in 2020 revenue would translate to $27.435B ( A $2.476B increase) assuming flat revenue in 2021. I don't expect flat revenue in 2021 and the news about $TMUS only increases my optimism.My advice: Start watching the EUR to USD exchange rates and it's impact on Nokia Financials."

"Why is it down after hours , any news"
"I come from AT&T! T-mobile, you will fail to cover 99% of 5G in the end and then get split into 2 pieces again. your 5G current coverage doesn't mean anything because the current 5G is not real 5G. real 5G is now coming and you have to pour ur fund to install all the new cables again! bye bye"
US in a delima. Approve the merger we need to strip tmo down and create a 4th carrier. Amazon? What about monopoly issues? Reject the merger and Sprint goes bankrupt and tmo buys up pieces on them anyway. And all those states that are complaining will have to explain to business leaders that Sprint defaults on billions what happen. States will have massive layoffs to deal with. There are not many good options but the best one is an approved merger. The times are changing and if the US falls behind on 5G rollout will be a huge mistake.

"I can't believe how far the wireless industry has been driven to hype the prospects for 5G as if it will be a big initial impact. The suppliers are going to further extremes than for 3G or 4G. The impact of 3G turned out to be, if anything, underrated: it was the generation that led to worldwide adoption on a grand scale, catapulting on top of the momentum of 2G with the first true data platform. The adoption of 3G exceeded most expectations, resulting in over 3 billion users. 4G and the continued uptake of 3G pushed that momentum further. With the conversion of 4G to 4G-Advanced, wireless has entered into the era of 'wireless broadband everywhere' that is limited only by the density of cells and core network capacities. 4G-A can and is already delivering the home broadband replacement. 5G expands that capability into new frontiers. However, those new frontiers do not poof into existence with the wave of a wand. It will take a new wave of evolution not just in the network but the applications, devices, and the habituation of users to the new uses. The hype machine never mentions that the pupae do not become the magnificent butterfly overnight. First, they must be laid, mature, and then unfold their wings. T-Mobile, as flamboyant a character as their CEO, John Legere is (love him), has taken the most conservative approach to their imaging of 5G. They have correctly said that they will use 4G-Advanced to deliver early advantages of combined low-mid-high band spectra use including home broadband.The reason why T-Mobile is not hyping 5g as much is that they have a very clear competitive advantage over Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint (as a stand-alone). The combination of spectra of T-Mobile and Sprint would have a clear market advantage if they were somehow prevented from making use of 5G altogether for the first few years of the merger. That fact, and I believe it is a fact, shows how much 5G is being hyped out of proportion and immediacy. Take one 'for instance': T-Mobile introduced a new IoT offering that uses narrowband 700 MHz. They are using parts of the band that had been reserved as buffers to avoid interference with nearby bands. Among the advances made with LTE is better ability to use spectra without causing interference, That allows freeing up the 'guard bands' for commercial use. IoT fits well in the small bandwidth channels because most IoT is low-bandwidth and low power. That means it is less prone to cause interference. Therefore, T-Mobile did not make the false claim similar to AT&T that they were using 5G-unhuh, (the actual name is some other lie). T-Mo says they are using 4G-Advanced - in other words, let the service, price speak for themselves."

"Teh big three China mobile operators have jointly announced the rollout of the first phase of 5G deployments: A combined 130,000 5G base stations by year end.All three operators, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom announced similar plans that provide higher broadband data tiers starting with 30 GB at $19/month and going up to 300 GB for $85/mn. The companies provide a 30% discount to long term customers and allow customers to buy the higher data bucket plans now while using their existing phones on the 4G network. T-Mobile might pursue a similar price strategy: while not offering lower rates, T-Mo might offer similar high buckets for use by any 4G or new 5G mobile or fixed device. That would result in customers being able to have better mobile broadband or pay for a higher data plan that allows replacement of cable, DSL or fiber service. Since the average US cable household consumes 270 GB of bandwidth per month. The average individual use is about 110 GB (2.7 persons per household)."
I might jump in at 120 ! Sold my possible around 115 bought Apple from 106 to 110 ! TMus is going to skyrocket! Hang in there longs
"Can cable companies take advantage of their extensive fiber optic and (potentially) Gigabit cable networks to take mobile network marketshare from the top 4 US operators?Thus far, the mobile service market is shaping up to deny easy entry by any cable, satellite or another market entrant. The churn rate for mobile subscribers has been trending down over the past several years and is not reported as under 1% for Verizon and T-Mobile and around the 1% figure for AT&T and Sprint. The MVNO, mobile virtual network operator, sub-market has shrunk in importance. MVNOs were once thought a threat to direct subscriber business. That means that only a small percentage of subscribers change from one operator to another. Any new entrant faces the challenge of competing to grab a piece of a shrunken pie or create such a compelling value proposition that it shakes up the multi-year status quo. The cable companies have only recently started to push mobile service plans via their MVNO relationship with Verizon. About the only thing that is known yet is that they do not appear to be rocking the status quo - they are not going gangbusters. And MVNO sales still result in revenue made by Verizon. Even though that is less profitable, that remains revenue going into VZ that supports their overall position as the network provider."
"Teamrep you said this merger was sure thing and the states didnt matter and DOJ would not force a 4th carrier. It appears like Tmobile ATT debacle. The problem with this merger Sprint wins on the exit terms for the merger. The deal is going to done because John makes his $100M for getting it done. The problem is every shareholder will get screwed on the deal, because their will be 4th carrier. TMUS needs to choose wisely who that will be. All I see is Big cable and Amazon lurking. All will make TMUS a thing of the past. Besides what you said about using wireless as the backhaul it doesn't work yet and all the hops would create latency. TMUS weakness is FTTH to compete with ATT / VZ. They would spin those units off if they didnt need them."
The vision fund of Softbank will buy out T-Mob
Where is everyone complaining that this is up?
this should be up by at least 5%
"What will be the ""Wireless Broadband Revolution"" dynasty?Will it become one more closed empire that magnifies the greed factor of human progression to self-annihilation or a template for a new order of social enterprise and social self-awareness that helps 'saves us' (society beyond the stone age subsistence level) from a calamitous fate?Wireless plays a singular role in the whole of our existence on this planet. Are those who are wielding the power cognitive of their role?"
"(NASDAQ: TMUS) (formally T-Mobile US), two of America's largest wireless carriers, have gone in opposite directions over the past three years. AT&T's stock price tumbled about 20% in that three-year stretch as it struggled with its ongoing loss of pay TV users, tough competition in the wireless market, and its costly and unwieldy takeover of Time Warner. T-Mobile's stock price more than doubled as it pulled wireless subscribers away from AT&T and Verizon (NYSE: VZ)."
"Bellevue, Washington — July 9, 2020 — Kansas City is getting another splash of magenta! T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) today unveiled details for T-Mobile Center, formerly Sprint Center, reinforcing its commitment to the community of Kansas City. A staple in Kansas City since 2007, the newly named T-Mobile Center will serve up awesome events through 2032, along with special perks for T-Mobile customers and upgrades for everyone in the coming years."
Not only is Starlink planning to sell broadband but also some kind of phone service.
How low will it drop with delusion
Oh Poop what happened to Pinky .. Wifi go down ???
"For TMUS market cap to catch up to VZ & ATT, the stock needs to basically double from here!"

Another dip#$%$ analyst with a scare tactic projection. I?m with Buffet and refuse to move a single share!
"The perception has been that a deal would hinge on regulatory approvals. The T-Mobile+Sprint merger never got past the starting gate to test what the DOJ and FCC decision would be.Early this year, many were claiming that the Trump administration would lead to easy approval and with that out of the way, Sprint would be acquired at a premium price. It turns out to not be that simple: The deal has failed because Sprint's parent company could not agree with Deutsche and T-Mobile about the deal structure, namely, how much participation and control Softbank would have in the new company. The stock ratio was not the major sticking point. That was said to have been narrowed down to a range of around 6.50-7.50. Softbank's BOD balked because they wanted Softbank to remain involved.Deutsche/T-Mobile did not have to concede control or pay a premium so they stuck to their guns. Why concede to Softbank's terms when the likely course of events will result in T-Mobile continuing to grow while Sprint continues to, at best, tread water, at worst lose marketshare to T-Mobile that leads to being able to acquire the company at a lower future price.What about the prospects for Sprint to partner with Altice? That is the best new wrinkle Sprint has been able to put together recently. The marriage between fiber-cable hybrid networks and mobile broadband networks has long been considered as a way to forge a bridge between the two that can deliver capital-efficient broadband coverage everywhere within the cable operator's footprint. Sprint-Softbank should be able to put together a bang-up network partnered with Altice. The obvious problem for Sprint is that Altice has only 3.5 million subscribers. Even while that has the potential to improve service beyond the homes by providing 4G-5G signals to the surrounding 500-2,500 meter vicinity, the scale is too small to impact Sprint's trajectory by itself. What I'm sure Masa Son hopes to see happen is for the Altice partnership to prove out the business concept of marrying of Sprint (a mobile operator) with a hybrid fiber-cable company that can then entice Comcast and/or Charter to partner with Sprint.Sprint does not necessarily need to merge with T-Mobile or a cable company to find a modicum of success. What it needs first and foremost is to improve the bang per buck of deployment of their 2.5 GHz spectrum while alleviating the higher frequency shortcomings. The marriage with a cable company provides more leverage for Sprint than it would for any other US operator due to those advantages/fixes. What happens to Sprint sans the merger? It will most likely be less of a factor going forward. Many have been saying that Sprint causes the field to be more competitive, causing T-Mobile problems. Realy? Sprint has been giving service away for a year to lure Verizon subscribes and offering half-off gimmic pricing and low regular rates. However, Sprint has lost marketshare and sales have declined as a result. That makes the argument for what Sprint will do now suspect: are they going to lower prices further even though past attempts have not stimulated sales to grow? Will offering free service lure customers it failed to do in the past? While it seems troublesome, it was not reflected in Sprint's results. It was not a reason for T-Mobile to acquire Sprintsy wintsy.T-Mobile can continue on the path it is on. They face being a smaller company than chief rivals Verizon and AT&T but that has worked as much to their advantage than against it because the spectrum mix and excellent job Neville's teams have been doing have helped to close the scale efficiency gap. Meanwhile, John Legere and his teams have helped close the gap in marketing, retail, device supply chain, customer service, and other areas that are normally at a disadvantage in a smaller scale operation.

"Craporina. the Internet Stock Board Cleaning Service report:* John Legere is committed to staying in the CEO spot at least until he reaches age 65 in four years. He said he has no intention of retiring sooner.* The FCC has decided in favor while DOJ decision on the merger remains pending. * DOJ Antitrust Division (ATR) wants structural market reforms as has been the wish for several years. * Some positive structural changes are occurring because markets of wired and wireless broadband and media networks are converging. * DOJ ATR has reportedly pressed for more and longer-lasting commitments but specifics have not been made public.* The spin-out of Sprint spectrum is not in itself a structural change. A spectrum that has not been built out or is only of one band cannot compete in the market and thus has no impact on the market structure by itself. For example, DISH has what can be considered to be a sufficient range of spectra to build a competitive network and take on the mobile operators. but since that would take about $90 billion to achieve nationwide coverage and bandwidth that competes with the leaders and DISH would be forced to sell at lower prices to attract customers, the economics cannot work out. The same general scenario applies to cable companies or like Amazon. The result is that no company will build out a nationwide network to compete head-to-head because that would be financial suicide. Craig is right about that piece: 'they would have to be crazy'.* Amazon has said in the past that the company intends to get involved in 5G for AWS cloud services. They almost have to. * Amazon and Google do not have to get into wireless for consumer markets except if they target products that require 5G capabilities the mobile carriers do not plan to fulfill or that they wish to compete with the carriers for the same or overlapping markets. * Amazon may wish to buy Boost Mobile in order to sell packaged services that offer more protection against future competition and aggregation. * Amazon may want to buy Boost Mobile in order to work closely with New T-Mobile which will have the most extensive 'real 5G' network including 5G Home broadband. * Companies in leadership positions often want to work with companies set to take the leadership position in the underlying technology or the mode of delivery."

"Does T-Mobile really want to merge with Sprint as strongly as they say? Is T-Mobile the 'Un-Carrier'? What does that mean anyway? Offering NetFlix as part of the package? Providing software number porting? Neat tricks that at a given point in time are pushing the envelope mostly because nobody had offered them yet. But those mean diddly squat in the long run in terms of whether T-Mobile is Un anything. Being consumer oriented goes against the grain of competitors because the US cable and wireless industry have become arrogant pigs. AT&T, Comcast, Charter, etc. are easy targets for T-Mobile to go after because they treat their customers as if they are the fine print on the quarterly reports... to be milked for every penny. But being consumer friendly does nothing to change the monopolistic trend in industry structure. It does not address the merging of wired BB and wireless BB that broadens real competition. T-Mobile+Sprint may not gain approval if all Legere offers is promises to hire more bodies for a few years. Frankly, I don't think the government should be telling business to hire or fire people. That is socialism or worse. However, the wireless industry is a state-sanctioned monopoly over an essential resource that has run up control over multiple segments of media, broadband, IT/cloud, IoT, security, as well as the big mainstream consumer markets. The wireless industry IS THE BORG - Resistance if fultile, you will be assimilated!Maybe John Legere is such a great song and dance man that he can smooze the regulators and ther rest of government to gain approval without having to offer a short-range leg up to the cablecos. I do not see how that would meet the objectives the DOJ says they want, but I'm not the one 'up front and center' trying to sell it to them.. We will see how this plays out."
What do I do with the tmusr shared that showed up in my acct? I got one for each tmus share I owned
"What concessions do corporations have to give back to the American people for their monopolies? The situation is phrased as if the DOJ is the bad cop that is taking away the rights of corporate 'individuals' (as the law treats them)v and those fortunate enough to own stock or be vested insiders. However, that is a blatant lie.The mobile operators and their equity and debt investors have always known that they were agreeing to a deal with the government that is supposedly looking out for the public interest... beyond the next quarter or three years. The government agreed to free up spectrum, forcing broadcasters, satellite, military, maritime, medical, and all other users to vacate so that the deficit-busting government could auction it off as long-term leases.This is not a situation where there were no strings attached. There was not agreement that if the monopolists grew to dominate the world of communications as was the motivating factor, that the antitrust rules and regulations would no longer matter. If you think about the implications, quite the opposit should be taking place: the DOJ should recognize that the goals of establishing nationwide networks that most Amricans and organizations could afford to use has been accomplished and, therefore, not greater deviations from the laws that govern (are supposed to govern) every other business and individual who lives in America is needed or should be allowed. ""We gave concessions of three years."" Hang your bloody #$%$."
"The battle has just begun. I really think T-Mobile buys Sprint, then either Disney or Nexflx's buys Tmobile. It's Mobile, mobile, mobile.......Netflix has the content Tmobile has the mobile customers. This is the only way to compete with AT&T. Thoughts....."
"===11/10/2020==$155 price target===> Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft raised the firm's price target on T-Mobile to $155 from $150 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the company's Q3 results. The analyst believes T-Mobile remains the best multi-year free cash flow growth story in wireless, ""with multiple levers for value creation."""
"This appears to be the same shakeout as last week, trigger the stop loss sales and create fear, buy the fear, sell the news. TMUS is solid, this will go much higher after carniage is done here."
I have no idea why this stock isn't at $75 yet.
when it becomes available in my area I'm considering switching to T-Mobile wireless home broadband I currently have spectrum but they are very abusive with their prices.In other news the new administration is considering finishing the border wall; smart and unbelievable.
It’s fake news to help get the merger done. Legere isn’t going anywhere. If anything he is leveraging the idea of him leaving to get a much better compensation package post merger.
Ouch..........
"The market may be showing early signs of rebound following, by the degree of the sell-off if not technical formation and clear momentum, a market reversal is underway.What does that mean... 'market reversal is underway'? It means that the momentum to the downside is extreme from a short-term cash-flow/valuation perspective. The market will reverse, within a week IMO. This can take alternative patterns. I have ideas on how it will occur but that is not what I would bet on. The ideas you have are guidance, not what you base each move on. The market is a reactive stew, not something you can predispose precisely. I do have good record for picking moves in the market and these stocks but I do not say stuff like 'buy at 80.90 or buy now and become an idiot perpetual long. Learn the methods.Use the tools.Try not to be brain dead."
why did all the posts go!!!!!!
Sell and buy AT&T or VZ. At least they offer a dividend lol.
"Here’s what’s creating a buying opportunity today As TMUS shares dip. Net income in the December quarter was $750 million or 60 cents per share compared with $751 million or 87 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The performance reflects an increase in expenses owing to the Sprint merger, including merger-related costs, which were partly offset by higher revenues. Earnings per share (EPS) decreased due to lower net income and a higher number of outstanding shares as a result of the merger."
"RSI in the 30s, approaching way oversold....50 day moving average is at $130...200 day moving average is $116. If it goes below $120, BACK UP THE TRUCK!"
its funny to see these chump guys that comment here that says the merger wont happen. regardless if it happens or not it wont effect what Tmo is doing and continue to dominate the industry. this stock and company is setup up because its hitting on all marketing towards every demographic and not just one specific one. Merger is 50/50 it will benefit the customer and shareholders.
$120 tomorrow. PRINTED!!!
GasBag due up soon on Fox Business....More on State AGs assault on @TMobile - @sprint merger and what i mean foreshadow NOW @FoxBusiness @TeamCavuto $TMUS $S
CTL changed the rules recently so that companies with more than 5% ownership could not have a controlling vote. The rumor is Sunit Patel set this up to buy into CTL and not be seen as a merger and mess up the Sprint merger. They needed this piece for 5G backhaul.
"Funny how the opinions of talking heads and some in the financial community waffle with each bend of the merger evaluation river. The media and the majority of analysts, including analysts that had been following T-Mobile gave the deal no better than 50:50 odds when it started out. 50:50 is like saying ""I dunno, maybe it's like flipping a coin"".As the merger made it past the preliminary review/veto stage, the consensus increased the odds. Then when it encountered the expected opposition by states and municipalities at the local venue and competitors, labor unions, WISPs, rural wireless and public interest organizations, the sentiment pushed the odds lower. Behind the state of the public discourse, shares of TMUS, S and SFTBY have shown net accumulation has occurred: leading funds increased positions and short interest has moved down. This has shown that the opposition was not registering as much with the 'professional' level investor as it was with the retail investor. Most of the review process that will be exposed to the public before a decision is made has already taken place. The cards are almost all on the table. Each side of the merger arguments and facts have been put forward with no 'new news' emerging since this process began last year. That statement may appear to be out of place, however, the situation of the ICT industry and these companies has not changed. Since the process started, the cablecos have added wireless subscribers, VZ and T have modified their approach to 5G but not radially altered it, and Sprint's fate has continued to look in dire need of the merger.Now the consensus analyst opinion on the merger has increased.. after the waffling."
"yesterday went to Sprint, the representative told me Trump wants the merger"
"Friday..... “All 16 banks and has received no notice on the banks’ unpreparedness to support the transaction.”IMO, Certainly 2-3 of them might not be able to hold up their end of the bargain now."
Call options activity is huge. Shareholders do not hold. Sell and take profits and rebuy later.
Its matter of time when few states start dropping out of the lawsuit
Fox reporting TMUS/Sprint deal could be undone?! WTH is this all about?...Dish/Boost/Adderton drama looks like.
"tmus/the magenta one have been shockingly quiet,im actually wondering if something is brewing deal or perhaps something for shareholders.legere has been way to quiet"
TMUS shareholders would be diluted by over 430 million shares at current SP. WOW!
Bought a few more this week $60s-$70s
"With most other stocks making new highs, including junk stocks with no earnings, TMUS is one of the best buys in the market today. We're due for a pop!"
"Nothing has changed TMUS still needs to go a lot LOWER don't fight the fall or you will lose all your money. Just remember to only sell any move higher ,before Wall Street does or you will get left holding the bag. LOL Just remember to SAY OH NO down TMUS goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
100 Buckaroos!!! Wow!
"Can retail investors benefit from financial analysts forecasts and price targets?Yes. However, it is important to know that financial analysts come in multiple flavors: some are what I call ANALysts... anal retentive spreadsheet pluggers and (financial) industry suck-ups. Some are 'real analysts' who dig into the underlying causes for company success, That dig takes the wisdom gained by experience and hard work. Analysts consensus forecasts are compiled and reported by a number of sources including Zack's. It is easy for investors to find these on the web and refer back to them over time. What is more important than where the forecasts are at the moment is whether they are trending up or down, by how much, and whether they are consistent with your understanding of the stock. A caveat is borne in the saying ""Analysts tend to be wrong at the start, wrong at the end, but right in the middle"". This is where having some understanding of what the individual analysts are saying: the ANALysts build their understanding based on what management (the naturally borne company salespersons) tell them, and the plugging of numbers into spreadsheets that are used to project forward results mechanically. The 'real analysts' look at the figures but also at what is driving the competitive field forward over time in a more thoughtful way to come up with 'real forecasts'. Investors can't know what these analysts know and how they think but they can see their track records to know the odds of them being right.TMUS and S forecasts have been moving up over the past 12+ months. The basic trends are reasonably favorable despite the risk that the merger won't be approved. The majority of risk is with Sprint (S) and, therefore also with its patent Softbank (SFTBY). The current price of S reflects about a 10% discount because of that. Therefore, investing in a portfolio of the companies makes more sense than investing in S IMO. Investing in TMUS has some risk that if the merger is turned down it could move lower. However, the basic factors that have driven TMUS higher are unlikely to change because of that. It is more a question the merger being a positive factor that would be taken away. Even so, the two companies have grown closer together because they gain from sharing access to networks and devices regardless of whether that is achieved through partnering or merging."
"The Trump administration has been a factor in the growing divide between US allies, including Germany and the UK policies on wireless security and our national policy of excluding Huawei and ZTE from sales of network equipment and devices. The use of Huawei equipment in T-Mobile and Sprint networks has become a hot potato that Legere, Claure and others have taken steps to avoid. It is 'not our battle' to try to set the record straight that while Huawei was found guilty of company espionage, that the theft of 'robot' technology was far less impactful or glamorous than hyped in the media.The US has many tough issues to deal with, not the least of which is the growing national debt coupled to the disparity between the coastal economic zones and middle America. There is the issue of America having the role of 'policeman to the world' and blundering into endless, meaningless conflicts. These big issues find the US at odds with our allies, sometimes rightly so IMO: many in Europe view the US as having caused more problems in the Middle East than it has helped to fix, leading to massive migration of people to the EU and elsewhere. If you have traveled in the continental EU and UK in recent years, you may understand how thinking has changed and polarized. Huawei is well on the way to becoming the world's largest infrastructure equipment/systems supplier. There is no government that can change that, certainly not the USA. The US has not been a big user of Chinese supplied infrastructure and operators have removed what little they had installed. That leaves little leverage to diminish Huawei's rise except to twist the arms of our allies regulators. But that is not working because the alleged security threat has not been found by the German, UK, or any other country. We can blame them for trying to gain an edge in devices to supply to operators, including the targeted T-Mobile, but calling that out as a reason to avoid them all together looks childish to our allies. They want to buy stuff they do not make at good prices if it suits their needs. It is the same thing T-Mobile and other US operators want but they cannot say so because it has become a political hot potato.If I take the point of view of Germany or UK government, I ask, ""What is the point of blocking trade with the Chinese equipment suppliers, isn't that just shooting yourselves in the foot? The USA no longer competes in that market and there is no private industry or government plan to attempt to do so. We see no benefit from denying US/German operators from buying what they think is best so long as the Chinese suppliers comply with our security demands.""The only point in blocking Huawei and ZTE would be to protect out legitimate IPR and to develop a competitive industry. The way to protect IPR is through the ITC and US courts. If the USA had any plan to make the massive, multi-year investment to bring back and rear up infrastructure suppliers, that would add a rationale for banning competition from China. Otherwise, it is a sign of a lack of government adeptness to deal with the world we live in."
How does T-Mobile keep claiming they can’t rollout 5G Network but here they are making deal with cable companies. Come on T-Mobile stop lying to the Government Officials!!
what is happening????
$107 for non-dividend stock. are you kidding me?
Big day today for sprint
"Making 4th carrier with these guys. I guess TMUS interested in Cash deal. Dish has no cash, so that would be a give away. So bringing the cable providers to wireless. Both those companies would be all in competitor and have partial backhaul in their markets. TMUS is making a mistake being only wireless guy without a backhaul network. There are all at the tower and there they stop, buying from VZ, T, CHTR. Altice all their competitors. Looks like a cash win to cover his bonus of 130M upon the merger.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-12/dish-charter-and-altice-are-said-to-eye-t-mobile-sprint-assets"
Why is Tmus price perform way worse than Sprint?
The calls are dirt cheap buy some you won’t regret what a discount
Nobody said it would be perfect. remember Apple's first computer? Everyone laughed...lots of bugs to fix. Patience my friends.....
Warren Buffet DOUBLES his stake in TMUS! BUYYYYYYY!
this one wow
"Those who say that 'the merger will be terrible for consumers' have a prefrontal cortex dissociation with reality.The merger will be from mid-term (5-10 years) pro-consumer to long-term undetermined and dependent on how the converged industry evolves to include the 'other' competitors comprised of cable and self-managed private and alternative networks. The cries that 'this is bad for consumers' are coming from those who have a simplistic understanding of the industry. The merger will place T-Mobile+Sprint in a position in which they have the raw resources to compete but while they are not yet full equals as diversified ICT operators. They will be forced to compete aggressively against Verizon and AT&T or else face diminishing returns as the mobile consumer segment of the market becomes increasingly commoditized. In the long-term, ten to twenty years from now, the structure of the industry will either result in more competition coming from the wired services that have integrated wireless or else the mobile industry will have turned into another senile dementia vested industry. But that is what the regulators must decide - whether to require that the mobile BORG Empire provide competitive access to their networks in exchange for allowing them to have gained a state-sanctioned monopoly over the public spectra, or that Calcified America enshrines the fellow idiots based on having amassed positions of dominance.What the public interest dimtwats have long failed to fathom is how the puzzle pieces fit together to ensure the best interests of the public. They are ignoramuses IMO. Their actions have caused more hard than good because it has been grossly misdirected. Morons."
"Warren Buffet buys TMUS and VZ stock. So what does ""R"" do? He buys ATT stock...Doh!"
"Man, below $120 again...."
"What does this mean for T-Mobile’s retail stock holders? Deutsche Telekom has an option to acquire almost all of SoftBank's remaining stake in T-Mobile (about 8%), about a $12B purchase. (Some of that purchase comes at a discount, but the German company would still have to pay market rate for a little over half of SoftBank's stock.)"
Great day for TMUS! Let's keep closing that valuation gap with VZ and ATT!
AT&T bought DTV for about $49B plus debt. Selling off for about $15B. Should I ask T to manage my 401K?

"People you don't seem to understand that it's because of John Legere that we now have lower wireless prices. Merging with Sprint will only make it better. Word of Caution, merger will only be competitive with John Legere as the head, anybody else will surely screw it up."
Go TMO
So TMO will compete with ROKU and others? I like it because cable is to expensive and poor service. I hope they offer Internet Bundles too. Comcast tend to slow your speed down when they detect a streaming device. We maybe nearing that elusive $100 range after the announcement.
TMUS shall soon pass VERIZON!!! This low trend will pass as well.... Heading to $150 once this is done.
"T-Mobile's quarterly results came in better than expected, particularly in subscriber gains and the reported coverage being achieved by deployments of additional base stations that use multiple spectrum bands including the 600 MHz band.The company's report of success in rural America confirms multiple observations and past reports. My own observations have been that rural America appeared to welcome having an additional mobile service and is keen on using that as their only broadband connection or, once available, replacing their lousy DSL and satellite services and monopoly cable with wireless broadband.T-Mobile has provided enough of a breakout of the sub numbers to see what tics:Accelerated Customer Growth• 1.7 million total net additions in Q1 2019, up 15% YoY• 1.0 million branded postpaid net additions in Q1 2019, expect to be best in the industry• 656,000 branded postpaid phone net additions in Q1 2019, expect to be best in the industry• 69,000 branded prepaid net additions in Q1 2019• Record-low branded postpaid phone churn of 0.88% in Q1 2019, down 19 bps YoYT-Mobile has reached high growth and low churn while AT&T, Verizon and Sprint claim there to be a brutal competition taking place that makes gains difficult. Yes, for them."

"MoffettNathanson Research issued an analysis that lowered the firm's odds for approval of the T-Mobile+Sprint merger based on the opposition of the 'Blue State AG's, ie Democratic-controlled state Attorney Generals.I disagree with Moffett-Nathanson's opinion. The state AGs have a working relationship with the US FED regulators. The DOJ and FTC sometimes do not take up antitrust issues that pertain mostly to one or a few states or where the merger causes a particular impact on those states that are not reflected in the majority of states. This has come into play in various mergers including utilities that operate regionally and where the states in question have particular laws governing how commerce is conducted, such as how the distribution of drugs occurs. However, when the responsible FED regulators have already taken up the evaluation of the merger, the role of the individual or groups of states becomes supplementary/advisory. They get an opportunity to provide their opinions on how the merger will impact competition that adds to the consideration by the FED but they do not get a veto.At times in US history, the state AG's have taken a more active role in antitrust. This has occurred under both Republican and Democrat administrations when the political mood was that the FED was not being forceful enough. The current tide is shaped by many factors. Significantly, the Republicans clamored for deregulation and lowering of taxes on the wealthy and corporations and for allowing big companies to merge to become more dominant. One of the outcomes was supposed to be that the economic tide would raise the tax base to refund the government debt, or at least not cause it to expand further. However, what has happened thus far is that US deficits have increased while the gap between the wealthy and lower classes has widened. Nasty environment, poor analysis.MoffettNathanson Research gets this wrong. While the merger is playing out in the political environment that has grown less friendly, this is not a merger of companies that are on an equal playing field. The merger is between two underdogs who share about 1/5th of the industry profits between them. More state AG's have come out in favor of the merger than the for the states that are opposed. The DOJ and FCC will weigh the opinions of all state AGs along with all other opinions and their own internal analysis.The opposition has been expected: I have said all along that a lawsuit is a possibility but that it need not be upsetting. The reasons have not changed. While the Blue State AG's have come out against the merger, they have come out with no new data or arguments to influence the overall decision."
"Very likely, the next analyst day one month from now the updated financial projections for medium and long term outlook will be adjusted way up compared to what they projected when the merger was proposed."
There is no reason TMUS price drops. TMUS is best prepares for 5G play. VZ is just far behind and their only hope is mmWave and sub 6GHz which are way too expensive
"Verizon and Ericsson announced a cloud-native effort. What is 'cloud-native'? It is a term used for containerized capabilities of server-software. Wired-wireless networks have evolved to use 'containers'. These can be versions of Linux or windows server OS that is configured to run within the specific set of hardware-software networking environment as a plug-and-play ready install package. The replicated package contains all of the necessary drivers and basic configuration to run in the network ususally without help from the supplier. The package can include security configurations and other adaptations to suit a particular application(s). It can also contain a complete applications environment such as a media server, email, sms, ems, or content management system application stack. Is this a big deal? It is not a big deal for any single operator to announce that they are working or offering it because all major mobile operators will. It becomes a big deal when clients sign up to buy cloud services through a mobile operator. It becomes a bigger deal if the service grows to take a significant bite out of the overall cloud services revenues. 4G-5G NR networks are designed to be highly virtualized. However, like every virtualized cloud platform, this requires building out the hardware and software platform, operating it highly reliably (three+ 9s), and selling it against the field of competition. A problem is that cloud platforms have matured and become highly competitive. Amazon, Google, Rack Space, Microsoft, Alibaba, and 100s of other cloud and server hosting services compete in the market.In theory mobile operators have an advantage because they can locate compact (trailer size) server facilities at or close by towers within the targeted market. That can reduce latency and allows advancing from the typical edge-network topology to a more fully distributed topology. That sounds good and there has been some sales success, however, the Internet, media and other services are often wide-area to global in scope. Amazon and other providers have cultivated third party developers and service providers, engage in training and seminars. That has built up their cloud platform ecosystems so that the market has support and deployment options available beyond OS and apps containers. Can mobile operators compete? The way they tend to compete is through partnering with companies such as IBM and their competitors. That has inherent conflicts.5G networks will become dense and have gigabit bandwidth capabilities. They will be increasingly capable of providing cloud services. The big question is whether the pricing, scale, and performance advantages will win over a large marketshare."

"All of the US mobile infrastructure stocks are short-term buys based on technical analysis. TMUS, S, VZ and T have moved down to the low end of the current range while the accum/dist, stochastics, and MACD indicators look favorable for a move to the upside. The move higher would be towards the high-end of the range. This is not a strong buy situation for the group but adds to factors for buying each individual stock.I am bullish on buy-accumulate for T-Mobile and Sprint. I have also been bullish on the purchase of Sprint's parent company, Softbank (SFTBY) but since it has jumped up by about 45% over the past two months, that has changed to hold and accumulate if it either drops to a better price point or breaks through the current resistance level.TMUS is the strongest growth play in the group."
I won't buy any stock that pays no dividend.
just move big either direction :)
"The NewTM merger has always been a struggle because the US wireless industry has been determined by the DOJ and FCC to have reached the borderline of being highly concentrated, a yardstick measurement over which merger of companies in the same market is normally turned down. For antitrust regulators, the HHI is sometime atune to the Holy Grail: it can't be violated or all hell breaks loose. The 'all hell' is that markets that become highly concentrated no longer are pressured by competition to play by the rules of the free enterprise system.However, the situation here is far more complex than the simple use of the HHI formula can address: Wired and wireless broadband have converged to a degree that people care less about what pipe their connection runs over so long as it works well and delivers a fair value. Consumer trends and surveys show that they think of fiber, cable, DSL and wireless broadband as being one and the same. The differences have become contractual in the eyes of the consumer. ""Shuck me, I want to watch a video, check messages and emails, use GPS, just give me a fair deal.""It has become a false pretense for the laggards within DOJ to consider the 'wireless market' as completely separate.However, the regulators are not supposed to play Nostradamus: they need real-world statistics and real-world commitments that combine to leave no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that there will be sufficient competition in the converged ICT field.The merger of T-Mobile and Sprint will be the last chance short of breaking up AT&T and Verizon for the DOJ to assure a competitive structure for the BORG Empire industry. Wireless has become the nanobots coursing through societies veins... DOJ has to get this right."
"All the issues I have brought are coming to light.1. TMUS afraid DISH is going to resell the asset to everyone and not really develop their own network.2. TMUS afraid DISH is going to overwhelm the Tmobile network in the asset sharing agreement. Dish must be trying to resell backhaul for MVNO rights. That means Dish is planning some type of backhaul for MVNO rights and they are afraid, they are going to make sub agreements to other carriers and take market share. So much market share that the asset agreement would be upside down.DISH is going to do all the things they are afraid of and more. DISH is eating TMUS's lunch and they are liking it.https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/11/t-mobile-sprint-merger-reportedly-hinges-on-dish-assets/"

This is the last time you will be able to buy TMO under or near $80. Cannot believe the stock did not move big on those blowout earnings beat.
"T-Mobile continues to ride the wave of higher efficiency in their network. The basic challenge for mobile operators is to become more an efficient user of the three basic ingredients that fuel profitability: Capital, people/brainpower, and technology. To do that, the operator must a) acquire spectrum at a competitive cost. b) Deploy technology as is best suited and in a timely fashion to that very close behind revenues are spun up, c) And be tuned in to the matrix of technology and business so that you do not make as many costly blunders as competitors. I could have put that as putting tha+b together with a series of good decisions but it is easier to understand what T-Mobile is doing right by understanding how their competitors often 'screw the pooch' or 'shoot themselves in the foot' or other vernacular expressions.So long as T-Mobile does not make wild choices, such as acquiring Sprint for a stupid price, the company can move ahead and have lots of fun."
I like this from $9.40 to $6 that was a Beautiful Opportunity with Sprint and if this Merger goes through you will have another Beautiful Opportunity $65 to $16 that s sweet. Shorties want this Merger to go through.
I don't think it worth the price increases on the family plan with 2 year contract. Consider we can get Netflix for family at cheaper.
"If TMUS is bringing in big Cable to entertain offers for spectrum, that means a divesture of spectrum is likely. Big Cable doesn't just show for a maybe. They must have to divest to get the merger to go through. Giving up spectrum devalues the merger and now Sprint huge debt makes this stock less attractive as a wireless only player. The other big 3 will have a network and T mobile has to buy FTTT. Tmobile will be in same boat as now with Less Cap Ex money than the others. Cap Ex money is key to this industry as the footprint coverage needs to deploy quickly. S/ TMUS with now be 4 in Cap Ex and will eventually lose customers to the other 3 with bigger budgets."
TMUSR is the right to buy .05 of a share for each share if TMUS you currently own. The price you'll have to pay to receive these shares is $103 each. Have until July 27th to exercise the right.
"Thats right Started at 80,000 employees. Ended at 30,000. a lot of those were outsourced to contractors when Son did not get Tmobile and at that time Son used Sprint as a tax deduction. He also started dumped people 7yrs ago to put the company up for sale while telling everyone he was going to make Sprint No2. It is well know this merger is not needed and just a scam to make the CEOs richer. Sprint is doing Great and does not need this Nasty Job Killing Merger.

"""Justice Department may sue to block T-Mobile Sprint merger"".. Big news right? Wrong.The DoJ has and will always hold out the possibility that it will sue to block mergers that it does not approve of. Why? Because companies know that the DoJ ATR is not the final authority/judge in the case - the courts are always the final recourse for settling whether mergers comply with the antitrust and other laws. It has been a possibility from day 1 that if the DoJ does not agree with the structure of the merger that they could disapprove it. Subsequently, the companies involved have had the option to continue to move forward with the merger with the expectation that DoJ would sue to block. This is just how the system works.The merger has proceeded to where the FCC has approved based on an agreement with the parties that included price, coverage, and service commitments that are backed up by a regimen of field tests and reports. NewTM would deposit funds into a performance account, (my description). The FCC would check, using third-party field surveys whether coverage and other commitments were met and check that the low pricing commitment was met. If they found NewTM to do not comply, the pre-paid fund could then be tapped to fine NewTM without facing stalling or a legal challenge. That process does remove a large degree of the enforcement problem the FCC is often faced with but does require FCC staff to micro-manage the merger to some extent. The DoJ ATR wants to use the market structure to enforce prices through competitive pressures, leaving the FCC and DoJ (the FED) out of the equation except for the usual regulatory supervision.What would happen if Deutsche Telekom, the ~60% owner of T-Mobile, were to refuse to budge and the DoJ filed to block? The defendants, NewTM et al, would be able to move ahead without the DISH side agreement based on the pending approval that has been worked out with the FCC. That could involve the unusual circumstance in which the DoJ sues to block while NewTM has the FCC as an effective ally in the case. NewTM's stance would be to challenge DoJ because the merger meets antitrust requirements as being for pro-competitive while pointing to the agreement with the FCC as the most expert government authority on the industry. The case would be battled on the grounds that the merger as agreed with the FCC does meet the structural requirements for free enterprise markets that DoJ has sought... but they went too far.Or NewTM could go ahead with a deal with DISH but with the limitations that Deutsche Telekom has baulked on, and make the case that they have come far enough and that the remaining demands by DoJ are onerous and capricious. NewTM would take the stance that not putting limits on what DISH can do with the spectrum or sale of all or part of the company would open the deal up to being a pawn in Charlie Ergen’s wheeling and dealing profiteering. If they pursued that course, the grounds for DoJ’s objections to the merger would have been narrowed to the few remaining details. However, that would continue to have the penalty of sustained risk and loss of time-to-market advantages compared to agreeing to DoJ ATR’s demands and getting the show on the road. The parties will move past the current stalemate because the merger, despite being singled out by the feeble, late game DoJ ATR for industry restructuring delivers much better long-term potential to the involved companies. Good agreements are designed so that ‘all parties feel the same level of pain’ as well as the benefits. The sorry state of affairs of the US wireless industry is that not all parties have been treated equally: AT&T and Verizon are the structural atomic bombs in the diversified wireless and emerging 5G opportunity space (except for Home broadband where NewTM will have the advantage). The DoJ and FCC have been feckless in taking on the BORG Empire... appeasing the structural imbalance by taking it all out of the hides of the smaller, less diversified and less well positioned market participants. That is the way things work in our politically and biggest money and labor union corrupted system, however, it would occasionally be nice if the DoJ ATR could grow a pair. DoJ is doing what they must by the lousy situation they helped to create. The HHI pencil pushers should be ashamed."

"T-Mobile has figured it out. $45 billion can buy a lot of things, but 5G leadership ain’t one. T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) invested just over $9.3 billion in the FCC’s C-Band auction, selectively acquiring additional mid-band spectrum it will use to take America’s largest and fastest 5G network to the next level and continue delivering massive customer benefits unlocked by the merger with Sprint. Even as its competitors spent record-breaking amounts in the auction, T-Mobile maintains its leadership on mid-band spectrum."

"DISH turned in results that were roughly in-line, in other words, the plodding steps of a dinosaur:""DISH ended the quarter with 12.1M total Pay-TV subscribers, including 9.6M DISH TV subscribers, and 2.4M Sling TV subscribers. Net pay-TV subscribers dropped 259,000 subscribers, compared to a 94,000 decline in last year's quarter."", source, Seeking Alpha.I think that the mainstream wireless networks had reached a tipping point at which mobile service could be substituted for satellite service depending on the availability of 4G-Advanced. 5G is not yet a big factor in the rural markets where satellite service has the most traction. In fact, 5G is hardly a factor in any market, even in the limited markets now served by Verizon and AT&Ts mmWave 5G networks. It is only by sleight of hand re-naming of 4G-Advanced by AT&T which are now joined by Verizon, that the claims for 5G look at all substantial. But that is 80% marketing hype, 20% preparation for broad availability of 5G. Two secnrios for DISH (and why they funded the opposition to the merger:1) The merger is turned down. DISH will see increased competition in suburban areas over the next year or two but the rate of decline in subscribers will remain on the gradual downward slope.2) The merger is approved: DiSH will see increased competition starting in 2020 as T-Mobile rolls out 5G Home BB service with one or more OTT media services rolled in. Even though it will take 2-3 years for networks to re-farm Sprint's spectrum, the benefit of larger market scale on top of the rollout of 4G-Advanced/5G already underway by T-Mo will have an accelerated impact on DISHy wishy."

"Insiders are not 'selling off their shares' as other posts say. Insiders have taken options on shares at 0.0 recently. Several sales were recorded on the same day. All of the sales were for less than the shares received. In several cases, the sales were half or less than the shares received. What does this tell investors? It tells them that the BODs of T-Mobile and parent company Deutsche Telekom released the hold on executive compensation that had been placed in order they not be influenced to make the deal out of personal benefit (see the public statement at the period ahead of the merger_.What this probably signals is that the BODs of these companies are confident that the merger will be approved. It at least means that they are confident that management won't execute the merger out of self-interest. That almost certainly means they think the deal is assured to the point that there is not much left to be done before the DOJ and FCC come to a decision."

"Happy new year!2019 is a pivotal year for the USA ICT industry because the DOJ and FCC will decide on how the industry is going to be structured. The decision whether to allow New T-Mobile to form, how the deal is structured and how other players are handled, including what happens to DISH, cablecos and MVNOs will determine the rate of innovation and benefits the country redeems from the 'wireless broadband revolution' for decades to come. 2019 will be the foundation-building year for 5G and among the most important years in the history of the US wireless and converged ICT industry."
And through all this ordeal John Legere continued Tweeting as usual.
"BTIG's analyst, Walter P. issued a revised price target of $91 for stand-alone TMUS and rehashed what is known about T-Mobile's advantage to rolling out 5G Mobile version.T-Mo's advantage stems from having assembled a long and wide-enough spectra runway to get the mobile market up to speed for takeoff. Meanwhile, stand-alone Sprint lacks both the low-band and lower portion of mid-band and also the capital to even attempt a nationwide mobile 5G rollout. Verizon and AT&T have more capital but the analysis on that, going back literally decades, is that they would need a more low-mid band to exploit the mobile version of 4G-Advanced-to-5G as has always been the proven case for mobile networks. This hardly means that T-Mobile can grab marketshare super easy or that they can pick and choose share in every segment of the business. However, when you look at the mainstream mobile, IoT, enterprise, medical, OTT media, government markets, what you see is that the price, reach, in-building penetration and other instrumental factors look highly competitive. The approach of building 5G in the low-band and then layering mid-to-high band is far better suited to 'organic growth'. If, for example, a contract were to open up in the automotive market: T-Mobile might want to compete on price in order to take share because they have built the coverage and capacity to serve the mainstream mobile market. That might take beefing up transportation corridors rather than a 'new network' using costly to deploy high band in order to deliver HD TV to mobile entertainment systems. This is just an example. Of course, T-Mo can go after all mobile BB applications via the mainstream retail and MVNO channels."
"not very, take a look now. this was a Golden entry opportunity"
"Just started my Boost Mobile service to find that my house and the house on each side of me don't get phone or data inside the houses. Seriously. The ""expanded"" Sprint/T-Mobile network is available ""in-store only."" What the HELL does that mean? If I need to make a call, do I need to go to a Boost Mobile store to make it?"
"T-Mobile (TMUS) has shed much of its speculative merger premium and now is looking more like a mid-long term buy again after several months of being either speculatively priced or locked in a range due to the merger. TMUS may head lower. This is not a comment that the it is a short-term trading buy. However, it is probably a safe entry point for long-term infestors to average in or to wait for the volatility to work itself out."
The buying has not begun by most hedge fund that buy S&P 500 companies.
"Despite increased odds that the merger will gain approvals, Sprint (S) is trading at a discount to the agreed exchange ratio. S would need to move up to 6.85 an 11.56% increase. Since the merger was announced Sprint has traded at between a 9% and 13% discount. A portfolio of the most impacted stocks of the merger might be balanced more in favor of S at this point. A holding of 40 to 50% S, 20-40% TMUS and the rest in S's parent company SFTBY IMO. Shares of Deutsche Telekom might also be considered."
"T-Mobile and Sprint merger would created more competition between 3 Carriers and Rate plans would drop and On top of that people going benefit from this, even shareholders for instance ""Netflix On Us"" for Free. People should started investing on TMUS. because the last time company merger there profit went up the roof. People going to regret if they don't invested in TMUS down road."

"T-Mobile had been driven down as the market melted a few weeks back. I had said that TMUS was oversold, making the stock a short-term buy and reiterated a long-term buy/accumulate. Some had become fearful. Even while the prospect for inflation has increased, the business model no longer depends on a runup in capital spending on a scale similar to past decades. And so long as the individual companies maintain their sales and profitability, the 'trend is your friend'. That goes for AT&T and Verizon as well as T-Mobile... except that T-Mobile is the only major US operator that is growing appreciably. The industry is highly profitable and is valued lower than many stock sectors. The mobile sector probably won't fetch high multiples, but some expansion is likely to occur as fear that price competition will rule the business climate abate. While TMUS has recouped a significant portion of its drop from peak levels, it remains on trend for long-term accumulation IMO. The easy profits are probably already baked in the cake ... 66-67ish looking like the top of the near-term range."
T-Mobile will spend a ton on their merger effort which will affect their bottom line and CAPEX for years just as at&t was financially challenged with it's 2 year effort to merge with Warner and it's stock has languished the entire time because of that even though it's now starting to recover...Point is that T-Mobile will languish for at least the next 18 months and will probably have to give up further concessions to have the merger approved...both foreign competitors aren't going to get preferential treatment from the Democrats.
SB's Masa Son and DT's Tim Hottges probably already know what it's going to take to get a deal done. Now it just needs to be made public.
Don't worry Warren is to smart to hold a Foreign company that is collecting data on the USA to use against the USA to farther the EU one world order. More than likely Warren has already sold and if not he will be out before the Government has to stop TMUS from collecting data on Americans
"The biggest advantage for TMUS is their 30 MHz of 600 MHz spectrum. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's the ice cream that doesn't make you fat. It's the highest quality air wave. Another great advantage they have is, arguably, the millennials like them. Their ads are hip, their main guys dress hip, and they give out free stuff."

"TMUS needs a 4th carrier to complete the deal There is little options to save the deal. The S merger has the poison pill backout which allows S to use it is network regardless of the merger. So S got a free network the day they signed the merger agreement. Who can they make the 4th carrier that would be beneficial? There are very few options CTL CHTR and CMCSA, AMZN. CTL they could get nationwide Backhaul, CHTR and CMCSA would both be still competition and no reciprocal benefit. AMZN you could get content or really good money, but you would release the best of wireless, with endless money to drive consumer everything through the phone. That is how CTL is the best 4th carrier. Who else?"

"Does T-Mobile need to merge with Sprint or a cable company?The conventional wisdom has been that the convergence between mobile voice+text and broadband data network capabilities would force a consolidation between the broadband pipes and content suppliers. Consolidation of mobile operators has occurred in most parts of the world. The degree depends on factors such as demographics, geography, market maturity, and government regulations. However, given T-Mobile's demonstrated ability to buck the US industry trend toward a mature/calcified market environment that results in slow growth, or in the worst case, compacting margins and negative sales growth, makes it reasonable to speculate that T-Mobile may also buck the trend of large-scale mergers.It is important to consider the history of M&A in general and for the mobile industry. While large mergers allow companies to up their scale, the benefit/cost often proves to have been blown far out of proportion. The average M&A fails to deliver the desired results according to multiple studies. Only about 1/4 turn out to be as good as promised and about half result in a lower stock price for years following the consolidation of the businesses. Large scale mergers in the US mobile field have done no better than the averages: AT&T nearly went under several years ago following a series of consolidations and divestitures. Sprint famously screwed up their business prospects by acquiring Next Networks at the height of its glory as the champion of among the world's first, non-standard digital network, Motorola iDen. Sprint total cost may be figured to have been as high as $70 billion - the initial cost was around $35 billion but that put a dead albatross around Sprint's neck that took several years and about a 17 million loss in subscribers due to disruptive 'rip and replace' of the obsoleted network before reaching stability around 2015. It would be hard to come up with a movie script as weird as that.. novices to the business world might find it difficult to believe. AT&T's more recent acquisition of DTV looks to work out but has not proven to be a boon to their mobile business. T-Mobile has managed to take a bite out of T's mobile subscriber base despite the tie-in of the content pipe. The alternative to merging with Sprint is to continue to grow past that need. A merger of partnership with a cable company might fulfill some of the benefits expected of a merger while having lower risk. The main argument against doing a merger is that time appears to be on TM/BT's side: prospects for merging may look even better down the road. If T-Mobile were to grow as forecast and not go wild on spending and other acquisitions, Sprint may be more willing to sell or may be broken up between its mobile service and its network and spectrum such that acquisition of the customer base may be had at a less painful cost.Other opportunities can be thought of: 4G-5G networks are delivering more bandwidth and other services at a lower unit cost. Continuing to hone in on network efficiency and leveraging of services, TM may continue to find ways to offset the disadvantage of being half the size of Verizon and AT&T. In other words, ""Let the BORG-like carriers try to merge their way forward. They will act like clumsy dinosaurs. Meanwhile, we will seek to take advantage of the forced approach to service consolidation by delivering more of what customers want (as opposed to what is in the mega-carriers best interests)."
"Why IMO today was a excellent opportunity to add shares of TMUS This T-Mobile Stock: Upcoming Analyst Day KeyAn upcoming investor day in March could be a catalyst for T-Mobile stock, analysts say.""We expect the company to update investors on its synergy targets, longer term subscriber and financial expectations, and its 5G strategy which should lead to rising estimates and prove catalytic for the stock,"" Bank of America analyst David Barden said in a recent note to clients.T-Mobile's operating margins lag Verizon and AT&T. At the analyst day, T-Mobile may lay out plans on improving operating margins, analysts say."

"==HOT, heading quickly to be #1 Wireless Provider in US => T-Mobile announced it is extending its ""Test Drive"" consumer program to businesses. The new program ""lets businesses try T-Mobile's bigger, better network for free before they switch,"" said T-Mobile, which added that it will offer a free phone, free service and a switch incentive as part of the program."
"Wireless customers should expect ""More for Less"" because that is what should ""drop out of the sky"", so to speak, from the evolution of wireless technology and convergence of wired-fiber-cable-wireless and IT/Internet markets.The idea that giving consumers more is an extraordinary sacrifice needs to be discredited as utter nonsense. This is the way of the world of all electronics-driven fields. And it is amplified by the ""Moore-Cooper-Alamouti (et al) Law of Wireless"": that capacity will double every 12-18 months due to basic laws of physics and economics.T-Mobile gets that. However, they are not creating miracles.. just 'doing what comes naturally'. That does take the awareness and willingness to fulfill the promise of what the physics Ph.D.'s, engineers, engineering managers, technicians, equipment experts, software gurus, as well as the middle management and higher tiers that sit on their shoulders to follow through to deliver that up to consumers instead if sending it to some fat #$%$ sitting back on their lounge chairs in the form of dividends or spending it on acquisitions that try to put stakes in the ground in order to hold back the never-ending tide of destructive creation.Consumers should demand more, more, more over the next 20 years until we are either cyborgs or wireless has become overtaken by technologies and social constructs that we have yet to imagine. New T-Mobile should be approved and then their feet should be held to the fire each and every day... if they are what they claim, that is what they themselves will want... a revolution of their making/participation."

"In case anyone's interested...For the last two days, T-Mobile's customer service, the several times I've called them, have said their systems are down and they're unable to look up any customer account info. And, on their website, when I've tried to access this same info, I'm getting a message saying to the effect that their systems are busy and to try again later. It seems more like their customer account/service systems have completely crashed. And, it's not clear when they're going to be up again. Very troubling."
"Bernstein (Supino) initiates coverage on TMUS with an ""outperform"" price target of $103, and this while reports of TMUS being in the top 25 picks for hedge funds, which have been recently shown by some to still be acquiring lots more TMUS. TMUS trading under $80 right now seems like a long's gift, doesn't it? Solid company, solid future, in a solid industry where products/services can be needed/used by virtually anyone from like 10 years old to 100+, with solid growth prospects on the future of everything from automation, gaming, personal health, etc. and all that we don't even know yet. And, they say all that even without the merger and staying as the #3. With the merger, sky's the limit, and who knows ... could pop to $100 once the Court rules in favor of the defense and their pro consumer/pro country Fed approved deal over the AGs pro NOTHING but wicked witch hunting partisan politics."

"The latest announcement from Verizon Communications shows how the duopolists are branching out into the computer services realm in a big way: ""...VZ recently announced that it has been selected by SAP SE SAP to build the latter’s next-generation global network infrastructure. SAP is a Germany-based multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations.""The infrastructure-based mobile operators are in a position to become perhaps the largest players in the virtualized computer services space. This is a huge business opportunity that is dominated in the USA by Verizon and AT&T. The merger will create a 3rd competitor for wireless cloud (cloud4g/cloud5G) services.""What has changed since the last time the T-Mobile+Sprint merger was pursued"" The BORG Empire has engulfed the world of media, computing, IoT, etc. The basic question is 'What market?' is being considered as being impacted. The answer is ""all of the current market segments plus ones that will become monopolized as the 5G BORG ship enters the space.""If the merger is not approved there will be two companies who will control 85%-95% of the 5G galaxy."
"""Guggenheim: T-Mobile Home Broadband Aimed At Boosting Sprint Merger, Not A Threat To Cable""T-Mobile needs to do test cases for the 4G-Advanced-5G home eNB broadband. Guggenheim analyst merely states the obvious, that the test of 50,000 homes does not directly threaten the cable companies and that it, partly or as a side effect, shows the regulators a real-world test of what has been described in New T-Mobile's plans for a nationwide rollout of mobile and fixed 5G. However, until the merger is completed the use of both low and mid-band spectra won't be put together. Furthermore, 5G is still at the crawling out of the crib stage: there are practically no devices in the market outside of the fixed eNB network nodes. Many have called 2019 the year of 5G. It hardly is that. It is much more a test year for 5G. No operator in the world will deliver significant 5G revenues, period. It is not all hot air because the nature of 5G is as an evolution on the same theme as 4G/4G-Advanced. 5G is LTE, long term evolution. Calling it a new G or New Radio is much more a marketing and political ploy than a real thing. 5G will just start to gain momentum at the end of 2019. 2020 will be the first year that it starts catching fire. The war for 5G with China can't start until either country has enough 5G deployed that service providers can distinguish it from 4G and applications developers have a market to sell into. The USA does not compete against Huawei except in the 5G chips. There are no US handset or equipment suppliers left. They vacated the country years ago because the cost of doing business in financial fantasy land America was too high."

Best performing company in the industry while the value is half the competition. I am buying for sure
"Wireless operators are pursuing alternative strategies to increase bandwidth in mobile and home network node router devices. Conversations about 5G are muddied by the wide breath of applications covered - from low cost/low bandwidth IoT, to the high bandwidth needed to support 4K video, virtual reality, video conferencing, etc. What has limited use of higher frequencies in mobile devices is that the signals do not travel as far or into buildings well, requiring the power to be increased. Wider bandwidth signal processing also consumes more power. Over the years the upward limit feasibly used by battery operated devices has expanded to include the 2.3-2.7 GHz range. The 5G chip-enabled devices will increase the frequency range to include the 3.5-3.6 GHz range. That will open up 150-400 MHz of additional spectrum, which is more than the total aggregate amount mobile operators have available. Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile have engaged in trials of the 3.5 GHz band in anticipation of major deployments in the 2019-2020 time frame. Verizon is pursuing a fixed-to-mobile strategy while T-Mobile is focused more immediately on exploiting recently available 600 MHz combined with mid-band while preparing for a push into 3.5 GHz as that becomes ready for prime time exploitation. There is not as much difference in these strategies as the corporate messaging indicates - they both are gated on availability of mobile devices for widespread adoption to take place and on the need of creating market momentum once that occurs. 3.5 GHz combined with US operators current spectrum bands should enable more direct competition for home broadband, the largest opportunity for market expansion over the next 2-5 years+. Besides the opportunity to take share away from cable and satellite operators, upward expansion of capacity combined with lower latency and higher reliability should open up additional market opportunities tied to value creation"
Which stockIs better to buy if merge happen ? T-Mobile or sprint . Need feed back thanks 
Who is looking at TMUS. and. S. for an M. or. A?????
News Story on CNBC now. I'm guessing the merger has constraints he can't overcome.
TMUS was worth more before the merger...!!!
"Moody's issued an update on DISH following the recent win of $6.2 billion of the spectrum: DISH is said to be at the limit of its non-secured borrowing capacity. That indicates that DISH is unlikely to be able to swing a big acquisition such as of Sprint or T-Mobile. That is only a modest change from DISH's previous position - it could not afford to compete with Softbank for Sprint even before going further out on the limb in the AWS and 600 MHz auctions. Although it had to relinquish its bids for AWS spectrum, it is liable to make up the difference if the FCC is unable to auction the spectrum for the over $3B bid. That was one time Ergen's taking the rules to the edge and beyond did not pay off. T-Mobile and, worse, Sprint are also near the end of their credit. T-Mobile could probably swing another round of loans. However, that would more likely be spent on building out of low and mid-band spectrum acquired over the past three years. Sprint has no borrowing capacity left to speak of.They may tidy up past loans or take care of housekeeping cash-flow requirements, but will not be going on a buying spree of even companies in the hundreds of millions let alone tens of billions of dollars. Softbank has expressed no desire to acquire T-Mobile. Instead, S/SB want to sell S to anyone with a warm pulse."

"If you look at the 5 year chart it is seen that despite the short-term moves up and down that were outside of the trendline, T-Mobile (TMUS) has moved steadily higher. The basic reason for that is that stocks follow their company's results: higher sales and profits while balanced against liabilities. That looking back at the past (the long term chart) is great but ""hindsight is 20/20"" - how do investors use that information now? The 'trend is your friend' as Peter Lynch used to say - investors should expect the trend to continue so ong as company performance shows improvement in sales and profits while debt looks manageable, ie. does not look to be growing faster than the ability to pay it back through expected future ROI. If results continue to come in at or better than expectations, then buying the stock looks generally favorable. How an investor times trades takes more skill than picking a long-term trend. Thge chart shows a trend over the past five years in which the stock has about tripled (3X) in price. Within that are points where the stock shot up beyond the average range only to pull back. It sometimes took several months before those short-term highs were pushed through. TMUS shot up to a new high on high volume and recently pulled back to nearly 'fill the gap'. The stock probably will trend sideways for a while. The current price is about in the middle of the long-term trend channel which is formed by drawing lines through the peaks (upper end of the range) and lows (lower end of the channel range). Since the trendline is moving up, if the stock moves sideways it will in about three months be at the low trendline of the channel and technically a buy (so long as performance continues or is improved upon)."
"T-Mobile has pre-announced the One+ McClaren mobile phones. They are taking pre-release orders now. The phones include premium features including rapid charging and three cameras. Pricing was not announced but should be competitive with 5G phones now on the market. T-Mobile also announced the early availability of the 5G network and more rapid than expected coverage: ""Today T-Mobile announced that the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren is coming EXCLUSIVELY to the Un-carrier AND that it plans to cover 200 million people with 5G on 600 MHz before the end of this year"". The plan to have 200 million people covered by the end of the year comes about 2-3 months earlier than expected.Why this is important: AT&T and Verizon are deploying 5G using mmWave spectrum. Compared to mmWave, T-Mobile's 600 MHz has 6x to 10x as wide of coverage and better building penetration. That makes T-Mobile's marketing position unique among US network operators. Why pre-announce: this comes as Mobile World Congress is meeting in LA, an event that sees many new product and deployment plan announcements. T-Mobile was set to roll out the 5G network in the 1st quarter of 2020. The jump may be intended to kick off public awareness ahead of the x-Mas buying season and to put some credibility behind the merger plan to roll out nationwide using the combined T-Mobile Sprint spectra. T-Mobile has said that it would not charge extra for 5G service. However, the early 5G devices are expected, as with each generation, to be pricey. T-Mo says in the PR that the One+ is intended for early adopters."

What's keeping this thing from taking off? Earnings report was solid
"T-Mobile issued early quarterly results last week that confirms the suspicion that the company has take subscribers away from Sprint following the collapse of merger talks. I had suspected this would be the case because the publicity surrounding the merger has drawn more attention to T-Mobile. Sprnt customers were made aware that TMo has overtaken Sprint as the number 3 mobile operator. The unsaid factor is that the merger talks got Sprint customers to think that they might become T-Mobile customers if the deal went through. T-Mobile reported a port ratio of 1.5:1 which means that for every customer leaving TMo for Sprint, 1.5 left Sprint for T-Mobile. That tends to confirm the projection of a loss of 200,000-500,000 post-paid subscribers. If so, Sprint stock is likely to move lower once results are reported IMO."
"My broker at Raymond James just sent me a report indicating TMUS will have the FCF to support $60B in stock buybacks between 2023-25. Not bad for a stock with a $160B market cap.TMUS is going (a lot) higher, folks."
100 Million Customers!Incredible!!
"T-Mobile has pulled further ahead of Sprint with the quarterly results: T-Mobile reported 1.3 million net new customers, 595k postpaid. An interesting point was that TM reported higher subscriber port ratio for VZ and T than for Sprint. That is positive in the port ratio for TMUS:S last quarter was higher. Perhaps S's results will look OK and the total of the two companies will provide a favorable signal for the merger prospects."
NO ONE in America should be doing any business with a Foreign company like T mobile with a EU one world order Foreign agenda. NO Foreign Company should have that much access to American's people data

T-Mobile ready for a REVERSAL - SUCKERS BUYING INTO TAKE-OVER RUMORS...MORE PUMP AND DUMP
"TMUS is avoiding this and the FCC and DOJ know this will get their 4th carrier. TMUS poison pill.There is no breakup fee associated with the deal, they said. However, there is a roaming agreement that will kick into effect between the companies if a deal is rejected. Sprint customers would be allowed to use T-Mobile’s network if they’re out of range, two of the people said."
"The TMo_Sprint merger fell for the reasons Softbank, Sprint and T-Mobile stated: They could not agree on the degree of involvement Sprint would retain in the merged company. This is not difficult to understand: a look at Softbank's recent quarterly report shows the parent company is dependent on the huge cash flows generated by their mobile business segments. Softbank is made up of several companies in the mobile device and network services sector. That revenue is needed to support the debt the company has accumulated. In effect, Softbank is captive of mobile industry sector cash flows. Softbank had acquired Brightstar and has set up network-spectrum LeaseCo and other units that finance the large cash flows from the Japan and US mobile operations. Brightstar does business with a large number of other operators but Sprint is the largest. Softbank/Son says that the supporting operating units have been profitable. The deal fell apart because SB's BOD wanted more 'governance' of the new company. Although that was not spelled out in explicit terms, it was communicated in discussions about the various units and overall situation."
Looks like this MegaMerger will not be Approved so the MEGA-BORG EMPIRE will not turn into reality draining everyone's Bank Account.
"Short,Short,Short all the way to $42.50!"
"T-Mobile can benefit from merging with Sprint because of two major things: 1) The scale of subscribers would reach the same density as Verizon and AT&T. The building of 5G (any new network) has a simple formula for success Income/expense. Since T-Mobile and Sprint have 17% and 14% marketshare the income from the building the 5G network would be cut by twice the expense since they would each need their own network. AT&T and Verizon would have about twice the revenue per cost. That is such a huge difference that it much less matters how the network is built or how wonderful management goes about their business. The fundamental reason why T-Mobile has achieved such success is that management made decisions to acquire the 'right mix' of spectrum bands and did not waste money in foolish acquisitions or building of networks that latter would become obsoleted by new generations. 2) The use of combined networks and spectrum bands to leap-frog Verizon and AT&T's ability to build high-bandwidth 5G. While Verizon and AT&T are faced with using high-frequency spectra that is costly, takes more base stations and time, and needs access to some more spectra that the FCC has yet to make available, New T-Mobile could start rolling out 5G into the new and repurposed combined bands quickly after the deal was approved.There are multiple strategies/ways to achieve success: 1) Be more cost-efficient. 2) Market more effectively, 3) Have a time-to-market advantage for new classes of service that drive more income. 4) Have a larger scale than competitors. T-Mobile now has the advantages of being more cost efficient due to past decisions to buy the right spectrum and build the right networks. And they have a marketing advantage because they have parlayed that into delivering a good value proposition and presenting it in a way that is receptive to a maturing market in which targeting the larger competitors as fat pigs, ie. Dumb and Dumber strikes a favorable chord with a large portion of the market. The company can continue to ride on the momentum these have created but at some point, the logic of business economics tell us that 'scale matters', giving fric and frac (VZ and T) the overall competitive advantage.Therefore, T-Mobile is in a position that they are likely to have success with or without the merger with Sprint. The long-term prospects will likely be better with the merger so long as it is not castrated by concessions required by the regulatory agencies."
My post merger price target for TMUS (assuming half of Sprint's Service Revenues transfers directly to operating profit for TMUS and no repricing AND PE of 15) is $115.
"Remember to only sell any moves higher in T Mobile and to Buy the dips in T LOL,LOL,LOL"

"A factor that is difficult to quantify because of the complexity and dynamic nature of wireless and converging markets is the influence that private and co-use of networks may have to add to the competition. Over the past several years wireless broadband has replaced much of the use of cable within homes and commercial buildings. The combination of mostly locally owned and deployed WiFi and the centrally deployed and managed mobile WRAN, Wide-area Radio Access Network, wireless has taken over 90% of the end user device, including PCs broadband connections to the wide-area/Internet network. About 95% of cable and fiber-optic is connected to users through WiFi, making cable and fiber a vulnerable target for replacement. A factor that is unknown is how much the market will take advantage of the new 5G/5G-NR, 5G-New Radio, standard to build stand-alone 5G, device-to-device, and user-to-user-to-network device capabilities. Almost all useful spectrum has been pimped out, er licensed, by the US FCC to mobile operators and speculators, leaving almost nothing for corporations and end users to made use of with 5G which technically could expand the use cases (several have been defined by the 3GPP/5GPP, ITU, and others. What could develop, despite some brain-deadness at the FCC, is that building owners, school and business campuses, municipalities and other jurisdictions, multi-family units, hotels, convention centers, airports, utility companies, factories, etc. can build local area 5G networks that are used to serve as their local area broadband network and also as the building to metro-area footprint mobile services network. That would compete for a share of the overall RAN use. It would probably be used similarly to WiFi in that the user-owners of the local 5G network would not have the market power to seek a return for the use of their local network outside of the performance advantage and control that they achieve out of it.However, local, stand-alone 5G can develop additional use cases including p-p and d-d subnets, Gigabit low-latency computer networks, and AI (artificial intelligence) applications. These use cases/applications are part of what is envisioned as the most promising for 5G. What is unknown is how much will users and businesses participate, how much mobile operators will own, particularly of the fast-paced innovations and new businesses likely to spring up?On the one hand, mobile providers are the ""Great enablers"" of all the applications and ways people use wireless. On the other hand, far more bandwidth connects to users mobile and other devices through their own WiFi than the fantastic mobile services. How big a role those outside of the mobile operators will take, and how much pressure that can place on them to improve their networks and services and more efficient and lower price, ie. serve as the 4th competitor, is unknown at this point."

"The insider/parent company, short interest, and hedge fund buying trends are bullish for both T-Mobile and Sprint. Deutsche is buying more shares. That stands out in contrast to DT's stated goals a few years ago when the parent company was actively trying to sell off their majority-owned US subsidiary. Deutsche continued to try to sell T-Mobile up until 2-3 years ago. Even after T-Mobile had become perhaps the most successful turn around story in the world, Deutsche merely shifted their stance from wanting to dump TMUS to wanting to dump their position at a good price. Over the past 2 years DT has changed to wanting to keep TMUS and extend the juggernaut through the acquisition of Sprint. T-Mobile has become the strongest contributor to DT's growth and is helping the parent company's stock price and image.The insiders and professional investment community is lopsidedly bullish on TMUS and S. Some of that can be excused because executive compensation at T-Mo was adjusted so that they are rewarded by results and not for pushing through the merger for a short-term payday. So, maybe there would be more insider selling if the goals had been properly orchestrated. Even though that tends to slant the insider picture more bullish, which could be questioned as making it less relevant as an indicator, that also shows greater confidence in the prospects for T-Mobile and New T-Mobile."
"Hmm, some old timers still left here. Where is the Greek?"
VZ and T use there cable line business as profit and operate their wireless with low margins. They are ILEC on their home turf so there is not a lot of competition and churn of IP subscribers. Wireless is a much more churn rated business as it is easier to switch. So VZ / T know it is about pricing and buy points in wireless offsetting it in fiberline rates. TMUS cant do this and has had a large disadvantage in controlling their fiber line access and shifting profits in according to market needs. That is why T is spending $26B on capex for fiber. Fiber gets the IP to the tower and TMUS needs to buy it.
Can we say good company but broken stock?
"The FCC issued rules governing the 3.5-3.6 GHz spectrum band. That is favorable to T-Mobile as a stand-alone company because it will offer an expanse of spectrum they can shift into to provide high capacity to users that compliments the easy and less expensive deployments in the lower bands. However, since it will be available to all operators and as unlicensed, it does not provide an exclusive advantage outside of providing more runway to continue the momentum created in the lower 4G-5G bands.The 3.5 GHz and the proposed rules for the 6-7 GHz band is a hidden positive for the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, ie. New T-Mobile: competitors have put forward their recommendations that the FCC review the combined N. TMUS spectrum for exceeding the rules that limit how much a single operator can hold. According to what may be thought of as the 'old rules' or 3G-4G rules, no operator can hold over 1/3 of the spectra in the low, mid or high bands. Under 5G, the definition of the mid-band that Sprint's 2.5-2.6 GHz fits has been expanded to include up to 7 GHz. Therefore, these new rules and proposed rules mean that New T-Mobile does not exceed the 1/3 ownership rules. Of course, as a consequence of the merger, there would be three nationwide operators instead of four. That would make the 1/3 rule in need of revision to become the 1/2 rule instead. Since the new rules come before the FCC and DOJ enter the final determination deliberations, it changes the shape of how they consider the objections: under the old rules, those objections have been made obsolete. Since about 2 GHz of new mid-band spectrum will be available, New TMo's combined holdings will not come anywhere near to having 1/3 of the total."
People stop speculating. If you know something show your proof.
"T-Mobile and Sprint was reported to be closing in on an official merger agreement: Reuters reported this morning that the two sides are selecting committees who will review the due-diligence reports and other information. The normal process is for these committees to issue recommendations to the full BODs for a vote. That can include some back and forth but in this case, the BODs are closely enough controlled by the parent companies that by the time the review is made it is just another part of the process that has gained sufficient momentum to carry it forward. The minority shareholders might be allowed to vote: the article says that legal advisors think this is not a requirement, however, it could be used as a way to help cement public support for hte merger. It would open up the process to shareholder opposition, however, that could be expressed in a shareholder lawsuit (no chance of success) or other actions. Perhpas it is/was being considered as a way to get in front of shareholder opposition to the merger, most of which appears to be coming from TMUS according to recent news reports.The artucle said that a range for the exchange of Sprint stock would be the ""volume-weighted average stock price"" of ""the last few months"". That is open to interpretation. However, if true, then the excahnge rate would peg Sprint (S) at now lower than the current price level and perhaps as much as 10%-15% higher. ""the past few months"" could mean the past 3, 6 months or longer. The longer the average is taken, the higher the exchange price shifts. I think 'few months' means 3-4 months which puts S near the current price level of 7-715. It really does not matter that much because the merger involves large cost synergies and future developments that dwarf these differences."
"Uh oh, they're not buying your story....Legere may be pulling his hair out..."

Would be nice if the paid a dividend
"Factors:TMUS stock would not be diluted by the merger because it gets Sprint in the bargain. However, the debt, as well as the assets, come with the deal. If the regulators require divestiture of some of the assets or marketshare or exact constraints on how much cost savings can be realized from the transaction, then, obviously, T-Mobile (shareholders) will get less in return for the portion of the company that becomes shared with Sprint shareholders. The term ""Shareholder"" implies the sharing of a combined wealth and liabilities and that is exactly what is happening here.The reason why the deal makes sense also fit into arguments against the deal: the industry has become mature so that growth has slowed to low single digits. Profits may become squeezed as price competition tends to occur in mature industries. However, those negatives and the mounting costs to push aggressively ahead into the 5G markets that require heavy capital spending are also what compels the merger. It is a risk to do nothing or to do the deal."
"The opposition to the merger that is represented by the lawsuit AGs represent the BORG Empire's expanding embrace of all they see. From AT&T's 2018 annual report: ""Connected Devices include data-centric devices such as session-based tablets, monitoring devices and primarily wholesale automobile systems. Connected device subscribers increased in 2018 and 2017, and we addedapproximately 7.9 million and 6.4 million wholesale connected cars through agreements with various carmakers, and experienced strong growth in other Internet of Things (IoT) connections as well. We believe that these connected car agreements give us the opportunity to create future retail relationships with the car owners.”The US Department of Justice and, following their authority, the FCC, have determined that The Market that T-Mobile and Sprint operate in is the mobile consumer sector. The DoJ brain trust has followed ancient precedent (ancient by the Mobile Internet clock) that caters to the big money Duopolists view of their role in US economics. This prescription perpetuates the Big Lie that holds the minority market foreign investment dominated MNOs responsible for how competition is structured while ignoring the true current and rapidly escalating converged market space. AT&T and Verizon hold a near total monopoly on the diversified markets that comprise much of what we consider the future of wireless or 5G (and beyond). Why does AT&T and Verizon have the vast majority of car connections? It is partly because of they had more complete nationwide coverage than T-Mobile up to about three years ago. But is also because they have held 2/3rds of consumer market share for the past ~15 years. At the time automobile manufacturers and their electronics suppliers made decisions to incorporate Internet capable diagnostics and communications into their vehicles, Verizon and AT&T were the obvious choices because it was the choice of the majority of consumers and a practical choice for coverage.Each of the diversified market segments have given T and VZ unmatched power to tie products together into packages and to coerce the consumer market to go along with the government, security, enterprise, IoT/automotive market hegemony.This makes the lawsuit pressed by the state Attorneys General among the Biggest Lies ever perpetrated against the American public. To what end? Is the sector-socialist treatment of sacred cow companies sustainable? The economic consensus increasingly has come around to say no. The US cannot erect barriers to competition that protect cash-cow favorite son companies as a long-term course. It is being shortsighted. Even though economic realities are approaching like a brick wall on the near horizon, the AGs attack the unfortunate 10.5% and 17% consumer market share holders while spreading the Big Lie of ignorance and institutional buggering of market structure that perpetuates the BORG Empire control of US ICT markets."
STRONG MOVE AS I PREDICTED..... Going to RUN to $130!!!!
TMUS will start running back to 65 in the next 5 trading days as the merger clock ticks closer to the mid-october timelines.
"TMUS running on negative free cash flow in financials, while stats page show it positive. Current assets to current liabilities less than 1 while statistics page show it as 1.1"
Still way too undervalued compare to VZ
Every pension fund will be buying!
Shareholders. T-Mobile will be rebuying shares in SoftBank sale. Do you think they want to rebuy at $105 or $75? Use common sense and take profits. They will price the sale so low that you will see how much you overpaid.

Team Rap and what if all states bail before court date
All states and AG need to protect shareholders of both T Mo and Sprint protected so they dont loose money on Merger. Making sure Merger do not do manipulations to drop share prices of both T Mo and S. that must be one major investor protection by AG.

"Here is a list of Fiber Lit Buildings, which includes FTTH. ATT , VZ CHTR (spectrum) uses those number as Fiber Route Miles and Lit Buildings. They only supply backhaul in their territory.

T-Mobile CEO is very clever and playing games to generate interest and thats the main reason why the stock raises. But when the facts becomes real the stock is going to down big or top up more.
No way AAPL should be higher than us!
"Saw at least $6B worth traded (or listed) on the after hours ticker, which must be all the S&P500 index funds acquiring the needed position, to be ready for TM being added eff. 7/15/19. Thus, is that it, only about a $3 pop for that? Coincidentally, TM joins the index at its all-time high. So now, on top of all the known pros to this merger happening, it can also significantly help the S&P 500 index achieve greater new highs to the delight of its longs.To dish Dish, or not to dish Dish, that is the question. Ergen trying to be a scalper of acquired assets, or just doing all he can to delay this merger at others' cost while entertaining himself? Does TM ever give any kind of update on this merger, since it started well over a year ago? Any general update at all, verse peon having to submit to the rumor mill, that the company can disclose to keep the record straight on the on going process? Be nice if they had a press secretary with at least a weekly brief.Peon rumor mill has deal is done on what Dish basically gets, and what they basically pay. Just, they need to iron out the minor details as to how long Dish will use TM's network, how much of it will they use, and if/when/how Dish can resell acquired assets. If they even have a handshake on the bulk of the deal, and just need to do some ironing, only matter of time for the close. Seems to be the best answer to what Dish, TM/S, FCC, DOJ, 5G, S&P ... what they all want now. Yea, merger makes too much common sense ... so when is the DOJ or some Judge stamping the rejection on it?"
Legere OUT! Wow.....wonder what's next on his plate?? Sievert has got this though...$150 share price in our future!
Article about CTL / TMUS merger after S approval.

Not to mention the only REAL 5G network in the country and pure wireless play not bogged down by old legacy wireline units. Really, its a NO BRAINER, hence the recent Berkshire investment."

"The first thing Sprint and Tmobile want is for their proposal to merge to be seriously/thoroughly considered. Geesh, the merger and surrounding circumstances are complex... not couch potato entertainment quality stuff. This was bound to take a year or more."
"What if the admonitions of some leading economists of the threat of 'stagflation' come about?If the US economy were to see either high inflation or, worse, stagflation as some have been warning, the high debt sectors of the economy should be prepared to batten down the hatches. Carrying high debt levels is most advantageous when an industry is growing very rapidly or interest rates are extraordinarily low. If growth slows, as it has in the wireless space, or interest move up by a high percentage, high debt levels come under pressure to be retired. If a company can't grow its way out of debt or debt repayment requires replacement bonds, the debt burden can escalate due to higher price competition impact on margins. Stimulative measures, whether that is increased government spending caused by il conceived wars or another discretionary spending, or cuts in taxes at a time when core competitiveness is mired in legacy constructs, results in loss of productivity gains. That, the economists including former FED chair Alen Greenspan, perhaps the antagonist of the policies that eventually led to the near meltdown of the economy, argue almost will inevitably lead to some form of stagflation.The big problem with stagflation is that there is no way for government policies to bail out the negative impacts other than to mushroom spending in reaction to political pressures. And that is the opposite of a long-term fix of the situation. It just kicks the ball downhill, ending up making it that much more difficult to avert.So much for the doom and gloom. Perhaps the worse won't happen or it will take so long that it is not going to be something that companies need to react to in quick order. However, there is absolutely no doubt that there is not going to be a rosy scenario in which interest rates stay as low as they are now and the economy grows so robustly that it changes the fact of slowing growth for the mobile sector.If my opinion is fractionally right, then it makes sense for T-Mobile to reduce the debt or at least hold it near the current absolute number while growth continues. If growth prospects were to hit a roadblock, TMUS should be in debt retirement mode - whittling debt down by 1/3 to 1/2 or possibly more.."
I bet the DOJ has already decided to stopped this merger.
"The Market Realists puts the odds of the merger at just 50%. That is unreal.The premise for the blocking of mergers under antitrust laws is the prevention of overly concentrated markets, a regimen that was established over the past century based on national experience and academic studies, laws enacted by the US Congress and the states under powers granted under the constitution, and precedent established by court rulings. The breakup or prevention of market concentration has been codified into methodologies, central to which is the HHI (read about it). However, the media and sites like Market Realist have misrepresented the HHI and regulatory and court review process to mean that there must be four major operators so that lacking one at any given time breaks antitrust laws.The mistake is that the consolidation of marketshare in the industry has broekn the HHI and other measures since two wireless companies, Verizon and AT&T gained over 75% of the diversified market share. The falsehood is that maintaining Sprint as a financially dying 11% market share holder has a long-term chance of competing. The failure to merge the companies will result in Sprint's continued loss of share, having dropped from around 17% down to the 11% over the past eight years, loss of scale needed to invest in nationwide network expandion and conversion to 5G, etc. Worldwide experience:Governments around the world have attempted to regulate wireless to develop additional major competitors similar to the attempts by the FCC. They have failed in almost every case. Unless propped up by government support or they become relegated to niche markets, the economic challenge for new market entrants to build nationwide networks has failed. That is because the cost of building an additional duplicative network in a field inhabited by two or three already scaled nationwide competitors is too high to succeed. Think about this as similar to when wired electric and phone services were pioneered: At the time electricity sprung into being, private companies including Westinghouse initially offered service. Soon multiple companies sprang up in major cities. Pictures of New York streets in the era show a congestion of overhead lines, each competing to provide electricity to businesses and residents. The government had yet to regulate the industry or to require standards. Rural electric and government projects such the Tennessee Valley Authority came up. Over time, however, consolidations took place because the cost of generating power, running and maintaining wires proved economically unsustainable for all but one or two providers. Over time it became recognized that the cheapest way to provide power is to have only one major provider. Today there are multiple generating sources and one power distribution company. There are some rural electric and co-generation and distribution grids such as those used for industrial applications, but there is only one power company serving the vast majority of the country. Why don’t we break up power companies into four that must compete to service the market? That would make no sense, “You are nuts, each company would have to run their own power lines or lease them from their competitors. That would cause rising costs of power distribution which consumes a higher portion of electric bills than the generation of power at the source.” Preventing a financially struggling Sprint from merging to combine their 11% with T-Mobile’s 18% market share is directly equivalent from an economics perspective.“What about the market structure? You said that the US industry is overly concentrated, what they can do about that?”If we did not have to concern ourselves with political realities, Break out market share components of Verizon and AT&T to trust-bust the duopolists who are the primary cause of high prices and, lack of alternatives in rural areas because they have held most industry wealth creation. Why are the state AG’s not asking to break up the two companies who determine US wireless industry market structure? Why is the public advocacy groups largely mum on the subject that is so obvious the root cause for lack of competitive scale with which to pursue increased competition? Follow the money."
"T-Mobile rocked the quarter and guidance well enough to force a revisoin upward in analysts forecasts which should help give a lift to the stock. This won't help Sprint (S), VZ or T stocks."
Like how Fisher and Claure are buying into the offering. We'll have some very strong hands going forward.
need to be sell this stocks they are going down
when these guys gonna start paying a dividend
"Take a look at the mobile telecommunications sector stocks:AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), T-Mobile (TMUS), Vodafone (VOD), American Movil (AMX) have moved up recently close to their 12-month highs. Sprint (S) is near its 12-month low. Overall the US sector stocks have soared back up to 12-month highs. Some of that may be due to portfolio 'window dressing' by funds. There had been much down-playing of the prospects for the sector caused by the threat of increased price competition. That came back into play shortly after Sprint called off the merger attempt with T-Mobile. However, since then the sector has jumped up. That may due to the course Sprint has taken since: S announced a much-needed increase in capital spending on its network and increases in prices. Rather than putting the industry under more pricing pressure, Softbank-Sprint have bowed to the fact that the strategy had not worked to the degree needed. Sales had declined because subscriber growth failed to compensate. And the deep cuts in CapEx have proven unsustainable. Sprint is on a path to build shared networks while largely resigning to slow or no growth in subscribers. In other words, Sprint is unlikely to play a disruptive price game.What is the outlook for the sector stocks in 2018? The upside may hinge around how mobile content unfolds for each operator. This might accelerate well into next year as speculation might increase surrounding the role mobile operators may play in home broadband cable-replacement and video service market expansion. IoT and other sectors will likely continue to capture headlines, however, that will probably be the case over the next several years even though the amount of revenue will remain small compared to the mainstream mobile sector."
Its all over the new i guess the Stock gonna be hit hard by this news over 77 million T Mobile customers service Down? And wells forgo said today T Mobile $120? hahah I think wells forgo pump and dumpin maybe ? Well Expect big drop in T Mobile after this huge Outage nationwide. Shorts could win huge off this big outage ? well we are about to find out soon so far T Mobile did not comment or explained to any news. T Mobile after hours $104 lets see how much shorts make from those highs of $104. So Wells forgo is on The Call side or Put side to make huge cash? Could be something wells forgo know that we don't? corruptions everywhere ;)
Oh boy checked out ULTIMAT STOKCALERT (check them out) and they are more helpful than anyone else .
"Earnings later today, GREEN or RED?"
"T-Mobile call origination glitch causes a major public relations problem and, my guess, will lead to lawsuits. T-Mobile is being blamed for rob-like calling that is initiated by users phones automatically after an initial call is placed. The root cause of the problem can only be speculated about at this time as very few details have been given out. While most problems of this nature are inconsequential, resulting in a nuisance of unwanted hang-up calls to recently called contacts, the intersection of nuisance call initiation and critical services creates a major screw up.At this point its not known how these calls were being made: whether via VoIP over WiFi, VoLTE, or 3G. My guess is that it may be due to how handover occurs between WiFi calling and the mobile network. Second guess is a glitch in VoLTE calling. The reason to suspect WiFi to mobile network calling is that this is done by a transition layer or 'handshake' for each stage of the call - initiation, transport and termination of the call. Once a call is connected the mobile network should log the persistence of the call and when the call ends, either by dropped connection or termination by either end of the call. Unless the originating caller initiates a new redial, the call should not call the party back automatically. The only exception could be use of an automatic call feature on the device. In some WiFi VoIP and VoLTE situations, momentary dropped connections can be reconnected. However, that should be only for quick dropouts that are usually not detectable by the users other than a glitch in the voice. There are parts of the chain of communications that buffer the digital signal or allow short-term discontinuity in the signaling. From a wireless signaling perspective, voice and data communications occurs as packets of data that shares spectrum and network resources. On a micro-millisecond basis, calls are not truly continuous, and momentary delays are experienced. Normally, this falls within acceptable levels for latency and jitter so that it is imperceptible to users most of the time. However, it may be possible for errors to crop up in the coding. You would think that this could not occur so that recalling can happen... but then we are only speculating.I see this as the worst quality/image related problem T-mobile has faced over the past two+ years. It could blow up worse if solutions are not found or if it is found to occur in other cities.I could not help but think that this falls into AT&T's and other competitor's laps. If you let your imagination run wild, it makes for intriguing plot fodder of hired hackers going after competitors networks to exploit weaknesses in code or in operation. Just when things have been going so well, shisa happens."

Always a shakeout before the next jump. IMO no later than earnings report. Or likely a good jump with T and VZ earnings next week.
Is this normal for it not to spike immediately on good earnings?
$150 by year end?

It is good for TMUS to get S. TMUS will have leverage to deal with ATT. ATT has a lousy service and price not compare to TMUS. TMUS WILL BE HOT .
Why would anyone buy TMUS at all time highs when their parent DTEGY [ who owns over 540 million shares over 63% of TMUS ] is trading around its lows? Swap your TMUS shares for DTEGY. DTEGY is trading almost at it's cheapest ever when you back out its TMUS shares. Great opportunity to buy TMUS much cheaper.
Doesn't make enough cash to even have a dividend. Omg
"Hello, I'm a long time Sprint holder and thought I had better start following TMUS."

No dividends not worth owning. This just keeps spinning the wheels.
Who could trust a company that is always telling stories. They are as bad as some of these merger pumpers in the media and on these boards. You know that is costing a lot of shareholders money that is being wasted
"Light Reading reports that ""Huawei Bullish on Better Carrier Sales Growth in 2019"" which is in tow to what I've written here and elsewhere about the political push to have Huawei and ZTE equipment removed from networks and not used in 5G going forward. The history of infrastructure supply has been that Ericsson once held up to a 60% share of the earlier generation equipment sales with Nokia Networks, Samsung, and Motorola, comprising a large portion of the remainder. China and Japan had pursued their own 4G and beyond technology frameworks. Huawei had strongly pushed the alignment of China's standards with that of the majority of countries which is based on the 3GPP standard releases that include 3G, 4G-LTE, 4G-Advanced, 5G and 5G New Radio (NR). China has dropped efforts to build an advanced version of its homegrown TD-SCDMA 3G standard that would have become its 4G technology. Similar to IEEE 802.16, China could not gain support for TD-SCDMA to become an evolving international standard. Ditto Japan's home-grown system (it was more in alignment with 3GPP, allowing it to be converted). Contrary to what some politicians want the reality to be, China started developing 4G and 5G years before these standards were finalized. Huawei, in particular, makes many contributions to 3GPP and has a large portfolio of their own patents. What the nexus of the ""distortion field"" spinners want the reality to look like is that the US encourages banning of Huawei and ZTE equipment and that results in Huawei's sales sinking. There are dimwitted articles that pose this situation as being that Huawei might have a severe cut in business. That was based on what? Political hacking and headline-grabbing. I wrote recently that Huawei might experience a modest downturn in the growth of their business. It has grown at a rapid compounded rate because the investments that the Chinese firm made in the technology are no coming to fruition in the fielding of the complex 5G network equipment and software systems. Nothing any politician does other than long-term methodical planning of how to stimulate R&D and capital investment from the ground up in a similar fashion as to what has taken place over the past 15+ years will change the fact that the USA does not compete in that market, period."

"===8/19/2020==$158 price target===> “Verizon risks falling behind. AT&T risks falling apart. Dish’s network strategy still doesn’t hold up to scrutiny,” wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a Q2 report for investors today. But if there’s a single through-line that ties many disparate observations together, “it is that everyone is chasing T-Mobile.” Moffett’s target price for T-Mobile’s stock, which the firm rates as Buy, is now $158, up from its previous target price of $136. The firm rates Verizon as Neutral with a revised target price of $59, a decline of $3 per share versus its previous target of $62. It’s assessment of AT&T is Sell with a target price of $24."
Remember any move higher in TMUS is now only a chance to sell even more before the Government has to shut them down. Why because TMUS is not an American company and their agenda is to collect data on Americans and use it against them to farther the EU's one world order.

"Can't wait to watch Wonder Woman on my TMUS HBO Max. Oh, wait. TMUS has nothing but mobile and 75% of the population doesn't give a .... about 5G. But, they do know what 3 billion dollars of debt means."
"T-Mobile, despite the effervescent flamboyance of CEO John Legere, tends to be more down to earth about the way it talks about the prospects for 5G. And that is despite the motivation to oversell it in order to enhance the appeal of the merger.The media has latched onto the forecasts by Ericsson, Nokia-Bell Labs, Cisco and others that say there will be billions of IoT connections in coming years. The problem is that the media puts all of these connections into the 5G wireless basket.Rysavy Research wrote a white paper for 5G Americas that shows that there are several alternatives to 5G already being used or in development. These include GPRS (end of life), HSPA and WiFi. While GPRS and HSPA use will decline, low-power WiFi plus five other low-cost wireless technologies will be used in the 'free' unlicensed spectrums. These include Zigbee, LoRa, Sigfox, and BlueTooth-low energy. While all of these alternatives are 'local wireless', they can be integrated with wired/fiber and wireless communications networks for remote monitoring, data gathering, and analysis and control functions. 5G New Radio will provide a platform that has both very low power narrow-band and high bandwidth, long-range wide area network capabilities. So why not use it to replace the smorgasbord of alternative technologies? 5G is very unlikely to replace them because they use unlicensed bands and are essentially free. The big advantage of 5G, several years to come, will be that the cost of components will be driven down by the high volume applications that take advantage of the wide-area, universal type coverage, and multiple sourced-service. However, for many years, 5G faces the competition form these low-cost alternatives.Or we can just think of all of the wireless as being 5G... that makes it easy to write fantastic headlines about billions of connections and futuristic stuff like remote theater surgeries. By golly, 5G may usher in the age of real-life TV surgery - move over Cardassians."

"The court ruling hinges on a weighing of the merits of the merger as based in the laws as they have become practiced. The merger started out without DISH or any other side deal being considered. However, the US Justice Department Antitrust Division, DoJ AR, headed by Makan Delrahim, had said from the beginning that DoJ needed there to be structural rather than remedial fixes in order to overcome the legal hurdles. That does make the DISH deal a critical component of the overall deal because that is the most 'structural' of the proposed merger changes. That might have been Comcast, Charter, a group of cable companies or the DISH deal may have been constructed differently. Perhaps as the rumors suggested, Amazon or Google might have taken part in the deal. I and apparently DoJ and nT-Mobile did not see that as viable as it never went into the discussions according to the records submitted to the regulators and court.DISH is pivotal but it cannot stand outside of the rest of the deal and the supporting evidence. That is because New T-Mobile will be very instrumental in helping DISH stand up a mobile-broadband business. The first few years of DiSH's effort won't be remotely feasible if not for the lucrative access to nT-Mobile's new network, conversion of base stations, conversion of MVNO customers, etc.Therefore, Judge Marrero must weigh all of the evidence: He must consider how well nTMUS can live up to its own plans to expand service and provide low prices. He has to look at how well the competitve MVNOs will be supported under the set of agreements. Marrero must weight how much local populations will be impacted by the removal of Sprint and shift of Boost+Virgin to DISH. And then, but only if those things hold up, he must look at DISH's plans as the speculative '4th nationwide mobile operator'. The merger started out with the simpler proposition of combining T-Mobile and Sprint and then progressively layered on commitments to hold pricing low, provide long-term access under favorable terms to competing MVNOs, provide rural coverage commitments. It was not until the last quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 did the DISH agreement start to percolate up as the fix needed for the structure of the US industry that would meet legal challenges. Why would it meet legal challenges? Because of those moutains of data backed by prior experiences of T-Mobile, Sprint and the fact of DISH having the largest portfolio of low-mid band spectra... more availble to roll out 5G than AT&T, Verizon and Sprint combined. While DISH is a pivotal focus of the merger, it is only feasible when all that came before it adds up. The FCC wanted to approve the merger without DISH. The DoJ wanted a more fundamental shake up of the mobile-media-boradband space. They got that extremely extraordinary measure and that clearly meets the legal requirements.The laws saw that companies are free to merge so long as they do not cause harm to the economy/public. They do not say that there won't be some harm done to some people in some places. There is no law that says companies must not make changes if it upsets some competitors and some unions or some politicians or some investment accounts.The merger has 99.9% (up from 99.5%) chance of being approved IMO."
"T-Mobile's chart shows that despite the WSJ, Barron's and other popular financial newsie sites reporting that some person or group in DOJ may have possibly met or just had one too many at a DC bar so that they suggested that they had met with NewTM and expressed concerns that the merger was not everything they wanted or something, who knows, that the stock has remained near all-time highs.The accumulate/distribution technical indicator shows a large bullish divergence: When this indicator diverges lower than the stock price chart it is a bearish indicator. When it diverges higher than the stock price, it is a bullish indicator. It is now very bullish. This comes while the stock price is testing its highs, a point at which profits are often taken. This is the third test of the highs with each test reaching 'higher highs', which is also bullish.Seasoned 'chartists' look for multiple confirming chart patterns and indicators to signal the most favorable trading situations. Let's see what other indicators show. The Full Stochastics is above 80, which is mildly bullish. It confirms a bullish position when other indicators are bullish. This indicator is like a pendulum: When this if above 80 and other technicals turn bearish, the stock has may trend lower for multiple days. However, when above 80 and other indicators are bullish, this remains a bullish indicator of demand. Another thing chartists do is to look at multiple time periods, 1, 2, 3, 4,5 year periods and daily and weekly intervals. Sometimes the first chart period looks decisive while others don't or look the opposite. That isn't good because it can mean that there is pent up selling pressure. I've seen many 1 year charts that look decisively bullish while the longer-term charts revealed that there had been a long, high volume period at that level in the past that presents resistance that the shorter term chart failed to reflect. In this case, TMUS looks like it may soon break out to a higher level of new highs. Sprint's (S) chart does not look similarly bullish. The stock faces greater impact due to the uncertainty of the merger approval. It hands on that - if the approval is granted, then S will shoot up to make up the discount to the merger ratio. If not, S will sink toward $2-3 IMO."
"Bring your TMUS shares, cut in half..."
This is the last thing Tmobile and Sprint wanted to see a delay. now the cats out of the bag and everyone knows this deal is trash. Thats why the stock is up Tmobile does not need Sprint

"Some things T-Mobile, Deutsche TK, Sprint and Softbank would have done differently in crafting of the merger proposal:- Emphasized Sprint's weakness to compete more strongly early on.- Made a clear distinction between the mainstream mobile market and the 'emerging 5G markets'. Then show that Verizon and AT&T have all but locked up the majority of the ICT industry's most promising markets. That would have reinforced the argument that the merger is needed in order for there to be more competition across the board and that the 5G Markets had already become dominated to such a degree that it has become a de facto monopoly/duopoly. In other words, ""Without the merger, there will be little competition in 5G. particularly in growth markets that AT&T and Verizon have already become monopolists. With the merger, NewTM will be able to break up the market concentration.""- Offered a framework agreement to all fiber and hybrid fiber and cable operators for joint development of 5G 'First Mile' networks. This would help assure the 'fourth leg of competition' in the ICT industry. Moreover, it would position NewTM as a positive structural influence that is pro-competitive along the lines that the FCC has said they would welcome.There is much of the above already posited in the merger. However, it has not been presented clearly and with the emphasis that may have short cut much of the opposition within and external to the DOJ.Opposition to the merger was expected from the start. Some of it would be laughable if the outcome were not so serious: the labor issue is a political and social hot potato. While companies should not be required to hire people as a result of mergers, the political climate makes it necessary to promise to do so. The media says that the merger will lessen competition in wireless. However, they largely ignore that Sprint cannot be a price leader as it sinks further into debt. That is a 'going out of business sale' that is not sustainable. The merger may or may not be under increased pressure by the DOJ. We shall see, maybe within 3-6 weeks."

"When the economy and stock markets are being ruled by external events with no near-term fix, it is time not to listen to the 'experts' who tell individual investors to 'just hang in there, markets always recover'. What we learn from past bear markets is that the 'smart money' often speaks one thing to the public and does another thing for their own accounts (two-faced liars). That is because of several reasons: 1) Much of the media, some financial analysts and advisors do not want to further panic the markets. They adopt the stance that is better to tell people to hang onto investments because that works during the normal swings. It does not work in bear markets. 2) Institutional investors have large numbers of shares to move. They want others to buy/hold so they can clear out. The financial media report hedge funds to have made billions from shorting the market and investing in hedges against collapse in commodities (oil for example), and derivative bond hedges. The last thing the professionals want is for the public to wake up and adopt the same strategies that make them rich. 3) The government’s job is to ‘instill confidence’ that despite whatever is taking place that the American Public can weather the storm. We expect that of our government officials... tell us the facts but with a shot of confidence building pep talk. Those who act to take advantage of the circumstances by selling long positions (unless known to be counter-cyclical) and either waiting until the dust settles or profiting from the move down will come out on top. Bear markets will not turn around just because we want them to. Whatever is causing the downturn has to be worked out and that can take from months to years. Deep depression periods have seen stock prices drop to 20% of their value while some businesses go bankrupt or are sold for pennies on the dollar. Only masochists can enjoy that.What to do now: The same thing as in the past: If long, place stop-loss orders based on support levels, chart formations, indicators and movement in excess of norms. You may think that the worst is over and could be right. However, you do not want to be holding during sharp downturns. If investors held on through the sharpest downturn in US market history, the same rules apply today and always. Get your egotistic emotions out of the game or be ground into toe jam. If sitting on the sidelines with the profits you made, you are in position to trade the ups and downs. If you have a preference to be long, trading the volatile market can eventually lead to the return of a bull market for your stocks. Your trading positions will turn into longer-term holds because the downside triggers will not be reached. Trillions of dollars have been changing hands.. into your hands or the people telling you ‘just hang in there’?"

"TMUS long-term chart trends, and technical indicators remain bullish and in-line with improvements in company fundamentals. I may be overly cautious, however, the telecommunications sector has, as an index, had a long-in-the-tooth run over the past several months. Expectations have grown that there will be M&A talks once the 600MHz auction ends. If less than is expected occurs, such as no substantive talks taking place, the speculative fervor may subside and the stock with it. Add in the Dallas bull loose in the China shop, and there is some risk that a pull back in the stock may occur. This is only a note to be a bit closer to the trigger finger. The stock remains in a long-term bullish trend and indicators have not turned bearish as of now."

"Altice (ATUS) is reportedly preparing a bid for Charter cable. However, there is skepticism that the less than $30 billion market cap company could make a purchase nearly as large as Charter.""Houston, we have a problem."" There is a major disconnect that has turned up from time to time in capital markets: At times there is a surplus of capital available for bonds that help to fuel M&A activity. This is amplified by the state of Wall Street: investment banks are hungry to facilitate M&A deals because new IPOs and mergers are at a low ebb. The wolves, starved from their usual gluttony, may help to push M&A on client companies. And interest rates are very low. Even though low-end junk bond debt is at relatively high-interest rates, junk bonds, in general, are at a level that helps to stimulate M&As. What does not make sense is to acquire companies in sectors that have seen the vast amount of their growth trend evaporate for a hefty premium. The MBA program includes teaching advanced corporate strategy including when and how to accumulate acquisitions and when to plunder profits or sell off 'cash cows' in order to fuel profits or fund a new crop of 'rising stars'. The cable companies are far from being 'rising stars' and, unless they break the wired cable company mold, are destined to become utility-like operations. Wireless broadband will inevitably displace much of the need for cable or relegate it to a supporting role as an alternate metro grid and premises broadband link that is connected to 99% of the time via wireless. Going into debt to acquire a cable company at this juncture requires there to be a solid plan to move on to hybrid fiber-cable-wireless networks that take share from wireless giants Verizon and AT&T or that makes them part of the merger.Parent company Deutsche Telekom has operated in many locations in Europe in which cable, fiber, and wireless are operated. They should have a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations, cost savings and also when the hype is overblown. Paying too much for a cable company makes no better sense than paying too much for Sprint: the investment bankers, media, some financial analysts tend to pump up the prospects and downplay how the huge debt may constrict competitiveness down the road. Prospects for growth are countered by the prospect that convergence of markets, consolidation of apps and simplified ease of use will help trim the overall growth in multiple-service revenues while it adds to the number of competitors or degree of revenue sharing in order to field the complete package including content from multiple origins. If cable and wireless competitors are near their zenith, then there is no reason to pay a lofty premium to acquire them unless thoroughly justified by savings and new expansion prospects. That is not to say that TMUS-DT should not exhaust all efforts to create a more competitive platform through acquisitions. However, it must leverage more than cost reductions. A merger at this juncture should have the purpose to create a platform that is more competitive and more timely than Verizon or AT&T are likely to deliver."

"Quick Recap: FCC & DOJ approval, added to S&P500, record quarter reported, Son & Claure on public record basically saying the obvious which is virtually no fear of States blocking, Höttges reaffirms $40+ billion in synergies, and all indication is the companies are, let's say unofficially, already merging. After all that, why did TMUS get?Verizon upgraded, and it's stock is way up today.Dish gets double upgraded, Ergen $16m buy, and has been way up and continuing to rise since.S is way up today.T is up today.Even FTR is way up over 6% today.Dow up way over 200 points today.And TMUS is DOWN today.Report of Soros selling out, and Oppenheimer downgrade, so does that Trump everything else (all the other buyers and upgrades)? BTW, Oppenheimer Funds added like 50,000 shares as was reported for quarter ending in March. Am looking to see what they did for quarter ending in June, and will be very interested to see what they did when the 3rd (current) qtr is reported. Their analyst tells the peon its downgraded, and to sell, so better see Oppenheimer dumping wads of TMUS now. For if their analyst is telling the peon one thing (sell), while they are actually doing the opposite (buying), then will prove they don't practice what they preach and are an utter disgrace in my book."

"Off topic: Can the USA kick-start an entry into 5G network supply to compete with China's Huawei and other suppliers? This was the main topic on the agenda of a the BIS 2019 conference last week in Washington, DC.Some within the US Defense Department have attempted to create a national 5G effort by gathering together venture capital firms with network equipment and other companies and government sponsored research efforts. This will not work. The problem is that 5G is here now. There are no, zero, nada, negative infinity, US-based mainstream 4G or 5G network system suppliers from which to build 5G products and the requisite services.This shows the root problem for why the US does not compete in 4G-5G: the government lacks the technological think tank is on a world-class level. Often heard as a perfunctory excuse are statements that the government cannot pick technology winners and any long-term effort would throw money away. That only shows that these people and the groups they advocate lack the skills and focus to determine the future direction of technological developments. There is a reason to the revisionists opinions: Governments around the world often fail at choosing the right paths for technological development. For example: The Chinese government and major research institutes primarily had pushed the country's own TD-SCDMA technology as the 4G standard. However, the central government gave ZTE and Huawei a seat at the long-term planning table. They strongly advocated that China must join with international efforts as outlined by the ITU and developed by the 3GPP standards organization. They argued that the technologies being considered for the then future 4G+ would prove supperior to China's own standard. However, there is where the differences between the US system of government and China's become clear: instead of forcing the previous state-sponsored standard on the industry, they engaged in meetings and document exchanges at which Huawei and ZTE had to prove the case for the emerging 4G LTE standard. These discussions were not the polical shouting matches indicative of US policy meetings. nor did they center around trade strategies or other concerns. They did not chose based on which group had the most money backing them or how much they contributed to election campaigns and how clever the lawyers hired by the lobbyists were. They sat down to the hard work of figuring out the better technological and world adoption pathway. Yet, soe at the US Defense Department and other branches of America's govfernment say it cannot be done. They offer up the magic mantra that 'Free Enterprise decides best' while missing the point of there needing to be decisions made outside of vested interests and by those who are thinking in 5, 10, 20, and 50 year time frames rather than the costs and profits for the next quarter or year. China, of course, went on to adopt 3GPP standard efforts as the primary platform for wireless network development. The national government did not interfere in the R&D of the private sector companies including ZTE and Huawei. In fact, ATE had, on two seperate junctures, faced going bankrupt. In the first instance because ZTE had failed to ganer sufficient sales of its products either inside China or international markets. In the second instance because US sanctions contributed to what had already been slow sales . The point being that the Chinese government did not step in on large scale to prop up ZTE. They did provide low interest loans which helped. However, ZTE has paid back early loans and is required to pay back latter ones... that looks like how free enterprise works in America more than the cheat-sheet claims that the Chinese government is responsible for what these private companies have accomplished. The big problem is the USA is extremely short sighted, political and self-interested in developing any national effort. We fail to plan... which the old axiom goes, is failing to succeed. There are those who studied the technologies and determined, years in advance of 4G and 5G, which technologies and methods to pursue. That is why Huawei hired me at the time. DARPA, et al didn't."

"Why do they not want to trade services with CTK to get merger done. This is the CTL backhaul network size. They have the only conduit based backhaul network across the country.

Storey said, “CenturyLink owns and operates nearly all of the major next-generation long-haul fiber networks ever built in the U.S. We have more than 150,000 on-net enterprise buildings on our global network. We connect to more than 2,200 public and private data centers and have connectivity to approximately 60 web scale data centers.”Dugan said that in addition to reaching a broad customer base with fiber, “wireless towers are also taken into our fiber plant. We hit quite a few towers today.”"

"enjoy ===> T-Mobile Stock Could Offer Safety in a Recession, Analyst Says -- Barrons.com DJ Verizon and T-Mobile Stock Could Offer Safety in a Recession, Analyst Says -- Barrons.com By Eric J. Savitz If you're looking for a place to hide in a recession, there are some opportunities in the telecommunications sector. But you need to be picky. In a research note released Tuesday morning, New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin points out that the telecom sector outperformed the market in both the 1980 and 2008 recessions. He advises investors to stick with companies ""exposed to strong secular trends,"" while staying wary of companies with high financial leverage. He sees Verizon Communications (VZ) and the tower companies, like American Tower REIT (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC), as ""most insulated,"" with higher risks for Dish Network (DISH), Sprint (S), AT&T (T), and the cable stocks. In a recession, Chaplin writes, ""the best performers within our coverage universe will be those with the most wireless exposure, the highest margins currently, the lowest leverage, and dividend support,"" and he concludes that "" Verizon wins on all four fronts,"" with the tower companies close behind. Chaplin writes that T-Mobile US (TMUS) is also well protected, with the benefits of wireless exposure and low leverage, partly offset by lower margins. In fact, he contends that if T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint closes, T-Mobile might be the best-positioned company in the group. ""While T-Mobile would face slightly more risk than Verizon and the towers on a stand-alone basis, a merger with Sprint could almost entirely offset the impact of a recession,"" he writes. ""It's complicated: a deal would push leverage higher and lower margins at the outset, increasing exposure to a recession; however, the synergies should more than offset these pressures. At Sprint, deal approval would actually drive upside in a recession; however, we wouldn't own Sprint because of the risk of restructuring if the deal breaks."" Chaplin adds that he would avoid cable stocks, as media and pay TV tend to do poorly in downturns. ""In prior recessions, these industries have seen sharper slowdowns in revenue growth and greater reductions to valuation multiples relative to other industries in our coverage,"" he writes. ""In the case of Pay TV, we think recession risk would be worse today because there is now a viable substitute -- OTT -- that wasn't present in prior recessions."" OTT stands for over-the-top, or streaming, media services. The analyst writes that the picture gets complicated in a downturn for companies that need substantial additional capital. ""Most companies with higher leverage have greater equity risk simply from multiple compression; however, in the case of Sprint and Dish, we also see liquidity risk,"" he writes. ""Absent a deal with T-Mobile, we don't think Sprint has enough cash and revolver capacity to cover all of their debt maturities over the next three years; if they cannot access the capital markets, they may need to sell spectrum to stay solvent."" He adds that Dish faces a different problem: If the T-Mobile/Sprint deal is approved, Dish will need to raise $10 billion in new capital to build a new wireless network. ""It will be more difficult for them to do this in the public markets in a recession,"" he writes. ""We don't think there is material risk of Dish missing buildout deadlines and losing licenses; however, delays in the network build would likely put additional pressure on the equity."" AT&T is down fractionally in recent trading. Dish is off just under 1%, and Verizon is off 2%, at $54.73. T-Mobile is up $1%, at $80.53, Sprint is up 1.3%, at $8.17, and the tower stocks are up slightly. Among the cable companies, Comcast (CMCSA) is off 1.9%, at $37.17, and Charter Communications (CHTR) is up 0.9%, $467.11. The S&P 500 is up 1.8%."
"Amazon Now wants a wireless service. They would throw so much money at it that TMUS profits would be ZERO. That is last guy you want in the wireless business. They would get install productivity to new levels with GPS tracking, heartrate monitors with following drone cameras to make sure they are working hard. Your heartrate is in unacceptable low energy range. work harder with the electric jolt. You need to give up on the Sprint Merger and cross license or buy/sell spectrum needed. Make the deal between each other."

"Where do T-Mobile and Sprint go from here? Mergers/acquisitions are monumental events that shake up the operating profiles and positions of the companies. With a merger off the table, Sprint and T-Mobile will go back to business as usual. T-Mobile has been on a sustained upward track that should continue. Growth will likely become harder to maintain as the company grows, however, it is in a strong position in spectrum and network expansion that will continue to help TMo grow. The low-frequency bands improve prospects in rural and general service, IoT, and enterprise markets.Sprint has plans to increase capital spending. This has become a necessity in order to hold onto their current position. Although Softbank and Sprint emphasize the ability to serve growth in IoT, the company's spectrum is less suited to that task than T-Mobile, VZ or T. The company has communicated that the ownership of ARM will help Sprint in IoT. Some analysts have listened to that to conclude that Sprint's prospects for IoT will help improve overall results. I do not think so. Sprint has little chance of showing growth that impacts the overall sales and profit picture much, if at all.Sprint's best remaining hope is to demonstrate a significant advantage in the marriage of Altice's HFC, Hybrid Fiber and Cable network with Sprint's tiered wireless network, what the company calls the 'Sprint Magic Box'. The concept is older than 3G: Use of in-home and/or roof or wall mounted transceivers to connect to smallcell and/or macrocell base stations. Using this with cable and fiber eliminates traffic bottlenecks. It can also help transform how the network operates with more connections being made from the localized tier that is anchored by cable and fiber and less traffic on the traditional mobile WRAN portion of the network. A major advantage of this approach works to better relative advantage for Sprint: the cost of using picocells and smallcells on user's homes and buildings is much less than units placed on utility poles, roofs, etc. by the operator.The way this will likely play out is that Sprint will continue to struggle to find more leverage of its high-frequency band spectrum. The announced increases in spending will result in a restricted cash position and more net losses. In other words, even though the effort with small Altice may demonstrate the path Comcast and Charter may be encouraged to follow and the increased CapEx may deliver more network improvements, the impact for the near-term will be negative to the bottom line. The payback does not scale well. T-Mobile's expansion into 600 MHz will take a few years. Some gains in rural coverage are coming online early. The company is making some progress in new devices that will work on the band, however, this will not have much impact on the urban-suburban segment of the market soon. What happens to the stock? There may be somewhat of a 'wait and see after the dust settles' - the stock rebounds a bit but goes mostly sideways into early 2018. There is some trepidation that Sprint will be more aggressive, putting downward pricing pressure on TMo. I don't think much will change in the effectiveness of Sprint as a competitor. What may hold TMUS back is the lack of new stimulus. So long as the performance meets company guidance, TMUS should rise as a result. Maybe it will come in the form of a 'January effect' rally."

"Part of what fuels the next stage of mobile/ICT wireless are the enabling components. In order to deliver 5G, there must be a range of chips that cover from the low-priced IoT applications to the most demanding SmartPhone devices which include many features. The new chips must transmit and process multiple signal streams simultaneously. That makes power consumption a challenge. Along with the chips are requirements for 4x4 MIMO antennas that operate over the multiple bands. 5G mobile applications require that phones and otehr devices work on low, mid and high-band spectra including simultaneous operation. That results in the need for RF tranceivers and antenna that work in the multiple bands. The accomodation of 4X4 antennas that can work in the low-band in which the wavelengths are long as well as higher frequncies has compelled suppliers to produce them using sophisticated antenna technologies such as fractal and diversity geometry designs.What is important to know is that the devices have come available to fuel the variety of applications from IoT that is the very low cost per unit to high-end phones which must pack several sets of matching antennas into the handheld footprint."
Just wow...beats by 60 cents.
"build 5G networks need $20bln, T-MOBILE only have $1.3bln cash, SO T-Mobile have to rise big debt, but T-Mobile doesn't have enough money to pay big debt, because it make a little money, I don't trust it's CEO."

"Mobile World Live (ezine from Mobile World event) headline: ""German operators agree (to) network operating pact”""Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica Deutschland and Vodafone Germany unveiled a proposal to coordinate construction of 6,000 radio sites across the country, in a bid to slash the cost of meeting controversial rural coverage targets.”The article mentions the German regulator but does not provide history behind this agreement including that T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom, sued the German regulator against the requirement to co-build, co-use of the rural network. Deutsche can be a real douche bag BORG-like company... very much out of phase with the zeitgeist of T-Mo’s current management. Life and business are complex and can be magical or real shitsa storms.Germany is among many nations around the globe, including Taiwan, China, Japan, Canada, multiple Scandinavian countries, India whose regulators or the operators on their own initiatives have confronted the problem of building networks in rural areas or where the costs or difficulties of urban environments force shared facilities. The US FCC has been behind the curve and almost ineffective in furthering similar moves. We dare not force corporate legal entities to do anything they do not want... we shout ‘communist!’. Well, it's not at all communist… states from the time of the dawn of civilization have made requirements for sharing of facilities from the Roman aqueducts to the current movement for shared facilities. Communism is, dear fellow illiterates, where the state takes over ownership and management. Requirements on individuals and businesses that are so obviously beneficial are ‘business as usual’.!!!!!Another way that New T-Mobile stands apart: The extraordinary set of agreements includes the co-use of networks through MVNO, roaming, and shared access rights. The parties worked out the means to accomplish this rather than due to broad regulatory requirements. Yes, the FCC and DOJ have required market restructuring that caused something like this set of agreements to develop, but the regs did not dictate the terms. The result is similar without the explicit regulation. What you should see is that the need for co-build, co-use of facilities is a national priority in much of the world and is growing by example. The reason this is growing is because it makes economic sense. Rural areas have fewer people to share the cost of building and operating networks (real duh). Corporations are often headed by people with oversized egos who make decisions in the context of a system that does not reward cooperation as much as predatory practices. So when we see T-Mobile and the other companies involved pursuing agreements that are in alignment with shared access in rural areas it should be congratulated."

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-tmus-stock-gets-024133019.html I'll post this again for you all. ""Kvaal’s both sides win scenario is based on a simple analysis. Should the merger gain approval, the deal, according to Kvall could send TMUS stock up to $104 as it fulfills T-Mobile’s objective of obtaining Sprint's mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum and would allow the communications giant “to realize significant synergies.” Not to mention, the new size will allow it to up the competition with the larger AT&T and Verizon.And the downside? There is no downside, argues Kvaal. A rejection of the deal would finally bring resolution to the saga and “could remove a sizeable multiple impediment and restore T-Mobile’s modest premium.” The analyst expects the stock to rise following a rejection, too; Up to $93 by his estimates. The deal has a 45% chance of approval, concludes the analyst."""
Rumors TMUS and Sprint buying into CTL for backhaul. CTL is up on big volume
"The PR reads:""T-Mobile, Ericsson, and Intel Complete World’s First 5G Call on 600 MHzThe achievement marks another milestone on the road to nationwide 5G What’s the news: T-Mobile, Ericsson, and Intel have achieved the world’s first 5G data call and video call on 600 MHz, both on a live commercial network. T-Mobile also accomplished a tri-band 5G video call with three users on different spectrum bands – 600 MHz, 28 GHz, and 39 GHz.Why it matters: Only the New T-Mobile is focused on bringing 5G to everyone, everywhere, and this latest successful test takes America one step closer to nationwide broad, deep 5G coverage.Who it’s for: Anyone who thinks 5G should 1) be available to everyone, everywhere and 2) work indoors and out.""While competitors all claim to be rolling out 5G on mobile phones, only T-Mobile is doing that 'the True 5G Way"" (my words). Why is that the 'True 5G way'? Because the only way users can benefit from the seamless use of 5G is if the coverage of 5G is everywhere.Take one for instance:Say a Verizon, Sprint or AT&T customer buys a new $500 (with subsidies) 5G Smartphone that uses 24, 28, 21, 39, 3.5 or another GHz band for the 5G connection. If that is a direct link then the latency should be 'True 5G quick'. If that super high-speed link has to make several hops before connecting to the user, then the 5G latency may look the same as 4G and is no longer 'True 5G' because some leading-edge applications will perform no differently than on 4G.Also, consider that the new 5G phone customer goes into a building or away from the limited metro and highway corridor overage area of the impostors 5G networks. They still will hold a 5G phone in their hands but they will be connected to a 4G or 3G network. The latency and bandwidth may see a marginal improvement because it makes use of the latest chips but it will not be 'True Mobile 5G'.Is any service that is not mobile a 'True 5G' service? I do not think so. Fixed-location service requires a separate piece of gear, the home router. That is a very fine capability but it is a subset of 5G. 3GPP and other authorities call it that. The stand-alone 5G networks that enterprise and governments are likely to come to use are also sub-sets of 5G .. until they are enabled to work with a 'True 5G' network that provides wide-area coverage. The most astounding applications will require very low end-to-end latency. That means that if the user connection is switching between 5G and 4 or 3G, it is only 5G some of the time and a 'failure to communicate' while on the lower grade connections.Not one US operator now has 'True 5G'. If you read the various PR there are now four number 1s who all offer 5G. T-Mobile is the only US operator that is reasonably holding the reigns on their BS, er marketing department from making premature claims about 5G. A casual observer might expect to open up the quarterly results of Verizon, AT&T, Sprint to see massive revenues are flowing in. There have been fresh announcements re-announcing 'We are first with 5G!' about every week.Come on guys, are you that desperate to look like you deserve to hold monopolies? Be sincere and objective or the marketing swill will catch up as T-Mobile moves forward with 'True 5G' that (almost) everyone will be able to use."

Analyst day with the CEO today right? Anyone guess what we can expect?
"The most telling metrics: Very low churn rate of the #1 and 2 players and the slow industry growth rate and commoditization of mobile devices and services.The only industry catalyst that has the magnitude to change up the level of competition is the push of mobile into the home and small business broadband market. The pits mobile against fiber-cable broadband which is not going to be easy or cheap unless ways are found to mitigate costs.However, T-Mobile can continue to grow organically over the next few years: T-Mobile can take retail share away from other mobile operators. Even if that slows from the prior pace, the improvement in coverage and bandwidth provide the ability to accelerate growth into the corporate and other markets dominated by VZ and T. T-Mobile's smaller size and newly exploited spectrum, may provide it with the headroom to push into broadband to the home/SOHO market at a tolerable pace. For a while at least, T-Mobile is in the driver's seat. They don't have to do a deal now. AS wired and wireless markets collide, there may be fallout among competitors. Sprint looks vulnerable now but the price tag may be lower or TM might take away marketshare without acquiring the company going forward. In any case, DT/TM are in a good position to dictate terms of a deal."
this is gaining momentum in the open

"The 3.5-3.7 GHz band, which was called the broadband innovation band, looks close for a final decision by the FCC in how it will be licensed. This is an alternative mid-band spectrum that can be used in wide channels that can be used for cable replacement similar to Sprint's 2.5 GHz band 41. The release of the spectrum will give T-Mobile a fall-back position for deployment of mobile 5G that includes a home broadband component."
"Just saw 100,000 share block go through at $132 AH"

"So it was interesting what the Boyz said to the Gang on the Hill. It reminded me of Son when he met with us after he purchased Sprint. He told us he had the money, know how, and other resources to turn Sprint around. He was going to make us No.2 and build out the fastest network around. Sprint was going to do “Great Things”.while being a leader in wireless. I wish I could send that video up to the Hill for the Gang to watch but no one made one. Everyone knows that if this merger goes through the stock will drop. It will be in the low 40s in no time."
The only 4th carrier that would help comes with backhaul rights. CTL is the best choice. Not in the biz would take time startup.
As I glance at this board it’s obvious to mute “R” LOL
"""Confidence, it will go down.."" Yea, that is what stocks do, go up and down. That describes no more than saying 'there are waves on the ocean.' TMUS has held up very well in the tech-stock sell-off that has hit many popular stocks by 25-33% or more from their highs. That is partly due to TMUS not having been over-priced when the markets started selling off. Despite having moved to new highs, TMUS never reached a valuation that was out of line with its fundamentals and earnings forecasts. The theme of the stock remains intact and is more dependent on the pursuit of advantages in a spectrum and network position, and market image and momentum. The economy and trends in the market do matter. However, T-Mobile has a huge market to conquer.. namely taking share away from its much larger rivals and gaining leverage and cost savings by merging with Sprint. The market topped out months ago. The financial media and analyst are trying to guess where it will head from here... does the market need to reach a stage of capitulation in which a portion of 'weaker hands' throw them up and sell in disgust of their past recklessness? Or does the market just 'bottom out' and then, after consolidation has taken place, heads upward? One way to judge market or stocks is how news impacts them:When stocks have been low/undervalued while the economy and financials are OK or improving, an indicator they may be ready to move up is when bad news has a little or only temporary impact. That signals that 'all the bad news is in there' - has been anticipated and the favorable trends compensate.When stocks gain upward momentum and 'bad news' is ignored while 'good news' sends them up, its time to ride the tide.When good news starts having little or no impact or, more telling, stocks move lower because it fails to meet the rose-tinted expectations of investors, it signals a time to take profits or put in stop-loss orders (which is a good idea at every stage)."
"The prospects for the merger have, once again, been blasted in the media as facing opposition from the DOJ for lack of structural reform. WSJ, and several other news sources have reported similar to this: (Reuters) - ""The U.S. Justice Department has told T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp it has concerns about their proposed $26 billion merger in its current structure, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, although no final decision has been made.""The legal framework and mechanisms for determining whether companies operating in a market should be allowed to merge (or be broken up) includes the HHI and market impact analysis. This is a foundational aspect of how DOJ Antitrust Division has and will operate. The way that structure is applied has undergone change due to the fast-paced nature of technological development that has caused markets to increasingly overlap. At the extreme, the collision of fiber-cable, media, wireless, Internet and computing can lead to the elimination of a segment of the market altogether. Either the dominant species overtakes the less genetically equipped in a Darwinian survival of the fittest, or acquisitions take place that gobbles up the declining species. Because of that, the US DOJ and similarly in other countries/unions, has increasingly allowed some mergers that would not qualify under the past determinations such as the HHI. That is because their analysis showed that the structure of the subject 'market' has or is in the process of changing to make that determination less relevant or obsolete. This is what appears to be a part of the struggle of opinions going on within the DOJ. While the DOJ tends to holds its opinions and process tightly, enough has been exposed through past rulings, assessments of experts, industry group meetings, etc. to piece this together."
"There has been a growing field of thought among economists familiar with the wireless industry that there is a role for a true 'Maverick' to do mergers or be excluded from them. This is not entirely accepted (yet), but the dynamic mobile industry has provided many examples already where a company shook up the market by innovations in networks (technology) and markets. While the opposition grabbed hold of this as a point in their favor, in fact, it was the opposite given their mere opposition without introducing any solutions. The opposits, including the State AG's lawsuit, have argued that both T-Mobile and Sprint are Market Mavericks who must be kept separate or else they will lack the motivation to continue. The opposit is true: The industry has been trending since its inception towards higher concentration. When a Maverick enters without enough force to shake up the status quo, having two of them often leads to the dissolution of capital efficiencies needed to wage the aggressive battle in the first place. The AGs lawsuit flies in the face of reason in many places. This one is more esoteric than blaming mergers on reduction in jobs, a topic the NY ITW makes a mockery of.The ICT market needs Mavericks willing to build a business on seeking out benefits for customers, the public, within the laws that predicate a Free Enterprise Market and willingness to challenge conventions. If those Mavericks grow old and grey spirited. new Market Mavericks must be found. The USA can't stop. The World can't stop. We need deep revolutions or whatever it is we are building is skrewed."

The FCC and DOJ has to block this merge. Since the economy is slow and we going through a recession within the United States. If FCC or DOJ whoever approves this merger with T-Mobile and Sprint. Think about the massive lay-off for both companies. How it will effect US economy and boost faster recession for us. I don’t won’t to see hundreds of thousands American or 40 thousands American people lose job. Because of the merger been approve. No American wents to go through Great Recession!

"One way that the AT&T+TW merger helps the New T-Mobile merger is that it holds that there are multiple players in the media content and delivery market. That helps to shift the thinking of government to consider New TM's argument that there is also a shift in the wireless space that pits some of the same players and the 'continental shift' in how markets overlap to compete and away from the solo market-concentration determination. The former administration, which had generally been considered as less friendly towards mergers, had considered T's arguments that there is competition from the exploding demand for OTT content from providers such as NetFlix and YouTube. One problem with the New T-Mobile merger is that the media content providers are 'in the face' of everyone while what happens with networks is mundane. People vaguely interpret that the merger would reduce competition because it would be obvious - the combining of two retail competitors. The arguments that the combined company will be more competitive requires an understanding of a mountain of facts, not easy for even intelligent netizens to undertake."
DOWN TMUS goes just like a Foreign Company that T Mobile is. Your DATA is NOT safe in the hands of a foreign company who has an agenda to collect data on the USA and use it to farther the EU's one world order.
DOJ approval today??Yes please
The merger is not failing till the government says so!
I don't see how VZ or T can compete with TMUS and 4 5G lines for only $100. They are going to gain huge market share and that's nowhere near priced into the stock yet. It's trading at less than half of the enterprise value of VZ and T and that gap will narrow quickly imo.

"How likely are mergers and acquisitions among mobile, cable and other companies in ICT as the Trump administration prepares to take office?The reasons for acquisitions to take place stem from two main factors: 1) The need to compete on the basis of scale with larger players, namely Verizon and AT&T. This includes operating efficiencies including a) operation of nationwide networks and marketing leverage. 2) The consolidation of industry segments that is being caused by the evolution of technology. Wireless is becoming similar to wired networks in the ability to deliver broadband. Over time wireless service will exceed 1Gb data rates at a similar cost per bit as cable networks. While data usage over wireless networks remains a fraction of that experienced on wired cable and fiber optic networks, it is growing more rapidly. Operators have swung back to offering unlimited data plans: this time around it looks on the precipice of replacing the need for wired networks for a large percentage of the US population. Interest rates remain low, helping to ease M&As.What holds back M&A activity is that many of the companies already have high levels of debt and regulatory resistance. For deals to make financial sense the sum of the parts must result in paying back additional debt and making up for restrictions and spin-offs that might be imposed by regulators.This isn't the place for analysis, however, Sprint+T-Mobile continues not to make sense for a number of reasons. T-Mobile+Comcast or Charter makes the more sense because the combined debt is tolerable, regulators more likely to allow it, assets unlikely to be spun out, and the combination of wired and wireless networks are synergistic to delivering higher density of broadband and vertical market services."
"looks like whatever deal premium that was put in after the start of the year has been taken out,another cpl of points,so we go back to the basics,so whats this worth with little known deal prospects for the rest of the year.im hoping that we wont go into an endless cycle of deal rumours."

But their own words prove them wrong.Myth: Neither company can launch a 5G network on its own.Fact: Before they announced a merger, both companies aggressively touted their ability and plans to launch a 5G network. T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in 2017 that his company would “leapfrog” Verizon and AT&T and be first to “real, mobile, nationwide 5G” by 2020. And Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in February 2018 that the carrier would launch a nationwide 5G network in 2019.Myth: The United States needs this deal to secure a 5G network and maintain its leadership in 5G.Fact: AT&T and Verizon are both building out and launching their own 5G networks. Verizon has already launched 5G in several markets and AT&T plans to offer mobile 5G in 12 cities by the end of 2018.Myth: This deal would let the two companies invest more in their 5G.Fact: According to their statements to Wall Street, the two companies were already planning to spend on 5G roughly the same amount that they told the FCC they would spend if they were allowed to combine."

How much is the debt that Sprint brought into T-Mobile going to affect the earnings numbers...
Rumor is Tmus is interested in CTL and that is why Sunit Patel went to TMUS. To make the deal for buy in. TMUS buying in is the rumor for 5G backhaul. That is why they had to change the rules so it would not have a controlling interest. So it does not mess up there Sprint Merger. It allowed them to buy in and not seen as a takeover.

"CTO Neville Rays blog sums up some things I have been pounding the board with posts:""Is mmWave spectrum important? Absolutely. But really, game-changing, innovation driving 5G requires broad and deep nationwide coverage. And *that* can only be achieved by using ALL SPECTRUM BANDS.""Starting with 4G, wireless has begun delivering the most impact when multiple bands are used in harmony or to fit specific use cases. Instead of fitting the proverbial 'round pegs into square holes'. I began saying 'The best spectrum is a combination of low, mid and high-band, at least three years before 4G rolled out. In fact, I had pushed the members of the IEEE 802.16 group, the WiMAX Forum trade group, and 3GPP to make use of the low-band spectrum a priority. I chaired a session in DC at which the holder of the largest amount of 700 MHz at that time said his firm, Aloha Partners, wanted WiMAX startups or the mobile operators to acquire their spectrum. That was a couple of years prior to the FCC auction. The vision was to use low band in combination with mid-band to build in the combination of coverage and high bandwidth. While that was early times, the advantage was even more revolutionary that many years ago because of the time-to-market advantage.NewTM has a time-to-market advantage now. And it has become much more practical with far fewer obstacles."

"Don't rule out nothing. If deal with Sprint dies and If Legere leaves I believe prices for wireless will go up, which also means higher earnings for the companies but bad for the consumer."
"The change in management, Mike Sievert replacing John Legere as CEO fits the role the new company will assume. T-Mobile will likely transform over the next few years following the merger to become a more diversified market player. That means it will grow and diversify more into enterprise, government, first responder, rural, IoT (including automotive/transport and industrial), as well as innovations in the consumer markets. The largest proportion of gains made over the past several years has been in the huge consumer market. That benefitted greatly from the in-your-face flashy performance of John Legere. While T-Mobile will do well to maintain the 'Un-Carrier' market image, it will become important to shift that market image to that of a more collaborative innovator... not so much ""in your face"" as a behind the scenes ""get things done"" image. Mike Sievert is well suited to carrying the NewTM image foraward IMO."

"The FCC has put a stop on the shot clock in order for new information about New T-Mobile's plans to merge networks is reviewed and time is given for public responses.

However, the actual decision could come latter."

"Be prepared for a ripple effect of economic impact of the coronavirus. This will very likely have an impact on broad sections of the economy including sectors that do not directly appear to be tied to it including real estate, autos, transport, local businesses and government spending IMO. Many investors have never experienced a true recession ... this crisis has the possibility of become one because it is much broader and harder for government to attack than sector-isolated downturns seen over the past 20 years or so. I am not saying yet that this will rapidly escalate to be as bad as I picture. What I am saying is that it has the potential to do so that I had not seen with the Internet Bubble, and mortgage meltdown inspired collapses because those were more easily isolated and countered. This can get real bad, surprisingly quick.. I hope that my thinking proves irrational. However, by the time the results would become apparent, many investors will have already been wiped out. Do not allow yourself to become the toe jam left after the Elephants under the circus tent have already stampeded to open spaces. Money in hand is worth a flock of birds in the bush. Gold!

"A lot of credence is given by the media and many investment industry talking heads that Sprint is a low-cost leader that is essential to competition in the mobile space and to lose it will be a disaster to consumer interests. This is hogwash because 1) Sprint sells a product that has been losing core customers due to not keeping up with competitors improvements in network quality and coverage or breath of services. The low-cost leader argument must be considered in line with the complete picture of Sprint's position: Sprint was salvaged from heading towards bankruptcy by Softbank who has propped up the ability to offer low prices by infusion of credit through device lease financing, core asset financing, and other means that should be viewed as unsustainable measures. What makes the argument that merger with T-Mobile removes a competitor from the space is predicated on the understanding that Sprint will be able to stay competitive if the merger is not allowed. Contradicting the belief is the consensus opinions of the vast majority of independent financial analysts and that of many industry analysts. Their view shows Sprint will continue to lose money over at least the next three years. One-shot tax benefits do nothing to change that. The growing view is that spending on 5G will accelerate in coming years. That is likely to cause a negative impact on Sprint. The merger proposes to spend about $40 billion over the three years following the merger. T-Mobile has indicated it will engage in an acceleration in spending regardless of the merger, although reduced from that level. That will likely show up in financial analysts future projections to show higher projected losses for Sprint. Something has to give: Sprint won't be an effective stimulus for competitive pricing in the industry if a) customers do not view Sprint as offering competitive services regardless of the price. b) Sprint's touted customers continue to shift from core subscribers to wholesale category subs. Wholesale subscribers have not forced Verizon or ATT to reduce their pricing or pursue a similar strategy. In fact, despite the recent entry of Comcast and Charter as MVNOs the role of MVNO services has been reduced at both VZ and T in recent years, showing that in the face of the supposedly fierce price competition offered by Sprint, the duopolists have been comfortable with policies that restricted the growth of their MVNOs and favored their further business consolidaiton. There is so much hearsay bunk out there."
I love how this discussion group is where people come to complain about there service and not talk to the company it self. Mass majority of customers love Tmo and it will thrive well beyond the competition if they focus on 5g and customers first. stock price doesn't lie and it's smoking Vs and Att and who cares about dividend when stock growth is through the roof.
Am amazed can get TMUS at these prices post Sprint merger esp. in light of massive 5G revenues on the way. Great bargain.
Looks like all these VoIP patents that Sprint owns and the patents Lawsuits Sprint is hitting cable companies with and winning in court not only turns into Free Cash but also produced not only future Patent Lease but Spectrum use agreements..Makes me wonder if it wasn't the reason why sprint set out of the last two auctions. What better way to enter into Virgin areas or build a better network then through the back door so to speak with little or No Cost to Sprint and very few Road Blocks being part of the Court Settlement ..This is far cheaper then buying at auction and throwing Billions more out the door for build outs or network improvements..Oh did I forget to mention maybe the millions of customers and other services that come from these cable companies .Son is a much smarter man then what hangs these boards and Sprint owns the Patents many cable companies use and if the press is right the count is some place in the area of 5 court wins for Sprint already and I'm thinking that number will only grow..Just may be the reason Son is buying up as many shares as he can.
Legere really hinting at running for office on Twitter..I would absolutely vote for him before typical bought and paid for politicians! He would likely be a leftish un-politician?...Musk would be a more rightish un-politician who I would also vote for if he ever decided to run. I say go for it.
"“T-Mobile and Sprint are valued at $66 billion and $27 billion, respectively. Verizon and AT&T are currently valued at $240 billion and $258 billion, respectively”: The Duopolists hold most of the industry sales and profits. The state AGs and the DoJ are failing their responsibilities to create an even competitive playing field, choosing instead to place all of the burden of market competition on the two smaller nationwide MNOs who are at a competitive disadvantage. That is the opposite of free enterprise Darwinian economics in which only the most aggressive and capable survive. The state-socialist establishment has picked sides arbitrary to antitrust laws and protection of consumers... then they lie by commission, claiming that only weakling Sprint can provide the needed competition. What that is really doing is keeping the status quo in place that enriches the few at the sake of the public. The BIG Lie flies in the face of economic theory that holds that when companies achieve 1/3 or more marketshare they can achieve the power of monopoly. When two companies achieve that level and fail to compete effectively, they become Duopolists. While they may not collude directly on pricing, their actions show that they are colluding... they compete to increase payouts of dividends rather than on the basis of offering good value to consumers. This is a state-sanctioned monopoly that enriches the rich while charging among the highest prices in the world for mobile and broadband services. The facts show that US consumers pay inordinantly high prices while the profits are taken off the top .. a utility industry that treats the business as a textbook Cash Cow. The DoJ and AGs should be ashamed of themselves for perpetuating the BIG LIe that holds that The Market is on considered to be the consumer market. T-Mobile plus Sprint = $66B + $27B = $93BVerizon + ATT = $240B + $258B = $498BSprintsy wintsy plus T-Mobily = 18.7% the size of the Duopolists. Yet the DoJ ignores the wireless trusts and goes after the minority market participants. The mostly Democrat AGs scratch the back that feeds them... holding the small companies responsible for industry structure. The facts show that with the merger T-Mobile+Sprint will remain the underdogs while BORG market juggernauts ATT and Verizon will remain much larger, more diversified, financially stronger, and more entrenched competitors.The BIG Liars ClubThe USA cannot compete internationally so long as it is ruled by the BIG Liars Club. American consumers will continue to pay more than 90% of people in the world, often for inferior capabilities, rural coverage and quality. The BIG Liars want Americans to be satisfied with the current situation. By keeping competitors at 10% and 8% the size of their client companies Verizon and ATT, there is little real competition that will surface.Use common sense to figure this out: size matters. The entire market matters. If the Market is defined as only the consumer market and that is used to Lie about the nature of this industry to keep competitors small, consumers must bare the entire costs for the build of nationwide networks required to compete with VZ and T. That cannot work to the advantage of consumers. 0.10 plus 0.08 does not equal to 0.82 as the sector-socialist establishment forces are trying to sell you."

"T-Mobile is refusing to honor it's iPhone 7 promotion and is now trying to change the deal so that they can reach into my checking account to withdraw money. I have always paid my bills on time. When the promotion began, T-Mobile did all they could do to not honor their promotion, then abruptly changed the details the next day. They will either honor their promotion with the original terms, or they will lose the sale. As it is, there will probably be a class action lawsuit, anyway. A company or a person is only as good as their word. As investors, you should be aware of the dishonorable behavior of your company. If somebody cannot honor their word, how can I trust them with access to my checking account?"
TMUS make the backhaul for MVNO deal with Centurylink. Together you make everything VZ has and more. That network will get you edge and backhaul fiber to all the big content providers. It gets FTTT and dont have to build fiber on your own. Let them build fiber and you build wireless. I dont know why cash is big driver. As CTL grows wireless your expenses go down. It could be worth 10x the Dish deal.

"I am one who was with Sprint and am now auto transfered to TMobile. They have some big shoes to fill and when I am looking for a new phone descisions will be made.

If they are not careful they will easily lose everyone that has been with Sprint."

Anytime you have a merger jobs will be lost. Sprint will see the most of the cuts so Tmobile people will be safe. Over the short run of 2yrs Tmobiles stock will drop maybe as low as $45 so this will be a good stock to short for the big guys.

"It will be interesting to see if T-Mobile gains share from Sprint over the next few quarters. Sprint faces a challenge in keeping up with the top three mobile operators as they push into TV/media services. That requires 'broadband everywhere'. Sprint has 'lumpy gravy' broadband that has high data rates in metro areas where the company can afford to build out densely but less competitive service elsewhere. The nature of Sprint's network leaves it at a competitive disadvantage that it now hopes to fill with joint network agreements with the cable companies. However, that will take time and is limited to the approximate 7% of the US population that the current agreements with COX and Altair cover. In the meantime, T-Mobile has the most attractive proposition for gaining marketshare, including grabbing share from Sprint IMO."

Very strange TMUS be going up as people stay at home communicating with wireless
"USA Or Tmus.....market it isn’t good very bad ...3,4 days up...can’t hold.....= one,tows day is going down..."
Looks like we will be hearing at any time that this Merger will be rejected. Then everyone can get back to dealing with their own business.
"T-Mobile is heading into a new era for wireless that will cement it as the interconnectivity enabler of the century. The whole world is impacted by this as a fundamental shift in mankind's evolution. Each of us is now more connected to each other and repositories of thought that, as Legere and other s put it: ""We won't stop"". Why stop when you are having the time of your life?I do not see compelling reasons for T-Mobile to get joined together unless it is to untappped reservoirs of cost leverage and better network performance that far more than pays for itself? The opportunity costs are too high to settle for a straight jacket."
"How valuable are wireless spectra (airwaves)? It depends a lot on the frequency, how wide the channels are, how free of interference and other users, and how contiguous the site plots are. Some spectrum bands are licensed as small as 1 city block. That was done because the original license was designed to be used by churches, schools or municipalities. The FCC has often licensed wide coverage areas and smaller plots in hopes of creating more diverse competition for wireless services. Even though the FCC's mmWave auctions that are winding up are for much wider bandwidth channels and have wide coverage areas, they are bringing in about 1/40th as much as the AWS-3 and low-band auctions. That is because the mmWave spectra require base station/smallcell density of as small as 500 feet. The recent SEC filing mentions that Verizon, using 28 GHz mmWave must deploy at a density of about 700 feet. The company has said they can achieve coverage of up to 1,900 feet, however, that if a best-case scenario in which the location is in line-of-sight of the base station. New T-Mobile can achieve about 8 times the range using 600 MHz. The bandwidth is lower but as a density of subscribers increases, they can jump up to use AWS, Sprint's 2.5 GHz, or 3.5 GHz."

"**** EVENT : SPRINT Funeral, today 8/01/20 : “On August 2, we’re combining our Sprint and T-Mobile brands to operate as one T-Mobile brand nationwide,”"
Wow. The deal is finally done. Almost no noise about it... well I'm still holding. Is this a victory? Can't tell yet.
"T-Mobile's results show a strong continuation of multi-year growth and business trends. That continued growth in core subscribers is particularly important at the juncture before merging with Sprint which promises to open up the benefits of increased subscriber density to propel the use of the complimentary mix of low and mid band spectra that will be immediately exploitable. The combination of network assets deployed with the 5G technologies will provide a significant competitive advantage over Verizon and AT&T. If we look at the post-merger business dynamics, New T-Mobile will have about 1/3 of the retail portion of the mobile market. The new company formation will have lower shares of the extended markets which offers a higher marginal growth opportunity. T-Mobile's retail market will have new room to grow to fill up its more capital efficient networks. It does not take 200 page economic experts reports to understand that having excess capacity on a more efficient, customer pleasing network should result in the ability to offer lower prices while opening up more elbow room for third party participation that helps to further fuel growth.The 'age of wireless' is giving way to the Age of ICT - the seamless interworking of wired and wired networks with cloud computing, AI, Internet of Things, automotive. The counting of the business as subscribers remains relative, but it misses the broader picture. At some point in the future the industry will talk much less about mobile subscribers than about the business as being a sum of parts... the mobile part may be the body of industry while AI adapted Bid Data and cloud computing the 'head' and vertical markets the arms and legs. New T-Mobile will be in an advantageous position to grow into the ICT world of communications.What to llok forward to after the merger:T-Mobile laid out a three-pronged plan to offer services to first responders, students, and a entry-level lower price tier. That combination should cause an increase in subscriber gains. I'm just guessing, being too lazy to work on it from the ground up, but guess that this may lead to 2.5-3 million subscribers gained per quarter, maybe a bit more. Is that reasonable? T-Mobile grew at that rate for a while as the benefits of increased network coverage, capacity, 'all in there' packages and competitive pricing helped attrack customers from competitors. Analysts have thought the early rapid gains would subside. To a degree they have - growth has tapered off to the current trend line of 1.3-2M per quarter. That slowing of momentum was due to competitors responding with some reduction in prices and rolling in of OTT media services. New T-Mobile's trendline should improve because of offering the lower price points and attractive marketing programs.Lower prices impact sales and marginsThe flip side to grabbing market share away from competitors by offering 'more for less' is that to the degree it is not immediately offset by savings and network efficiencies it will reduce margins. If the growth is not high enough to offset the negative impact, it results in lower sales and profits. Its important to consider that nTMUS might see short-term negative impacts along the way. No pain, no gains: that is not a full analogy because some of the gains come from the capacity to eliminate pain so that the market growth leads to no pain on the part of nT-Mobile as well. However, this is a 'mega merger' that may have some period of adjustment that leads to sales and earnings instabilities. What if T-Mobile zooms higher once the merger moves forward and then experiences a quarter or two of negative impacts along the way? So long as there are no upsets to the expected savings and network convergence, it may be a buying opportunity. The results will be what investors in TMUS should continue to look at, not just the quarterly ripples but the longer-term trends. T-Mobile is about to embark on a new chapter of growth and innovation. I think it will be a good short to long-term investment."
"Profits will tumble as phone carriers desperately trying to retain customers. SPRINT advertises UNLIMITED Talk, Text Data $20/Line....watch all their fine print......but the completion is just heating up AND T-Mobile is out of advertising gimmicks."
"The chances for a merger to take place between T-Mobile and Sprint look good. I had said that last year after suggesting that T-Mobile/Deutsche should not pay a high price for Sprint. The deal that appeared to be working out was for a stock swap acquisition rather than cash. Of course, that would have had a huge capital impact because of assumption of Sprint's $37 billion of debt (possibly reduced in exchange for Softbank being allowed to participate/control). The debt would have been offset by synergies including reduction of store locations and many duplicative operations and, of course, overlapping network infrastructure and lease payments for base stations and rights of way, etc. The deal fell through at a point that major financial news journals had written that it appeared likely to move forward. The reported stopping block was that Softbank's BOD wanted control of parts of Sprint that the company has invested billions in return for asset pledges and running the cash flows through its other companies, thus generating a return for those investments. T-Mobile/Deutsche would not budge and it was called off.While it has been only six months some things have changed: T-Mobile continues to gain ground and bolster its finances while Sprint has found some success in doing deals with smaller cable companies and in rolling out elements of 5G networks. The use of LTE Home eNodeB 'Sprint Magic Box' has proven a success with over 100,000 units in the field and demand exceeding supply. The offers a glimmer of hope beyond what may have been figured for rendering Sprint's assets into a tangible value instead of a waste of time and money. T-Mobile can pursue the use of 3.5-3.7 GHz and higher '5G bands' to their advantage but the earlier use could be made of Sprint's 2.5-2.6 GHz spectrum which has some technical and cost of deployment advantages.Meanwhile, Verizon and AT&T's plans to act like BORG predators to go after wireless broadband cable replacement and other markets exposed by 5G works as a stimulus for both S and TMUS to try again at merging the companies. If the talks are substantiated (the media is proven wrong at times), I think they will push through to an agreement because the parties largely know what it likely will take for the other side to do the deal. and wouldn't bother otherwise. The next question is whether regulators will approve it. My guess is that they will. This has less to do with who is in the White House than the competitive structure of the industry. Since the last attempt, the cablecos wireless efforts have shown enough substance to consider it becoming an alternative to the MNOs. And the deals Sprint has made with COX and Altair ushers in the profer that it is better that TMo+Sprint merge because that will help cablecos become a stronger 4th leg to the competitive stool as the group will have their sites set on going after Verizon and AT&T rather than be contained to the petty fighting among themselves while delivering fewer benefits to consumers."
WILL LEGERE BE LEAVING TMOBILEYou know Legere must be hatting this potential Merger with Sprint. Now he has to be in charge of cleaning up a big mess and have will have a target pinned to him if he does not get it done. He knows he will be know as the big loser CEO when the company fails. In the mean while Claure will be sitting back watching soccer games and collecting a big fat check every week while Legere is working his assoff. I bet Legere will quit and then there will be just two Carriers in no time at all.
"Sprint and T-Mobile say this deal is necessary for America to have a nationwide 5G network. But their own words prove them wrong.Myth: Neither company can launch a 5G network on its own.Fact: Before they announced a merger, both companies aggressively touted their ability and plans to launch a 5G network. T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in 2017 that his company would “leapfrog” Verizon and AT&T and be first to “real, mobile, nationwide 5G” by 2020. And Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in February 2018 that the carrier would launch a nationwide 5G network in 2019.Myth: The United States needs this deal to secure a 5G network and maintain its leadership in 5G.Fact: AT&T and Verizon are both building out and launching their own 5G networks. Verizon has already launched 5G in several markets and AT&T plans to offer mobile 5G in 12 cities by the end of 2018.Myth: This deal would let the two companies invest more in their 5G.Fact: According to their statements to Wall Street, the two companies were already planning to spend on 5G roughly the same amount that they told the FCC they would spend if they were allowed to combine. 2019 All rights reserved. 4Competition CoalitionContact Privacy Policy"

Hope you enjoyed that Robinhood $2 drop.....Boing! right back up....like a beach ball underwater lol
"The trends remain on track: T-Mobile continues to grow and increase profits even while they are increasing their capital spend rate. Combined with the spectrum position, that is a very favorable trend considering the growth remains ahead of all major competitors. The growth has slowed from the rate of a couple years ago and it will probably continue to be at a reduced rate. However, TMUS again beat the expectations, turning in a healthy quarter and raising the yearly outlook. That makes dips like this either tradeable events or points at which to accumulate the stock.The merger is, as articles have pointed out recently and in the past, not a necessity for T-Mobile to continue on its current trajectory. I think that there is a good chance that regulators will approve the merger. However, as I've said in the past, I think that this will take accommodating structural change within the converged industry, something that I don't know whether the agreement has included in a way that will please the DOJ and FCC. John Legere and others have not given out information to conclude they have taken a pro-active stance on the issue. If not, the deal may get rejected."
"we have a date, the Justice department will sue to block merger if T Mobile and Sprint dont get their s$%^t together by next week"
Below 100 day MA for 6 days straight now. Thoughts on 200 day MA test?
Wowww
"It is that More People are Getting involved in Stopping this Nasty Merger.Great to see TMobileWorkers making their voices heard to demand @FCC put workers and consumers ahead of corporations. The T-Mobile/Sprint merger would mean lost jobs, higher costs, and worse rural broadband."
"The U.S. Government by their own actions in selecting T to protect it's data , Is telling All Americans do NOT do any business with T Mobile or VZ because they are both now controlled by the EU's one world order and can not be trusted any more. Only sell any moves higher in both VZ and T Mobile because they can NOT be TRUSTED with their EU one world order hidden agenda . The U. S. Gorvernments own actions speak volumes"
T-mobile good job 
Dont get why is down...we had great ER
Who do they think their fooling lmao gobble gobble !
"This guy R coming out of nowhere. Rest assured, he will be long gone by Friday."
What if John Legere went to DISH. That would be crazy.
"T-Mobile AGAIN have false takeover rumors whenever their stock is ready to sell off...check back...it's done several times...if it wasn't for the stock market passing 20,000.....their stock would be selling off faster......."
"T-Mobile continues to figure it out.Deutsche Bank has raised its price target on T-Mobile (TMUS -0.3%), after updating its model ahead of Q1 earnings. The new price target ($185, up from $155, implying 40% upside) incorporates some upward revisions to guidance from management at last month's analyst day, along with longer-term buyback guidance of up to $60B in 2023-2025. • It also implies a 5.3% unlevered free cash flow yield for 2022, ""which we believe is very reasonable for a company growing UFCF at a 14% (compound annual growth rate) over the subsequent three years."""
Who sells a winner
"Dear Mr. Legere,Thank you for enabling the end of the Duopoly's rule by achieving Fed approval for the merge, and for soon finishing off the opposing AGs (namely Xavier Bacerra and Letitia James), who inconceivably created an abundance of needless waste to protect a Giant that's forever milked the consumer ... until YOU!

"It is about time. I got T-Mobil cell service aver a year ago. So much better than AT&T in all ways. Was so impressed, I bought the stock. Great motivated employees at their stores."
Ok clue me in.I just read two articles one being they could close this merger around April 1st other that is still needs California utilities approval that could be into July or later any ideas here about that?
So what was that dip attributed to?
I think what you will Find on Warrens next report is Warren has sold all his TMUS stock just my opinion
"I m wondering, the market cap of the mother DTE is just a few bn above TMUS market cap they own"
Where's their dividends ??? None ???
Does anyone know the Expected rate of return and Minimum required investment for T-Mobile?
600 shares in at $61.55. Believe the CEO has a big positive earnings surprise to move the stock higher.

"Sprint's quarterly results came in on the low side of financial analysts expectations for subscriber gains (42,000), losses (-7 cents), and about on target for sales. Sprint finally announced a shift toward user-deployable equipment for the 'first-mile' coverage inside and around buildings. The CEO of the parent company, Softbank, announced a self-configurable window, roof or outside wall mounted 'Sprint Magic Box' that is what I had originally encouraged the WiMAX Forum to develop standards for and for Sprint to develop and deploy when initially rolling out their '4G' network. If that had started about nine years ago, Sprint might have grown from inner cores of cities and dense metro corridors out to the suburbs and may some lower population density areas by about three years ago. The prospects for making use of high-band spectrum for mobile use has always been technically and financially challenging. However, that was Sprint's best shot at capturing enough marketshare to have vaulted itself from a weak number 3 position into at least a solid number 3 or even number 2 position in consumer markets. That slot has now been taken by T-Mobile which stepped into a vacuum between the high-priced, sometimes wasteful and short-sighted leaders Verizon and AT&T and the staid, old-school development and execution by Sprint. The problem has been that Sprint became too late to make the plan I had once urged the company to pursue viable for capturing a large segment of the evolving marketshare. What Sprint's revised smallcell strategy may not bee too late for is to head down a path to deliver gigabit bandwidth to homes and businesses that make Sprint look more viable as an acquisition candidate despite its daunting debt level. If it can get on a trajectory towards profits while also spending more to deploy more densly to support the user-deployable 'Magic Box' ""LTE Home eNobeB"" type smallcell device, then DISH or a cable company (the best target) might make sense of an acquisition of Sprint in a year or two.However, the competitive environment is far from static. T-mobile has more mid-band spectrum coming online with the 600 MHz coming available to be deployed starting as early as the 2nd half of this year. With 3.5 GHz and 28 and higher bands for backhaul also being available, the competitive network landscape will change. It is not so much a matter of whether Sprint could contribute to marketshare scale as it is that the networks and spectrum it can contribute will be largely redundant unless a path for 'world-conquering' domination of the new competition for wireless home broadband makes sense. It is difficult to see now how that makes sense from a risk/reward perspective down the road. Sorry, no deal likely between Sprint and T-Mobile and probably not with anyone else until such time as Sprint's late-game Magic Box strategy is able to show solid competitive results."
"I have T-Mobile, I like T-Mobile. However, as with any merger with a company of lowered stature, there is going to be some pain going forward. I see it continuing ￼in about a year and a half or two. The integration with Sprint will be more solidified and the debt at that time will stabilize.￼￼The market is always forward-looking, but not that forward-looking. It is going to be interesting to see the debt hit the books next quarter.￼￼"
This company will die without the merger. It cant compete with VZ and T on 5G - it lacks the technology and the scale.

"TMUS SRMX deal.Dear Shareholders, October 3, 2019 I am pleased to advise that we are rapidly moving forward through our co-development relationship with T-Mobile USA! Today, we are kicking off our CAT-1 IoT Communications Gateway project with T-Mobile! This is an exciting project, which will generate significant revenue for us in 2020. The CAT-1 data can be downloaded and uploaded simultaneously by full duplex 10 Mbps speed. The CAT-1 Applications include, but are not limited to, the following wide range of uses: • Digital signage • ATMs • Kiosks • Video surveillance • Vehicle telematics • Cellular gateway • Personal/asset trackers • Sensor nodes • Utility meters • Monitoring systems More detailed specifications on the SBC-700 CAT-1 IoT Communication Gateway follows. Industrial IoT Communication Gateway 4G/LTE-CAT1 (T-Mobile)-802.11n Wi-Fi The SBC-700 unit is a compact, low power, cost effective and high-performance programmable Gateway. It is designed to be the interface between devices and internet cloud (D2C), for Sensors to Server. Also, because it is on Linux supported, it’s easy for customers to develop their own applications on the SBC-700 platform to offer their own connected products that are reliable and time-to-market. The feature sets of the SBC-700 are equipped with a T-Mobile certified Quectel EC21-A unit which combines a 32-bit low power, high performance CPU, Low Power DDR-RAM, 10/100M Base-T Ethernet, 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n WiFi, USB 2.0 ports, MicroSD socket for storage extension and 2x or 4x ports auto-flow control RS485 with isolation. There is a miniPCIe socket inside SBC700 for users to adapt the 4G/LTE wireless communication capability, and the USB port can support TW-UIO modules used to collect signals and control the system, like AI/AO/DI/DO with/without isolation features. For the IoT and M2M market, SBC-700 is the best choice for a IoT network communication gateway to connect devices and gain Cloud service advantages. ____________________________ I will continue to keep Shareholders closely informed of our T-Mobile USA co-development projects as we jointly roll out our NB IoT products into the marketplace. Respectfully, Max C. Li. CEO"
"Legere interview on CNBC, have to wear your really high boots to get through all that garbage. He had the nerve to say that the merger would super charge 5G. What a laugh! These guys are not inventors, they are just selling the service."
"Why has T-Mobile (TMUS) gone sideways over the past ~year? 1) Because T-Mobile had outperformed expectations over the past 3+ years, long enough for beating expectations to have become largely factored into the stock price.2) TMUS more than doubled in size. The rate of growth becomes difficult as you grow. However, VZ and T are finding it much more difficult and costly to grow.3) During the first half of 2017, the stock was driven to highs based partly on speculation it would merge with Sprint. Investors and Wall Street loves M&A speculation. I think that pushed TMUS up about 25% over what would otherwise have been the result of performance. 4) TMUS was due to see lower and slower stock appreciation because growth has been tapering off from the earlier pace. This has been expected due to mainstream market maturity and the slowing pace of growth.5) The CEO is not the person who is the sole 'change maker'. T-Mobile has seized on the ability to acquire spectrum and execute on the acquisition of MetroPCS. John Legere was 'the right man for the job' because what T-Mobile needed to do was to stand out from all the glib MBA/accounting and macho marketing types who typically sit in the CEO spot. JL is outrageous at times. However, he has a brain on his shoulders and knows when not to get in the way of others and to share the limelight with 'them that brought us here'. If you expected a higher price and lost money because reality doesn't suit you, you are the only one who has to live with the results of your thinking and decisions. If you don't like the CEO or anything else, wtpuck are you investing in it in the 1st place? It looks like you do not have control of your own brain well enough to make decisions that make money. There is a cure for that a) Don't invest in stocks. b) study and practice stocks, technical analysis, financial analysis, competitive analysis, etc. until you can make the right decisions. "" I lose money and then blame someone else for it because my panties get tied up in a knot and it makes me squeal """
"T-Mobile (TMUS) has reached a new all-time high and the charts look bullish. Sprint (S) has moved up but remains at a discount to the exchange ratio, adding incentive to buy it as a surrogate for TMUS at this point. The risk left to the meger is the State AGs lawsuit. However, the odds of that winning are extremely low IMO. At worst, it will delay the merger by sevferal months. The number of AGs supporting the case is likely to drop. It is possible, although highly optimistic, for the case to be withdrawn as soon as next week."
"I've been streaming for years to escape massive cable bills for seldom-watched shows. In every respect, streaming is preferable. Sadly, about a month ago my home internet began to have trouble. I called AT&T and they sent out a repair guy. He said it was intermittent from old phone lines and he wasn't allowed to fix it. Service then quit completely. Next AT&T repair guy arrived mad because he was in the scheduled window and didn't want to be. He said the broken service worked fine. Third guy, sort of an OG one might say with more experience, said the lines were old, corrupted, and would require tearing apart my hedge and the street to fix. They are original from when the area was built. I live in a large Southern California city, not a remote or rural site. So AT&T is out. They can't deliver the service. Called Spectrum-Charter. Scheduled for last Saturday at 5. Guy just flat didn't show up. Rescheduled without asking me to when I am not available.Money can't buy internet service in my nice neighborhood of a large Southern California city. So I went to T-Mobile One. Currently, it's my home wifi for the kids' TV as well as my phone, tablet etc. I want to escape the dictates of the horrible wired providers very, very much. T-Mobile 4G is a temporary solution until the cable company decides to show up and take my money, but with 5G somebody is going to put these clowns out of business, and I do mean AT&T in that group with their abysmal service. I've also had Verizon wired for TV and internet. Verizon was high-performance but outrageous about billing, even charging a high price to replace their own battery. Somebody in the wireless world, independent of wired-up companies, has to get it. Guess who? T-Mobile. Their CEO is dying to compete with the deeply hated wired cable and phone companies with their cultures of flagrant customer abuse. In."
John Lerere time to step down ...!
"An article highlights Moody's view on T-Mobile's debt situation, warning that it has taken on Sprint's junk bond rated debt and will likely increase debt. How seriously should investors take this? How debt impacts a company is always dependent on whether it is able to generate a return that at least pays for the cost and loss of financial flexibility. When companies invest in foundational aspects of their business that either help reduce costs or/and create greater income, so long as the projected growth happens, the debt is considered a positive input to the business model. The article points out that high debt can turn negative if the economy declines. That threat has been something that investors have needed to consider for several years. We need to ask ""How would a major downturn in the economy impact my companies (stocks)?""The answer is partly determined by the market position of the company. The article mentions credit worthiness. Sprint and T-Mobile have extended credit to less credit worthy customers through MVNOs and easy credit policies. Does that make New T-Mobile more vulnerable to a downturn and resulting consumer credit squeeze? Not necessarily. There are two factors that mitigate: 1) Consumers need cellphone service. It has become essential to personal and job pursuits. 2) When the economy is squeezed, consumers tend to economize rather than abandon mobile service altogether. They have shown this in past economic downturns including the 'mortgage meltdown' under the Bush Jr. administration that continued well after Obama took office. During economic downturns, consumers tend to downscale their spending on mobile rather than give it up. This is what I call the “McDonald’s Hamburger” economic effect: During recessions, customers who frequented higher-priced food establishments tend to down-scale to the lower cost alternatives. Certainly some eat at home, pack lunches more often for their kids, etc. but the net impact is that enough customers more down the ladder of consumption to eat at the lower cost places that they are not impacted to the same degree. Which companies/tier of service is impacted? The higher priced, less efficient. Given that the merger will reduce costs and the push into 5G is as much about cost reduction as it is about expanding and improvement in services, New T-Mobile will be in a position of offering the ‘more for less’ propositions that have proven successful in the past. That places nT-Mobile into the tier of service I describe euphemistically as the ‘McDonald’s Hamburgers’ spot. During a recession customers may scale back their use and premium services but there will also be customers using higher priced packaged from Verizon and AT&T that will migrate down the supplier list. The result has the potential to become a positive as it breaks down old purchasing habits. Many customers of T and VZ say, according to surveys, that they stick with them because they are reliable, their company or friends and family use them… in other words, they are not motivated well enough by the ‘more for less’ offerings to make the switch. A downturn in the economy that is deep enough to impact the market psychology can trigger the motivation to switch.We need to keep the debt situation of companies in mind. However, the past helps to inform the likely impact of recessions that goes beyond Moody’s analysis IMO. The main we need to look at is how well growth results from taking on Sprint’s debt and increased capital expense and the degree cost savings offset. This will not happen quickly - it is unlikely to change much quarter-to-quarter but observable trends may appear over the next 12-24 months. The simple thing to look at is whether growth meets expectations."
"Looks like this deal , S. and. TMUS Is not very good. S shares going for less than $6.50. S shares are worth at least $18/share. think::::S. mkt cap is $26 billion:::$50 billion worth of spectrum-----this computes to at least $18/share. We are being ripped off."
"TMUS has the old analog TV band so the metro 5G seems to be the winner. I'm not sure how they will increase bandwidth, maybe by having different ""channels"" that automatically flow over to the next channel. Or have separate channels for Government, Fire, Police, Netflix, Facebook, Disney, etc.???"
it doesn't have enough money to build 5G networks from it's profit.

"Rakuten, Japan's new cloud-centric openRan mobile operator, has come out of self-imposed seclusion to talk about the launch of their network:""“If you look at our architecture, our architecture today is truly the world’s first open RAN deployment today across any telco. It is running at scale. It is absolutely real; it is not pie in the sky.” He said the network shows the ability to lower capex by 40% and opex by 30%.""The statement is exactly what I have posted in past months: the cost savings of deploying and operating an all 5G openRAN network are about 40% compared to deployment and operation of current MNO's legacy hardware-based networks that must support legacy generations back-office and network operating systems management and physical plant. The cost difference can be a critical factor in order to achieve a financially reasonable prospect for reaching an early break-even point and then profits. What helps make that possible is the greater build flexibility the openRAN, cloud-centric network provides. The build can occur more granularly as demand grows in each area for each type of service. That is not without problems, however, the system is more flexible and cost effective in addressing them. If the end-to-end cloud service system is put in place, it can also produce low latency, low cost, and high number of supported connections needed of the more demanding 5G applications. In other words, there are both the existing and new markets to go after with lower cost, better responsiveness, higher capacity. The biggest opportunity may be to undercut competitors on price while the longer-term goal is to take market share with more a more capable set of services including the AI, cloud services, interactive gaming, medical, VR etc.It is good to see that Rakuten has come out to talk about their network. The company had been expected to launch initially late last year which got pushed back to early this year. They went quiet except for statements that it was taking longer. Now they appear ready to launch and expand rapidly.Rakuten is among the leaders. Also important are the cloud-centric deployments in India which is where the CTO heralds. India is likely to become the largest deployer of cloud-centric 5G. One of China’s MNO’s appears to be deploying a cloud-centric network but that is complicated by lack of visibility and lack of fiber optic and other support infrastructure… with much of it owned by the three incumbent MNOs. I have not gotten my head around what is happening in China with c-c/openRAN or how that impacts world markets. Cloud-centric can be viewed as something of an arch-enemy of the hardware-based network suppliers including Huawei but also Ericsson, Nokia, etc. If cloud-centric gains substantial share they will have less equipment to sell while the open network suppliers including CISCO and software stack and specialty suppliers will gain share. Because of that, there will be a lot of misinformation expected in coming years."

"""Location-based data"" What is it, who has it, and why is it important?The name tells that location-based data' is data about the user based on their location. That seems very simple but inside of that term lies the ability to determine where a person is relative to sellers of goods and services and to refine the understanding of the user beyond what is determined from what apps they use, what websites they visit and what content they view. Similar to the way tracking of users activity on the web now can keep track of not only where the user browses but also how long they linger, what the patterns are for browsing, what they buy and what they respond/post, send, and where they are located, the mobile network can tell where the user is when away from a WiFi location.Moreover, even though users can hide their locations when browsing by using an anonymous browser (to some degree) or a VPN, the mobile network operator knows where the user device is located at all times.What is all the hubbub about mobile operators selling their location-based data to the third party resellers? It is because that creates a loss of the line of control over the data. This is the same type of problem that FaceBook unwittingly created when it sold user data to research firms. Even though the agreements said that the data could not be used outside of the research group, Cambridge Analytics, they sold it and the research on US and other nations users, including political hot button issue preferences, seemingly to anyone who would pay them, including to US political candidates and Russian operatives.The consumer agrees to use sites and mobile services with few protections other than the sometimes compromised and weak enforcement of the US regulators and Congress (IMO) and the goodwill of the BORG Empire, er. mobile operators. The agreement with users is a take it or leave it proposition. The 'opt-in' rules are often meaningless because the user is bombarded with step-wise requests to grant websites, applications, and operators permission to keep track of them and use functions on their mobile phones, devices, PC's and smart TV/entertainment systems and home control systems. The comic sketches about Bezos listening into your household conversations via Alexa are not total fantasy: outside firms have found ways to do just that and can provide computer generated transcripts.The benefits of always being connected are huge. We have come to accept the risk of misuse or unwanted use of information.The location-based hubbub may well result in mobile operators benefitting: By forcing them to forgo a minor source of revenue, mobile operators will tighten their control over the data and that provides them with differentiation in the Big Data and AI marketplace."
"T=Mobile has been gaining ground in their requests for changes in 3.5GHz and in future 3.6-4.2 GHz spectrum. I am a libertarian in my views on spectrum regulation. I don't think mobile operators are saints and should not be granted all they want. In fact, I think they are self-interested pigs... and, like the rest of us, should be competing on an open playing field in which they must bleed to succeed. However, TMo is gaining ground and some of what they are asking for makes good sense. Investors need to be agnostic when it comes to their investments... they might want more ground for enterprise networks to build shared access networks but as far as TMUS stock is concerned, they should be aware that changes favorable to T-Mobile look likely to happen.T-Mobile has a few-year glide path to build out low and mid-band spectrum in a way that satisfies mobile broadband and emerging market needs. Beyond that, T-Mo will need more mid-band spectrum. That can come from 3.5-4.2 GHz with the microwave bands serving as a gigabit overlay to the local base station grid in combination with fiber-optic. Or TMo may do a deal with DISH to acquire more of the choice sub 3 GHz mid-band. Or T-Mobile can do 'all of the above'. The strategic objective is to develop alternatives before the needs arise."

"WiFi's 802.11ax will introduce several capabilities prior to mobile 5G. Many of the user device and small network node capabilities that are coming to 5G mobile will show up first in '5G WiFi'. These include MU-MIMO, multi-user MIMO, wider band channel aggregation, higher order MIMO and more simultaneous signal path processing, higher modulation rates at up to 1024 QAM, more power-saving features that enable WiFi to be used in IoT and other low-power applications. improved beam-forming, faster signal processing and coding methods that reduce latency down to a few milliseconds. The result will be gigabit wireless throughput and ability to serve more simultaneous high-demand user applications including virtual reality and video communicaitons networking. One of the ways .11ac-ax is will impact the environment is to increase the participation of business enterprises and public venues in deploying and managing networks. It can also be expected to be used by cable companies and, maybe by DISH as a way to extend their customer's networks to serve broader areas outside of their homes and businesses."
Is DISH..APPLE..COMCAST..etc..etc..etc interested in. TMUS?????

"How not to run a business news. Buy High Sell Low is T’s new marketing strategy. CNBC and Bloomberg News reported a deal could be announced this week or next, valuing the DirecTV business, which includes U-Verse and AT&T TV Now, at around $15 billion. That’s just a fraction of the $49 billion that AT&T paid for DirecTV in 2015."

"The deal is almost signed, sealed and delivered. With the FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai's approval, the merger approval has become a process formality. The merger could still face legal challenges from the few US States that remain opposed or from outside agitator, er. public interest groups and others. It is easy to sue. It would be nearly impossible, IMO, to block the deal. The DOJ has not yet given their approval. However, Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, indicated that DOJ would consider the merger by taking in all of the relevant inputs. The input from the FCC is by far the single most relevant and influential party in DOJ's decision process. And the two regulatory bodies work closely together, making it highly unlikely that Pai is riding off into the sunset alone."
Sprint offers free service for a year and poaches customers from Verizon and potentially T-Mobile. T-mobile doesn't care because they buy Sprint. Or maybe Sprint buys T-Mobile which I doubt.
"Hello *R"""
Dish is playing hardball trying to squeeze Tmobile to give up everything to make sure they are competitive among the big 3. Crazy Tmo will be worth more without giving so much. This deal will succeed because TMO will hit back and tell them to take a hike or take the deal as is.
"I added DISH to the 'merger play list' when they started deal talks. It has moved up over 30% since. During the past few days DISH and Sprint (S) are up by higher percentages than TMUS. S is up because there has been a 10-20% discount to the merger exchange ratio of TMUS/0.75. All but about 6% of the gap remains. DISH is higher because the deal will propel it into action to take advantage of their cash flows and capital before wireless makes the satellite business increasingly obsolete by the ability of mobile operators to beam gigabit bandwidth directly into homes with media content riding on top.DISH will be entering a new market with little experience or results. Despite that it may continue to move higher as a leveraged play on the merger - a ‘blue sky’ speculative stock based on the huge market opportunities rather than any performance that can be attributed to DISH directly. DISH will inherit Boost Mobile, a good starting point but also ‘just and MVNO operation’. Building its own network and fill it up will be a longer-term, unproven story. Don’t let the facts get in the way of taking some stake in DISH... being ‘Blue Sky’ means investors are free from such things as proven results to speculate more wildly. However, put in stop-loss orders along the way. DISH will have to show network and sales growth, eventually. If that does not prove to be great, the bubble that may develop over the next 12 months or longer could pop. Until results matter more than the blue sky effect, DISH stays on the list."

"Team Rep you don't know the difference in the Fiber Networks. FTTH FTTN does not define backhaul. ATT might have the a lot of skinny pipes but they only have Big pipes in their territory. CTL bought Level 3 which had the Big pipes in the nation. If you don't encourage TMUS to take them when they are low, it might be too late when they are big. CTL was just a telco transitioning to FTTH. TMUS should have bought Level 3, but stood by. Now they have a much better position with CTL and are passing it by. TMUS/ S and CTL would make ATT by far 3rd. Without it they have 5G and rent their big pipe."
$70 BOOM!!!
This will trade below 70
"Merger is coming , Trump is pushing it for 5 g"
TMUS is insisting that no company can own more than 5% of Dish. Dish will probably give that. They are planning being MVNO to all the rest and need backhaul. So there will swapping spectrum for backhaul until they get capacity
Sprint customers about to be woke. They are gonna get customer service they never knew existed. Been with Tmobile for almost 5 years now and I still go on and on about their service.

"Two months after completing its $26 billion merger with Sprint, T-Mobile plans to lay off a portion of the workers that came to it through the acquisition. According to TechCrunch, T-Mobile vice-president James Kirby told approximately 400 former Sprint employees on a call on Monday that they would need to find new work after August 13th."
Many analysts who had been more in favor of the merger than against it have hedged their bets in favor of the state AGs stopping it. There has been no substantial new information to base that on. I see it as fear of the unknown and of listening to the opposition arguments too blithely.
Wework seeks new CEO. He's gone and going to take our money with him. Pity a few weeks before the merger. Dead Deal. WeGone
"Legere says that all the options with existing players still looks the same. The same kinds of things that made sense 3 months ago still make sense now.He says that there are more options.. seems very upbeat about T-M prospects but dismissive of Cablecos with Sprint and DISh+ Amazon.Braxton says modest dividend would help pull in another class of investment, ie value funds and investors. The indication is that it won't likely happen until early next year."

"T-Mobile's recent PR points out the company's push to deploy extended-range LTE in the 600 and 700 MHz range. Signal travel further and penetrate into buildings better in the low-frequency bands, those lower than 1 GHz. That results in the need to use fewer base stations to provide coverage. There are trade-offs, however: since signals travel further and through and wrap around things more, they also collide with each other, causing interference. That also means the same bands cannot be duplicated as much. Its as if the WiFi signals in your home or business could reach into other buildings so that hundreds of other users devices were connected, bogging down the capacity and knocking you off the network. 4G-5G LTE is smarter than prior systems in handling interference and large numbers of users. However, that remains a trade-off because each local node must be fed bandwidth from another node hop or direct connection to a tower or fiber-optic or mmWave supplied base station. That 'fan-out' of capacity can expose weak links in the bandwidth supply chain.One advantage of the merger would be the ability to fill in the weak links in the 'network of networks' 5G network. While the low-band is great at providing the universal coverage piece, the mid-band, which under 5G includes up to 6 GHz, can be used to provide the mid-range of high capacity coverage and to supply the nodes of the low-band. That would allow the more extensive use of power-range limiting: the dynamic trimming of power to fit the needs of users while allowing more users to be packed into the network at high-bandwidth without causing interference. 5G is a more adaptive smart-network. Once capacity is built into the network, then it becomes practical to use ""network slicing"" - a service level form of network virtualization. And that would enable New T-Mobile to more effectively pursue government, medical, automotive, and IoT markets or work with partners to create new applications such as enhanced edge computing and dynamic-mobile VPNs."
so who's better buy and who's better dump ? T mobile to buy Sprint or Sprint to T mobile ? who's gonna bring. more money ?
John have Sunit make the deal with CTL (backhaul for spectrum). It would be easy every phone they put on the network gets them so much backhaul. It is the way out of this mess and gets everyone what they want.

"FORECLOSING ON NEW COMPETITIONThis deal would result in the new merged company blocking potential new competitors from entering the wireless market.A competitive wireless marketplace over the long term requires new entrants that can bring innovative products and services to consumers. So-called light MVNOs, which resell a wireless carrier’s service end to end, offer little opportunity for innovation.But full infrastructure MVNOs, which only use the “last mile” of the carrier’s network and manage the rest of the wireless service through their own networks, are emerging as potential new entrants. These companies are best positioned to bring competition because they rely mostly on their own technology to provide service and can innovate on products and pricing.But letting Sprint and T-Mobile combine significantly undercuts this dynamic because both companies have historically been the main partners for MVNOs – meaning most of these upstart firms would have just one carrier to work with. Right now, 68 percent of all MVNOs rely on Sprint or T-Mobile.Even worse, T-Mobile has shown open hostility specifically toward these full-infrastructure MVNOs – and combining with Sprint would give them even less reason to work with companies that could be a competitive threat. The company has repeatedly chosen not to commit to supporting full-infrastructure MVNOs.Consumers deserve more competition, not less. MVNOs are a way to get there – but only if regulators make sure they have a fighting chance to get in the game."
trash.get out now.you've been WARNED.
"What A Mess This Greedy MegaMerger is that will cost Tmobile Stock to Tank if Approved.This Merger is Bad NewsHere’s why the deal matters to you: if approved, the merger will reduce the number of national mobile phone providers from four to three, and eliminate two of the country’s lowest-cost cell phone providers, Sprint and T-Mobile. Less competition means we’ll have to face higher bills, lower data caps, and crappier customer service. Students, millennials, low-income families, communities of color, and anyone looking for a good deal rely on Sprint and T-Mobile for affordable mobile-Internet access. If the U.S. government approves this merger, consumers will have nowhere to turn for affordable access."
Dish is Selling Spectrum as we speak. Who are they selling it to? They dont have $6B to buy the spectrum. TMUS will regret this day and selling Spectrum. They are playing Russian Roulette.
UPGRADE COMING!
earnings are going to be solid
I do support for tmobile and on Friday I asked the MGr what's the deal with this merger?? He told me that Sprint still wants control of things and that's not going to happen. Tmobile wants Sprint just like MetroPcs. Seems to me that Sprint has a chip on their shoulder when they really shouldn't if you look at their stock price. Mgmt agreed with my assessment. Hope this helps. Not sure what I'm going to do but both companies are in the red now which is not a good sign. Almost as if this merger was bad news to everyone.
Should be $140-150 minimum right now

"This merger will allow T-Mobile to fast track to conversion to 5G, then sell off excess spectrum, tower leases, switching centers (data centers), personnel to pay down debt and then become the largest, most aggressive telecom company in the US. Sprint shareowners get to trade their #$%$ stock for a good stock. RIP Sprint."
and GO.....
Trapped @65 ... sad
FACT is Warren made a very big mistake investing a Foreign company like T mobile who agenda is to collect data on the USA and use it against the USA to farther the EU one world order. The Government knows now what is happening and will need to stop T Mobile soon. You for sure don't want to be holding TMUS when that happens. Americans data is not save in a foreign companies hand like TUMS
"The odds of the merger gaining final approval remain high, about 95% IMO.However, that is far from saying that the deal will happen without some compromise between the position worked out between the FCC gladhands and NewTM that Pai has accepted. The FCC has never delivered the structural requirements of the DOJ even though it has been abundantly clear that the US wireless industry had long fallen into a state of oligarchical over concentration that is far from being fully competitive. The financial industry is absolutely not to be trusted to be the judge of matters of industry structure as, like the companies involved, the interests are short-term and selfish. The DOJ is the last bastion or is supposed to be, to maintaining an orderly balance between monopolistic tendencies and the Free Enterprise system that our fellow idiots so easily claim to be in favor. The DOJ has never gotten the FCC or the industry to pursue a course of actions that goes beyond the remedial hacking that has failed to result in structural changes. If someone were to write a book about the subject if would stand out as just another folly to be forgotten. However, it is the matter that is in front of the DOJ for a ruling at this point in time and should be given due respect for the process of deliberations that is supposed to be taking place.I can't tell what will come out of the DOJ ATR. It should be something such as the spin out of Boost coupled to commitments that make it into something more than just another MVNO pawn... a piece of driftwood that o really does not matter unless it's picked up and made use of beyond being a reseller of no structural consequence.The DOJ may well figure that they must approve the merger as the better of bad alternatives. A good alternative would have been if the FCC had not been such a feeble spineless patsy over the past 20 years to succumb to the demand of the BORG Empire desire to assimilate everything without the formation of a balanced competitive structure.Perhaps some good will come out of this. DOJ should demand some new competition whether that is Amazon being able to develop a counter to the vision of Cloud 5G owned solely by the BORG Empire or the enabling of the cable companies, who are their own worse enemies so that NewTM should be willing. NewTM is one part of the overall puzzle. A good company but still a member of the BORG Consortium of overlords."

"T-Mobile's recent long-term loans make sense despite what I said recently about cutting back on debt. That is because the loans are for 10 years and under 6% interest. If the warning of economists that the US will see higher inflation in the future holds true, then having low-interest rate loans would help ensure future needs are met. The rates T-mobile was able to negotiate are handsomely low."

"John Legere and the media including investment media and commentary shows have made a big deal out of VErizon's loss of 307,000 subscribers. It was a 'big deal' in that it was the first time that VZ lost postpaid subscribers. It was blown up relative to the size of the loss: 307,000 is only 1/3 of one percent of their marketshare. Furthermore, it is not known whether that is a start of a trend or was just a abnormality. Verizon is the consumer marketshare leader that has enjoyed the ability to charge a premium over competitors. They are the proverbial fat cat/pig. As such, they can be viewed as being vulnerable or, from the other perspective, as being able to adjust plans and pricing to suit their objectives rather than strictly due to what the market forces on them. Is that being arrogant and less empathetic of their customers? Dam_n straight.. that is the nature of the beast of being the top dog in a market. That is what being a 'Big Blue' achieves - being able to be a bit arrogant in how you set pricing and product features (plans). The goal of a leader is to set that at a level that maximizes profits while not causing customers to flee to competitors. If you get so close to that edge that customers do leave, then it sets off alarm bells because you just may have triggered a market reaction that slides downhill. That is made more true in today's world in which news like this can 'go viral' in the social media.On the other hand, Verizon said that once they implemented unlimited plans that their losses ceased. Is that the absolute truth? The results are needed to see whether or to what degree that is true or if a snowball is heading downhill in favor of T-Mobile and ech, Sprint."

"Those following along with T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by insider Ronald Fisher, who spent a stonking US$36m on stock at an average price of US$103. That purchase boosted their holding by 163%, which makes us wonder if the move was inspired by quietly confident deeply-felt optimism.Notably, that recent purchase by Ronald Fisher is the biggest insider purchase of T-Mobile US shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$106. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider bought shares at close to current prices. Ronald Fisher was the only individual insider to buy during the last year."

"The US DOJ and FCC filed a brief with the court in favor of the merger as reported in the WSJ and other pubs.This position paper follows prior statements provided by each regulator.The question has (inevitably) come down to the issue of how the merger impacts competition in the prescribed retail dominated mobile market as prescribed narrowly by the DoJ AR and legacy precedent. (which is out of step with the direction of the industry and express intent of the 5G and beyond wireless/cloud-native world view, thus making Verizon and AT&T's dominance in broader markets ignored.)Nonetheless, the court must find that the combined remedies and market structure changes are negative to a magnitude that it compels the court to override the US regulators in charge of administering communications and antitrust laws. While the demeanor of Judge Marrero might be construed as being reasonable to the assertion that the DoJ and FCC have proven the merger will result in at least modest benefits to the US public, it remains in the hands of the court until a verdict is reached, probably in January, 2020. I place the odds of a favorable verdict as extremely high. At most IMO, the court will require additional teeth to the enforcement mechanisms for compliance or minor changes (a longer duration for price containment might be reasonable as NTM is very likely to pursue such beyond the current requirements. Companies seldom welcome interference in routine business matters such as pricing, however, if the plan is to head towards ‘more for less/same dollar’ value proposition strategy, then that can be accommodated so long as the terms allow for such flexibility."
"Man, hopefully Mike has some good news today!"
"When TMUS goes nowhere for a year as it has done the last 12 months, be thankful for the bountiful dividend."
"My thinking on Verizon's Go90 has changed somewhat: I haven't used Go90 for a few months. When I had, I thought it was punk: content for juveniles and not much of that was good. And the app sucked. The app now is among the best I have seen worldwide for mobile operator's captive video content. I still have some ease of use issues.. but I do for NetFlix, Hulu, YouTube, and Amazon services as well.The main issue has been that Verizon has hoped to convert Go90 into a premium service. It looks like they may keep it free to help with customer retention and to attract customers. Therefore, the strategy looks more like that of T-Mobile except that TM is providing the most popular OTT content supplier for which should appeal to a broader market. However, if Verizon keeps improving Go90 at the current rate, including some interesting original content, they will, at least, have a stronger hold on their subscriber base. How much subscribers can be held captive with 'just another' OTT service is questionable."
Update from Charlie:Decent indicator $TMUS $S deal could be done and announced today— @TMobile pushed release of earnings from 9am to after closing bell when there was a skedded analyst call so stay tuned to @FoxBusiness for final word
"Dish/Ergen comes to the table to negotiate and then admits he has no money? SCOOP: A snag in completing @dish/ Charlie Ergen purchase of spectrum/assets from @TMobile - @sprint was his need for ""financing,"" sources tell @FoxBusiness. Interesting if @deutschetelekom is providing financing. Deal announcement imminent so we shall see in coming days $TMUS $S"
I am sure there will be more states lining up to stop this. TMO does not need this extra Debt and Headachehttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3473042-texas-indiana-join-states-probing-sprint-t-mobile-deal
"AT&T's sour results, particularly the downturn in its Direct TV unit, is a positive for T-Mobile. Here's why:T-Mobile has placed its bets on providing 'all in there' packages that include popular OTT, over the top, services including 'Netflix on Us'. TMo's theme fits with the revolution that is occurring in broadband and wireless BB in particular: once users have availability to high broadband they opt to use OTT instead of conventional TV/Movie packages. Mobile users want to view media on the spur.. wherever they are and whenever they have the time. While they may view popular content at home or in a hotel room, they want the freedom of choosing where and when they view.That has made satellite service a platform that is destined to decline to the point that it becomes obsolete. AT&T acquired Direct TV at a point that growth was just starting to decline. The quarter's results confirm what many have thought would happen: customers are fleeing to Netflix and other OTT service providers.This follows failed attempts by Verizon to develop its own OTT service. That sends and ominous overall message: that the largest mobile operators fail to compete effectively for fixed or OTT media."
"No free cash flow to invest in network,no Sprint merger to get much needed spectrum and increased competion,expect downgrade coming any day now! From buy to hold and $46. price target is best guess."

"China is fully entrenched in using our need to find cheaper labor against us. We need to switch to a more friendly country if we are looking to develop an undeveloped country. We should have went to India and not China with our consumerism as they are based on colonialism and not seeking a communistic society. China has now the 2nd largest military and uses it as bat like Russia to expand. The South China sea, Crimea, Syria, Iran are examples of the strength in rise of communism due to our US Corporations giving away freedoms for the quick buck."
TMUS has reached a level of oversold that warrants raising the stock to a strong trading-buy and strong long-term accumulate-buy IMO. This is a difficult time to be bullish and it should only be done if you have money sitting on the sidelines and the skills and temperament to play it.

"Warren will pickup some additional ""Cheap Shares"" - soon"
what's the bottom line for the stock price based on the case? tmus going up or down?
Why is the CEO of T-Mobile stating. The merger is going to be approved by this summer? He giving us hint of a mass off layoff will begin during the summer time. If the FCC and the DOJ approved this deal. They are only helping German company and Sofbank richer. I just don’t see. How this helping the United State of America.
What is the reason behind this drop? Tmus is still very undervalued compare to other 2 mobile operators
Earnings tomorrow! Should be good numbers 
"That's what happens when you have these MegaMergers, Consumers cannot afford cable or dish TV. Just think how fast Tmobile's stock will drop if this BS MegaMerger was to go through. T will drop like a rock"

Is anyone else thinking that if TM gets over $100 they may do a 2 for 1 or 3 for 1 split
The synergy of the merger was saving them money they claimed. Now we read it is costing them.

"What's the price? My best guess: at least $11-$12 per $S share. Why? Using middle, that's $46B in equity, $37B in debt minus cash of about $4.5B. Total cost of deal to $TMUS is $78.5B but with $40B+ in synergies REAL cost is $38.5B. It's a good deal for them and good for Softbank. IMO DT gets 50% control so maybe Softbank gets a bit more premium. The market will discount the deal due to regulatory fear, but the deal gets done eventually."

But it always works if your patient enough."
"The news that the FCC-DOJ have put the 180 shot-clock on hold in order to evaluate New T-Mobile's detailed merger plans tells the market that the odds of the approval has improved. If the regulators were inclined not to approve, they would not be as interested in understanding the plans for 5G and other efforts. Currently and without the merger, Verizon and AT&T hold about an 85% marketshare in the emerging market segments that can be labeled as 'emerging 5G markets'. The duopolists control a vast majority of automotive, industrial and utility monitoring/control and other parts of IoT, medical, security and first responder, and the large enterprise and government sectors. Neither T-Mobile or Sprint have the scale or 'presence' in those markets to expect to gain share. Most analysts expect the duopolists to remain in a favorable position long into the future. That impacts how the regulators are likely thinking about the merger: it can provide a 3rd competitor in the mentioned 5G markets where there will otherwise be only the two duopolists.The stocks are higher because the merger odds have stepped a couple rings higher up the ladder."
What out have a big Trap.
"Is the market discounting T-Mobile's growth more than justified?Markets tend to factor forward projections for sales and earnings into the stock price as discounted for risk factors. The more uncertainty, the greater the discount. M&A activity has both positive and negative (reward vs. risk) factors. The financial industry is built around financial transactions with M&As paying the highest premiums with big paychecks for financial executives who have influence over the overall image projected. Despite attempts to build walls between that analytic functions and the cash register, the influence of the money that changes hands remains evident. Consider the financial projections of past major acquisitions: numerous studies of past M&As show that far more than the average result is below the projections with the resulting impact on the stock price of the merged entity being a short-term rise around the time the deal is announced and finalized followed by a period lasting from several months to several years of decline in the stock price. Only a small fraction of major mergers results in improvement in competitive position while the majority leads to no change to a loss of overall competitive standing and the loss of alternative opportunities that theoretically would have a greater chance for sustained success. US corporations tend to lavishly, by international standards, reward key executives with stock options that are rewarded in the event of a rise, even if temporary, in the stock price or early execution of options in the event of being acquired or the restructuring of the merger.Anticipating the conflict of interest, Deutsche Telekom influenced TMUS BOD to revise the options incentives so that much of the pay off for a merger has been taken off the table. This should result in more careful, analytic approach to the prospects for a merger or partnering with Sprint or cable companies. I think this has already played a part in the relatively casual approach T-Mobile/DT has taken in the assessment of a deal for the acquisition of Sprint. In any case, no definitive deal has been put on the table and there are another 40 days or so remaining during which Sprint-Softbank and Comcast+Charter have agreed to be in exclusive discussions."
"Notes: UBS How would Comcast-Charter deal impact T-Mobile: Legere - Cable coms would want to talk about MVNO but network needs investment so how are they going to get it? - all academicLegere - would not be my first choice to arm competitor cablecos with MVNO3-5 years customers will drive a ubiquitous seamless experience. Never say never about cableco deals.How are businesses doing, how are networks performing? confident T-Mobile is a very strong play for what happens to bring service to customers.Magnitude of business market/share: the 181 new logos business customers but marketshare are very low.

"Why are the markets higher? Sprint and TMUS? Because 'the market hates uncertainty'. The outcome of the election was within the bounds of what was predicted. The result is a divided Congress between the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the US Senate. That places the intended checks-and-balances back into government. That probably means more factious politics than under the Republican-controlled House and Senate of the past two years. However, business is comforted because nothing is likely to change much. There is a better chance that POTUS will be held back from what might be reckless behavior. The trade war with China has a greater chance of easing. Threats of conflicts overseas are probably lessened. And world leaders are more likely to see America as the bastion of democracy that autocracy some feared might hang in the balance. All in my own opinion of course."

"T-mobile has figured it out. Imagine how much T and VZ will need to add to burgeoning debt services. T-Mobile USA intends to use $2.0 billion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to acquire spectrum licenses pursuant to the FCC’s C-Band spectrum Auction 107, with the remainder to be used to redeem the Issuer’s 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026."
"while the rest of NASDAQ is falling, TMUS is up"
Tmobile its time to start throwing out the BIG $$$$$. People are wanting to get paid now it you want this Merger. Just don't get caught.
Tmus is the truth
Educated guess Buffet investing in a T-Mobile/sprint deal at least more talks
"This deal would result in the new merged company blocking potential new competitors from entering the wireless market.• A competitive wireless marketplace over the long term requires new entrants that can bring innovative products and services to consumers. So-called light MVNOs, which resell a wireless carrier’s service end to end, offer little opportunity for innovation.• But full infrastructure MVNOs, which only use the “last mile” of the carrier’s network and manage the rest of the wireless service through their own networks, are emerging as potential new entrants. These companies are best positioned to bring competition because they rely mostly on their own technology to provide service and can innovate on products and pricing.• But letting Sprint and T-Mobile combine significantly undercuts this dynamic because both companies have historically been the main partners for MVNOs – meaning most of these upstart firms would have just one carrier to work with. Right now, 68 percent of all MVNOs rely on Sprint or T-Mobile.• Even worse, T-Mobile has shown open hostility specifically toward these full-infrastructure MVNOs – and combining with Sprint would give them even less reason to work with companies that could be a competitive threat. The company has repeatedly chosen not to commit to supporting full-infrastructure MVNOs.Consumers deserve more competition, not less. MVNOs are a way to get there – but only if regulators make sure they have a fighting chance to get in the game."
TMUS broke out to a new all-time high. The stock has been held back despite good results due to uncertainties of the merger IMO. The long-term trend remains bullish.
Thanks T-Mobile !!!!
"Who is behind the opposition to the merger?Perhaps we will never know... or care much.CEO John Legere voiced suspicions (probably that many had been thinking, including myself) that the new crop of opposition to the merger was being funded by the companies that will be negatively impacted. Who are they? DISH Networks, AT&T, Comcast, and Charter are towards the top of the list.AT&T may be hit hard, harder than Verizon, by the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint because it is the most vulnerable, particularly for replacement of the DSL+DTV packaged services. Last quarter AT&T reported that its DirectTV unit had shed 490k subscribers. That is a lot of subs to lose in a single quarter given that AT&T has become the largest media company in America. AT&T's customer satisfaction ratings are in third place with Verizon and T-Mobile being close in the #1 and #2 spots and Sprint coming in slightly lower than AT&T. When it comes to media service, DTV ranks high among its peers. However, customers are not happy with its peers so that ranking does not mean so much. Subscribers have left both DTV and DISH, opting mostly for mobile service to view content.DTV, DISH, and cable broadband services are in the rifle sights of New T-Mobile's plans to roll out home broadband. There is a high likelihood, IMO, that DTV and DISH subscribers will jump ship rapidly as soon as NTM service is available to them. Talk about eliminating the pain points - these guys are hardly anything but."
Isn't the trial so obvious? The argument has been advertised for years and the verdict should already been out. FCC approved the deal for number of reasonable reasons and we are at war with rest of the world on 5G. The technological land scape has changed and the US is no longer seen as the leader of the next generation technology in communication. Do your homework democRats.
T and VZ will destroy tmus
Glad to pick up more here!
still waiting for $24...
"Today’s trading was a gift.T-Mobile sees the good times continuing in 2021, as the cost savings and economies of scale from its acquisition of Sprint kick in. The company has already achieved $1.3 billion in annual cost savings since the combination closed in April. CFO Peter Osvaldik said on Thursday that T-Mobile expects to see $2.7 billion to $3 billion in annual synergies in 2021. That includes savings from combining networks, brand and marketing budgets, and reduced administrative and back-office costs."
"Look how surprised you all are as TMUS goes lower and lower , Warren does not make a difference when nothing has changed T Mobile is a foreign company found by the EU to collect data on the USA and use that data to farther the EU's one world order. Any move higher is still only a chance to sell even more before the USA Government has to do something and stop TMUS form collect data on Americans"

T Mo CEO aleady playing that game to manipulate share by in advance saying he's leaving T Mo starting Next year. there will be many news created by both companies to drop shares on or before merger is ok by judge . S share holders paid based on T MO share prices. the more prices of T Mo drops it damages both T mo and S print share holders if any of them drops regardless . States and AG must be asked and contacted by all T Mo and S share holders to be protected by court and guaranteed by both companies that shares wont go down before and on merger after merger is close back to normal not controlled by the guarantee.
T-Mobile did Really Great this Quarter but this Merger Mess is Dragging them down. We should be a $80 by now. Thanks to this Merger Mess we are not going anywhere.
"T-Mobile bought Sprint synergies news. Verizon Communications Inc. lost regular wireless subscribers for the first time in a year, a troubling sign as the company hustles to catch up with rivals AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. in a race for 5G customers."
 BOOM! 
"Let me see TMUS getting $45 BILLION dollars of debt from S coupled with TMUS debt of $33 BILLION dollars of debt. That is $78 BILLION dollars of debt and then you sell your spectrum. WHAT do you own? If you sell your only tangible asset of spectrum you own nothing. They don't own the Towers, the FTTT, or the content. Oh maybe some 4G / 5G antennas so that is worth nothing. This is a horrible merger."
The Merger will be rejected

"Deutsche Telekom (OWNS T-MOBILE) has reported the highest ever annual revenue for a European telecoms company after its takeover of US rival Sprint helped it push past the #$%$100bn mark for the first time. Tim H�ttges, chief executive, said that ?growth on both sides of the Atlantic? would allow Europe?s largest telecoms group to increase its investment in German fibre build while delivering on its plan to ?attack the AT&T and Verizon duopoly? in the US. Annual revenue rose more than 25 per cent to #$%$101bn in 2020, boosted by the takeover of Sprint by its T-Mobile US business and strong customer growth in both German broadband and US wireless."
Looks like this stock got upgraded. Should be closer to $68-$70 by year end.
"The results of the latest quarter on financial analyst forecasts: Largely unchanged.The forecasts for T-Mobile were largely unchanged because analysts had already factored in that TMUS tends to beat their guidance. The latest quarter came in closer to analysts forecasts for earnings and about inline for sales. Even though the company increased its guidance for full-year sales, cash-flow and earnings, that only goes more to confirm the figures already forecast than change them.Sprint has a history of over-promising and the financial analysts have tended to bend over backward to fuzzy up the numbers in order to forecast higher sales, margins and earnings in further out periods. That has resulted in a very poor record for the financial industry: they have lived up to the bad name of ANALysts- spreadsheet crunchers who rely almost entirely on plugging of numbers than insights. There were only a minority of financial analysts who have been with me over the years in the assessments that Sprint had basic problems in the structure of their networks, spectrum and market position that would inevitably lead to where it is now and where it has become to be recognized to be going. Likely what has caused the latest round of downward revisions in Sprint's long-term forecast is the mountain of financial data, analysis and opinions that have recently been made public via the merger documents. The forecast for S shows an acceleration in losses for outlying years (see long-term forecasts available at numerous websites). The documents make it clear that if Sprint is not merged with T-Mobile it will be financially limited in what it can do to remain competitive. If Sprint spends on 5G to keep up with competitors, its marketshare will either drop or it will lose money and somehow must attract additional debt financing. If S decides to shift more towards being the cheap wholesale provider, work with cable companies and MVNOs and perhaps DISH, then it may be able to reduce its own CapEx but will see topline sales shrink. The merger with T-Mobile is the most and perhaps only solution to Sprint-Softbank's 15-year long befuddlement."
Anyone know why insiders are selling off their shares?
What's going on here? Why is it dropping from 3%?
Outage gonna make T Mobile Drop alot and make short market on T Mobile for shortz ;)
"Congratulation on T-Mobile and Sprint...At the core of the 5G arms race is the issue of spectrum ownership. Sprint's 2.5 GHz spectrum and T-Mobile's strong balance sheet would enable the merged carrier to roll out 5G on mid-band frequencies and be two to three years ahead of Verizon/AT&T.When combined, T-Mobile/Sprint would own more radio spectrum than AT&T or Verizon, an important edge as 5G wireless services are rolled out. T-Mobile will finally have the deep block of 2.5 GHz midband spectrum they always coveted. That will allow the new T-Mobile to mount the most credible threat either Verizon's or AT&T's network supremacy has ever faced.The old T-Mobile was a pure growth and stock buyback story while the new T-Mobile story is going to be a merger integration and synergy extraction story, not that it won't ever return to the old growth story.T-Mobile and Sprint predict some $6 billion in back-office cost savings would result from combining billing operations and information technology departments. The companies also plan to combine wireless networks, cellphone towers and retail locations.T- Mobile US and Sprint had agreed on new merger terms and were looking to close the deal as early as April 1, 2020. Under the revised deal, T- Mobile's parent Deutsche Telekom will hold about 43% of the combined entity, up from the 42% that the German group would have held. SoftBank will hold about 24% and the rest by public shareholders.SoftBank has agreed to surrender about 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the 'new company' after the deal closes, changing the exchange ratio to 11 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, higher than the originally agreed 9.75 shares. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to receive the original fixed exchange ratio."

"AT&T's Warner Media head, Stankey was interviewd for an article in which he says he is surprised by the ruling to allow the nT-Mobile merger. He says that this throws doubts into management of companies... insinuating that DoJ, FCC and the court's role is to maintain the even keel of status-quo business structure and practices. He could not be more wrong.For startes, The long-standing course of the administrators who oversee the converging ICT industry has been to allow the large facility-spectrum mobile monopoly companies to acquire pretty much whatever they wanted so long it was outside of their core business. AT&T, the largest diversified ICT company was allowed to acquire media and satellite companies despite some objections because the engulfe3d market shares were not calculated similar to the way Sprint and T-Mobile's under the merger. I've pointed out that AT&T has been nortoriously agrievous of the public by forcing them to acquire packages of DSL, Satellite, and phone services. Media has become part of these offerings either directly or via OTT addons. This bundling of products leads to lack of choices because the choice of a single or two among the 3-4 is priced in a monopolistic 'take it all or suffer' basis. AT&T extols the virtues of backaged services in many of its quarterly calls... how it helps lock in subscribers and increase revenues and margins. What is fails to say is that this is an abuse of the power of monopoly called prodcut tying. AT&T says they do not do product tying because customers can choose the parts of the package. In reality, consumers who choose one of the services are at such a disadvantage when trying to fill our their own selection from limited alternatives that the arguement that this is not monopolistic product tying falls apart. Just try to assemble a package of satellite from DISH, DSL from AT&T in areas where cable is not available or otherwise not a choice. The merger does cause a change: it will likely force AT&T and others to abandon the practice of monopolistic product tying because DISH and nT-Mobile will soon offer better, easier to buy and easy to cancel, sets of services for lower prices: more for less with easy choices. Of course the heads at AT&T services think this is bad... the problem they will have is that consumers will think the impact of the merger and DISH side deal are a set of much better choices that leaves AT&T scrambling to rewrite their BORG Empire consumer harming playbook.""Look at all the little piggies wallowing in the dirt. can you hear them squeal?"""
I have been with Tmobile for over 10 years. My internet speed absolutely sucks in my area. My family with AT&T is like five times faster than mine. I am with TMUS because I like the company but good grief they need more towers.
This merger has stalled and is not going to be approved. This will save stockholders of losing everything and preserve both companies from being destroyed.
"When TMUS realizes their huge mistake in not taking out sprint the king of spectrum, they'll be back to the big table for a much higher revision of that ridiculous low ball. We at TMUS could have easily taken the #1 spot with sprint under our belt. Spectrum is a finite resource !"
"In November 2020....Warren did Whut? Berkshire buys T-MobileIn its recent 13F filing, Berkshire revealed it bought T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), scooping up 2.4 million shares worth about $276 million at the end of the third quarter and worth about $311 million today. By Berkshire's standards, it wasn't a huge purchase, occupying only the 33rd–largest holding in the Berkshire portfolio. That means T-Mobile was likely purchased by one of Buffett's younger lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler."
Merger is a Dead Deal. RIP
One word “5G”. This stock is one of a kind. T-Mobile is better than $VZ. ER have better room to run. Stock is under current avg. this is bullish 
"DISH knows they strike several sub MVNO agreements with Big Cable, Big Telco for backhaul. So cost per handset is much lower than TMUS to put on network. So they can compete with all the big 3. That is why the Dish deal stinks. TMUS would be building towers and Big Cable and Telco would be building backhaul. DISH is the middleman with very limited risk with a lower cost structure than TMUS. That is why they are fighting about SIM rights. DISH wants complete control of the SIM and even reselling it another MVNO partner. DISH is very cunning with this deal. It is bad for TMUS."
HUGE BEAT AND CUSTOMER ADD!!!! Going to FLY UPWARD!
"Merger efficiencies will take TMUS to $225. Adding wireless cable TV and broadband Internet access and throwing Comcast, et al for a loop will take it to $350."

"Why does CEO John Legere continue to go after Verizon (and AT&T) like a southern #$%$ after a crooked politician being run out of town with a tar brush and feathers? Simple: ""Because that is where the money is."" to paraphrase famed bank robber Willy Sutton. Verizon and AT&T continue to hold almost 2/3rd of US consumer mobile marketshare and a larger percentage of overall industry marketshare that includes automotive, medical, emergency responder, other parts of government contracts, the Internet of Things IoT, and the corporate sector. T-Mobile and Sprint have a combined share of the overall market of about 25%. T-Mobile has gained several points in the consumer market over the past four years, however, it remains a small fry compared to the diversified marketshare leaders. T-Mobile has less to gain from picking on vulnerable Sprint and that would do less to enhance TM's brand image - what bragging rights come from picking at Sprint's carcass? By beating up on Verizon, which has held the reputation as having the best network in the US and continues to hold the largest retail consumer marketshare, T-Mobile is able to gain credence for improvements in network coverage and quality while pursuing the more direct comparison of plans and pricing."
"T-Mobile just announced the results of the FCC 600 MHz 'Incentive' auction. From the PR:""1) T-Mobile walked away from the auction with 31 MHz of spectrum on average – 45% of the total – stretching across the entire United States and Puerto Rico. 2) This new spectrum will enable T-Mobile to expand its LTE network to new areas of the country – increasing choice and competition for consumers who haven’t had any – and increase capacity for existing customers.3) We’ll start using some of this spectrum later this year, well ahead of expectations.: ""Articles should be out soon. Search for the complete PR. I had guessed TM would acquire between 20 and 40 MHz so this comes in just a smidgen above the average of that - it helps to be vague in forecasts so that you can claim to be right.Here is the situation: With the 600 MHz spectrum combined with existing 700 MHz, T-Mobile can provide a layer of wide coverage and bandwidth-to-coverage using the low-bands that provides the 'pervasive layer of coverage' the most influences the user experience. In other words, if you can't get connected to a minimal level of 'broadband' bandwidth in most places and within buildings, then the attractiveness of the service falls to crapola. With that foundation undergarment in place, T-Mobile can lace up the higher bandwidth service using mid-band AWS and the new high-band 3.5 GHz, WiFi (of course), and higher bands layers for interconnecting to base stations and UEs. What TF does T-M need Sprint? To flagellate themselves out of some industry spun perversion?"
1st. VZ earnings.2nd. T earnings 3rd TMUS earnings Distant 4th Dish earnings.Is it time to swing trade TMUS into and just after they report?
"very happy about subscriber growth. blowout number, congratulation to T-mobile."
T-mobile has neither the technology nor the financial resources to scale 5G and compete with VZ & T. Can you hear me now??
"S and ZTMUS charts look neutral to slightly bullish. They TA looks to be heading into a sideways pattern that varies 3-5% between the high and low range of the band. This is, IMO, more the time to accumulate than trade the stocks. A move higher could be precipitated by TMUS turning in good results and a favorable outlook. Otherwise, the movement may wait for the outcome of the merger."
"Like $NOK overall, I believe the 5G FastMile FWA Router announcement with $TMUS is being completely underestimated and the fact that NOK leads in this market globally with other carriers such as Swisscom, Optus, Zain, and others further validates that NOK will see significant growth in 2021.TMUS's strategy is genius as they are not marketing to replace your cable provider at home, but provide a separate secure Office Internet connection. Cable providers bundle Internet with T.V., security, and mobile devices so making a switch isn't easy, but adding an Office Internet connection as part of an onboarding of new employees is much easier and cleaner than implementing an expense or stipend program. (Especially for Fed, State, and Local Gov't Employees as Tax issues arise due to the need to separate out personal vs. business use)This is being underestimated and, with all the FWA contracts NOK has signed, I expect this will bring in NEW revenue of $2B to $4B in 2021 globally and more than offset the business lost with VZ.NOK will see $8 to $10 per share once this is realized unless they are acquired first."

I would not invest or use T Mobile it is a foreign company setup by the EU to collect data on the USA . Could be the biggest data breach every caused by a foreign Nation and the USA is going to have to stop T mobile at some point and you do not want to be holding that stock when they do.
$60 Here it comes.
Gift from the Gods at this price lol thank you Wall Street
HALTED !OH NO....90'S OPEN TOMORROW......
Find it intriguing that nobody seems a day over 40 years in T mobile advertising... never saw this age demographic in T Mobile’s ads. I guess they don’t really care aboutUSA aging and booming population?!
"The New T-Mobile merger has a 90+ chance of being approved IMO. The approval may tack on some requirements. However, it is extremely unlikely that those will upset the prospects for the merged company to move forward to redefine the mobile space to a degree that propels it to gain an additional 8-12% marketshare over the next seven years. If New T-Mobile is highly successful it will outpace AT&T and will challenge Verizon for the number one spot in not only the retail segment but also for IoT and will take significant share of enterprise and government business segments. In ten years, New T-Mobile has a slight chance to become the largest mobile operator in the USA. That may seem crazy but the business pivots on having the most efficient network and, going forward, New T-Mobile will be in a position to extend a 4G=5G platform to provide more services for a lower price while still making a tidy profit. There is the critical word 'execution' and simply 'holding it together' to perform on trend. People are not machines. New T-Mobile has the depth of management and solutions-oriented approach that favors well. However, investors always must look at the results and how VZ and T are countering. If the merger goes through, N. Tmo will have an open field to expand into new services that can almost be expected to result in growth in sales and profits even if not handled as well as in the past."
How long will it take for combined company to raise prices and add more call centers in the Philiippines?
"Assuming deutsche Telekom pushing for 30 billions of dividends between 2023 to 2025 (that is half of 60 billions of capital return management were hinting at the investor presentation in March), dividend per share per year will be 8$ starting 2023. Applying Verizon dividend yield ratio, tmus should be trading at 188 by 2023"
"""gives an advantage to T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS, +0.32%, which already had a substantial amount of mid-band spectrum before the auction and has begun deploying it.""I said this all along! TMUS has the best spectrum to start off any wireless biz. AT&T and VZ have very high band which is more costly and difficult to integrate with existing network"
"Riding the news media is a sure way to get whiplash. CNBC reports that DoJ might be requesting that NewTM give complete network access to DISH. The trouble with news reports is this can mean more complete physical access to sites, or complete access to networks under the MVNO arrangement, or more complete access to customer-related data and routing information, which is a highly prized asset of operators.In any case, the deal is edging closer to being consummated and DoJ granting approval. This is a jobs program for law firms. The joint DoJ and FCC approval may be out next week.I think that the AG's case has a good chance of being wrapped up sooner than has been suggested by the court schedule and appeals process. The AGs may want a pound of flesh to walk away. The parties may resolve the case out of court by October."
55 is a bargain loading up today.
"Why T-Mobile does not depend on John Legere or any CEO to develop success and why John may stay at New T-Mobile:T-Mobile is a story about leveraging of the key ingredients that make wireless a success. At its roots, mainstream wireless business depends on the efficient use of capital to acquire spectrum and build cost-efficient and capable multiple-service networks. These networks are based on industry standards somewhat arbitrarily segmented into generations that started with 1G during a period when there were multiple competing technologies along both proprietary and standardized design paths. With each successive generation the advantages of adopting the most common industry standard grew: ease of roaming on other operators networks, lower cost and more capable equipment and more common devices among them. That caused operators to migrate towards the 3GPP standards, which authored 4G-LTE, 4G-Advanced (2nd gen. of 4G that works better with 5G), and 5G. Along the way operators using other standards or proprietary network technologies such as Sprint-Nextel iDen had to move users to new devices that worked on other bands so they could repurpose the spectrum to the 3GPP standards.T-Mobile has migrated to the common standards without losing subscribers similar to Sprint because they acquired fresh spectrum the company used to deploy the latest gen technology. Sprint had more problems and still faces a shortage of easy to use, wide coverage spectrum.The T-Mobile+Sprint merger sets the company up to exploit a mix of spectrum to deploy the latest, more efficient 4G-A+5G capable network. The advantage of using multiple bands with the newest network tech includes connecting to customers based on their needs or what's called ‘best connected’ use of spectrum. If customer use is a vending machine that communicates low bandwidth on periodic bases, it may best use narrow-band guard-channel that would otherwise go unused. If the user is a household containing multiple video uses, it may best connect using Sprint’s 2.5 GHz connected through a 5G home router. The advantage is being able to fit the network to the market rather than horn shoe customers to fit the network. That works out to be a better experience for customers and a better return on capital investment.Why that may incline John Legere to stick around to see the situation flower:NewTM will have roots-up network advantage over its competitors. That is why it can plan to offer lower prices and higher broadband packages while including more bells and whistles such as multiple number calling, Netflix on Us, and growing data rather than escalating prices (indicative of AT&T, Comcast). This will be an exciting time to be the ‘salesman in chief’ of New T-Mobile.On the other side the picture, taking over the CEO spot at WeWonk will be fraught with fundamental problems. The business plan is not unique and is oversold, over leveraged, and highly competitive at a time when the US economy will like come into a headwind. Competitors that have been managed more conservatively are enjoying WeWonk’s problems by grabbing market share. Meanwhile, WeWonk does not disclose numbers on site revenues or aged revenue, which makes comparisons to competitors difficult. The gross losses, however, are startling. If Legere were to take the CEO spot, he would face a much different role. Being a flamboyant spokesperson just won’t cut it until years of probably very painful restructuring take place. That will make WeWonk look like another basket-case Sprint with the prospect of needing to trim costs aggressively. WeWonk will probably see shrinkage… like the Seinfeld episode... “I just got out of the pool!” will be an embarrasing proposition for the front man. The more I think about it, the less likely it looks that John Legere will want to leave the company is about to take on AT&T and Verizon more directly and across the board."
Below 50 day moving average...bounce back coming?
"T-Mobile sent me a PR about the latest OpenSignal mobile network survey for US operators. This shows that T-Mobile has continued to show improvement against the competitive field in the mainstream mobile market. Note: the Opensignal and other broad surveys reflect the use of mobile phones by the general population. These can be used to infer service capabilities for applications outside of the consumer market such as automotive, security and IoT. However, those markets depend on a service contract that may include requirements such as uptime assurances or very low pricing. That makes use of this data to determine the competitive position or changes less certain. As operators make the shift to 4G-Advanced and 5G (or a hybrid of the two), the ability to apply the network to multiple services at a competitive cost will increase. That generally means that the operators that have the highest degree of the 4G-A/5G coverage and capacity will be more competitive across multiple categories of service. It also means that building such a network to serve the mainstream market makes it less expensive and more flexible to upgrade or, simply, allocate virtual service capacity to serve the expanded applications. T-Mobile's CEO, John Legere, points to the competition between T-Mobile and Verizon. That makes practical sense because T-Mo and VZ have the best performing and most likely to stay competitive in the near term. While all operators have made improvements to their networks, Verizon and T-Mobile have, IMO, the most effective platforms to take advantage of the continued evolution of networks and markets. I expect T-Mobile to continue to gain on Verizon and for the company to pull ahead in key metrics by the end of next year. The character of the network advantage depends on whether the merger with Sprint goes through as expected. T-Mobile has a significant advantage in low-band spectra that will be in the process of being exploited more fully over the next few years. That benefit will be magnified with the merger of Sprint's networks from both an infrastructure and a market density perspective. Two points that can be taken from this and other surveys: No US (or worldwide) operator now comes close to the promises for 5G low latency performance. The US operators have average latency between 58 ms (AT&T) and 70 ms. This ranks about double that for the average cable service. The reason for that is based on how the networks are architected and the latency of the existing base of equipment. 5G base station equipment can reduce latency between connections to user's devices down to less than 10ms (as low as 1-3ms is technically possible). However, many networks use wireless relays and all networks must transit to fiber optic and networks of mobile competitors and third parties to provide the open gambit of services. There is much hype about how 5G will lower latency to a fraction of what is common today. However, this will be a long road before that destination is reached for general service. What will drive this is when applications that consumers want drives it or the specialty market silo apps, such as the much-hyped remote-surgery applications grow large enough to compel performance improvements more broadly.AI, real-time multiplayer gaming, virtual+real world interplay, and other distributed/tiered applications will likely help drive the market to improved latency and jitter performance. Broadband also plays a part - but it is over-hyped. It won't be massive increases in bandwidth but the reliability and ability to continuously deliver bandwidth while both stationary and mobile that will drive the market."
TMUS holding up surprisingly well today.
Execs received stock options the other day. Only shares sold were withheld shares obligated to pay taxes owed.
Street Thugs taking advantage of TMUS news quiet period due to Spectrum Auction. Slowly beating it down knowing company has Duct Tape over their mouths. They did the same thing with Sprint during last auction. Low low low....
Potential of this Company is enormous....5G broadband in addition to 5G wireless service and massive Synergies from Sprint merger with enormous cash flow potential. This is exciting....$160-$200 is coming for this stock!
"This is my favorite company in my portfolio. In addition to the merger gain, T-Mobile is going to revolutionize the wireless industry in the next decade. Their massive investment in 5G will allow for new technology, and really a new way of life that we can only dream of."
"Most likely Starlink (Elon Musk) will partner (not buy or merge), I repeat partner with one or more wireless companies to make better use of the Starlink satellites.It's a gamble at this point."
they sold us out
well first time here just bought 200 tmus at 132.95 I pay them every month see if they can make me some money lol see what happens
T-Mobile US is up 7.23% to 92.85
"WOW the US Government is just Now Having Concerns over this Bad Deal???T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest mobile operators in the United States, had agreed to merge in April. The companies initially anticipated closing the merger deal in the first half of 2019, but US antitrust regulators are currently reviewing the acquisition deal and have expressed concern over it reducing the number of wireless service providers in the country from four to three."
ATT is still the daddy they will control DTV and Spectrum plus cell phones are y'all not seeing they will be close to a monopoly
"This merger is not in the hands of investors so should they invest in TMUS?Ask basic questions like ""What is driving T-Mobile's growth in sales and profits and is that likely to continue if the merger does or does not go through?"" T-Mobile has grown because it started building the spectrum and networks needed to deliver coverage and bandwidth to millions of more customers. The company has more unfilled capacity on its new networks, particularly in the low and mid-band than its competitors. That means even without the merger the company should continue to be able to price services competitively to gain more subscribers and sell a richer mix of services to them for a profit. So, TMUS remains a buy-accumulate for long-term investors regardless of what happens with the merger. The stock could move lower but the mid-long term trends remain in place. What happens if the final deal that gets struck with DoJ calls for the spin out spectra and Boost Mobile that is seen as harmful to the rollout of 5G? It is unlikely that DoJ would make demands that put a straight jacket on NewTM to the extent that it stifles the growth. However, that remains a risk and is probably why TMUS has not broken to a higher price level than seen thus far."
I am optimistic about this Share and I have 20 calls for 145 Jan 2021 ending and 15 calls for 135 2022 ending.

"As much as I hate Trump...he will not allow China to beat us in 5g. This deal is key to maximizing our lead in the 5g race. Watch how he kicks the new AG in the leg to move this deal forward. National Security must? Maybe, but this guy loves the word first, beat China, etc... This deal will get approved. Under any other normal climate in politics we probably get canned. But it's a new climate now and to win at all cost, even if it not in our own interest. So you guys talking about jobs killers....Trump don't care. It winning that's important to this administration. Again I am not for Trump. But he will make this deal work."
Any clues on what tomorrow's announcement is?
Did I read correctly on the internet that Comcast was very interested in acquiring TMUS????
"Deutsche TK will own 42%Softbank 27%Public shareholders 31%T-Mobile/Deutsche will get 9 out of 14 BOD director positions, and thus likely the chairman position.The companies said they hope to close the deal in the first half of next year, or approximately 12 months. That is optimistic, but they should state an optimistic time frame and urge DOJ and FCC that all the wonderful things they have planned that will benefit the US economy, stimulate new jobs, etc. pend their decisions. It is a thing of 'calculated bravado' - some of the promises may be oversized but so long as the message sinks in, it is the correct tack to take. The merger is a bold step because it goes against the former inclination of the DOJ and FCC. However, the companies are not walking out on a limb by saying that the industry is seeing more competition entering from cable and, still vaguely defined, other parties who can make use of mmWave and other bands. DISH is not mentioned by anyone much these days because the company has yet to do anything except punt the ball (diddle with their spectrum with IoT vaporware)."
Zacks sux.
If the preliminary results are true this stock is worth $77.What do you guys think
"Guy Adami, of Fast Money, target $125 per share.Guy Adami, is the Ted Williams, of Stock Pickers."
That's what I'm talking about!!
Merger approved.
"If ( $BA Boeing) and ( $EADSY Air Bus wanted ) to merge, I would understand blockage of the merger. Yet $TMUS and $S blockage is preposterous $S is not a competitive carrier by itself. It has 44$ B in debt and it kills it. It has no power nor ingenuity to compete. It is drowning by itself, $TMUS and $S would revitalize the industry. Bigger companies will be competing with bigger companies. More services and more innovations. Moreover Merger will reduce expanses by 6$ B Merger must go through. It will go through."
TMUS always does this. Give it a couple of days and it'll go up.
Even without Sprint the name of the game is content ownership. It's went ATT bought Directv and TW. The mobile carriers who own the networks own the roads. They need to wake and realize they hold all the chips. That's why it's becoming less about mobile churn and more about owning one of the 3 most robust wireless networks. T-Mobile really doesn't need Sprint. Even without being one of the 3 largest wireless carriers in the US in a world where everything is going mobile is the reason that all 3 of the big carriers is fundamentally vastly undervalued.
TMUS reached an all time high at 94.18
China virus?? spoken like a true Trumpian
"Former FCC McDowell points out that California and New York are heavily influenced by the CWA, the Communications Workers of America, because of the increased competition by the mostly non-union companies."
T-Mobile will initiate a 'significant' share buy-back. This comes on the heels of the end of the merger talks with Sprint-Softbank and a few days after receiving an upgrade in its bond and corporate credit ratings. This announcement hits while the stock is at discount to the 12-month price range which moves it to a strong short to long-term buy at this time IMO.
Looks like this deal is going South fast.
Far better than VZ but half the market value. I am up for Tmus
"The merger prospects have increased to 98% as the process has narrowed its focus on the remaining sticking points surrounding the issue of competitive industry structure going forward. The merits of the merger including the impact on the level of competition including in rural America, and the incentives to invest in 5G while maintaining price competition are overwhelmingly favorable. The flurry of opposition groups has not been able to offer a counter to the benefits posed by the merger. A key failure of the opposition is that the current status quo is not at all satisfactory and the groups offer not better scenario. The opposition offers not 'plan C'. While pouncing on the potential negatives, often with highly visible conflicts of interest and shortcomings in their arguments, they do not come up with a better path for industry structure. If really pursuing the public interest they would have engaged more than the masses of pointy-headed lawyers to shape their arguments IMO. That has made the opposition neutered at their own hands.The merger is as sure as these things can get IMO."
I must have a lot more learning to do in this field because other than this being a very red day I don't understand why this stock and many others have such huge dips with a good ER's coming out. Any info would be helpful.
That pullback was an easily Christmas gift. TMUS is better off without Sprint’s balance sheet and customer service woes. Why tarnish the “cool” network with a company with one of the worst reputations of any consumer brand? This is going to $80 soon and will be $95 in 2018.
Quibi x Tmus is a winner
"The Sacramento Business Journal came out with a news story with this headline earlier today:""T-Mobile promises $41 billion investment in California for Sprint deal""Later today, a corrected article came out with this revised information:""In order to get California to sign off on its $26 billion acquisition of Sprint Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. has agreed to invest $41 billion in its nationwide network and to provide 99% of households statewide with 5G broadband.""So, T-Mobile is not giving away the boat to California in order to sway one of the most influential states.As mentioned earlier, the timeline for achieving 99% 5G coverage in the state was not given. NewTM plans to achieve 90% coverage in about five years, making this deal a win for California. The state is among the more cost-effective and prepared to deploy 5G and among the most profitable states for mobile operators. California is also the most important US state for mobile software and apps development."
"Thus far, the market is not impressed with T-Mobile's plan to purchase $1.5 billion worth of stock over the next year with pending action by parent company Deutsche TK."
earnings release ...shorts are heading for the hills. Earnings release is any day now. take a look at the insider activity and tell me this thing is not going to the moon.
"The merger deal remains highly likely to move forward for the same reasons that are has been: 1) Sprint/Softbank must merge or slink into the background as sales growth and profits remain fantasies. 2) T-Mobile/Deutsche have a reason to merge IF the price of Sprint is not inflated or governance is not given up unduly. Collaboration with Softbank can be a good thing if it brings with it favorable leverage for growth and profit returns.The hickup has been that Softbank has more invested in Sprint than just the stock position. However, T-Mobile/DT should be hard-nosed in not wanting to pay what amounts to as a pumped-up sales price. While not quite a 'fire sale' Softbank must depart from majority ownership and control at a rational price.Most likely, Softbank's BOD and backers will relent while DT/T-Mobile might give an inch or two to allow the deal to move forward.There remains about a 90% chance this will get to the stage it will be put forward to the FEDs."

"We didn’t break the bankOn the auction. Stock popping. Verizon Communications successfully bid $45.4 billion for 3,511 licenses, while AT&T won with $23.4 billion for 1,621 licenses and T-Mobile won with $9.3 billion for 142. In total, the FCC said there were $81.2 billion in winning bids."
Big RED tomorrow
"Sprint's stock price to a 6% nosedive on the WSJ reports that the DOJ Antitrust Division has met with T-Mobile and Sprint to voice that the merger is unlikely unless there are (more) structural changes made to the deal. As mentioned previously, there are factions within DOJ that hold and likely will continue to have the opinion that the merger should not be allowed based on conventional measures including the HHI. That opposition has to reject New T-Mobiles and hired economic experts that the Market that is considered by the HHI and impacts analysis now includes the hybrid fiber-cable, satellite and MVNO market participants. To many in the industry, the exclusion of companies from those segments of the encompassing ICT industry makes no sense. At the least, Comcast, Charter, and others must in part be considered as competitors because the markets have obviously crossed over.Another aspect that is commonly ignored by the media and many financial analysts is that the nature of wireless itself has changed: starting with 4G-Advanced and soon to accelerate with 5G-NR, the new applications that are expected to spring from the new platform are highly dominated by just the two Duopolists, Verizon and AT&T. VZ and T hold virtually all of the first-responder network and market, over 90% of automotive, enterprise and government contracts, about 94% of IoT. The 5G markets are more dependent on the scale than the mainstream mobile subscriber market. That makes very little sense given that the media and financial analysts place emphasis on 5G as the roadmap of future competition. For DOJ to ignore that would be a definition of insanity."
Is American Tower and crown communication the leader in tower rental- why cant T-Mobile start building its own towers ???? Just wondering what the matrix isThank you
"T-Mobile and Sprint have been building their networks under their individual plans, however, much action has taken place that shows the two are preparing to be merged. There may be a 'Plan C' option that could fall out of the merger process if the regulators do not approve the deal: The companies might engage in a closer working relationship that includes roaming on each other's networks and the sale of compatible devices"
"New articles and reports repeat the rumors that Apple's iPhone will not have 5G capability until 2020. Thus far, Verizon has come out with their 5G Home fixed 5G wireless service in a limited metro coverage area. Sprint has made some noise about having the first 5G mobile device and starting on 5G ready. However, those remain more smoke than fire: the problem is the chicken-and-egg scenario. Only T-Mobile is deploying 5G as a nationwide network from the start. It has the ability to deploy as a mobile network because it has enough new low-band spectra to use so that conversion of 4G and 3G is not initially needed. Handset suppliers will be reluctant to make 5G available until operators are well on the way to deploying it to reach a large percentage of POPs.The 5G fixed service approach avoids that problem by using power-tethered devices that use higher frequency bands. And fixed can be rolled out on a gradual basis. However, that means revenues start out as a trickle instead of a flood of consumer use.Let's not forget that each new generation of wireless has taken 2-3 years to get up to speed after the first announcements of availability. 5G will be similar except that it has the ability to be deployed as cable replacement and open up new offerings in IoT and, potentially, new applications. The largest market opportunity for achieving increased revenue is cable-replacement and coincidental other broadband services. 5G fixed can be rolled out market-by-market. 2019 may be announced as 'the year of 5G' and operators will each claim to have gotten there first. However, it will take until at least 2020 for the combination of network coverage and bandwidth plus market penetration of devices to give the claims real meaning."

"Classic move in TMUS, this morning it went through the roof up about .85, then moved down around .09, it is not TMUS because it is too good to be sensitive to the wave of the tick. It will knock on 65 on Monday again, because it already eats up ATT's lunch everyday."
The merger is over and Tmobile will be able to move forward without all of that extra debt
"People are short sighted - T-Mobile and Sprint merger will form a great frequency band and coverage solution. Corporate expenses will drop sharply afterwards - duality in sales,marketing, advertising, Human Resources. Its combined customers volume will enable it to offer better deals to its customers and T-Mobile customers will benefit from Sprint pricing as the combined company would not raise package prices."

Update From Charlie G...Deal participant on @sprint @TMobile merger: chance it gets announced weds likely though that @JusticeATR does its official announcement Thursday look for a possible weds media advisory as all sides nail down divestiture details more as story develops @FoxBusiness $TMUS $S $DISH
This reminds me of Sprint Nextel merger $65 to $6
"Sprint merger with Tmobile is a done dealEach Sprint share will get 10% of TMUS share valueSo if TMUS is $68, Sprint shareholders are guaranteed to get $6.8So load up both Sprint and TMUS ASAP"
Thumbs up if you're glad Teamcrap stopped posting long-winded gibberish.

"Deutsche Telekom is the only one keeping John from selling the company's future. The Dish deal seems wrong. There is really one deal and that is a backhaul / MVNO deal to get out of this. Every phone put on network gets so much backhaul. This way you build an infrastructure of back haul as they build their network. If they dont then you are still a winner. If they put more phones on the network than TMUS, they start paying for spectrum. Cash is just a temporary fix. Look at FTTT guys and get a deal done."
Does Deutche bank own 65% of TMUS?
"So no deal says Faber , well their is NO new T mobile or Dish , wow"
"Why does Sprint need to merge more than T-Mobile?This statement by John Legere, June 20, sums it up in a single sentence:""Of course, all wireless companies will eventually roll out some form of 5G, and both T-Mobile and Sprint have pledged to deploy 5G on our own. But the reality is that T-Mobile’s 5G network will be broad – though not deep, except in select markets. And, Sprint’s 5G network will be deep in some markets, but not broad.""T-Mobile lacks the 100 MHz wide spectra channels needed to deliver Gigabyte wireless that can replace cable. However, TMo has a way out of this: either buy spectrum from DISH or acquire licenses to the 3.5 GHz and mmWave spectra bands. The purchase of DISH's spectrum would likely be expensive. The acquisition of additional licensed spectrum probably won't be expensive but can take a few years to acquire and clear for use. Sprint can't build out the extensive coverage needed to compete on equal footing against Verizon and AT&T or T-Mobile. The best way to visualize this is to look at the graphic supplied in the merger proposal to the FCC. That shows maps for projected T-Mo and Sprint's stand alone company 5G coverage in 2024. While Sprint could claim to cover most of the US population, that coverage is for a small percentage of geographic area. Sprint does not have the money to buy spectrum from DISH and using 3.5 GHz or higher spectra does not fix the imbalance between low and mid-band.While T-Mobile has a way forward to Gigabyte 5G, Sprint does not.What impacts both companies is they each have 12% (s) and 14% (TMUS) of US marketshare compared to about 25% each for Verizon and AT&T. That makes it twice as expensive to deploy 5G on the basis of cost/subscriber."

Jennifer at t-mobile just told me I am on a no credit account. When you open up your account your are never oncredit. Therefore you cannot get paper billing.

State attorneys are joke. There is no proof that merger will increase the price. Everybody knows blue state attorneys are stupid and raise such cases to get attention like a #$%$
"Makan Delrahim, head of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division has given some clarifications about the merger review process that, basically, debunks the Wall Street Journal and other assumptions that the deal is unlikely to be approved. Makan describes that the ATR Div. decision is made as a group that will weigh all factors. That is good because it further confirms that the path the DOJ and FCC have been on is to weigh the pros and cons and the feasibility and motivations of what New T-Mobile has proposed. That is good because 'the basic Physics make sense'. What I mean by that is that the underpinnings of the merger are to take advantage of the combined networks, spectrum and marketshare. The pivotal issue is whether allowing the merger will create a combination of spectra and networks that is fundamentally better than what could be achieved by each individual company or likely partnering they may entertain. The conclusion that looks very obvious is that, yes, it will... it has been a fundamental goal of the technologists working on 4G-Advanced and 5G to take advantage of the ability to use multiple frequency bands in a highly structured yet 'more organic' way. Several years ago many thought leaders among technologists working on advanced signaling and RF methods and the wireless modem leaders, including Qualcomm, Huawei/HiSilicon (yes them), Intel. came to the consensus that the way forward was to hinge on building a unified wired-wireless network and applications platform. A core requirement was to use spectrum more efficiently and adaptively so that operators would make various applications work across different terrains, user density, bandwidth, persistence, etc. The was hardly ignored by AT&T and Verizon. However, they had grown to use their low-mid band for 4G, exhausting the ability to push out 5G. Their timing was 'right for a time' and then wasn't. T-Mobile and other un-Duopolists, seized on the opportunities to assemble a mix of spectrum ahead of 5G. That now provides a springboard to jump into the deep waters of competition against VZ and T but leaves T-Mobile vulnerable a few years down the road: as the demand grows they will exhaust the capacity of their low-mid band unless they merge with Sprint. If they merge with Sprint a different 'physics' is engaged"" the combined use of spectra and network-customer density equates to the better harnessing of the physics of signaling: 5G not just makes use of more bands but uses them as overlay tiers on a best-available basis. That, in turn, lends the network to use the virtualization methods of 5G/5G NR to better advantage. Doing 'network slicing' works better if you have a dynamic allocation of network-spectra to play with.If DOJ does a deep dive job, as Makan indicates, they are almost certain to approve the merger IMO."

"Why is 5G ""for coverage"" rather than for peak outdoor bandwidth performance more impactful? It could be argued that both New T-Mobile's strategy of using much more low and mid-band airwaves, while providing up to six years lead on achieving full (90%) 5G coverage with 100 Mbps bandwidth and AT&T and Verizon's strategy of using very wide channels of high-frequency mmWave bands will result in the same 90% level of coverage in about six years but will have higher bandwidth in the meantime. In other words, these strategies could be viewed as having benefits that roughly cancel each other out.Let's look at the difference: New genre of mobile applications require reaching a threshold of subscriber coverage before it makes sense for developers to come out with new devices and services that can use the capabilities. While bandwidth has been King of mobile metrics in past years, it has become much less of a concern in recent years. What often is perceived as a bandwidth problem is actually a coverage or latency problem: balky video service is often due to fluctuations in bandwith rather than average downlink speed. Balky voice communications, conferencing and many other apps often has nothing to do with the average bandwidth that is often touted but with the consistency of the connections. 5G is not as much about achieving higher bandwidth as achieving more somewhat higher bandwidth on a much more reliable basis while in buildings or on the road. Many of the new fronteirs of applications require highly consistent quality with very low jitter (consistency) and latency (needed for online gaming, real-time social-video sharing, conferencing, interactive events, AI assisted applications (many exciting things in the works).New T-Mobile and DISH will have an open-field advantage to run the ball. This will take more creativity than wireless has experienced over the past twenty years but the opportuities are almost countless."
You guys would be at $80 by now if it was not for the MonsterMerger.
"T-Mobile is among those pushing the FCC to issue rulings for the ease and low cost of smallcells. A major impediment in the USA, (and many other countries), to deploying 5G networks is the high cost of sites for installing smallcells and remote headend cells. The problem is made more complex because of multiple jurisdictions: each city, county and state authority have jurisdiction over their government facilities including street access, light poles, conduit runs and termination points. The record shows that the costs for access can vary from a few hundred dolalrs per location per year to tens of thousands of dollars for initial site permitting and up to thousands of dollars per year thereafter. A similar problem has been effectively dealt with in other countries such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands in Europe and Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore in Asia. While the USA has made more spectrum available than other countries, the difficulties to make use of it remains impeded by the difficulties and costs of building smallcell sites. T-Mobile's submittal for ""Streamlining Deployment of Small Cell Infrastructure By Improving Wireless Facilities Siting Policies"" Shows the work that is being done to help speed and lower cost of depolyments of 5G networks. This is another indicator of the direction T-Mobile and the industry is heading."

Big fall tomorrow this is nationwide outage Churn will be out of the roof
"Just a note, Verizon needs to take out 50B in debt to match T-Mobile's spectrum position. What can T-Mobile do with 50b in debt? Buy back 1/3rd of outstanding shares."

"The latest round of Congressional hearings has nothing new to add to the deliberations of the DOJ and FCC other than the opinions of the newly reconstituted US House. The opinions of members of Congress are important only if new information is discovered or new analysis of the existing data unearths 'new truths' that the FCC and DOJ must then consider. The role of Congress is to pass laws that govern, in this case, the ICT industry. The primary way that is carried out if the Congress establishes administrative departments, the DOJ and FCC. Over the decades Congress has passed laws that govern how the regulatory departments work. Those laws often get tested in courts up to the Supreme Court, which shares a position alongside the President and Congress as one of the three branches of government that 'check and balance' each other. The congressional committees do a lot of grandstanding when 1) the Congress is re-constituted under the leadership of a different party. 2) an issue is of key public debate/concern. In this case, the recent election changed the leadership of the House of Representatives from Republican to Democrat. They must show that they are actively pursuing the interests of the labor and public advocacy groups and others who oppose the deal. However, there is no special power and no new information to impact the decision.The merger is 95% certain to happen. The price, MVNO agreements and other concessions are likely to be pinned down in the process. There could be further concessions that must be made - in other words, it would not be shocking to hear that such is a requirement for approval."
As cocky as verizon is they are about to be forced to make major changes to their business model. Tmobile is gonna be a heavy hitter in the 5G market. This is why ATT wanted to merge with them. I thank the cosmos everyday that merger was shut down.
"T-Mobile introduced the REVVL (tm) OEM'd smartphone that is for sale as low #$%$ per month or $125 outright. This is a new leg of the war to differentiate T-Mobile from competitor's offerings.How can a new Android SmartPhone be a differentiator? Every operator in the world offers multiple top, middle and low-cost Android phones. It looks like differentiator because of the simplified way it is being sold and the comparatively higher mid-range features it offers at a low-end price. The phone features a 13 Mega pixel rear and 5 Mp front camera, 2 GB ram, 32 GB internal storage, and, unique for the price, a fingerprint reader. The phone is mfg by ACL, the parent company of Alcatel. ACL has two other models of the REVLL T2 and REVVL T3 Pro - I couldn't find specs for those devices in a brief search. I can't find a review of the device but the description and pictures look impressive for this price range. I think this will help T-mobile maintain momentum as it comes at a time when people have gotten used to having phones, losing or breaking them, being marveled by the features of premium phones only to see newer models come out that beat theirs within a year. or less. A large segment of the market is willing to keep their devices much longer than a few years ago. That shows that having bleeding edge features is not driving the market as hard as in the past. Some early reports placed the price of the T-Mobile REVVL at $169 and $7/month. TM has dropped that to $125 and $5/month for people with high credit ratings. That might be near the wholesale price level - which looks like a smart move considering that the reduction in customer acquisition costs due to the draw achieved by the low price value proposition will likely offset the discount. It is getting easier to stick your neck out - this is going to be another winning strategy for T-Mobile."
"Sprint's parent company, Softbank is pushing for talks to merge all or part of Sprint into T-Mobile.Regulators would be likely to allow a merger if it provided some assurances the combined company would be pro-competitive. However, the combined spectrum would exceed limits set by prior administrations and would be met with scrutiny by the FCC and pressure from Verizon and AT&T to retain the rules they have been required to live by over the past 20 odd years.A merger would be negative to US job growth: both companies have returned many customer service jobs to the US so that there are not many low-pay service jobs left.The merger would likely be posited as being favorable to increased capital spending. However, that would come as a result of bolstering the balance sheet by cutting back on duplicative employment. There is no way a merger 'creates jobs' as the primary purpose is to achieve economies of scale - job cuts will occur by definition. Could a merger be justified given that Sprint continues to hold about $34 billion in debt and lose money? It would be justified only by cuts of 15-20,000 employees and reduction of a portion of overlapping networks. T-Mobile is more in 'the cats bird seat' than ever: the company is positioned to move forward without merging with any many company while growing into wireless home broadband services. Scale has subsided as an overriding factor compelling TM to merge with Sprint. Merger with a cable company makes more sense but that appears to be off the table as Comcast and Spectrum/Charter have agreed to collaborate while holding off on separate wireless deals. It may be two to 4 years before industry changes put pressures on the cable and mobile companies to further consolidate. The most compelling argument appears to be that unless Softbank sweetens a deal for a merger with Deutsche Telekom's T-mobile, that they ride the wave of market competition to see satellite, cable and Sprint become weaker as they continue to gain wireless marketshare and push into home broadband, business services, and take part in IoT. The greatest factor compelling marketshare growth is staying capital efficient as technology and spectrum are harnessed to force 'survival of the fit'."
