"01:35 PM EST, 12/04/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Anavex Life Sciences (AVXL) said on Wednesday an interim two-year trial data of ANAVEX 2-73 on Alzheimer's Disease showed a significantly lower cognitive decline, compared with the control cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, sending its shares up 12% in afternoon trading.ADNI is a multi-center study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease.""These results confirm the rationale to advance the ANAVEX 2-73 Alzheimer's disease program through the ongoing phase 2b/3 Alzheimer's disease clinical study,"" said CEO Christopher Missling. ""The data also establishes the findings of two further gut microbiota family biomarkers linked to improved response with ANAVEX 2-73.""The interim data from the phase 2a extension study, with Alzheimer's disease patients followed for up to five years, will be presented at the Alzheimer's Disease conference in San Diego, Calif., this week.Price: 2.68, Change: +0.32, Percent Change: +11.78"
"WOW!!!!!!!! I truly believe that if not a cure then this new drug if made affordable could actually be given to every senior over a certain age to act as a ""vacine "" to prevent plaque build-up thus the disease. This could be a daily drug given like cholesterol medicine like lipitor !!!!!!!!!!"
"There is a rumor that Biogen is partnering up with Relief Therapeutics (RLFTF) to distribute RLF-100 in Australia, any one know anything about this?"
FDA voted strongly against? huh.
Sell this now! Lawsuits are mounting and it is a easy strike and BIIB mostly will loose and may have to cough up billions! It is going below 200$!!! And forget about this Alzheimer’s med
Market strong. Stock down why?
We shall see. I don’t believe in the credibility argument. If the FDA believes this is helping a % of the population this will be approved with conditions. They will not outright reject this drug
Better buy PRAN they have a viable Alzheimer drug in trial. It’s popping as we speak
Does anybody knows how many shares are in their buyback program ? .

"I must say it is a total bs on biogen's stock value that it didn't rise much and after earning it still didn't rise much...

This could be of interest here. Biogen currently has one anti synuclein drug BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein) in p2 trials. [The findings showed that PBT434 passed the blood-brain barrier and inhibited the alpha-synuclein protein which when aggregated in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Parkinsonian conditions and is considered an important biologic target for treating these neurodegenerative diseases.]This was just released from a P1 being run by ATHE
we need JOE BIDEN - under Trump the market has been so narrow that the returns of a few skewed the market where most were down..... VOTE JOE
"Amyloid hypothesis is not dead. Aducanumab will be resurrected when anti-neuroinflammatory drugs are combined with it for AD therapy. Amyloid-beta in its precursor form or plaque form induce, or is generated by, inflammation. For memory loss disruption of blood-brain-barrier plays a critical role. This disruption also induces inflammation through infection by leaking virus. Inflammation damages synaptic junctions and even kills neurons. To reverse this process, therapy must include anti-inflammatory drugs and amyloid neutralizer."
Why are they even presenting if there is nothing in the data?
Nice dip I must resist buying now very hard not to add more . Might just go ahead and do it...
Drop below 200 soon!

So far this year they retired about 15 millions shares already. At this pace they will retire about 25% if its shares in two years. Take a look at RH I bought them at $40 and not even three years later they traded at $180 because of shares buying back and earning keeps going up.

"Lots of focus on the drop in Tecfidera sales to the generics but this doesn't factor in the recent approval in China, etc. The generic story seems to be a bit overplayed."
"Won’t drop much, already gave some back from spike.No one knows what’s going to happen, but history says they will have another meeting before approval date in March.That’s why they put approval date out that far.Usual stuff for significant drug reviews.Panic and you’ll make money for someone else."

"In order for BIIB to support their stock price, they need to start paying a dividend. This stock has been in free fall for over a year. Time to stop the decline. They have excess cash on the balance sheet and this is no longer a growth stock."
this is going to be huge.
$300+ this is a big news....
Hate to say it but Biib will hit 200 by Monday. Analysts downgrades are coming and price targets dropping like flies. I just don’t understand why pull the plug when first 2 phase were good. Can’t they work from the point of good trail?
Is it time to buy BIIB now ? Or will still fall tomorrow ?
Obviously someone knows somethingAlzheimer’s trial fail my guess

Buying now
Likely resting at $28 50 this week. No issues. No Dr. Su has the pipeline in order as discussed. Fundamentals right where we want them. $MU still reeling from the Cowen report and looking to avoid 5%-8% drop in 2Q. $SNAP still on high for year and looking stronger. $TSLA the speculative pick with SNAP. Both have exciting leadership.Avoiding more losses in the energy traps. $TVIX crushed. As did $UGAZ.Went in with a buy on $BIIB yesterday at $233. Solid large cap pharma buy with promising pipeline.My little d goes back in the basket today and we are having a late breakfast at Costco!Ring a Ding Ding!!
"There's many reason why BIIB is going down lately. Firstly as Morgan Stanley points it out there won't be buyouts, secondly and the most investors concerning about is a new MS drug that will eating away Biogen MS franchise and thirdly the Biotech sector cannot break out of the doldrums. But for Biogen the next earning report will give a clearer picture how much new drug takes its market share and how much royalty they get and their Spinraza drug sale progress. Biogen gave a great guidance for 2017 earnings which is more than $20 per share and they bested in the first quarter. A lot of Analysts still very bullish about Biogen but few are very skeptical. Next Earnings will clear this up. I think there are a lot of things going for Biogen in the long term (1 to 2 yrs) investors will be very well rewarded."

I'm selling my put at open this this hasn't gone under 200 in 5 years and I don't think it will this is the bottom
"Monday will be very tough day for us investors in BIIB. But, remember Alzheimer’s drug that failed is disappointing. But, BIIB is a extremely strong company with many, many drugs for:Multiple sclerosis Spinal muscular astrophyPlaque psoriasisSupports other drugs like humiraNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, arthritis And many moreIt is an extremely impressive company. Further stock was already from from $374 to $243 in the year before sudden raise from $240s to $350s last week. Monday will still be bad due to Alzheimer’s drug failure. But, should be down 10 or 20%%. "
"Every time I sell, then it goes up , what the hell"
What are good reasons to buy Biogen ?
Is new partnership for AD therapy an admission BIIB is not confident in Aducanumab?
If Alzheimers thing goes well... this will easily scale $400...
Shorters is testing the $226 level
So...how’s that BIIB AD efficacy going!It doesn’t work to even try to solve the AD problem. SAVA...just a hint at the best solution. The Prestigious NIH has funded the development so far. Cassava sciences is an AD company with the best of breed formula. It’s a 15X bagger in the soon making!
Have said for many years the best way to invest in this sector is ETF's just too risky for individual picks.

Best opportunity to buy BIIB before Alzheimer's drug filing or more data from the phase 3 is available .This will be first drug to be approved and the first to be in the line of treatment and can take BIIB to $600 - $700 range .This is going to be the cheapest you can buy .Risk reward is really good .
Are they still having the conference meeting tomorrow?
The BIIB shares price dropped following news that ABBVIE stop testing a drug that treat a rare brain disease called PSP which BIIB also testing a drug that treats the same disease. Hope it recovers and rally with the market.

These companies are not blindly pouring in billions of dollars to IONS drugs, there are clear scientific reasons, they know better than us. Cranium, in his Seeking Alpha article explicitly detailed these, I've posted a number of messages on this board expounding item by item, why IONS approaches are superior."

"What do you guys think Monday stock price will be?. Only a miracle can save us. But 20 or 30% down?. Note BIIB is a strong company with other approved drugs. So, it should not go down all that much. Probably 30 to 60 dollars down?.It will be very painful for me. And 1000s of investors I was naive. But, with 8 votes against and 1 as for, there is no path for FDA to approve this drug. 1. What do ppl. Think on a Monday stock price2. Is there any hope for approval?"
Is there any indication that the meeting will be over before the market closes?....
It's GOOD entry point !
"The share buyback is a foolish waste of the companies cash. Might as well burn the money. BIIB needs growth and could have put that cash to work. 5 billion could have bought one or two smaller companies with established drugs and pipelines. Or BIIB could have taken over a mid cap company for more than 5 billion. If the company was accretive it would have paid for itself if BIIB needed to use debt. Or BIIB could have diluted. In some instances dilution can make sense. If BIIB has the cash flow to repurchase shares why not pay a decent dividend?? At $27 or $28 in 2020 earnings BIIB could easily return cash to shareholders. I bet many of the shares bought back will be given out in stock options for the directors, this is a ploy often used by companies."
The whole company will have to be restructured... Sell now
Unbelievable how badly this performs regardless of its low valuation. I wonder if they paid a dividend if it would help the stock price.
any comments? selling off hard

"Not sure why Biogen is down today? I suppose the investors / traders are putting their $ others areas and figure it's going to be awhile before Biogen gets approval ( within 6 months - could be anytime sooner). So honestly, just my opinion it's a good morning time to start acquiring shares because Biogen is going to do very well. Honestly should be trading so much higher, 350-370 range actually higher. This is going to bring on huge revenue... So acquire now guy you'll be in great shape when goes up to 600"
Buy BIIB because the baby boomers getting old will have more brain diseases. Buy BIIB stock because nowadays more pressure on work and more depressions link to brain diseases. Buy before it rises again.
Nice rebound off the lows. Especially nice given all the ANALysts downgrades.

AMGN should takeover Biogen. How about 1.5 shares of AMGN for 1 share of BIIB. $360. AMGN can easily get the AD drug approved faster than BIIB.
"I'm in a quandary. When BIIB closed at $216.71 on Mar 22nd (based on the Alzheimer drug fail), the stock bounced back to close at $240.28 just 10 trading days later (April 5). So should I wait a week to 10 days to sell at a better price or take my lumps now? Opinions anyone?"
Amyloid plaques is not the root cause of Alzheimer’s. As a recent press release from NIH said mitochandria dysfunction of brain cells due to NAD+ depletion is the root cause. Nicotinamide Riboside (Niagen) supplementation reversed and prevented axon damage. CDXC holds the answer for Alzheimer’s and all age related diseases. As noted by the national Institute of Aging “NAD+ depletion is a fundamental feature of aging”

If this stuff doesn't work they'll cut it in half. Lots of broken promises.
Victim of poor management delivery at ER followed by a lousy cc imo. If these guys just got out of the way the stock would probably soar.
If BIIB fall big on Monday Biogen new 5 billions shares buying back will kick in last 5 billions buying back took 9 months. If the shares buying back continued for next three years they can retire 30 to 40% of outstanding shares plus they just report very positive phase 2 with Lupus drug. FDA will approve AD drug. FDA have their own opinions vs ADCOM opinions and seem like FDA already makes up their mind before they released their comment about the drug before ADCOM meeting. Sleep tight!

I believe Biogen will be smart and buy Regenex bio which has a big stake in Zolgensma drug which cures with gene therapy Spinal Muscular Atrophy that is currently served for $7 Million per patient by Biogen Spinraza. Current market cap. of Regenex bio is only 2 billion and gets big Zolgensma stake and about 130 other other Gene therapy products in development bt Rgegenex bio= RGNX. There is an article on Regenex bio on Barrons weekly magazine on March 4 2019 page 22. Good read

If you alter that ""dosing"" of the recipe it alters it good or bad according to the expertise of the chef. When dosing was adjusted the outcome of aducanumab produced a better recipe and a better outcome. If you look at the massive cost of Alzheimer's you see the aligned need to treat it. SO - to stop a drug that has shown the type of improvement shown in this study is just not feasible or likely in my opinion. And, you are seeing that in the action of the stock with On Balance Volume and the like uplifting.

Sad to see investors lose money in this company but even more disappointing to see the failure in the effort to see progress in the Alzheimer field.
everyone relax -- only dropped 88 pts.
One year chart RSI is 83. I think it is pretty safe to buy now
Only up $1???
Are we at $300 yet?
How long are they going to pump this Alzheimer drug?
Aducanamab does not address pTau
"Regarding the BIIB / Roche news... I can't imagine that had any play today. The press release is kind of misleading on who is to blame, but it kind of points the finger at Roche. Roche blames BIIB. If people though BIIB caused it, this thing would have tanked -50 in its current condition. If people thought Roche did it and the drug would be pulled or something, BIIB would have been up a lot more then +5."
Looks like no one wants to believe them.
Can anyone tell why it dropped $45 in the after hour trading?
I have a friend with serve memory loss problems hope this can help her.
"Biogen Inc.’s experimental Alzheimer’s disease therapy failed to gain support from a panel of U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers on Friday, putting the drug at a crossroads as the agency weighs approval.The outside experts voted 8 to 1, with 2 undecided, that data from a single clinical trial with positive results was insufficient to show Biogen’s drug works. They also voted 10 to 0, with 1 undecided, that the positive study shouldn’t be considered primary proof the drug works in light of conflicting evidence from a different trial.The votes contradict a report FDA reviewers prepared ahead of the meeting that supported the efficacy of the drug, called aducanumab, though there was dissent in the agency. The FDA will continue the review process with a decision by March 7, 2021."
I think BIIB might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awe-someSTOCKS.

"NEWS today! AC Immune to Present at 2018 Society for Neurosciences Meeting... $BIIBUpdate on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Programs Targeting TDP-43*** The first update will cover the wholly-owned TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) antibody program aimed to provide novel therapeutic options for patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). The second update will be on the accompanying diagnostic program focused to deliver positron emission tomography (PET) tracers specific for misfolded and aggregated TDP-43, which is non-exclusively partnered with Biogen Inc.The oral presentation entitled ""Discovery and development of diagnostics and therapeutics for TDP-43 proteinopathies"" includes data on both programs and will be presented on November 4th during the session ""Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies"" (1pm to 3.15 pm, PST; Session #188, in room SDCC 5).AC Immune is developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against pathological forms of the transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Misfolded TDP-43 has been identified as the major component of pathological protein inclusions, in both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). It has been shown that pathological TDP-43 can spread from neuron to neuron as being described for many pathological proteins in neurodegenerative disease. This mechanism creates the opportunity to interfere with the process through application of monoclonal antibodies. AC Immune is using its proprietary SupraAntigenTM technology to raise a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded TDP-43 which are currently undergoing functional evaluation. This program is wholly-owned by AC Immune.Complementary to a therapeutic approach, AC Immune is developing novel PET tracers specifically targeting pathological TDP-43 inclusions. Small molecules suitable for PET tracer development are being derived from AC Immune's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform, which is designed to interact with misfolded and aggregated proteins. Promising small molecule hits have been identified by binding assays using patient -derived TDP-43 aggregates. The ability to precisely diagnose FTLD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies and therefore treat patients earlier and more accurately is critical to disease management that uses novel therapeutic approaches. This collaboration with Biogen Inc. was established in April 2016; it is non-exclusive, and AC Immune retains intellectual property and commercialization rights.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immune-present-2018-society-100115734.html?guccounter=1"

"It is very hard to generate any drug in neuroscience. Nerve system is so complicated that it is normal for most drug candidates fail. However, it also means less competition if a company succeeds in some of them. That is why BIIB is so profiting. BIIB still has lots of potential candidates. It only fails in one but there are still big chance to succeed in other candidates. Obviously the market is over reacted."

The Amyloid-beta-42 hypothesis is alive and well. Removal of amyloid plaques is essential in any AD treatment. A combined treatment of Aducanumab with Amyloid-beta aggregation inhibitors might work better.
"Biogen is probably buying back some of their stock. Yes shorting your own stock for buyback is unethical but it is done. It is only illegal if they get caught. The potential downside is reporting on April 24th. Since the Alzheimer drug fail, they will probably write down the $$$ contributed for R&D for this particular drug. Biogen is still strong and still have a great pipeline. There are going to be drugs that fail. Many drug companies will look into it more and see the facts of the trial. Many drugs that fail for their intended use are re purposed for other needs. Look at the case of Viagra. The drug researcher were looking for a drug to combat hypertension but the side effect shows that it gave men quick ""woodies"" and they made tons of money for Erectile Dysfunction. Pzifer made billions from it. JMHO"
What happens now? Is it submitted with the mixed recommendations?
"No surprise whatsoever, regarding another failed attempt to treat Alzheimer's by targeting beta-amyloid deposits. Wyeth made the same foolish mistake. Beta-amyloid deposits are simply by-products. Targeting them is akin to shooting at deer-droppings to try to put venison on the dinner table. It's foolish and ineffective."

"Lot of companies will have a drug fail. BIIB had its Alzheimer’s drug fail. But, unlike other companies BIIB has many very successful and approved drugs for many diseases that include for diseases like multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Today will not be pretty for someone who bought at $324. But, there is no reason for it to fall below $275"
"It appears that there is a strong back and forth between Biogen and the FDA. I remember submitting scientific papers for publication, and the back and forth on the data. I have PTSD from rewrites!!! Sometimes we'd have to revise 2-3 times. But usually if a paper was going to be rejected they did it on the first time. Like a draw in chess, they see no path to checkmate, or no path to consider the findings valid. From what I read it seems that some complicated ninja moves were made with statistical analysis. So to me the back and forth gives me hope, like the Lloyd Christmas rule: ""So you're saying there's a chance!!!"" I remember AMGN being pushed down before it shot up, and I wonder if this is similar. If there is a novel medication that can treat Alzheimer's disease that would be so amazing for the people and families who suffer with this devastating disease. So I am long, but I'm also rooting for Biogen to make this breakthrough. Caveat this is my opinion and my opinion only!!! I mean, I'm no Jim Cramer. Also, they are getting ready to defend another patent, so I think that is weighing on the stock."

Every tick up in the morning gets sold off. What's with that?
"Some reasons why I think BIIB is a great bet and worthy to throw some money at:#1. Cash-flow positive company.#2. Good short-term liquidities.#3. Can easily service its debt through operating income.#4. Currently undervalued stock according to a conservative DCF analysis.#5. Warren Buffet also bought some BIIB earlier this year.#6. Good growth potential in the untapped Alzheimer’s disease market. I think the bar for aducanumab approval is set relatively low, as no treatment exists right now and the disease burden is huge."
BIIB should move in symphony with Shire today and tomorrow.
No reason for this to be down other than shorts

"BAN2401 vs. AducanumabHow about using some common sense here folks. Now that Eisai's BAN2401 could very well make an Alzheimer’s drug gene (aka ApoE ε4) dependent, where does that leave Biogen's Aducanumab ?? I think Biogen is trying to show Eisai's recent success supports their own theory about Aducanumab (non-gene specific), while Eisai is supporting the conclusion of this recent (10/17) Scientific American article more.Now don't get me wrong, I have been a long and strong Biogen shareholder since before they merged with IDEC, so I wish Biogen all the success in the world!!However at this point I am a wee bit skeptical.

"Standby folks, I just found out that 23 employees at Biogen have been tested positive for the Coronavirus . This will have a big bad downturn on the stock."
No fade yet after all. Helps that the nasdaq is up 1.24%
We’re almost back to where we were before the ER. Nice recovery BIIB!
I say we open at 280.
Tecfidera is the drug at question. Sounds to me like liver function simply needs to be closely monitored by those patients who are susceptible to liver damage. Shorts must've circulated this story!

roche receives an upgrade. their drimug caused a death. go figure
Ms patent ruled against BIIB
BIIB is extremely undervalued
Little down on very low volume. I think the volume will be under 1 million today.
BIIB has reduced its share count by 20% over the past two years and is about to reduce shares by another 10% with the 5 billion dollar buy back(announced today) on a 42 billion dollar market cap.
why is the stock getting hammered
"Thestreet article says the sell off was an overreaction and nothing points to internal issues. Obviously we aren't going up +8 tommorow, but feels like a one day event to me."
"Alzheimer's disease is just a symptom of aging. Similar to all age related diseases, NAD+ depletion is the root cause of all age related diseases."
Classic pump and dumpFDA in the middle
Hahahaha  Degenerate Gamblers got hammered.. live and learn.
"Looks like BIIB is going the wrong way today, or is it the right way? Which way is it gonna go???"
Surprised those recent results didn't kick the stock down 10%+.
outperforming again today. I have a good feeling about Biogen.
"I was long this stock from 2013 to 2015 when it spiked up in a frenzy on alzheimers data being presented at a European conference, it was nonsense I knew but even CNBC was actually cheerleading it that day it closed 475.98, up 10% on the day. I thought it would hold some of that so I didn't sell then and it proceeded to lose that gain in two days. Bad sign. I held to earnings and they were a disappointment and I was lucky to sell my position around 425. Those were their best days as far as I'm concerned. After biotech flamed out in 2015 I wouldn't recommend the sector to anybody except for short term traders or if those lucky to catch a momentum ride like NEKTAR. To much hoping involved and very much headline driven. Remember, Hillary Clinton/Martin Shkreli torpedoed all of biopharma in September 2015 and non of those high flyers like Regeneron, Gilead, Biogen, etc. have since recovered. Biogen buying a company is the same thing they were saying about Gilead back then. Hopium"
"Anavex Life Sciences is hovering around $3/share. Forget about the beta amyloid boat, jump ship, and ride on the mitochondrial homeostasis and sigma receptor train! Cheap ticket for a ride with results."

"startinng to come back; is it possible complete reverse? if so, 400 heres we come. rollercoaster is exciting, to say the least already."
"As I replied to sandi (which message she deleted), although price may drop further, no question this year’s trend will be higher. Company has strong financials; and regarding imminent pipeline drugs, extremely positive company comments can be heard on the Biogen website: Stifel CNS Day. Their Ban2401 AD treatment, now in phase 3 trials, may receive early approval. This company is poised for a 50% pop! ... regardless of aducanumab."
Wow...this just became a $100 billion company.
Meg Terrell.... A few things on Biogen:-Still more votes to go from panel today.-Stock currently halted.-FDA is set to decide on whether to approve the drug by March. It doesn’t have to follow guidance of this outside advisory panel.-Many expect FDA will approve the drug regardless of vote.
"Hoping for $500 Monday, Alzheimer’s drugs are a big deal in medicine"
The question is can BIIB hold on to a gain as Sarepta has shown it's been able to do.
"Biogen Alzheimer's Drug Headed For Unfavorable Vote, Says An Analyst's Mock Panel"
Will this fall below 200 today?
I could see this blowing through 400 easy
what is the timing for Biogen to submit to the FDA for approval on aducanumab and what is a guess and to how long after that the FDA will respond ?
"This stock must be tough to stomach with its volatility, imo. There must be a battle raging between shorties and longs, lol. Just saying. Glad i cant afford to buy it. Even its options are dangerous, lol."

I don't think the liver warning is a big deal. Overdone bs as usual!
"just trying to make it look good. ""plaque"" has been found to be present in healthy brains as well. time and again that has been a dead end for those following that line. You can buy 10 shares of biogen on this hopeful news and pay 3440 plus, or you can buy 1000 of avxl starting their ph. 3 this month for 3440. risk is the same for both, reward is much greater elsewhere.

Amazing news coming out at noon.

"As previously announced, the BAN2401 Phase 2b clinical study results will be presented in an oral session at the 2018 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) on July 25, 2018 at 3:30 p.m. CDT in Chicago, IL, as part of Session DT-01: ""Recent Developments in Therapeutics"" (2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. CDT)."
This new CFO may be a breath of fresh air and it appears he is not afraid of doing a few good acquisitions.
Anyone using a stop limit and at what number?
Talk about catching a falling knife...

"It it wasn't for the general ""risk off"" in equities today, BIIB would be on course for $235/share. I am still heartened that BIIB is down by less than a percent while the NASDAQ is down 1.42%. Still the day is young."
"BIIB conducted two identical P3 studies for aducanumab: Engage and Emerge. Engage failed and Emerge passed. Both studies had low and high dose and the high dose was increased during the studies in both studies. BIIB's argument is that patients in the Emerge study saw higher doses for longer than in Engage. This difference caused Engage to fail. If so, why did the low dose cohort in Engage do better than the high dose cohort? This anomaly was not seen in Emerge. In sum, there are many questions in these studies that are larger than the simple ""higher for longer"" explanation given by BIIB."
"WFC upgraded to OVERWEIGHT, $390!"
Analyst urge caution on this news. I agree AVXL is having better results and in more testing models. Caregivers and patients have requested to stay on medicine TWICE now over 2 years. Stabilty and improvement !
"TIME TO SHORT........ REMEMBER, HOGS GET SLAUGHTERED PEOPLE."
Buying the dip
"Don't know why they increases the number of patients, It is possible that the initial results of ongoing phase 3 show the trend but not strong enough. Give the recent moves of the company taking on the drug, I don't think the trial failed but enough concern has raised"
Advice when you don't want it...….I suffered through this with BMY and Apple...…...just hold and stop watching. It will come back.
"FINALLY FOUND THE NEWS: BIIB discussed the Alzheimer's trial at Leerink conference. They are adding 510 patients due to ""increased variability"". This led to bashing by Adam Fuerstein."

"I can't believe they are giving us another prime opportunity to short again. Short here are $290, and add more shorts for every $5 they pump this."
"I'm going to just stick to the small cap biotechs like $AVEO, from now on. Multiple buyout rumors, a drug that actually works, and oversold from the $3 level to the $0.60ish level. Way more upside potential, even if $BIIB manages to recover. I was hoping for a dead cat bounce on $BIIB, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen. At least not today. Maybe they need to cremate the cat first then put it in a rubber ball or something. WOW! What a day!"
Oversold
How come this company has a PE ratio of 16 ? while Celg has a PE of 40+.
This is a huge 1 day move for this stock. In the past spikes the usual gain is 10% and this looks like it might hold 17+%. The real test comes Monday.

"About a week ago, I had a post ""Make a note today, $400 or so a share in November""."
Still I think this premarket 259 is a steal. Not terribly impressed with their revenues down 25% year over year but looking at the half full glass scenario the Spinraza sales weren't bad and perhaps they will pull a rabbit out of the bag yet.

I don't know where the stock will trade tomorrow or the day after. What I do know is the buyback will prevent any further price depreciation. Nicely done by mngt. 240-250 not unreasonable in the next 30 days.
Why the whupping today? Opened down $4. Don't see any news.
Not buying!! I think 250-240 is a better more fitting price. Buying here is very risky.

Extremely interesting research published on Monday: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0611-3. Commentary on NYTimes about the research and implications: https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-didnt-she-alzheimers-answer-200846677.htmlThe implications of this research is that disruption of APOE interactions with heparin proteoglycans can delay the onset of Alzheimer's. The GreenValley drug is basically a competing proteoglycan sulfate that might be able to disrupt the interaction between APOE4 and HSPG. The could be some basis for the GreenValley drug.The study also firmly establishes that amyloid deposit has nothing to do with AD. It is highly unlikely that Biogen drug will work.

explain to me how the stock is down after that earnings report? I just don't get it.

"This is the most overbought stock in the entire market. The RSI is over 82. The hope is they submit new info to the FDA in early 2020. IF this were to be approved, it would be at the end of the 2020 or 2021. That's a huge if, given the history of this drug."
Short better cover
Sitting right below the 200 dma. Coiled spring
"BAN2401 trial and accumulated Aducanumab data advanced the thesis that amyloid hypothesis is valid. This hypothesis is succinctly defined as shown below by a Nature report. This hypothesis contends that increases in the amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) protein trigger a cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's disease. Under this hypothesis, individual Aβ42 monomers aggregate into damaging oligomers and fibrils in or near Aβ42 plaques. Aβ aggregates cause certain inflammatory responses. Through unknown mechanisms, these events lead to the aggregation, phosphorylation and propagation of tau, a protein that is associated with microtubules (pink and purple) and is the main constituent of harmful tangles. Affected neurons and synapses become dysfunctional and can die, leading to additional inflammatory responses. The progressive dysfunction, degeneration and loss of affected neurons and synapses is associated with cognitive decline, other symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and increasing disability. Sevigny et al.2 report that the Aβ-binding antibody aducanumab binds to, promotes removal and blocks accumulation of fibrils and oligomers. [NATURE, v. 537, p36, 2016]"

"Mr. Market keeps being highly pessimistic about the aducanumab trial results that are expected tomorrow.Having said that, since there are no legitimate (aka FDA recognized) Alzheimer's test(s), that I know of, the results will be subjective at best - good or bad!!"
WHO WAS SHORT??
"Hey Mike - A couple of weeks ago I posted that - I {agree with you 100%. I too ""don't believe the true cause of Alzheimers has been discovered yet."" Biogen's Phase III trial of aducanumab wont be completed until April/May 2020, which will be measuring the the ""slowing cognitive and functional impairment"" via multiple subjective testing.Hoffmann-La Roche also has a Phase III study of their drug crenezumab, which is due to be completed November 2022.Doubt about BAN2401 is on the rise, so we''l have to wait & see IF Biogen decides to spend the money on extended clinical trials (??)So........... even as longtime stock holder, I feel that Biogen is currently an imbalanced risk/reward investment, and continue to gradually reduce my position on short term bounces."
This is like the reaction that NKTR got whey announced their results of 214. Market is very irrational.
why BIIB down today?
Glad I got out of BIIB without losing my shirt. Made very little money on this. I would have gotten killed if I held.
"FYI - From the JPM conference.""CEO Vounatsos told an audience his company took “reasonable” price hikes this year, including increases in line with the consumer price index growth for drugs where Biogen has stopped development. According to a note last week from Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat, the company hiked prices on Plegridy by 2%, Tysabri by 3.5% and Tecfidera by 6%. Also,Vounatsos said Biogen’s spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza generated $1.6 billion in sales in the last 12 months, and that the company has secured reimbursement deals for the drug in 30 countries. Even with the Spinraza launch success, the helmsman said he welcomes new competition in SMA, including gene therapy, as competition benefits patients."""

Few weeks ago some hedge fund try to buy from anyone for $216 and since BIIB went up Like 6% I think those guys see bigger returns for BIIB in the near future or a little bit longer. They are still working on with their partner EISAN ( Japanese Firm) on ALZ diseases and few of theirs drug in second phase like stroke etc. if any of those drugs come up with any positive data that will give BIIB a life and then you will see $300+ again because they are all blocks buster drugs especially in neurological disease.

"Termination of AZ drug program by pfz is actually a very positive sign for Biogen's Aducanumab. Programs of Gamma secretase which pfz targeted can go nowhere. The mechanism based toxicity eliminates its possibility to be a drug target. Breakthrough has been made in AD drug in the recent two years led by Biogen's Aducanumab. But it is not known by general public including most medical writers. General perception is still that AD drug is hopeless. Most of recently failed drugs are predictable if you know the area. For example, Axon is a scam in the 1st place. The chance for a 3-times failed drug re-discovered by a hedge manager is zero. Unfortunately most of investors have no clue about the science of AD drug discovery. Their poured money into this junk and get nothing back"
Wait until at least 11 a.m. eastern standard time
This stock seems pretty cheap to me.
Shock has nothing in the pipeline will go lower in the coming weeks. looking at 125 a share.
"This patent ruling was not expected. Maybe Biogen will win the appeal but it is going to take another year or more. If they lose the appeal, then they will lose market share to all other competitors. Assuming they will lose 25% market share, this would translates into a revenue drop by less than $1 billion a year which could represent 7% drop of the company's revenues."
They initiated their 5 bil buyback program
what is going on today with BIIB
"Here is an example of what we can do at Churchill Swartz, we don't really care if a company beat earnings or not, we just manipulate the stock to our advantage, just look at (BIIB ) earnings beat, you name it,(BIIB ) met and exceed all analyst expectation and we still drive the shares down, Bam, Bam, Boom."
"wow, a lot of volume in this last minute of trade."
This smells like a good dose of bogus news to me!
Short trap being corraled?
Haters ABOUND on Wall Street!
Biogen management incompetence Charitable description at best
go up 30% will be nice
#$%$ kickback company
Can BIIB afford to pay a dividend? I think that would help with the volatility we are seeing with the stock price.
No other company has anything close the effectiveness of this drug. So the question is: What is an approval worth to BIIB stock price?
Just saw earnings on Seeking Alpha tomorrow morning Thursday. Good luck to all longs
April 26 (Reuters) - Nightstar Therapeutics PLC : * LEADING PROXY ADVISORY FIRMS ISS AND GLASS LEWIS RECOMMENDNIGHTSTAR SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY BIOGEN
"When will the detailed results for BAN2401, the company's Alzheimer's drug be released?"
A 10% chance of a miss on estimates with Q2 being one of their strongest qtrs (history). I'm in.
"Well, 60% of revenue will disappear in next 2 years because of generic drug by BMY. When BIIB finds a replacement then it will be interesting."
"...Kulkarni wrote that experts' views are mixed on whether the FDA will approve the drug, called aducanumab. But he wrote that even skeptics seem to think the drug as a ""decent shot,"" and that that isn't reflected in the stock's share price.""This stock call is based less on an opinion about the merits (or lack thereof) of the science/data,"" he wrote. ""We cannot, however, underestimate investors' fear of missing out on the potential to get ahead of what might be an approval for the first ever disease-altering therapy for Alzheimer's.""Kulkarni upgraded Biogen to Buy from Hold, and set a price target of $360, up from $305."
Great day for BIIB longs! $400 is coming..................
Biogen is dead...
BIIB is up 6.65% to 300.45
"Not sure why the stock isn’t moving upwards? Biogen crushed earnings... Biogen is appealing the decision for MS drug won by Mylan, which Biogen issued an injunction against Mylan prohibiting Mylan from selling any drug for MS. This appeal will take awhile, though Biogen should win this appeal, it was inaccurately decided by the WV judge...As for Biogen drug for Alzheimer’s, Aducanamub, this had significant impact on the patients using this drug. Patient experienced better way of life for living, it also slows the process of Alzheimer’s.... I truest believe this will get accepted by the FDA... There are millions of people suffering from this disease. The world needs Biogen to help a low the process of Alzheimer’s in people... Also Biogen built the processing plant to manufacture this drug in Sweeden, strong indications that Biogen feels really good about getting this approved, otherwise wouldn’t have brought the application forward...Just don’t understand the street, why people aren’t gobbling up the stock? At least Biogen is buying back shares , another strong indication"

I see this going down to $180s then I am in. hard to catch a falling knife
"IMO - The interview of Michel Vounatsos, the new CEO, with Erik Schatzker at the JP Morgan Health Care Conference made Michel's answers to Erik's questions sound to me like typical DC ""political speak"".Thoughts please.................."
"Suppose you are a long at $320 ps. What do you do now? If the margin clerk calls, you must take care of that first. There are not many antidotes to down 30%. If you sell covered calls, you may get back half over a year's time. Some may sell now and get on a horse that is going north. I see BIIB going nowhere for a long time."
Random buyers buying on low p/e. That is it.
See all the insiders that sold on 2/15/2019 and 2/22/2019??? lock them up...
I'll give you a pipeline. 6 years of gains blown overnight.
WHY down 5%?
now you know why were up. riches drug caused a death. biib sales to rocket.
YES THREE HUNDRED IS NOT FAR AWAY AND EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN VERY SOON WHY?
Afraid it will keep falling
Lost confidence from wall street. No new drugs on the pipeline. A lot of other better companies. Bad management.This will go down to $150 next time market corrects
Buy bcli. Save time and money for als.
Bios indexes broke through support and made a new 3 month low. And not by a few pennies. Both are down roughly -$2 below support levels that we've bounced off *5 TIMES* recently.

"3000 contracts were bought for 2/21/20 $400 Call yesterday and stock is moving higher this morning.This is gong back up to $370 folks, and when NDA news breaks, which is any day now, it will go past $400!!!"
Do we see four hundred ????????????????? possibly
Holy Moly. Ganip Canoli ! 28 percent down!
Debit 5.9B for what?
"who trades this bs in premarket all the time. someone bought 3 bucks higher. if i check nasdaq, i bet its like 1 share."
Wait and buy it below $300 Its coming
All the analysts must feel pretty confident about the FDA approval or they wouldn’t be raising their targets.
Why is this down so much?? Isn't it cheap enough!!
"What, another positive day? BIIB must have nothing going on for it to jump like this."
"I didn't see Renal Cell cancer research on BIIB pipeline? AVEO has Tivo for Renal Cell Ca, Recommended for Approval in the EU. Heading for $4. Once it's Approved...? $8+ Approval date getting close, end of Aug."
I believe that the price will be affected by the phase 3 studies. The Phase 2 studies doesn't really prove anything until they actually complete phase 3. the reaction is very irrational. let's see what happens tomorrow
245-260 range
Cramer said don't buy Moderna when it was around $65... I bought it and it went up $95...Cramer is a joke. Do the opposite as he said.. Buy biogen.
"I do not believe on this news as a solution for Alzheimer’s treatment. I had read side effects and serious health development is at risk on taking this drug. . Maybe the few patients who had stand the trial associated with other health conditions developed during trial IMO , this drug won’t succeed in the market. Very few people will be available to take the drug once side effects must be explained to family member ."
Pfizer is going to buy Biogen for 95 billion dollars. Cover your shorts position before it too late. I would buy a lot more here if I am a fund manager or I have the money. It’s absolutely on sale
"I read Biogen hasdrug only the second patent on Tecfidera. The company i Denmark Forward Pharma or FWP symbol has the primary senior patent on the FP187 or Tecfidera . Biogen lost court case last week and must pay Forward $1,25 Billion USD settlement. Biogen will also owe between 10-20% future royalties to Forward Pharma. Since FWP sells for $30 a share or market cap $1.3 Billion, it would be very prudent if Biogen bought FWP for premium. This way Biogen recoups their own cash settlement of $1.25 Billion, would own the primary patent on Tecfidear, and would not have to pay any royalties to FWP on Tecfidera in future. This would save Biogen alot of overhang on stock. Look it up BIIB holders"
NTRP is the next AD solution
How long will this be halted? They can’t do this for the whole day can they?
Approval of Adu => $600.
BIIB's market cap is the lowest its been since January 2013. Even though the stock price is much higher market cap is lower due to all of the buybacks they've been doing.
Democratic govt will hit it harder and demand drug price cuts on lucrative market at present! They may end up loosing about 10billion+|- with all this mess!!! So it may drag down to 150-175$ as well!!!
"Bio gen below $230is a good buy. Bought more before the close at $229.75. With a current PE around 10 and a forward PE below 8, the risk factor is low. BIIB still have a strong pipe line moving forward. Great people at the helm."
Remember that 60 Minutes segment where the lady neurologist said she started practicing medicine a third of a century ago. She had nothing fir Alzheimer's patients then and she still has nothing.
"What will be the next BIIB? You buy and hold , 20-30 ys later you get 1000 times your initial investment."
Not much reaction in ah
10 P/E buy buy buy
When will this hit $355 again
"This is the key phrase, to me at least. From the article about Biogen from Yahoo Finance. It said:“Biogen said after discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the agency encouraged it to file for approval.”That statement is why I invented in Biogen. Hopefully it is accurate and not fake news."
BIIB likely will get out of Alzheimer's drug business altogther after this. Second time it has taken a jolly shellacking in less than 2 years.
Is BIIB buying out ARRY
there was a big reaction to dropping the trials of that drug. those trials being dropped will bring money back to the bottom line overall unless reinvested. the hope premium on the stock for that drug should be gone i think the earnings premium will make this a buy here and there will be more good news out of BIIB with their robust financial data. this is on sale.
Still reacting to the downgrades or is there something else brewing?
"Sell this while you can!!! Revenue growth only miserly 6% and cash on hand few billions only!!! To make PEG close to 1, it may go down to 100$ and won’t be a surprise !"
"New hedge funds have added BIIB in the last 2 days , stock is on big discount now ,"
"This stock needs to pay a dividend so more funds can have it in their portfolio, and so there is a reason to hold even when it's down."
"Sell this ASAP. No cure, just a buzz!!! Take profit before it tanks!!"
What is the stock worth w/o Aducanumab? This is still a great biotech with or without it.
Prpo has good volume lately.good news all year.look
who paid 5 bucks over yesterday's close?
Only thing I can figure is that NVS is getting approval on competitive MS drugs. BIIB really does need to step up to the plate. Management has been too complacent perhaps.
"All the press releases are hillarious: ""another top executive bolts"", ""another top exec jumps ship""... headlines are making this out to be a huge thing... Only thing that sucks is that it wiped out our gains from the last few weeks. Hopefully $252 will hold. $250 should hold. -$9+ seems over done."
"Duh - did anyone really believe a drug that required IV, symptom of brain swelling, and near-0 efficacy would really get past this phase? Check AVXL - real promise there!"
Now GSK signed a deal with VIR for the same antibody platform. Are they competing with BIIB or collaborating?
It looks like the results are good from the presentation. This should spike higher.
Why? This should be up. The share price for this stock is so underperform. Biogen earns lots of money but how come wall street don’t recognize it??? It makes 64x-100x times more money than tsla..
Like neuroscience look at bcli
Stifel CNS Day conference worth a listen. Sage venture very significant. Biib pipeline very +
What's wrong with this?????
This became a casino stock because of the Alzheimer...
"Compare to closing pps of last Friday, Recover $16. Not bad, keep going!"
BIIB: what happens today?. Will it be good news or bad news?. Any guesses. Where will good news take it and where will bad news take it?
Good buy...
"The Fed has moved to a steady and predictable no-harm place. Trade with China will keep our volatility offsetting out current policy. AMD will fare much better than most given its independence from China and target of ~$35 is very reasonable. $INTC and $MU have 6-month charts that suggest they will be lucky to post a -15-20% loss in 2019. MU's divestiture plans are intriguing.$SNAP continues it's excellent 2019. Evan's leadership applauded in tech. $TSLA has moved from a buy on dips and hold to WATCH. Cash inflows needed and while still a speculative play in the portfolio, there are signs.My friends in energy are really struggling as I watch on the sidelines for a bit. $TVIX has ruined marriages. $BIIB is steady and still a positive buy. $CRMD is the antithesis I'm afraid.Not afraid of a slice and soda for $3.58 with my little d today!

"any beat and we're over 280 in premarket. also, with the spinoff, we can get bought out"
This drug won't be approved for another year... wait until then
"$278 is support. If we pop below this on a closing basis, we then engage the 200 DMA at $255. We must visit this number to confirm the bottom and to then start the uptrend."
"BAN2401 is the first study so far with an effect of treatment and a size large enough to make subgroup analysis meaningful. When these analyses have been completed we will be able to evaluate possible differences between APOE4+ and APOE4-. As approximately 70 percent of patients in this clinical study, and other clinical studies, are APOE4+, effect of the treatment should not deviate from the total result in a great manner."
"I'll bet that wealthy money that's dumping tech....went right to work here. It's convenient it was so cheap for them. Miraculously it was fast tracked, after being slammed in the mud by several wall Street firms because of a questionable patent issue. But it opened an easy avenue for sure thing affluent money. Money for nothing...chicks for free. Remember Dire Straits.....you get the true meaning of this tune, when you watch the shenanigans on Wall Street. Most of this wall street money, never really worked a hard day in their life. Unless you think coming up with ""no lose"" schemes hard work??"
here we go again with the premarket bs.
SOS we should be soaring after the big selloff
This is a bit of overdone
Dead Cat Bounce - JMHO
"This is not the first time this has happened to BIIB, this would be the third time since the 1990's. It always comes back and goes higher."
I just read for the first time that BIIB's aducanumab is administered by IVThat means it’s very expensive for Medicare & insurance companies and very inconvenient for the patient. Not only does it not work and is dangerous (brain bleeding); it has to be administered by an IV...
this is bouncing back big after hours. Up 1 cent. At this rate it recover its loss in 26 years
Wow time to MUTE ALL the SHORTS again and their multiple I.D'.
how long does it take for the buy back to finish ? over a week ? month? days?
Paper gain for longs..this will see $220The analyst seems very confident. You can sell at $220 don't sell now
"If smart traders bet heavily on bullish call tomorrow, others should do the same"
Now that I've looked at the 2 year chart for this I reiterate my statement below that this and all biotechs should be traded and not held long term. Keep on top of it. This isn't Home Depot stock.
"Now they have hope, I see light in the tunnel"
Everybody is talking about how bio Jen has the solution first ever for treating Alzheimer’s... No sadly they have no solution whatsoever except propaganda and a lot of capital of spend on that propaganda. Cassava sciences has the only real proven affectively solution to treat this terrible disease. Use your brain and buy cassava sciences SAVA. BioJen lost 20 billion in market cap when they simply let the market know that they were dropping their lame attempt at treating this deadly disease. Now there are other candidates are failing to and pants are being question jump ship and put all your money into cassava sciences PTIE-125. That’s where the true treatment lies at...
BIIB reached a 52 Week high at 342.00
This is what one would call a 'good ole' fashion whoppin'....new 'fresh' 52 week low.
Here is the link to the contents and timing of Biogen's presentations on their Alzheimer’s Disease efforts at the (CTAD) Meetings over the next few days. The reaction to these presentations via the stock price should be very interesting to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!http://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-present-data-alzheimers-disease-portfolio-2018-clinical
Filling the gap
"watch the partner's stock, I believe it trades."
sell now and ask questions later
That is why I hate biotech!
Out of favor sure. Dead? No way. Great value here. They will pivot and come back in favor. Good conference call. Bullish
"I happen to be ultra focused on cognition as a scientist. I own SAVA and the last few weeks have been glorious. Yet, there is a lot of runway before SAVA's drug clears phase 3 and SAVA relative to BIIB can in some ways be higher risk pharma with limited pipeline drugs. That left me wondering what the board thinks are the chances of approval for high dose aducanamaub for AD? Hoping the odds are good that re-analysis gives different, I tip-toed into BIIB for a very tiny position (12 whole shares!). I wish I had more liver but I honestly don't know how much difference this drug would make for a company with many drug candidates. I was just wondering what those that have been following this closely company think."
whooz yor daddy - Are you going to stop whining now???
Gotta stay in this name. Too much good news in their pipeline not to hold some shares despite all the constant FUD!
Sure biogen gives our money $10 million to bank just because
"Correction is over, will resume up trend next week, time to buy more"
"I've never heard of Plegridy until today. I thought Abacab (sp?) is the only one awaiting approval, since that's all I've been able to read about. Does Biogen have other drugs waiting to be approved, too?"
"Moderna's mRNA technology will make biotech companies, like Amgen, Biogen, and Genentech down in future. better exit now than later"
BIIB strikes again... My 2nd most profitable stock over the years.... Now comes the hard part... when to sell ????
Is PFE making a bid for BIIB ?
"Turned my back on this one for a bit, and whoa!! 100 pt drop?? Guess I'll buy more after BIVV settles."
should I sell and take profits??
BIIB is down 5.41% to 278.33
Just got a dope alert from (http://stocktip.xyz)
"As you've seen on the news, BIIB licensed to take over research from Mass Eye and Ear for people with a blinding disease tied to gene PRPF31. I'm one of those people. So far I haven't been able to find any timing regarding when a clinical trial might start or how to be considered as a participant. If anyone can help, please reply."
"Is this company not better then what celgene was. If that gobbled up for 80 bill, why wouldnt some big pharma gobble this for 55 or 60 or 70 billion. they have good profilts of over 5.5 bill a yr. Of course there are headwinds but do they really not have anything else in their pipeline."
Recovery possible??????????? TA PEOPLE???
"Seems still not open for trade...""Can't place order: This security is temporarily halted by the exchange and no new orders are being accepted at this time. Please try again once the halt has been lifted."""
What we got boys and girls is gridlock much like the U.S. Congress!
"I hope you guys understand that the outside advisers voted NO mainly in retaliation because FDA had already decided to approve the drug before the meeting, without consulting them first."
Come to ptla
A good value at this price
oink-oink my good man.
when will start trading again?
A lot of upgrade to follow starting tomorrow
Shorts taking cover. Not a pretty sight. 
ooppppps. profit taking cutting into price. was thinking 400; now ??????will we whiplash right back over 380 by weeks end? not easy to discern.
You must be insane to hold this stock
Quite a range here today. There is no doubt this stock will soon close the gap to 320.59.
All good folks
"Truong Et Al - I am of the opinion that today's ~ 4% drop in the pps is direct response to Vounatsos's wishy-washy answer to the M&A question. I have posted on this mb several times times that the Business Model of raising drug prices & doing share buy backs in order to make the EPS look good, is NOT sustainable in the long run - especially with so many other competitors coming up with new MS drugs.Regarding Aducanumab, without some additional M&A, IMO it makes this $69 billion market cap biotech look like a ""one-hit-wonder"" start-up.PS - Considering the number of already hired ""heavy-hitters"" ($$$$) that were recently hired, plus the current # of open positions (from their website) gives me the impression that when Vounatsos became CEO, he has approached Biogen like a turnaround company. All JMHO of course.................PPS - I am currently long with a very low cost basis, but NOT a happy camper!!"
Halted. Buying AMRN
"IGXT's Montelukast is the last remaining hope for Alzheimers so all eyes will be on the Phase II lab results starting in early 2017. BIIB may still have Alzheimers success, however, LLY lab shortfall as casted some doubt and AVXL is working on Alzheimers as well, however, that treatment if proven effective, only slows Alzheimer's progress and doesn't stop or reverse it. IGXT's Montelukast has shown to reverse the progression of Alzheimers. Although Phase II is just starting Phase I showed very positive results as illustrated in IGXT's last presentation. In just 2 months of taking IGXT's VersaFilm Montelukast the patients's memory went from moderate to severe dementia down to mild dementia. The upcoming Phase II will prove this using a bigger sample group. IGXT does not contain the binary risk that AVXL has in that it isn't relying on just 1 drug for it's existance. IGXT has 8-10 other drugs in it's pipeline. IGXT is also currently profitable and continues to fly under the radar with only a $45M market cap."
Does anyone remember Elan's promising rise with their Alzheimer's drug and the subsequent fall? Hope BIIB is successful but beware.
Glad I sold Biib at $421/sh....I thugh this was overbought
"At the rate it's dropping, this might be a good long opportunity in the not too distant future; keeping an eye on it."
Short signal failed and the buy signal is generated.
"this is cheap rn get in while you can, $9 per share earnings, this is going to explode tomorrow."
Look at Williams%R - at max oversold here. Watch ON BALANCE VOLUME to get a cue on return of money to the stock. Biogen is wounded not dead and will be a long term winner.....PAY-TIENCE PAYS. FOOLISHNESS IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO STRENGTH. Boolean
Great report imo and very fairly valued
Buyout $AMRN and $BIIB will jump to $400 again
A cure for Alzheiimies. Yeah right.
Won't the shorts cover by the close ??
Sava does not compare to biogen
Buying here!
"Done deal. Biogen today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Michel Vounatsos as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, effective January 6, 2017. Vounatsos previously held the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Biogen."
They are officially the most undervalued biotech stock in the world at this price
Premarket manipulation on BIIB again? unreasonable pricing.
Wooow $TSLA shorts lost $2.8B Boooyah $AMRN shorts your next hallelujah $ ALLK $ACAD $SGEN $BIIB $AZN really amazing

Biogen $BIIB and Ginkgo Bioworks $SRNG $DNA announce collaboration partnership to develop Novel Gene Therapy Manufacturing Platform.
"The P3 data analysis by BIIB is not as complicated as some say. I wonder they truly studied BIIB's analysis of P3 (Emerge & Engage). Simply put, the data from the participants who got Adu at a high dose for a sufficient amount of time clearly show that Adu is efficacious. Only issue is that such an analysis is not a GOLD standard in GLP. But considering unmet demand, I think, Adu will be probably approved by the FDA despite a split decision by ADCOM. The agency granted Priority Review w/o Vouch only a month after Biogen submitted the application. It is unprecedented. Furthermore, the regulatory agency also said they are planning to expedite the review process further if possible. This clearly shows the FDA is willing to approve Adu with imperfect clinical data. In my previous life, I have been successfully involved in commercializing several drugs. And I am confident of my prediction: > 75% approval chances!"
Biib could buy out RGNX that has market cap of 2 billion. Also RGNX gets huge royalties for Zolgensma which cures SMA and is the cure for SMA while Spinraza only treats symptoms.Terrific synergies here
"Ever notice that when BIIB announces and crushes it, the stock market is in free fall decline. BIIB should be up some $20 today."
"Gonna go down more. Phase 2 hype. 12 Billions,, Crazy 'investors'. Nuff said!"
I have a call option expiring today. How will the halt affect this? I wanted to exercise the option today as it is deep in the money
There is a new Bloomberg article on biogen-analysts-brace-for-collapse-after-alzheimer-s-panel-blow . I am not able to post the link here but you can search on Google . These analysts were talking the other way and increasing price targets just couple of days ago.

What would be the buyout price of this baby? Strong buyyyyyyyyyyy...
Well I sold almost all my shares today. This company goes nowhere for years.
What is liklihood of FDA waffling on the Adicanumab BLA in favor of rubber-stamping an ADCOM's positive vote for recommedation? I am thinking that would mean approval in about 10 months.
This is my last ditch effort in holding this into earnings. This has been nothing but one big exercise in shareholder patience!
Only True Alzheimers stock with real results is AVXL. Stabilizing or improving patients over 2 years now. Caregivers demanded the drug for more time since it works !
The treatment seems to work in the beginning stage of alzheimer so it will not be a total rejection.
Tip of selloff here. This will continue for days.
"p/e is still below 11, this should trade closer to 15 p/e after today, and possibly 30 plus p/e with FDA approval of alzheimer drug. For now we should have a new bottom forming with resistance at 370, till we here from FDA"
"Buying these cheap shares, this is great!"
"Hello again, Anybody at home?"
Just like split decision between FDA and the panel. It’s up to FDA decision to approve this drug.It’s still have a good chance going forward.
It's crazy how much $ I lost out on. I sold 300 shares a couple weeks ago at 255!
"Buying put will NOT payoff, BIIB deserve this price just based on earning alone."
"All the easy diseases to cure have already been cured. What you now have are treatments that companies are ""hopeful"" about that they are ""strongly encouraged about"". Then they are put to the test and they don't work and investors are wiped out. These are problems that are best tackled by governments on an international basis."
We should know by September 8th if the FDA accepts their application for review and if it will be given priority review status. https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-completes-submission-biologics-license-application-fda
A must read for all Biogen investors. Just the facts ma’am...https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/is-cassava-sciences-stock-a-buy/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immunes-candidate-fails-alzheimers-143502372.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/cassava-sciences-announces-lead-drug-121500656.html
21 million shares are retired by shares buyback with just $5 billion that they plan in the past and they should double up at this price so almost a third of outstanding shares will be retired for $10 billions and that’s a smart move with at least $400 millions savings from stopping this early instead of continuing till 2020. They will earn more than $25 a shares this year plus if they buying back all those shares you can see $33 to $35 a shares. Take a look at Autozone how much they bought back and look at its chart and see how its performing. Fantastic. Sad day for investors and endless pain to all those patients with ALZ diseases. Finally C’est La Vie! Good luck to all Biogen’s investors hope you will recover soon.

Eyes on BIIB and AVXL
all biotechs are scam.
3000 contracts were bought for 2/21/20 $400 Call todayObviously in the anticipation of NDA filing for their Alzheimer drug. Any day now.... Stock will hit new high!
"I didn't get my $216 today - close though. Will set up shop at $210 on Monday (Low estimate of recent downgrades). If I don't get it, I'll start buying at end of day and rest of the week. I see $235 tested again in the next 2-3 weeks. Depending on the news (assuming good), it will go gap hunting between $235 and $250..."
I think the Refinitiv/Verus downgrade to sell yesterday had much to do with the selloff today. This used to be Thomson Reuters which was the “go to” for analysis and recommendations.
"Drug Manufacturers average PE Ratio range 18-23, BiiB only at 10.7 is very low. Buy back program plus low PE, going back up to $330 level not a issue. $400 level possible, if successful product available."
AVXL wins
Imo. AVXL has a better AD drug and will present PDD data Friday at CTAD
Out @ 290. Good luck longs.
"Glad I'm held my 7,000 shares while all you shorts bashedHope you had your steel plate in the back of your pants today."
Looking at the 1 year chart... I don't think you can make any predictions. It's been all over the place even from late January to today.
"Hey, short ladies, please bring it down to $100 so I can buy."
"What’s going with Biib? Anyone buying at these prices. I liked it at 280, love it at 269..( 550 shares today)...I think the company will beat expectations just barely, though the stock won’t move much...I do believe the FDA will be positive on the Aducamaub drug, though might want more research which the stock price could go either way + / -....I think this meeting 11/6 is going to be a good indication for the drug outlook....I honestly don’t know why this stock isn’t valued at $350 per share.... with a PE if 8 ( unheard of) ....consistently bringing in top revenue beating expectations....company is consistently buying back shares... I believe analyst are pushing down the stock to continue buying more....just alone on revenue / profit.. without aducamaub drug and many other drugs in pipeline this should be a much higher valued stock...350...Don’t listen to these knuckleheads called “ analysts” they’re young spoiled kids sitting behind a desk haven’t got a clue about how to evaluate a stock price.....I wish I could be in front of these analysts who have low expectations for Biib, “I would tell them to quit and have some respect for themselves instead of misleading people.”The company Biogen, is solid, believes / invest in itself..that says a lot......stay long you’ll be rewarded when it goes to 600+"
"Still saying the shake-up in BIIB management is not coincidental, new talent is coming in. I smell something is definitely in the making!"
"Bought some today, the price looks good to me and health care should be immune to most of the trade issues....unfortunately not the elections."
Sad day for Biogen and people with Alzheimer. Knew this was coming a few years ago when chief guy left.
TSRO is weighing in.
"This is an excerpt in a Barrons article regarding the Mylan patent dispute with Biogen ...Mizuho’s Salim Syed reiterated a Buy rating and $427 price target on the stock, writing that while the development presents risks, and historical IPR data indicates Biogen has probably a 31% chance of losing the patent protection, in reality that figure could be much lower for two reasons. First, there’s the fact that Tecfidera has already triumphed in past intellectual-property litigation, and secondly, as the petitioner, the onus is on Mylan to win all of the 20 claims related to this dispute; Biogen needs only to win one claim to be successful."
"All you BIOGEN long’s of course know that they’re AD drug will never be approved, it does not even work!Cassava science just released their 2b results which are unheard of ever before with any treatment in the field of AD...If you’re in Biogen for their AD product you’ll be disappointed. Buy SAVA while its still dirt cheap...Look at these results!https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/f7e26ba8-7e56-4ff5-8bc1-fe1614fa4eba"
Biib will back to $400 soon!!!!
Are you guys part of (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)? They just talked about (BIIB).
Trading halted?
"Guys, Monday thoughts? Best case : 280-300, most probable : 260-280, worst case : 240-260Give or take +- 10 pts on each rangeAlso, fda might get overhauled with Biden administration. Current FDA are bullish but in March?"
"Hello, anyone home?"
"We are human and we cannot predict the future. Believe me if any of you can predict the market moving as a whole or individual stock which way is heading you would be a trillionaire because stock market is a place you can make trillions without dealing with regulation, monopoly. By the way Warren Buffet also own a chunk of BIIB hopefully he is right on this one (long term)."
What is going on with BIIB this last week? Is this all about the election? It would seem this should be an exciting time for BIIB.
12 analysts provided their opinions yesterday:Average new target: $268.91High target: $325Low target: $230Recommendations: 3 Buys and 9 holdsSource: Tip RanksPotential gain: 18% from yesterday's closeI will start nibbling today but will add more on Mon and Tue to scale in.
A biotechnology firm that actually makes profit with a pe of 8. Ohh mr market thank you for your generousity 
Tracking nicely for week ending 28.50 but eye on our $35 by 4Q. Analysis supports. Dr. Su has fundamentals secure. $INTC steady. $MU lifted by the stronger performers in the sector. Turnaround plan needed.$SNAP continues to rise with exciting new targets established in high teens. $TSLA speculative play holds. $TVIX a loser every day. $BIIB will be a hold through 3rd Q for me.I'll be holding a hot dog and soda by noon today with my little d. $3.58 !Ring a Ding Ding!!

"(Bloomberg) -- Biogen Inc.’s experimental Alzheimer’s disease therapy failed to gain support from a panel of U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers on Friday, putting the drug at a crossroads as the agency weighs approval.The outside experts voted 8 to 1, with 2 undecided, that data from a single clinical trial with positive results was insufficient to show Biogen’s drug works. The vote contradicts a report FDA reviewers prepared ahead of the meeting that supported the efficacy of the drug, called aducanumab, though there was dissent in the agency."
Will we $300 today?
sold quite a few years ago @$85.thinking of buying in again.any advise...
"Where's all the SAVA pumpers today. How's SAVA doing, lol."
400 in one month------------------------------
"remember too, our product is multi purposed, a CNS artery product, multi applications, so this if anything a major understatement. Think the first penicillin. Fighting numerous strains of infections, a best analog$AVXLWatchthosestocks10m$AVXL Look how this compares to $BIIB ----""Statistically significant dose-dependent (p = 0.003) improvement of Episodic Memory, which has been shown to be highly correlated (70%) with the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive score (ADAS-Cog; r = 0.7).""AVXL is ready to be the first and only Alzheimer's drug in an untouched 100 billion dollar market"
Does anyone know when this stock will open?
ABT is down after beating and raised guidance. Go figure!
"One possibility is that the patients are all at very early stage. The window for the drug to show effectiveness is very small. Increase sample size will increase stats significance. This is one of the most anticipated trials of all time. The stake is huge for the company as well as patients. If it failed, we won't see AD drug in the next 20 years. Hope it works."
"BIIB ought to climb to 260 in one month. Yesterday BIIB had a very strong day, some money was in. Those who bought yesterday are cashing their profit now. That should last 1 or days, then BIIB will slowly climb up to 260. The value is there."
"BIIB is one of the larger bio-techs with over 7K employees.So, there are a multitude of programs going on.So, how does one determine if this is anappropriate time to take a position?Since these are not PE reliant stocks,what parameters or metrics does one rely on?The two I find worthwhile are:1)momentum;2) analyst sentiment.Unfortunately, BIIB fails in both categories.I would place REGN and INCY in similar categories.Eventually the shares might regain stability.But for now, I would avoid BIIB.nt"
How much cash does this company have?
BCLI is the stock to watch for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Small Israeli company with trials in the US.
91% owned by institutions. Wait til the bell rings. This is going under 200.
"About 2000 options of 07/20 $370 calls were sold today. Looks like free money to me, some 3 quarters of a million US in God We trust. Wealth created by the noise of a Phase 2. A PHASE 2!!"
When CEO is fired this will plunge another 20%! 15x average volume.. zthis is not foming back anytime soon..
"I am thinking this will be at 100.00 in a week, they have nothing in the pipeline to replace this with."
"Beat STRONG earnings and estimates, even Alzheimer’s failure. Has very good pipeline. Soon in few weeks will go towards $300"
"BIIB needs to acquire companies with winning drugs. AMRN already has an FDA approved drug, Vascepa, that will have itslabel expanded to treat Cardiovascular disease, Vascepa is safe and effective. (Is even in a trial by the VA for AD!)The most interesting candidate would be AVXL. Too bad BIIB has wasted money on ineffective treatments when theycould buy something that actually works!"
what day is this...?
"I'm definitely the best contrarian indicator of all time. EVERYTIME I sell a stock, it shoots up immediately after."
Scooped at 290. Lucky so far
"If they do buy shares, they should just use the previous $1.7B authorized and not an additional $5B! Money much better spent acquiring smaller companies with Phase 3 trials in the CNS area. Besides, they don't have that much cash to spend on buyback anyway. Are they going to borrow money for buyback - that will be even more ludicrous...."

So puts Monday guys?
"One more thing at this rate, the company is buying almost 20 million shs every year, by this time next yr we should be near 145 mill shs outstanding. Do the math at constant price we would be worth just 42 to 44 billion , someone will gobble them up. Celgene junk was bought out for double that."
$SAVA is a much more attractive investment.
"Looking at this to buy, can someone tell me what caused the major drop on Mar 21st this year?"
"Based on Lily's results, Biogen's AD drug probably works. I bet it gets approval, with conditions. This is pretty big news."
Meeting begins at 10 est. Probably goes to 12? Maybe as late as two?? Should get a tentative yes at that time and I believe there will be a positive reaction in the SP. Time will tell.
"BIIB & TGTX , My top two bio performers. Buy/Hold/Accumulate. Long term holds."
"I would have my telomeres measured, but I am scared of what they might find. Doctor, ""We are still looking, we will get back to you""."
"Will drop to $325 on Monday. Major over-reaction for a phase 2 result. Full results are not released, phase 3 not successful yet, no FDA approval, final pricing not detailed and future earnings not yet estimated."
Cassava Sciences SAVA is the keynote speaker at the upcoming conference on AD on the 15th. Biogen will be presenting too but they’re not the keynote speaker.The focus/keynote of the conference will be on early detection which is why cassava sciences will be presenting on their early blood test detection of AD called SavaDx. Word to the wise investorsThis is why Biogen is down and cassava sciences is up substantially today.
"Aducanumab will not be approved by the FDA. The results are clear, the drug doesn’t work and the plaque removal hypothesis is completely flawed.The only companies with a truly innovative and promising approach to AD are SAVA and AVXL. The Sigma-1 receptor is the key to maintaining and restoring cell homeostasis in the brain."
At current price I see 5 down and 30 up. Just bought and will gladly wait.
"Wow, US alone have 30.3 million people with diabetes as per ADA , forget about Lipitor as the best selling drug over $150B and going, Vascepa will take the crown this is BIG , no wonder negotiations taking time and BP should be aggressive $NVS $GILD. $GSK. $AZN $BIIB. $AMZN is joining the bidding"
Buffet is on board!!!
"Why didn’t BIIB GO up on the PLEGRIDY European approval?ADU will be approved by the FDA soon. They cannot leave millions of AD patients and their families to suffer. Numbers on sales show stock will literally go over 1,500 with a proper healthy PE on their pipeline."
"SAVA has the real drug for Alzheimer’s. BIIB cant spin their crummy, half baked data into an approval and they know it. SAVA Results coming soon and they just put the poison pill in place. Giddy Up !"
"Relief Therapeutic stock symbol ( RLFTF )NeuroRx and Relief announce topline efficacy data from patients treated with RLF-100 (aviptadil) under the U.S. FDA Expanded Access Protocol authorization for respiratory failure related tocritical COVID-19Geneva, Switzerland, and Radnor, PA, October 13, 2020 – RELIEF THERAPEUTICS Holding AG (SIX: RLF, OTCQB: RLFTF) (“Relief” or the “Company“) and NeuroRx, Inc., today announced topline results from 45 patients assessed in an open-label prospective study where 21 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure were treated with RLF-100(aviptadil) and compared to 24 control patients treated in the same setting. All patients had severe comorbidities that rendered them ineligible for the ongoing randomized, controlled phase 2b/3 trial being conducted to ascertain safety and efficacy of RLF-100, and all patients were deteriorating despite treatment with approved therapies for COVID-19. Overall, 81% of RLF-100-treated patients survived beyond 60 days, compared to 17% of control patients. Patients treated with RLF-100 demonstrated a 9-fold increased probability of survival and recovery from respiratory failure, with a high degree of statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed by Prof. Phil Lavin, FASA, FRAPS of the Boston Biostatistical Research Foundation."
Earlier today I heard that Buffett bought some BIIB. anyone know if this is true?
"Engage and Emerge are the two alzheimer studies conducted by BIIB. Each study had three arms: low dose, high dose, and placebo. Due to the futility analysis in 12/18, both studies were deemed futile and both were terminated 3/19. But the last bit of data that straggled in by 3/19 showed that Emerge met the study endpoint but not Engage, which was trending very poorly. In fact the primary and one of the secondary endpoints in Engage showed more mental decline as compared to the placebo for the high dose. To make matters worse, the Engage low dose patients did better than the high dose patients and better than the placebo. The purpose of two identical studies is for reproducibility, meaning the results from both trials should be close. Engage and Emerge do not show reproducible data and without this both trials should be ignored. But aha! The white coats at BIIB observed that if only the augmented high dose patients were counted in Engage, it would pass. Then with two aligned studies, the FDA would approve. This approach is not even close to common practice at the FDA. I think the analysts are being kind to BIIB and giving some odds of approval. But in reality, the FDA will use the AdCom docs to kill the submission."
Anyone who shorted at 300 will make good money. Same old info. A lot of talk about efficacy.
"So TSRO is the culprit today, Always something dragging down the sector"
Over $240 this week

"Biogen giving our money$ 10 million to a bank that prides itself on being a bank focussing on the black movement... this UnitedOne Bank is a RACIST bank , they support and fund the terrorist group BlAxkk Lives Matter ( you know the ones destroying our cities).. Shame on Biogen... call up and complain... CEO should refund that 10 million from his own money... if I start a bank focussing on white people, will Biogen give 10 million to my bank.... this race baiting extortion has got to stop... folks we need to speak out and enough... start by spreading the word speaking out.... Ban watching / attending NFL and NBA .... don't buy the shirts etcc.."
ACIU like Insaid yesterday will be BIIB acquisition target. Today news is huge on the PD front. Be on the right side of the market.
"Issue: a few of Biogen's potential Alzheimer cures were discontinued previously. That's why it is trading lower. If indeed they find a medicine for Alzheimer the stock price will in a period of a few weeks double, and months after it can increase threefold or quadruppel. It's a risky stock."

Who knows.....................Saltynacho"

At what point it's going to open?
"It is important to note that in the two cancelled aducanumab P3 studies, it was found to be safe to use. The studies were halted because the drug was not effective in treating alzheimer's. BIIB should be congratulated in creating a drug that did no harm to its patients. Please no jokes that a placebo does the same."
No faintest reason BIIB was sold off yesterday!It is due to rebound soon!

Last ER BIIB gave a guidance of $32 per share in earnings so even if it trade at Thursday closed @$326 to a forward PE of 10. Cheap value stock. I believe Analysts created a lot of fears and uncertainty into this stock. I own BIIB for about 7 years and non of those Analysts are correct with their prediction.
"Finally, some genius investors have discovered that BIIB is not dependent on China, Mexico, or the credit markets. But I'm sure they'll forget that again in a few days :("
somebody knows that fda will approve Aducanumab. Biib will be $600 on march.
"Nice price action and volume expansion after FDA approval. Buy rating: 5, target: 395, according to 9trading."
Anyone thinking of shorting this stock?your opinion count.
This is unacceptable 27 percent? Down ?They have many drugs on the Market!
BIIB is a screaming at this price level!$450 in the making!
Buy time
up a couple points in afterhours... could open tomorrow in the 230s or 240s
FDA WILL APPROVE BIOGEN AD.
Rumor is BIIB to buy RGNX as it gains entry into zolgensma market. Regenex bio
I have been thinking about buying this stock for a while but the extreme volatility has kept me off so far. I understand that volatility occurs often with pharma stocks yet i still can not quite understand why it occurs at such levels. Perhaps someone could give me an explanation?
"BRING on the class action, many will follow"
"Does anybody know , how much buyback is remaining ? .Thanks in advance"
This is depressing. These results show a muddled result. Certainly something is happening with this drug however this disease appears to be so arbitrary and individual it seems doubtful that a treatment or cure is even close to coming to fruition
"Wow, what a disaster. Now the stock is falling below critical levels of support at $245 and could be at risk of falling to $206. What to do now? Damn!"
nobody wants this junk anymore
Wow what a move. Took almost $27kvin profits off the table. Not bad on a holding period of a few weeks. There will probably be a few point drop on Monday. I’m bullish on Biogen.
"Watch BIIB tank after a much superior drug, sumifilam (SAVA) is approved, which has superior endpoints and safety. Do your due diligence and look at the Alzheimer’s landscape, not just what you want to see."
Yes I agree....yahoo seems to be committing suicide. It just continues to decline in user friendliness and substance. Advertisements mixed with news. I guess the youngin's are taking over.

BIIB Alzheimer’s drug just sucks. There’s nothing else more to say. It doesn’t work but BIIB is in bed with the FDA and lawmakers trying everything they can to push their trash drug through to approval.
Run to cover short. Run rabbit run!
If you look at the hourly chart from the drop you will see a cup formed perfectly and a handle now formed. Break out upwards is next phase. Not sure if that has been mentioned here. Been following this stock since the drop. Easy 50% upside here.

stock up before march 7
Buyout imminent
Maybe the FDA approval of aducannumab is sooner than expected. I read that 60 days after submitting the application for fast track approval is standard. Not sure why a March timeframe is given if submitted August 7th.

"Whatever happened to the takeover talk that drove BIIB's price to 333 a couple months ago? Was that just a ""pump & dump"" by investors that just wanted to get out before the election. Wish there was a way to monitor these investment firms and keep them honest."
What results are you talking about? I don't see anything due out tomorrow.
"The bearish pullback on trade and Iran is waning. I sense optimistic sentiment returning and the strength of our economy being more fully embraced. Stalwarts like AMD will continue to thrive.

"I can kind of see why it got a negative reaction. It would put a huge burden on the insurance industry / medicare as half of the population would eventually take it at $50K per year, yet it was not proven to be effective enough to be confident those same people wouldn't soon need assisted living care anyway. And then what, are you going to make them choose between the medication that might help a little and the assisted care they need? Now you have doubled the costs to take care of these seniors.If it were really effective and could allow seniors to live on their own, then maybe it could justify the price. I know the cost vs. benefit shouldn't necessarily factor into the FDA review, but the people on the board have to be able to see the end result..."

"11/03/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Biogen (BIIB) said on Tuesday its drug candidate BIIB059 showed a statistically significant reduction in joint disease activity compared to placebo in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, an autoimmune disease, based on part A of a mid-stage trial.The study met its primary and secondary endpoints, while the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, Biogen said, adding that the efficacy, safety and tolerability results support the continued development of BIIB059 in this indication. It plans to present the data and other parts of the study at the American College of Rheumatology meeting from Nov. 5 to 9."
"I just found something that may be causing the majority of problem today: ... Biogen is currently entangled in patent litigation over Tecfidera, a multiple sclerosis drug that is Biogen's largest revenue generator. Decisions in those two cases are ""the biggest near-term up/down driver where we have limited visibility on the outcome,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison, who predicted outcomes for both around March 22 that could drive the stock down as much as 10% or up 5-10%."

Very close to the 52 week low.
"I am a bit confused on the recent spike in pre-market due to the news that the review process will take 3 months longer due to the FDA requesting more data from Bigoen. That seems like bad news as originally, the FDA was quite optimistic on the initial filing. And one would have assumed that Biogen would have provided the best evidence they have in that filing.it seems like the FDA is asking for more evidence that supports the drug, but why would this evidence not have been provided in the first place if it was there?"

This looks like positive news. I don't understand the reaction.
Time to go back over $300
This drop is enough ground for somebody to lose his/her mind..................
With the price fall like that seems to me analysts were raising price for the medicine which BIIB does not have any sale or revenue. Now analysts downgraded to almost half price . I would like to know what basis again they are downgrading. And what was actually there point to raise price. Were they valid. All criminals but without punishment.Big criminals goes away without punishment. This is USA!!!

Obviously Morgan Stanley is shorting BIIB. The minute it went up $4 they issued an underweight statement. This is criminal
"Clearly this stock is being brought down by the big institutions... I have been buying today.. The value of this stock is extremely undervalued. The Stock should be trading $360-370 Per share....I’m not sure why stock is being sold... Biogen will win appeal by the Patent office from Mylan..The Alzheimer’s drug will get approved... So my recommendation is keep buying. Jim Cramer, didn’t say he wouldn’t buy Biogen, he said he would buy Seattle Genetics instead ( he’s pushing stock he owns).... Cramer is most mouth, very rarely is research being done on his show...So BUY BUY and hold long term, Biogen has so many drugs in pipeline. You hold this stock will be over $1000 in 2 years or less..."

"Well on valuation basis, BIIB is notw""fairly valued"" as opposed to be undervalued based on yesterday's close. But as we all know stocks have a tendency to overshoot fair value on the upside and the downside. The key question is that is this the start of a rally to get to a new 52-week high ($344-plus) or just a short rally that will dissipate?"
"It's obvious some in the FDA panel are afraid to reject this drug. They just had so much hope for this to work but they cannot justified approving it based on the dismissal benefit. So they just keep waiting for some positive news...keeping on extending the deadline.SAVA is a better bet at this point. Yes small company but the trial is being run with the NIH and so far, much better benefit than Biogen drug. The phase2b data of SAVA is much better than the phase3 data of Biogen. Unless SAVA data regress in phase3, they have a better shot of taming (at least slowing down) this disease.If I were a Biogen investor, I would move some of the money in SAVA.

PerFinancial Times Biogen Shares Fall On Alzheimer's Trial Results Perhaps this will helpDavid Crow-21 MINUTES AGO Shares in Biogen fell by almost 10 per cent in after-hours trading as investors poked holes in a trial of an Alzheimer’s medicine that the company had billed as a success. Investors were unnerved by the fact that patients on lower doses of the drug — which is being developed in conjunction with Japan’s Eisai — declined more quickly than those who received a placebo. The finding — which was not shared with reporters at an earlier embargoed briefing — appeared to cast uncertainty on the finding that higher doses of the drug could slow the rate at which patients declined.

Unfortunately it’s flames for this round!
Big news out today on how researches can diagnose Alzheimers.
Svb just recommenced outperform. At 4:10 amSomeone is scared
"�Biogen’s product Aducanumab is likely to be “first in class” therapy but has deficits in safety and efficacy on which PMN310 can improve, creating “best in class” therapy. Aducanumab is likely to be approved in 2021. $BIIB https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/07/06/biogen-shares-leap-as-alzheimers-drug-shows.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo ...."
AMRN is getting ready to see Stock Price Blast Off!
Some harsh questions from the panel. Mostly about statistics.Dr. Dunn (FDA) is presenting... very positive for adu!!!
Why did Biogen fell today? Here is a logical reason. Seen this before in the marketplace I suspect buybacks. If there is an upward bounce then it confirms it. Let’s see tomorrow morning
"Buy VSTM, buy and hold, a good stock !"
I bet you BIIB probably bought back about 10 million shares in the last few days. BIIB on sale!
"“Fabre on CNVC: Biogen may be halted for much of the day while the FDA debates its new Alzheimer’s drug. It’s likely to be improved, could ‘revolutionize healthcare’” is the news I read on Ameritrade"
"@Traian, you are really a pro in the stock market to predict DJIA may down 400 pts today!!"
"...Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, citing conflict of interest, has recused a member of an 11-person advisory committee set to review Biogen Inc's ( BIIB) experimental Alzheimer's drug aducanumab on Friday.Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman confirmed on Monday that he was recused from the scheduled meeting of outside advisors to the FDA. Expert advisory panels often play an important role ahead of FDA approval decisions, although the agency is not required to take their advice.Knopman, who said he was recused because of his involvement in conducting clinical trials of aducanumab, has been a vocal critic of the drug, including in a paper published on Sunday in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia.""Aducanumab's efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes,"" he wrote.The FDA, which is slated to decide by early March whether to approve aducanumab, did not immediately respond to a request for comment...."
I’m assuming it’ll get halted tomorrow? What happens to calls?
52 week high $388...split the difference...buyout $325
Why is all biotech down today?
BIIB/TGTX...... Accumulating.
I lost my tail chasing this down and adding all the way from 234. Oh well....
What’s with the after hours spike? I see no news.

"I have been an investor ( not trader) in Biogen for a long time. I even bought shares this morning at 288. Even without the alzheimers drug, Biogen is valued 350 share. Currently has a PE of 8, which is insanely low, this stock is very cheap. The company has been beating expectations year over year.. Biogen has many drugs in the pipeline.. stick is trading at significant discount. People are focussing on just the Alzheimers drug ( which is a huge drug to help our society) but there so much more. So I am a long term buyer, continuing to accrue a hff shares. Honestly, I can see this stock doubling in the near future as it should..if it gets approved Alzheimers drug, this is over 1000 share. So currently trading at huge discount. Good luck, God Bless America"
"The ADU ADCOM was really emotional. A few panel members were really upset with Dr. Dunn that they did not really answer Question 1 Efficacy of the successful pivot trial). Q1 should receive YES, but nobody said YES. They refused to ignore the failed trial. Anyway, I still believe the FDA will approve Adu with some conditions including P4 monitoring. But the chances of approval is now lower than before the ADCOM."
This price seems to be an effort to shame Biogen. And this isn't inappropriate.
It seems that everyone existing at the same time.
"lol @ investing in ""IF"""
boy we're really in the toilet bowl here.
25 minutes will begin BUY POINT. Boolean
Major Tom To Ground Control!! Have you spotted Mr. Brian Skorney!! Boolean
The reasons given by Brian Skorney for the downgrade is very weak as presented by him at CNBC.
Science magazine touched on the controversy. One surmised that Adu will receive a conditional approval. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/12/skepticism-persists-about-revived-alzheimer-s-drug-after-conference-presentation?utm_campaign=news_weekly_2019-12-06&et_rid=16759399&et_cid=3113276
What gives with the 4-day 20-point drop?
"IBB is down close to 3%. But BIIB is barely down. This could mean that the ""bottom"" is in. And may be nice set-up going into earnings."
COULD BE UP BY 50 TO 60 TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All you baggies.. How are those 300 dollar shares doing when its 200. Prob pretty lonely. At least you will have those awhile unless you just cut a 30 to 40 percent loss. lots of millionaires now thousandaires....I.E. Shep
Close your eyes. close your ear. Close your breath. and buy Biogen
What now?
stock deserves a ground hog day award.
"So where is the PR on Spinraza NURTURE (pre-symptomatic infants) data presented this morning? Maybe we get something Monday, unless there is nothing new. This is a very important trial."
Buy CDXC. Tru Niagen is the answer to prevent Alzheimer's. There is no cure for Alzheimer's.
OK - the changes made in the study = a 22% change in cognitive decline. SO - how can the FDA not allow it to continue AND they have been actually accelerating authorization of drugs SO I can not see how it is not allowed to continue. The cost humanitarian and financial is huge so to stop a promising pharmacologic intervention is just not likely....in my opinion. NOW....we shall see but I truly believe that they will allow this to go forward and allow results to dictate what happens from there. But to stop it...NOW....NO WAY the costs are just too high. Boolean
Glad I loaded up when the market panicked over the aducanumab delay
Anyone have any insight into a labeling issue for Biogen coming up later this month??
Traian is happily blocked.
Must be skirting an event horizon...
Thank God I own ABBV shares which will ease the pain.
BIIB longs unfortunately are riding on the wrong bio-pharma ponyMTNB 
misunderstanding?
"Has anyone noticed a little stock making headlines today? DECN, up nearly 200% on over 40million shares. New test kit for corona virus. has accuracy of over 80% and a cost of about $7.00 ea. currently under test in Korea. They anticipate selling over 400 million test units this year???? well if so could be real $$$$ for investors. Don't say I didn't let you know."
"SOMEONE needs to go to the 'pen', and we are not talking about penthouse"
"Amazing, Live CORONA counter.www.divocportal.com"
It official fda voted no under 300 monday
Check out (http://Multistockalerts.com). They just mentioned BIIB in the daily newsletter.
"Oral presentation of the BAN2401 phase II trial is being presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Chicago on July 25. Should be enlightening, and provide details on the trial design and results that weren't part of the topline data release."
"BIIB is the baby being thrown out with the bath water. Leveraged traders are selling to raise cash. Others are just panicking to get out of equities. I wonder if next week will be a ""Black Monday"" if talks collapse on Friday and the trade war begins."
Sava Is the Play all day.....look at the float...grab it before it goes to 50$
"So even if you kill Tecfidera, what do you have? How will it effect EPS. I’m still getting 11-14 PE. Still cheap."
BIIB will be taken out by pfe or mrk. In the $624 / 650 range.....
"BIIB reported earnings will be around $5/share... Which will be a miss of over $2, if not more. The pps will drop below $170 following the news."
"Ok I get it. Biogen has had a good run up but rightfully so. Lets face it they are still making a ton of money on their MS drugsand with aducanumab soon to get FDA approval 10 billion a year estimated I don't feel to bad. Lets face it a treatment for alzheimers is pretty huge and Biogen is the ""only"" one that has shown positive trials."
"This causes severe brain swelling for patients who are ALREADY compromised. Theres no way FDA will approve this junk. Monoclonal antibodies have like a 6% penetration rate through the blood brain barrier as it is (or less, including ADCs). Anyone thinking this will get approved is delusional"
The Alzheimer’s drug was valued at ~10 b before the news. So the total lose of 20 b market value is not all by adu even assuming its entire value was wiped out
The options activity and bid and ask prices are suspicious. Is a take over or a big announcement coming up? Anybody?
hey guys what study is BIIB having for stroke patients? one of our patients is getting an experimental BIIB IV infusion.
BIIB announced that they will appeal the district court decision.
Marissa’s CIO and BIIB Board of Director so Bullish and many positive comments on Biogen. Hope he see something great that we don’t see.
Looking for 160 on this deadwood.
It is funny. The FDA sounds like a sponsor and some panel members sound like the FDA. Who is in charge! THE FDA!
Bottom feeder attorney class-action announcements should be flooding the PR feed shortly.
Emotional sell off 
I think this will do well on earnings. the alz drug is about to come out soon to. this has room to go.
BIIB is weighing big on the Naz.
Nice move. Hopefully just the beginning.
hello
"Someone can explain to me the logic of last analyst from MS to raise target price to 212 from 211$ (one dollar lol) when the price was around 225$ and when every day the price have fluctuations of 3/4 dollars?? when the price/earning is around 7??? when there are insiders that buy stock and dont sell more?? ahhh yeah!! the logic is the same... they want accumulate shares at low price or want cover their short position lower, hoping depressed investors will sell them the shares at lower price and they cannot allow and they dont want, that now the price go up. From my side, every time that price will go down i will add more, when biogen will close the gap around 320$ i will sell them the shares waiting the same analyst that when price will be around 300$, without shame, will say at investors ""NOW BUYY"". gl to all"
Damn good ER with hope but market is not reacting!!
Nice to see BIIB getting a little well deserved respect.
Congrats to those who were brave enough to buy the March dip.
BIIB is completely dead
"BIIB: the game on investors:1. Wednesday:FDA briefing documents very positive. Except a statisticas hidden in DOM page 250 or so;2. Wednesday and Thursday Investors pour in, stock skyrockets, many analysts beating drums;3. Friday:adcom panel called, stock put on halt for trading, adcom panel skeptical, votes 8 NO votes, to 1 yes, 2 uncertain for the most important question;So, I bought on Wednesday on positive briefing papers of FDA and many tweets and articles by pundits.On Friday, the FDA calked panel was opposite to FDA briefing papers in voting. Worst, the same pundits drumming the stock on Wednesday were taking opposite positions. Even worst is stock holders were locked in not allowed to touch their stocks.What a world. Whom to believe. On Monday it will be ugly and I feel stupid to have bought on Wednesday. Actually, my idea was to sell Friday, but did not anticipate hold. I bought at $324. Now not sure what to expect Monday : how bad"
"Someone in After hours purchased 70,925 Shares @ $372.84 = $26,443,677."
"So, let me break this down. This company had they shares pumped in July 2015 up to 400$, but after bad news about bad results of aducanumab trials came in, PPS fell to ~300$. Analysts were saying that amyloid beta hypothesis is wrong and aducanumab is going to fail big time. Company didn't listen and announced that they going to build factory (400 people working) in Solothurn, Switzerland for manufacturing new drugs targeting beta amyloid peptides in order to treat Alzheimer's disease.And after 4 years, we receive news about aducanumab being inefficient and useless, so PPS fell another 30% to 216$.Two days later Eisai and Biogen announced that they going to try 2 another drugs targeting beta amyloid plaques, while 4 years ago all experts concluded that this kind of approach to treating Alzheimer's is wrong and they were right as universally acknowledged today.Why're they doing this?"
"Bought at the low of 224, happy to be here. I see this stock heading back up.. maybe not to 373, but certainly undervalued right now"
It's going to drop under 200.
"The price moved as expected, though my put-call trade was not that great... oh well! :) Looking forward now to a move above 300 as the risks from new administration to drug industry wane out..."
Stock till halted? No pre-market movement..
"With Buffet on board, this will influence the FDA decision and increase the odds significantly they will approve ADU drug shortly. $1000 stock easily if gets approval."
https://www.biospace.com/article/1-alzheimer-s-new-approaches-and-new-hope/
"BIIB asserts that their Alz study Emerge passed because it had a higher proportion of high dose patients. Engage, the failed Alz study had less due solely to starting one month earlier than Emerge. A straightforward way to put both studies on the same footing is to ignore all the patients enrolled in the first month of Engage. But this is not good enough for BIIB for Engage will still fail: the results were that bad. BIIB's approach to the FDA will be to throw out both studies and just focus on a cohort of high dose patients that seemed to do well in both studies. The FDA will not accept this approach."
"Biogen is still expected to earn nearly $30 in 2020, so even a draconian P/E multiple of 8X gets you a floor value of $240. Yes, there is the Tecfidera IPR challenge which presents an additional $30 downside overhang, but that will likely lead to just a settlement anyway. Plus they have pipeline assets in ALS and Stroke. And cost cutting and $30 bln in balance sheet leverage for acquisitions. I'd say we could get back to $300 within the next 36 months"
Not even into Phase 3 yet and the stocks acts totally irrational! Only good for mm's cashing in on the volatility imo!
Biogen 2Q Adj EPS $10.26
likely a $100 drop
somebody offer 325 and then kick Clancy out the door by his #$%$.
Charging $750K for the Spinraza for the first year treatment is outrageous.
Biogen is risky because they closed 2 projects for an Alzheimer cure around the earnings of the second quarter (!) I do think Biogen has a lot of expertise and one of the most succesfull teams.However the sector has been under some pressure.
Biogen may have bought back some shares today. Let’s watch if there is a bounce up tomorrow. I suspect that for tomorrow. I suspect they may have bought up to several hundred thousand shares. Much short of their 2M shares buyback. Hey Biogen needs to make sure they spend the $$$ efficiently
No premarket news or trades
"I suggest anyone with doubts about Biogen’s intrinsic value: read the latest earnings report transcript (Seeking Alpha). Especially pay attention to the Q&A, which frequently focuses on aducanumab approval and efficacy. Management is extremely optimistic that FDA approval is forthcoming. Well worth your time!"

AVXL turns the switch back on that Alzheimers disease turns off. Its like a self cleaning oven or refrigerator in simple terms.
How is the Alzheimer's data not moving the needle more here?
280 by Friday. Stay strong.
"This pretty much seals the deal for a takeover. Question isn't if but when? All the signs are there. First CEO Scangos leaves, then they spinoff most important asset to form BIIV, then others exit, including the head of Human Resources, and now Clancy, the CFO! JUST GET ER DONE DAMMIT!!!!"
Close yourS eyes. close your ear. Close your breath. and buy Biogen
Three hundred is just around the corner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why???????????Cumulative momentum is building daily!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AVXL only company stabilizing and improving Alzheimers. Australian results have been amazing.
"Sean Williams wrotte on 5th August, 2015:""Shares of biotech blue-chip stock Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) were walloped in July, with its stock losing 21% of its market value based on data from S&P Capital IQ. The primary culprits were weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings results and early stage data involving Alzheimer's drug aducanumab that didn't exactly thrill investors...Adding insult to injury, just a few days prior to its Q2 release, Biogen released additional data from its phase 1b study involving aducanumab, and the data, while still showing statistical significance, wasn't as amazing as its top-line release a few months prior. The mental acuity score for the placebo group of patients demonstrated a smaller decline than before, while the 1 mg and 6 mg doses didn't appear to offer as strong a benefit as the 3 mg and 10 mg doses. The good news is the updated data for the 3 mg and 10 mg doses still appears to be statistically strong. ...So what should you do? My suggestion would be to hang tight. I see little reason to rush into owning Biogen, particularly with Alzheimer's disease drugs having such a high failure rate. Although Biogen has two potential mega-blockbusters in its pipeline (aducanumab and anti-lingo-1), they both are in indications where the failure rate is high. With that in mind, I suspect Biogen could be range-bound for a while until its outlook clears a bit."""
"This is not the 1990 to 1999. Jim Morrison! This is the end my friends, this is the end!"
Overdone as expected... Waiting very patiently to jump back in.....
Late article from FDA lower the bar for AD trial and that is good for Biogen. That’s exactly what they want early detection and prevention than finding a cured for it.
Forward p/e is 5
"no idea, i bought thinking the LLY data would bolster the odds of BIIB approval. so much for that. however its not impossible that this is the drawdown before the tsunami buy."
I bought PRE hours. Great deal IMHO
"The positive signal, however weak, seen from $LLY's' donanemab bolsters the amyloid beta hypothesis and strengthens the chance of FDA approval of aducanumab. Both donanemab and aducanumab are proteins and they cannot enter the intracellular space. To clear amyloid beta from the intracellular as well as extracellular compartment, one may need RNAi against APP, which is the precursor of amyloid beta. Alnylam's ALN-APP is to be developed to stop production of APP in hereditary Alzheimer's disease. This future drug could be combined with aducanumab for better results."
Let's be smart. No sell market orders
It’s the end
Biogen employees are dangerous to the Middlesex county of MA. They are spreading coronoavirus in community. That is so stupid of them. How a biotech company can held meeting like this amid the cornoavirus threat? That is very irresponsible and disturbing to the community!! As a biotech company they suppose to be role model. Shame on all of them!!
ABT is down as well. Since the PFE news came out all the companies involved in testing and antibody therapeutics get slammed!
"Moving back to 28.50 shortly with our $35 target price solid. Best best in chip sector. $MU still drifting away from the ship with sharks circling.

Would not bet on Anacanumab to get approval from the FDA so fast. Believe Cassava Sciences' (SAVA) Simufilam is a far more advanced treatment.An outside panel of scientists that the FDA convened in November to advise it—none of whom specialize in treating Alzheimer’s patients—lambasted Biogen for massaging the data. They said the positive results from the one trial could be a fluke and urged the FDA to require Biogen to conduct another—which could take five or more years to complete.
ISRG just had a nice beat and hopefully will help the sector tomorrow. BIIB is absurdly undervalued
I can’t believe it lost one-third of it’s value in one day. That just tells us that all the eggs where in one basket. Institutional investors are going to bail before March 31. There’s just no catalyst to propel this stock. Shorts heaven for this stock. What a shame!
"When you have patient advocates behind you, always a good sign."
"Immune from trade talks difficulty, AMD will rocket forward on successful talks and move gradually higher if a tariff war. I suspect.

Hoping my average down works out for me and my followers this week.$BIIB is early for me but like it as a long term value play.As always, conduct your own due diligence to validate guidance."
From everything I've read the likelihood of Mylan prevailing in the patent dispute is nil. They would have to beat on all 20 challenges whereas Biogen only has to beat on one. Even if Mylan were to beat they would not be able to produce their generics until well into the future. Some saying 2028! This gave us a good buying opportunity yesterday!
BIIB is the only game in town right now===My quant model says BIIB will abe approved with the drug in 70%+ Chance
"Well... cr.... the CFO leaving to Alexion took the stock down AH -3.41 on solid volume. Looked like this stock was headed to recovery. It's off the lows in AH which was 255. Honestly, to use a trumpism, this feels like a big nothing burger. Who cares if the CFO leaves? Not like he invents the drugs or does anything useful. Of course Chevy freaked out, but he freaks out about everything lol. I'm only exposed to biotechs through a MF and this particular MF has 1.3M shares of BIIB and 3.5M shares of ALXN... soo... if Biogen is going -$4 or more tomorrow... no better place for it to go then Alexion with 2.7x the shares :)."
LOLOLOL
TEVA getting nosebleed on MS drug sales. Should be a big plus for BIIB. This makes no sense.
"6 hours later, still feeling it."
"I am calling for 250 (+ 5%, - 10% ) by End of Month; One more bad day on Wall Street and shorts will pound the stock knowing that nothing is happening with the drug until next year, while the economy is in tatters too."

Morgan Stanley did a great job with the double upgrade before today's surge. I have a feeling a bunch of other analyst are going to jump on the bandwagon pretty soon.
Shut your thinking process and like a cave man buy BIIB.
down 5 in after hours????
Good company! Excellent finacial results! I sold CVS and bought some Biogen on $229.9.
"If the patients drink enough water each day, it can slow the alzheimer disease significantly."
So it seems that BIIB is taking it on the chin from the PTCT successful drug trial in SMA (a possible threat to Biogen's Spinraza). Kind of sucks for me as a long but at least I now understand why I'm being hit.
"375 or 380 sounds likely on friday,,,,,or depending on tomorrow's annonce"

"Locked in some profit, and adding more TGTX.... This bio, just recently received FDA approval. BIIB & TGTX >>>>>>> Strong Buys/Strong Holds."
"I understand that FDA may go against the panel of experts and approve the drug in March but near term the stock will take a significant hit. Let's see the action tomorrow. Holding March calls and November 13th puts. Will add to my calls if I'm able to profit from my puts.Good luck,"
"I still see this time as an opportunity for Biogen to buy back their stock. Biogen still have a lot of drugs in their pipeline that can potentially earn them big bucks. Buying back $5B in value will really help them increase the EPS and lower their PE. Failing one drug will not really hurt them. Biogen have not had a failure in a long time. No drug company is batting 100%, The fail drug did yield a lot of data and can be re position into another purpose. Biogen is far from being a one or two drug company. I am still a buyer and bullish on Biogen. At the way the stock is moving a slight downward trend i may wait till the first quarter earnings report is released. EPS maybe slightly down due to write off of the fail test. If there is a $B dollar write off, the stock may be down to around $210 -215 if so, i will buy even more. I feel that anything below $220 a share is a very good buy. I will not be surprise if Biogen have already spent at least $2-2.5B of the shares buyback. JMHO"
whats happening??? whats the news???????????????????
72% profit increase
downgraded because it's not going to move up enough for our liking? gyms
Why is it down after market? Any bad news?
those of you wanting to buy 200 area or lower are dreaming now. buy back will put a bottom in the stock.
$BIIB very nice
Hog wash. We will see sub 200 Monday.

"You should buy ACIU (AC IMMUNE) if you want Alzheimer drug exposure, with among the best risk/rewards I have ever seen. ACIU has the broadest portfolio of development stage Azlheimer's drugs with top partners such as Biogen, Eli Lilly, Roche and AbbVie. ACIU has the potential to earn $15 bil in revenues from royalties and payments The market cap of the company is only $400 mil, with $316 mil of net cash, resulting of an enterprise value of only $87 mil. If even one of ACIU's drugs go into commercial production, the stock could go up 10x or more, with limited near-term downside due to the company's strong cash position. ACIU has several drugs in its development pipeline in both stage 1 and stage 2 development, so investors have many shots at goal. There is a huge catalyst coming up on Nov 7th when the company will host a conference on the progress of their drug candidates. Investors have not started paying attention yet, but I think that will happen shortly. I have attached a recent positive recommendation on the stock from Value Investors, which is among the most reputable investors club. https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/AC_IMMUNE_SA/9888338509"
Anyone else hear buyout?
"Sorry longs, I now expect this to drop tomorrow given the strong run up today. $227 should hold."
Imagine what BIIB would be at if the Nasdaq wasn't up 100 points today
Jumped back in today... Was waiting for a downturn and got it... Alzheimer's drug is a lottery ticket although you would think they wouldn't have formally applied for approval if they knew this was likely to be rejected... Good luck to all...

Nope not trading yet
I heard China was introducing an alzheimer's drug as well but don't know any specifics on it.
"BIoB: bought at $324 yesterday. So, tomorrow will be crucial. Does panel vote tomorrow to approve or not?. When will we know (what time?). Will stock be halted before a decision. Anyone provide insights please "

BIIB is down 4.94% to $297.64
Halted now. When will it open to trading?.
"Eisai and Biogen have had their hands full defending their data on a different drug, BAN2401, after a changeup in the study design drew a host of critics suggesting that they had tilted the trial toward a positive outcome.

Hope and pray we don't follow CELG's lead tomorrow. Down 9.00 on the FDA refusing submittal of one of their MS drugs!
I had bought 10 Jan 225 calls a few weeks ago. Sold them today 74K in profits. I think I will take the rest of the week off. Looking for the next options to buy. I hope everyone made a killing today!
"ATTN BIOGEN SHAREHOLDERS: AMAZON IS HAVING A 24 HOUR SALE ON ALL KY JELLY PRODUCTS. TO RECEIVE YOUR DISCOUNT, USE COUPON CODE: ""BIIB BAGHOLDER"" AT CHECKOUT."
BIIB not down $20. You got 1 BIVV for every 2 BIIB. BIVV is approx. $40/shr - that's $20 for each BIIB you own. Your holding didn't drop $20/shr in value. What happens from here out is anyone's guess. Will MRK takeout BIIB?
"Folks about to lose big on here, you have my empathy."
why is biib down 7.5%

"Buy without thought. The drop is a noise. Don't look at noise. Look at trend, EPS trend, growth trend. Noise is when someone is taking advantage of buying now. Buy Buy Buy"
Over 40% undervalued! Definitely a good time to buy and hold at least until after FDA approval in June 2021
this is not a reasonable 30% drop within a week !!!
$450 on approval?
Like major ouchies baby.
Alzheimer's drug approved??
Any one here know someone who is in the aducanumab phase 3b trials. Would love to hear if anyone has feedback on it at this point.
BIIB comes thru once again.... My 2nd most profitable stock....
Either some one has inside information is buying shares of BIIB knowing the FDA is going to grant approval of their Alzheimer's or pumping the stock to buy a large numbers of puts knowing its going to get slammed. Downside to $180 in worse case and $500+ in best case. Thoughts?
Gotta wait until Monday its gonna be a long weekend
"man, this stock sucks today. they bought junk and the stock is reacting."
we're down today cause the head janitor resigned.
Three hundred around the corner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I hope BIIB will close at 304,I got it at 304"
I hate insiders
Seems like some recent negative news has been digested at this point.

Looking at the options on this stock. We go out into the 6/28 strike date and the thing jumps from 2.5 to 19 per option for 290 strike. I have a feeling that we are seriously underpriced at this point. Do your own research.

do you think it builds back 5% today?

"Let’s be reasonable, this drug that they lost the court case on provides 40% of their revenues, that’s extremely significant. They’ll appeal next year and lose, but that’s a year away. In the meantime, it’ll be a negative but won’t kill the company. They’ll adapt and continue on. There’ll be a negative affect and it’ll linger, until/unless they come up with something new. It hurts the stock though, when you’re a big company, and your main drug that provides 40% of your revenue is not going to be providing all of that revenue any more, well, you’ve gotta figure something out. IMHO this stock in the rest of 2020 should fluctuate between $180-$300 which will be quite volatile for this stock..."
look for 50%+ drop on Monday
315 to 320 by Friday's close. 10% run in a good day.
If todays reaction is positive. Would share price rocket today or on FDA approval?
Aducanumab will get approved whether you like it or not !

"""Eli Lilly is presenting data Saturday that bolsters its claims that its experimental Alzheimer’s antibody therapy slows down the disease in early-stage patients, results that the company’s top scientist says can only be attributed to a “successful drug.”What’s more, the top scientist, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, maintains that the trial validates the once-battered theory known as the amyloid hypothesis—a theory that was the foundation for a string of disappointing Alzheimer’s drugs...""Barrons"
"Biogen didn't hold above $259 but that was largely market forces rather than the stock itself .. Technically and on daily frame, $255 is an important threshold to establish now to be followed by $260 but more critical is to hold above $268-270 price .. The Money Flow index, crucial indicator, is showing ""signs"" that the worst is behind us and its well supported by both Wm%R and CCI .. MACD & Full STO still didn't confirm positive signals although seem close"
"Biogen (BIIB) Or ABBVBiogen received a major setback when it lost a patent dispute with Mylan (MYL) for blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. This means that Tecfidera might now face competition from generics. Tecfidera accounted for 40% of Biogen’s product revenues in 2019 and 42% in the second quarter of 2020.On August 19, Mylan announced the launch of its first generic to Biogen’s Tecfidera. However, it is a launch-at-risk since the litigation between Mylan and Biogen is ongoing.Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said that he is ""incrementally cautious"" on Biogen following the launch of Mylan’s generic version to Tecfidera. Raymond has a Hold rating for Biogen with a $270 price target.There has also been controversy with regard to Biogen’s potential Alzheimer's drug aducanumab. The company had discontinued the development of this drug in March 2019 as it failed to prove effective in treating Alzheimer’s in phase 3 clinical trial. However, Biogen changed its stance on aducanumab in October 2019 and said that the earlier analysis was incorrect as it was based on a smaller dataset.On August 7, the company announced that the FDA has accepted Biogen and Eisai’s license application for aducanumab with priority review.Meanwhile, Biogen delivered better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter. Biogen’s second-quarter revenue rose 2% Y/Y $3.68 billion. The quarter’s adjusted EPS rose 12% to $10.26.Tecfidera revenue increased 3% Y/Y to $1.18 billion. Sales from spinal muscular atrophy Spinraza rose only 1% to $495 million perhaps due to increased competition as Novartis’s Zolgensma was approved last year. Overall, Biogen’s total product revenues declined 3% to $2.80 billion, including a 7% fall in biosimilar revenues.But, Biogen’s second-quarter top-line benefited from $208 million in Ocrevus royalties from Roche, which increased 14% Y/Y. Also, other revenues rose 155% to $408 million mainly driven by revenue from the licensing of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property to one of the company’s corporate partners. Biogen stock has declined 6.0% year-to-date. An average price target of $316.05 indicates an upside potential of 13.3% in Biogen stock. The Street has a Hold consensus that breaks down into 10 buys, 16 Holds, and 3 Sells.So, AbbVie or Biogen?AbbVie’s higher debt levels and lower operating margin compared to Biogen go against it. But, it is notable that AbbVie rewards shareholders through dividends while Biogen makes no dividend payments. AbbVie has an impressive dividend yield of 5.0%.Overall, dividends, strong sales growth prospects supported by Allergan acquisition, analysts’ bullish stance and higher upside potential makes us choose AbbVie over Biogen."
All those shorts just to ask about CEO salary and compensation reasonable to ignore how profit the company is right now??? Noob funds

I like the collaboration. That will be key for BIIB moving forward.
Interesting
"So...according to consensus, if Biib doesn’t buy someone fast it’s not worth investing in. Should I stay or should I go now...any ideas who they should buy?"
"If Biogen gets eventual approval for its AD drug, does that mean that the months of advertisements posted as news about the hyped class action lawsuits is only fake news meant to manipulate the markets and us?"
"Mylan in a statement that it has received final approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its ""abbreviated new drug application"" (ANDA) for this product, which is indicated for the treatment of dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and the treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease."

"Celgene buying Biogen, load up."
Biib to 400 in two months
Alzheimer drugs don’t not favorable coverage in Europe regardless and they are more stricter in approving medicines that will not improve significant quality of life but add financial burden on already strained healthcare system! It is true already for current medicines for he Alzheimer medicines! So what makes so different for this one while studies don’t support the benefits unanimously!
huge volume on the downside Wait until it flags green on big volume
Is it at bottom or not yet ?
AH is crazy
"Please explain what banana pricing on this stock is doing?????? EPS high, PE low, growth great, STOCK DROP DEAD???????????"
"If you read the FDA report, you'll find that they have a strong case in favor of drug approval that totally disagrees with ADCOM.It is true that the FDA generally follows the committee's recommendation, but based on historical cases where the agency strongly disagrees with the panel advisor, they rarely follow his recommendation.See what happened to Tarceva, a lung cancer drug, in 2010. The advisory panel voted 12-1 against recommending approval for the wider use of Tarceva, but the FDA, as in this case, had a very positive position on the Tarceva and approved the drug anyway ... guess what ... FDA was right because today Tarceva is a successful drug that makes billions each year."
RVPH = takeover target for BIIB ?(RVPH) MCap $75 million /Float 2 m / Blockbuster in Phase 3 and many more in Phase 2 = 2000%++ upside Gem like SAVA its has even much better pipeline than SAVA ...GLTA
"300 holds nicely. By the time trump is sworn in, Expect higher. IMHO."
I have owned BIIB for years based upon the MS drugs. These drugs work and have improved many lives that deal with this illness. The stock has sold at a discount based upon earnings (PE 12) but when and if the Alz. drug is availiable this would add to earnings tremendously. This company knows how to price and market their drugs. For disclosure I sold a few shares yesterday at the higher prices and bought all of those shares back at the reduced share price today. The stock price will be dependent upon the upcoming results but if passed $400/share maybe low as the revenue stream would become very large with a buyout from a large phama also in the cards.

"Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai Co., Ltd.

Bag holders mass exit begins Monday. By the time the big institutions finish dumping their stock pre-market this stock will be down to 125 or more. A new entry point of 75 is about right.

"A $44b market cap with net $4b in tangible assets. So, book value of 10% of equity. And a patent cliff that is already behind them (meaning that when biosimilars are finally sanctioned, Biogen loses most of its revenues. And they have a very poor pipeline. BIIB should be trading at 50% or less of current."
Only red in my portfolio is alxn and this one. Weird!.
$500 load up ! The drug works imo
The rug is going to get pulled. In consistencies in the FDA documents.

"No wonder I'm confused. Which is it?Moving forward, Biogen said it expects FY2020 revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.2 billion, down from the prior guidance range of $14 billion to $14.3 billion. Wall Street expects FY2020 revenue of $13.92 billionorBiogen Inc.

"Hi Everyone, I am new in this forum and don’t know Biogen history pretty much. Can anyone tell me what caused the dramatic downfall of the BIIB stock price a year ago? Thanks a lot."
"This whole bio ride has been so hilarious... in March/April, the analysts were bashing every bio in sight and saying they were all #$%$ and the index fell from like 209 to 195. They kept bashing. Then the index broke support at 195 and went down to 189 for a day before bouncing back to 195... Ok, so now the index has run from 189 to 215 in short order. Keep in mind that it takes about $45M in total gains to go up 1 point, so we've gained about 1.1B in asset value. NOW the analysts are coming out of the wood work and upgrading all the bios left and right... Uh... you guys already missed the 26 point index run. I don't mind you guys helping push it higher, but just shows how useless analysts are."
"My worst subject in HS was math. I admit to having problems figuring out the numbers. My BIIB stock seemed a bit weak lately so I did some research. About a month ago, the stock was close to $370 as compared to $287 today. Three digit numbers intimidate me so I took off my shoes and socks to improve my computational power. After much work, I figured out that I have lost a fair amount of money in BIIB. I feel so much better now."
"I told you this is rubbish. Just a manipulation of data. Now for the last two days, many Biogen employees can cash in."
"Ever since that March 21st, 2015 spike up to 480 driven by Alzheimers ""cure"" hype, this stock is one to hold for short durations and only during a strong uptrend.

$300 stock!!!
There were a lot of shorts that got fried today. I'm taking profit but will be back long again very soon. This is a winner stock and damned good valuation as well!
bought today hope to sell tomorrow for profit
"who thinks new highs are coing today ,,, Monday?"
looks like some chasing is happening at the 225 level area. Yeh everyone want the low ...
"I don’t troll people, and likewise I don’t appreciate being trolled. Yesterday I posted that I opened a new position of 4 shares, and @joe calls me a putz, and told me to cash in my food stamps (what is the point in voicing how poor you think I am when we’ve never met?). I also saw that you deleted your post (calling me a putz), and I appreciate your attempt to protect your image. Well Joe, if you thought my 4 shares yesterday were cheap of me, I am guessing that you took a more aggressive approach to your position in BIIB. I am curious, how many shares did you Puchasing yesterday? Since I am such a “Putz“ for having the foresight to see the obviously impending analyst downgrades, defeated investor sentiment, and institutional mass exodus, I felt prudent to open a small position, to later purchase a larger lot after the sell-off, averaging down. Just stick to giving your opinion, instead of lashing out like a tiny tiger-boy.So seriously, why do you lash out"
who's pushing this down??? juno getting killed too. these shorts suck.
"IF APPROVED, WE SHOULD SEE $700+. IF NOT IT WILL NOT MOVE BELOW CURRENT PRICE SINCE AWESOME EARNINGS..SO RISK LOOKS LOW TO ME."

"With an FDA approval in their pocket, this stock should be soaring. I just can't figure this one out! Everything seems based on only approval of aducanumab!"
Has the company ever issued any time line on the new application to the fda on aducanumab?
Any thoughts on earnings and price action next week?
Be patient...wait on FDA
"Is Brian Skorney a ""GOOP"" subscriber....will his call be itself a deus ex Machina. We shall see....his words...his play...his call hangs on the tree of reality. What is his call now - like Steven Tusa (with GE) he may come out today and Monday just hammering this company with an onslaught of negatives driving to drive the stock down to attain his call...his own deus ex Machina....come on Bri Bri you were hired by Baird in 2013 to do your job lets see how good you are. I have no use for analysts but you deserve to have a chance to make it right. Boolean"
I’d sell in a heartbeat!
Last ER Clancy sold a bunch of shares as he was exiting (4/25) stock sold off from its 291 high with vengeance. I am hopeful we won't have to worry about this scenario this time around Sure would like to see this north of $300 again. Long time since we've seen this.
Stop the madness trading stocks by mass media. Look deeper than posts generated by short term traders and examine their agenda. We are all independent investors not lemmings. It’s no shortcut to productive assets.
I Say TIMMMMMMMMMMYou Say _____________
Thinking of adding 1 share tomorrow ! Any in put?
one year target is $380 on yahoo....whats up !!!
Thank you for the second chance. Added 400 shares to my long position.
I wonder how that Biogen collaboration with Anavex is going? Anavex 2-73 is a very interesting molecule and can help with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. I wonder if BIIB acquires AVXL down the road?
what news? why the drop today?
Biogen is just getting a question from panel members So far GREAT! The FDA is happy to approve adu!
"With nearly 20 billion in the bank, and a 200 million share float 100 dollars of the share price is purely their cash stockpile. there is no way this is going down to $150 unless management sits on each other's thumbs"
These so called experts are about as credible as election pollsters.

Why in the hell is ABT down? I know people that are getting tested multiple times! Doesn't make sense!
"Don't get me wrong. It is nice to see the company showing confidence in their stock with the news today. But it seems misplaced under the circumstances. They lost $20B in market because of one drug. They should try to shore up their pipeline and conserve cash for several acquisitions instead of recklessly spending it on buybacks. They already bought back billions in the $300s and that didn't work out too well. Having said all that, I still plan to buy this week after it settles down. Margin clerks will be active tomorrow morning as it is the 4th day after capitulation..."
"Bought back at 290 after selling at 330. Great P/E, selling overdone"
Watch others Monday who think this is the end and a negative decision and prematurely sell the stock. The FDA has the ultimate decision and this was just a committee meeting voting against 8 to 1. It may be months before the FDA itself actually decides. The politics of the decision will also come into play since this is the first medicine that might help a huge populace.

"An FDA presenter, a director, said 302 is a HOME RUN! He also said 301 SUPPORTS 302! He is very passionate about adu. He said he cannot reject a potentially VERY EFFECTIVE drug! Amazing! In my 30+ career, I have never heard such passion from the FDA!!!"

"As a BIIB holder, I bough RGNX too. The RGNX owns a big royalty on Novartis drug Zolgensma which will treat SMA type 1 with Zolgensma. So by owning RGNX you are hedged against any declining Spirnaza sales."

#$%$ I sold early!!
This is total BS to bring the price down. Some idiot at The Street wrote that BIIB will face competitor threats from Roche's MS drug approval which is BS. This is a win-win for BIIB. They make money both on sales of their own MS drugs as well as with Roche whom they co-partnered with in the way of royalties. The SEC sits idle while this misinformation is fed to investors! ggggrrrrrrr.

UNloved going into earnings.
BIIB is so cheap with today guidance of $32 a share in earnings for next year it’s trading at less than PE of 9 while MYLAN is trading at 29 with no growth. With shares buying back BIIB eventually will worth at least $500 in 3 to 5 years excluding AD drug . I believe its pipeline will keep Biogen around for decades.
Glad I sold BIIB at $373.50.........I thought its technology was faulty

In comparison to Amgen and Novartis results it shows no worsening in cognitive function. Although the hypothesis of beta amyloid has been abandoned for the late stages of AD, most scientists in the field still believe that inhibitors of beta amyloid plaques could be effective in early stages as a prevention or as a very early treatment. If Biogen and Eisai could lay the groundwork for a preventive treatment of AD with this candidate, it would the only treatment on the market."

"AC Immune Announces Anti-Tau Monoclonal Antibody Entering Second Phase 2 Trial in Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease SJNJ, $BIIB, $LLY, $RHHBYLAUSANNE, Switzerland, Feb. 20, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AC Immune SA (ACIU), a Swiss-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, is recruiting patients for a second Phase 2 trial for an anti-Tau monoclonal antibody, known as MTAU9937A, RO7105705, in moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The same antibody, RG6100 (MTAU9937A, RO7105705), also is being studied by Genentech in a separate Phase 2 trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety in patients with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's disease. This anti-Tau monoclonal antibody was discovered and humanized as part of AC Immune’s collaboration with Genentech.AC Immune has several product candidates addressing the Tau approach, including: ACI-35, an anti-pTau vaccine partnered with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, currently in a Phase 1b/2a trial, a small molecule Tau MorphomerTM, partnered with Eli Lilly and Company, that is scheduled to enter Phase 1 in 2019; and a Tau imaging agent, partnered with Life Molecular Imaging (formerly Piramal Imaging), currently in Phase 2 clinical testing. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immune-announces-anti-tau-120000205.html"

Nothing .. but Very Low Volume Manipulation. Should recover fast
So whats the consensus beat on ER or not?
well...my confusion about why the stock suddenly turned down at the $330 mark has been clarified. Someone clearly knew what was coming....
Today BIIB is almost touching high of its trading range ~(270 low end) and ~(300 high end)(excluding good news days which temporarily sent it much higher).

$6 billion in stock buybacks and still have money for further mergers and acquisitions. Lots of drugs in late stage pipeline. Good conference call. Bullish.

Looks like a buying opportunity. I just invested another 5k When we make target that's almost 25%upside. I'm certainly not earning that sitting in the bank. Good luck. Buy the dips!!!!!!
this just shows you HOW novice I really am to think that THIS thing has gotten beaten up so much it has TO reverse is unfounded. It really looks like BIIB is finding VALUE here with low volitility That $100 haricut reflects the accounting for 12 billion dollar loss in revenue projected from that drug failure on a stock capitalized at 44 billion. Do the math 1/4 off the revenue stream= 1/4 off stock price. Markets are efficient in this case-- even with a conservative PE that implies they are a mature firm with stable current revenue income
Is any know about this pattern disputes about? Is who owns the right to the drug or rights to copy? Thanks in advance!

53 billions valuation....that's like insane. Even with an Alzheimer drug who will pay for it.
Didn’t Cassava Sciences have never before achieved in Alzheimer’s incredible positive results with their Tau reduction approach in their 2a study? Aren’t they backed by grants from the NIH and have been published in all the major Alzheimer’s peer reviewed journals?
Today news is recycled news since BIIB has been punished for this matter. If BMY does not make a deal with BIIB like other generic company then it will lose big time. BIIB will do OK since this has been a known fact and it was priced in already.
I was wondering the same thing about ARFXF. Thoughts?
What happened to all the acquisitions BIIB promised? All it did was buy one little drug. Same with GILD. They promised acquisitions too.

Why Barron's did not mention the Biogen Director bought more than $20 million of Biogen stock just last couple weeks ago. Just conspiracy to drive down the stock price.
For what it is worth I have a friend who was in one of the studies. He said when taking the drug Alzheimer’s didn’t get any worse.
"Just heard panel first vote was 7 NOs, 1 YES, 2 UNKNOWNnot looking good unless FDA ignore recommendations"
"This was overdone IMO. I never had a position in BIIB until today, I bought options at the lows for a snap back trade. Volume was incredibly heavy so I'm betting today was a bottom and capitulation. If I'm early I still think when BIIB reports earnings in April the stock bounces nicely. This event today has zero to do with current metrics and BIIB was not expensive on a PE basis even before this debacle. BIIB is around 8 times forward earnings. So a trade seems possible here. BIIB still has partnerships with other biotech companies on drugs that have potential. Plus it has in house drugs in development I think, i'm not all that familiar with BIIB's pipeline. One more point, BIIB could easily be bought out now by a larger company with deep pockets."

BIIB will soar in my opinion as soon as the FDA approves Aducanumab. I also believe they will win the appeal. I am confident the stock price will be in the range of $500 - $600 within the coming 2 years. This company's fundamentals are excellent. Low Risk High Reward investment.
It's dead. Good entry is 150

I see in some of these analysts responses a rather cocky attitude...looking more for the power of print and reaction than words of fact. Again, they miss the FACT about the COST OF ALZHEIMER'S and the FACT that the FDA has been authorizing a lot of meds not stopping a lot of meds...so why would aducanumab be dumped...I think NOT. Now I could be wrong but...I don't think so. Boolean"
FYI - New prize offers $2 million for finding key to Alzheimer’s in past research.https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/05/prize-alzheimers-past-research/
need a transformation acquisition: buy IONS. they already have big investment there and collaboration.
315 tommorow ? this is a great company.. why this sudden drop..
Down again due to manipulation.....
"FDA should approve. C'mon - if it shows any efficacy, it needs to pass. The bar is low. This is such a damaging disease and there little we can do right now. Also, if we dont, China will approve something. We want to be first."
"this guy is a bean counter. he did nothing to further science. this is insane. if he's still at worth, the other employees should shoot him"
Hard to believe this stock was $290 on April 25th. A whopping $45 drop on no news! Where's this ramp-up of Spinraza promised by the CFO during the cc?
BIIB CEO Bet on the wrong horse. They already have an MTA with Anavex Life Sciences for A2-73 for MS. They know it works. I also works for ALz.
I'm glad to be back in this stock.. Great day...more to come...
Anyone have any ideas as to which company could buy biogen?
$500 open 
BUY PTX - HUGE UPSIDE POTENTIAL

Very good! Halted!
We all should agree with AIKI ...that AMRN will be 300 dollar stock....but this is BIIB page
"Mike - Ponce de Leon began looking for the infamous ""Fountain of Youth"" back in 1513, and folks are still trying and trying to find something that will at least come close.Good luck to those exploring the benefits of NAD+."
"Consider this...if you were beginning to forget names, dates and tell the same story every 15 minutes; would you fight for access to take the drug???The FDA would too. Remember that when you are placing your bet. GLTA"
Is there going to be a trading halt tomorrow? I know smaller biotechs are halted during Adcom. Thx
"A bad day for BIIB,BLUE,CELG,REGN,AGN, and IBBHope tomorrow will be a better day."
Dead $....TXMD 
Why would any real investor sell here.
BIIB is up 4.91% to $292.18
Those abstentions probably means they were paid consultants for BIIB. No other reason to abstain from voting on a drug!
Only up AH because his royal highness opened a stake in BIIB. I mean really!? How hard is it to invest if you’re Warren Buffet? Just buy shares and then everyone buys in cuz of you win/win. Lol
"BIIB has 49 people comb through the data to come up with today's strategy. They have one failed study and one that passed. BIIB claims the failure was due to patients not being on the high dose for a long time. Even so, the failed study had patients getting worse mental wise. Keep in mind, these were two identical studies. Whatever improvement they saw was only minimal.I think the FDA will order up another clinical trial."
"I'm so tired of the options specialists manipulating the prices of options on BIIB. They arent even close to what the CBOE calculator says the options are worth- specifically the 22 Feb 320 puts. Under priced by almost 1.50. I'm filing a formal complaint with FINRA, has anyone else had this problem? They do it all the time."
wow.....maybe close over 360 today......365 next week..... would could be a hoot.
"It will not be Novartis, they just built a brand new Cambridge facility."
"I would like to sell, but my cost basis is in the single digits, and I don't like paying taxes.Remember, no one yet know what generates amyloid plaques & IF they are gene related.GL2ALs"
"the buyback is an good strategic move by BIIB, it stems the selloff momentum over the next 45 days and gives them a chance to stabilize the stock price"
"Bill Gates donated $50 mil to the Dementia Discovery Fund. He says he will follow this with another $50 million in “less mainstream” start-up ventures working in Alzheimer’s research, but hasn’t identified those companies yet. Time for BIIB to do some shopping imo!"
Over reaction and the stock been brought down a little too much here. Stock goes up to 250 in less than a month.
lost $20 billion in Market cap close to 30% of the company value in one month ? is that the alzheimer's drug market cap gone ? what hell is going on ? from 370 to 270 in one month and company just watching !!
LOL so now they are going to plow earnings into shares instead of growing the company? LOL
"SPINRAZA was approved by FDA in December 2016. Revenue from the drug in Q1 2017 was only $47 million but jumped to $203 million in Q2 on faster than anticipated adoption of the drug in the US.Both EU and Japan approved the drug in June. According to Ionis Pharma which discovered the drug and licensed the rights to Biogen, it is now also approved in Canada and Brazil, and marketing applications are currently under review in Switzerland, Israel, South Korea, and Australia.Last April, CFRA set price target of BIIB at $387 and projected SPINRAZA revenue of $300 million in 2017 and over $1 billion by 2019.Assuming fast adoption of the drug also takes place in EU, Japan and other countries, projected revenue this year shall already exceed $1 billion.Biogen may provide updates on SPINRAZA and its Alzheimer's drug ADUCANUMAB when it presents at Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference today."
"#$%$ show on Friday really necessary? Biogen has two late stage programs in stroke that aren't going nowhere, meanwhile true ? like DMAC are being cast aside. Diamedica #DM199 decreases mortality rate of Acute Ischemic Stroke by 50%, increases # of patient with excellent outcome NIHSS 0-1 by 85%, decrease occurrence of severe recurrent stroke by 85% yet no one noticed"
"Up today, and almost 2%?? What the heck is going on here?"
Apparently people are buying what everyone is selling cheap. This has not moved all day much with going on 15 mil shares.
"Read the Barron's article ""Biogen What Now!"""
"Well, nothing wrong here... its just the stock price is adjusting for the BIVV shares. When the BIIV first traded, BIIB was at 290 and BIVV was 45. Assuming there were no synergies in two businesses, when BIVV starts trading on 2nd FEB, BIIB can drop to 245-250. Anything more than that will be the upside of separation. Just my 2 cents..."
they get positive results and it's not good enough. geez. that's BS.
Shorts are gonna come in like they did for HMNY
"Looks like the safety rotation is in and we should see money rotate into healthcare, including pharma. Hopefully, Biogen has broken the 335 resistance level for a while. Next stop 340, I hope !"
It is oversold. They are making more than $25 per share this year and even at 10 times earnings and that come to $250 per share.

Only .06 difference in share net income
A HUGE RALLY to $250 tomorrow. MARK this post. $20+ gain Friday :)) go $BIIB
This will probably drop 4 points tomorrow. So much for a positive day.

"Seems negative? Is that correct? If so, it's going to drop hard.."
Funny to see the posters trying to scare everyone.Does that still work in chat rooms in 2020?Crazy!
down 2 percent over a bean counter.
Wonder with all that cash and virtually no debt when will they start a stock repurchase and dividend program? It will be competitive buy if they start it.
"Here is what I think could happen on Monday. I stress the word ""could"".Yesterday, my friend sold 2 sets of put options expiring on the same day. One was at $220 and the other one was at $240. $220 option expired worthless. $240 options got assigned. That means that someone believes the price is going to drop somewhere in between.Now, the reason why I stressed ""could"" is because this assignment is not really a clear indication of where the price is going to go. It is possible that whoever was on the other side of my friend's trade panicked and decided to get rid of his shares.It is likely that BIIB shares will open lower because of the negative vote on their drug, but I think it will open above $240, and even if they go lower than that it should recover pretty quickly. We are talking about solid biotech with plenty of other drugs, both being sold and in the pipeline.I bought my 100 shares at $295, but I traded it heavily since June enough to bring my cost basis down to $225."
Wow look at this... I'm in the black!

Biogen Bought Back About 9 Million Shares for $2.8 Billion in 2Q
I bailed today as well. Can't sustain any upside.
Had they raised revenues guidance rather than just adjusted eps we'd be looking at a whole different price action. Bottomline is this is still all based on an alz drug approval
Going to open $500 Monday!!! Get ready team! Free up some powder. This drug will be approved

shorts so Melo dramatic …
best thing to do now learn more about investing with green valley partners they helped make this drug.u can't invest in green valley because its a co.in china.so do some leg work it could really pay off when this drug is on the market in the us.and other countries.
light volume takedown....something up?
Gawd I love this company!!!
7/24 earnings then 7/25 ALZHEIMERS data...Exciting days ahead
Why do you think analysts had run to upgrade their PTs on the stock without waiting to adcom meeting vote? Because they know FDA is absolutely convinced that drug works and when that happens it's very dificulte to change their mind.
I don't own this stock but i have been in pharmacy for over 10 years--Not approving this drug would only be so that other pharmaceutical companies can keep generating money from their generics that work only for 3 months and then stop! I hope the FDA does not get fed free (bribery) money from other pharmas to stop this drug from coming out! Just saying--if they are unsuccessful in stoping this drug from coming out then look for Biogen to get bought out! Pump this stock to the moon!

"Just considering BIIB's buy back strategy, I wonder if we'll see some pretty serious buy backs before Friday or if they'll save their ammo to provide some support to the stock price if Friday does go as planned for management."
good news finally but maybe a buck or two. this dog is hurting.
Why is this getting creamed today???
Just sold my AMZN shares and will go shopping tomorrow. Double-topped imo! Maybe some more BIIB!

"check out abscf , for Alzheimer, before the news gets out at noon today"
Biotech = ugh
Nice bounce.
"This was on Fidelity: ...11:38 ET - Biogen (BIIB) down 1%, as the stock reverses from pre-market gain of 2.9%. Shares jumped before the open based on big sales beat for Spinraza, company's new rare disease drug whose 2Q sales were nearly three times greater than analysts forecast. Jefferies says the decline during regular session driven by a mix of profit taking, lack of long term guidance from management, and other factors. Also hurting the stock is that company didn't announce any new share repurchases, and signaled there may not be any coming in near-term. BIIB will shift capital allocation away ""from emphasizing share repurchases to prioritizing business development and investing for growth,"" CEO Michel Vounatsos says on conference call."
The shorts seem to be really working BIIB. Notice that there is always some negative news feed near the end of the trading day. Today is no exception: ...Kenneth DiPietro plans to step down as executive vice president of human resources!I don't even understand why this is so newsworthy since he's not a CFO or head of R&D. Just another ploy to bring down the stock imo!
"Under Biden. He has proposed changes in drug regulation that should help lower costs. For instance, he says he will allow international purchases of prescription drugs, and will impose price limits for new drugs."
Three hundred before you know it
BIIB should go private. High EPS with low educated analysts #$%$ about it?s drugs. Go private... It is ashame and ridiculous for these downgrades
Some doctors want more Data and that is fine.This was the reason for the AH decline. Study still proved reduction in PLAQUE. Drug will be approved..best of its kind. BUY the dip

"Alzheimers is an incurable condition. It is the result of a damaged gut flora buy the overuse of antibiotics and consuming antibiotic laced food. It is exacerbated by consuming industrial processed food thatis the majority of food at your local grocers. You are what you eat. Of course genetics factor in and give you more or less chance of developing this dread condition. But make no mistake, Alzheimers will never be resolved with pharmaceuticals."
Slide 56 tells all about effectiveness of the drug!!!
"Mylan's early launch of a generic of Tecfidera, Biogen's biggest-selling drug, will take a bite out revenue, but the biopharma has another potential blockbuster on its hands in the Alzhemier's disease drug aducanumab, analysts at SVB Leerink say. The analysts cut their Tecfidera sales forecasts for this year and next, but they reiterate their outperform rating on the stock, saying they believe the FDA will approve aducanumab, taking the shares much higher. The agency earlier this month granted priority review status to aducanumab, with a decision due by early March. SVB trims its Biogen price target by $8 to $342 to account for Mylan's early generic launch."
Alexion earned over $4 a share and trading pe of 28 while BIIB earned $32 and trading pe of 8. Well BIIB probably get a boost from Alexion buyout news on Monday
"Never try to catch a falling knife. Institutions still selling slowly there position.. this will go on for a while, any bump will meet a very strong selling force... the company pays 0 dividends so low P/E doesnt mean anything. It lost market credibility... expect another 30% decline... then eventually might get bought out"
Up From $40's a few years back. Relax.
"When they have to announce a decision is an important question. The FDA has no time limit and it takes however long it takes. While the stock could be halted until after the close, this would be unusual. And kind of messed up for all the option holders, though not illegal. The decision when to release the halt is up to the market makers.Alzheimers is a terrible condition and a one way trip for sufferers. Raymond James is correct that the drug could be more effectual. But no Alzheimers medication has been approved since 2003, and there is at least some evidence this one is effectual. Personally I believe today's meeting will be inconclusive, and BIIB stock will fall this afternoon. JMHO, I could be wrong. No one knows, not even the meeting participants.Disclosure: I'm an attorney with one put ($335 strike) expiring today. I do not practice in any area related at all to drugs or the FDA."
"VERY NICE ACTION Wed, Thurs and Friday both in Biogen and the Bio / Healthcare sector as a whole. Glad I averaged down on Tuesday EOD. Can't say for sure the bottom is in, but very nice action none the less."
Why would the election have anything to do with approval?
This is great news. The departure of the head of R&D means someone more capable is coming!!
Why is this thing getting pounded today? The news of a buyback is usually good for a stock.

"Anyone want to guess in an intelligent manner, how earnings will do?? This Nov is board meeting.... anyone think anything positive or new information will derive from it???"
At this point I just want to get back to $ 360 so I can dump my shares and break even. Never again will I invest in bio-tech stocks.
"Biogen and Eisai are partnered in the development of another potential Alzheimer's drug, Elenbecestat, which is entering Phase III trials. I am not sure however if this will be as pertinent part of the pipeine as the ditched drug Aducanumab. Not sure whether to hold or fold after this latest selloff. Seems overdone especially in light of the low valuation. PE is extremely low for a large cap biotech company imo!"
"Some analysts struck a note of caution, though. Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners noted that Eisai researchers created their own novel ""endpoint,"" or primary outcome, to determine whether the BAN2401 study was successful, rather than using a more common metric for Alzheimer's trials.

When Biogen presents the data on Alzheimer conference in late July. If its data is solid you are talking $500 stock in a heartbeat and taking out the all time high of $442and FDA likes what they see they will bring the drug to the market as fast as they can. Keep your eyes on BIBB.
Maybe BIIB will wake up and look at AVXL to fill this gap in their portfolio
Shouldn't Biogen benefit from BIVV acquisition? Would have expected stock to have been much higher today.
BIIB is down 7.01% to 294.19
How high BIIB would go up if its ALS drug gets approved short term and long term? I would say $200 up and $100 down in first minute
It’s down way more than other pharma stocks. My calculation of cash flows shows it should be valued around $400/ share
"Trump named ALS both at Davos & State of Union, Now Lily just failed, I'd bet more than ever before BIIB will be approved"
This BIIB board is dead. I hope my BIIB stock is not dead.
Dead money nothing else.

BIIB just upgraded from hold to buy at Thompson!
best day in a while. thought 240 was in the cards. still could be but at least a temporary reprieve.
"BIIB’s aducanamab is the lone survivor with one successful trial showed statistically significant improvement in AD patients. The second trial (Engage) did not because of intermittent dosage, longer titration and shorter exposure to high dose drug . AD patients are desperate and they want this drug as they can live independently for two to three years note than without the drug . Caregivers want it and the investigators want this drug. I believe FDA will approve this disease modifying drug out of compassion for the patients who are suffering from this dreadful disease . This company is generating over $7b free cash every year. The p/e is less than 11. Upside potential is unlimited if the drug is approved. Pipeline is very promising. Downside risk is limited and I am extremely surprised that more analysts are not recommending this company."
well BIIB amarin may be your way back to the top...don't be late to the party..swap 1 share for 1 share...major dollars down the road
"I don't get it!!! I'm pretty new at this, can someone kinda explain this drop? I would figure 20% increase in net revenue would be a good thing"

Some Analysts still believe it still gets approved eventually. There are a lot of pressure from patients were on this trial and they have said the drug helped them. On question 3 for the ADCOM about effectiveness of removing the toxic sticky stuffs which I forget how to spell them 5 said yes and 6 were uncertain which also proven this drug is working at some level. Anyway all institutions traders and fund managers will decide its stock price on Monday

Going to 250 by friday.
"Remember the March 21st, 2015 all time high was driven by similar Alzheimers hype. Look at the 5 year chart. That, however, had been building for a few months but the 10% gain that day was gone the next. Hard to guess whether this will hold at all since this stock has now a history of similar disappointments. I've a friend who's a neurosurgeon and he says Alzheimers is incurable."
I get stock market panic. But why is BIIB falling by more than the NASDAQ? I mean it's hardly an over valued stock with the forward P/E being under 10.
Any opinions on any cause for hope come April 24 (earnings date / call)?

Unfortunately this will be opening in the mid 250’s on Monday.
10xPE? Everyone else in industry is 20-25x PE. Even without AD drug this is still a great value play and should be 600.
222 stop 220 and try again 211 stop 205
Fair value is $400-$460. This is way undervalued. EPS has climbed for 5 years and share price has been sideways. This will take off

"The total size of MS drug market ($$$$) is second only to that of the RA drug market ($$$$) (i.e.Humira).The combination of the highly successful earnings report published yesterday combined with the TECFIDERA and TYSABRI presentation @ American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in Boston clearly demonstrates that Biogen is still ""KING"" in the overcrowded MS market space.There are over a dozen MS drugs currently on the market, and only 3 of them are oral.TECFIDERA is the world’s most prescribed oral therapy for MS."
Piper Jaffray continues to like the upside potential on BIIB pipeline with an overweight rating and a $280 PT.
Don’t panic with premarket drops. BIIB will earn $32 next year with all bad news recently excluding Aducanumabs. If you value investors BIIB is good company and if you can average out your price that would be great don’t sell at a big loss because it’s still 50/50 chance. FDA knows what they are doing they might agree with their peers when others don’t agrees.
Altzeimer trial news not all that clear? Wondering how long it'll take til 300/350.
I could understand this reaction if this were a small one-drug wonder pharmaceutical company but for a 50 billion market cap mature large company this overreaction is nothing short of ridiculous! Its not like they don't have other profitable drugs! Really???

"The fact is Alzheimer’s disease is related to aging, and despite billions of dollars being spent, there is no definitive way to distinguish someone with so-called Alzheimer’s disease from someone with severe brain aging. As such, “Alzheimer’s disease” is much more effective as a political/fundraising slogan than as a proper scientific concept. We would much more appropriately speak of “Alzheimer’s diseases” (plural) or “Alzheimer’s syndrome”.https://www.j-alz.com/editors-blog/posts/is-there-alzheimers-disease"

"""twofer"" just now on Fast Money when Alzheimer's drug approval. Are they nuts? The day of approval the stock doubles (then up 10 times in a year) -- and then imagine a drug that can prevent Alzheimer's with few side effects and every person on the planet would be taking it. What is so interesting about this drug is the amazing improvements on MRI of brain for those taking it -- how that relates long term is still out there, but.. just dreaming of course."
Unfortunately not a holder. Happy for you smart ones. This is great news for people suffering especially family members.
One if the biggest market cap pump and dumps in history lol!
Nice buy on Friday
This should end the amyloid plaque theory once and for all. BIIB was the last of at least three drug companies to fail with their drug candidates based on amyloid plaque. Investors lost a lot of money that will not be recovered anytime soon. The big losers are scientists researching AP as the causative factory in alzheimer disease. Those doing a PhD study are hosed. And of course those with the disease have lost out big time.
235-237 close is the setup

"Any intelligent opinions on Biogen earnings report Wednesday???? I think they will beat earnings though not by much, due to coronavirus....

How undervalued is BIIB as a biotech ? I own both DXCM and BIIB ...recently i'm selling more DXCM and buying more BIIB . BIIB has $14 B in revenue and market cap of $43 B with many products and a robust pipeline ...DXCM has $1 B in revenue and market cap of $38 B and only 1 product .if i put the same multiple on BIIB ..this should trade at $5600.

"FDA probably threw the data pile back at them, classifying it as junk after an initial review. There is no need to PR that the company submitted data for initial review. The company had all the time in the world to analyze and dissect data. Now another delay. Their data is no good. The reason for the delay is obvious. They can try hard, but approval is not happening.

"Amazing that Anavex cratered almost as much as Biogen did. Anavex did it on stellar news that implies likely success of their Phase III AD trial, Biogen did it on likely final rejection of THEIR AD drug. Even if they were two seprate diseases they were developing for that would make no sense, given the fact that Biogen's failure only underscores the importance and market-share implications of a successful 2-73 trial it is mind boggling."
Holy Cow! What just happened?
A share holding CEO doesn't announce they are leaving a company until a predecessor is found unless something unusual is going on which is typically an upcoming buyout. He's either being forced out or leaving as he knows he's about to make a ton a money with a buy out. Doesn't make sense to just leave without such a reason as he knows it could hurt him financially as the stock price could decline.

"Even if Alzheimer's drug is worthless, we already know where stock will go. It traded around $220-$240 before when it was thought to be worthless, but let's not forget that the last earnings report came out with ~$1 per share ABOVE estimates!That means it would have traded above that old range without Alzheimer's news. Besides stock trades at a P/E of 7 at that range. AND the company has a HUGE buyback!"

"As I posted yesterday, it's important (for longs) that BIIB closes above $278.50. In the absence of new news, technical factors will drive pricing though year end. Otherwise, there may not be real support until $270 or $265/share. I have a long vertical call spread on BIIB through December expiry at the $260-265 strike prices. So fingers crossed !"

This stock has had long periods of tanking... but there have always been bounces along the way. Never seen such a flat line down."
Overdone
"LLY can buy BIIB easily, 2 shares of LLY for 1 BIIB share, $360 takeover price."
"The silver lining for today is that volumes are not much out of line relative to an average trading day. Meaning, we are not seeing a ""rush for the exits"" for BIIB. This means that large value-based institutional investors will step in next week (after digesting and analyzing the data this week). I wouldn't be surprised if BIIB is around $235 by end of next week - assuming the IBB overall does well."
Not a shareholder but since BIIB is awaiting FDA outcome on Alz drug candidate has anyone looked at SAVA PII results just announced? Would appreciate any thoughts. Thanks in advance. GLTA.
This stock gets no love.
"We got scalped !!!! Tuff of hair, blood and flesh and it huuuurts! Not even going to mention the loss of hope for our senior population.Wow... what a bleepin head fake. Worse than an overhead smash at Wimbledon tennis court.Any positives? Any ? Perhaps the biotech ETF indexes still have to buy so there should be a slight rise this week."
"Huge over-reaction on LLY's Alzheimer drug fail. I could see MAYBE a 5% pull down on BIIB, but 8%+ won't hold up. Alzheimer drugs are a long shot to make it through Phase III and are generally not built into the stock prices. Heck, this wasn't even BIIB's loss. Granted, Aducanumab is a long-shot, but they are getting punished like their drug failed. I'll hang tight with BIIB and wait for Nusisernen to face the FDA results and the spin-off. (I think) BIIB should be a nice Q2 2017 performer."
below 100 by friday after the massive head fake rally
Who is buying $6 million dollar blocks in after hours . That seems like a buyback to me .
"I see BIIB in the same boat as where Celgene (Celg) was prior to the announcement of being acquired by Bristol Myers (BMY). Both CELG and BIIB were of similar size. Both had a major drug trial fail (BIIB in Alzheimer's; Celgene in Crohn's disease). Both have strong pipelines outside of the singular fail. Both had their stock prices crushed from that one fail. I think acquiring BIIB would make a lot of sense for a company like J&J, Merck, or Pfizer. The Board of Directors at BIIB would sign-off on any deal at or above $310/share (biotech firms sell at a typical premium of 40-to-50%) given that the public markets seem unwilling to price the company at fair value in the foreseeable future. A $310/share price would still have BIIB at just 10 times forward earnings (and around 13.4 times trailing 12 months earnings. This is a great deal for shareholders at Merck, JNJ or Pfizer that are all valued at close to 15 times forward earnings. With some reasonable cuts on Biogen's SG&A costs, any of these three potential acquirers could make a Biogen acquisition accretive to earnings (EPS) on a forward 12 month basis. Opinions on my line of thinking?"
Brian Skorney of Baird - ok....he has a like a 59% success rate....I just guessed heads/tails and was 67%. SO I guess you have my point. To trust an analyst like Brian is not your most useful investment guide. No....I have no plans on selling based on...THE BRIAN. Boolean

"Not over yet. Suspect initiation of another trial and continuation of suspended trial will be advised/ and decision by FDA delayed. the 78‐week, phase III registration trials of ADU -- might have been too short to show anything of significance. Especially as those enrolled in the trials are already showing elevated Aβ by PET imaging (meaning damage already done). I would like to see patients at high risk for dementia but no damage on PET and no cognitive deficit receive this drug over a 5 year period. My guess is there would be a subset of people with dramatically decreased cognitive impairment. UP TO 50% of 80 year old show some sign of dementia****. When I looked at the initial study and MRI images of pt's on this drug I was blown away -- in 40 years as a physician I have never seen anything so amazing and hope we don't walk away from this yet."

The CEO of Biogen is very positive about their own AD drug and he even talks about investment in manufacturing the drug for the whole world. I think he is know something more than we know especially he bought even more shares lately that shows he has a lot of confidence in the company overall.

"from private investor and Avxl blogger Peter Karol, hot off the press, a new article.his Conclusions:""In Conclusion$BIIB is picking and choosing studies and group of patients, and with the exclusion the fast and furious down the 6 feet down slide and at 3,285 patients much can be claimed.If the claim that the blinding of the study has been compromised and the fact that on qualitative and subjecive measures Aducanumab improved most the we can stipulate that the CDR-SB was affected by this.The improvement in MMSE scores puts in doubt the scenario of significant efficacy as applying the same criteria to Blarcamesine trial Phase2a gives 5 fold advantage over Aducanumab to Blarcamesine.The above point was made in face of assumed average initial MMSE score for Aducanumab of 27 point versus that of 22.5 for the Super Responders of Blarcamesine. Relatively healthy vs. Already diseased and rescued.Starting with almost healty subjects (MMSE scores 24 to 30) might distort the trial as the fast deteriorating patients are excluded and the duration is only 18 months. See illusration above.The incidence of ARIA still present vs. almost none on Blarcamesine side.Just another attempt to rescue the amyloid hypothesis for Alzhiemer’s on closer examination doesn’t hold water.The simplest expalaination of Aducanumab strategy is to remove the worst offenders and still compare to placebo arm containing those worst offenders but your claim rests on the fact that relatively healthy rest of the dosed arm do not start to deteriorate untill much later."""

Great...now up to what it was 6 years ago ..
BIIB will not have any significant move until Aducanumab picks up some exciting. This is a potential game change drug with peak sale anywhere between 5 to 20 billions. So far it looks promising. One year have has passed by since it entered into phase 3. The earlier phase results looked very exciting. The improvement on the key biomarker - clearance of amyloid deposit - is beyond any doubt. The two cognition measurements were also significant although not as remarkable as the biomarker. It is most likely due to belated effect on these two measurements. It looks like Biogen will have read-out data some time next year (the trial will not be finished until 2020). This will probably be the most anticipated event in drug industry
FDA does not have to follow AdCom opinion and can still approve the drug
"Biib , is becoming so corrupt."
I bought 100 shares at 223 a share today...I also bought axsm which looks really good
So its down around 100 pts -- it's only money !Give it 2/3 years and it may go up.The sun always shines. Have a nice day.
When people realize that Biogens Alzheimer’s treatment does not even work and most definitely will not be FDA approved this stock will drop like a rock again like it did when they said it was futile to continue with the product that is now being “fast tracked”...Mark my words!
We might get a bump up at 254. JMO
"Great ER and guidance--that is all needed, although some people still doubt. Bottom line is BIIB still is a cash cow///"
Lot is this is short covering!!
Biib may well be the biggest hated stock on WS. Management is weak and screwed over the investment community big time by putting out erroneous trial results that they later flip flopped on $80 losses to hedgies and tutes and when they returned to the scene of the crime it was about getting a pound of flesh--which they now love to get. Stock and shareholders continue to pay a very big price for poor management decisions that have amateurishly inflicted pain on an unforgiving street.
Make or break day for BIIB. When does the report come out?
"$24.80 EPS per this summary tab . They don’t show EPS metric which is simply $265 stock price and divide that by earnings of $24.80 give 11.0 EPS a fastest stat . ( most stocks can’t compare to this because their earning are tiny or negative yet they sell way over this multiplier of 11.0 . Can someone help me understand why the summary tab her on yahoo is not showing this attractive EPS ratio .. just showing “N/A” . Also inspite of this pricey stock value of $265 , it would appear to be a bargain even if they don’t get FDA approval on Alzheimer’s .. do you concur?"
"It just dropped a few min under the moving average, I took profits.Goodluck everyone!"
"Volume is not that high for the % drop. Only 11% of float traded. I usually buy on 3rd day after capitulation. As long as it is at or below these levels on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning, I shall buy for a 10% profit...."
Double beat and raised guidance. Should be a good day. Congrats longs!
So logic goes there is a healthcare scare and healthcare stocks... Drop like a rock!! You can tell markets are computer driven and have no real base of logic... All algorithm driven. The GOD'S have spoken and say it is a casino. Boolean
Is the FDA meeting for their Aducanumab in June or July....I own SAVA not BIIB
Why this stock is moving up after hours? Any news?

why are we up this morning ?
See IHUB post # 222115 stating AVXL news better in Alzheimers than BIIB.
why is it down ah?
aducunamab is still not over...Biogen is still preparing for launch...FDA confidently came out in the support of Aducunamab...FDA came to Biogen to submit the trial result after Biogen stopped the study...it may be painful till March but we definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel...have patience and keep faith...
"SEC needs to ban algo trading where computers sell to other computers and go back to humans buying and selling. Destroys wealth in seconds, for no reason at all. Soon investors will shun the entire market."
It’s a joke! Morgan Stanley maintained BIIB underperform with price target $211.
Seems like FDA is dragging its feet to see LLY data first before killing biib drug for good. Careful; mid March
+ or - earnings?
Fall and winter is almost here and there will be jumps in BIO medical stocks. Why BIIB still getting short? I wish shorts will be in debt or bankrupt when fall and winter comes.
I think the new CEO buys AVXL as his first acquisition.
You guys should be all over Sarepta SRPT SRNE and CMG.
$180 in next couple weeks.
Looks like a buy sub 238 sell above 330
Be interesting to see if any insider trading sales were made on Thurs
"All the daily calls for class action lawsuit are really advertisements masquerading as news! You would think Yahoo would label these as ads, and spare us the attempts at manipulation. Biogen is not responsible on how the FDA releases news."

"This is not the first major drug company to give up on a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The entire medical system relies on disease and sickness to generate profits. This is why there will never be a cure for any of the major diseases and afflictions. Development of drugs is nothing but a smokescreen designed to keep the fires of hope burning and keep the prices of drug companies rising. Today's action in BIIB is the perfect example. The stock will likely come back based on the next great hope for a cure of something. The cure for this and many other diseases lies in lifestyle changes and the use of supplements. These diseases usually arrive after many years or decades of environmental poisoning, the lack of nutrients and a lifestyle that destroys the body over time. Anyway, sorry to see this happen where a stock gives up so much in a day. But the market makers have done very well I bet."
$315? misprint?
There seems to be support around the $320 level range. Lets see if that holds in the regular session tomorrow. It'll take the market a couple of days to figure out the likely timeline related to the Mylan patent ruling. I'd be surprised if there's a material impact to 2019 earnings.
Let’s go!

anyone want to guess what it closes today?
Surprised this stock is above $260 from those results.
It will be 350 by end of year
I think the drop to $320 was likely the result of the patent news. I think the next 6 bucks is likely a function of the NASDAQ swoon. I think BIIB should be over $320/share by this time next week - assuming of course this isn't start of another market correction triggered in the wake of the collapse in the trade talks with China.
I went to Twitter they saying fda votes no
test
"Can't believe it is so quiet here.Aducanumab p3 result will be out at the end of the next year or a couple of month into 2010. It is worth to wait. This drug showed great promise by an early stage trial. It is the biggest hope of AD drug. It it failed, there would not be an Alzheimer's drug in next 10 years. The amyloid theory is supported by strong pathology and genetics evidences. The only miss connection is a drug based on the theory. Aducanumab represents the new generation of the drug target amyloid. It is different from previously failed drugs. I am confident that it will be success."
People know to fade this.
Bought 15 shares of this trash. Upupup
"“When informed of redosing , every AD patient and every family was excited and there is overwhelming desire to go back on the drug” this says it all about the efficacy of Aducanumab. The redosing study is being started for humanitarian reasons with FDA’ s blessing . Buffet’s investment is an affirmation ."

Time for everyone to come over to SAVA. Breakthrough Right to Try status soon on their AD that actually works!
Everyone do your self a favor and go look at AVXL while you can.
at what point is this in play? they are down around 53 billion and headed lower. who would be the logical partner?
Old article: https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-plans-regulatory-filing-aducanumab-alzheimers-disease
"I'm not a conspiracy theory believer type person, but the biib price action this past month makes one question how our stock markets truly work. I had purchased two hundred shares before the Aducanumab announcement. Of course, I was pleased at the news and hoped for more share price increase. Instead, down, down, and more down. Why does the good news and poor price action feel so manipulated? I don't think of myself as being naive, but a whole bunch of people have been dumping shares at lower and lower prices."

"I am probably stating the obvious, however the news about Biogen's agreement with Alkermes is purely defensive in nature, intended to loosing market share.However, and perhaps more importantly, it is NOT an offensive move on Biogen's part.As I have posted over and over, they having been paying a lot of ""lip service"" over the years to actively pursuing M&A, in order to be more diversified, and less dependent on the MS market space.BUTT..... actions speak louder than words. JMHOAt least Gilead has taken some calculated risk/reward analysis and bot Kite, in order to expand into the CAR-T cancer space."
Sold a May 15 call at $305 for $900 assuming price is flat for a while because of delay on Alzheimer’s drug.

UBX will be the big winner in age related Diseases !
Biogen should buy SAVA as soon as they can if cassava sciences will even sell to them. BIIB better be ready to pony up $5 billion for the buy out now... it would make all the Biogen longs very happy. Everybody already knows that Biogen‘s current AD treatment is DOA at the FDA. Biogen still has a chance to save their company since several of their other products are failing or generics are taking over their market share.
Buy now. Someone got confused with MERK and everyone is sellling randomly. Good time to get some more. .
"Why drop now?? Tech is so high, BIO medical already bottomed many times. BIO shouldn’t drop. Tech stocks are overpriced."

"Biogen is being pushed down then bought up by institutions to reap rewards when Biogen acquires FDA for Alzheimers treatment... Biogen is very undervalued, ( longterm investor) with its strong revenue and low P/E this company should easily be trading in 350-370 range, that w iij thout FDA approval, when the get approval for Aducamaub, should trade 460-470... by up on dips as the institutions are doing so."

"I have been a shareholder for the past three years, I’ve seen the roller coaster of this stock.. Currently have a substantial portion of my stock holdings is in Biogen. If you examine Biogen earnings and Extremely low PE, you can recognize that stock is very undervalued. This stock should be trading in the 325-335 range, just alone on the earnings and that would bring it PE more in line to other competitive companies...Biogen has many drugs they are working on besides Aducamaub. People are so forcused in Aducamaub that Biogen is trading at a discount. If Aducamaub does get approved then the stock will go to low 400’s. In my opinion, I think it will get approval from FDA with some conditions. Since there are no drugs out in the world to treat Alzheimer’s, this drug Aducamaub is a start to help slow the process down...Biogen should go up gradually, far to cheap for a 15Billion dollar company with a PE of 8..."
going to wait for the 1130 push
I don’t understand why the share price dropped. I read significant improvement in the reduction of the plaques in the brain. This is over an 18 month period. AZ is a chronic disease if there is a reduction in 18 months imagine the reduction over 3 years. Next imagine the cash flow over the remaining lifetime of those on the drug. No other drug has had positive results in reducing plaque. I got into Biogen at 260 and out a few times. I only own a few thousand but I’m not selling. This could be the buying opportunity of a lifetime. I would love it if it went down to my cost basis so I could buy more. IMHO. GLTA longs tomorrow let’s see where we stand a few months from now when the results are actually thought about.

"Nice day today, on higher volume. Nice bounce off of $246. We didn't hold onto the day high, but let's see some follow through for the rest of the week. We all know this can be -$7 tommorow :(."
"As i said entry price will be at $137! All institutional holders are selling slowly. This will on on for a while. Nobody wants to buy, no new drug on the pipeline. Much better oportunities out there... BIIB lost markets trust it will be a very long time to regain it"
Any chance that biogen would buy Serapta
$BIIB (BIogen) which is also developing Alzheimer drug is $267. This should be at least $200 with it's Phase 3 Alzheimer drug development. Over $400 after approval.
what is going on
"FDA forced a recusal of one panel member who was going to review the BIIB/ESALY Alzheimer's drug due to his public criticism of it. Studies proving efficacy have shown mixed results, but the longer term data esp. at higher doses for 10 mo or more, looked better."
"I'm hoping for a huge drop so I can buy more. BIIB is not going away and let the day traders sell out in panic. Just got put at $235, so if closes below that I'll just keep adding"
Prerecorded FDA and Biogen Presentation for ADCOMhttps://www.fda.gov/media/143508/download
"We're lowering our Biogen fair value estimate from $385 per share to $327, following the failure of phase 3 Alzheimer's drug aducanumab. The valuation impact was partly countered by our inclusion of the pending acquisition of Nightstar, which brings two ophthalmology gene therapy drugs into Biogen's pipeline. We have removed aducanumab and BAN2401 from our valuation, and had already removed elenbecestat (still in phase 3) from our model. We do continue to include a 25% probability of approval for tau antibody BIIB092 in supranuclear palsy."
This is insane !
The FDA committee reviews the data and makes a recommendation then it is submitted to the regulator to make the decision. I don’t know the timeline on this.
lots of laughs.......biden will lower drug costs?......lets see....clinton did....bush did.......obama did.....trump did....they should be paying us when we get a scrip filled.......... biden had 50 years....the drug cos got richer and richer every year...............and they will be richer at the end of the next four
Altz drug is really big thing. Would be best drug discovery for last 30-40 years...
I hold call options on BIIB. Will they adjust after spinoff?
"A couple years from now AMRN will be bigger than Biogen , Need to Buy it out"
I get the feeling someone is trying to flush out retail...and accumulate.
"Regarding ADUCANUMAB, is Biogen waiting for FDA approval at this stage, or are they working with the FDA to resubmit the application? I know they withdrew the study/application last year, then found positive data in a deeper examination of the data. So I'm trying to ascertain where the filing sits at this stage: Waiting for FDA approval or working to resubmit the application?"
"I am a long time investor ( years not days / months), also buy on the dips like now... I realize people are trading but, I can honestly say from a valuation standpoint, Biogen is very much undervalued ( yes I realize I'm bias considering I own shares) but if you do the number crunching ( numbers don't lie),the stock should be trading in the range of 360-370 bv based on their earnings, projected earnings, PLUS the potential approval of their drug Aducamaub which will increase revenue drastically. Along with many other drugs in the pipeline. If and when (a few months) Aducamaub gets approved the stock should shoot up to 540-560 range... The stock will increase as get closer to approval date. This is the reason I'm acquiring more shares."
Don’t think you will get a better chance to buy puts than this. The $250s later this year are “on sale”.
+$20/share gain since bottoming out at $216 what a rebound in 2 days
"Is there anyone who can interpret what BIIB CEO stated in the MS conference on September 14, 2002? The CEO was not articulate at all.Matthew Harrison:And I think as part of your acceptance press release, you indicated the FDA is working to potentially accept or assess the filing even faster than that prior year review timeline. I don't think I've seen that kind of statement in a press release before. Can you maybe give us some context for that, or did the FDA explicitly tell you that, or is that something you picked up based on a dialog?Michel Vounatsos (BIIB CEO):I guess, and this is a guess that the U.S. FDA is mentioning that potentially if there is an opportunity they we seek for the acceleration. I cannot speculate on that.

"watch out for a bodacious reversal! shorts going all out for you to sell, desperately.when wall street sentiment improves, OVER 300 very quickly. PE implies a grossly oversold situation. buy and hold this puppy for mucho gain"
Why biogen p.e is so low ?Can someone explain it ..do i miss something ...?
@Sandi I found no support on your statement.

"Get ready, any day we will start to run higher going into ADV board date of 11/6. Stock will be above $300 real soon. If the board recommends the drug for approval $500 to $600 within a week or so"
Will the $300 hold for open? I sure hope so
"I could see one jungle bunny came out and posted thumbs down, I'm sure more will come out, as none of the jungle bunnies will ever admit about stock manipulation,but actual results never lie,Bam,Bam,Boom."
Falling knife syndrome. 260 is in sight.
Why BIIB dropped today?
WTH? Awesome beat in eps.
yaikss!! closing my shrt #$%$.. somebody wants to buy a BIG chunk
Not just hope making money with BIIB also hoping this drug will help a lot of people and their families from this devastating disease. Good luck to Biogen.
At the current price Biogen will be able to buy back 10% of their shares for $5B. Their EPS will definitely go up and the PE will be down
"I just cannot believe the downgrades and reaction to news that generic Tecfidera will be on the market maybe by 2024 or even later.I'm done. They are objectively insanely undervalued. They make money hand over fist, but people would rather buy companies that burn money, buy retailers that are closed, or buy companies in bankruptcy.Biogen will be dead money for the foreseeable future, as they have been for the past 5 years. Shame."

There is a very high chance this gaps down sub $100 tomorrow. Stop losses will not save you. This will be one of the biggest long squeezes in the history of the stock market.
Does anyone else ever read (http://Trade-view.com)? They just mentioned BIIB this morning.
Check AVXL and phase 2/3 on Alzheimer’s. It seems BIIB has a real strong competitor. A very small biotech company.
was up 5 bucks in AH. no news
Trash but still holding
wow!!
$19 billion market cap erased because of 1 failed trial is overdone
What are some reasons to buy this on the dip? What other things make this company valuable?
ADU will be approved!!!!!!
"Boogeyman is going around and collecting all option premiums that we took out of your account, some good vintage will be open tonight on all of your behalfs, Booyah."
Wall Street analysts upgraded BIIB to buy with target price $300: just be alert!
"witching time alwey has wierd stuff; my GUESS, bak to normal next week! "
Can we be one of the next bio stocks that blows through the roof for no reason at all next week?
I love stocks with a smooth linear slope each day after a big crash. BIIB fits that description perfect.
"GET OUT NOW, IF YOU STILL CAN"
"I repeat my target on this. 150, and sure under 200."
"did anyone read that Beerstein downgrade from this morning? It's laughable at best....an analyst named Gal surmises that Biogen will lose an MS patent, that will reduce next years revenue by 20%. Does this person think we were born yesterday? I think a better explanation is...his bosses told him to implement this downgrade, for other reasons....possibly making cheaper shares available. I don't believe anything Beerstein says, because it never seems to reflect whats really going on. In my view...it looks like this stock is being attacked from all sides, to make cheaper shares available...and some quick short money. In my humble view."
Hey Shep..I know you lost millions on the drop..but I made thousands after.. I bought 200 shares at 219 and sold at the highs yesterday. I kept 50 shares to let ride...I'll buy back possibly if it dips but too risky here..imho
Why BIIB is down today ?
Appeals court holds lower court's dismissal of investors suit against Biogen. A bit of good news is always welcome.
"You guys should be ashamed of your DD finding this pig that has gone from $278 to $278 from 2013 to 2021. This is no doubt a great bio companies for many, but a disaster for investors. Why would anyone stay invested, except if a bag holder."

This is not BIIB specific. The whole sector is down. JNJ started the selloff today with weak guidance and missing on top line. They cited the strong dollar and this spread fear that others will follow suit. ISRG reports after the bell. God willing they will beat and bring confidence back. This stinks with Dow up 140 and healthcare stocks all getting slammed regardless.

BIIB will have a surprise news soon! Great time to buy now!!
BIIB fair value is $28/share.

It plans to initiate a first in human study, scheduled for the second half of 2018. The new compound is highly selective for alpha-synuclein aggregates, an established target for Parkinson's disease and other diseases with alpha-synuclein pathologies (referred to as synucleinopathies in general). New data will be presented at the AAT-AD/PDTM* Focus Meeting 2018 in Torino, Italy, today, March 15, 2018.Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, said: ""We are excited about this significant step in our development of potentially the first ever PET tracer for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This important milestone underlines our vision to become a global leader in precision medicine of neurodegenerative diseases, leveraging our proprietary technology platforms.""This next generation tracer was discovered using the company's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform. AC Immune has been successfully collaborating on this program with Biogen since April 2016. The companies will continue to further research, develop and clinically validate this alpha-synuclein PET tracer that will be used as an imaging biomarker for Parkinson's disease with an aim to enable the clinical development of new disease-modifying therapies. This project from AC Immune is being supported by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF).Jamie Eberling, PhD, Director of Research Programs at MJFF, commented: ""We are very pleased about this next important step in the development of an alpha-synuclein imaging agent. Having a PET tracer to detect and track Parkinson's disease would be transformative for Parkinson's research and patient care.""In summary :The companies will continue to further research, develop and clinically validate this alpha-synuclein PET tracer that will be used as an imaging biomarker for Parkinson's disease with an aim to enable the clinical development of new disease-modifying therapies. http://cws.huginonline.com/A/171580/PR/201803/2176472_5.htmlhttps://www.acimmune.com/en/pipeline-overview/"
Gawd I hate this new Yahoo Finance format!!!!!!!
"interesting. ever since the Reuters report came out this afternoon that Biogen has not received any formal buyout offers, the stock has moved up about 5 bucks."
Alot of money should flow out of biibAnd go into sava Monday.Its a natural way to play it.
Minimum downside target is $200.
Heading to Over $300 ....we are going back...back to the Future.
Take some off the table here imo!
6 year low:(
$150 next??
man you guys lost a fortune
Ouch ! must suck to be a short rn they’re downvoting everything haha
"No reason of the fall, the eps keep increasing. Should at least go to $300."
Just got a nice tip from (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
Buying here. So oversold it is laughable.
What do you think the damage will be today?
Has anyone else heard a rumour that Roche is finally ready to acquire Biogen? I think first time this was spread around was 5 years ago. Wonder what is taking so long?
"Who sold this morning below 295? If BIIB can come through with Aducanumab, this will sky rocket - especially with Lilly now out of the way. Exciting couple of weeks ahead..."
CEO will be on CNBC today.
"Biogen is a decent company, but there is no way that Alzheimer's drug works. buying it at this price is gambling that political pressures will get it approved anyway."

Because the severity of Alzheimer's both in terms of financial and human cost I see no way that the FDA will have Biogen stop this drug -- the costs of that are way too high. My impression Brian/Baird - I submit that you once again are wrong. Boolean
Let's Just say...You have average analyst earnings estimates of 28.67 per share for 2019 and...29.39 per share for 2020 and..Let's just say that the PE ratio stays where it is at the conservative 10.79 we see today..Doesn't that make a 300$ stock price pretty much a no brainer??
Biden will give everything to everyone for free. No more working ...15$ minimum wage... wow.... where is the money gonna come from???
AVXL drug is way better
The FDA turned them down - voted against approval.
I'm calling this recent selloff the Clancy dip. Remember when he sold right into earnings release at $290 p/s! Numerous downgrades appeared following that event! Sure hope this gain will hold today! Management actions definitely can affect the price movement and sentiment.
Common consensus appears to be that Monday will be a bad day for BIIB. I’m not selling.
Aducanumab. Writing is on the wall now.
Shep came on our boards for years ..pounding her chest on how she picks winners like BIIB..LMAO .. KARMA?
Fast track means bad news coming sooner..FDA will reject BIIB Alzheimer drug because it does not work.
EVA Dimensions has a buy rating on BIIB and they sport a very high Starmine rating at Fidelity scoring system. I just don't get this #$%$ performance as late.
loosing steam...
"is it true that the panel was offended that the fda advisors prematurely released their favorable rating which drove the stock above 300, thus rejecting the drug just to drive the stock down for obvious reason"
Liking AVXL better .
Biogen really need to defend their stock values
"2. BiogenBiogen has already made one acquisition this year. The company closed on its $800 million buyout of Nightstar Therapeutics in early June. While the pickup of the small gene therapy biotech bolsters Biogen's pipeline, there are plenty of reasons why its shopping spree could continue.Sales are slipping for Biogen's multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise. The biotech's five MS drugs generate around 57% of total revenue. Royalties from Roche's (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) sales of MS drug Ocrevus help somewhat, but Ocrevus also hurts some of Biogen's other MS drugs. Biogen's total revenue continues to increase, with year-over-year revenue up 11% in the first quarter. That growth is being driven primarily by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza. The bad news for Biogen is that Spinraza now has competition with the recent FDA approval of Novartis' (NYSE: NVS) SMA gene therapy Zolgensma.Shareholders had hoped that Biogen's Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab would live up to its hype as a potential game changer. However, the drug flopped in late-stage clinical studies.Biogen still has money to spend on acquisitions, though. It reported $5.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of the end of March, although the total didn't reflect the cash spent on the Nightstar deal."

All the bears are out in full force today on biotech! I think buying opportunity
"If today's more than 4% drop is about pfz's decision to terminate its AD program, it would be a clear indication how terribly biotech investment community informed themselves about Alzheimer's drug development. As I posted previously, pfz's drug has nothing to do with much anticipated Aducanumab phase 3 trial. The phase 1b results of Aducanumab was very impressive and the recently released extended 1b data further confirmed it. More importantly, This mAB was isolated from healthy cognitive normal old people. It explains why those old people are AD free."
"Same old, same old. I'm outta here."
The executives needed to partner with SAGE for their anti-depression drugs after the whole aducanumab fiasco. Matter of fact...I could use a few pills myself. LOLLong on BIIBGLTA!

Really important that BIIB regains the $278.48 support level by the end of this trading week. Otherwise we'll be testing the $265 support level :(
The failure of Phase 3 of just 1 drug costs a big cap company stock for (BIIB's cap was nearly 80b before dropping) 30% decline. Somethig must be very wrong. How could a phase 3 potential drug worth +20 billion? What is it?
BIIB is up 7.03% to 305.00
From top Fib shows 150 a possibility
Trades very very poorly relative to the sector. Something not right
I my opinion the board members were put in a position to be defensive by the FDA coming out the day before with the positive assessment. The board seemed to fall back into a technical statical approach without regard to the complexities of assessing a negative (slowing of degradation of memory). Likelihood is that studies were too short in duration and should have never stopped in the first place to allow for a clearer distinction of outcomes versus the placebo.
"“Variability” could be interpreted in either ways, good or bad. Shares crashed hopes company can buy shares back at cheap before it going back up again."
this drug was 60% of future earning so I am thinking another 30% down before the turn around.
IF they offer for sage or excel we pop 30 points

"I found the Clinical Trials for Alzheimer's Disease program. The talks are Friday morning in San Diego. Both are Phase 1B readouts. 12m and 24m. Not phase 2. From Biogen's website: Update: Phase 1b DataPRIME is the ongoing Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical effects of aducanumab in patients with prodromal or mild AD.The placebo-controlled portion of the study included fixed doses of aducanumab at 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg and a titration regimen. PRIME also has a long-term extension for patients who completed the one-year placebo-controlled portion of the study.In a recently completed interim analysis from PRIME, efficacy and safety data were consistent with results previously reported. These data support the design of the ongoing Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. Biogen plans to share detailed information about these results at upcoming medical meetings."

Typically, a score of 24 or greater indicates normal cognition. A score of 19 to 23 indicates mild impairment. A score of 10-18 is moderate impairment. And any score below 10 is severe impairment.The average length of time someone lives who gets Alzheimer's disease is ~4.5 years if diagnosed after age 70. The average MMSE for people diagnosed with Alzheimers is around 24 to 26. These patients if not treated can expect their MMSE score to decline by 4.3 in the first 2 years. They would be more forgetful and start to forget some names and have trouble doing various things. In the next 2 years (4 years total), their MMSE would decline another 7.66 points. They would be down a total of 11.96 points. By this time, the average person won't be able to drive and will need someone to watch them. They are moderately impaired and can still do things on their own - just not complex tasks. They will begin forgetting who their friends were and won't recall common facts. Can't be trusted with their finances. In the next couple of years (total of 6 after diagnosis) if they live that long, the average person will become severely impaired and MMSE will have decline by 15.63. Can't cook, will start forgetting everything in their life. Quality of life near zero.Consider that in three years, Anavex 2-73 data for high concentrations show a decline of about ~ 1.6 and an even smaller decline in ADCS (Activities of Daily Living Inventory). A smaller drop in ADCS is consistent with the brain and person learning to compensate for loss of cognitive ability. I.e., learning to spend more time and think harder about activities, write down important things and etc., If the trend continues, by 6 years, their would be a drop of 3.3 and by 9 years, there would be a drop of 4.8.What does this mean? It means that the average person who gets Alzheimer's after age 70 who takes a high dose of AVXL 2-73 would be able to live out their life until death still remembering their life while being able to live on their own if they are otherwise healthy enough to do so.It is not a complete cure - but enough of one that people can keep their dignity until death.For those who have earlier onset Alzheimers disease (before age 70), on average they live 10 to 12 years.For those people, if not treated would end up needing comprehensive care after 5 or 6 years until death. They will live to forget their entire life.If AVXL 2-73 works as well on these type patients, they would have many additional years of good life and would probably still die remembering the majority of their life, friends and relatives."

Where’s all the clowns coming from pushing stock below 340?
Not going to go well today but would think more importantly is the upcoming FDA decision. Can't say I like the competitor fears taking hold. I like ALXN here better.
I have owned the stock for years (for MS treatment) but added more shares with the potential for Alzheimer treatment. I think today's news reinforced the potential and I think that the stock will continue it's climb. I expect analysts will now raise some SP targets. JMO GLTA

"Kind of unfair to halt trading like this, especially for people with options expiring today."
Checking out the charts I see this stock hit a 5 1/2 YEAR low today. Wow!
I actually like the internal promotion. I'm thinking a buyout may still be in the cards. think about what person outside the company wouldn't want to run one of the premier biotechs out there. who knows. regardless this is going above 300 in 2017 imo
check out INO your going to be very rich in the next 3 months..
"Most of the sell side analysts today don't seem to be very impressed.

So can generic companies just challenge a patent in state after state after state and if they win in one state they can then sell nationwide?

"I consider myself a sharp investor ( not trader). Have always invested in companies that had great Current and future products, ie:Biogen ... I am very puzzled of why the price of Biogen is. Just in May, Biogen was trading near $350-360. Biogen has great products on the market now, earnings $9 share, PE of only 8, and many many products coming into fruition. Yes the Alzheimer’s drug is fantastic and I believe the application will beaccepted by the FDA. Biogen came out stared the drug works significantly on reducing the Alzheimer’s process, will little to none risks... Honestly, I think the hedge funds are pushing this down. This will skyrocket in the next to months because the FDA has to make their decision to accept or reject the application. If accepted and eventually within 6 months FDA does accept the drug, this stock will be well over $1000...I’m puzzled why it’s at this price. I have been accumulating at all different prices... Biogen is a great company and will do very well in the upcoming months and the next few years....What’s your thoughts, please intelligent responses only...... whether agree or disagree... thank you, God Bless America"

"CELG was acquired by BMY for $74B. CELG rev was $17/yr but an empty pipeline and drugs that going out of patent and plenty of debt and no cash. However, BIIB rev is $14B/yr but the pipeline is excellent, 1 pending approval, 6 drugs in phase 3, and 10 in phase 2, plus 9 in phase 1. For CELG, 74B/17B = 4.35 times rev. Even if this number is used for BIIB then the price would be $61B or $381/shr but BIIB has a rich pipeline and an AD blockbuster drug pending approval."

I have a question about this Tecfidera ruling. My understanding is that BIIB is appealing the lower courts ruling that did not uphold the patent. Why then was MYL permitted to rush a generic version of the drug to market so quickly? And what happens if the lower courts ruling is overturned should BIIB win? Will MYL be permitted to continue to manufacture their drug?

The near term problem with Biogen is 1) credibility of research analysis which will attract a lot of scrutiny 2) the FDA may require additional trials before approval. In the next few days the greater scientific community will voice understandable pessimism. Long term it may all work out fine but short term the stock faces headwinds
I believe at least today we should pop green for a moment
Doesn’t make any sense. Investors were expecting 20% improvements but got more like 30%. Idiots think that is not good enough.

Give me a thumb up if you think Aducanumab will be approved by FDA during next meeting in March.
Just heard that BIIB got alerted at http://Bestplays.uno. I hope it pushes us higher!
BIIB is a $1000+ stock if FDA approves Alzheimer drug. Risk vs. reward is very compelling.

"Is biogen looking at Promis Neurosciences PMN310? Similar approach for targeting ameloid beta, but with better specificity and binding affinity than aducanumab. I haven't found comparative studies vs BAN2401, but their website claims lower ARIA-E effects (so you could dose higher and more efficiently). They claim they will start PhI in 2020... we'll see.The company is tiny, publicly traded, market cap of only $34M. Biogen's stock went up about $15B on marginal PhII aducanumab results, if I recall.US ticker is ARFXFhttps://promisneurosciences.com/Any dd appreciated, thx."
C raised its pt to 483. Be patient and let the weak hands panic.
"if its Halted, why its showing $4.13 down in AH ? same on CNBC.."
I am at the conference. It does not look good. More presentations to follow. I will report as soon as the verdict is out.
It’s not just the share price that suffered:https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/01/alzheimers-patients-coping-with-treatments-failure/
"anyone think we can breech 270, this week. contemplating selling Covered Call, and dont want to sell too early, IF we gonna climb more, this week."
I made a video about Biogen ($BIIB)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4fv-K1fC2Q
The FDA will approve aducanumab. End of story
Does anyone else ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just mentioned BIIB this morning.
226 bid. 228 ask
$240 seems to the floor on this stock.
"another ""fake"" trade? Filled Buy 277 BA Market 366.758 -- -- 13:31:47 03/25/19nt"
"week out calls spiked from $0.25 to $1.45. Aftermarket up $0.22 something going on, spike up on tomorrows open"
I am not sure if I stay long or not on this one .
Submitted for approval
Right decision by the FDA.
Why would anybody short a stock that's making so much money on drugs what they sell one of the biggest biotech companies in the world how can you go wrong?
150 on Tuesday. More pain to come.
I don't understand what these downgrades are all about but I don't see anything lower than a $300 target price. Seems very suspicious that they would downgrade just when BIIB brings in a new leader to the R&D program! I'm thinking they are about to do some nice acquisitions to add to their pipeline after the spinoff!
Major upgrade today...based on Adicanumab prospects for approval. I think the politics alone will result in approval even if the data is borderline. I wouldnt want to be the FDA if they reject. Approval results in $1000 stock price just based on TAM.
Leerink goes to $402 from $342 target
Will this trade in AH ?
Buying back shares today?

Biogen's market cap is lower than it's been since January 2013.
Bla accepted
Biogen sent its infected employees HOME to quarantine of which many lived in Apartment buildings which spread the virus. The absolute height of irresponsibility and from a Biotech firm that should know better. My friend might die because of their recklessness. Now many in the building a coughing and wheezing. This company should pay for their irresponsible acts that show saving money was more important that saving lives!

Is there any actual news or just something random posted online and suddenly a series of stop losses triggered?
250 this week.
Wow -4% pre market
Added more under $300.
But SAVA...future gem to cure Alzheimers ...WINNER
inching up in after-hours... probably open tomorrow @ 234
"An $11-12B increase in market cap is a major overreaction considering the potential revenues (not profits) to BIIB over the next 10 years (IF approved) is projected to be $10B. This is the number from the Morningstar analyst, and I get about the same. When I apply a typical profit margin to get to the impact on income/cash flow and then discount that to today, I get a positive impact on market cap of $4B at best. That is interestingly the amount by which Eisai's market cap increased on the news, and the two companies have an agreement to split the profits equally. So the reaction to the news, at best (given approval uncertainty), for BIIB's market cap should be about a $4B increase, not an $11-12B increase. Given the hype though, perhaps it will only pullback in some of the 19% gain on the stock."
VTVT still has an ALZ trial still going
exploitation of the healthcare system and tax money with this kind efficacy readout
"so, what's the deal??"
Buy SRPT instead. It's on the cutting edge. Biogen isn't.

I have ACIU as a safer bet on the side.

ok bye all Have a nice week end no worries.
holding on
Lots of options activity on the 235 strike
who sold 258 pre mkt lol
Feels so good to be right!!!
Ignore the noise from analysts as it looks like with this latest appointment BIBB is beefing up its R&D.
how about they are leaving cause an offer for 375 is coming and peoplr are leaving to new companies
December 14 is the state vote for presidency. The drug could be approved shortly afterwards.
FOR A 60B COMPANY AND IN IBB THIS HAS NO VOLUME WHY ???
Finally got me a winner! Sure is nice! Congratulations fellow longs!
"Looking for a 280 open tomorrow. Holding out until 275 to add more, which should happen by Wednesday."
"FYI - It was just 4 years ago Biogen & Eisai joined forces. And a lot of has NOT happened during the past 4 years, as will all know.What happened to E2609??Will BAN2401 be the success story???Saltynachohttps://www.eisai.com/news/news201410.html"
As of the close today BIIB is selling at a PE (consensus for 2019) of 7.92. VERY low for a company of this caliber.
Good thing is it wasn’t completely shunned. Just that the majority of the panel recommends that both studies be considered in establishing the efficacy of the drug. It’s all just so confusing to me. Never seem to get a straight answer on anything in this environment even a fricken election!
I issue screaming buy today!
Best guess when FDA will act on aducanamab?
"Worth the gamble now. The stock price is already assuming the failure of Alz. drug and thus the down tread is limited. However, if the drug is approved in a month or so, the gain will be 50% or more. The risk is limited but the reward is sky high."
The good thing is that they haven’t dis’d it. This positive trial was very promising despite their earlier one. They have come closer than anyone else to slowing down the progression of a terrible infliction and many people are hopeful.
"What is,wrong with this #$%$?"
“The system is broken.”

Beat but cut fy guidance
Does anybody know how much of the approx. $2 billion of annual research cost is related to the Alzheimer’s drug trials? or is this all in cost of rev.? It does matter where I'm trying to get an idea how this will affect bottom line eps.
You like this stock? ACIU could be the next thing. Buy it at 8 dollars while you can
I wouldn't touch it until 208ish
"On the daily frame, all key Tech. Indicators including CCI, Wm%R, RSI and both Fast & Slow Stochastic are giving entry point around current price +/- &3 for BIIB .. Yet the MFI & MACD are not there exactly yet although close .. unless something fundamental happens i think at or around $250 is excellent price"
"I just held a mock panel review process-- and it passed 8-0.who you going to believe- an RBC analyst who has financial interest, or me??what a joke"
BIIB is one of the most undervalued stocks. Its stock is falling because of the overall market. I am adding more shares at the current dirt cheap prices.
BIIB reached a new 52 Week High at 361.79

The inconsistency between the two trials will prevent approval. https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/23/heres-why-biogens-big-gain-wont-last-long.aspx
"Long time shareholder here, will still hold BIIB. However, some concerning notes from analyst:BAN2401 only appeared to slow the decline of patients with a genetic risk factor called ApoE4, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted, but even there, follow-up numbers, for just 10 patients, were of limited usefulness. He described the trial results as ""thin, unconvincing.""""In our view this data is confusing, suggesting only limited value for BAN2401 in the carrier population, while the small number of patients remaining on drug at the 18-month time point and lack of clear dose responses diminish the reliability of this dataset,"" Porges said."
Shorts getting squashed.

"Inverse relationship between AMD strength and $MU losses not surprising. The 1 year chart is almost a perfect inversion model.

Overall, AMD is holding up well with the China matter and I expect it will continue.$SNAP also holding up well in the tech sector for 2019. Evan Speigel doing what it takes to mold the executive team around his vision. Elon allowing buyout talk to help the stock isn't a bad strategy. Consider $TSLA a hold at this time.Washington will impact pharma greatly if it chooses to - I am betting for relative status quo and remain interested in the sector.

BUY the company will lead again soon.
Still very very overpriced.
"This weekend's Barron's reports a bullish view of the biotech sector. [[ ... Seigerman(of Credit Suisse) said that after a presentation by Biogen about its Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab at a conference in early December, he is increasingly confident that the compound will receive FDA approval. “We fully acknowledge that the data set has issues and we ordinarily would be skeptical of approval—but we think the desire for an approved drug by the Alzheimer’s community and potentially FDA has created a situation where approval is possible,” he wrote. ...]]https://www.barrons.com/articles/biotech-stocks-will-rise-in-2020-analyst-says-here-is-his-top-pick-51576250941"
"All I see in the news feeds is that a competing company is testing their own Alzheimers drug. I thought such news would cause Biogen's stock to go down, not up. Is there something else that I'm missing?"
Biogen is NOT a one trick pony. They have many drugs in the pipeline. Its time to load up again on Biogen.
Like I have said here... No way does the FDA just dump this drug when it has the potential to help thousands upon thousands of families.... Plus they have been much more lenient in giving the ok on drugs in the pipeline. I am right. It would be inhumane to bury this drug given the new data and the potential benefit...Boolean
FDA will give all BIIB shareholders a late Christmas gift. Surprise approval in January or mid February. Enjoy your Holiday!
Was the guidance bad for next qtr ?
"The good news is that the Advisory Committee's recommendations above are not binding on the FDA itself, and the FDA could, therefore, end up approving the drug anyway. (The FDA intends to render its own final verdict by March 7, 2021).But the other bad news is that, when you get right down to it, the Advisory Committee's conclusions were ""overwhelmingly negative,"" as J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov opined in a note out today. Tallying up the results, points out Kasimov, Biogen garnered a grand total of just ""one yet vote across the three key efficacy questions."" And this, in the analyst's opinion, ""certainly calls into serious question the FDA's very positive stance on aducanumab."""
I'm going to long this stock so hard tomorrow after selling puts today. Forward looking rev/ebidta look outstanding. Their failure on Alzheimer's drug...already forgotten.
"I remember when BIIB's Alzheimer's treatment with Aducanumab became newsworthy. We where told its a risky proposition, and later that risky proposition was emphasized with so-called failures, or anticipated failures, of the amyloid plaque hypothesis. Not to minimize these hypothetical risks, but at the time we were told that we had to wait 2 to 3 years before the phase III trial could be completed. Guess what? We are getting close to the time where we only have to wait 1 year, and time flies. I suspect that the longer we wait without negative news, the higher the probability of success. That's because a drug company would rather pull the plug early on a bad drug that does not work, than spend more money on something that's not going to prove successful. Nevertheless, its always show me the money first, and its not long to wait now."
Odds of approval?
I guess the buyback ended eh
"Hahaha, for those expect $90 swing."
I guess they're just going to let all the options expire today--sucks doesn't it?
Interestingly enough. No news nor downgrade and volume is 20% higher than average. The treasury at Biogen maybe shorting a bit so they can buyback some of the shares at a lower price. Let’s say 100k shares at a $10 discount is a $1M savings. Let’s see if there is a bounce tomorrow or Monday to confirm it. If so. I may buy a few thousand shares tomorrow. The after hours shows a bit of a spike on the calls. I can see Biogen going toward $300 by year end. The only downside I see is the write off on the failed Alzheimer’s drug. Biogen should have many more drugs in the pipeline. The write off may hurt earnings but in a few months it will all be forgotten. For Biogen to authorize a $5B buyback. They have sufficient funds to do more research and develop more drugs to extend life. I am confident that they will increase EPS via buyback (ingenious move) and continue to develop more money making drugs. No drug companies have a 100% success ratio. Batting just 50% is already phenomenal. GO BIOGEN

Price fixing... BIIB just keeps giving and giving.
"The bottom line is that in times of high volatility program trading runs the show. All stocks with ""Beta"" above a certain value are being sold. If you hold BIIB (like I do), it makes no sense to sell. We just have to hold on and weather this China storm."

Biogen paid Forward Pharma $1.25 billion in February related to the patent that covers ways of treating MS patients. Raffat said Biogen would have been on the hook for royalty payments of about $300 million annually starting in 2021, if it had lost the patent ruling.

Overeaction
I’m in at $250. To risky at any price higher
OT: ABBV has been quietly moving up after a very good report and up'd guidance. This one should also be considered. Biotech had the snot beaten out of it and there are some awesome companies for the taking!
SAVA results for AZ quite impressive. A totally different approach than Biogen and with a staff of less than 10. Entrepreneurs can still make medical breakthroughs! Biogen should follow up with partnership discussions or acquisition talks ASAP. Or a competitor will swoop up SAVA. SAVA press release today is a historic milestone for AZ patients and their families. Many thanks to the team at SAVA.
Drop in retaliation?

"Biogen is flat today because the people in the know are sure that their Alzheimer’s attempt is a failure. Despite all their expensive high dollar PR attempts, with all their money they have as a big Pharma company and CHERRY PICKING DATA from their last study to try to fool people into thinking that it will get approved the stock still won’t go up. Biogen is at an 8 month LOW, simply look at the charts if you don’t believe me. The reason why is because institutions and smart big investors know that their candidate will not be approved and if it happens to be approved by Bullying the FDA then it will only hurt, NOT HELP, people suffering from this horrible disease of the mind."
Thumbs down on approval.....Yikes...

All the recent bio sector gains are from the new kids. Between AMGNs earnings and the useless Italy news, what's this junk going to be at tomorrow like -70?"
Feeding the Carp Trump canned corn is fun! It will help you forget about loosing 32% of your money if you held.
Most of the time FDA follows reccomation panel
Why is it down today?

Biogen is up 4.99% to 259.34
Go private like Tesla. Shiiiity banks
"Lots of earnings today, market digesting this is at a low with good earnings get in while u can"
Now it’s SAVA and acad
I got a bargain buying 1500 shares at 233 yesterday. Crooks. Give me my money back.
"Hey market makers,TY for the gift. I am loading up. Thank you for funding my retirement. :)"
Take down on this R&D change overdone... I bought back in...
Just bought some $300 march calls on the dip... $800 was too cheap!
Any news with sagamo
I think BIIB got a very promising outlook. I expect 250 coming back in 3 months. .
"Recent news says, Appear the discontinued study was just of two or possibly more going on. Roche bailing doesn't mean all is lost. Don't write off this horse just yet!"
Looks like $216 is the low for this cycle. There might be another test of $216 tomorrow morning - with margin selling enforced. And then it should be free to run to the $235-240 area.
"Miles to go before hurdles of Phase III are to go thru (not to mention it needs to pass). More drugs have had to be shut down than pass in Phase III.( average Phase III 3 to 6years)This is just a minor basic phase they crossed. AS much as any drug is needed to help the people suffering, it needs to work as expected with out having major side effects.Here I just see the Company and CEO trying to sell/market to the share holder, creating inflated demand on what looks like very questionable probability of sucesss factors."
"Apparently the premarket doesn't like the new subgroup analyses of BAN2401 from Eisai's phase 2 trial. To me it looks good, demonstrating measurable slowing of cognitive decline in ApoE4 carriers. This would seem to remove the concern raised over the summer about the imbalance in enrollment of E4 carriers to the placebo over the highest BAN2401 dose, and suggests the drug could be even more effective in E4 carriers than non-E4 disease cases."
"Wow, a fresh 5 year low."
Level II quotes showing 253-253.5 on the bid
Lot of volatility today. Anyone know why?
Why is Biogen up so big?? Now it seems to expensive to buy
"￼GNPX, lung cancer news out."
"As soon as it was announced on CNBC , it was pumped and slowly going down."
"Key takeaways from ER -- Throughout 2017 Biogen repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock, spending $1.4 billion.- As of December 31, 2017, Biogen had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling approximately $6.7 billion, and approximately $5.9 billion in notes payable and other financing arrangements. So - With only less than a billion dollars in free available cash, how can Biogen make any acquisitions??Thoughts............."
Todays drop is a great buying opportunity as it may become a takeover target
"THIS is why BIIB has been going down....AVXS just got bought by Novartis, they have a cancer drug that Cramer just said on CNBC that people THINK is superior to BIIB's."
The FDA was supposed to rule on March 7th but delayed now until June 7th. I wonder if the delay has caused doubt to a positive outcome. Why would Refinitiv downgrade now?
"AMRN, if $PFE offer $50B and then raise the price of Vascepa 10 to 20% then you’ll have a $200B sales in 10 years, other use of Vascepa’s for Alzheimer’s or Glaucoma and Diabetes are not included, buyout noise really hot, who’s the winner $AMGN $NVS $GILD $AZN $BIIB $GSK $JNJ , who will please JT"
So many Analysts hate BIOGEN. They keep downgraded Biogen everyday.
"$288 today, $292 tomorrow"
You msit be insane to hold this right now! There are so many other opportunities.. better to lose 30% than 50%!
"At this price level, BIIB is priced in the far worse scenario.aggressive buy rating for BIIB==$280-$300 with upside potential 30% in 6 months or so!"
buy buy buy
"Under 200 is coming. I am not buying over 150. All hopes gone, that's bio."
pretty soon 225. shoot me.
Down like anything..
BIIB is up 5.62% to 284.00
They beat on both the top and bottom line which is a rare anomaly in this environment. I'm not surprised they are delaying the results from their alz drug given the current situation. Still think this is a strong buy here!
