It feels good to own PayPal today. And everyday since $44. :)
"Guys I just sold, at a 74% gain. It was very hard to do cuz I believe in PayPal. But with the market, I just had to liquidate and take the profits. Good luck to all!"
Crypto currencies ETH and BTC making new ATHs. Great news for PYPL!
$300 plus in a few days. This is a gift here
"can someone educate me on what roll P/E plays any.ore if any at all, even looking at forward earnings... 63 and there is still people out there buying? dont get me wrong great company and opertunity for growth but a p/e of 63 to me is just wild"
SQ is going back to 230 in order to reestablish the 20$ price margin with $PYPL
Congress has bipartisan agreement to pass the 1.4 trillion COVID relief package at 10pm tonight. This will boost the market tomorrow.
The bid on the August 9 $112 calls is at $1.21. That's a little more than 1% for holding the shares nine days. I've favored writing calls on PYPL since before the ER. It looks to me like the rally has stalled and I don't see a catalyst for a further move higher.
Haven’t been here in a while. Is Komol still terrorizing folks? PayPal will indeed hit $100 soon!!! Taking longer than expected but it’ll happen. Please check out $TEUMIt’s going to explode. Stay tune
"Well, it seems to me that PYPL is already up quite a bit. So, according to my limited stock market experience any surprise in eps will not be a great cause for celebration, and the likelihood is that the stock will falter because some small thing with be found that will not be as good as expected. Xoom is not exciting, and PYPL is generating income from investments now. Consumer outlook not as hot as it was before. I'm not as excited about PYPL as I once was, but I'll see what happens after the bell on 7/24. Not holding my breath."
"Everybody is only talking about $PYPL beats expectations and related to $SQ. But another bullish sign is that $MA beats also and said:"" an increase in contactless payments could help support current quarter transactions following a stronger-than-expected second quarter earnings report."""
Long
"This is a keeper, will double in time."
MercadoLibre results are VERY IMPRESSIVE. I calculate t Paypal has gained another 8-10 cents a share just from the recent rise of the Mercado stock price. Wow!
"go to sleep, wake up and paypal over 78. didn't think we would be testing 80 before December. this is amazing, starting to move like sq has been."
"Me thinks DS needs to go on Mad Money, like he has always done after each ER in the past, and face questions and let us know where we are going. We deserve to know as shareholders. The quarter was fine so nothing to be hiding from. Just give us transparency. IMHO"
99% are long PYPL. No short squeeze hopes here. Oh dear.
"Both Shulman and Rainey came out and bat again. I like Daniel""s body language and what he signals that mass mobile payment is over 50%, which PYPL has a big lead in this field. Venmo starts to work for the money since Sept, so It will see some good number. Far East estimate will come in at Jan 30, 10 min. before close."
ARK bought more PYPL today!
"Q4 ER will be even more amazing, UK, France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal and others are under lockdown/part lockdown, all physical stores are closed, for the first time in History , all Black Friday's , Bachelor's day , and Christmas sales are going On-line"
Too many days red
free dip buy today u know its goin back up tomorrow
Whats everyones guess on PYPL s earnings today. I think $.60
Stock is approaching a breakout over $100
charts show fintech rolling over. be careful buying here. I say to sell upside calls against positions to manage risk or pick up some September puts. mho
why would the discount brokers cut online trade commissions to zero? because the banks require more baggies to buy the banks HUGE inventory of long positions. think about it.
Anyone a clue as to why it dropped $6 a share on open ? I have seen nothing critical...
"Would anyone else agree that all the cautionary guidance should be behind us going in this next ER? Any news now should only serve to catalyze this stock moving forward, i.e. acquisitions, market expansion, Venmo monetization etc?"
50 dma at 115.06 has been violated. 107 must hold. pypl rarely trades below the 50dma. oh dear.
My price target for this dog is $20 by 2020.
"PayPal slowly putting the ebay news behind it, heavy on the slowly part. But maybe turning the corner, especially with the sports betting deal."
Good Things come to those who wait .
"$PYPL TULIP MANIA BUBBLE is up by 350% in the last 4 years, but the company revenues and earnings were higher in 2016. Today Paypal stock is trading as PONZI SCHEME at P/E=100."
Seems to be mirroring the market.
What time is the earnings tomorrow
Are any of you folks on this PayPal Message Board using PayPal's pay app Venmo? If not you better jump on!
time to fully support Square (SQ) ..... the clear winner and Master of PYPL .... DEAL WITH IT !! HAHAHA
"I was probably the biggest bull on this NIO board and in my account from June 2020 until a couple of weeks after NIO day. I did not short this stock, because it is against my principles, but I knew it would tank. I liked the secondary offerings , which I thought they were going to deploy their war chest on expansion in every area. The factory issue is pathetic. The raised about $5Billion of our American dollars and seem content to sit on it. That turned me off, and when you combine legacy autos deploying cash for the EV sector, they have lost a great deal of momentum and trust. Now, I get the tech trades are suffering. I recently moved into $PYPL which has taken a whipping with the overall NASDAQ, but I am sorry, I will stay with PYPL and shun this. The cash in PYPL is real, the expansion is real and their massive revenues are equating to strong earnings. It may be rocky for a while, but $PYPL will bust out after this down cycle to new highs.NIO, once my favorite tech play has been very disappointing, and questionable what they are doing with cash.To my long term NIOites on this board, I issue this caution out of loyalty to you. Remember the November dilution. The locked up shares awarded to those that brought the secondary to market in November, free up late this month. Be careful as the float expands and more shares hit the market.Once again, very disappointed in NIO and am someone suspect on all these cash raises via dilution. Just wanted to remind those about the unlocked shares coming to market in a couple of weeks.I feel better in $PYPL and will have some exposure to China through their arrangements with Alipay.I hope it works out with NIO, but please proceed with caution. Good luck to all on my former board hangout.NIO owes me nothing, I did great with them.I hope to see some of you around, and NIO does deploy some of the cash they raised from the American equity market."
first data / clover next on the shopping list?
Back up we go
"Paypal no longer honors seller protection and states they are working on your behalf! They are only working on their own behalf. I have 3 orders now around $20 that were all delivered to confirmed addresses and ended up being chargebacks so charged an additiona $20 chargeback fee. Why because the sales happened 6 months previously and the tracking no longer works but stamps.com says ""delivered successfully"", furthermore if you can usps they could provide you with valid tracking on these orders!"
$249+ LOL 
"UPDATE : Update to my posting of 20 hours ago: I had written to Ebay in response to their blanket email to their clients that they will be transitioning to Adyen. At that time l told them the move away from Paypal would be very foolish: response from them just now : "" it's a work in progress "" .... nothing is set in concrete.....l pick up that if there would be a major backlash from buyers or sellers they may action some sort of out-clause. In any event, pulling away from Paypal will be to EBay's detriment, not Paypal's."
89 tomorrow
Targeting 206 - 210. What are the odds that the entire market is down?
It’s obvious that some funds reduced their position. I said earlier that 230 should hold. I would understand selling at 300 level but not at 230-240 area. The bottom is in...IMO
you dont trade $pypl
"Looks like one of the most gorgeous, stunning, enlightening double top $249 formations I’ve ever seen in my illustrious career"
Crypto access is a real step towards crypto being a viable daily currency. PayPal will make a killing off micro-transactions
Paypal to split to 3
"We must believe the cautionary guidance is behind us. Yes, there will be threats looming on the horizon, competition, regulation and the costs of expansion. However, there are so many opportunities awaiting PYPL, new emerging markets, user growth, monetization of assets like Venmo, acquisitions and a glut of free capital. Feel free to share any thoughts on this."
We seem to be lagging a bit?
"It does not look good for the new year particularly tech sector., I think it is safe to hide behind AAPL with low PE and growth ecosystem rate is still expanding at least 20-25 %."
paypal will hit 95 next week
fasten your seat belt!
PYPL now in correction mode down more than 10%———next up is bear  market 20%
"It is so fast, so I have to move my cover call higher. I guess PYPL will hit new high next week."
Hey Congress people. This is America. The America you created by sticking your heads in the sand and ignoring the voice of the people. You made this protest. Your job is to listen to the people. Audit these discrepancies in voting and make things right!
To hight to buy rn?
Anyone hear a rumor of a PYPL earnings restatement?
Will wait for the market to crash before I load up on Paypal. There appears to be a lot of panicking in the market due to covid-19 not being under control (more deaths and businesses shutting down) and no more stimulus until next year (if any).
Should be back to 90 by the end of the year.
"If this follows the trend, it will end the day tomorrow at 182.__"
Let’s do $81-82 + today
Joe Biden potentially locking down to control COVID 19 infections. Just bought more at 189 
Come on hit all time high already. What a great stock.
"silver to gold ratio is now 90.20. this is a three decade high. anyone in stocks, especially stocks that are lightyears from book value ie pypl, and not exposed to silver is clearly out of the ""buy low and sell high"" paradigm."
Lol we’re already above $80. Let’s finish in green
"can someone tell me why we hit 121,3 or whatever and then came back down to 119,... immediately? any reason for this?"
"If you’re wondering if you should buy PayPal, keep this in mind:- PayPal will benefit from current levels.- stimulus will boost e-commerce"
"If you consider that the earnings report only sets the stock price back about a week, this will be seen as a small bump in the road and an opportunity to get in or add at a good price."
A solid MISS for PYPL on tap. Banksters know this is their last chance to get out around 100. Ask Jim Bears Sterns Cramer.
already 17 million shares? WOW!
I think it’s time to get into this thing now. I’ve been waiting on the sidelines for too long hoping SQ can catch up.
targets vary between $200 and $290
Buy Sq stocks its always outperforming PYPL
Zooming to 280 by tomorrow!!!!
When bitcoin tanks....what happens to PayPal?
They should start paying us a dividend
buying opportunity today
@komol Do you work for UNH or have a vested interest in repeating this on the pypl comment board??
bought more PYPL today $82.24
I love this stock
Sold at 82 and back in at 74!
Buying opportunity!!!!
Going to love the reaction of all the naysayers this earnings
just added 150 shares maybe more by end of day. smart buy and savy company will withstand anything.
"Let me tell you whoever bought PYPL yesterday when it was down $.60, already a winner. PYPL is making money left and right by VENMO. The big fish is SWIFT financial for small business loan is exploding, that will push 3rd Q earnings through the roof. The interest rate in small business loan is almost like shark loan rate. That is why the Oct call option is just like big pool of the bettors."
"EBAY tried to ditch PayPal before using it's own pay service, but failed miserably. EBAY will fail again and back to PayPal will stay"
This will definitely increase tmrw
"For all you investors that are upset that Square is out performing PYPL, remember that PYPL is UP over 30% this year. PYPL and Square are two different companies. One makes money and the other might make money someday. Guess which is which. I'm old enough to remember the ""Dot.com"" era when it was all about the ""burn"" rate. Then it collapsed. Square still needs to obtain critical mass before the next recession. Otherwise it becomes a ""penny"" stock."
Congrats guys. More of the same from Visa tomorrow. These stocks have been manipulated down recently. Paypal and Visa are very profitable.
Should go over $82.00
245-250$+ tidayBuy moreBargain price
$108 and life is great. Go PYPL. :))
Ever tried trading WalMart gift cards for food stamps? This is why PYPL is beyond it's peak.
"ive been in since sept 2015 @$33, didnt go anywhere for 2 years.at the time $40 was the base. Now its forming a new base at $100im neutral for awhile, but catalysts are forming, and tomorrow could be interesting"
Earnings... Nov 2 or Oct 21?
No reason to sell here
"Not a bad day all things considered. Good work team! I’m thinking of scooping at $75/$76 on the way upwards, thoughts?"
setting up nicely for the next week before heading to earnings
PayPUKE $309 or $230? ROTFLMAO 
"Like l replied to HAN a day ago, the Long and Strong shall prevail : all the more strength to Paypal : the Fintech World Leader !"
"Brought at 70, selling at 700, long and strong"
Huge buying opportunity!!!!
"This will make a material difference in future earnings. Unfortunately, this will be down another 10-15% over next month or two until pypl announces new partnerships and services"
"Buy when there is fear. Sell when their is giddy, silly exuberance.$PYPL $AMZN $SQ $TSLA $CRMDon’t fall for the old dinosaur’s technology. Some old greedy Wall Street Fund Managers have egg on their face. This temporary phase will pass. And the young employees at these out of touch old greedy fund managers, will be putting their funds dollars where the future lies, not what grandpa greed can not understand.Grandpa greed will pat their young “protégés” on the head for thanking them for getting them in on this dip."
"i like what third point said, paypal is the next amazon"
Will market turmoil outweigh strong earnings
Took forever to break $80....... Let's close above $80!!
is it ok to buy overpriced stocks again?
"Already 2.6 mil. shares change hand, it tells me that the shorts try to stop the break out which I think it wii fail eventually. When the longs gathering the force again it will nudge PYPL higher. It is symbolic of touch new high, pull back and marching on again."
If it breaks $83.30 it’s a good sign that’s its beginning an uptrend.
This is the one you should hold!!! It is staging to break out soon!!!
"Ok hint for my former NIOphite friends. $PYPL has had a healthy, more than healthy correction. It is oversold, but showing strength at it’s 200 dayMA.A good pick up here, coming of a banner quarter with double digit growth projected, quarter over quarter as far as the eye can see. It is on sale. Almost 30% off their all time high.They earn money like crazy, and buy back their own shares."
"Venmo vs CASH AppI've looked myself, but I just want to verify my eyes aren't playing tricks on me.Is it true that Venmo produced $450,000,000 in annual revenue where as SQ's Cash App is on pace to produce $2 Billion plus annual revenue? This is quite an astronomical difference if true."
Anyone expect this stock to reach $200 by the end of this year?
"Congrats to those holding, ran up into this earnings, reversed initial decline a.h.Wish I could say the same with SQ. Pypl just a better pick in the space."
"William, I know how you and I both like to compare PYPL and SQ. Let us know the return on the two names over the past week, month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year and all time returns? I’ve made more in sq in the past year than PYPL has returned in its entire public life. And you wanna get on sq board and say pypl had a better day, you make me laugh."
"ok, no correction for the market today then, just green everyday lol"
PayPal train leaving the station. All aboard! March to $80 has begun.
"if they incorporate Honey in their main payment platform, that would mean that buying stuff with PayPal will work out to be cheaper than any other payment service. that would be a big game changer!"
told you guys this will go up today .. but tommorow whole market may be down and volatile till election is settled and stimulus is passed
"I posted this last week and got three thumbs down: ""Last week, I mentioned here that the upward move in PYPL appeared to be over and suggested selling call options on long positions. I was bullish on PYPL since I posted a 6 month price target of $120 in December. I was obviously correct about the move to $120, and I think the earnings report pretty much validated my current strategy.""I've been so right about PayPal for 7 months now."
Dip buyers buying high. 95 on the way....
PYPL got upgraded to $300 ... yeehaw!!LINK##: https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/21/paypal-stock-could-surge-23-to-300-on-its-cryptocu/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article
That's overdoing a conference call. Paypal had miserable results and acquisitions and they just lapped it up. People are going to lose jobs and this company will go out of business. enjoy the 5 minutes of fame loll
"Buying every 5% dip..This is one fantasiic company,excellent service. Easy $100 mid year,2019.GLTA"
How does India's PayTM square up against PayPal? Buffet is obviously a smart guy; why wouldn't he invest in PYPL instead of PayTM?
Love “Investor Day” when the stock falls $25 in a minute and loses $20b of investors money  PayPuke is now in correction territory
Any ideas why PayPal seems to be on a plateau while Square keeps rising?
$81 today!
seems like a no brainer play to get in here
"This is an obvious bargain opportunity. PayPal is tremendously successful and will continue its excellent growth pattern for many years to come...no small part due to its high trust factor.In the meantime, it remains a payment option with eBay and 2023 is a LONG way off. Plenty of time for many other new relationships to be made to offset eBay.We own PYPL in two retirement Roths and I’ve now just bought a fun 100 shares in my trading account. We are retired, in our mid-60s, and have had a very solid long term return in our investments over the years.No doubt in my mind about PayPal."
pypl dips get bought. fed reserve will support and propel markets higher rather than allow for systemic collapse. valuations have no meaning when the fed has deemed the markets as paramount priority. rate cuts on the way. buy buy buy
"PYPL got CURVCurv provides the industry's first cloud-based Institutional Digital Asset Wallet Service. ... Curv makes it quick and easy to add new assets to any portfolio, without having to use any hardware or manage blockchain infrastructures.Curv is a Digital Asset Custody Company. Our Cloud-based MPC Wallet Delivers Bulletproof Protection, Instant Availability & Autonomy Over All Digital Assets."
EBAY now has another payment processor.
sure is a lot of crying going on at the SQ camp...HAHAHAHAHAHA
$75 check. Roll on $76!
"Love the shills being gay bears on here. I don’t see a single bearish reason behind this ticker. BTC at all time highs, PYPL revs at all time highs, new users constantly, ya it’s run a bit but it’s not done. $400 within a month."
i sold ebay at 40 a month ago. it rips off it sellers. I put that money into paypal today. good feeling.
I really hope PYPL will buy SHOP (Shopify) to create giant e-commerce. It is very logical step to grow in an area PYPL not strong. It will be marriage made in heaven for the stock.
Don't sleep on LOOM crypto currency. .048 currently and primed for a 10x run up. Lock and load
We’re moving forward gang. It’s our time!
This is overreaction stick with it u will be rewarded.
PYPL could jump big anytime. It has such a good earning. There is nothing to be worry about. Its evaluations by annalists are good as well.
Price rose and closed above the 50 dma...
I do not use PayPal - why should I? Never had a reason to - I am actually invested in square before its rise- liked the management philosophy and players- What does anyone know about the guys at the top of Pay Pal food chain?
$80 so close I can taste it!
goes down? just keep buying. going back up
simple reason this isn't up with the rest today. look at the chart. it'll go either way and no one knows which. smart investors are staying clear for now
why is this down so much? Did trump put tarriffs on all paypal transaction in China?
Backed up the truck today and loaded. My PYPL stake is now 5 percent greater than prior to the market selloff. PYPL's cash flow in 5 years according to the CEO will be double what it is now. Increasing cash flows are one of the metrics I like to see when investing in a company. Rising rates can drive a company down near term but in 5 years they will do little to dim a company's prospects. Take advantage of this selloff longs. Also loaded up on SQ. PYPL is going back to 300 and then it will take out 400. Below 250 is dirt cheap.
Why would anyone short this stock? Def a long term stock.
Has a great chart setup. Has room to run to 84.00
Paypal may surge 5+ % during the Investors event. So buy now
Amazon slashed their rates because retailers refuse to work with their biggest enemy...this discount won’t help and their payment platform will remain stagnant.
"Barrons - “A key metric, transaction processing volume, did grow 28% on a currency-neutral basis. That is ahead of 27% last quarter, and could be more encouraging to investors.”"
Musk is playing with investors and showing how easy it is for one with power to manipulate the markets. Too much THc and not enough Lithium! PYPL DOES NOT need BITCOIN to make a profit.
The Hedgies had a nice profit and they sold to show some profit. It is fun to be on a stock that they love at the moment but we must remember they as a group are far worse than the small investor. They have to take profits where they can by quarters end to substantiate their 2 and 20 program which will go away. They cause what can be marketed as a rotation occasionally. The best thing you can do is buy the dips that they cause if the company is performing.I believe this company is performing very well and the new acquisitions are smoking the revenue growth.I will stand on my 125 call.

"Yet another reason PayPal; may become a potential takeover candidate.... the announcement that PayPal is now the first foreign corporation licensed to process payments in China. Why a takeover possibility? 1. Share prices artifically (IMHO) depressed. 2. Easier for the likes of Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, to acquire PayPal and its ""foot in the door"" in China than to continuosly bang their heads trying to acquire their own license. 3. Less glamorous but best reason - Paypal's fundamentals and continued growth."
"Paypal should be a $400 stock with Vemo and making money off Crypto exchanges, advertisements, ect."
holy moly I thought I took an L but I guess not
should we wait for earnings call or??
$85 will become the new support
https://www.barrons.com/articles/paypal-can-gain-nearly-60-fund-manager-51549998522?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooAmazing read! target price is a lot higher than I thought !! future is really bright for PayPal! Lets see this stock grow : )

PYPL is on its way to 100+ soon. Load up.
Why is it taking ?
"PYPL is my last like of the trifecta today and I'm very excited. EA, BOFI already raced very well."
Lol downgrade. Someone wants cheap shares!!!
"Izettle was going public on the Stockholm Nasdaq Exchange and were hoping to raise 228 million U.S on their I.P.O.And yea here comes an American Company who is willing to pay the two owners a principal of two billion dollars U.S, not to take their company public."
to infinity & beyond! - Buzz Lightyear
I’m long PYPL for 3 years but this is NOT setting up to be a good earnings. Prospective longs should wait to buy this dip. Don’t see an earnings pop at all.
Target raised to $114. Get a move in PayPal!
Nice after hours action. Up over $4
Predict a 5% sell off by bell
when are earnings
PYPL will blow the numbers away!!! $95.00 ...soon ...very soon!!!
Shorts covered. Time to get the party started kiddies
Lets hope we skyrocket from this base... just bought this stock so I hope earnings is enough to get it up to $96+ and more of course I'm just being realistic.
PYPL and the private fed reserve bank are buying PYPL shares. without the bailouts PYPL would be in the teens.
Chart setting up for a run to new highs.
Reported that PayPal dominates about 70% of online payment processing and amazon 11%..just wow wow!
paypal will become un restricted when ebay break the bond! the new allowed partnerships will come flying in. why is that bad? people are so sweaty all the time
"RIght now, this is a good price level, but it very well may continue to sell off and hit $203... At 203 the price will be in the value range again and it will get bought up.Long term it's an easy buy. This quarter they will have explosive unbelievable earnings and this is a gift for long term holders... I added more shares to my 401k and will NEVER sell them... Short term, I am chitting the bed as the market is scared right now and all tech is getting beat up, I also have July calls that are leaving skid marks in my underwear they are beat up so bad and I'm now doubtful whether they will make a profit..However, four months in this market is a LOOOOOONG time and I still think after they report a blowout for the current quarter the funds gonna pump it back up... Right now they are shaking everyone out and will scoop the shares back up at a discount"
It down now. What's happening??
$PYPL Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 285 » USD 290
"very healthy pull back,I am looking at some of the slope of S&P, which is very steep. I will place the bet on only the stock that will have growth rate at least 12 %,and sustain the rate for the next 3 years. I see the finance, health care and some tech like FB, GOOG. I think fluctuation is good for the stocks because you can get good stock at the cheaper price. As long as the economy is still intact, I don't worry much, at least another year."
the expensive continues to become more expensive. the cheap is getting expensive. With rates at 2.5% the fed has 10 (ten) 1/4 point rate cuts to send the markets into ultra overvaluation. Retail is not buying at these valuations. The fed is buying these valuations. How long will the fed buy is the question. Place yur bets.
Whispers...PayPal in talks to buy Robinhood
Yes!!! Finally Square is now up $2 and higher than PayPUKE it was recently $100 lower
Hedgies trying to run it down before earnings.....Earnings Whisper $0.752nd Quarter June 2019Consensus: $0.73Revenue: $4.33 Bil
In at 73.05
Based on the volume I can only wonder if some insider information has once again been leaked out ahead of the call.
PYPL is one of those forever stocks people. always buy on any dips.
no worries 
$PYPL Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 215 » USD 230
Just bought more PYPL today. I also think they are close to buying another company before they report earnings. Any thoughts
"We broke 90 today will break 1oo very fast,"
MOST UNDERVALUED and UNDERBOUGHT stocks in the Universe: $AMZN $NVDA $AMD $SQ $SHOP $MU $AMAT $ROKU $TWLO $CRM $TWTR $ADBE $PYPL $NFLX These BARGAINS must RISE by 60-90%.

"NASDAQ 100,PYPL and ADBE are two dogs in there today.LOL. I bet you that it will be temporary. Whoever thinks these two stocks are SOLD will be disappointed. Without the tax cut the earnings growth is around 40 and 50% respectively."
"look up the 5 year chart ""Price Index: Purchasing Power of the Consumer Dollar in U.S. City Average, All Urban Consumers""what is that about stagflation again? silver and gold are going to go straight up in terms of fake reserve debt notes."
$SQ will print $150 before $PYPL. You heard it here first just like when I told you SQ would print $100 before PYPL
Will be green. Screning buy under $150
"PayPal officially holds a wholly-owned stake in a payment company in China,"
"And now PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is planning to revamp its services for the unbanked including offering a debit card, check deposits, and direct deposits into your PayPal account as well as maintaining its consumer loans business. It's aggregating services from several small banks to offer a complete solution for consumers.PayPal COO Bill Ready says there are 30 million Americans without a bank account spending an average of 9.5% of their income on fees from alternative financial services. While services like PayPal's or Square's won't be entirely fee-free, it could save people a lot of money while generating meaningful revenue for either company."
Strong Buy under $200
PYPL going to 52 week lows soon..Sell now and buy it back around 60 where shares will be fairly valued.
Going from $309 to $177 in a month PayPUKE  Not too shabby

We said GOODbye to POS PYPL the same say the EO decided to be another HOWARD SCHULTZ political foolBoth Schultz and PyPl's leader forget there are Christians who buy COULD buy their products.If they believe in Alimentary Canal exploring with friends and gerbils KEEP IT TO THEMSELVES..
0.57>0.543.69billion>3.581 billion
$300 price by summer. That’s all...
This is miserable dumping. Feeding on itself. Just getting fried.
"Bill Ready, PYPL CEO, on CNBC-after commercial-to make big announcement!"
stocks are falling. quick...someone cut rates fast.
"Howdy. Been a while since i posted on this board. I just reviewed the long term chart on PYPL and have an interesting perspective. In April 2017 the stock was at 40. Today the stock is at 104. I've owned it since 39 and am obviously pleased. But during the last 24 months, the markets have had some wild times and there's been hurdles to overcome for PYPL such as eBay and new competition, etc. Seen comments on this board expressing frustration over stock performance, etc., and i have to admit i was frustrated at times as well. But after all these experiences, the stock is up over 150% in 24 months. If we fast forward to April 2021, and experienced the same growth of 150%, the stock would be over 250/share. I doubt we would have any complaints about that result, and i'm sure there will be many ups and downs along the way, just like the last 24 months. Being in this stock has taught me patience and to ignore lots of ""noise"" in the marketplace. I wish all the longs the best of luck; for me, i'm holding on for the long term and can only hope for another 150% in 24 months! IMHO GLTA"
"its coming, be patient, today might be the day or tomorrow, too many good things going for paypal"
"great day. We'll pass 80 soon, hopefully by the end of the week or next week."
My Pal looks to be Paying out today!
Sentiment is this is a $100 plus stock...It will get there eventually.
Great business model. Huge customer base. New trading and investment products to be introduced within the next few months. For now we just need to deal with the macroeconomic conditions at play though. Pretty much everyone is in the same boat.
"If PayPal can become a big player in sports gambling, watch out, it could triple. But don't know if that will happen yet."
Venmo is a real Gem in the Paypal system ...It's worth 200 Billion by itself.
What a let down. 90 seems not to hold...
"if they manage to do it the current price is preety undervalued.but if they don't, the current price is extremely overvalued and will probably fall hard."
Earnings must of leaked out. PYPL up up
"It’s important to note that the pathetic people in here bashing PayPal fall into 2 categories: 1.) those who missed the early buy-in opportunities and are jealous 2.) the short sellers who are more often wrong than right, and try to scare people out. Either way, they offer no good advice!"
STNE should break $30 next back to $45 same with $PAGS and $PYPL target
Shorting this to $50 ... the hype is over guys. get out of tech
PYPL reached a new All Time High at 80.20
Predictable pull back we all knew it was coming don't panic hold firm...........
Maybe it’s time to study on other stocks rather than PYPL which is going to be bought out soon. Sigh. I hate Studies haha
Buy! Buy! Buy!
Another 3 % today and tomorrow moving forward
Anyone here think Paypal will be the go-to for krypto currency?
"PayPal is still in its early innings. Many people get worried about competitors, but remember a rising tide raises all. Nearly a quarter of the world's population remains unbanked due to restrictions imposed by traditional banks. PayPal is just starting to provide services to the unbanked in the States; but the main beneficiaries will be third world countries with high mobile penetration and solid base of young early adopters. This alone will drive growth for several years as the global payments market is huge and PayPal has a massive lead on potential competitors. It should be noted that PayPal is continuously working to open up in many countries. For instance, it is likely that PayPal will be made available in Pakistan this year - this is a country with a population of 200 million people and is just one of many examples! We in the West mistakenly believe that the likes of Amazon, etc. can take a big slice of the payments market just like that; this is absolutely not true. It takes years to conform with the banking regulations of individual countries - hence providing a great opportunity and a financial moat for PayPal. This company has an excellent head start, and will continue to provide for many years to come :)"
Buy buy buy
OMG! THANK YOU PANIC SELLERS!! A dream come true :)
"one of the best companies when it comes to growth year over year, great profits, and people still think it is a good idea to sell? even with this ""market rotation"", paypal will not be used less as you can still make payments in stores with paypal debit and credit cards, they will even increase revenue having the 2 sides of the business live, phisical and online."
"It looks like eBay is bypassing PayPal....eBay now manages the end-to-end selling experience on our marketplace, including payments. This means: • No more PayPal payment processing fees. • You get paid directly to your bank account, not your PayPal account. • Most sellers will pay the same or less than before."
"Stock will not go nowhere, just fill the gap, until we see the volume over 10 mil. then we will start to march up to 80. I have no doubt about 80 in December. I will buy PYPL again near Christmas. 85-90 in Jan,."
"Shorts are needing a change of shorts right about now,"
"Shaping up really nice this morning!!!! I think the unemployment numbers are priced in. Might be a nice pop, even if it is worse than expected"
now is definitely the time to buy into paypal if you haven't. I am already all in so just riding it out. will hold for years
I sold tonight :))) nice £700 profit. Will buy back near the $200
Should be over 100...are you kidding me. Hottest sector apart from pot stocks and this acts like a defensive stock. Even Kraft was up today!!!
"$302? Was that a real print? Missed it. I see it’s down around $10 from there. Sometimes Yahoo has bad quotes. That has to be a bad quote, right?"
Interesting that google is entering the p2p space. I guess they assume they can gain market share. I wonder how it will affect PayPal and Venmo.
based on the options the MM will definitely want this on the north side of 91 by Friday still. They will make a ton off the 88 and 91 puts.
Over reaction was when the stock price went from $25.00 to $85.00 for no reason.
another tiny volume up day...pypl distribution continues
"VENMO is the standard SOCIAL PAYMENT PLATFORM for the new generation Y right now, control about 90 % of the P-P digital payment. There is no competitors that can challenge VENMO. Analysts try to commend about ZELLE, that can not compete and compare to VENMO at all. Only AAPL which has solid ecosystem that will compete with VENMO, but it is too late because PYPL keeps improving and add value into VENMO. The mobile payment will expand huge in the next 3-5 years. VENMO will be the standard mobile payment in the next 3 years. PYPL price will double in just the next two years."
Just got off the phone with Paypal since my account isn't working. Per the recording they are banned from Business from June 20th (today is the 19th and they are shut down already) to June 25th. No business can be transacted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone know what is going on? Perhaps a good time to by option betting the stock will tank before the real news gets out????
Fin-tech....... It's where the money is!
You want to own this stock for the long term. Cest tout
Lol let’s short a stock 15% off it’s high great idea
"Now it is a new chapter, a lot of small cap got wipe out what was gained since 2017. Psychological changes after night, only selected sector and most of the big cap will be the winner in the future. Now 2018, the gain will be limited, you will not see fluctuated computer sales in the near future. The investors will go back to the basic and value stock again, because the ""FEAR "" will cause the slow trade. The trend will change over the near term even the economic is still very strong."
VERY HAPPY TO JUMPED IN LATELY AS WITH THIS DIP...THE BOTTOM 'S JUST IN....BUY MORE WHILE STILL CAN...
$25 billion rev. Forecast next year
I just step in again at this price. I have confidence that PYPL will hit 85 this week.
Breakout above $85 any day
$100. Yea thir! Now hold it PayPal!
I believe PYPL CEO will be on Cramer tonight
PYPL will inherit all online transactions. It is one click and safe vs credit cards requiring data input. They have hardly penetrated brick and morter. Credit cards are just as easy in stores. Pypl will also become the gold standard of funds transfer which is a market as large as online retail. After the 2019 correction it is a reasonable price.
"PYPL should run up before earnings on 7/25. Should report $.60, $.03 beat"
"PYPL got a shoutout from John Najarian, on Fast Money, tonight. “This thing is going higher. Giddy up “!"
Strong future ahead for Paypal!
Thanks for those selling for letting me to buy under $300
how isnt paypal 10% up after the china announcement? 
Holding Pypl shares after splitting out from ebay..it’s an excellent rewarding stock for my core holding
The committee to re-elect the president is rumored to be refusing to accept PayPal for donations.......
solid growth BUY BUY BUY
"Two more announcements: Venmo is moving from social transactions to commerce. So they have already started monetizing it using ""smart buttons"". Xoom's U.S. remittance is gradually being rolled out globally."
SQ is up 10% almost and this didn’t move a needle?
"Wednesday is just around the corner. After hours reporting... I can not wait!!! Revenues beat and guidance even better with acquisitions,"
Thank you Robinhooders for participating in the stock market. Now that you're done chasing - and probably out of the market - long-term investors can take a deep breath and go back to seeking good stocks at attractive prices.
in the past two days pypl trading volume has been more than twice the total number of shares shorted. this is not a short squeeze. this is a distributive rally by the banks looking to exit pypl above 100. think about it.
Want to buy bitcoin where is the best place to do that is it PayPal?
GOING WAY HIGHER. PAYPAL IS THE PAYMENT SERVICE OF CHOICE FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE BUY ALL DIPS. STAY LONG.
"PayPal says ""follow the instructions"" - supply them with your personal information, they know what's best for you."
"Another red day, any reason why, or is it down just because NAS is red again."
Anyone know when PayPal will start monetizing Venmo?
"KOMOL: I think me exit PayPal. It not hit me target and it disappoint. 3 hours later... PayPal really surprise that it hold strong. After listening to crammer cus I am a sheep donkey, me think that I get back in PayPal on Monday.) Monday comes....Oh wow. It only go up .50. Me think that it a weak stock. Me think it should go up $1.50 so for now me leave. Come back and check on FridayConclusion: KOMOL is a moron."
$1.63b in Bitcoin revenue and $32m in gross profit. $PYPL late to the party as always
Dan Schulman one smart cookie......long and strong PayPal
One opportunity not yet priced into PayPal is their consumer base expansion in Africa through M-Pesa. I was surprised by the pervasive use of M-Pesa in Tanzania and Kenya on my visit their two years ago - PayPal now gives us exposure to that massive and largely underserved market :)
"Loaded up on the calls exp Oct 26. Like most earnings beat so far, expect PYPL to exceed and stock to soar. Load up on the call options if you have some spare $$$ for earnings call."
PayPal is down 4.92% to 185.45
Any interesting information from the analyst event?
Just saw PYPL published on the daily alert watchlist at (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
Bargain price
Unnamed source and no confirmation from Amazon. Someone is making a killing here.

This company is worth..one trillion dollars
PYPL should be around $88.00 on earnings day/
buy some Z cash to go with your PayPal stock
Another acquisition! New 52 week highs coming tomorrow!
"PYPL should be 230-250 eow ,"
PayPal attempting to get back to even today.
"The threat from Apple Pay to PayPal has been exaggerated to keep PYPL share price under $40. But with the stalled adoption rate of ApplePay in past two quarters at the storefront, the progress that the ApplePay can make even after Mac user can use Apple Pay to pay for the online purchase will be very limited, because the user base is already the small existing Apple Pay users. PayPal's dominance will main or even grow because the trend of online shopping has been outgrowing the offline ones, so the $40 resistance will become support this time. Long PYPL!"
Great earnings PYPL could get back to $192 where it was this morning lol
Most of the time when you stop looking at your account everyday and come back a month later not much has changed.
it's coming back now.
prediction: this weekend's news will consist of two subjects: the virus and vaccine commercials.
whats going on with this stock
PayPal CEO: ‘I don’t think there is any going back’ from e-commerce after COVID-19https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e6a6d7fd-0c22-3998-80c4-660615f757e8/paypal-ceo-%E2%80%98i-don%E2%80%99t-think.html
"An extremely modest rise in 30-year mortgage rates has prompted a sudden collapse in mortgage applications for refinancings.Overall, mortgage applications tumbled 7.3% last week and are down over 15% in the last three weeks - the worst drop since January 2016..."
Stock down around 15% in 4 days. Such a ponzi market. Time to sell and short. Zero risk
Drip.....drop....

SQ just hit $100.
Thinking of investing... But who among here have used Venmo? And do you like it more than Zelle? Thank you!
"paypal has a international presence and is better valued than square, which doesnt have such a foothold and is too overvalued compared to its growth. paypal is priced better for safety, always keeps a margin of safety."
"Let Democrat shuts down the government, let them do it. We will wipe them out from the Senate and the House in November, it is only ten months to go, and wholesales dump them again in the next two years. Need to take care of the trouble makers in the Senate and the House. This is the reason Democrat keeps losing seats, they still never learn."
After hours 9 % the only way is up !
"A good quality stock! If you are not jumping today, you can still buy it tomorrow. It is looking to break out"
What a gift
Another beautiful day in the PayPal neighborhood.
FB is buying PayPal for 250 billion
Bitcoin is not in use PayPal is....It will hit 120 this Yr...once it takes out 80 next stop is 95 two good ER takes this thing to 120.
I think the upcoming earnings are a massive indicator of where PayPal is heading. I hope they can hit it out of the park and the markets improve because then it will be a double whammy in terms of $$$$
"I’m considering switching from SQ to PYPL, what’s your opinion?"
SQ to partner with eBay...
SQUARE already has bitcoin
"also fam, who really cares if this drops a couple % when it's going to be 85 a share in January?"
Buy more and talk less!
"Breaking: Piper Sandler starts PayPal with Overweight rating, $210 targetPiper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat initiated coverage of PayPal with an Overweight rating and $210 price target. PayPal is one of the best positioned companies to take advantage of changes in consumer purchasing behavior due to the pandemic, Donat tells investors in a research note. The analyst views the company as one of the better earnings growth stories in the payments space and recommends building positions at current share levels."
I had 2 choices to make.purchase PYPL stocks orpurchase SQ stocks.I've chosen PYPL big mistake.
SQ is up 96% over the past 6 month while PYPL has been running in mud and paid 2.2B for 130M in revenues. SQ will win the race. What else does PYPL have in their ecosystem?
93 is just a number!
$PYPL is eating Visas lunch. What is management doing? They had best wisen up and wisen up FAST!
Earnings call 14 day$$$$$$
SHOP announced great earnings this morning. I would imagine most store accept PYPL??And they captured the Millennials who use venmo!!Holding long and strong!
PayPal reached its highest close to date. The record intraday close of $302.05 should be surpassed as soon as the market digests all the exciting innovative news that was revealed in yesterday’s Investor Day delivery
"PYPL is not a vaccine stock. It is an electronic payment stock. Today's move was sheer madness. The holiday season will see this equity soar. Hard currency is slowly disappearing. Following the street is ridiculous. Stay calm, this stock will be just fine."
Hope I just didn’t miss my chance to Buy in

"I'm bullish about SYF below 30. Got hit twice by the WMT news. SYF still has partnerships w/ $AMZN $PYPL. The price is currently below Buffet's avg. He owns 20.8 million shares!Not to mention that SYF increased its dividend 40%, from .15 to .21.Calls are not that expensive either. I'm holding a few 9/21 $30 calls"
"Louis Navellier has PYPL on his ""Buy"" list. This company has a great deal of upside potential with the new businesses they have acquired!!!"
Is a matter of time before pypl gets scooped up
What time are they going to announce the report today? Anyone knows?
What happened here?
I had 263 shares #$%$ bought another 137@$77.
This is a $200+ stock. Easiest way to move money around the world.
I warned PYPL shorties to cover before it topped 200...too late now. The life of a PYPL short is fire and chaos...I've owned since the split from EBAY. And I retained shares in EBAY. EBAY has made me money but not like PYPL. I am sitting on a 5 bagger with PYPL. Shorts get chump change in comparison. This stock along with SQ is the future of business payments. I use both Venmo and CashApp and both are amazing. Shorts will continue to suffer betting against this. Long and strong now and forever.
What a JOKE! God Dam worthless Pyramid Scheme is getting PUMPED Parabolically every single day! It looks like $PYPL Management is PUMPING this Worthless Scheme for the personal gains of its insiders and related parties! Bitcoin's fair value is $0 and it will FALL to $0! The supply is unlimited and being hacked is a matter of moment! Keep coding money out of thin air!
fang bubble is know for being a shorter!!!!! dont listen or read his comments
"Someone in here said 200 by Friday.. Who was that? It was not me, In my opinion, I thought PYPL would go back up from it's earnings down day but to 190-192.. Thanks for the suggestion Mr. 200.. I went out and got some calls yesterday because of that. Woot Woot!! Good luck all"

Red... Green...Red...
PayPal reached an all time high at 209.07
Less than 2%4 hours aheadLet's finish green today
what are the price targets for PayPal?
Gutted... wanted to buy more! :(
Still too early to tell how PYPL will get today. Sign of heavy volume to push PYPL higher is really a good sign for next week. FANG recovers and even moves higher tells me that traders expect good numbers for the whole. At this moment I expect 91-93 on Thursday.
Short selling until end of month. Look at last month price fluctuations. Seems to be nearly parallel
More great news! Partnership with Acorns Grow to offer Robo Investing. PYPL to 80
who will get to 100 first PayPal or SQ again.
"Should I close my position now, or still hold? Seems like it will clean up my profits?"
"Get ready for a major recapitulation towards $300. Future markets have opened in a free-fall. Apparently, new mutations of the virus are beginning to worry governments. Add growing civil unrest and the potential for more lock-downs is becoming very real. Expect PYPL to crush earnings again and grab some Crypto along with a few more shares."
about time they made a move
"PayPal Rises as It Has Best Quarter Ever, Offers Strong Guidancehttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/paypal-climbs-on-q2-earnings-release"
"Great earnings, great revenues, monster buyback.......whats not to like."
"Some major strategic initiatives at PayPal:1) Tap into the unbanked. 2) Turn PayPal into a payments platform, similar to a bank but more seamless. 3) Drive growth from Generation-Z and the gig-economy using p2p social transactions and bill sharing.4) Open up PayPal, often through partnerships, to developing and third-world countries.5) Invest towards Point of Sales integration similar to Square, but in Europe.On top of that, they are sitting on a hoard of cash to take advantage of the dips like we recently experienced...this will push up the EPS."
"Options expire today, don't forget."
uhmm revenues are up. Earnings were expected to be lower because of purchases
"I would think that PayPal has a lot of cash parked overseas and the repatriation would help PayPal quite a bit, does anyone have any insights on this?"
PayPal has such a huge run. Time to close our position and celebrate!!
Let’s see after earnings beat MasterCard drop Visa drop Apple drop Amazon drop Facebook drop yet PayPal which has been on a tear you expected what? Like I said Kevin the put buyer is the winner so far. I sold puts but I don’t think of it as a loss just buying some shares of a company I want to own. Send the shares here I’ll take them
Not good down on day of evening's reports
Buying more in the AM.
Honestly this stock should have never sold off after earnings. This was a gift. The guidance was misunderstood and people overreacted. This stock would currently be over $100 if not for the guidance reaction. Take advantage of this opportunity or miss out.
"Typical, just like last quarter. Bet eps estimates by 10 CENTS! Unheard of even with MercadoLibre effect. Revenues in line with estimates but seeing slower growth (still up 17%). So what do the MM and hedge funds do? Sell off at 2.50% drop. I have been right so far with all but one of my predictions and this one is no different. Slow growth to $110-$112 by anniversary date of IPO in July..... unless management realizes a special dividend."
BUY BIG!will see you at 350 next month!
"Numbers are good solid and justified, venom monetizing just starting, electronic payments just starting to gain traction in emerging markets. Where do you think this is going, only one way, up or bought out by major credit card company."
I just bought more PYPL at 104.70
"Billions spent buying companies (for their product offerings), 2 Billion stock buyback remains to be completed (as far as we know), new 10 Billion stock buybacks planned, holidays approaching, etc. and stock price doesn't grow, even a modest stock price increase doesn't hold, stock price decreases while every other competitor price increases. Any ideas why our investment isn’t gaining in value? Are PYPL gains being taken by high speed trading, PYPL have jaded brokers, PYPL can't integrate new software/hardware purchases into a cohesive product offering, innovation juices gone, PYPL waiting around for a reason to have a massive stock price drop... Any ideas, guesses, etc.?"
Breakout
"I thought about investing in Paypal a while ago, now after dealing with a buying some tools scam and dealing with Paypals help service, Iwouldn't touch them. What a piece of %$%@ company. Run around after run around. And as far as I know they run their customers money to this scam website and I found other on their community chat website that had run into the same website with Paypal name and payment system on it. Paypal didn't want to be bothered with it. I sent the same info to yahoo (because the ad that I clicked on was from Yahoo) they sent me an email saying Thank you and the website had been blocked. How can you trust a paypal (an internet security type company) that won't lift a finger for internet security?"
I believe PYPL will announce another deal soon. Just my gut feeling
"Cha-Ching 0h, Doctor! Bought at $90. Staying Long"
@ChuckThanks for the homework!............. Genius...........
What are your expectations for tomorrow?
GREAT Earnings. Love this company
PYPL $220 by January weeeee. Buying some more soon. Just waiting to see if tomorrow is in the red again & I’m hopping in.

This stock loves making new all time highs. Slow steady climb up. No wild swings. The kind of stock you look at December 31st and see that you’re up 35-50% for the year. These are the stocks that hold up well during a selloff. Thx high fliers are the ones that get crushed.
This looks like a paypal competitor but seems different. Not a digital currency but is giving incentives for a free signup: https://initiativeq.com/invite/H877sMCQm
"The market really want this down to $172, that’s where the huge support line sits"
"TSNP is the reall deal. ""HUMBL"" look it and do some research and you all wont regret in investing it this company, thank me later ;)"
"Nothing is wrong with Paypal nor is there an issue with Square, Payal is a in a different league than Square. Most likely what happened today was technical as it hit 80 and retreated. In the coming weeks it will retest the 80 dollar level and pass it by. Higher interest rates do not affect Paypal which has billions of dollars on it's balance sheets. It has been beating earnings since 2015."
this is a gift to enter pypl here.. going into earnings nice opportunity
$249.xx will be the all time high forever in PYPL. Save this post! Forever!
Congrats to everyone who held calls going into earnings!
Puts gonna print
Good luck guys

Back to $90!
Can more of you stock bubble people short this stock so we can get a short squeeze and push this thing over $100!

"If PYPL cannot move up, no stock can move up market."
Party is over I am holding PYPL since 2016 had a good run since they became a public traded. They reach the peak. There’s only downside from here. C ya @ 50$ again. Peace out. 
All time high yet again. Just keeps on rolling.........Roll on to $125 next
Is Yahoo having a problem with their spam filters? are they getting paid for putting out this spam?
JPM reported their earnings this morning which was positive but stated credit card sales were down 23% for the quarter. This may be the reason for the negativity but speculation on my part.
lower guidance from retail will hurt PayPal greatly. Careful buying at this level

Let's finish at 280
"If the MM is propping the stock up why is the volume 6,483,553 higher then average 6,246,212."
paypal IS buying and going to drive the price of bitcoin through the roof. people are saying that seeing you cant deposit or withdraw btc from their site that they are using some sort of internal ledger aka fake bitcoin. if so they are taking one hell of a reckless gamble. if I buy a bitcoin for $18k and it 10x and goes to $180k either paypal pays me from their cash reserve or they bought on my behalf at $18k. There is going to be an imbalance of buyers and sellers and this could bankrupt paypal if they dont buy the actual bitcoin.
does anyone recall what happened just 3 months ago when they reported good earnings?
PYPL is 10 steps ahead of the others

pypl can only be used for online right? do they have cards to use over the counter?thanks in advance.
I love this stock! PYPL forever!
i read pypl in 5 years the stock price will be 684.00 for one share of pypl
Vicious two days. Be done with it.
Taking out the all time high today. PYPL continues to be on the move. Right stock at the right time. Don’t overthink this one. Just enjoy the ride. $$$$$
"I predict that On Wednesday afternoon, the market will creep back and pop up on Thursday morning. S&P chart looks very beautiful, it may hit 2900-3000 this year. The U.S. economic is screaming, full employment and have no geopolitic conflict. I will hit more on Health care sector."
I predicted this result 11 hours ago : PayPal and Nasdaq would rebound. March 1st : Paypal resumes its swift march northward to $300 and beyond as the ER release deserves

Let’s take a step back and ask are selfs the question. Who actually uses EBay? It’s an old dinosaur that has failed to reinvent itself over the past couple of years. Shorts jump off the ship and let the longs gobble up your shares!!
"$PYPL Revenue has grown barely by 3% from 2019 to 2020, but the stock price got PUMPED by at least 150%... In the US Stock Market 3% revenue growth is being translated into 150% Market Value PUMPING???What a MEGA BUBBLE!"

Many thanks to those who sold your shares. I bought them. See you soon easily back above $200++.
PYPL investors should look at BFT $13.88 a share. BFT is buying Paysafe from Blackrock and taking it public under their SPAC. New symbol will be PSFE and it's suppose to happen the 1st qtr of 2021. Bill Foley & Blackrock heads will run this payment system. Paysafe is already doing over $100 Million in transactions. BFT is a steal at $13.88. Looking for PSFE will go over $75 to $100 in 2021. Next PYPL is PSFE.
"But, isn't SQ very different than PYPL? I mean its uses and function"

where are those Square heads?
when is PayPals next earnings date? is it before or after hours?
SQ doing $1.7B in crypto makes me curious what pypl's crypto volume is. That would only be about $30-40million in revenue if paypal ends up being the same as SQ. I foresee paypal having 20-25x that volume within a couple years... hope that is the case

The difference between the companies with ample free cash flows and without is maximizing now. Huge buy back action is kicking in.
Why is PayPal’s EPS estimates by the analysts so high for Q4? Are they expecting earnings to increase that much more due to the Walmart and AMEX partnerships?

have to expect a correction back to its 10 day. SQ is not helping the bulls. look to buy back in around 105

Not that they need the money but the Insiders who sold in May/June must be kicking themselves a little. Plus the list of Institutional holders is up there with the best of them. Vanguard and Blackrock are all in. Looking forward to seeing $250 by this time next year. We may see a dividend or split announcement by that time.

This is positive. Bump
"market down big many stocks down over 4%, paypal down 1%. enough said"
yep interested to see how this plays into earnings. should be a good quarter. we'll see.
Both PYPL and SQ are the future for money payments and transactions. These are long term holds just like V and MA. Wait for the bottom here and do yourself a favor and pick up more shares. GLTA

is this a good buy? Feel like the price are back to six month's ago. Really want start a small position.
Again ladies and gents. I called this exactly 4 days ago (scroll down). Said the stock was poised for a big breakout and voila. And I don’t use no stinking charts! My Ouija Board does just fine :))
"Man PYPL is a god awful stock. A friend, who is VERY high up in the industry, told me like 6 months ago, when PYPL gets to $200, sell it and short it back down the proverbial drain"
"Hey everyone - if you are wondering why the stock price is down today, it's because I started a long position today, and the universe hates me. Sorry about that."
"last buy was at 190, held strong to 310, down to 230, now at 240...thinking this just might be the time to add, before heading back towards 300. Bonus growth tailwinds- $PYPL will benefit from this NFT adoption taking place."

Everyone do your DD and check it out. Go to TSNPD and read. You will be amazed all they do and will do . It makes PayPal look like a step/sister. Long and strong, HMBL for life. This is a retirement stock. Not dissing PayPal just want ever to know the potential of this stock. Good luck to all."
Solid 1% or so gains daily. I’ll take that any/everyday.
BIG? where are you?
Anorther week ... another SQ significant out-performance of PYPL 13.3% versus 2.48% .... it's been this way for 2 years and will continue!!
This action is so weak. Expected so much more. Better get a jump tomorrow.
LETS GO!!!
not much movement before the call......everyone on pins and needles? lol
Venmo > Cashapp
Stop harping on a 1 cent beat and expecting a jump. Its all about outlook and it was weaker than what the run-up justified. An average report at best and it needs a market correction. This is an expensive stock considering how many competitors are out there.
What time do they release it?
can someone share the link of Paypal Q2 conference call ?
the future is a cashless society. stay long and strong PayPal for many years. mobile payments are on the rise.
just like every other quarter i'm always amazed on why people are selling on the great earnings....and like after every quarter I'll probably take advantage and pick up some more shares if it drops further. it's worked out 100% of the time.
$90 AH TOMORROW
My guess is $82 after report

"Would love to hear Cramer's take on this since he claims to have ""aggressively"" been purchasing the stock for his charitable trust."
Yeah Bitcoin price has fallen. But how many commission has Paypal made from these.....?
PYPL on mad money now$$$
Out for now. This thing has no juice. Square has the juice in this space.
PYPL no doubt up today due to Bitcoin. PYPL shorts’ finances were already on fire prior to Bitcoin but Bitcoin has only served to throw gasoline on them. 300 is coming.
The call must be good because the stock is rising 
"a nice recent quote i discovered, ""The value versus growth question simplifies the market a bit. You want to find durable growth,"" said Doug Rao, a portfolio manager with Janus Henderson, in an interview with CNN Business.""The transformation to a digital economy has been the biggest change for companies in every industry,"" Rao said. ""You want to look more for companies that are on the right side of that transformation."""

"The market makers try so hard to shake the palm tree hoping the palm will fall down, which I think it will scare some weak hands. I just pick up some calls a little further down in Feb because I believe that our economy is very strong. The market goes a little too far but the good ones always get the premium more that the peers. I guess PYPL should go back to 85 again in the afternoon."

"I am a small investor 200 shares @ $40.00 I also have bought shake shack, taser international over 134% earning? no one goes broke making a proffit fish are cut bait ( longbeard14)"
i honestly can't believe how well this stock has held up.. surprised it's not trading in the 60s..
Thumbs up if you use the new black background and like it.
Like a morgue here today. We were all SURE a big rally was coming.
It's obvious someone leaked earnings in advanced. The gain today is what tomorrow should have been.
Comparing Apple with PayPal is wrong. One has had a decade of growth and at the peak of its now and the other one is just getting started.
The SCRIPT is written by some big boys is exactly as I guess. It hit high then pull back. I think PYPL will hit new high everyday this week. BREAK OUT !

Sq Zoom pass PayPal
"intersting why paypal go into crypto-- i read this today-- PayPal’s decision to get into crypto likely has nothing to do with consumer convenience and everything to do with positioning the company for the future of disbursing government payments and subsidies. careful investors who can get past the hype will see that the value of PayPal’s BTC move is much more long-term than a brief market boost. Ultimately, it promises to turn the company into a central plank of our financial system."
$SQ and $PYPL I'm not sure how anyone could have looked at those chart this week and thought this was a good time to buy. It was clear the charts of these high flyers were a warning sign for the broader market.
Cash carries germs. Look for new venmo usage to skyrocket in the coming quarters.

"By the time earnings come out next month, AMZN will be 1200, GOOG will be 115o, and PYPL will be 85."
As much as I love to see this stock grow everyday I am debating selling. Anyone have an opinion on selling? PayPal always seems to go up before their earnings release and drop after.
Let’s break $90 after ER. Expecting a huge number and growth guidance.

The disconnect between Dow and Nasdaq will not last and Nasdaq is ready to catch up....soon. So stay strong folks!"
If PYPL would offer even a minimal dividend it would hit $180.

"forget this penny miner....just buy #BGTC, #PYPL & #SQ. You may as well go with a great scam, rather than a #AUY manangement scam....just know when to exit is all...btc up to $25.9k."
Anyone else pick up the fact big buys came in yesterday on the chart...
I must say I think that TSNP is worth buying and getting in on the bottom floor . I can buy a heck of a lot of shares for next to nothing and hold for along time to come. Maybe it will be a success worth a shot.

Already up almost a point on P coast..someone likes the earnings and news
"not switching to ayden, ebay will bow"

Glad I sold half prior to earnings.
"Earnings beat , can be down with weak guidance since there are too many things on paypal's plate(venmo, europe's xoom launch etc) to handle. Expecting 5% Down."

"Too many comments that imply short term trading in this stock. This is a stock you buy and hold for your children. It will go up and down for various reasons but the long term trend is up. You will get at least 20% growth a year for the next 10 years and if someone buys them, so much the better."
They're out on investor relations page...
Lots of PYPL shorts and nonbelievers in this forum. You all are in for a rude awakening. This is not the end. PYPL will rally and take out the old highs. And all of you will be scratching your heads wondering why you didn't cover.
Merchant accounts are a full 1% cheaper than paypal.
Short as a percent of float is 1.2%. Sorry longs...there is no short rally coming to get you higher exit prices. The current rally is distributive in nature...a fake banker's rally to draw in more longs for fleecing.
nice recovery today after being down $3.70+ and we still gained on SQ. LMAO!
"George Eastman,predicting $360 per share andthe cancellation of the Tucker Carlson show."
I am sure Paypal will blow estimates during Q1 as I think analyst are underestimating the potential of crypto revenue.
"It is no secret at this point that eBay, one of the world’s largest online marketplaces, will be replacing PayPal as its main payments processing provider. eBay had purchased PayPal back in 2002 and spun it off in 2015, but the two organisations had remained tightly linked, with PayPal continuing to process payments for eBay. Now, this will change.With the rapid growth and acceptance around the world of PayPal as a strong ecommerce payment option and PayPal being the preferred payment method for most customers who buy and sell on eBay, many may be wondering why eBay would do this.There are several reasons why this move makes sense for the company, and they all come down to the three “Cs”: customer (experience), control, and costs."

Wish I bought more today
The days for PYPL being below 200 are not long now. Unless I'm horribly wrong the next leg up in the market has begun and the correction has ended. There's a chance we may revisit these levels after the election but I don't pretend to have a crystal ball and neither should any investor. It's hard to predict what the market will do tomorrow much less a month from now. But one thing for sure is that PYPL deserves to trade at a premium.
PYPL just bought back 2.438 million shares?cool.Now who sold those shares to pypl and why did they sell so many shares?
"Again, no one is selling PayPal here. Everyone is expecting it to surpass $100 soon. Stay long."
PYPL reporting Wednesday. Will it jump to $260? Thumbs up  if you think so
"I’ll buy into PYPL again the next dip. Meanwhile, happy to see it continue to do well. I sold my long position at 87 and moved it to FDC and cannabis."
Wonderful stock PYPL. Any guesses where the stock would be at around Dec 2020?

Price on the north side of the RSI and B-Bands.. My guess is a pull back to at least 200 before it moves back up.
I really hope Options Trader doesn’t do this for a living... what a tremendously terrible market sense he has
Strong finish! Nice to see.
"PYPL is on Mad Money tonight, should be good for the stock"
"Because you want it to go up and are bidding it up, the pros are currently selling/dhorting as we speak... check the current daily chart... so is the market."
"its about time, this paypal is so under priced right now"
"You deserve it PYPL, so let's make it happen! Then, follow up with a fabulous, strong holiday season! https://www.investopedia.com/news/paypals-stock-seen-rising-8-amid-strong-growth/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo"
What is going on today????????
"After a great ER, this better jump to 100 in a week or two! ok three!"
Haven’t covered one share from my $177 short position LARGE
PYPL is showing why its a better buy than SQ right now. Solid earnings and earnings growth will trump potential earnings and potential earnings growth every time.
"100 very soon, then 150. Then 174.09, just like adobe."
Not sure what catalyst will stop this from drifting to 190
I have heard that Amazon may make PYPL their main transaction portal.Anyone else hear of this?
when earning call? today?
"Shameful to see people complaining. PYPL is up 10% since its breakup with EBAY in 1 month... that is 120% in one year if average it out. last 20 days, PYPL 14 green days 5 red days... really and people complain? Sell your stock and leave this board please."
Total capitulation holy ahit
"unbelievable, this stock deserves 100+ right now"
Can someone explain #$%$ is happening with PYPL this morning ???
Upgrades on the way mark my words!! God loves me I know it
"Buying IIIV, guidance FY19 ady eps is .79-.81c whereas SQ guided FY18 adj eps to .39-.41"
Good news and a bright future = PayPal 
5.25% down in pre???
Cathie Wood is buying more PayPal
"greetings from Germany, we all use it"
Buy SQ sell PayPal
Looks like we may hit $70 before years end. Possibly after next earnings!
$200 end of year?
PayPuke down $22 from recent highs R.I.P.
I can't find anyone that voted for the mope
A global tech stock at this price is a steal. Won't be under 100 for long so buy while you can!
"Look at SQ, PPYL about too pop!"
Why are some people bearish of PayPal?
"Missed the low in today's dip, but still added to my shares today. C'mon baby, do your holders right this earnings!!"
PYPL's 1/2 billion into UBER. ouch!
"When the multi billion dollar sale of Paypal's finance portfolio from months ago to Synchrony Financial completes settlement in the 3rd quarter, watch Paypal pounce with a huge acquisition ! This company's not stagnant, just verrrrrrry canny and strategic in its manoeuvring. Buy in now good people or watch from the sidelines while we head to $100 a share and beyond by year's end !"
Rorbinhood retail customers are in a panic. Sell Sell Sell
There you go. 47 added.Buy the dips 
that took long enough didnt it.
Let it drop to 80– buy it back up. Still long. Just way to high of expectations.
PAYPAL IS FOR THE PEOPLE
$10B buyback announced
New high.

Congratulations share holders. Hopefully this will be one of many wins in this sector.

LEGOOOOOOOOOOO BULLISH BABY
sell this
what do you think will PYPL stock be worth by 2020... exactly 5 years after its IPO ? Any guesses !
"Hmm. Don’t want it to, but it’s likely going down after er"
"The deal with Synchrony...PayPal raised its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to between $3.64 billion and $3.70 billion. The company also increased its per share earnings guidance range to 52 cents-59 cents, from 37 cents-39 cents.Is this a one time thing (the sale which adds to profit) or will this be what we can expect each quarter moving forward?Serious answers only please."
A-N-D...... WE'RE BACK!!
"People that have bailed. Y’all are crazy. Just because you don’t have instant success. Digital is the future. This is a baby and when it’s grown, the investment will benefit the ones who stayed greatly."
Over sold!!
Now paypal is free to choose who they want to work with. Ebay used to make them slower not faster.
This will be back to 115-120 soon 
One word.. VENMO. First to market and Bitcoin wishes it could be used as easy as venmo.
Gone are my chances of buying more in the 180’s 
Bidding up in pre.Let's close over 80 today!
thoughts on coming back up tomorrow?
"Added puts this morning when it was up 10%. When the market correction and downturn continues next week, we'll see PYPL in the 70s."
"#PYPL RSI and Stochastic oscillator are triggering bullish signal, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 83.87."

I’d lmao if we close green! 
Paypal should buy eBay!
"I feel like I have special power. Every single stock, the moment I touch them, they fall like a fall knife."
"Wow! Awesome buying opportunity here on an earnings beat. Buy now under $180, and just wait for the analyst's upgrades to come in. Easy money. Good luck all!"
"i think Apple buys Paypal for 120$ billion, 100$ per share"
Oops I guess we forgot to pick up one fund or another. Well be back on schedule shortly.
PYPL worth $300Why so cheap now?
$PYPL is where it's at. Safe exposure to crypto
Play the game it's going up up .
Vow...trashing such a strong stock like Pypl...Total manipulation!!!!
"No more Ebay but better option I have, which is Amazon."
"PayPal bought Israeli fintech firm Curv, buy more"
I use ebay because of paypal
PayPal breaking out nicely. Looking for 119+ in after market. Shorts got to cover with Hedge money flowing in.

Dont worry guys. The company is doing really good. Its all the external factors. Just think its perfect time to buy more. I just did that :)
Guggenheim downgrades the stock to sell from neutral

This QUIETLY surged today 
Remember pypl is just getting started with Crypto trading. This stock can only point upwards.
Cramer calling PYPL and a great ER. EBay way overplayed and already accounted for. Exactly what I said. Stock will power back up amigos.

"Told you this was going Red. Too many fees, other options now."
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH ALL THE #$%$ SPAM ON THIS BOARD!? Report it as abuse and they will flag it. Make the board mediators do their jobs!
SQ is open for business tomorrow
What was that news?
$140 after earnings
Just quit complaining and short. It’s going much lower. Growth slowed from 41% to 25%. That’s all you rookies need to know. Hope you don’t own over 1000 shares and you aren’t on margin. I think $215 is the highest this stock will ever be. $25 a few years ago was better than $215 or $175 now.
"120 by friday would be a nice way to end the week, judging by pre-market, it can be done."
quite honestly dont get the price movement on this one.
"This post says it all. Really thought it was worth reposting.After paypal analyst day the other week, where they laid out 750 million active accounts by 2025, double what it has now, and more than doubling revenue...Here is where analyst stand:PayPal price target $375 at MizuhoPayPal price target raised to $350 from $310 at CitiPayPal price target raised to $340 from $290 at Keefe BruyettePayPal price target raised to $333 from $296 at Raymond JamesPayPal price target raised to $330 from $300 at SusquehannaPayPal price target raised to $329 from $302 at Morgan StanleyPayPal price target raised to $321 from $291 at Loop CapitalPayPal price target raised to $315 from $306 at CanaccordPayPal price target raised to $310 from $249 at JPMorganPayPal price target raised to $310 from $300 at KeyBanc"
PYPL will get punished at Bitcoin drops
Word of the day....Cha-Ching.$$$$
A Pantera Capital report on Dec. 23 said PayPal was absorbing 100% of all newly mined Bitcoin supply
Thought the earnings call was super positive and gave good outlook for the further! Anyone else think so?
From here I see it as a double in two to three years.
Business opening or the stimulus isn't coming!! Something is very wrong here!!
Ok! I’m liking this breakout move in PayPal today  keep it up! Keep it up!
"Just keep buying PYPL at -0.90, I will do it all day long. At this moment PYPL is still cheap."
Market 's gonna be in correction territory at the beginning of Feb every year....
NOW we have reached the BUY level. Time to load up before new coverages ate initiated. I am all in as of this morning. I see a huge after-market purchase yesterday that filled several gaps. Be ready for a quick recapitulation back towards $290’s in todays trading - 63% probability.
"This sell off is way over done. ER was nothing short of amazing, just read the conference call. PYPL doesn't need EBay. they will begin to monetize Venmo and create new partnerships with others to replace. This company still a lot of growth ahead. I'm long and I will see you guys in December when PYPL is at $125."
Less than 2% shorts! This is amazing this surge! Will be interesting what happens tomorrow!!
About time we got this show on the road! Bring on the analyst UPGRADES!

If you guys have pypl look into Tsnp. Its going to be bigger then paypal
Looks like Harold shorted the stock or holds some put options. Also seems he's had about 2 pots of coffee already!
Last time I keep stocks when report earnings
"high beta stocks are almost always overpriced and seen as lottery ticket stocks, this causes low beta stocks like paypal to be ignored more and gives it a better valuation. plus retail chase high beta stocks.( plus some institutes, trying to beat the benchmark)it is harder to recover from a eg. 40% drop high beta, than a 10% drop low beta."
After hours not looking good....could be a buying opportunity...but why the drop off???
if PayPal doesn't make a move here it's just going stay range bound from 70 to 90 forever
"he 39 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for PayPal Holdings Inc have a median target of 127.00, with a high estimate of 150.00 and a low estimate of 95.00. The median estimate represents a +30.40% increase from the last price of 97.39."
pypl is financing my silver acquisition spree. wow! blue light special just turned on again for the metal. the silver giveaway is awesome. free wealth!
"Bull flag, targeting 116"
PayPal reached an all time high at 177.16
Really sad decline today given the blowaway earnings report. Strong reversal heading into close is expected. Either way the September bottom of $174/$175 was retested so we should be good from here.
For sure buying PUTS
$5B+ Free Cash Flow. All you need to know.
"Explain to me how their extremely profitable guidance was less than 2% from analysts’ expectations, yet we’re now down 7%! Yes, now I AM adding."

What a gift last week was
"Where are ""Big Sellers"", ""Manipulators"" today? All quiet, and covering short positions. You know they knew all along that the stock was going up, that is why they created panic for three days. The SEC never finds these guys because they are all off shore money guys connected to the top."
"Some thing is coming to the wire, I did not see yet. It got to be big news otherwise PYPL does not pop up like this."
SQ is going to hit 100 for the second time before PayPal hits it for the first time.
$209 area is our price target for nowhttps://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/let-s-look-at-paypal-ahead-of-earnings-15384075?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
"Anyone know what’s pushing PayPal down? It started day up then around 10:15 started dropping,. Any news?"
SILVER will outperform paper PYPL in a huge way.
PYPL is a cash generating machine....grossly oversold....|$105 by Friday.
Loaded up!I believe in PYPL # 1
this is sick
"Price target of $127 is looking to be a struggle, although any forward gain is welcome. Still too much side lined money waiting for the worse to come. Fortunately, I think we have seen the worse in this sector. There will be a pop in PayPal and no one will have seen it coming..."
Note that Paypal also operate in Europe where there is lock downs

"Holding PYPL and not sure why it's not up more, safer to use than going outside."
They are going to force whole bunch of shorts to cover above $200 and the stock price should stay over $200 for all afternoon to give enough time for brokerage offices to call the shorts and force them to cover.
Fintech sell off for some reason. Anyone know?
Pypl doesn’t need eBay after 2020
This is going to be a great week! Window of opportunity at these levels will close quickly. Love PYPL
good luck long !
"Honestly, I am pumped about todays retrace. Consolidation were expected after positive news. MM's will capitalize on this short-term, without a doubt... watching the VIX"
buying puts here
SQ’S COMING
Slow and steady climber
Anyone here old enough to remember $274?
"this market is close to rolling over here. fintech is vulnerable to a breakdown. selling or trimming PYPL, V, MA all is wise into earnings imo"
Selling stuff to buy this.
Let's hope that Big doesn't throw himself off a bridge tonight!
"While CVS is the first national retailer to rollout PayPal's QR code checkout, PayPal has 10 other major retailers signed up for rollout, including Nike, Tumi, Bed Bath & Beyond and Samsonite, among others. It's in discussions with well over 100 large retailers about the technology, as well."
"paypal free cash flow, is 10 times higher than squares, free cash flow is the most important measure, not net profits."
There are profoundly few shorts in PYPL. Your concerns should be addressed to longs looking to lock in gains.
I am buying all day in the $170’s
Wow must be 10million buy to cover orders entered below 140. this is going to the moon
Hello new owner
Looks like strong support is going to be around 73ish
Hopefully this keeps going up
Just crazy lately most stocks went down after Earning calls with great results. Yes agree to load up more shares
I am quadruple short $177 and redoubled down $307. About even. You can never lose if you short a bloated company like this ever just stay patient and keep doubling down leave money in cash
time for a new ATH?
Doesn't look good for after hours.... I'm thinking
"Ive got 3k to load up on either PayPal or square, I know PayPal will slowly creep up to 150, maybe square can give me a bigger increase."
Huge growth potential in China
This is the biggest down day I have ever seen in PYPL and on HUGE volume; they are going to miss & warn on earnings for sure
What other companies will use amazon pay?? Now that PayPal is freed from eBay it’s a neutral payment source that is way more important than any other news.
"I think people are shorting all these and Visa before year end/quarter end because there is no news at all for anything tanking today. Has to be the case, what else could it be? Economy is rocking!!!"
Great buying opportunity. PayPal has huge growth potential. $175 is a gift
Again!
PayPUKE down $100 in a week isn’t that great LOL R.I.P. forever
But still strong
"it's perfectly fine to own both PAYPAL and SQUARE..why are you guys so fixate on one or the other lol I own paypal, sq, mastercard, visa and they all have done very well for me. dont need to be hating and dissing each other lol"
You all having a good time out there! http://youtu.be/i0vFid2tKbI
Hold or sell before earnings?
To be completely honest yesterday's sell off to $75 was an ABSOLUTE GIFT! Not only did we get rid of the weak hands (non-believers) but I was able to buy PYPL at a nice discount.
"Gotta love the laser sharp focus of this co., Danny would never buy a fledgling music streaming service..."
Another all time high. Powerful stock and just getting started.
I guess Paypal is not surging because of Investors Day but because of Bitcoin surging. It will surge more during the event. $300 today?
I'll take it
I went up 93% took back investment and shares left to ride higher. happy happy
And we get upgraded from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $300 :D

"did any of you watched Bloomberg last night?Analyst said the Bitcoin evaluation would be 400,000because of high demand and very limited availability.Go PYPL!!!"
Any thoughts on the last 30 minutes of trading? Buy back in or is there more sell off ahead?
I'll be adding the $1400 stim to my pypl shares as soon as I get it. Any shares under $275 seem like a gift.
"So strong PYPL, maybe we will reach $95 after earnings this afternoon.."
PayPal is one of the best companies to invest at the moment.
"BUY MORE...AND MORE, EXPECTING A HUGE REBOUND TOMORROW....GOOD LUCK !"
$80 coming soon buy dips and pass go and collect you spoils mate.
"“Legend” has egg on his face ... his definition of “$249./250 forever high” lasted less than a week... PayPal hit $250.35 a few hours ago today..... on its way to $300. May hit it in the next month, with ER due in less than two weeks. Legends are often fictional... it appears he writes nothing but fiction."
PYPL just bought back 1.7 million shares
"And, in line guidance. So we have a beat on top and bottom lines and in-line guidance and the stock drops $10 after hours. I think some sellers are going to be very sorry tomorrow."
$300 could be a support level....
$PYPL is the most established and long running fintech solution on the market. Their service is seamless for users and they are only becoming more prevalent. PayPal is here to stay and several analysts have raised their price target to $200.
got in Dec @$212 out @$295 now back in @$234.50 . $275 coming
you don't even have to wait for ANT by BABAPaypal is it...Payment and banking of the World!!!
$100 before next earnings release
"Waiting for these drops since April but now that I’m in the market, it goes down...fak"
"Paypal will have its run to 90 next week, use your adbe and sq profits to add a few hundred shares at 80."
"paypal, first data and square. own them all"
Sold at 83.Hopefully earnings come in well and get back in. I think they will beat.
"Traders on the floor does not believe in Tax delay, that is the reason why the market comes back. Majority still believes the market will go higher till year end."
PayPUKE still $309? How about $261 this am? Stonks will fall 80%
UBS raises PayPal’s Target Price from $107 to $120 and they know they are being conservative !
What a JOKE! Now they are PUMPING $PYPL BUBBLE again!The Stock Price is already up by 250% in the last 9 months...Keep Gambling! BUY ALL THE PEAKS!
Get in before TSNP skyrockets into dollar land and pre-buy out! https://youtu.be/KX9AGjXCrT0
Pypl is in buying mode now.
The only one in my portfolio that is RED pypl. Go figure?
central banks are the only ones buying these hyperinflated stocks. this is a gift to retail longs looking to liquidate prior to the collapse.
I don't have any doubt in this company management team. They perform perfect so far and I believe that they have far better vision than any company in this sector. It is a little bit pricy but less risk and high growth rate. It will be cheap in 2018 because of TPV will double in 2018. E commerce and digital payment will be the key that PYPL dominates among peers.
trapped dip buyers should help with the downward velocity when scampal break south of 100.
"RSI was overbought after earnings, now oversold. Green tomorrow as uptrend continues.Has to go down by over 3% intraday before any profits need to be taken off the table.Week or two at the earliest yet in my humble opinion."
New High gonna Fly!
"How many are also trading KTPPF? Founding CFO of Paypal involved there... some financial company, seems to just keep going up $$$"
Bought the dips for apple and paypal this morning I am a happy camper!
shorts are trying everything in their power to keep it below 177. Pre market going to lose
PayPal`s subsidiary heavily invested in crypto
PYPL down 103% MORE than other FinTech because big boys want to squeeze you out and buy in because digital payment is growing... regardless and PYPL is most well positioned than anyone else. Hey? Isn’t PYPL also inter twined already with WhatsApp and its push into India payment space?
new highs nearly every day for months. is it legal for money making to be this easy?
"This is a churn at these prices. We can leave some room to run, $400 by summer!!!! "
SQ is cooler
"pypl only acts as an agent for cryptocurrency and gets its profit from the margins between the sell and buy prices from cryptocurrency to USD. it can only make tons of money from this business not loose - the ""bank"" never losses from exchanging currencies. so if the pypl stock dropped due to bitcoin concerns its ""fake news"" driven and will quickly rebound..."
near term chart does not look good
"I just don’t see why you would sell this stock now, the constant M&A’s and ever increasing online retail make Paypal such a strong company with great outlook"
"It will be interesting to see how it plays out. PYPL paid $2.2B or 13x 2018 projected revenues, $126M, to compete in point of sale transactions where SQ is already in those markets. PYPL is playing catch-up and is paying dearly to do so. How long will it take them to get back to black on that investment?"
"The market makers just use PYPL stock less than 250,000 shares to push the price down 30+ cents then big boys use less than 500,000 shares to lift the PYPL up to the green level. It is not hard for the hedge fund to manipulate price at all. It is very dangerous. I see PYPL should be 85+ this week BUT I can't hope now that it will be as I expect."
Great company
Crying babies go awayLong term3-5 years
"Holding this till 80%+ from current price, having the trading ability in papal in the near future"
PYPL price is being driven lower so gains from upcoming earning report can be re-directed away from investors who are long. I'll be moving out of PYPL now that I'm certain PYPL is too comfortable to notice that SQ is out in front and Stripe is coming up fast from behind. PYPL should be at $94-$96 right now and above $99 surrounding the earning report.
What is the good news that is making the stock surging during premarket?
"Lol, What happened to $177 Kevin"
this is collateral damage from FB miss
"Resistance will be at 70 . Once that breaks, open the flood gate to 62"
Sell it.
90 $$$$ coming soon..
This is def a gift right now. I loaded up as well
Don’t think we see much of anything until the ER is released today. Fingers crossed. High expectations.
$85 by end of the week
"there is a new startup tsnp and humbl it,s a little like paypal but only .46cents cap over1.35billoin take a look at it"
PYPL is up 6.20% to 98.47
Paypal is one of the most secure and fair payments in the world!
I’m done with the stock market. My portfolio hasn’t moved an inch since October. I gain 3% one day and lost 3.5% the next. It’s the same cycle over and over. Moving to crypto. Tired of this.
"PYPL showing some strength , maybe the bottom is in. Was way oversold"
"Excellent article on Seeking Alpha with regard to the moat PYPL has built using the virtuous circle strategy. This company can only get bigger and bigger. An excellent stock for a long term buy and hold and their are not a lot of these. A sleep well at night and in less than 5 years collect $200, Perfect in your IRA"
Lots of resistance @ $300.00. Hard to break through...
"Traditional valuation metrics are not what you use to determine fair price of SQ and PYPL. For growth stocks such as these, I look at top and bottom line growth year over year as well as over the past several years. In addition, I look to compound annual growth rate, gross profit growth, gross margins, etc. So let's dive into PYPL's growth metrics shall we? If you look at PYPL's revenue over the last several years, it has been increasing by roughly $2-$4 billion dollars a year, from $11 billion in 2015 to $21.5 billion in 2021. So revenues have doubled over the last 6 years. Gross profit has also grown substantially year over year. From 2015-2021, gross profit doubled as well. EBITDA grew explosively as well, from $2 billion in 2015 to $5 billion this year. Cash and cash equivalents have grown at an astounding rate too over that time period, increasing every year. Free cash flow also increased 2.5 times from 2015 to this year, more astounding growth. And over the next 5 years it is expected to do that again. Earnings growth rate over the next 5 years is an impressive 22 percent. Market implied 5 year EPS compound annual growth rate is an impressive 27 percent. So overall, when it comes to the important metrics, PYPL checks all the boxes for me."
"mega safe stock, institutes love it"
Close positive!
"The Navy and Marine Corps messages, issued Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, reference an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to implement the Department of Defense Global Campaign plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases 3551-13."
Shorts in trouble on PYPL/ 18 million shares short or 3 days to cover .. u r crazy to short this here
"So...this might sound bad but I juts finally opened a PayPal account. What I have found out is this service is clearly the best out there. They are working with banks not competing with them,working with google (can pay through Google Pay or even GMAIL) and its so easy to use. You can put all your accounts and cards in one place and transfer money to and from where ever. GLOBALY!The one thing I would like to see is a marketing blitz as I can be the only one that doesn't think about using PayPal .They also need to emphasize their superior security.The key to this is user growth like everything else and these types of services have a long way to go. This is the only option for online shopping if you're educated about what it is ."
"Its down today because of SQ, Earnings, and Trade Wars. It will bounce back"
Let’s take out the 52 week high and make our assault on $90!
Paypal said it will eventually allow people to pay through Btc and also they only allow you to buy in the usa rn. When it rolls out globally and when they eventually allow payments through bitcoin both paypal and btc will rise together even further.
This gains won't last tomorrow or Monday.
"wow if the nasdaq turns red for no reason, imagine what will happen when elections come and there is ACTUAL reason to panic"
I wonder if Google is interested in buying PYPL
Jumped out at $90 and regretting it since. This is a solid growth stock. Waiting for a dip to get back in
PayPal is a 250 billion company this year
PayPal! PayPal! PayPal! Amazon pay and apple pay wish they were paypal.
Another buy rating. I wonder when this one hits 200 again.
"I still confirm that FB, ADBE and PYPL are the stocks that will hit new high and BREAK OUT."
The push into earnings?
Amazon is a monopoly and should and will be broken up.....
How much revenue and profits will Paypal generate in Q1? Somebody has some clue?
hotels.com now has paypal option
"Ok, lets hold the $80. mark this time"
"If anybody did their research and read the conference call transcript, you would see that eBay doesn’t have much of an effect. This is what I got from it. “But assuming no acquisition, eBay becomes approximately, at the end of the operating agreement about 4% of our TPV”"
Instant transfer-to-bank feature will increase small business users as well as person-person usage. Another step in the right direction for PYPL!
Im guessing that PYPL ends the week around $193 or 4....
This stock is a big long term winner.
Buy time for PYPL holders to average down. wont get this chance everyday.

Why are people selling Paypal when Bitcoin price tanks? Bitcoin is here to keep surging. Some correction is normal. At the same time the more volatile Bitcoin price is the more transaction which is good for Paypal.
Am I the only one that actually enjoys flagging all the bubble accounts as spam and watching them disappear?
"Square is overvalued, and weak margins. PayPal has Venmo, better than cash app, and much stronger balance sheet."
Jack Dorsey sold some Square shares so he could buy $PYPL
C’mon Danny boy! Give us a big ER!!
what just happened?!?!
PayPal is not messing around. Good business fundamentals. Good leadership. Good strategic acquisitions. Good values. And most of all Good timing. PayPal is now a need to have and not a nice to have. Welcome to the safe haven of stocks for the next several years. We’ll see some dips Here and there but this baby will continue to move higher.
"I would not be shocked if PYPL hit 100 by Thursday,"
Can it still go up tomorrow?
Bye bye plaid  maybe time to dump this for $PYPL now 
sinking fast just like Square!
Like I said this was no surprise for the longs. This will be a steady climber in the portfolio for the next 5 years.
Companies like PayPal can be a good tool in these virus situations. you can still transfer money without getting infected......
"[serious] why is pypl down today? Not just all the markets are up but payment systems like SQ, V, MA, up bigly."
are insiders selling?
I will love a reacción tomorrow like TSLA
Saw news about a mixed shelf offering they just filed. Doesn’t that dilute existing shares?
Earnings out. Beat by $0.04 per share.
Buy now or wait for a dip? Pls don’t say just buy lol! Sensible suggestions...
"now, let's think big and go to 200 by the end of the year!"
All this negative talk? Yet up $3+.
Back to 250 tmr glad I loaded up today 
SQ will be $100 after earnings
"LOL!! I guess Paypal's steel and aluminum will cost them more money to buy!! Yea, where do these money runners come from bum F Egypt???"
Some heavy duty players were loading up today. Traded strong. Big upside in the near future Imo.
Probably a buying opportunity for those wanting to hold long on PYPL. Nothing inherently wrong with this company just topped a bit and the dynamics of the September pre-election environment.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Rumored to be in Talks to Acquire PayPalDetails:https://theheadlinereporter.com/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-paypal/
PYPL will blow the numbers away especially forward guidance with new acquisitions. $95 Thursday morning minimum!!!
Why is SQ up 22$. Doesn't PYPL do the same thing. I don't get it.
"Can't wait for stock trading and people cashing out their crypto gains. Not only will paypal take a chunk of each, but what are people going to do with their gains? Spend it at merchants and paypal will take 2.9% of each transaction!"
"I always wonder if PYPL would try to buy Adyen before Adyen becomes eBay's payment partner. Either way, PYPL is one amazing company."
"If you look at the times and shares, there are purchases of 15,000-50,000 shares at a single time. Institutions are buying up shares. A low float can cause share price to be more volatile and in this case PayPal could see 5%-10% gain if it keeps up."
Very disappointing stock...been in at 80
"For all those doubting paypal and touting square, don't underestimate the ceo of paypal, he is one of the best visionaries out there. Since becoming independent, his execution has been phenomenal. Not to knock square, they are more of an emerging company, I own both for a while, big profits in each"
PayPooch holding up well compared to square.
My left nut for a PYPL BABA JV agreement in the next 30 minutes!
Get ready to buy
100 billion. Don’t see it stopping here
"Wow, breaking $200 is a significant milestone. Let's hope $200 soon becomes the unbreakable low baseline."
$301 after hours .. . Gotta get in before Bitcoin rips higher over the long weekend?
Can we pass 75.68 before the close?
Maybe the best positioned stock going forward. All Longs you haven’t seen nothing yet. Big Fund money moving into PayPal. I love owning stocks like this at the beginning of a major move upwards. Enjoy amigos! $$$
one of the few that will grow in this special situation
"Earnings release expected in just 5 weeks. Results will drive next leg. If market remains steady, or improving, and if PYPL provides another beat with positive guidance, i would expect the stock to make new highs and march north to test the 100 mark. IMHO"
Bought the dip. Hope this doesn't drop more tomorrow....
"Who don't buy PYPL now will be sorry, because it will reverse as usual. PYPL is too good to go down for this long. Watch the peers they are all green."
PYPL reversal will happen faster than a Chetah on ExLax. Shorting would be insane!
Wells Fargo Says Buy The PayPal Dip
Call options at the July $95.00 and $100.00 strike heavy on buy contracts.
"Glad I shorted this pos. 139 next on deck. They get TWO upgraded to 170+ and this tanks lol. Not going to lie I've been using paypal more than ever lately...100% of the people I've done transactions with all had an account...unlike venmo or cashapp where 80% did not. Even I know this drag is unjustified,but I'll gladly make money on it."
Death Cross has occurred to PYPL today (50-day moving average crossing below 200 day)
"(Market Realist) PayPal (PYPL) and Google (GOOGL) have expanded their payment partnership, showing that they're finding more ways to work together despite their rivalry. In the most recent example, Google added PayPal to its Google Pay platform."
BACK TO ATH!
I think PYPL will report $1.09 in earnings. Whats your thoughts
PYPL long term 
PayPal is up 4.90% to 115.14
245$+Simple
MACD indicator for paypal finally reversed to green today.
"You want to stay in /hold this stock because one of these days (and imo I think it’s coming soon) off of partnership or expansion, that $PYPL can shoot up 7.5-10% in a day"
This makes me feel better about the refund they forced me to do on a sold item recently..
I am up 40% on paypal. Love this stock

bitcoin will not freeze your account as pypl does as a matter of policy for any reason really.
"PYPL in China presents a tremendous revenue source! AXP was first banking company in China, so I thought. PYPL is gradually becoming the Worlds Bank!"
Check out TSNP and Humbl merger. This new company is expected to be the next PayPal but with a Crypto currency twist. very interesting at a ground floor price.

Andrew Left said on Bloomberg that his kids could have done better with stocks over the last 3 years than he has. Why do people care to listen to this guy?
"With the recent price swing, I've seen some comments on the possibility that PYPL would be buyng their shares. I'm assuming that it's on the open market. What I don't know is how PYPL is required to document that. Does the quantity of Shares outstanding change, and if so, is there a requirement on how long that delay can be, before they have to update the Available Shares?"
"Look at PYPL's history.In the last 2 years - Large dips / drops 18%11%12% 6%7%Now it is at 8%.It ""Can"" drop another 10% which IMO highly unlikely but even if does, PYPL will still be up 30% for the last year. It is currently up 40% for the last year."
Excellent quarterly results. Guiding down a bit so that next earning will be a blow-out.Enjoy the ride to $150 over the next 6 months

"ayden if it IPOs at the price they are setting, it shows how underpriced paypal is. they are really over hyping ayden with all this claimed valuation.ironic how when i end up on EU sites to order stuff i see PP as a option, don't even see ayden, many of the EU sites offer discounts for even using PP overs CCs for overseas customers. i talked to a UK business over there chat function. i was told it was easier the refund the extra VAT charges that we are billed up front thru PP after the order is completed than it would be thru CCs when using their automated shopping cart systems.some of the EU sites do not translate to english, when i ask thru their contact system about ordering, setting up a order, how to pay since i can't navigate cart, pay CC, or if they take PP. right off the bat, they respond we take paypal"
"More of the same old, same old. Expectations grow past deliverance. Until free cash flow is used for even a small dividend shareholders will not get anything close to what they anticipate. Well this old dog didnt get bit to bad this time. Pared some of my shares at a little over $129.00 I learned."
Great time to buy in my opinion
If Paypal beats expectation and provide a nice Q1 guidance on Bitcoins then we can expect a huge surge.
Ebay announcing to work with another payment company
Pal.. please check out GROW. I have a new position in it. It's primed to break out.

"Breaking news, Disney just announced that they will be closing 20% of their brick and mortar stores as they move to more e-commerce. HELLO PAYPAL.Re-opening, all good, but the world has embraced technology to it’s fullest.The real re-openings travel etc will be another area PYPL seized on.Hold your shares, add if you can, and know you are in a behemoth of finance, tech and crypto."
What’s going on after hours?
LOW making ne lows. Housing collapse confirmed. Let's spend more money we do not have with PYPL. Is this why paypal is getting aggressive with a growing number of delinquent accounts?
@Mike they are launching this month get ready for take-off. It’s HMBL not HUML 2 different stocks it trades under TSNPD and ticker will change to HMBL on 3-26
looks like I just made $400 on PayPal the last 5 minutes of the day by selling a credit call spread (170/180). Good earnings just not good enough.
Low volume manipulation. Possible position reallocations. Stay long.
I love how volatile PYPL has been the last 2 weeks. Been making a small fortune flipping options daily! Keep it up! LOVE IT
"Recommend UNH, earnings growth rate, revenue growth rate is around 18-20%, the most impressive is profit margin gets even higher. See you at 235+"
1 word... explosion. U heard it here annoyingly first and often
"Ready to gut it out for the long haul. The business model is great. The projections are awesome, and management will be continuing an aggressive share buyback program.I guess I will have to hunker down for a while, but when people realize Jerome Powell is not a great communicator, and the Fed will take care of the market and be fine, things will right themselves. Powell is committed to this as is Treasury Secretary Yellin. Powell is a poor communicator, but he will do what is right, and the market is a safe haven. Everyone wanted a pullback to get in, well here you have it. And don’t forget the market is your only option and the Fed will not let it get damaged with all of the nation’s pension funds tied to it.$PYPL is a bargain and a great place to park it until we move forward on the macro level.Stay long and strong.Good luck all."
"Love PYPL, will BLGI compete soon?"
"Don't use PayPal for your business...Below is our experience as a small business selling online to make a living.A buyer purched a CookingSet of value $249 from our eBay listing on July 12, 2019 ""buyer eBay ID:cha403-svi0wp2ps, Joe Chambers, North Little Rock, AR 72116"". The item was shipped and delivered on time (July 18) with FedEx tracking record.The buyer filed consecutively to PayPal two cases of ""item not received"" and ""Item not as described"" without any supporting evidence and just buyer's self claims. Obviously, these two claims can't be both true at the same time.Amazingly, PayPal ruled in favor of the buyer and debited the purchase price $249.99 from our account including $20 chargeback. We called PayPal and eBay, both said they can't help. eBay does not want to step in because the case is filed at PayPal, eBay even does not want to send the buyer a message asking to return the item to us. PayPal says it's buyer's cc company decision, not theirs, making every excuse. We pay fees to PayPal and eBay for all sales. When things happen, they all refuse to step in. When society becomes less moral and enforcement/justice organizations choose the easy ways for themselves, the consequence to the society and PayPal are not very nice."

"Big, big day for PayPal... more to come!"
Great setup for explosive earnings. $95.00 at minimum. Guidance will be the best with new acquisitions.
I'm going shopping tomorrow
"Just got news from a contractor that PayPal has something big coming soon. She wouldn’t say anything more than that, but I’m pretty excited to see what PayPal has in store for all of us."
I love PayPals interface and their company but their stock can never gain traction. It’s sad haha.
SO HAPPY WITH EVERYBODY. UP UP HULA
Feels like PYPL chart is rolling over. Risky buying here IMO. Better buy around it's 52 week lows and below.

Just opened my Paypal Account after a long time away. I noticed they are selling BITCOIN now. If this stock is linked to CRYPTOS im still not sure about CRYPTO but it doesn't hurt to be in for the ride up. Sure hope it follows it trend upwards. This could lead to hand over fist buckets of money $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$PYPL is where it's at. safe exposure to crypto. Volatility increases volume and larger profits no matter the cost of crypto
"PayPal: Helping make digital payments the standardOne of the trends that got a significant boost as a result of the pandemic was the shift toward digital payments. This was partially the result of increased adoption of e-commerce, but it was also due to the pressing desire for touchless payments as people and businesses looked for ways to reduce the chances of customer interactions spreading the coronavirus. No fintech company is better positioned to benefit from that ongoing change in consumer behavior than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).The digital payments pioneer was already thriving, but COVID-19 kicked its growth into overdrive. PayPal moved quickly to roll out QR codes to provide additional touch-free payment options.In the first quarter, PayPal added more than 20 million net new accounts, as its growth rate on that metric rose 17%. This brought its total to 325 million accounts, and that could be just the beginning. The company reported that after the close of the first quarter, it saw dramatic gains in transactions throughout April, and adoption and engagement trends accelerated in May.""I would argue that April was probably the strongest month for PayPal since we became a public company,"" said CEO Dan Schulman in a May interview with MarketWatch. That strength continued into May as PayPal reported the largest single day of transactions in the company's history -- beating out 2019's Black Friday and Cyber Monday results. Digital payments are the future, and PayPal is helping pull that future into the present."
should have bought Mastercard after the pull back in fintech. PYPL is dead money.
Dear God..
Time to short this company. It's heading downward.
“Reinstating and raising guidance based on strong momentum”!
"There is a very definable, reliable, and exciting uptrend line in place for 7 months now. The 50-Day Moving Average has been tracking along with it as well. This technical feature can very reliable and provide an idea of where support is and when sentiment changes. I've seen trends like this last for a long, long time. When you think about other ""disrupters"" like AMZN or other FANG stocks, they were once below 100 as well, and look at them now. It is entirely possible that PYPL could reach several hundred or even higher in the next few years. Selling here would be very foolish. If the stock is over 200 in 2019, wouldn't 76 look cheap? Or over 300 in 2020, even 100+ would look cheap. This one should be held and added too on any pullbacks. I'm hoping the uptrend remains intact and provides smart money the type of confidence needed to keep adding to their positions."
"folks, Pypl is a wonderful stock for buy and hold, and this company has everything going for them... the reason why were struggling us due to the dow nasdaq etc... just hold on"
Paypal in its sector is what the Hoover is to the vacuum.
"Look at the TREND, the financial world changes really fast. Digital payment stock sector will shoot up, without doubt. Who has ecosystem and BRAND. V, MA,and PYPL have the best brand. PYPL has the best ecosystem among three. VENMO will be the big winner, PYPL knows it. That is the reason it keeps pushing VENMO. Wait until it monetizes VENMO, we may see PAYPAL credit card to go against V and MA."

"""While Libra won't be run by Facebook - but rather by a nonprofit association and backed by relatively stable government money "" HAHA! This will be a failure."
NFTs taking off and all over the media. Crypto gaining widespread adoption and continuing to grow. It just so happens that PayPal supports purchase of Ether which is the currency driving the Etherium platform and the implementation of choice for NFTs and up-and-coming DeFi apps.

Big buys silver when it spiked in September yet longs are bagholders 
"When a stock is sporting a 66 P/E, any hiccup can and usually does cause damage. PYPL took a slice of the 24.4 billion EBAY processed in just the last quarter. You do the math, it's serious money. While EBAY does a serious volume with PYPL,which represents a higher profit margin than other transactions. That said, EBAY represents a continually smaller portion of PYPL revenue; and VENMO which they own, is on fire, growing like mad. We need more info from mgmt to more accurately gauge the growth effect. I don't own shares but am synthetically long, having some a couple of ATM leaps--JAN-19 at the 77 1/2 strike. Longer term, time will definitely heal the damage as platforms are where to be for growth. This is not where you want to park money short term or if you'll need it during the next year. GL."
You guys want growth? Buy $SQ or $PYPL or even $CAJ......thank me later
The whole CNBC lunchtime has been discussing PYPL and the consensus is the stock is about to breakout to $100. All aboard!

It will be very interesting to see how successful the Burger King promo with Venmo works out.
Yet another all time high. This company just loves making all time highs. I got into this one early after the IPO mostly because I use PayPal for one of my businesses everyday and was familiar with the company. It’s been a big winner and we are just getting started. No end in sight.

"Im am very excited about this market rotation right now and if you are long PayPal you should be excited as well and here’s why:PayPals growth story has only got better every quarter in the last 12 months. As big money rotates out it gives people who have been in this stock for years a chance to start buying back in at an awesome discount. I will be allocating a majority of my investment money every 2 weeks into PayPal and square. These are $1,000 stocks in 3-5 years. Businesses crushed by COVID Won’t get that money back. Everyone isn’t going to come back and spend 3-4x the amount of money to make up for the money they didn’t at brick and mortar. That money is gone forever. It’s been funneled into tech."
PayPal PaysWell...GL
Back over 78 again

and its ignoring the market sell off! well deserved paypal
It is at resistance and at a top. Would not chase this just yet.
Silver is a myth!
"everyone I know uses venmo. I started using it. seems like the next big thing. our kids drive these markets, not us."
hey pal! where are you going?!?!! Lmao.
BINGO REPEAT -- NO juice here. It's listless. In this space SQ is the place! BINGO. Just another 3-4x of PYPL again today ... as it has consistently over past 2 yrs. PYPL return has been very good ..... but SQ's has been 4x better ... and the differential is being maintained !! SQ is just fantastic and getting better .... all aboard the SQ train!!
250 any minute guys 
What do you mean you dont own PayPal
75k shares
Long-term holders: PYPL can double from this price to $250 in two years!
Finally some action :)
Earnings beat no doubt in my mind!! See yaa at 200
Close above 107 today :)
Today is the day $SQ will pass $PYPL in share price. GLTA
Figured the stock would sell off after earnings. Although they raised yearly guidance they fell fractionally short on revenue next quarter.......that was the fly in the ointment. Let the sellers sell and then jump back in. The sell off is overdone
"If you try to time the market and sell, especially a stock like this you will get burned. Just hold easy $500 end of year￼"
If own shares of PayPal then you own some Bitcoin indirectly through PayPal  Is that the logic here 
Discount
Awesome finish. Bodes well going into ER. Blast off from here amigos!
no rate cut today means .5 t0 1.0 cut in july. that means 2.25 cut to 1.25 fed funds rate. the emergency is absolutely real and the panic will be epic. remember...buying low and selling high is the ONLY way to profit. Silver continues to be at giveaway prices. PYPL....lol!!!
First City Bankers doubling their position.Len Berwick jr. my source.
Sell $SQ and $PYPL and move your profits to $BFT
Profit tripled lol
PYPL vs VISA - Which one to buy?
"low 5yr beta of 1.09, you do know low beta stocks outperform high beta stocks."
Still slept on! Easily $100+ here soon.
Need my July $300 calls to print. With BTC at 60 k already... me thinks it will happen!
How can any company lose 20$ per share for no reason.But Suprisingly SQ is out preforming us @ 8 $ per share.

I have a friend who works as a Wall Street Analyst. He knows nothing ...no ...he knows LITERALLY NOTHING but where to buy cocaine and how to order wine at fancy restaurants.
BACK UP TO ABOVE $200 AGAIN BY TOMORROW...AND BEYOND THIS WEEK...JUST LOADED more cheap shares...
If you wanted to buy PayPal you may just have missed your opportunity. IMHO anything under $275 is in the WAY Overcorrected price.
I think PYPL will report $.57 earnings. Anybody have any thoughts.
Glad to see that E-die is free falling lol
try sooooo hard to put down PYPL https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-alert-levi-korsinsky-llp-205100547.html

some other guy also spread false statements about Pypl missed deleted his posts.
What a move AACG longs! Look @ ACRX climb; ACRX 100% technical Buy rating; ACRX about 500% upside per Yahoo PT (avg analysts).$pypl $pton 2 other big winners!

"From adyen's website: PayPal is a global wallet for online payments. It has 173 million active customer accounts and is available in 203 markets and more than 100 currencies. Once registered with PayPal, customers can buy from multiple merchants without having to enter payment details again. Do some research, folks. The reported ""ditching"" by eBay is exaggerated if not false."
it seems like various efforts are being made encourage the buying of pypl. it is almost as if various groups are are begging that pypl stock be bought. could this be evidence of distribution by large pypl longs?
"I own all the fintech plays: Apple,visa, MasterCard, Square and PayPal. Payments is next frontier of tech innovation."
"After seeing this investing in stock market doesn't make sense any more. Trading is the only way to go. Fundamentals of a company doesn't mean anything anymore.Look at the numbers of amazon and the huge drop afterwards. Amazon beat the numbers again big time and the strongest quarter is ahead of them and Amazon lost nearly 15% in a few days. Tesla one of the most overvalued stocks ever would have been up 30% up with beating consensus by miles like paypal did. Why should someone invest in stocks anymore when you just need to buy and sell before earnings. Why go through all the ups and downs holding a stock long time when you just need to buy and sell before earnings. I am pretty sure if paypal had failed big to meet expectations stock would be up huge afterhours. And paypal have not only lost afterhours big, paypal lost already in the last few days 20% and also for no reason. This is not a normal correction, this is a small crash."
"Sure win to $300.If $320 is more happy.Earning, See you."

"Bitcoin, which some view as a barometer of speculation in financial markets, rebounded back above $50,000 on Wednesday after more buying of the cryptocurrency from Square."
really good day to pick up some shares today!
PayPal is the future of banking. This stock will only go up.
"MF article is a must read. As the cliche’ goes, “ Steady Eddie always wins the race.”‘PayPal is expecting revenue to increase 20% to 25% in the fourth quarter and TPV and earnings per share to grow double-digits. These are strong numbers, but they don't match growth from newer start-ups like Square. But PayPal's revenue far exceeds Square's, and sales growth around 20% is healthy for a company its size. That typically means less vigorous stock growth, but lower risk. This explains why Square is up more than 200% year to date and PayPal is up about 100%, which isn't too shabby. But Square trades at 330 times trailing 12- month earnings, while PayPal trades at 81 times earnings. PayPal has an established brand and high long-term growth prospects. It faces some competition, but it stands out with its large network and innovative payment solutions. I would say that PayPal is a low-risk stock with the potential for high gains for shareholders.’"
Great buy adding more on the pull back
Oversold like everything else. BTC is not the company and the company is not BTC. So sell if you want. It’s a dumb move IMO.
"This is a nothing burger downgrade, just a buying opportunity..."
"If PYPL ever hooks up with amazon web site, stock goes to $100."
$275+ tomorrow 3/1/21
buy zone is $92.45- $97.07 were going up after forming small consolidation after a handle … If earnings are good enough we can easily see $98+
NOW DOWN 27 CENTS AH. IM FREAKING OUT!
A lot of insider selling the last few weeks but the stock keeps rising. That bods well for the future and how undervalued this stock is.
Are u invest for long term or day trading! I am holding my SQ and PayPal for a very long time!!
Looks like the gas is back on?
anyone buying PYPL at these prices?
Gap is filled
"PayPal Holdings Inc.'s profit tripled in the fourth quarter as the company capped off what it called the strongest quarter in its history, fueled by accelerated adoption of digital payments during the pandemic.The company reported net income of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 a share, up from $507 million, or 43 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. PayPal's (PYPL) GAAP earnings per share for the latest quarter included a 60-cent net gain from strategic investments.On an adjusted basis, PayPal earned $1.08 a share, which came in ahead of the FactSet consensus, which called for $1.00 a share.PayPal generated $6.12 billion in revenue for its December quarter, up from $4.96 billion, while analysts were expecting $6.09 billion. This marked the first period in which PayPal reported upwards of $6 billion in quarterly revenue.The company's total payment volume (TPV), or the value of transactions made across the platform, rose to $277 billion from $199.4 billion, while analysts were calling for $267.9 billion. Venmo's TPV rose 60% to $47 billion, whereas the FactSet"
PYPL is under distribution. Check the volume. What is the news going to be?
Going to wish you bought more.
"ever notice how venmo is for years now touted as ""will one day be profitable""?"
TPV slide: “Deceleration primarily driven by slower growth in eBay.”
"The advantage of PYPL vs SQ: whenever there is a pullback, to PYPL, it is an opportunity for the $12B buyback program to purchase and decrease the number of outstanding shares; but for SQ, that means more buyers are trapped at the higher prices."
Goodbye shorts! KaBOOM to whatever paltry profits you made this week.
This stock looks pre-loaded. Smart money is being dumped in right now keeping it from dropping as much as the rest of the market. We’re going to see panic buying once this market gets kick started by a good catalyst and PayPal will seen a hefty rise in a weeks span. The whole market is just looking for the catalyst
I sold my stocks and I’m in big with 202.5 7/31 calls I bought 30 at 1.45 this will blast for earnings !

How will this impact the stock near earnings time? Competition between Mastercard and Visa and both are competitors of PayPal. Hopefully this doesn't interfere with this stock https://www.investors.com/news/mastercard-stock-mastercard-pressures-rival-visa-bid-earthport/
"the price action is so smooth, that traders cant trade it, so only buy and hold types on it, what we want!!"

added so much more
"something i read about bitcoin, Investors are long-term holders focused on Value & Speculators are short-term holders focused on Price. meaning 2/3rds of the supply hasnt moved!!!"
Any ideas why PYPL price is not performing? Why there is a very slow rise but extremely quick fall and won't hold $90 and not keeping up pace with any other competitor? - Nothing but promises. Best appears to be sideways and downward price movements.
"I'm buying more PYPL shares today,still has great growth"
"View WatchlistPayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) shares rose more than 2% on Friday after the company confirmed that it would acquire iZettle in a $2.2 billion all-cash deal. The move is significant because it marks PayPal's entry into the point-of-sale transaction business, which puts it in direct competition with Square, Inc. (SQ) and Intuit Inc. (INTU). At the same time, the company’s core business has been very robust ahead of its investor day coming up on Thursday, May 24.iZettle was previously gearing up for its own initial public offering, in which it planned to raise $227 million, valuing it at about $1.1 billion. The company is one of the largest payment processors in Europe and has operations in 12 markets, including Northern Europe, Mexico and the United Kingdom. With shares trading higher, the market appears to see many synergies in the business despite the lofty acquisition multiple.

Expect early $90’s end of this week and around $100 after great numbers due in next weeks ER... Go Paypal !! World leader in its field 
"Get ready for the next leg up. Remember, management raised guidance for the year. The pandemic is still raging also, unfortunately. Cases in Florida and other states are still on the rise. Online shopping is in its infancy still with a lot of growth left. Also, PayPal is EXPANDING their business into other areas. The future looks bright. Buying every share I can with my spare cash "

"Tip: I luv PAYPAL & did great in 2020. I am now in NCR (National Cash Register) cause no matter where you physically shop and pay you gotta have a checkout. e.g. Walmart converting more to self-checkout... so next time you shop there look down in the glass of the scanner... which company name you see? Next ATM you use,,,,looks who makes it. When USA goes back to work and spends money at Fast foods, (Chick- fill-a, Wendy, Steak houses, many mom and pops to, etc.). Who you see? NCR that's who..... largest in the industry for $34 per share .... and running up! NCR buying other companies too! PAYPAL and SQ is great but stalling out. - just saying. NCR is already in place, everywhere over many countries too and is upgrading and expanding. ""Back to work"" means NCR grows much larger, much faster!Now you know too!"
Down 5% from recent highs; anyone old enough in here to remember $249+?
things aren't looking good … the Nasdaq basically rebounding to levels at opening yesterday and this stock is up only $.24 cents... super frustrating I think people are pessimistic towards earnings today

"It is about the year end now, so the P/S should be based on at least 2019 revenue of Honey. Let's assume Honey's revenue will grow 100% again for 2019 ( it is pretty easy from an internet company with $100M as base ), then the P/S should be 20; though it still looks pretty expensive, but with the huge number of merchants and consumer users from PayPal, for 2020, it is not too aggressive to assume Honey's revenue to grow 150% to $300M, and the forward P/S suddenly become much more reasonable 13.33. Considering Honey has been profitable and with no debt, the acquisition price is high but still making sense to me.And by the way, if you ever founded a startup, you would know how amazing it is to just go through Series B fund raising and the company can generate enough positive cash flow to be self-sufficient. Either Honey has an excellent economics or their management team is superior, or both. This is a quality deal."

"Why do you people hate those that try to help.Look, I am in PYPL and getting my nuts kicked in today, but not like this, and I feel $PYPL will be fine as it has huge earnings and greater earnings potential. NIO, my former favorite stock, until they failed to act with all the cash they raised.I posted this yesterday with mixed reviews. Don’t hate the messenger. I know this stock better than most of you.Real_Stacey KronchReal_Stacey Kronch17 hours ago$NIO conversationI was probably the biggest bull on this NIO board and in my account from June 2020 until a couple of weeks after NIO day. I did not short this stock, because it is against my principles, but I knew it would tank. I liked the secondary offerings , which I thought they were going to deploy their war chest on expansion in every area. The factory issue is pathetic. The raised about $5Billion of our American dollars and seem content to sit on it. That turned me off, and when you combine legacy autos deploying cash for the EV sector, they have lost a great deal of momentum and trust. Now, I get the tech trades are suffering. I recently moved into $PYPL which has taken a whipping with the overall NASDAQ, but I am sorry, I will stay with PYPL and shun this. The cash in PYPL is real, the expansion is real and their massive revenues are equating to strong earnings. It may be rocky for a while, but $PYPL will bust out after this down cycle to new highs.NIO, once my favorite tech play has been very disappointing, and questionable what they are doing with cash.To my long term NIOites on this board, I issue this caution out of loyalty to you. Remember the November dilution. The locked up shares awarded to those that brought the secondary to market in November, free up late this month. Be careful as the float expands and more shares hit the market.Once again, very disappointed in NIO and am someone suspect on all these cash raises via dilution. Just wanted to remind those about the unlocked shares coming to market in a couple of weeks.I feel better in $PYPL and will have some exposure to China through their arrangements with Alipay.I hope it works out with NIO, but please proceed with caution. Good luck to all on my former board hangout.NIO owes me nothing, I did great with them.I hope to see some of you around, and NIO does deploy some of the cash they raised from the American equity market.LessNeutral"

Ebay market cap = $42B. $9B revenue for 2016PYPL market cap = $102B. ~$11B revenue for 2016Who's helping who? PYPL makes more. A lot of people don't even use Paypal on Ebay. I don't see the cut hurting PYPL enough to cause this drop. Total overreaction. PYPL is proven and ubiquitous among many pay sites.
"Next resistance level of 235.22 in sight. Looking good in pre-market, yet have to keep my eye on options trading today."
"It would be interesting if PYPL says “we are welcoming in any of cryptocurrency blah blah” which, leads to 1000% for less than a month for sure. I hope it won’t happen but I will glad to take profit if it happens."

$80’s secure onwards to $90. Love this stock. Arriba!
wow whats going on AH
Cheap
"Is Paypal expensive now? Yes, it certainly is. But we still don't know how much Paypal has made from crypto in Q1. I believe revenue is huge. Not to mention that Square only make money in crypto from Bitcoin while Paypal also has Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. There is still QR-payment when we get to normal I believe alot of stores will implement QR-payment."
"Gap between Leader Paypal and lagger Square continues to widen, $30.10 difference today.... Sq... just a speck in the rear view mirror... Paypal onwards and upwards!"
Yes Barry...buying richly valued stocks and selling undervalued stocks is the way to go. It has been a hard road for the value investor. Fed rate is at 2.5 % which gives us 10 quarter point rate cuts to zero. Should put PYPL at 300 too 600 the next two rate cuts. Yes the economy is imploding. Yes the fed will buy stocks like pypl to support the illusion. Get on board.
today hurt me more than my wife leaving me for our family doctor.
"I still stay with PYPL and add position on GOOG, base on steady earnings growth and safety. I feel like GOOG is coming to compete with AMZN for the home products. such as GOOGLE HOME, GOOGLE MAX which I see GOOG has better products than AMZN. GOOG has better AI than anybody because GOOG has played in this field way longer than anybody else."
So how many people have Bitcoin exposure and PayPal stock? That doubles the risk.
"TOMORROW we will have July 4th fireworks early in the morning, because Janet will give us the farewell present, couple with the exploded earnings report today. I WILL REVEAL THE NUMBER FROM THE FAR EAST, SEE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT PYPL."
this will double
Another hulk Green Day!
You can bet there will be upgrades. Lots of upgrades!

Itching to break through yesterday’s close..
silver continuing to break out on day 2. who is long the most expensive stock market in history?
Company insiders are selling stock during buyback programs and making additional profits when stock prices jump.google that. top brass is selling pypl above 100 for sure
"Gah, I don’t know what to do. Long term holder since eBay spinoff...about 10% of my non-IRA portfolio. I don’t like this P/E around 65. I can see hitting $100 then sitting back and trading sideways for some time...I’ve got all the excitement I need in SQ and POTN. Might just cash out PYPL and increase my T which is a steal at 37 with its nice dividend. Love that monthly chunk of change for more speculative plays like MJ, which I believe stages a comeback this year... Constructive thoughts welcome."
Hey Big have you ever been diagnosed as Obsessive Compulsive?
What sort of news/announcement do you all think will happen today at $PYPL Investors Day? International crypto? Venmo monetization?
"Next generation growing up with those companies UberPaypalTikTok (FB)Snapchatas long as enough shares are in hands of households ""less"" worries"
PYPL higher than Visa.
Any good explanation on why Paypal is so undervalued relative to Square?
exited and made 20% gain. Thank you PyPl!!!
"PayPal acquired curv companyGreat news,prce can only go up more"
kevin the legend...huge but short....short and huge...!
Why do folks want to sell this So much?
Thinking about entering today.. not sure what to think about earnings
I have a feeling this week will be positive for PYPL
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. This is just the beginning. Enjoy the ride for years to come.
"Alright PayPal enough is enough, get up over $100 where you belong!!"
Bring back Janet Yellen.
Interesting to see what Dan will do with the free cash flow THIS time! Plus I love it when the analysts can seperate the 14 cent MercadoLibre from guidance. Like that is going to be a one-time only event. PLEASE!!!!
Earnings soon. how do say cha-ching bada bing...
"The $PYPL waters are nice and warm. Already through our 200DMA and ready to go up. When SQ go through? Oh yeah, around $60. Hard up, hard down."
"pretty foolish to short one of the stocks at the center of a paradigm shift. Whether it's EV, ecommerce or online payments, the world is digitalizing. It's proven paper money is one of the biggest contributors you spread disease like covid. There may be people out there who don't believe the effects of covid but the majority is willing to adapt to contactless means of payment. I live in a major city (Vancouver) and most people, if not all, opt in for contactless payments. This practice will be brought forward into a post-pandemic era. It comes pretty close to reinventing the wheel.$PYPL $V $MA"
Declare Tech sell off today. So I buy some good one. I like THE BAD ONE ADBE. PYPL two of the super chart.

PYPL is so solid. So happy I got in on this. Holding calls long.
$300 around the corner and $400 is not out of reach by years end. #crypto
"Operation ""PULL THE PLUG"" to be initiated any moment. Exchange FRN's for PHYSICAL silver on all dips."
Oh yeah......... I had forgotten about eBay..........
"According to conference call PayPal already has 18 million merchants on the platform. PayPal is now free to add Ebay competitors like Amazon and Walmart. Potential grow is now unrestricted, what's not to like. Potential growth is unlimited."
I had this stock when it was in 50’sGood stock for longsJust waiting for a pull back. Not chasing here.Gl
Microsoft and apple are down more in the premarket than paypal.I expect them all to be green by market close.
Let’s see at least $80 today. It’s been too long around this range when all the news has been good.
Buying shares at these levels for sure. Buying into weakness on this stock is a no brainer
"as the valuation of paypal and square stretch further and further, investors will eventually realize paypal is the better investment, let's fly paypal!!!"
Great buying opportunity. PayPal has a lot more growth left in it. Strong long term hold.
"TipRanks has this to say about PYPL: "" PayPal, which has become instantly recognizable and the market leader in online payment services. PayPal saw $17.77 billion in revenue last year, with a net income of $2.46 billion. High and growing revenue has attracted investment cash, and PayPal boasts a market cap of nearly $228 billion.Despite everything that has hit the markets this year, 2020 is turning out to be a great year for the company. Q1 revenue and EPS dipped, but not deeply, and both turned back upwards in Q2. The second quarter top line was $5.26 billion, with earnings of 76 cents per share, the highest in more than two years. Share prices are up, as well, with PYPL gaining an impressive 80% year-to-date.Generally rising volumes of online sales, and the concomitant need for digital payment services, provide a continuing boost for PayPal’s income and share position.Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane put a $234 price target on PYPL, suggesting a 20% one-year upside, and rates the stock a Buy.

Higher and higher we go.....
I think square will get hacked before PayPal ever will
"im really about to sell most of my portfolio and add it all to my paypal holdings, everything in my heart says we are just getting started on this paypal ride. This is to good of a company , i literally see no problems with paypal."
Train keeps a rolling all night long........
Happy thanksgiving and a happy leap to $100 soon
Keep selling so I can get in at $215 Appreciate your help in advance!
Expect this stock will be over 1000 bucks in ten years
"Paypal taking on debt at rates less than most peoples mortgage rates. You have to be a quality company to command such a low premium.Metrobank has bonds at 9% interest for example!Uber and merco will be profitable in the longer term but short term they still make paypal money being their payment provider.Forget the silver. No recession in the US, unemployment lower than forecast as per today's report.Too bad for Big and his papas retirement account though "
EXPLOSION!!!!
incremental fees on bitcon. smart move but not one for consumers
PayPal pull towards Nasdaq market is tend to make it high gain today
Doesn’t seem realistic that PayPal at the rate it’s market-cap is increasing will be worth more than Visa in a year. PayPal is way overvalued in my opinion or Visa way undervalued￼
PYPL's CFO coming on CNBC in moment
Shorts better buy now before 270!!!
PayPal though..... IS KING.
should I get in this stock or wait for a dip?
"SQ % return > PYPL ...every day (0.13% vs. .10%), week (5.14 vs. -0.59), month ( 6.75 vs 3.49), 3 mos. (39.07 vs 9.78 ), 6 mos. (65.44 vs 4.33 ), Year (167 vs 48 ) and two years (635% vs. 137% ). DEAL WITH IT !!"
"Still waiting on news concerning the PALCOIN (or whatever it is named) rumor that started a while back. I hope there is truth behind it, as it will take us to a whole new level."
PYPL is up 4.90% to 115.14
everyone and their mother loves this stock
Shorts will be killed again!
I wonder if PYPL could overtake V?
"As a longtime holder of the stock (try $31 a share) I understand the reaction to the news. I think many of us (myself included) were thinking this was the quarter that would start the next round UP into the high $90-110 range. Unfortunately this has been an embarrising quarter to report with revenue miss. Yes we have added a significant new amount of users but it does take some time for most of those users to become acclimated into using PayPal in increasing transactions. That will take some time for results to be felt. In addition, while there have been significant acqusitions the most important, iZettle continues to be reviewed by the EU for possible ""loss of competition"" rules. Therefore, without significant increase in revenue, without really knowing the total amount of shres repurchased, and without any jolt to the stock in terms of a special dividend (thus allowing possible inclusion into certain mutual funds) we shareholders are faced with the fact that PayPal is a stock that will continue to plod along with its share price until we can see a SIGNIFICANT new growth in both users and revenues. I have predicted a stock price of $110-$114 by the anniversary of the IPO for this year but I am now concerned that we will not achieve that level this year. However, all is not lost. We will continue to see slow incremental increases in the stock price over this year just not the home run many of us where hoping and expecting."
paypal still has ways to go. They just recently broke into the Chinese and Latin america market which should add substantial upside in revenue and earnings. The forward PE is way to low on a stock with this much market potential still. Its going to be the JP Morgan of electronic payments
$215 to $191 since the fake crypto news
"Will be green late today or by Friday, Friday is setting up for a rally as the Fed will announce the growth numbers tomorrow and the suspicion is that it may bump 5% which will drive the liberals nuts but so be it."
what time is the ER?
I see extreme pessimissm out there dont u guys?Stocks down 20-50% in days out there
"When Paypal puts iZettle to the metal the sky's the limit....it will leave SQ wondering "" wah happened? ""...lolBravo Dan! Encore, encore!!"
Wheres kevin btw?
Bought more at 284.00
"They are profitable so it will be accretive to earnings. On a strategic level , I have confidence in Schulman, he is a smart dude and has done a great job. A bill just aint what it used to be, lol"
Did yall heard of the news - PYPL will increase Venmo fees. Does this going to look good for PayPal ?? Any input on this matter?
THE MOON ISNT FAR OUT OF REACH!!!!!! HOLD
Omg Amazons going to take out PayPal yah right and Walmart taking out Amazon all hype funny stuff
Raised guidance
"I imagine that we will see a lot of profit taking this week, so be prepared. 230 by 12/30/20"
When comparing SQ and PYPL..traders think PYPL is a better investment!
I’ll say it again. Short back down to 80. This is still an amazing long term play. Earnings will disappoint.
"just doubled position premarket, give away price or play the bounce either way no brainer."

major market crashes occur every 10 years. last crash was 2008. oh dear.
worst company ever slow payouts huge discrepancies bad management confusing Ebay transactions. I encourage everyone to not use this company.
Pypl is the future of money after this pandemic
$90 tomorrow
Anybody that has an Ebay account and a Paypal account is still going to use Paypal! I don't see any issue there.
$150 billion in Total payment volume this quarter setting a record for the company. Venmo on track to have a TPV of over $100 billion by the end of 2019.
Analyst conservatively raised price targets. Digital banking in multi-currencies and a rapidly growing customer base bodes well for investors. This is not a Robin-hood stock and one I would avoid shorting.
I bought thinking earnings was today.
Expecting 200 or higher by years end very profitable and expanding
"Once more a case of market maker manipulation ahead of earnings. Of course they want panic this is the way American Banks make their trading money. Nothing changed to warranty a 4% sell off, no news no changes. It is the same stock it was last week and a month ago. It is expanding and it is not effected by Trumps draconian tariffs. So the only thing that changed is selling pressure is mounting."
just got back in at $180.00
"Nice little rally before earnings, see you guys at 300"
"A large portion of the stimulus payments will be direct deposited into people paypal accounts and spent using paypal, or to buy cryto."
My only regret is not having bought more.
I would be patient With PayPal. This stock has so much potential energy being built up. If this stock shot up like square I’d be worried. Stocks that go parabolic have a huge tendency to take hard pullbacks and sell offs especially when they are pushing the envelope on valuation.
Back again!
My experience told me that the option buyers start to bid the price close to the offer. PYPL WILL GO EVEN HIGHER TOMORROW.
what's with the heavy call options trade expiring in 16 days? expecting some announcement?
"With almost 20 agencies upgrading the stock, PYPL is heading to $220 within a month"
I don’t understand how this stock is going down...
"PayPal reaching all time highs. We've seen this movie before. And it's just as good, every time"
"Big says sell @105. Oh, wait.....nevermind."
If you are using a Level II streamer just keep an eye on the GSCO exchange . It will tell you where a stock is headed.
venmo/pypl provides zero rewards and zero credit building. visa: the better method. the whales are distributing but a great cost insofar as keeping the price up for retail / mom traders.
"Hate to say it BUT no one is ever buying PayPuke up here ever again after seeing it drop $20+ on no news in one minute wiping out $20b plus of shareholder wealth. Just wait until real bad news comes, this will drop $200"
Where this big bounce to 250 you delusional wannabes kept cheerleading about!? LOL
$300 end of week
Day to buy more!!!
"incredible. totally got complacent on PYPL look at them now. since dip, about to break out. can't get em all"
long time investment
Well....didn't take long for it to bust back below the 200 day. Hopefully it's just testing the 50 day. No reason for this stock to go lower than the 50 day unless it's on one of those market wide selloffs
Cypto is killing it.... Paypal has their fingers in the honeypot!
Is 90 realistic
I bought September 360 calls last week after buying June 300 calls in December. Thanks longs!
PayPal is a monster!
"I hate to be back so soon, but I said I would when $teum explodes with an annoying “I told you so.” Well, that day may be tmrw! It’s primed to take off!!

SQ does not and will not compete directly with these two stalwarts. That's how their business is structured. SQ has to obey rules set by these Payment Networks. Period. Secondly, their 10k clearly states Visa was and is an early investor in SQ. 10% Preferred stock owner. Go figure. $Bullish $SQ $PYPL $V $MA $BABA"
PYPL is buying its stock back to make eps look better.
"My target is $300.If $320, I will be very happy."
Congrats to the longs in here. Was in 193-225 and should have stayed on. I’ll be back when I have some $$ and PYPl is going into my retirement account and I’ll be there when this hits $1000 someday...
wow could not resist bought a little at 182
"This is one of the best performing stocks in my portfolio, and I only got it because I owned EBAY when it spinned it off. Talk about getting lucky."
Maybe smash that 200 today !
"PayPal finally getting past the eBay hit. Now they can now get back on the growth path and hit $100 , hopefully by November."
Was that ebays attempt to give the middle finger to paypal? Not cool bro! Paypal said ebay money was just nuts. There's bigger cows to milk! Let's go paypal!
Yes finally PayPal doing something
Big crash coming. Hedge funds wanted this at 180 range over valued
I don't see how a little bit of interest affect Pay Pal. The job market is getting. More spending
PYPL looks like it is ready to run toward new highs to finish the year. great support at these levels. gl!
"As Zelle screws over its customers on fraud protection, PayPal continues to build its reputation as a safe, secure, and reliable payment method."
Puts gonna PRINT!!
We need bigger gains. All my other stocks in this sector are kicking butt. I have done very well with PYPL but it needs to start climbing.
"Here comes inflation and taxes, what could go wrong?"
$200 tomorrow
$200 to $300 someday 
Time for PayPal to reveal regular growth now
Big short squeeze today. Long and strong PYPL.
Let's call Mad Money's JIm Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PYPL. 1 800 743 2622
"Key points for investors:1. eBay only represents a small portion of PayPal's current business.2. Now with 5-year exclusive over, PayPal can go after several other big retailers.3. And most important point...a given consumer typically sets up one bank for their online bill pay with al their merchant and credit information, and same for when hey set up PayPal for online purchases. Consumers will not switch that easily to other platforms. I am set up on PayPal for online purchases, and will continue to use it. 4. If eBay excludes use of PayPal along side of other new pay processors, it will dramatically kill their traffic. While if they do, minimal risk for PayPal."
"Don’t forget about little Venmo! 6 months ago very few people I knew used it...now I don’t know anyone who doesn’t! College kids, parents, friends, coworkers...everyone!! It’s a great part of the Paypal company!! Looking forward to earnings report!"
I am very happy this stock is going up - large position long term .. but does anyone know why this is going up? Is there news? I am looking myself right now.
See y'all at $300
PayPal is up 4.91% to 211.88
"Had no idea why PYPL is falling in corellation to bitcoin, when they don't invest in it but just get a comission which can be even higher if bitcoin falls due to the increased demand. Oversold imo."
Wal Mart and other retailers foregoing Black Friday sales ...... More money flowing into online sales = PAYPAL hits $220 before Christmas!!!
"WHO, WHO Sold me the 176 shares thanks."
"SQ is the future, PYPL is the past. Just saying..."
There is always a told you so on every board. Hehhe
No way this stock will fail. To reiterate its a buy around the 95-96 range as it is unlikely to go any lower than that.Double bottom pattern is forming.Now silver on the other hand.... That outlooks not so great.
I will be happy with 150 by Friday
Time to make our assault on $70. Onwards and Upwards. 
On a serious note... PayPal primed for $80 very very very soon!
"IPNFF Popped 20%, you know I know about my AR stocks, big potential here"

"Well, so much for yesterday's very short lived 5% cryptocurrency pop which was completely wiped out today."
Sorry 350$+Correction from previous post
"Stimulus check comming up soon and more people spending used cash app once again...a definite boost for PYPL....and as holidays comming around the corner by year end, millions of consumers spending give PYPL a big boost as well on cash app ...."
"I see people on here bashing Square in order to promote PayPal. I’m a fan of PayPal too I’ve gotten rich off it but I’ve made close to 400 percent off Square since the pandemic floor in March. You shouldn’t pick and choose between the two, you should own both. They can coexist together and both are thriving. I’m richer for owning both of them. Both are giants with very little competition and both are changing the way business is done. Don’t be the guy who treats them like Coke and Pepsi, both of which I own too. Two good stocks are better than one. The competition between PYPL and SQ is good for both companies. So own both. Otherwise you are robbing yourself. Long PYPL and SQ now and forever."
"I knew PYPL was good stock, but also know that you can't put everything into 1 stock.Great stock. I regret not putting in more but don't regret not putting in less : )2-4 years 200 billion market cap. Just like Visa, MasterCard and others. They will keep going up as long as people are spending and economy is good."
if paypal has a great earnings from venmo profits and other ventures. we could see a small tech rebound. we need strong earnings from techs to move this market back higher
Taken a breather call me when she wakes up gotta catch the ride back up north.
Big recovery tomorrow!!!
A growing stock and bright future!!! Jump in now to take advantage of it!!!
should we sell this pop?
This is a gift of epic proportions.....buy
Nice day for PYPL today.
good news soon
"Yawn 8% nothing if you are a PYPL LONG. This will go back in 80s this month, back in 85-90s next month. By April or May Say hi to 90s+100's by summer. End of Year 125 around Nothing to worry about LONGS."
Its going to be great guys..it should bust through $200. PYPL was probably making $$$$ during the pandemic and could have reaped tons of benefits with PPPs
50% of total volume in last 2 minutes. bank only buying. retail not interested. warren is certainly not interested.

"PayPal price target raised to $375 from $350 at MizuhoMizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $375 from $350 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the company's Q4 results. The future of PayPal as a ""super app"" was on display in Q4 as app login doubled for bitcoin traders, with QR and BNPL ""driving halo effects"" in terms of incremental total payment volume, Dolev tells investors in a research note."
Looks like round one is done?
"Wait until BABA is able to get its hands into American markets and stores....By the time this happens, PYPL will be out of agreement in 2020. Who do you think BABA will team with? PYPL is most likely 1st choice and best choice."
"Policies change. Markets react. Businesses just keep running. So when it is red, don't forget to buy, if you can."
can someone summarize earning results?
can anyone explain why this has not participated in the rally since earnings...great co but I'm wondering if as a stock not so great.what has me as neutral is that it doesn't look like it once to go to even 110 from here. having said that 135 sounds right 12 mis out. with almost all of it coming after first qtr next years have doubts we see 110 by years end stock misacting poorly in the last cal of big rally since earnings
"Paypal is focusing on partnerships. They lost Ebay so something is going to take it's place. Whether that news comes next week or next month, the stock will jump back up when that happens. Hold it long and you'll make your money back and more."
"everyone who sold already once knows this feeling: having sold and seeing the chart going up makes you want paypal again as you know that it is a great company to own as all subsidiaries have huge potential in the future. With tradera in Sweden or wherever they could simply bring the same concept to Europe or America and would push out ebay, old platform and a lot of problems with products ordered"
buy at the open?
Good God Y'all!!....... Let me do that thang!!..........
when will we hit $120?
$SQ and $Pypl ya better watch out in few years
Every stock will rise if Trump wins. Prepare for the market to sink and stay flat if Biden wins.
If you don't like this stock you must be a grandparent. If it isn't green by the end of the day I'd be surprised.
The bank of the future!
TRUST WHY YOU GOT INTO THIS STOCK IN THE FIRST PLACE. BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR EARNINGS.
"There was never a dam doubt. Komol is a donkey. Stop analyzing and look at the damn fundamentals and the company's growth. U heard it here annoyingly first and often, explosion coming. And this won't be the last. Hold this pos. It's going even higher. Please stay tune"
expensive and no dividend?
"PYPL will come back more or less today, because tech sector starts to recover from hang over this morning. Hint: if WMT is up tomorrow morning, the whole market will come back, but if WMT slides down tomorrow, WE WILL HAVE CORRECTION."
"VENMO beats SQ because of the BRAND. SQ has subprime loan which I think it will haunt SQ later. I think it will be PYPL year when it is free from EBAY. EBAY is a dead fish in the water, and nobody wants to buy it."
"Stellar earnings, growth,... And they raise their guidance... What more do you people need??Anyways, market will eventually respect the fundamentals... Though those of us with expiring options might be less sanguine about it.."
Bargain and the move to a different currency is all speculation and years down the line - wouldn't doubt seeing PayPal close to 400$ by end of next year
"What a wonderful world. PYPL sells receivable, free up the reserve. It is really good move. It surprises me when it raises earnings over 30%. How about P-P in India which just starts. OMG"
Not 1 year ago. There was a race for $100 with #SQ !SQ and #PYPL !PYPL SQ now $66 and PYPL is $109.BUT overall SQ is up compared to PYPL. Safer stock - PYPL Both good stocks IMO. IF SQ drops back to $60 Ill be buying more shares.
It’s all fun and games until you’re 60 raising a 3 year old.
"Here we go again, wow week like this, they really want the robinhooders to get out"
"This stock needs to escape $215 level, which it has tested multiple times starting in August. When it finally breaks out above $220, it will be a smooth ride to $300."
I'll gladly be wrong on my predictions this time!!! GO PAYPAL GO!
Pypl tends to open hot. Lets see what it does mid-day.
Charge!
Let's put some distance between us and SQ!
150 soon
I'm a long term holder for 2 years and I sold everything over the last few weeks. great company but no innovation and too much competition.
We might hit $90 Monday due to success of G20
"I am surprised that nobody buy Nov 24 call 75 the premium is just 15 cents. I bought another 50 calls. It is no brain stock and i don't need to figure it out that when I buy it, I make money right away."
It's a miss on volume. Slowing down?
Great news with google. Shows how google knows how good PayPal is.
"I love this stock! Its promising and safe to keep in your portfolio. This is still undervalued. Once the revenue increase, valuation would be more than Visa!"
"SQ quarter report come out today, right? I wonder how that will effect us..."
This move into India is huge. India gets overlooked being in the shadow of China but a billion plus population of whom very few have credit cards and very amicable to using PYPL. The PYPL story just keeps getting better

Load up when it is still low. Read the news and make up your own deductions."
Is there a sector Amazon is not considering?......... What a load......
"PayPal assumed coverage at Buy with $280 price target at JefferiesJefferies analyst Trevor Williams assumed coverage of PayPal with a Buy rating and $280 price target. While he acknowledges that the stock faces a more difficult set-up after a 100%+ gain in 2020, he thinks the company's position as an e-commerce pure-play with a unique two-sided network support the long-term outlook, Williams tells investors."
"INDIA is an instant success for PYPL. It is no brainer to move in and umbrella the whole INDIA, which they already know PYPL.The result in INDIA will pop up in Jan earnings report. I need to emphasize VENMO which most of the millennials love it. PYPL needs to put more energy in it, because it will help the top line and bottom line for the next few years. I am talking about the future not in short term. PYPL has to spend more time and money in VENMO. IT MAY COME IN FORM OF CREDIT CARD ONE DAY IN THE FUTURE, WHO KNOWS."
the fact that square is about to hit 100 and this isnt even there yet tells you alot.
If u think all PayPal is is a payment platform clearly you forgot or don’t want to remind people of their izettle acquisition. That alone is a massive platform for global usage.
thinking of loading some shares before the end of the day. ER will be good.
"quality stocks win, like this, no pump n dump, no mad volatility."
Anyone knows about their buyback program?
CNBC’s Jon Najarian today: Aggressive buying of $105 PYPL Nov 29th calls
Anyone concerned about Q4 earnings yet? Expectations are high. Wonder why they were beefed up so much?
All the way up fam
A super powerful beast !!
There we go. Come home to papa. Will be $120 before we know it.
"PYPL, is a Great long term stock; about $450 as perDalton Whitney."
. What kind of drop are we expecting here? I really like the growth potential here and dividends.
Call is at 5pm eastern...assume the results will get posted sometime between now and then. GL longs.
"A consistent theme at the investor day is PayPal's focus on becoming a platform. They just made an announcement to become the Rewards platform for major banks. This will provide liquidity to the bank customers who can use their reward points earned at individual banks across any of the millions of PayPal vendors. The partnership is now available at Citi, Discover and Chase. Barclays will also come on board next."
Flipping idiot Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. He must be a shorty coming out with this BS Fake News!PayPal is in it's infancy. Going much higher after earnings and a high possibility VISA will buy them out.Go Long!
Looking solid guys !!
PYPL enters into Chinese market. It will have a bright future!!!
did ya buy silver on the big dip?
I'm thinking there will be a big announcement. Why would they take out a big loan when they already have cash on hand?
Beat consensus. Should see a 20% drop since earnings were so good
Believe
PayPal reached an all time high at 218.26
Show me a little green.........
PYPL will destroy earnings and up grade all future estimates
People like komol are a prisoner to the moment. Do yourself a dam favor and hold this beast. It's going nowhere but up for the months to come. This is just the beginning gang. Stay tune for more gains.
Fantastic volume and only at 12:15 pm....$95.00 at closing!!! Go PYPL.!
Kev for prez of kazakstan
Its going parabolic today
Just reached 100 billion market cap again.
I'm still buying pypl on under $55.00 price. Stock is still growing earnings. This stock will grow big time for the next 4 to 5 years
"85 is the goal for next week, PYPL needs to reach 85 in order to hit 90 on Thursday morning, Feb 2."
"$100 a coming soon, consolidation period almost complete and ready for next leg up."
"How much exposure does PYPL have to Bitcoin. It is vunerable to Cyberwars and no one even knows who invented it. It could the USSR, CCP or North Korea waiting to cash in on western cash. It is a huge venerability. How do the preppers cash in the bitcoin during an apocalypse?"
People are gonna use PayPal till the world ends lol. They still expect over 20% growth into 2021
"Mission Control, Ready to launch! Engines to $200 https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-venmo-roll-crypto-buying-165945361.html"
Square has been moving up nicely wonder why we can’t get the same from PYPL. We been in the Doghouse for a while on this one.
"This stock will never fall under $200 from today on. Insane market value, insane earnings...."
Amazon tells users to uninstall a product that PayPal just paid $4 billion for:https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/amazon-says-uninstall-honey-which-paypal-just-paid-4-million-for.html
Honest thoughts on buying now?
but up 20 today so making money today in after hours!! that's the way the market works!!
"If you hold PYPL, don't sell now or next month. We're heading for a temporary crash cycle and will be back up again in April."
Friday is always a tough day....I see Pypl bottoming around 230-240 range...hate to say but on a down turn i see that coming....We have not got buyers come in yet....May be Monday....hopefully....Nasdaq is due for a big rebound....a big one.
This dip is a gift.Start accumulating.
$182 tomorrow... written on the wall.
"Inmho, Street target price $128 ,other under priced stocks ,MA ,V, FB."
$100 in 12 months.
PayPal due for a 10% move a la Square. We have all been patient with this one.
"Buy orders stacking up, get ready for a big move up!"
"Buy more SQ shares, you will not regret it."
86.61 in pre. This is going to be a fun couple of weeks before earnings.
Strong buy!
"""Keep the price above 100 so I can sell/distribute shares into the buyback."" -pypl insider"
tiny up day volume. distribution continues.
130 tomorrow
This is how China buys America for pennies on the dollar.
The next time one of those analysis posts here remember that's you short term sell signal.It happens all the time.
I think its time to buy more PYPL

"Good luck into earnings, goal closer to $200!"
Great numbers PYPL! Congrats! That ultimately will carry the day. Watch for big upgrades. Job well done Danny boy!
This is a $100 stock. Buy it now or miss out.
"Risk on, go tech and financials has Fed will be breaking out new tools to squash interest rates. Parking myself fully in PYPL"
this bad boy needs to keep going got some calls on this
"Hey ""Schulman""... can you do something that INCREASES the PYPL stock price? - You are on a roll .... but the wrong way."
where are the PayPal haters from Square now?
The opportunity cost is rising here.......... Where are the buybacks?
"I have used paypal since 2004 religiously. I love it. I wont switch. Its like changing banks., nuts"
"Back up to above $300 soon this week....as BITCOINT continue rocket up...could be 100,000 soon next month..."
How come it missed the revenues and has withdrawn the guidance for 2020 and the stock is going up?I am puzzled
Slow and steady always wins the race. The ones that run too fast just crumble in the end !
Paypal to 195 by weeks end!
Hunter Bill Randy Anonymous Dennis Anthony. How about that $SQ printed 100 today while $PYPL is stuck below $90. Tried to tell ya folks
Come on PAYPAL be a Pal on go on up so I can. get paid!
Fidelity Investment shows that PYPL bought back 5.3 Million shares
"Paypal's Ceo is pumping the stock , he never mentioned losing Ebay . SEC should investigate him"
93% institutionally owned / pullbacks like this they are buyers
Post on PayPal only.......all others deleted. No more multi stock general bubble post. You are polluting all over the place. Go start a blog somewhere.......does not belong here.
Loading up this is a steal
Free money who can say no.
Sell here buy SQ lower and watch it blast past this slow coach.
DO NOT miss payment company IIIV. They project FY19 adj eps of .79-.81c whereas SQ projecys FY18 adj eps of .39-.41
"Great quarter, should go higher"
"PYPL ...YES, PLEASE! Great end to the week!! "
This is a knee-jerk reaction. 100B mktcap and great balance sheet.
panic selling by people who do not know stockmarket
Payment stocks are up except for PYPL. WTH
"We beat the all time high!! Don't just stop there, keep going!!"
Nice push today!
"The largest Insider Buys this week were for PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), ConocoPhillips Co. (COP), Coty Inc. (COTY), and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL)."
"each and every salary is a dream, BUYING BACK my friends"
"I don't think I will have chance to buy PYPL so early. I want to wait until end of Dec, but today I can't resist to buy it because it is too cheap to ignore. The big picture is we still have strong economy, smart money goes after the cheap PE stocks which have dividends, banks, healthcare, insurance. I believe in tech sector which I think it is still in prime time. Take your pick, you will not have a chance to buy stocks like FB and PYPL this cheap again in 2018."
when all these paid guys come into these chats bashing stocks. YOU BUY.
it's TIME!! GO GO GO GO GO GOsomeone push this thing!
This is classic overreaction. The switch will start in the North American Mkt in 2nd half of 2018 and will be a multi year transition. PaypalWill be offered as a payment option as well. People will be using paypal for the most part still. It is no fee to buyers. People will stick with what they know. I will bet that paypal will lower their fees once competition presents itself to maintain market share
$309 - $260 = -$50 which is almost down 20% in a week Nice stock lol 
thinking about shorting this at 3:59 this friday.
Solid financials & a safe bet with massive upside. Stay long!
"Breaking: Barclays raises PYPL price target to $199 (from $169) maintains OverweightBarclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $199 from $169 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The payments environment has evolved in PayPal's direction, such that the company is less constrained by having to fit into the existing value chain, El-Assal tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes COVID-19 is accelerating existing point of sale trends that were already supportive and that PayPal rightly sees the current environment as a one-time opportunity."
a good time to be adding more shares. keep nibbling. S&P will find support around 2800 so be patient and add to great companies like this one
don't understand all the crying. the stock is a 3-5 yr play with upside of 50% in the next 18 mos. If you wanna gamble go to Vega$.
"I love Paypal and hold stocks, still looks like a correction"
300! Stay long folks!
90 ozs of silver to 1 oz gold. silver is now free. load.
Those who short.... I am all for being reasonable but you might want to reconsider your short position. Pypl has been profitable and growing every single ER for last 2 + yearsPypl has been flat last 9 months. You have guts to gamble vs this. Pypl reasonable should be around $100 to even $110 atm. I only see this falling if market correction or recession
Sheesh i missed this one good work folks
New 52 week highs! $90 can’t come any sooner.
"PayPal closed green in Europe, let's go USA, don't let us down, I am buying as mich as I can, will hold forever"
"PayPal not good at integration with companies they buy..... Not sure why, but any company they buy will be a large challenge for them to get every penny predicted.... This amount should be the top until they prove otherwise....."
Shorts gonna get smashed again tomorrow
Update: it just overtakes a Wall St icon in size - DISNEY. Would would have foreseen it when it went public 5 years ago.
The dip is profit taking. Hold.
Anyone's guess if it will continue to drop after open to maximize picking up more?

"BIG MOJO comes to PYPL. It is the perfect moment to move this week. PYPL will have another 7 more days to see what direction the hedge funds will go. As far as I see, they start to back up the truck to load PYPL., the volume tells the whole story. 87 is absolutely possible. Now I raise my case to 90 by next Friday."
Very impressive on a brutal day. This baby is heading higher in the coming weeks
Told you all 3 months ago after the eBay announcement SQ is open for business. Since then SQ up ~30% PYPL ~.99%. Good work folks

This reminds me of Visa yesterday.
She will hit 100 in next month!!!! Got in at 82 during dip 3 weeks ago!!! Couldn't be happier she is getting the recognition she deserves
It is down right now because of stimulus but it will have tremendous gains before it ER. MARK MY WORDS
$10 a share rise will make me even! I’ll settle for that and hold!
It’s happening. Used to be slow but now it’s getting up to the speed. Way to go!
"For those of you complaining... do you NOT remember what happened last week..... You ALREADY forgot?? PYPL was up like 3-5% while SQ and others were down... You can't expect a stock to go up NONSTOP. Stop the complaining, in the long run, you make money."
"I own V, PYPL and SQ. Three phenomenal companies. Just my opinion, but if V or PYPL ever thought about buying SQ, now might be the time to do it. But I'm thrilled if all the companies remain independent. Good luck to all longs!"
The end of PayPuke was the day it fell $302 to $280 in one second rebounded to $309 and hasn’t had an uptick since
Bought more at 72.10 hoping that is the bottom..... I have faith we will see the 80's again....
"PYPL can partner with both Walmart and Amazon and Ebay can continue to loose money like it did this quarter. This is no reason to sell, market manipulation seems to be at play here."
PU83jw....you just worry about your own shares Square Head; SQ about to follow Facebook... they are down 20% down Afterhours dingbat! LIVE WITH IT !
just load up every dip...this will be the Bank of the future!
"I added 540 shares today long term, wish me luck guys..."
I guess its PYPL turn to go red.Still don't understand why SQ is higher than PYPL.
RGSE check it out
"Over $47 million out today, shorts keep getting killed! GOOD!And SQ keep climbing, time to get on board."
strong buy
uber going into 20's and stil waaaaaaay overvalued. PYPL distribution picking up steam.
Anyone else losing patience with this stock?
Less than $10 from $100. We are so close I can taste it!
Stock coming back. Long story short it was a great ER and always that will carry the day. Now go cut a deal with Amazon Schulman and the stock will double.
pypl will be back to 110 soon after earnings report
300 is here!!!!! Congrats PYPL longs we are drowning in cash. 400 will be next then 500.

No reason to sell in this market !
short at open
"PayPal's a decent company so the stock price will probably go back up, but for the long run I'd rather own MasterCard or Visa"
"It did this back in Nov Dec, just bounced up and down before taking off. Hope for repeat."
solid finish today fam! should be over 80 by next week if not sooner
$80 is not far off... right around the corner :)
Beat + raised guidance = stock down... weird
exceedingly few shorts in PYPL. can't depend on em to buy these ultra rich valuations.
Looks like the fire sale is over.
Big on suicide watch. Prolly lost all his life savings

Seems to be resistance around $80. Wait for a breakout after that. That’s exactly what happened last time it broke $80.
Why is it going down?
Square and PayPal may be new whales in crypto as clients flock to buy bitcoin https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/square-and-paypal-emerge-as-whales-in-the-crypto-market-.html?__source=androidappshare
"This is why you tune out all the noise, mute anyone posting negative kr.app and just hold unto the stock. That is how you make real money. Been in PayPal since after the IPO and just held and added. We have a long long way to go with this one. Just getting started. As soon as a viable plan is announced to monetize Venmo you will see another huge pop. Enjoy fellow Longs!"
Too quick too far ?
Owned PYPL since it was spun off from EBAY. Several years later no plans to sell.
"Read the ER and it was fine. Massive top line beat, massive. Guidance was a tiny bit less than anticipated and they are trying to whack the stock. We will be back quickly. Another tempest in a teacup. Scones anyone? "
Loving it!!! What a huge beat. Thank you!!!
Choo - Choo ... here comes $85 !!!!
JUST BUY IT! IT IS NO BRAINER STOCK.
"glad I bought more yesterday, if price goes down, would still hold it forever"
Happy $200  GLTA
"PYPL ceo just sold 30,000 shares at 112. hmmmm."
BUY BUY BUY!
Opens for pypl are being goosed up only to find BIG BIG sellers exploit the higher prices. PYPL distribution continues.
"Borrowed this from another stock board. Can not agree more. Great case for $PYPL as a strong buy all that much more. PYPL is both a value and massive growth play.In Sept, 2012 amazon had a P/E of 3600. It lost money the next 3 quarters. In Sept, 2013 it had a P/E of 1100. By June 2014 it was 850. Then another 4 quarters of losses. By March 2016 it’s P/E was under 500. If you invested in amazon during this period and held to today, your returns are 5X in about 6 years. You don’t use P/E ratio dictate your investment decisions for growth companies folks."
We are actually in the green?!?!
buy buy.
PYPL bought a large number of UBER shares too. NOT good stockpickers that PYPL.
what a bargain - I remember cnbc touting this what at 300?
ENVV and GLNNF entering blockchain.
"worked in the gastronomy for 3 years the I was young, so many people asked me whether they could pay via PayPal #venmo #peoplewantitandgetit"
we are good. move forward!
Anything above a $70 close is gravy. It will take PYPL less time to get from $70-80 then it took to get from $60-70. IMHO
"Glad I got on board early ... and I plan on staying there. Expect to see $100 per by year's end, anything less will be disappointing."
"Hey everyone, I've been here for a while since 170, with only one share (because I'm only 15  ), but I see the potential here and am gonna continue holding for a few years. 300 is coming in the coming months, vaccine or not. Stick around!"
ill start biting once and if it hits the 90s
"Unfortunately 10 year bond yields are creeping up again, could be a sign of another 10-20% sell off. I'm not a short however something to think about..."
"so the fed is gonna hyperinflate and stocks will double from here regardless of fundamentals, right?"
ATH. Congratulations to all longs.
"PYPL is screaming today, after two big blocks at 9:30 and the Hedge fund article. Buy- Bullish"
low volume gap and trap. cratering economy = buy stocks!
PayPal was featured on CNBC's Trading Nation as being undervalued in comparison to analyst opinions. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/27/halliburton-paypal-could-catch-up-to-their-high-average-price-targets.html
No matter how much we wanted PYPL to gain tremendously today it won’t happen. Sold 2 hours ago at $144 and reinvested in UBER and have gained 2.5% since. Know when to hold them and when to fold them and reinvest elsewhere.
"stifel upgraded paypal from hold to buy, raised price target to $99"
Undervalued 
Who thinks we go green today into strong ER?
pypl is hyperinflated priced to perfection. silver ramping to 20 end of year.
"Upgraded: PayPal is now ""the world's most popular alternative payment option, which leads to further user/merchant adoption"""
"This morning’s wisdom. Take it with however many grains of salt you wish. This is a classic macro head fake or good old shake out. Ok, sell. And buy what.Are you kidding me. How many times and how many ways did Chairman Powell have to say the same thing. Mark this moment. This pre market is a gift. If it doesn’t pay off today or tomorrow who cares? Look back in a month.I added this morning and will add more if need be, and have added also to some other stocks on my shopping list. Have a great day all!"
PYPL earnings are expected to grow by 10% in 2020. So why is it a good investment when it trades for more than 30x 2019 earnings.
Congrats Longs!!

Anywhere under $215 for PayPal is a great buy right now! I just picked some up. Good luck all!
huge days tomorrow and friday. Waiting to unload 3500 shares by friday here.
For those who think this “eBay news” is relevant are probably new to PayPal. This was priced in back in 2017 when their separation was initiated. The revenue PayPal collected from eBay was once significant. It’s now dwarfed considerable by all of the revenue streams it’s added over the years. Not to mention PayPal was seeing YoY decrease in revenue generated by eBay. Bottom line: EBay news means nothing now. This was priced in years ago.
up to 93
"I’m down over 16 per cent on mine over the period of around six weeks ! Any advice from you guys On the other side of the pond I’m a uk investor, I’m thinking hold and sit it out ... only lose when you sell ..."
"I feel like SQ earnings will pay a roll in this stocks movement as well. SQ moved because of paypals earnings, maybe the same will happen here. Just a thought"
just read that paypal is expecting lower growth next quarter...from 41 percent to 20-25 percent. that's why it's selling off
New high today. Sweet.....
Option contracts were a steal of a deal today in advance of earnings!
Pypl upgrades daily square on the other hand square ...up daily...should invest in both!!
coming to america go mogo
I loaded heavy AH last night saw a lot of big orders come in. So far so good!
PayPal should buy Coinbase immediately!
"Need some follow through on Tuesday to hold us over the previous 100.63 top. If we can create this as the new base, next resistance is the 110 range."
"I posted four times already since I got back in PYPL at $84I first got in at $70. I made HUGE mistake of selling in December when all stocks dropped 5-10%. I got back in and dropped again. THIS TIME I am staying long.PYPL easy money. Stay long you WILL be happy. Next small drop, I will be doubling down."
120 soon!
"PayPal price target raised to $290 from $270 at MizuhoMizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $290 from $270 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Mizuho's PayPal bitcoin user survey shows that nearly one-fifth of PayPal users have already traded bitcoin on the PayPal app and that 65% would use it as currency at PayPal's 28M merchants, Dolev tells investors in a research note. Rising engagement can drive a ""meaningful lift"" to revenue"
Was looking for a pullback to get long anyways; I’ll take it!
PayPal isn't even a payment option on amazon!
PayPal is so much better than square
Why the sell off?
Frannie must have sold! Hehe
"PayPal Announces Appointment of Chief Marketing Officer, Allison Johnson!"
"The entire payment sector is down. SQ, V, MA. It's not just PYPL"
"Congratulations  longs: You somehow managed to be long the only stock out of 10,000 down today"
"EPS was $1.08, compared to $1.00 estimates. Good beat, but the market will want more than a 10% beat unfortunately."
"Sometime ago we were discussing which team would reach $100 first - $PYPL or $SQ. I have both stock (SQ is the largest position in my portfolio), but I’m glad that PayPal is way ahead - it’s a very solid company and I see more and more online shops that use PYPL for payment. I hope, SQ will follow the example "
Bpught some more today Price Target $125
PYPL is headed to $120.
How do y’all feel about this long term?
Anybody buying PayPal tomorrow or Monday? PLPY
waiting for a dip isn't going well
"Paypal is floating at very attractive prices, don't miss, BUY!"
“the stock is forming a triangle pattern with support around $73. Relative strength shows a favorable divergence as PayPal bounced off support. The upside could be beyond $80 if the stock bounces off $73 support in the next few days.” -Forbes
eBay is not so popular anymore
ATH! again. almost $150
"Nobody wants Amazon Pay, it will create a Database for them to steal sales.Amazon pay will never work a competitor cannot be your processor."
Did I hear that FaceBook is interested in PayPal? I think I’m I a buyer come Monday
Shopping list tomorrow
Is there something going on at PYPL that the CEO is telling us shareholders. Contact him
Hopefully it will a good day tomorrow. Management provided a disappointing forecast for 1st Q 2018
Better hope 108.26 holds today...rsi way down buyers not feeling too bullish at these prices....
buffet buying. get in now for the hype bump.
You longs sell $183.50?????
Just jumping in here. So what's the buzz with PayPal? Haven't bought in yet though
"Positive progress PayPal has made recently:1. China online payment license2. Split payment cooperation with American Express3. Credit Card issuance of VenmoThe potential of the PayPal expansion is still not fully released, but the market does not appreciate its outlook. Waiting for a stronger catalyst to change the market sentiment to PayPal."
"IMPEACHMENT IS ONLY GOING TO FUEL PROTESTS. LET THE PRESIDENT GO IN PEACE, TO MAINTAIN PEACE.DEMS CONTINUE TO SHOW TRUE HATE TOWARDS REPUBLICANS.#$%$ ON PELOSI."
"Institutions are waiting and grabbing the sell off done by young chaps. Yesterday, Josh Brown said he will not sold his position no matter whatever high it goes. In case if there is a profit taking, he said, he will only load up more. So this is a blessing to them. Young chaps are gifting shares to institutions!"
"Just bought another hefty block of PYPL earlier this morning. Fundamentals are excellent, the company well run and the recent pull back a great buying opportunity. Looking forward to a long and profitable relationship with PYPL.GLTA"
"Honey deal to me is a possibility for PayPal to upend Amazon's dominant position in e-commerce. Amazon extend its offer from online shopping go-to site to AmazonPay, and PayPal with Honey has the potential to extend reversely from payment to online shopping's go to app on your phone. The market does not understand this yet I thinks."
PayPal will do just fine without EBay. Kinda sad they had to ruin the great company performance by announcing the news the same day earnings came out. eBay is junk for that.
go ahead..buy the dip...do ya feel lucky?
"too much hype, you have too many competitors in the market now , square, apple , google, amazon"
Hope to see 195 by weeks end. possibly 200
give u some stock to look at GRWG ALTO ARBKF nxttf
"Congrats on those who loaded more shares when it was down, looks like it’s pulling back and beyond."
Owning online ebay businesses in Oz meant no bank would touch us for a serious loan. 4 years in and PayPal offered us twice the value of our business for purchasing inventory. No questions asked. The money in our account within 60min. This is truly a great company. One that knows it’s customer better than anyone else. Long all the way

This is going downnnn after earnings are released
PayPal is the future. Cashless currency is the future. You’re in denial if you think otherwise. I’d even buy Visa.
PYPL will be 500 a share by next year. Book it.
this is why im in Paypal. long term all the way!

"$FINV consolidating nicely for the next run. Its PE ratio for a Fintech is insanely undervalued... only 8.17x PE ratio. Comparing against other Chinese Fintech... $TIGR PE ratio is 437x, $FUTU is 182x.Comparing against US Fintech... $PYPL is 91x, most other fintech are losing money... so there isn’t even a PE ratio This is going to $20!"
Should I buy amc?
PayPUKE  still $309? Not near a quote machine
"Nearly HALF of All U.S. Workers Are LOW WAGE With $18,000 Salary! Best Economy Ever?"

Cowabunga dude!!!!
"The market gives you once in a life time to buy the great stock at bargain price. UNH drops 15 points, You can't find it any time now."
"had to buy more at 73.08, thanks for the dip"
Longs have taken a pounding on this all week. Should have loaded them puts and went short kids!
"73.18 in, hello pypl family I come in peace"
"So what? Nobody buys stuff on eBay anyway. Totally overreaction, i.e. an opportunity to load PYPL."
"Down $20 by the close on highest volume in years and positive news! The bubble has ended, short away!!!!"
Just Bought more. And a lot more. Gotta love the short term dip. The long term is where it's at. Enjoy all
What will this Walmart merger do?
15 more minutes to hold that $80 level. Yippee. Hold in there PayPal.
good run
Finally getting some life back.
NOT looking good
Numbers are fine - nothing to worry about. We will march on for a strong 2020
Impressive to be up on a bloodbath like today
Getting destroyed in AH. Added at $74.85!
This is one of the few times I wouldn't be scared dropping 10k on a stock.
Absolutely no reason to sell this name... growth runway is unreal
i am surprised PYPL is green today after so many bad news
''Ebay snubs Paypal again by partnering up with Square.'' Will just be a buying opportunity if it dips a little on this headline.
How can anybody be a Democrat and vote for biden.....and yet I see these people on here. Don't you know you're the enemy? Did you not listen to Elizabeth Warren?
Tracking with naz today 1:1. Not a lot you can do except hang on. The rotation out of tech right now just defies logic though. Once the momentum plays are over they'll be back though.

"Guys, do you think we have a chance to touch 129$ again?"
So we beat earnings and prices back to 2 weeks ago.... still losing $40k
Earnings at 5pm today!Up we go!!!!
"Ok, I know I said I'd buy in the mid $260s but I'm not gonna do it all at once in this market..."
PayPal thinking about buying Visa.. game on
Where is that Putin guy? He needs remove PYPL and add ADYN to his list
"Hopefully, PYPL hits new high this week. It is very good chance that PYPl just breaks through over 80 this week. I see 85 up when earnings report hits the wire, less that 2 weeks."
"Here we go, slot machine time!"
"HUGE buying opportunity. This stock will be back to $200 and over soon. 10x better than Square. Digital payments are the future and the future is now. Throw in some Covid, and it's accelerated for these kind of payments. Older generation will learn and as years go, it will be all digital and venmo etc."
big gain. hmmm
I can't believe I sold this position so early. I had 10 July 260 calls a couple months ago but now I only have 2 left.
Stock is in full breakout mode. About frigging time! Patience always is rewarded eh Frannie. :))
$206.00 here we go
"I love my PYPL stock & plan to hold on to it, but I really would like to hear anyone’s thoughts on this TSNP Soon to be HUMBL company. It appears to have a future in large parts of the world where our stock really doesn’t reach. I understand this HUMBL is just now being born, constructive thoughts please? Thanks"
"PayPal stayed strong through market turmoil, arguably one of the best stocks. It will only go higher as the rest of the market turns around. PayPal $110 target."
should be breaking out to 75 any minute now
"Bought at the initial offerings, loving every minute of it, another call today for $100 and beyond......"
PYPL should split the stock 3 for 1 and bring in new young buyers. They will also be new customers who will use PYPL services
"Can’t wait until Elon texts again to send the markets flying! Wow, are investors gullible."
bullish 900 pypl I can provide it longterm buyer
Ebay is planning to move away from PayPal monopoly at the end of this year. What would be the impact on PayPal stock?
open at 110 in the am.
Don't buy PYPL till close to new year.
"TPV miss. that's a death nail, same happened in Q2 and it took 6 months to recover. kinda mad I only sold half my position yesterday"
I really wish I found this guy sooner. My market knowledge has increased 10fold and the stock tips cant be beat. (http://webstock.today).
Go PYPL! About time we made our final assault on $100!
This is huge buying opportunity!!! It is a good quality stock!
Just in! Should Apple buy PayPal?
Legit !!!!!!
I wonder how many of you here use the PayPal check out button? I am big investor in PYPL but I never have to check out with PayPal
Great earnings tomorrow evening...into Thursday morning at the open.$95.00-$100.00.
Greeeat report1
pypl ceo dumping shares at 111 = pure genius.
Cha Ching going to 150
"holiday shopping season is coming, that should be paypal next big catalyst, $100 should be easy to come"
Remember folks it’s not about “timing” the market it’s about “time IN” the market. Don’t lose money trying to time the tops and bottoms.
Could be a heavily pulling back today after a wild run up since beginning of JANUARY.......
"PYPL will lose 90% of its value from current levels. Watch and learn ""investors""."
"Off the grid people are buying bitcoin, how do they sell it when you are off the grid? Seems you cant."
This is getting held back so options expire. Wait for monday
"All the analyst on CNBC for months have said, if you can get some PYPL under 100, buy it......well it's here....buy low......this is your chance....."
Appears the professional money now coming into the stock. Amateur hour is over.
An upgraded sound like an opposite..I am holding it and SQ!
PYPL rumored to crush earnings estimates. Analyst upgrade is a nice affirmation to stock solidity.May see 212 by EOW. GLTA!
"This market is terrible, cant hold gains at all."
PayPuke still $309+? Man is this a Ponzi
Do you get excited when someone offers to give you four $5 bills in exchange for one $20 bill  that’s all a stock split is 
"jim ""bears sterns"" cramer says buy pypl. oh dear."
PayPal reached an all time high at 264.80
Sold
pypl only goes up. load.
Just found I can cash the check with PayPal app.....wow.
About time for this to move up!
I’ve heard a lot of chatter lately from my friends on Wall St that Visa has plans on acquiring PayPal. Would this be good for PayPal shareholders? Thoughts.
"I couldn't believe I missed the PayPal play...it was so obvious...Until I studied the fundamentals, long-term strategy and growth perspectives...This firm has the potential to become among the largest if not the largest business entity in drastically volatile conditions with highly pronounced systemic risk. Ultra bulish!"
"Now that we've pretty much broken the $54 resistance, we will be head to $60 shortly."
"The Street - Bret Kenwell 11/2/20""For longer-term investors, that type of dip is likely one to buy - barring a horrendous development in the business. On the upside, bulls need to see PayPal reclaim the 50-day moving average and $200 level. Above $200 puts the $210 resistance level and all-time high in play at $215.83. Should PayPal continue sailing higher, the 361.8% extension (from the March low to the February high) is on the table near $235. ""Volatility. When the seas are rough, you don't abandon the ship... and that ship is far from sinking."
"Paypal is already surging before they start charging for trading crypto. Imagine what will happen with the stock price when they actually start charging fees for trading crypto, buying with crypto and enable users outside the US to trade crypto in 2021. Not to mention that online shopping has increased in Q4 while overall consumers spending has decreased. Even after we get to normal online shopping will be a trend while consumers spending get to normal. Double win here!"
This stock really beat expectations I bought it around 80 I was a fool to sell it at 90 (peak price).
"Back in June or July I posted here saying $SQ would beat $PYPL to $100 now that SQ is less than $3 behind PYPL it’s nice to see some of you finally catch on and some are moving. I said I had 20k on the line that says SQ hits $100 first, who was it on here that confidently said they’d take me up on that offer and would be proud to take that 20k?"
How about selling PPYL and buying SQ at a lower price before ER.
"A company with that much tailwinds is not worth PE of 64. Triple-digit more realistic.Beat it hedgies and the gutless, your selling ain't scaring nobody."
Does anyone know if you buy something at Amazon can you pay with PayPal
Facebook up over 1 % so this is good news for Tech.
An opportunity to buy on the dip
"How do you buy crypto with Paypal. When I login, there are no options... ""For the PayPal community, today is the first time its users can purchase crypto assets directly from PayPal. PayPal is introducing the ability for its users to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. To start, PayPal is offering this service to its US customers, then plans to add more geographies and features over time."""
"As of today, cryptocurrency is now accepted as payments at tens of thousands of merchants in the U.S. on the Flexa network. Top brands such as Whole Foods, Baskin Robbins, Lowe’s, and Nordstrom will now accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Gemini Dollar."
Why is this slowing down when bitcoin hitting all time highs day after day
Bought more PYPL at the close. Bought a lot of stocks at the close actually. This selloff is a gift for those who believe in the future of growth stocks. I've been buying hand over fist. These rates can't continue to rise forever. They will come back down eventually.
I was kicking myself for taking my profit and selling NVDA in the $70s. I have a nice slug of PYPL from the spin off with EBAY and purchases from last year. Not going to make the same mistake twice and hold this one for the duration. Happy to see a CEO who is smart enough to play the long game with Venmo. This stock is a Golden Goose. BUY in now and more on the dips.
"The ""sell off"" notwithstanding, Paypal is well on its way to become one of the main fin techs along with Mastercard and Visa....All the fintechs are good buys and I expect them to remain so for the future but I do expect PYPL at some time to announce that they will be paying a dividend"
"Honestly, I'm rooting for both pypl and sq, competition is good for the consumer and innovation. I am long PYPL."
"Loeb's Third Point exits PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Colfax (NYSE:CFX), and Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW)."
What stock to buy? $SQ or $PYPL?
PayPal and square are going to be the new powerhouse banks in the future
PYPL pay system is frustrating for costumer. Good for company and EBay is better without it. Not buying this yet. Waiting for lower price. Now that it lost its mojo price will trade to higher lows
Paypal dipping pretty bad for the day... I wonder what's going on the back end
Did pypl just miss er? I haven't seen any news yet
"NOW it is a BUY! Sub- 270 is accumulate point. Bitcoin reversal still not seen, yet fully anticipated."
"Will be the new coinbase, but a better brand name"
Turn Around Tuesday
That conference call was great. Can't wait for the expansion in China next year.
there are less than 14M shorts in pypl out of a billion shares plus. this is not a squeeze. this is a distribution. who do ya think is selling 2M plus shares in after hours above 104?
"PayPal will not stay at this level long, if you have been wanting in, get in now. All of the hoop-lah noise will die down soon. And this will be 80+. Folks will be saying, “why didn’t I buy shares when it went below 75??” We all know it’s going to happen. I don’t even think it has been confirmed that Amazon is actually doing what was mentioned, but even if they are, it won’t keep PayPal from growing. This specific market is too big, with Venmo growing at a great pace, and PayPal continuing to grow, this is a no brainer. I’m heavily invested in PYPL and Visa."
PayPal has acquired four companies over the past three months. It will take time but within a year or two earnings will grow significantly more.
"PayPal needs to buy banxa. their MC is only 122 mil. partnerships with major exchanges like binance, kucoin. they need to get on acquisitions quick before this newly listed psp balloons in value."
Up up and up PYPL !!
"Amazon needed to distract the markets from it's own problems of late. Amazon coming into the payments business is like having a store card from 30 years ago. That concept did not dent the growth of Mastercard and Visa, and this will not stop Paypal. Paypal has a immense presence internationally. This was the same case with Visa and Mastercard. They have grown because of this presence not just the U.S."
Spent $2.7B this quarter trying to catch up to SQ. How long before they are back to black on those 4 investments?
"PayPal went up 20% in dec at the announcement vaccines will rollout and again early Feb after earnings. Cut the reopening stocks swap #$%$ The announcement of vaccine rollout was the biggest indication borders will be opening soon and yet it went up. This pullback will be temporary. I and many others will be continuing online purchases post-pandemic. It's just much more convenient and the most practical. Airline tickets, travel excursions, airbnb, hotel bookings, etc. ALL online."
"Hmmm...where is the bottom, or is this it?"
slow is paypals charm. beautiful
"Don't be foolish and sell, look at SHOP today, at earnings it literally stayed flat and then shot out of the door. I am keeping PYPL for a while, only in for a few months anyway and think with the Virus going on and a second wave expected. See where this is at tomorrow."
Heard their might be a 2.5% dividend comming
Easy money.
"Why's is down 3 cents after hours...bad news ( joke,)"
"Wow good day, DT and now this baby getting ready to rocket"
Short target is $300
I just bought 1200 more shares of PYPL@ $78.32
PYPL looking good now :)).
"i really enjoy picking cherry this morning, the market overall is still positive for the next two weeks. Money flows in the financial sector, RSI for PYPL is not overbought. The big boys suppress PYPL so they can get more shares with lower price. Yesterday price is like overheat, but not. PYPL should move up to 84-85 by next Friday."
"a ridiculous sell off, this stock has targets of minimum 225. Time to buy some more. Barron's PayPal Holdings (PYPL), meanwhile, has benefited mightily from pandemic-related trends such as transactions moving online. The stock is up 79% this year to around $193, but Wolfe Research’s Darrin Peller still views it as undervalued. His target price is $225."
Finishing at the high of the day....nice move for PYPL
Nice and expected movement today. Next stop 220. PYPL has become the cornerstone of International monetary transactions and its platform and customer base is growing. exponentially now. I will not be surprised to see $300+ by December (and possibly a 2/1 split on the board). SQ an acquisition target?
got in at 64 and never looked back
thumbs up
We are going all the way back to the old highs and beyond. Cash on sidelines and FOMO are still relevant.
"Walmart: 270 million WEEKLY shoppers, where cash and debit is common. Vote BLUE so Walmart shoppers can afford to spend more!"
Sitting on 40 June 85.00 calls. Gonna get hammered tomorrow. Ride the wave or head for the hills?
Janet Yellen. She said there will be rate hikes to avoid an overheating economy. Translation for the sensible investor: The economy is in great shape and the worst fear is too much growth goo fast causing inflation = very good news for the economy.
Silver making a run for 20 as bank supported markets struggle mightily for meager gains. Warren has sold out of the equity markets.
Ouch. But can’t trust the AH movement before earnings. It’s all noise
"Back in on the dip in to the 230's. I had sold out of disgust, but the low levels are too tantalizing. Caught wind of some announcements that are forthcoming, so I'll accept the risk. Here I go again!"
is visa a better stock to own then pypl
Does anyone know if PayPal is one of the companys that will send money to small biz through the Government loan program.
Check out ENVA. Way undervalued PE of 3.
Who here thinks amazon will strike a deal with paypal? I say with in 2 years
"Anyone out there use Venmo? I use it about once a week. I’d like to hear a discussion on this. I don’t believe Zelle can compete as well because it’s run by the big fee banks who will screw it up. My folks like their credit and debit cards as do as most people. So, what do you think the future will be? Everyone will have a smart phone. When you look at the shared feed from Venmo, it’s 90 percent(or more) kids in their 20s. So will cards and cash be diminished or gone? Thoughts on mobile payments?"
Guess who's entering the blockchain ? Servers are in place.buy on the open or it will be too late.
I bought this yesterday very high. I hope I’m not going to be a bag holder.
"Thumbs if you think PayPal share prices will surge after earnings date, and thumbs dumb if you think it won’t increase much"
All time high amigos! Awesome :))
Most sellers sold pre-earnings. Shorts neednt expect to be bailed out tomorrow.
I have owned this company since they were spun off by eBay no place to go but up stay the course
"Thursday and Friday will be telling for PayPal,,,should pop above $$$$110...."
$301 after market!
"The best stock to buy today should be UNH, correction for UNH is reasonable now. long term July 230 is the best trade"
Current price target $215 here on yahoo finance.Your welcome
"Lol look at these PYPL whiners complaining how they're so poor from a $70 drop...there are stocks that have dropped 30 percent or more right now...be grateful for the money you still have. And as usual, in the bad times the PYPL bears come out to play and trash the company when the selloff isn't company specific. If you can't handle a 7 percent drop in the NASDAQ, think about what you lost when the market fell 35 percent in March...grow a pair of balls and quit whining and buy the dip. This selling won't last forever. My cost basis in PYPL goes back to the split from EBAY and if you think I'm liquidating over a relatively tiny drop like this you're mistaken. Come back to me when this is below 150. Then you have a reason to complain. Until then grow up."
Wish I bought some last October....
I got In at $70 #PYPL
Just another nice day in paradise.
"Im thinking the funds are re-balancing the big gainers, stimulus deal is uncertain still so if they re-balance now they will be ready to jump as soon as they know to add to the more volatile sectors."

"Donald Porterfield, via his hedge fund buying PYPL.target price $210."
investment in PYPL led to try BTC and ETH small start position over December. BUT still dont understand their charges for buying through them. Like idea of not needing my own wallet mgmnt. Can anyone advise what the benefit/disadvantage is of using PYPL for crypto ? What are the charges and where do you see it.thanks in advance.......
I feel sorry for the shorties. Lolol
"Atta boyyy,PYPL….get back up there and beyond!"
Dig deep!........ Close above $90!!
"Bought in today, should have pulled the trigger on SQ today also, that stock is smoking hot recently."
"Looking forward to listening to CEO Schulman and CFO Rainey on Mad Money today, especially PYPL's entry into the crypto business."
Where do you all see us tomorrow?
I would be happy if we can hold $86 for a bit until things stabilize. Bad outlook for 3rd quarter is really a blessing since it came with better earnings overall for the year. Just need to hold it until next ER or better news.
why market green it down .market red it up
How can somebody like Rick Newman be taken seriously as a Journalist? His spouting condemning Politics for taking away free speech. Yes he can wrute books and Articles but uts not Journalism or Truth. Its his far left Opinions. Really anyone who has any self respect doesnt need a Rick Newman to telm them what to think because Rick doesnt want your opinion or your speech? Just buy his books and give him your money
Cramer loves PYPL!!!!! One of his top picks!!!!
i have a feeling..we might see green light even today :-)
Lots behind the curtains that are so positive for the future of this great company
85! 85! 85! breakout coming?
guys sell so i can buy :)
Let's hope this was just a good ol fashioned healthy correction before new highs.$pypl
"I'll say $.70. Giving good-to-strong guidance is key, that'll give us the run-up to $100+ we've been waiting for."
"Here's my question: Is it true you missed revenue, but that you will be greater than Microsoft was when it's stock first appeared? lolll"
Hard to see how we don’t move to and past the price before last earnings
"Komol....Thank you from refraining to type in the message board during trading today. We all appreciate it, believe me. 1 post by you is doable. Thank you, please keep that up ypos."
Let’s be real. How often do you use PayPal? Compared to Visa or MasterCard.
Finger pointing is for 9 years olds.This has nothing.to do with Dems...it's a stampede out if bonds do.to the idea the economy will.start booming. Problem is...the more dovish powell sounds....the higher rates will rise at this point
A very creditable improvement in one week of 3.8%... not bad for the week before earnings are released .... at which time we should see it a further 10% ahead !
Glad I listened to the views in this board!! I have 400 shares at 184
"I'm an early eBay user, and added a PayPal account as soon as possible to end my use of money orders to pay for auctions (thousands of them, really! a lot of trading cards, car parts, household parts and items, etc.).Unfortunately, PayPal is having problems for some users, and no one there is answering / fixing things, apparently. No response to my inquiries for three weeks for a bank verification problem with their website, and their PayPal Assistant function doesn't work either. You can read about many users' problems, worldwide, here:https://www.paypal-community.comI hope PP gets their act back together soon! :-{Sincerely,A neglected customer."
This is going above 200 today after earning ....buying here is gift for day traders
we have bench mark with $PYPL and $SQ
"Buy Paypal today, paypal's ceo is going to be on jim Cramer's Mad Money"
paint dry
Done with ebay now. Paypal is awesome. Its the only service that I will use. Will gladly gobble up discounted shares tomorrow.
“The most exciting news about Venmo during the call came from PayPal CFO John Rainey when he said he believes the company is a quarter or two away from breakeven on the app.”
If we get an overall bullish day (futures already indicating a green day tomorrow) then this things is gonna fly past 83 easy.Keep an eye on PM tomorrow
Next week PYPL will touch $200 most likely after their earnings report
We will see positive movements soon
still a multi bagger $500 in less than 2 years
"Lyft and Uber seeing business coming back string right now.Yes, they both use PayPal and PayPal owned Venmo Love it."
PayPal is up 4.97% to 188.75
PYPL has been making strategic investments all year that have flopped hitting earnings. big question is how much of the losses will be priced in by the 24th?
Not sure I can handle this rotation out of stay-at-home stocks combined with a market that is acting irrationally. Have additional concerns about market's reaction to PYPL's upcoming earnings report regardless of how big of a beat it is.
new highs again today.
Not really a big beat considering the big run it’s had the past 3 months. This will probably sell off before stabilizing and then heading back up.
"Big, you should take your $500 short and go to a new board or back to moms basement."
This is now the most shares I have ever shorted of any stock in 30 years of trading.......$177.......will cover @ $121 and go long
OK..the music changed to a faster upbeat happy tune...going to be good!
Take a look at the volume behind that last 5 minute bar! 243k+.
"Something interesting to note: the management didn't hype up any of the recent major developments, i.e. with the iZettle acquisition. They provided a general overview of the overall development. Could this be because they are looking for an opportunity for buybacks?"
Paypal is the kind of stock that money managers will continue to buy. PYPL and SQ have much more growth than any of the banks.
PayPal is a huge part of the paperless money that is the future. Some holders panicked and Will be regretting their decision in the morning. It’s so sad to see unsophisticated investors lose their shorts because they can’t handle a single earnings report. PayPal is a winner with the same can’t be said for everyone who owns their stock.
"Ending the agreement frees PayPal up to partner up with much bigger and better partners, such as amazon, apple, Alibaba. I think this is a win"
"*PAYPAL 3Q NET REV. $5.46B, +25% Y/Y"
Now is the time to get in.
"There are some whispers that PayPal might announce a dividend on April 24th, during the earnings call."
PYPL is a should own stock for the rest of the year.$100 target near term after earnings.
Momentum gone for 2 Q’s now. Should have bailed out already.
im strapped in
good day to pick up more PYPL
PFANG ( I still pronounce it FANG with the P silent) is set to increase another 3-7 % next week. Why? Not only PayPal but Visa and Mastercard are set to report Feb. 1st!
85 soon!
"Stock price of $PLTR will be $100 in a year. PLTR will see $30 in 10 daysGrowth rate is explosive with $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter up 52% year-over-year.

Moreover, the market opportunity is an enormous $119 billion. $APPL, $ZM, $SHOP, $PYPL, $FB, $TSLA"
What a load of #$%$ Stuff like this is exactly why no one trusts the market based on basic facts and fundamentals. The options traders and the big boys can make a stock go whichever way they want. This type of drop on this earnings and outlook is a raping of the shareholders
Honest opinion should I sell or buy more before earnings?
This situation won't get to normal until atleast the first half of 2021. So Paypal will still accumulate more customers exponentially.
"Zelle can’t even compare to PayPal’s Venmo. If you look at the track record of banks like Wells Fargo and BAC, they are always screwing people over with their added fees."
"This company is an 800 lb gorilla in the sweet spot of mobile payments, a cyclical trend in society. They also have one of the best CEO's out there. I bought this in late 2015 in the low 30's and held it as they executed. I now have over a triple, this is the definition of a quality investment stock. I can't relate to some posters trading for pennies, it's tax inefficient and real wealth is not created that way. I own many other stocks that have done this well over the last 2-4 years. Just my thoughts"
"5% drop today is not a good indication re. the upcoming earnings report. Someone here said ""jaw dropping"". Yes, but could be a ""jaw dropping"" miss and the rocket will drop all the way to the ground...."
bull baby!!!
"PYPL, DKNG and GMBL will be big winners going forward imo"
Take the time to mark those accounts as spam. It’s ok to speak your opinion on a stock but it’s not ok to fill the forum with spam posts about the dot com bubble
Are people serious  and didn’t sell $309? Mother of all bubble stocks ever
"EVERYTHING grew in price (Zoom, Stoneco, Wirecard,Nexi.....) last month, except PayPal.. its time"
Loaded more!!!
Still time to buy. 122 should be a bit of resistance!
"With bitcoin being all the hype and rage now, I believe PYPL will over perform big time going forward, I have been buying crypto through paypal and they are making a lot of money in fees besides all the other stellar service products, I use paypal a lot more than my checking account, debit or credit cards and just like me I see the world adopting fintech more than traditional banking and so this is the future, great company and great stock, I will be adding more to my portfolio."
"It is good flush, so just get ready to buy again. UNH is very good solid stock, just wait for the right price."
This is a great stock!
I think today will be the low on PYPL. Time to pick up a few more shares
This is a must own stock. Still has a lot of upside potential.
We will be taking out the old high shortly. Stock is poised to break out in a big way.
"This is one of the reasons I originally bought PayPal. With all the carnage out there in tech, we are only $4 from our all time high. This stock holds up really well during market sell offs. Important to own stocks like this. Can’t be all high fliers. You need grinders too. IMHO"
This is what all the libTARDS wanted. Congratulations. I was long for 4 years got short January 22nd and won’t cover until 2024!
This will be back to $110+ soon. Eventually it’ll get back to $120 but at this point it’s hard to tell when. Be patient and hold.
"Go look the check point at all big stores, Verifone and NCR, there is a LOGO of Paypal on it. That is telling you that PYPL starts to muscle into the credit card business in a big way. Swift is really moving aggressively into P-P loan. This is the reason that I predict that PYPL will be a big winner for the next few year. If you remember that I keep talking about INDIA, now it will be a big market that PYPL will dominate from now on."
$55 is coming
PYPL should sue anazon over their false statement
Many companies have suffered data breaches this does not mean they are no longer good investments. Paypal is a solid company and will solve it's issues.
"When Venmo comes to the rescue! it might be too late for the weak handed! so load up on this dip. 200 by the end of the year! or as someone told to me, how about a split! why not, we're all dreamers too!"
The story has not changed. The company is buying back shares at this very moment.
golly the number of chances for longs to get out is extra ordinary.
For once PYPL is rallying while SQ is standing still. This stock has quietly roared higher this week. Either it's just me or PYPL doesn't seem to be as sensitive to the movements of Bitcoin as SQ is. Is that judgment correct? Whatever the reason I've made a lot of money with both PYPL and SQ. I am fully confident in them going forward many years into the future and also bulling on Bitcoin long term.
"PayPal under $76 is a gift, well over $80 in few weeks again."
Shorts and sellers just shot themselves in the foot  Longs are laughing their way to the bank
"SQ is up 10% on basically no news....what's up here? I assume that's some short squeeze as they indicate about an 8% of float short, but is there news I'm missing? Uber's deal for postmates is somehow helping them? Where's the comparable paypal run today?"
"Breaking: PayPal price target raised to $206 from $131 at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst James Faucette raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $206 from $131 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The shift to online driven by the COVID-19 pandemic will drive ""stronger for longer"" U.S. e-commerce growth, said Faucette, who sees PayPal being set to grow total purchase volume at or ahead of the rate of e-commerce growth ex-Amazon. He sees opportunities for PayPal to deliver 20% or faster compounding earnings growth as more profitability flows through to the bottom line, he added."
Still undervalued......
Next $100+ stock!
FB should buy PYPL for $160. That would be a financial powerhouse
"Although I investing heavily in square but I do still love pypl (global payment system, leader payment platform online, Venmo), there is place for both. I won’t be greedy, keep both!"
What a brutal company for small business. I had to refund a customer for an internet order and this company kept the transaction fee. So if a customer orders from me and then they change their mind I am on the hook for the commission. I've been a long time holder of the shares and have done well. Disappointing that they lack in ethics.
"$PYPL is nice, but a +1% gain isn't going to change my life. Neither is a -4% afterhours. I'm looking for small caps that have massive upside and by massive i'm talking stocks that could double, triple or more. There's limited availability, so check them our here: https://hotstocks.watch/triple-digit-percent-gainers"
This is heading back to $90
Trying to decide whether to buy more or not. Nasdaq and tech stocks are cratering. Starting to look like the run for tech stocks is over. Thoughts?
"Beast, best stock currently in my portfolio."
"added more today, am concerned that earnings will be better than expected"
"Typical ""buy the rumor"", ""sell the news"". Are we really all that surprised? It's had a nice run in a sloppy market this month and a pullback after earnings is not unusual. It's done it before. Consolidates, stabilizes and then marches northward to new highs. There will always be a wall of worry to climb; the FB earnings will be in focus tomorrow, just as Googles earnings was yesterday. Ying/Yang, etc. Bottom line, PYPL is growing, both organically and through acquisitions. Forward looking statements are positive overall. The stock will recover after tomorrow#$%$; maybe even Friday too; but it will recover. Mid/Late summer trading is always sketchy as well. Longs need to be patient; hold for the next ER or take advantage of the lower prices in the upcoming days to truly build a position. IMHO"
This is a stock to own now and in the future. $95.00 by Friday or better after earnings!!!! Buy and keep!!!
"Rich TEAM is doing real good, he was in TEUM and GROW"
"EBAY issue is a major problem that will drag PYPL down or not go higher until 2020. I guess PYPL will float around 75-80 unless VENMO still in the process of monetizing. If VENMO does not show the higher growth rate, I guess PYPL will not go higher than 80."
15% jump tomorrow!!!
Would like to buy but with the 10 yr pushing to go above 1.5% it does not bode well for teck stocks.....anyone adding here??
"Dies anyone start to feel a bit eerie about this incredible meteoric rise of PYPL?Mirror the stnning rise of AMZN 2016 - 2020, FB 2014-2018.A voice inside me is starting to wispher ... s, s, se, sel, sel, sell ........ at least a bit of it."
Barclays is a big bank looking to help clients sell their pypl shares without collapsing the price in the process. Barclays is telling you to buy PYPL shares from its clients. Simple really.
Best darn stock in da land. Take that to the bank!
Pypl deserved much more!!
what's thi class action lawsuit filed against PYPL today?
I'm in at SQ for 1000 shares. Paid 71.44. Wish me luck !
"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden on Monday said a coronavirus vaccine approval process must be guided by science so the public can have confidence it is safe and effective, warning that the United States is still facing a very dark winter and that a vaccine likely won't be available for months."
Breaking: PayPal price target raised to $200 from $176 at Wedbush
"I guess a PE of 64 is not cheap anyway, so it's now resetting for valuation"
looks like somebody missed out on the surge and is trying to get in cheap
All market is down...its market effect. As soon as market recovers it will be easy +270
be patient. A great earning is in 7 days.
Today on CNBC:￼ Pypl up over 100% in 3 months. It is a major beneficiary in the shift to e-commerce that is happening as a result of the pandemic. They are seeing unbelievable new new numbers of new users in volume growth because of people changing their behavior and shopping online. They have done 15 million new net users just in April and May alone. Their largest prior to any quarter then this one was 10 million. So a 50% increase in three months.Volumes are up 50% also.They have pulled forward three or four years of e-commerce growth in the first two months related to the pandemic. Amazing!
"If PYPL can break $112.64 then next resistance is $130.00.Buy,BUY,BUY"
people start selling sq and buying paypal after third point big stake
PYPL will fly on Monday
Congrats ro everyone that bought or held on the Amazon news. You make money when you buy not when you sell.
Let`s go
"Congrats to me for calling this to the T. I picked up 150 calls at .07-.08 per contract and just sold them for $2.30 ea....One of my biggest ROI's ever. This still has a bit more to go,but not risking it."
"Once market sentiment improves, this stock will be back over $90. Need to get over Fed speculation. Feds will raise rates if inflation increase. Let's not lose our minds. Economy is strong and ill handle 3-4 hikes over the next 15 months. China Trade wars will continue to rage on for another few months. IF GOP retains control of the house and senate, China will give in."
$250 by end of the year! At least!
"Hate it when I miss the train, not buying now...seems too expensive."

Easy 120$ in 2 months... PyPl..
Congrats Long! Thanks for the support!
"Unlike Square, PayPal doesn't hold Bitcoins... Given the tremendous growth in active users and payment volumes, I think the stock may go back to it's ATH of $300 soon"
I use PayPal everyday for my business. Love the app and I hope they continue to innovate with new features.
PYPL IS A BUY TODAY.https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220
Warren Bufet has just reached a record level of cash holdings. The meltdown will be epic.
"It must be some news coming to the wire soon, is the reason that PYPL drops like a rock in the morning. But i still cling to the stock because it has so solid fundamental, a little pricy but high growth rate. The number in Jan will tell you that PYPL is THE REAL DEAL."
"With the Bitcoin momentum, don’t be surprised to see Pypl in the $400s right quick."
Amazon- can you spell Monopoly- time to brake this bad boy up.....
I have to think if PYPL is going to be successful and grow the relationship with EBAY will be less significant than everything else they have going on. EBAY has to be jealous of PYPL success and they probably needed to squeeze everything they can out of the payment process. I hope and my money is riding on this being a bump in the road instead of a fork in the road.
144.45 and 146.33 two important resistances to break then blue skies to 151+
bears sterns cramer says there is never any reason to sell any stock. oh and buy pypl at any price too.
"PYPL earnings come out Thursday,They are expected to earn $.83 I think they will beet with $.87. Stock goes up $3.00 after report. What is everyone guessing it will be."
What time is earning
Love CNBC Had Money! They are spot on with stocks....Go PYPL! $ 95.00 Wednesday.
"To ALL PYPL shareholders. I bought PYPL back when it was $70 a share. I was doing great until the sell off in DECEMBER and I got scared and sold. I REGRET doing so. I bought back in at $83 a share. I will for SURE hold, even if dips 5-10%. PYPL has never disappointed me. I was wrong to have sold fast, noob mistake, rookie error. I learned from my mistakes and can not wait until I see +25-50% on my list. And also add more if able too!"
This stock is really turning out to be a WINNER! Bought at $37 a couple of quarters ago. I think it is a greatstock to be acquired.
Will finish in Green. You just love to see it
"It feels soooo much like a young teenage AAPL of 2010. Relentless, unstoppable, irrepressible, darling of Wall St.Unless I could identify a 500M cap company that gives me a chance of a 30 baggers in 10 years, I see no reason to track another mid-size and above company."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-nasdaq-pypl-000230518.htmlThis is a great outlook. if you don't buy now, may not get another chance for a great entry."
ebay just blew it out of the water 
"Why is PYPL struggling, when SQ is up over 4$Mizuho said PYPL & SQ to buy with increase stock value but only SQ seems to take advantage of the buy status."
Can this thing actually fall 1% ever. Haha let's see on the close
"PYPL is a bargain with a forward P/E ratio of 52.68 in comparison to the industry's average Forward P/E of 82.44. If PYPL breaks projected earnings predictions, expect a significant spike up and a runaway train well in to next year."
We will reach $93 by Friday after ER
"dam shorties, putting out garbage over n over,muted and reported them"
PayPal reached an all time high at 234.00
PayPal has stalled. in the meantime buy some ripple. you won't be disappointed
"Investors should listen to all the details in the conference call before dumping all their shares.The statements below give me confidence in the future of PYPL. PayPal Chief Executive Daniel Schulman characterized the move as expected and baked in to PayPal's forecasts and plans for some time, and noted the operating agreement signed at the time of the split precluded PayPal from working with some large potential partners. He called it ""the best possible outcome for PayPal.""""There's nothing about what's been announced today that changes our thoughts on our ability to continue to grow our top line and bottom line after the operating agreement,"" PayPal CFO John Rainey said in that company's conference call."
Just don’t know why this hasn’t caught up with the rest of the pack..
Convince why this is a better buy than V or MA
PYPL is ready to make new 52 week high.
eBay is going to start using another payment processor Ayden. PayPal canstill me used by members but the transactions will take place off of eBay's site.The huge drop in PayPal's stock doesn't make sense to me. Obviously PayPal knewthis was going to happen and they have already factored this change into their earningsguidance. Once again an overreaction by traders. Take advantage and buy the stock at these levels.Easy money. I bet this trades back into the 80's tomorrow.
Look for an open around 320 in Tuesday and a close around oubd 330
"People who care about minor price fluctuations should stop investing and try to get quick money with more volatile stocks. Pins is one of the best stocks to buy at these prices. Maybe it goes down a bit, then buy the dip. I Bought $SQ at 36, $CHGG at 29, $ETSY at 40, $ZM at 63 $, $PYPL at 100. Many people one these boards were saying these are wothless stocks, or moving slow. I truly believe Pins will be a triple digit stock in the coming years. ARK investments (Cathie Wood, look it up) has also added PINS to their portfolio. Scientific research has proven that short term traders, will earn quick money, while long term holders gather the most wealth overtime!If you are not happy with PINS then sell the stock and chase other opportunities. However, PINS is a safe investment. I posted last week a post with some facts. Look it up."
Too late to get in at 91+?
PYPL down only 2.23 and still over 89. Wasn't long ago that 89 sounded great! Now some people are disappointed. Hmmm. FB down 20%. PYPL will stabilize and will make new highs once again; most likely sooner than later. I think too many people were spoiled from the huge Trump rally from late 2016 to the end of 2017. We're in a choppy market for the past 6 months and yet PYPL continues to grow their business and their stock price. IMHO
anyone else not really care about the dip?
"Paypal continues to be a payment choice on Ebay at least through 2023. You use a credit card or paypal, just like before. I fail to see what all the concern is over this matter. I think the stock price drop was way overdone."
PayPal going to $70 soon!
"BIGG Acquires 60.7 Bitcoin, Now Totals 300 BTC in Treasury.....For more insider information @money_stock_pick"
"I’m in $SQ, but I watch $PYPL religiously; there’s room for both of these great companies! ￼"
"Another stock correction comming tomorrow, Friday....always....option expires....caution...."
Would it be unrealistic for PYPL to offer home mortgages?
Target $120: PYPL beat est in both top and bottom lines with double digits growth rates.
What I love about PYPL was that I invested in PYPL because I was a client and loved the ease of operation sending and receiving money out of the country. So as Peter Lynch always preached in his books when you have anecdotal evidence on something being a hit buy it and I did. And doubled twice along the way.
Up 6% tomorrow
I don't think it can support these new highs...
Big day tomorrow for Q3 report. All telling on the projected slow down issued in Q2. We will see what happens. I am holding until the results come out...hoping they are good enough to float the stock up.
at what time results will be out?
"Said that last week, say that again now.This doesn't bother me the least. Nobody can keep a stock with an endless tsunami of tailwinds behind it down for long.Anyone who is panicking now should not even be in stocks at all."
Wow after market
"A meh report.. they met lowered expectations. After what happened to Netflix losing their gain with blowout numbers, I would be very careful"
"I bought 100 shares of Ebay 12 years ago and have held it ever since. I basically got a 100 shares of PayPal for free! However if you split out the price of each from my original buy, I paid $12 a share for Ebay and 20.99 for PayPal!"
"There are 2.6 million Bitcoin left to be mined. Surprisingly, even though 18.4 million Bitcoin were mined in just over 10 years, it will take another 120 years to mine the remaining 2.6 million. That’s because of the Bitcoin halving. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (a new block is created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. About 900 Bitcoins are mined per day."
Explosion!! PayPal simply the best.GROW up 10% on a side note :)
haha where is that Kevin guy?
"$SQ $VERI $IBM $PYPL With SQ's new payment terminal with luxurious, innovative features, can now easily compete with Verifone, Ingenico, etc"
look at the power going into this resistance! push! KaioKenx20!!
"Ladies and gentlemen, the ship is coming into port! And its not a speedboat! It's not a cabin crusier! It's a friggin' luxury yacht. The economy may be due for a correction in the future but by that time the stock price of PayPal should be able to withstand any slump. The moat is built Even PayPal's investment in Mercadolibre is up over 100%. Almost $1100 A SHARE price for MELI!"
BLAST OFF!!
do we think that eBay cutting them out as payment processing for sellers effective 2/1.. will affect there bottom line moving foward???
"In case you didn't look, 10 year bond yield has been rising consistently since Sept 2020. It didn't stop Paypal from peaking at $309 in Feb 2020."
I bought at 83.78. Not worried at all. This will get back up in a few months. 100-150 by end of year. Most likely around 120. 35-55% increase from where it is at now. Nothing to worry about LONGs
why is this down today?
$210+ tomorrow !!!!!
"I believe this stock just got way too far ahead of itself. I sold all my shares just before the shut down in order to protect my profit and bought a ton back at $89/sh. I believe that the stock is solid for the long term but, the price per share was above the top price BEFORE the shut down of the country. That made no sense to me other than simply unrealistic enthusiasm. I sold it all off again at a few pennies shy of $145/sh. Looking forward to buying back in again when it makes sense. I love pypl but at the right price."
"I agree with PYPL's COO that PYPL should not monetize VENMO now, just add more value in it for another year, until the millennials have a feeling they can not live with out VENMO, which I think that day will come soon."
Any $300 price targets on the street? $SQ does
I love PYPL but sold out at $105. Gotta say I'm pretty shocked this is running.
I own Square and PayPal and I’m glad I got in Square early but I’m starting to feel like it’s just WAYYY too parabolic.
America first?.............. Not for eBay ......
Nothing seems to be hotter than Fintech right now. Between PYPL and SQ they have 'all systems go'
This thing is going to a trillion!!
"All the hedge funds just have fun to scoop the health care stocks today. AMZN issue is just the idea that is very hard to happen. If you know how the health care providers can develop up to this point, it takes over 10-15 years. Look back at each health care provider then up to now. It takes a lot of time both money and energy before becoming to today. If you think AMZN can disrupt this industry, you need to go see the doctor to check your brain."
13 agencies upgraded $PYPL. I can see tomorrow up more than 5% again
no brainer buy
Just bought 325 shrs of PYPL at $ 88.73 pre market
"its on sale time to buy, will bounce back to $200+ by year end"
Where are the buyers?
"Whilst PayPal is back to where it was 3 weeks ago, it should make up the lost ground during the run up to earnings, or in the very least during a pop at the ER. SQ on the other hand is back to where it was 8 weeks ago and in all likelihood will struggle from this level."
"This will beat earnings as usual but this time will be definitely different, the level of transaction will be astronomically higher..strong buy and hold."
This is a growing company. A good chance to buying in more.
"Wouldn't you like to find another fintech like SQ or Paypal before it is discovered and just pennies? If you guys want to find an excellent fintech opportunity check out GOHE, this one is about to turn. GOHE got a top Overstock.com exec on board to help run the company's growth. We all know the story of Paypal. GOHE could be next. This is not a pump, do your dd and you will see.$PYPL $OSTK"
Sometimes the mute button is your best friend :-).
News  alert : PayPal officially changing its name and ticker symbol to: PayPUKE  PUKE
I reckon when Square gets down to $25 Schulman ought to pick it up as PayPal’s next acquisition
"a close above a 100, would be a breakout, with clear sailing to 110-120."
"New 52 week high coming any time now, GLTA."
"Jan 26, call 78 is really good choice. I believe that PYPL can hold 78 because the market should move even higher, when bond market moves in opposite."
This stock is gonna hit $100!! Wahoo!
soon its gonna be green !!! there is no way it stays down..let the upgrades come..just add some more
Atlantic Equities upgraded PayPal from Neutral to Overweight and set a new price target of $315.00
Big can I buy more shares from you at 105?
up almost $5 in AH trading.
"Plan on holding this until at leas $120, then I will decide on my next move."
"I posted that SQ was reporting today (Mon.) My mistakes, its the 27th or 28th. Didn't mean to confuse anyone!"
Easy $21 by Monday. $PYPL is increasing why not Paysafe soon. Bitcoin boost with paysafe as well next.
"Lets not forget a short time ago on April 20, 2017 PayPal closed at only $43.69. Now we are up $15.40 in only 3 months. Watch it fly after earnings. More good news coming. Unless North Korea launches a missile at U.S. among other places stocks will continue going higher.Accumulate on any large dip!"
"If we see good earnings today on AMZN and GOOGL, PYPL will rally very handsomely tomorrow"
Slow and steady. Enjoy the ride and buy on any big dips.
making loads of return in this flat market is as simple as buying pypl on any dips. just look at it go. new highs today.
J.P. Morgan Chase and Paypal will be announcing new partnership Thursday... exciting times are building.... get ready for the tsunami guys !!!
I'm adding at $75.70
"I believe there are some big blocks wait in line, because PYPL is very volatile all day. This morning I expect PYPL will be around 84.40 because of the index, but not. Let's see how high PYPL will close today. If PYPL passes 85 this week, we will see PYPL at 90 AT LEAST."
"Paypal on it's way to $70 with no resistance....'yea mon"" we be jammin."
look at 6x PayPal open end long for the consolidation chart
$PYPL to the moon!
NICE MOVE.
Too late to jump in? Maybe with a premarket order which will actually buy at opening price?
i regret selling at 80 dollars back while ago and now I felt GOOD!
i told you so!
"If your short PYPL cover your positions, go longs"
Could dip a little more
Sell my shares? FIGHT ME.
My electric bill now has PayPal option. I keep seeing it in new places.
Could this be the next PYPL or Venmo? HUMBL merging with $TSNP. What do you think?
"Looking very good today, cant wait to see the end of the week"
"I love reading all the comment about how PayPal will go nowhere and is a #$%$ company. I?ve been reading these same comments since PayPal was in the $50?s, $60?s, $70?s, etc. Please keep it up because it seems to keep the stock moving in the right direction. It?s all the shorts getting burnt"
"Market is OVERBOUGHT right now. The tax cut starts to kick in in full swing for everybody. I personally believe that PYPL will benefit even more. VENMO brand is very visible in the near future. Rainey is absolutely right, PYPL is patient and play the long game. I think we will hear the great news about VENMO this year. Now I start to accumulate PYPL in shares instead of trade on options. I see PYPL 100 this year."
How many think it’s $100 after 430 pm ? Raise your hand .
EOD will be around 147.50
PYPL just bought back 1.237 shares
MM will run this up a bit like I predicted and then short it down heavy imo.
Do you think PYPL will be up post earnings? Thumps UP for higher stock price and Thumps DOWN for lower stock price.
"Ladies and gentlemen,Heed these words... we are getting dangerously close in stock price as a potential takeover target. Amazon, Mastercard, and Visa would all be potential suitors in an aqusition. All that the bear posts are trying to get their ""puts"" and ""calls"" taken care of and folks are not looking at Paypal's fundamentals. But rest assured, these other companies are."
"""New "" here what if PayPal beats earnings next week, what are your thoughts on price range? Also what if they miss how low do you think this will fall."
Bank of America Securities increased its price target for the stock to $215 from $194.
"rocket, please"
"These stocks options are just for sell, not buy: you will never make any dime on directional options play: calls or puts:PYPL/SQ/NFLX/SHOP,..."
Sell Sell Sell now.Bit-coin is not stable.PYPL will find a new ground around $230.
This is gonna bounce real nice!!!
Another acquisition! Simility acquisition announcement!!
$PYPL to the moon 
PayPUKE has to rally $32 to get back where it was last week lol 
Nice pullback from opening. Time to fly
222 by Inauguration Day... if not sooner.
"PayPal will go up to $228.00 per share. I like the outlook. Another stock, TSNP is being talked about as a Baby PayPal. The merger to HumblPay is complete. Check it out."
Plenty of mojo this stock has!!!
up 6%??
Volume is picking up! PayPal will close strong!
There’s going to need to make a 5% dividend here
PayPal board needs to consider a 2 - 1 split when we hit $180/shr.
Synchrony to issue Paypal Venmo co-branded credit cardhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3506465-synchrony-issue-venmo-co-branded-credit-card?dr=1#email_link
Add 500 at 254...hope this be green EOD or tomorrow.Will go long with this
The sell off makes no sense. The next earnings will be a blowout and the investment in China will prove to be a huge win. China is currently the second largest economy in the world and soon to bethe largest. Doing business and travelling there I see it first hand. From my part I will be selling some other holdings and purchase more paypal.
"I really think PayPal is a better company than SQ, pypl is at scale, pulling more than 5billion + rev, with massive profits and SQ only has 500million with losses, too much hype and overpriced compare to pypl, should be 300 billion by now"
"This is painful, my portfolio has been wiped 25% in a matter of a couple weeks with great stocks. Hoping for a better day on Monday, Longs. We will recover , buy when the market is fearful ! $APPL $TSLA $AVGO $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA $PYPL $SQ $BABA"
"How PYPL will generate revenue to replace EBAY, this is a big question for Dan. EBAY announcement is a big hit to PYPL growth rate, even though it still keeps going on for a few more years. Only way that PYPL can do is put more resources into VENMO and make it national brand and global brand. It is a must, no matter how much it will cost. To make it VENMO ME embedded into the consumer brain is like make golden arc into the kid's brain."
I love hearing people complain about PayPal blocking their account after they break the terms and conditions.. lol
SELL! Cash payment is the future!
Made a big investment in PYPL shortly after it split off from EBAY. One of my best investments ever !!
The said may 1st was there busiest day ever ..... lol its labour day for ever country outside the US every one was on holiday ... wht a joke
"This too shall pass, and quickly i might add. PayPal is an unstoppable force at this point in time and the actions of eBay are but a hiccup. You were presented with an excellent buying opportunity and I hope you all took advantage of it."
PayPal reached an all time high at 148.69
PYPL will be over 110 before November 29~ as this week's chart pattern is indicating a pivotal pending parabolic up move when 105s breaks. Over 105.70 will trigger stoplosses on shorts and triggers fresh buyers who will ride it to all-time highs in the coming months. Would not be surprised to see PYPL over 120 before year end.
"This is not a stock you trade. This is a stock you buy and hold for years. Their story is intact and growth is on track. Temporary ups and downs from market trading don't change that fact. If you buy and hold, you will be rewarded."
"Highest closing price ever. More to come. Buying in front of earnings is likely. Recent all time high within striking distance. Earnings will be out in 2 weeks, and if history repeats itself, we're likely to pass 90. Then 100 will be in the crosshairs and likely to be overcome. IMHO - GLTA"
Making new all time highs yet again.
Share buyback!

horrible customer service .... just saying ...

Pay pal

IN A CRASH ( THAT IS COMING ) THIS IS A 65.00 PP/SHR
"if cash money transmits covid19, wouldn't paypay and all other electronic forms of payment be a better bet."

I buy a few shares every time it dips below $290.00
Here is the change in PayPal transaction amounts quarter to quarter. Billions. It is really accelerating. 2020 Q4 +30.382020 Q3 +24.962020 Q2 +31.162020 Q1 -8.832019 Q4 +20.732019 Q3 +6.312019 Q2 +10.872019 Q1 -2.162018 Q4 +20.652018 Q3 +3.62018 Q2 +7.04
Paypal buys another business to propel themselves towards the cashless domination juggernaut that they are/will become. This is just the start
"paypal got over hammered on ebay announcement. 20+ years ago ebay had BID PAY...never used it...as a seller i opted to use paypal, western union, and at times used money orders as a option to pay still to this day. the media would make you think because ebay is switching to another payment system, people will drop paypal as a payment options on ebay....ebay was wrong before, they are wrong again. sellers and buyers determine what payment system they use. no payment system is mandatory on ebay...if there was....ebay stock holders would have to worry. as a ebal seller i have used western union, paypal, money orders, and bank transfers on high dollar itemsalot of media paypal bashing claims X, Y, and X could no same thing, and better. they said the same thing about NFLX, AMZN for years too. in fact just months a go a speaker on financial show said google, msft. amzn and more have the cash to instantly compete with NFLX. there was talk many times by investor sites that NFLX was not a buy out candidate, more or less anyone could do what the company does. Square and paypal imo, should be looked at as buyout candidates, paypal if they acquire square, it will be too late game over...welcome the next AMZN, NFLX, etc"
This is the best fintech name to own. Both a recovery and COVID stock. Bitcoin play as well 
We have a flat yield curve. I estimate Pypl going to $40 in 1-2 years.
Usually play the er but I’ll sit out on this
Current P/E is 84 and 12 month forward P/E is 51 doesnt that mean that analysts are expecting the price to go up in 12 months? i cant think of other explanation. and by the way the Forward P/E is used by the FED
Bought some more
"I mean really, this is a no brainer.230 target sounds about right...if we are talking end of november that is.Wishing my funds were already cleared but you work with what you've got."
All bets in ? I am all in
"2 key events in the coming period that can boost Paypal stock:1. Investors day.2. Announcement of buying, selling and holding crypto in another countries."
why is pypl down when every other stock is up. Why is a vaccine negative for PayPal?
"what is this scary talk about ""Venmo, the digital money-transfer service operated by PayPal Holdings Inc., is ratcheting up pressure on users the company says owe it money for transactions that went awry."" from the wall street journal? is this cause for concern? have heard so much news about record credit card and loan delinquencies."
the crash that was thwarted in 2008 with low interest rates can no longer be delayed. the fake market is being realized for its inherent value. a return to single digit p/e's is a matter of when not if.
pullback to 260? or keep rising and keep 270 as a base? any opinions?
"The big dog poised for a big month. Lots of recommendations from major Investor’s includjng David ( the smart brother from MF) he has it as one of his FIVE stocks to buy in 2018. That guy has a great track record and can smell a winner a mile away. Just hold on, tune out the noise and make some real money. Don’t get scared out by any head fakes along the way. This stock is going up big time. IMHO"
First explosion underway. Where is yoda? Oh noooooo.
Everyone “on board” now? Sold all your $177 stock and went short 4x (quadruple) what you were long. Will make back all your losses before noon. This is how you trade.
"So predictably, the fix is in, welcome to the rigged markets, stay long and prosper....."
"Just pick the expiration date a little bit further. The world is not bad, just take a big profit for the last two days. It will end sooner than you think because I have seen this kind of sell off before. It is too early to step in. I have to take a chance because it is hard to find PYPL drop this hard. I believe in what Daniel said."
Why are we down AH?
Maximum short PayPUKE  Anyone in at $309? LOL 
"Be honest anyone in from $215 fake crypto low volume new 52 week high, OR $192 this am on the Morgan Stanley fake upgrade? Just shorted more $177......."
"Great buy at this point in my opinion, getting more contracts. Good luck guys!"
SQ has better potential than PYPL.
PayPal just approved BTC ... this is a big deal b/c PYPL is much larger than Square .... this means that VISA and MasterCard and American Express won't be far behind with respect to integrating Bitcoin as options to buy using accumulated rewards or to use as a payment option.
UMA crypto synthetic token will take UMA 5000x !! the only synthetic Token will tap into the a 1quadtrillion market of stocks and insurance connecting defi cryptos at that time UMA will be 32k :))No joke the real deal is about to happen !!!
Thumbs up if you think PYPL will hit $350 this year. Thumbs down if you feel it reaches $300
I see some bargains. SAP now has p/e of 25. PLD is 20.
The “person” who bought $183.50 will be addicted to crystal meth by the close
This EASILY cracks $300 within the next few months UNLESS a market correct occurs.Enjoy!!!
"Congrats to Paypal holders, I aint . But I do like to see longs win a few rounds and stuff the short's short's."
Nice vote of confidence by the Closing Bell team on CNBC. $SQ $PYPL
"Heading towards $100. 6 months ago I called for $100 by July 1, 2018. I think we will get there earlier than I predicted."
Is tomorrow an up day???
Earnings will be a blowout. Think we fly thereafter. IMHO
"Will be interesting to see if PayPal gives some insight into newly minted Bitcoin revenue in this next Quarter after the rollout last month. This is the golden goose. No matter if Bitcoin goes up / down PayPal makes $$$ on the transactions. Increased btc volatility? Increased retail transactions, increase in revenue. Win win."
looks like last ER when we added 14%
going up is the only option. heaven forbid a lower close tomorrow.
FINISH STRONG!
"wow I deleted my paypal account yesterday and the stock fell by 3,64% didn't expect that. imagine more people delete their paypal accounts"
Under $116 now. I'm a buyer under $115 if we get there today!
"If PayPal falls, I'll buy some more. This market is nuts."
I love when this stock goes up and SQ goes down
"For any long term holder...do you see an earnings beat? I am the newbie to this board, have done DD, but is always good to hear from some long term holders. Thanks in advance and GLTA."
"Venmo, Venmo, Venmo. The power of the app hasn’t been harnessed yet. Once the pandemic is under a bit more control and people can go out for dinner and drinks again, money exchange via Venmo (owned by PYPL) will be massive."
“Decent” end to a week of unpredictable swings.. decent
I just bought Paypal =>Paypal And Mastercard Extend Instant Transfer To Singapore & Europe
Is this just the stock being finicky EOD on a Thursday? Is this a pattern it usually follows?
Nice moves this week $ENPH $QS $CHWY $PYPL $DDD $TWTR were a few of my best performers. $GBTC is Rock'n'Roll!! Looking for a big move north for $PLTR when it reports before the bell Tueday. Not priced for perfection. A weak pocket to be taken advantage. $RKT perhaps the best value in the entire market. Enjoy the weekend. Buy $PLTR after hours. Premarket on Tuesday may be a little late.
The Supreme Court ruling to legalize Sports gambling should prove a bonanza for Paypal !
"When I looked at 7:30 tonite, it was at $139.00. Congrats to us all, trying to figure out this market is something that just makes no sense. Just take the gift of being up close to $11 & hope the trend continues tomorrow."
$TSNPReverse split 4:1 means you get 1 share for every 4So if you have 400 shares at $1 you get 100 shares at $4It does nothing to change the value of the stock.It also means a quicker uplist to #NASDAQ This means it will hit $PYPL prices inside of 2 years.
support is 73. relax
"Ive been wondering why PYPL was creeping up the past 2 weeks. Finally got crypto access, thats the main reason I bought in a few years ago. PYPL was the only company with any interest in it at all."
Whole market buying more on good speech from MR POW WELL....Data-focused Powell says may take more than three years to hit Fed inflation goal...So there won't be any interest raise for 3 yrs from now.....this give high boost to stock market.....uptrend more...
Bought for a trade@251 sold ahr 267

StevenCorp downgrades $GOF to a strong SELL with a PT of $10. Long Live $PYPL
Premarket looking strong. Another record day amigos. March to $90 continues. Vamos!
We just keep winning!
what's going on
"Time to load up. PYPL moves earnings date from Jan 25 to Jan 31, the same day with FB. It is very interesting to see PYPL number, I have to move the date back to Jan 30 to give some number 10 min. before closing."
With Dan Schulman at the reigns this thing keeps going up and up.
one step closer
It’s BUY time!
"Every partnership, big or small brings value to Paypal... just got news here in Australia that ""Gumtree"" ( an Ebay type company that's been around here for years ) is now accepting Paypal for buyers and sellers... Go Paypal !"
"I have three college kids. They have grown up with PayPal, and they have not heard of Ayden or any other PayPal competitior. They have urged me to buy and hold PayPal it's very popular on campus. Young people trust and use PayPal, it's the way to pay in the futrue. I now own 2500 shares."
"It was a good week stocks considering the week before.PYPL seems to have settled down and is cruising along with the S&P 500 since the eBay news. That's basically what I expect for the next few quarters unless we get some upgrades, downgrades or unexpected news.I have a relativity small position in PYPL. MasterCard is one of my core holdings and I love the payments sector. I think PYPL has great long term potential especially in a couple of years when they are free from the eBay agreement. For now, I'm holding what I have and if we get a market correction that sends it in the 60's I will double down."
Stock has risen 10% this week on the prospect of the earnings news. Be careful overnight...
stimulus has people flush with cash and I and like others have totally stopped using cash for payments. paypal is in the sweet spot
"I have both PYPL and SQ, but my thoughts are that SQ will outperform PYPL in the long term"
"PYPL has been falling since Dec. 2017; along the way there have been so many negative news and opinions from competition landscape. However, the earning and all the metrics have been very strong. It looks like the short camp lost their shirt in 2017 while PYPL skyrocketed from $40 to over $80. I sense some manipulation here to drive the price down to recover some of their loss. Just be patient and the rising numbers will push the price to go higher probably in 2nd half of 2018."
"Ayden is not Paypal, people will not just switch to Ayden. Paypal will compete, and it has economies of scale Ayden does not have. Paypal is a unique company, and it will continue to trump it's competition. It is not just that easy to write off Paypal. It has a track record and not a unknown company."
"Closing in on our 52 week high. Venmo will drive this stock. One of the best strategic acquisitions ever in Fintech. No telling how high it will take them. The sky is the limit. $100 by the Ides of March. Et Tu, Brute."
I doubled down my short from $211 when I came in here yesterday and read 100 posts how this was going to $230 after earnings; shorted more this am $177
"How would cryptocurrencies, whether Bitcoin or a Government issued one affect PYPL or V?"
With the news stimulus coming e-commerce will benefit greatly
buy buy buy. gonna rock $100
$PYPL should buyouts STNE
wonder which hedge funds drove the stock down then loaded up like its 1998
Stock is headed to $210 according to Alex Greene of PugatchAdvisory.
"It looks like rotation cools off now. This week COST and ADBE will report on Thursday, both have great number, but does not mean they will pop up, particularly COST. ADBE is a good choice to pop up because it pulls back from the high. PYPL will make a move after New Year, or after Christmas if the market is still hot."
"2020 I am predicting that pypl will be an option for amazon , either way it’s a great stock to have owned since 2015 Everyone have a safe holiday"
My prediction is this goes to $125 within the next two years.
"With the start of Holiday season, PYPL is going to explode up for at least the next 2 quarters. Should approach $100/share. Now is not the time to sell."
"The damage to this portion of the Tech. sector is not going to be bad at all. Paypal is not an expensive stock when you look at what this company has achieved and will achieve. Financial stocks are a bigger risk, since top management in these banks were never removed, they have again indulged in practices which are not above board. It may well be this is why they are so worried about interest rates going up even a little. It may be possible that their loans are not so good. Wells Fargo may be the latest in this, the fact that their books did not meet expectations. Companies like paypal are the future. They challenge the concept of 20th century banks which really offer nothing in this space."
Possibility of EBAY separating from PYPL was known PRIOR to ER and as addressed b PYPL and conference! read :https://marketrealist.com/2018/01/how-ebays-exit-could-affect-paypal
At least the buyback blackout is now over. Hopefully the company will provide support will all those dedicated billions.
"Hey Big you got a problem, V reports tomorrow and they usually kill it...Not only will PYPL go up under its own power but Visa will add to its climb"
Buy Buy Buy it's a no brainier people..
Got in a month ago and already up 15%

"Lmao people like komol make me laugh, and money. thanks for selling me your shares. What a noob. The reason you lost your profits is because you sold them. this #$%$ is going back up. idiot"
that's how we roll. PAYPAL
Acquisitions good!.............. Shares buyback gooooooood!!!
New 52 week high... Yes please!
Another positive to pull out from this slump is that acquisitions Paypal is eyeing are looking greater and greater value !
Does anyone know what’s caused today’s surge?
Happy new year
Why not own both Square and PayPal? ;)
$280 next week
"Sold position today for a 30% profit, but I regret it now. When should I re-stock?"
Hold this - cup and handle break back to upside soon
"Freaky day...FBC blew-out earnings....in 20 seconds went from 39.50 to 40 and closed at 36.75....unreal.....PYPL fell with the cloud stocks today.....PYPL has been overdelivering on earnings....so if they do again Wed., after the close, then PYPL races to 105, unless weak guidance is given....TXN will drag alot of sectors down on Wed.....fasten your seat belts....it's going to be a long winter and it sucks to be long, but stay the course."
IT SEEMS MR BUFFET LOADING MORE ON BEATEN DOWN TECH STOCKS....
yes the market is in a bubble. get on board. we got 10 quarter point rate cuts to zero. 300 pypl.
"Even if vaccine is available, PYPL is a great stock. Buy and relax."
Great job pypl holders and longs... Was tough esp in February. Now we all know path of pypl. Future 200+ billion market cap.
Feels like a green day?
Lets go paypal ! Good luck longs
Shocked...but time to buy
looking for 10 percent
BUY MORE ON DIP 's the new RULE OF INVESTMENT THIS TIME....AS ECONOMY FOR SURE WILL RECOVER SOON....
Let’s hold $80! Be a great way to end the week.
Anyone buy the dip?
PYPL for the long haul! I love you!
"Align also announced after hours and crushed it. It's down too, there are a lot of ""investors"" betting on bad news versus what's coming out. I'm really feeling bad for them. But I'll feel much better tomorrow when these stock start the upward trend."
Very bullish! $PYPL
"OK say you receive $1000 check from Uncle Sam, but you cannot shop physically, so what will you do? Cash the check then transfer to your PayPal app to shop online."
"Q4s have been golden for PayPal for YEARS. Today, we'll close around the 84.70 mark and when the earnings are announced (and they will be good), we'll pop about 6-8% after hours. Tomorrow (Thursday) we'll crack 89.00, perhaps 90.00 before settling back to a close around $87.50$200 by end of year. No. $125-$130 by EOY, yeah, I can see that easily."
We've artificially reached Guggenheim’s Jeff Cantwell magic $104 price range. What’s the next fake news?
Back to 300. Blue skies ahead longs. All these trash talkers are going to get bars of soap put in their mouths once PYPL is done rallying.
Why is this stock down.
"uber up 8%, paypal stock up 0.3%.. seriously??:D"
they are confident their revenue will grow stronger than expected. buying more
"Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Xmax, post-Xmas all coming....may be the low point of the season for PYPL and a good buying op."
buy all dips. this is a fed backed one way market!!!
Don’t understand why people are all worked up over the eBay thing. PayPal has grown out of EBay. It’s time for Paypal to sign an exclusive deal with a company that will bring them big revenue
Bitcoin came back UP!PYPL GOING UP!!!!
"added 100 more shares at the open, paypal is still to cheap"
Very low volume (1/3 of average volume)!!! Buying opportunity!!!
How are you doing shortie? $LULU $AMZN $W $SHOP $CMG $OKTA $NFLX $AAPL $QQQ $JD $BA $TWLO $PYPL $TSLA
"I sold SQ today in the $77 range hoping to buy PYPL,but y'all ran it up to high for me now. :("
back on track! I love it! good luck everyone!
Partnership announced with American Express. AMEX users will now be able to receive and use AMEX rewards points through PayPal.
This looks good.
As more vaccines roll out ...more jobs will boost economy greatly like before the pandemic....Today 's jobless report is nothing...as vaccinated people need 4 weeks to fully immunity....buy on this DIP is a gift....
US liabilities vastly exceed assets. How can US be solvent?
"Which one better, PYPL or MA??"
The overreaction to guidance which is 1% lower than before. This too because Paypal's growth is overwhelming their ability to consolidate it.
Has anybody done the calculation on what PYPL's forward p/e ratio looks like with the new earnings data and forecasts?
If ebay was well run it would be Amazon. Meg Whitman is most over rated CEO ever and it looks like she left a few turds in her wake. Now she is on the board of PG causing me troubles there
"Any thoughts on ebay starting their own financial arm once again, dumping Paypal ?"
"For those of you who recently bought in the $270-$300 range please know that you will see that price again. Why. Because and despite the bellowings of the Bears on this board PayPal has proven its staying power. For example the bleating Bears point out the $50 price drop but fall to mention that if you had bought at the end of January you would be up near $25 a share. So, be patient and you will be rewarded."
"Ok so some info... I bought in at an average of 186. The RSI when I bought was at about a 32. I was trying to time my line when it kissed the bottom threshold of the bollinger band. I got in where I wanted to, and was a bit shocked it dropped to a RSI of about a 20 at one point. Right now the RSI is about a 45. I am pretty confident that next week we will see some peaks over 200, but expect a few days of sub 200 close realistically. From this point, I am expecting a 2 week window to at least a 20 pct upside though, pending any crazy news. Granted, if there is some huge news that comes out, it's all out the window. I feel like TSLA will sell off bad next week, and those funds will filter into other Tech plays, hopefully Fintech. :)"
"We may have a few more days to buy PYPL, After new year, I guess PYPL will flirt around 78. It is time to build the base around 75-77."
"If you think about it, PYPL could still be heavily undervalued. Its stock price had reached $120 as far back as July of last year. It swooned for months and took until Feb 2020 to retake the $120 level and set a new high of around $124 before the covid 19 thing hit. Given the shift toward electronic currency, covid 19 should prove to be positive catalyst for PYPL. So forget about the old high of $124, tack 15%-20% on top of that to get a feel for where the new highs will be set."
Looks like we’re going to test new highs this week. Come on $220.
I think its up a buck and a half Thursday
Going to $300+
"This is a great buying opportunity ,buy PYPL, Visa. For the long haul."
gawdaaaaaaamn what a beat! Congrats longs!
"My very limited stock market experience tells me that nothing has changed for PYPL. The company is still on a very good track. All the fundamentals are in place, with no change, but only improvements in earnings and in containing costs. Since there's a war over the dollar, there are some currency headwinds to deal with but, overall, nothing has fundamentally changed for PYPL. Some consolidation, and then a move back up within a few months."
"Every time a person makes a buy or sell of a cryptocurrency through PYPL, they pocket $0.50 per transaction. What if they allow for more crypto choices to be transacted beyond the 4 currently... I don't think PYPL has ever had this kind of revenue generated before. Let it soak in for a minute... $0.50 per click to buy and sell crypto! I wish I had more shares..."
Who buys when PYPL is down 1.50 is the winner today./
global economic collapse in progress. massive rate cuts in the offing. buy and be confident says all banks.
PYPL was the first stock I ever bought back in May for 1500 shares. This is my baby. I’m not going anywhere. Thank you for the gift of another 1500 shares at 75
"Gave you PYPl at $35, now buy IIIV ! IIIV projects FY19 adj eps of .79-.81c , SQ projects FY18 adj eps .39-.41c"
PYPL is resuming its uptrend from here. Still Bullish.
"PYPL really needs physical credit card in order to create the complete ecosystem, just one more step that PYPL needs to encourage the customers to use it (incentive). I have confidence that PYPL will decimate the bank card and eventually AXP, AXP will be decimated because it is only used by the big corporation. The merchants avoid it because of the expensive cost. Another avenue will be with AMZN, which I think BEZOS SAYS NO."
"VENMO my bank account, Don please. Just do it, come out with PAYPAL credit card with VENMO logo. I think PAYPAL has enough BRAND power to come out with credit card. I believe PAYPAL can beat DISCOVER easily, then compete with AXP first then V and MA. BRAND POWER I think PAYPAL or VENMO both are good."
ATH incoming....
300$+ stock under 250$Is a jokeBuy buy buy
It seems like solid earnings were priced in across the board on these big tech stocks...
"Starting to feel like groundhogs day, tickles $80-81, ends at $79/$78.. sigh"
"I'm hesiting between Paypal and MSFT for my first LT investment, any suggestion ?"
Wow...down another 0.98 after hours to 81.16
How PYPL is not above $100. The revenue and earning is around V and M. Hard to believe
Keep the good and steady momentum going PYPL!!
"I keep waiting for ""Red"" market days to buy more PYPL on a pullback. However, PYPL is always green. I guess the only way to get it to pullback, is when I buy. Works every time."
New 52 week highs incoming
all longs have bought. banks now stepping up their sales of PYPL's stock into dip buyers. Baggies get ready for sub 75
I believe even at these levels PYPL trades at a steep discount to its future potential value. Given the growth we have seen in SQ I would expect PYPL to catch up eventually. Plus PYPL is sustainable even after the vaccines are completely rolled out. It is both a reopening play and a COVID play. I fully expect this to trade above $300 by the midpoint of this year.
Several resistance levels smashed today. We are certainly seeing the long awaited breakout to 250. It is nice to have some affirmation that one’s analysis and charts are relatively accurate. I still believe a $300 pps is attainable within 6-8 months driven primarily by PYPLs recent adapations to fintech trends.
Interesting. Looks like an entire head and shoulders pattern formed and completed during a single trading session today. Should be upside from here.
i wish i had bought tesla today instead of paypal. am unlucky
"Long on paypal, will but no matter how far this drop goes"
Third Point says this stock is going to $125. Still cheap.
Good time to buy at dip.99% to beat the earning by FOOL Analysis team.
Do I hear $2.80 for $TEUM ? We will have take off soon. Don’t miss it!!!
Was waiting for an entry point... just bougut some at 284!
Guess my $80 by Friday call is not looking too good.
This $8 dropped looks nice to scoop up. won't last long. already curving around.
visa is better than paypal

"Schulman and Rainey cashed out 20000 - 30000 shares recently between 260 - 304. Very surprising. They were caught out once 3 years ago, Schulman sold at 110 and Rainey 114. They boss himself thinks PYPL is overpriced? Cathy Wood certainly strongly disagree. Fintech expert vs company supremo, who is right?"
"Hurry up, buy it before it reverses."
(http://sharelabs.xyz) just alerted me to an awesome runner before the bell.
Looks like PYPL is set to make a strong move upwards. Lots of big Funds putting it on its radar along with the whole Fintech sector. Think we break $100 in the near future.
Been long for some time but...........Something is not right at PYPL because this stock should be following suite with SQ. Upgrades are there but it doesn't move.Management is completely mum and Venmo has no clear direction as to what to be. If the CEO & the rest of mgmt languishes with indecisions Venmo will soon be a flavor of the past..........rather frustrated with management's lack of clear direction and innovative ideas
Good for all those that held on. The negativity on these boards normally takes care of itself. Hoping SQ can follow positive as well.
I think the Honey acquisition will be fantastic. Real threat to Amazon and they know it or they wouldn't be telling people to be afraid of Honey.
Run Forest...run!!!
17% in three days ?
Explain how PYPL can operate in China against Alibaba and we chat?
Thanks to whoever turned the Algorithm back on.
"EBay just reported they are dropping PayPal as their financial partner as of 2-14-21 and will be doing it through eBay management, this can only hurt PayPal in the near and long term because eBay is a major major partner whom they dependedl on ! just wanted to inform you before the news hits the wire, and you take a hit on the stock ,"

I wrote the same thing on SQ’s forum.. Check out BFT/ Paysafe.. I own all three but BFT doesn’t have the expensive valuations of SQ and PayPal. Ground floor that I got into two weeks ago.. Glta
Here's betting we hit $200 within 18 months.
"As a new investor, less than 10 years. It STILL surprises me that ONE person's opinion can mean the difference between 1 Billion - 5 Billion. Do people honestly think there is no inside deals, bribes or other things NOT happening?It is insane. How are there not laws against this?"
$120 on its way
One step forward... two steps back. Come join me in the Cryptocurrency market. The stock market is a waste of time anymore with Wall Street stepping up the manipulation to make back the billions they lost from new retail investors.
"Bond tumbles, it is good for the stock market. Wait for the market settles another day or two, it should be for PYPL and UNH. High earnings growth rate and high revenue growth rate both."
Speed matters... a lot
"Just bought 1,200 shares on today 's dip as it's hard to see at this screaming price / very cheap....as the train 's about leaving the station soon in no time today ...and far away from tomorrow...."
Is it still a good time to get a position here?
Buy Buy Buy PYPL they still have good growth for many years
Good time to buy back shares?
Pull back is just an opportunity with this stock...
PayPal just banned me for life today so I don't think I really like the stock anymore
Will eBay’s Earnings effect PayPal tomorrow? Thoughts?
So .....market is being a B
Cramer said PYPL 's a BUY....
Pypl is Tesla of payment arena. Review earnings report and their new partnerships. fyi international relationships - awesome
"Tax cut is just like Salsa or dips, PYPL itself has 35-40 % earning growth rate in the next 3-4 quarters. Top line is also high. I don't think it will tank again. Big boys just rob your share when you should stay still. If PYPL can close under 3 points today, I think by next week ADBE will crank the market for tech. Don't forget Dec 14, ADBE will surge around 6-9% because the top line beats estimate and earnings growth around 45% should be enough for the stock to surge higher. PE is around 45 this year and 25 next year. PYPL has the potential like ADBE and has the parabola chart."
TSNP $.021 is streaking up...The newest Mobile payment platform that partnered with Humble last week...Will be taking market share from PayPal and Venmo...A chance to get in on the ground floor...Led by former Fortune 500 CEO...this will triple by next week!
just bought more PYPL at $66.50. Good earnings report out Thursday
"Bitcoin compatibility seems to not be priced in, so its a go @242"
Take whatever the market maker gives me now. I like the index is green and PYPL is red.
"I've had a position in PYPL for a while, but I'm now shifting to Humbl(Ticker: TSNP), way ahead, and already has everything Schulman mentioned in the last article. PYPL should try to acquire Humbl. In the meantime, I will continue investing in Humbl. You guys should check it out."
"Once Paypal puts iZettle to the metal ( once the settlement is complete ) Paypal will soar leaving you Squares Jerry, behind in the dust "
Preparing for sell-off whiplash. Doubling down in pre-market. Yesterdays sellers will be very regretful at close today!
For the people who say that Paypal P/E is too high now. Look at Amazon's P/E in the past 6 years. From 2015 to 2018 it was all above 100. The stock price has surged rapidly and the P/E has also decreased. I believe something similar will happen to Paypal.
"PayPal is for investors, Square is for traders."
Is this a short term blip or do we start to sell NOW?
after hours is all smoke and mirrors / it’s all depends on what the institutions do at opening
Closing in on the 52 week high.......
It needs a total wash out to bring back interest. I'm guessing a sell off tomorrow A.M. to maybe 203 ish...then it will head back to 300 over the next couple months.As far as I can tell I'm the most EXPIERENCE on this board. I'm here to help
I'm starting to see alot more small businesses using clover instead of square and they accept paypal. paypal should buy them to fend off square. Ebay issue is a non issue. Nothing is set in stone with ebay anyway and paypal has the upper hand when the time comes to renegotiate. btw ebay was the weak link in that partnership. The opportunities for paypal is endless and brighter with or without ebay. So don't be scared to load up for easy money.
"No matter the call, the analysts did not like the buying spree - overpaying for questiinable assets- which now puts pressure on earnings in near term."
I see 80+ by next week. Estimate earnings will be over 3.25 by next year. Am I right.
All I have to say is when pay pal pops the sky's the limit I'm a strong believer and pay pal been dealing with for years One day you'll wake up and you'll be rich God-bless pay pal in the unions
I can’t remember the last time I paid for anything with cash. Actually- when i get my hair cut once a month. That’s it though￼
Numbers are very strong year over year
"Lets have some fun , 10 years from now in 2028, what do you believe the price of paypal will be? Wild guess but I say $700."
"it is the perfect spot for PYPL to move up in the next 2 weeks. I guess PYPL will move higher to around 78 teasing around the high, when when earnings report comes out then we will have firework because the big momentum from black Friday and Cyber Monday."
Big bounce once this bottoms. 145 puts are paying off nicely!
buy any dip. feds will support.
isn't telling us
PayPal boom!!!And grow up another 9%!!!!Gonna be a good day
"Year end tax selling ,and other negatives CV19,20 tump."
This is a $300 stock.
Nice to see PYPL finally moving North. I don't know how this hasn't broken out earlier in the past month or so. I love Pay Pal.
"Meh, I'm not convinced that this stock is going to make a run anytime soon. Would be nice since I own some. But, I'm not so sure here. SQ looks more poised for a run here. Also got some of that. We'll see."
whales/banks that bought well below 100 are quietly unloading above 100....quietly telling retail to buy. just ask bears sterns kramer.
"compared to square paypal is relatively cheaper given its size, customer base, analyst sentiments, and strong financials."
Whispers of PayPal working partnership with Facebook as soon as able to 2020 summer. Read up on it.Will be huge for both stocks.
pay pal can stand on its own
"Highest Close ever. Portends a new high soon. Maybe Wednesday; maybe later; but the odds are extremely good for a new all time high anyway here. Stocks that make new highs ""generally"" continue to make more new highs, and on and on and on. We are finally on the precipice of a new leg in this 2 year rally! IMHO"
"Repurchased 23.6 million shares of common stock, returning $1.83 billion to stockholders"
another tiny volume day 52 week high. only banks are buying here (then selling end of day).

"Those who choose to trade this stock will regret it. This is a ""buy-and-hold"". Getting in and out will only increase the chance that it will take off and leave the traders behind. I learned many years ago that trying to take small profits has always been a huge mistake in the long run. If you like a stock, just get on board and ride it up. Don't let the little corrections scare you out; that's when you should be buying more. Just think of the poor guy who bought BRK.A at $20 and took a ""huge"" profit at $200. It's now around $300,000/shr!!! That $180 profit looked sweet at the time. 100 shares bought at $20 in 1965 would be worth nearly $30,000,000 today. I'm not saying that PYPL is the next BRK.A, but it could be the next big winner."
I am on Board with WilliamI suspect a $20 jump up once we confirm the break-out above $80 that we have all been waiting for.
$QCOM $PYPL Report FABRICATED Revenues to offset tomorrow's JOBLESS Claims. The US Government transfers billions of dollars to these companies and these scam companies Book these under table cash as revenues.Enjoy the MASSIVE STOCK BUBBLE!!!
This should end in green..Earning estimates have been greatStocks hold Zacks#1 (strong buy)Online payment is booming..Buy on this dip...
closed up 4 aces......nice
Paypa P/E seems high but this will decrease with shares repurchase and accelerating profits after each earning report while stock price increase. Btw Paypal uses 30-40 of the free cash flow for shares repurchase.
There we go!
PayPal rocks
Tomorrow earnings from PayPal and Facebook after market close. should be exciting.
"Okay, I wasn't clear........ Hold above $78!"
"great opportunity to buy at 76. loaded up a little too early at 76.50, sold off other stocks to buy in, add more to sq too. we will see 78-80 next week"

more then double my money
"a little profit taking is good. consolidate, give buyers a chance to get in, moving average baseline adjustment, and continue the momentum."
"Home Prices Crash 8.8%, And Banks Struggle To Find Buyers For Their Debt"

Holding at this level for so long is astonishing! I just can’t figure who or what is holding this back from running. Qual cosa non va!
Big news about to pop this gem to the $120 range ........
Dan Lobe’s Starlight Capital takes new stake in PYPL
Believe in it
The company plans to heavily invest in its future purchasing bolt on companies. They are a mini Apple with accumulating cash to buy other companies. They approved a very large stock buy back program. I think with what is going on with FINTECH the future is bright for Paypal. I heard someone compare PayPal as one of the future FANG replacements.
Paypal rocks.
Strong Buy https://cweb.com/paypal-scores-a-2-2-billion-purchasing-izettle/
"Get ready for another amazing earning report. We should be well on the road to over $280 by end of next week. PayPAL will soon be the next crypto purse for all levels of investors and exchange platform of choice, yet that is only secondary to its sky rocketing acceptance."
Just curious how there could possibly be a lawsuit against this company for lost value. I've owned it since the spin off and have more than doubled my equity. What exactly are these ambulance chasers complaining about!
That’s what happens when your doing so well they set the bar super high. We met and still drops absolutely insane
As I write here over 2 weeks ago Paypal is firing on all cylinders.... onward and upward .... we’re gonna blaze past $100 and beyond this coming week .... and leave all the rest running for cover
If Amazon beats expectation by a big margin then we can expect Paypal also doing so. Even though Amazon doesn't support Paypal it is still a good indicator of how E-commerce has performed.
"Good luck, waiting on $260 and beyond I love using PayPal."
That’s interesting Guggenheim downgraded it to a neutral they’re putting it on the sidelines
"When it was $189 I got to admit I almost covered, UNTIL I came in here and read 100 consecutive posts claiming it was “going to $200”. Right to $181 like clockwork"
"talking about the chart: in the past each new high outpassed the previous high,.. we are not at this point right now and the frame can't be better right now. Honey will bee independent in a few years, as well as honey, traders is already and they have huge of upside potential. They could just implement traders in Europe,... you think it would be hard? I think it wouldn't.. Ebay`s website is old as **** and not very appealing anymore"
Anyone buying crypto on PayPal￼ ?
reason for the dip?
Ti.e to start buying again. This stock seems to climb on steps.
"PYPL should be up, at the rate things are going with Covid, we'll all be home more ordering things on line and paying with Pay Pal or some other on line payment."
"reaching new ath, sold off a little this morning, will rally higher all week"
dsmn...this #$%$ went to 76.68!!! glad I shifted more to paypal yesterday
This market has a crooked mind. Penalty on guidance ? It was a darn good qtr. and personally I don't have any problem with their guidance. It seems the same institutions who hold PYPL stock are the ones punishing it. I don't trust any analysts or institutions.
My Square is a much better company not even close $190 to $280 in like a week
"Bouncing back.....PYPL CEO: surge in April demand numbers were good, trend is accelerated"
Up 30k and I don't want my profits to get shorted. Looking to sell tomorrow if things turn down. Can't catch a break here. going to have to watch closely.
commin' in hot on 200B cap.
Thumbs up if you use PayPal frequently and haven’t bought anything on eBay in the last two years. Thumbs down if you buy on eBay and will switch to another payment service.
"It's tuning up, volume is high...Good sign!"
"Guys, check BFT (merging with Paysafe next month), probably the hottest SPAC out there right now. It’s trading currently at 13.92, make sure you don’t miss the boat."
Personally I am excited that paypal is entering crypto markets. I’ve been looking into some sleepers like CCX coin. Anyone have suggestions?
"i have a really good feeling with PYPL going into earnings today! with venmo and other partnerships getting into the numbers, plus lots of bullish analyst feeback! big changes coming!"
"You all realize you can still use PayPal through Adyen, right?Thats a win-win for PayPal, getting out of the deal that excludes potential future agreements/partners while still being an option through the future ebay default processor."
"#PYPL #TSNPBOOM - I can't post the link but just copy and paste this headline and read for yourself. LFG!!!""PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second-largest internet market."""
"I’m not just looking at this ER... even if it’s little low, the outlook is looking great. This, Disney, and BAC are three I plan to hold for at least few years."
Nice watching kicking off into 300sLet us do it
"BABA, one trillion market cap 's down -4 % in pretrading today, which will pull the market at the open down at the opening...."
PayPal is the next trillion dollar company. Not Tesla. Bet.
"I like MC and Visa but Paypal is also a great stock to hold. If you buy products across countries, Paypal is the only payment system you can use and still have some guarantee you won't be ripped off. You can't get this with bank transfers and most companies don't accept Visa or MC if they don't have a store. This is an opportunity to buy right now."
Yet another all time high. Well done Danny Boy!

"I just bought some, they are gonna crush earnings."
"Ummm, yeah about tomorrow morning "
Part of this is a struggle between the old corrupt institutions and the new age of commerce and banking. The day is coming when companies like Paypal will trump old world banking.
"am paying a lot to chinese companies and used PayPal a lot, you know what: the fee is high but the service is so good that I would never change to an alternative. The app is simple to use and I hope that we can soon pay more with PayPal in different stores! great thing"
"These bearish posts are essentially comical and ignorant. Guess these types of promotors said AMZN was a bubble when it went from 30 to 300; now at 1700 and climbing. Naysayers are jealous they missed out on big moves and can't believe companies (and their stocks) can continue climbing as they grow. The more they squad about the downside, the more we should be convinced the rally will continue. When they toss in the towel and buy these stocks, then it would be time to consider a top is forming. From the tenure of their comments, we have a lot more room to run on the upside. PYPL could easily be a 500 - 1000 stock several years down the road; not this year, not next year, but certainly in 2020-2022. Let's wait for PUTIN and his wannabees to capitulate and buy the stock; they will likely be buying mine several several hundred dollars higher than where it is today. IMHO"
Solid price action today. Slow and steady to $100 a share.
Most under valued asset of all time is silver. Silver is also currency.
Paid $85/shr for this at end of March & plan to hold it for 10+ years. This is nothing. I’d happily buy more in the 160’s.
"PYPL should split their stock, Look what happened to Apple and Telsa stock. Both up big time any thoughts"
Buy the dip
Cramer now screaming to buy pypl after a massive run up and extreme valuation. lol! the top is in. distribution time.
"Down Nasdaq day, PYPL held gains from yesterday. Great base forming here.Money will be spent, PYPL will be doing the transactions. Very happy here to be holding for a sweet run up this year.GLA"
that's a good looking cup
"very positive start, let`s see where it is on friday"
"SHEP. HERE.............................. If you have a large profit in Paypal and hope to leave it to your children someday, be aware that the D's want to take away the STEPPED UP BASIS of assets that are passed on when you die. As it is now, you children can sell your stocks when you die and owe no tax, but under the idea the D's have (and if they get the two Senate position in Georgia that will be able to do it) they will make your heirs pay the tax based on what your cost was."
This stock will plump back to 50
Walmart deal will help boost Paypal subscribers also.
"Down the road this company will be liable for lawsuits with the way these guys are talking. Don't forget folks the company MISSED revenue and they are acting like PayPal is taking over the world. These are supposed to be company leaders, not used car lot salesmen. They are an embarrassment imo."
This stock is a beast!! So glad I'm in. Going to be an exciting year.
"Restaurants (big 4), #EOSE, #SQ, #QS, #PYPL all doing nicely today, besides #GBTC, and butcoin."
"Buy on the rumor, sell on the news. Typical reaction is that PYPL stock runs up to earnings and then pulls back after earnings are announced. When this selloff bottoms it will make a good entry point to start a position or add to an existing position. The only thing I saw wrong was that PYPL grew at 24% this quarter and 25% last quarter. Market overreacting to this. Also, stock buyback makes no sense. There has to be better uses of capital in a growth company. If current mgt can't find better uses, than its time for new mgt."
"Seems like every time we continue to hit a new milestone $50, $60, $70 we trade sideways for a while, consolidate, then make our trek up to the next milestone aka $80. I think the consolidation will be shorter this time and the trek up quicker to $80 IMHO"
Twitter’s Dorsey subpoenaed over censorship. Sell SQ. buy PYPL.
Uh oh.... PYPL over $300!
Why the drop
Amazing quarter - raising guidance. Absolutely worth buying on any dips and I will do so promptly tomorrow
let`s go
"$SQ and $PYPL are down today because FB launched it’s payment solution. This is a background noise. I’m long both payment companies - we will be fine, as it would be insane to trust your  and payment transactions to FB  GLTL"
why is it going up today?
Maybe PayPal can fix the issue of leaving ebay
"Dave, the president is an actor. You know this, yes?"
PayPal should buyouts STNE while it’s still in infancy
"Nothing can help us, FUNDS HAVE ON SET ON 190.They will drive this down with everything they got."
Anybody have an opinion on PayPal’s investing in Uber?
100 dollars is coming very soon easy
"Love the way you do me, PYPL!!!"
where are the bad news? don't see any... only cause whole market is down??
PYPL CRUSHED 4th Quarter Earnings!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"First off, the whole market is down lol why panic?? The market goes up and down."
just seen a commercial had to check it out
taking bets on earnings. Up 30% is my guess.
The birds are chirping and the flowers are blooming................!
PYPL bought back 2.590 mil shares. They will give it back to employees as stock options
"I am numb from my tech losses past 2 days and it took a lot of restraint not to press the sell button but maybe things are getting oversold so I bought more shares of PYPL, SQ, NVDA, CRM, SE, AMZN, DOCU & MSFT."
"Anybody know what % of PYPL's sales are with EBAY? I don't see a problem here. Anybody that uses PYPL on EBAY now, will continue to do so. It's way overblown."
$90 on Friday
We will hit $80 by Tuesday or before gang. Please be ready :)
"Surely this company would perform extremely well during the black Friday, cyber Monday, thanks giving and Christmas with everyone almost being forced to buy online due to coronavirus."
This will probably be green by noontime
A bit too rich on the valuation side here and would love to know how many users have maxed out there PayPal credit without an ability to pay. They raised credit loss reserves by $237 million but will it be enough? No position currently but have a hard time believing this will go much higher.
Looking like a cup and handle formation in the making.
anyone got in to GRWG wow what stock
10 billion in stock repurchase planned and SQ is in our blind spot?..........
PYPL will break $100 this week..
Just a curious question. Since CRM and PYPLs CEOs seem to be close business partners. Could a possible BO of PYPL by CRM be in the books down the road. Like i said just curious. I am a owner of PYPL shares just for the record.thanks
New deal with Bitflyer! https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/78279/bitflyer-europe-paypal-integration
Some more statistics to put PYPL bears into an even further tailspin: PYPL has $13 billion in cash and short term investments and $5 billion free cash flow. These numbers will only grow over time but right now they are at perfectly respectable levels. $13 billion in cash is no joke.
Venmo. Kick the Shlt out of Visa and MC vastly overinflated interchange model. Brick and mortar merchants would love this.

PYPL till i retire.. may just keep it so i can still watch it blast off.
"After hours means nothing, guarantee it's up tomorrow after big money is satisfied with a solid entry point and the weak sell on fear. Venmo will be huge for this company!"
"don't close your eyes , because tomorrow is the future , lets goo to 375$"
anyone that has followed pypl can see a stock that will be supported and increased no matter what. all dips are bought and the stock is protected from sell offs. buy buy buy. new high nearly everyday for weeks.

Are these earnings bad?? They seem good to me...
"great way to end the week. To all my paypal friends, stockstradamus, trey, and og skywalker have a good weekend"
A must read for PYPL traders https://lussosnews.com/is-paypal-pypl-the-future/
"In late December, I posted a 6 month price target of $120 for PYPL. As it turns out, we needed about 2 weeks longer than I thought to hit $120. I thing the move is played out now and it is a good time to write out of the money calls on PYPL. GLTA"
The iZettle acquisition news just confirms the posting l made here 13 days ago.... just proving : all great things are worth waiting for !
"Hmmm, thinking of adding paypal to my portfolio if it drops into the 170's. Bad idea?"
$215 - $178 in a weekWhat’s that gain longs?Going back to $25Too many choices now to pay.
boom
So I bought back into Paypal yesterday. Hopefully 77.77 was a lucky purchase price.
anyone knows why we just popped in the after hours
Just bought 300 shares!!! Why not. Life is short but I’m long on PayPal .
"As an SQ investor, i missed out the cheap $30 shares this past march lows, i got in at a mid $100 unfortunately. Now that paysafe is coming to the market here under the SPAC ticker $BFT, this is an amazing opportunity that I dont want to miss out, i bet you dont want to either, check it out, they fall in the same category as $SQ and $PYPL"
There has been a lot of pumping on this stock and not much action. One hedge fund guy and all of a sudden people listen. i guess he backed it up with cash
"If I can't use paypal when checking out I go to another online seller. Same as the days of ebay, if they didn't offer paypal it was a scammer. Im adding as much as I can afford because after the discount it's still my biggest % gainer."
"we think that this is going to be a very manageable transition over a multiple years post the end of OA, the OA, the operating agreement, also restricts PayPal from partnering with the largest and fastest growing market places in the world as an MOR. So, we’ve simply done an extension of the full operating agreement that would keep that prohibition in place and prevented us from becoming a fully neutral third-party platform. And the opportunity to partner with the world largest market places is immense."
Everyone who’s taking profits right now will regret it soon.
wow paypal!! great stock
If you scroll down to 3 days ago I wrote on here that the stock looks like it is about to break out big time. And I don’t use no stinking charts :))
It's holding
"I have many friends and only one pal, Paypal."
Why didn't the analysts say anything when the stock moved upto 215?
Obviously “Big” is spreading FUD about PYPL 20 posts daily because he’s trying to get the price lower so he can buy in. Hang on to your precious shares
$277-27510% off for PYPLI will buy more.
"If this opens down tomorrow i'm doubling my position again. I have a feeling it will be up though, but i sure hope it's down. Anything under 184 is a buy for me."
The volatility in the AF is unreal. This market is very nervous.
PayPal primed for $100. Grow and teumUp. Great day :)
I am lmao  
I’m seeing 944k after hours volume. Is that right? It seems high.
"Paypal up 15% and ebay down 10% since that ""dreaded"" split. I can only guess but I imagine a high percentage of buyers still use paypal there. Ebay running that giant sale last week brought in millions in revenue and potentially many future buyers there. They won't be making a profit on that but paypal still gets their commission. Email I just got from paypal is pointing out that they are removing seller protection on transactions where a customer pays without using paypal. If the customer uses a credit card/guest checkout sellers aren't protected. Essentially, require a paypal account on all your listings or set yourself up to be screwed. Ebay's paypal replacement is years away. Seems like ebay shot themselves in the foot here and paypal asserted it's leverage."
$MARA taking off on BTC news.
It's tanking
The best acquisition for PYPL would be IIIV who guides FY19 adj eps of between .79-.81c whereas SQ projects FY18 between .39-.41 adj eps.
"I worked for PayPal for over 16 years and while I expect good numbers after market close, I'm more concerned with the 'wording' that often accompanies the report. Can't tell you how many times the CEO/CFO reported great earnings only to cause the stock to stagger by issuing ""cautious future statements""."
"I’ve traded $PYPL and SQUARE in the past.Just started trading long options on PYPL .No 1 wonder why ETSY Price was up like 7-8PTS today.IMO, PYPL could swing to 200-205 tomorrow... Maybe it will have a 30pt run up in this market, esp.“BEST QTR ... YEAR SINCE ITS IPO”MAYBE , its undervalued as a transaction - FINTECH- stock.I think this EPS A D FWD GUIDANCE was EXCEPTIONAL!And those fwd guidance comments about Covid is n will permanently change ‘Fintech’ payment structure...and in general going fwd this Fintech - e-commerce WILL CONTINUE to further rely on this platform . IMO, from what I gather the COVID Situation ‘jump-started’ this fwd trajectory into system people will continue to grow PYPLY , due to ease of use n also once a consumer develops a habit / routine with ease, timeliness n efficacy... they will continue with what works!!IMO, PYPL, there could be an underlying positive issue. PYPL will prob rise after ETSY, EBAY WAYFAIR, and transactional platforms will prob cause PYLY to rise after their Upcoming EPS’s .... IMO it should be trading around 200 - 210 - easily I think the EPS / FWD Guidance/ CC were just too positive... just my rant lol"
What time is earning call? Uk
"Wondering if Paypal's license in China will allow it to ""piggyback"" reciprocal partners? For example, could Visa and Mastercard use their limited partnerships with Paypal as a wedge into China? Would the Chinese government be more amenable to having one licensee (Paypal) it can better monitor than to have four to eight foreign payment and financial companies that it has to try to continuosly review? Just a thought!"
PayPal will advise how Walmart should do to compete with Amazon. This is really bad for Amazon. Stay tuned.

"After years paypal finally embraces bitcoin....finally, was a long time coming, riot and mara will soar off this development.go uxin solo trxc zi"
The value in PYPL is in its financial platform and business models for future growth. IT SHOULD NOT BE HINGED TO CRYPTO! Apparently Robin-hood traders believe they are owning a piece of Bitcoin based on.highly misleading articles and Crammer rants. Get it straight and get it back on track1
"Amd was trading at 52 week high . Shares went up . Why this PayPal can’t go up , it puzzles me"
"Paypal holding up extremely well in this climate among its peers ( visa, MasterCard and Square ) .....with its solid fundamentals Paypal is the best place to plant your money and watch it grow!"
Excellent interview with the CEO and CFO on mad money yesterday. Projections are 10 billion free cash flow in the future double the current cash flow.
"Algorithms signaling another possible 15% retrace. I took some shares off the books yesterday in expectation, which I rarely do. Pre-market is solidifying the move. Hold or sell, all depends on your investing strategy."
Good volume confirming the higher move. This will be a $125 stock shortly

Hold up pretty well in this market
Good day. Nice gain.
"just remember, PayPal is sitting on a pile of cash, and acquisitions, if anything goes wrong they have buybacks to keep propelling the company. Compared to square, which doesn't"
Looking at volume and price action today we can surely say tha someone leaked the earnings...Don't doubt me!
C'mon PYPL you need to Break through that freakin $80!

BREAKOUT out of long term resistance. Should be clear sailing to 110 - 120.
PayPal becomes the first foreign payment platform to be licensed to provide online payment services in China.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3502666-paypal-enters-china
Once we take out the 52 week high the stock will fly.

PYPL still waiting for my dividend! Where is it?
Should be above $270 this week...as Tech comeback ...
Wake up papal wake up-!!
"What ever has happened to LarrytheLegend... you know, the legend in his own puke??? He must be shivering under some bridge somewhere, licking his wounds as his belovedly pumped SQ has now lost over 18% in 6 days, as it hurtles back south to $200. Guess he’s gone back to his regular job of cleaning toilets"
Jeff Cantwell downgraded PYPL but upgraded SQ back in May. $SQ will print $150 before $PYPL
"It's amazing how much better these comments sections are when we MUTE a few of the irrational naysayers (ie, Shorts) who desperately need to see this go down for no reason."
My barber has concluded pypl is worth 400 and has started pypl with a super strong buy with a go all in bias.
"Internet sales have been hot, PayPal might break above $80 this week."
Did you miss the train folks.....?????hope not...
PYPL is facing increased competition for big players such as AAPL with their new credit card and the way that AAPL has structured it to keep the users on line and locked into their payment processes. There is more of this coming which could chip away at PYPL over time. My love is starting to fade for this stock even though I have done well with it over the past few years. Selling down about half of my holdings.
Only down six after the ER and the Tech Wrech today was amazing. We’re going higher amigos !
I’m no pro just another keyboard warrior but this coupled with the bearish sentiment will probably affect the price. But the reality is that PayPal will probably buy up most of the shares anyway.
First it was UBER Now its honey. Oh dear!
"Last week, I mentioned here that the upward move in PYPL appeared to be over and suggested selling call options on long positions. I was bullish on PYPL since I posted a 6 month price target of $120 in December. I was obviously correct about the move to $120, and I think the earnings report pretty much validated my current strategy."
new highs end of day. 115 on tap.
"Fintech is coming of age, only sped up by the pandemic. This company will continue to deliver Amazon-like returns for the next 20 years. Five-year lookout is but a blip on the radar of the long-term growth story. Keep adding incrementally/holding, you will crush the market."

"Donnie Pugatch, has doubled his positionin PYPL!"
Too hard to hold this down!
One thing people aren’t talking about... EPS .55 a share and this EPS is 19 cents a share HIGHER than any other quarter reported. Why is this significant? Because we are in a new level of earnings growth. Hard to understand why analysts aren’t pointing this out?
This needs to get back in the nineties!
Why would anyone buy PYPL when you can buy my Square (bought at $7)
let us see how this will run up tomorrow!!!!
buying more...
Anyone think we could hit 2hundro today?
All time high and really just getting started. Once you are over $100 you are in a different class. Investors have more respect for you. Onwards and upwards amigos. :))
2% gain on PayPal and sold part of GROW today at a 10% gain. Great day!!!!!!!
anyone buying more PYPL today?
Hopefully the conference call will bring it up
FAKE moved down....should be UP FAST HIGHER soon this week....
"WHY IS THIS DOWN. MAYBE BECAUSE BILL READY IS LEAVING? GOOD RIDDENCE. THEY WILL REPLACE HIM WITH SOMEONE BETTER. EVERYONE STATES HOW SMART HE WAS FOR FINDING VEMNO BUT THEY CAN FIND SOMEONE BETER WHO CAN MAKE VEMNO PROFIT. ALL BILL READY DID WAS MAKE IT GROW IN VOLUME SO GOOD RIDDENCE TO BILL READY, THEY CAN FIND AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT PROFITABLE BECAUSE BILL READY JUST WASTED PAY PALS TIME"
core inflation is skyrocketing. pypl is clearly under distribution. total econ collapse progressing well.
Loving the breakout. Sorry not sorry I own both PayPal and square. PayPal way over due for a jump and it’s gonna come with earnings. Let’s hope their annual guidance stays in tact. If so 100+ easy.
are we having fun yet..... wheeeeee!
Great buying opportunity. Don’t miss it and suffer regret
How many PYPL longs have a clue as to how ill- liquid the market will be without ongoing repo operations?
The past chart is very good
"Once market firms up, I really see this $175+ or so, people are borrowing right now and taking out loans, quarterly earnings should be astronomic.."
Hopefully we'll stay north of $68 this session... healthy showing in pre-market .... Long Paypal !
Anyone in @ $309+? Be honest! ROTFLMFAO 
PYPL just bought back 12 million shares
$MGNI $PYPL $TWLO great end of year portfolio placement - potential for 2021 and beyond. Move some money to these winners with massive growth ahead.
"All systems green.You are go to throttle up to 230.Rodger, throttling up to 230."
I JUST KEEP BUYING WHEN IT IS RED.
There should be more upgrades coming soon because this company has a lot of cash similar to a mini Apple and can invest heavily for its growth aspirations. I love companies that invest for its future relevance!
PayPal reached an all time high at 214.60
Profits up a bit but revenues are basically flat. Maybe there are too many payment systems.
Its over sold time to avg up
I use PayPal for EVERYTHING! Added to my position!
pypl is super top heavy. slam packed with restless dip buyers nervously eyeing the 100 mark. implosion dead ahead.
I love the smell of freshly squeezed shorts on a cold day like today. Delicious.
Awesome beat on expectations. I think this massive increase in major partnerships is going to explode the stock's price in the future!
100 by nov expiration??
"looks not too bad from a chart perspective, maybe a call on PayPal?"
i have been holding pypl since $31.69 i bought 2000 Shares .... this has been very hard to hold. Elon Musk is a smart man.

"Meh,I will check back on this stock in a few days. I am not worried one bit. Big stocks such as PYPL that is exapanding + everything + great earnings report. This baby will bounce back in 1-2 months. NOTHING to lose your head over everyone or sleep for that matter. If you are LONG you have nothing to worry about."
$100 stock by January 1 2019.
I believe it can go up to 95!
this is the dip we wanted
sorry I meant earnings
"Here we go once again, but this time PYPL has smashed through several technical resistance levels. Fully expecting to see the 220 level by Monday, then the run to 230+. Analysts say there is a lot more room to run, so prove the analysis right!"
I bought Paypal at 59.
Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Willi has upgraded PayPal from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $80 to $95.
very unlikely movement for paypal? any good news?
Very low volume today
Paypal is very undervalued. Should be around 130.

"PayPal has performed in the fashion l wrote 9 hours ago and is trending northward in after hours as well, as all the Investor Day information is gradually being digested by the market. This is a stellar performance among all the other companies that have already reported for the quarter, not to mention today was outstanding especially being a Friday"
Anyone here remember when PYPL was 300 and my Square was 189? Now take a little looksie 
Was as low as 122 in after hours.....now 137. Sweet!
Another $10.00 and I'm back in the saddle again...
where is Elon?
Time to let Kevin Fade away.... plse.
Might be a little too much dip on the chip going up 5% in regular trading session. But I'll hold thru earnings. This company is going to the moon.
"When Paypal stops the flow of money to some accounts March 29 -- it will have a ripple effect to EBAY and anyone else trying to use it as a payment processor when they cant accept funds Paypal will lose funds, lose fee, ebay will lose funds, lose sales, lose fee so will other companies."
guys paypal or square?
How this is trading at less than $74 is beyond my comprehension.
PayPal had conference yesterday stating the would be willing to be bought out. Najarions also mentioned unusual activity in options. PayPal CEO has interview tonight with Cramer. And PayPal has another conference tomorrow. Just relaying info. Also Kudlow accepted job at Whitehouse today.
let's just hope that earnings don't disappoint
PYPL will be surging back huge tmr!️️️
"$280 here we go!!! every online store uses PayPal. not square. Paypal PayPal PayPal.... in Covid I have used it more than ever!!!! Venmo, Bitcoin app, etc."
"Why is PYPL down 1% today? I thought the story read ""double digit growth"". So why is it down more than 1%??"
"my opinion, I think will take off hold on to your seats!"
Why is everyone comparing the share price of $SQ to $PYPL? Only amateurs compare share prices. Market cap is where you compare them.
Crazy thing is...in this market...would any one be surprised if it took out 300 in 2 week's?
"Regret adding to my portfolio. This company is just a total dissappointment. i cant find any reason for it to drop this much. if anyone could, please enlighten"
PayPal and Bitcoin going much higher!
Why are people doubting PayPal? This baby is going to the moon (or at least $200)!
looks like she may pop on open. here's to hoping. cheers
$BFT will be $60 before the end of 2021 $PYPL $SQ
You retire with this one. The story just keeps getting better. Awesome company.
Where is everyone? Must be bored with all the consistent winning
Any news coming in..
Ready for bounceback!
"I have a couple dumb questions about buybacks. If they are buying back $10B in pypl stock. That's ~10% of the market cap. So wouldn't that automatically increase the earnings per share by 10%?Plus, when they buy them back, won't the increased demand force the price up considerably as well? Just seems like such huge buybacks would significantly raise the intrinsic, and market value of the stock unless I'm misunderstanding something. Seems like you'd want to hold just for that?"
Disappointing day
I guess the $350 price target this morning didn’t help! It’s going lower people $250 was forever high
Get ready for the good upside tomorrow
Buy V or PYPL? Both look like sure bets for next year or 2 at least but since PYPL is younger co.does it have more growth?
PayPal doesn’t even have a tangible product to sell the closest thing they have is a debit card 
Done shopping on Ebay if cannot use Paypal. Certainly not willing to give my personal payment information to a foreign entity.
NASDAQ up $100 PayPuke deep red
Does anyone invested here have a timeline of say more than five minutes?! This is a long term investment. If you can’t be long then get out and day trade. Sheesh! Longs with patience will profit greatly with Visa.

"kick ge out of the dow, and add PYPL. any thoughs"
The struggle is real....
Square can’t fade PayPal. Market pessimism can and will though....but it won’t last. $PYPL
I think whats really bothering the market is the combination of whats going on at the boarder with putting children in what amounts to be an internment camps and the trade war. If this nutbag is willing to torture kids (albeit they're not white which probably has a lot to do with it) how much farther will he take this trade war. Its looks like hes gone off the deep end. Markets dont like that. A mentally unstable POTUS is a bad thing.
behold the banksters begging retail to go long pypl by means of the media. must be massive whales long millions of shares looking to exit pypl quietly without collapsing the price. buy buy buy says bears sterns cramer.
"Yesterday I paid $30 worth of fees to buy ETH on PayPal. Crypto is going to generate a lot of money for PayPal. I figure worst case if I lose the money I invested in ETH, PayPal should make it back for me"
"PayPal beat earnings, revenue, and total payment volume growth consensus estimates. Added 16 million net new active users bring its total active accounts to 377 million.Expecting to add 50 million net new active accounts in the next 12 months.Venmo accounts rose 32% to 70 million active accountsSince adding bitcoin purchasing to its platform, it’s seen its users loging into their accounts twice as much."
Going all in on paypal tomorrow hoping to hit mid 70s after earnings wish me luck!
They guided revenue lower for Sept. qtr. THAT IS WHY IT IS DOWN!
Minimal movement in AH. That’s a good sign. Steady is always nice.
PYPL price is rising!
"Everyone, I am just as worried as you. Which is why when I bought I did so with not so much money so I can double down on dips. NOW is the time to double down. Perfect example is SQ... down 29% then up 35% in 3 months. PYPL will recover + but might take 1-2 months."
All the market is fallingSelling gain from yesterday
its time to buy some more adding pypl and palo alto to the portfolio today holding long
"Total Payments of $277 billion, growing 39%, and 36% on an FX-neutral basis (FXN); revenue of $6.12 billion, growing 23%. GAAP EPS of $1.32, up 208% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.08, up 29%"
Cramer Has PayPal on His “Super Bowl” Dream Team!!! 
Any idea why SQ price acting like what PYPL should be doing (up over $1.2x now) and PYPL (down .43) acting like what SQ price should be doing? ..
Let's get this to the magic $180 so the short fest can start!
"CAn""t believe the games the big players are playing with this stock."
Merrill Lynch raised it's price target on PYPL to $323

topping up

GAAP EPS includes a net gain of $0.13 on strategic investments, driven primarily by MercadoLibre"
Way oversold atm.
"Baird reiterates Outperform rating on PayPal with a $220 price target.rom 41.1% in 2019, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian tells investors in a research note. PayPal remains the most popular digital wallet ""by a wide margin, while rapid growth in Venmo adoption should provide a significant long-term monetization opportunity,"" adds the analyst. Sebastian views the survey results as largely confirmatory of positive Venmo trends, and he reiterates Outperform rating on PayPal with a $220 price target."
If this gets down to the $250s range I'll buy more but I doubt it makes it below the $260s this week unless tech slides hard.
POP!
Just give it 2 days. Back at 85
new highs end of day. so predictable at this point.
"Every growth stock has been dumped after earning and PayPal is no exception, I don’t see buyers stepping in on the Election Day or rest of this week so my worry is that the stock will continue to do down.... support at 171, 165 and 150, let’s see which one holds"
This stock is going to the moon before you know it! $300 before the year ends!
BEATS BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM LINE. NAYSAYERS WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHORTS WILL LOSE THEIR REAR END TOMORROW (AS USUAL)!!!!
"OK, so MELI investment just yielded 21% return.....TODAY. 21% of 750 million.... $157 million in one day. Nice job PYPL."

"People i said it once and i will say it again. In future use a trailing stop loss. When your stock goes up at least 25%. Then set your TSL at 20% so you are always in the money, or whatever you are comfortable with.Better to loose some then a lot! Remember the crash? It will happen again and this time it might be the big one!"
"This world is cruel, but also very beautiful."

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 12 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.38."
Jim Cramer said he bought PYPL aggressively this week. So did I.
"Bitcoin revenue is still undervalued IMO. They are bringing in $11 on $500 in bitcoin purchases, then the same on the sale."

"PayPal price target raised to $205 from $170 at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry raised the firm's price target on PayPal (PYPL) to $205 from $170 and keeps a Conviction Buy rating on the shares as he raised his 2020-2022 revenue estimates by 6% per year on average and increased his adjusted EPS view 12% per year on average to reflect a sustained acceleration in the consumer shift to online payments as well as market share gains. Terry points to intraquarter user acquisition metrics, such as app downloads, as well as third party data tracking on e-commerce, and intraquarter data from companies such as Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) as evidence that PayPal is benefiting ""meaningfully"" from e-commerce acceleration, particularly in the U.S"
PayPal may make it to $1T before TSLA.

I just bought some...great opportunity!
Think I’m pulling out my gains and investing in SQ I see SQ has more room to run.
Earnings are May 7th...
PayPal reached an all time high at 129.22
This is turning into quite not a moving stock.
$78 today
Merge with SQ?
Now a good buy?

Are y'all enjoying the roller coaster rides yet? Who wants more?
Come to Papa! $189 to $180. Will be $150 by Friday be patient shorts don’t cover
"Anyone who has finished reading the earning call transcript will not sell PYPL.....Honey integration into PayPal and Venmo will dramatically increase engagement and TPV, and in 2020 PYPL will move into offline POS through either NFC or QR Code in China and US....these movement will take PYPL to $400 by 2025."
Easy plus making
This is a good company with very good earning. It is a buying opportunity!!!
"As more people see PayPal staying green on red days for the market, it only warrants more buyers looking for stability."
"Only a reaction to Uber shares which are really meaningless for PYPL as it has too much cash. But, once more institutions will drive the price down to 99 or so, and then start buying. Classic market manipulation as usual. You can bet Golden Sachs and Citibank have their hands dirty as usual."
This is why I always want to own grinders like PYPL in my portfolio. The stock is up 2 cents when the rest of tech got mauled.
"Bought in after the IPO and continued to hold. Ditto for Square. Will re-evaluate my PayPal position at year end. Square has been on fire and I doubled up twice on it. PayPal also has a fantastic story, every analyst discussion on the stock has been very positive. Many having it as one of their ten best stocks to buy, so don’t understand why we are not taking off. I firmly believe in the company and I am a client. The buck stops with the CEO."
Curious to see what ARPU will be in 2021.
"Good company, great growth, overvalued."
Just bought 700 shrs of PYPL @ $83.11
100B market cap for a payment company??? US market is JOKE! $8.00 stock is trading at $84.00.

This willGo higher ...
God bless green!..........
"Whats up with Zacks Investment, Yesterday they upped their rcomended on PYPL, today they lowered it"
Very nice consolidation. Now is the time to be buying more shares before the next leg up 
Add more... now 40% of my holdings in PYPL. Expect this to jump up to 90$ after tomorrow.
"If as Bloomberg is reporting that PayPal says this will not alter their guidance, why does it appear as though no one believes them?"
This will get back to $200+ in no time. Bought more this morning. Earnings beat coming this afternoon!
Lol at people worrying about losing eBay in 5 YEARS. And it'll just be then not being primary payment option
PYPL is Bullish.
What a week boys and girls!
"PayPal growth potential looks even better after Q3, says Morgan Stanley. Reiterated Overweight and $229 price target. Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said PayPal (PYPL) was able to exceed TPV growth in Q3 even with a high bar set, adding that he is encouraged that revenue and EPS are looking to be better than forecast in the second half of the year even with accelerated eBay (EBAY) roll off and no recovery in the travel environment. The analyst, who sees the company being better positioned today to deliver compounding earnings growth over the medium-to-long term given new products and about 70M net new users to carry out of 2020, keeps an Overweight rating and $229 price target on PayPal shares."
Technically we’re going higher loading up here
One point up at least for today. I just want to know how many upgrades will pop up.
"at this rate we will likely hit high 80 next week and pull back down to low 79, then back to 81 the next week or higher depending on news from online sales. 2018 is looking to be just as good as 2017 or better"
Closing at its highs always a good thing. Everyday the story gets better for PayPal. Arriba!
"No rationale, it moves or doesn’t move (like any other stock) to its own drum. Just have to be patient."

Welcome to the club 'beat estimations and go down'.
Earnings the 25th July...Longs will love this stock!!!
My Square only up $10
"Got to love how PayPal touts its ""best quarter"" record ever in history!.. Market punishes it! Beats expectations both top and bottom line!Bizarre world!!"
all this helicopter money and pypl / fake markets are flat and unable to rally.
People you act like the post earnings dip was a surprise. Don't you all realize this is computer generated selling regardless of earnings UNLESS they are just astronomical?? Pypl beat and raised and they will be fine.
Rumour big boy’s are buying and shorts are crazy! Merger with Apple Pay?
"First off Yahoo message board suck because it deletes half the messages for no reason. NO reason to think this wont be deleted either.In any event I posted earlier to expect a big drop on the earnings but that it would recover, which it did somewhat. Now it's back down to last weeks level. The stock has had a good run and people are looking for any reason to take profits. Let the sellers sell and they buy more. They were fractionally light on revenue expectations next quarter but raised full year guidance. Stick with it and buy more as it drops."
"How myopic can investors be?! A “projected” leveling of 4th QTR earnings is no reason for such a deep sell off, as I have no doubt that PYPL will once again exceed analyst expectations. Realize too, we are entering another phase of the pandemic as flu season approaches, schools and social venues continue to close at alarming rates, and the government handlings is on a precept of turmoil. Again, we have a strengthening position in cryptocurrencies, an exponentially growing client base, and a world forced in to electronic banking transactions. I really see no other possible direction that up from here. I could go on and on, and admit I am aghast at the direction this took, but the markets never fail to shock and awe investors and traders alike. I am now ready to await PYPLs next surprise and the markets reaction. GLTA!"
Taking my 3K I put in litecoin though paypal out and putting it in Paypal calls.
$957 million dollars in overnight trading made the huge price jump. Lot of online purchasing figures to go on for a long time. Good bye bricks and mortar.
$93 is the key number for PayPal! We surpass that on a hot day and we could see a technical break out which lines us up nicely for a good earnings! Most likely going to see a slight sell off before earnings but that’s just click work. Good luck guys! I wish I had more funds to put into PayPal because I’m liking how this stock is looking in such political turmoil and global market instability.
"Indications are Paypal looking for a split, may be 3 for 1."
tarriffs are positive for pypl / no impact whatsoever / more transactions will be done on amzn - eBay - baba etc to avoid tarriffs

"fewer pieces on the chess board! M A R A bought another 10,000 mining machines.Look at the open interest of calls on mara and uxin and solo.Serious things in the works on all 3, do your research.ttnp trxs takeover targets."
"I have an equal amount invested in both PYPL and MA. Am about to sell all PYPL and buy more MA. Both great companies with the same gains, but MA just does it with considerably less volatility than PYPL, and that makes me more comfortable."
Once venmo starts bringing in revenue we are set for years to come

WMN 24/09/2020: Deutsche Bank reiterates PayPal a Buy with a $234 price target.I suspect there will be a slew more “reiterates” coming in; not much more one can do it improve on a Strong Buy recommendation at this ‘gift horse” level!
"For PYPL, it's China, folks....Thursday's talks in Washington is what's hanging in the balance, regarding market sentiment towards this name......retaliation towards US companies that are in China is the market fear pressuring this stock....PYPL just made a big investment in China....that is at risk, hence the fall to 99.......the results of the TALKS, a truce, anything good will propel PYPL back to 105, I hope.....Disclosure: Long at 103.80"

Just bought some crypto on PayPal to see how it worked. It's easy and PayPal is going to make some bank as a place to buy and sell crypto. It should be a big money maker.
Premarket: REDPaypal: I DONT CARE 
Why are we all getting another series of Warren Buffett and his massive war chest articles making the rounds again? Why do I have this feeling that Buffett is seriously looking to add a large position in Paypal?
Thanks to Nick for the SQ vs PYPL info :)
Machines may make an sell error. Buying on gap down.
So glad I loaded more a couple of days ago. Loving this stock.
valuation is terrible. but i guess it doesn't matter anymore in this market.
About time we took out the 52 week high. PayPal been a bit late to the party but better late than never. It’s our time!
Beautiful reversal today!!!!!
Is it too late to buy this stock now?
dip buyers giving the cash to the exiting hedge fund sellers. wheeee!

"Just had a blow-out quarter, next quarter will be even better!"
"Reminder $TWTR folks. Jack Dorsey owns SQ. He is also CEO at $SQ so he is mismanaging two companies by being politically extreme and alienating businesses owners from using SQ’s inferior product. How much is he truly focusing on one let alone two companies when he has been censoring mainstream America and giving a forum to rioters, looters, arsonists and their associated organizations.$PYPL and other alternatives are the way to go. Don’t be known as “doing a Dorsey”. Self inflicting financial harm to yourself and worse others who have no say and mistakenly invested in $SQ not knowing.Go check out the public records, the vast majority of Dorsey’s holdings are with $SQ He has very little left by comparison in $TWTR.Sell and save yourself the grief."
Panicked selling...gotta love it
Too expensive
"People seemed to have forgotten that Dan is correct in his assessment. Paypal has experienced delays in implementation of the technologies with partners. However, those issues (can anyone say IZettle having to wait on their anti-competition ruling?) have been resolved. I look for a revenue guidance correction to the POSITIVE in the third quarter because of these partnership resolutions and implementations!"

there is no physical silver available to buy in mexico. oh dear. how many shares of pypl are available?
Options up like crazy tm
Just for you guys to know: the more volatile Bitcoin's price is the more transactions which is good for Paypal.
My business model and analysis puts this stock at $300 range within 3 years. Enjoy the ride buy the dips. paper money and checks are the past plastic and digital are the future. This is the next MSFT ….
who thinks this is up by days end tommorow? thumps up and down for down
Shorts on PYPL & SQ are going to lose big time!
They beat wall street expectations and the stock dropped. I told yall the market is fixed!!!
Looks like the magic is gone from PayPal for awhile.
14 minutes left in AH. Come get PYPL shares at 105.
whats with this drop..
Tells me the economy is slowing faster than what manipulators are telling us. PayPal is a good indicator of it.
AS a long time shareholder this impressive growth in venmobis exactly what I wanted to see (actually better than I hoped)https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-ceo-venmo-users-are-clamoring-to-do-more-than-just-send-money-2019-04-24?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
"It seems Q3 earnings were short of expectations? This seems like an excuse to sell when actual earnings beat on every target there was. I think the stock is being manipulated to create a less expensive entry point for institutional buyers, who want to now get in because Venmo has proven to have grown by 78%. This stock is the next Visa."
W
Pre mkt is <$189... Regarding PYPL ER isn't this supposed to hit ~$195 at least?
PYPL just mentioned on CNBC as “going higher”.
Another upgrade! Still see this easily hitting $300 in the next 3 QTRs. Momentum today should realize a 3-4% gain today at minimum. I just can’t place my finger on what is holding this back for so long. Enjoy the growth!
PYPL is up 6.53% to 90.83

I need $150 by Friday to make 2000% on my puts I bought this morning........BTW anyone fall for the crypto news at $215? Be honest?
120-200 next year
I was just checking out some other stocks: HD and FDX have been hit hard - have no idea where pypl will end up tonight? Would love to pick some up in the 60's in case they miss or the market doesn't like what they hear. The market is not acting strong ATM and would expect more downside and we need the tariffs to be figured out.
Let it find support before buying.
note that Q1 is always the slowest of the US eco. quarterly reports....so this is a pretty gd earnings report.
"This is a high quality stock. Believe after today, there should be more investors jumping in."
Good morning and welcome to the beginning of a new high for PayPal stock over the next few weeks.Shorts like Big making me wealthier as they lose money on their Daddy's retirement account.There goes the family silver ahahahahaha

Before oppening all the market is redWhy????
I hope this won’t be the same as the FAANG stocks slip
Hey stockadopealus how is that trade working out for you. Pulling out of PayPal and going into TEAM and GROW . Guess that's why you are laying low.
20% higher coming imo. nice hold ..
PayPal needs to stop sitting on their cash and make big investments! I feel they are too afraid to do anything!
Long term buy and hold
"The people who sell today will be the new bears in the coming days talking about what a ""scam"" $ZM is.

Also loading up on $NFLX. $ZM...I'm so up that it can crash to $100, and it is still a non-factor. My portfolio is about 98% up from last year...lol! Invest...not trade!"

I knew it would go up once I sold all my shares... so I faked traded and here we go. You’re welcome
Good time to add more PYPL shares. This stock is going higher
What happened to PayPal...
275 is not enough.Buy Buy Buy now

"I mentioned the $1T transaction volume below. What happens if this reaches $10T in the future?With a take rate of 2% or so, we are looking at $200B in revenue. 20% profit margin would put us at $40B profit.... stick a P/E of 25 on it and we are looking at a $1T market capWhat does everyone think of these numbers? This is roughly what I keep calculating"
When do earnings? Yahoo says before the bell but I don't see them.

"I still believe that tech sell-off is not done yet. So PYPL will not go any where in the near term. I think if PYPL does not acquire some assets this year, it may be a target itself. I like PYPL under 70, because of EBAY. PYPL needs to put more resource on VENMO. If VENMO does not grow reap and bow in the next two quarters, we may see PYPL UNDER 70."
the price action today is clearly telling us this run is not over
Per CCPayPal Transaction Volume from Ebay currently stands at 13% of total volumeWas 19% 30 months ago when the 2 companies splitExpect to be around 4% when the operating agreement (OA) between the 2 companies expires in 30 months (sometime in 2020)Ebay is constrained to give NOT more than 5% of their transaction volume to Ayden (MOR) for any 2 countries they chooseand 10% of their transaction volume an year from now up to the end of the OA (mid 2020)No medium term impact due to the change and any minimal impact has already been modeled in their outlookIMO the sell off is way overdue and could be a good buying oppty

this is oversold it's a great chance to get back in... I bought calls
This won't even give me enough time to throw some calls on tomorrow morning. That dip was quick. Still holding my core position.
Why are we down so much? Is PYPL being considering a Corona Stock now?
Top and bottom line beat and raise guidance about as good as it gets. Regardless the knee jerk reaction tonight and mañana this will power the stock forward in the coming weeks
Najarian brother said go ahead and buy at all time high.....its going higher......I never do this.....its a momentum buy....so in at 89....making money. I need to learn trend is your friend and buying at all time highs. PayPal injects itself into many electronic transfer companies. Najarian: this could go much higher. Anybody?
Incredibly cheap $SHOP $PYPL $TWLO all made new highs $SQ not even close to $100. Chart is poised for a major break out $77 tested so many times technicals has this pointing at $105 if it breaks $83. Forget $77 look at for $83 new resistance don’t sit on the fence and watch.
$182 coming
$100 is inevitable
$200 After Earnings? What are your thoughts?
"COVID is a long way from over, and mutations are increasing rapidly. Don't bury your faith in PYPL quite yet. There is a LONG road ahead before this and other highly probable pandemics are sufficiently eradicated. Easy to bash an exceptional stock when it falls. Expect ANOTHER record breaking earnings report. With over 40 years investing experience, I can tell you that this is a fantastic entry level."

Slow and steady!
It seems PYPL has support at this level. After Christmas we will see the movement of PYPL. I guess CEO and COO will come out and do the promotion again first thing on new year. I want to see PYPL around 76-78 before earnings report.
Breaking out
It will be above 105 end of week
When are we going to get any more news about how many mores shares we have bought back? After all we have earmarked $10 billiob for buybacks. Tired of Yahoo sitting on 1.17 billion shares outstanding!

"One of my biggest holdings. Certainly hurts. I think the reaction is overblown, but don't think it bounces back anytime soon. Just like Costco's split with Am Ex, killed AMEX for a couple of quarters. I feel this will be the same."

Almost 3 percent up now... Definitely gonna tank 10 percent after the release
It will probably drip to the 95 or there abouts again and then reverse for a double bottom reversal.
"CNBC (After Hours Buzz article) ""Despite strong earnings, PayPal issued weak outlook for earnings and revenue during the first quarter of 2018."" Also, eBay brought on a new payments Co. (they will now have 2 pymt options, Adyen & PayPal. However, when using Adyen you can stay right in the eBay website to checkout but with PYPL you can't."
Where's the volume?
Need to see PYPL 76 -78 by next two weeks in order to ignite the firework. We will see 85 by the time earnings report.
I am long on PYPL but was wondering... why would a medium to large business use PayPal as credit card processing company when they charge over 2%? Normal credit card processing companies charge low 1-2%. I’m trying to understand what the upside is for using PayPal.
Good for my $131c 5/8s I bought into this morning. Got a little scared for a sec but then “THEY REALIZED”
"ARKK still buying $PYPL & $TSLA. These are not short term accumulations and being done with confidence of profit. I have and am in both, TSLA being the only stock I admitting have shorted in the past; no more. With PYPLs estimated value and record of earnings, I am miffed that it is not jumping. Investors need to stop comparing it to SQ and unhinge analysis fro Crypto movement. The run to $385 will commence again if Dems will stop tearing down the bricks that have held up economic confidence!"
Going to hondo before you know it
What would happen to PYPL stock price if they started crypto conversions on their platform? Why hasn't the management team already provided this service assuming they could charge somewhere between a 1% to 3% transaction fee?
PayPUKE still $309+? Haven’t looked in a while.

This is just the beginning too! It’s up 8%+ today! $TEUM is going to be huge! Get in now while the price is unbelievably cheap :) you will thank me later!! Huge backlog that hasn’t even turned into realized revenue. It’s a golden (semi-hidden) gem waiting to explode! As always, STAY TUNE!!!!!"

just bought in. Lets go up!
"Buying the dip, PYPL long-term undeniable huge winner, in so many ways. Bought at $40 years ago and as long as it grow at +20% per year, no reason to ever sell."
Just another day testing ath!!
When will we know about the earnings? Good luck longs!
Invested our joint fund into Paypal yesterday...but still haven't told the wife yet.
120 soon then 150 total domination of online transactions
"Hate being right, but I told you so......52 week high today????"
"According to my analysis (and a hazy crystal ball), PYPL can hit $200 tomorrow easily. Watching options now. Get ready for some astonishing movement!"

I'm pretty sure it's better to open red on a day like this and let buyers come back. Hopefully finish green.One thing I don't understand.Square announce s they're upping there game into crypto and stock doubles in a day.Paypal sells off.
"From Reddit:The obvious $SQ counterpoint goes like this: iZettle was about to IPO with a 1.1bn valuation. PayPal overpaid to get into the space where they already tried two home grown solutions and failed. PayPal is the company beset on all sides, not Square, and this acquisition is defensive. Square has totally wrecked PYPL in this sphere (ever see PYPL's competition? The PayPal Here Triangle-dongle? Or see their registers in a store?)So this isn't a reason for Square to be worried, it's $PYPL admitting defeat and buying something at a big premium in the hopes of re-entering a market. It's a signal of failure on PYPL's part.On the other side of the competition, Venmo (another PYPL acquisition) had a huge lead but Square's home-grown Cash App has been #1 in finance apps for all of 2018 so far.PayPal has not had a home-grown success in years. Their reputation among small sellers is bad, and they would be wise to keep their name off of iZettle if they want it to be successful (like they did with Venmo for a long time). But iZettle on its own has no name recognition. It is PayPal, and not Square, fighting the uphill battle here.Finally, compare each company's services with the other and see who offers more. Does iZettle do payroll? Appointments and booking? Employee management? Or is it only a register? Square's ecosystem is very large and sticky in comparison to any of PayPal's + iZettle's offerings"
Looks like some shorts bailing.... congrats
"I'd love someone to point to the ""bad"" in this report? I mean i've only skimmed it but everything looks up and good. What in the world. Is it lower volume, lower new users, no monitization of venmo.....lack of forward guidance? I don't see why this would be down 4% on these numbers."
Myriad FOOLS (shorts) have lost so much in this WINNER!
"Ok Pypl, let's not repeat yesterday's cruel joke, that was not funny"
It keeps testing above 86 but won’t hold. It’s just stronger and stronger each time though (going higher each time). I expect it to break 52 week highs today or tomorrow. Prove me right $PYPL.

Oil price has fallen into false flag territory. Do not underestimate the psychopaths at the so called US Inc.
It must fall significantly. Short term PT $50.00
I expect revised analyst targets over $275 or more. Here is the future of monetary management.
In February will be in 275 to 300 and for then is gonna be late.......
Road to 250
Another awesome day to be a PYPL shareholder!!
SQ moving to green and PYPL backing-off deeper into red ??? I guess the true facts are becoming known ..... and investors like to associate their wagons to a winner!
It's bouncing.. Looks like people are realizing Paypal is A BANK...so higher rates ain't all that bad.
"Up to now, I still don't see any body will be good enough to match PYPL. Even V and MA which is the safe stock, but in term of growth I don't see V and MA can even get close to PYPL. I estimate that PYPL growth will be in the 30% area for the next two years. Don't forget PYPL has no debt. I just guess PYPL should split 2:1 in the first quarter to make it more attractive for small retail traders."
"Guys,I've been following this conversation room and you guys were very helpful. Thank you though. For the very first time of my life, I got into this pypl & sq stock share market since last summer and made over $50k. I've always been a type of person who never wanted to invest into stock market because I thought it was nothing but a gambling but after investing almost a year, My mind was changed. I was very fortunate that I chose these two stocks. Ever since I read articles and news because of these two stocks, I became more interested in cryptocurrency/bitcoin. There are hundreds of different cryptocurrencies out ithere but one of them got me very interested which was Ripple/XRP. As a long time pypl stock holder, I wanted to let you guys a heads up on a investment opportunity in this XRP currency. If you guys wanna know more about it, check their website and search youtube videos.I've already invested $20k into this cryptocurrency market since last week. I am 40 years old and tried my best to make a best living out of my life and after working all these years, I have saved a little more than $150k and I still can't even buy a house yet. Since I live in LA, the house market inflation is so terrible and I just don't think it is possible for me to buy at least a house. It would probably happen when I become 50 or even older or never. There's a Korean saying ""If you were born rich because your dad is rich, you were born with a gold spoon in your mouth"" but I was born with wooden spoon. Even if I lose this investment. I am still remaining as a wooden spoon with or without $20k. :)"
PYPL is rocking today!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"All I can say, is if your not buying on the dip, you may soon feel like a dip."
"Back from the dead $86 , $90.00 now."
Another breakout
PayPUKE  down an even 20% in a week. Is that really a stable stock? 
With the amount of free cash flow Paypal is sitting on they have the ability to adapt and carve out new opportunities in the fin-tech industry another aspect that has been overlooked by many. Square is experiencing great growth but doesn't compare in terms of the metrics that paypal has. Paypal is still #1 in the fintech industry and besides the drop today due to mostly the market itself (not the silly downgrade) it will continue to slowly grow.
just picked up 40 more shares
You thought the last few months have been good? You haven’t seen anything yet. This really is just the beginning. PayPal is positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of it and there’s no end in sight. Digital is here to stay. Buckle your seat belts or move out of the way. https://apple.news/AnI5FzzkQQxyJ9v6yb-17MA
PayPal is down 5.46% to 254.50
PYPL will move sideway until pass Christmas. This week ADBE and UNH will have surprise move.
This will test low 80s
Brutal
volume 44 mil today? that's a lot of trading in 1 day for PayPal
"Boy, I just MUTED those alias with ""BUBBLE"", ""OVER-VALUED"" with all caps. This msg board looks so much cleaner and better. I will suggest you to do so as well ... nothing but noise! lol"
sans private fed reserve intervention (feds are the only ones buying) then this market will implode.
Amazon deal in offing IMHO and when that happens the stock will double.
Holding up nicely on a tech wreck day. We are now (finally) ready for our next serious move towards.
Big money will find its way back to PayPal. It’s inevitable. Be patient. The stock has been really hot the past year so the big dogs probably want to see it stabilize and show support in this mid/high $70’s
iam long on this one
Will Amazon strike a deal with PayPal? Maybe. I think there is a greater possibility that Facebook might integrate PayPal into their ecosystem (i.e. Payments via Messenger and Whatsapp similar to Wechat Pay/Alipay in China). Note that the former PayPal CEO now works for Facebook so that may lead to an interesting outcome.
PAYPAL to the moon! Everyone loves and uses paypal! It has become a household name!
pushing higher before the bell. Congrats to those who bought on the dips.
FINALLY
"Don't sweat It, I own some stocks that delivered great results and went down as much as 20% only to recover 1 ir 2 days later"
Great day got me $1.80
Real price $117
Some bottom fishing should be successful from PYPL. I still believe it is just a pause not sell off. Janet will say farewell and present another gift for the market on Wednesday the same day that PYPL will blow the estimate away.
ANything under $265 is stealing
Whatever will add more position tomorrow.
silver is the cheapest asset available. 20 + by year end.
Surprised that the breakout didn’t materialize today; the handle still isn’t quite there yet. Going in to earnings will hopefully set a string of new highs.
"Google, Amazon, or Facebook can acquire Paypal in the near future."
Any chance this will hit $100 by end of year?
$200 soon
The bubble guy is gone. Hope Yahoo shut him down for good
Oh Yeah baby!!
"The funny thing is, when a stock will really go down, institutions will make it to look like going up, when a stock will really go up, institutions will make it to look like going down. I just found MU, l guess it will go up a lot very soon!"
"pypl is carving out a hard ceiling. there is that gap at 45 to be filled and blamed on ""unforeseen"" economic contraction."
Tomorrow buying back the dipBargain price
So surge in demand for April May but they pull guidance?
"Back down now valuation matters and TPV growth says show me the money and uh oh with intense competition and low barriers to entry. Apple, Zelle etc. No thanks."
"Was up $20; making the easy call, will be RED by the end of today"
"This stock is going to fly because PayPal no longer refunds processing fees back to the seller for return. Example a buyer buy a $1,000 item. The seller will be charged (2.9% processing fees plus $.30 transaction fees). Total out to be $30. Within a minutes later, the buyer want to cancel. PayPal will keep the $30 no matter what. Same for return. Everyone is addictive to online payment, there is no way around this. PYPL to infinity."
Come on Paypal....lets get moving!!
"New to paypal stock, any advice for a good entry price? Tired of being a bagholder. Any advice would be appreciated."
Cmon plz get to 90
"PYPL might be doing very well based on one payment processor data set.""....spending via mobile wallets increased more than 80%, as consumers continue adopting new payment methods.""..https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-friday-brick-mortar-sales-173000853.html""... When paying with a card, consumers chose credit. Fifty-seven percent of card-based spending was via credit card, compared to 43% for debit. Spending via mobile wallets was up 82% compared to 2018 """
Most of the up days are on good volume. When this breaks 214 it should run to 230 easy. Strap in.
Bravo everyone ! We’ve finally learnt not to reply to the likes of Stock_Casino and Simon as they spread their nonsense BS ! They’ll soon tire of
wow!!! I'm very surprised we almost hit 78 today! we were at 73 yesterday! This is great!!!
Strong close by PYPL and great week. Story keeps getting better. Stockstradamus no where to be seen. No-Grow and Teum I gather must not have done well on this awesome day for stocks.
Go green
"I own and love $PYPL, and would like to buy more. But what are your thoughts at this level? Had made a huge move the last few months, obviously. On the other hand, there’s still so much more room to grow."
yup 80 coming today!!! yippee!
"bought heavy today,,,,, shorting square at this point,,,,,, paypal willget to $100 before square."
Tal C is PayPal #1 fan lol. Respect
"why i bought paypal. im just old enough i dont consider myself a millennial. i prefer cash and credit cards. but i started a small architecture business that grew quickly the last 2 years, and i kept getting people asking me if i take paypal payments. i couldnt believe it, why where other single owner businesses wanting to use paypal instead of checks? i didnt argue though, i downloaded the app and bought the stock. glad i did, because my client list who use paypal is growing, and now i recommend it to people who ask how i prefer my payments."
"Alot of big money will jump in today, earnings will be epic...."
This road could become dumpy but I don't care as long it is PayPal that is part of my portfolio
"For the people selling before earnings, you've been at the party this long why leave before the main act?"
Great close... Wednesday..Thursday will be Great!!!!!! Closing in on $100.00 doable!
I invested in Redhat back in the 60's . This is a company that was gobbling up all these smaller cloud play companies left and right and I just felt they had a plan. And boom. It payed off. I see these s same thing happening here.I believe they know exactly where this whole global payment industry is going and know exactly what it will take to own it.
My best pal. Pypl is in on 
While I hold some PYPL ..... SQ has more momentum and prospects than PYPL ... and it's showing in the equity returns over past 24 months ... will continue for another 24 months unabated unless SQ is acquired (which has a 50% chance in next 12 months). All good in my opinion
PayPal 3Q Adjusted EPS $1.07 Vs. 61c Y/y
Does PYPL have an official earnings date yet?
I put $30K into PYPL. Why because I believe in what it can offer. No debt. Mobile innovation. Venmo. Partnerships with Visa and MC. Linked to China's largest search engine Baidu. List goes on and on.
"retail longs had better look at how huge the volume is on down days and how light the volume is on up days. its called distribution. btw, that was an emergency rate cut as the economy is in collapse mode. pypl has admitted as much and sq has confirmed."
"what the hell happened to the market this afternoon, I looked @ my stocks about 12:30 and everything was +++??"
250 by Halloween
"Thank you $PYPL for growth, loading in $ODP for a rocket someone bought a $14M worth of stock, is a buyout coming?"
$210 by end of the week.
ok...im starting to smile
Trump speech was excellent. Pre-market jump. It will help PYPL tomorrow.
When is the earning ?
The upgrades / price targets keep coming in!
"Paypal does not hold any Crypto.....its customers buy and sell and It just charges a fee. WTH the articles speculating the % drop related to Bitcoin? If BTC prices go lower, i believe it would be good for Paypal because more customers will be putting their money in Bitcoin and others.Last few days move is more related to, to my opinion, the $50 gap up post earning and the market naratives for sell off in high growth stocks although i believe there are other absurdly valued stocks compared to Paypal. Institutions are creating panic mongering by their muscle power and eliminating all weak hands....thats it."
"Some stocks like Tsla and GME are 100% over valued, but how much it drags the whole market is a bit surprising."
"amazing how is is suggested to drop,,,,, I've seen this before and where the expert makes a claim so they can scoop it up at a lower price."
"Anyone believes PYPL will hit $300 next week, thumbs up"
Can we see 270 again before close
PYPL consolidation should be about over. Much pivoting on EOM holding losses. Expect a significant upward swing and lots of volatility in next 2 weeks. Small investors should be adding at this time. GLTA!
"Huge huge volume from institutions getting in around 171-172, looks like all the shorts and small player stop losses got triggered"
shouldn't have they preannounced this..if it is not a big deal..they sure kept it secret..
All time high very soon!!
why did CEO sell? Anybody knows?
the conference call
Isn’t the CFO supposed to be buying back shares? Still down 4% yikes
pop to 80 after conference call
I hope this goes to at least 86 tomorrow
A screaming buy at this level. Between now and EOY we hit $100.......IMHO
PYPL BLOWOUT earnings and beat on ALL cylinders and up guidance!!Yeehaw!!
15-30 year olds don't use banks much or carry cash. They use Venmo. Very sticky. Extrapolate. Users are only 80 million for Venmo. Will be 150 million by year end.
why is pypl not going up? bears sterns cramer screamed at us to buy pypl after it doubled in price.
"@LarryTheLegend bwahahah you are here? stop talking. for those who don't know this dude, he is the CEO of terribly wrong predictions. just ask for yourself, ask him what his prediction for NVDA was today. it ended terribly bad for him"
PayPal would be worth the same cap as MasterCard/ Visa in the next 2-3 years. Only weak hands would sell
Venmo use is surging.
all time high $200
"There you go Big losses, sell all those imaginary shares.."
I don’t understand why the stock price went up so much and the price of call options ending 4/27 fell? Any thoughts?
Just a traders market for now
"Good evening $PYPL family! Check it out. APWC Very high revenues for only a market cap of $80M, free float $3M, Stock price $5.90."
can't wait till Market close to see these numbers that I think should be off the chart if you short this stock you should get pounded into the ground
PayPal may be good option for really long term but it seems it’s gonna fall down under 200
"Vaccine's far from available as it must go through long period of FDA approval, so as usual could take several months or at least 1/2 years to be available for everyone.... buy today 's dip is a holiday gift...."
Missed the 164 dip
BACK UP!
Whats the story with Paypal on March 29 and do you see a chance of stock change because some people may be leaving paypal or locked out of accounts? If they do anything to PayPal business accounts that are making money right before Spring buying season it will be the dumsheet move of the century.
PayPal not always quick money but it will be money
So far so good!!!! Let's keep this up.
"Daniel Schulman already told you that PYPL benefits from the massive move of mobile payment, he also told that E commerce crosses the 50% line of the retail sales. So this morning when PYPL is down, I just step in."
"Now would be a good moment in time for Apple to buy this company and give ApplePay some wings. I'd keep the PayPal name, though..."
Great summary of Dan Loeb's 2Q18 Letter: long thesis for PayPal -- https://investoralmanac.com/2018/07/28/dan-loebs-2q18-letter-macro-outlook-paypal-emerging-markets-credit-update/
Snapback rally.
$100 soon
Looks like the last chance at <$300 shares. Yesterday was the shot across the bow as fair warning.
Earnings callhttps://www.investornetwork.com/company/C-CABCCD04C7D0E
Big = muted
Long term yes. With recession around the corner (next 3 years?) There are better stocks to own...
PYPL or SQ ?....WHICH ONE HAS THE JUICE ?
Traders on the floor are still talking about the market will move up. Financial and tech sectors are the most interesting that will move higher.
PayPal reached an all time high at 246.70
I called it would reach 90 before end of month when i bought at 82 3 weeks ago :) Very Happy!!! Will break 100 by end of next month!!! Review my notes!!!
SQ will touch 200 earlier than PYPL
equity markets are hyperinflated. the deflation will be epic. come on silver. buy under 16.5.
It'd be funny if we found out Musk used PYPL to buy the 1.5 trillion in Bitcoin.
"PYPL closing over 79 for the first time. New high or not, that's a great sign. Likely to move up to 80 on Tuesday. Momentum is back and traders are positioning themselves for another good earnings report. Should provide fireworks later in the month; uptrend solidly intact and the overall market still very bullish. More upside coming!"
"After seeing V earnings and guidance, I'm starting to get nervous over how PYPL will fare"
Does anyone believe that a major factor for PayPal to jump 8-10% on earnings release would be the number of new Venmo users? I realize they have not monetized it yet.
cramer said on lightning round he was talking to ceo of pypl today at some meeting if amazon will hurt pypl he ownes pypl does anyone now what cramer said thanks
Hop on the train mofos cause we ain’t stopping till we hit orbit 
Economic Collapse News - Cass Freight Index Reflects A Negative GDP Q4 2019
Beat by $1.
"Pretty soon its going to break $90, when that happens say good bye to 2 digit stock price, you'll never get it again under $100."
I have my long term position but I hope this gets crushed big and stays down at the open tomorrow so I can load up even more.
"1 month chart looks good, showing real strength"
"woulda coulda shoulda sold the last couple of days and throw it all in IQ!I've got some iq, but if I only sold my long term pypl holdings and put it into IQ!!!"
"Jan 26, call 85 premium is 16-20 cents expires today, tells me something that PYPL will hit 85 today."
We are back to 200's
Where is support guys?
PYPL down 6.6% in past month while NASDQ only down 2.3%. The thought of tougher competition is holding it back even though the financial news might be fine. I am going to hold for now.
PYPL price target raised to $90 from $85 at KeyBanc Capital!
"More and more positive articles has uploaded on Seeking alpha, which means buy buy Buy!"
Omg  someone paid $274? Omg 
Free money this price add more
Paypal better come up with some good numbers and raised guidance. Payment and Cloud stocks are in a slump.
"CITI, Bank of America, Chase.... PayPal Bank?"
$100 in a couple weeks
something is wrong with PYPL maybe we should all call investor relation to see whats up.
Get your shares now. Only 159.99.
"Really happy I sold the spike.... This sold off so fast. Was up so much early, now almost flat might turn red...."
Holding up nicely today
In since $42! Keep coming to daddy$$$
Anyone else surprised PAYPAL isn't higher by now? Recovery is slow here.
Too much of a reaction to the virus. You will be rewarded if you buy. That is just a simple fact.
What am I going to do with all this money!
PYPL literally never goes down. Long from $25.
"$TSNPD A $200 longterm investment in TSNPD will get you about 50 shares. Those same shares can someday be worth the same price as PayPal. Are you a dreamer? $200 into $12,000 challenge $PYPL"
Ark bought ~700K shares today. Woah
"this AHs pop is helpful. Wasnt there for AAPL or AMZN when they reported ER, so this is nice to see."
"Why Paypal will be amazing in 2021:1. the pandemic is far from being over.2. Paypal will start charging for QR-code payment.3. Paypal will start charging for buying, selling and holding crypto.4. Paypal will enable users in other countries to buy, sell and hold crypto."
BITCOIN POPPED to a NEW HIGH!!!!! Go PYPL!!!
"Anyone else notice that pypl always falls in the morning, and then rebounds after 11 or so? Seen this happen so many times."
why did i sell yesterday lol ah well! i'll get back in soon
"no big deal. 13% from ebay will be made up before 2023. keep loading, cheap price if it goes down."
"While I'm pulling for all you longs to gain good returns on PYPL ..... given numerous PYPL longs keep coming onto the SQ Board and spew FUD re: PYPL v. SQ ...... thus, I might remind them --- SQ resumes it's 4-5X return that of PYPL again today .... just like the last month, 6 mos., year & 2 yrs. --- DEAL WITH IT !!"
Ebay gave me a gift that is PYPL. What a gift!
PYPL earnings still going up. A good time to add to your position
Well I bought a few more shares at 255.50. I'll buy a few more if it drops to $253.I could be way wrong here but buying the dip sounds like a good strategy.
I am short as of today will ride this down 40%
ON THE WAY TO 192.50.............................
Exit... 85 is on its way
here we go! buying opportunity as pullback begins. good time to pick up some shares on broader market weakness.
I don't understand why pypl is always lagging behind shop or sq
"Been in contact with my family in Italy the past few months and discussed their quarantine and so, I had a bit of a head's up on what was to come here in the USA. I sold off a very large position in Paypal several weeks ago and now, so happy I did. Today, I considered where we have come (in the market overall) and decided to start to dollar cost average back into this monster. I stuck my toe back into PYPL with a $20K purchase just before the close. It may go down more but, at some point you have to start thinking proactively and ease back in. I plan general large purchases each week for the foreseeable future at this point. A year from now this horrible Market and epidemic will be nothing more than a bad memory. Stay strong and long friends."
Been a while since we finished red. I'm ok with that. still up over 12%
whats best to own pypl or v
Uptrend resumed. Was oversold. Also appears to be rebounding stronger than anticipated.
With all these meme stocks my 14 year old got interested in stocks. So I made a deal with him. I’ll put the capital up and he chooses the stock. We both look at the fundamentals to see if it’s a yes or no to invest. If I give a yes we split profits. It’s a good way for him to learn fundamentals and make some money. It also gives this old guy a sense of what the youth likes. It’s a win/win in my book. This was his first pick and he knocked it out of the ballpark.
EXPLOSION
Very oversold at these levels. When you look at this company its future cash flows are 8 times what they currently are. This is a no brainer. This will go back to 300 and then firmly take it out. The sky is the limit for this juggernaut.
Thumbs up if you think PYPL will close green today!
"Buy opportunity, as it's on a recovery and moving back up to prior highs. Added"
I think you will see GROW move towards $5 this next week! Move in and don’t be afraid to lock in profits :)
"When was the earnings date announced? Weeks ago? Why would it finally dump now right before earnings if outlook was bearish? Is this a shakeout before earnings, and price will soar after?The entire payment sector is down. SQ, V, MA. It's not just PYPL"
"“PayPal had another excellent quarter. New partnerships with American Express and Walmart will increase the value that we can offer to our customers. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to aggressively invest in innovation and growth, creating sustainable and long-term value for our shareholders,”"
Have to add here.Too much to like about PYPLGLA
No better financial company to buy load up
Thumbs up if you think there Will be a selloff the last week of December for the stock?￼
"okay folks, now this stock is getting interesting!! buy below 100 around 90 looks terrific"
This is setting up for a nice upward reversal after the ARK reallocation. Won't be long until we see another 30% gain and PYPL's crypto security acquisition grow confidence. I am less confident with SQ than PYPL... I would like to see a merger between the 2 if the FTC and DOJ would allow it. Talk about a mega FINTech to bury banks!
It's right at support. If it doesn't hold....
"What is the better buy: PYPL or GPN, and why?"
"Our economy is being TRANSFORMED right as we speak folks! Major changes are occurring such as 5G, cashless society’s, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, AI, etc. It’s STILL EARLY DAYS. In a decade PayPal, MasterCard, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and those others who help to build these networks will be worth so much more money. That’s why my money is in names like APPLE, MICROSOFT, MASTERCARD, PAYPAL, etc."
"Strong mobile engagement on PayPal's platform contributed to approximately $57 billion in mobile payment volume, growing approximately 45%. In the third quarter, mobile payment volume represented 40% of overall TPV. Venmo, the company's social payments platform, processed approximately $17 billion of TPV in the third quarter, growing 78%. On a trailing twelve month basis, Venmo processed approximately $54 billion of TPV.HUGE NUMBERS"
SHORTED 10K SHARES JUST NOW
If ARK Cathie Woods is involved with your stock in any way it’s going down 50%
"I can just say THANKS as I will buy your stocks, see u in 2 years then"
Up on a down day with strong volume. Very Bullish
Does PayPal not own hundreds of millions if not now billions in crypto? I think this the lagging play for crypto & their business just seems undervalued right now.
Of course it's cheep when it's going to 90$$$$$$
If only I had the funds to buy more paypal right now.. i feel like I’m missing out.
Earnings yep yep for this absolute TANK

"Get in now whilst you can, paypal is a quality stock"
BUY it when it is so red again.
PayPal is going to beat expectations today?
"zero discussion on worlds largest bank, DB, failing."
Bears Sterns Cramer is claiming PYPL must be bought and considers it a value stock. Jim's blood pressure appears to by abnormally high.
go on paypal!
Here is another payment system with huge growth: IIIV projects FY19 ending September of adj eps .79-.81c whereas SQ projects FY 18 adj eps of .39-.41c. Buying IIIV as I did SQ and PYPL much cheaper.
Supreme Jos lives in his parent’s basement- he is 32 not a person to take advice from.
the beatdown over at SQ is very entertaining and deserved...HAHAHAHAHA
200 days ma 83.59
"The chart experts were saying Paypal would go below 70, but as youc an see that has not happened. This company makes money and a valid challenger to Visa and Mastercard. In fast growing countries like India, they are skipping over traditional Merchant accounts are going straight to Paypal. There is a lot of growth ahead for innovative companies like Paypal."
Good time to buy V & Ma.Look at them the last few days.I noticed when money is flowing out of tech they just take off and when they start to fall money is flowing into PYPL and SQ.Trade accordingly.
I thinks its time to move some profits over to SESN...!
Larry you seem to be desperate man
massive numbers of stranded dip buyers. been falling ever since jim bears sterns cramer screamed at us to buy pypl.
300
Just waiting for this puppy to wake up. Boring action so far.
PayPal set for some good jump today
PYPL is going up!!
You think $SQ was the only one going on a run? I called this the juggernaut.
PYPL down on announcement by Facebook for new effort at fintech by launching their digital currency backed by real currency. I think Facebook will run into a lot of problems with their attempt.
The ritualistic push down just before earnings........... 90s post earnings?
Pypl is sitting quietly while the market rages knowing her turn awaits.
"Like I've always said, when can you ""Venmo me"" becomes a verb, you know you have something huge. Think about it."
Untouchable 
"I see everyone thinks the chevron deal is gonna push this and make an amazing ER, but it looks to be priced in. As the old saying goes, ""Buy the news sell the rumor""."
NEW APP to pay at gas stations - oh yeah this is going to the sky!
PayPUKE only down 20% this week. Nice steady stable investment longs!
eBay thinks the better terms they got from Ayden will pay-off. What they will find is weaker sales because people who use PayPal will shop elsewhere. The trade off will have a negative impact and I would down grade eBay to hold or maybe sell until results can be analyzed from this move. I think its a foolish move by eBay management.
"As can be seen the last dip was a buying opportunity, nothing structurally went wrong with this stock. This may breakout of the 80.00 dollar range this week as it's momentum is building."
The one stock i want today
buffet is selling his 7 shares of pypl today.
who is staying long pypl prior to the dumpfest next week? are ya not selling your realestate too?
"UH-O, here comes the “PALcoin” venture in to crypto..."
The day of earnings release. PYPL drops what a insult.
What ever happened to shorty The Legend? Banks are trying to find him
PYPL will be extremely bullish until the end of 2019!!!
89 tofay
It looks like $PYPL Paypal management is determined to transfer all Paypal cash into their pockets via Bitcoin Scam... A good method to rob the Corporation and investors! Paypal is buying Bitcoin because Paypal management and their relatives are holding thousands of bitcoins and they want to get quick rich!
$75 will look very cheap a year from today. Well I will be adding more shares yet again.
Good news for Paypal.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seismic-shifts-cryptocurrency-market-may-194512034.htmlWho thinks PYPL will reach 350 by end of year and 550 by end of next year ?
Inconceivable!
"“...Susquehanna’s Jamie Friedman notes that PayPal will now be free to court other retailers, including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.28% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -5.10% which it couldn’t do under the eBay deal. These would “dwarf the loss,” he wrote. Friedman rates PayPal’s stock at positive and upped his price target to $87 from $85.”"
PayPal owns Venmo. Venmo is catching on quick. Its time to buy
PayPal + Google. Nice
I could not have called it any better than I did on Sunday. Said we were poised to take off. How you like them apples Chuckie. Haha. PYPL is on da move!
I'm new to PYPL. Why is this down after hours after what appears to be a very good earnings report?
"TEUM Up 10% And GROW up 15% today. But who cares. These 2 will explode over 2018. You guys need to get in now. I’m being honest when I say this. PayPal will explode soon, but please start a position in both $GROW and $TEUM. I own about 12k shares in each :)"
"search: google.de: go to ""subsidiaries of PayPal"""
"Apple pay cash came out and I don't know if that's why paypal fell back today after a 2% pop, but it really doesn't affect paypal value going forward imo. venmo still growing faster"
"When the multi billion dollar sale of Paypal’s finance portfolio from earlier in the year to Synchrony Financial completes settlement in a couple of months, watch Paypal pounce with another huge strategic acquisition! Also when Paypal puts iZettle to the metal on its settlement, it’s number one position will be rock solid! Buy in now good people while the strategic manoeuvring is underway, or watch from the sidelines while we head to $100 a share and beyond by year’s end !"
Check out the insider sells. Very discouraging.
Why isn't this available on $PYPL for purchase yet? DOGE
60% of PayPal revenue comes from EBay. These analysts are playing games. No company in the world takes a 60% hit to revenue streams and get a overweight rating. Imo.

Just bought a little 500 call. Wish me luck
Where is the bottom so i can buy some more? Can this go down to $250? My average is like 184.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PURCHASE ONLINE USING PAYPAL THROUGH THESE SEVERAL HOLIDAY SEASONS TO AVOID COLD WEATHER OUTDOOR...FROM BIG COMMING UP STIMULUS CHECK FROM DEMOCRAT PARTY....
Why is this wonderful purchase still at 101?
This seems like a stock people sell for other stocks￼ That are trending I just hope they’re smart enough to return
The shorts seem to have a temporary period of control because of profit taking. They were spreading gloom and doom after the last quarters stellar earnings and trying to misstate facts about the company then. They will get crushed again as the quarter continues. There is no reason to believe that anything has changed fundamentally.
Back on track to hit $100 by July 1st.
"Wonder what kind of ppl would put BTC into their Paypal wallet and actually use it like a currency, for paying and receiving what goods and services?"
Last year 78 cents eps ($110 share price) for the quarter this year 66 cents eps for the quarter ($128 share price) what world does this make sense. Tread carefully
how high can paypal stock go? i bought it at 106.75 and it's down at 105...
I'm pulling the buy trigger at the open.
PayPal is up 5.70% to 266.25
Easy 90 tomorrow
Paypal will SMASH the earnings next week!!
"This stock still has a solid fundamentals with rock solid earnings. PayPal was hyped up little too much leading up to the ER and pullback was warranted although it was overdone. Unless we get some good news, this will hold between $85 to $90 until next ER."
Is this a better stock to hold than a MasterCard/ visa?
"SP/18, SQ was @ $100 for a week.MAR/19, PYPL hit $100 for the first time & now @ $145!Think I'll stay with PYPL"
earnings reduced half a billion from 2Q to 3Q ...I don't think the earnings will be half of 2020 for 2021...good company but stock is overvalued so is square....this needs to go back to 130 or 150 range
$90 this week
Do you all see the number on $155 sept puts. It traded 6000 contracts so far today.
Time for DIVIDENDS
"so where are all the upgrades at these fresh new lows? oh, thats right...bankster tools upgrade at near new highs. almost forgot about how wallscam works."
Anyone here old enough to remember when PYPL was $302?
"Been in since 17, just added a call at the dip because the vision is global and it benefits people. Thanks PayPal."
Nice 5 yrs from now another 200 percent
"In this current climate, good stocks that reported excellent earnings are slaughtered while fraud & bankrupt companies’ stocks soared due to trading. Don’t be silly & naive to sell in a panic but buy it to build your wealth for the long run."
Years of PAYPAL freezing accounts for whatever bogus reason. How is that working for yas?
Anyone else since $36?
PYPL going to be on Mad money later this week. Good sign for PYPL. buy today or tomorrow
PYPL should buyouts STNE while it’s still cheap
"why buy this, when you can buy TSNP?"
the bankers that are buying the equity markets have no risk in doing so as they are buying with money they have created from nothing...and they are fully aware of this fact. the retail/401 noob buying stocks well beyond any reasonable valuation bears all the downside risk and are being told to hold for the long term and do not fight the fed. it is this retail group that finances the entire charade by simply not harvesting capital gains. this is why bankers know that all gains are theirs to keep. the bankster has no problem whatever selling their entire equity inventory while the carefully trained retail investor can only think to hold and will only sell after all or most gains are transferred to the bankster.
imagine what a 1/2 point rate cut will do to pypl.
silver is still free. pypl is far away from being on sale. how are the jobless going to benefit paypal?
nice free shares for me
"Now’s the time to buy before PayPal starts rolling out a bunch of new products and services. I’ll say it again, this is the next trillion $ company."
Thx Pres Xiden economy
Anyone buying pYPL at these prices
Great conference call. Excellent guidance. You can sense the confidence in that room
Paypal is one of the biggest winners from stimulus that passed and any additional that should come.1) Paypal now allowing direct check deposits (including stimulus check deposits). Which will encourage more paypal (and venmo) signups and usage2) pair one with ability to buy and sell bitcoin3) people will use their newly deposited money to spend with the paypal and venmo accounts
Great news today who is sellingWe need to go up againBuy buy buy
Don't forget to vote No on executive compensation on the proxy for PYPL. It cost us too much money.
PAYPAL RAISED TO 135 AT BARCLAYS
Ahhh $teum Up another 1.5% today. Going to fly!!!
"What do we think for the coming week, can we hit 72-73?"
Pypl always lags behind shop and sq
Get ready for a fantastic year!!!!
I’m beyond bearish on this now. Cut my losses and now short
Stocks are at a point where if you sneeze too loud they drop. Everything must digest in the days and weeks after so that the algos to react accordingly. I say this helps the stock. I say 160 in 18 months.
BREAK THROUGH 80!
Numbers look strong. Stay long.
Does anyone REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?
There is nothing not to like about report.
Crumbling
PYPL just bought back 2.438 million shares.
Venmo revenue grew 70% and person to person to person revenue 50%.
If PYPL is doing digital payments it's going to double next year.
Yahoo message boards have made me over a million dollars this year. Thank you. I warned all of you this morning! I read 100 straight posts now this was going to $220 after earnings SO I shorted outright and bought puts when it was $192 this am. Hope to make 500%
"Time to squeeze the shorts is coming. I see at least 5-7 points up this morning. IBM is so so stock still can go up 13 points almost 9 %. Until yesterday 68 is over valued, today will be another story, It is as I guess, the management already telegraph the investors since last month, only the investors did not do homework enough. I TOLD YOU SO. 75 now is not expensive any more, also forget about overvalue too. By next quarter, I see PYPL around 80+. You will not PYPL at this point any more."
So close to all time high guys!
"Sweet, I’m adding another 20 shares tomorrow. I love market overreactions."
$200 coming..
"Uffffff. That wasn’t nice now was it. Market has to learn how to play nice with others, otherwise get sent to your room for a time out. It’s all part of investing amigos, you learn to just take it all in stride. Today we begin again our march to $80. No holding this baby down. Arriba!"
so you know what's better thsn 69? 79
"I love PayPal, I use it for shipping and ebay. I use Venmo every day. Great stock to own especially if you use the service."
"AUDC HERE WE GO, IT'S JUST STARTING! OFF GOOGLE CONTRACT 4 YOUTUBE CODECS, PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY DO, WHEN THEY FIND OUT KABOOM, SEP 45'S WAY TO PLAY IT, 90'S MAYBE 120'S BY THEN."
topped up
PYPL could be ready to move. I also just got a tip about them from (http://bestpix.xyz)
PYPL will close at $1.80 or above. Fridays $1.80 call option is active
I just saw Kevin routing through my trash... he must have heard pick-up is tomorrow on my street.
the minute Cramer said he was buying is the minute I started selling
PYPL for the long haul!
no way this goes up in this market. not a perfect report
B-E-A-UTIFUL!
Strong Buy!
Q2 2021 will be the quarter that determines future of company value. If they add 1/4 of customers vs Q2 2020 we go to $350/share That said my safety will be off and finger on trigger leading up to that earnings report
Went from 1% up to almost 4% down in a matter of 10 minutes lmao.
"pypl COO just sold 46,000 pypl shares."
"Option quote tomorrow, $88 put , expire August 27 . No bid , 5 cent ask . Haha . Those bought at 80 cent , it’s worthless"
PayPal reached an all time high at 170.90
Thanks again. I love PYPL under 80 from now on.
Looks like we have our base established and we can mount our assault on $125 from this level. Lot of wise guy money moving towards PayPal. Slow and steady has paid off well for DS and us shareholders. We really are in the sweet spot of Fintech.
Paypal should buy FDC / Clover as well.
PYPL going much higher
nailed it! thank you very much for dumping shares to me this week!!
"It's amazing to me how so many people think all of sudden the stock price will head back to the $90's after dropping to the low $70's only a week ago. Yes, they had a good earnings report. However when you have technical damage to the market and PYPL, it takes weeks of fighting resistance, backing and filling, and forming a new base to move up. I have no position and would like to go long PYPL, so maybe I missed my opportunity in the low $70's. But now with the good report, I think they will fade today's gap up and I can still buy in the high $70's maybe next week. I will say that Paypal is killing their competitor SQ, and it's funny to see SQ up this morning in sympathy with PYPL. PYPL is definitely the leader in this space, not SQ."
PYPL is oversold will rebound tomorrow . Always runs up before earnings Oct. 18th
Holding up pretty well
I'm out of PYPL for now. Just went all in on Disney.
"There seems to have been major manipulation in this stock. None of the news was bad, including the fact that Ebay would move on to Ayden in 2 years. As that opens up the world for Paypal. The company had record profits. Then the market collapsed two days later, because of fears that the economy is actually growing and interest rates will go back .25% more than expected. Some inflation is actually good for the economy as prices increase this is healthy. As this means wages are finally going up. It is long over due. It would be more of a concern interest rates stayed low longer. They still will be low by historical standards."
I think Yahoo raised the price target to 208$
Pypl longs have warned at least three times that the gains in pypl will not maintain. all buying is bank propping to enable the whales to exit longs and enter shorts.
"easy buy, 100 a share in 2018 is inevitable"
"It was 3 years ago that I thought very hard whether to make AMZN or PYPL my core holding.Analysts were all 100% for AMZN. I did the alternative, bizzarrely somehow. Today I'm satisfied.AMZN diehards must have been one frustrated furious lot for the last 12 months."
"Ebay news is a huge gift to paypal longs! take advantage and keep buying at discounted price. Paypal has a simple concept, no debts, and the younger generation loves using venmo = easy money!"
High growth stocks as PYPL are back in vogue after giving a great buying opportunity over the last days.
"It was a great quarter, story still right on track:https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/venmo-has-40-million-users-paypal-reveals-for-first-time.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
"PYPL is cheap now below 200. Load up while it's low folks, this is headed way higher in the long term. Take advantage while you can."
Did some news come out or did common sense just kick in? Either way this stock should be way UP!
BOUGHT MOREEEEE
new price target of 102. 125 if you ask 3rd point..lol
Everyone report Putin's comments as spam and he might get blocked
"between zelle being complete garbage and credit cards banning crypto purchases, only some more reasons to own PayPal"
"I have to say I bought 3 229 calls thinking it was going up, I was neive"
PYPL will open at a new high. now shows $96.44
Great news out that square got downgraded because of lack of growth. This should even boost stock price in my opinion for paypal because its likely paypal will eventually acquire it which would just bolster paypals potential in the market.
246 close
Don't forget to sign up for honey. It will look good when PYPL reports earnings on 1/30/20
This wants green today
Just can't get any respect. Has never really recovered from the ebay news.
Anyone buying on the close today? I will pick up 500 more shares
just added more to my holdings! I like both SQ and Paypal both will be huge companies in the future.
I put my tax refund(stimulus) to work. went to the slot machine and bought me some PYPL bitcoin. Supper ez.
PayPal reached an all time high at 127.51
Is this going to beat earnings or what
"Did some home work for you all...important to look at history:Q3 2017 EarningsDay of earnings report: 10/19/17Low: $66.16 High: $67.45 Close: $67.25 Volume: 14 millionDay AFTER earnings report: 10/20/17Low: $69.69 High: $71.73 Close: $70.97 Volume: 34 millionPercentage Increase over 10/19/17 close: 6.67%Q2 2017 EarningsDay of earnings report: 7/26/17Low: $57.90 High: $58.94 Close: $58.79 Volume: 13 millionDay AFTER earnings report: 7/27/17Low: $57.69 High: $61.30 Close: $60.15 Volume: 23 millionPercentage Increase over 7/26/17 close: 2.31%Q1 2017 EarningsDay of earnings report: 04/26/17Low: $44.25 High: $45.04 Close: $44.41 Volume: 10 millionDay AFTER earnings report: 04/27/17Low: $46.75 High: $48.10 Close: $47.15 Volume: 34 millionPercentage Increase over 4/26/17 close: 6.17%If we close at say $85.00 today and go up 4.1% at close tomorrow, that's a closing price on Thursday of $88.50; I'd be perfectly fine with that."
United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) clears its PayPal’s acquisition of iZettle. The CMA found that the merger of PayPal and iZettle does not raise competition concerns in the UK!This is only fuel to the fire!! $120 here we come!
AND..... WERE OFF & RUNNING!!
way to go PayPal....great growth.. what's that cut the P/E to now like 100?
At $270 I guaranteed PayPal would be RED by the close. Only down $15 since
"you can't sell now. you sell when it's green not red, buy when its red"
Consistently breaking resistance levels. The close is the test for $122.
Don't worry be happy everybody must remember that song... PayPal is a Strong company We'll see what happens this week Up up up away
"Been following this for awhile. If it drops below 80 in next few days, I'm loading up."
"I know I heard mention of share buybacks in the presentation, I'd love to hear the # if anyone knows."
Goldman joined the hundreds of payment systems today with a new card called Deserve for those without much credit history.
if it breaks the resistance it will fly
309 to 250 PayPal is R.I.P. I won’t ever use the service again just dropped the app and closed account
Clear sailing to $121 . Arriba!
"Relax. 5 more years with Ebay - and plenty of time to build new customer bases and grow Paypal.... this isn't a startup folks, it's a well-established professionally run operation. Price will bounce tomorrow"
PayPal going to $65-$70 easily. Possibly by end of the year
"Anyone care to share opinions on the continual and steep price drops of PYPL? To me... the notion that PYPL won't continue to grow and won't continue to profit (cause people will continue to spend money) and won't dominate (in cashless) doesn't match what's happening based on one analyst ""Head Wind"" alternate universe comment."
Target $130
Buy the dips not the rips
Regret not buying some pre-market :(
the force is strong in this one
ARK bought more PAYPAL.Too the moon........ monday.
Venmo launches its first credit card with scannable QR code and personalized cash-back rewardshttps://www.cnbc.com/select/new-venmo-credit-card-launches/
Always dropping just before earnings report. And I'll bet the increase will be 242 $ back to the way it way. That is why it drops just before earnings. It's all planned by the BIG BOYS IN SUITS. It's all #$%$ .
"Can someone please explain why is pypl down? Earnings is right around the corner, and it's still down after all of the good news. They even have a price target of $129. I'm not selling yet, I just need some insight"
Buy Baba for Ant Financial. 3x bigger
Almost 1 million shares bought in the last 5 minutes of trading  AVGO (Broadcom) had similar action... what happened?
"paypal, Hold strong, VENMO is worth the price alone!!!"
Red today? What a joke. What’s wrong with this stock?
"PYPL has been good to me, picked up shares in '16"
why selloffs prior close ?
Who sells here? Crazy to unload right now.
Great interview with Cramer. Jim anointed them thick de facto future winner in the digital payment arena.
My puts will print bigly tomorrow!!
The Legend
Should be trading at 170!!! she will get there in 6 months
Earning look pretty dark good to me.
Uber up 5%..
"Stop loss/limit triggers tripped apaprently. Someone fund or group made a major boof, is all I can say. Never let a machine (or blind janitor) manage your trading."
"If you look at the chart, you’ll notice there was also a broad based selloff in Oct which included a Pypl drop of about 10%. This time we have a drop of about 18% so far, which is disturbing, but the last correction lasted 18 days from top to bottom before resuming the upwards trend and we are now 16 days into this current drop, hopefully another correction. It’s healthy for the market, as long as it doesn’t transform into a panic crash. The trend line for Pypl is still solidly bullish, with a spike and drop ‘correction’ during February off a very bullish trendline over the last year that we are still well within on a slow stochastic basis... Nothing has fundamentally changed; the government is still printing money with a lot more to come very soon, we are still at near zero interest rates, and Pypl is still making money hand over fist on crypto.The scary trend is the treasury yield rising over the last few months, so we need to keep a close eye on that trend which can cause a panic selloff if this continues too long and that yield gets too high.I am not panicking. We should know within the next week or so whether this short term bear is part of a longer term bear or just a temporary valuation reset."
Consolidating before a breakout to new highs.
we just reached the 52 week high!!!Going Higher!!!Just hold on tight!
PayPUKE is going back to $25
Morgan Stanley comes out with great news for PayPal versus the other payment options. The news coming from the Christmas spending is robust. All around the thought is PayPal is poised for a new breakout and a new high. So what does PayPal do today? See red. Well after Feb. 1st all bets are off. This may be the last time investors have to get PayPal under $91.
Great company soon 220 stay long
I heard a rumor that PayPal will be buying Coinbase. Would this be good for PayPal?
"I shorted PYPL this week at 123 because I believe our economy will continue to come up short for several months possibly a year or two. Unemployment will run above 10% and spending will be decreased for months. I agree PYPL is a good company, but it is presently at it's highs and is ripe for short sellers."
I guess the CC is helping a tad.
Here I am once again. No better time to sell PayPal for any profits one might have and move to SQ for better growth and you will be able to get more shares. SQ will print $100 a second time before PYPL prints $100. Chuck hunter anonymous bill dennis?
"Great Friday morning so far, coming up on a year owning this next month and very happy with my gains."
"Great Balance Sheet, All time highs in On-line purchased since onset of the pandemic, this should be $200 after earnings!To the moon "
We will break 90 on eps announcement.
Pay pal beat! BOOYA
New 52 week High!!!
PayPal Rocks
Let’s see some green . Come on mr Franklin . $100
partnering with Walmart is more impactful than partnering with Amazon because of customer volume where PYPL is applicable.
Got another 50 shares at 72.20
The Dropping of Bit-coin will downgrade PYPL to $180.Sell now.
Just another miserable day to be long PayPal just agonizing over all the taxes I'm going to have to pay.
Buy BFT merging with paysafe
chance to buy this cheaper!!!!
"$PYPL is getting PUMPED, despite subpar earnings, and fabricate revenues....What a TULIP MANIA BUBBLE!"
Who bought $207 this morning? Raise your hands. Will be $177 easy today!!!!!
As for share buybacks..... drop that hot mess and start dividends instead. The buybacks should have started immediately and had ALL of the buyback done when it was first announced. Now shares are too high and it would do better for all to start dividends. Why dividends? Then Paypal shares can be purchased by the many dividend funds!
we are back @$90 soon
230 coming
Closing in the green?
"No matter which plastic card companies shoppers are using, they keep shopping for bargains, but put payment plans in the back burner. Bullish on Pypl, Ma, V and Axp."
Uber up 5%. Where are the haters?
Going to sell portion of PayPal and buy Apple to balance my portfolio. Good time to do it or I am making a mistake?
William that lady done with her tune?
PYPL on 
This train isn't going to stop onward to $300...
PayPal...over 200 transactions per second. We need this to pass Visa at over 1600 per second.
Earnings call is for damage control. Give us higher expectations so our stock and go up again
This is trading all of the way down to early 2018 prices. Oh wait...it’s still early 2018.
Remember ebay only accounts for a small portion of their transactions. Only 13% and its getting less and less. Also the deal isn't over until a few years later.This also frees up paypal to make a deal with amazon or alibaba!
77.77?!! OMG!! What a number!

"DOGE crypto is running today! Up over 50% for the day over 400% this week, lots of media attention check them out."
"Here we go, up 5 bucks"
But PayPal barely beats estimate and provides inline forecast. What happen to stock price? It's hard to predict and definitely not on fundamental. Although it's much better than Tesla fundamentally.
"The Ant IPO is expected to work favorably for the digital payments and fintech industry, so PYPL is expected to get enhanced investors’ attention post the IPO. PYPL has gained popularity among the masses during the pandemic, as the focus is radically shifting to technology-oriented services.

im in this for the long term but its getting really annoying that they can't hold 90 and square is blowing us out of the water
Don't sell we will see this to 250++++
Analysts price targets will need to be raised. Could get some price targets to $150+
"david, did ya sell at 120 after jim cramer told ya to buy his bank's pypl shares?"
Inching closer to that $200 price! Love it.
BREAKING OUT!
reminds me of old blowoff tops. but in this market blowoff top is just normal price action.
the start of a double bottom reversal? I think so!

losing money everyday the market hits new highs. Don't think I'm cut out for investing
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares are trading higher on Monday after Evercore reportedly named the stock its top 2021 payment pick.
Any idea why PYPL is down today?- Visa is down as well but not master card and not square. Any info anyone?
CEO sounds very positive. You can hear it in his voice.. Just my opinion.
Breaking News fellow longs! PaySafe is going public via spac-BTF Expect a run up in the following weeks. CNBC's Steve Grasso said Friday after close that BTF will double or triple. Only at $14Check it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0BC7uaViAs&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision
$90 on earnings
"Wait till all those free $1400 checks, and the kids all buy crypto on PayPal, rocketing up"
Lets end above all time high
Anyone actually looked at the earnings expectations?The bar set very low.Not exactly difficult to beat and with Venmo and delay of income from last report projected in the next quarters you have higher expectations next year which translates into some very big positive catalysts.
Load up the shares if it drops below $70 tomorrow or Friday. There will be impact due to EBay news in the short to medium term. As a long term shareholder it’s a big surprise. Need to ride the wave :-(
"It's glaringly obvious now all the stars are perfectly aligned for PYPL, by chance or by the executives' brilliance.1. The democratization of money started few years back (as Dan Shulman described it last year).2. Crypto mania3. Pandemic sends everyone into internet tradingThe only pitiful part is that when things had become so obvious, the price almost certainly had already shot up at least 500% - 600%. Even more pitiful, invariably stock analysts start frantically recommending it NOW. Who needs an analyst at this point???"
ouch! 15% drop in 1 month
Only small amounts AH/ Guess it can still go both ways. I expect UP.
PYPL is awesome!
SQ to 100 before PPYL

I keep saying it’s not PayPal vs Sq. Both can thrive and are solid assets in a long term portfolio. GET SOME!!!
Trolls work overtime on this board. Save your bashing. PayPal is in charge.
Buy a company or pay us some dividends
And as usual the aftermarket crowd sell-off on good news...so predictable..
Do you think i should invest in this?Thanks

UPDATE: PayPal profit triples as pandemic drives continued surge in online payments
Hell of an intraday reversal. $285 begining of pre market to $302 and back to $285. My guess is profit taking because of Bumble's IPO.....not to mention the parabolic move the last few days

"Obviously a great company who smashed their earnings report. But there are still concerns about big things: (1) peaceful transition of this administration needs to happen. If Drumpf were to finally give his concession speech it would be a boost for PYPL and markets. (2) coronavirus cases are spiking to record levels and this could cause more restrictions; this should help PYPL stock but might not. (3) stimulus bill is going to be heavily debated/delayed causing potential economic damage and market selloffs, especially if bill is pared down from the market's expectations."
paypal should break new high today
"Just read an article on moneygram being blocked by the courts. I've always wondered why people paid large sums to send money, when you can do it for free with PayPal. Don't want this whale too big, hackers will be all over it."

Would have been $110 by now had the ebay news not taken place. Glad it is finally hitting new highs. Maybe it can put that behind it now.
"PayPal stock named 'best idea' at Wedbush, price target raised to $100By Emily BaryPublished: June 8, 2018 8:45 a.m. ET 0 Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri added PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -2.28% to his firm's ""best ideas"" list on Friday and raised his price target on PayPal's stock to $100 from $90. With the price-target increase, Katri becomes one of the two most bullish analysts tracked by FactSet. ""We believe ongoing/recent monetization efforts on both consumer and merchant-facing platforms, Visa V, -1.79% /Mastercard MA, -1.81% /banking partnerships, as well as post-eBay EBAY, +1.25% separation potential opportunities could potentially accelerate top-line growth, while expanding margins,"" Katri wrote. He thinks the company's recent iZettle acquisition ""significantly boosts the company's merchant-facing monetization effort"" and predicts that PayPal's Pay with Venmo initiative will gain more momentum. Shares of PayPal are down 0.4% in premarket trading but up 53% this year, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% has gained 14%."
"PYPL reports earnings on 7/29, my guess is $.91 instead of $.85. Stock goes up $4 or $5 dollars. What are your thoughts"

"PYPL revenues set to double in the next three years so why the sell off. I going to be a buyer here - wanted to buy before but just wouldn't dip enough to make a good entry point. Down a good 10%, that's good for me - thank you all for selling! No PYPL doesn't speculate on Crypto coins and that's good. I mean they should pay attention to their core business and grow it. I wouldn't want to own any business that speculates with cash on hand and cash flow - that belongs to investors in this space. Want to speculate in Crypto go get your own digital wallet and knock yourself out. shareholder money belongs to all on board not to just a few."
"""This time PayPal officially completed the acquisition of 100% of Guofubao, and then we will see what kind of waves this international payment giant can make in the Chinese payment field.The analysis believes that there is no doubt that entering the Chinese financial market is a large-scale expansion of PayPal. This move will bring a lot of great opportunities, especially considering the speed of market growth.By 2023, China's payment market is expected to grow by more than US$96 trillion. PayPal now has the opportunity to enter this gold mine and secure a piece of their cake.It is worth mentioning that e-commerce plays an important role in China's financial market, and the demand for e-commerce is also growing. Most e-commerce providers are located in China, and the market is benefiting from the large number of transactions that occur every day.""

"just a thought....why Paypal is not partnering with big retailers like walmart, Costco or Target or Amzn.....I know most of them payment partners in place but getting someone like Walmart or Amzn where online purchases have skyrocketed and will continue to boom post pandemic makes perfect sense.

"PYPL should go up today again, which surprises me a lot. I don't understand the market. CFO of PYPL told media yesterday that PYPL raises the earnings to 52-59 cents that is over 30% from the estimates, which is a lot, plus the revenue will increase more than estimates. It is really amazing estimate raising. PYPL may pull back if the market is bad which I believe. But the market keeps telling investors not pull the money out because the bull market is not finished yet till the end of the year."
This is like Microsoft & Apple discussion in the 80’s. Both Square & PayPal great companies. Buy both...
"As an $EBAY shareholder in 2015, I received 400 shares of $PYPL in the spinoff. Still holding all of those shares in both companies. Let your winners keep winning..."
I'm confused. Don't know if I should sell or buy?
Up over a dollar in early trading. I sense new highs coming very soon.
"It is fluctuate, it is violent, the stock itself is the one, which the day traders do not touch. It is manipulated by some big boys, the volume tells it all that some hedge funds try to stop "" BREAK OUT "", the other side tries to create the 'BREAK OUT "" SCHEME. The stock itself deserves to break out because the market seems to explode."
PayPal in 2021 will be second only to Bitcoin in performanceand return on investor equity. PayPal will overshadow TSLA.
Starting to pick up! Possibly more good news coming. Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust will have egg all over his face!
PayPal is more than a peer to peer app. They are making acquisitions to move into other businesses. They are more like the Amazon of payments and finance.
this will be green come tomorrow!

"Venmo just released debit cards. And in the last two months PayPal has acquired interest in several strategic companies. This is one of the few tech stocks that has been under looked despite tremendous growth. This is great news patient investors. But remember to always keep some dry powder to take advantage of broader downturns like today. I added more PYPL shares, and will add even more if there is further significant selling."
Told you PYPL is going to explode!️️️
buy buy squeeze the short players
"Whoever bought on the dip, good insight on your part and not given in to selling like some of these people that don't need to be in the market."
If there was ever such thing as a safe haven stock. This is it.
Even if the earnings are great no way can SQ come back in the green after tomorrow
Thin volume and going sideways. What is happening with this stock today?
Cheers to this afternoons buyers.... here's hoping we'll all be toasting a great earnings result very soon !

"PYPL is very overvalued for some investors, but they are the same people that did not understand the internet in 1999, or so they claimed. Yes, these large investors, only can make money if they have information, by ""talking"" to the C.E.O.'s of companies. For them this is a matter of opinion, they will tell you that in the 1950's and 1960's insider information was not even looked into, so for them the culture continues and they old boy network makes sure they don't go away to prison. So PYPL for such investors is not going to be a lucrative trade, as they make money in one go, and advise the rest of us to buy and hold. The only way to make money like this is to create targets. They make money by having a definite result, and fight against momentum as part of their plan. In the near term they will bash PYPL because it the lowering guidance though not even significant was done at the earning conference. It is even suspicious why hypothetical guidance that to of 1% would be stated. It seems a window was created to lower stock prices on purpose. But after this, PYPL will continue to be more profitable and of course buyout more competitors. In the short term the stock may test 95 or even 90 but then it will bounce back to 110 and above. Hopefully enough investors can see through the smoke and realize that growth story does not end simply because of 200 billion in tariffs on a 14 trillion dollar economy. Again this is not even 1.5% of China's G.D.P. And this is done at a full 25% of all of China's exports to the U.S. the real amount will be less even at full scale trade war. So perhaps a pattern of manipulation can be seen very clearly."
PayPal is being replaced around 2020 by EBay in favor of a European Company based in Amsterdam called Adyen. Adyen is not traded as I could find yet but im sure it will when put in that position with EBay. PayPal will still be offered by EBay but the primary method of payment will be Adyen. look for price of EBay to rise as this transition becomes a reality.
Cathie Wood's Ark Invest bought another 184358 shares of PYPL yesterday
Slow grind to $100 a share in 12 months.
"""Why wasn't the share buy-back completed in the past Quarter?"" Answer -- PYPL Mgmt. realized the share price was too high and would prefer to buy shares back in the low $70s .... fair value is another 15% lower."
"Buffet, $BABA ‘s alt financial and $WMT heirs chose to invest in $STNE and not $PAGS , why is that? $PYPL should buyouts STNE"
BUY BUY BUY!!!!
Cathie Woods been adding PYPL on her ETF funds daily. She must think PYPL a jewel? 
"Why are the little wimps selling off?PYPL, is a $350 stock per George Eastman.We are buying more."
"The annual investor meeting is on May 23rd at 8 AM Pacific Time. We can expect to hear more about the acquisition details and their plans after eBay. The PayPal CFO said yesterday that they actually expect to make more profit once they are no longer tied to eBay. If you were planning to sell any shares in PayPal, I would recommend holding off until the annual meeting. For me, this company is a definite buy for the long-term."
PYPL SQ and SHOP will all be big winners. Visa and MasterCard are as well but too big for my strategy.
"PYPL: $105, SQ: $150, TLRY: 550."
"Facebook doesn't do anything unless they can make money doing it. So, their necessary profits on top of the complicated financial system they are trying to create and all their partners, who also need profits, and systems and reporting requirements spells expensive to me."
"Bought some yesterday. Now, let's go to $250 - $300. This earns more than NVDA."
"@William @Dennis @Tom, you still there? Down 7 points in two days ouch!"
Easy to swith to Ebay cash management AND cheaper
Imagine where this oinker  would be if the Dow weren’t up 600? $130?
shall we see 255...........
"Talk about share manipulation. I constantly hear about how banks/mutual funds/insiders/ ect. are manipulating the stock to go higher for us ""suckers"" but its strangly quiet when the stock price is manipulated the other direction. Case in point is today's Paypal price. Not much negative news for PayPal stock price to go down. In fact, the OPPOSITE. Uber up over 3.6% today. What about MecaroLibre? Glad you asked up over $6.50 dollars a share price. Great news right? Wrong, if you look at Paypal's stock price today youd surmise just the opposite. Terrible manipulation!"
it will pop 10 points
ppl wil realize in the end. its a gift that this price
I want some opinions for AXP/V/MA/PYPL or should I buy all lol
"Paypal, Square, and Tencent oh my what a day !!!"
Rob take a day off please. Your comments don't relate to PYPL.
"per ceo - rev $21.5b to $50b by 2025 (20% cagr), earnings 22% cagr, $40b fcf, double users, triple payment volume by 2025...marketwatch article"
89.50 close.
Buy the dips for Investors Day tomorrow !!!
What do you think of PYPL for tomorrow?
Every stock message board has a NATE . . . Trying to get you to sell your shares !
"Who gets to $1000 per share first, pypl or sq?"
Will go up tomorrow in Europe
Wow!! nice going... So big sell off tomorrow?
"The sky is the limit for PayPal. The most popular online payment system during a pandemic, owns Venmo, and is now collecting fees from many new crypto investors. I see a big surprise on this earnings report."
PYPL is breaking out! I love this stock!
"buy pypl, one of the best to buy- very good analysis https://prwirepro.com/2019/01/06/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-technical-analysis/"
Short on Paypal? what do you think?
"Shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) tripled over the last three years, driven by increasing user engagement and the addition of more than 100 million new customers since separating from eBay in 2015."
Stay long and strong gang
"If it hovers around $265 by 11it can go either way. Hold on until 11. I think being Friday and weekly option expiration, they'll keep the price around 265 today. They won't let it pass 270 until Monday."
"This price is ""NUTS""! Why? Because even after debt for acquisitions PayPal still will have at least over 8 BILLION in cash! That is nearly a 10% cash to share price ratio! This is starting to shape up as a potential acquisition target for one of the FAANG's, IMHO!"
a good target to short ... the charge fee is too high ... 0.65% for wechat ..
Who the hell is DZ Bank?? It's a German bank. This is the first time Ive ever heard of them upgrading or downgrading a stock for all the years Ive been in the market.....which has been several
"ADP, insures even more dovish Fed for longer than the already far range foreseeable future. PYPL Add here."
I'm sticking with PyPal. Even the name is friendly. What the F does Adyen mean?
Nice little pullback to add me some more shares. This company is a money making machine. Long and strong and hold for 5+ years.
"ER is around the corner, this is going to be fun!"
Hey Terry Smith...did ya buy SILVER under 15? Still holding PYPL? Oh dear.
who is electing to not sell these high priced banker gifts?
The world is paying with their pals.
SHOW ME THE BREAKOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Big ol' volume
It’s flat for 3 days after going from 77 to 108 and people start whining lol. Go find a safe space to cry
"I am planning to trim my $PYPL position soon, hopefully around $225/share. I have 700 shares, where the first 100 I bought @$35 in 2016. Planning to reinvest those profits to dilute my over-concentration in PayPal and will diversify in to AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and CRM.I am thinking that the Q3 earnings should be stellar, but the price has been very stagnant for years, aside from the March 2020 - Sept 2020 surge.What does this forum think about $PYPL?"
Thinking about getting PYPL tattooed to my chest. If we hit $300 by years end I’ll wrap Venmo around the rib cage.
Have a good thanksgiving gang. We move to $100 very soon
Wouldn’t be surprised to see $PYPL make new 52 week highs today or tomorrow!
"Hold it guys, rumour said it's $PYPL and this will go to moon soon."
"I would be happy to pay for anything on line right now, PYPL long and strong."
"the grapevine folks tell me massive numbers of paypal customers (ebay and other sellers) are dumping paypal and signing up for merchant accounts. Yo paypal, how is that account freezing going for yas?"
that fake taxi company...uber...just hurts to look at.
"Some more things to like about PYPL in case you aren’t satisfied: 44 percent gross margin, free cash flow by itself is nearly enough to cover the debt, and net cash is 4 times the debt. What’s not to like here?"
It will move up to $120.0 for sure with such a good earning and growing company. Hold and don't sell for now in a long term.
Earnings report expected to be way above projections. Global digitisation is in overdrive! PayPal reaping the benefits
"I think PYPL will test high by next week. If big boys push PYPL to new high before earnings report, PYPL has a good chance to hit 85 very easy. PYPL will beat the estimate of its own."
$90 by Christmas
coming to a stock market near you: limit down days.
pypl buys browser extension for $4b. please tell me this is a joke.
IS not red now. Sold for a quick day trade @ 79.50. Very happy.
There is Harold. Shorting a stock and then crying for the hills trying to scare people and get them to jump ship and sell. He does this all over guys. Don't let him scare you.
"“The potential market size and growth opportunity for Paypal is mind-boggling. After taking the China market and Amazon’s share of the global market out of the picture, KeyBanc estimates that Paypal can capture about two-thirds of all incremental global e-commerce dollars.” "
All my AMZN transactions are through PYPL. It isn't like they are one and not the other.
So glad I have such a big position in PayPal from a year ago and have years to watch it grow!
"PYPL eyeing StoneCo ltd is possible reason for Buffets interest in PYPL. Considering Buffetts substantial investment in StoneCo and increased interest in FINTech, this may be setting stages for eventual future PYPL-SQ deal. The answer to where crypto fits in may be in each company’s vision statements Just trying to put the puzzle together."
I think we may have to fill the trench again. I still have confidence that PYPL will move to 86 + on Wednesday.
A great company and a grow potential. It enters into Chinese market with a great earning report. It should rise from this point!!!
This Wallet Investor and many others state regarding this wonderful stock from Friday's closing: 1 year PayPal Holdings Forecast: 450.493784 * 5 year PayPal Holdings Forecast: 1501.80
if PYPL can add 1 billion in revenue then the price should be trading around 360 given current valuations
PYPL’s monster quarter should be a cue for investors to also load up on SQ prior to their earnings as the results are likely to be quite similar. Have made multibaggers in both names since March.
PYPL should finish today up over $230 - I anticipate $250 by the end of the year. Crypto plus the pandemic will propel this stock to new heights.
"Did anyone see on CNBC explaining how PayPal could be next Reddit trading action. There's a video and the man explaining said it needed to reach $300. But at close it was like $289.19. And finally after hours at 6:02 pm est. It reached $300, I don't know if it will fly but just was wondering if anyone saw the video. If so can you post it? Also I would like a more detailed explaination of what the man was saying. It was on yesterday 2/11/2021 on that show right before Mad Money. I thought it was strange they barely covered Pay Pal activity today, I mean it was up $11+ most the day today. That's news worthy. Thanks to anyone who can help post the video. Please post it on the main page and in comments here too. Thanks."
PayPuke was $25 a few years ago who is buying 290 now? That’s not investing it’s a ponzi
End of day run up. $62+ after ER beat.
So why have pre-market if this happens +2.50 open markets down 2.50.
"Absolutely no reason for drop, holding steady"
Got out at 77 god bless 
$300+ by Investor Day announcements this Thursday
SELL PayPal now and Buy SQ LAST CHANCE!!!
PayPal bitcoin exposure is becoming a problem. It could be worthless in a Cyberwar. Also the original coding is suspect since it could have been developed by rogue elements.
There is nothing normal with this market smh
Consolidation/Speculation and profit taking. Still looking at 212 by EOW and accumulating.
"Paypal 'll be falling like rock as soon as more and more covid-19 vaccines rolling out across usa and worldwide, when shoppers are safe to shop at stores...no need online shop anymore....and so they 'll all withdraw their accounts from Paypal...."
Shorties
What happened during the call?
Poor people who sold off yesterday
I think I will buy more pYPL tomorrow
"Cathie Wood has been a train wreck lately. She panics, over trades and is stubborn to keep dumping money in some highly speculative plays, that may never have sound earnings or any earnings.It look easy for her when everything was irrational in her favor. I am really surprised at how much she flips in and out of money as a fund manager. She is worse than an over caffeinated day traders.Not good. Her funds are suffering. Seems like a nice lady, but she needs someone in her organization to offset her snap reactions.WOW!$PYPL here long and strong.Very Bullish"
well...let see...er beats both top and bottom...reversal tomorrow...200+ before end of month...heck even possible seeing it tomorrow...
PayPal is down 4.92% to 202.58
Venmo and Honey are the future. Years of upside ahead
PayPal has turned into dead money. About ready to bail. Stuck at $90 give or take a couple bucks for months.
"Record bull run for e payment companies . The secular trend is there. i like Paypal, but even more bullish for payment company Qiwi that i can buy below its cash holding value that even grow faster with multi channels. Qiwi has strong balance sheet without debt and growing double digits with key instituation holders and major bank as shareholder."
"Some body drops over 700,000 shares on PYPL, so it pop up right away."
free money will not end soon. the free money party is just getting started. too few stocks and too much money = pypl to 300
$220 year end
wish I have sold house and bought more PYPL
Why is it there are no comments about Izettle’s results?
Markets are the reason for the price drop.
"Picked up 200 more shares of PYPL. Earnings due out on 2/3 expect to report $1.00, I think $1.14 or more. What do you think"
"Economic Collapse News - Baltic Dry Index Crashes 80%, Chicago PMI Plunges Deep Into Contraction"
It seems like I use PayPal more and more these days. I paid for airline tix yesterday with it. Nice to see popping up as all over.
Still up over 8%.... You can't blindly ignore performance for too long.
"K-BOOM! Added a few hundred more this morning. Figured its my last chance under 200. Buying for me is done, now time to sit back and enjoy!GLTA"
"ESTIMATE IS 52 CENTS, WHISPER IS 54 CENTS,THE FAR EAST NUMBER IS 61 CENTS."
PYPL & CODX tomorrow 
Lets go back to 300!!!Go PYPL!!!
Bought in an hour before ebay news. It feels good to be here finally
"Ill sell half my position going into earnings tomorrow and keep the other half and wait. PYPL is still expensive so it will have to really hit it out of the park to keep it from dropping, albeit temporary."
When do you think PYPL will hit 1000$?
$PYPL Gets PUMPED by 15% a few days ahead of ER and then another 6% Stok price PUMPING after ER???Explain this MASSIVE BUBBLE!
"Stated reading a fantastic book called Thank you for being late, Tom Friedman and about 1/3 of the way through. He walks you through the beginning of the Internet, where we were, where we are and where we are going. And how the speed of all this is at breakneck levels as Murphy’s Law now applies to all aspects of technology. Two companies that he especially singles out are PayPal and Autodesk as being especially well positioned as we move forward. Both are in the sweet part as per where we are heading. FWIW"
Seems like all tech stocks fell a lot. Which one is most likely yo get back to their all time high first?
now the VP Pence is demanding rates be cut. Imploding economy plus rate cuts = massive stock rally.
"Anyone who says this is a dotcom bubble has no clue what they are talking about. The valuations in the dotcom bubble were outrageous because there weren’t numbers to back them. These companies have numbers, they show growth, and strong future growth."
"Just want to point something out. Since posting earnings, PayPals PE has DROPPED. If you were buying PayPal the last few months then you were paying a HIGHER MULTIPLE for it! Keep in mind that PayPal also RAISED GUIDANCE! Given all this I expect the PE to rise back into the low 100s!"
Earnings estimate is $0.52 per share while earnings whisper is $0.55 Options also has a 6.2% move priced in after earnings.
this is getting too cheap...
PayPal to Reportedly Offer Crypto Trading Through Paxos Partnershiphttps://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-to-reportedly-offer-crypto-trading-through-paxos-partnership
This here PayPal...its so hot
Paypal will benefit from Black Friday. How?1. Black Friday means huge spending.2. Most of the sales will occur online as this is the safest way due to the pandemic.3. Online shopping specially on Black Friday is very sensitive to scam. Paypal offers protected purchase and it also hides your credit card infomation.4. Paypal will gain new users from reason 3.
#PYPL Looking good for higher prices. Long over 92.35. Target: 107.86 at stoxline.
"Good stock like PYPL will not go down much, I have a believe that PYPL will price around 78-80 before earnings report unless the market collapses. I think the market will pick itself up because of the bond sell off. The stock will have a big bang of earnings for the next two quarters."
PayPal reached an all time high at 162.50
"I started watching last thurs when it was 208. Now 230, should I wait for a dip to buy?"
"The Motley Fool article does not specifically state Buffet is considering an acquisition in PYPL, rather he “should consider” PYPL... “But some shareholders have been critical of the Oracle of Omaha for not investing more in the two halves of digital payment duopoly Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) instead of his longtime favorite American Express (NYSE:AXP). In addition to other bets on the future of consumer and business transactions Buffett and company have made, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) could also feature prominently in the Berkshire investment universe.”"
"PayPal is the bank of the future, buy!"
PYPL goes up at open and then falls for the rest of the day. Let’s change that
I love me some paypal. but wasn't that quite an expensive aquisition. like the guy below me said 13 times revenue seems like alot.
"It is rotation again because the retails , banks are in green. Tech sector just pulls back a little, but as soon as the house votes, it should come back again. I don't think the big boys will back out 2 quarters ahead. You just have to understand all the FANGs are near high, so give back a few points should not worry much, particularly PYPL, which is still higher than Oct price. The price range should be 75-78 by first week of Jan.and wait for firework on earning date."
Down againBuying more before closing bellIts going lower
"you can miss earning but just say something positive and it will go all-time highs pypl, sq, uber,ba, on and on it makes no sense. its all ragged"
It will retest 80 again needs to break through it before week End.
"Dan Schumann, CEO of PYPL, will be on CNBC tonight-with Cramer, who says the stock is cheap at this price!"
Shake out. Sorry...not falling for it. Think I'll add another 100 shares...thanks.
nearly all that i know are coming out of the equity markets and going into money markets regarding their 401k. following buffet's lead.
Tested $86 but couldn’t hold. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it test $86 again. For sure tomorrow.
"Next week is the 3rd year anniversary of the IPO. Should be in the $88, maybe $89 range. Week after is earnings and that is when the stock may hit $92."
"I made a correction on my first post but am not seeing it, merchant services charged me $700 not $70, thats more than 4 times less that SQ I had the same sales, maybe more in my second month. it was 0/interchange plus for anybody wanting to get it."
"PYPL is now benefiting from India's freelance economy and in the path of Modi's push towards digital payments (demonitisation). According to MoneyControl, 74% of India's freelancers use PYPL for transactions.https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-india-betting-freelancers-fuel-080206329.html"
VENMO HUGE !!!!
running to 85 by Friday Dooooo it! dooooooo it!
"There is no denying what we are seeing right now. Yields are falling faster than we can even imagine. $15 trillion worth of negative yielding debt is now out there and it's going up in a straight line. This is NOT, I repeat NOT a sign of a healthy economy. So what will happen? Well, something is going to break. Where? No idea. But when there are unknowns, that doesn't mean you should be complacent. It means you should prepare accordingly. The mentality of most novice investors is that they remain complacent and docile. Not a wise move."
Let's call Jim Cramer [Mad Money] 1800 743 2622 and get his thoughts on PYPL
Just bought more for the fourth time and reached my goal of 1000 shares with an average price of 82.64... I now have 1000 shares of PayPal and Alibaba. Both will have earnings announcements in less than 17 hours. God bless to us all...
"look at the market the past week. been rough, a sea of red. now look at paypal. The stock of steal standing firm"
I use PayPal everyday BUT I am short the stock hugely
Buy Buy Buy !!! This will be green !! its all about crypto and vemo....you just need to buy and hold....by tomorow 4 pm..its gonna be 200+
PayPal isn’t going to be parabolic like square. Thats why you trade square and invest in PayPal. PayPal isn’t in its prime like SQ.
Morgan Stanley expected a EPS of $0.94....so that's a huge miss.Hence tanking
Buying at $80
"BTW they added QVC, dillards, and DISNEY to companies that accept paypal now!"
Way undervalued at current price$500 in 3 years
why amateurs are even selling at this point is beyond me. it hasn't even made it to the daily average yet -_-
Your on Pypl site pumping a $2.19 cent apto stock??
If there was a bounty on lawyers how much should it be? The bounty on coyotes out west is about $25 but a coyote is worth a whole lot more than a lawyer.
only 1.7M shares traded in AH? Where is your conviction longs?
It will take at least another 3 months until a vaccine is officially approved so the online shopping party is not over yet.And the end of covid will not affect Paypal alot as consumers are already accustomed with Paypal payments. This trend will continue.
Banjo and MasterYokel.... rather you worry about SQ who’ll be taking the elevator down soon like FB is after hours at present : 20% down...
"Great company - great stock. Unlike Amzn now, which is a great company but stock is dead money."
after hours price movement is a bit sleepy 
Can we close above 90 today
$400 we go
Just bought 789 shares (my lucky no ) cos of bitcoin and Jim Cramer. Hopeful 
Near zero rates through 2023 and a booming economy equals another bull run
This is a stable company. It will reach $100.00 for sure.
I want to see $90 by EOD!
"Insane to trade this stock. Like the old adage says “traders make pennies Investors make dollars”. Fundamentally speaking, with the growth of ECommerce and online payments PYPL is ideally positioned and we are just in the early innings. IMHO"
Might add more here.
Do Not sell. A Beat is a Beat. Only short term traders are taking profits.And the 10B buy back is as good a reason not to sell as you should need. I am in until they can not grow and that is not in the visible future. There will be buyers coming in as you must remember the market is not efficient in the short term .Particularly on amateur hour trades.
Facebook is going to be trusted with a currency???? How many security breaches have they had in the past? LMAO
why is it tanking?

"Be patient, the time of rising will come soon. Every thing PYPL is doing right now is to perfect the platform, It takes time to do it right in order to dominate the sector. The earnings number will be huge, I don't worry about the EPS, I just want to hear the future plan how soon they will monetize VENMO."
"$SQ & $PYPL what are you guys sleeping on!, this is your opportunity to make some amazing money! Online gaming and online gaming industry is growing so rapidly you guys are gonna miss out. Especially with 2021 coming in, many more states is gonna legalize the online gambling industry."
"There were 2 upgrades for PYPL, the price moved around 1.40 but closed at .47 up. Today there is interview about VENMO that the guy explained VENMO is in the long game, this may be the reason PYPL pops up more that 1 point,"
Where's Larry the Bum?
my Venmo wallet is going to tear at its digital seams.
"Haven't posted here for a while, so just going to remind my fellow investors: PayPal on its last investor day gave guidance that they will be using 40-50% of their free cash (in the billions) to buyback shares. I suspect PayPal CFO John Rainey is on a shopping spree right now."
"Ark Invest run by the famed Cathie Wood (one the best tech investors of our day), was buying PYPL for her various funds all day today. Looks like she likes what she saw.ARKF 11/3/2020 Buy PYPL 70450Y103 PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC 24,285 sharesARKK 11/3/2020 Buy PYPL 70450Y103 PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC 271,692 sharesARKK 11/3/2020 Buy PYPL 70450Y103 PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC 267,179 sharesARKW 11/3/2020 Buy PYPL 70450Y103 PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC 116,504 shares"
So how long will it take PYPL to make the 2B it just shelled out for this Co?
I really believe pay pal will 100% gain this year they are killing it on cash and everything
Great volume and price support. Go PYPL...!!!
"PYPL IS A STRONG BUY POINT EVERYONE..DUE TO TODAY DIP , ACCORDING TO BREAKING NEWS....IT'S A BUY THIS TIME...."
I hope this is not the trend for a stock that did well. I do not like price action and this might be a barometer of what to come. GFB if a company misses
So are we going to talk about it or keep our mouths shut....I'm talking about SQ by the way
"Someone bet me this morning (for fun) that $PYPL will hit $300 by June 2021. I said no way, and took the “over”, meaning it won’t hit $300 until after that date. What do you guys think?"
Bridgewater: Stocks are more expensive in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world
"getting wrecked. Just averaged down some more. don't really care what happens to the price now, just want to see 100 in 2018"
distribution. almost no shorts. no real buyers.
"Folks time to buy, now need to compete with the supposedly kicking-in buyback program and big boys, Jesus."
I hope it dips 15% or more so I can load up on a great buying opportunity. PayPal is a great company with a bright future.
Options trader guy not real bright
87.4% slump in first Quarter profit yet the stock hovers around all time high. 2nd Quarter result will be devastating. This will drop to new lows with rest of overvalued stocks
"ebay has cancelled paypal, that is gonna be yuge"
Anyone know what happened to PYPL today?
Paypal phone lines jammed...
Up to $84 AH and climbing!
"I just sold my 5,000 shares at $79.25. I rode it up $2.20 this morning for a profit over $11,000. I hope to buy back in again if it drops another dollar or so."

this is crazy PayPal should not be down
Nervous?
"Fantastic Report, frankly the total valuation of the company should be much higher!"
Good move.
Raised so why sell?
"PayPal is a great long term investment, it is a growth company. Years ago one had to mail liquid assets or use a credit card via phone line. One doesn't have to expose their credit card number and keeps secrecy and supports transaction. PayPal is forward looking by owning Venmo. They don't gamble on the future with cripto cash in the present. If cripto is the future, which cripro? I like the safe, no BS approach PayPal steers in the murky Waters of technology and finance. Your children will be using PayPal."
"In yesterday's interview with cramer, the CFO said to expect them to be very aggresive this year with acquisitions both small and large, as well as buybacks."
Also moving to SQ. PYPL market cap is 200 Billion. SQ just 40 billion
Best EVER quarter for account growth! and beat earnings with .69!!
I wouldn’t touch PayPUKE  until $25
is sky falling on paypal? wth its down 1% more afterhours? $35 down in 4 days?
PayPal Rocks.
Time to buy smart with discount
what a week for digital payments!!
This is a good opportunity to buy the dip ( I did ) The Pay Pal process will benefit in a big way as it will support the legalization of Sports gambling.. The strong growth of internet sales will continue to grow the company as well.
people just selling the news folks. this will be green tomorrow. have a look at AMD.
80 close
This is starting to become a joke now
"A red day in the market, Mostly all tech is down. PYPL is up. I am -7% at the moment... Next month back to normal. Not worried at all."
Will buy at $80
"Printing and distributing is the craziest socialism there is. No one will get angry because no one will be asking them to hand out from their pot. Their wealth pot will lose value by the percentage of extra free printing of money and that extra printed cash will be distributed among the favored members of society. Check this out...if the value of wealth X is $100 on the pot and you Print another $100 out of the thin air....then the wealth is X equals $200 but take that $100 newly printed bucks....give $80 to your buddies businesses and sprinkle remaining $20 to poor saps, the rich buddies are happy and the poor saps are happy too because they both win. The only ones who are hurt are the ones who worked hard to save the original $100. Those Dollars are only worth 50 cents now. This is one of the greatest form of socialism there is and who better than someone like Trump to execute the greatest socialism in the history of this country. Can you imagine the anti socialists reacting if Obama or clintons were doing this? Only Trump can execute this kind of socialism peacefully. If Obama did this there would have been too many right wingers in capitol hills with their muskets."
We might see 270 by tomorrow!
90 not out ;)
Why this thing is going to 75$?
"Question is not how great a company is, everyone knows PYPL, GOOG, MSFT..et al... are great... it all comes down to valuation. It was unheard of that any stock gains 100-200% a year, unless it’s a Biotech that discovered a cure, or something breakthrough.... the valuation are ridiculous at this point. Return to normality or not...are we really in a better shape than pre-pandemic? Don’t see that even come close for years... this bubble is created by the Fed, will pop, just when is the question...."
"at this price, adding more is an easy decision."
At what time?
will go much higher
Still a buy?
You’ve seen the forever high $250 in PayPal
Let's all punish eBay with short.
Earnings results before or after market today?
In my stock portfolio I own cyclicals and big tech names. All of the cyclicals in my portfolio are up today and the tech names are down. It’s nothing but a sector rotation. Nothing has changed fundamentally. The growth story is still with tech. Fund managers are just rebalancing their portfolios after the big gains in tech. This pause in the tech rally is a good thing. I recommend buying shares on these red days and get ready for the NEXT LEG UP 
"I am PYPL Long, but this is getting harsh. Compared to MA, VISA and SQ, Pypl is lagging behind. It is in last place for YTD, 6 months. and in 3rd for 1 year. Not a good sign, but I will hold on to my shares for time being."
awesome stock
retail is simply not afraid of missing out on further fake gains in pypl. the banker buyup is simply not being believed. got popcorn?
over $309 by tomorrow as soon no more short shares available for those weak hands....that could have been shaken off the table.....
Kenny bought high...just saying
by end of next weak this stock will be at 95...that's because my Feb 8 95 options will come due :( ...so hang in there after the 8th 100 will be next stop !
Honey will be an epic bonanza for PayPal going forward..........
Strong close to an amazing year for the stock. Thanks PayPal.
Reality is setting in after today’s euphoria. People really think the stimulus package would shore up the economy under the present crisis? How oblivious can investors be?
"Pypl is simply consolidating here between $85-88. By the way, so is the overall market. I don’t expect this to change the rest of August either. I expect this to be at a 52 week high of $95-100 in October but as far as the next week, Don’t be surprised if it sees the $85-86 range again."
"$PYPL is looking pretty good right about now, isnt it?"
Never underestimate Joe's ability to mess everything up
PayPal (PYPL) to Acquire Hyperwallet for $400 Million. Another great move by PayPal!!
Good earning. Buy the post earnings dip?
Can this go below $70 ? Lets find out.!
Going up up up higher!
wasnt it 10 minutes ago this was the darling of wallstreet?And they get paid how much?
cooling off ...so buy!!!!
Something is wrong with the board
PayPIG not even $20 off it’s highs yet
Anyone think it will hit 300 tomorrow?
"With year-to-date revenue growth of 17%, and 19% FXN, FY’20 revenue growth now expected tobe ~20%, and ~22% FXNTomorrow $210. sell the pump."
very very low volume pump today. expect pypl to drop 10 bucks post cooked books eps release.
Paypal and Venmo not going anywhere. This stock is just getting started.
Does anyone think that PayPal has not prepared for this and has no clients in the bullpen?
PYPL gonna beat tomorrow but you have all Q1 to accumulate. They didn’t charge any fees to buy BTC or ETH in Q4... but the heavy buying of crypto now will mean tons of fees in Q1 and a huge profit on next earnings. Just my educated guess as user and shareholder.
You all know that PYPL missed on top and bottom in their latest earnings call. I guess investors are starting to digest that information.
digital money is future. just bought more yesterday.
"IF PYPL opens tomorrow down, i'm a buyer, they will blow away the earnings on 7/29"
AARK BUY WASN'T A RUMOR. THE PURCHASE WAS MADE YESTERDAY. HERE IS THE LINK https://cathiesark.com/ark-funds-combined/trades

$90 soon then $100
Great week for day traders!......... Good/easy money?
I just don't feel good about it if Ebay will move away from PayPal at the end of this year. Can anyone stop it?
"The gap between Paypal and the shrinking Square keeps widening ... a few weeks ago $20 difference, now $27. Paypal the place to plant your $$$$ and watch it grow"

how do listen to conference call?
No dip today!
WHEN BIG HEDGE FUNDS TRYING TO REVERSE THE COURSE....NO ONES CAN RESIST THAT....UP MORE AND MORE AS THEY 'RE LOADING ....NOW...
"C'MON PYPL BABY, SHOW US WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF TOMORROW!!!"
Now trading within a couple dollars of Visa!
"When pypl and sq, are 2 of your 4 largest holdings you enjoy your coffee this morning."
Could easily boost up to $95 with good news
"This is basically a bank that trades like a tech company. I Love it!No short squeeze here. Although according to Wallstreet Bets IPIX is ""poised for a run""."
$TSNP check them out! The potential is astronomical! They recently merged with HUMBL; it’s the next $PYPL in the making
"This is one of my I use it may as well own it stocks. I love the product and all three of my kids use Venmo, so I'll take that over any and all analysts."
Next stop $300
Have the fundamentals changed? No. Have the price targets decreased? No. Is the growth over for this company? No. Buying opportunity.
Expecting more analyst upgrades striking near the 250 level in coming 90 days. Performace should continue to accelerate well in to next year. 212 by Friday looking highly probable.
"way over done, good buying opportunity!"
Big money moving in
PayPal has sold off and bounced back everyday this week.
CREATED CORONAVIRUS:1.5 MILLION CONFIRMED WUHAN CASES /MORE THEN 50.000 BODIES BURNED utube it!
PayPal authorized a $10 billion dollar stock repurchase program during the last earnings release. That’s in addition to the over $2 billion dollars remaining from the previous plan. Why sell at these levels? Has the story changed?
Oh snap
PayPal has no reason to hit 65 
$TSNP Paypal winding down in India??? Whilst HUMBL-Pay (currently TSNP) Partners with Digital India Payments (DIPL)?? This is a no-brainer.Keep in mind India has a population of over 1.3 BILLION and is driving towards a Moneyless and Contactless State. This is shouldn't stay under 20USD
Wait whys it up in pre market somuch? any news?
130 shortly
Time to buy more PYPL
$309 to $220 in 2 weeks Nice stonk
It’ll be back to normal by end of next week. Load up people I added another 400 just now.
report release at 5?
Buy Sq stocks more bang for buck...
Profit takers are coming Monday!
"You were right. Was Bad idea to short it on terrible report. It is very promising company, q2 will get you too 200$ and me to BK"
We’ll past $90 this week. $100 by the end of the month.
"Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL) EVP, Chief Bus Aff & Legal Off Adele Louise Pentland ,Filled Form 4, on 03/03/2021, Disposed 18000 shares, at Price $259.35 worth $4.5 MillionFollow On Instagram, money_insider_stocknewsTwitter @earnegyFacebook, Earnegy InvestmentsFor Stocks, Inside News and Details."
"Doesn't bother me the least.Even the irrepressible charge of AAPL 8-9 years ago had period of 25 - 30% fall in between, most notably from mid $500 to below $400 before split, market cap than 400B.You can't keep a great company down for long, whatever the general market sentiment happen to be."
Once PayPal hits 200 it’ll be off to the races.
"if paypal announce a new stock buyback program tomorrow, $80 will be a history"
At least we dont have to put up with all the SQ longs and their bragging
"In fact, Ebay charges a bloody fee to vendors, not Paypal. Ebay's days won't be long if it doesn't change."
"PayPal’s third quarter was one of the strongest in our history. Our growth reinforces the essential role we play inour customers’ daily lives during this pandemic. Going forward, we are investing to create the most compelling and expansive digital wallet that embraces all forms of digital currencies and payments, and operates seamlessly in both"
"I predict that by the end of this coming week, Paypal will be testing it's all time high again, that is around $86 a share......looking forward to hearing all the great news that will come out on Investor Day later in the week ! Buy-in soon folks or regret it later!"
Check out the daily and weekly charts for PYPL. It looks like we're in for a major run up and to the right.
"Tens of Thousands of PayPal accounts being closed today in the UK, in protest at the treatment by PayPal of the journalist Tommy Robinson. Google Tommy Robinson because it’s unlikely to be reported on any official news channel."
PYPL is undervalued. Back to $100 after earnings.
With BTC - should be 300 by end of next year easy.
Trade PYPL after Christmas is the safe way. I still like PYPL because earnings is sure bet and the future is very bright.
each transaction carries a $3 fee? good for Pypl bad for poor people?
"Don't worry about the selloff today, it always selloff 2 weeks before earnings. Then rises the week of earnings. April 23rd"
4 more days this year to print $250. With a second round of stimulus & PayPal playing a part (again) I think we will print $250 by end of year.
"Nice for those holding. I could have, should have but instead got stuck with SQ. Embarrassment."
I believe the market will recover even faster because it drops too fast.
"Feeling incredibly fortunate. Long PYPL from $38.96 from the first day they went public. 678 shares. 2,000 shares of V since 2012, so... yeah. 500 shares of SQ at $60. 2,000 shares of Adyen (ADYEY) from last June. Obviously I'm a huge fan of Fintech. Recently bought 3,000 shares of IPOE (SoFi) which I think will be a monster. Also bought 3,000 shares of BFT (Paysafe) and 3,000 shares of FTOC (Payoneer). Once (if) Stripe ever goes public, I'll be there too. It will be decades before the Fintech market is saturated. Good luck to all!"
Come on $110.00!!
"They are just panicked and don't look around that PYPL does not change a bit. It will be a short period because fundamental is there and the technical is super. Big boys make it look like sell off. The chart points out :BREAK OUT"". I look at the chart both short and long term still ""BREAK OUT"" AND I DON'T THINK I AM WRONG.b"
Ho Lee Sheet!
Bought a lot at $88
I swear I blink and nothings changed
Basically $71 which is awesome! Least you forget many powerhouse stocks have released great ER’s and the stocks retreated. Nvidia for one. So for PYPL now only to have held its ground but rise up 5.5% is truly remarkable. What we are witnessing here is a great stock and a steady determined march to $100. IMHO
I sold Kev some 150 puts
physical silver being given away yet again. backing another truck up. load.
"Tech sector does not need tax incentive to move higher. They are all dominate the sector. PYPL I know will hit high note next month with out any doubt. With SWIFT and VENMO are in full swing, and don't have to worry about the debt load, I think PYPL should have a higher number over 60 cents for this quarter."
September lows have officially been retested after blowaway earnings beat. What more needs to happen before this stock continues upward?
Should be 85 bucks tomorrow
how does this not fall when all market is down?? this market is scam buy bitcoin
PYPL is green while the rest of the market is red
think we buy Stripe this summer
"If there is really an outbreak of corona virus in US, the logical development should be: a. the forced increase of online shopping; b. the forced decrease of use of cash. And c. The forced bet increased use of PayPal especially due to its lack of offline presence so far. Why panic? So foolish."
too much competition and not enough inovation from PayPal. time to sell?
USA USA USA USA
buy the fear baby. love the dips.
OUCH !!!!!!!!That Hurts
"Heard that some Asian countries authorities are literally burning their cash/paper currencies due to the high transmission of germs via cash handling ... hence the likes of Paypal, Visa and Mastercard leaping by surprising amounts today ! The cashless society is nearly here folks !"
Any guess on PYPL earnings tomorrow? Mine is $.71
We should all go online and buy something and pay with Paypal
how many of you are thankful for this 120 PE money maker. I am thankful to all for letting us cash out at this PE level. There might still be some FED juice left in this but i am happy to cash out.
Buy on open sell an hour later. Then wash and repeat!
Should add more at this price? I have few shares from last year and been buying before earnings?
Venmo alone makes me confident these guys open up 15 points higher tomorrow
"So Square has generated 1.76 billion in revenue from bitcoin. How much revenue will Paypal make from crypto then as Paypal also have Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoincash? Do Paypal have more users than Square in terms of buying Bitcoin?"
"Read the Conference call notes and you will understand how the loss has been cut in half already. Thorough understanding of the content of the earnings and the $10 Billion buy back set the stage for continued earnings growth and EPS is what drives future pricing. They beat the street estimates and the real issue is the business is growing at 27% , and the company grows on a counpounded basis in a little over 3 years. ( Law of 72 ). To put a finer point on it the company buy back will increase earnings on the current base by 10% over the time period that the shares are bought back. This could further reduce the years to double to 3 years when considering the even faster growth of Xoom and Venmo which is growing at an even faster rate of 50%. E-Bay is still growing after all these years at 6% and transactions in total are growing at 24%against last years 21% growth, Very nice. Margins are solid and growing. Bad loan loss is down by $50 Million. This stock is not yet priced to perfection even though it has been running like the rabbitt in front of the hounds.The model is excellemt with a minimum of moving parts when comparing to Banks, Finance , and has some moat for on-line revenue which is still growing at 10x+ over bricks and mortar. I believe the recent upgrade call to 125 is very achievable , watch and learn and buy this dip."
Panic selling will accomplish nothing but locking in a loss do you really think pypl is going to take this lying down
Good stock LONG!
expect at least 85 soon
There we go $260
"Trading off the back of $SQ, sq will print $150 first"
Round two is beginning. Stay tuned!Wonder if tomorrow is going to be a down day again?
With zelle picking up speed with all the banks - PayPal is done
Cramer said Stay The Course!
Cmon. $85 tomorrow plz
Can't believe SQ is up 14$ and we are down 3$.It's all inside dealing.
"PayPal price target raised to $290 from $285 at MizuhoMizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $290 from $285 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst's work points to ""ample upside"" to Q3 total payment volume estimates, better than expected revenue and ""upbeat"" preliminary 2021 guidance as PayPal's fundamentals ""continue to strengthen."" The analyst sees 33%-34% TPV growth, ahead of guidance at 30%"
Potential $209 price target
"eBay is dropping PayPal on July 15, all transactions will go through eBay itself. That's a lot of money PayPal stands to loose."
"5,000 @$32 Dave here. Finger off trigger and safety is on!!! 2nd Q 2021 is 100% of my focus and research."
Go long or go home
Anyone here knows how to buy coins through PayPal. I want to buy dodgcoin
Cramer is going to have PYPL on Mad Money tonight
BEAT BOTH ENDS
Holding my quadruple down $177 short along with my puts expiring Friday strong
"It's funny how many people think a stock should go up every day. With that lack of patience, just take your nickels and go to Vegas"
"Tax will pass this evening, It will pass easily tonight because GOP will bend over to get this one done, and the market will push up even higher because the business become strong. Watch the number from AMZN on BLACK FRIDAY and CYBER monday. Since then the online commerce is even more busy. AMZN PRIME drivers start to complain that they have to work overtime. That is the evidence that business is very strong."
$309 to $220 in a week! OMG 
I do a lot of buying and selling online I will tell you this if Paypal gives me any problem I will just open a credit card and use that to buy things instead and consider using other payment handling services.
we shall see 350 sooner than later!!!Load UP!!!!

After today’s FED Speak and talking head jabber, the obvious conclusion will be reached by the Street. There is no Boogeyman out there for the future. Artificial fears, for example February retail sales. When has retail sales not sucked in the month of February?1.65% treasury yield for 10 year?"
love this company
$80 soon... it’s taking long enough
End the week with a 52 week high......
Always sell at least half when going into earnings.That's what I've learned.
"I think someone on CNBC said this stock should hit $350. Can anyone confirm? Also, there is a new strain of the virus in NYC that I believe is spreading fast. Exactly who is confirming that this pandemic is over? WIth strains popping up seemingly on a weeky basis or so, do we really belive that we are out of the woods ?Tech stocks will continue to be required now and going forward. Me thinks this is an overblown selloff. MSFT, PYP, APPL which were roaring pre pandemic as well as during the pandemic will now suddenly stop functioning as required technology. Exactly how are value stocks immune from utilizing these stocks as they supposedly step up now? Much of this churn seems illogical, IMHO."
pay your pal!
"Honey has been profitable since 2018.....and there should be some other undisclosed plan to use this platform.....for example, pay to be listed in comparison....?"
buy face book or paypal now?
what is happening?
e-transactions market is going to grow a lot in 2018 and PayPal is the major player there
can this market be any more fake?
Wow I can barely stomach this massive selloff!! Lol. $100 soon
Remember this PayPal staffer's name ... Devendra Tivedi. He and other key staff in India are going to make PayPal one of the important players in this exploding market. See my other post for the 12x increase for Paypal revenue in India's market.
Square seems to be where it's at! might put my money over there with Jack Dorsey:)
Foreign markets up big
"Moron selling after hours<>><> Buy the DIP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! load the boat, GREAT earnings, GO long !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Earnings are great , a good 2 for1 split would be great or start to pay a Div."
"It is very healthy pull back. PYPL reverses so fast with heavy volume, that make me believe that now PYPL will move with the MOJO."
Check PAYS it's a cheap buy to make some $$$$ 
We are going up!
Just read a rumor!Amazon will buy Paypal in 2017
Went up 2% in 30sek. 
Paypal will cross 100 before the next quarterly call.
Just too many new payment systems with Fintech and many are discounting fees.
Yea thir! That’s what I am taking about! Onwards to $80 amigos ! :))
Ching ching! Bring on the analyst upgrades! A $500+ pps target isn’t too much to ask...
"in the news regarding paypal buy now pay later, it makes money from the fees from its millions of vendors and the huge addressable market and without quoting word for word, this is a huge win for paypal"
Anybody know what time investor day and extended forecast coming today?
Red tag sale! Grab some shopping carts and fill them up!
"PYPL getting a nice 0.94% today ..... but again, only 33% of SQ move. GEEEEZZZ ... SQ just continues to out-pace PYPL."
Back to ATH!
Bought 1000 last night at 75.25 sold this morning at 79.15. Kept my original amount. That was easy money. No way they should have taken that stock down that much.
It may pass 310 rangd
"My question is this, is PayPal now becoming a BITCOIN PLAY? If so then that could fuel crazy speculation in this stock "
And the grind to $100 starts again.
"those who cashed out of gme and amc with their ill gotten wins will be shopping for safe, logical investments..."
Maybe silver shots past 20 after the emergency rate cut tomorrow.
Did I see we passed $300? Much faster than I expected :)
"invest in Pypl, its buying up all its acquisitions to dominate the market, near term is a bit up and down. Pypl is not a trading stock like Sq is, this is a long term stock. PayPal will only dominate the market as time goes on, so just hold on"
What I find funny is all these clowns predicting pullbacks  PayPal already had its pullback and traded sideways for August. Looks like now we are taking the next leg up 
Glad i sold at 89 and some change bought in at the ipo
BUY PYPL and SQ - BITCOIN
RSI at 25? Don’t it goes below 20 which would put the stock at around 78 or high $77’s
"Buy more on this one time opportunity DIP as BITCOINT 's UP over 50,000 again today ...and continue further as TSLA buying more BITCOINS as well with many other blockchain companies...."
Paypal is only 10% of Ebays payments. The question is how much of pay pal's is ebays?
Love it. PayPal is already recovering.
"PayPal price target raised to $255 from $228 at Piper SandlerPiper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $255 from $228 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following today's presentation by its CEO Daniel Schulman at an industry conference. The analyst says the discussion has indicated that the company could be on a path to a ""Super App"" status and cites China's WeChat as a ""good example"", which started as a messaging app and then expanded into payments, shopping, ride-hailing and other uses. Donat adds that CEO Schulman believes that future consumers will have 6-10 apps that they use everyday, and he ""wants PayPal to be one of those apps."""
PayPal just can't get any respect since e9bay announced it was going to other payment processor. Been dead in the water ever since. Can't see what's going to change that at this moment.
Great ER Dan. Well done. Lemmings selling on the news. Stock will be up mañana. Venmo numbers through the roof. EBay shortfall all news and one time event.
Boom
Pypl already reported guys and they reported a great quarter....you selling afterhours because of SQ earning?? Do you make sense??
"Who's taking some profits before earnings on 24th & who's staying ""all in""??"
ContactlessThis is the Future Banking!The future for Inflation!Go PYPL!!!
Are we going red after a stellar report...this market is a joke
What you think guys on PayPal this week and next week.

$184? Haven’t covered even a single share and still holding 100% of my puts expiring Friday. I still think we see $150. Save this brilliant post.
PayPal Rocks. 280+ by the end of the year. I’m calling it.
"ARK just sold 893,007 shares of $PYPL(I think ARK wanted to manupilate the market as last week telling market will crash, then they started to buy cheap. Now they see that market really crashing and they started to sell what they bought 1 day ago)$ACIC $PYPL $TSLA $SENS $BNGO $PACB $NDRA"
These spammers posting about the stock market bubble are the most annoying thing I swear.
It's good!
"Paypal was beat up today for no real reason, other than the imagined effect that interest rates will have going back to a very low normal. Back in the 1990's interest rates were in the 5-7% percent range and the economy was healthy. Gas was 1.10 a gallon. Today with interest rates at 3% there is fear. Companies like Paypal will only grow. Underneath all of this is a world economy where now India and China are finally part of the mix for the first time since colonialism. And Africa will be next. These areas are skipping traditional merchant accounts and moving straight to Paypal type companies. This growth for Paypal will most likely continue for many decades."
Bargain priceBuy today tomorrow green again
Great report... will be buying more at open
"Has anyone heard of WP. It was at $78 when PYPL was there. Now around $99. I missed the boat myself on that one, but it still has a lot of room in my view."
Walmart.ca adds PayPal as payment optionhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3560836-walmart-ca-adds-paypal-payment-option?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=pypl-walmart-ca-adds-paypal-as-payment-option&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3
Why I think Paypal will surge rapidly this year:1. Revenue from crypto: Square made 1.63 billion from Bitcoin during Q3. I expect Paypal making atleast 2 billion from crypto every quarter as in Paypal you can also trade 3 more cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin. This is only revenue from investing there will be also revenue from buying things with crypto.2. Purchasing power will increase spending stimulus and reopening of the economy.3. If Square can add stocks trading in Cashapp I believe Paypal also will.4. PayPal will be expanding crypto services to other countries. Where the UK will be the first.
"I think I might regret buying Pypl insted of sq, please convince me that this was the right choice for the future"
Anyone load up on weekly PYPL put options at the open near $250? I am up 200% and counting! Beats working for a living!
"Xoom, a service of PayPal has been down for 3 days now. Will this hurt? Maybe. People starting to think there was a data breach. Not spamming here. Just stating facts."
No news so the leaks must be starting and the privileged are buying....
I love how revenue was missed slightly and investors lost it but the fact that this year they've added the most new accounts ever goes to show that the growth is far from over. EPS was even revised time after time upward and they STILL beat it yet stock drops. Just can't stop shaking my head here.

Any news on this drop?
This is s gift buying pypl here this is the last time u will see s 79 handle
Will reach 78 today
why use paypal to pay for anything when one can use visa (rewards/cash back) or crypto (very beginning of payment paradigm shift)? Using visa for all ebay purchases for cash back. Lovin it.
On useless days like this an options expiration Fridays I go play golf and do not check the market. It has served me quite well for the past 11 months to accrue a nice bag of cash.Add in a dovish Fed and I will patiently hold.Staring at a ticker all day is what these manipulating miscreants want you to do.Have a great weekend AMC bulls.Also a quick shout out to my other favs after AMC.Long and strong $AMC $NIO $BRCX $PYPL and $NVDAGo out and enjoy life and patiently hold onto your shares.
meanwhile amc missed badly and stayed put. the market is a racket. I'm done with it good riddance
"Paypal will be a $1Trillion co in 10 yearsStill cheap now $1,000 in a decade"
"EBAY needs PayPal a lot more than PayPal needs EBAY. As PYPL CEO said, current growth with no new acquisitions would see EBAY’s business with PayPal drop by over 67%. Now imagine what new growth streams PYPL will add between now and 2020."
200 day moving average 82.16. Heads up folks
"such a smooth rise, no pumps, tutes holding, low volatility"
"guys what advantage does PayPal have over sq? like I'm invested in this company but I'm in this for the long run,"
"Well, at least this negates my QCOM bomb, lol......Go PYPL!"
A great company.
"As expected, another analyst raises target. Expecting many more in the coming days.Still a lot of room to grow! $280 around the corner!"
This is a rare opportunity to buy on the dip.The entire market is tanking and it's a great opportunity to buy PYPL.It will go back to 196 at least before ER.
paypal is on a rampage right now
"Wow, what's up with the PYPL? Positive....even though they just reported expectations of reduced revenue due to CVirus also?"
"Dive, dive! Might be worth picking some up before the end of the day for tomorrows rise...Its done this a few times before."
soon $350
"No one may remember but folks don't forget about MercadoLibre. Over $1,000 a share. PayPal has more than a 100% return from original investment!"
Recovering
Mizuho raised its price target on PayPal to $290 from $270
"wow! Venmo processed more than $27B of TPV in Q3, up 64%."
Almost time to take a long position. Enough buy pressure this could easily hit 245 in a single day.
There’s that resistance I was talking about at $83.30 we need to break that.
Do you think this increase will hold till tomorrows market opening. YES or NO????
"pypl has been a great trading vehicle,having failed to break out during this rally but running up a lot ,I bet traders take this down to 110 or so before it breaks out likely this summer, if we do break 122 now likely we hit 130 before the fall back"
One of the best long term stocks out there with digital payments and online shopping!! Long PayPal and MA!!
Bargain price to load moreIt is down almost 7%
"I’ve owned PYPL since the split from EBAY several years ago. Cost basis is around $42 a share. To date my return on it is almost equal to my return on Square since March. I see people in the PayPal discussion bashing Square, and people in the Square discussion bashing PayPal. You shouldn’t pick and choose between the two, you should own both of them. Both can coexist and I use both Venmo and CashApp. These companies are the future of business payments even after COVID falls by the wayside. So stop the bashing and put your money to work. Owning two big money makers is better than one."
Imagine where the stock price would be if DOW was up!
Way overblown. PayPal is way to go for every one in future. Have used PayPal and will continue to use PayPal. eBay has lost their mind it’s their loss and we don’t need eBay.
Guess I made the right move when I went with PYPL rather then E-Bay
"Not trying to pump here, but this here PayPal,,,its a tsunami...see ya at 2bills..peace"
$PYPL P/E is above 100. It takes 100 years to get return on investment.P/E and all valuation multiples are being ignoring.
This has strong movement
just made a bet on paypal counterpart in the after hours leaning on strength of good paypal er number life is good $$$
"The greatest threats to the market are two viruses, the Corona virus and the John Bolton virus."

panic probably. still 30 mins till I get to hear call central time
"Stocks which rise always get pushed down by market makers. Nothing has changed, and those who sell on no reason other than a dip are handing money to institutional l traders, PayPal's growth story is far from over. It is just beginning, in India and other large economies."
"Opened a new position today, 3 percent of my portfolio. I been on the fence, but this dip looks like a nice entry point. GL guys!"
PayPal reached an all time high at 289.76
Just added 800 shares
These guys are printing money .Watch it go to $95.00!!!
"paypal is making acquisition, share firing up!!!"
Any DIP today 's a great GIFT as VACCINES WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS / AT LEAST 1/2 YEARS FROM NOW.....ACCORDING TO BREAKING NEWS TODAY...
"I am also pointing out that in a Barron’s article last fall that Adyen was one of the companies mentioned as a possible acquisition by..... yep, PayPal! Just throwing that out there."
Non-GAAP EPS $0.55 expectation was $0.52
From what I been reading seems like PYPL May finally be on the precipice of a great move upwards. Let’s see what happens between now and ER. Could me a major move upwards.
Analysts are good for one thing....to churn stocks with useless chatter. Brokerages love them because they create buys and sell which in turn creates income for brokerages. News like can Micron go higher or is the rally over for Amzn.. Think about it.
If this isnt the moment than i never saw one $sq $pypl
"Someone will get hurt, because of the bitcoin. LFIN moves 100 points just take over ZIDDU. IT LOOKS MORE LIKE TULIP TRADE NOW."
It's cheap at $75. Don't believe the BS from crooked fake news that Amazon is going to take over PYPL & SQ. Total Bull!That is short sellers fake news ploy.
I fly on Cebu Pacific a lot and was given the option of paying with PayPal for the first time. That sure was nice. Good sign too.
"PYPL up.... big, big, big.....Big."
What a beast ! Back to $90s in no time.
"HUGE BARGAIN HUNTERS JUMPED IN AT LATE MINUTES TODAY AND MORE IN AFTER HOURS ....FOR A BIG REBOUND TOMORROW , LIKE LAST MONDAY.....AFTER FRIDAY 'S DIP LAST WEEK...."
bigger question imo is will AAPL report along the lines of 3M? this will break techs run and pause to the markets bringing all stocks lower. thoughts??
"continued from my post, careful investors who can get past the hype will see that the value of PayPal’s BTC move is much more long-term than a brief market boost. Ultimately, it promises to turn the company into a central plank of our financial system.so here is the real reason paypal got into cryptocurrency.can square do this no!!!"
First ever @jack tweet being sold as NFT on... you guessed it... Etherium! Just so happens that PayPal lets you own/invest in Ether that drives the Etherium blockchain.

I think tomorrow will be a good time to add to my pYPL holding. this is still a good co. with good earnings
150 then back to 100 then 200 in 3 years
March starts again.. lets beat the all time high :)
"Retails stocks have fun today up 6-8 %, which I don't know how they value that kind of stock. The big boys just take the tech sector to have a hair cut. Don't worry, just a week or two, after that they have to come back and look at the earnings again. PYPL has a lot of advantage and surely earnings will beat estimate. So I don't worry much for the big picture. It is a melt up for PYPL. Big holidays sales even benefit PYPL, because everybody uses digital payment. That is the reason why I bought PYPL this morning."
Just bought 325 more shares of PYPL
After hours will wreck the shorties
"5,200 shares at $82.78"
A $1.00 dividend will really be nice.
PayPal has huge potential to be a disrupter to VISA. MasterCard is more tech savvy but I can really see PayPal taking market share from Visa. Right now with the pandemic it’s increasing their revenue and earnings BIGLY. How they invest this capital is critical to their future success but I’m betting on PayPal!!!
shoot I missed the train!!
Now we fly folks

Ephemeral....... Why?
Markets up 600+ and PYPL is down $3 and you are all happy! Won’t ever cover a share!
"Big, how you doing? Remember me from when we were at around 100 a couple months ago!? Ahahaha how's the silver working out for you "
"I have no doubt that PYPL will fly to 90+ next week. The mobile payment at the record, E-commerce at the record, no debt reserve for NPL and TAX CUT."
"I expect upgrades. Based on user and venmo growth, this should be green tomorrow."
Venmo is going to be huge for PayPal tomorrow. The young kids are using it like crazy. It has more of a social aspect than PayPal. For that reason I am long and hoping for a double beat tomorrow.
Good morning Folks! Going to be a great day! Good luck!
"UP, UP, AND AWAY!!! GO PYPL GO!!!"
"Wait I thought we weren’t allowed to say the “n” word, so why does Squares newest board director not catch any flak about his liberal use of it?"
do not miss the chance to get in before earnings in 5 days
"You have nothing to worry about with PayPal it’s a longterm hold. The price is a gift right now buy more if you can . A couple of others to buy now at the dip or watch very closely PDD, SQ, TWLO and Docusign .there are to many great stocks to name but here is a few"
90 within a few days of next week!
there is noting proprietary about online payment solutions. watch as the margin crunch kills this. 3% 2% 1.5% 1 % bye bye
For me this is a LONG TERM BUY AND HOLD. I think they are a DISRUPTOR in the way monetary transactions will be processed.
"If it breaks and holds 120.20 today, watch it run."
Holding firm. Market turmoil no reason to sell.
@Big. it seems to be you never got over the Y2K scare! LMAO
"Watching for a LOOOOONG OVERDUE surge to $220. If it doesn’t come in pre-market, it has to come after the CC earnings announcement."
"There is ZERO reason for this to be down so much. This is not profit taking or ""normal selling"". With a stimulus soon to be announced, this actually has me worried. And no, the JPM and V news should have have minimal impact here."
Let see $100 by Election Day
Just heard that PayPal invested $500 million in UBER IPO !!!! When I invested money in Paypal I wasn't thinking they were going to speculate in the market with their capital. What are they thinking ?????
"PayPal has not rallied much compared to SQ. With acquisitions in sight, I feel that it's still relatively undervalued. Even Mastercard's had a better run. Don't think twice and buy the dips folks!"
"Wish i bought more at 183.50, but i was expecting it to dip in the 170's for our dear friend Kevin."
"I bought nov 3 70 calls earlier today How do I sell them? Is it the ""sell covered calls"" or ""sell calls to open"""
Do you guys ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just wrote about PYPL
Paypal just lost money on Strategic Investments may tank tomorrow.
calm down it will be back up in a month
Breakout mode. About frigging time! Yea thir!
Nice move! Let's see if it can land $108.90 before the next profit taking occurs!!
total meltup as US economy craters! fed reserve will NOT let the market sell off. ultra bullish. rate cuts imminent. pypl will double. venmo millenials will spend until ma and pa are homeless!
large scale market crash imminent.
PYPL vs SQ vs MA vs V. Which stock would you prioritize for growth portfolio for the next 5 years?
"Currently if paypal was booted from ebay today it's a 14%hit according to last earnings. that continues to shrink and shrink each quatre.Paypal is still going to be a dominant payment method on ebay perhaps until ayden is better recognised or until 2020. That in itself is more than enough time for paypal to look at newly available options which it is already doing and yet still pulling in revenue until 2023 from ebay regardless. Buy Paypal, sit back and enjoy earnings beat after new partnerships after earnings beat.Don't be a donut."
"Well well well. Would you look at that recovery. Thanks to the ones who sold to me at 176usd. Can sell it now for a fast profit and wait with the ones i bought yesterday, and sell them too with a profit."
$200 by end of year?
Can anyone aware me what’s causing this pop today? CEO making an appearance cannot possibility make this go up this much.
"CNBC report that lot of $88 put traded . Their money will be gone . This set of earning release , tomorrow won’t be at $88 . Try $100"

"""BUyers are rolling in"" --- They are literally POURING in !!! ... and still down 2% .... what a bunch of BAgholders!"
I bought at 177.76 and now I also shorted at 176.76.So either ways I will make money.But looks like downwards.
Is the growth already priced in?
Stay strong!........ Don't give any back!
Bull market back or what
"Started a position today in $V. Best balance sheet of any of these credit companies. I'll also be waiting to get into $PYPL as well if it pulls back. It'll be interesting to see if consumers have been using credit during this crisis. Also, when this eventually blows over, consumers will be spending like gang busters after being stuck in their houses for months. The credit industry will be a great place to be at a discount."
19% Revenue Growth Projected for 2021. LOVE THIS!!
Paypal will not accept Bitcoin so why invest in it? Bitcoin is all that matters in the world.
Just bought some more at 292
apple pay and SQ crushing paypal.
new high in 30 minutes....
PYPL is getting sexier with BTC involvements imo..cheers
"Holiday Shopping begins, PAY PAL to $230 and beyond."

Wow bitcoin is hot almost overnight. 4 different types of bitcoins trending. Riot and mara soar this week. Eman adma after 60 minutes sunday. Prty wtrh possibly mark though it could go either way with explosion of both calls and puts.
Slowly crawling back up. Definitely a knee-jerk reaction after hours.
"MAJOR OPPORTUNITY ON PYPL, THE FEBRUARY 80 CALL, REGULAR MONTHLY EXPIRATION IS ONLY $5.30. THIS IS AFTER EARNINGS AND YOU'RE ONLY PAYING AROUND $1.50 IN PREMIUM! I OWN SOME CONTRACTS AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT HIGHER. MUST BE BECAUSE IT'S A LOW BETA OR VOLATILE STOCK. You know this shopping season was the best in 12 years, I also have SQ so between the 2 I have a large percentage of digital sales! REMEMBER AMEX IS NOT A CREDIT CARD, IT'S A CHARGE CARD AND NOT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE INTERNET. GUESS WHO CREATED PAYPAL, ELI MUSK AND HE SOLD IT FOR 150 MILLION."

follow the trend UP
"Just got calls for next week, this thing is blowing up after earnings"
"Just as adobe's positive pre-announcement with accelerating revenue growth sparked a huge rally. I feel Paypal, can have a similar affect. We are begging to piece together a mosaic of positive techearnings. We are in the strongest season of the year, with the big daddys coming next week. Shorts have better cover, they over stayed their welcome. Im sure many of the algo's will also be switching over for the seasonality."
How y'all feeling about the Honey acquisition? $4B is a lot of dough. Seems like they're trying to catch Square.
"Just thinking out loud here, but did ""somebody"" really just have to sell 405,000 shares the last minute of the day? Really? My gut telling me this is not good. Maybe time to skee-daddy. Will decide Mon."
"Two competitors: SQ announces FY18 adj eps .39-,41c but IIIV announces FY19 adj eps .79-.81. IIIV has much less shares and Market Cap too."
Come join us before too late!
pretty obvious funds have $300 call options on this.
I think indicators are showing the turn back up is really close. Tomorrow or Monday.
Is PayPal the company that manufactures paper?
PayPal back on its foot !
"Another important announcement: PayPal has 15 billion in cash now. They expect to spend 1~3 billion per year on Mergers & Acquisitions. And even better, about 40 to 50% of the free cash will be used for buy backs!"
This really should not be down so much as it is not a covid play. Paypal has been a preferred payment method well before the pabdemic
I think it will hit back to 114 by Friday.
Legend? Hey Legend?
It is gift!!
"If you look at the 1 year or 3 year chart, it’s forming a bull pennant. I know charting isn’t everything but this thing appears to be spring loaded. Anyone has any comments or critiques on my analysis let me know. I’m 22 and invested long term into PayPal so I’m not so worried about near future price action, but this is for those who are worried Day to Day about the price action. Don’t get caught up in it, especially in a solid company like PayPal. They are playing the long game because they know what they are doing."

Futures up big!!! Dow over 100 points! Senate passes tax budget.
Wonder why PayPal didn't create an app where you didn't have to leave eBay site to pay. Seems that would have made both parties happy.
GROW up 35% today. Is that good? :)
Going to 90.
what is going on with paypal? dow is up 100points+
Green today!!!
"With a $ 124 price target, and this encouraging 3 QE results, PYPL should hopefully cross $ 105.00 tomorrow. Holding long for my retirement years. GLTA."
"@JimHarris -- ""PYPL hands-down better than SQ"" -- Hey, Jim -- then why has PYPL been losing substantial Mkt. share to SQ over last two months .... and on an equity side SQ return has been +246% and PYP has been +86% ..... SQ has a return of 3X PYPL .... any thoughts? Capish?"
"And there you have it, pre-market $90.10.............your welcome......"
I see a lot of articles about PayPal about to pullback after such a big run. Stocks with fast growth and great guidance don’t pullback with rates at ZERO. It’s just the way it is. Very few companies are giving guidance right now and PayPal is one of those companies and it was RAISED GUIDANCE. What that means is that PayPal hasn’t adjusted its share price enough yet for this increased guidance. Enjoy the ride! Hot as fire  
How about tough time for square ahead and PayPal takes on there market
"ARK Invest added to positions in payment specialist PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Purchases of 66,100 and 24,750 shares in the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF) made PayPal the fund's fourth-largest holding, making up 4.4% of the fund. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/stock-markets-soar-here-are-2-stocks-cathie-woods-ark-invest-added-to-last-week/ar-BB1dvDaI#:~:text=ARK%20Invest%20also,of%20the%20fund."

BUY MORE EVERYONE....THE TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION WITH HIGH UPTREND AHEAD DUE TO BREAKING NEWS YESTERDAY WITH PYPL IS A BUY AND UP HIGHER EVEN TODAY....
4 day rally coming to an end. I WOULD Sell above 90.
Bargain basement level prices here for PYPL. I guess you don’t want to get rich if you’re not buying here.
What a gift today ... bought the dip! Go PYPL! 
I hope people took advantage of last weeks dip. good luck everyone.
"Lol my apologies to holders, I bought some shares. Anytime I buy shares of any company, it goes down faster than a aspiring actress at a big movie audition."
"sq is trading more than 20% of the avg target price, while paypal is still trading under the avg target price, so paypal deserve 20% more upside"
get ready for take off time to double down on pypl
Let the lemmings sell. Smart money will move in and take shares from them
If paypal can break $78.50 today it could see a technical breakout.
ARK invested yesterday on PYPL
"The fact that they gave guidance I think is Yuge! Most companies or even give guidance right now, and the companies that beat and raise and lift guidance tend to be rewarded by investors.￼￼.."
"Based on news report, during the past several months, Alibaba's online grocery arm Hippo Fresh, has a revenue jumped 220% YOY. The lack of offline exposure of PYPL, suddenly becomes a big advantage. The purchase shifting to the online world accelerates, and the net result is positive to PYPL actually."
"Crypto sales worth a Billion by 2022, according to Two Sigma, strong buy...."
Hope those who bought at 82-ish in March are happy. Way to go!
"PYPL is DEAD $ for the remainder of 2019 .... doing a barbell trade -- long SQ which just has the most upside in this space --- short PYPL which growth is greatly decellerating! Too much controversey around PYPL and SQ just keeps pushing through any ""tension"" that is put in front of it. I've made alot off of PYPL .... but 4x more in SQ over the same time."
visabought shares of pypl years ago. it's a solid planning. position. visa reported an uptick yesterday I think PYPL will do the same
Somebody got a peek at Paypal 4Q report for February 3rd. They got excited
"oh wow had cancel my buy order I had in over a month at $268, I can get them now even cheaper in premarket"
Anyone else here since 80$/share? Keep on going PayPal :)
Maybe people are moving out of SQ and back into PYPL??
It is just going to go back to normal. 190. Shorties making a big panic fuss
Is PayPal a bank too? Like sq?
Buy the rumor sell the news.
Love to see the stock holding. $200 coming to a theatre near you.

When is it 3:30?
"An expanded Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) relationship is mutually beneficial and could be a game-changer for PayPal, according to MoffettNathanson.“Facebook and PayPal are natural partners. They’re both successful internet disruptors focused on facilitating online commerce – Facebook through advertising, PayPal through payments,” analyst Lisa Ellis wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.After a 13-year marriage, eBay (EBAY) and PayPal divorced in 2015. According to Ellis, a new relationship with a major tech, financial or payments company could benefit PayPal greatly. “[It] could create step-function growth in PayPal’s user base, merchant base, geographic footprint, or omni-channel capabilities, and are only possible now that PayPal is free of the constraints of the eBay relationship.”As for Facebook, the tech giant has been under intense scrutiny as a result of misinformation and privacy concerns, and the stock has suffered as a consequence. Shares of Facebook have tanked more than 18% in 2018. Facebook needs a new narrative, and an expanded partnership with PayPal could get the company back in the good graces of investors, according to Ellis.Despite all of the headwinds facing Facebook, Ellis explained that investors are ignoring the company’s e-commerce growth opportunities. “With over 6 million advertisers and 2.6 billion people using at least one of Facebook’s four leading products, they have the potential to develop a world leading eCommerce platform – but, given Facebook’s lack of in-house expertise, need a partner(s) to help,” Ellis argued.Among those four-leading Facebook products is Instagram. The platform has been a force to be reckoned with this year, dethroning Snapchat (SNAP) as the most-used app by teens, according to a survey by Piper Jaffray.Facebook and PayPal have had a partnership since 2016. Facebook users are able to use PayPal to shop on Facebook Messenger and Marketplace; however, Ellis outlined three possible expanded partnership scenarios between PayPal and Facebook.The first option involves the integration of a payment function within WhatsApp. According to Ellis, in order to better compete with rival WeChat, allowing payments on WhatsApp will help drive user engagement. “Even if only 5% of the 1.3B WhatsApp users (whom do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 65M new users – a 28% growth in its base,” Ellis said.Secondly, tapping into powerhouse Instagram would potentially be a smart move for PayPal. Instagram has around 1 billion users, and an expanded PayPal partnership with the platform will allow Instagram users to stay engaged on the platform and shop without leaving the app. “If only 5% of 0.8B Instagram users (who do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 40M new users – a 17% growth in its base. PayPal would also realize incremental payment processing volume and revenue from processing Instagram transactions.”Lastly, Ellis argues that there could be a more aggressive partnership between PayPal and Facebook’s Marketplace. While currently there is a limited number of people that actually make transactions through Marketplace, an extended partnership with PayPal could help boost that number, according to Ellis.“We believe the conditions are in place for Facebook and PayPal to pursue one or more of these partnership options over the next 6-12 months,” Ellis said."
Yesterday I made comprehensive technical and fundamental analysis of PYPL and it looks it has a certain momentum to grow faster in the upcoming days.
Who bought $255? My god lol 
Beat every aspect but not big enough. I still have to keep buying if it drops a lot in the morning. Growth rate is still intact. It will be around 80 for a long time.
"My equal weight FAANG stock portfolio has done exceptionally well YTD, up 40% TR vs 4.5% TR for the S&P. The question now is: does one hold on to the FAANG stocks or will there be a better alternative sector going forward? And if so, which 5 stocks within that sector would you invest in? My answer to all of the above is, I believe the below five stocks will be the top performers of the S&P for the next six months (I refer to the picks as BPMCS):BLACKROCK $BLKPAYPAL $PYPLMASTERCARD $MACME GROUP $CMECHARLES SCHWAB $SCHWBPMCS stocks might have performed 15% YTD vs 40% of the FAANG stocks, BPMCS has however, half the forward P/E multiple than FAANG and almost double the ROE.Again, I’m not predicting that FAANG will do poorly from now on, all I’m prognosticating is that BPMCS will be the top 5 performing stocks in the S&P from now till the end of the year.AP"
More to come
Record high intraday point gain in PYPL history! New record highs going into earnings. Just need to get this Corona fear and hysteria behind us
It seems some big blocks will come late in the afternoon. The market makers suppress the price early so they can gather the shares for some big boys. I see no good reason that PYPL going down early this much. It is the same script that I have seen before.
"PayPal Holdings Inc joined the cryptocurrency market on Wednesday, allowing customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other virtual coins using the U.S. digital payments company's online wallets.PayPal customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network starting in early 2021, the company said in a statement.My thoughts: crypto adoption has been slow moving but this just gave it 26 million more reasons why to use it. PayPal is going to crush it over the next serval years. Can’t wait to see what Venmo turns into. Great stuff here folks."
look this up on youtube: Insiders Are SELLING Stocks At Fastest Pace Since 2007! Huge Warning Indicator.

"Tomorrow good chance we break $90.I suspect triple digits sooner than mid year now.Money machine and maybe we get a acquisition third quarter to catapult us to $150-200 range by year end. Afterhours meaningless, don't ever think afterhours is an indication of what happens the next day."

"Paypal made people see that Bitcoin can be a practical real life reality. FTFT continues this progress. FTFT created the first and only e-commerce shopping mall accepting crypto currency. They also are continuing to acquire investment companies in tax haven areas (currently HK, Indonesia/Singapore, Dominican Republic) so they can provide a safe place to stash and wire cryptos. Apparently 20% of cryptos are hacked or lost so this is a needed solution. They also have a real estate division that is expert in crypto related real estate deals and last week received 10 patent approvals in crypto blockchain security."
""" As part of PayPal, Honey's reach is about to increase substantially. One of PayPal's near-term priorities is to integrate Honey into the core PayPal and Venmo apps. ""We have significant scale on those mobile apps,"" Schulman said, alluding to Venmo's 52 million users.The integration is expected to be completed in the second half of this year. Once complete, Honey could fuel Venmo's momentum, which saw payment volume soar 56% year over year in the last quarter. """
"Market is crazy right now. If you want safe money invest in spacs, they usually trade around 10.5$ and if they merge they double.I recommend to invest in BFT they are going to merge with Paysafe (kind of Square and Paypal) and they are trading at 13.8$$BFT $SQ $PYPL $V $MA"
I have a legit question everyone. I never had a stock that was bought out. What happens? Does stock go down because of this? Or up because it got bought at a higher price?
Why is it impossible to get a live customer service person with PayPal? All calls tell me to send a message through the website. If I could log into account I would not need to talk to you. Changed phone number and thought I changed it on all accounts that send text verification code but either I missed my PayPal account or it needed to be changed at another spot. Did somehow manage to reach a point that I was allowed to have PayPal call me back. They do in about 2 or so hours and had to select #1 to let them know I was on the line. Then a silent insured until after about 2 minutes it when to disconnect. Can't seem to find that series' of prompts and get a call back.Any help
Cramer gave it a buy!
PayPal reached an all time high at 285.55
Anyone in PYPL at $215 fake crypto news? Be honest?

Well its time to head back to V and Ma. You can sleep well with those

I own both PYPL and SQ. Sure hoping for a great showing today.
PYPL is worth about $180. Huge bubble.
What are the chances that PYPL will provide a dividend?
Buying more...
sold 75% of my position today and took my profit! left a small piece in just in case we break resistance but I think this thing is going down down down all next week. Take your money while you can and buy back in before the earnings for even more profit!
"Hello, Im already long paypal almost 3 years. I almost cummed from the presentation? There are alot of doubters. But please the longs will win. 50B Reven incoming. Stay chill. Im opening a beer"
All I have to say is that the company better be buying back as much stock as possible at these prices. Investors will not be happy if the company is not buying back stock immediately. They have an authorized $10 billion.... USE IT NOW!

That that AH Yahoo newsfeed suggests that PayPal is now a strong buyout candidate in the future.... wonder where they got that impression and possible suitors are? Maybe Visa? Are they big enough to buy PayPal?

the stock goes up 3 bucks plus yesterday and suddenly we have articles about financial magazines like barons downgrading it potentially because of all the problems in the world. why am I not surprised? anything to sell their rag magazine. most of their analysts don't have a clue as to what's going to happen tomorrow Ludlow next year.
"I guess PYPL will hit 85+ on Friday. Daniel Schulman gave us a huge body language that PYPL will hit the high note on Jan 31. PYPL has big MOJO on the right time. I will let the far east number on Jan 31, 10 min. before the market close."
Are earnings today or tomorrow?
This what people don't understand. They are too scared to buy when it's red. But that's the best time to buy. When people is selling. US economy is healthy nothing wrong. Market getting affected by the Tarrif. But market in complety healthy.
"PayPal: Growth on SaleBY MarketWatch— 2:43 PM ET 10/21/2018PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) shares have sold off sharply in the recent market correction, bringing its valuation down to more reasonable levels. Meanwhile, the payment company's growth story just got more compelling.PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) reported solid quarterly earnings Thursday. Revenue rose 14% from a year earlier, slowing from 23% growth the prior quarter, but this was largely due to the sale of a loan portfolio. Excluding this, revenue growth was a robust 21% , in line with the pace of previous quarters. Earnings per share rose 17%, beating analyst estimates, and the company raised guidance for the rest of the year.At the moment, this growth is mainly driven by increasing use of PayPal's ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) convenient checkout button to pay for online purchases. PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) doesn't break out how much of its revenue comes from this channel, but MoffettNathanson estimates it accounted for 86% last year. These analysts aren't worried about excessive reliance, though, figuring that checkout- button volumes can keep growing by 20% a year for the next three years.On Thursday, PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) also provided fresh disclosures showing that it is gaining traction on other revenue sources important to its future. Braintree, its payments-acceptance platform used by merchants like Grubhub(GRUB) and Stitch Fix, processed 1.64 billion transactions in the third quarter, up 33% from a year earlier.Most crucially, the company is making progress figuring out how to make money (https://www.wsj.com/articles/paypal- show-me-the-venmo-money-1517501786) on Venmo, its payment app that is popular with young users. Chief Executive Dan Schulman said 24% of Venmo users have now used the app in a way that generated money for the company, a so-called monetizable action. That is up from 17% in the second quarter. This includes using Venmo to pay for goods and services from a merchant, ""instant transfers"" of Venmo balances to users' bank accounts and uses of the new Venmo-branded debit card.The company gave no details on how much revenue it is earning from either Braintree or Venmo--disclosures that investors would appreciate. But the figures it did cite are enough to demonstrate that PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) isn't just a checkout- button story.Before reporting Thursday, PayPal's ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) stock was down 17% from its September high, wringing some excess optimism (https:/ /www.wsj.com/articles/why-paypal-investors-felt-shortchanged-1532599200) out of the valuation. It now trades at 28 times forward earnings, in line with its average multiple since becoming an independent company and down sharply from 37 times at the start of this year.The recent market selloff has hit many payment stocks--a particularly highflying corner of the market. But PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) is no Square, which still fetches 105 times forward earnings (https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-its-less-hip-to-be-square- 1539095847). This pullback creates a rare opportunity to snap up an exciting growth stock at what is now a reasonable price."
"Look like the tax bill passes, The financial sector will get big benefit from the bill. PYPL will get carry by the tailwind next year. It is a big fortune, PYPL will be 100 by second quarter."

"When you listen to the CEO, he is one of the best out there. He has a vision and a plan. He also understands the industry and where it is headed. You would be hard pressed to find a better positioned company and the acquisitions just add to that. This is a great long term investment stock. I have owned it since the 30's right after the spinoff from Ebay"
I don't know the last time I went on eBay let along bought anything off eBay. Do any of you use ebay?
the report is strong. why is after hours down 5%? is it the extended ebay agreement.
"Oh, I get it now FB hits a wall and the world ends. LOL"
"MM manipulators don't want you to make big money on this right now. They will not allow it run up fast. Kept it way down before earning only to let it go back to $70 and change.. The max. price I see on Level II in A/H is $70.45 not even $72, what a joke!With almost 18% increase in Q3 profit we should be at $75 in A/H right now. But the cro.oked wall street manipulators like Ackman, Einhorn, GS, MS, do not want the small investor to make money.Between now and next earnings I beleive they will keep it in a range between $70 & $75. That said, slowly but surely we will continue to see new highs."
after hour means nothing...stay long and strong
IT SEEMS BIG HEDGE FUNDS LOADING MORE SHARES WHILE THEY CAN TODAY....BEFORE TOO LATE EVEN BEFORE MARKET CLOSE FOR THE WEEKEND TODAY....HUGE UPTREND NEXT WEEK W STIMULUS PACKAGE COME ALONG....

Major reversal here 240 any moment now
It is just another peaceful day of PYPL today compared to SQ
"I’ve been preaching buy since IPO. I won’t stop now. It may be heated but run with it. Cash is dead, physical credit cards are following suit. PYPL has decades of growth and innovation. Don’t forget the cousin SQ either. Happy 10 bagger 2030."
And for the record my average is around 105.I invest for the longer term and love a high quality stock on sale.
My technicals pointing at $550 in 18 months .Serious tailwinds in all direction and angles ..
Rolled some appl into pypl. Pypl will recover quicker.
I don't like buying stocks before earnings but really tempted on this one.
Didn't Paypal purchase a ton of Bitcoins earlier this year?
now we are heading to 120 and then all the way up to a new high
"This has been a great story for my bottom line as I bought several thousand shares just after the spin off from Ebay. At least a heck of a lot better investment than the quarter million bucks I ""parked"" in GE a year or so ago for nothing more than picking up a few basis points on the dividend."
"I wish people on this page would stop acting like it's a zero-sum game regarding PayPal and square. There is more than enough space in the fintech industry for them to succeed as well as others. They're not even doing the exact same thing, however PayPal has a much longer history and actual earnings."
"“For Uber and Uber Eats, Venmo had a 300 percent jump month over month from August to September.”"

It looks like it will break out tomorrow... a new 52 weeks New High.
Traded to the bottom of the 20 day 1 hour. Even lower than I thought it would go! Someone realllllllllllly hates you small time retailers.
"Paypal may look expensive now but I think in the future it will justify its price. Why? Increasing margins, shares repurchase and increasing revenue. This will lower its earnings per share and thus its PE."
"When I bought PYPL over 2 years ago. One of the MAIN reasons why I did was because in the state of a possible market correction or recession, PYPL is one of those stocks that will hold its grounds good.Sure, it doesn't ""FLY"" as much as SQ and others, but look at the last year's performance. PYPL is UP! compared to many such as NETFLIX, APPLE, SQ, you name it, that are DOWN. LONG PYPL here. Im talking 10-20 years long."
"Stock that hit 90, almost always hit 100....."
oh oh.......
Closing green today
"Not a user of paypal as Visa is a superior credit building and rewards enabling option. However, I do love stocks that defy gravity which pypl certainly is."

"2021 should be another big year for our winner PYPL. Continuation of their growth in digital everything including Bitcoin, it's hard to guess how high this will go. It should easily double or may be triple perhaps by end of 2021."
I had to mute options trader out of second hand embarrassment
Triple bottom? I’m watching it to see if there’s a break out higher. MACD looks bullish.
Waiting for $80 to $85.
Q4 earnings will be amazing with Black Friday and December spending as most of them occurs online. Q1 will be more amazing as Paypal starts charging for trading cryptocurrencies and QR codes payments. Not to forget that in 2021 Paypal will enable users from outside the US to also start trading crypto.
Is it to late to get into pypal at this price .

"I miss one good opportunity this morning. Sell and wait to buy back now. Now the stock is on steroid. I look at the volume, it is pure MOMENTUM play. If tonight the Senate votes to NO shutdown, PYPL has a good change to hit 85 by Tuesday."
Minimum $95.00 or better on Thursday morning. Option expiration July $95 calls looks great. September $95 calls look great as well.
PayPal is going to spike into the 90s and the days of bouncing around in the 70’s will be sweet memory.
tiny volume=bank only buying. silver time.
look at all subs they have
PayPal did not get breached... read the actual article and not the headlines... TIO Networks data was compromised. PayPals platform is completely unaffected by this. Paypal suspended TIO weeks ago so they’ve been on top of this.
"Sorry about the volatility today guys. I started panic buying due to the investor day and Bitcoin going up. Just couldn't help myself, and there were NOT enough shares available to satisfy me. Then Bitcoin leveled off and I started getting ready for the long weekend instead of caring about the investor day anymore. I stopped the panic buying rather abruptly when my attention turned elsewhere (can my helicopter fly to my vacation cottage if there's a chance of snow?). I'll be back at it and panic buying again if Bitcoin shoots up to $55,000 all of a sudden, but unless that happens I'm just turning my trading over to the algorithms for now . . . It'll probably be pure momentum on Friday, with no panic buying disruptions from me (unless Bitcoin spikes enough to catch my attention) . . . Trade accordingly . .."
Need this to start moving soon.
Upgrades?
Let’s take out the all time high and start our assault on $86 with $90 already on the horizon.
What a buy! Sale wont last long.

"After an evening of scratching my head and wondering what the problem is with a beat on EPS and revenue coupled with a strong outlook I surmise some momentum traders have paniced and hit the sell button. Today looks more encouraging to me as the economy in general looks excellent. Earnings drive share price and they were excellent with very strong growth. I really believe that the stock will not be punished when the professionals step in today and the next several days. Trump may have placed the final Trump card by coming to an agreement with the EU to explore building a zero plan on tarrifs and subsidies. This has the potential to ignite the market out of this channel trade environment. Visa, Square, Master Card, COF, BAC all should do fine in this situation. There is no zero sum gain between these strong companies"
In hard at $71.64. Will ride this stock higher long term.
Keep kicking yourself and trying to rationalize why you are in PYPL and not SQ. SQ was an entire ecosystem what does PYPL have? A card you can pay with if someone sends you money? And a way to check out on a site faster rather than using your CC. Sounds like a moat to me!
I knew I shouldn't sell! I knew it the whole time!
Headlines on Bloomberg say eBay switched payment processor to Adyen. Not true. Also basically the same on CNBC. Guess in this day of so much fake news one should not be surprised. I believe after the truth sinks in there is a very good chance we get some of this back tomorrow. But the uncertainty it creates will stiffle PayPal for months imo.
Under $155 today...for sure.
This isn’t going to be permanent for sure right?
Earnings leaked out. Must be good. go PYPL
"Way overpriced, this is a 130-150 stock."
why dropping ?
SQ Q3 net rev up 140% yoy because of investments in Crypto Currency space; revenue from retail and online transactions were up only a tiny bit. PayPal finally joined the party... thank goodness.

$310 to $290 in a blink. Stairs up elevator down
Let the upgrades and coverage initiations begin. I expect PYPL to easily slide past $300/pps short-term.
"Great opportunity to buy since we are closing to the earning date, i bet we wont have this price in the future."
Close at 59.00? 58.50 worst case scenario. $63.00 Next week close?
"I have held PYPL since they split from EBAY. I have as many shares of SQ as well. With PYPL seemingly flatlining, I am seriously considering selling a large portion. Any legitimate thoughts?"
"PYPL down today, temporary, GPN up all day, like to compare but just own PYPL."
"In some holographic AR applications, WIMI Hologram Cloud Inc. is already available for payment."
Guggenheim is a nobody in the financial world. They should be investigating for downgrading pypl after the company had an earning beat and lowered guidance by 1% over six months. They still are growing at faster than their peers.
Every product PayPal introduces has exposure to its long-lasting and large customer base. That's the true connection IMO that's going to rapidly fuel further growth. People trust PayPal.
Anyone buying PYPL today? Whats your thoughts.
"new highs every day, every other day, every week. buy, buy, buy."
"Short-term money will sell due to lack of classic ""beat and raise"", despite the fact that everything fundamentally is still on trackBuy the dip"
Making money with PayPal is too easy
SILVER RAMPS PAST 19USD!!!!! PYPL still waaaaayyyy over valued. Not for long! tic toc!
120 in a month time?
'Every stock has it's down day Don't get discouraged .It's a great investment
It's going to end up like Netflix. Back to 80 by Monday
"anyone have numbers, Please post here."
Up we go PYPL! Slowly and Steady gains.
It’ll end the day above $80 so get in while you can
I think WMT needs Paypal
PayPal consolidating and moving up slowly on its way to $80 :) the best stock out there. Old reliable!!
How could you not love this equity? “I will Venmo you the money” How many times a day or week do you hear that? PayPal owns Venmo. How often do you buy bitcoin and get charged by PayPal? PayPal credit? You are nuts if you can’t practically think how this stock fits into your life. Will it be here 5-10 years....why not? That’s why you own it! It is on sale this week!! I bought more!
Holiday Season around the corner. There are only two fintech stocks and that's it. Buy SQ and PYPL. Two global processing providers MA and V. My choice PYPL and V
"Still holding strong  with my “quadruple down” PYPL short @ $177, haven’t covered one share. Stairs going up, elevator  going down!"
should close above 113. watch the inevitable ramp to close.
"On Jan 11, Paypal handled over $240M in crypto volume. This was ONE DAY...https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-volume-on-paypal-hits-record-242-billion/We can extrapolate this out to $10-20B in volume for the first quarter, assuming an average volume between $100-200M daily, although it could be more than this, perhaps as high as $30B volume.They are earn 1.5% minimum per transaction + a spread to bring this closer to 4-5%.This translates to $200M on the low end and $1.5B+ on the high end...I think it's safe to say crypto will contribute $850M+ in incremental revenue THIS QUARTER..To accumulate shares at these discounted price levels is a gift. I picked some up today and will add more in the coming days if it continues to drop.Good luck!"
"Third Point, the activist fund run by Dan Loeb, disclosed a new positions in NXP Semiconductors NV and PayPal Holdings Inc. during the second quarter."
It’s ridiculous to blame one over the other. I own both Square and PayPal and love them both. Right now Square is the hotter stock. In 6 months maybe it’s PayPal. Both are in the right sector Fintech.
"Cha bong!!!! Nicely done PayPal, nicely done. Banks loan money and no growth. PayPal moves money with high growth. The velocity is accelerating. $$$$$$$$$ "
Up over $3 before hours? As soon as the market opens it will drop back to 214 which i don't really understand why?
Phillip sold to early on first trade. Back in @80.00. Thanks for the reply JIM.
Anyone who has owned pypl for some time knows this after hours drop is irrelevant. Expect a quick recovery.
What is happening?
On Thursday PYPL will take a big dive. No way around it after the net income hit. It doesn't seem to matter if there are good solid reasons for the decline. When and if it recovers will soon be known.
Next month i hope things get a lot better. This is round two. The sale continues...
Already under opening trades. Question is is it gonna be a hollow green candle or a solid red candle today? I’m going with a solid red candle
"more pypl shares for longs at 110, 115, 120, 125. Please buy."
"IMO, PYPL should just merge or buy SQ, if so, they would almost be unstoppable. Pretty much own the USA and Europe markets in this field."
very interested to see processed transactions for crypto markets. any guesses??? banxa holdings had 111mil 4th and 55mil Jan alone. any estimates here???
uber 2500 p/e. lol.
This and Square seem most likely to benefit from mass inflation
Anyone know if earnings will be announced today or Tomorrow after market close?
Will COnsumer index cause a negative or a positive trend to pAypal
I like square
"Luck so critical. It was only 12 months ago that V is $100 ahead of PYPL, I was seriously considering switching all PYPL to V once the gap close to within $20 bucks. I procrastinate, now PYPL is ahead by almost $60. Overall speaking I still believe there is more confidence in the Dow giant than the Fintech juggernaut, at least from historican perspective and P.E. point of view."
"Whatever you guys said how exciting it is now, l only think that it’s opportunity to sell when any news causes it goes up. Time will tell that I’m right."
MF just sent out the 10 must own stocks to build your portfolio and PYPL was on of them.
Buy here! Do not sell. You will regret it.
Purchased PayPal before earnings. I think we go higher.
Uh oh
Billions in business loans Paypal did and pushed repayment into July are coming.BILLIONS in losses.Ondeck - their main competitor in the space - was just sold after running for 15 years.HUGE bad loan balances r on the balance sheet and will hit Q3.
A correction for many stocks. PayPal will bounce back. A small bump on a long road.
Its a beat!
high volume close under the 50dma. very rare. very negative.
What is a good buy point? News article says now is not the time to buy. Any ideas?
$110 today? We will see!!
"Far right nut cases are almost identical to the far left in their belligerence and selfish behavior. Fortunately this country is being run by moderates, extremists don't have a chance. PYPL will be back in a day or two."
"Ok, I predicted last week's high of $88, I predicted that we would only get to a possible $91 after the earning report (Sorry the high since the earning came out was only $90.53). So now will you polyanna $95-$100 a share price prognosticators listen to someone who has been in since the stock was $31? What is happening now is no different than what has happened in prior earnings reports. A run up to new highs and then a pullback after earnings come out. The only difference to this pullback as opposed to the others is that the board has OK'ed the $10 billion buyback increase. While I would rather the board issue either a special dividend or institute a dividend payout schedule I understand that this is the continued course that the Paypal board and management are pursuing. So, if you are interested in my prior predictions look back on my posts and you will see my forecasts for the coming year. And yes, I too think we will break $100, just not as fast as many of you want Paypal to. Have a good weekend all and STAY LONG!"
https://www.dawn.com/news/1463195great news for Paypal! Pakistan government actually chasing PayPal for it's services! Global expansion is under way- we haven't even scratched the surface. Lately I've been seeing a lot more government services starting to use PayPal.

Still climbing!........ Strong Fundamentals!
Anytime CNBC recommends a stock it's usually too late!
Brilliant!!
Looks like a triple top has formed for PYPL. Probably best to sell and let it sell off then buy back two weeks before earnings and catch the run up.
"Ok ladies and gentlemen, we are now getting near, I believe, a tipping point. It has been brought up before that Paypal may be a possible acquition. The card companies, banks, and even Google have been thrown out as possibilities. While I agree that Paypal may be an acquisition target, my belief is that it may come from private equity firms wanting to take Paypal back private. Ridiculous you say. Not so fast. Paypal was a private entity right after it was spun off from Ebya. Why can't it be again? After all, all it would take is for a bid of say $85, a nearly 16% premium at today's closing price and then the company and its new partners could go back to being a private concern without having to worry about stupid, idiotic, market manipulations like yesterday's closing absurdity. I would gladly sign up with any equity group wanting to make that deal. Imagine not having to worry about losing market share in one day what a month of great news has brought us. After all, the financials for Paypal have not changed one iota but we see this drop because of a bogy man mentality! $85 too cheap you say? Well at least the financial world could then make a rational argument and decision on Paypal's true worth instead of keeping the share price low."
Like it or not PayPal and square have linked themselves to Bitcoin. Fundamentals won’t matter if Bitcoin takes hit.
Said it last year and I am still on track... by this year's third year anniversary this stock should be at the $88-$90 range
love using visa for the rewards and credit building when given the option tween payal and visa. zero rewards and zero credit building with pypl. why use pypl again?
"While earnings will be important, don't forget that a potential major boost could come next week at PYPL's 'Analyst Day'. Depending on their 3/5 year forecast, and the language the leaders use, this could lead to serious price target increases (or not) and significant moves. I worked for PYPL for over 16 years and the one thing that concerns me is the reluctance of Meg, John, and now Dan to 'soften the excitement' despite the incredible track record. They need to come out bullish."
PLZ SELL SO I CAN BUY
Josh Brown has a long position in Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and he thinks the stock is going to $250. He sees it as a bank of the future.
I guess the SP of LSPD kissed the high 70s one last time. Uptrend to catch up with $PYPL & $SQ and eventually $SHOP.
"For those interested in statistics : from PayPal’s IPO ( mid 2015 ) till March 2019 it was sub $100 per share : 45 months. Then spent 20 months sub $200. Now has only taken 3 months to touch $300. There is no reason why that trend shouldn’t continue with the roll out of more services and features, plus blow out numbers of new clients and crypto adoption"
"Very light pre-mkt volume. Some cautiousness with Bitcoin movement and SQ earnings. SQ expected to surpass estimates, however investors need to understand that SQ revenue base is unlike PYPL. I still see PYPL as having tremendous potential and continuing growth short & long term. Expect to see some analyst upgrades if the 161 floor holds. GLTA!"
PYPLwill be above 266 tmr!️️️
Loaded More!!!Lets go back to 300!!!
Why the recent Guggenheim downgrade to SELL. Crazy...
All time hi d�#$%$}heidz!
Added more today. Visa as well. In it for the long haul.
gonna be a new record soon. Bitcoin going up over the months has helped PayPal alot
It’s testing $80 and falling back down. Watch for a technical breakout if it goes past $80.
Jeez FINALLY back up....I've been bag holding at $120 since July
"Looks like the two weeks prior to end of March was the low for many stocks. PYPL got down to the eighties and today it is over $150. It was scary looking back even for a patient long and everything was down significantly day after day. I stayed long and just lighten up on my stock portfolio just a little and nimbled on some stocks. Picked up some MA, MS, RDS-B with dividends and still hunting. God Bless and stay well."
I think its about time we beat the all time high today!
Got in yesterday before earnings and I’m holding for the rest of the year
Money seems to be moving out of big caps and into small caps these days. Mogo may just become the paypal of Canada and is breaking out.
300 a share (or more) or bust! PayPal and Square are both fantastic companies and I don't see them slowing down anytime soon - and PYPL has a far higher EPS too!
Stop losses triggering with Ebay adding new payment processor. Let's see where we go from tomorrow. Would not be easy ride.
I expect another earnings beat. Analysts have set the bar vey low and they had a big beat last qtr. There deal with Uber will help and not spending money on Facebook's cryptocurrency will also help.
It will break 150 today. Wait and see.
Hard to believe we're not at $63 by now in after-hours.
Cramer fawning all over PYPL with its CEO on Mad Money. Could not have been more emphatic that not only is the stock going much higher but we are in the very early innings. Online payments is such a huge and exploding market and PYPL is in such a strong leadership position that JC equated the “A” word on them. Amazon-like ..... to the moon Alice!
"full of shorties, don't trust them, research by yourself"
oh my it actually wants to go green finally
"My Paypal journey started in 1998 with 50 shares of EBAY on day 1. haven't touched it since!!!!thank you EBAY, thank you Paypalvery happy"
"Strong action today, very bullish if we close ATH today"
Don't get snockered into this BS about an end to a run up. your being played by the institutional trading conglomerate
"apple releases ""venmo killer"". next day paypal up 2%...lmao"
"Stayed strong through a rough opening Monday, compared to some other stocks"
Here is an infographic showing why serving the unbanked is a massive opportunity for PayPal:https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180505_SRM909_1.png
Anyone know whats going on with PYPL? Why the stock drop
"Pypl go big or go home. Cheers PayPal will allow its customers to buy, sell and hold several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, directly within their existing digital wallets."
I think we are going back up fam
"I bought in at 38 a share... to put it plainly, Pypl isn't done growing. The tech revolution is only in adolescents..."
the economy is collapsing ladies and gents. rates are already too low so no help whatever from rates cuts. pypl has told us to greatly reduce expectations.
"Now I'm worried that the next support is $229,"
$330at the end of this weekTwo more days (each day 10+)11/2 the investor days add 10% more.
Volume coming in. Watch for a break of $78.23 to continue the uptrend. Target: 91.37 at stoxline.
PYPL just bought back 5.15 million shares back
"Anyone who is confused by price action, it was quite easy to predict if you were looking at the level II data. There was a wall of sellers at $300. I’m a long term holder but I was buying put options at $298 when I saw that. Did not capture the entire drop but still took advantage of a very clear technical level. Next time it passes $300 it should become strong support."
let's see if we hold up over 77 today and avoid these morning sell offs of weak hands chasing gains in other stocks.
Such low volume though
Those numbers were put up with one hand behind back
you can now send money on FACEBOOK messenger using PAYPAL.....That's huge said Donald !
I will buy back at $80 for the ride back to $100. Great stock to own long term.
$300 tomorrow
"Where’s Stockstradamus? No-GROW and TEUM not exactly setting the world on fire. To less seasoned investors there is a good lesson to be learned here. Here was a guy that was PYPL’s biggest cheerleader and then at $75 he bailed out only to chase highly speculative cryptocurrency stocks. Greed will kill you in this business. You have a sure thing in your hands with PYPL. Stay the course and enjoy your gains. Stocktradamus if you have your ears on, come on back to PYPL. We will welcome you with open arms. :))"
We hit $74! Roll on $75 amigos :))
thank you paypal! love you!
"just added ""link"" to my cryptocurrency. looking fwd to a solid 3 year increase to $200plus"
This thing is going to >>>>>>>>>>
In at 220 and sold at 300. Back in at 230 for the LONG haul!!
Today was a glorious day. Just the beginning.Enjoy 
not so bad......
What a day!
"I think PYPL will get around 130-140 range and stay there for 1 year or so before the next large push up.This stocks pattern seems to be such as. Consolidate for 1-2 years, then up 50-100%. Then do it all over again.Then again, PYPL young stock still."
Near-Future possibility:https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/paypal-could-get-big-boost-from-expanded-facebook-partnership-analyst.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
"I posted a comment 10 mos ago asking why pypl not above 100, until today and heavily investing in this company that I got my own answer. 1)shares buy back instead of putting in expansion 2) management focus only on seller sides and idolized the one button platform 3) Venmo is outdated and offer no incentive to users compared to cash app 4) makes many unnecessary acquisitions to booster its one button platform..omg I can go on and on...they need to circulate out their top management now!"
Remember NFLX?
"The earlier high 6 months ago was around 86. The reaction low was around 70, a 16/share drop. With the recent surge to new highs after the 6 month correction, i believe PYPL will rally to 102 before any meaningful correction will occur. A bit ""too symmetrical"", but i've seen this type of thing before. A drop of 16 from the high, a rally of 16 above the previous high. Let's see how this plays out. Either way, new highs are coming and there's definite wind behind these sails. Lets have some fun together! Let's all pick a calendar date which we believe will be when PYPL first trades above 100 per share. I'll go first. I'm picking 9/4/18. GLTA"
PayPUKE  has to rise 12% for longs (wrongs) to break even from 3 days ago LOL 
PayPal officially holds a wholly-owned stake in a payment company in China.
"2020 full year EPS guidance: From the 2Q report in July: - PayPal expects GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow ~25%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow ~25%.From the 3Q report today: - PayPal expects GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 37%–38%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 27%–28%.The market's reaction today stinks."
ARK and Cathie Woods bought this Friday. Watch this 8EMA bounce up
Big you can short again at 130. That's when the cup will be fully formed and the handle will be your opportunity to.
Only in this overheated market would a company report both a top and bottom beat and watch its stock price go down. Perhaps a modest dividend would help Paypal get into index funds too!
Walmart move with PYPL - WOW! Watch out Amazon

"""Goldman's portfolio of favorite hedge-fund picks — which draws from 848 hedge funds with $2.3 trillion in gross equity positions — includes stocks like Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, Apple, Visa and Google-parent Alphabet, the note said.

"visa, mastercard, and capital one are giving away large amounts of cash rewards to cc users. lots of credit building going on with cc's as well. never been a more profitable time to be a power user of credit cards. each dollar used from a paypal balance generates a cost in the form of lost credit card rewards. think about how that adds up over a year. Paypal is ULTRA expensive to use."
"I started getting fed up with this stock after it went down to low 70s. I thought about selling at 76-77 only because I was watching other opportunities pass be by. But I didn't. Mostly because most of it was a short term buy and I didn't want to pay taxes o a short term hold. Almost a year now and will make a decision. If this goes over 90, I might let it go. Probably dumb idea, but ..."

Technical breakout as it broke $80
"Squeeze out of the weak hands in the morning, make me run to the door too. Now I come back when every body comes back again. Crammer just said good thing about PYPL, that makes me think to come back. This morning I saw the tick ran 72, which I think It is possible that PYPL will run again on Monday. Now 70 looks cheap. I TOLD YOU."
There will most likely be a technical breakout if it breaks $85

"don""t forget to do your shopping with PaPal."
"Please. PayPal is rich. Square is still trying to break even, plus SQ is all speculation... they don't even have an EPS..."
"Still quadruple down short from 177 and not even coming close to covering one share after reading 1000 posts in here “going to $300.” Reminds me of 2000 and 2008, and we all know what happened then!"
Waiting until after the election to pull the trigger but today is a dip to buy. This will be back over 200 soon and then on its way to 300. The smoke is going to clear soon and shorts are gonna learn the hard way why shorting this stock is suicide.
i cant wait for the dividends
This is NO BRAINER folks! In 10yrs those who bought shares of this will be very wealthy if you’re already not!!! Enjoy the ride! HOT AS FIRE  
PYPL is set to report earnings ... after the bell. You have 20 min to place your bets.
Everyone (ctfd) calm the fuhk down and enjoy. This was a no brainer.
time to buy?
"Goes to $300, it's a strong buy guys"
you guys are over reacting... stay in the long run think where would pypl be in 5 years? a lot higher then it is now

bullish think 
"Watch out for Friday morning, I believe that PYPL will shoot up over 70, because I observe the premium of Call 67, is over 1.50, it is very expensive compare to the stock that is dumped for profit in the last 3 days. I TOLD YOU NOW, BUY PYPL."
I'm very excited for btc spending
Congrats Longs...Now lets hang on and move into the 300's neighborhood. It's a nice neighborhood trust me on this...

Start the countdown........... No sleep till Earnings!
Kevin how’s your short doing
"Re-testing Friday's lows of $224. Might not go all the way down there, but maybe."
Pain. What a bombshell they just dropped during the conference call.
"This is some of the analysts and mutual funds punishing Paypal. Why? The enormous cash horde that the company has. Free cash flow just keeps coming in each quarter. There is no current acquisition plans and the money just sits underutilized. Managaement is very quiet on the stock buyback plan and the lack of any type of dividend (quarterly, ""Special"") stops other mutual funds from investing. No way around it Paypal is being ""spanked"" for being too cash heavy!"
and eBay is up 14% because why?
Mark my wordThis stock will gain +100% every year for the next 2-3 years and then after post-Covid 19 will be up +50% per year every year for the next 10-20 years

Lots of competition coming
"PYPL CEO is incompetent when it comes to communicating with the market and what it should do to support the stock. Last earnings, they release info about an SEC investigation the day after earnings, which they knew about for a good month before. This time out they announce a deal with Visa without supplying any data about how they project the deal affecting earnings. Every time they report earnings, they introduce new uncertainties. The CEO also fails to recognize that this is a financial stock, and should have a dividend like all of it's main competitors have. Hopefully he will learn, but until then, it's amateur hour at Paypal."
marcel...you know pypl only goes up. buy the dip! bearsterns cramer has told us to buy
"i bought 5 $185 put contracts before the bell....... if these numbers stay same by tomorrow morning, i'm swimming in cash."
3 reasons Guggenheim upgraded:1. They are used stock salesman2. They have received an order to sell millions of PYPL shares.3. They are distributing high from lower prices.
I don't know what the market makers try to do with PYPL. It should be 80 this morning. The premium for call 80 and 80.5 is way too high. They may be scare that PYPL may surge up at the close. I suspect that PYPL will hit 80 at the close today.
Love Cathie Woods. She added another 21430 shares of PYPL today to her ARKW ETF
Who thinks this will open higher tomorrow?
"No worries longs. Just hold. This will be back over $200 again pretty soon I believe. It's a bargain here now. I would buy now, or buy more to lower your cost basis per share. Good luck all!"
Yes once we close above 80...85 will be the next wall 90 before ER and 96 after ER pop...dnt chase it.
"I've held pypl since the split from EBAY, it's done very well but : I think they should split the stock to reward shareholders and/or pay a dividend, maybe once a year. what do you guys think ?"
SQ is innovative PYPL is the copier
Trimmed some very long held positions in AAPL and AMZN to add to PYPL position on the massive dips a couple days ago. Saw it as an amazing opportunity that may not be repeated.
"UNH or ANTM pick one. Today is very good time to get health care provider this cheap again. Forget about the BS that AMZN will do health care, IT IS NOT THAT EASY!. The analysts just laugh out loud that ""EASIER SAID THAN DONE """
MGI reports earlier than paypal there digital transaction have jump in last couple months
Wonder why the pre markets have this price dropping...
$SQ will eat Pay Pals lunch
I like Morgan Stanley saying that PYPL at this level will NEVER look this cheap again. I agree. People who bought in 2017 at any level will look back years from now and think how lucky they were. 
Every rise is met with strong selling.
Maintain support buy more and hang on PYPL will be a big winner $200 this time next year no doubt
oh no...tanking
Down more than sq today and down a lot yesterday while sq was up 10%
I just bought 300 shares at $156.48
Everyone talking about SQ today....yeehaw! $SQ $ROKU $PYPL
Tons of tailwinds are upcoming for PYPL which is going to explode!Cherish accumulating...
"This election is the only reason you will be able to buy this under 200. This is your opportunity to buy and hold through this volatility, you will be happy you did. GL and safe trading my friends"
I just bought $90 call for September today at the close I think should be $100 by them
it's time for paypal to buy first data / clover
"If you like PayPal Check FTOC merger with Payoneer, today"
Ebay is going to move away from PayPal. What do you think? Figure out yourself 
"Big, dead money here? Are you kidding me? PayPal ended day in green."
"COVID pandemic is now beyond control. States now going on full shut down, closing hundred of thousand businesses, so it will be back to tele-working and on-line ordering. At least one stock should be profitable from it all. It is going to be an ugly week for the markets if sentiment a d panic repeat itself."
PayPal up $$7.46 yesterday... just in consolidation mode today before heading to $300 and beyond... PayPal onward and upward!
"$SQ $PYPL, has anyone heard about this week kept secret called $TW?"
Robinhood can close and PYPL can be another Brokerage???Wonderful so many business!!!
Paypal should have bought Square. Too late now
"Please stay below 75 before I get the next pay check, thanks!!!"
pointless to sell here / market maker needs to cover short don’t give a single share mostly buyside in after hours
What the heck? MercadoLibre UP NEARLY 11% and we only show less than a 1% price increase for Paypal? By my rough calculations we have added nearly $408 million since Paypal acquired shares earlier this year. This is a serious attempt to keep Paypal stock price DOWN!
These stocks options premiums only for sell:PYPL/SHOP/MELI/SQ/NFLX//
"PYPL indicated up this morning. Don't sell rate cuts coming end of July,and Sept.sept"
"Potential new 2021 services being discussed by management that would add to the bottom line and customer engagement: stock trading, support for additional crypto currencies, ability to *spend* crypto currency from PayPal(involving vendors and consumers), ""high"" yield savings accounts. Exciting times!"
Say what now?...........
Stock just wants to go up heading into a blowout ER.
Told you’s 100x buy Square short PYPL......
Stocks like Pypl are a win LONG TERM. I rebought at $82. It dippes 70. I held and now 110. How can complain with 15-40% return per year?
Payoneer which recently begin to apply for a payment license in China and the local competition such as Lian Lian and Ping Pong will erase PYPL in China.
Going to $300
"UP, UP, AND AWAY FOR PYPL!!! GO PYPL GO!!!"
too late to buy. move up too fast
Pypl shares 90 percent institutionally owned.. combined with 20 million shares short = double down
super low volume up day. real buyers non existent.
SQ crypto bet paid off bug time. Pypl played it safe but are on track to also benefit greatly from this new venture.
EXPLOSION.Ahhhhh
we are closing green guys keep buying this deeps and holding remember earnings coming soon
"Just finished the conference call .. ""we understand this is our moment and we plan to capitalize on it"". Lets see why this company will continue to grow: announced partnership deal with CVS to roll out QR codes in their digital wallet (PayPal & Venmo) to complete purchases. Should be in all stores by years end. There is a huge shift towards digital payments. More industries are moving to the digital economy. Venmo will be rolling out new features such as business profiles, direct deposit, credit cards, and QR codes. I am young myself and I can tell you that everyone I know uses Venmo to pay each other rather than cash. They also mentioned that the use of e-commerce is still up big in areas where shelter in place orders have relaxed. Finally, they are seeing huge growth by being used on Shopify and Etsy's platforms. Short term price movement does not matter. Buy the dips and hold for years."
I'm sick of hearing about square . Pay pal's the future banks
Tech is getting routed! I have a small position in pypl. Waiting for an opportune time to back up the truck.
Strong close. 85.81.
This very well could be down after hours and green tomorrow. We see that happen a lot.
Cashed out. Too many groups getting ready to short this heavy. GLTA 5 day 15 min way down at $145.98 not going to get caught holding the bag this time.
The homework I been doing PayPal Should be in the low 90's By the end of the week. a 100 by March

How does pypl normally react post ER?
Of all the stocks in my portfolio I see PYPL giving the best return over the next 6 months. It has a history of rebounding quickly. Of course being a solid company helps.
Stock should be at $100. Undervalued. But will get there shortly.
too many positives to keep this flat. algos will stall eventually.
Anyone making fun of my $177 short now? Quadruple the shares. Was rotflmfao @ $210
: ATH !
Selling with a greating earning is unsustainable. Believe this is a great buying opportunity.
I sold A LOT today sorry about the share price people ... I'm moving my money to AMC  best of luck
"Other than cash for buybacks, is there any good news for PYPL at the moment? It seems to be stuck in neutral right now."
"Yeah, Ark bought a big chunk between $250 - $280 just 2 weeks ago, then sold 1/3 of PYPL holding on Friday. Wood is a real ""expert"" or eggspert."
"I hope we outperform SQ today, they were deep in the red. If they caught up to us or beat us today my opinion on PYPL will change."
everything bought just above 101 was DUMPED at just above 102.
"Of all the things, Reg T margin requirement comes into to force a close of my position, I had to, don't want my other shares to be liquidated.but I made my meagre profit.... 120 USD for a 12000 USD value position... (this stupid yahoo doesn't allow me to post the picture of proof lol)Was wanting to close it at 245$-250, I am seeing a tightening of the Bollinger Bands (upper and lower getting closer to each other), usually an indication that a price movement is going to happen sooner than later.Have a good night...... cheerioStill think short term bullish, 245$-250$ at the very least, and perhaps longer term"
Goldman to the rescue!! Amazon will NOT effect PayPal. Visa or MC
PayPal poised to pop gang! GROW now up 6%!!!
"the only bad news I can find is the CEO show 10,000 shares but he still has over a hundred and forty thousand shares, that's plenty of skin in the game, hopefully PayPal will recover quickly from today's drop"
"just bought again, have waited so long to buy back"
Don't miss out on earnings beat tomorrow morning. Either add or buy lots of call options. Easy $$$ when PYPL beats and exceeds.
"paypal will keep riding the pandemic, but once it's over, this company will go down hard. they are literally pickpocketing sellers to increase their own profits, they will go down along with ebay, as sellers are really looking for alternatives due to the constant, new rip off policies. ebay, paypal's mommy and main client was struggling in the EU, as sellers were leaving the site because of the sh*tty customer service, high fees and constant fraud and now the newly intoduced pickpocketing policy by paypal. i'm using both companies for 6 years, but the supply had never been as low as it was between last November and February. The 2020 balance sheet will look fine due to the covid and pick pocketing, people will push it up as well, but the first quarterly report after the end of the pandemic should be the selling point."
PYPL forward p/e exploding upward! Last chance to liquidate above 90.
"Already 235 in the premarket. This goes up really fast, fuelled by BTC and ARK. Was about to add more but perhaps I should wait for a small pullback. My buying point is still 215."
Take me to the moon
DO I HEAR $85.00 TODAY??
What do people think of PayPal and its share price? Who are long? Who are short?
"This is what it looks like when everything comes together. Earnings, deals, analysts, sentiment etc.."
"Lest we forget, it's the leader in the number 1 economy in its field and has expanded into the number 2 economy recently"
"oh my God what should I do. I have 359 shares. Worth about $30,000. Should I do a day order now or see how it looks in the morning."
"Confirmation that trading multiple is good, forward guidance up. That $80 ceiling should now be broken and we should be moving up to triple digits."
Will someone tell me why anyone would buy bitcoin at a 3.5% cost then you can't bring any BTC into your account and you cannot send it out? What is the point of that when you can buy it for much less on an exchange then transfer and sell hit much higher on another exchange. Why bother with paypal?

Told you all to buy SQ after the eBay news. SQ up 75% since then.
"Have you considered that consumers will be buying online yes, but buying LESS then pre-COVD?! And how does PYPL compete in-store with cards that allow you to tap and pay which is quick and easy?!"
"PayPal price target raised to $275 from $234 at Deutsche BankDeutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane raised the firm's price target on PayPal (PYPL) to $275 from $234 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. A survey of 817 U.S. mobile tech-savvy participants indicates the adoption of e-commerce and mobile payment services has accelerated, Keane tells investors in a research note. Deutsche's survey highlights the increased ""secular shift"" to online payments and higher engagement with FinTechs, particularly PayPal and Venmo, as well as better penetration and adoption of digital financial services for Square's (SQ) Cash App, says the analyst. He sees FinTechs expanding further into traditional financial services, taking share from incumbent banking models."
Will reach a new high soon.
"Has anyone seen this video, of how PayPal might be the next Reddit trade action? It was on Fast Money News on CNBC yesterday 2/11. Paypal had to reach $300 today for some reason at close it was around $298 and reached $300 after hours. I hope the link works and you can view the video. If not try to find it, it's interesting. Please comment what you think."

Party just getting started
"Liquidating my PYPL on the next up day. It is a shame since this stock has doubled for me in the last year. I have an old account from the eBay days and even have the Paypal Mastercard, but don’t believe in owning stocks that get involved in politics and just found out like Google and Facebook, PayPal is now banning people for political content reasons even though it hurts their own revenue. Will have to move my PYPL funds to SQ."
"Bitcoin going to breakout to $20,000 once it pierce thru $15,000!!! Over $13000 already!"
PayPal gonna take off AGAIN soon. Don't miss out. Up and up we go
With this profit growth ratio PayPal is not even expensive. Should be only a matter of time to climb a new ath
"Adyen is a financial start up.. most likely ebay owns a chunk. This is a deal that may have major negative repercussions for ebay.. it could become a disasterous move, in hindsight, and shift people toOther platforms like amazon to sell"

It’s funny that ppl come here to complain about how PP is run . “They never answer their phone “ lol .Eat it up shortie
"Is this a buy,or by ?"
This is a strong buy right now in my opinion. SQ up huge with a P/E ratio far higher than PYPL. Just some profit taking today. We’ll see 200 in no time.
EBay income stops 07/31 will have to be included in earnings meeting. No way it's priced in.
Daily volume in 2 hrs. I bet $SQ prints $150 before $PYPL. I also bet that SQ would print $100 before PYPL. We’ll see.
the kids will be buying crypto on PYPL once they get their $1400 free checks
BOOOOOOM........ HOME RUN !!!!!!

Crypto news ensures PayPal will always maintain a competitive edge. They are not not going to stand idly by. They know how to win and they are not going to stop. With Dan Schulman at the helm fighting to democratize financial services, this is a true value stock that will continue to bless the lives of many especially the underserved.

"I'm long, just entered now, but my plan was only to buy for the short term, and exit around 250$ per share, I might stay Long if I can justify it won't go lower in the longer term this weekend after I do some deeper investigating, but for the moment a retrace is very very likely, at least to near or to 250$ per share before it keeps going down.Short-Term -> Bullish,Medium-Term -> Bearish,Long-Term -> probably BullishI personally do not feel like investing in this company, not at this price, maybe I will trade long term, either way, if I plan to go longer, a more strict stop loss will be needed in my opinion, the price is a bit too high at the moment, maybe it would be better around 150$-200$ per share..."
I’ve been in since $53 not leaving today no matter what happens
i believe 110 is doable today

This whole thing is a hoax and a joke. This will pass, just like the tax bill. We will move up again very soon gang. Stay tune!!"
I bet you SQ will hit $100 for the second time before PYPL hits $100 for the 1st time. all you PayPal pumpers still here or have you all sold for a loss and bought SQ on its dip?

"Keep selling Square. They are in for a rough time. They have a very demented CEO who puts his personal opinions and beliefs before the businesses he is mismanaging.Further the competition is superior, and the business owner who suffered under the oppressive Governors that Dorsey supports will not be utilizing SQ.$PYPL for one is the way to go.Jack Dorsey is a toxic, sick excuse for a human being. 75 million + Americans will not forget his actions and what he was an accomplice in and with who."

"Lot of growth left for PayPal. Had great year and 4th quarter earning report. will still be an option for buyers to use on ebay at least until 2023. If you still have a PayPal account, why would you use something else on ebay. I know I wouldn't switch. PayPal is secure convenient and easy to use for checkout."

I was shopping on eBay today and the option to pay by PayPal disappeared. it's not even an option.....I wonder how much of PayPal's revenue was from eBay...

"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) : Cramer sat down with Dan Schulman, president and CEO at PayPal (PYPL) , the payment processor that aims to conduct over $100 billion in mobile payments in 2016. Schulman said that PayPal is on track to be a leader in mobile payments. The company had more than $1 billion in such payments on Black Friday alone. He was also bullish on Venmo, PayPal's subsidiary, which is rapidly becoming the way millennials manage their money, Schulman said. Venmo is expected to conduct $20 billion in payments this year.PayPal is also hard at work creating new partnerships with the likes of Visa, Mastercard (MA) and other traditional payment processors. Schulman said that while it's still too early to judge the results of these partnerships, he's encouraged by what he sees.Cramer said that PayPal is undervalued, given that it's one of the few companies that offer investors real growth."

Jeff Cantwell drives the stock down for a lower buy-in point! These analysts are all so transparent. Put 'em all together and make duck soup.
PYPL is nearing serious resistance. A gambling man may want to trim a bit near its 52 week high in hopes of buying it back in the mid 80s.
"With Apple, Amazon, and Google entering this space it may be time to take a hard look at the environment PYPL is operating within. Are they a take over candidate? Will they have their market taken over by big Tech? If the big Tech companies are going to be successful at financial transactions, and they will, then companies like PYPL won't be able to compete. I am going to consider getting out of my long position here given what is coming."

Holding PayPal until after Q4. Should smash earnings but the crypto feature is the icing on the COVID holiday cake.
$5 is the share price of the world's largest bank DB. Not one shred of news about this bank failing. Not one.
What do you guys think about Square? Obviously alot more debt then paypal but I see it everywhere. Add it to the portfolio along with the paypal i already own?
Ebay consists of 10-13% of PYPL revenue. They have a contract through 2020. All EBAY did was add an extra payment option. Complete over reaction. BUY DURING FEAR. Pypl smashed earnings and has been preparing for life without EBAY for years now.

"Killed that earnings report , it's gunna run all year holidays coming."
What's up with the insider selling?
This is probably the best results PYPL is going to have for a while. They had a good revenue from processing all the small business grants. The revenue mostly just came from PPP loan processing and small business bailout cash. At 100 PE and best of all the transactions it can possibly have is the trigger to exit. I am exiting my 3500 shares that i have been long since $60s today and tomorrow. This may go up until tomorrow and can break $200 before it loses steam.
everybody like SQ .Sell your PayPal. so I can bye
"PayPal will gobble up market share in the crypto arena from Square once this platform gets rolling. PayPal is huge, and this bitcoin adoption was inevitable, only a matter of time. Square got a head start in the space but PayPal will take the victory lap. In almost every aspect PayPal’s services are more widespread, secure, and overall better than square’s."

"Been holding this since right after it was spun off from eBay in 2015 . . . Liked the growth potential, operating leverage, and high (very high) incremental ROIC from investing in growing both sides of the business . . . Still holding, for all the same reasons . . . If it traded at $500 per share tomorrow, would I sell? . .. Probably not . .. In 5 years it might be trading at $1,500 . . . In 10 years from now? . . . Who knows . . . People like growth, so it trades at a higher premium now relative to current estimates - but not all growth is equal, and high incremental ROIC growth is hard to find . . . PYPL has a lot of it, most companies don't . . ."
Investors Business Daily just said today: This is a new entry point 
plz take me to the moon!!!!
Why can't PYPL hold a price ?
Mad Money/Jim Cramer said they are selling some of their portfolio and going big into Paypal.
Let’s take down $100 ASAP. Once we do it comes into play for a long a Institutions who only buy stocks over $100. Future is bright Amigos.
"PYPL IS A SCREAMING BUY RIGHT NOW....Is PYPL Stock A Buy Right Now?In the recent stock market rally, PayPal is extended past a 215.93 buy point in a cup base, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis. With the stock finding support at its key 50-day support level, the stock is a potential buy.PayPal is a long-time IBD Leaderboard member. According to Leaderboard commentary, ""PayPal has reached its profit targets, but the stock is now in a new buy area. The stock is rebounding from its 10-week line, which offer a follow-on buy area."""
Every dip gets bought.. will probably close green if the market holds up.
Disappointing day for PYPL especially with my other stocks having a blowout day. This stock will move when you least expect it. Probably some big announcement so hang in there
$300 very soon
"Conference call quote: “These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies,”"
http://alph.st/ba9efb94 I would prefer $PYPL than $EBAY. This company is not diversifying its businesses like $AMZN
Just shorted. Thanks for the runup. Low risk/high return. You guys are the best-SMOOCH.
Buy these record highs as the global economy burns. what could go wrong?
Why did this start performing so badly all of a sudden?
It is very ridiculous how a stock goes up and comes down so fast in a mater of days. 2 weeks ago 300 plus today almost a $75.00 dollar haircut from 2 weeks ago. This is what is called market manipulation. Hedge Funds bringing this back down just so they can run it back up again to 350. Its legal so why not. Just hold and it will run back in no time.
Now that we broke thru $115.95 next resistance is $116.70 Buy Buy Buy
Got some money to dump into some options calls... should PayPal be where I invest?

Triple bottom in PayPal at the $230 level. Could see the climb to $250 next week
If you want to know why PayPal isn't jumping after hours it's because the Good news was already built into the price of the stock. it would have to be astronomically good news in order to get a 5% or more bump. look at Amazon from yesterday. they had the best quarter ever and the stock was down today.
Partnership with all sports betting venues will have a substantial impact on PayPal....$100 coming.......
Hope we get the fake morning bounce up $2 then down another $50
Paypal needs 4 months to process my refund for INR? Happy Holidays Everyone!
Stoled shares this morning @ 184>+No brainer! Good news is coming per rumor mill (not heard anything on BH acquisition).
Back to ATH! highs end of the month!
economy in free fall = emergency rate cut
PayPal reached an all time high at 191.81
"SQ eating venmo alive. Will pypl earnings release even mention venmo or just talk about ""other"" hopium investments? Seems like all the banksters are demanded retail playas buy pypl. Why is that?"

Venmo rocks.

PayPUKE  only down 33% this past week not too shabby
#ebay $ebayWhere are all of those ebay trolls that laughed when pypl and ebay split?** crickets **
Check earnings trajectary....PYPL will close over 106 on Friday....huge winner in the payment space.Buy anything under 104.
will crying help?
"Bitcoin & $pypl only use!! read the ACRX news out, ACRX under the radar, game changer one day..."
"It’s a long term hold for me until at least at $300 (within 2-3 years is my guess), so I WILL be adding shares tomorrow if the market insists on temporarily keeping the pps down a few bucks. I have absolutely no problem with their guidance."
"PayPal is a juggernaut , should be part of any serious growth portfolio , I have visa too . Price target 200 after earnings"
pyp 1% short interest. tiny volume on up moves indicates distribution. take a look at dirt cheap silver. 90% junk silver coins are getting harder to come by in quantity.
I subscribe to MF and they just emailed me DG’s 5 best stocks to buy right now and PayPal one of the 5. :))
Apple Pay monthly transactions 4x of PayPal.. yikes
pypl up wonder if it's options related
I’m in!
wow...something is up
"For what's it worth my uncle is a doctor in L.A,He say's Covid will most likely NEVER leave us, much like the Flu.It will continue to mutate and we will develop new vaccines for more strains, much like the Flu.It will come and go at varying degrees year after year, much like the Flu.But of course, more deadly.Soooo, Im betting its good idea to stay in some of these so called ""shut down stocks"" as people will undoubtable choice to do everything ""safer"" for quite some time to come."
Paypal also has a good development in China's online foreign payment business.
It will be great if it holds $80 and forms a support line.
So mad I didn’t get into pypl back in 2019 when it was on my radar.
"just added, nice to still have cash on the sidelines on days like this"
I've told all my friends to buy this and stated on the board several times that one should buy this and not look at it for 5 years. Then watch it grow until you retire on it. 1.4 BILLION folks looking to be entertained. Let it sink in.
"Above average volume and stock move back to its ATH is looking likely with the strong job market, liquidity and fintech merger landscape. IMHO."
Where's the love?
PYPL is lagging behind its peers. WHY? PYPL is the best financial stock out there. Cathie Wood has been loading up on PYPL. 
ARK bought another 24k shares on Friday
"not the greatest day, shorties brought it down. longs will win and shorts will regret it, watch and wait"
Imagine if PYPL did a 4-1 split This thing would hit 400B market cap easy.
buy buy buy. cryto×PayPal. PayPal will skyrocket 
The growth opportunities with Venmo is huge! Compare it to how Instagram provides growth for Facebook!
"Buy,buy, buy!!"
"PayPal should go on a shopping tourexample: Zedge would you say its better to only focus on payment apps? or would you like seeing PayPal being active in other sectors, other mobile applications?regards from Germany :)"
"Max Levchin , the $PYPL paypal co-founder talks about consumer habits at CNBC!! 40 seconds into the clip he says that IRobot sales has DOUBLED !!!!!!! This is absolutely crazy info. Think we will be above $100 before summer is over. Think this will 3X within a year from current levels. Watch the clip and do your own due diligance! Youtube ”Max Levchin CNBC ” its a 5 minute 56 second long video posted april 9th."
"with a cost basis of $85 in an IRA from March 23, 2020 I'm thinking it can't hurt to take out the original investment."
"Strong buy even with the market dropping, paypal is holding its own."
don't buy it cause I own it and everything I own goes down
"Anyone want to see where PYPL is headed look at FSLY, bad earnings like PYPL was $140 or so, fell to $93, everyone was buying, that was last week, hit like $60 today. SO if PYPL follows suit, it should hit $150 by Friday"
PAYPAL GOES TOO FAR. Youve condemned those who organized to go to Rally and have no proof that they did any of the damages. Well there are other payment sites too!Im a Conservative and I own PayPal. Hotler tactics judging guilty with no proof!
Buy now before PYPL reports earnings or hold your horses! $90+ let’s goooo
listening to the cfo on cnbc only made me more confident. this split from eBay is a good thing not a bad thing

Haha @ shorts. You lost money
"Same correction like the one in July, stop freaking out"
PayPUKE $309+ to $284 with no bottom in sight! Wow!
Looks to me like all the tech names are building a base of support including PayPal
Don't listen to trolls. Pypl is expanding. Earth overall more people. More people = more users. I was here from worse. When pypl and ebay ended relationship. This is nothing. Try almost 15% in 1 day. But as always. What happened after? $70-$120. Pypl may sit now for a year or two before the next large run up. $160-200 by 2021-$2022. Realistic numbers.
Seriously? Downgraded by Brendler. Let's hope he won't influence the price today.
Everyone pulled their money out of paypal & put it into SQ.
Buy BUY BUY!
Sometimes a drop that makes no sense....truly makes no sense. Now onward and upward!
all dips are blue light specials. go all in on pypl.
Bubble man . You are every message board ? So who is investing this before earning ?
Honey acquisition at 4B? OMFG! Have they lost their marbles? Is this why PYPL management has been fleeing in droves?
PYPL $215 by the end of this week would be sweeeet.
Anyone think it will go negative tomorrow?
Pypl should be at least $100 atm imo. Hopefully we get something this year... Its been flat
Couple more days to the astounding news of great user numbers ^^^^^^up we go
"I myself enjoy the occasional dips like yesterday, allows me to buy discounted PYPL shares."
new highs by one point everyday until the money helicopters get good and empty.
This is so predictably sell before earnings...the market is so f-en rigged..this will be back at 250plus don't be scammed....
Next week we hit all-time highs
Any thoughts about today's earning release?
buy more when down i bought at 82 last month then sold at 90 4 weeks later
Come on Danny. Big ER!
Turn green at close.ARK keep loading up
PayPal is a foster child of eBay now.
200 day moving average $82.20. Bears are in control
Happy to have sold completly V for PYPL in the last 3 months.
Brilliant! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo5GvdAaoM
"It's going to be a great day.... been touting PayPal for a year now. There's only good things with this company, and it'll get even better. Please stay tune."
"PYPL missed on top and bottom last quarter and barely beat revenue target this quarter. With a vaccine imminent, this stock's growth potential will tremendously slow down."
Looks like the 99/100 level is the base being built.Earbings being the catalyst for the next gap-up.

sq down and pypl up today look at the valuations
"it is highly doubtful that the Chinese will embrace pypl's policy of freezing accounts, putting holds on funds..indefinitely, and banking of of float. not gonna happen."
Consumer spending is up 5Xs expected. Banks are up 25% over last year. Aren't credit cards and PayPal the benefactors? The stock market is crazy.
What do u think about today guys?
"Just throwing this out there.. a ton of Shorts are betting on a sector rotation out of tech, but with Covid spiking and shutdowns coming back, many institutions arent going to rotate just yet. Shorts could get burnt hard on this bet causing tech stocks to make another leg higher. Many analysts are saying the vaccine is priced in with the huge drop last week so the Pfizer news may not be as big as some shorts think. My two cents."
"Looks like it is entering breakout mode. This is a company with REAL earnings. Not buying on the come so to speak. Whose clients (of which I can proudly say I am one) are very sticky and not going anywhere. Besides it’s a pain in the butt to change. Plus every time you add a new user you actually are adding several more because they will bring in their contacts to share PayPal with. No need for routing numbers, bank account numbers etc. No security issues. Simple and safe. And with their stranglehold on Milleniums their future is great. A no brainer investment if you ask “moi”"
"With the .25 immediate withdrawal feature / let’s do math..22 million transactions per day x .25 cents = 5 million x 90 = 450,000,000 in additional rev per quarter / granted not everyone uses this feature however it’s going to add at least 350,000,000 in revenue and my transactions per day are probably a little low"
"$21 more dollars to my earlier forecast July 1, 2018 price. Now I'm looking for $105."
"Wow, it keeps getting better, holding to at least $300."
Could be worse. Could be SQ.
"This could be $200 within months. Crypto buy/sell, send/receive is a nice revenue stream to tap into. It definitely helped SQ"
Investor Day must be going well.
"PAYPAL HAS JUST ANNOUNCED : it will introduce “Pay in 4” onto its Australian platform, to follow its success in the USA... to compete with Afterpay. Thus making it available to the 9 million PayPal users here in Australia ! This shall widen the user-base over here!"

PYPL boom....shaka laka.
From Bezinga Hearing Amazon Looking to offer discounts to retailers us Amazon Pay.It showed on my TD Ameritrade News Feed on pypl.
Futures are up nicely. Hopefully PYPL be back to $300 soon
"when, not if, the fake reserve stops supporting stocks."
Earnings estimate of $0.54 and earnings whisper of $0.56. Not much of a beat if it’s accurate. Still impressive though as it’s higher then 2017 Q4 ($0.55) And that’s when everyone spends a lot (x-mas).
"wow, 200000 in one day ( just exaggerating like all shorties, that`s how it feels like), wow market is up, wow you will ruin your portfolio if you go shortguys it is an up + down+this company is healthy"
"For external transactions, once a user passes a threshold of withdrawing more than RMBY20,000 (US$2,897), a transaction fee of 0.1% kicks in. Merchants are also charged a fee of 0.55% on the flip side to every purchase"
Cramer must be pumpin it now.SQ has a 210 PE.PYPL should be higher.
"EBAY used to charge 8% of final price excluding shipping cost from sellers. Now it charges 10% of (final price with shipping cost). I used to find many good deals on EBAY, but rarely now. It is way less attractive ."
"Just like every pull back every stock gets thrown out with the bath water - great time to pick winners over losers and buy in at a discount. This will double it's growth in two years so thanks to all the runners, weak hands and uninformed here, maybe go and buy Bitcoin or something else more speculative."
"Looks like PYPL is repeating what was going on last year...and the same crazy upward movement will follow, just like the 1st half of 2019. The longer a spring gets pressed, the harder it will bounce up."
"The blind cannot see, the deaf cannot hear, and the fool is both blind and deaf for what he sees and hears and misinterpreted. Paypal had its best quarter during COVID-19, travel restrictions and declining incomes. The stock has far more potential, go ahead sell. In two years this company will one of the few companies which will double what its worth today. It does not matter for Paypal if orange man wins or sleeping Biden."
Might be selling my share soon.Only when SQ shares drop a bit.
"The way the market is reacting to the Ebay news reminds me of an old saying my dad and mom used to say, “You are throwing the baby out with the bath water!”"
$160 after mad money interview
"What's happening here? Are we still worried about Dump cancel culture / mass closings of Paypal accounts, and new regulations of tech companies as a result? If I have to lose money due to Dump supporters whining about the election results, then so be it."
IT'S WAY OVERSOLD FOR FULL WEEK ALREADY....TODAY'S GREAT ...GREAT DAY TO BUY THE DIP BEFORE TOO LATE....
Ebay sent me an email today notifying me that it would be adding a new payment option. I replied to the email stating that I will never use ebay once paypal is not an option. YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME! Let them know where you stand.
"Dang, sold at 88. Wish this thing would come back down to earth now..."
"Debbie Downer Big won't stop crying! Keep it up, your pain is my joy!"
The pull back is not justified on any company data at all. In fact the earnings reports showed an increase of growth not a slowdown. But people want to believe that somehow Paypal is slowing down. They are deluding themselves and falling victim to a short game.
NOTHING MATTERS ON EARNINGS. This chart is completely broken. It would need to go to $95 to break the down trend that is in place.
Going back to $70
Bull trap
So sad that this stock is starting to rebound. Bought in at $175 but didn’t get a chance to make a full position
So what it will recover
This is a tough stock to buy since it rarely dips!
"Listening to the conference call, not sure who in their right mind would be selling and not buying aggressively."
I am happy to exit at 120 PE.Far better than the standard PE of 12 for a growth company in recession. Share price would just be $20 a piece at 12 PE.
"when a stock is showing a 52 week high , it means no one is underwater, why is this important.1 future investors are attracted to stocks that have showed long term positive action.2 , as no one is underwater, it means they aren't looking or a break even price to ""get out"""
"I see this trading pattern before, PYPL went up to 74+, then pulled back. I guess PYPL will go up over 74 again this afternoon."
"Here's to a better week, to go from $309 to $266.... Let the climb back begin. Love PYPL, been a great year owning it."
Finally breaking through resistance and onto new unchartered territory!
"Cramer said on Mad Money tonight that he thinks PYPL will go MUCH higher. Also in an article in The Street, he talks about a new FANG quartet of stocks forming and he lists PYPL as one of the four. Vis a vis the de facto leader in ECommerce, which is exploding. The story can’t get much better but some people are scared of success and a winner and won’t do anything even when it’s staring them in the face as PYPL is doing. Pity."
should be back to 86 today
Time to buy!
CNBC guest just said PYPL is way undervalued!
Sports betting in most of the country hasn’t opened up .Rec marajuana has yet to open up soon to be federally approved ...2 huge markets for fin tech !
Thank you guys for the dip!! Wanted to load up after selling $QS. Now let’s take it back to 220
I love how people listen to the analyst that weren't good enough to do what they wanted which is work for Goldman sachs. so they took a job at Guggenheim.
Support at $93. Last 1st highs of $93 will serve around the support of this coming lows before exceeding higher than $120.
"Is this ETF worth the 1% management fee? Definitely better than the 2% fee for $GBTC, but why not just open a $PYPL account and buy Bitcoin fractions there?"
I believe we can see $215 this week!
Im a 20 year old college student waking up and making $300+ off of trading stocks. I wish I knew about this in high school. PYPL was a big winner for me today!
Extremely encouraging Motley Fool article on PYPL.“...analysts predict annual revenue growth of 23% over the next five years.”https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c6eac7d8-c44f-3e8b-8b97-467d770b63ef/should-you-start-your-war-on.html?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo
I figure that your chances of actually catching Coronavirus are around 2%
PayPal will end the week around $194... better bail

"THEY GAVE UP. SELLING IS OVER,"
300 today so ez
This stock is the pits
Shorts and sellers came out of nowhere. I'm still holding PayPal :)
Who else loves the fact that we're in striking distance of $PYPL whose market cap is over 3X SQ. Love!
"Hey Big, how your short position going?"
If your making money off Paypal and Square give me a thumbs up
Just Believe
Very upset about the performance of Paypal in the last 3 days.On a positive day in the market still can not even hold above 107.00...
"So glad i bought back in below 80. I have owned PYPL for years well before the IPO while it was still part of EBAY. Happy to have it back, i feel as i am missing something without it."
$100 by next month! $120 by end of the year.
Who sees this stock gaining another 30% this year?
Feel bad for people buying $pypl here when $ftoc let alone $bft will replace them
"Pypl should buy mogo before it goes higher. I own both, but really like what I see going on with mogo."
"I said it last night does anyone believe that management did not prepare for this and have clients in the bullpen? If not, what does that say about PayPal management?"
So much for square beating PayPal to $100 after the market drop.
"I am happy with PYPL. I was at a lost of 10% once with this stock over 1.5 years ago. I kept. I didn't add nor sell, but now up about 38% Sure, its not 400%, its not 200%. BUT PYPL is one of those safe stocks that even in worst of worst times, will survive and continue to grow. It is not nationwide, but worldwide. I am happy for a steady nice 10-40% per year return. PYPL long term investment stock."
"paypal dropped from 91 to 82, but avg price target raised from 90 to 95.67, will be buying more today, long term growth still intact"
Take into consideration that paypal is worth 102Billion while ebay is worth 42Billion. Ebay dropped paypal? More like paypal dropped ebay lol. PYPL is way better off in the future. Buy on the dip tmrw :)
Is $SQ eating PYPL lunch?
Someone shook weak hands out hard today. Upgrade to $170 and this fell. Did the same thing when it got upgraded to $150 then ran up. PYPL typically runs when the rest of the markets are taking a breather. Would not be shocked to see this over 150 tomorrow.
Paypal set to declare a dividend for the first time. Shares will explode overnight.
"cramer said buy paypal up to $98, you guys know what to do tomorrow morning"
bargain price $196 ￼ ￼ 
Tomorrow is going to be a confusing day.
‘Bout friggin’ time!
"Now the question is buy more right away, or wait and see what happens?"
Very disappointed in myself for not buying in before the close. I had a good feeling about it to
I've never even heard of Ayden and expect 95% of Americans haven't either
270$ easily EOD
YES! I said I would wait for the rocket  yesterday!!! 
Easy earnings beat BUT the only thing that matters is GUIDANCE!
Square and PayPal $$$$$$$
The purest way to own all the top fintech names in the payments industry is thru the etf IPAY. Check out its charts.
Look at PYPL rock!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"Dhorts are workind hard to push it down, just like yesterday. But it bounces back every time. It's trying to hold 267-268.00Buy Buy before it goes up."
Can you smell that 52 week high??
"""God Bless"" our little panda friend ""Will"" wished us all 10 days ago when he wrote that he chickened-out at $77.... well, he certainly brought the rest of us good luck back then !!!"
It does hold on bad days.
PayPUKE  down 10%Correction mode Next level is bear  market 20%
New All Time High - let the good times roll
Sensible price valuations for PayPal for next 1-2 years?? Personally.. I think it’s still got LOADS of room to run..
"Nice bounceback for the PYPL....niice. I was kinda ""perturbed"" yesterday, after hours... LOL."
Cryptocurrency is the answer of the future economy?We never know but Paypal has to deal with it. SQ did take a risk today testing to buy bitcoins through SQ on its apps or mobile whatsoever. How’s about PYPL? I have no idea but it would be interesting.
"Guys.. just finished listening to investors presentation. My thoughts:- projecting some amazing numbers for next 5 years - great roadmap. They have a lot of very useful products that will easily catch on- this is all organic growth. If they do M&A, they can grow their numbers even faster - all world trends favour them. The move to a cashless economy will continue - they have BOTH the merchant and consumer side (not many companies do!)I could go on.... Overall. I predict some very nice growth in the long term."
First close over $86.00
PYPL will be $200 within a year.
Is it MGI and BABA failure to merge or what. It got to be big otherwise PYPL will not pup 2 points.
Price target raised to $95. Just say YES.
https://www.researchsnipers.com/paypal-launch-in-pakistan-expected-by-february-2019/
why is it dropping today?
"how is this trading $10 away from 52 week high? what do you guys know that I don't?my guess is, that this has all the good news baked in, and proved for perfection."
Anybody thinking of buying anymore PYPL today. I am.
"Time to short it, strictly as a trade. It's up 50 straight points. Target is $268, then cover."
Just dipped and bought 100 shrs at 174.80 I think the risk is low right here. Could pull back more but not much.
I never invest on what Mad Cramer says....please
Why can't this stock make a move up and hold it?
Paypal has become like a mutual fund. Owning portions of UBER and MELI. It's a little concerning when income comes from outside investments.
Why is it that Square has more stories on this site than PYPL
PYPL and the equity markets: it IS different this time. BUY LARGE!
This is not going to turn red unless market goes down by 2000 points.
"To everyone - BEST to MUTE Harold. He is an internet troll who does this for ""fun"""
"Very excited about the future of Paypal! In my opinion, mobile payments will transform the retail business and it is only a matter of time until a company such as Amazon or Apple teams up to create a juggernaut!"
PayPal just approved Bitcoin transactions. Huge!
New all time high! Up we go!
Hope the upgrade will give PayPal today a bump up on what looks like to be a down day for the markets.
PYPL all over ESPN on the Phoenix Suns jersey. 1 of my fav jerseys in the league lol $$$
"yup, this is the right company to be in"
"PayPal Up a fraction, $teum Up 4%+. It’s going so much higher!!! Get in now gang!! Stay tune."
"I truly believe that Venmo has the potential to turn PayPal into the next Apple. Venmo has made cash irrelevant in person-to-person transactions, which isn’t surprising, as paper money is incredibly inefficient by comparison. With Venmo you never need to wait for someone to hit the ATM or make change, and there’s never any payment disputes because the app automatically records transactions on both sides of the trade, (blockchain?!)The question is, how does PayPal monetize Venmo? Management has talked about opening the platform to businesses and earning revenue from transaction fees like credit card companies. This is a potentially huge source of income, as I believe people would quickly adopt Venmo for business purchases for the same reasons it’s used for p2p transfers: efficiency and convenience. Eventually Venmo will replace debit/credit cards as the #1 payment form, because why wouldn’t it? I already use my phone for everything, why not paying for things? As Venmo takes off, people will start holding cash balances within their Venmo account, rather than immediately transferring money to their banks. This represents another novel revenue opportunity in the form of the interest PayPal could earn on these cash balances. Given the billions of dollars in transactions being processed through Venmo today, the total cash balances held at any given time by app-users must be enormous.Thoughts?"
Yesterday was a bottom. The previous two days were very small loss. We should be good from this point. PYPL - A great company with very good earning and outlook enters into Chinese market. It has a good potential. Jump in now.
You kind of have to buy at these levels.
"Fed just announced $500B short term funding. If there is more drop, QE is supposed to be on the way, then paper money becomes less valuable, so investors need to convert the cash into assets immediately to hedge this possibility."
"AMZN will hit 1240-1250 this week. AMZN is the E-commerce internet and the rest of the internet fight against AMZN. i mentioned AMZN since last week. I will mention again that AMZN will move up another 30 points this week. I will bet on PYPL by end of DEC, not now."
All these upgrades should help PYPL on the road to $80! Christmas might come early.
technical analysis is BS nothing beats fundamentals which PayPal has.If you don't know how the company gets earnings than that's a problem. support and resistance level is BS as simple as that.
PayPal is still heading to $100 a share. The fundamentals have not changed. What I like about PayPal is they have a pile of cash and they will use it if need be to increase shareholder value. Stay long.
Under $255 today...
Paypal is even better than I hoped for.

got 200 PYPL 90 calls expiring in 1.5 hours. paid 4 cents for them. Come on PYPL cross 90 !!!!
Well I warned earlier today to sell and buy SQ who listened still not too late.
"TSNP if you like amazon, you'll love TSNP soon to be HMBL as a ticker symbol, and almost $1.00 a share up over 100% over the last 2 days. Target Price is $300.00 a share. Grats longs on this one.$FB $PYPL"
PLEASE MEMORIZE THE NAME OF THE SENATORS WHO VOTE TO SHUT DOWN. THEN TAKE THEM OUT WHEN THEIR TERM IS UP FOR REELECTION. WE NEED TO PUNISH THEM AT THE BOOTH.
Almost guarantee 10-30% + return Average per year on this stock.
"The only thing that has changed about PYPL over these last few weeks is the stock price. It is still the same company in the lower 200s that it was at 300. Free cash flow is still going to double in 5 years. That is all I need to know to know the market will reward PYPL for that. That is why it is so important to not sell during the bad times. This company and SQ are extreme disruptions to the way business payments get done...they are the future and forward looking. I own both and have added on the dips. Bitcoin will only be further rocket fuel for them to go much higher. The bad times won’t last forever longs. Fintech is one of my favorite industries and is going to continue to embraced by many small businesses...economic reopening will be a boon for SQ, PYPL, V, and MA. Long and strong."
"PYPL'S ceo Dan Schulman made $25.8 million last year and $37.8 million the year before,way to much money. That's our money. When the proxy vote comes out soon I'll vote for no stock compensation."
.big banks will have $300 call options and push the stock. you can also buy Disney which will go to $200. gamestop traders exposed the market. banks buy cheap call options and push the stock so they can exercise those calls. it's double profits for the banks.
$249.85? Really longs? LOL!
earnings to be released at 4:15pm ET
"LET`S GO GREEN FRIENDS - Paypal is ready for the year, Honey Service will definitely be profitable soon if Paypal sends out emails to all customers to download the app... Imagine how many customers would follow... and they all would add to direct margins with the browser application. See you all on the peak"
"I expect to see PYPL at 85+ by Friday, then 86-87 by Jan 31. I tell you the LONGS here that we will see PYPL at around 91-93 on Feb 1"
Sit back and relax. Be patient $100 is heading our way in next 12 months or less.
CHEAP! Shares fo sho
Paypal vs Payoneer $FTOC estimate worth?
One of the reasons I like PYPL is the 23 percent growth rate projected out over the next 5 years. I will give a hard bite at 20 percent or greater. The fact PYPL has a market cap this size and still growing over 20 percent makes me bullish on its future.
Wish I had had the extra cash to put into PayPal when it dropped down to the 80s. Some more high volatile days to come though so will start stacking that investment money again and wait for the next opportunity
I would interpret Amazon Pay's discount offer as a desperate move since they just cannot convince the retailers into using their system. Just too risky. It is like a Troy Trojan from Amazon.
PayPal is on fire!
"So strategic investment gain is because of mark to marketaccounting, seems like a mixed bag of regulations to me."
"Adrian, Venmo is no moat. Cash app is stealing that lunch. The younger generation is on cash app due to boosts. Again, what is PayPal moat? No one can give an answer but cheerlead PYPL. Money can be made on this name both ways short since $118 I didn’t think it would make it back to $120 a second time before ER. Really want to know the moat?"
That's more like it. All my stocks now green. Hope it holds
Great jobTomorrow we continue
Thought this would go up today
This thing wants to run...a caged cheetah.
Called it. Said it would close the week with a new 52wk high
Will PayPal continue to go up?
$200 in 20 minutes
110 today :)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-big-reasons-why-consider-124004943.html
Not selling anything until at least 146 today MARK IT
There goes GROW!!! Right on cue :)
Qiwi out perform PayPal by a wide margin and grow faster with a small baseline in the payment space.
Should we sell some PayPal tomorrow before earnings or hold it? On CNBC options action they said a bunch of puts were bought thinking it’s about to go down below 90 again
So much positive PR lately......... Potential energy is high!
paypal approved for stimulus check distribution
Has anybody checked PayPal’s reviews lately lmao I think people only use it because it’s the only service other than square!
They had some interesting insights about PYPL on http://stocktip.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
panic over we will be green tomorrow
Slow and steady wins the race. Long PayPal!
Dude the news about PYPL loss/notice is more annoying than spamming
no worries guy...it's healthy go down sometimes... great opportunity to buy more stocks... Paypal is one of the best stock...we just have to wait and hold... how many times we have seen these pull-backs?
PAYPAL OR SQ?
"Hunter, Bill, Randy, Anonymous, Dennis, Anthony and William, are you all enjoying your investment in $PYPL? $SQ will print $100 this week. I’m wondering what each of you have to say now at this point? Been saying this for 6 months. I’ll wait a few days to hear from you all"
the local waste collection technician just told me he is getting rich from the stock market.
"Strong volume. If your considering taking a profit today, you could regret it."
Do PayPal subscribers have a peise of the PayPal stock or do they have to buy in
first in China for a payment system? this will sky rocket
"wow, today is the day to buy more, check me in 3 weeks! love this fear!"
PayPal isn't getting eBay transactions starting next year. isn't that their main income?
"Honey before getting bought: around 300 M users --> around 100 M dollars in revenue actually 17 mill. active users --> 5,88 dollar per userNow: paypal platform: 305 M active users: around 200 M adopt Honey --> (200+17)*5,88 = around 1,3 billion in revenue"
"I don't see it down at the moment on Schwab, but glad I didn't pay $116."
"I don't get it. On April 1st, PYPL = $78.64, SQ = 47.68, a $31 dollar share price difference. Dan Schulman and the CFO (Bob Swan) continue to preach 'shareholder value' but other than small gains followed by retreats, we inch along while Square churns up yardage and is now less than $2.00 behind PYPL in share price. I think the problem is that Dan and the boys continue to march out their standard 'guide down' verbiage after earnings. It scares analysts and institutional investors. PYPL has no debt and boatloads of cash and an amazing product, yet Dan and the boys are more worried about Diversity and Inclusion and doing things to win them their 'pat on the back' awards from silicon valley as a progressive company.I'm an ex employee of PYPL. Over 16 years there before I retired. I have slightly over 5,000 shares from option packages and ESPP so it's a nice chunk of change but this gets old watching Dan hold this company back.I'm sure I'll get blasted by the PYPL loyalists, bears, and the SQ cheerleaders. But hopefully there will be a few logical conversations in this thread."
PayPal attached at the hip with Bitcoin!
"PYPL is still Bullish, trending upward."
Just wait until market opens
Rip thru $200 this week
I have good news for all you patient PYPL investors. The stock is about to soar. I only predicted this once before on here a while back and the stock took off. I am predicted $125 by end of year. Enjoy the ride!
"For 5 months now, PYPL hasn’t moved a penny. Square is an absolute giant!"
I missed it completely..
Most likely people taking profits. Look at the higher than normal volume.
"Dang, Bought PYPL at $39 and $49. Wish I had bought more."
will go back to 270 in a couple hours no worries just some sell off
bears sterns cramer is screaming buy buy buy!!!!
These stories are also important and could affect the outlook in a positive manner.https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/07/24/why-an-nba-execsays-the-deal-between-the-phoenix.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
"Looks like the coming months are going to quite rewarding for shareholders. PYPLs interest in crypto currency vaulting and exchange (Bitgo) is HUGE! Now this is the innovative market capitalization I like to see. The immutability of blockchain fits perfectly within PYPL’s vision to create safe, secure and transparent transaction accounting of global/cross-border transactions. These events and the rumored “crush” of estimated earnings lends me to wonder if analyst estimates shouldn't be over $400/pps."
Just shorted PayPUKE up a penny
lol 5 years for paypal to grow and make more and more partnerships. think about that before you sell. five. years.3 months until next earnings. calm down guys
If rising interest rates help banks....and Paypal is a BANK....a High Growth bank at that...why is everyone selling.
Solid among the noises!!! Great stock to buy!!!
Huge beat and raisehttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-tops-earnings-expectations-as-covid-19-drives-big-e-commerce-growth-2020-07-29?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
"(Zack's)Coupa Software Inc. COUP announced collaboration with PayPal PYPL by which Coupa Pay users can access their PayPal account, which in turn will enhance customer experience"
yep. the banks are certainly distributing millions of shares. selling higher that which was bought lower.
Paypal %NGN +2348183741873 high and maintained lead over others. Stabilise more like this for yield to and from currencies market
"Sorry guys my $85 call I made yesterday was a little bit off. Also wrong about propelling some of the other fintech names, I guess they will have to wait for their earnings to come out."

To the moon baby!
paypal needs to pull a FB reverse and go green!
This stock is up from $35.00 for no reason
"I am holding PYPL. Good quarter performance, strong growth and solid cash flow."
What happened after hour?
It will go up fast last 30 min
PYPL is a beast
Gonna explode
"I posted three times already since I got back in PYPL at $84 I first got in at $70. I made HUGE mistake of selling in December when all stocks dropped 5-10%. I got back in and dropped again. THIS TIME I am staying long.PYPL easy money. Stay long you WILL be happy. Next small drop, I will be doubling down."
Short squeeze on PayPal next week. Get ready folks.
We are heading towards breaking the all-time high!
Sell this while you can! Will go to $70-90 when clean up occurs! PE 95 just not possible to continue for ever!
PYPL has had major technical damage yet remains richly valued in an aggressively competitive market. Short at 120. New shorts above 105. Banksters are clearly distributing the shares and it takes awhile to sell without collapsing the price.
Market crash or massive correction? going back to bed either way.
Faang Bubble is still short Paypal.
"Great After Hours, almost at $260.00."
"Wait till these kids get their free checks and 10K relief on college fund, all buying crypto using Paypal CHA CHING"
shiller pe ration at record highs. well above the huge corrections of 1929/1987. waaaayyy more expensive markets here.
"PayPal’s latest acquisitions such as iZettle (Square of Europe) Jetlore (AI preditions systems for Retailers) and PPRO (specialize in cross-boarder payments) set PayPal up for moving into major mobile payment spaces i.e India, and capturing both brick and mortar retail using the same strategy as square while providing a mobile banking platform to the 400 million people in India who don’t have access to banking solutions. The analysts don’t see this forming yet and PayPal loves it because they are making major moves and nobody is covering this. They are digging a moat in complete darkness and therefore the stock doesn’t have this seemingly large growth potential priced in. **I believe** PayPal’s stock could be worth over $200 a share in 18-24 months. That’s my own opinion based on my own personal analysis. Let me know your opinions by commenting below! Thanks!"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-significantly-enhances-global-payout-204500404.html
Oh boy
"Mizuho Securities analyst Don Dolev has forecast that Paypal will earn up to $2 billion in revenue from its bitcoin business by 2023. This year, he expects that the payment giant’s overall revenue will climb 20%."
"Under $183 is an awesome price for Paypal....hold one month, make some decent profit! Once we get past today, a lot of the big money that sat out the election will start to get back into the market."
"okay, let's go paypal...."
BET THE FARM.......... with confidence.
Wouldn’t worry in the slightest. There’s potential this hits the 168-170 level but continue to hold. This will be $250 soon enough!
"thanks paypal, very cool"
$FB $AAPL $PYPL $PINS hope we can hold these levels throughout the week
PYPL is a core holding. Prob the best fintech along with V. I think this is $240 soon.
Jim Bears Sterns Cramer recommends buying the virus!
Stock is relentless in going higher. $150 on the horizon. Just great to be Long in this gem.
"How is Paypal doing today? Yes, there is a lot of competition, but, they own it !"
this company is too damn powerful now everyone has realised the 'potential' data breach was just paypal being extremely honest. unlike mot companies that hide tax evading dislotal secrets. Paypal can't afford to pretend and they clearly don't. In the end the news affected no one using their service and fundamentally they are in no different a position than what they were at 78 a share.Buy and ride this easy 8% back up.or Hold and i'll see you guys at 100 soon.
I hate to say it but I believe SQ will outperform and out pace PYPL.
PayPal reached an all time high at 222.79
if pypl is loosing ebay..who is next...sounds like competition will be accelerating..
Buy time my friends! $$$$
How we gonna get to 105 without buyers? Come on pypl longs...i have shares to sell above 105.
Where are the upgrades? I have more sell orders to fill above 105!
Did you know that eBay is introducing its own payment system? that means goodbye to Paypal as main payment method
I remember the last time it went down under 180.I bought inmediately
I am begging  and pleading  with everyone in here to sell here @ $285.50 short & buy puts. You own a stock that fell from $302 to $281 in a minute on great news ! WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BAD NEWS STRIKES?
"$87 by next Friday. $90 on earnings day. Q4 is always a good time for PYPL. Highest amount of online sales, highest amount of money transferred in Q4."
Had a buy order in at $76. Both happy and sad it didn’t go through.
"In terms of the technology stack, going from monolithic to a micro services based platform has allowed PayPal to go from releasing 8 updates per year to over 17,000 updates per year since 2015!"
Guys remember there is still Cyber Monday next week. Basically this year Black Friday is just a Cyber Friday. Paypal is benefiting from both events.
"""Analyst expects an upbeat preliminary forecast for 2021 when PayPal reports earnings Monday""More affirmation from the 40+ analysts covering PYPL with predominant buy/overweight recommendations. Today, I again heard from a trustworthy source, that PYPL earnings are ""jaw dropping,"" and I take that to mean in a very positive way. PYPL has been capitalizing on the COVID-19 surge towards digital banking platforms and now seeking a major footholds in crypto. If there is one company I would think hedge funds and savvy investors are rolling over in to or doubling down on, it is PYPL. I won't be popping any corks yet, as this market has gone psychotic and who knows short-term. Again, be an investor and not a trader. GLTA next week!"
Why isn't this moving more? Nasdaq is up over 1% Is Paypal at a resistance level?
credit suisse raised paypal target price from $85 to $93
Just bought a few more shares of PYPL.
Monster company Being trading in and out Since $55 should have just kept it Waiting for pull back mi think this could go over $100
pypl closes below the 200 week moving average. oh dear. broken.
"went to several basebal games. saw that concessions used square exclusively. asked if they used papal and venmo. was told no on pypl and ""what is venmo""?"
So does PayPal own Bitcoin? I cannot find any information on it. I really hope they buy some if not.
Very nice. Should sell off a little then move higher going forward
"These are powerful long-term trends that should continue to propel the growth of Square and PayPal for many years to come. Investors, therefore, would likely be best served by holding on to the stocks of these e-commerce leaders."
+8% afterhours. +25% for the rest of the year. $120-$125 target.
Accumulate
Let's guess the close today … obviously higher the better but I can see a $94.72 close
Why did PayPal share price just dip?
"Big boys playing games with PYPL, sell in morning and buy late afternoon."
"Paypal is life, paypal is love"
"Should close today around $185 I'm guessing. Won't be too much longer, and it'll be back up over $200. You'll be glad you got in today under $190. Good luck all!"
buy buy buy PYPL
PYPL will not see the drop in payments that V saw. V has lost virtually all in-person transactions due to shutdowns. PYPL has 0 exposure to shutdowns. all payments are virtual
Ok who is brave?
Moves upwards like molasses and drops like a rock. - Acts like someone higher up has a deduction button
Imagine PayPal getting bought at a premium to help adopt and integrate Libra...
"Today the market just waits for the big cap earnings, COST, ADBE and ORCL. I guess all of them beat the estimate, but I don't know how the market reacts. The index ups a lot this morning and then pull back which is normal because it went up 5 days in a row. But I still think the market still has up-leg today because Yellen said that high valuation stock does not mean overvalue, and the fair value today is way higher than the actual. All I know that ADBE will beat the estimates by a mile. PYPL will be absolutely the winner in Jan."
What’s a good price to buy in at???
been waiting for this chance to buy pypl
"JPM Chase to shutter Chase Pay.“As Chases discontinues its service, it is pushing users toward PayPal. “$PYPL just another notch on the belt of a string of successes. This stock will erupt to the upset, well before quarters end.Short term Buy. Long term Buy and hold, crown jewel of any portfolio.."
"Let""s call Jim Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PayPal"
I don’t see a bubble with fundamentals like this
"This company is amazing and the earning reports excellent, but this quarter trend, they sent all the stocks down no matter how excellent earnings are, we got this trend by MSFT earnings. But I am bullish on this great company."
Gonna regret if u don’t buy soon
"thanks for the the discount, i have been looking to add to my position, especially after that stellar earnings just reported.,"
Paypal is the dominent player in online pay and increasingly at retailers. You do not need to give out any personal data. That is the trend which will not go away. Venno can be spun out at some point. It has 40 million users. PE has gone from 36x to 30x which makes it undervalued.
"PayPal is making acquisitions and partnerships every month, setting up the chessboard for domination in the online payments space. PayPal doesn’t want the spotlight because they want it to be too late for other companies to try and jump on just like amazon did. By the time everyone realized what amazon was to become it was too late for anyone to compete because the moat was too big. This is the biggest reason I love PayPal."
Profit triples. Strongest quarter in history. Next quarter will be huge with those cryptos transactions. Long and hold.
seems like 203 and 204 are the buybacks mark's today. tmrw we will be up again.
Finally some good news with crypto
sudden increase at 3pm. Institutional buying?
These shortsellersare desperate
Go ahead. Sell ur shares. I’ll take em. Gladly.
"Any explanation for this sell off AH? It can't reasonably be attributed to the end of the eBay contract in 2023, can it? That's absurd..."
$309 to $250 in 3 days LOL  PayPUKE 
Bitcoin is 28K up 15%-20% in the last 5 days. I would not be surprised if we hit $250-$260 very soon
Getcha some boys and girls onto the $200 sooner than later.....
I see no one is making fun of my quadruple down short at $177 anymore

How large is the share repurchase program
"V (VISA) is half the valuation of PYPL and has greater revenue growth and a 50% profit margin. Ya sure PYPL is a good place to ""invest""?"
Well PYPL longs. Last month up 4.5% this week around 1%. aka average of 1% per week. Can't go wrong with this stock. Have great weekend everyone.
Sweeeeet! Zipidy Duda Day.....
...and its just up 6%?unbelievable.
Ringing up some sales!
Gap dwindling......... Let's go PayPal!
Class action filing will impact opening on Monday. Will be a good time to buy in on the drop. I suspect overreaction with selling and would be good time to buy up cheap shares.
85 by Friday? More down days ahead.
btc rising people buying and new stimulus checks coming......spend spend spend!!!
fakepal is no volume on an up day once again. distribution continues. watch for alot of volume to come in during the last three minutes as the bankers sell what they bought earlier today.
growth rate is 59% - not good enough for the market. But to me - wow!!Let's hear what they have to say on the call.
Top and bottom beat. Venmo double the volume YOY extends EBay agreement. Terrific numbers.

"JUST LIKE BitGo, Brian Foote, CEO of HUMBL will not go cheaply as $PYPL will only be able to do 15% of what HUMBL can! Hundred points symbol $TSNP BitGo has been ""in talks with everyone"" and will not accept a ""small exit."""
11.5% down on an extremely good top and bottom line beat! Come on......this is aimed at shaking the tree so the big boys can get more cheap shares. All this because of ebay pulling away.........and that in 2023. What percentage of revenue does ebay bring to PYPL? Fact: approx. 13.5% with a decrease of 3-4% YoY. By 2023 ebay's participation to total revs. will be insignificant. This is sheer manipulation to acquire more share. I can't see PYPL share price staying down for long over this recent announcement. JMHO
Good time to add some stocks today
BTW ANTM will hit 270 by Friday.
"So, the march to $250 is finally underway. Only a month late, but the buying opportunities were amazing.$221 resistance level hit. Breakout is only a few % pts away."
Are we done or is this just the start?
"Market up and down every single day, intrinsic value will be leading the spine. Up trend IMHO"
"And with the games with the gme amc and BB. Come on, that will be short lived. Ultimately, people will gravitate back to value, earnings and reality.Or true companies.

The phenomenon with attacking low life short sellers will not end well for both sides.Stay safe, financially and health wise.Cheers!"
This dip made me say bye bye to my average cost of $45 now doubling up the position.
Lets call Mad Moneys Jim Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PYPL. 1 800 743 2622
Everything about the market and economy right now is built for paypal to win every timeThese are ridiculously discounted prices considering this drop is entirely based on market panic surrounding stimulus and the election...An obvious top quality buy.How many online business models have been started to shifted to since Q2 ended?This will breakout following election if not be one of the only breakouts during the election...
Venmo numbers up 80% year over year. Beat on all numbers.
It's going to double digits. Free money days r over now.
double down on another short. this stock has so many competitors
Most absurd forever high? AMZN $1600 NFLX $600 NVDA $615 $TSLA $902 $PYPL $309 CRWD $250???? I say NVDA $615 easily

"Amazing undervalued Fintech: TRITTriterras, Inc., though its subsidiaries, operates as a fintech company. The company operates Kratos, a commodity trading and trade finance platform that connects and enables commodity traders to trade and source capital from lenders directly online. The company is based in Singapore."
"PYPL will hit GRAND SLAM HOME RUN for the next 4 quarters. GDP for the forth quarter is around 3.3-3.5% for the next 2 quarters. If the Fed does not raise the interest rate too fast, the economy will still keep growing steady. This is the vest time for the country. We will see how high PYPL can go. I guess PYPL will move up fast around 76-78 by first week of Jan. then moment of truth is Jan 18"
I've held PYPL for many years (basis $8.53 = +3068%). Also held LNG for about the same time period (basis $0.93 = +6890%). Currently buying TELL for a long-term hold (current basis 1.91 = +86.61% but still adding to position)
"Yes PayPal may be convenient, but WAY to pricey for what you get to use your own money. HUMBL (TSNP) is this correction! Whether investors want to believe at this point of time or not, HUMBL will make its superior services known very quickly and investors will flock to be part of this transfer of wealth. I’m not waiting until HUMBL’s stock price escalates to get in. Just think about it, wouldn’t have been great to get in on the ground floor of PayPal? Maybe you did, but not everyone did, here is your chance to do that with HUMBL (TSNP). The new ticker “HMBL” will be given in January. Just check it out-what an opportunity!!!!!!"
Thank you for the shares I got AH last night - I've been waiting for something like this to get in.
New to this stock. Why down so much today???
Be a leader not a follower PayPal is number one
Please leave this board if you are a square.........
"this stock is based on fundamentals, not on the greater fool theory, that retail investors love to use."
"So PYPL goes down, KTPPF goes up... people moving over?"
Getting worried. Will it hold 230 atleast today.
"bought PYPL in 2016, added in 2018 and again in 2019. Nice to see the returns. I let it ride."
good buying opportunity
Where are all those geniuses from yesterday who said they were shorting this 
"eBay was only 13% of paypal's review, they can make that up no problem. that said Clos is right, not cool ebay ... they probably shorted paypal"
"considering eBay and PayPal already soured in 2015, and PayPal will continue to be a payment option until 2023, why the absolute freakout in PM trading"
Looks good today
PYPL is really something. Options into September here. Let’s go to $250 soon!
Two more pypl insiders selling at 113 and 111.
it's hang'in in there
Be over $100 shortly and once it does it will fly.
"ARK bought 110,181 shares of PYPL today!"
At least say they upped their shareholding and now are trying to pump paypal for their clients. Least try to sell the bs. Come on.
Just noticed major paypal hacked... thousands of accounts linked to banks hacked with big time unautherized account deductions...check your bank statements for paypal linked deductions...many unable to change passwords to stop hackers

"PayPal is dead in the water, so glad I bailed. Figured it'd go up after I sold as that's generally what happens. Nope, down is the direction. glta"
Anyone heard of an app called Revolt in Europe? Sounds like a fast growing banking startup. I am just curious if it bring opportunity or threat to PYPL
What just happened to the market?
"How you feeling Jerry? SQ dropping lower than PYPL today, PYPL > SQ"
this market makes me want to drink
"look at the chart, this is a gold mine in a few years, just stay in, honey is a cash giant"
Lifetime buying opportunity
great quarter. a 4percent dip is nothing compared to my crypto losses this week.
I won't recommend selling Paypal before investors day on 11 February. They will announce big surprises.
Buying opportunity!!!
"I have known Honey deal is a very sweet deal and said it will up-end Amazon's dominance in online retail, but never thought it is Amazon's reaction to this deal justifies the price that PayPal paid for Honey; so interesting."
80+ open...
"Those of you experts that continually post that this stock is going to $100 Please STOP! Every time you post we lose market price. Perhaps if you just sit quietly and WAIT it will hit your ""expert"" prediction. In the meantime, think of the market as a pitcher in baseball throwing a no-hitter. In baseball no one talks about the possible no-hitter during the game. The team does not celebrate until AFTER the no-hitter has been thrown. Look at the $100 price the same and don't start celebrating until AFTER the $100 is reached."

I love you PYPL!!
I'm sure I saw 2.69$up after market @4:02. 2 minutes after it closed
"It's a gift right here. This is a trillion dollar company in ten years. Don't trade it, just own it,."
"Before you comment, again I hold a lot but I look at the full picture. Visa partnership expands PayPal's Instant Transfer service to global markets https://seekingalpha.com/news/3612835?source=ansh $V, $PYPL"
Scooped up more shares. Next stop $210 once Congress passes the stimulus.
credit card and car loan delinquencies at 7 year highs. why? what does this mean for pypl?
Looks like a day to get seasick. Hold on for the delayed election aftershocks.
"$TWLO just got in last week....what else are you bullish on? Added some $PYPL today, looking for stocks to research small cap/growth under $20 any ideas? Love what I found last year $MGNI, which has taken off to the races for 2021 and beyond, in adtech as leading SSP. Worth researching and getting in soon."
Shorts will learn a terrible lesson next week. This is unbelievable volume for a $100B company with corresponding increase in price.
SQ - How do you make only $32M on $1.6B in Rev? 2%? LOL. on pure electronic trx. Sounds like a rev classification issue to me.....
watch this space.......Paypal and Square will be the new FANGS in the next decade....
do you guys think we can hit 90$ by the end of next week?
"bought ETH on pay pal, easy and safe to use, not like the wallets that your money disappears"
April 100 calls are golden
$1000 by the end of the day
"I don’t understand why everyone panics when the stock goes down?? That’s how the market works! Do you expect the stock to just shoot back to $85 a share.. If you’re panicking when the stock drops, just don’t invest in the company because you’re not truly invested in the business model. If you’re just here to day trade paypal you should probably rethink your “day trading” strategy because there are way better stocks to day trade."
Worldpay is green right now
"All my local automotive stores accept paypal, autozone, advance auto parts, none of them accept square! So tired of people trying to compare paypal to square or affirm. They don't compare."
Do 10% drop since Friday comes back...is this a good thing? Made my 10% buying today and selling AH....not sure if it was worth holding?
Anyone else a little surprised PYPL not up/green on this cyber Monday???
Up 10% shall we?
87 open / 3 to 1 buys to sells in ah respectively
"""Paypal Bought 70% of All Newly Mined Bitcoin Last Month as Demand Rockets""source: Bitcoin newsThat should drive the stock price over 200 IMO"
"James Eaton, has set a target price of $220 per sharebased on Vennmo, acquisition."
Long!! Anticipating a nice day
"Beats on Revenue and EPS, raised guidance, and a 10B buyback plan? Yeah, I think I'll hold."
Stock is back in beast mode a la last season’s spectacular returns. This year will be even better. $100 here we come Amigos.
V at 143 looks like a great entry. no buying until the blue lite special is activated.
pypl tops are marked by upgrades and sweet nothings. pypl bottoms are indicated by downgrades. how many downgrades has pypl received lately?
gold mine
bullish 400
We been consolidating in the low to mid 80’s. Lot of pent up pressure to explode after ER. Can easily see this stock going on top of $90 after ER. Shulman has been appearing on interviews during the quiet period. You don’t usually do that unless you got the “nuts” as they say in poker. Stock in for a major breakout. IMHO
The stock is going to be under $250 tomorrow
PYPL is up 4.93% to 106.64
Bought @ 77 missed 75- ****
dropped as market is red.. i can't find a single reason that caused this drop by paypal itself. not gonna sell a single share.
Look at long term chart. Now do you think PYPL is along term hold? rest my case.
All them Wallmart shoppers will add millions in transaction charges!!!
"PayPal's Venmo processed $19 billion of payments in the fourth quarter, an 80% year-over-year increase."
Don’t let the suits win!
Jim Cramer's take on PayPal after speaking with Dan Schulman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbykz-M_qoE
$345 today lol
"Everyone relax. PYPL up 15% in January. It needs a little correction. -3-5% who cares. I bought today and I will be down 3-4%. I am not worried. PYPL will be back to normal in 1-2 weeks. Market not fixed. Yes it went down with GREAT earnings report. Some stocks do that, some don't. All is well LONG TERM"
I am getting frustrated with PYPL!! Anonymous - I just might sell!
Wouldn’t be surprised if it ends green or only 1% or so down.
Investor day starts in an hour lol LETS GO PYPL GOOOO
I'm curious; What are the down sides to PYPL incorporating bit coin?Are they exposed to value fluctuations or is that risk on the consumer?PYPL has performed so amazingly since the split from eBay. EBAY has barely budged while PYPL has quadrupled.
Firework by the time of earnings. I guess it is about 82-85.
Happy to say that I’m a paypal shareholder now
"Great stock and a good hole in the long run. I believe they will consolidate a bit before going higher, probably 3-5 days given its history. Their current RSI is at 70 while volume went down after earnings. Current candle is well above the 20 EMA so I assume it will retrace a bit back after continuing to go up"
Sold at 80. Whatever thanks.
"PayPal just mentioned, on the halftime report, as a stock to buy-on the way up!"

I'm going on record right now. My prediction... this coming quarterly report EPS 71 cents a share beating consensus by 4 cents. Others predictions?
"Should see $275 on open tomorrow, what a call!!"
Well done Big 
I’ve been an eBay member since 2004. Sold over 3500 items. I will never sign up with another company besides PayPal. I’d rather take money orders and cashiers checks.
PYPL high today 243.42. Nice!
yeah baby!
Up today over $10 USD per share in German trading (Berlin).
Well bad news is I got in at 259.Good news is I haven't added yet.I don't see support till 229 ish.But am tempted
PayPal is the AOL of payment. Their business model is obsolete and they now have plenty of competition. Market Sentiment: STRONG SELL 
Dan on the earnings call said that eBay have zero growth in payment volume and declining numbers that hurt revenue projections for the year. Leaving eBay is the best thing to happen to PayPal. eBay is going down hill fast.
CNBC and Reuter reported that PayPal beat estimates & 90% higher than last year.
Not even down 10% since Wednesday
@Big don't forget to load the truck up!I sure am! $$$$$$$
wake up paypal you are better than this
oh green? did not expect this at all
this market is a traders paradise and an investor's nightmare
"Now that most of the weak handed traders and Robinhood investors are shaken out, let's go back to work."
why did I sell this around $85 for a 10% gain?? big mistake.
the sky is the limit!
"Almost 20% off all time highs, sad."
"ahhh...Boom, Boom Pmt Processors..."
NICE
"20k to invest, got 80k invested in paypal,sq,amzn,appl,rolls royce, norwegian cruises. whats hot in 2021 ??"
"Oh it's going higher this is a long stock, steady she goes ."
I sold large portion when they announced they will leave Ebay @$around $80. I just start buy back some in the last couple days. If I am right I think PYPL will be future bank. I am betting on it. wish me luck.
Kevin bro you really shorted at 179. That’s rough.
this is a huge opportunity for paypal:https://seekingalpha.com/news/3389596-paypal-fills-void-sports-betting-payment-processing?dr=1#email_link
Berenberg now rating PayPal a buy.
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3630037-paypal-sees-earnings-growth-slowing-in-q4-stock-falls-5_1
"Throwing out the baby with the bath water?I understand rising interest rates hurt growth stocks, that are starting out or expanding without the earnings that they will hope to earn on their nascent revenue which is growing. Since they need to borrow money to help fulfill that growth. Hence the sensitivity to any little tick up in interest rates.But companies like $PYPL and $AMZN for example can fund growth themselves as they huge earnings. Seriously look at the earnings of these behemoths and the projected earnings. These companies are cash cows. And $FDX FedEx earnings and more importantly guidance says it all about online commerce moving forward.These three companies and others in such an enviable position will outperform the market vastly.Ignore the background noise, look at the numbers, the verbal and written statements and projections made by these companies."
Imagine how many commissions Paypal has made is these few days from crypto..... Which is good for Paypal
BFT is next PYPL. cnbc said it could triple from today closing price
I could see this getting up to around $195 if it beats on earnings later today which I believe it will!
"PayPal has beaten earnings every quarter it's been a public company, expect nothing less this week"
How do you like me now!
Heavy resistance @ $ 300.00!
"Bitcoin surges to over $23,000. PYPL gonna roar again today!"
Dorsey invested in Adyen in 2015
Any rumors for AAPL and PYPL?Hold PYPL for long good news coming soon!
I bought more PYPL in AH.
Looks like PayPal is pretty much following nasdaq's trend since March 2020. It's YTD trend almost matches the Nasdaq's performance to the T. I'm confident Nasdaq index will continue to double and triple in the next 3-5 years and so will PayPal and other fintechs
gee...why do ya spose bank analysts are so interested in you buying pypl shares?
What’s with the alleged PAYPAL being bought and or acquired by Buffet ...?Or but in rumor - call options anyone ?
"WEEEE NEEEEDDDD STIMULUS VISA GO TO THE MOOOOONNNNN BUY AMAZON, PAYPAL, VISA IF YOU BELIEVE STIMULUS WILL PASS $amzn $pypl $v"
"It is way OVERBOUGHT, but who will want to take profit, when MSFT and GOOG are still waiting in the wing. It is really tough decision. I am the one who just bought more PYPL call 78, 79, 80, bet on earnings only, and WILL NOT LET GO ANY OF THE OPTIONS I BOUGHT YESTERDAY until Jan 26."
Earnings report coming after market today right?
"Wow, increasing buyback to $10 billion."
"Just a word of caution. Just because they beat earnings, doesn’t mean the stock is going to $200 no matter how much we would all love that. The stock is on a tear and in order to keep it at that pace there has to be really great news not just good news."
BIG LOADING TIME FROM HEDGE FUNDS....
Great report and future guidance!
slowly coming back
Is there any float between when paypal collects cash and pays out? If so rising interest are good for them.
Repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock...because financial shenagans are required to keep the stock price up.
Whats happening after hours? Its down %1
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-named-a-top-pick-at-barclays-2018-11-14
"I don't get it. What triggered this: ""...And the momentum has carried over to May thus far, as PayPal had its largest single day of transactions on May 1, topping previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday records. "" Because people are getting $1200 from FED ?"
PayPal reached an all time high at 177.98
So why the big drop.
I got in PYPL when it was down -2% for no reason right after the earning report at $70. Idk why but PYPl usually drop it like this and has moved up slowly on the north.
cool I'll buy more love buying days
my only red stock. even draftkings is green
"All aboard !! EPS announcement tomorrow after market closes. This baby is a solid pick for $125 and the acquisitions will be acretive and the internet is still growing in net revenue much faster than bricks and mortar and Pay Pal is in the best position to enjoy the lion's share of gain to their base sales. One of the best business finance models in practice today.Thus we have a high value with assurance of consistent performance because the moving parts are few compared to banking or insurance. Love it,"
"Hey Big are you related to Jack, Amy, Andy or Tony?"
"If PYPL ever works out a deal with Amazon, the stock goes to $100.Go PYPL"
I would short AAPL PYPL TWTR AMZN GOOG
Bonds have rocketed again ffs  this dip is not representative of company value $CBAT $PLUG $NNDM $PYPL $NIO
PYPL will never make it to 100.........because it will jump from 74 to 112.
"At the end the earnings number next month will speak for itself. I don't worry about any BS your guys concern about the data breach. As long as earnings come out over 63 cents, and revenue is up over 40%, I am happy. All I know that EPS 2018 will be at least $3.25. Let me tell you that P-P loan is a big business that Swift moves in real fast, the interest rate they charge is over 30% per year,that is the reason why SQ wants to get the bank permit. PYPL has over 15 mil merchant accounts and PYPL users over 200 mil. that is the gold mine, which SQ sees it too. The most important thing that Dan wants is monetizing VENMO, but he just moves slowly to make sure that we want to VENMO every thing. When everybody VENMOs, it is done, which I think it will take another year or two, which i can wait."
Going Up!slowly but surely!
"Anyone stuck long: Sell PYPL Pre market here at $177, quadruple the amount of shares you own BUT go short, on margin, $177......trust me, you will make it all back. Please save this post"
Short term profit takers are out today. Nothing has changed since it's earning growth of 33% yesterday.
do you guys think this is the bottom? sold paypal at 270 on Monday and bought back in and keeps free falling.
boilerplate caution in the guidance everybody chill
Down strong on heavy volume today. Monday is a half day so the downtrend may lessen some Monday but this has just begun it's fall.
Paypal and ebay are sibling companies. Paypal was and is a pioneer in epayments. I believe that it is a matter of taxation. Almost everybody uses paypal so it is difficult for paypal to hide earnings. Thats why they want to boost a new company
PayPal has accepted Bitcoin since 2014.
Go PYPL!
PYPL buys payment system for $2.2 Billion.
This is beautiful! Let's get this pass $100 before 3rd quarter!
FRANK THE TANK
"Awesome day longs, this is how great management works, time to buy major league baseball or football team now...lol"
"Any thoughts on a Christmas special dividend, $1 to $2 dollars"
Resistance has been broken! New 52 week highs coming.
Never sell a single share!
can PayPal compete with Google? prob not
"With Bitcoin prices soaring, and people buying left and right, PYPL stock will continue to fly. Not to mention record number of online transactions! This could easily be another $10 day in the green for PYPL."
"so like to see these dips to show everyone how we get higher lows every week. (said lower lows earlier, oops)"
my puts got paid...
Wow! This thing is going to make up all the ground it lost in no time!
Holding long! $PYPL $MA $FINX $V. LETS GO!!!
Why is square catching you PayPal?
Same thing happened to AMD following positive report then up today..........
Pick up some cheap shares hopefully in the next few days at around 95-98.
"Anyone else think this AmazonPay story is nonsnese at best and at worst a plant story to short attack V, MA, SQ, and PYPL? This has about 1% impact on PYPL if even that. Only the smallest of retailers will be held hostage to AMZN. What retailer WANTS to give their sales merchandise and price data to AMZN? :-/"
anyone listen to me and sell PYPL and buy Square
"PYPL is a tough own. Some say it has nowhere to go up, but same people have been saying that about eBay before the split for the last half decade. This stock honestly has no growth. No future. It's stuck where it is by incompetence of the current management coupled with a history of not understanding their primary customer base. From my experience, it's a really bad company. In my business I deal with multiple financial institutions and Paypal has always been the most difficult to deal with due to inept customer service."
Sold today. Locked in a small gain. I wanted to lock in my gain above 90.

Does anyone else go mute.. mute.. mute.. before you get to the real comments? These boards can be very messy and annoying IMO. Exciting break out here. The stage is being set for a great 2021. Go PYPL!
This will bounce back quickly. Good fundamentals. Focus on underserved. Safe payments. Great leadership. Strong cash balance sheet. The long term story should be a great one to tell in 2021.
I’m not sure what will happen if any news of Amazon Pay comes.
"Like I've been saying on this messageboard for 6-7 months now. Don't Bet the Farm on PayPal. Rather.... Bet the Farm on PayPal, W/Confidence. It was a no brainer. $80, here we come gang."
"Good money flow, strength, volume, with a solid uptrend. Bullish on this one for the week"
Congratulations to SQ and their CEO! She clearly communicates her vision and customer relations.
is it awesome?
Congrats to all the longs! anyone doubting this a 100 stock one day?
"Two notes this morning:PayPal reinitiated with an Outperform with $297 price target at BernsteinPayPal price target raised to $297 from $229 at Morgan Stanley, overweight"
The big institutions are selling. Then the small guys will sell. Then the institutions will buy back the small guys shares cheaper. This is an awesome company. The strong will hold and prevail.
PYPL will $ 272.00 by today's close!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"Also the crypto trades are looking good forecast value to PayPal, At the moment it is only for US customers(So think when they expand the service to the rest of the world -Even more value). https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypals-cryptocurrency-partner-sees-500-085111345.html"
PayPUKE  is headed back to $126
Stock is heavily undervalued
I sold some of my PayPal and put to sq today. I think more room for growth in both companies. But I feel PayPal business is too far stretch and very not stable. Sq is all interconnected... hope I am right
just hit 90 please.
Check up the email and vote it
Sorry guys I bought @$188 so it had to go down
Bought back in at 79.85. The force is strong here.
Anyone remember when they announced some sort of cryptocurrency trading @ $215? Bwaaaaaaaa
wowza.. this stock is double the mkt cap of wfc... hmm fair value here?
This was up to 208 pre-market. What kind of shenanigans was that? I portfolio would be looking pretty sweet right now if it wasn't for paypal. Even my bank stocks are way up!
PYPL may be waking up?!?!
THE SHORT SHOULD COVER BEFORE IT HIT THE CEILING TODAY AT $250.00
"A couple of months ago I mentioned that it was only a matter of time before PayPal launches in Pakistan. It is an ideal base for PayPal to reach the next 200 million customers, especially considering the heavy role of remittances in that country. And now the following news came out: https://marketrealist.com/2018/10/is-paypal-set-to-launch-in-pakistan?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo"
Beat
"""Shifting shopping trends have made PayPal's sweet spot the new normal. That's great news for shareholders. Adobe Analytics is predicting that instead of Cyber Week this year, November and December are going to be Cyber Months. It's forecasting $189 billion in holiday e-commerce sales, a 33% increase over the prior year. Even when the pandemic comes to an end, digital shopping is not going anywhere. PayPal has also done a great job of getting into new businesses. It has acquired various companies to keep it growing in new directions, such as Venmo's popular peer-to-peer payment app and Honey, a price comparison feature. PayPal stock is up 95% year to date. Between its original business and innovative approach to payments, and it should continue to rise in the future."""
I told my daughter about the honey issue. spoke to her about venmo dangers. she laughed at me and said it works for her and all her friends are still using it.
I think its ironic that the analyst cant do their jobs and the stock goes down
PayPal will make new highs. No doubt!
This is a buy on dips and hold stock. Today is a great time to buy more shares.
5.... 10 years from now Pypl will be 250-350 BILLION market cap. Currency will always be around. Always has. Always will. The way people buy and purchase things may change in future. But not anytime soon. Pypl strong buy.
Looks like another bloodbath today... sentiment/momentum are bleak right now!
"Morgan Stanley sets PYPL price target to $88 and Credit Suisse sets to $91, says ebay split has little impact on PYPL."
"LOL Win, Loss, Win, Loss, this is just a few of the stocks I have watched that beat and yet got beat up. Guess tide is turning and puts are the way to go now. Or maybe this turns around after conference call and changes things up. Just my opinion, good luck all."
"what a great ceo, no place id rather put my money"
anyone think this may actually drop after earnings?
What a stock!!
In long term paypal will raise. in just 2 years its price doubled. Just be patient.
Consumer habits have shifted to digital and its here to stay. Rumors of crypto sales on the PyPl platform. Good leadership laser focused on results. Earnings is going to be a smash. Prepare for lift off in 3.. 2.. 1..
Very bullish on PYPL. Own as cheap as $42 a share when it split off from ebay. My most recent buy was on the Coronavirus dip at $90 a share. Sitting pretty at both buys and this company is the future of business transactions along with Square.
$CLPS There is a rumor that $clps will be merged $pypl to advance into China.
"Not sure why people are complaining, 8 cent eps beat is a great report on an undervalued stock..."
"Not near a PC or cellular device, can’t get quotes, saw PYPL around $189 earlier today, is it $200 yet????"
$sq will print $150 before $pypl just like I said sq will print $100 before pypl. Square open for business in the am
"Paypal is getting ready to crash they did lose Ebay . CEO pumped the stock he called it ""the end of cash "" . Soon he will be investigated for pumping the stock then dumping it . A classic pyramid scheme ."
Kathie Wood has been loading up PYPL nonstop on her ETF funds.Looking forward to seeing PYPL trading above $300 once again.
YTD up $1/share!
Total payment volume up 39% Non-GAAP EPS expected to grow 17%Revenue expected to grow 19%
I could ask the PYPL shorts to stop giving me their money but I know they won’t lol.
"Don't worry, this is just accumulation day before the run and blowout report."
Why is PYPL struggling to get up there. When SQ is almost to green positive?
PayPal reached an all time high at 201.40
added more at 74 dip. favorite stock ever
There is a rumour that Berkshire Hathaway is accumulating Paypal stocks. Berkshire Hathaway will reveal its current portfolio tomorrow and if they have bought Paypal then we can expect more surging.
How long until $pypl overtakes $v market cap? Fintech heavyweights.
I guess they didn't miss ebay after all
U guys are completely clueless.All the bigBanks bny even ma getting into crypto will squeeze any advantage out of sq and the stock will collapse.Same as si. And pypl. All xtreme sales here $si $sq $ma $pypl
Stock loves making new highs. Onwards to $125
the loss of EBAy exclusivity could mean the end of Paypal
"Big hedge funds are moving in before new year. I think we will see PYPL 77-78 by end of the month. It looks like last quarter exactly, but this time around, PYPL has more cash, less debt reserve and big MOJO. if VENMO is credit card, logo VENMO, PYPL will shoot to 100 very easy."
Not sure who is selling here and why. This has has a $125 price target by an activist investor.
ATH
Another bloodbath on the whole broader market.... though the really consoling point is Paypal lost the least percentage wise today of any of the 15 on my watch list :-) As soon as the market turns around Paypal's great fundamentals will have its shares recovering at the forefront : big time !
Does anyone think EBay is a snake for making this announcement on the eve of PayPal earning release ???
Omg sq is very close by
"Multi-talented hotshot CEO Jack Dorsey might be hot. Looks like Dan Schulman is an equally formidable opponent, I'm no longer concerned SQ might eat up PYPL one day, but it did look that way at one point in 2017-2018 when SQ was hot hot and hot."
Seems to be following the DOW. Expect this to continue unless new or unexpected news comes out.
I'm buying more tomorrow if the price drops!! Just more opportunity! $$$
"if bitcoin bounce right back today to new highs from the selloff the other day, PYPL gonna gap right back up to that buypoint at $216...its tried to breakout so many times I cant count anymore, and $218 breaks but then it goes right back down , really need to see it clear $219 it seems.....it wants to run but markets didnt let it today.....did sell my calls for Jan since time was running out and had a massive gain, glad I did since i sold them this morning as soon as $218 brokedown"
Can someone explain as to why this stock has been so stagnant lately?
"PAYPAL 2Q PAYMENT VOLUME $221.73B, EST. $208.56B*PAYPAL 2Q NET REV. $5.26B, EST. $5B*PAYPAL 2Q ADJ EPS $1.07, EST. 87COkay result"
"I am hoping that I get an opportunity to buy more PYPL near 100 now.I was planning to add at 115, but didn't, so that's good..."
Why is it that PYPL most o the time is in red (pre-market) &&SQ is in the green (pre-market).Shouldn't PYPL be higher because of earnings around the corner & 3 Positive buy/outperforming ratings. Don't understand why we are almost neck& neck with SQ.
"There is a $clps conference on Friday. If $pypl is correct, at least $300+++"
"Wow ! Over 500,000 shares filled up the cheap gap from $184.72 to $186.49 so far....it's huge opportunities to buy low before it leave the train, moving forward to big ...big holidays shopping online this month of Thanksgiving and the rest of this year holidays....for huge return when more and more people shop online for this full holidays season which just begins....."
All time high going into the earnings call...this should be interesting. Like I told them before the shorts should just Venmo me now!!!
"Hedges trying to get every last dime you have, manipulate to think maybe the bottom has hit (green) then back negative so people sell"
SQ is up on the news of bitcoin which allows to buy and sell options on the phone. Hmmm. Interesting.
"if market goes up tomorrow,we may see 10 point rise"
New PT $339
"with paypal getting into acorns, this could go well if they buy them. basically free money. still waiting on some bitcoin news from PayPal. they need to jump on the bandwagon and push this stock even higher"
Was able to get 100 more shares with a 227 handle
PayPal has surpassed Visa Card for the 1st time ! Visa has gone nowhere in the past 12 months .. we closed the $70 gap over that period. Now we take on Mastercard! The PayPal Juggernaut is unstoppable !
Buenos días PYPLers. Was a lovely weekend here in south Florida and ready for a great week for PYPL. Buena suerte to one and all :))
Let's get to 80 today. 85 next week. 90 the week after. ER 100!
FOMO
AND WE ARE green skrrrr
Lol. Yer the one and only
watch out paypal mogo is on the move
No way on earth this should be down.
$309 really? R.I.P.  forever All good  things just come to an end. This is   
Discover Card offers %5 cash back if you link it to pay pal.
"Love PayPal, their customer service ain’t that good however"
This is all due to selling off of overall tech sector because of fears of rising 10 yr treasury yield. Hard to know when this will end.
It's so weird seeing stock drop after a good earnings report. makes you wonder about how rigged the system is. I'll just buy more tomorrow. I see this hitting $300 in no time.
Visa up 8 times since IPO...No reason this can't do the same.
Strong support at $105
This will be $500 by the end of the year.
I think it found new support at $116. The chart continues from here like normal I think. $2 dollars more to gain to be back around yesterday's close.
Holding strong to my $177 quadruple down short! Anyone like $220+ yesterday? ROTFLMFAO
"I have to admit. I had PYPL for a long time now.... but its competitors are doing a lot better. Check SQ, VISA, MA. All did PYPL. Unless PYPL makes a move within next 3-6 months, I will probably have to look elsewhere. We are almost same place we were over 6 months ago. Not a good sign. Same time, SQ, VISA, and MA all moved up fast."
"Guys, do you think its a good investment for the next 2 yrs?"
Auto Loan Delinquencies Reach All Time Highs and an emergency rate cut tomorrow. because the economy is in such great shape.
"Strong buy, I bought in at $176 as confidence in this"
ZOOM OUT and chill
good earnings report expected and high growth potential over the next year #positive
When is PayPal earnings being announced ?
Rate cutes from 2.25% will do nothing to stop the ongoing economic collapse.
"It seems that PYPL sells off after earnings every time. It runs up to earnings, sells off, then recovers. In a month you will regret having sold."
It will be 4+ today.
"$Grow and $teum holding up. Next week we see them take off, big time. Stay tune"
ATH for $PYPL $MA $V what a lovely end of the week
PayPUKE  lost 20% of its entire market cap in one week lol
Finish 300+
"so much winning, i cant take it"
"PYPL will not move a lot for the next 2 weeks. It will be active after Christmas. The best one in town should be BABA. Monday a lot of big blocks came in. Over 300,000 shares premarket , 2 points higher, today is even bigger. over 12 million shares keep pushing BABA. I THINK SOME ONE JUST ALL IN."
211...221...246... Happy New Year
haters gonna hate
596 shares averaging now at around 102.Big where's the silver at?? 
$SQ $PYPL merger just rumored on CNBC by Cramer? Maybe some truth to that....thoughts?
"new support was created at 76, very strong support. now it's climbing back up, let's get to 77 before eod"
PYPL killed it in their earnings and it goes down 11% in the after hours? makes zero sense. It's going to be an excellent chance to load up on more shares though!!
the only one green!
just bought another 300 shares have 2050
"if you guys researched any, this tech sell off is due to hedge funds shifting money to non tech's. either way I'm holding because tech is the future, and we are heading to the future marty!"
Some movement! Finally...
Man WTH is up with this stock? Tremendous earnings and forcast yet dropping like a stone for days.....
"Most of the big cap stocks already extend PE, but PYPL should go even higher. Schulman's interviewed at DAVOS "" MASSIVE MOBILE PAYMENT IS ABOUT 50% OF E-COMMERCE, PYPL OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS FROM THE TAILWIND"" I figure it out that PYPL will beat the #$%$ of the estimate big time."
CEO on CNBC. Highest Mobil payments ever this past holiday season. Starting to monetize Venmo. Get ready for a earnings blowout.
What happened to the dude who told CNBC Cramer to short $pypl and long $ebay two years ago?
"Venmo is great for buying and selling weed as well. Fantasy football , poker etc... Everyone uses it!"
Not sure if anyone’s posted this already but Dan Loeb believes PayPal has the ability to hit $225 in 18 months!! That is the bullish talk I like to hear from big investors!
Paypal and Venmo Rock.
BUY THE DIP
Waiting on some big numbers when earnings get released. Very exciting time for PayPal......and what's going to happen with Venmo?
Where can we watch PYPL announce at? Thanks.
"Ladies and gentlemen,Today's Wall Street Journal discusses Fidelity National Information Services aquisition of Worldpay. What is very telling and a very potential windfall for PayPal is the fact that ""FIS is paying a handsome 23 times Worldpay's adjusted 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization."" Worldpay's enterprise value is roughly $43 billion. Why is this significant for PayPal? Paypal's enterprise value is a little over $111 BILLION. Worldpay's current stock price today has been trading between $106.31 - $107.41."
"Guys I hate to say this but now that there is a vaccine, sell PYPL and invest in coin purse makers. The doubloon will become the dominant payment method in the new world."
ETHE up 20% today. GBTC up so much lately. PYPL is so undervalued!!PYPL needs to catch up with them. It should be trading @ $300+
We should be good to $300.00 short term.
boom tomorrow. go PayPal go
yippee ki-yay !!

PYPL LONG TERM $$$$$$$$$
Upgraded today by Zacks investment from hold to buy.
"up 700% since I bought in 5 years ago. still Bullish, i wont sell."
Added to PYPL at $116.50
If you people think ads will be significantly impacted due to the virus the same argument should be made for 5G stocks but we are not seeing that. The economy is fine because the shutdown was a control event and you people shorting the market thinking you are a genius should and deserves to lose all your money. $goog $fb $msft $isrg $t $pypl
"There were a lot of ""investors"" betting PYPL would dump. The dumps on the betters now. Holding steady."
This stock is a beast. Pandemic or not this will continue success. Digital payments is the present and future of commerce. IMO this is a great stock to hold for 10+ years. It will be the next Visa/Mastercard except better.
i don't ger it.. report is pretty good yet down almost 4 AH...Guess wait to see tomorrow what really happens....I guess im missing something ...
"In at 70, I'm long till 2030"
LONg term..... is bitcoin the end of pay pal?
Long way from a good buy. Aint no value stock here.
"paypal to discount rides using the uber app, I am sure they will increase customer acquisition on top of their growth opportunities.This will make customers download the app and remember PayPal through these tough times and make them download there app and increase customer interaction with there application.To LOCK their customers."
How about paying your long time shareholders a dividend instead of spending $400 million acquiring a company that 95% of people have never heard of before?
Oh todays looking gooooood
Stock will fly after ER. All time high less than 2 hours away
"I have a 300 call for September, shall I sell tomorrow or keep it for the earnings. As if it does not go up post earnings my call will completely come down. Suggestions pls"
Where are all those analysis that endlessly pumped PYPL now! They know nothing.
All time high today?
I did it!!
I can honestly say PayPal is doing really good in this market much better than SQ
PayPal is down 5.76% to 225.30
I'm sure this will do good on the ER but the chart shows a pattern that shows it's going down for the next 2 weeks or so. Patterns do change so you never know. I'll wait till the week of the ER go in.
PayPal to the moon todayBitcoin is up today 4.93%
It's about time that we should start getting some $110+ price targets
Goldman Sachs three best tech stocks for 2018 PYPL AMZN and Google. With FB and Netflix also been recommended. Yea baby!

"Good day for PYPL & it's holders, taking out its ATH! Let's keep the momentum going with a nice beat & strong ER report!"
I have no regret buying Paypal even this huge dropping. Very disappointed but it doesn’t make me sell the stock I want to hold for the long haul. Sorry for your losses and myself but we know that it will be turnaround very nicely in near future with a good news.
"Buying the dip, will finish in the green today...Cohen’s departure is a non-story."
Paypal was brilliant getting ability to buy sell crypto with ease and will generate huge cash
Don’t know how I did it. Threw in a low pitch and squeaked in before close today. Now I’m up 2 dollars per share already and I believe it’s up from here on out 
For how long this PayPal stock will sustain near 100 P/E ratio. The company needs to improve the profits at least 300% in 1-2 years to sustain at this price or the correction can come any time in next results.

"Shook out loose hand this AM, heading to $320"
Paypal raised 5 billion to help fund the new acquisition I to China.The % rate on the notes are lower than most peoples mortgage rates!Cheap credit to fund a bullish expansion into the world's second biggest economy.No wonder Mao is upset with his shorting shenanigans 
"32 say Buy, 9 say Hold and only one Sell. Guidance only off 1% from expectations, yet delivering 14% growth. This is way oversold. I’m adding."

“Venmo had a breakout third quarter with payment volume surging 78 percent to a total $17 billion.”
Deutsche Bank just maintained their BUY ratingStifel raised PYPL to $70Susquehanna raised PYPL to $67 Monness Crespi & Hardt raised PYPL to $70Pacific Crest ugradedBernstein upgradedAnd don't forget PayPal has a $5 Billion buyback plan.So don't believe all the BS noise and Fake News! especially from SunTrust.
Give me thumbs UP if you think PYPL closing >= $100 today or DN if not.
"PayPal Website says this: ""PayPal Holdings, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss these results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time) today.""As of this post, it's 4:33PM EST....So, how on earth is the stock down 6 dollars evening before the announcement ?????"
Up again today whoohooo!! Show me some $90+
Curious your thoughts if paypal should / could buyout square?
Great buying opp!
Yahoo keeps posting on top of the news an article from IBD that says this stock is not a buy right now ... not sure why they do this almost daily lately ... this will 
I love paypal
PayPal Traders Bet Stock Will Jump 7% in One Monthhttps://www.investopedia.com/news/paypal-traders-bet-stock-will-jump-7-one-month/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo
This will go till 110 and then market will pull it back to 85 range by Julyish.
Staying long with PYPL is always a 100% sure thing. Glad I added more shares in the last few months!
In for the long term $$$$$
The entire gain from the crypto news erased in 1 minute
PYPL just needs some positive news to get going again. If nothing happens there won’t be movement until next earnings.
"Google earlier this year rebranded all of its payment services under Google Pay to help it double down on making transactions across its platform more frictionless (and more used). Now comes another development: PayPal and Google are kicking off a deep integration, where users who add their PayPal details to their Google Play accounts will be able to pay bills and for other items, using PayPal, without logging in and without leaving the Google services.The integration, when it goes live later this year, will cover apps like Gmail, YouTube, Google Store and any services using Google Pay -- and it will include not just payments but also peer-to-peer transfers."

I told you guy $106.30 by tomorrow
$1T company in 5yrs!!! I’m calling it now!!! Growth will be off the charts!!!
I’ll be loading up on PayPal at $170. Keep selling I’ll buy your shares
These days are gifts for whatever you want to buy.
Google pay is a gnat on PayPal’s plate. One swat and it’s gone.
golden cross forming up nicely around Q4 earnings
What do you guys think this stock is going to be when earnings release?
Went against my discipline and got burnt.I sell before earnings but for some stupid reason I let the dice roll.
Huge buying opportunity with a great earning company!!!
Lmao why so much negative spam in this chat
Dare I say .... Explosion! Lol. Where’s the fella that always talks about that. Time to TAKE A BOW son.
Thanks PYPL for chance to buy below 90.
Got in at 194. 3000 shares
I'm up 40% on PYPL. Earnings should knock it out of the park!!!!
"This one doesn't bother me, even below $200 as it has typhoon-like tailwinds behind it.It's V that is worries me, seems to be stuck in quagmire."
10% downgrade to 275-280This is more healthy for long term.
"The trend is your friend, it’s pretty clear the trend is pointing lower. Why stay in this for the next quarter?"
"if we make it to $200 by end year, i'm naming my first child ""venmo""."
No Brainer here. Ebay is Paypal's core customer and Ebay is now providing it's own checkout solutions. This stock is toast. .
Highs earningsThis stock will reach the moon tomorrowBuy Buy Buy
This is going to take some time. Trend is down for now.
"Komol... why don’t u take a lovely December vacation to Syria, yfpos."
"Amazon beat earnings, and up only less than 1%....do the math, Pypl will follow same path...up maybe 1%...buy on pullback profit taking tomorrow.."
Scooped up 200 more shares on the cheap at 192.50. In 10yrs this will be a $1T+ company 
Lets hope this thing doesnt keep falling
"For those who say the charts need a break let me explain something, right now during this pandemic there are VERY FEW COMPANIES that are GROWING, not only giving guidance BUT RAISING GUIDANCE. PayPal has had a big run but it’s not over. They RAISED GUIDANCE. That means BUY ANY MINOR PULLBACK"
Coinbase will start trading on the open marking sometime within the next month according to most reports. IMO I'd expect this to stir up further interest and discussion surrounding crypto. The sales so far on the secondary market for Coinbase could possibly value it at nearly 100B when it hits the open market. I'm sure there will be plenty of chatter.
New 52 week high. Well done PYPL!
Called it!!! Time to load up....
Investors day musta tanked
i wish i had funds available. This pullback is a gift.
Huge Dutch pensionfund bought PayPal and Activision blizzard!
still moving in the right direction
Wow. My 145 puts I picked up at $2.05 a contract more than doubled into the close! Down big AH tomorrow should be a great day!
Add more at $115
"Cannot believe how PYPL is selling off. This stock will thrive in any scenario other than a market crash. Due to Moderna and Pfizer, people will now, suddenly stop using PYPL? No, they will continue to use PYPL for decades to come. Do not be fooled into a sell-off that does not seem logical."
new ath fam! (the only broken record i like to spin)
Trust it.. it will take care of you.
Do you think we will see $300 again today?
PayPal going cryto! $300 soon!!
PayPal needs to buy Square NOW for at least $50 per share or soon Square will grow so big so fast it will end up buying PayPal instead.
Ahhh... sell the news! Love. Business will double by 2025. BUY! Long term hold.
simple with pfe announcing 3rd quarter positive trials ...focus shifted to pharmaceutical today.
"I have no doubt in PayPal. I’m looking for an entry point. Right now the market is hot as fire and my only hesitation with buying shares of this is the current PE which is probably a little high despite their growth. However, I know this is going to push 200 and pass 200 very soon"
Big bid orders little to no Asks....smart money holding the shares!
"doubled my position at 175, you gamblers betting against stocks are nuts. Stay away from tall buildings with windows that open."
"All good news for PayPal and the stock drops, the deep state of the stock market at work again...."
$174 - $175 seems to be the bottom. Showing strong support here. Will likely begin to rebound now. Great price point to buy in and hold back up to $200 plus. Good luck all!
The big boys shorting before earning are trying to push the price down so they can close their short positions without loss or less loss but at the current level they are running the risk being squeezed by other even bigger boys...
$309 to $285 and dropping like a prom dress 
All is good...good Call so far..Business is booming.. wait for some strong upgrades !!!
How's the investor day? are we shooting $310+ today?
"PYPL has had a great run up lately. Looks like a normal profit taking correction, imo. Financials, growth, and future still very strong. I personally consider corrections like this as opportunities to add to my long position."
Fintech giant PayPal confirmed on Thursday it's reached a deal to buy payments start-up iZettle for $2.2 billion — the biggest acquisition in its history.
If it's everything great why it's going down?
"It is raining free money. rate cuts will happen this year. buy, buy, buy."
"IBD = Investors Business Daily just commented that Paypal was in a bullish chart pattern a ""Cup and Handle"" could be on the verge of a good move up!! Also, Paypla's mobile payment business is growing gang busters.In the future you will see lines at the check-out down to a by 70% as folks will be using phones to pay and go. And Paypal will be the leader there."
"For the uninformed, crushed it!!!!!!!"
what is the benefit of using paypal to buy things as opposed to just using a credit card?

Good sign today that the stock has only decreased a little bit. Nasdaq is down almost half a point and were close to break even. Lets hope the market is decent tomorrow and we can see some slow and steady gains :)
Love how everyone slept on the stock when earnings were released. You literally had an excellent opportunity to buy the stock cheap because this sucker is climbing above it's record high and even higher! Can't wait ! Venmo is driving this baby
"The fin techs are all being manipulated, Visa and Paypal more then masterCard and Square"
"Cramer said Paypal is a buy but to wait until the dust settles before buying...? Really, that is one way to be left in the dust and miss a major surge forward. PYPL was long overdue a bounce before the AMAZING BEAT EARNINGS announcement. I don’t regret my long position in PYPL the least and look forward to pre/post holiday gains. I can pick a hundred other stocks I would take short positions in, but certainly not PYPL. Bring on the analyst buy reiterations and upgrades; guaranteed they are in the works!"
It is another day the most that tech sector will get trashed. I don't see any hedge fund managers who don't want to buy more of PYPL. It is the price that they don't want to pay. Anyway they still have to pay finally because PYPL is too good to be ignored.
Anyone think PYPL will ever pay dividends some day?
put a sell order in @ $260 today. God's are with me 
Very strategic buy and a took a while to consummate. Well done!
"Close to a billion Chinese are using mobile payments platforms. If PayPal can capture 0.05 of that, they would add another 50 million people to its platform. If PayPal sticks, you’re talking possibly 200 million newly added net active users in 18-24 months."
this is a fed owned market. up is the only option.
PYPL is down -6.24% to 79.99
It's a rotation out of tech for now.
"Ok just reach $172 already then we can start to move up, market is making the charts right now"
"sorry to say say but just think about it for a minute. pypl and sq are a dying breed how are they going to compete with the headwinds of fb, visa, MC and all of the major banks."
WHOOOOOO HOOOOOOO!!!!!! We are getting RICH!!!!!!!
PayPal just announced a deep partnership inside the Google ecosystem.
I told everyone here in early afternoon that PYPL stock was showing no evidence of optimism - as its stock price mirrored the NASDAQ. You had to sell by 3ish once it started to dip. Tell-tale evidence of when not to hold a stock into the close.
One of my best purchases. Love this stock.
It will make its run to $70 shortly. Too much good stuff going on with PYPL

"Cramer just put PYPL on the ""UP stocks"" list...companies that are hot that typically stay hot as fund managers add winners to their portfolios to close out the year to show fundholders they were picking the right stocks."
"Should’ve bougut more of this stock when it was around 200... love PayPal. Great app, and some awesome initiatives"
pypl gap around 45 to fill. economic slowdown is real and is severe.
Sold. Not going to be greedy. Will buy later on
I bought the stock on a dip 231 last week. I didnt even expect such a great profit in this short amount of time just wanted to own the stock because I use paypal for like 5 years already and I prefer it over everything most of the time. I am definitely going to hold this for long time
Started buying more PayPal and I’m prepared to continue buying as long as it keeps going down. This is the type of stock you buy into weakness. I’m also picked up calls at the close. Looking to buy more on the dip tomorrow.
CEO selling shares is not good. Some surprise coming soon?
"huuuuge day. wow. I didn't think we would surge like this today following a big week, but damn paypal just can't be stopped"
selling is done folks. This stock is going to through the roof. PayPal is an incredible company! I'm so excited about this one
I would love this dip if I didn’t already have a large position at $180. Might DCA with margin if it keeps dropping. This is ridiculously cheap. Could be a trillion dollar company in the future
I’m in PYPL. Why does SQ have stellar share price growth execution while PYPL doesn’t (dismal at best)? PYPL business execution is stellar compared to SQ! Is speculation (of SQ) trumping solid (PYPL) reasoning? Any other ideas?
Relax everybody. This drop is healthy. The meteoric rise is starting to feel a bit eerie and unsettling.
Play pal isn’t done
"Pay pal going to beat the estimate and whisper numbers . Those bought heavy put on 88 put, they are losing the money . If they short the put that’s okay . See you after hour with mr Franklin . $100"
This will hit 70 again . Who’s buying at that price
Congrats to the Long dawgs who enjoyed this last run up! When I can move some things around and free money up I’m back on the PYPL train! This seems like a good forum with lots of nice people compared to other stocks!
"Priced for a move of $4.85. Couple that with a broader market rally, this thing has moved almost exactly what the Market Makers predicted."
"bought too early@67.26, np"
"Ayden is not newsworthy enough to tank Paypal. How many years will it take to even be credible? People do not switch from Netflix to Amazon Video just because it is there. So why would someone switch to Ayden just because it exists now on Ebay. Do people just switch their bank because another bank comes to town. By the time people even learn how to pronounce Ayden Paypal will have found other revenue streams. Apple pay could not challenge Paypal, does Ayden really sound like it can? Paypal was part of Ebay, and it knows how to compete in that market. It has economies of scale and could even make a price war for Ayden. I would be more concerned about Ebay getting back into the payment business. As it could not do this right last time and spun Paypal off."
"Guy Adami (CNBC) was saying he would buy in the low 80, hopefully his friends are buying too."

PYPL makes Cashapp and Venmo look like a complete joke.
"From a Canadian perspective, PayPal is everywhere here. Many apps incorporate them into it and even our own government does with our tax agency. I use them all the time for my eBay business. They are constantly #1 in the App Store for finance. Don’t underestimate PayPal."
Frustrating. I wrote a hand written letter to pay pal customer service . They still have not written back I even put : attention ELON MUSK
One of the great positives.... Ebay agreement through 2023 three years longer than before! Again folks be careful of over exuberance. Remember we have four quarters per year!

Why PayPal is going down ?
company is brilliant
"Tim Seymour, the Dean of Wall Street, isa buyer of PayPal.We also are buying GPK."
PYPL needs to either split the stock or pay a 5% dividend. Pay the owners (shareholders).
PayPal reached an all time high at 211.98
Do you think PYPL stock has the potential to touch 200 by 2020 end?
shortsbetter buy now before 350 comes !!!!all aboard!!!
Need a little bit of advice. PYPL or SQ? I am very bullish on the whole sector so I love both but at current valuations and expected future developments I am leaning towards PYPL. When PYPL rolls out crypto will you be able to pay people with it? Like can I pay my friend in crypto? - any info is much appreciated
PYPL is not a stock that will jump 100% in a year. Not a stock that will go even 50% in a year.But sure is a stock that you will get a good average of 10-25% per year staying LONG. Sometimes it is better to go for the stocks with a higher chance of going 10-25% per year VS the ones that can go 100%-250% per year but with a low chance. This is why spread out your portfolio. STNE and PAGS are also good stocks to own. Not involved with trade wars. They are in Brazil.
My credit union has a PayPal button on their web page now!
Why can't you all focus on stocks. Is PayPal going to continue their dominance in fintech? I s one of the bigs boys going to buy them out? That woul make sense seeing how big this space is. Facebook an achieve a lot of it's goals that much faster.
"If you are interested in PayPal, you should watch this recent interview with the CEO. Very interesting to see him pretty much give away that PayPal was buying back shares during the recent drop =) He also talks about Amazon Pay, eBay, cryptos and the blockchain starting at 21:10 https://youtu.be/-RqXiId-u4k?t=21m10s"
yes paypal come back down so we can be one again. i'll never leave you again
"I’m pretty conservative normally regarding share prices, but this needs to be at 270 already"
"eSports, sports cards and sports gambling. So many transactions going through the paypal ecosystem. People are paying entry fees, getting winnings and then paying more entry fees. Consistent cycle and paypal is taking a piece of the pie on each transaction"
Had another company I own (pets) beat big time and raised guidance. Down over 20% since. Market getting nervous I guess.
"PYPL should be serious about building BRAND "" VENMO "". It is a MUST in order to hook on the consumers. So PAYPAL , VENMO and ONE TOUCH. It is very unique to have brands and words that is easy to recall. I think VENMO and ONE TOUCH will be the big winner next year. Don't forget INDIA and CHINA are the big markets and still in the infant stage. I just keep PARLAY PYPL quarter to quarter."
"I've been buying paypal since it was $64 and adding along the way, even when bought at peak times this stock always rebounds in no time, this is better than pretty much any stock out there and I cant rationalize how anyone would sell this stock given it's track record, I will add some more to my position at bell opening."
another record breaking quarter
Will today be a good day to buy more PYPL?
When the market opens this will open at 82
"Here is my theory. $PYPL, $SQ, $MA and $V are all reporting this week or by the end of month. The big boys are pushing the price down because they anticipate bad reports for the payment sector. When the report gets released, retail investors and algos will sell at the already reduced price, pushing price even lower. Thats when the big boys can scoop up all the shares at a low price."
I don’t know why the articles keep mention only venmo and zelle. Do they know that we also have square cash P to P transfers? I want to know how square cash compares to these two services
"Buying opportunity, guys!!!"

SHOULD I BUY A MILLION SHARES? CAUSE I CAN PUMP DIS STOCK!
"Big, come back??? "
We are now Uber owners fellow Longs. And at the IPO price. Brilliant move by Schulman. Look how many rides a day Uber undertakes world wide. That’s a tremendous amount of potential payments. Story keeps getting better with this gem of a company. Stock looks cheap here.
But its great to be out and pick it up low at support again. Maximum boost!
Not recovering at all today!
Nice cup and handle formed for our next move up!
"Buying more here Buffet could add more, back to $50 should be stronger than $PAGS , Like $PYPL"
they're still trying to write their own story since the eBay misunderstanding by shareholders.
Been disappointed in the price action of this stock lately geez.
BUT I am all about the charts when it comes to trading and now now it's time to get in. Their numbers though are awesome!!
"$DPW If $RIOT can get $25+ with 7 employees with no tech exp, what can a actual tech company like DPW do? $PYPL $SQ $ROKU $AMD $MARA $GROW"
Oh so close!
Spam on this site is amazing.
There will be more lock downs coming fully or partially in most of the states by the governors. Even if Trump don't agree with it.
This is about the time that people go from fear to massive opportunism at the carnage of buying opps. We lived thru much higher rates and tech was fine $sq $pypl $dm $amZn $aapl
"I understand how Venmo allows people to split the cost of meals, rides etc. however, I am not 100% sure how Paypal in general works. Will somebody please be kind enough to give me a simple explanation? I would appreciate it."
"Jim Cramers ""up stocks"" Include PayPalSource:https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/the-up-stocks-cramers-mad-money-recap-thursday-11-19-20"
"I want some opinion on Honey.There was a lot of negativity about this buy for 4B, way too expensive many felt.Dan S never updated on this company since. Wonder if anyone knows anything?"
"Also, I'd use tomorrows dip as a buying opportunity"
"Like TSLA, another poster child for the asset bubble the Fed has blown during this global depression. How big can the bubble get before it pops?It will probably go up higher than anyone can imagine, but within a year it will probably be trading under 10.Wonder how nimble all this optimistic money is, pouring into the market during the worst crisis in history, with no other thesis than the Fed has got their back."
Anyone knows anything yet?
How much exposure would you think PayPal has in business/personal travel space? I think little to none. If true we go to 200 Thursday.
"As a relative newbie in the stock market, I don't understand this massive after-hours sell-off. After reading the report, I was thinking I made a gamble that paid off big-time - looks as though I am sadly mistaken. Can someone help me understand why PYPL is tanking? Thank you."
PYPL is the better value...period!!!! $95.00 very soon....by Friday!!!
Zoom will propel this stock up. Next stop $150. Steady climber.
Any predictions of price after earnings? I say $100
"Bought for 10k, This Journey Never Ends"
"It keeps getting better and better, $141.12 p/m."
PayPal just struck a deal with Chevron and not to mention that the Phoenix Suns (NBA team) also made a global partnership with PayPal. I guess people are not seeing the news because we have a lot going for us guys hang in there
GRWG=alert the tesla of pot stocks going up fast
"$80 is a good start, I'm looking for $88....."
GO PYPL GO!!!
"Funny how a #$%$ like LMND is up huge after going to 103 yesterday,but PYPL can't even break and hold 234 lol such a joke this stock is!"
Come on bulls lets take her back to 350
Huge buying opportunity!!! A great company with a great earning and outlook. It enters Chinese market. It has a huge growing potential!!!
This is a good healthy growing stock!
forecasting revenue growth in the current situation is very difficult. note that many large tech companies have skipped the guidance. with covid cases rising there will be a huge boost in online shopping that will drive paypal's business.
Pay my Pal!
Here it is! $200! Cover now shorts!
Next week this will be over 200
PayPal just recovered faster than Kevins comments on yahoo finance
b of a with a fresh target if 282 just now
"I honestly cannot believe I got this stock for 110$, will hold forever and love this company in both ways: as a customer and as an investor. Good luck to you all"
This happens every quarter but it usually takes at least a day or 2 to recover. Momentum will be stronger than usual. Expect 150+ in the short term.
It would be nice to hear about the beginning of dividend payouts this quarter 
Good interview with CFO on Mad Money BUT Schulman should have done the interview. Nevertheless the company is in great shape with strong drivers going forward. We will make up today’s hiccup in no time. Onto $100 by the Ides is March. :))
"CEO Dan said in conference call, china 500m e-commerce shoppers, with PayPal inside the ecosystem this will enable cross border payments . multinational companies like coca cola , Starbucks, apple , who are in China can now accept PayPal as additional payment options. they are also partnering with alipay and wechatpay to enable Chinese clients when going overseas or wanting to buy western products to pay via PayPal. this is hugee"
So will Covid19 impact PYPL another way it will impact Visa/MasterCard? Can anyone explain the difference?
have some money to spend. should I buy $pypl or $sq
SQ UP 4.50$ (premarket)PYPL still down 1.80$( premarket)Pypl also deals with Bitcoin and we are down ????Do we not have any Apps that can deal with trading stocks like SQ.
my business will no longer accept cash! war on cash has begun!
buy if you want to make some money
Plan to load tomorrow on this Ebay news.
stay strong holder we definitely beat this earnings report
Looks like a market reversal in progress. Let's hope it holds!
"I guess PYPL will beat the estimates 52 cents. I will let my far east estimates number on Jan 24, 10 minutes before the close. Now I see PYPL will have a good chance to hit 87, because it does not pull back along with the tech stock."
I own the stock but I have heard very bad comments from their clients . Most of their reviews are one * star as they are randomly shutting people out and holding onto their money.for months. I think this is unhealthy behavior.
Keep in mind market makers manipulate the stock prices. They look at the volume in Option trading especially on Fridays. They'll stop payment to 265 Puts and 270 call options. Both will finish the day WORTHLESS. This is how they eat up our money.
BFT could be a good play off PYPL results
IT’S OFFICIAL!I now own .63833..... BITCOIN & 25 LITECOINS PURCHASED THROUGH PAYPAL
market might survive but paypal has just given up..
Three stocks to be in right now: $SQ $PYPL and $TCEHY.
This is going to take a quarter to recover at least. 110 again?
"Watch AMZN, if AMZN goes up,just keep buying PYPL."
"If you shorts didn't cover from before earnings, it's better you do it now. Save yourself the heartache before PayPal empties your pockets even further."
get in before 1/25/2018 and ride this puppy up.
If ur holding a bag at 300 don’t worry your investment will pay off. Outlook is to triple users in 4 years. If you triple ur users shouldn’t you also triple ur value
Terrible customer service and can't even keep accounts safe from hacking. Wont be long until we hear this company in the news.
Remember the days when a few of the Square holders would come here and trash Pypl? Guess the market put them in their place
"we are green whilst the rest are mostly red, cos this is a quality company."
$160 today? looks promising!
"waiting till next quarter, if it disappoints, Im ditching. putting my money somewhere else"
"sorry guys, i just bought......thats probably why it is going down "
"What a remarkable day to load up ACROSS THE BOARD. Funneled nearly all available cash now into PYPL and TSLA. Patience will be rewarded, as always!"
Really???!!!? SQ is already green plus some.......this #$%$ fighting not to go down further nevermind going green
now time to buy?
There is more than enough opportunity for PayPal and Square to be successful. Visa and MasterCard are competitors and they are both successful. PayPal is a larger company so the price will not appreciate as fast as Square. Stay long with PayPal and you will make a lot of money.
"Buy the dip today, you won't regret it!"
We should all try calling Jim Cramer tonight and ask him what he thinks about PYPL
Definitely a buy
Paypals crypto exchange is a beast for future earnings.....
Y’all who were calling PayPal going 60’s a couple weeks ago crack me up
all aboard
Loving it
I personally used PYPL and bought a ton of stuff while quarantine and I believe PYPL will report solid ER and forecast would jump due to more users and more company adding PYPL option to their stores like WMT. I guess that's why so many firms are upgrading this stocks target to $140 and above.
don't listen to some #$%$ up analyst trying to pull back it and jump back. they missed the boat. fellas do your due diligence and d
Went short heavy from the top this morning. This POS is way over priced I don't care what analyst hacks say
The “Square(SQ)” effect.
eBay market place revenue only grew 3-year-CAGR by 4%..PayPal market place revenue grew 3-year-CAGR 23%
"Analyst target prices are worthless. They only serve to manipulate a share price for the good of a related enity to the analyst. PYPL is a perfect example. Compare recent analysts target prices of $15 to $51/shr for AMRN which is trading sub- $7’s... I don’t trust Cramer, Motley Fool, or any other “Analyst/Commentator.”"
Square snapchat payment no more..wah wah wah.........
"Price after buying the new company today will go up againIt will take one,two or three monthsDon't care,here until 2025 minimum"
Guidance... Guidance...Guidance. When will you investors learn that Guidance is what drives stocks after hours during earnings releases.
"Over 6 months ago I congratulated the PYPL shareholders (of which I was one) for the fine returns the Company had earned ... however, I encouraged the PYPL shareholders to consider two equities -- HURC and SQ )mid-$50s) as I was of the belief both would begin to scale over the next year for above what ""momentum"" was remaining in PYPL. Well...... SQ has moved over 80% while PYPL moved 12% (still a good return). Today with SQ's strong move up and PYPL down, I believe ""pair trades"" are occurring in the ""thin-finance"" sector.... Thus, for the next 3 months, without justification to fundamental rationale, SQ will continue to significantly outpace PYPL. Just my two centavos!"
Huge short squeeze coming
this is being held down by algos. no other reason for this to be stalling flat.
$STNE dominates fin tech in Latin America should catch up to PayPal
$220 breakout.
"PayPal and Square could be this decade’s high flying tech winners, according to Credit Suisse.The firm released its projections for the “next generation of potential winners” in technology, and finance technology companies PayPal and Square top the list.All of the companies on the list have a market cap between $1 billion and $100 billion, have cash-flow return on investment that is greater than their cost of capital and show early signs of improving cash-flow returns. The technology companies need to be reinvesting their cash at “decent rates” and demonstrate earnings growth, Credit Suisse HOLT technology sector specialist John Talbott said in a note to clients on Tuesday."
Story repeats. Slower forecast on next Q by management and they would again beat that up and stock would keep going up. Does it matter? No. This is on the road of touching 90. Either you be in or you be out.
has it ever been this easy to take profits out of the stock market? has trump effected an executive order prohibiting the selling off of the equity markets?
"This is the most important information from the call and what will drive pypl to new highs:Schulman also pointed to Pay With Venmo as a priority in the year ahead, referring to a function that lets Venmo users purchase items and services with their accounts much like they would with the traditional PayPal button.“There’s a lot of work going on around that right now because we think that’s a very big opportunity that we did not take as much advantage of last year as we probably could have,” he said."
"So, was there any mention of additional buybacks?"
"Insider buys at the market price at 74, few months ago. Schulman gave some clue about massive mobile transaction and E-commerce surging over 50%, plus Rainey does not worry about VENMO's rival such as ZELLE. Let me tell you some thing, ZELLE takes 2 days to transfer money, and has the max. limit per day and per month. It is for P-P, not for the business. VENMO is for P-P and business. VENMO has head start over 3-4 years before ZELLE. So it is no brainer to compare apple and orange."
Selling I’m scared
Analysts downgrades coming. One analyst either JP Morgan or GS hung the phone up on the CEO. Simply amazing.
"I love PYPL. I ALSO love SQ. Both are powerhouses, and I hope you all are invested in both. Nothing like have the best of both worlds:) GLTA!!!!"
Congrats to those who bought at the bottom
$275 after americans xmess spending is reported
"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman: ""Rise of Digital Wallets Will Drive PayPal's Growth""""...The digitization of the global economy combined with the rise of digital wallets will drive our growth. In Q3, our total payment volume grew by a record 36% on an FX neutral basis to $247 billion in annual run rate, just shy of $1 trillion.""Over the next year, both the Venmo and PayPal apps will undergo a fundamental transformation intended to dramatically increase their functionality and drive engagement...This expanded suite of services will include enhanced direct deposit and check cashing, budget and savings tools, bill pay, investment alternatives, including crypto, subscription management, buy now, pay later optionality and all of Honey's shopping tools from wish list, price monitoring, deals, coupons, and rewards...We recently announced that PayPal will allow account holders to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies first, in the U.S. and then expanding to international markets in the Venmo platform in the first half of next year...We will rapidly move at the beginning of next year and allow consumers to use cryptocurrencies as a funding instrument to shop across all 28 million of our merchants. This solution will not involve any additional integrations, volatility risk or incremental transaction fees for either consumers or merchants and will fundamentally bolster the utility of cryptocurrencies…"""
hmm usually this mirrors the Nasdaq... not a good sign for us longs
Another day on the struggle bus....
"Hold or Buy....Don't Sell!!! MM is #$%$ you out of your stock. """"""If you remember from when we first told you about it, we were in PayPal primarily for Venmo. Venmo is PayPal?s app that is widely used by millennials. Venmo, in this last quarter, did $10.4 billion in transactions. This is 86% growth compared to last year. That?s crazy good growth! And exactly what we expected and want to see.And generally, PayPal?s business is booming, with its profits skyrocketing higher by 59% compared to last year.Now, if you look at the stock, you?ll see it?s down by almost 6%. You might be surprised by this. If you listened to this week?s podcast, I told you that hedge funds and market makers use news to get people to panic and sell stocks they want to go down. And that?s exactly what we have going on today.You see, PayPal announced that eBay, which used to own PayPal before it became an independent, separate company, is going to phaseout using it as the default payment system between 2020 and 2023.Right now, around 22% of PayPal?s 2016 revenue comes from eBay?s platform. That?s down from 26% in 2015 and 29% in 2014. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, in a conference call to discuss the quarter, said that the loss of part of its business with eBay would be ?quite manageable,? and had been assumed for some time. John Rainey, PayPal?s CFO, told investors that the eBay business is low growth and low margin for their company, and that it?s a drag on profitability. Finally, they expect that the lost eBay business will be more than made up from recently signed agreements for PayPal with Disney, Home Depot and QVC. Bottom line, hold on to your PayPal stock. Today?s decline is just one more instance of market makers trying to get you to panic and sell your stock to them on the cheap.You know what happens next. Once all the people who are going to sell are done, the market makers will go to sell the stock you sold them for higher prices."""""""""
The big boys shorting before earning are trying to push the price down so they can close their short positions without loss or with less loss but at the current level they are running the risk being squeezed by other even bigger boys...
I think I’m gonna trim some SQ and pick up PYPL.
Insiders sell
is 145 the resistance
"I think I will buy more PYPL shares today, what do you all think."
PYPL will deliver Wednesday eveving!!!! BUY...BUY...BUY!
Looks like the party is over!!
That chart guru Carter that CNBC always parades out called PayPal one of the three best stocks to buy now. We will topple $100 by Easter. IMHO
Nice earnings for PayPal. Hope it soars :) take some profits to $TEUM. You won’t be disappointed :)
The last years worth of ER have been great and the company is growing great and they’ve made lots of moves I expect good things but I don’t like how bearish the market is right now
SQ looks better today
"People are using more and more PayPal (no touch) because of pandemic, that’s my observation, I have a retail business."
Kev is considering to be organ donor
Steady as a rock on 34 million shares ~ 4x AV.
sold everything yesterday 
ARK Must be buying today!
Just found out that PYPL got alerted by http://Experttrade.uno. Seems bullish
breaks out and keeps the up trend.
500 bitcoin will make this explode digital currency the future
"So... PYPL drops because Evil-Bay will majority-partner with a largely unknown upstart Dutch firm. I spent the last ten minutes looking at my past year’s purchases/transactions via Paypal. I purchased items - inexpensive and luxury - with Paypal from private sellers and stores in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Canada. I bought a few guitars with Paypal from vintage guitar shops in Japan. I did a lot of buying from a plethora of U.S. retailers, too. Oh, and I received payments via Paypal from clients in Italy, Switzerland, France, New Zealand, UK, Netherlands, Japan, Taipei, Tasmania, Norway, Canada and about 20 states in the USA. My ‘paltry’ total of in-and-out monies/transactions via Paypal for 2017 was in excess of $100K. And? NOT ONE TRANSACTION - zero, zilch, nada - with Paypal and Ebay, together. None. You really think PYPL gives a dotard #$@! about Evil-Bay?"
"I have had it with Paypal. A relative in another state wants a loan pronto. He needs to pay some income tax by tomorrow night. I tried to send money and the site said it could not be completed. After talking to the computer at customer service, the computer and I agreed they would call me back in 40 minutes. One hour and 40 minutes later, a person called me. He was po;ite, but after beating around the bush, said my $300 transaction was too large. I have used Paypal to pay for ebay transactions since 2001. I have bought vehicles on ebay and paid with Paypal. The guy was polite so I was polite about telling him I was very disappointed overall, and I suggested he be ready to find a new job when ebay changes payment methods and people realize that was the only thing Paypal could do."
After hours now showing 4% down. This is all very strange. Wish the computers would make up their minds
Schulman! WE WANT DIVIDENDS! DIVIDENDS! DIVIDENDS! Shareholders need to bang the drum! DIVIDENDS!
yes but only if you believe in Far Left thought! Otherwise they drop you if your not drinking the Kool Aid
Square exploding as well.. another great investment to jump on gang.PayPal + Square + GROW = $$
my best pal is Paypal.
PayPal definitely taking a breather.. but let not your heart be troubled... we see $80 soon.
"Time to load up. This is not a pump, just a bit of “no brainer” advice from someone who has done fairly well in the markets over the last 50+ years. Buy and hold for 6+ months. Guaranteed you will not regret it."
Get ready when they announce full year results.
I bought this at $95 looking good!
SQ will demolish PayPal
"This is one of the biggest no brainers, perhaps the biggest"
Hey Big Mao... How's that silver dip buying working our for you???
If anything buy on any dip in price. I agree
"If this isn't MM's carving out major profits with volatility, what is?"
I just loaded up a bunch here long. I dont care about the earnings
Thank you CPAK for undermining or Democracyand causing stock sell off. We just love Jared & Invanka
I wouldn't bet against PayPal .
"Cautiously optimistic where we may be headed now. Although futures are green, they can quickly turn. Biden has never laid out an economic plan, so how long will the momentum carry us before the big reversal hits? Time to revisit short term goals. Enjoy the opening surge while it lasts!"
"Wow, great ER. Too bad market is confused, this should be up 10%+ right now."
UP UP
green coming
pypl could be UP like BITCOIN soon as digital payment will be dominant in this world shortly this year like bitcoin.....
PayPal reached an all time high at 145.63
You can gamble with Square that's way overbought or you can get PayPal at a steep discount. Buy now and enjoy the run to $100 by September.
"This payment sector will report like the banks did, all good news a jump of 10% up today after earnings."
"PLEASE, could all haters just **** off, thanks"
"Daddy Cramer tells me to buy PayPal, so I buy PayPal. He's just trying to make me some money, right?"
Buy point at all time high 
Seller all down. Now shorts will bring us the Money.
"Isn’t there a saying that, what goes up, must come down, and what goes down must go up? I think it was first spoken in 1929...."
"Analyst RecommendationsThe current consensus among 42 polled investment analysts is to buy stock in PayPal Holdings Inc. This rating has held steady since October, when it was unchanged from a buy rating."
Anybody buying PYPL today?
ultra tiny volume today. DISTRIBUTION continues.
Does anyone know why PYPL is down??
Next support is $203
@ $250 which is $10 more PayPUKE  has to rally 25% to break even from 10 days ago LOL 
The bulls have it ! Back to $254 by ER
"$95 by mid-Sep, almost guaranteed."
I figure any shares I got under 300 is a deal
the next selloff will be EPIC baggies.
"PayPal fam, sold all my stocks on robinhood and going to transfer to gdax and invest in cryptos. glta"
"Chris, we always appreciate what you publish. "
"When my Square was $160 and PayPal was $200, I told you 100 times, Square 100x better stock to own. Well, look here, one is $202 and one is $193, lol. You all chose poorly"
"Hey guys :-), can someone please tell me why I can not post links here?"
another chance for people to buy into paypal
"The shorts are punching walls in frustration right now. And I'm watching the money roll in. Been a bull on PYPL since $42 a share, and am not about to quit being one anytime soon."
distribution continues. more upgrades and a 100 basis point cut are required to keep the scam going.
"one has to own PYPL, V, MA and SQ. also look at STNE who's price is coming right to you!"
Call Cramer tonight and get his thought on PYPL
$200 by Friday
This thing needs an energy drink or something.
Ouch
"Does someone upgrade PYPL, why PYPL just pop up to 1.60 in less than 5 min."
"Im a small investor what would people recommend buying more visa, more PayPal or MA?"
I know more people now who use amazon over ebay.
"Got another example this week of corruption in our government, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, Hillary lies to the FBI on her servers, she deletes 33,000 emails after she receives a subpoena, a State department senior offical tries to bribe the FBI to declassify some of Hillary's emails, her IT staff takes the 5th amendment rather than tesitfy to Congress on erasing the servers, the pay for play Clinton Foundation, the rigged Deomcratic primaries, and now the FBI has reopened the email investigation. It just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens. Why hasn't the Press called this out?FYI, the reason Hillary wants open borders is that aliens typically vote Democratic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PK-SK0h9o"

PayPal reached an all time high at 252.88
PayPal and GROW!!GROW crossing $6 soon
This is a very healthy pullback. Big money is shaking out weak hands. BOTTOM LINE: PayPal is going to make a big movement into India which offers upwards of 750 million new PayPal users. It is also very beneficial that India wants to demonetize.
"Guess what, the purchases shift from physical world to online world is taking place, and PayPal should benefit from this phenomenon. https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/grocery-delivery-apps-see-record-downloads-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/"
