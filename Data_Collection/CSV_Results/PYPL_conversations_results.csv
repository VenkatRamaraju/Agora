"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman: ""Rise of Digital Wallets Will Drive PayPal's Growth""""...The digitization of the global economy combined with the rise of digital wallets will drive our growth. In Q3, our total payment volume grew by a record 36% on an FX neutral basis to $247 billion in annual run rate, just shy of $1 trillion.""Over the next year, both the Venmo and PayPal apps will undergo a fundamental transformation intended to dramatically increase their functionality and drive engagement...This expanded suite of services will include enhanced direct deposit and check cashing, budget and savings tools, bill pay, investment alternatives, including crypto, subscription management, buy now, pay later optionality and all of Honey's shopping tools from wish list, price monitoring, deals, coupons, and rewards...We recently announced that PayPal will allow account holders to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies first, in the U.S. and then expanding to international markets in the Venmo platform in the first half of next year...We will rapidly move at the beginning of next year and allow consumers to use cryptocurrencies as a funding instrument to shop across all 28 million of our merchants. This solution will not involve any additional integrations, volatility risk or incremental transaction fees for either consumers or merchants and will fundamentally bolster the utility of cryptocurrencies…"""
by end of next weak this stock will be at 95...that's because my Feb 8 95 options will come due :( ...so hang in there after the 8th 100 will be next stop !
Bob Pisani on CNBC just now calls out Ethereum to be the eventual winner in the Crypto space. PYPL accepts Ethereum which Mr. Pisani says has the greatest transactional qualities over other Cryptocurrencies worldwide. I see strong earnings tomorrow with excellent guidance for this stock going into 2nd half of 2021 and beyond. Great buying opportunity today.
You retire with this one. The story just keeps getting better. Awesome company.
"Align also announced after hours and crushed it. It's down too, there are a lot of ""investors"" betting on bad news versus what's coming out. I'm really feeling bad for them. But I'll feel much better tomorrow when these stock start the upward trend."
"Buying opportunity, a great company!!!"
New Covid mutation in England So interesting day a had
"way, how often do you use PayPal? After many frustrations with their service I have decided to close my account once I managed to withdraw my balance ( which is proving to be difficult) . I don't get why PayPal is any better than using a visa card or Google pay service, their procedures are pretty outdated. Given I can now sell on eBay without PayPal account I fail to see any reason for keeping the account."
Loading up more shares
"Fantastic Report, frankly the total valuation of the company should be much higher!"
Upgrades on the way mark my words!! God loves me I know it
"The funny thing is, when a stock will really go down, institutions will make it to look like going up, when a stock will really go up, institutions will make it to look like going down. I just found MU, l guess it will go up a lot very soon!"
"It's glaringly obvious now all the stars are perfectly aligned for PYPL, by chance or by the executives' brilliance.1. The democratization of money started few years back (as Dan Shulman described it last year).2. Crypto mania3. Pandemic sends everyone into internet tradingThe only pitiful part is that when things had become so obvious, the price almost certainly had already shot up at least 500% - 600%. Even more pitiful, invariably stock analysts start frantically recommending it NOW. Who needs an analyst at this point???"
Thumbs up if you use PayPal frequently and haven’t bought anything on eBay in the last two years. Thumbs down if you buy on eBay and will switch to another payment service.
"Institutions are waiting and grabbing the sell off done by young chaps. Yesterday, Josh Brown said he will not sold his position no matter whatever high it goes. In case if there is a profit taking, he said, he will only load up more. So this is a blessing to them. Young chaps are gifting shares to institutions!"
My business model and analysis puts this stock at $300 range within 3 years. Enjoy the ride buy the dips. paper money and checks are the past plastic and digital are the future. This is the next MSFT ….
Tomorrow up 19%
"This company is an 800 lb gorilla in the sweet spot of mobile payments, a cyclical trend in society. They also have one of the best CEO's out there. I bought this in late 2015 in the low 30's and held it as they executed. I now have over a triple, this is the definition of a quality investment stock. I can't relate to some posters trading for pennies, it's tax inefficient and real wealth is not created that way. I own many other stocks that have done this well over the last 2-4 years. Just my thoughts"
$25 billion rev. Forecast next year
Not the crypto thru PayPal and the mark up on my Bitcoin was $440 on my 10 dollars. Avoid this site for any crypto trades. I am not new to trading crypto avoid
"If you had the opportunity to purchase shares @ $34, as they were when they went public, would you?"
PYPL just bought back 5.15 million shares back
"I will consider buying this at $220. Hopefully, it will get there soon."
European markets will be epic for paypal...
"no idea what happened, but this just went on sale, bot 3k very happy!"
"Barring a broader correction in the market, does anyone have a realistic EOY price estimate with a reasonable justification?"
In February will be in 275 to 300 and for then is gonna be late.......
let us see how this will run up tomorrow!!!!
Analyst upgrades forthcoming.
I sold tonight :))) nice £700 profit. Will buy back near the $200
"Gah, I don’t know what to do. Long term holder since eBay spinoff...about 10% of my non-IRA portfolio. I don’t like this P/E around 65. I can see hitting $100 then sitting back and trading sideways for some time...I’ve got all the excitement I need in SQ and POTN. Might just cash out PYPL and increase my T which is a steal at 37 with its nice dividend. Love that monthly chunk of change for more speculative plays like MJ, which I believe stages a comeback this year... Constructive thoughts welcome."
total meltup as US economy craters! fed reserve will NOT let the market sell off. ultra bullish. rate cuts imminent. pypl will double. venmo millenials will spend until ma and pa are homeless!
Going to $300+
BEAST!
PayPal just approved Bitcoin transactions. Huge!
"With bitcoin being all the hype and rage now, I believe PYPL will over perform big time going forward, I have been buying crypto through paypal and they are making a lot of money in fees besides all the other stellar service products, I use paypal a lot more than my checking account, debit or credit cards and just like me I see the world adopting fintech more than traditional banking and so this is the future, great company and great stock, I will be adding more to my portfolio."
Just jumping in here. So what's the buzz with PayPal? Haven't bought in yet though
Tracking with naz today 1:1. Not a lot you can do except hang on. The rotation out of tech right now just defies logic though. Once the momentum plays are over they'll be back though.
Who sees this stock gaining another 30% this year?
I yolod all my money at 249.6. Lets do it.
"Short-term gains, Long-term pains."
this market is a traders paradise and an investor's nightmare
BUY THE DIP
Beat by $1.
Convince why this is a better buy than V or MA
PayPal though..... IS KING.
This is a strong buy right now in my opinion. SQ up huge with a P/E ratio far higher than PYPL. Just some profit taking today. We’ll see 200 in no time.
"Bode well for SQ, the other horseman of the group?"
Venmo and Honey are the future. Years of upside ahead
People you act like the post earnings dip was a surprise. Don't you all realize this is computer generated selling regardless of earnings UNLESS they are just astronomical?? Pypl beat and raised and they will be fine.
"Venmo is partnering with Uber to add @Venmo as a payment option in the @Uber and @UberEats mobile apps so Venmo users can easily pay for, split and share rides and meals with friends on Venmo.https://t.co/Qqa47v9xOt"
Green soonBuy buy buy
"$7,000,000,000 more cash!"
Screaming buy until 300. Then I downgrade to STRONG BUY
Anybody buying PayPal tomorrow or Monday? PLPY
PFANG ( I still pronounce it FANG with the P silent) is set to increase another 3-7 % next week. Why? Not only PayPal but Visa and Mastercard are set to report Feb. 1st!
Shorts better buy now before 270!!!
$310 tomorrow. book it
"While CVS is the first national retailer to rollout PayPal's QR code checkout, PayPal has 10 other major retailers signed up for rollout, including Nike, Tumi, Bed Bath & Beyond and Samsonite, among others. It's in discussions with well over 100 large retailers about the technology, as well."
"Yes, great news about PYPL and as the article says the NASDAQ was up 2% for the week.Yet the MM’s took PYPL down almost 4% from the week before’s close.A lot of nonsense and trying to shake out retail traders.PYPL, killing it!Extremely bullish."
today hurt me more than my wife leaving me for our family doctor.
"Newest price target is $125Are we there by November 1st, thumbs up or down vote?"
Why is SQ up 22$. Doesn't PYPL do the same thing. I don't get it.
This dip made me say bye bye to my average cost of $45 now doubling up the position.
Closing in on $100
Visa and PayPal partnership should boost PYPL Monday
A great buying opportunity at this price!!!

"2021 should be another big year for our winner PYPL. Continuation of their growth in digital everything including Bitcoin, it's hard to guess how high this will go. It should easily double or may be triple perhaps by end of 2021."
Owned PYPL since it was spun off from EBAY. Several years later no plans to sell.
Why is square catching you PayPal?
Show me a little green.........
GROW up 35% today. Is that good? :)
No - we are not done here yet...
Anybody have an opinion on PayPal’s investing in Uber?
About time we took out the 52 week high. PayPal been a bit late to the party but better late than never. It’s our time!
"Nobody thinks that this is a market crash, the beginning?Something I have a premonition"
ARK bought more PAYPAL.Too the moon........ monday.
The US Government continues to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially via infinite margin trading desks to giveaway trillions of dollars in the form of Capital Gains!FED Must HIKE the rates by 3.5%-4% to stop Skyrocketing Inflation!National and Corporate Debt is now unbearable! The US Government MUST and WILL Hike Corporate and income tax rate by 200-300% very soon!The US Stocks are in the MEGA BUBBLE! The Market is INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!A HEAVY MARKET CORRECTION and FINANCIAL CRISIS is imminent!$PYPL $SQ $SHOP
I loaded heavy AH last night saw a lot of big orders come in. So far so good!
Did I hear that FaceBook is interested in PayPal? I think I’m I a buyer come Monday
"bought ETH on pay pal, easy and safe to use, not like the wallets that your money disappears"
It down now. What's happening??
Can you hear the shorts squealing?
"wow! Venmo processed more than $27B of TPV in Q3, up 64%."
Who uses mobile payments?
I bought this yesterday very high. I hope I’m not going to be a bag holder.
Close positive!
This is the biggest down day I have ever seen in PYPL and on HUGE volume; they are going to miss & warn on earnings for sure
Very upset about the performance of Paypal in the last 3 days.On a positive day in the market still can not even hold above 107.00...
85! 85! 85! breakout coming?
Best quarterly earnings report in company history stated by CNBC!!!
BUY BIG!will see you at 350 next month!
"Wall Street can see what % of stocks are bought using retail money, and they will try to squeeze every retail investor to sell at a loss and give up their assets, them pump it up hard to get retail to buy it back at a higher price. It's a game of patience for quality stocks. Not applicable for slot machines like GME"
"When pypl and sq, are 2 of your 4 largest holdings you enjoy your coffee this morning."
paypal still has ways to go. They just recently broke into the Chinese and Latin america market which should add substantial upside in revenue and earnings. The forward PE is way to low on a stock with this much market potential still. Its going to be the JP Morgan of electronic payments
thinking of loading some shares before the end of the day. ER will be good.
"If as Bloomberg is reporting that PayPal says this will not alter their guidance, why does it appear as though no one believes them?"
This EASILY cracks $300 within the next few months UNLESS a market correct occurs.Enjoy!!!
note that Q1 is always the slowest of the US eco. quarterly reports....so this is a pretty gd earnings report.
"I guess PYPL will beat the estimates 52 cents. I will let my far east estimates number on Jan 24, 10 minutes before the close. Now I see PYPL will have a good chance to hit 87, because it does not pull back along with the tech stock."
PAYPAL Can we get ONE day of a 2% rise that sticks.....SMH
20% higher coming imo. nice hold ..
Went up 2% in 30sek. 
"I am a small investor 200 shares @ $40.00 I also have bought shake shack, taser international over 134% earning? no one goes broke making a proffit fish are cut bait ( longbeard14)"
Brilliant! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo5GvdAaoM
"Its down today because of SQ, Earnings, and Trade Wars. It will bounce back"
We’re surging to 95 today
Looks like Harold shorted the stock or holds some put options. Also seems he's had about 2 pots of coffee already!
"Anyone who understands where the market has cooled down will make a profit.Good luck to all.There will be growth, but there will also be falls. At what height or depth the market will be determined by external factors.Traders need incentives, triggers. And the investor has time and patience and the ability to survive losses."
why selloffs prior close ?
over $309 by tomorrow as soon no more short shares available for those weak hands....that could have been shaken off the table.....
PYPL is buying its stock back to make eps look better.
thinking about shorting this at 3:59 this friday.
I am so short @ $177 and $308Haven’t covered one share
"Shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) tripled over the last three years, driven by increasing user engagement and the addition of more than 100 million new customers since separating from eBay in 2015."
Just found I can cash the check with PayPal app.....wow.
"All systems green.You are go to throttle up to 230.Rodger, throttling up to 230."
yep interested to see how this plays into earnings. should be a good quarter. we'll see.
"From a Canadian perspective, PayPal is everywhere here. Many apps incorporate them into it and even our own government does with our tax agency. I use them all the time for my eBay business. They are constantly #1 in the App Store for finance. Don’t underestimate PayPal."
$5B+ Free Cash Flow. All you need to know.
"Great earnings, great revenues, monster buyback.......whats not to like."
"Watching for a LOOOOONG OVERDUE surge to $220. If it doesn’t come in pre-market, it has to come after the CC earnings announcement."
Market selling off high p/e stocks that have benefited from the pandemic.
Almost guarantee 10-30% + return Average per year on this stock.
the future is a cashless society. stay long and strong PayPal for many years. mobile payments are on the rise.
Any ideas why PayPal seems to be on a plateau while Square keeps rising?
"Sorry about the volatility today guys. I started panic buying due to the investor day and Bitcoin going up. Just couldn't help myself, and there were NOT enough shares available to satisfy me. Then Bitcoin leveled off and I started getting ready for the long weekend instead of caring about the investor day anymore. I stopped the panic buying rather abruptly when my attention turned elsewhere (can my helicopter fly to my vacation cottage if there's a chance of snow?). I'll be back at it and panic buying again if Bitcoin shoots up to $55,000 all of a sudden, but unless that happens I'm just turning my trading over to the algorithms for now . . . It'll probably be pure momentum on Friday, with no panic buying disruptions from me (unless Bitcoin spikes enough to catch my attention) . . . Trade accordingly . .."
"PYPL has been good to me, picked up shares in '16"
"There is a very definable, reliable, and exciting uptrend line in place for 7 months now. The 50-Day Moving Average has been tracking along with it as well. This technical feature can very reliable and provide an idea of where support is and when sentiment changes. I've seen trends like this last for a long, long time. When you think about other ""disrupters"" like AMZN or other FANG stocks, they were once below 100 as well, and look at them now. It is entirely possible that PYPL could reach several hundred or even higher in the next few years. Selling here would be very foolish. If the stock is over 200 in 2019, wouldn't 76 look cheap? Or over 300 in 2020, even 100+ would look cheap. This one should be held and added too on any pullbacks. I'm hoping the uptrend remains intact and provides smart money the type of confidence needed to keep adding to their positions."
but up 20 today so making money today in after hours!! that's the way the market works!!
Another positive to pull out from this slump is that acquisitions Paypal is eyeing are looking greater and greater value !
guys paypal or square?
Any good explanation on why Paypal is so undervalued relative to Square?
Figured the stock would sell off after earnings. Although they raised yearly guidance they fell fractionally short on revenue next quarter.......that was the fly in the ointment. Let the sellers sell and then jump back in. The sell off is overdone
If we get an overall bullish day (futures already indicating a green day tomorrow) then this things is gonna fly past 83 easy.Keep an eye on PM tomorrow
"I bought at $84. Slowly, will get back to 85+. Give her time boys..... give her time."
Run Forest...run!!!
Honest opinion should I sell or buy more before earnings?
Take me to the moon
I've never even heard of Ayden and expect 95% of Americans haven't either
"I think I will buy more PYPL shares today, what do you all think."
Another breakout
Bitcoin $63k time to rocket baby
All the market is fallingSelling gain from yesterday
"Now the question is buy more right away, or wait and see what happens?"

Better hope 108.26 holds today...rsi way down buyers not feeling too bullish at these prices....
Already recovering!
Yikes
Big day tomorrow for Q3 report. All telling on the projected slow down issued in Q2. We will see what happens. I am holding until the results come out...hoping they are good enough to float the stock up.
SQ is cooler
MercadoLibre results are VERY IMPRESSIVE. I calculate t Paypal has gained another 8-10 cents a share just from the recent rise of the Mercado stock price. Wow!
this is only 2% gain today. while all the others are 4% or more...
SO GLAD I BOUGHT MORE SHARES ON YEST.'S DIP! Cheers to all the PYPL longs!
Megalomaniacs Anonymous was founded to look after people just like j.michael1998 and StockGuru
"PayPal is for investors, Square is for traders."
I was kicking myself for taking my profit and selling NVDA in the $70s. I have a nice slug of PYPL from the spin off with EBAY and purchases from last year. Not going to make the same mistake twice and hold this one for the duration. Happy to see a CEO who is smart enough to play the long game with Venmo. This stock is a Golden Goose. BUY in now and more on the dips.
Square is getting hammered and pypl is hanging tough for the day.
"I couldn't believe I missed the PayPal play...it was so obvious...Until I studied the fundamentals, long-term strategy and growth perspectives...This firm has the potential to become among the largest if not the largest business entity in drastically volatile conditions with highly pronounced systemic risk. Ultra bulish!"
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Rumored to be in Talks to Acquire PayPalDetails:https://theheadlinereporter.com/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-paypal/
I am getting extremely nauseous with all of PYPLs gyration. WTHell is wrong with the stock market?!
I won't recommend selling Paypal before investors day on 11 February. They will announce big surprises.
Hope those who bought at 82-ish in March are happy. Way to go!
PYPL always runs up before earnings. July 24
Interesting. Looks like an entire head and shoulders pattern formed and completed during a single trading session today. Should be upside from here.
$TSNPReverse split 4:1 means you get 1 share for every 4So if you have 400 shares at $1 you get 100 shares at $4It does nothing to change the value of the stock.It also means a quicker uplist to #NASDAQ This means it will hit $PYPL prices inside of 2 years.
Interesting!!!! Ways to use publicly traded instruments to get exposure to #Bitcoin and #digitalassets #cryptoEquities with leverage to $BTC$SI$MOGO$MSTR$PYPL$SQ$BRPHF$TSLA
I'm new to PYPL. Why is this down after hours after what appears to be a very good earnings report?
One of the reasons I like PYPL is the 23 percent growth rate projected out over the next 5 years. I will give a hard bite at 20 percent or greater. The fact PYPL has a market cap this size and still growing over 20 percent makes me bullish on its future.
Anyone who didnt add shares at the $228 dip last week
PayPal becomes the first foreign payment platform to be licensed to provide online payment services in China.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3502666-paypal-enters-china
$PYPL Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 285 » USD 290
This is a buy on dips and hold stock. Today is a great time to buy more shares.
Caution.PYPL will drop to $240 or more before ER.
Watch out PayPal here comes HMBL. PayPal will have a market crash soon. HMBL will take over . To many catalysts of things they can do that PayPal can’t. Word is spreading and big investors are taking interest in HMBL.
PYPL will not see the drop in payments that V saw. V has lost virtually all in-person transactions due to shutdowns. PYPL has 0 exposure to shutdowns. all payments are virtual
Why are we all getting another series of Warren Buffett and his massive war chest articles making the rounds again? Why do I have this feeling that Buffett is seriously looking to add a large position in Paypal?
PayPal is not messing around. Good business fundamentals. Good leadership. Good strategic acquisitions. Good values. And most of all Good timing. PayPal is now a need to have and not a nice to have. Welcome to the safe haven of stocks for the next several years. We’ll see some dips Here and there but this baby will continue to move higher.
I fly on Cebu Pacific a lot and was given the option of paying with PayPal for the first time. That sure was nice. Good sign too.
Instant transfer-to-bank feature will increase small business users as well as person-person usage. Another step in the right direction for PYPL!
My $5500 IRA contribution goes to 74 shares of $Paypal.
Time to thank PayPal for their services and sell out and move your money to $HMBL
Yet another all time high. Well done Danny Boy!
"No more Ebay but better option I have, which is Amazon."
"Both Shulman and Rainey came out and bat again. I like Daniel""s body language and what he signals that mass mobile payment is over 50%, which PYPL has a big lead in this field. Venmo starts to work for the money since Sept, so It will see some good number. Far East estimate will come in at Jan 30, 10 min. before close."
I had 263 shares #$%$ bought another 137@$77.
"Anyone know what’s pushing PayPal down? It started day up then around 10:15 started dropping,. Any news?"
"Paypal's new users '30% more engaged' than others, CEO sayshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3578513-paypals-new-users-30-engaged-others-ceo-says?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=ma-pypl-paypal-s-new-users-30-more-engaged-than-others-ceo-says&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3"
Another $10.00 and I'm back in the saddle again...
I sold large portion when they announced they will leave Ebay @$around $80. I just start buy back some in the last couple days. If I am right I think PYPL will be future bank. I am betting on it. wish me luck.
Anybody know what time investor day and extended forecast coming today?
Note that Paypal also operate in Europe where there is lock downs
Up today over $10 USD per share in German trading (Berlin).
we were down more than 9$/day... and cant even go up 9$... slow trending up...
I believe we can see $215 this week!
$10B buyback announced
If Paypal beats expectation and provide a nice Q1 guidance on Bitcoins then we can expect a huge surge.
Anyone else since $36?
What a beast ! Back to $90s in no time.
waiting for dip to add more in at 250.
I think indicators are showing the turn back up is really close. Tomorrow or Monday.
"PayPal closed green in Europe, let's go USA, don't let us down, I am buying as mich as I can, will hold forever"
"“The potential market size and growth opportunity for Paypal is mind-boggling. After taking the China market and Amazon’s share of the global market out of the picture, KeyBanc estimates that Paypal can capture about two-thirds of all incremental global e-commerce dollars.” "
$300 by January 2021
How y'all feeling about the Honey acquisition? $4B is a lot of dough. Seems like they're trying to catch Square.
"Acquisition is coming....Square , Stripe?????"
did someone leak earnings?
PayPal reached an all time high at 246.70
"Everyone, I am just as worried as you. Which is why when I bought I did so with not so much money so I can double down on dips. NOW is the time to double down. Perfect example is SQ... down 29% then up 35% in 3 months. PYPL will recover + but might take 1-2 months."
PYPL employees leaking out upcoming earnings estimates which should promptthe stock to inch up to the $300's during the next month.
Looks like strong support is going to be around 73ish
what are the price targets for PayPal?
PayPal reached an all time high at 252.88
"Folks time to buy, now need to compete with the supposedly kicking-in buyback program and big boys, Jesus."
"And with the games with the gme amc and BB. Come on, that will be short lived. Ultimately, people will gravitate back to value, earnings and reality.Or true companies. Not burning low life short sellers cashing in on weak, or close to bankrupt companies.Buy $T Buy $NIO BUY $PHAnd consider $PYPL $BABAThere are gems out there. The phenomenon with attacking low life short sellers will not end well for both sides.Stay safe, financially and health wise.Cheers!"
275 is not enough.Buy Buy Buy now
PayPal rocks
Per CCPayPal Transaction Volume from Ebay currently stands at 13% of total volumeWas 19% 30 months ago when the 2 companies splitExpect to be around 4% when the operating agreement (OA) between the 2 companies expires in 30 months (sometime in 2020)Ebay is constrained to give NOT more than 5% of their transaction volume to Ayden (MOR) for any 2 countries they chooseand 10% of their transaction volume an year from now up to the end of the OA (mid 2020)No medium term impact due to the change and any minimal impact has already been modeled in their outlookIMO the sell off is way overdue and could be a good buying oppty
Looking like a cup and handle formation in the making.
Most likely people taking profits. Look at the higher than normal volume.
Anybody buying PYPL today?
"New 52 week high coming any time now, GLTA."
Good time to add more PYPL shares. This stock is going higher
Any idea why SQ price acting like what PYPL should be doing (up over $1.2x now) and PYPL (down .43) acting like what SQ price should be doing? ..
PayPal gonna have some movement in the next week or so as they usually do after earnings 
Check earnings trajectary....PYPL will close over 106 on Friday....huge winner in the payment space.Buy anything under 104.
"so it's like Monday never happened, what a discount sale that was"
NOW DOWN 27 CENTS AH. IM FREAKING OUT!
"So what? Nobody buys stuff on eBay anyway. Totally overreaction, i.e. an opportunity to load PYPL."
Wonderful stock PYPL. Any guesses where the stock would be at around Dec 2020?
what a shakedown cruise.
Start the countdown........... No sleep till Earnings!
"This is so crazy! I almost sold my whole position around 60, but held on to 50 shares. So happy I did!  PYPL and SQ are my top performers."
"Cramer did a 1 on 1 with the CEO of Olo, of which PYPL is a major investor in."
Very bullish on PYPL. Own as cheap as $42 a share when it split off from ebay. My most recent buy was on the Coronavirus dip at $90 a share. Sitting pretty at both buys and this company is the future of business transactions along with Square.
Still undervalued......
I think I’m gonna trim some SQ and pick up PYPL.
At what time?
Even if the earnings are great no way can SQ come back in the green after tomorrow
What do people think of PayPal and its share price? Who are long? Who are short?
$75 check. Roll on $76!
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PURCHASE ONLINE USING PAYPAL THROUGH THESE SEVERAL HOLIDAY SEASONS TO AVOID COLD WEATHER OUTDOOR...FROM BIG COMMING UP STIMULUS CHECK FROM DEMOCRAT PARTY....
how much can you believe in stock market in those days? earnings up to sky and stock dipped down.
"$BTC price drop is the tipping point for all the tech stocks to fall including $TSLA.$BTC is currently trading at $48,900 not $64,000 a week ago.Dogecoin? $0.21 dropped from $0.48"
Avoid the crypto PayPal platform is high spreads
"How much exposure does PYPL have to Bitcoin. It is vunerable to Cyberwars and no one even knows who invented it. It could the USSR, CCP or North Korea waiting to cash in on western cash. It is a huge venerability. How do the preppers cash in the bitcoin during an apocalypse?"
"Look at PYPL's history.In the last 2 years - Large dips / drops 18%11%12% 6%7%Now it is at 8%.It ""Can"" drop another 10% which IMO highly unlikely but even if does, PYPL will still be up 30% for the last year. It is currently up 40% for the last year."
yes paypal come back down so we can be one again. i'll never leave you again
"In February, it rose to $ 300. This is an annual forecast. Has grown since the end of last year on expectations.This year is a test of expectations and reality.Why do you think that it should cost 300, 250?As it seems to me, the optimal price is 190-200. It matches the real market."
Time for PayPal to reveal regular growth now
"TSNP has a $110 Valuation by January 2021 by 2 private investment firms that I know of, so hang on to your seats. $AMZN $BABA $PYPL"
"Ive been wondering why PYPL was creeping up the past 2 weeks. Finally got crypto access, thats the main reason I bought in a few years ago. PYPL was the only company with any interest in it at all."
"Have you seen how easy it is to buy crypto now on PYPL, Bitcoin or Ethereum it's a 1 click deal. No more wallets or keys to lose. EZ for payments and investors and PYPL= WE get the 3% fee."
Remember ebay only accounts for a small portion of their transactions. Only 13% and its getting less and less. Also the deal isn't over until a few years later.This also frees up paypal to make a deal with amazon or alibaba!
Imagine how many commissions Paypal has made is these few days from crypto..... Which is good for Paypal
"Look like the tax bill passes, The financial sector will get big benefit from the bill. PYPL will get carry by the tailwind next year. It is a big fortune, PYPL will be 100 by second quarter."
"Producer inflation spoiled the rebound.There is no liquidity in the tech sector. This prevents recovery up to 260 and above.I think that closer to the July report, everything will start to improve.If employment and inflation don't spoil the situation"
will go back to 270 in a couple hours no worries just some sell off
"Our economy is being TRANSFORMED right as we speak folks! Major changes are occurring such as 5G, cashless society’s, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, AI, etc. It’s STILL EARLY DAYS. In a decade PayPal, MasterCard, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and those others who help to build these networks will be worth so much more money. That’s why my money is in names like APPLE, MICROSOFT, MASTERCARD, PAYPAL, etc."
This is going above 200 today after earning ....buying here is gift for day traders
year end $120 should be reachable for paypal
"i really enjoy picking cherry this morning, the market overall is still positive for the next two weeks. Money flows in the financial sector, RSI for PYPL is not overbought. The big boys suppress PYPL so they can get more shares with lower price. Yesterday price is like overheat, but not. PYPL should move up to 84-85 by next Friday."
"The pandemic is over. I'm not complaining, but I'm not sure how PYPL can increase guidance when everyone heads back to the malls, and the competition becomes headwinds for PayPal. I was thinking of going long, but I'll wait to see if the gap is faded tomorrow."
just read that paypal is expecting lower growth next quarter...from 41 percent to 20-25 percent. that's why it's selling off
"Bouncing back.....PYPL CEO: surge in April demand numbers were good, trend is accelerated"
Anyone listen to me last night to sell PayPUKE  $260 short $260 and at the $256 open buy the weekly 250 put options expiring tomorrow for pennies now $5 up 1000%????
BUY MORE EVERYONE....THE TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION WITH HIGH UPTREND AHEAD DUE TO BREAKING NEWS YESTERDAY WITH PYPL IS A BUY AND UP HIGHER EVEN TODAY....
iam long on this one
bubble stock..Old company. late to the crypto game. newer and better out there. sell the news either way
"It’s a long term hold for me until at least at $300 (within 2-3 years is my guess), so I WILL be adding shares tomorrow if the market insists on temporarily keeping the pps down a few bucks. I have absolutely no problem with their guidance."
Taking out the all time high today. PYPL continues to be on the move. Right stock at the right time. Don’t overthink this one. Just enjoy the ride. $$$$$
everything is okay guys and gals
I think it will hit back to 114 by Friday.
It looks like $PYPL Paypal management is determined to transfer all Paypal cash into their pockets via Bitcoin Scam... A good method to rob the Corporation and investors! Paypal is buying Bitcoin because Paypal management and their relatives are holding thousands of bitcoins and they want to get quick rich!
Have a good thanksgiving gang. We move to $100 very soon
Seems like everyone is pumping this stock lately
$300 today?
Monster company Being trading in and out Since $55 should have just kept it Waiting for pull back mi think this could go over $100
Pypl doesn’t need eBay after 2020
The shorts seem to have a temporary period of control because of profit taking. They were spreading gloom and doom after the last quarters stellar earnings and trying to misstate facts about the company then. They will get crushed again as the quarter continues. There is no reason to believe that anything has changed fundamentally.
I reckon when Square gets down to $25 Schulman ought to pick it up as PayPal’s next acquisition
Nothing seems to be hotter than Fintech right now. Between PYPL and SQ they have 'all systems go'
Red... Green...Red...
another chance for people to buy into paypal
friday sell off
"This is some of the analysts and mutual funds punishing Paypal. Why? The enormous cash horde that the company has. Free cash flow just keeps coming in each quarter. There is no current acquisition plans and the money just sits underutilized. Managaement is very quiet on the stock buyback plan and the lack of any type of dividend (quarterly, ""Special"") stops other mutual funds from investing. No way around it Paypal is being ""spanked"" for being too cash heavy!"
Fantasy football + 1% instant transfer fee = blowout numbers
Any interesting information from the analyst event?
All time high yet again. Just keeps on rolling.........Roll on to $125 next
"Honey deal to me is a possibility for PayPal to upend Amazon's dominant position in e-commerce. Amazon extend its offer from online shopping go-to site to AmazonPay, and PayPal with Honey has the potential to extend reversely from payment to online shopping's go to app on your phone. The market does not understand this yet I thinks."
"“PayPal had another excellent quarter. New partnerships with American Express and Walmart will increase the value that we can offer to our customers. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to aggressively invest in innovation and growth, creating sustainable and long-term value for our shareholders,”"
sold 75% of my position today and took my profit! left a small piece in just in case we break resistance but I think this thing is going down down down all next week. Take your money while you can and buy back in before the earnings for even more profit!
Need a little bit of advice. PYPL or SQ? I am very bullish on the whole sector so I love both but at current valuations and expected future developments I am leaning towards PYPL. When PYPL rolls out crypto will you be able to pay people with it? Like can I pay my friend in crypto? - any info is much appreciated
Buy the dipDon't panic and hold on
Ladies & Germs  The after hours crash  is almost here! Anyone excited???
Should i buy the dip?
"PYPL should be up, at the rate things are going with Covid, we'll all be home more ordering things on line and paying with Pay Pal or some other on line payment."
PYPL is Bullish.
"PYPL is on escape velocity. More consistent beats from now on is possible as the business is coming into its own, making giving guidance more accurate"
"PayPal just mentioned, on the halftime report, as a stock to buy-on the way up!"
great quarter. a 4percent dip is nothing compared to my crypto losses this week.
Im a 20 year old college student waking up and making $300+ off of trading stocks. I wish I knew about this in high school. PYPL was a big winner for me today!
I believe even at these levels PYPL trades at a steep discount to its future potential value. Given the growth we have seen in SQ I would expect PYPL to catch up eventually. Plus PYPL is sustainable even after the vaccines are completely rolled out. It is both a reopening play and a COVID play. I fully expect this to trade above $300 by the midpoint of this year.
"guys what advantage does PayPal have over sq? like I'm invested in this company but I'm in this for the long run,"
I just bought 300 shares at $156.48
eBay is going to start using another payment processor Ayden. PayPal canstill me used by members but the transactions will take place off of eBay's site.The huge drop in PayPal's stock doesn't make sense to me. Obviously PayPal knewthis was going to happen and they have already factored this change into their earningsguidance. Once again an overreaction by traders. Take advantage and buy the stock at these levels.Easy money. I bet this trades back into the 80's tomorrow.
Come on $85 after hour . Volume is good after hour
Nasdaq going up againBuy buy buy
"I still confirm that FB, ADBE and PYPL are the stocks that will hit new high and BREAK OUT."
Believe after we finish consolidating in the high $70's we will dash to the mid to upper $80's in short order and consolidate for the run to $100.
"$FINV consolidating nicely for the next run. Its PE ratio for a Fintech is insanely undervalued... only 8.17x PE ratio. Comparing against other Chinese Fintech... $TIGR PE ratio is 437x, $FUTU is 182x.Comparing against US Fintech... $PYPL is 91x, most other fintech are losing money... so there isn’t even a PE ratio This is going to $20!"
I think PYPL will report $1.09 in earnings. Whats your thoughts
A Pantera Capital report on Dec. 23 said PayPal was absorbing 100% of all newly mined Bitcoin supply
"If you bought shares after hours yesterday, you’re smart. If you buy shares right now, you’re still smart."
"This morning’s wisdom. Take it with however many grains of salt you wish. This is a classic macro head fake or good old shake out. Ok, sell. And buy what.Are you kidding me.

Look back in a month.I added this morning and will add more if need be, and have added also to some other stocks on my shopping list. Have a great day all!"
"Short-term money will sell due to lack of classic ""beat and raise"", despite the fact that everything fundamentally is still on trackBuy the dip"
309 to 250 PayPal is R.I.P. I won’t ever use the service again just dropped the app and closed account
"Is Paypal expensive now? Yes, it certainly is. But we still don't know how much Paypal has made from crypto in Q1. I believe revenue is huge. Not to mention that Square only make money in crypto from Bitcoin while Paypal also has Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. There is still QR-payment when we get to normal I believe alot of stores will implement QR-payment."

New to this stock. Why down so much today???
I think its time to buy more PYPL
looks like the earnings are going to be crazy good. I am super long since the $60sHoping for a great $30 run after hours.
Ethereum blowing the doors off today. PYPL gonna do the same.
AS a long time shareholder this impressive growth in venmobis exactly what I wanted to see (actually better than I hoped)https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-ceo-venmo-users-are-clamoring-to-do-more-than-just-send-money-2019-04-24?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
PayPal needs to buy Square NOW for at least $50 per share or soon Square will grow so big so fast it will end up buying PayPal instead.
WMN 24/09/2020: Deutsche Bank reiterates PayPal a Buy with a $234 price target.I suspect there will be a slew more “reiterates” coming in; not much more one can do it improve on a Strong Buy recommendation at this ‘gift horse” level!
PayPal set for some good jump today
This is a very healthy pullback. Big money is shaking out weak hands. BOTTOM LINE: PayPal is going to make a big movement into India which offers upwards of 750 million new PayPal users. It is also very beneficial that India wants to demonetize.
"This one doesn't bother me, even below $200 as it has typhoon-like tailwinds behind it.It's V that is worries me, seems to be stuck in quagmire."
"With a $ 124 price target, and this encouraging 3 QE results, PYPL should hopefully cross $ 105.00 tomorrow. Holding long for my retirement years. GLTA."

Bull market back or what
Bitcoin came back UP!PYPL GOING UP!!!!
March starts again.. lets beat the all time high :)
What ...SQ down ... PYPL up? What?....This should not happen. PYPL to $95.00 July 27th
$150 billion in Total payment volume this quarter setting a record for the company. Venmo on track to have a TPV of over $100 billion by the end of 2019.
I expect another earnings beat. Analysts have set the bar vey low and they had a big beat last qtr. There deal with Uber will help and not spending money on Facebook's cryptocurrency will also help.
(http://sharelabs.xyz) just alerted me to an awesome runner before the bell.
"Nasdak, the U-turn has startedBought at 239.7, the first target was 243."
"Hurry up, buy it before it reverses."
"Wow, great ER. Too bad market is confused, this should be up 10%+ right now."
ATH
BREAKOUT out of long term resistance. Should be clear sailing to 110 - 120.
Yes finally PayPal doing something
Whats your guess on earnings this wednesday. I think $.81 and a earnings upgrade.
thank you pypl buyers. amazing work.
"pypl has been a great trading vehicle,having failed to break out during this rally but running up a lot ,I bet traders take this down to 110 or so before it breaks out likely this summer, if we do break 122 now likely we hit 130 before the fall back"
Why are people doubting PayPal? This baby is going to the moon (or at least $200)!
"If you are long Hold Current position. If Stock closes below 105.05 A change in trend will be confirmed, it is under distribution, bearish condition,PYPL could find secondary support at rising 200 day average price of 93.34 .I will be Buying ! Great Article in Barron's this past week Great  Company  No worries  Profit Taking in this Market ....Be smart...."
"CNBC report that lot of $88 put traded . Their money will be gone . This set of earning release , tomorrow won’t be at $88 . Try $100"
Paypal set to declare a dividend for the first time. Shares will explode overnight.
"PayPal and Square could be this decade’s high flying tech winners, according to Credit Suisse.The firm released its projections for the “next generation of potential winners” in technology, and finance technology companies PayPal and Square top the list.All of the companies on the list have a market cap between $1 billion and $100 billion, have cash-flow return on investment that is greater than their cost of capital and show early signs of improving cash-flow returns. The technology companies need to be reinvesting their cash at “decent rates” and demonstrate earnings growth, Credit Suisse HOLT technology sector specialist John Talbott said in a note to clients on Tuesday."
Oppenheimer upgrades PayPal price target to 100.00
"This is an obvious bargain opportunity. PayPal is tremendously successful and will continue its excellent growth pattern for many years to come...no small part due to its high trust factor.In the meantime, it remains a payment option with eBay and 2023 is a LONG way off. Plenty of time for many other new relationships to be made to offset eBay.We own PYPL in two retirement Roths and I’ve now just bought a fun 100 shares in my trading account. We are retired, in our mid-60s, and have had a very solid long term return in our investments over the years.No doubt in my mind about PayPal."
"It was 3 years ago that I thought very hard whether to make AMZN or PYPL my core holding.Analysts were all 100% for AMZN. I did the alternative, bizzarrely somehow. Today I'm satisfied.AMZN diehards must have been one frustrated furious lot for the last 12 months."
"To ALL PYPL shareholders. I bought PYPL back when it was $70 a share. I was doing great until the sell off in DECEMBER and I got scared and sold. I REGRET doing so. I bought back in at $83 a share. I will for SURE hold, even if dips 5-10%. PYPL has never disappointed me. I was wrong to have sold fast, noob mistake, rookie error. I learned from my mistakes and can not wait until I see +25-50% on my list. And also add more if able too!"
There’s no better and safer choice in overall market. Best to hold before Q2 Earnings. 200$ sooner or later!
230 coming
Maintain support buy more and hang on PYPL will be a big winner $200 this time next year no doubt
"Wish i bought more at 183.50, but i was expecting it to dip in the 170's for our dear friend Kevin."
"I posted three times already since I got back in PYPL at $84 I first got in at $70. I made HUGE mistake of selling in December when all stocks dropped 5-10%. I got back in and dropped again. THIS TIME I am staying long.PYPL easy money. Stay long you WILL be happy. Next small drop, I will be doubling down."
"2 key events in the coming period that can boost Paypal stock:1. Investors day.2. Announcement of buying, selling and holding crypto in another countries."
"Check Tipranks, where all the 'experts' post their expectations about stocks. They give PayPal an 310$ price target based on 37 analists"
Maybe the best positioned stock going forward. All Longs you haven’t seen nothing yet. Big Fund money moving into PayPal. I love owning stocks like this at the beginning of a major move upwards. Enjoy amigos! $$$
"just added, nice to still have cash on the sidelines on days like this"
good buying opportunity
I don't know what the market makers try to do with PYPL. It should be 80 this morning. The premium for call 80 and 80.5 is way too high. They may be scare that PYPL may surge up at the close. I suspect that PYPL will hit 80 at the close today.
Why did PayPal share price just dip?
PayPal isn't even a payment option on amazon!
As for share buybacks..... drop that hot mess and start dividends instead. The buybacks should have started immediately and had ALL of the buyback done when it was first announced. Now shares are too high and it would do better for all to start dividends. Why dividends? Then Paypal shares can be purchased by the many dividend funds!
"Thank you $PYPL for growth, loading in $ODP for a rocket someone bought a $14M worth of stock, is a buyout coming?"
Oh my...ATH
Have the fundamentals changed? No. Have the price targets decreased? No. Is the growth over for this company? No. Buying opportunity.
Look at PYPL rally!!! The stimulus checks are causing more credit card spending!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"#PYPL RSI and Stochastic oscillator are triggering bullish signal, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 83.87."
"All in good time, it will bounce back. Take a deep breath gang :)"
Got in a month ago and already up 15%
"Q4s have been golden for PayPal for YEARS. Today, we'll close around the 84.70 mark and when the earnings are announced (and they will be good), we'll pop about 6-8% after hours. Tomorrow (Thursday) we'll crack 89.00, perhaps 90.00 before settling back to a close around $87.50$200 by end of year. No. $125-$130 by EOY, yeah, I can see that easily."

"Owning PayPal is like, oh well you know sweeeet"
Thumbs up if you think PYPL will close green today!
"As can be seen the last dip was a buying opportunity, nothing structurally went wrong with this stock. This may breakout of the 80.00 dollar range this week as it's momentum is building."
We will reach $93 by Friday after ER
"No one may remember but folks don't forget about MercadoLibre. Over $1,000 a share. PayPal has more than a 100% return from original investment!"
PayPal reached an all time high at 214.60
PYPL’s monster quarter should be a cue for investors to also load up on SQ prior to their earnings as the results are likely to be quite similar. Have made multibaggers in both names since March.
I don’t know why the articles keep mention only venmo and zelle. Do they know that we also have square cash P to P transfers? I want to know how square cash compares to these two services
#PYPL Looking good for higher prices. Long over 92.35. Target: 107.86 at stoxline.
"Yet another reason PayPal; may become a potential takeover candidate.... the announcement that PayPal is now the first foreign corporation licensed to process payments in China. Why a takeover possibility? 1. Share prices artifically (IMHO) depressed. 2. Easier for the likes of Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, to acquire PayPal and its ""foot in the door"" in China than to continuosly bang their heads trying to acquire their own license. 3. Less glamorous but best reason - Paypal's fundamentals and continued growth."
Firework by the time of earnings. I guess it is about 82-85.
"All of my friends and family using more and more venmo, I like where this is going"
Just one more reason why PYPL bears are so delusional. Free cash flow margins are 23.8 percent. Go home shorts.
Anyone know when PayPal will start monetizing Venmo?
Over sold!!
"Bought some PYPL today. I am going to stop over analyzing, and just buy some after a big drop. Better to be lucky than smart."
"Where's all those ""$70 tomorrow"" comments now?"
"The nearest support line is at 220, resistance is at 258.We go below 220, a straight road at 200 and 180.The 258 are unlikely to do so this year.Hold on) who didn't have time to get outI'll be glad if I'm wrong, but I'm sad"
"Quite a ride today, good time to add to position earlier..."
"Dang, Bought PYPL at $39 and $49. Wish I had bought more."
Expecting more analyst upgrades striking near the 250 level in coming 90 days. Performace should continue to accelerate well in to next year. 212 by Friday looking highly probable.
Amazing quarter - raising guidance. Absolutely worth buying on any dips and I will do so promptly tomorrow
This reminds me of Visa yesterday.
So far so good!!!! Let's keep this up.
Don't listen to trolls. Pypl is expanding. Earth overall more people. More people = more users. I was here from worse. When pypl and ebay ended relationship. This is nothing. Try almost 15% in 1 day. But as always. What happened after? $70-$120. Pypl may sit now for a year or two before the next large run up. $160-200 by 2021-$2022. Realistic numbers.
So how does PayPal insure bitcoin in a Cyber war?
PYPL gonna beat tomorrow but you have all Q1 to accumulate. They didn’t charge any fees to buy BTC or ETH in Q4... but the heavy buying of crypto now will mean tons of fees in Q1 and a huge profit on next earnings. Just my educated guess as user and shareholder.
lol 5 years for paypal to grow and make more and more partnerships. think about that before you sell. five. years.3 months until next earnings. calm down guys
Strong Buy under $200
Is PayPal a bank too? Like sq?
"HUGE buying opportunity. This stock will be back to $200 and over soon. 10x better than Square. Digital payments are the future and the future is now. Throw in some Covid, and it's accelerated for these kind of payments. Older generation will learn and as years go, it will be all digital and venmo etc."
Just shorted. Thanks for the runup. Low risk/high return. You guys are the best-SMOOCH.
"PayPal fam, sold all my stocks on robinhood and going to transfer to gdax and invest in cryptos. glta"
"this AHs pop is helpful. Wasnt there for AAPL or AMZN when they reported ER, so this is nice to see."
"Great Friday morning so far, coming up on a year owning this next month and very happy with my gains."
Jesus christ what happened such a good ER and its down
"When I bought PYPL over 2 years ago. One of the MAIN reasons why I did was because in the state of a possible market correction or recession, PYPL is one of those stocks that will hold its grounds good.Sure, it doesn't ""FLY"" as much as SQ and others, but look at the last year's performance. PYPL is UP! compared to many such as NETFLIX, APPLE, SQ, you name it, that are DOWN. LONG PYPL here. Im talking 10-20 years long."
"Whatever you guys said how exciting it is now, l only think that it’s opportunity to sell when any news causes it goes up. Time will tell that I’m right."
211...221...246... Happy New Year
This is a good opportunity to buy the dip ( I did ) The Pay Pal process will benefit in a big way as it will support the legalization of Sports gambling.. The strong growth of internet sales will continue to grow the company as well.
"I am PYPL Long, but this is getting harsh. Compared to MA, VISA and SQ, Pypl is lagging behind. It is in last place for YTD, 6 months. and in 3rd for 1 year. Not a good sign, but I will hold on to my shares for time being."
"Had no idea why PYPL is falling in corellation to bitcoin, when they don't invest in it but just get a comission which can be even higher if bitcoin falls due to the increased demand. Oversold imo."
"if they incorporate Honey in their main payment platform, that would mean that buying stuff with PayPal will work out to be cheaper than any other payment service. that would be a big game changer!"
V beats and is up nicely. I expect PYPL will beat nicely on 5/5
"Hang on to your shorts, total electronic trading goes in to effect on the NYSE Monday. This is going to be a very wild ride for some time. I could make more money playing slots!"
Twitter’s Dorsey subpoenaed over censorship. Sell SQ. buy PYPL.

It’s happening. Used to be slow but now it’s getting up to the speed. Way to go!
Probably a buying opportunity for those wanting to hold long on PYPL. Nothing inherently wrong with this company just topped a bit and the dynamics of the September pre-election environment.
"How many are also trading KTPPF? Founding CFO of Paypal involved there... some financial company, seems to just keep going up $$$"
"When the multi billion dollar sale of Paypal’s finance portfolio from earlier in the year to Synchrony Financial completes settlement in a couple of months, watch Paypal pounce with another huge strategic acquisition! Also when Paypal puts iZettle to the metal on its settlement, it’s number one position will be rock solid! Buy in now good people while the strategic manoeuvring is underway, or watch from the sidelines while we head to $100 a share and beyond by year’s end !"
Pay pal is a gem
PYPL just mentioned on CNBC as “going higher”.
"$80 is a good start, I'm looking for $88....."
PayPUKE  only down 33% this past week not too shabby
Venmo alone makes me confident these guys open up 15 points higher tomorrow
WHEN BIG HEDGE FUNDS START BUYING ...THE MARKET LOOKS EXTREMELY DIFFERENTLY...UPTREND THIS TIME...
Longtime value investor Bill Miller told CNBC today he believes bitcoin is firmly entering into the mainstream. This is great news for PYPL as bitcoin becomes a bigger part of Paypal's forward looking strategy. PYPL will go up together with bitcoin. The potential for PYPL is huge! Buy more while you can at this attractive level!
As much as I love to see this stock grow everyday I am debating selling. Anyone have an opinion on selling? PayPal always seems to go up before their earnings release and drop after.
I’m long PYPL for 3 years but this is NOT setting up to be a good earnings. Prospective longs should wait to buy this dip. Don’t see an earnings pop at all.
PayPal will go back into beast mode real soon.
"those who cashed out of gme and amc with their ill gotten wins will be shopping for safe, logical investments..."
"Price target of $127 is looking to be a struggle, although any forward gain is welcome. Still too much side lined money waiting for the worse to come. Fortunately, I think we have seen the worse in this sector. There will be a pop in PayPal and no one will have seen it coming..."
Bpught some more today Price Target $125
pypl is still going to be an option at EBAY checkout ... i highly doubt people will change to a foreign company with CC information
Really???!!!? SQ is already green plus some.......this #$%$ fighting not to go down further nevermind going green
What happens when everyone has Honey on their devise? I'm thinking coupons then become useless and would go away. The whole reason for coupons is to capture sales you would normally miss.
That’s what happens when your doing so well they set the bar super high. We met and still drops absolutely insane

The growth opportunities with Venmo is huge! Compare it to how Instagram provides growth for Facebook!
"When Venmo comes to the rescue! it might be too late for the weak handed! so load up on this dip. 200 by the end of the year! or as someone told to me, how about a split! why not, we're all dreamers too!"
"Got another example this week of corruption in our government, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, Hillary lies to the FBI on her servers, she deletes 33,000 emails after she receives a subpoena, a State department senior offical tries to bribe the FBI to declassify some of Hillary's emails, her IT staff takes the 5th amendment rather than tesitfy to Congress on erasing the servers, the pay for play Clinton Foundation, the rigged Deomcratic primaries, and now the FBI has reopened the email investigation. It just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens. Why hasn't the Press called this out?FYI, the reason Hillary wants open borders is that aliens typically vote Democratic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PK-SK0h9o"
"While earnings will be important, don't forget that a potential major boost could come next week at PYPL's 'Analyst Day'. Depending on their 3/5 year forecast, and the language the leaders use, this could lead to serious price target increases (or not) and significant moves. I worked for PYPL for over 16 years and the one thing that concerns me is the reluctance of Meg, John, and now Dan to 'soften the excitement' despite the incredible track record. They need to come out bullish."
Wouldn’t be surprised if it ends green or only 1% or so down.
Uptrend resumed. Was oversold. Also appears to be rebounding stronger than anticipated.
Cashed out. Too many groups getting ready to short this heavy. GLTA 5 day 15 min way down at $145.98 not going to get caught holding the bag this time.
This is like Microsoft & Apple discussion in the 80’s. Both Square & PayPal great companies. Buy both...
buy buy buy. cryto×PayPal. PayPal will skyrocket 
Looks like a market reversal in progress. Let's hope it holds!
PYPL just named by Motely Fool as one of the 5 Best Stocks to buy right now.
"invest in Pypl, its buying up all its acquisitions to dominate the market, near term is a bit up and down. Pypl is not a trading stock like Sq is, this is a long term stock. PayPal will only dominate the market as time goes on, so just hold on"
@komol Do you work for UNH or have a vested interest in repeating this on the pypl comment board??
"All good news for PayPal and the stock drops, the deep state of the stock market at work again...."
Anyone listen and sell 260 and short 260? 255 now going red by 10am

Should add more at this price? I have few shares from last year and been buying before earnings?
"As I said. Channel 230-250 long ago.I'll try it, correct the loss by 272"
PayPal reached its highest close to date. The record intraday close of $302.05 should be surpassed as soon as the market digests all the exciting innovative news that was revealed in yesterday’s Investor Day delivery
incremental fees on bitcon. smart move but not one for consumers
how will bitcoin crash effect pypl ?I wonder how much they have bought and at what price ?
"paypal to discount rides using the uber app, I am sure they will increase customer acquisition on top of their growth opportunities.This will make customers download the app and remember PayPal through these tough times and make them download there app and increase customer interaction with there application.To LOCK their customers."

PAYPAL RAISED TO 135 AT BARCLAYS
Good morning and welcome to the beginning of a new high for PayPal stock over the next few weeks.Shorts like Big making me wealthier as they lose money on their Daddy's retirement account.There goes the family silver ahahahahaha 
"thank you market gods for yesterday, love discounted paypal shares"
Paypal will cross 100 before the next quarterly call.
"Sold at 144,5, I'll buy later"
"Up 4%, let's hope it keeps running tomorrow!!!"
This is turning into quite not a moving stock.
"IMO one difference between PYPL and, say, AAPL, AMZN, or MSFT is that institutional buyers are already loaded up on the big boys. Look at the top 10 holdings of most funds in the US and you're likely to find one of the those big three. PYPL is still a bit outside the box and off the radar a bit and IMO this is the reason we could see movement on positive earnings and ever-increasing institutional interest. Just IMO of course. Yours may vary."
Going up up up higher!
Started a position with a average of 248. Im happy
$100 in a couple weeks
"Guy Adami (CNBC) was saying he would buy in the low 80, hopefully his friends are buying too."
Analysts price targets will need to be raised. Could get some price targets to $150+
Just curious how there could possibly be a lawsuit against this company for lost value. I've owned it since the spin off and have more than doubled my equity. What exactly are these ambulance chasers complaining about!
"The deal with Synchrony...PayPal raised its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to between $3.64 billion and $3.70 billion. The company also increased its per share earnings guidance range to 52 cents-59 cents, from 37 cents-39 cents.Is this a one time thing (the sale which adds to profit) or will this be what we can expect each quarter moving forward?Serious answers only please."
Anyone expect this stock to reach $200 by the end of this year?
This isn’t going to be permanent for sure right?

"HUGE BARGAIN HUNTERS JUMPED IN AT LATE MINUTES TODAY AND MORE IN AFTER HOURS ....FOR A BIG REBOUND TOMORROW , LIKE LAST MONDAY.....AFTER FRIDAY 'S DIP LAST WEEK...."
"I thought about investing in Paypal a while ago, now after dealing with a buying some tools scam and dealing with Paypals help service, Iwouldn't touch them. What a piece of %$%@ company. Run around after run around. And as far as I know they run their customers money to this scam website and I found other on their community chat website that had run into the same website with Paypal name and payment system on it. Paypal didn't want to be bothered with it. I sent the same info to yahoo (because the ad that I clicked on was from Yahoo) they sent me an email saying Thank you and the website had been blocked. How can you trust a paypal (an internet security type company) that won't lift a finger for internet security?"
Great ER Dan. Well done. Lemmings selling on the news. Stock will be up mañana. Venmo numbers through the roof. EBay shortfall all news and one time event.
Sell $258Short $258Buy the 260 put options expiring tomorrow as much as you possibly can.Thank me profusely on Saturday
"I’ve owned PYPL since the split from EBAY several years ago. Cost basis is around $42 a share. To date my return on it is almost equal to my return on Square since March. I see people in the PayPal discussion bashing Square, and people in the Square discussion bashing PayPal. You shouldn’t pick and choose between the two, you should own both of them. Both can coexist and I use both Venmo and CashApp. These companies are the future of business payments even after COVID falls by the wayside. So stop the bashing and put your money to work. Owning two big money makers is better than one."
"If PYPL can break $112.64 then next resistance is $130.00.Buy,BUY,BUY"
"I've been buying paypal since it was $64 and adding along the way, even when bought at peak times this stock always rebounds in no time, this is better than pretty much any stock out there and I cant rationalize how anyone would sell this stock given it's track record, I will add some more to my position at bell opening."
we are good. move forward!
Expect to see it jump when market opens
I see 80+ by next week. Estimate earnings will be over 3.25 by next year. Am I right.
Bargain priceBuy today tomorrow green again
Paypal better come up with some good numbers and raised guidance. Payment and Cloud stocks are in a slump.
"hold strong, she will be in 100s in next month"
Bargain basement level prices here for PYPL. I guess you don’t want to get rich if you’re not buying here.
"This stock needs to escape $215 level, which it has tested multiple times starting in August. When it finally breaks out above $220, it will be a smooth ride to $300."
Amazon slashed their rates because retailers refuse to work with their biggest enemy...this discount won’t help and their payment platform will remain stagnant.
holy moly I thought I took an L but I guess not
Paypal is one of the biggest winners from stimulus that passed and any additional that should come.1) Paypal now allowing direct check deposits (including stimulus check deposits). Which will encourage more paypal (and venmo) signups and usage2) pair one with ability to buy and sell bitcoin3) people will use their newly deposited money to spend with the paypal and venmo accounts
Do you think PYPL stock has the potential to touch 200 by 2020 end?
“Venmo had a breakout third quarter with payment volume surging 78 percent to a total $17 billion.”

"For those of you who recently bought in the $270-$300 range please know that you will see that price again. Why. Because and despite the bellowings of the Bears on this board PayPal has proven its staying power. For example the bleating Bears point out the $50 price drop but fall to mention that if you had bought at the end of January you would be up near $25 a share. So, be patient and you will be rewarded."

"PayPal’s latest acquisitions such as iZettle (Square of Europe) Jetlore (AI preditions systems for Retailers) and PPRO (specialize in cross-boarder payments) set PayPal up for moving into major mobile payment spaces i.e India, and capturing both brick and mortar retail using the same strategy as square while providing a mobile banking platform to the 400 million people in India who don’t have access to banking solutions. The analysts don’t see this forming yet and PayPal loves it because they are making major moves and nobody is covering this. They are digging a moat in complete darkness and therefore the stock doesn’t have this seemingly large growth potential priced in. **I believe** PayPal’s stock could be worth over $200 a share in 18-24 months. That’s my own opinion based on my own personal analysis. Let me know your opinions by commenting below! Thanks!"
Big money will find its way back to PayPal. It’s inevitable. Be patient. The stock has been really hot the past year so the big dogs probably want to see it stabilize and show support in this mid/high $70’s
Overreaction.Already up from averaging down since I bought at $77.5 this morning.
Good earnings should break through $80 soon
"Positive progress PayPal has made recently:1. China online payment license2. Split payment cooperation with American Express3. Credit Card issuance of VenmoThe potential of the PayPal expansion is still not fully released, but the market does not appreciate its outlook. Waiting for a stronger catalyst to change the market sentiment to PayPal."
This is a $300 stock.
@Mike they are launching this month get ready for take-off. It’s HMBL not HUML 2 different stocks it trades under TSNPD and ticker will change to HMBL on 3-26
Another day on the struggle bus....
PYPL was the first stock I ever bought back in May for 1500 shares. This is my baby. I’m not going anywhere. Thank you for the gift of another 1500 shares at 75
why did CEO sell? Anybody knows?
Huge buying opportunity with a great earning company!!!
PayPal is up 110% in the last 9 weeks. Staggering. Incredible. Unreal!
Pypl already reported guys and they reported a great quarter....you selling afterhours because of SQ earning?? Do you make sense??
Ufffffff. awesome baby!
Fake dip. Bad jobs data is the best thing that could of happened. Now stimulus is GAURENTEED .
"I can just say THANKS as I will buy your stocks, see u in 2 years then"
who will get to 100 first PayPal or SQ again.
Today was a glorious day. Just the beginning.Enjoy 
"I feel like SQ earnings will pay a roll in this stocks movement as well. SQ moved because of paypals earnings, maybe the same will happen here. Just a thought"
utt oh below low of last week.
where are those Square heads?
"Market is OVERBOUGHT right now. The tax cut starts to kick in in full swing for everybody. I personally believe that PYPL will benefit even more. VENMO brand is very visible in the near future. Rainey is absolutely right, PYPL is patient and play the long game. I think we will hear the great news about VENMO this year. Now I start to accumulate PYPL in shares instead of trade on options. I see PYPL 100 this year."
They will beat earning and do amazing but sadly won’t move as long as the market stays like this. Holding 200 shares long
With this profit growth ratio PayPal is not even expensive. Should be only a matter of time to climb a new ath
"Congrats to Paypal holders, I aint . But I do like to see longs win a few rounds and stuff the short's short's."
"Is this ETF worth the 1% management fee? Definitely better than the 2% fee for $GBTC, but why not just open a $PYPL account and buy Bitcoin fractions there?"
Paid $85/shr for this at end of March & plan to hold it for 10+ years. This is nothing. I’d happily buy more in the 160’s.
Guess I made the right move when I went with PYPL rather then E-Bay
"Listening to the conference call, not sure who in their right mind would be selling and not buying aggressively."
"I predict that On Wednesday afternoon, the market will creep back and pop up on Thursday morning. S&P chart looks very beautiful, it may hit 2900-3000 this year. The U.S. economic is screaming, full employment and have no geopolitic conflict. I will hit more on Health care sector."
PayPal Raised Its Outlook
I guess the SP of LSPD kissed the high 70s one last time. Uptrend to catch up with $PYPL & $SQ and eventually $SHOP.
We should see $260 by next week
Let's finish at 280
The Sad thing is while PYPL is reporting earnings... DOGE Coin is up 12% In the last hour or so!!!
btc rising people buying and new stimulus checks coming......spend spend spend!!!
"considering eBay and PayPal already soured in 2015, and PayPal will continue to be a payment option until 2023, why the absolute freakout in PM trading"
"I bet you that they want to keep PYPL under 80 this week, which I think it is possible. I sold cover call at 81 and 82."
Pay pal is the victim of the current market. The sentiment for tech stocks is down. Any other time this goes up by $20 with this earnings. I won’t be shocked if we end up in red by the end of the day tomorrow. This will take some patience.
"PayPal has beaten earnings every quarter it's been a public company, expect nothing less this week"
"now, let's think big and go to 200 by the end of the year!"
"Patient investor long on e-payments, parlayed some $SQ and $PYPL profits into $FDC...glta"
"Still holding strong  with my “quadruple down” PYPL short @ $177, haven’t covered one share. Stairs going up, elevator  going down!"
PYPL is green while the rest of the market is red
you guys are over reacting... stay in the long run think where would pypl be in 5 years? a lot higher then it is now
"up 700% since I bought in 5 years ago. still Bullish, i wont sell."
"Paypal is focusing on partnerships. They lost Ebay so something is going to take it's place. Whether that news comes next week or next month, the stock will jump back up when that happens. Hold it long and you'll make your money back and more."
"This stock is dead. Regardless of the earning surprise, there will be no surprise of its sp falling down tomorrow."
"I posted a comment 10 mos ago asking why pypl not above 100, until today and heavily investing in this company that I got my own answer. 1)shares buy back instead of putting in expansion 2) management focus only on seller sides and idolized the one button platform 3) Venmo is outdated and offer no incentive to users compared to cash app 4) makes many unnecessary acquisitions to booster its one button platform..omg I can go on and on...they need to circulate out their top management now!"
"You want to stay in /hold this stock because one of these days (and imo I think it’s coming soon) off of partnership or expansion, that $PYPL can shoot up 7.5-10% in a day"
Jim Bears Sterns Cramer recommends buying the virus!
"One of my biggest holdings. Certainly hurts. I think the reaction is overblown, but don't think it bounces back anytime soon. Just like Costco's split with Am Ex, killed AMEX for a couple of quarters. I feel this will be the same."
PYPL soaring higher after hours.
Buy SQ now it’s moving fast
I honestly don’t recall the last time PayPUKE  traded “in da green”.

"No worries longs. Just hold. This will be back over $200 again pretty soon I believe. It's a bargain here now. I would buy now, or buy more to lower your cost basis per share. Good luck all!"
Made a big investment in PYPL shortly after it split off from EBAY. One of my best investments ever !!
Good interview with CFO on Mad Money BUT Schulman should have done the interview. Nevertheless the company is in great shape with strong drivers going forward. We will make up today’s hiccup in no time. Onto $100 by the Ides is March. :))
Great report... will be buying more at open
I love hearing people complain about PayPal blocking their account after they break the terms and conditions.. lol
Less than 2% shorts! This is amazing this surge! Will be interesting what happens tomorrow!!
If you want to know why PayPal isn't jumping after hours it's because the Good news was already built into the price of the stock. it would have to be astronomically good news in order to get a 5% or more bump. look at Amazon from yesterday. they had the best quarter ever and the stock was down today.
PYPL goes up at open and then falls for the rest of the day. Let’s change that
"PayPal (PYPL) Holdings is a globally recognized digital payment solution provider. The company plans to release its third-quarter earnings at the end of the day today. From July 1 to September 30, PayPal Holdings took significant strides to expand its operations. Notably, the company’s strategic decisions are forward-looking and seem to be full of promise."
"Where’s Stockstradamus? No-GROW and TEUM not exactly setting the world on fire. To less seasoned investors there is a good lesson to be learned here. Here was a guy that was PYPL’s biggest cheerleader and then at $75 he bailed out only to chase highly speculative cryptocurrency stocks. Greed will kill you in this business. You have a sure thing in your hands with PYPL. Stay the course and enjoy your gains. Stocktradamus if you have your ears on, come on back to PYPL. We will welcome you with open arms. :))"
#diamondhands - not selling a share. Short term bearish. Long term super bullish.
"Paypal holding up extremely well in this climate among its peers ( visa, MasterCard and Square ) .....with its solid fundamentals Paypal is the best place to plant your money and watch it grow!"
BUY BUY BUY!!!
And we get upgraded from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $300 :D
Great buy adding more on the pull back
Thinking about getting PYPL tattooed to my chest. If we hit $300 by years end I’ll wrap Venmo around the rib cage.
Excellent opportunity to buy the dip!

This is the bottom. Up from here. Overdone on stellar earnings
PayPal reached an all time high at 164.47
"all the hairstylist/barbers are buying stocks now. leading economists such as Irving Fisher to conclude, “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.”"
PYPL near all time highs in the midst of retail apocalypse. Keep buying.
"Just an FYI; PayPal is still VERY PREVALENT ON EBAY! Look into Rolex and other luxury items on Ebay and you will see PAYPAL - Buy it Now Pay Later etc... Rolex and other Luxury watches are booming... I know this isn’t everything, but it mattters!!"
"EBAY tried to ditch PayPal before using it's own pay service, but failed miserably. EBAY will fail again and back to PayPal will stay"
at CNBCsays PyPL to 300!!!!
Numbers look strong. Stay long.
Preparing for sell-off whiplash. Doubling down in pre-market. Yesterdays sellers will be very regretful at close today!
"a close above a 100, would be a breakout, with clear sailing to 110-120."
This QUIETLY surged today 
Long time pypl i have to admit i forgot earnings was today. Looking good. When is conference call?
"Wow, it keeps getting better, holding to at least $300."
$SQ will print $100 before $PYPL for the second time. We are stealing ya lunch. Been saying it for over a year now. Sell and buy SQ far better investment.
Next week we buy....
"I am planning to trim my $PYPL position soon, hopefully around $225/share. I have 700 shares, where the first 100 I bought @$35 in 2016. Planning to reinvest those profits to dilute my over-concentration in PayPal and will diversify in to AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and CRM.I am thinking that the Q3 earnings should be stellar, but the price has been very stagnant for years, aside from the March 2020 - Sept 2020 surge.What does this forum think about $PYPL?"
I'm a buyer in the morning. I see nothing bad and my outlook is still very strong.
dropped as market is red.. i can't find a single reason that caused this drop by paypal itself. not gonna sell a single share.
I was shopping on eBay today and the option to pay by PayPal disappeared. it's not even an option.....I wonder how much of PayPal's revenue was from eBay...
"I guess a PE of 64 is not cheap anyway, so it's now resetting for valuation"

"I think PYPL will get around 130-140 range and stay there for 1 year or so before the next large push up.This stocks pattern seems to be such as. Consolidate for 1-2 years, then up 50-100%. Then do it all over again.Then again, PYPL young stock still."
It’ll end the day above $80 so get in while you can
"Swift has better profit margin than any body, average interest rate is about 25 %. VENMO will have massive TPV again this quarter. TPV this quarter may run at least 120 -130 billion dollars. Any thing over 130 is great."
"Buy this while you can under 76, because this is about to take off to 80+. Great earnings can't be held down forever....#BullishonPayPal#NewHighsSoonToCome"
Overvalued
can someone summarize earning results?
So glad I loaded more a couple of days ago. Loving this stock.
$206.00 here we go
New 52 week highs! $90 can’t come any sooner.
Jeez FINALLY back up....I've been bag holding at $120 since July
Congrats longs! Dan Schulman is the best CEO the company found as it continues to hold the #1 leadership position on online payments.
What time are earning expected
"Already 235 in the premarket. This goes up really fast, fuelled by BTC and ARK. Was about to add more but perhaps I should wait for a small pullback. My buying point is still 215."
ARK didn’t sold PYPL. Fake news .
paypal IS buying and going to drive the price of bitcoin through the roof. people are saying that seeing you cant deposit or withdraw btc from their site that they are using some sort of internal ledger aka fake bitcoin. if so they are taking one hell of a reckless gamble. if I buy a bitcoin for $18k and it 10x and goes to $180k either paypal pays me from their cash reserve or they bought on my behalf at $18k. There is going to be an imbalance of buyers and sellers and this could bankrupt paypal if they dont buy the actual bitcoin.
It looks like the AH crowd is starting to feel the pain if they were shorting
"32 say Buy, 9 say Hold and only one Sell. Guidance only off 1% from expectations, yet delivering 14% growth. This is way oversold. I’m adding."
"Lyft and Uber seeing business coming back string right now.Yes, they both use PayPal and PayPal owned Venmo Love it."
"this stock has no gifs, so no robinhood teenagers"
Forward p/e now at 45. Buy
300 a share (or more) or bust! PayPal and Square are both fantastic companies and I don't see them slowing down anytime soon - and PYPL has a far higher EPS too!
"Why this is falling, Why?"
"Back in June or July I posted here saying $SQ would beat $PYPL to $100 now that SQ is less than $3 behind PYPL it’s nice to see some of you finally catch on and some are moving. I said I had 20k on the line that says SQ hits $100 first, who was it on here that confidently said they’d take me up on that offer and would be proud to take that 20k?"

"TipRanks has this to say about PYPL: "" PayPal, which has become instantly recognizable and the market leader in online payment services. PayPal saw $17.77 billion in revenue last year, with a net income of $2.46 billion. High and growing revenue has attracted investment cash, and PayPal boasts a market cap of nearly $228 billion.Despite everything that has hit the markets this year, 2020 is turning out to be a great year for the company. Q1 revenue and EPS dipped, but not deeply, and both turned back upwards in Q2. The second quarter top line was $5.26 billion, with earnings of 76 cents per share, the highest in more than two years. Share prices are up, as well, with PYPL gaining an impressive 80% year-to-date.Generally rising volumes of online sales, and the concomitant need for digital payment services, provide a continuing boost for PayPal’s income and share position.Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane put a $234 price target on PYPL, suggesting a 20% one-year upside, and rates the stock a Buy. """
I’m done with the stock market. My portfolio hasn’t moved an inch since October. I gain 3% one day and lost 3.5% the next. It’s the same cycle over and over. Moving to crypto. Tired of this.
"Wondering if Paypal's license in China will allow it to ""piggyback"" reciprocal partners? For example, could Visa and Mastercard use their limited partnerships with Paypal as a wedge into China? Would the Chinese government be more amenable to having one licensee (Paypal) it can better monitor than to have four to eight foreign payment and financial companies that it has to try to continuosly review? Just a thought!"

"Just bought 1,200 shares on today 's dip as it's hard to see at this screaming price / very cheap....as the train 's about leaving the station soon in no time today ...and far away from tomorrow...."
If paypal can break $78.50 today it could see a technical breakout.
"my opinion, I think will take off hold on to your seats!"
PayPal is up 6.52% to 240.82
if PYPL can add 1 billion in revenue then the price should be trading around 360 given current valuations
Ebay is planning to move away from PayPal monopoly at the end of this year. What would be the impact on PayPal stock?
ETHE up 20% today. GBTC up so much lately. PYPL is so undervalued!!PYPL needs to catch up with them. It should be trading @ $300+
PYPL is going up!!
"just doubled position premarket, give away price or play the bounce either way no brainer."
"Lol my apologies to holders, I bought some shares. Anytime I buy shares of any company, it goes down faster than a aspiring actress at a big movie audition."
technical analysis is BS nothing beats fundamentals which PayPal has.If you don't know how the company gets earnings than that's a problem. support and resistance level is BS as simple as that.
The big institutions are selling. Then the small guys will sell. Then the institutions will buy back the small guys shares cheaper. This is an awesome company. The strong will hold and prevail.
There we go!
"new high today, buy buy buy"
Walmart deal is a game changer
I believe it can go up to 95!
I think PYPL will report $.57 earnings. Anybody have any thoughts.
"Bought at the initial offerings, loving every minute of it, another call today for $100 and beyond......"
"The people who call PYPL ""paypuke"" are about as intelligent as someone who beats himself over the head with a hammer in attempt to relieve his headache. Shorts haven't made much off the rates rise yet they somehow think that noncompany specific news automatically means the story is broken. PYPL shorts expecting the stock to implode are in for a rude awakening. Kevin will be homeless soon from his short. Smart people like this name...dumb ones don't."
No more PAYPAL on eBay just received an email :(
"Typical ""buy the rumor"", ""sell the news"". Are we really all that surprised? It's had a nice run in a sloppy market this month and a pullback after earnings is not unusual. It's done it before. Consolidates, stabilizes and then marches northward to new highs. There will always be a wall of worry to climb; the FB earnings will be in focus tomorrow, just as Googles earnings was yesterday. Ying/Yang, etc. Bottom line, PYPL is growing, both organically and through acquisitions. Forward looking statements are positive overall. The stock will recover after tomorrow#$%$; maybe even Friday too; but it will recover. Mid/Late summer trading is always sketchy as well. Longs need to be patient; hold for the next ER or take advantage of the lower prices in the upcoming days to truly build a position. IMHO"
"There seems to have been major manipulation in this stock. None of the news was bad, including the fact that Ebay would move on to Ayden in 2 years. As that opens up the world for Paypal. The company had record profits. Then the market collapsed two days later, because of fears that the economy is actually growing and interest rates will go back .25% more than expected. Some inflation is actually good for the economy as prices increase this is healthy. As this means wages are finally going up. It is long over due. It would be more of a concern interest rates stayed low longer. They still will be low by historical standards."
"Atta boyyy,PYPL….get back up there and beyond!"
I got In at $70 #PYPL
i would cover here. The CC has not even started where the next few quarters good stuff is announced. This will close around $270 on a squeeze. CONGRATS LONGS!
https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/paypal-partners-with-splc-to-target-conservatives
PYPL will $ 272.00 by today's close!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
With all these meme stocks my 14 year old got interested in stocks. So I made a deal with him. I’ll put the capital up and he chooses the stock. We both look at the fundamentals to see if it’s a yes or no to invest. If I give a yes we split profits. It’s a good way for him to learn fundamentals and make some money. It also gives this old guy a sense of what the youth likes. It’s a win/win in my book. This was his first pick and he knocked it out of the ballpark.
Add 500 at 254...hope this be green EOD or tomorrow.Will go long with this
just picked up 40 more shares
Scooped up more shares. Next stop $210 once Congress passes the stimulus.
this is a buying opportinuity at thus orice
hmm... looks like we hit the bottom?
paypal should be heading to $100 this year
PayPal is about to buy iZettle. It will broaden their international reach and also compete with Square in Point of Sale markets where there is little other competition. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-advanced-talks-buy-swedens-182027852.html
"Listen up folks, PYPL has absolutely no reasons to be down daily. This one will beat earnings. We need those Robinhood folks to come squeeze the heck out of this one."
Green expected!
Next $100+ stock!
"Growth cant get sold off forever. The ""re opening "" stocks are WAY OVERBOUGHT as this point. Pretty soon Delta Airlines will be hire than before the pandemic with less than 1/2 the traffic and 10 times the debt."
"85 is the goal for next week, PYPL needs to reach 85 in order to hit 90 on Thursday morning, Feb 2."
"Go look the check point at all big stores, Verifone and NCR, there is a LOGO of Paypal on it. That is telling you that PYPL starts to muscle into the credit card business in a big way. Swift is really moving aggressively into P-P loan. This is the reason that I predict that PYPL will be a big winner for the next few year. If you remember that I keep talking about INDIA, now it will be a big market that PYPL will dominate from now on."
"Buying every 5% dip..This is one fantasiic company,excellent service. Easy $100 mid year,2019.GLTA"
Believe me shorts now nothing about the coming future. PSFE is so cheap; I see PSFE may easily hit 60-70 before the end of this year but I am afraid all indicator tells me that PSFE possibly will be bought out before 60 imho. Potential buyers may be:$SQ $PYPL or even $FB $GOOGL $MSFT etc yu name it.
Prepare for a $195+ opening tomorrow. Only place for PYPL to go is up!
"For any long term holder...do you see an earnings beat? I am the newbie to this board, have done DD, but is always good to hear from some long term holders. Thanks in advance and GLTA."
With earnings coming out today.From over 6$ this morning to pocket change now.So what does this mean when our earnings come out?
Slow and steady gang
Markets are the reason for the price drop.
This is a good healthy growing stock!
$350 next week
pushing higher before the bell. Congrats to those who bought on the dips.
"Pypl is simply consolidating here between $85-88. By the way, so is the overall market. I don’t expect this to change the rest of August either. I expect this to be at a 52 week high of $95-100 in October but as far as the next week, Don’t be surprised if it sees the $85-86 range again."
Paypal is very undervalued. Should be around 130.
"What a remarkable day to load up ACROSS THE BOARD. Funneled nearly all available cash now into PYPL and TSLA. Patience will be rewarded, as always!"
This is a tough stock to buy since it rarely dips!
New high today. Sweet.....
"Cathie Wood has been a train wreck lately. She panics, over trades and is stubborn to keep dumping money in some highly speculative plays, that may never have sound earnings or any earnings.It look easy for her when everything was irrational in her favor. I am really surprised at how much she flips in and out of money as a fund manager. She is worse than an over caffeinated day traders.Not good. Her funds are suffering. Seems like a nice lady, but she needs someone in her organization to offset her snap reactions.WOW!$PYPL here long and strong.Very Bullish"
"Alot of big money will jump in today, earnings will be epic...."
"the only bad news I can find is the CEO show 10,000 shares but he still has over a hundred and forty thousand shares, that's plenty of skin in the game, hopefully PayPal will recover quickly from today's drop"
Just bought a little 500 call. Wish me luck
Good luck guys
This is a gift!$$$$$$ Buy! $$$
Buying dips in PYPL and STNE growth accelerates
"PayPal growth potential looks even better after Q3, says Morgan Stanley. Reiterated Overweight and $229 price target. Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said PayPal (PYPL) was able to exceed TPV growth in Q3 even with a high bar set, adding that he is encouraged that revenue and EPS are looking to be better than forecast in the second half of the year even with accelerated eBay (EBAY) roll off and no recovery in the travel environment. The analyst, who sees the company being better positioned today to deliver compounding earnings growth over the medium-to-long term given new products and about 70M net new users to carry out of 2020, keeps an Overweight rating and $229 price target on PayPal shares."
SQ is going back to 230 in order to reestablish the 20$ price margin with $PYPL
PYPL is headed to $120.
Is this a short term blip or do we start to sell NOW?
"I’m pretty conservative normally regarding share prices, but this needs to be at 270 already"
paypal made to China
I believe the market will recover even faster because it drops too fast.
"OK say you receive $1000 check from Uncle Sam, but you cannot shop physically, so what will you do? Cash the check then transfer to your PayPal app to shop online."
Just in! Should Apple buy PayPal?
"okay folks, now this stock is getting interesting!! buy below 100 around 90 looks terrific"
I have good news for all you patient PYPL investors. The stock is about to soar. I only predicted this once before on here a while back and the stock took off. I am predicted $125 by end of year. Enjoy the ride!
Buy the dip
I don't know the last time I went on eBay let along bought anything off eBay. Do any of you use ebay?
Dear God..
Bought 1k 78.00
PYPL needs to either split the stock or pay a 5% dividend. Pay the owners (shareholders).
The Irony when you use a Venmo Card on a Square reader... made me realize that these companies are more compatible than people realize or like to admit.
Hedge funds guys normally take profits very time market hit a new record high like yesterday...Just sold half of my positions to secure my account ! Good Luck !
"PayPal has emerged as one of the biggest players in the digital marketplace. The writing is on the wall folks. Cash isn’t dead yet but it’s almost there. Crypto news ensures PayPal will always maintain a competitive edge. They are not not going to stand idly by. They know how to win and they are not going to stop. With Dan Schulman at the helm fighting to democratize financial services, this is a true value stock that will continue to bless the lives of many especially the underserved. Mark my words the growth PayPal is experiencing will continue on an accelerated path for years and years to come. Welcome to the future of money."
"They are just panicked and don't look around that PYPL does not change a bit. It will be a short period because fundamental is there and the technical is super. Big boys make it look like sell off. The chart points out :BREAK OUT"". I look at the chart both short and long term still ""BREAK OUT"" AND I DON'T THINK I AM WRONG.b"
Snapback rally.
I think the Honey acquisition will be fantastic. Real threat to Amazon and they know it or they wouldn't be telling people to be afraid of Honey.
Why down today?
stimulus has people flush with cash and I and like others have totally stopped using cash for payments. paypal is in the sweet spot
It will retest 80 again needs to break through it before week End.
Any rumors for AAPL and PYPL?Hold PYPL for long good news coming soon!
$PYPL to the moon!
Great report and future guidance!
"What a frikking bloodbath today! I am really not liking Bidenomics at all. I have spend my cash, so there is nothing to do not but wait for the bounce... and when it does, it will be tsunomic!"
"“HEY GOOGLE! Increase google’s paypal holding position 200%”“Alright, increasing paypal position to 200%.. would you like me to add more?”"
From 304 to 278 it's only 8%Down that's itStop crying like babiesOther stocks last week went down 12-15%
We will break 90 on eps announcement.
Last year 78 cents eps ($110 share price) for the quarter this year 66 cents eps for the quarter ($128 share price) what world does this make sense. Tread carefully
See u at $300 with crypto leading the way....
"Holiday season is near, Thanksgiving in just two weeks....millions and millions of consumers start shopping online used paypal method 's the most secure way payment...as this time of pandemic there 's been reported tons of credit card fraud / money lost when made non-paypal credit card payment online....It's gonna be huge TOP BEAT earning for next quarter following this pandemic holiday reason ever than before.....PYPL 's absolutely a screaming BUY on any DIP, like today 's a BIG HOLIDAY GIFTS...."
"Sure win to $300.If $320 is more happy.Earning, See you."
596 shares averaging now at around 102.Big where's the silver at?? 
"When investing in the stock market, 70% luck 30% research....knowing me with no luck, making small profits will categorize myself as top bengals fund"
I’m sure the mm knew of this new partnership before earnings call
"Two more announcements: Venmo is moving from social transactions to commerce. So they have already started monetizing it using ""smart buttons"". Xoom's U.S. remittance is gradually being rolled out globally."
Thumbs up for a new ATH for today :-)
I predicted this result 11 hours ago : PayPal and Nasdaq would rebound. March 1st : Paypal resumes its swift march northward to $300 and beyond as the ER release deserves
"I just sold my 5,000 shares at $79.25. I rode it up $2.20 this morning for a profit over $11,000. I hope to buy back in again if it drops another dollar or so."
I’m beyond bearish on this now. Cut my losses and now short
i would not give my credit cards # to an unknown processor
"Buy,buy, buy!!"
"For the people selling before earnings, you've been at the party this long why leave before the main act?"
Buy! Buy! Buy!
I bought a few shares today.
"Holy cow, Walmart just added PayPal as a payment option!"
get in before 1/25/2018 and ride this puppy up.
PayPal is more than a peer to peer app. They are making acquisitions to move into other businesses. They are more like the Amazon of payments and finance.
listening to the call. All i can say is: WOW!
chart is looking gorgeous.
"Big hedge funds are moving in before new year. I think we will see PYPL 77-78 by end of the month. It looks like last quarter exactly, but this time around, PYPL has more cash, less debt reserve and big MOJO. if VENMO is credit card, logo VENMO, PYPL will shoot to 100 very easy."
PYPL will never make it to 100.........because it will jump from 74 to 112.
"I see people on here bashing Square in order to promote PayPal. I’m a fan of PayPal too I’ve gotten rich off it but I’ve made close to 400 percent off Square since the pandemic floor in March. You shouldn’t pick and choose between the two, you should own both. They can coexist together and both are thriving. I’m richer for owning both of them. Both are giants with very little competition and both are changing the way business is done. Don’t be the guy who treats them like Coke and Pepsi, both of which I own too. Two good stocks are better than one. The competition between PYPL and SQ is good for both companies. So own both. Otherwise you are robbing yourself. Long PYPL and SQ now and forever."
"This guy, Scott Lehtonen from Investor's Business Daily needs to stop reposting his absurd article on Yahoo Finance about whether PYPL is a buy or not? The company has a solid valuation and immense long term growth potential. Although, he says it's not a buy, educated investors all know it's STILL a BUY!!! Enough already with the article, Scott!"
Amazon attacking Honey after being bought by PYPL. Makes me think they feel threatened by them.
Closing green today
They should start paying us a dividend
"With the Bitcoin momentum, don’t be surprised to see Pypl in the $400s right quick."
free dip buy today u know its goin back up tomorrow
"Why's is down 3 cents after hours...bad news ( joke,)"
Does anyone know if you buy something at Amazon can you pay with PayPal
Here it is! $200! Cover now shorts!
I just made fun of him and now he’s saying he said Jonny Carson.Hahahahahaha definitely a Democrat. Thank god for txt messaging!
Congrats Longs!!
I own the stock but I have heard very bad comments from their clients . Most of their reviews are one * star as they are randomly shutting people out and holding onto their money.for months. I think this is unhealthy behavior.
"Some major strategic initiatives at PayPal:1) Tap into the unbanked. 2) Turn PayPal into a payments platform, similar to a bank but more seamless. 3) Drive growth from Generation-Z and the gig-economy using p2p social transactions and bill sharing.4) Open up PayPal, often through partnerships, to developing and third-world countries.5) Invest towards Point of Sales integration similar to Square, but in Europe.On top of that, they are sitting on a hoard of cash to take advantage of the dips like we recently experienced...this will push up the EPS."
"Have you considered that consumers will be buying online yes, but buying LESS then pre-COVD?! And how does PYPL compete in-store with cards that allow you to tap and pay which is quick and easy?!"
Machines may make an sell error. Buying on gap down.
Guess my $80 by Friday call is not looking too good.
PYPL is set to report earnings ... after the bell. You have 20 min to place your bets.
Good move.
Trolls are out in full force. Bullish sign.
Mad Money/Jim Cramer said they are selling some of their portfolio and going big into Paypal.
52 wk highs next week.
"As an SQ investor, i missed out the cheap $30 shares this past march lows, i got in at a mid $100 unfortunately. Now that paysafe is coming to the market here under the SPAC ticker $BFT, this is an amazing opportunity that I dont want to miss out, i bet you dont want to either, check it out, they fall in the same category as $SQ and $PYPL"
meanwhile amc missed badly and stayed put. the market is a racket. I'm done with it good riddance
"My so called friends said, Only buy this stock if you want stacks of the Money. "
Such low volume though
"Wait until BABA is able to get its hands into American markets and stores....By the time this happens, PYPL will be out of agreement in 2020. Who do you think BABA will team with? PYPL is most likely 1st choice and best choice."
"PYPL just raised 5 billion dollars, another big buyout is coming in my opinion, whats your thoughts"
$300 price by summer. That’s all...
strong covid second wave will be a boon for paypal.
Shorts have zero idea what they are writing. 285 before 235
"If you look at the 1 year or 3 year chart, it’s forming a bull pennant. I know charting isn’t everything but this thing appears to be spring loaded. Anyone has any comments or critiques on my analysis let me know. I’m 22 and invested long term into PayPal so I’m not so worried about near future price action, but this is for those who are worried Day to Day about the price action. Don’t get caught up in it, especially in a solid company like PayPal. They are playing the long game because they know what they are doing."
"you can miss earning but just say something positive and it will go all-time highs pypl, sq, uber,ba, on and on it makes no sense. its all ragged"
Guggenheim is a nobody in the financial world. They should be investigating for downgrading pypl after the company had an earning beat and lowered guidance by 1% over six months. They still are growing at faster than their peers.
This is a great stock!
Nice push today!
Sell Tesla and invest in PayPal?
Everyone who’s taking profits right now will regret it soon.
"a ridiculous sell off, this stock has targets of minimum 225. Time to buy some more. Barron's PayPal Holdings (PYPL), meanwhile, has benefited mightily from pandemic-related trends such as transactions moving online. The stock is up 79% this year to around $193, but Wolfe Research’s Darrin Peller still views it as undervalued. His target price is $225."
"This will beat earnings as usual but this time will be definitely different, the level of transaction will be astronomically higher..strong buy and hold."
what is the benefit of using paypal to buy things as opposed to just using a credit card?
Guess who's entering the blockchain ? Servers are in place.buy on the open or it will be too late.
"Can’t wait until Elon texts again to send the markets flying! Wow, are investors gullible."
It is just another peaceful day of PYPL today compared to SQ
"Howdy. Been a while since i posted on this board. I just reviewed the long term chart on PYPL and have an interesting perspective. In April 2017 the stock was at 40. Today the stock is at 104. I've owned it since 39 and am obviously pleased. But during the last 24 months, the markets have had some wild times and there's been hurdles to overcome for PYPL such as eBay and new competition, etc. Seen comments on this board expressing frustration over stock performance, etc., and i have to admit i was frustrated at times as well. But after all these experiences, the stock is up over 150% in 24 months. If we fast forward to April 2021, and experienced the same growth of 150%, the stock would be over 250/share. I doubt we would have any complaints about that result, and i'm sure there will be many ups and downs along the way, just like the last 24 months. Being in this stock has taught me patience and to ignore lots of ""noise"" in the marketplace. I wish all the longs the best of luck; for me, i'm holding on for the long term and can only hope for another 150% in 24 months! IMHO GLTA"
"THEY GAVE UP. SELLING IS OVER,"
im in this for the long term but its getting really annoying that they can't hold 90 and square is blowing us out of the water
better buy these shares or options fast!
boom tomorrow. go PayPal go
I told my daughter about the honey issue. spoke to her about venmo dangers. she laughed at me and said it works for her and all her friends are still using it.

"Stock will not go nowhere, just fill the gap, until we see the volume over 10 mil. then we will start to march up to 80. I have no doubt about 80 in December. I will buy PYPL again near Christmas. 85-90 in Jan,."
"Just bought 5,000 shares at $77.05. I expect we see $80 today."

"COVID is a long way from over, and mutations are increasing rapidly. Don't bury your faith in PYPL quite yet. There is a LONG road ahead before this and other highly probable pandemics are sufficiently eradicated. Easy to bash an exceptional stock when it falls. Expect ANOTHER record breaking earnings report. With over 40 years investing experience, I can tell you that this is a fantastic entry level."
Paypal is the kind of stock that money managers will continue to buy. PYPL and SQ have much more growth than any of the banks.
PayPal is going to spike into the 90s and the days of bouncing around in the 70’s will be sweet memory.
Holding firm. Market turmoil no reason to sell.

"Pal, if you’re alive, new position started in ALCS. please move in. You will be happy."
Some more statistics to put PYPL bears into an even further tailspin: PYPL has $13 billion in cash and short term investments and $5 billion free cash flow. These numbers will only grow over time but right now they are at perfectly respectable levels. $13 billion in cash is no joke.
This stock is a big long term winner.
Hmm! Consumer spending is 5Xs expected. Of course PayPal is down. The stock market is absolutely crazy.

Consumer habits have shifted to digital and its here to stay. Rumors of crypto sales on the PyPl platform. Good leadership laser focused on results. Earnings is going to be a smash. Prepare for lift off in 3.. 2.. 1..
I guess its PYPL turn to go red.Still don't understand why SQ is higher than PYPL.
just added more to my holdings! I like both SQ and Paypal both will be huge companies in the future.
Great close... Wednesday..Thursday will be Great!!!!!! Closing in on $100.00 doable!
PYPL worth $300Why so cheap now?

"Looks like PYPL is repeating what was going on last year...and the same crazy upward movement will follow, just like the 1st half of 2019. The longer a spring gets pressed, the harder it will bounce up."
"First off, the whole market is down lol why panic?? The market goes up and down."
"PYPL's valuation metrics are false prophets. They tell you the stock is expensive, but they leave out that the valuation is more than justified to be at a premium due to tremendous growth when it comes to the crypto exposure as well as the fact that fintech is only in its infancy still when it comes to the degree to which it has served its total addressable market. Rates may batter PYPL but there is yet to be one instance throughout its entire history where PYPL hasn't recovered from its beatings. I expect PYPL when it is at peak maturity to be a FAANG stock. Free cash flow will likely double over the next year, the P/E multiple will contract and PYPL will grow into its valuation. PYPL has so many catalysts for growth it makes it almost certain suicide to short it for any meaningful length of time. This company is already in the early stages of becoming a cash cow but I expect that to be much more of the case over time. I saw the potential in this company at the time of its split from EBAY and so far I have no reason to be any less certain of that conviction."
anyone knows why we just popped in the after hours
"The largest Insider Buys this week were for PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), ConocoPhillips Co. (COP), Coty Inc. (COTY), and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL)."
Stock is approaching a breakout over $100
no worries guy...it's healthy go down sometimes... great opportunity to buy more stocks... Paypal is one of the best stock...we just have to wait and hold... how many times we have seen these pull-backs?
Where is everyone? Must be bored with all the consistent winning
the fact that square is about to hit 100 and this isnt even there yet tells you alot.
Yea thir! That’s what I am taking about! Onwards to $80 amigos ! :))
"When I looked at 7:30 tonite, it was at $139.00. Congrats to us all, trying to figure out this market is something that just makes no sense. Just take the gift of being up close to $11 & hope the trend continues tomorrow."
we are closing green guys keep buying this deeps and holding remember earnings coming soon
Not 1 year ago. There was a race for $100 with #SQ !SQ and #PYPL !PYPL SQ now $66 and PYPL is $109.BUT overall SQ is up compared to PYPL. Safer stock - PYPL Both good stocks IMO. IF SQ drops back to $60 Ill be buying more shares.
When will we know about the earnings? Good luck longs!
Wonderful quarter - on our way to 300
PYPL bought back 2.590 mil shares. They will give it back to employees as stock options
"MM manipulators don't want you to make big money on this right now. They will not allow it run up fast. Kept it way down before earning only to let it go back to $70 and change.. The max. price I see on Level II in A/H is $70.45 not even $72, what a joke!With almost 18% increase in Q3 profit we should be at $75 in A/H right now. But the cro.oked wall street manipulators like Ackman, Einhorn, GS, MS, do not want the small investor to make money.Between now and next earnings I beleive they will keep it in a range between $70 & $75. That said, slowly but surely we will continue to see new highs."
"Now, BUYing TIME!!!"
Again ladies and gents. I called this exactly 4 days ago (scroll down). Said the stock was poised for a big breakout and voila. And I don’t use no stinking charts! My Ouija Board does just fine :))
What time is earning
"Cha bong!!!! Nicely done PayPal, nicely done. Banks loan money and no growth. PayPal moves money with high growth. The velocity is accelerating. $$$$$$$$$ "
You kind of have to buy at these levels.
PayPal has surpassed Visa Card for the 1st time ! Visa has gone nowhere in the past 12 months .. we closed the $70 gap over that period. Now we take on Mastercard! The PayPal Juggernaut is unstoppable !
Remember AMZN $3600+ in after hours a few days ago? Now $3300. NVDA this morning up $20 on a $800 PT upgrade now back to even. Anyone holding call options maybe sell and buy 260 put options at the open
"PayPal beat earnings, revenue, and total payment volume growth consensus estimates. Added 16 million net new active users bring its total active accounts to 377 million.Expecting to add 50 million net new active accounts in the next 12 months.Venmo accounts rose 32% to 70 million active accountsSince adding bitcoin purchasing to its platform, it’s seen its users loging into their accounts twice as much."
"Highest closing price ever. More to come. Buying in front of earnings is likely. Recent all time high within striking distance. Earnings will be out in 2 weeks, and if history repeats itself, we're likely to pass 90. Then 100 will be in the crosshairs and likely to be overcome. IMHO - GLTA"
I am on Board with WilliamI suspect a $20 jump up once we confirm the break-out above $80 that we have all been waiting for.
PYPL will be surging back huge tmr!️️️
ARK bought another 24k shares on Friday

20 thumbs down the night after earnings when PayPUKE  was $260+ and I suggested SELL & SHORT AND BUY PUT OPTIONS and you will thank me profusely later. Right to $238
Waiting until after the election to pull the trigger but today is a dip to buy. This will be back over 200 soon and then on its way to 300. The smoke is going to clear soon and shorts are gonna learn the hard way why shorting this stock is suicide.
"On Jan 11, Paypal handled over $240M in crypto volume. This was ONE DAY...https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-volume-on-paypal-hits-record-242-billion/We can extrapolate this out to $10-20B in volume for the first quarter, assuming an average volume between $100-200M daily, although it could be more than this, perhaps as high as $30B volume.They are earn 1.5% minimum per transaction + a spread to bring this closer to 4-5%.This translates to $200M on the low end and $1.5B+ on the high end...I think it's safe to say crypto will contribute $850M+ in incremental revenue THIS QUARTER..To accumulate shares at these discounted price levels is a gift. I picked some up today and will add more in the coming days if it continues to drop.Good luck!"
Done with ebay now. Paypal is awesome. Its the only service that I will use. Will gladly gobble up discounted shares tomorrow.
258$ for today... lets go up up up
We are heading towards breaking the all-time high!
NO MORE AVAILABLE SHARES FOR SELLING...BUT BUYING...LOADING MORE EVERYONE.....
READY for new 52 week high.
"Dan Schumann, CEO of PYPL, will be on CNBC tonight-with Cramer, who says the stock is cheap at this price!"
Just bought 65 more shares! Not bearish in the slightest. If you are in for long term stay with this stock.
"A big shot across the bow to all the PYPL bears thinking Zelle and banks will chip away at PYPL's user growth:Zelle users are finding out the hard way there's no fraud protectionTechCrunch Sarah PerezTechCrunchFebruary 16, 2018"
"It has more than 30% ROI potential if you buy now.If you’re new to investing:1 year target is $306Trades at $230306-230=7676/230=0,3333% ROI is expected."
If u think all PayPal is is a payment platform clearly you forgot or don’t want to remind people of their izettle acquisition. That alone is a massive platform for global usage.
investment in PYPL led to try BTC and ETH small start position over December. BUT still dont understand their charges for buying through them. Like idea of not needing my own wallet mgmnt. Can anyone advise what the benefit/disadvantage is of using PYPL for crypto ? What are the charges and where do you see it.thanks in advance.......
It’s all fun and games until you’re 60 raising a 3 year old.
i have a feeling..we might see green light even today :-)
"paypal free cash flow, is 10 times higher than squares, free cash flow is the most important measure, not net profits."
There is nothing not to like about report.
"we think that this is going to be a very manageable transition over a multiple years post the end of OA, the OA, the operating agreement, also restricts PayPal from partnering with the largest and fastest growing market places in the world as an MOR. So, we’ve simply done an extension of the full operating agreement that would keep that prohibition in place and prevented us from becoming a fully neutral third-party platform. And the opportunity to partner with the world largest market places is immense."
"bought heavy today,,,,, shorting square at this point,,,,,, paypal willget to $100 before square."
Can more of you stock bubble people short this stock so we can get a short squeeze and push this thing over $100!
"James Eaton, has set a target price of $220 per sharebased on Vennmo, acquisition."
Fin-tech....... It's where the money is!
"its about time, this paypal is so under priced right now"
Interesting that google is entering the p2p space. I guess they assume they can gain market share. I wonder how it will affect PayPal and Venmo.
"So, how are you short feeling / doing today?"
Taking the advice of a yahoo PYPL short is like taking legal advice from a janitor. If you don't want to make poor decisions do your due diligence and ask the right people. Otherwise you could at the very worst end up broke and homeless.
"eBay was only 13% of paypal's review, they can make that up no problem. that said Clos is right, not cool ebay ... they probably shorted paypal"
We been consolidating in the low to mid 80’s. Lot of pent up pressure to explode after ER. Can easily see this stock going on top of $90 after ER. Shulman has been appearing on interviews during the quiet period. You don’t usually do that unless you got the “nuts” as they say in poker. Stock in for a major breakout. IMHO
Going to 90.

 PYPL'S COMING BACK
Ok! I’m liking this breakout move in PayPal today  keep it up! Keep it up!
Yesssss keep pumping the stock so I can short it 
"with paypal getting into acorns, this could go well if they buy them. basically free money. still waiting on some bitcoin news from PayPal. they need to jump on the bandwagon and push this stock even higher"
"Good money flow, strength, volume, with a solid uptrend. Bullish on this one for the week"
85 soon!
any opinions about the laws suits on PayPal?
If cryptos took a sudden turn towards worthlessness how much would pypl be effected. How big is their exposure? Do they hedge their exposure in any way? Has management discussed this anywhere?Thanks in advance

86.61 in pre. This is going to be a fun couple of weeks before earnings.
26 minutes to gain 10%
"Good luck, waiting on $260 and beyond I love using PayPal."
bullish 400
These spammers posting about the stock market bubble are the most annoying thing I swear.
"The fact that they gave guidance I think is Yuge! Most companies or even give guidance right now, and the companies that beat and raise and lift guidance tend to be rewarded by investors.￼￼.."
"A consistent theme at the investor day is PayPal's focus on becoming a platform. They just made an announcement to become the Rewards platform for major banks. This will provide liquidity to the bank customers who can use their reward points earned at individual banks across any of the millions of PayPal vendors. The partnership is now available at Citi, Discover and Chase. Barclays will also come on board next."
PYPL down only 2.23 and still over 89. Wasn't long ago that 89 sounded great! Now some people are disappointed. Hmmm. FB down 20%. PYPL will stabilize and will make new highs once again; most likely sooner than later. I think too many people were spoiled from the huge Trump rally from late 2016 to the end of 2017. We're in a choppy market for the past 6 months and yet PYPL continues to grow their business and their stock price. IMHO
can someone share the link of Paypal Q2 conference call ?
Bought 1000 last night at 75.25 sold this morning at 79.15. Kept my original amount. That was easy money. No way they should have taken that stock down that much.
this is a fed owned market. up is the only option.
What’s with the alleged PAYPAL being bought and or acquired by Buffet ...?Or but in rumor - call options anyone ?
If you base your investment strategy on what Crammer says your are in for some real trouble...
"PayPal is a great long term investment, it is a growth company. Years ago one had to mail liquid assets or use a credit card via phone line. One doesn't have to expose their credit card number and keeps secrecy and supports transaction. PayPal is forward looking by owning Venmo. They don't gamble on the future with cripto cash in the present. If cripto is the future, which cripro? I like the safe, no BS approach PayPal steers in the murky Waters of technology and finance. Your children will be using PayPal."
Whoohooo!!! Next stop $200 . I feel it
do you guys think this is the bottom? sold paypal at 270 on Monday and bought back in and keeps free falling.
Great company great earnings great management & employees great products HORRIBLE stock at $250. Just seems to be topped out
"Breaking news, Disney just announced that they will be closing 20% of their brick and mortar stores as they move to more e-commerce. HELLO PAYPAL.Re-opening, all good, but the world has embraced technology to it’s fullest.The real re-openings travel etc will be another area PYPL seized on.Hold your shares, add if you can, and know you are in a behemoth of finance, tech and crypto."
looks like she may pop on open. here's to hoping. cheers
Square exploding as well.. another great investment to jump on gang.PayPal + Square + GROW = $$
Good God Y'all!!....... Let me do that thang!!..........
"in the news regarding paypal buy now pay later, it makes money from the fees from its millions of vendors and the huge addressable market and without quoting word for word, this is a huge win for paypal"
"Guys I just sold, at a 74% gain. It was very hard to do cuz I believe in PayPal. But with the market, I just had to liquidate and take the profits. Good luck to all!"
Call options at the July $95.00 and $100.00 strike heavy on buy contracts.
"Heard that some Asian countries authorities are literally burning their cash/paper currencies due to the high transmission of germs via cash handling ... hence the likes of Paypal, Visa and Mastercard leaping by surprising amounts today ! The cashless society is nearly here folks !"
How much revenue and profits will Paypal generate in Q1? Somebody has some clue?
why is PYPL sluggish today?
There has been a lot of pumping on this stock and not much action. One hedge fund guy and all of a sudden people listen. i guess he backed it up with cash
190 end of the week!
Very nice consolidation. Now is the time to be buying more shares before the next leg up 
"Paypal, Square, and Tencent oh my what a day !!!"
"added 1,000 shares at normal 10:30 dip. ready for big pop. this is easy mo ey folks. get in while you can."
buy buy.
"Bought for 10k, This Journey Never Ends"
Amazing company! I am real sad that I sold it 200. It may hit 250$ easily by the end of the year
What stock to buy? $SQ or $PYPL?
"Not one bit worried I have $100,000+ in weekly 250 put options expiring Friday and I know I will make money from $260 here, the market always gives it all back"
"Glad I got on board early ... and I plan on staying there. Expect to see $100 per by year's end, anything less will be disappointing."
Back to $90!
"Ayden is not Paypal, people will not just switch to Ayden. Paypal will compete, and it has economies of scale Ayden does not have. Paypal is a unique company, and it will continue to trump it's competition. It is not just that easy to write off Paypal. It has a track record and not a unknown company."
Buying shares at these levels for sure. Buying into weakness on this stock is a no brainer
Back to 300
I sold A LOT today sorry about the share price people ... I'm moving my money to AMC  best of luck
Out for now. This thing has no juice. Square has the juice in this space.
"Hopefully, PYPL hits new high this week. It is very good chance that PYPl just breaks through over 80 this week. I see 85 up when earnings report hits the wire, less that 2 weeks."
"Anyone who says this is a dotcom bubble has no clue what they are talking about. The valuations in the dotcom bubble were outrageous because there weren’t numbers to back them. These companies have numbers, they show growth, and strong future growth."
$100 by next month! $120 by end of the year.
chance to buy this cheaper!!!!
Cmon plz get to 90
Brilliant!!
"PayPal dominates online commerce in Italy, with approximately 1,383,000 payments made each month."
"Started a position today in $V. Best balance sheet of any of these credit companies. I'll also be waiting to get into $PYPL as well if it pulls back. It'll be interesting to see if consumers have been using credit during this crisis. Also, when this eventually blows over, consumers will be spending like gang busters after being stuck in their houses for months. The credit industry will be a great place to be at a discount."
PayPal just announced : “Checkout with Crypto” available from today !!!
"So, the march to $250 is finally underway. Only a month late, but the buying opportunities were amazing.$221 resistance level hit. Breakout is only a few % pts away."
100++++ coming sooon!I suspect before end of July this year.
"Bitcoin revenue is still undervalued IMO. They are bringing in $11 on $500 in bitcoin purchases, then the same on the sale."
"doubled my position at 175, you gamblers betting against stocks are nuts. Stay away from tall buildings with windows that open."
"Izettle was going public on the Stockholm Nasdaq Exchange and were hoping to raise 228 million U.S on their I.P.O.And yea here comes an American Company who is willing to pay the two owners a principal of two billion dollars U.S, not to take their company public."
Shorts better buy now!!!!
Finally getting some life back.
Can someone explain as to why this stock has been so stagnant lately?
225 coming .
"Tip: I luv PAYPAL & did great in 2020. I am now in NCR (National Cash Register) cause no matter where you physically shop and pay you gotta have a checkout. e.g. Walmart converting more to self-checkout... so next time you shop there look down in the glass of the scanner... which company name you see? Next ATM you use,,,,looks who makes it. When USA goes back to work and spends money at Fast foods, (Chick- fill-a, Wendy, Steak houses, many mom and pops to, etc.). Who you see? NCR that's who..... largest in the industry for $34 per share .... and running up! NCR buying other companies too! PAYPAL and SQ is great but stalling out. - just saying. NCR is already in place, everywhere over many countries too and is upgrading and expanding. ""Back to work"" means NCR grows much larger, much faster!Now you know too!"
"I posted this last week and got three thumbs down: ""Last week, I mentioned here that the upward move in PYPL appeared to be over and suggested selling call options on long positions. I was bullish on PYPL since I posted a 6 month price target of $120 in December. I was obviously correct about the move to $120, and I think the earnings report pretty much validated my current strategy.""I've been so right about PayPal for 7 months now."
"It looks like eBay is bypassing PayPal....eBay now manages the end-to-end selling experience on our marketplace, including payments. This means: • No more PayPal payment processing fees. • You get paid directly to your bank account, not your PayPal account. • Most sellers will pay the same or less than before."
PayPal + Google. Nice
CEO said April saw the largest jump in demand probably since they first went public. That digital payment trends have accelerated by 3-5 years
"PayPal, Venmo plans to start direct crypto saleshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3585106-paypal-venmo-plans-to-start-direct-crypto-sales-coindesk?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=pypl-paypal-venmo-plans-to-start-direct-crypto-sales-coindesk&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3"
Could easily boost up to $95 with good news
This is now the most shares I have ever shorted of any stock in 30 years of trading.......$177.......will cover @ $121 and go long
The manipulators colluded and decided to sell fintech today. What a racket.
Ok who is brave?
Well done Big 
"I added 540 shares today long term, wish me luck guys..."
AND..... WERE OFF & RUNNING!!
PYPL literally never goes down. Long from $25.
"Unlike Square, PayPal doesn't hold Bitcoins... Given the tremendous growth in active users and payment volumes, I think the stock may go back to it's ATH of $300 soon"
"Wonder what kind of ppl would put BTC into their Paypal wallet and actually use it like a currency, for paying and receiving what goods and services?"
this is a gift to enter pypl here.. going into earnings nice opportunity
Lets watch the bounce off of 13k on the Nasdaq.
I wonder how many of you here use the PayPal check out button? I am big investor in PYPL but I never have to check out with PayPal
Here's betting we hit $200 within 18 months.
"Amd was trading at 52 week high . Shares went up . Why this PayPal can’t go up , it puzzles me"
the only one green!
PayPUKE down $100 in a week isn’t that great LOL R.I.P. forever
"when a stock is showing a 52 week high , it means no one is underwater, why is this important.1 future investors are attracted to stocks that have showed long term positive action.2 , as no one is underwater, it means they aren't looking or a break even price to ""get out"""
$75 will look very cheap a year from today. Well I will be adding more shares yet again.
The value in PYPL is in its financial platform and business models for future growth. IT SHOULD NOT BE HINGED TO CRYPTO! Apparently Robin-hood traders believe they are owning a piece of Bitcoin based on.highly misleading articles and Crammer rants. Get it straight and get it back on track1
Buy Buy Buy PYPL they still have good growth for many years
"Higher rates (per Yellen); inflation creeping up (free govt spending) and increased corporate taxes (J,B.'s edict). A dem's view of a great America!!!"
Everyone is canceling PayPal Venmo Square and going to HMBL
A super powerful beast !!
This is NO BRAINER folks! In 10yrs those who bought shares of this will be very wealthy if you’re already not!!! Enjoy the ride! HOT AS FIRE  
"talking about the chart: in the past each new high outpassed the previous high,.. we are not at this point right now and the frame can't be better right now. Honey will bee independent in a few years, as well as honey, traders is already and they have huge of upside potential. They could just implement traders in Europe,... you think it would be hard? I think it wouldn't.. Ebay`s website is old as **** and not very appealing anymore"
$220 breakout.
"one has to own PYPL, V, MA and SQ. also look at STNE who's price is coming right to you!"
Look at the 10 year.I added to PYPL today.
"$PYPL is looking pretty good right about now, isnt it?"
Gutted... wanted to buy more! :(
This thing is going to >>>>>>>>>>
Loving it
Strong Buy!
Paypal is the dominent player in online pay and increasingly at retailers. You do not need to give out any personal data. That is the trend which will not go away. Venno can be spun out at some point. It has 40 million users. PE has gone from 36x to 30x which makes it undervalued.
Why is PYPL struggling to get up there. When SQ is almost to green positive?
Great buying opportunity. PayPal has a lot more growth left in it. Strong long term hold.
Kevin bro you really shorted at 179. That’s rough.
isn't it neat to watch manipulation move like a green wave higher?
"beat and raise, my 2 favorite words"
"Reminder $TWTR folks. Jack Dorsey owns SQ. He is also CEO at $SQ so he is mismanaging two companies by being politically extreme and alienating businesses owners from using SQ’s inferior product. How much is he truly focusing on one let alone two companies when he has been censoring mainstream America and giving a forum to rioters, looters, arsonists and their associated organizations.$PYPL and other alternatives are the way to go. Don’t be known as “doing a Dorsey”. Self inflicting financial harm to yourself and worse others who have no say and mistakenly invested in $SQ not knowing.Go check out the public records, the vast majority of Dorsey’s holdings are with $SQ He has very little left by comparison in $TWTR.Sell and save yourself the grief."
"When the multi billion dollar sale of Paypal's finance portfolio from months ago to Synchrony Financial completes settlement in the 3rd quarter, watch Paypal pounce with a huge acquisition ! This company's not stagnant, just verrrrrrry canny and strategic in its manoeuvring. Buy in now good people or watch from the sidelines while we head to $100 a share and beyond by year's end !"
We’re moving forward gang. It’s our time!
"When Paypal puts iZettle to the metal the sky's the limit....it will leave SQ wondering "" wah happened? ""...lolBravo Dan! Encore, encore!!"
FB should buy PYPL for $160. That would be a financial powerhouse
"Someone bet me this morning (for fun) that $PYPL will hit $300 by June 2021. I said no way, and took the “over”, meaning it won’t hit $300 until after that date. What do you guys think?"
Y’all who were calling PayPal going 60’s a couple weeks ago crack me up
"PYPL is now benefiting from India's freelance economy and in the path of Modi's push towards digital payments (demonitisation). According to MoneyControl, 74% of India's freelancers use PYPL for transactions.https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-india-betting-freelancers-fuel-080206329.html"
"PayPal Partnership with ITAU bank which will add up to 1 million new clients and then a partnership with with AirTM such will help people in other countries convert their hyper-inflated currency to USD whether it’s gift cards, banks, or cash. I beg people to keep shorting this stock haha"
I own Square and PayPal and I’m glad I got in Square early but I’m starting to feel like it’s just WAYYY too parabolic.
Get ready for a fantastic year!!!!
Any news on this drop?
Much ado about nada. We’ll get through this and Upwards and Onwards. Yawn.
PayPal reached an all time high at 234.00
Dont worry guys. The company is doing really good. Its all the external factors. Just think its perfect time to buy more. I just did that :)
0.57>0.543.69billion>3.581 billion
Cathie Wood's Ark Invest bought another 184358 shares of PYPL yesterday
"""This time PayPal officially completed the acquisition of 100% of Guofubao, and then we will see what kind of waves this international payment giant can make in the Chinese payment field.The analysis believes that there is no doubt that entering the Chinese financial market is a large-scale expansion of PayPal. This move will bring a lot of great opportunities, especially considering the speed of market growth.By 2023, China's payment market is expected to grow by more than US$96 trillion. PayPal now has the opportunity to enter this gold mine and secure a piece of their cake.It is worth mentioning that e-commerce plays an important role in China's financial market, and the demand for e-commerce is also growing. Most e-commerce providers are located in China, and the market is benefiting from the large number of transactions that occur every day."" From dailychina.org$96 TRILLION CHINA MARKET BY 2023 and Paypal is near the ground floor people!"
Do Not sell. A Beat is a Beat. Only short term traders are taking profits.And the 10B buy back is as good a reason not to sell as you should need. I am in until they can not grow and that is not in the visible future. There will be buyers coming in as you must remember the market is not efficient in the short term .Particularly on amateur hour trades.
"PayPal: Helping make digital payments the standardOne of the trends that got a significant boost as a result of the pandemic was the shift toward digital payments. This was partially the result of increased adoption of e-commerce, but it was also due to the pressing desire for touchless payments as people and businesses looked for ways to reduce the chances of customer interactions spreading the coronavirus. No fintech company is better positioned to benefit from that ongoing change in consumer behavior than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).The digital payments pioneer was already thriving, but COVID-19 kicked its growth into overdrive. PayPal moved quickly to roll out QR codes to provide additional touch-free payment options.In the first quarter, PayPal added more than 20 million net new accounts, as its growth rate on that metric rose 17%. This brought its total to 325 million accounts, and that could be just the beginning. The company reported that after the close of the first quarter, it saw dramatic gains in transactions throughout April, and adoption and engagement trends accelerated in May.""I would argue that April was probably the strongest month for PayPal since we became a public company,"" said CEO Dan Schulman in a May interview with MarketWatch. That strength continued into May as PayPal reported the largest single day of transactions in the company's history -- beating out 2019's Black Friday and Cyber Monday results. Digital payments are the future, and PayPal is helping pull that future into the present."
SQ is super hot the whole week. i wait until near end of Dec to put money on PYPL
If there was ever such thing as a safe haven stock. This is it.
PYPL is one of those forever stocks people. always buy on any dips.
Might see 259 today. Suspect the options wall will kick in around 260.
the only way I ever wake money playing earnings is by selling the rip after hours
"Uh, Payment option on Alibaba? Squeeze me?"
Great news today who is sellingWe need to go up againBuy buy buy
The story has not changed. The company is buying back shares at this very moment.
I have to think if PYPL is going to be successful and grow the relationship with EBAY will be less significant than everything else they have going on. EBAY has to be jealous of PYPL success and they probably needed to squeeze everything they can out of the payment process. I hope and my money is riding on this being a bump in the road instead of a fork in the road.
breaks out and keeps the up trend.
"""We are making strong progress in monetizing Venmo."" $12b in Venmo payment volume in 2018Q1. 80% higher than 2017Q1"
Loving the breakout. Sorry not sorry I own both PayPal and square. PayPal way over due for a jump and it’s gonna come with earnings. Let’s hope their annual guidance stays in tact. If so 100+ easy.
"Man PYPL is a god awful stock. A friend, who is VERY high up in the industry, told me like 6 months ago, when PYPL gets to $200, sell it and short it back down the proverbial drain"
No supportive strength on this stock...
You guys calling for $70 after earnings were a little off today
Tomorrow is going to be a confusing day.
250 any minute guys 
Near zero rates through 2023 and a booming economy equals another bull run
Finally some action :)
Why is this wonderful purchase still at 101?
"You need friends in life, but only one pal: Paypal."
"Great stock and a good hole in the long run. I believe they will consolidate a bit before going higher, probably 3-5 days given its history. Their current RSI is at 70 while volume went down after earnings. Current candle is well above the 20 EMA so I assume it will retrace a bit back after continuing to go up"
An opportunity to buy on the dip
be patient. A great earning is in 7 days.
PYPL just bought back 1.237 shares
PayPal board needs to consider a 2 - 1 split when we hit $180/shr.
Lets end above all time high
I am in...
Pre-market 98.74. Looking pretty good for today. I hope it goes higher to 100 and I hope it happens today!
Current price target $215 here on yahoo finance.Your welcome
Wait whys it up in pre market somuch? any news?

MF just sent out the 10 must own stocks to build your portfolio and PYPL was on of them.
"Paypal is life, paypal is love"
Shake out. Sorry...not falling for it. Think I'll add another 100 shares...thanks.
Now that HMBL has entered the stage and will release their app tonight at midnight PAYPAL will be dropping. EBAY is going with HMBL. News is coming fast. Good bye PAYPAL
"Realization will hit investors that e-commerce stocks are just as, if not more important in a post-COVID world. PYPL is earning the title of being the leading retail money exchange for international transactions, as well as those close to home. Still an easy 220+ price target. Take advantage of the retrace and load up if you can."
"Everyone relax. PYPL up 15% in January. It needs a little correction. -3-5% who cares. I bought today and I will be down 3-4%. I am not worried. PYPL will be back to normal in 1-2 weeks. Market not fixed. Yes it went down with GREAT earnings report. Some stocks do that, some don't. All is well LONG TERM"
Has this whale beached itself?
PayPal back on its foot !
pullback to 260? or keep rising and keep 270 as a base? any opinions?
PayPal CEO: ‘I don’t think there is any going back’ from e-commerce after COVID-19https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e6a6d7fd-0c22-3998-80c4-660615f757e8/paypal-ceo-%E2%80%98i-don%E2%80%99t-think.html
Expect early $90’s end of this week and around $100 after great numbers due in next weeks ER... Go Paypal !! World leader in its field 
Will reach a new high soon.
"It was a great quarter, story still right on track:https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/venmo-has-40-million-users-paypal-reveals-for-first-time.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
Best darn stock in da land. Take that to the bank!
Ti.e to start buying again. This stock seems to climb on steps.
Keep selling so I can get in at $215 Appreciate your help in advance!
I can honestly say PayPal is doing really good in this market much better than SQ
I bought 1k on margin as the chart indicated a reversal today
ARK unloaded a lot of paypal yesterday
Might be a little too much dip on the chip going up 5% in regular trading session. But I'll hold thru earnings. This company is going to the moon.
wow could not resist bought a little at 182
"I bought 100 shares of Ebay 12 years ago and have held it ever since. I basically got a 100 shares of PayPal for free! However if you split out the price of each from my original buy, I paid $12 a share for Ebay and 20.99 for PayPal!"
VERY HAPPY TO JUMPED IN LATELY AS WITH THIS DIP...THE BOTTOM 'S JUST IN....BUY MORE WHILE STILL CAN...
Just heard that PayPal invested $500 million in UBER IPO !!!! When I invested money in Paypal I wasn't thinking they were going to speculate in the market with their capital. What are they thinking ?????
"Ive got 3k to load up on either PayPal or square, I know PayPal will slowly creep up to 150, maybe square can give me a bigger increase."
"by March 5th based on the current average daily drop (since Feb 16th), price should be around $215"
$SQ and $PYPL I'm not sure how anyone could have looked at those chart this week and thought this was a good time to buy. It was clear the charts of these high flyers were a warning sign for the broader market.
Riding this to $400
"PayPal reportedly considering launching its own stablecoin. Reported on numerous news outlets. IMO this sounds like PayPal is taking crypto very seriously. They should also consider more crypto coin options, offer a better dashboard for holdings, and provide the ability to move coins at some point."
"wow, today is the day to buy more, check me in 3 weeks! love this fear!"
I think the upcoming earnings are a massive indicator of where PayPal is heading. I hope they can hit it out of the park and the markets improve because then it will be a double whammy in terms of $$$$
this market makes me want to drink
Ebay sent me an email today notifying me that it would be adding a new payment option. I replied to the email stating that I will never use ebay once paypal is not an option. YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME! Let them know where you stand.
"Bitcoin, which some view as a barometer of speculation in financial markets, rebounded back above $50,000 on Wednesday after more buying of the cryptocurrency from Square."
beat beat beat!
Going Up!slowly but surely!
"down 10 cents? Was at $233 at one point today? Man, take a little time off and miss a great buying opp."
"This is a high quality stock. Believe after today, there should be more investors jumping in."
This will get back to $200+ in no time. Bought more this morning. Earnings beat coming this afternoon!
Good sign today that the stock has only decreased a little bit. Nasdaq is down almost half a point and were close to break even. Lets hope the market is decent tomorrow and we can see some slow and steady gains :)
This stock is gonna hit $100!! Wahoo!
"Big, get over yourself and sell the family silver to cover."
Every product PayPal introduces has exposure to its long-lasting and large customer base. That's the true connection IMO that's going to rapidly fuel further growth. People trust PayPal.
"If you’re wondering if you should buy PayPal, keep this in mind:- PayPal will benefit from current levels.- stimulus will boost e-commerce"
From what I been reading seems like PYPL May finally be on the precipice of a great move upwards. Let’s see what happens between now and ER. Could me a major move upwards.
Do you think we will see $300 again today?
"Dive, dive! Might be worth picking some up before the end of the day for tomorrows rise...Its done this a few times before."
"Typically wallstreet game. Drop on good but not so great earnings, wash out retail investors, then pump again."
follow the trend UP
Thx Pres Xiden economy
"Yesterday I paid $30 worth of fees to buy ETH on PayPal. Crypto is going to generate a lot of money for PayPal. I figure worst case if I lose the money I invested in ETH, PayPal should make it back for me"
"pypl is an amazing stock, however, I've been looking at Apple and want buy some at this price level. should I use the funds I have to buy more pypl or buy aapl? I think pypl might have more upside honestly."
Time to buy some $BB. $TSLA $RYCEY $PYPL $SPCE will be my early retirement in 5 years!!!
Huge buying opportunity!!! A great company with a great earning and outlook. It enters Chinese market. It has a huge growing potential!!!
Guys remember there is still Cyber Monday next week. Basically this year Black Friday is just a Cyber Friday. Paypal is benefiting from both events.
sell the rumor sell the fact. If only there was some bad news to buy.
new highs nearly every day for months. is it legal for money making to be this easy?
$SQ $PYPL merger just rumored on CNBC by Cramer? Maybe some truth to that....thoughts?
will we see red despite amazing earnings? welcome to the scam market
"New small investor. Good earnings, tired up being nickel and dimed by PYPL through ebay sales lol"
Bidding up in pre.Let's close over 80 today!
"Been in contact with my family in Italy the past few months and discussed their quarantine and so, I had a bit of a head's up on what was to come here in the USA. I sold off a very large position in Paypal several weeks ago and now, so happy I did. Today, I considered where we have come (in the market overall) and decided to start to dollar cost average back into this monster. I stuck my toe back into PYPL with a $20K purchase just before the close. It may go down more but, at some point you have to start thinking proactively and ease back in. I plan general large purchases each week for the foreseeable future at this point. A year from now this horrible Market and epidemic will be nothing more than a bad memory. Stay strong and long friends."
"I""m buying 200 more shares of PYPL/ Anyone else?"
"Be patient, the time of rising will come soon. Every thing PYPL is doing right now is to perfect the platform, It takes time to do it right in order to dominate the sector. The earnings number will be huge, I don't worry about the EPS, I just want to hear the future plan how soon they will monetize VENMO."
This will be $500 by the end of the year.
Sometimes the mute button is your best friend :-).
Start a petition for PayPal to accept Dogecoin
I have no regret buying Paypal even this huge dropping. Very disappointed but it doesn’t make me sell the stock I want to hold for the long haul. Sorry for your losses and myself but we know that it will be turnaround very nicely in near future with a good news.
Jumped out at $90 and regretting it since. This is a solid growth stock. Waiting for a dip to get back in
There will most likely be a technical breakout if it breaks $85
It will be above 105 end of week

"Schulman and Rainey cashed out 20000 - 30000 shares recently between 260 - 304. Very surprising. They were caught out once 3 years ago, Schulman sold at 110 and Rainey 114. They boss himself thinks PYPL is overpriced? Cathy Wood certainly strongly disagree. Fintech expert vs company supremo, who is right?"
Strong close by PYPL and great week. Story keeps getting better. Stockstradamus no where to be seen. No-Grow and Teum I gather must not have done well on this awesome day for stocks.
"Earnings were fantastic, this is the future covid or not"
what a bargain - I remember cnbc touting this what at 300?
This stock is a beast. Pandemic or not this will continue success. Digital payments is the present and future of commerce. IMO this is a great stock to hold for 10+ years. It will be the next Visa/Mastercard except better.
The big boys buying now. seen 3 million dollar purchase at $113.
When do earnings? Yahoo says before the bell but I don't see them.
"When Paypal stops the flow of money to some accounts March 29 -- it will have a ripple effect to EBAY and anyone else trying to use it as a payment processor when they cant accept funds Paypal will lose funds, lose fee, ebay will lose funds, lose sales, lose fee so will other companies."
Technically we’re going higher loading up here
imagine what a 1/2 point rate cut will do to pypl.
Just opened my Paypal Account after a long time away. I noticed they are selling BITCOIN now. If this stock is linked to CRYPTOS im still not sure about CRYPTO but it doesn't hurt to be in for the ride up. Sure hope it follows it trend upwards. This could lead to hand over fist buckets of money $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
A global tech stock at this price is a steal. Won't be under 100 for long so buy while you can!
Wait till the kids get their free money and start buying crypto on PayPal Load up
Thursday will be wonderful for this stock. Better hop on now. Love this name long term.
"I am happy with PYPL. I was at a lost of 10% once with this stock over 1.5 years ago. I kept. I didn't add nor sell, but now up about 38% Sure, its not 400%, its not 200%. BUT PYPL is one of those safe stocks that even in worst of worst times, will survive and continue to grow. It is not nationwide, but worldwide. I am happy for a steady nice 10-40% per year return. PYPL long term investment stock."
What do you guys think this stock is going to be when earnings release?
I see no one is making fun of my quadruple down short at $177 anymore 
Told you PYPL is going to explode!️️️
$PYPL is eating Visas lunch. What is management doing? They had best wisen up and wisen up FAST!
$80 coming soon buy dips and pass go and collect you spoils mate.
will never use options again.. will never use options again. will never use options again. will never use options again
Cheap shares
PayPal overbought at 212.3. Big run up .. taking profit and careful from election. If trump loses market will crash.
We have our momentum back!
Everyone ready???
Got in at $77.60 before the Earnings release yesterday. Hope this hits $100 by year end!
"Hello all! New buyer here (long term). I bought at 198.48 and guess what. Price u-turned downwards. Sometimes, I wonder if I really had some special superpowers to move the market.  LOL."
This is a $200+ stock. Easiest way to move money around the world.
Wish I bought more
I've dreamed that this stock was making me the 1st milion
A growing stock and bright future!!! Jump in now to take advantage of it!!!
Obviously “Big” is spreading FUD about PYPL 20 posts daily because he’s trying to get the price lower so he can buy in. Hang on to your precious shares
Ebay is going to move away from PayPal. What do you think? Figure out yourself 
Pypl is in buying mode now.
Turn Around Tuesday
"So... PYPL drops because Evil-Bay will majority-partner with a largely unknown upstart Dutch firm. I spent the last ten minutes looking at my past year’s purchases/transactions via Paypal. I purchased items - inexpensive and luxury - with Paypal from private sellers and stores in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Canada. I bought a few guitars with Paypal from vintage guitar shops in Japan. I did a lot of buying from a plethora of U.S. retailers, too. Oh, and I received payments via Paypal from clients in Italy, Switzerland, France, New Zealand, UK, Netherlands, Japan, Taipei, Tasmania, Norway, Canada and about 20 states in the USA. My ‘paltry’ total of in-and-out monies/transactions via Paypal for 2017 was in excess of $100K. And? NOT ONE TRANSACTION - zero, zilch, nada - with Paypal and Ebay, together. None. You really think PYPL gives a dotard #$@! about Evil-Bay?"
"If anybody did their research and read the conference call transcript, you would see that eBay doesn’t have much of an effect. This is what I got from it. “But assuming no acquisition, eBay becomes approximately, at the end of the operating agreement about 4% of our TPV”"
Hopefully the conference call will bring it up
This is probably the best results PYPL is going to have for a while. They had a good revenue from processing all the small business grants. The revenue mostly just came from PPP loan processing and small business bailout cash. At 100 PE and best of all the transactions it can possibly have is the trigger to exit. I am exiting my 3500 shares that i have been long since $60s today and tomorrow. This may go up until tomorrow and can break $200 before it loses steam.
just like every other quarter i'm always amazed on why people are selling on the great earnings....and like after every quarter I'll probably take advantage and pick up some more shares if it drops further. it's worked out 100% of the time.
Don't get snockered into this BS about an end to a run up. your being played by the institutional trading conglomerate
paypal is on a rampage right now
"It seems that PYPL sells off after earnings every time. It runs up to earnings, sells off, then recovers. In a month you will regret having sold."
I can't find anyone that voted for the mope
What’s a good price to buy in at???
PayPal safest and smartest play on the stock market
"I am liking what I am seeing. Retail sales figures are looking to smash estimates, not to mention rocketing Crypto levels. This should bode well for PYPL and SQ. I have little doubt that PYPL will crush earnings estimates through the FY. Expect to see some major hedge fund buying in the coming 6 months and likely some increases in analyst estimates."
Adrenalin
We just needed to be patient with this one. 32 out of 44 analysts have buy or strong buy ratings..
Absolutely no reason to sell this name... growth runway is unreal
What's going on here did the CEO come out of the closet or something...
"As a new investor, less than 10 years. It STILL surprises me that ONE person's opinion can mean the difference between 1 Billion - 5 Billion. Do people honestly think there is no inside deals, bribes or other things NOT happening?It is insane. How are there not laws against this?"
Any ideas on the short term period 1-2 weeks?
"compared to square paypal is relatively cheaper given its size, customer base, analyst sentiments, and strong financials."
PYPL earnings report on 2/2/2021Hoping for a great blowout report with bitcoin up so much.
If you don't like this stock you must be a grandparent. If it isn't green by the end of the day I'd be surprised.
Best EVER quarter for account growth! and beat earnings with .69!!
I bought Paypal at 59.
PYPL till i retire.. may just keep it so i can still watch it blast off.
Added another lot @ $246
I buy a few shares every time it dips below $290.00
Pos
"MAJOR OPPORTUNITY ON PYPL, THE FEBRUARY 80 CALL, REGULAR MONTHLY EXPIRATION IS ONLY $5.30. THIS IS AFTER EARNINGS AND YOU'RE ONLY PAYING AROUND $1.50 IN PREMIUM! I OWN SOME CONTRACTS AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT HIGHER. MUST BE BECAUSE IT'S A LOW BETA OR VOLATILE STOCK. You know this shopping season was the best in 12 years, I also have SQ so between the 2 I have a large percentage of digital sales! REMEMBER AMEX IS NOT A CREDIT CARD, IT'S A CHARGE CARD AND NOT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE INTERNET. GUESS WHO CREATED PAYPAL, ELI MUSK AND HE SOLD IT FOR 150 MILLION."
"Also, I'd use tomorrows dip as a buying opportunity"
This is not going to turn red unless market goes down by 2000 points.
PayPal and square are going to be the new powerhouse banks in the future
After hours now showing 4% down. This is all very strange. Wish the computers would make up their minds
Stock just wants to go up heading into a blowout ER.
Am I the only one that actually enjoys flagging all the bubble accounts as spam and watching them disappear?
I love this stock
"Ok, I predicted last week's high of $88, I predicted that we would only get to a possible $91 after the earning report (Sorry the high since the earning came out was only $90.53). So now will you polyanna $95-$100 a share price prognosticators listen to someone who has been in since the stock was $31? What is happening now is no different than what has happened in prior earnings reports. A run up to new highs and then a pullback after earnings come out. The only difference to this pullback as opposed to the others is that the board has OK'ed the $10 billion buyback increase. While I would rather the board issue either a special dividend or institute a dividend payout schedule I understand that this is the continued course that the Paypal board and management are pursuing. So, if you are interested in my prior predictions look back on my posts and you will see my forecasts for the coming year. And yes, I too think we will break $100, just not as fast as many of you want Paypal to. Have a good weekend all and STAY LONG!"
All time high very soon!!
Holding at this level for so long is astonishing! I just can’t figure who or what is holding this back from running. Qual cosa non va!
Selling same w for the 3 month chart
And as usual the aftermarket crowd sell-off on good news...so predictable..
Be a leader not a follower PayPal is number one
People are gonna use PayPal till the world ends lol. They still expect over 20% growth into 2021
B-E-A-UTIFUL!
after hours is all smoke and mirrors / it’s all depends on what the institutions do at opening
"Any thoughts on a Christmas special dividend, $1 to $2 dollars"
2% tomorrow would be enough friends
Let's all buy something today and use PayPal
Congrats Longs...Now lets hang on and move into the 300's neighborhood. It's a nice neighborhood trust me on this...
i read pypl in 5 years the stock price will be 684.00 for one share of pypl
"[serious] why is pypl down today? Not just all the markets are up but payment systems like SQ, V, MA, up bigly."
Goldman Sachs three best tech stocks for 2018 PYPL AMZN and Google. With FB and Netflix also been recommended. Yea baby!
"2020 I am predicting that pypl will be an option for amazon , either way it’s a great stock to have owned since 2015 Everyone have a safe holiday"
"Stock that hit 90, almost always hit 100....."
Venmo rocks.
"You all realize you can still use PayPal through Adyen, right?Thats a win-win for PayPal, getting out of the deal that excludes potential future agreements/partners while still being an option through the future ebay default processor."
Earnings will be a blowout. Think we fly thereafter. IMHO
Investors Business Daily just said today: This is a new entry point 
Crypto is a major game changer...!
Bought some 85 calls recently. volume suggests it will go higher.
I have owned this stock for over four years. In that time the p/e has hovered around 60 the whole time with forward p/e in the 30s. As long as earnings grow the price will also.
"am paying a lot to chinese companies and used PayPal a lot, you know what: the fee is high but the service is so good that I would never change to an alternative. The app is simple to use and I hope that we can soon pay more with PayPal in different stores! great thing"
"reaching new ath, sold off a little this morning, will rally higher all week"
"Barrons - “A key metric, transaction processing volume, did grow 28% on a currency-neutral basis. That is ahead of 27% last quarter, and could be more encouraging to investors.”"
"1 month chart looks good, showing real strength"
I will buy back at $80 for the ride back to $100. Great stock to own long term.
PYPL CEO ... please hire Sarah Friar as your new CFO.
Forget Bitcoin Buy the official and global Crypto in PYPL
Give me thumbs UP if you think PYPL closing >= $100 today or DN if not.
Cramer now screaming to buy pypl after a massive run up and extreme valuation. lol! the top is in. distribution time.
Buy PYPL.
typical market will now short pypl due to its overwhelming success. The market no longer makes sense.
why is it going up today?
price target 450.
$95.00 today before the close.
Will Amazon strike a deal with PayPal? Maybe. I think there is a greater possibility that Facebook might integrate PayPal into their ecosystem (i.e. Payments via Messenger and Whatsapp similar to Wechat Pay/Alipay in China). Note that the former PayPal CEO now works for Facebook so that may lead to an interesting outcome.
"I hope we outperform SQ today, they were deep in the red. If they caught up to us or beat us today my opinion on PYPL will change."

"everyone who sold already once knows this feeling: having sold and seeing the chart going up makes you want paypal again as you know that it is a great company to own as all subsidiaries have huge potential in the future. With tradera in Sweden or wherever they could simply bring the same concept to Europe or America and would push out ebay, old platform and a lot of problems with products ordered"
I don't have any doubt in this company management team. They perform perfect so far and I believe that they have far better vision than any company in this sector. It is a little bit pricy but less risk and high growth rate. It will be cheap in 2018 because of TPV will double in 2018. E commerce and digital payment will be the key that PYPL dominates among peers.

Back to 300. Blue skies ahead longs. All these trash talkers are going to get bars of soap put in their mouths once PYPL is done rallying.
$90 by end of the month.
"I am loaded up to the “gills” on the weekly 250 put options, over $115,000 worth SO let’s pray this hits $200 and I will make over $1.8m"
"Every time a person makes a buy or sell of a cryptocurrency through PYPL, they pocket $0.50 per transaction. What if they allow for more crypto choices to be transacted beyond the 4 currently... I don't think PYPL has ever had this kind of revenue generated before. Let it soak in for a minute... $0.50 per click to buy and sell crypto! I wish I had more shares..."
If rising interest rates help banks....and Paypal is a BANK....a High Growth bank at that...why is everyone selling.
120 soon then 150 total domination of online transactions
Personally I am excited that paypal is entering crypto markets. I’ve been looking into some sleepers like CCX coin. Anyone have suggestions?
I never played PYPL before.. this price is juicy .. just bought a ton of options.. go PayPal go 
The Dropping of Bit-coin will downgrade PYPL to $180.Sell now.
I believe PYPL will announce another deal soon. Just my gut feeling
PYPL investors should look at BFT $13.88 a share. BFT is buying Paysafe from Blackrock and taking it public under their SPAC. New symbol will be PSFE and it's suppose to happen the 1st qtr of 2021. Bill Foley & Blackrock heads will run this payment system. Paysafe is already doing over $100 Million in transactions. BFT is a steal at $13.88. Looking for PSFE will go over $75 to $100 in 2021. Next PYPL is PSFE.
"Missed the low in today's dip, but still added to my shares today. C'mon baby, do your holders right this earnings!!"
Awesome finish. Bodes well going into ER. Blast off from here amigos!
"TSNPD-HMBL will overtake PayPal in 2 years. Do your DD. HMBL has so much more to offer at lower cost to customers plus available starting in over 100 countries. Crypto currency - blockchain- purchasing app. Over the whole world. Going to Nasdaq shortly. Here we come PayPal ,step aside. This stock will be worth more than PayPal in 2 years. Everyone do your DD and check it out. Go to TSNPD and read. You will be amazed all they do and will do . It makes PayPal look like a step/sister. Long and strong, HMBL for life. This is a retirement stock. Not dissing PayPal just want ever to know the potential of this stock. Good luck to all."
People will not return to stores. Too easy and less time consuming to order online.PYPL the future.
"UPDATE : Update to my posting of 20 hours ago: I had written to Ebay in response to their blanket email to their clients that they will be transitioning to Adyen. At that time l told them the move away from Paypal would be very foolish: response from them just now : "" it's a work in progress "" .... nothing is set in concrete.....l pick up that if there would be a major backlash from buyers or sellers they may action some sort of out-clause. In any event, pulling away from Paypal will be to EBay's detriment, not Paypal's."
"We are waiting for the inflation report. Although yesterday a Fed spokesman said that inflation is likely to be higher than forecast. These are rumors. We are waiting for the facts.Buy by rumor, sell by facts))The downtrend is not broken. There was a reversal from 250.Let's see how the market behaves after the reports."
"LET`S GO GREEN FRIENDS - Paypal is ready for the year, Honey Service will definitely be profitable soon if Paypal sends out emails to all customers to download the app... Imagine how many customers would follow... and they all would add to direct margins with the browser application. See you all on the peak"
"PYPL is my last like of the trifecta today and I'm very excited. EA, BOFI already raced very well."
"Cautiously optimistic where we may be headed now. Although futures are green, they can quickly turn. Biden has never laid out an economic plan, so how long will the momentum carry us before the big reversal hits? Time to revisit short term goals. Enjoy the opening surge while it lasts!"
"Thanks PayPal, internet purchase was so easy!!!"
"PYPL going higher from here. Bounce off of daily support level which was an old resistance level in January and March. First touch rejection at 277 level. Will now retest that level in the coming days before earnings, eventually breaking through the contracting triangle apex. No resistance in price after 277. Heading to 310 after earnings."
that took long enough didnt it.
Enjoying the train ride to $100! Keep it going!
Every site if filled with tsnp talk. Check it out.
shall we see 255...........
"If you are a smart investor or long term, see the dips as a rare entry point! Paypal posed for growth and gonna smash earnings next week- trading at quite a discount due to market beatdown yesterday"
strong buy
slow is paypals charm. beautiful
Still slept on! Easily $100+ here soon.
Wow must be 10million buy to cover orders entered below 140. this is going to the moon
Hard to see how we don’t move to and past the price before last earnings
Wonder how high this is going within the next year.
"The earlier high 6 months ago was around 86. The reaction low was around 70, a 16/share drop. With the recent surge to new highs after the 6 month correction, i believe PYPL will rally to 102 before any meaningful correction will occur. A bit ""too symmetrical"", but i've seen this type of thing before. A drop of 16 from the high, a rally of 16 above the previous high. Let's see how this plays out. Either way, new highs are coming and there's definite wind behind these sails. Lets have some fun together! Let's all pick a calendar date which we believe will be when PYPL first trades above 100 per share. I'll go first. I'm picking 9/4/18. GLTA"
PayPal will make new highs. No doubt!
"@LarryTheLegend bwahahah you are here? stop talking. for those who don't know this dude, he is the CEO of terribly wrong predictions. just ask for yourself, ask him what his prediction for NVDA was today. it ended terribly bad for him"
PYPL going to be on Mad money later this week. Good sign for PYPL. buy today or tomorrow
added 3500 shares between 245.70 and 245.99.Thank you thank you...thank you!!
USTechyou certainly don't know what you don't know........PayPal gives me bank bank bank
all time high $200
solid growth BUY BUY BUY
What do you mean you dont own PayPal
PYPL just bought back 12 million shares
"One week after last earnings it went up from 250 to 300 , with this much better earnings we should see 300 again very soon"
i sold ebay at 40 a month ago. it rips off it sellers. I put that money into paypal today. good feeling.
$100 soon
"Honey before getting bought: around 300 M users --> around 100 M dollars in revenue actually 17 mill. active users --> 5,88 dollar per userNow: paypal platform: 305 M active users: around 200 M adopt Honey --> (200+17)*5,88 = around 1,3 billion in revenue"
No way it will go up if ebay moves away from PayPal
So glad I have such a big position in PayPal from a year ago and have years to watch it grow!
BUY it when it is so red again.
"mega safe stock, institutes love it"
Interest rates falling. 10 year down. PYPL hits it out of the park. Multiple upgrades. PYPL on sale today. Bargain.
Thumbs up if you think PYPL will hit $350 this year. Thumbs down if you feel it reaches $300
I see extreme pessimissm out there dont u guys?Stocks down 20-50% in days out there
"Nice little rally before earnings, see you guys at 300"
I have a feeling this week will be positive for PYPL
Bought the fip

"Why is everything that does not say NIO is going to the moon. I posted a couple of hours ago why I am sour on NIO.I told you $PYPL was severely oversold but holding it $200 dayMA. Since then it has bounced up almost $15 and is in the green.$PYPL is still way oversold. I am extremely serious.NIO is not the play, sorry to say my NIO friends."
This is a growing company. A good chance to buying in more.
"Paypal continues to be a payment choice on Ebay at least through 2023. You use a credit card or paypal, just like before. I fail to see what all the concern is over this matter. I think the stock price drop was way overdone."
buying opportunity today
"Can someone please explain why is pypl down? Earnings is right around the corner, and it's still down after all of the good news. They even have a price target of $129. I'm not selling yet, I just need some insight"
"All of the discussion surrounding crypto whether it be ETH, BTC, LTC, DOGE, etc., is all GREAT for PayPal. People are buying and selling all the time in both directions too! Crypto up or down doesn't matter as long as the interest remains! They're making money on the fees and the conversion spread with each and every transaction to buy or sell!"
"120 by friday would be a nice way to end the week, judging by pre-market, it can be done."
Square and PayPal may be new whales in crypto as clients flock to buy bitcoin https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/square-and-paypal-emerge-as-whales-in-the-crypto-market-.html?__source=androidappshare
It'd be funny if we found out Musk used PYPL to buy the 1.5 trillion in Bitcoin.
"$PYPL is nice, but a +1% gain isn't going to change my life. Neither is a -4% afterhours. I'm looking for small caps that have massive upside and by massive i'm talking stocks that could double, triple or more. There's limited availability, so check them our here: https://hotstocks.watch/triple-digit-percent-gainers"
"one of the best companies when it comes to growth year over year, great profits, and people still think it is a good idea to sell? even with this ""market rotation"", paypal will not be used less as you can still make payments in stores with paypal debit and credit cards, they will even increase revenue having the 2 sides of the business live, phisical and online."
For me this is a LONG TERM BUY AND HOLD. I think they are a DISRUPTOR in the way monetary transactions will be processed.
100 billion. Don’t see it stopping here
120 in a month time?
Bitcoin sellers bring ur money here
Paypa P/E seems high but this will decrease with shares repurchase and accelerating profits after each earning report while stock price increase. Btw Paypal uses 30-40 of the free cash flow for shares repurchase.
"If $AFRM does not charge interest on new purchases for 39 months, how does it make ?money?It seems like a great company. Max Levchin, the founder, was founder of $pypl with Peter Thiel."
Wants to go up hard
Do you think i should invest in this?Thanks
"Cramer, “an amazing story, going to $300!’’"
I think we are going back up fam
Paypal rocks.
"Komol... why don’t u take a lovely December vacation to Syria, yfpos."
The iZettle acquisition news just confirms the posting l made here 13 days ago.... just proving : all great things are worth waiting for !
Going up morgan Stanley price target 327$ BULLISH
"PayPal went up 20% in dec at the announcement vaccines will rollout and again early Feb after earnings. Cut the reopening stocks swap #$%$ The announcement of vaccine rollout was the biggest indication borders will be opening soon and yet it went up. This pullback will be temporary. I and many others will be continuing online purchases post-pandemic. It's just much more convenient and the most practical. Airline tickets, travel excursions, airbnb, hotel bookings, etc. ALL online."
ATH this week for my darlings $PYPL $MA $V?  ️ 
"Retail, international, and banking opportunities dramatically undervalued by current share price. Financials are the world's largest sector ripe for disruption. Walk into any Bank of America and you'll see nothing but boomers cashing paper checks. This overhead heavy business model will continue to die a slow death. PYPL is AMZN twenty years ago, straight up. Buy as you can and turn off your screen."
Already up almost a point on P coast..someone likes the earnings and news
What you think guys on PayPal this week and next week.
Crushed it and still more to come!
Paypal may surge 5+ % during the Investors event. So buy now
Buy Buy Buy !!! This will be green !! its all about crypto and vemo....you just need to buy and hold....by tomorow 4 pm..its gonna be 200+
Said it last year and I am still on track... by this year's third year anniversary this stock should be at the $88-$90 range
Here is an infographic showing why serving the unbanked is a massive opportunity for PayPal:https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180505_SRM909_1.png
300$+ stock under 250$Is a jokeBuy buy buy
"Easiest way to visualize HUMBLPay is to think of it as the next Venmo that is faster, safer, and international. $PYPL (Venmo) and $SQ as big as they are, is mostly limited to the US market. Initially, I didn’t think much of HUMBL because I immediately thought “I can just Venmo some in Mexico”. Once you Google “can I Venmo someone in Mexico, you’ll get the following result. The answer is no. You cant"
"PayPal has not rallied much compared to SQ. With acquisitions in sight, I feel that it's still relatively undervalued. Even Mastercard's had a better run. Don't think twice and buy the dips folks!"
green coming
PYPL will be $200 within a year.
helloo???? we are waiting for GREEN
$200 tomorrow
I’m in PYPL. Why does SQ have stellar share price growth execution while PYPL doesn’t (dismal at best)? PYPL business execution is stellar compared to SQ! Is speculation (of SQ) trumping solid (PYPL) reasoning? Any other ideas?
Is Nasdaq on drugs?
"PYPL might be doing very well based on one payment processor data set.""....spending via mobile wallets increased more than 80%, as consumers continue adopting new payment methods.""..https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-friday-brick-mortar-sales-173000853.html""... When paying with a card, consumers chose credit. Fifty-seven percent of card-based spending was via credit card, compared to 43% for debit. Spending via mobile wallets was up 82% compared to 2018 """
"PYPL is trading at a discount rate, and just before blockbuster earnings. I have little doubt that PYPL revenues will be through the roof. Customer base continues to pick up steam and XOOM is likewise growing. Why its dragging despite being a highly recommended buy is beyond me. Buy and hold investors will be extremely well rewarded."
YEA KEEP GOING UP. I’m ordering take out tonight.
"with a cost basis of $85 in an IRA from March 23, 2020 I'm thinking it can't hurt to take out the original investment."
Earning look pretty dark good to me.
"Based on news report, during the past several months, Alibaba's online grocery arm Hippo Fresh, has a revenue jumped 220% YOY. The lack of offline exposure of PYPL, suddenly becomes a big advantage. The purchase shifting to the online world accelerates, and the net result is positive to PYPL actually."
Go green
"Closing in on our 52 week high. Venmo will drive this stock. One of the best strategic acquisitions ever in Fintech. No telling how high it will take them. The sky is the limit. $100 by the Ides of March. Et Tu, Brute."
"No rationale, it moves or doesn’t move (like any other stock) to its own drum. Just have to be patient."
PYPL is undervalued. Back to $100 after earnings.
BREAKING OUT!
What a brutal company for small business. I had to refund a customer for an internet order and this company kept the transaction fee. So if a customer orders from me and then they change their mind I am on the hook for the commission. I've been a long time holder of the shares and have done well. Disappointing that they lack in ethics.
pypl up wonder if it's options related
All the way up fam
did we reach the bottom?>
Earnings beat no doubt in my mind!! See yaa at 200
Bought a lot at $88

"The market makers just use PYPL stock less than 250,000 shares to push the price down 30+ cents then big boys use less than 500,000 shares to lift the PYPL up to the green level. It is not hard for the hedge fund to manipulate price at all. It is very dangerous. I see PYPL should be 85+ this week BUT I can't hope now that it will be as I expect."
pypl only goes up. load.
God bless green!..........
i have been holding pypl since $31.69 i bought 2000 Shares .... this has been very hard to hold. Elon Musk is a smart man.
Is this going to beat earnings or what
A correction for many stocks. PayPal will bounce back. A small bump on a long road.
"For all those doubting paypal and touting square, don't underestimate the ceo of paypal, he is one of the best visionaries out there. Since becoming independent, his execution has been phenomenal. Not to knock square, they are more of an emerging company, I own both for a while, big profits in each"
earring release by 05/05..?
Added more today. Visa as well. In it for the long haul.
just hit 90 please.
This is one of few stocks left undervalued! Its showing its going past 290 soon
Pypl deserved much more!!
Predictable pull back we all knew it was coming don't panic hold firm...........
hmm... looking good!!!
Pypl has a PE of 60 and market says it’s too expensive and pushes it down even though they blow away earnings. SQ has PE of 550 and it goes up $15 after earnings. I stopped trying to make sense of this crazy market. It’s dominated by day traders.
"PayPal is a juggernaut , should be part of any serious growth portfolio , I have visa too . Price target 200 after earnings"
Load up the shares if it drops below $70 tomorrow or Friday. There will be impact due to EBay news in the short to medium term. As a long term shareholder it’s a big surprise. Need to ride the wave :-(
The days for PYPL being below 200 are not long now. Unless I'm horribly wrong the next leg up in the market has begun and the correction has ended. There's a chance we may revisit these levels after the election but I don't pretend to have a crystal ball and neither should any investor. It's hard to predict what the market will do tomorrow much less a month from now. But one thing for sure is that PYPL deserves to trade at a premium.
Longest green run ever- sell. Coinbase is massive competition
Trump speech was excellent. Pre-market jump. It will help PYPL tomorrow.
"The entire payment sector is down. SQ, V, MA. It's not just PYPL"
"The only thing that has changed about PYPL over these last few weeks is the stock price. It is still the same company in the lower 200s that it was at 300. Free cash flow is still going to double in 5 years. That is all I need to know to know the market will reward PYPL for that. That is why it is so important to not sell during the bad times. This company and SQ are extreme disruptions to the way business payments get done...they are the future and forward looking. I own both and have added on the dips. Bitcoin will only be further rocket fuel for them to go much higher. The bad times won’t last forever longs. Fintech is one of my favorite industries and is going to continue to embraced by many small businesses...economic reopening will be a boon for SQ, PYPL, V, and MA. Long and strong."
"year to date + 2.63 % , lold hard"
why does CNBC never show PayPal in the ticker or report any news there is news on India worth reporting what's up with that
"And now PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is planning to revamp its services for the unbanked including offering a debit card, check deposits, and direct deposits into your PayPal account as well as maintaining its consumer loans business. It's aggregating services from several small banks to offer a complete solution for consumers.PayPal COO Bill Ready says there are 30 million Americans without a bank account spending an average of 9.5% of their income on fees from alternative financial services. While services like PayPal's or Square's won't be entirely fee-free, it could save people a lot of money while generating meaningful revenue for either company."
not much movement before the call......everyone on pins and needles? lol
Vaccine wont be available for everyone in 2021 but somehow we are supposed to think this will hurt paypal lolEasy buy.+ 205 by next week.
"Just bought more PYPL, 300 shares at $167.66"
The company plans to heavily invest in its future purchasing bolt on companies. They are a mini Apple with accumulating cash to buy other companies. They approved a very large stock buy back program. I think with what is going on with FINTECH the future is bright for Paypal. I heard someone compare PayPal as one of the future FANG replacements.
Does anyone believe that a major factor for PayPal to jump 8-10% on earnings release would be the number of new Venmo users? I realize they have not monetized it yet.
"Customer buys 1 ETH a $1k... Pypl keeps $20 in fees/spreadETH triples to $3k... customer sells... Pypl keeps $60 in fees/spreadCustomer has $1920 profit. He spends $1k on different sites... paypal keeps roughly $25-30The remaining $920 is transferred back into his account..Paypal has about $105 in revenue off this user. Makes me wonder how hard it'll be to get to $100 ARPU once stocks and other ideas are added into the ""super app"". $100 ARPU at 750 million users is $75B revenue. Seems obtainable to me in the coming decade"
Can I buy now?
"Don’t forget about little Venmo! 6 months ago very few people I knew used it...now I don’t know anyone who doesn’t! College kids, parents, friends, coworkers...everyone!! It’s a great part of the Paypal company!! Looking forward to earnings report!"
Up we go to new highs PYPL
How do you think that billionaire Carl Icahn has sold all of PayPal shares recently and PayPal CEO sold his shares at 74 this month?
here we go! buying opportunity as pullback begins. good time to pick up some shares on broader market weakness.
"I always use the VIX as a contrarian indicator. When it goes up, its time to buy. PYPL going higher"
Come on bulls lets take her back to 350
Earnings nexg week. Buy before of after?
Square has been moving up nicely wonder why we can’t get the same from PYPL. We been in the Doghouse for a while on this one.
"I guess because MGI case fails, makes ZOOM (PYPL) a good chance to grow in China. Western Unions is well known but PYPL is a lot stronger. Another bet for this month, UNH Jan 16, earnings report, good chance to pop up 4-6 %."
"#FastMoneyEspressoFINAL TRADES:Tim Seymour —> buy $EWWSteve Grasso —> buy $GEDan Nathan —> buy $PYPL, buy in the mid-$80sGuy Adami —> buy $SRPT"

Going to wish you bought more.
I use PayPal everyday for my business. Love the app and I hope they continue to innovate with new features.

"CLEAR buy signal now, it left the strong support level that it contested"
CEO said we eBay was holding us back. glad he cleared that up. green.
What happened to 90's AH Big?
Yet the tech sector is not that interesting right now.Weak very weak. On the edge .....But it's not for nothing that Europe bought PYP like that today? Or did they form the shorts with an understanding of what is falling?
Slingshot moveSmall pullback on price then it will launch up into the sky
"I'm buying more PYPL shares today,still has great growth"
Ahhh... sell the news! Love. Business will double by 2025. BUY! Long term hold.
"This is a great buying opportunity ,buy PYPL, Visa. For the long haul."
15 more minutes to hold that $80 level. Yippee. Hold in there PayPal.
PYPL just bought back 1.7 million shares
"Analyst RecommendationsThe current consensus among 42 polled investment analysts is to buy stock in PayPal Holdings Inc. This rating has held steady since October, when it was unchanged from a buy rating."
Crypto worth 1B by 2022 according to Two Sigma
"I see whats going on, cruises and airlines and oil are up 20% this month"
"Sweet, I’m adding another 20 shares tomorrow. I love market overreactions."
"A meh report.. they met lowered expectations. After what happened to Netflix losing their gain with blowout numbers, I would be very careful"
"With bitcoin gapping up so much lately, I believe PYPL will beat earnings easily"
Just bought more for the fourth time and reached my goal of 1000 shares with an average price of 82.64... I now have 1000 shares of PayPal and Alibaba. Both will have earnings announcements in less than 17 hours. God bless to us all...
Regret not buying some pre-market :(
Here I am once again. No better time to sell PayPal for any profits one might have and move to SQ for better growth and you will be able to get more shares. SQ will print $100 a second time before PYPL prints $100. Chuck hunter anonymous bill dennis?
First City Bankers doubling their position.Len Berwick jr. my source.
This situation won't get to normal until atleast the first half of 2021. So Paypal will still accumulate more customers exponentially.
"Been following this for awhile. If it drops below 80 in next few days, I'm loading up."
At least we dont have to put up with all the SQ longs and their bragging
Anyone listen to me at $560 after fake earnings sell short buy put options or are you all still going to continue to call me names? PayPUKE 
"Today PayPal says all users in US can now buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies"

"Liquidating my PYPL on the next up day. It is a shame since this stock has doubled for me in the last year. I have an old account from the eBay days and even have the Paypal Mastercard, but don’t believe in owning stocks that get involved in politics and just found out like Google and Facebook, PayPal is now banning people for political content reasons even though it hurts their own revenue. Will have to move my PYPL funds to SQ."
$300+ by Investor Day announcements this Thursday
"It is way OVERBOUGHT, but who will want to take profit, when MSFT and GOOG are still waiting in the wing. It is really tough decision. I am the one who just bought more PYPL call 78, 79, 80, bet on earnings only, and WILL NOT LET GO ANY OF THE OPTIONS I BOUGHT YESTERDAY until Jan 26."
is this a good buy? Feel like the price are back to six month's ago. Really want start a small position.
Slow and steady!

"Thanks, Gamestop frenzy for the selloff last week I was able to buy Paypal at a discount "
Visa up 8 times since IPO...No reason this can't do the same.
Data breach is driving this down
"Who bought +$13 last night in after hours? In a brutal Bear  market for growth stocks, nothing matters, especially not earnings"
"we are halfway between 52 wk lo/hi. not all time high..great earnings, value in company,deal with Amercan express, holiday season.approaching ..100 is possible in December to remember"
Am mostly staying away from PYPL for now. Rotation and re-open trade is hurting this stock. Earnings will be great but feel like the market will turn sour on company's forecasts.
Anyone buying on the close today? I will pick up 500 more shares
''Ebay snubs Paypal again by partnering up with Square.'' Will just be a buying opportunity if it dips a little on this headline.
I don’t understand why the stock price went up so much and the price of call options ending 4/27 fell? Any thoughts?
Take into consideration that paypal is worth 102Billion while ebay is worth 42Billion. Ebay dropped paypal? More like paypal dropped ebay lol. PYPL is way better off in the future. Buy on the dip tmrw :)
I use my PayPal to buy bitcoins
"If you look at the capital of PayPal, it is double eBay’s cap and eBay is not the single critical customer that can shake up PayPal’s business. It is actually a good time to buy the shares if PayPal."
"All my local automotive stores accept paypal, autozone, advance auto parts, none of them accept square! So tired of people trying to compare paypal to square or affirm. They don't compare."

Buy 250 put options here expiring tomorrow trust me
Buy now before PYPL reports earnings or hold your horses! $90+ let’s goooo
Get ready for the good upside tomorrow
Can PYPL get back to 80+ this week?
"Don't use PayPal for your business...Below is our experience as a small business selling online to make a living.A buyer purched a CookingSet of value $249 from our eBay listing on July 12, 2019 ""buyer eBay ID:cha403-svi0wp2ps, Joe Chambers, North Little Rock, AR 72116"". The item was shipped and delivered on time (July 18) with FedEx tracking record.The buyer filed consecutively to PayPal two cases of ""item not received"" and ""Item not as described"" without any supporting evidence and just buyer's self claims. Obviously, these two claims can't be both true at the same time.Amazingly, PayPal ruled in favor of the buyer and debited the purchase price $249.99 from our account including $20 chargeback. We called PayPal and eBay, both said they can't help. eBay does not want to step in because the case is filed at PayPal, eBay even does not want to send the buyer a message asking to return the item to us. PayPal says it's buyer's cc company decision, not theirs, making every excuse. We pay fees to PayPal and eBay for all sales. When things happen, they all refuse to step in. When society becomes less moral and enforcement/justice organizations choose the easy ways for themselves, the consequence to the society and PayPal are not very nice."
MGI reports earlier than paypal there digital transaction have jump in last couple months
PYPL is resuming its uptrend from here. Still Bullish.
PayPal Opens up Access to E-commerce Platform that’s Already Used by Instagram and Facebook
"PYPL reports earnings on 7/29, my guess is $.91 instead of $.85. Stock goes up $4 or $5 dollars. What are your thoughts"
"Haven't posted here for a while, so just going to remind my fellow investors: PayPal on its last investor day gave guidance that they will be using 40-50% of their free cash (in the billions) to buyback shares. I suspect PayPal CFO John Rainey is on a shopping spree right now."
"PayPal is getting $6.9 billion for its receivables, and recent acquisitions give investors a hint about the future.The company has multiple growth engines, and they seem to be firing on all cylinders.PayPal plans to return 40% to 50% of its cash flow to investors. This should provide a tailwind for earnings for years to come."
Would have been $110 by now had the ebay news not taken place. Glad it is finally hitting new highs. Maybe it can put that behind it now.
I think we may have to fill the trench again. I still have confidence that PYPL will move to 86 + on Wednesday.
How we gonna get to 105 without buyers? Come on pypl longs...i have shares to sell above 105.
"Not sure why people are complaining, 8 cent eps beat is a great report on an undervalued stock..."
Looks like we have our base established and we can mount our assault on $125 from this level. Lot of wise guy money moving towards PayPal. Slow and steady has paid off well for DS and us shareholders. We really are in the sweet spot of Fintech.

$80’s secure onwards to $90. Love this stock. Arriba!
"Paypal is already surging before they start charging for trading crypto. Imagine what will happen with the stock price when they actually start charging fees for trading crypto, buying with crypto and enable users outside the US to trade crypto in 2021. Not to mention that online shopping has increased in Q4 while overall consumers spending has decreased. Even after we get to normal online shopping will be a trend while consumers spending get to normal. Double win here!"

Ready for bounceback!
"I have three college kids. They have grown up with PayPal, and they have not heard of Ayden or any other PayPal competitior. They have urged me to buy and hold PayPal it's very popular on campus. Young people trust and use PayPal, it's the way to pay in the futrue. I now own 2500 shares."
"Get ready for a major recapitulation towards $300. Future markets have opened in a free-fall. Apparently, new mutations of the virus are beginning to worry governments. Add growing civil unrest and the potential for more lock-downs is becoming very real. Expect PYPL to crush earnings again and grab some Crypto along with a few more shares."

The Most Impressive Number From PayPal's Stellar Earnings
What sort of news/announcement do you all think will happen today at $PYPL Investors Day? International crypto? Venmo monetization?
Great volume and price support. Go PYPL...!!!
"RIght now, this is a good price level, but it very well may continue to sell off and hit $203... At 203 the price will be in the value range again and it will get bought up.Long term it's an easy buy. This quarter they will have explosive unbelievable earnings and this is a gift for long term holders... I added more shares to my 401k and will NEVER sell them... Short term, I am chitting the bed as the market is scared right now and all tech is getting beat up, I also have July calls that are leaving skid marks in my underwear they are beat up so bad and I'm now doubtful whether they will make a profit..However, four months in this market is a LOOOOOONG time and I still think after they report a blowout for the current quarter the funds gonna pump it back up... Right now they are shaking everyone out and will scoop the shares back up at a discount"
PYPL should split the stock 3 for 1 and bring in new young buyers. They will also be new customers who will use PYPL services
"SP/18, SQ was @ $100 for a week.MAR/19, PYPL hit $100 for the first time & now @ $145!Think I'll stay with PYPL"

"Upgraded: PayPal is now ""the world's most popular alternative payment option, which leads to further user/merchant adoption"""
PayPal is a huge part of the paperless money that is the future. Some holders panicked and Will be regretting their decision in the morning. It’s so sad to see unsophisticated investors lose their shorts because they can’t handle a single earnings report. PayPal is a winner with the same can’t be said for everyone who owns their stock.
Long-term holders: PYPL can double from this price to $250 in two years!
"anyone have numbers, Please post here."

"Although I investing heavily in square but I do still love pypl (global payment system, leader payment platform online, Venmo), there is place for both. I won’t be greedy, keep both!"
"its coming, be patient, today might be the day or tomorrow, too many good things going for paypal"
"“For Uber and Uber Eats, Venmo had a 300 percent jump month over month from August to September.”"
They beat and fall this is such a joke
Back to 300 eventually so just hold
Any $300 price targets on the street? $SQ does
Nice vote of confidence by the Closing Bell team on CNBC. $SQ $PYPL
Paypal is too late coinbase has the market

PYPL is the better value...period!!!! $95.00 very soon....by Friday!!!
PAYPAL to the moon! Everyone loves and uses paypal! It has become a household name!
prediction: this weekend's news will consist of two subjects: the virus and vaccine commercials.
NFTs taking off and all over the media. Crypto gaining widespread adoption and continuing to grow. It just so happens that PayPal supports purchase of Ether which is the currency driving the Etherium platform and the implementation of choice for NFTs and up-and-coming DeFi apps. Etherium 2.0 to launch this year. PayPal lets you own Ether it with ease!
Don't worry be happy everybody must remember that song... PayPal is a Strong company We'll see what happens this week Up up up away
What’s going on after hours?
ebay just blew it out of the water 
Both PYPL and SQ are the future for money payments and transactions. These are long term holds just like V and MA. Wait for the bottom here and do yourself a favor and pick up more shares. GLTA
Up over $3 before hours? As soon as the market opens it will drop back to 214 which i don't really understand why?
I’d lmao if we close green! 
What are your expectations for tomorrow?
"paypal will be going higher, any chance it will be an acquisition target?"
Lol let’s short a stock 15% off it’s high great idea
The Next PYPL is PYDS. Huge Growth for Years.
Will reach it's all time high in the coming days.........
"""Shifting shopping trends have made PayPal's sweet spot the new normal. That's great news for shareholders. Adobe Analytics is predicting that instead of Cyber Week this year, November and December are going to be Cyber Months. It's forecasting $189 billion in holiday e-commerce sales, a 33% increase over the prior year. Even when the pandemic comes to an end, digital shopping is not going anywhere. PayPal has also done a great job of getting into new businesses. It has acquired various companies to keep it growing in new directions, such as Venmo's popular peer-to-peer payment app and Honey, a price comparison feature. PayPal stock is up 95% year to date. Between its original business and innovative approach to payments, and it should continue to rise in the future."""
"Amazon needed to distract the markets from it's own problems of late. Amazon coming into the payments business is like having a store card from 30 years ago. That concept did not dent the growth of Mastercard and Visa, and this will not stop Paypal. Paypal has a immense presence internationally. This was the same case with Visa and Mastercard. They have grown because of this presence not just the U.S."
Believe in it
IT'S WAY OVERSOLD FOR FULL WEEK ALREADY....TODAY'S GREAT ...GREAT DAY TO BUY THE DIP BEFORE TOO LATE....
A must read for PYPL traders https://lussosnews.com/is-paypal-pypl-the-future/
Class action filing will impact opening on Monday. Will be a good time to buy in on the drop. I suspect overreaction with selling and would be good time to buy up cheap shares.
$350 tomorrow
https://pressoracle.com/2018/07/23/paypal-pypl-price-target-raised-to-101-00.html
We should all try calling Jim Cramer tonight and ask him what he thinks about PYPL
Let the upgrades and coverage initiations begin. I expect PYPL to easily slide past $300/pps short-term.
Watchout ! eBay systematically is crashing the paypal shopping carts and when you call eBay tech support they blame paypal and instruct you to use the new payment form and not use paypal!
paypal will become un restricted when ebay break the bond! the new allowed partnerships will come flying in. why is that bad? people are so sweaty all the time
"ER is around the corner, this is going to be fun!"
"I always wonder if PYPL would try to buy Adyen before Adyen becomes eBay's payment partner. Either way, PYPL is one amazing company."
"Confirmation that trading multiple is good, forward guidance up. That $80 ceiling should now be broken and we should be moving up to triple digits."
"And, in line guidance. So we have a beat on top and bottom lines and in-line guidance and the stock drops $10 after hours. I think some sellers are going to be very sorry tomorrow."
"after watching the price movement today, it seems as if the stock is going to be moving with the price of bitcoin. Which could be a good and bad thing."
Is now the time to buy??
"Just keep buying PYPL at -0.90, I will do it all day long. At this moment PYPL is still cheap."
Is this just the stock being finicky EOD on a Thursday? Is this a pattern it usually follows?
Remember a lot of people collecting unemployment are making more than they usually do if they were working. Spending money hasn’t decreased as much as you would think
losing money everyday the market hits new highs. Don't think I'm cut out for investing
Zoom will propel this stock up. Next stop $150. Steady climber.
"Can't wait for stock trading and people cashing out their crypto gains. Not only will paypal take a chunk of each, but what are people going to do with their gains? Spend it at merchants and paypal will take 2.9% of each transaction!"
When should we load up?
"Q4 ER will be even more amazing, UK, France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal and others are under lockdown/part lockdown, all physical stores are closed, for the first time in History , all Black Friday's , Bachelor's day , and Christmas sales are going On-line"
bought after hours at 174:43. Lets goooo

Wells Fargo Says Buy The PayPal Dip
Just bought 325 shrs of PYPL at $ 88.73 pre market
Earnings estimate of $0.54 and earnings whisper of $0.56. Not much of a beat if it’s accurate. Still impressive though as it’s higher then 2017 Q4 ($0.55) And that’s when everyone spends a lot (x-mas).
Why is it impossible to get a live customer service person with PayPal? All calls tell me to send a message through the website. If I could log into account I would not need to talk to you. Changed phone number and thought I changed it on all accounts that send text verification code but either I missed my PayPal account or it needed to be changed at another spot. Did somehow manage to reach a point that I was allowed to have PayPal call me back. They do in about 2 or so hours and had to select #1 to let them know I was on the line. Then a silent insured until after about 2 minutes it when to disconnect. Can't seem to find that series' of prompts and get a call back.Any help
"Two world icons fell to PYPL on Friday - Mastercard & Disney.Walmart, you're next. Then onto you JNJ."
Closing in on the 52 week high.......
This is def a gift right now. I loaded up as well
"Hate being right, but I told you so......52 week high today????"
Anyone buy +$13 last night or RED by the open? I warned ya all 1000x
Bought in an hour before ebay news. It feels good to be here finally
Anyone buying pYPL at these prices
PayPal is up 4.90% to 115.14
What time are they going to announce the report today? Anyone knows?
company is brilliant
Why are people selling Paypal when Bitcoin price tanks? Bitcoin is here to keep surging. Some correction is normal. At the same time the more volatile Bitcoin price is the more transaction which is good for Paypal.
"Conference call quote: “These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies,”"
Wayfair up 23.69 percent on sales. l have never bought from them but I checked their website and Papal button is on the cart.
"Ready to gut it out for the long haul. The business model is great. The projections are awesome, and management will be continuing an aggressive share buyback program.I guess I will have to hunker down for a while, but when people realize Jerome Powell is not a great communicator, and the Fed will take care of the market and be fine, things will right themselves. Powell is committed to this as is Treasury Secretary Yellin. Powell is a poor communicator, but he will do what is right, and the market is a safe haven. Everyone wanted a pullback to get in, well here you have it. And don’t forget the market is your only option and the Fed will not let it get damaged with all of the nation’s pension funds tied to it.$PYPL is a bargain and a great place to park it until we move forward on the macro level.Stay long and strong.Good luck all."
Why PayPal is going down ?
wonder which hedge funds drove the stock down then loaded up like its 1998
"Hey Big are you related to Jack, Amy, Andy or Tony?"
nice pre market
"This is basically a bank that trades like a tech company. I Love it!No short squeeze here. Although according to Wallstreet Bets IPIX is ""poised for a run""."
Great news with google. Shows how google knows how good PayPal is.
BACK TO ATH!
Looks to me like all the tech names are building a base of support including PayPal
Why not own both Square and PayPal? ;)
it's coming back now.
Green today!!!
BACK UP!
"Dont feel bad, Visa had a beat across the board and they are down almost $3 ah....thats what stocks do, they go up and they go down. Unless your a short or day trader hang in there PYPL will be back soon"
This is positive. Bump
I invested in Redhat back in the 60's . This is a company that was gobbling up all these smaller cloud play companies left and right and I just felt they had a plan. And boom. It payed off. I see these s same thing happening here.I believe they know exactly where this whole global payment industry is going and know exactly what it will take to own it.
"Here we go once again, but this time PYPL has smashed through several technical resistance levels. Fully expecting to see the 220 level by Monday, then the run to 230+. Analysts say there is a lot more room to run, so prove the analysis right!"
hotels.com now has paypal option
downward pressure on a day like this makes my head spin
Just added 800 shares
"Hedges trying to get every last dime you have, manipulate to think maybe the bottom has hit (green) then back negative so people sell"
"Pretty soon its going to break $90, when that happens say good bye to 2 digit stock price, you'll never get it again under $100."
No sleep for the shorts tonight. Looking for a 10% pop tomorrow
Any ideas when $PYPL will take DOGE? That will be a game changer.
"PYPL is screaming today, after two big blocks at 9:30 and the Hedge fund article. Buy- Bullish"
isn't telling us
My guess is $82 after report
If ebay was well run it would be Amazon. Meg Whitman is most over rated CEO ever and it looks like she left a few turds in her wake. Now she is on the board of PG causing me troubles there
"Ayden is not newsworthy enough to tank Paypal. How many years will it take to even be credible? People do not switch from Netflix to Amazon Video just because it is there. So why would someone switch to Ayden just because it exists now on Ebay. Do people just switch their bank because another bank comes to town. By the time people even learn how to pronounce Ayden Paypal will have found other revenue streams. Apple pay could not challenge Paypal, does Ayden really sound like it can? Paypal was part of Ebay, and it knows how to compete in that market. It has economies of scale and could even make a price war for Ayden. I would be more concerned about Ebay getting back into the payment business. As it could not do this right last time and spun Paypal off."
"look no further than a stock market that is maintained at flat to slightly up and rarely allowed to go down much. seems unprecedented. seems the only buyer is the bank. smart investors have gone to cash, gold, silver."
It seems like solid earnings were priced in across the board on these big tech stocks...
"PE of 67 cannot be justified for a stock at the center of 3 major paradigm shifts: Democratization of money, crypto revolution and cashless society movement. Whoever have been selling for the past 2-3 weeks simple do not know what they are doing."
"Great day, PayPal will go higher today :) GROW exploding. GROW is going higher higher big time. Patience :)"
Anyone in PYPL at $215 fake crypto news? Be honest?
Everything about the market and economy right now is built for paypal to win every timeThese are ridiculously discounted prices considering this drop is entirely based on market panic surrounding stimulus and the election...An obvious top quality buy.How many online business models have been started to shifted to since Q2 ended?This will breakout following election if not be one of the only breakouts during the election...
Big bid orders little to no Asks....smart money holding the shares!
Panicked selling...gotta love it
Anyone else surprised PAYPAL isn't higher by now? Recovery is slow here.
Super powerful beast!
"Will be interesting to see if PayPal gives some insight into newly minted Bitcoin revenue in this next Quarter after the rollout last month. This is the golden goose. No matter if Bitcoin goes up / down PayPal makes $$$ on the transactions. Increased btc volatility? Increased retail transactions, increase in revenue. Win win."

Triple bottom in PayPal at the $230 level. Could see the climb to $250 next week
Can it still go up tomorrow?
Analysts downgrades coming. One analyst either JP Morgan or GS hung the phone up on the CEO. Simply amazing.
"Don’t expect anything big, just opening green would be good"
"Daddy Cramer tells me to buy PayPal, so I buy PayPal. He's just trying to make me some money, right?"
Earnings soon. how do say cha-ching bada bing...
Profit from crypto trading will bump this sp way up. The fees are substantial but Paypal won't make your money disappear like some other online brokers.
"Last time I told the Ben Carson died rumor story it got top reactions, but I didn’t disclose that it came from PayPal management.This time it got deleted. Gotta do my self checks you know. "

It will happen again and this time it might be the big one!"
Any thoughts on the last 30 minutes of trading? Buy back in or is there more sell off ahead?

"this is great and never a doubt. but sadly if AAPL and AMZN are any indication, tomorrow morning it will be red."
PYPL down on announcement by Facebook for new effort at fintech by launching their digital currency backed by real currency. I think Facebook will run into a lot of problems with their attempt.
Kathie Wood has been loading up PYPL nonstop on her ETF funds.Looking forward to seeing PYPL trading above $300 once again.

"Most of the big cap stocks already extend PE, but PYPL should go even higher. Schulman's interviewed at DAVOS "" MASSIVE MOBILE PAYMENT IS ABOUT 50% OF E-COMMERCE, PYPL OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS FROM THE TAILWIND"" I figure it out that PYPL will beat the #$%$ of the estimate big time."
I'm going shopping tomorrow
Great company
Congrats ro everyone that bought or held on the Amazon news. You make money when you buy not when you sell.

Bernstein reinstates coverage on PYPL with an Outperform rating and a price target of $297
"PayPal price target raised to $205 from $170 at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry raised the firm's price target on PayPal (PYPL) to $205 from $170 and keeps a Conviction Buy rating on the shares as he raised his 2020-2022 revenue estimates by 6% per year on average and increased his adjusted EPS view 12% per year on average to reflect a sustained acceleration in the consumer shift to online payments as well as market share gains. Terry points to intraquarter user acquisition metrics, such as app downloads, as well as third party data tracking on e-commerce, and intraquarter data from companies such as Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) as evidence that PayPal is benefiting ""meaningfully"" from e-commerce acceleration, particularly in the U.S"
this is the dip we wanted
"PayPal price target raised to $275 from $234 at Deutsche BankDeutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane raised the firm's price target on PayPal (PYPL) to $275 from $234 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. A survey of 817 U.S. mobile tech-savvy participants indicates the adoption of e-commerce and mobile payment services has accelerated, Keane tells investors in a research note. Deutsche's survey highlights the increased ""secular shift"" to online payments and higher engagement with FinTechs, particularly PayPal and Venmo, as well as better penetration and adoption of digital financial services for Square's (SQ) Cash App, says the analyst. He sees FinTechs expanding further into traditional financial services, taking share from incumbent banking models."
Stock is back in beast mode a la last season’s spectacular returns. This year will be even better. $100 here we come Amigos.
Good stock LONG!
PYPL is 10 steps ahead of the others
PayPal up $$7.46 yesterday... just in consolidation mode today before heading to $300 and beyond... PayPal onward and upward!
"I've held pypl since the split from EBAY, it's done very well but : I think they should split the stock to reward shareholders and/or pay a dividend, maybe once a year. what do you guys think ?"
"Has anyone seen this video, of how PayPal might be the next Reddit trade action? It was on Fast Money News on CNBC yesterday 2/11. Paypal had to reach $300 today for some reason at close it was around $298 and reached $300 after hours. I hope the link works and you can view the video. If not try to find it, it's interesting. Please comment what you think."
Weak hands. Sold it at the bottom. Almost insulting. Now it will start moving up. Bloody markets.
Potential $209 price target
Did yall heard of the news - PYPL will increase Venmo fees. Does this going to look good for PayPal ?? Any input on this matter?
boy oh boy what an afternoon. i decided to risk it and bought some PYPL calls right before market close and i am glad i did!!
Good job longs.
Up big in AM. By tomorrow it will be negative. Just like every other tech stock in Sleepy's world.
"last buy was at 190, held strong to 310, down to 230, now at 240...thinking this just might be the time to add, before heading back towards 300. Bonus growth tailwinds- $PYPL will benefit from this NFT adoption taking place."
paypal only goes up right now
"Just throwing this out there.. a ton of Shorts are betting on a sector rotation out of tech, but with Covid spiking and shutdowns coming back, many institutions arent going to rotate just yet. Shorts could get burnt hard on this bet causing tech stocks to make another leg higher. Many analysts are saying the vaccine is priced in with the huge drop last week so the Pfizer news may not be as big as some shorts think. My two cents."
ATH for $PYPL $MA $V what a lovely end of the week
Buy here! Do not sell. You will regret it.
Breaking News fellow longs! PaySafe is going public via spac-BTF Expect a run up in the following weeks. CNBC's Steve Grasso said Friday after close that BTF will double or triple. Only at $14Check it out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0BC7uaViAs&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision

"PYPL closing over 79 for the first time. New high or not, that's a great sign. Likely to move up to 80 on Tuesday. Momentum is back and traders are positioning themselves for another good earnings report. Should provide fireworks later in the month; uptrend solidly intact and the overall market still very bullish. More upside coming!"
Easy 90 tomorrow
PYPL reached a new All Time High at 80.20
"""Analyst expects an upbeat preliminary forecast for 2021 when PayPal reports earnings Monday""More affirmation from the 40+ analysts covering PYPL with predominant buy/overweight recommendations. Today, I again heard from a trustworthy source, that PYPL earnings are ""jaw dropping,"" and I take that to mean in a very positive way. PYPL has been capitalizing on the COVID-19 surge towards digital banking platforms and now seeking a major footholds in crypto. If there is one company I would think hedge funds and savvy investors are rolling over in to or doubling down on, it is PYPL. I won't be popping any corks yet, as this market has gone psychotic and who knows short-term. Again, be an investor and not a trader. GLTA next week!"
“the stock is forming a triangle pattern with support around $73. Relative strength shows a favorable divergence as PayPal bounced off support. The upside could be beyond $80 if the stock bounces off $73 support in the next few days.” -Forbes
I knew I shouldn't sell! I knew it the whole time!
"According to conference call PayPal already has 18 million merchants on the platform. PayPal is now free to add Ebay competitors like Amazon and Walmart. Potential grow is now unrestricted, what's not to like. Potential growth is unlimited."
Record high intraday point gain in PYPL history! New record highs going into earnings. Just need to get this Corona fear and hysteria behind us
Bought @ 77 missed 75- ****
"Adyen is a competitor to PayPal and they reported this strong growth this week and rallied. Good omen for PayPal!Adyen posted first-quarter revenue of 135.5 million euros, an increase of 34% from a year earlier.Shares of the firm rose 9% Tuesday, making it the best performer of the Stoxx 600 index.CFO Ingo Uytdehaage said the company has seen a “huge pickup” in online retail volume."
Now that the big EBAY ball and chain has finally been taken off.The Monster Growth machine can fly to the MOON!Look out.
"When someone buys or sells bitcoin from via PayPal, does PayPal get to keep the service fees and exchange fees to themselves?"
Still a buy?
Well bad news is I got in at 259.Good news is I haven't added yet.I don't see support till 229 ish.But am tempted
"Some thing is coming to the wire, I did not see yet. It got to be big news otherwise PYPL does not pop up like this."
wasnt it 10 minutes ago this was the darling of wallstreet?And they get paid how much?
AND WE ARE green skrrrr
Have just used PayPal to pay some bills. Seems awfully expensive. I'm not understanding the benefit of using it except for payments to friends and family. Premium seems way too high. What's the attraction?
"I should have added more in the 250's, but i got greedy thinking it could hit 230's again. $500 eoy, mark it!"
"I knew PYPL was good stock, but also know that you can't put everything into 1 stock.Great stock. I regret not putting in more but don't regret not putting in less : )2-4 years 200 billion market cap. Just like Visa, MasterCard and others. They will keep going up as long as people are spending and economy is good."
"Buy the dip, guys!!!"
Sold at 80. Whatever thanks.
$TSNP ( HUMBLPAY ) gonna be the next PayPal.app comes out this month and will be available in 100+ countries check it out!
Did you buy the open gift dip???!!!
This is just the big boys playing everybody like a fiddle.....long and buying more at bargain prices....
Come on need $200 or less to net $1.8 on my 250 put options expiring Friday. I know I will make good money  but just don’t know how much
CNBC guest just said PYPL is way undervalued!
Donnie Pugatch has new target of $350 per share.
"I wish people on this page would stop acting like it's a zero-sum game regarding PayPal and square. There is more than enough space in the fintech industry for them to succeed as well as others. They're not even doing the exact same thing, however PayPal has a much longer history and actual earnings."
"Aww, KevPuke quiet......"
Nice - well on our way to break $100 by fall.
Last chance to get in under 80
With the amount of free cash flow Paypal is sitting on they have the ability to adapt and carve out new opportunities in the fin-tech industry another aspect that has been overlooked by many. Square is experiencing great growth but doesn't compare in terms of the metrics that paypal has. Paypal is still #1 in the fintech industry and besides the drop today due to mostly the market itself (not the silly downgrade) it will continue to slowly grow.
wow whats going on AH
Finally some good news with crypto
Price rose and closed above the 50 dma...
PYPLwill be above 266 tmr!️️️
yahoo deleted all my posts.
Has a great chart setup. Has room to run to 84.00
Cmon. Give me $90
"pretty foolish to short one of the stocks at the center of a paradigm shift. Whether it's EV, ecommerce or online payments, the world is digitalizing. It's proven paper money is one of the biggest contributors you spread disease like covid. There may be people out there who don't believe the effects of covid but the majority is willing to adapt to contactless means of payment. I live in a major city (Vancouver) and most people, if not all, opt in for contactless payments. This practice will be brought forward into a post-pandemic era. It comes pretty close to reinventing the wheel.$PYPL $V $MA"
Not good down on day of evening's reports
The dip is profit taking. Hold.
"Hey everyone, I've been here for a while since 170, with only one share (because I'm only 15  ), but I see the potential here and am gonna continue holding for a few years. 300 is coming in the coming months, vaccine or not. Stick around!"
Now that we broke thru $115.95 next resistance is $116.70 Buy Buy Buy
I called it would reach 90 before end of month when i bought at 82 3 weeks ago :) Very Happy!!! Will break 100 by end of next month!!! Review my notes!!!
watch this space.......Paypal and Square will be the new FANGS in the next decade....
I just bought some...great opportunity!
Tech is getting routed! I have a small position in pypl. Waiting for an opportune time to back up the truck.
"Strong volume. If your considering taking a profit today, you could regret it."
Would love to see this split 5 for 1.
they are confident their revenue will grow stronger than expected. buying more
PayPal owns Venmo. Venmo is catching on quick. Its time to buy
Anyone listen to me last night sell $260+ get short then buy the weekly 250 put options for like .60 this am went right to $5 will be $10 after Square falls $50 tonight
It’s testing $80 and falling back down. Watch for a technical breakout if it goes past $80.
Solid price action today. Slow and steady to $100 a share.
Strong buy!
Give me a new 52 week high tomorrow $PYPL
the roller coaster called the stock market.
I received an internal email from eBay regarding this Ayden deal. I've tried 3 times to post it but apparently Yahoo keeps deleting it. Not sure why.
Hopefully it will a good day tomorrow. Management provided a disappointing forecast for 1st Q 2018
Really high on PayPal!!
It will take at least another 3 months until a vaccine is officially approved so the online shopping party is not over yet.And the end of covid will not affect Paypal alot as consumers are already accustomed with Paypal payments. This trend will continue.
"This company is amazing and the earning reports excellent, but this quarter trend, they sent all the stocks down no matter how excellent earnings are, we got this trend by MSFT earnings. But I am bullish on this great company."
"added more today, am concerned that earnings will be better than expected"
Paypal firing on all cylinders... onward and upward !!
let's call JIm Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PYPL. 1-800743 2622. Don't forget to buy something and use pYPL
"“...Susquehanna’s Jamie Friedman notes that PayPal will now be free to court other retailers, including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.28% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -5.10% which it couldn’t do under the eBay deal. These would “dwarf the loss,” he wrote. Friedman rates PayPal’s stock at positive and upped his price target to $87 from $85.”"
"Breaking: Piper Sandler starts PayPal with Overweight rating, $210 targetPiper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat initiated coverage of PayPal with an Overweight rating and $210 price target. PayPal is one of the best positioned companies to take advantage of changes in consumer purchasing behavior due to the pandemic, Donat tells investors in a research note. The analyst views the company as one of the better earnings growth stories in the payments space and recommends building positions at current share levels."
"There were a lot of ""investors"" betting PYPL would dump. The dumps on the betters now. Holding steady."
More to come
Anyone buying PYPL today? Whats your thoughts.
Anyone listen to me last night +$13???? Short and buy weekly put options at the open up 500%
300 is here!!!!! Congrats PYPL longs we are drowning in cash. 400 will be next then 500.
"I guess PYPL will hit 85+ on Friday. Daniel Schulman gave us a huge body language that PYPL will hit the high note on Jan 31. PYPL has big MOJO on the right time. I will let the far east number on Jan 31, 10 min. before the market close."
Buying opportunity!!!
Stock is heavily undervalued
Someone pushed the wrong button during online trade?...
I feel like every single person on this board now hates eBay lol
Time to buy more PYPL
"fun fact... first time utilizing bitcoin was in Florida in 2009 and was 10,000 coins for 2 enormous pizzas. assessed worth of those 10,000 coins today is over a half billion. dollars...and I'm living in the bullish side of the world because of @ Kathlynmoorefx1 on telegram"
Countdown toward next ER began yesterday and blowout results are likely that will head us toward ATH and to $350 by the following ER. You heard it here first !
"Considering the turmoil in Asia right now, these results look really good. If things turn around in China, PYPL will blow out their projections for the year."
"Crypto sales worth a Billion by 2022, according to Two Sigma, strong buy...."
300
This will be back to 115-120 soon 
Strong support at $105
I love paypal
Look at PYPL rally!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
Long and strong
I am quadruple short $177 and redoubled down $307. About even. You can never lose if you short a bloated company like this ever just stay patient and keep doubling down leave money in cash
Tested $86 but couldn’t hold. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it test $86 again. For sure tomorrow.
"It looks like PYPL will open where it started yesterday morning. Considering the earnings beat, this is disappointing. The stock was over $300 a couple of months ago so the momentum in tech certainly seems to have disappeared. PYPL is still one of the best growth stocks in the market and doing it well without the baggage of Ebay."
Let’s go nice W chart highs coming back EOD
Great earnings tomorrow evening...into Thursday morning at the open.$95.00-$100.00.
PayPal pays us Pals.
I’ll be loading up on PayPal at $170. Keep selling I’ll buy your shares
What do you think of PYPL for tomorrow?
"JPM Chase to shutter Chase Pay.“As Chases discontinues its service, it is pushing users toward PayPal. “$PYPL just another notch on the belt of a string of successes. This stock will erupt to the upset, well before quarters end.Short term Buy. Long term Buy and hold, crown jewel of any portfolio.."
"Got to love how PayPal touts its ""best quarter"" record ever in history!.. Market punishes it! Beats expectations both top and bottom line!Bizarre world!!"
"It is very healthy pull back. PYPL reverses so fast with heavy volume, that make me believe that now PYPL will move with the MOJO."
more will get into Bitcoin too!!!
"Breaking: Barclays raises PYPL price target to $199 (from $169) maintains OverweightBarclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $199 from $169 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The payments environment has evolved in PayPal's direction, such that the company is less constrained by having to fit into the existing value chain, El-Assal tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes COVID-19 is accelerating existing point of sale trends that were already supportive and that PayPal rightly sees the current environment as a one-time opportunity."
I think WMT needs Paypal
"“The Venmo card, a physical debit card linked to a Venmo account that PayPal unveiled this summer, is also off to a strong start. It saw a roughly 320 percent month over month growth from August to September.”"
Nice after hours action. Up over $4
buy if you want to make some money

What do u think about today guys?
Partnership announced with American Express. AMEX users will now be able to receive and use AMEX rewards points through PayPal.
"Why would I use Venmo to buy stuff when I can use my credit card which give me rewards point and delay paying the debt at later time. Most of these kids don’t have money, tell them to buy expensive cloths with raw cash is no game changing!"
I'm up 40% on PYPL. Earnings should knock it out of the park!!!!
"This is one of the best performing stocks in my portfolio, and I only got it because I owned EBAY when it spinned it off. Talk about getting lucky."
250 today maybe more
Good Earnings. So the stock will tank in 2 days!
PayPal train leaving the station. All aboard! March to $80 has begun.
Another upgrade! Still see this easily hitting $300 in the next 3 QTRs. Momentum today should realize a 3-4% gain today at minimum. I just can’t place my finger on what is holding this back for so long. Enjoy the growth!
A good price level to start buying is in the range $225 - $175 a share. The summer sell-off should provide an opportunity to start a position at a sensible level.
The call must be good because the stock is rising 
"Everything I’m seeing we had solid earnings, but what’s up with this article? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-31/paypal-forecast-falls-short-of-estimates-amid-strong-competition"
SQ is up 10% almost and this didn’t move a needle?
"i was off by a day, or a few hours in the market. I said 250 early this am. Looking like 250 comes Tuesday. Nice hold by the Nasdaq today at key levels. no reason, ZERO reason to sell Paypal here."
Why is it that PYPL most o the time is in red (pre-market) &&SQ is in the green (pre-market).Shouldn't PYPL be higher because of earnings around the corner & 3 Positive buy/outperforming ratings. Don't understand why we are almost neck& neck with SQ.
Uh oh.... PYPL over $300!
The bank of the future!
"Paypal will be a $1Trillion co in 10 yearsStill cheap now $1,000 in a decade"

"Boy, I just MUTED those alias with ""BUBBLE"", ""OVER-VALUED"" with all caps. This msg board looks so much cleaner and better. I will suggest you to do so as well ... nothing but noise! lol"
"So...this might sound bad but I juts finally opened a PayPal account. What I have found out is this service is clearly the best out there. They are working with banks not competing with them,working with google (can pay through Google Pay or even GMAIL) and its so easy to use. You can put all your accounts and cards in one place and transfer money to and from where ever. GLOBALY!The one thing I would like to see is a marketing blitz as I can be the only one that doesn't think about using PayPal .They also need to emphasize their superior security.The key to this is user growth like everything else and these types of services have a long way to go. This is the only option for online shopping if you're educated about what it is ."
Numbers are not bad at all
PayPal has its mojo back. Let's go to $100 boys.
It's right at support. If it doesn't hold....
"To everyone - BEST to MUTE Harold. He is an internet troll who does this for ""fun"""
Pypl tends to open hot. Lets see what it does mid-day.
"My opinion, It's going to hit the ceiling at?$268 for today until Monday."
"After seeing this investing in stock market doesn't make sense any more. Trading is the only way to go. Fundamentals of a company doesn't mean anything anymore.Look at the numbers of amazon and the huge drop afterwards. Amazon beat the numbers again big time and the strongest quarter is ahead of them and Amazon lost nearly 15% in a few days. Tesla one of the most overvalued stocks ever would have been up 30% up with beating consensus by miles like paypal did. Why should someone invest in stocks anymore when you just need to buy and sell before earnings. Why go through all the ups and downs holding a stock long time when you just need to buy and sell before earnings. I am pretty sure if paypal had failed big to meet expectations stock would be up huge afterhours. And paypal have not only lost afterhours big, paypal lost already in the last few days 20% and also for no reason. This is not a normal correction, this is a small crash."
Just Believe
This is all sleepeeezzz fault...
Huge growth potential in China
This is trading all of the way down to early 2018 prices. Oh wait...it’s still early 2018.
We should all buy something and use PayPal. Lets call Cramer tonight and get his thoughts. 1 800 743 2622
"Ready to buy this dip. Please bash it down to 235. You all know after the smoke clears there is too much greed for Pypl the jewel, to not be the crown jewel of most investment firms. Short fools don’t have much time left here."
Many companies have suffered data breaches this does not mean they are no longer good investments. Paypal is a solid company and will solve it's issues.

Very nice. Should sell off a little then move higher going forward
I just bought $90 call for September today at the close I think should be $100 by them
$106.70 tomorrow
"It is rotation again because the retails , banks are in green. Tech sector just pulls back a little, but as soon as the house votes, it should come back again. I don't think the big boys will back out 2 quarters ahead. You just have to understand all the FANGs are near high, so give back a few points should not worry much, particularly PYPL, which is still higher than Oct price. The price range should be 75-78 by first week of Jan.and wait for firework on earning date."
$80 soon... it’s taking long enough
https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/paypal-temasek-pine-labs/
"Back in on the dip in to the 230's. I had sold out of disgust, but the low levels are too tantalizing. Caught wind of some announcements that are forthcoming, so I'll accept the risk. Here I go again!"
Well no ones talking of the news that you can now buy crypto on counbase using PayPal
Get ready to buy
Held $82. Well PYPL. ————> $90 soon!
"PYPL is going to beat earnings, it’s just a matter of if the market will try to hold them back or if there will be support followed by other growth/tech companies"
Najarian brother on CNBC fast money pumped this on the show. Visa and banks down and this up with a 52 PE. and at all time high. This stock is being pumped by hedge funds.

"Apple pay cash came out and I don't know if that's why paypal fell back today after a 2% pop, but it really doesn't affect paypal value going forward imo. venmo still growing faster"
"Buying the dip, PYPL long-term undeniable huge winner, in so many ways. Bought at $40 years ago and as long as it grow at +20% per year, no reason to ever sell."
Stock coming back. Long story short it was a great ER and always that will carry the day. Now go cut a deal with Amazon Schulman and the stock will double.
shes coming back up!
I feel sorry for the shorties. Lolol
What a day!
$209 area is our price target for nowhttps://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/let-s-look-at-paypal-ahead-of-earnings-15384075?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
Do you think PYPL will be up post earnings? Thumps UP for higher stock price and Thumps DOWN for lower stock price.
"This dip is painful the last couple weeks. I assume Ark selling os a lot of the downward pressure. I cant seem to see a fundamental reason for them not to destroy estimates again. Now, it’s worth noting that might not be enough to move the needle (see Apple). If the user growth is strong and QR code’s and Crypto numbers are good this should pop. GL all, wish I could buy more but call heavy and leaking money at the seams."
"PYPL eyeing StoneCo ltd is possible reason for Buffets interest in PYPL. Considering Buffetts substantial investment in StoneCo and increased interest in FINTech, this may be setting stages for eventual future PYPL-SQ deal. The answer to where crypto fits in may be in each company’s vision statements Just trying to put the puzzle together."
Reported that PayPal dominates about 70% of online payment processing and amazon 11%..just wow wow!
I see this at 130 by the end of November.
"had to buy more at 73.08, thanks for the dip"
"Don't be fear.Before ER, PYPL will drop to $240 suddenly without reason."
PayPal has been in a healthy consolidation mode the last few weeks. Expect it to ramp up into the $280’s by this time next month as we approach 1st quarter earnings.
translation of revenue lowering: full on economic collapse globally
Solid among the noises!!! Great stock to buy!!!
"paypal wont be a 100 bagger, we all know that, but if you want to turn say $250,000 pension into a $1 million pension in 3 -4 years, it is one of the safest and growing stocks with excellent liquidity."
"Not typically THAT guy, but RIOT has 9 million shares short right now and it looks like a huge short position is covering before earnings. Could drive a short squeeze for any of you into that type of trading."

In for the long term $$$$$
$PYPL needs some good news to push forward. At least it’s developing support lines at $80
They beat wall street expectations and the stock dropped. I told yall the market is fixed!!!
PYPL price is being driven lower so gains from upcoming earning report can be re-directed away from investors who are long. I'll be moving out of PYPL now that I'm certain PYPL is too comfortable to notice that SQ is out in front and Stripe is coming up fast from behind. PYPL should be at $94-$96 right now and above $99 surrounding the earning report.
This will absolutely drop after earnings no matter what but someday this will shine again.
"Thank you Musk the market manipulator, my pypl stock goes up :)"
Venmo numbers up 80% year over year. Beat on all numbers.
Seems to be following the DOW. Expect this to continue unless new or unexpected news comes out.
Too late to jump in? Maybe with a premarket order which will actually buy at opening price?
"PYPL is a bargain with a forward P/E ratio of 52.68 in comparison to the industry's average Forward P/E of 82.44. If PYPL breaks projected earnings predictions, expect a significant spike up and a runaway train well in to next year."
"I worked for PayPal for over 16 years and while I expect good numbers after market close, I'm more concerned with the 'wording' that often accompanies the report. Can't tell you how many times the CEO/CFO reported great earnings only to cause the stock to stagger by issuing ""cautious future statements""."
$275 after americans xmess spending is reported
this is crazy PayPal should not be down
I personally used PYPL and bought a ton of stuff while quarantine and I believe PYPL will report solid ER and forecast would jump due to more users and more company adding PYPL option to their stores like WMT. I guess that's why so many firms are upgrading this stocks target to $140 and above.
To the moon baby!
77.77?!! OMG!! What a number!
"Great quarter, should be up a lot at open. Many of the new users acquired during lockdown will stay on PayPal."
what's thi class action lawsuit filed against PYPL today?
In beast mode again today!
"If you think about it, PYPL could still be heavily undervalued. Its stock price had reached $120 as far back as July of last year. It swooned for months and took until Feb 2020 to retake the $120 level and set a new high of around $124 before the covid 19 thing hit. Given the shift toward electronic currency, covid 19 should prove to be positive catalyst for PYPL. So forget about the old high of $124, tack 15%-20% on top of that to get a feel for where the new highs will be set."

Partnership with all sports betting venues will have a substantial impact on PayPal....$100 coming.......
No one is selling at this price. Green today when the rest of the market is red.
buy buy buy. gonna rock $100
"Im am very excited about this market rotation right now and if you are long PayPal you should be excited as well and here’s why:PayPals growth story has only got better every quarter in the last 12 months. As big money rotates out it gives people who have been in this stock for years a chance to start buying back in at an awesome discount. I will be allocating a majority of my investment money every 2 weeks into PayPal and square. These are $1,000 stocks in 3-5 years. Businesses crushed by COVID Won’t get that money back. Everyone isn’t going to come back and spend 3-4x the amount of money to make up for the money they didn’t at brick and mortar. That money is gone forever. It’s been funneled into tech."
PYPL maybe taking a pause. Get ready to buy.
Great earnings!! Will definitely be red by end of the day and probably daily for a week....
"A huge beat and it goes down. Typical fashion, however there is always a major reversal shorty thereafter. We expected to see a few raised price targets, yet not in the low 300’s. I (and the circle) believe PYPL to be way undervalued, and stick to a more realistic $400+ intrinsic valuation. Patience is the play of the day and accumulate."
pretty crazy that paypal/venmo and square have dropped so much...they are the top finance apps in the iOS app store and google app store
"Stocks which rise always get pushed down by market makers. Nothing has changed, and those who sell on no reason other than a dip are handing money to institutional l traders, PayPal's growth story is far from over. It is just beginning, in India and other large economies."
"This is why you tune out all the noise, mute anyone posting negative kr.app and just hold unto the stock. That is how you make real money. Been in PayPal since after the IPO and just held and added. We have a long long way to go with this one. Just getting started. As soon as a viable plan is announced to monetize Venmo you will see another huge pop. Enjoy fellow Longs!"
$SQ and $Pypl ya better watch out in few years
"This has been a great story for my bottom line as I bought several thousand shares just after the spin off from Ebay. At least a heck of a lot better investment than the quarter million bucks I ""parked"" in GE a year or so ago for nothing more than picking up a few basis points on the dividend."
My only regret is not having bought more.
Sometimes a drop that makes no sense....truly makes no sense. Now onward and upward!
PayPal definitely taking a breather.. but let not your heart be troubled... we see $80 soon.
Can anyone aware me what’s causing this pop today? CEO making an appearance cannot possibility make this go up this much.
"Doesn't bother me the least.Even the irrepressible charge of AAPL 8-9 years ago had period of 25 - 30% fall in between, most notably from mid $500 to below $400 before split, market cap than 400B.You can't keep a great company down for long, whatever the general market sentiment happen to be."
Paypals crypto exchange is a beast for future earnings.....
BUY BUY BUY!
"Get in now whilst you can, paypal is a quality stock"
"(Zack's)Coupa Software Inc. COUP announced collaboration with PayPal PYPL by which Coupa Pay users can access their PayPal account, which in turn will enhance customer experience"
Relax everybody. This drop is healthy. The meteoric rise is starting to feel a bit eerie and unsettling.
This what people don't understand. They are too scared to buy when it's red. But that's the best time to buy. When people is selling. US economy is healthy nothing wrong. Market getting affected by the Tarrif. But market in complety healthy.
10 billion in stock repurchase planned and SQ is in our blind spot?..........
This stock looks pre-loaded. Smart money is being dumped in right now keeping it from dropping as much as the rest of the market. We’re going to see panic buying once this market gets kick started by a good catalyst and PayPal will seen a hefty rise in a weeks span. The whole market is just looking for the catalyst
Etrade shows PYPL up $0.86 after hours...to 118.75
eBay is dropping PayPal. PayPal stocks are going down very quickly. Sell your shares now if you’re smart
"Just used paypal for all my cyber monday buying today (all non amzn purchases), I am doing my part as a shareholder to add to their bottom line."
We are now Uber owners fellow Longs. And at the IPO price. Brilliant move by Schulman. Look how many rides a day Uber undertakes world wide. That’s a tremendous amount of potential payments. Story keeps getting better with this gem of a company. Stock looks cheap here.
it's TIME!! GO GO GO GO GO GOsomeone push this thing!
"Who don't buy PYPL now will be sorry, because it will reverse as usual. PYPL is too good to go down for this long. Watch the peers they are all green."
"You deserve it PYPL, so let's make it happen! Then, follow up with a fabulous, strong holiday season! https://www.investopedia.com/news/paypals-stock-seen-rising-8-amid-strong-growth/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo"
We might hit $90 Monday due to success of G20
"Back from the dead $86 , $90.00 now."
We are back to 200's
"0,9% turnaround crossed"
PYPL will hit $500 in 2021 ...it can in a few months or by December ....
I’ve heard a lot of chatter lately from my friends on Wall St that Visa has plans on acquiring PayPal. Would this be good for PayPal shareholders? Thoughts.
free money will not end soon. the free money party is just getting started. too few stocks and too much money = pypl to 300
On useless days like this an options expiration Fridays I go play golf and do not check the market. It has served me quite well for the past 11 months to accrue a nice bag of cash.Add in a dovish Fed and I will patiently hold.Staring at a ticker all day is what these manipulating miscreants want you to do.Have a great weekend AMC bulls.Also a quick shout out to my other favs after AMC.Long and strong $AMC $NIO $BRCX $PYPL and $NVDAGo out and enjoy life and patiently hold onto your shares.
"I've had a position in PYPL for a while, but I'm now shifting to Humbl(Ticker: TSNP), way ahead, and already has everything Schulman mentioned in the last article. PYPL should try to acquire Humbl. In the meantime, I will continue investing in Humbl. You guys should check it out."
Shorts are Toast!
Ok I’ll be the one to make the call. I think both new user numbers and revenue are going to be off the charts. I think Venmo might be profitable and they announce that. I think that they will tell a good QR code and crypto story and this is going up 6.5%-8% after hours. GL all.
I love me some paypal. but wasn't that quite an expensive aquisition. like the guy below me said 13 times revenue seems like alot.
Happy to say that I’m a paypal shareholder now
PayPal is 240 today 12th may. by end of may.. 3 weeks. I would bet my house . that it's got more chance of going up $40 to 280. than $40 down to 200
Acquisitions good!.............. Shares buyback gooooooood!!!
just seen a commercial had to check it out
"great opportunity to buy at 76. loaded up a little too early at 76.50, sold off other stocks to buy in, add more to sq too. we will see 78-80 next week"
"A few people that I spoke with that hold any crypto use PayPal. I asked why... Their words: ""Because it's only a couple clicks and easy and I already have PayPal."" Lots of folks with PayPal are going to think the same thing IMO."
Najarian brother said go ahead and buy at all time high.....its going higher......I never do this.....its a momentum buy....so in at 89....making money. I need to learn trend is your friend and buying at all time highs. PayPal injects itself into many electronic transfer companies. Najarian: this could go much higher. Anybody?
"EBAY needs PayPal a lot more than PayPal needs EBAY. As PYPL CEO said, current growth with no new acquisitions would see EBAY’s business with PayPal drop by over 67%. Now imagine what new growth streams PYPL will add between now and 2020."
Venmo is a real Gem in the Paypal system ...It's worth 200 Billion by itself.

"It's funny how many people think a stock should go up every day. With that lack of patience, just take your nickels and go to Vegas"
"Once market firms up, I really see this $175+ or so, people are borrowing right now and taking out loans, quarterly earnings should be astronomic.."
All time high today?
Backed up the truck today and loaded. My PYPL stake is now 5 percent greater than prior to the market selloff. PYPL's cash flow in 5 years according to the CEO will be double what it is now. Increasing cash flows are one of the metrics I like to see when investing in a company. Rising rates can drive a company down near term but in 5 years they will do little to dim a company's prospects. Take advantage of this selloff longs. Also loaded up on SQ. PYPL is going back to 300 and then it will take out 400. Below 250 is dirt cheap.
"PayPal's Venmo processed $19 billion of payments in the fourth quarter, an 80% year-over-year increase."
"$TWLO just got in last week....what else are you bullish on? Added some $PYPL today, looking for stocks to research small cap/growth under $20 any ideas? Love what I found last year $MGNI, which has taken off to the races for 2021 and beyond, in adtech as leading SSP. Worth researching and getting in soon."

"Let""s call Jim Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PayPal"
"“This is the end, if your short my friend”.Door is shutting quickly and will create a semi short squeeze up to 260 in the next 7 biz days. “ it was nice chatting with you shorty who never got to cover lower”."
The overreaction to guidance which is 1% lower than before. This too because Paypal's growth is overwhelming their ability to consolidate it.
"My very limited stock market experience tells me that nothing has changed for PYPL. The company is still on a very good track. All the fundamentals are in place, with no change, but only improvements in earnings and in containing costs. Since there's a war over the dollar, there are some currency headwinds to deal with but, overall, nothing has fundamentally changed for PYPL. Some consolidation, and then a move back up within a few months."
Earnings report expected to be way above projections. Global digitisation is in overdrive! PayPal reaping the benefits
Did you guy see eBay lol
Honest thoughts on buying now?
Did I see we passed $300? Much faster than I expected :)
Very low volume (1/3 of average volume)!!! Buying opportunity!!!
"I was probably the biggest bull on this NIO board and in my account from June 2020 until a couple of weeks after NIO day. I did not short this stock, because it is against my principles, but I knew it would tank. I liked the secondary offerings , which I thought they were going to deploy their war chest on expansion in every area. The factory issue is pathetic. The raised about $5Billion of our American dollars and seem content to sit on it. That turned me off, and when you combine legacy autos deploying cash for the EV sector, they have lost a great deal of momentum and trust. Now, I get the tech trades are suffering. I recently moved into $PYPL which has taken a whipping with the overall NASDAQ, but I am sorry, I will stay with PYPL and shun this. The cash in PYPL is real, the expansion is real and their massive revenues are equating to strong earnings. It may be rocky for a while, but $PYPL will bust out after this down cycle to new highs.NIO, once my favorite tech play has been very disappointing, and questionable what they are doing with cash.To my long term NIOites on this board, I issue this caution out of loyalty to you. Remember the November dilution. The locked up shares awarded to those that brought the secondary to market in November, free up late this month. Be careful as the float expands and more shares hit the market.Once again, very disappointed in NIO and am someone suspect on all these cash raises via dilution. Just wanted to remind those about the unlocked shares coming to market in a couple of weeks.I feel better in $PYPL and will have some exposure to China through their arrangements with Alipay.I hope it works out with NIO, but please proceed with caution. Good luck to all on my former board hangout.NIO owes me nothing, I did great with them.I hope to see some of you around, and NIO does deploy some of the cash they raised from the American equity market."
PYPL is new market leading stock: $200 target in 12 months!
Hunter Bill Randy Anonymous Dennis Anthony. How about that $SQ printed 100 today while $PYPL is stuck below $90. Tried to tell ya folks
"Time to load up. This is not a pump, just a bit of “no brainer” advice from someone who has done fairly well in the markets over the last 50+ years. Buy and hold for 6+ months. Guaranteed you will not regret it."
So much for square beating PayPal to $100 after the market drop.
PYPL rumored to crush earnings estimates. Analyst upgrade is a nice affirmation to stock solidity.May see 212 by EOW. GLTA!
Taken a breather call me when she wakes up gotta catch the ride back up north.
Nothing makes sense anymore. Companies blow out earnings and drop. Garbage companies miss and go up?
PayPal was featured on CNBC's Trading Nation as being undervalued in comparison to analyst opinions. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/27/halliburton-paypal-could-catch-up-to-their-high-average-price-targets.html
Good time to buy back shares?
"Good day for PYPL & it's holders, taking out its ATH! Let's keep the momentum going with a nice beat & strong ER report!"
I moved my saving account to the paypal crypto. and since my holdings has gained 40%.
"just added ""link"" to my cryptocurrency. looking fwd to a solid 3 year increase to $200plus"
It is down big time by as much 10+. What is going on?
PayPal reached an all time high at 145.63
I see resistance at the 50 day moving average and support at the 200 dma. I don't see a low RSI buy signal or volume to support a rise in price. Does anyone here have anything statistically speaking to support the current price level?
"What chart pattern does everyone think they are seeing? Looking at the 180day chart, I have a support level at around 230 and another one higher at 236 (two separate support lines). Past few trading days, it looks like it is in either congestion or a consolidating pattern? Trying to find if it will possibly breakout somewhere"
Not sure what catalyst will stop this from drifting to 190
We should be good to $300.00 short term.
Just for you guys to know: the more volatile Bitcoin's price is the more transactions which is good for Paypal.
"Max Levchin , the $PYPL paypal co-founder talks about consumer habits at CNBC!! 40 seconds into the clip he says that IRobot sales has DOUBLED !!!!!!! This is absolutely crazy info. Think we will be above $100 before summer is over. Think this will 3X within a year from current levels. Watch the clip and do your own due diligance! Youtube ”Max Levchin CNBC ” its a 5 minute 56 second long video posted april 9th."
"Will be positive in no time , patience ..."
I see $300 in few weeks.
"So realistically, how high can we see this go? Is 4/5% the er push? Im not trying to be greedy just curious and new"
"Policies change. Markets react. Businesses just keep running. So when it is red, don't forget to buy, if you can."
Paypal will not accept Bitcoin so why invest in it? Bitcoin is all that matters in the world.
Let’s do $81-82 + today
I guess Paypal is not surging because of Investors Day but because of Bitcoin surging. It will surge more during the event. $300 today?
"we all need to keep buying things and pay with PayPal, lets keep this stock moving up"
growth rate is 59% - not good enough for the market. But to me - wow!!Let's hear what they have to say on the call.
What is up today..?
How much exposure would you think PayPal has in business/personal travel space? I think little to none. If true we go to 200 Thursday.
"HMBL-HUMBL Nation is here to stay, you could join if you would like to make a ton of money."
I have a friend who works as a Wall Street Analyst. He knows nothing ...no ...he knows LITERALLY NOTHING but where to buy cocaine and how to order wine at fancy restaurants.
You all having a good time out there! http://youtu.be/i0vFid2tKbI
$NIO $PLTR holding these stock and stressful as fk and look at $SQ $PYPL $NVDA $ROKU
Buying opportunity!!! This is a great company!!!
the fear of not having the stock
"The market makers try so hard to shake the palm tree hoping the palm will fall down, which I think it will scare some weak hands. I just pick up some calls a little further down in Feb because I believe that our economy is very strong. The market goes a little too far but the good ones always get the premium more that the peers. I guess PYPL should go back to 85 again in the afternoon."
Many thanks to those who sold your shares. I bought them. See you soon easily back above $200++.
Walmart deal will help boost Paypal subscribers also.
Ebay soars by 7%
put a sell order in @ $260 today. God's are with me 
"How do you buy crypto with Paypal. When I login, there are no options... ""For the PayPal community, today is the first time its users can purchase crypto assets directly from PayPal. PayPal is introducing the ability for its users to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. To start, PayPal is offering this service to its US customers, then plans to add more geographies and features over time."""
Tomorrow should be interesting. SP might be all over the place??
"The next catalyst, which will not take long is the analysts upgrades. Blow out quarter. Better yet the forward guidance.Run it down, run it up. I am staying put."
Holding up well on a down tech day nice
"I am holding PYPL. Good quarter performance, strong growth and solid cash flow."
I love the smell of freshly squeezed shorts on a cold day like today. Delicious.
Crypto volatility = easy money for PayPal. This also drives user engagement.
Why isn't this moving more? Nasdaq is up over 1% Is Paypal at a resistance level?
Is Paypal customer service really this bad or am I the only one having issues.I don't understand how they still have any customers.
Sell now and move your money to HMBL.
$80 baby !
Why is everyone comparing the share price of $SQ to $PYPL? Only amateurs compare share prices. Market cap is where you compare them.
Hope yall bought the Dip!
Will PYPL break $80 today?
wow!
Huge beat!
Take a look at the volume behind that last 5 minute bar! 243k+.

Look at long term chart. Now do you think PYPL is along term hold? rest my case.

Three words to describe PayPal: Long and Strong
Go PYPL!
What a gift today ... bought the dip! Go PYPL! 
"And there you have it, pre-market $90.10.............your welcome......"
"C'MON PYPL BABY, SHOW US WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF TOMORROW!!!"
"Ill sell half my position going into earnings tomorrow and keep the other half and wait. PYPL is still expensive so it will have to really hit it out of the park to keep it from dropping, albeit temporary."
"First off Yahoo message board suck because it deletes half the messages for no reason. NO reason to think this wont be deleted either.In any event I posted earlier to expect a big drop on the earnings but that it would recover, which it did somewhat. Now it's back down to last weeks level. The stock has had a good run and people are looking for any reason to take profits. Let the sellers sell and they buy more. They were fractionally light on revenue expectations next quarter but raised full year guidance. Stick with it and buy more as it drops."
this is collateral damage from FB miss
"Bill Ready, PYPL CEO, on CNBC-after commercial-to make big announcement!"
I hope this goes to at least 86 tomorrow
not so bad......
Total BLOWOUT!!
I was just checking out some other stocks: HD and FDX have been hit hard - have no idea where pypl will end up tonight? Would love to pick some up in the 60's in case they miss or the market doesn't like what they hear. The market is not acting strong ATM and would expect more downside and we need the tariffs to be figured out.
Big buys silver when it spiked in September yet longs are bagholders 
"Repurchased 23.6 million shares of common stock, returning $1.83 billion to stockholders"
I'll be adding the $1400 stim to my pypl shares as soon as I get it. Any shares under $275 seem like a gift.
Green tomorrow.
Pypl 90 AH today if sq beats
What I love about PYPL was that I invested in PYPL because I was a client and loved the ease of operation sending and receiving money out of the country. So as Peter Lynch always preached in his books when you have anecdotal evidence on something being a hit buy it and I did. And doubled twice along the way.
"If you look at the chart, you’ll notice there was also a broad based selloff in Oct which included a Pypl drop of about 10%. This time we have a drop of about 18% so far, which is disturbing, but the last correction lasted 18 days from top to bottom before resuming the upwards trend and we are now 16 days into this current drop, hopefully another correction. It’s healthy for the market, as long as it doesn’t transform into a panic crash. The trend line for Pypl is still solidly bullish, with a spike and drop ‘correction’ during February off a very bullish trendline over the last year that we are still well within on a slow stochastic basis... Nothing has fundamentally changed; the government is still printing money with a lot more to come very soon, we are still at near zero interest rates, and Pypl is still making money hand over fist on crypto.The scary trend is the treasury yield rising over the last few months, so we need to keep a close eye on that trend which can cause a panic selloff if this continues too long and that yield gets too high.I am not panicking. We should know within the next week or so whether this short term bear is part of a longer term bear or just a temporary valuation reset."
"if I had more money I'd be buying right now. but still holding all my shares, not even worried. were back to where we were two weeks ago, big deal."
Stay long and strong gang
PayPal is ejaculating all over the market rn

Crypto is the 21st century digital gold rush. Paypal is THE picks and shovel play on digital currencies.
Earnings will be reported April 25th. PayPal started a new Twitter account today that will post news related to PYPL. It’s @paypalnews.

""" As part of PayPal, Honey's reach is about to increase substantially. One of PayPal's near-term priorities is to integrate Honey into the core PayPal and Venmo apps. ""We have significant scale on those mobile apps,"" Schulman said, alluding to Venmo's 52 million users.The integration is expected to be completed in the second half of this year. Once complete, Honey could fuel Venmo's momentum, which saw payment volume soar 56% year over year in the last quarter. """
What happened to the dude who told CNBC Cramer to short $pypl and long $ebay two years ago?
Buy Baba for Ant Financial. 3x bigger
that's how we roll. PAYPAL
"pypl COO just sold 46,000 pypl shares."
Bring back Janet Yellen.
"ok, no correction for the market today then, just green everyday lol"
Fittin to buy some mo!
UBS raises PayPal’s Target Price from $107 to $120 and they know they are being conservative !
"Ebay ditching paypal payments and opts to direct pay sellers thru their bank accounts thereby ebay sellers avoid paypal fees , to be implemented by May 31st."
New 52 week high... Yes please!
This rocket is set for lift off. Grab your seat.
What do you say “ pay me “ Or “Venmo me” Cash is dead
I just bought $500 in crypto. Sold it for $600 on the same day. PayPal took about $25 in fees...so they get good revenue and I have more money than I started with (will most likely spend it on PayPal)... future looks good here
"I own and love $PYPL, and would like to buy more. But what are your thoughts at this level? Had made a huge move the last few months, obviously. On the other hand, there’s still so much more room to grow."
"All the analyst on CNBC for months have said, if you can get some PYPL under 100, buy it......well it's here....buy low......this is your chance....."
"It did this back in Nov Dec, just bounced up and down before taking off. Hope for repeat."
Easy money
We will hit $80 by Tuesday or before gang. Please be ready :)
Is 90 realistic
"Bought this Friday . Was a little scared because it seemed to easy. Guess not,"
This is why I always want to own grinders like PYPL in my portfolio. The stock is up 2 cents when the rest of tech got mauled.
PYPL is so solid. So happy I got in on this. Holding calls long.
If ur holding a bag at 300 don’t worry your investment will pay off. Outlook is to triple users in 4 years. If you triple ur users shouldn’t you also triple ur value
Paypal should report blockbuster earnings today!!
we are coming back
"Key points for investors:1. eBay only represents a small portion of PayPal's current business.2. Now with 5-year exclusive over, PayPal can go after several other big retailers.3. And most important point...a given consumer typically sets up one bank for their online bill pay with al their merchant and credit information, and same for when hey set up PayPal for online purchases. Consumers will not switch that easily to other platforms. I am set up on PayPal for online purchases, and will continue to use it. 4. If eBay excludes use of PayPal along side of other new pay processors, it will dramatically kill their traffic. While if they do, minimal risk for PayPal."
"Market up and down every single day, intrinsic value will be leading the spine. Up trend IMHO"
This will be back to $110+ soon. Eventually it’ll get back to $120 but at this point it’s hard to tell when. Be patient and hold.
"Meh,I will check back on this stock in a few days. I am not worried one bit. Big stocks such as PYPL that is exapanding + everything + great earnings report. This baby will bounce back in 1-2 months. NOTHING to lose your head over everyone or sleep for that matter. If you are LONG you have nothing to worry about."
Feels like a green day?
How it all drags on. No volumes. There is no liquidity in the market. Krupnyaki in the cache or other tools) ??
SQ doing $1.7B in crypto makes me curious what pypl's crypto volume is. That would only be about $30-40million in revenue if paypal ends up being the same as SQ. I foresee paypal having 20-25x that volume within a couple years... hope that is the case
Target raised to $114. Get a move in PayPal!
"I don't get it. On April 1st, PYPL = $78.64, SQ = 47.68, a $31 dollar share price difference. Dan Schulman and the CFO (Bob Swan) continue to preach 'shareholder value' but other than small gains followed by retreats, we inch along while Square churns up yardage and is now less than $2.00 behind PYPL in share price. I think the problem is that Dan and the boys continue to march out their standard 'guide down' verbiage after earnings. It scares analysts and institutional investors. PYPL has no debt and boatloads of cash and an amazing product, yet Dan and the boys are more worried about Diversity and Inclusion and doing things to win them their 'pat on the back' awards from silicon valley as a progressive company.I'm an ex employee of PYPL. Over 16 years there before I retired. I have slightly over 5,000 shares from option packages and ESPP so it's a nice chunk of change but this gets old watching Dan hold this company back.I'm sure I'll get blasted by the PYPL loyalists, bears, and the SQ cheerleaders. But hopefully there will be a few logical conversations in this thread."
"eSports, sports cards and sports gambling. So many transactions going through the paypal ecosystem. People are paying entry fees, getting winnings and then paying more entry fees. Consistent cycle and paypal is taking a piece of the pie on each transaction"
Low volume manipulation. Possible position reallocations. Stay long.
Earnings at 5pm today!Up we go!!!!
Venmo is the best!! Everyone I know uses it...all ages...endless opportunity for continued growth there
where are the bad news? don't see any... only cause whole market is down??
"“Legend” has egg on his face ... his definition of “$249./250 forever high” lasted less than a week... PayPal hit $250.35 a few hours ago today..... on its way to $300. May hit it in the next month, with ER due in less than two weeks. Legends are often fictional... it appears he writes nothing but fiction."
So we beat earnings and prices back to 2 weeks ago.... still losing $40k
"just remember, PayPal is sitting on a pile of cash, and acquisitions, if anything goes wrong they have buybacks to keep propelling the company. Compared to square, which doesn't"
Bonds have rocketed again ffs  this dip is not representative of company value $CBAT $PLUG $NNDM $PYPL $NIO
"So glad I dumped VZ last year after holding for 3yrs!!! Bought $PYPL and sitting on very nice gains that makes VZ dividend look like chump change.Sincerely,Briscoe R."
No dip today!
PYPL looking good now :)).
Paypal should have bought Square. Too late now
"PayPal new 52 week high by July, May dip with market pull back. "
I’ve been in since $53 not leaving today no matter what happens
is sky falling on paypal? wth its down 1% more afterhours? $35 down in 4 days?
13 agencies upgraded $PYPL. I can see tomorrow up more than 5% again
Holding up pretty well
Premarket looking strong. Another record day amigos. March to $90 continues. Vamos!
230 eoy for pypl...300 by summer
The one stock i want today
back on track! I love it! good luck everyone!
I love how people listen to the analyst that weren't good enough to do what they wanted which is work for Goldman sachs. so they took a job at Guggenheim.
This will definitely increase tmrw
Adios $75. Hasta Luego $76. Bienvenido $77......on to $78 baby!
a good time to be adding more shares. keep nibbling. S&P will find support around 2800 so be patient and add to great companies like this one
"I’m betting Cathy Woods @ ARK will be mopping herself off the floor for reducing her stake in PYPL, if the rumor mills are correct. Even monkeys can see the banana’s on this tree are about to go from greener to “Sweet Gold!”"
After hours will wreck the shorties
Shorts....
Glad I listened to the views in this board!! I have 400 shares at 184
Every dip gets bought.. will probably close green if the market holds up.
https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-03-08-PayPal-to-Acquire-Curv
"Pay pal going to beat the estimate and whisper numbers . Those bought heavy put on 88 put, they are losing the money . If they short the put that’s okay . See you after hour with mr Franklin . $100"
PYPL for the long haul!
"Should see $275 on open tomorrow, what a call!!"
"Go pypl and sq!!!!!!!!! Love both stocks. I believe there's room for both. kinda like visa and Mastercard. Just in case, it's better to own both than just 1"
PYPL is the goat in financial sector
"Such a great company (great earning and growing potential as well as entering Chinese market), it should be at $130.0 by now."
Just can't get any respect. Has never really recovered from the ebay news.
"I've been watching PYPL since the Summer, so mad I didn't buy back then. Just wondering if today is the best day to jump in..GLTA, see earnings coming up."
Expecting 200 or higher by years end very profitable and expanding
PYPL is breaking out this morning!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
Don’t understand why people are all worked up over the eBay thing. PayPal has grown out of EBay. It’s time for Paypal to sign an exclusive deal with a company that will bring them big revenue
This is all due to selling off of overall tech sector because of fears of rising 10 yr treasury yield. Hard to know when this will end.
paypal needs to pull a FB reverse and go green!
"Sold position today for a 30% profit, but I regret it now. When should I re-stock?"
50B Revenue guidance 2025.
"Too many comments that imply short term trading in this stock. This is a stock you buy and hold for your children. It will go up and down for various reasons but the long term trend is up. You will get at least 20% growth a year for the next 10 years and if someone buys them, so much the better."
"PYPL CRUSHED estimates as expected. Analysts remain firm on BUY recommendations. Revised share valuations not far behind, with targets nearing $435/pps avg. There is a lot of intrinsic value in this company."
I am sure Paypal will blow estimates during Q1 as I think analyst are underestimating the potential of crypto revenue.
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-named-a-top-pick-at-barclays-2018-11-14
This was up to 208 pre-market. What kind of shenanigans was that? I portfolio would be looking pretty sweet right now if it wasn't for paypal. Even my bank stocks are way up!
Profit tripled lol
PayPal...over 200 transactions per second. We need this to pass Visa at over 1600 per second.
"Hi guys,I am long. Bought 100 shares at $60 and do not plan to sell anytime soon. That being said do you think that this stock could be overvalued at the current price? the P/E is pretty high.... of course this a great company.... I would like to know your opinion about this. Thanks in advance for your time!"
"I love this stock! Its promising and safe to keep in your portfolio. This is still undervalued. Once the revenue increase, valuation would be more than Visa!"
Day to buy more!!!
Not sure who is selling here and why. This has has a $125 price target by an activist investor.
What a let down. 90 seems not to hold...
Bargain price
Surprised that the breakout didn’t materialize today; the handle still isn’t quite there yet. Going in to earnings will hopefully set a string of new highs.
$309 52 WEEK HIGH.
So much positive PR lately......... Potential energy is high!
"Low volume today, yet we still managed to close above $85. Buckle up everyone, we going in 90s next week"
$345 today lol
PYPL is a core holding. Prob the best fintech along with V. I think this is $240 soon.
One opportunity not yet priced into PayPal is their consumer base expansion in Africa through M-Pesa. I was surprised by the pervasive use of M-Pesa in Tanzania and Kenya on my visit their two years ago - PayPal now gives us exposure to that massive and largely underserved market :)
"Where are ""Big Sellers"", ""Manipulators"" today? All quiet, and covering short positions. You know they knew all along that the stock was going up, that is why they created panic for three days. The SEC never finds these guys because they are all off shore money guys connected to the top."
150 then back to 100 then 200 in 3 years
i wish i had funds available. This pullback is a gift.
Anyone else buying today?
"Borrowed this from another stock board. Can not agree more. Great case for $PYPL as a strong buy all that much more. PYPL is both a value and massive growth play.In Sept, 2012 amazon had a P/E of 3600. It lost money the next 3 quarters. In Sept, 2013 it had a P/E of 1100. By June 2014 it was 850. Then another 4 quarters of losses. By March 2016 it’s P/E was under 500. If you invested in amazon during this period and held to today, your returns are 5X in about 6 years. You don’t use P/E ratio dictate your investment decisions for growth companies folks."
Powell is a big an i diot as the people listening to him.He had no ability to communicate.Period.300.in 2 weeks
too late to buy. move up too fast
"Hang in there longs, the good times are coming back. Rates are in the mid 1.7s...me and the pros on this matter have targets in the lower 2s...there's more pain ahead but it will subside soon and there will be massive buying back in. If you can't handle the bad times, investing is not for you. The market goes through good and bad phases...hold during the good times, in most of the bad scenarios you get greedy and buy more shares. That strategy has worked for me for 8 years and my PYPL position is 25 percent larger than prior to the selloff."
Volume coming in. Watch for a break of $78.23 to continue the uptrend. Target: 91.37 at stoxline.
stocks are falling. quick...someone cut rates fast.
"After years paypal finally embraces bitcoin....finally, was a long time coming, riot and mara will soar off this development.go uxin solo trxc zi"
How will this impact the stock near earnings time? Competition between Mastercard and Visa and both are competitors of PayPal. Hopefully this doesn't interfere with this stock https://www.investors.com/news/mastercard-stock-mastercard-pressures-rival-visa-bid-earthport/
"when China launches DCEP early next year, not only Alipay and WeChat will benefit from the digital currency payment, but also Pypl because pypl is the only foreign-based company that has registered in China."
"""Paypal Bought 70% of All Newly Mined Bitcoin Last Month as Demand Rockets""source: Bitcoin newsThat should drive the stock price over 200 IMO"
Big= Big Losses
"I’ve been preaching buy since IPO. I won’t stop now. It may be heated but run with it. Cash is dead, physical credit cards are following suit. PYPL has decades of growth and innovation. Don’t forget the cousin SQ either. Happy 10 bagger 2030."
"I'll say $.70. Giving good-to-strong guidance is key, that'll give us the run-up to $100+ we've been waiting for."
if anyone is stupid enough to sell there paypal shares right before earnings I'll gladly pick them up this will go over 300$ may 4th when they report earnings I've invested into paypal for along time my average cost is around 50$ a share it in 5 years it's ran 300 percent
"This post says it all. Really thought it was worth reposting.After paypal analyst day the other week, where they laid out 750 million active accounts by 2025, double what it has now, and more than doubling revenue...Here is where analyst stand:PayPal price target $375 at MizuhoPayPal price target raised to $350 from $310 at CitiPayPal price target raised to $340 from $290 at Keefe BruyettePayPal price target raised to $333 from $296 at Raymond JamesPayPal price target raised to $330 from $300 at SusquehannaPayPal price target raised to $329 from $302 at Morgan StanleyPayPal price target raised to $321 from $291 at Loop CapitalPayPal price target raised to $315 from $306 at CanaccordPayPal price target raised to $310 from $249 at JPMorganPayPal price target raised to $310 from $300 at KeyBanc"
Nice little pullback to add me some more shares. This company is a money making machine. Long and strong and hold for 5+ years.
$90 by Christmas
Thank you guys for the dip!! Wanted to load up after selling $QS. Now let’s take it back to 220
Anyone know what happened to PYPL today?
PYPL consolidation should be about over. Much pivoting on EOM holding losses. Expect a significant upward swing and lots of volatility in next 2 weeks. Small investors should be adding at this time. GLTA!
Recovering
"Bitcoin curried, what will PYPL drop on Monday? 10 points"
"Bitcoin USD up over $1,000, thanks to $TSLA & $SQ & $PYPL $60,000 Bitcoin here we come!

"An expanded Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) relationship is mutually beneficial and could be a game-changer for PayPal, according to MoffettNathanson.“Facebook and PayPal are natural partners. They’re both successful internet disruptors focused on facilitating online commerce – Facebook through advertising, PayPal through payments,” analyst Lisa Ellis wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.After a 13-year marriage, eBay (EBAY) and PayPal divorced in 2015. According to Ellis, a new relationship with a major tech, financial or payments company could benefit PayPal greatly. “[It] could create step-function growth in PayPal’s user base, merchant base, geographic footprint, or omni-channel capabilities, and are only possible now that PayPal is free of the constraints of the eBay relationship.”As for Facebook, the tech giant has been under intense scrutiny as a result of misinformation and privacy concerns, and the stock has suffered as a consequence. Shares of Facebook have tanked more than 18% in 2018. Facebook needs a new narrative, and an expanded partnership with PayPal could get the company back in the good graces of investors, according to Ellis.Despite all of the headwinds facing Facebook, Ellis explained that investors are ignoring the company’s e-commerce growth opportunities. “With over 6 million advertisers and 2.6 billion people using at least one of Facebook’s four leading products, they have the potential to develop a world leading eCommerce platform – but, given Facebook’s lack of in-house expertise, need a partner(s) to help,” Ellis argued.Among those four-leading Facebook products is Instagram. The platform has been a force to be reckoned with this year, dethroning Snapchat (SNAP) as the most-used app by teens, according to a survey by Piper Jaffray.Facebook and PayPal have had a partnership since 2016. Facebook users are able to use PayPal to shop on Facebook Messenger and Marketplace; however, Ellis outlined three possible expanded partnership scenarios between PayPal and Facebook.The first option involves the integration of a payment function within WhatsApp. According to Ellis, in order to better compete with rival WeChat, allowing payments on WhatsApp will help drive user engagement. “Even if only 5% of the 1.3B WhatsApp users (whom do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 65M new users – a 28% growth in its base,” Ellis said.Secondly, tapping into powerhouse Instagram would potentially be a smart move for PayPal. Instagram has around 1 billion users, and an expanded PayPal partnership with the platform will allow Instagram users to stay engaged on the platform and shop without leaving the app. “If only 5% of 0.8B Instagram users (who do not overlap with PayPal) are converted, PayPal would capture 40M new users – a 17% growth in its base. PayPal would also realize incremental payment processing volume and revenue from processing Instagram transactions.”Lastly, Ellis argues that there could be a more aggressive partnership between PayPal and Facebook’s Marketplace. While currently there is a limited number of people that actually make transactions through Marketplace, an extended partnership with PayPal could help boost that number, according to Ellis.“We believe the conditions are in place for Facebook and PayPal to pursue one or more of these partnership options over the next 6-12 months,” Ellis said."
"It would be interesting if PYPL says “we are welcoming in any of cryptocurrency blah blah” which, leads to 1000% for less than a month for sure. I hope it won’t happen but I will glad to take profit if it happens."
Stock is headed to $210 according to Alex Greene of PugatchAdvisory.
up to 93
"I expect to see PYPL at 85+ by Friday, then 86-87 by Jan 31. I tell you the LONGS here that we will see PYPL at around 91-93 on Feb 1"
"It seems Q3 earnings were short of expectations? This seems like an excuse to sell when actual earnings beat on every target there was. I think the stock is being manipulated to create a less expensive entry point for institutional buyers, who want to now get in because Venmo has proven to have grown by 78%. This stock is the next Visa."
The movement above 250-260 will begin only when the positive reporting on July 27. Will match the bounce of macrostatic data. Now all macro statistics show a decrease in momentum in comparison with March.Now earnings for fluctuations are $ 3-5
"PayPal friends... huge potential. Check out High Tide! Great Financials, super CEO, 166% growth YOY and much much more.... so your own DD @ HITIF good luck y’all!"
buying more
Looks like the gas is back on?
get ready for take off time to double down on pypl
Bargain priceTomorrow adding more shares
sudden increase at 3pm. Institutional buying?
long time investment
"Beats on Revenue and EPS, raised guidance, and a 10B buyback plan? Yeah, I think I'll hold."
https://www.investopedia.com/news/paypal-seen-jumping-18-strong-growth/
"Over 6 months ago I congratulated the PYPL shareholders (of which I was one) for the fine returns the Company had earned ... however, I encouraged the PYPL shareholders to consider two equities -- HURC and SQ )mid-$50s) as I was of the belief both would begin to scale over the next year for above what ""momentum"" was remaining in PYPL. Well...... SQ has moved over 80% while PYPL moved 12% (still a good return). Today with SQ's strong move up and PYPL down, I believe ""pair trades"" are occurring in the ""thin-finance"" sector.... Thus, for the next 3 months, without justification to fundamental rationale, SQ will continue to significantly outpace PYPL. Just my two centavos!"
Wow paypal
"When a stock is sporting a 66 P/E, any hiccup can and usually does cause damage. PYPL took a slice of the 24.4 billion EBAY processed in just the last quarter. You do the math, it's serious money. While EBAY does a serious volume with PYPL,which represents a higher profit margin than other transactions. That said, EBAY represents a continually smaller portion of PYPL revenue; and VENMO which they own, is on fire, growing like mad. We need more info from mgmt to more accurately gauge the growth effect. I don't own shares but am synthetically long, having some a couple of ATM leaps--JAN-19 at the 77 1/2 strike. Longer term, time will definitely heal the damage as platforms are where to be for growth. This is not where you want to park money short term or if you'll need it during the next year. GL."
"5,200 shares at $82.78"
$400 in a month. Book it!
Nice entry point here going into (most likely) blow out earnings
Exciting
The opportunity cost is rising here.......... Where are the buybacks?
"So Square has generated 1.76 billion in revenue from bitcoin. How much revenue will Paypal make from crypto then as Paypal also have Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoincash? Do Paypal have more users than Square in terms of buying Bitcoin?"
"Ok Pypl, let's not repeat yesterday's cruel joke, that was not funny"
This is what all the libTARDS wanted. Congratulations. I was long for 4 years got short January 22nd and won’t cover until 2024!
"This stock should be at least $350. Incredible margins, still 20% annual growth and basically Venmo is dominating the digital payment space. A money machine."
don't understand all the crying. the stock is a 3-5 yr play with upside of 50% in the next 18 mos. If you wanna gamble go to Vega$.
"This could be $200 within months. Crypto buy/sell, send/receive is a nice revenue stream to tap into. It definitely helped SQ"
"PYPL ...YES, PLEASE! Great end to the week!! "
good luck long !
"WHat's everyone's guess for earnings on 5/5, I think $1.07"
YES! I said I would wait for the rocket  yesterday!!! 
Moves upwards like molasses and drops like a rock. - Acts like someone higher up has a deduction button
"Some stocks like Tsla and GME are 100% over valued, but how much it drags the whole market is a bit surprising."
This and Square seem most likely to benefit from mass inflation
"Off the grid people are buying bitcoin, how do they sell it when you are off the grid? Seems you cant."
$1.63b in Bitcoin revenue and $32m in gross profit. $PYPL late to the party as always
There is nothing normal with this market smh
Is there something going on at PYPL that the CEO is telling us shareholders. Contact him
it seems like various efforts are being made encourage the buying of pypl. it is almost as if various groups are are begging that pypl stock be bought. could this be evidence of distribution by large pypl longs?
Let’s take down $100 ASAP. Once we do it comes into play for a long a Institutions who only buy stocks over $100. Future is bright Amigos.
What other companies will use amazon pay?? Now that PayPal is freed from eBay it’s a neutral payment source that is way more important than any other news.
"PYPL indicated up this morning. Don't sell rate cuts coming end of July,and Sept.sept"
PayPal reached an all time high at 209.07
15% up after conference call...89+
Congress has bipartisan agreement to pass the 1.4 trillion COVID relief package at 10pm tonight. This will boost the market tomorrow.
Bitcoin is 28K up 15%-20% in the last 5 days. I would not be surprised if we hit $250-$260 very soon
Dan Schulman one smart cookie......long and strong PayPal
Cant wait to here the Conference call. Rises 10 more on that hidden gem
We might see 270 by tomorrow!
"Jim Cramer says buy, usually 1-2 weeks afterwards, that stock usually dips. Its over HOLD long term PYPL good."
Do you get excited when someone offers to give you four $5 bills in exchange for one $20 bill  that’s all a stock split is 
Rumors are that buffet himself is building up a position on PayPal.
Shocked...but time to buy
Lmao why so much negative spam in this chat
"If I can't use paypal when checking out I go to another online seller. Same as the days of ebay, if they didn't offer paypal it was a scammer. Im adding as much as I can afford because after the discount it's still my biggest % gainer."
"Not a user of paypal as Visa is a superior credit building and rewards enabling option. However, I do love stocks that defy gravity which pypl certainly is."
Drinks for everybody gonna be a great day
this company is too damn powerful now everyone has realised the 'potential' data breach was just paypal being extremely honest. unlike mot companies that hide tax evading dislotal secrets. Paypal can't afford to pretend and they clearly don't. In the end the news affected no one using their service and fundamentally they are in no different a position than what they were at 78 a share.Buy and ride this easy 8% back up.or Hold and i'll see you guys at 100 soon.
"ARK Invest added to positions in payment specialist PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Purchases of 66,100 and 24,750 shares in the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF) made PayPal the fund's fourth-largest holding, making up 4.4% of the fund. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/stock-markets-soar-here-are-2-stocks-cathie-woods-ark-invest-added-to-last-week/ar-BB1dvDaI#:~:text=ARK%20Invest%20also,of%20the%20fund."
"Wait till all those free $1400 checks, and the kids all buy crypto on PayPal, rocketing up"
"I have used paypal since 2004 religiously. I love it. I wont switch. Its like changing banks., nuts"
"Bull flag, targeting 116"
VENMO HUGE !!!!
"Price moves in the extreme mode for next week. I like PYPL, GOOG and FB which I think they will move even higher 6-8 % in each stock."
PYPL is breaking out! I love this stock!
"People who care about minor price fluctuations should stop investing and try to get quick money with more volatile stocks. Pins is one of the best stocks to buy at these prices. Maybe it goes down a bit, then buy the dip. I Bought $SQ at 36, $CHGG at 29, $ETSY at 40, $ZM at 63 $, $PYPL at 100. Many people one these boards were saying these are wothless stocks, or moving slow. I truly believe Pins will be a triple digit stock in the coming years. ARK investments (Cathie Wood, look it up) has also added PINS to their portfolio. Scientific research has proven that short term traders, will earn quick money, while long term holders gather the most wealth overtime!If you are not happy with PINS then sell the stock and chase other opportunities. However, PINS is a safe investment. I posted last week a post with some facts. Look it up."
Jeff Cantwell downgraded PYPL but upgraded SQ back in May. $SQ will print $150 before $PYPL
"Inflation is fixing itself. Lumber, food, gas, commodities, all came down in price this last week. At 245.50 this will be the lowest to buy PYPL today. a one month CPI report, is NOT the future of a bear raid. good luck with that shorts."
Buy the dips for Investors Day tomorrow !!!
"As a longtime holder of the stock (try $31 a share) I understand the reaction to the news. I think many of us (myself included) were thinking this was the quarter that would start the next round UP into the high $90-110 range. Unfortunately this has been an embarrising quarter to report with revenue miss. Yes we have added a significant new amount of users but it does take some time for most of those users to become acclimated into using PayPal in increasing transactions. That will take some time for results to be felt. In addition, while there have been significant acqusitions the most important, iZettle continues to be reviewed by the EU for possible ""loss of competition"" rules. Therefore, without significant increase in revenue, without really knowing the total amount of shres repurchased, and without any jolt to the stock in terms of a special dividend (thus allowing possible inclusion into certain mutual funds) we shareholders are faced with the fact that PayPal is a stock that will continue to plod along with its share price until we can see a SIGNIFICANT new growth in both users and revenues. I have predicted a stock price of $110-$114 by the anniversary of the IPO for this year but I am now concerned that we will not achieve that level this year. However, all is not lost. We will continue to see slow incremental increases in the stock price over this year just not the home run many of us where hoping and expecting."
"PYPL is staying on top of innovative banking and could very well become the next globally diverse, mega-banking system poised for stabilizing and standardizing world monetary trade. Clearly, PayPal has a $300+ price target. The march to $250 will be quick paced!"
what a week for digital payments!!
With BTC - should be 300 by end of next year easy.
Very strategic buy and a took a while to consummate. Well done!
Q4 earnings will be amazing with Black Friday and December spending as most of them occurs online. Q1 will be more amazing as Paypal starts charging for trading cryptocurrencies and QR codes payments. Not to forget that in 2021 Paypal will enable users from outside the US to also start trading crypto.
Anytime CNBC recommends a stock it's usually too late!
PYPL for the long haul! I love you!
Stocks like Pypl are a win LONG TERM. I rebought at $82. It dippes 70. I held and now 110. How can complain with 15-40% return per year?
Minimum $95.00 or better on Thursday morning. Option expiration July $95 calls looks great. September $95 calls look great as well.
Wow PayPal!

"For 5 months now, PYPL hasn’t moved a penny. Square is an absolute giant!"
"In relation to other high beta names SQ and PYPL haven't sold off that much. That said, that could change, but only temporarily. My target for rates, with 95 percent certainty, in the lower 2nd percentile. That means we only have a little bit further to go. Those who say SQ and PYPL won't rally once rates are done going up clearly fail to understand the fact these two companies have transformed lives, the way business is done, etc. These are great companies. You are getting the opportunity of a lifetime to load up on them at bargain basement level prices compared to where they have traded. You will patting yourselves on the back by the end of the year most likely...there is a 99.99 percent chance rates are not going to go up forever...people are freaking out over this and my dad, who remembers the late 1970s and early 1980s, says this kind of pain is like a pin #$%$ compared to that. Slow down, inhale, exhale, and realize this is not the end of the world. SQ and PYPL are still the same companies they were...I will only sell if the company specific news takes a severe turn for the worse, and so far, over the whole period I've owned both of those names, the news has only gotten better. My two cents. Take advantage of these prices in both names while they are still here."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-nasdaq-pypl-000230518.htmlThis is a great outlook. if you don't buy now, may not get another chance for a great entry."
PayPal is so much better than square
NOTHING MATTERS ON EARNINGS. This chart is completely broken. It would need to go to $95 to break the down trend that is in place.
Atlantic Equities upgraded PayPal from Neutral to Overweight and set a new price target of $315.00

I love Paypal doubled for me.
Cathie Woods been adding PYPL on her ETF funds daily. She must think PYPL a jewel? 
I can’t remember the last time I paid for anything with cash. Actually- when i get my hair cut once a month. That’s it though￼
"I mentioned the $1T transaction volume below. What happens if this reaches $10T in the future?With a take rate of 2% or so, we are looking at $200B in revenue. 20% profit margin would put us at $40B profit.... stick a P/E of 25 on it and we are looking at a $1T market capWhat does everyone think of these numbers? This is roughly what I keep calculating"
paypal going to $85?
Short on Paypal? what do you think?
PYPL just needs some positive news to get going again. If nothing happens there won’t be movement until next earnings.

Hell of an intraday reversal. $285 begining of pre market to $302 and back to $285. My guess is profit taking because of Bumble's IPO.....not to mention the parabolic move the last few days

PayPal breaking out nicely. Looking for 119+ in after market. Shorts got to cover with Hedge money flowing in.
Greeeat report1
My Pal looks to be Paying out today!
we are back @$90 soon
"paypal makes commission from all the traders of bitcoin in a few weeks time, it doesnt matter if it goes up or goes down,"
Let’s take out the all time high and start our assault on $86 with $90 already on the horizon.
support is 73. relax
This is starting to become a joke now
"Bravo PayPal ! It hit a new high of $274.94 ! Even allowing for some potential profit taking, it should get there again, and on its way to $300 once we hear all the new exciting announcements on PayPal Investor Day next Thursday. PayPal : Onward & Upward !!"
We need $75. $75 is the magic number.
There should be more upgrades coming soon because this company has a lot of cash similar to a mini Apple and can invest heavily for its growth aspirations. I love companies that invest for its future relevance!
$81 today!
on schedule to exceed the 120 price target put out last week.....this week.
Why are some people bearish of PayPal?
making loads of return in this flat market is as simple as buying pypl on any dips. just look at it go. new highs today.
"Both PYPL and SQ up today, possibly because of Coinbase's earnings. Fintech and those that own Bitcoin have an extremely bright future, and rates can only hold these names back for so long. Near term the upside may be limited, but long term it is the exact opposite. The returns over the past year in PYPL and SQ are only a taste of what lies ahead. PYPL's free cash flow will likely double over the next 5 years if the past few years are any indication. Excellent earnings growth, cash flow growth, and revenue growth. Valuation may be a concern but I'm convinced PYPL will grow into it. Unlike GME, PYPL actually has a solid future. Only an idiot would lump fintech in with stocks like GME and AMC."
PayPal price target $375 at MizuhoPayPal price target raised to $350 from $310 at CitiPayPal price target raised to $333 from $296 at Raymond JamesPayPal price target raised to $330 from $300 at SusquehannaPayPal price target raised to $329 from $302 at Morgan StanleyPayPal price target raised to $321 from $291 at Loop Capital
GREAT Earnings. Love this company
I'm starting to see alot more small businesses using clover instead of square and they accept paypal. paypal should buy them to fend off square. Ebay issue is a non issue. Nothing is set in stone with ebay anyway and paypal has the upper hand when the time comes to renegotiate. btw ebay was the weak link in that partnership. The opportunities for paypal is endless and brighter with or without ebay. So don't be scared to load up for easy money.

PayPal is one of the best companies to invest at the moment.
ARK bought another 20k shares today
PayPal is up 4.97% to 188.75
Getting ready to buy PayPal again!! Taking off very soon. Bought this at $44 and held to $75 like a month ago. Crushed it in blockchain stocks for a month. Will enter PayPal again in a week or so. Stay tune!!!
: ATH !
The bulls have it ! Back to $254 by ER
"Venmo just released debit cards. And in the last two months PayPal has acquired interest in several strategic companies. This is one of the few tech stocks that has been under looked despite tremendous growth. This is great news patient investors. But remember to always keep some dry powder to take advantage of broader downturns like today. I added more PYPL shares, and will add even more if there is further significant selling."
"In terms of the technology stack, going from monolithic to a micro services based platform has allowed PayPal to go from releasing 8 updates per year to over 17,000 updates per year since 2015!"
"I have held PYPL since they split from EBAY. I have as many shares of SQ as well. With PYPL seemingly flatlining, I am seriously considering selling a large portion. Any legitimate thoughts?"
SQ is over bought... Sell it now and buy PYPLDrop is a gif
This is a stable company. It will reach $100.00 for sure.
Bought a decent amount at 249. It will grow into its multiples quickly. I'll hold for at least a year
Looks like some shorts bailing.... congrats
Loving it!!! What a huge beat. Thank you!!!
$140 after earnings
How do y’all feel about this long term?
Paypal is even better than I hoped for.
Thnx for the discounted shares

Who here thinks amazon will strike a deal with paypal? I say with in 2 years

"Highest Close ever. Portends a new high soon. Maybe Wednesday; maybe later; but the odds are extremely good for a new all time high anyway here. Stocks that make new highs ""generally"" continue to make more new highs, and on and on and on. We are finally on the precipice of a new leg in this 2 year rally! IMHO"
"Congrats to those holding, ran up into this earnings, reversed initial decline a.h.Wish I could say the same with SQ. Pypl just a better pick in the space."
PAYPAL IS FOR THE PEOPLE
Well PYPL longs. Last month up 4.5% this week around 1%. aka average of 1% per week. Can't go wrong with this stock. Have great weekend everyone.
pypl could be UP like BITCOIN soon as digital payment will be dominant in this world shortly this year like bitcoin.....
do we think that eBay cutting them out as payment processing for sellers effective 2/1.. will affect there bottom line moving foward???
"Daniel Schulman already told you that PYPL benefits from the massive move of mobile payment, he also told that E commerce crosses the 50% line of the retail sales. So this morning when PYPL is down, I just step in."
I hope people took advantage of last weeks dip. good luck everyone.
"Buy opportunity, as it's on a recovery and moving back up to prior highs. Added"
Always dropping just before earnings report. And I'll bet the increase will be 242 $ back to the way it way. That is why it drops just before earnings. It's all planned by the BIG BOYS IN SUITS. It's all #$%$ .
I can imagine what will happen when Congress rejects the fourth stimulus package.This will be a shock to the tech sector.And if the Fed is still talking about a rate hike. Prices will return to the level of summer 2020)
Can PYPL reach $219 after earnings?
Free money who can say no.
first in China for a payment system? this will sky rocket
"This is really a good company. A time to jumping, guys!!!"
BUY PYPL and SQ - BITCOIN
"ANOTHER SURGE WILL BE LIKE THE LAST NAIL IN THE COFFIN. PYPL WILL BE AROUND 85 BY NEXT WEEK, THEN BIG JULY 4 TH FIREWORKS IN JANUARY."
"Market is crazy right now. If you want safe money invest in spacs, they usually trade around 10.5$ and if they merge they double.I recommend to invest in BFT they are going to merge with Paysafe (kind of Square and Paypal) and they are trading at 13.8$$BFT $SQ $PYPL $V $MA"
"Anyone who has finished reading the earning call transcript will not sell PYPL.....Honey integration into PayPal and Venmo will dramatically increase engagement and TPV, and in 2020 PYPL will move into offline POS through either NFC or QR Code in China and US....these movement will take PYPL to $400 by 2025."
Overseas prospects will bring PayPal well into $100 range.
So mad I didn’t get into pypl back in 2019 when it was on my radar.
"Amazon Pay got about 30 million accounts,compare to PayPal, which is considered the U.S. leader in digital wallets with 237 million global accounts and growing. Even if some small merchants add Amazon Pay, it does not mean the consumer will switch."
Pypl should be at least $100 atm imo. Hopefully we get something this year... Its been flat
party in here...
wow... is that it????
"Everybody is only talking about $PYPL beats expectations and related to $SQ. But another bullish sign is that $MA beats also and said:"" an increase in contactless payments could help support current quarter transactions following a stronger-than-expected second quarter earnings report."""
It would be nice to hear about the beginning of dividend payouts this quarter 
"Google earlier this year rebranded all of its payment services under Google Pay to help it double down on making transactions across its platform more frictionless (and more used). Now comes another development: PayPal and Google are kicking off a deep integration, where users who add their PayPal details to their Google Play accounts will be able to pay bills and for other items, using PayPal, without logging in and without leaving the Google services.The integration, when it goes live later this year, will cover apps like Gmail, YouTube, Google Store and any services using Google Pay -- and it will include not just payments but also peer-to-peer transfers."
"Hey guys :-), can someone please tell me why I can not post links here?"
Good news for Paypal.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seismic-shifts-cryptocurrency-market-may-194512034.htmlWho thinks PYPL will reach 350 by end of year and 550 by end of next year ?
Finally breaking through resistance and onto new unchartered territory!
buy buy buy PYPL
I warned u. Coinbase gonna pilfer market share from $fb $sq $pypl on digipayments
how isnt paypal 10% up after the china announcement?

Nervous?
Why is it that Square has more stories on this site than PYPL
PayPal PaysWell...GL
"Honey has been profitable since 2018.....and there should be some other undisclosed plan to use this platform.....for example, pay to be listed in comparison....?"
Everyone sell and short last night when I told you over $260 ORNO?
This really should not be down so much as it is not a covid play. Paypal has been a preferred payment method well before the pabdemic
I don’t see a bubble with fundamentals like this
i told you so!
"HUMBL is taking off in every city. Get in on the ground floor if you desire wealth. It really is just that simple! Not bashing PAYPAL, just wish I had the opportunity to get in to PAYPAL when it was $2.60 per share!!!!!"

Who else loves the fact that we're in striking distance of $PYPL whose market cap is over 3X SQ. Love!
The bank are consolidating to get the customersbefore they all go to the new banking system....to PYPLand the Bitcoin!Go PYPL!All Aboard!
"V (VISA) is half the valuation of PYPL and has greater revenue growth and a 50% profit margin. Ya sure PYPL is a good place to ""invest""?"
Cathie wood sold PYPL to buy Twtr... why?
Market crash or massive correction? going back to bed either way.
PayPal making moves!!!!
Did some news come out or did common sense just kick in? Either way this stock should be way UP!
$1T company in 5yrs!!! I’m calling it now!!! Growth will be off the charts!!!
SQ will demolish PayPal
"People seemed to have forgotten that Dan is correct in his assessment. Paypal has experienced delays in implementation of the technologies with partners. However, those issues (can anyone say IZettle having to wait on their anti-competition ruling?) have been resolved. I look for a revenue guidance correction to the POSITIVE in the third quarter because of these partnership resolutions and implementations!"
Jeffries just raised their target to $96 and expects big ER. It’s all good Amigos. :))
"Ummm, yeah about tomorrow morning "
I think you will see GROW move towards $5 this next week! Move in and don’t be afraid to lock in profits :)
"Congrats on those who loaded more shares when it was down, looks like it’s pulling back and beyond."
Hey Ben.... read the latest from Motley Fool where they conclude that PayPal is the better investment ... and DEAL WITH IT
Check out TSNP and Humbl merger. This new company is expected to be the next PayPal but with a Crypto currency twist. very interesting at a ground floor price.
"The damage to this portion of the Tech. sector is not going to be bad at all. Paypal is not an expensive stock when you look at what this company has achieved and will achieve. Financial stocks are a bigger risk, since top management in these banks were never removed, they have again indulged in practices which are not above board. It may well be this is why they are so worried about interest rates going up even a little. It may be possible that their loans are not so good. Wells Fargo may be the latest in this, the fact that their books did not meet expectations. Companies like paypal are the future. They challenge the concept of 20th century banks which really offer nothing in this space."
"This is one of my I use it may as well own it stocks. I love the product and all three of my kids use Venmo, so I'll take that over any and all analysts."
"Baird reiterates Outperform rating on PayPal with a $220 price target.rom 41.1% in 2019, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian tells investors in a research note. PayPal remains the most popular digital wallet ""by a wide margin, while rapid growth in Venmo adoption should provide a significant long-term monetization opportunity,"" adds the analyst. Sebastian views the survey results as largely confirmatory of positive Venmo trends, and he reiterates Outperform rating on PayPal with a $220 price target."
This should end in green..Earning estimates have been greatStocks hold Zacks#1 (strong buy)Online payment is booming..Buy on this dip...
ATH. Congratulations to all longs.
new ATH at 100.00… classy :-)
"Ladies and gentlemen,Heed these words... we are getting dangerously close in stock price as a potential takeover target. Amazon, Mastercard, and Visa would all be potential suitors in an aqusition. All that the bear posts are trying to get their ""puts"" and ""calls"" taken care of and folks are not looking at Paypal's fundamentals. But rest assured, these other companies are."
Amazon deal in offing IMHO and when that happens the stock will double.
"PYPL has been falling since Dec. 2017; along the way there have been so many negative news and opinions from competition landscape. However, the earning and all the metrics have been very strong. It looks like the short camp lost their shirt in 2017 while PYPL skyrocketed from $40 to over $80. I sense some manipulation here to drive the price down to recover some of their loss. Just be patient and the rising numbers will push the price to go higher probably in 2nd half of 2018."
good job longs!
Ebay changed the policy how sellers get paid. Ebay decoupled Paypal. Paypal will go down like hell...What you think?
Perfect head & shoulders formation right side down slope forming PayPUKE  R.I.P. Also trading at monthly lows into earnings and 20% off highs! I bet all you longs panic sell at $200
Yahoo message boards have made me over a million dollars this year. Thank you. I warned all of you this morning! I read 100 straight posts now this was going to $220 after earnings SO I shorted outright and bought puts when it was $192 this am. Hope to make 500%
This Wallet Investor and many others state regarding this wonderful stock from Friday's closing: 1 year PayPal Holdings Forecast: 450.493784 * 5 year PayPal Holdings Forecast: 1501.80
I told everyone here in early afternoon that PYPL stock was showing no evidence of optimism - as its stock price mirrored the NASDAQ. You had to sell by 3ish once it started to dip. Tell-tale evidence of when not to hold a stock into the close.
Several resistance levels smashed today. We are certainly seeing the long awaited breakout to 250. It is nice to have some affirmation that one’s analysis and charts are relatively accurate. I still believe a $300 pps is attainable within 6-8 months driven primarily by PYPLs recent adapations to fintech trends.
Also moving to SQ. PYPL market cap is 200 Billion. SQ just 40 billion
UPDATE: PayPal profit triples as pandemic drives continued surge in online payments
closed up 4 aces......nice
"PayPal is making acquisitions and partnerships every month, setting up the chessboard for domination in the online payments space. PayPal doesn’t want the spotlight because they want it to be too late for other companies to try and jump on just like amazon did. By the time everyone realized what amazon was to become it was too late for anyone to compete because the moat was too big. This is the biggest reason I love PayPal."
Another bloodbath on the whole broader market.... though the really consoling point is Paypal lost the least percentage wise today of any of the 15 on my watch list :-) As soon as the market turns around Paypal's great fundamentals will have its shares recovering at the forefront : big time !
"Well well well. Would you look at that recovery. Thanks to the ones who sold to me at 176usd. Can sell it now for a fast profit and wait with the ones i bought yesterday, and sell them too with a profit."
This stock is a beast!! So glad I'm in. Going to be an exciting year.
Here is the change in PayPal transaction amounts quarter to quarter. Billions. It is really accelerating. 2020 Q4 +30.382020 Q3 +24.962020 Q2 +31.162020 Q1 -8.832019 Q4 +20.732019 Q3 +6.312019 Q2 +10.872019 Q1 -2.162018 Q4 +20.652018 Q3 +3.62018 Q2 +7.04
"you guys think Facebook will invade PayPal's pond with it's crypto plans? I own both, but I'm just curious if a narrative is emerging...."
"Paypal is floating at very attractive prices, don't miss, BUY!"
"Here is my theory. $PYPL, $SQ, $MA and $V are all reporting this week or by the end of month. The big boys are pushing the price down because they anticipate bad reports for the payment sector. When the report gets released, retail investors and algos will sell at the already reduced price, pushing price even lower. Thats when the big boys can scoop up all the shares at a low price."
"PayPal slowly putting the ebay news behind it, heavy on the slowly part. But maybe turning the corner, especially with the sports betting deal."
Loading up this is a steal
After hours not looking good....could be a buying opportunity...but why the drop off???
"ESTIMATE IS 52 CENTS, WHISPER IS 54 CENTS,THE FAR EAST NUMBER IS 61 CENTS."
"If you consider that the earnings report only sets the stock price back about a week, this will be seen as a small bump in the road and an opportunity to get in or add at a good price."
There will be more lock downs coming fully or partially in most of the states by the governors. Even if Trump don't agree with it.
Beat + raised guidance = stock down... weird
PYPL will break $100 this week..

Bought back in at 79.85. The force is strong here.
There is more than enough opportunity for PayPal and Square to be successful. Visa and MasterCard are competitors and they are both successful. PayPal is a larger company so the price will not appreciate as fast as Square. Stay long with PayPal and you will make a lot of money.
Sq Zoom pass PayPal
I use ebay because of paypal
"Closed over $270...yeah, baby.If Analyst day goes well next week, don't be surprised to kick through $285.00 boys and girls."
"How do I cancel my account. Tried to go to web page, but can't get in.They keep asking for cell phone. I do not have a cell phone."
Great buying opportunity. Don’t miss it and suffer regret
It keeps testing above 86 but won’t hold. It’s just stronger and stronger each time though (going higher each time). I expect it to break 52 week highs today or tomorrow. Prove me right $PYPL.
Is tomorrow an up day???
$309 to $220 in 2 weeks Nice stonk
PYPL just issued 2.485 million shares today.
It’s obvious that some funds reduced their position. I said earlier that 230 should hold. I would understand selling at 300 level but not at 230-240 area. The bottom is in...IMO
"PYPL, DKNG and GMBL will be big winners going forward imo"

"I warned you month ago!!! figure it out yourself.I have updated my ebay to not use paypal. It’s now simpler to get paid on eBayYou’ve completed signing up for eBay to manage your payments.

"Just don't understand the talk about competing with V and MA. Read SQ's 10K or read along... SQ is basically at mercy of Payment Network operators like V and MA. SQ does not and will not compete directly with these two stalwarts. That's how their business is structured. SQ has to obey rules set by these Payment Networks. Period. Secondly, their 10k clearly states Visa was and is an early investor in SQ. 10% Preferred stock owner. Go figure. $Bullish $SQ $PYPL $V $MA $BABA"

Nice and expected movement today. Next stop 220. PYPL has become the cornerstone of International monetary transactions and its platform and customer base is growing. exponentially now. I will not be surprised to see $300+ by December (and possibly a 2/1 split on the board). SQ an acquisition target?
Sell on the news. EBay will stop using PayPal.
Ringing up some sales!
new ath fam! (the only broken record i like to spin)
"Paypal was beat up today for no real reason, other than the imagined effect that interest rates will have going back to a very low normal. Back in the 1990's interest rates were in the 5-7% percent range and the economy was healthy. Gas was 1.10 a gallon. Today with interest rates at 3% there is fear. Companies like Paypal will only grow. Underneath all of this is a world economy where now India and China are finally part of the mix for the first time since colonialism. And Africa will be next. These areas are skipping traditional merchant accounts and moving straight to Paypal type companies. This growth for Paypal will most likely continue for many decades."

PayPal is up 6.02% to 300.22
"AMZN will hit 1240-1250 this week. AMZN is the E-commerce internet and the rest of the internet fight against AMZN. i mentioned AMZN since last week. I will mention again that AMZN will move up another 30 points this week. I will bet on PYPL by end of DEC, not now."
Jim Cramer's take on PayPal after speaking with Dan Schulman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbykz-M_qoE
anyone listen to me and sell PYPL and buy Square
Anorther week ... another SQ significant out-performance of PYPL 13.3% versus 2.48% .... it's been this way for 2 years and will continue!!
Square seems to be where it's at! might put my money over there with Jack Dorsey:)

4% of PYPL revenue comes from eBay-PayPal CFO John Rainy
Whats everyones guess on PYPL s earnings today. I think $.60
"Huge huge volume from institutions getting in around 171-172, looks like all the shorts and small player stop losses got triggered"
PYPL accepts Bitcoin as payment. Doesn't pypl then end up holding Bitcoin?
EZ money.
If Amazon beats expectation by a big margin then we can expect Paypal also doing so. Even though Amazon doesn't support Paypal it is still a good indicator of how E-commerce has performed.
Investor day starts in an hour lol LETS GO PYPL GOOOO
So surge in demand for April May but they pull guidance?
Berenberg now rating PayPal a buy.
$4B for $100M in revenue. UBERed but on a much larger scale.
Let's guess the close today … obviously higher the better but I can see a $94.72 close
Nowadays even with great earnings some stocks still crash. Hoping this isn't one of them.
Looks like one last shakeout then back to 82+
"What a swing today, Jeez...."
I really hope PYPL will buy SHOP (Shopify) to create giant e-commerce. It is very logical step to grow in an area PYPL not strong. It will be marriage made in heaven for the stock.
awesome stock
Pay pal beat! BOOYA
"Did anyone listen  to me and sell $260 pre market, short it, and on the open buy the 250 weekly put options expiring tomorrow for pennies now up 200%????? I got 10 thumbs down on that trade so I knew I would cash out HUGE"
Yesterday was a bottom. The previous two days were very small loss. We should be good from this point. PYPL - A great company with very good earning and outlook enters into Chinese market. It has a good potential. Jump in now.
A nice 3.9MIL share trade to end the day.
why is pypl down when every other stock is up. Why is a vaccine negative for PayPal?
Whispers...PayPal in talks to buy Robinhood
Paypal is a solid piece of my portfolio pie.
Here comes new 52 week high!
Is it still a good time to get a position here?
"Chickens are starting to come home to roost for all those who call PYPL ""paypuke."" What can I say...you bet against this monster you will get eaten. SQ shorts being roasted alive too. Shorting fintech is like lighting a match when there's a gas leak...it's not a question of if you will get burned, but how badly."
114 today? Who would have thought?
Stay strong!........ Don't give any back!
"I posted that SQ was reporting today (Mon.) My mistakes, its the 27th or 28th. Didn't mean to confuse anyone!"
Upgraded today by Zacks investment from hold to buy.
will go much higher
The pull back is not justified on any company data at all. In fact the earnings reports showed an increase of growth not a slowdown. But people want to believe that somehow Paypal is slowing down. They are deluding themselves and falling victim to a short game.
How large is the share repurchase program
Finishing at the high of the day....nice move for PYPL
PYPL is lagging behind its peers. WHY? PYPL is the best financial stock out there. Cathie Wood has been loading up on PYPL. 
"Said that last week, say that again now.This doesn't bother me the least. Nobody can keep a stock with an endless tsunami of tailwinds behind it down for long.Anyone who is panicking now should not even be in stocks at all."
PYPL should finish today up over $230 - I anticipate $250 by the end of the year. Crypto plus the pandemic will propel this stock to new heights.
PYPL will destroy earnings and up grade all future estimates
Great interview with Cramer. Jim anointed them thick de facto future winner in the digital payment arena.
SQ Q3 net rev up 140% yoy because of investments in Crypto Currency space; revenue from retail and online transactions were up only a tiny bit. PayPal finally joined the party... thank goodness.
Another acquisition! Simility acquisition announcement!!
"By the time earnings come out next month, AMZN will be 1200, GOOG will be 115o, and PYPL will be 85."
Someone shook weak hands out hard today. Upgrade to $170 and this fell. Did the same thing when it got upgraded to $150 then ran up. PYPL typically runs when the rest of the markets are taking a breather. Would not be shocked to see this over 150 tomorrow.
Yet another all time high. This company just loves making all time highs. I got into this one early after the IPO mostly because I use PayPal for one of my businesses everyday and was familiar with the company. It’s been a big winner and we are just getting started. No end in sight.
This makes me feel better about the refund they forced me to do on a sold item recently..
the Mona Lisa of charts

Go ahead. Sell ur shares. I’ll take em. Gladly.

"PayPal stock named 'best idea' at Wedbush, price target raised to $100By Emily BaryPublished: June 8, 2018 8:45 a.m. ET 0 Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri added PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -2.28% to his firm's ""best ideas"" list on Friday and raised his price target on PayPal's stock to $100 from $90. With the price-target increase, Katri becomes one of the two most bullish analysts tracked by FactSet. ""We believe ongoing/recent monetization efforts on both consumer and merchant-facing platforms, Visa V, -1.79% /Mastercard MA, -1.81% /banking partnerships, as well as post-eBay EBAY, +1.25% separation potential opportunities could potentially accelerate top-line growth, while expanding margins,"" Katri wrote. He thinks the company's recent iZettle acquisition ""significantly boosts the company's merchant-facing monetization effort"" and predicts that PayPal's Pay with Venmo initiative will gain more momentum. Shares of PayPal are down 0.4% in premarket trading but up 53% this year, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% has gained 14%."
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares are trading higher on Monday after Evercore reportedly named the stock its top 2021 payment pick.
Cramer must be pumpin it now.SQ has a 210 PE.PYPL should be higher.
We will be taking out the old high shortly. Stock is poised to break out in a big way.
"• Revenue of $5.46 billion; growing 25% on a spot and FXN basis.• GAAP operating margin of 17.9%, expanding 198 basis points; non-GAAP operating margin of 27.2%, expanding 377 basis points.• GAAP EPS of $0.86, up 121%; non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 41%. GAAP EPS includes a net gain of $0.13 on strategic investments, driven primarily by MercadoLibre"
Slow and steady. Enjoy the ride and buy on any big dips.

"As a relative newbie in the stock market, I don't understand this massive after-hours sell-off. After reading the report, I was thinking I made a gamble that paid off big-time - looks as though I am sadly mistaken. Can someone help me understand why PYPL is tanking? Thank you."
Been in Paypal for a Month Just loaded up on Calls and Shares Let's go !
"Breaking: PayPal price target raised to $206 from $131 at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst James Faucette raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $206 from $131 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The shift to online driven by the COVID-19 pandemic will drive ""stronger for longer"" U.S. e-commerce growth, said Faucette, who sees PayPal being set to grow total purchase volume at or ahead of the rate of e-commerce growth ex-Amazon. He sees opportunities for PayPal to deliver 20% or faster compounding earnings growth as more profitability flows through to the bottom line, he added."

"The annual investor meeting is on May 23rd at 8 AM Pacific Time. We can expect to hear more about the acquisition details and their plans after eBay. The PayPal CFO said yesterday that they actually expect to make more profit once they are no longer tied to eBay. If you were planning to sell any shares in PayPal, I would recommend holding off until the annual meeting. For me, this company is a definite buy for the long-term."
Musk is playing with investors and showing how easy it is for one with power to manipulate the markets. Too much THc and not enough Lithium! PYPL DOES NOT need BITCOIN to make a profit.
"From Nasdaq ""PayPal Holdings, Inc. ( PYPL ) is reporting for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. The internet software company's consensus earnings per share forecast from the 12 analysts that follow the stock is $0.52. This value represents a 30.00% increase compared to the same quarter last year. In the past year PYPL has beat the expectations every quarter. The highest one was in the 3rd calendar quarter where they beat the consensus by 7.69%. Zacks Investment Research reports that the 2018 Price to Earnings ratio for PYPL is 50.91 vs. an industry ratio of -25.00, implying that they will have a higher earnings growth than their competitors in the same industry.

Paypal will SMASH the earnings next week!!
time to break 52 week high soon
"I predict that by the end of this coming week, Paypal will be testing it's all time high again, that is around $86 a share......looking forward to hearing all the great news that will come out on Investor Day later in the week ! Buy-in soon folks or regret it later!"
"Guys.. just finished listening to investors presentation. My thoughts:- projecting some amazing numbers for next 5 years - great roadmap. They have a lot of very useful products that will easily catch on- this is all organic growth. If they do M&A, they can grow their numbers even faster - all world trends favour them. The move to a cashless economy will continue - they have BOTH the merchant and consumer side (not many companies do!)I could go on.... Overall. I predict some very nice growth in the long term."
Your too good to me PayPal....stop it
"$21 more dollars to my earlier forecast July 1, 2018 price. Now I'm looking for $105."
Let it find support before buying.
Does PayPal not own hundreds of millions if not now billions in crypto? I think this the lagging play for crypto & their business just seems undervalued right now.
pypl can only be used for online right? do they have cards to use over the counter?thanks in advance.
I’m in!
what time is the ER?
Guy Adami target price of $350 per share for PYPL.
"It is no secret at this point that eBay, one of the world’s largest online marketplaces, will be replacing PayPal as its main payments processing provider. eBay had purchased PayPal back in 2002 and spun it off in 2015, but the two organisations had remained tightly linked, with PayPal continuing to process payments for eBay. Now, this will change.With the rapid growth and acceptance around the world of PayPal as a strong ecommerce payment option and PayPal being the preferred payment method for most customers who buy and sell on eBay, many may be wondering why eBay would do this.There are several reasons why this move makes sense for the company, and they all come down to the three “Cs”: customer (experience), control, and costs."
"It is so fast, so I have to move my cover call higher. I guess PYPL will hit new high next week."
Major reversal here 240 any moment now
Amazing stock - everyday new ATH 
Great time to buy in my opinion
PYPL may be waking up?!?!
new price target of 102. 125 if you ask 3rd point..lol

New 52 week high. Well done PYPL!
This dip is a gift.Start accumulating.
Great stock great run so far might hit $300 in another one or two years?
Venmo is going to be huge for PayPal tomorrow. The young kids are using it like crazy. It has more of a social aspect than PayPal. For that reason I am long and hoping for a double beat tomorrow.
Gap dwindling......... Let's go PayPal!
High growth stocks as PYPL are back in vogue after giving a great buying opportunity over the last days.
Well I was spot on $82 AH and $85 during todays session.
now is definitely the time to buy into paypal if you haven't. I am already all in so just riding it out. will hold for years
Any ideas why PYPL price is not performing? Why there is a very slow rise but extremely quick fall and won't hold $90 and not keeping up pace with any other competitor? - Nothing but promises. Best appears to be sideways and downward price movements.
For the people who say that Paypal P/E is too high now. Look at Amazon's P/E in the past 6 years. From 2015 to 2018 it was all above 100. The stock price has surged rapidly and the P/E has also decreased. I believe something similar will happen to Paypal.
Very impressive on a brutal day. This baby is heading higher in the coming weeks
"Honestly, I am pumped about todays retrace. Consolidation were expected after positive news. MM's will capitalize on this short-term, without a doubt... watching the VIX"
Headed back to 52 week highs! Lets go!
I warned PYPL shorties to cover before it topped 200...too late now. The life of a PYPL short is fire and chaos...I've owned since the split from EBAY. And I retained shares in EBAY. EBAY has made me money but not like PYPL. I am sitting on a 5 bagger with PYPL. Shorts get chump change in comparison. This stock along with SQ is the future of business payments. I use both Venmo and CashApp and both are amazing. Shorts will continue to suffer betting against this. Long and strong now and forever.
"With all its forthcoming innovations due for release and great earnings report due soon Paypal will be back to all time highs and beyond, very soon"

Best earnings I have seen in a long time for any stock. Should trade under $200 sometime in May. Save this brilliance
Tomorrow buying back the dipBargain price
Thought the earnings call was super positive and gave good outlook for the further! Anyone else think so?
80 close
Paypal buys another business to propel themselves towards the cashless domination juggernaut that they are/will become. This is just the start
Again!
Should be over 100...are you kidding me. Hottest sector apart from pot stocks and this acts like a defensive stock. Even Kraft was up today!!!
It's about time that we should start getting some $110+ price targets
Couple more days to the astounding news of great user numbers ^^^^^^up we go
"HFs are rebalancing again, and PYPL is a buy. The race with SQ is back on again, neck and neck."
Another 3 % today and tomorrow moving forward
"Still 3 bucks below ATH, which was achieved right before the ebay announcement. That was a major set back."
Lots behind the curtains that are so positive for the future of this great company
"I see this trading pattern before, PYPL went up to 74+, then pulled back. I guess PYPL will go up over 74 again this afternoon."
FAKE moved down....should be UP FAST HIGHER soon this week....
Red today? What a joke. What’s wrong with this stock?
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. This is just the beginning. Enjoy the ride for years to come.
Thanks PYPL for chance to buy below 90.
All time high going into the earnings call...this should be interesting. Like I told them before the shorts should just Venmo me now!!!
Why can't PYPL hold a price ?
Can it drop $100 tonight to new 52 week lows? It’s already down 20% into earnings so you know things are going to be real bad
"Should’ve bougut more of this stock when it was around 200... love PayPal. Great app, and some awesome initiatives"
all aboard
The people who are bearish on PayPal are the same people who bought GameStop at $398 
This company is worth..one trillion dollars
"PYPL can partner with both Walmart and Amazon and Ebay can continue to loose money like it did this quarter. This is no reason to sell, market manipulation seems to be at play here."
"Chris, we always appreciate what you publish. "
This will be in the 80s by earnings.
Algo trading is fully confused on which way to go. Good job software geeks!
Road to 250
"Please. PayPal is rich. Square is still trying to break even, plus SQ is all speculation... they don't even have an EPS..."
To be completely honest yesterday's sell off to $75 was an ABSOLUTE GIFT! Not only did we get rid of the weak hands (non-believers) but I was able to buy PYPL at a nice discount.

"There you go Big losses, sell all those imaginary shares.."
I’ve been an eBay member since 2004. Sold over 3500 items. I will never sign up with another company besides PayPal. I’d rather take money orders and cashiers checks.
"Vaccine's far from available as it must go through long period of FDA approval, so as usual could take several months or at least 1/2 years to be available for everyone.... buy today 's dip is a holiday gift...."
Does anyone know if PayPal is one of the companys that will send money to small biz through the Government loan program.
"Just like every pull back every stock gets thrown out with the bath water - great time to pick winners over losers and buy in at a discount. This will double it's growth in two years so thanks to all the runners, weak hands and uninformed here, maybe go and buy Bitcoin or something else more speculative."
80+ open...
we shall see 250 in the future!Don't sell!!!
"Hello mama  not bad for one days worth of work, huh boys "
"PYPL has had a great run up lately. Looks like a normal profit taking correction, imo. Financials, growth, and future still very strong. I personally consider corrections like this as opportunities to add to my long position."

"At the end the earnings number next month will speak for itself. I don't worry about any BS your guys concern about the data breach. As long as earnings come out over 63 cents, and revenue is up over 40%, I am happy. All I know that EPS 2018 will be at least $3.25. Let me tell you that P-P loan is a big business that Swift moves in real fast, the interest rate they charge is over 30% per year,that is the reason why SQ wants to get the bank permit. PYPL has over 15 mil merchant accounts and PYPL users over 200 mil. that is the gold mine, which SQ sees it too. The most important thing that Dan wants is monetizing VENMO, but he just moves slowly to make sure that we want to VENMO every thing. When everybody VENMOs, it is done, which I think it will take another year or two, which i can wait."
Nice cup and handle formed for our next move up!
Looks like PYPL is set to make a strong move upwards. Lots of big Funds putting it on its radar along with the whole Fintech sector. Think we break $100 in the near future.
"There were 2 upgrades for PYPL, the price moved around 1.40 but closed at .47 up. Today there is interview about VENMO that the guy explained VENMO is in the long game, this may be the reason PYPL pops up more that 1 point,"
Beat consensus. Should see a 20% drop since earnings were so good
"When PayPal announced their forray into Bitcoin the stock became a Bitcoin play because the company actively started buying Bitcoin. So, if you own shares of PayPal then you own Bitcoin indirectly This attracted a new type of investor to PayPal "
$210 by end of the week.
"I’m not just looking at this ER... even if it’s little low, the outlook is looking great. This, Disney, and BAC are three I plan to hold for at least few years."
"Now that most of the weak handed traders and Robinhood investors are shaken out, let's go back to work."
"a little pullback today is expected. nothing to see here, but some more if you can and move along"
PYPL will deliver Wednesday eveving!!!! BUY...BUY...BUY!
Let’s break $90 after ER. Expecting a huge number and growth guidance.
Beautiful reversal today!!!!!
"just a thought....why Paypal is not partnering with big retailers like walmart, Costco or Target or Amzn.....I know most of them payment partners in place but getting someone like Walmart or Amzn where online purchases have skyrocketed and will continue to boom post pandemic makes perfect sense. May be, it may not be that profitable for paypal but look at the volume.....that will be gigantic......what you guys think?"
"After hours means nothing, guarantee it's up tomorrow after big money is satisfied with a solid entry point and the weak sell on fear. Venmo will be huge for this company!"
"PYPL missed on top and bottom last quarter and barely beat revenue target this quarter. With a vaccine imminent, this stock's growth potential will tremendously slow down."
Goldman joined the hundreds of payment systems today with a new card called Deserve for those without much credit history.
Why is PYPL down today? It has absolutely no reasons to be down.
if paypal has a great earnings from venmo profits and other ventures. we could see a small tech rebound. we need strong earnings from techs to move this market back higher
Volume is decent but does not suggest capitulation....I'm not sure if that's good though
"Ark sold PayPal 75K+ shares , ICE 37k shares today. Bought 89K+ shares of COIN."
"I'm patiently riding out the turbulence. The blockbuster quarter combined with the fall in the stock price tells you buying this dip in PYPL is a no brainer. The future in PYPL is so bright. Fintech is replacing the traditional way of business transactions in the same way light bulbs replaced oil lamps, and the way EVs will supplant gas cars. Free cash flow in PYPL will likely double in 5 years, and their cash pile will likely also grow tremendously. The cyclical and commodity stocks aren't going to get a whole lot more love from here. Eventually the market will be forced to rotate back into the companies that are the future such as SQ and PYPL. When I look at PYPL I'm not looking at the present. I'm looking 5 years into the future. PYPL may not be cheap on valuation metrics, but compared to the future prices it is extremely cheap. Going back over $300 is not a question of if but when."
"I'm long, just entered now, but my plan was only to buy for the short term, and exit around 250$ per share, I might stay Long if I can justify it won't go lower in the longer term this weekend after I do some deeper investigating, but for the moment a retrace is very very likely, at least to near or to 250$ per share before it keeps going down.Short-Term -> Bullish,Medium-Term -> Bearish,Long-Term -> probably BullishI personally do not feel like investing in this company, not at this price, maybe I will trade long term, either way, if I plan to go longer, a more strict stop loss will be needed in my opinion, the price is a bit too high at the moment, maybe it would be better around 150$-200$ per share..."
PYPL vs SQ vs MA vs V. Which stock would you prioritize for growth portfolio for the next 5 years?

PYPL no doubt up today due to Bitcoin. PYPL shorts’ finances were already on fire prior to Bitcoin but Bitcoin has only served to throw gasoline on them. 300 is coming.
"Cha-Ching 0h, Doctor! Bought at $90. Staying Long"
Run it up
"Relax. 5 more years with Ebay - and plenty of time to build new customer bases and grow Paypal.... this isn't a startup folks, it's a well-established professionally run operation. Price will bounce tomorrow"
"PayPal price target raised to $255 from $228 at Piper SandlerPiper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $255 from $228 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following today's presentation by its CEO Daniel Schulman at an industry conference. The analyst says the discussion has indicated that the company could be on a path to a ""Super App"" status and cites China's WeChat as a ""good example"", which started as a messaging app and then expanded into payments, shopping, ride-hailing and other uses. Donat adds that CEO Schulman believes that future consumers will have 6-10 apps that they use everyday, and he ""wants PayPal to be one of those apps."""

What happened to PayPal...
I bought into visa and alibaba but you know it was hard not buying PayPal it very bullish on it hopefully when I get money I can make PayPal as big as my visa position

Today looked like the beginning of an uptrend IMO
Shopping list tomorrow
"Let's be honest here guys. Who really knows what they have bought here? What can I buy with DOGE today? I admit, I got sucked into the frenzy, and made money, but until $PYPL or $AMAZ takes DOGE, this won't do much more. Yea maybe you could hold for another Elon tweet, but there might be better opportunities meanwhile. I don't think you will lose money, but I do think it will take time before it jumps again."
Earnings out. Beat by $0.04 per share.
"PayPal price target goes to $312 and Outperform, tops Evercore ISI list of 2021 payment stock picks"
We are actually in the green?!?!
"pypl only acts as an agent for cryptocurrency and gets its profit from the margins between the sell and buy prices from cryptocurrency to USD. it can only make tons of money from this business not loose - the ""bank"" never losses from exchanging currencies. so if the pypl stock dropped due to bitcoin concerns its ""fake news"" driven and will quickly rebound..."
I think cramer is trying to push PYPL down so he can buy it. Any thoughts
"easy buy, 100 a share in 2018 is inevitable"

"Lot of growth left for PayPal. Had great year and 4th quarter earning report. will still be an option for buyers to use on ebay at least until 2023. If you still have a PayPal account, why would you use something else on ebay. I know I wouldn't switch. PayPal is secure convenient and easy to use for checkout."
Ebay news has been way overblown. Throw out the ebay news and what do you see? A FANTASTIC report. Up up and away.

"The Ant IPO is expected to work favorably for the digital payments and fintech industry, so PYPL is expected to get enhanced investors’ attention post the IPO.

"Very light pre-mkt volume. Some cautiousness with Bitcoin movement and SQ earnings. SQ expected to surpass estimates, however investors need to understand that SQ revenue base is unlike PYPL. I still see PYPL as having tremendous potential and continuing growth short & long term. Expect to see some analyst upgrades if the 161 floor holds. GLTA!"

Highest close since January 31st. Portends more good things to come!
CEO sounds very positive. You can hear it in his voice.. Just my opinion.
Curious your thoughts if paypal should / could buyout square?
amazing price...it's a buy
"Even the CEO knew to sell over $300! That flash crash  the other day from 302 to 280 was the beginning of the end of PayPuke, showed just how frail & weak this stock was"

Oh todays looking gooooood
Wish I bought some last October....
Be over $100 shortly and once it does it will fly.
Whatever will add more position tomorrow.
I am happy to exit at 120 PE.Far better than the standard PE of 12 for a growth company in recession. Share price would just be $20 a piece at 12 PE.
about time they made a move
Definitely a buy
Honestly this stock should have never sold off after earnings. This was a gift. The guidance was misunderstood and people overreacted. This stock would currently be over $100 if not for the guidance reaction. Take advantage of this opportunity or miss out.
"Unfortunately 10 year bond yields are creeping up again, could be a sign of another 10-20% sell off. I'm not a short however something to think about..."
"Today the market just waits for the big cap earnings, COST, ADBE and ORCL. I guess all of them beat the estimate, but I don't know how the market reacts. The index ups a lot this morning and then pull back which is normal because it went up 5 days in a row. But I still think the market still has up-leg today because Yellen said that high valuation stock does not mean overvalue, and the fair value today is way higher than the actual. All I know that ADBE will beat the estimates by a mile. PYPL will be absolutely the winner in Jan."
"PayPal price target raised to $345 from $300 at BTIGBTIG analyst Mark Palmer raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $345 from $300 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. Management in offered ""ambitious"" five-year guidance during last week's investor day and ""sounded highly confident while doing so,"" Palmer tells investors in a research note. He believes the presentation made clear that management believes PayPal's recent strong growth ""would not only be sustained, but also accelerated."""

Nothing more than a pullback to establish a new base. If you’re long this doesn’t matter diddly-squat.

"I like MC and Visa but Paypal is also a great stock to hold. If you buy products across countries, Paypal is the only payment system you can use and still have some guarantee you won't be ripped off. You can't get this with bank transfers and most companies don't accept Visa or MC if they don't have a store. This is an opportunity to buy right now."
a green Day for fintechs it seems. PayPal is red at mo but often has a biased spread making it look redder than it really is
Everyone pulled their money out of paypal & put it into SQ.

Good time to begin the buyback?
Was able to get 100 more shares with a 227 handle
UP MORE NEXT WEEK DUE TO STIMULUS PACKAGE APPROVAL FOR 1.9 TRILLIONS....
Think I’m pulling out my gains and investing in SQ I see SQ has more room to run.
Paypal said it will eventually allow people to pay through Btc and also they only allow you to buy in the usa rn. When it rolls out globally and when they eventually allow payments through bitcoin both paypal and btc will rise together even further.
all of the fintech industry will grow wether it’s PayPal or it’s competitors! There is no firm specific risk for PayPal so the excess return will happen but I am sure PayPal with its brand name will do better than it’s competitors
Profit triples. Strongest quarter in history. Next quarter will be huge with those cryptos transactions. Long and hold.
"Looks like profit taking, if so, good loading opportunity"
"I hold many stocks in my portfolio. Names like $MSFT $PYPL and Apple had their big run LAST YEAR during the pandemic. Other sectors are just now crawling back but are still way behind tech. I have a feeling that the bigger gains this year will be had in banks, cyclicals, industrials. Basically the reopening stocks. This is fine by me as own many of those names. I’m sitting on MASSIVE GAINS with Apple and other tech names. Wall St loves to rotate. It’s what they do!Sincerely,Briscoe R."
"Fintech is coming of age, only sped up by the pandemic. This company will continue to deliver Amazon-like returns for the next 20 years. Five-year lookout is but a blip on the radar of the long-term growth story. Keep adding incrementally/holding, you will crush the market."
Robinhood can close and PYPL can be another Brokerage???Wonderful so many business!!!
Cathie wood must be kicking herself. lost 75m in potential gains from when she had sold 2m shares
HMBL has blockchains of cryptocurrency and they have the patent on it called ETX’s. PayPal cannot do this and HMBL is into NFT’s also- money to money transfers worldwide. Sorry PayPal

I'm long and I will see you guys in December when PYPL is at $125."
Triple bottom? I’m watching it to see if there’s a break out higher. MACD looks bullish.

Have we shaken out all of the Robinhooders yet? Once we do we can make a sustained run back to the old highs.
Hold the line for the afternoon bounce. All the quick profit flippers will shake out and panic here in the first 1.5-2 hours.
"Priced for a move of $4.85. Couple that with a broader market rally, this thing has moved almost exactly what the Market Makers predicted."
How about tough time for square ahead and PayPal takes on there market
PayPal is a international stock
"What a wonderful world. PYPL sells receivable, free up the reserve. It is really good move. It surprises me when it raises earnings over 30%. How about P-P in India which just starts. OMG"
Destroyed it
If you wanted to buy PayPal you may just have missed your opportunity. IMHO anything under $275 is in the WAY Overcorrected price.

GUYS i cant wait - one day - pypl announces support of cryptocurrency - wow!
"Insider buys at the market price at 74, few months ago. Schulman gave some clue about massive mobile transaction and E-commerce surging over 50%, plus Rainey does not worry about VENMO's rival such as ZELLE. Let me tell you some thing, ZELLE takes 2 days to transfer money, and has the max. limit per day and per month. It is for P-P, not for the business. VENMO is for P-P and business. VENMO has head start over 3-4 years before ZELLE. So it is no brainer to compare apple and orange."
Credit Suisse $91 price target.
"okay, let's go paypal...."
What happened haha. Great start took a small turn. I still expect a green close.
4 more days this year to print $250. With a second round of stimulus & PayPal playing a part (again) I think we will print $250 by end of year.
130 shortly
Long
"no big deal. 13% from ebay will be made up before 2023. keep loading, cheap price if it goes down."
Big you can short again at 130. That's when the cup will be fully formed and the handle will be your opportunity to.
there is noting proprietary about online payment solutions. watch as the margin crunch kills this. 3% 2% 1.5% 1 % bye bye
Down with the unemployment news . Won’t see much jobs in the future as AI increases!! Less qualified job seekers!
PayPal has sold off and bounced back everyday this week.
PYPL should be around $88.00 on earnings day/
seems like 203 and 204 are the buybacks mark's today. tmrw we will be up again.
Forgot to mention Bullish
PayPal just struck a deal with Chevron and not to mention that the Phoenix Suns (NBA team) also made a global partnership with PayPal. I guess people are not seeing the news because we have a lot going for us guys hang in there
"PayPal finally getting past the eBay hit. Now they can now get back on the growth path and hit $100 , hopefully by November."
"BIG MOJO comes to PYPL. It is the perfect moment to move this week. PYPL will have another 7 more days to see what direction the hedge funds will go. As far as I see, they start to back up the truck to load PYPL., the volume tells the whole story. 87 is absolutely possible. Now I raise my case to 90 by next Friday."
least 288-290 Today$300+ tomorrow.We still have investor's day on Friday.$330 is the target
Clear sailing to $121 . Arriba!

If you owned paypal through the 2018 market drop you will remember how it far outpaced the recovery of the market. Same thing happening again. Flight to safe profitable growth. New ATHs sooner than you may think.

"I love this company, my paypal crypto holding so far 100% return on my initial investment in just one month. Ethereum, lite and cash coin. Did not even need to open a crypto account. best financial company ever. Thanks to Elon Musk."
"Big, dead money here? Are you kidding me? PayPal ended day in green."
"Does someone upgrade PYPL, why PYPL just pop up to 1.60 in less than 5 min."
wow - all getting dumped once again... HOLD strong... for backup
Down againBuying more before closing bellIts going lower
"This is the most important information from the call and what will drive pypl to new highs:Schulman also pointed to Pay With Venmo as a priority in the year ahead, referring to a function that lets Venmo users purchase items and services with their accounts much like they would with the traditional PayPal button.“There’s a lot of work going on around that right now because we think that’s a very big opportunity that we did not take as much advantage of last year as we probably could have,” he said."
WOW. Another stellar performance by PayPal.
"How myopic can investors be?! A “projected” leveling of 4th QTR earnings is no reason for such a deep sell off, as I have no doubt that PYPL will once again exceed analyst expectations. Realize too, we are entering another phase of the pandemic as flu season approaches, schools and social venues continue to close at alarming rates, and the government handlings is on a precept of turmoil. Again, we have a strengthening position in cryptocurrencies, an exponentially growing client base, and a world forced in to electronic banking transactions. I really see no other possible direction that up from here. I could go on and on, and admit I am aghast at the direction this took, but the markets never fail to shock and awe investors and traders alike. I am now ready to await PYPLs next surprise and the markets reaction. GLTA!"
"incredible. totally got complacent on PYPL look at them now. since dip, about to break out. can't get em all"
It will be 4+ today.
Who thinks we go green today into strong ER?

"When you listen to the CEO, he is one of the best out there. He has a vision and a plan. He also understands the industry and where it is headed. You would be hard pressed to find a better positioned company and the acquisitions just add to that. This is a great long term investment stock. I have owned it since the 30's right after the spinoff from Ebay"
Highs earningsThis stock will reach the moon tomorrowBuy Buy Buy
For once PYPL is rallying while SQ is standing still. This stock has quietly roared higher this week. Either it's just me or PYPL doesn't seem to be as sensitive to the movements of Bitcoin as SQ is. Is that judgment correct? Whatever the reason I've made a lot of money with both PYPL and SQ. I am fully confident in them going forward many years into the future and also bulling on Bitcoin long term.

All aboard the train has left the station...
"Paypal up 15% and ebay down 10% since that ""dreaded"" split. I can only guess but I imagine a high percentage of buyers still use paypal there. Ebay running that giant sale last week brought in millions in revenue and potentially many future buyers there. They won't be making a profit on that but paypal still gets their commission. Email I just got from paypal is pointing out that they are removing seller protection on transactions where a customer pays without using paypal. If the customer uses a credit card/guest checkout sellers aren't protected. Essentially, require a paypal account on all your listings or set yourself up to be screwed. Ebay's paypal replacement is years away. Seems like ebay shot themselves in the foot here and paypal asserted it's leverage."
Let’s crush it
I also don’t believe crypto’s have any big affect on pypl. It’s not a big part of their business and they don’t hold any of it. They make money in the middle.
ARK started selling PYPL. the bottom is near.
Been holding V and MA for a few months and keeping an eye on this one. Watched an interview with CEO this morning and finally hopped in today just under $200. Liking this one for a long time :)
oh my it actually wants to go green finally
NOW we have reached the BUY level. Time to load up before new coverages ate initiated. I am all in as of this morning. I see a huge after-market purchase yesterday that filled several gaps. Be ready for a quick recapitulation back towards $290’s in todays trading - 63% probability.
PYPL to report a pre tax gain of $38 million or $29 million after tax on strategic investment in Q4. On Fidelity Investment site
Slow and steady always wins the race. The ones that run too fast just crumble in the end !
things aren't looking good … the Nasdaq basically rebounding to levels at opening yesterday and this stock is up only $.24 cents... super frustrating I think people are pessimistic towards earnings today
"PYPL, is a Great long term stock; about $450 as perDalton Whitney."
PYPL is oversold will rebound tomorrow . Always runs up before earnings Oct. 18th
"https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/covid-19-vaccine-does-not-threaten-paypal-2020-11-13?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=yVaccine or no vaccine, PayPal is going to be used worldwide now & future. - Great earnings report, - New services (crypto trading plus bill sharing) just added, - Owns Venmo mobile payment (adds to their earnings) . Load up when it is still low. Read the news and make up your own deductions."
"Tax cut is just like Salsa or dips, PYPL itself has 35-40 % earning growth rate in the next 3-4 quarters. Top line is also high. I don't think it will tank again. Big boys just rob your share when you should stay still. If PYPL can close under 3 points today, I think by next week ADBE will crank the market for tech. Don't forget Dec 14, ADBE will surge around 6-9% because the top line beats estimate and earnings growth around 45% should be enough for the stock to surge higher. PE is around 45 this year and 25 next year. PYPL has the potential like ADBE and has the parabola chart."
Who sells here? Crazy to unload right now.
Keep riding the crypto wave
I bought September 360 calls last week after buying June 300 calls in December. Thanks longs!
Sack = sweaty getting excited for tomorrow
Huge buying opportunity!!!
down trending now...
Anyone else a little surprised PYPL not up/green on this cyber Monday???
"smart move of management, probably buying back as much as they can, would do the same, Thank me later guys, in 4 years you are going to see a documentary about this company on netflix"
"Buy shares and call options for Fin-Tech stocks! The excellent earning and revenue growth reports for PayPal, Square, and Shopfy are coming. The guidance will be raised."
pypl buys browser extension for $4b. please tell me this is a joke.
"hit the buy point 82.27, per ibd, cup with handlle base"
I suggest to buy more before Investors day on Thursday.
In hard at $71.64. Will ride this stock higher long term.
If PYPL is doing digital payments it's going to double next year.
More great news! Partnership with Acorns Grow to offer Robo Investing. PYPL to 80
Strong close to an amazing year for the stock. Thanks PayPal.
People selling banks and coming to pypl the fintech
Pypl could build strong investor support initiating dividend.They have the cash.
PYPL looks like it is ready to run toward new highs to finish the year. great support at these levels. gl!
It seems like I use PayPal more and more these days. I paid for airline tix yesterday with it. Nice to see popping up as all over.
ok - got in now... Lets gooo UP UP UP

What happened after hour?
"Strong buy, I bought in at $176 as confidence in this"
$TSNP check them out! The potential is astronomical! They recently merged with HUMBL; it’s the next $PYPL in the making
"Still quadruple down short from 177 and not even coming close to covering one share after reading 1000 posts in here “going to $300.” Reminds me of 2000 and 2008, and we all know what happened then!"
Anyone else here since 80$/share? Keep on going PayPal :)
Most sellers sold pre-earnings. Shorts neednt expect to be bailed out tomorrow.
"Ebay news is a huge gift to paypal longs! take advantage and keep buying at discounted price. Paypal has a simple concept, no debts, and the younger generation loves using venmo = easy money!"
I see a lot of articles about PayPal about to pullback after such a big run. Stocks with fast growth and great guidance don’t pullback with rates at ZERO. It’s just the way it is. Very few companies are giving guidance right now and PayPal is one of those companies and it was RAISED GUIDANCE. What that means is that PayPal hasn’t adjusted its share price enough yet for this increased guidance. Enjoy the ride! Hot as fire

I did it!!
"I am hoping that I get an opportunity to buy more PYPL near 100 now.I was planning to add at 115, but didn't, so that's good..."
It is gift!!
85 - 90 soon.
Just bought some crypto on PayPal to see how it worked. It's easy and PayPal is going to make some bank as a place to buy and sell crypto. It should be a big money maker.
rich people buy in dip. poor people sell on dip
PYPL will be extremely bullish until the end of 2019!!!
Congrats! This will help visa tomorrow.
Not near a PC is it still +$13 $260???
If the price goes down after earnings buying more shares
"Traditional valuation metrics are not what you use to determine fair price of SQ and PYPL. For growth stocks such as these, I look at top and bottom line growth year over year as well as over the past several years. In addition, I look to compound annual growth rate, gross profit growth, gross margins, etc. So let's dive into PYPL's growth metrics shall we? If you look at PYPL's revenue over the last several years, it has been increasing by roughly $2-$4 billion dollars a year, from $11 billion in 2015 to $21.5 billion in 2021. So revenues have doubled over the last 6 years. Gross profit has also grown substantially year over year. From 2015-2021, gross profit doubled as well. EBITDA grew explosively as well, from $2 billion in 2015 to $5 billion this year. Cash and cash equivalents have grown at an astounding rate too over that time period, increasing every year. Free cash flow also increased 2.5 times from 2015 to this year, more astounding growth. And over the next 5 years it is expected to do that again. Earnings growth rate over the next 5 years is an impressive 22 percent. Market implied 5 year EPS compound annual growth rate is an impressive 27 percent. So overall, when it comes to the important metrics, PYPL checks all the boxes for me."
"Paypal taking on debt at rates less than most peoples mortgage rates. You have to be a quality company to command such a low premium.Metrobank has bonds at 9% interest for example!Uber and merco will be profitable in the longer term but short term they still make paypal money being their payment provider.Forget the silver. No recession in the US, unemployment lower than forecast as per today's report.Too bad for Big and his papas retirement account though "
"PayPal has performed in the fashion l wrote 9 hours ago and is trending northward in after hours as well, as all the Investor Day information is gradually being digested by the market. This is a stellar performance among all the other companies that have already reported for the quarter, not to mention today was outstanding especially being a Friday"
"After paypal analyst day the other week, where they laid out 750 million active accounts by 2025, double what it has now, and more than doubling revenue...Here is where analyst stand:PayPal price target $375 at MizuhoPayPal price target raised to $350 from $310 at CitiPayPal price target raised to $340 from $290 at Keefe BruyettePayPal price target raised to $333 from $296 at Raymond JamesPayPal price target raised to $330 from $300 at SusquehannaPayPal price target raised to $329 from $302 at Morgan StanleyPayPal price target raised to $321 from $291 at Loop CapitalPayPal price target raised to $315 from $306 at CanaccordPayPal price target raised to $310 from $249 at JPMorganPayPal price target raised to $310 from $300 at KeyBanc"
PYPL is really something. Options into September here. Let’s go to $250 soon!
PYPL is ready to make new 52 week high.
This is a buyable dip. Earnings and outlook should be outstanding.
"its on sale time to buy, will bounce back to $200+ by year end"
"I told everyone in here what to do last night when PYPL was +$13. Sell $260+ short $260 plus and buy weekly 250 put options at the exact open $256 this morning. Would have made $100,000+ easily like I did"
It's going to double digits. Free money days r over now.
I'm a long term holder for 2 years and I sold everything over the last few weeks. great company but no innovation and too much competition.
"If PYPL cannot move up, no stock can move up market."
PayPal due for a 10% move a la Square. We have all been patient with this one.
Paypal is becoming one of my best friends.
SQ crypto bet paid off bug time. Pypl played it safe but are on track to also benefit greatly from this new venture.
buy and hold it will be higher tomorrow 
ppl wil realize in the end. its a gift that this price
can't wait till Market close to see these numbers that I think should be off the chart if you short this stock you should get pounded into the ground
PYPL could jump big anytime. It has such a good earning. There is nothing to be worry about. Its evaluations by annalists are good as well.
"Starting to feel like groundhogs day, tickles $80-81, ends at $79/$78.. sigh"
"PayPal under $76 is a gift, well over $80 in few weeks again."
"Once more a case of market maker manipulation ahead of earnings. Of course they want panic this is the way American Banks make their trading money. Nothing changed to warranty a 4% sell off, no news no changes. It is the same stock it was last week and a month ago. It is expanding and it is not effected by Trumps draconian tariffs. So the only thing that changed is selling pressure is mounting."
Steady as a rock on 34 million shares ~ 4x AV.
"I posted four times already since I got back in PYPL at $84I first got in at $70. I made HUGE mistake of selling in December when all stocks dropped 5-10%. I got back in and dropped again. THIS TIME I am staying long.PYPL easy money. Stay long you WILL be happy. Next small drop, I will be doubling down."
Everyone report Putin's comments as spam and he might get blocked
Going to $300
SQ is going to hit 100 for the second time before PayPal hits it for the first time.
seems like a no brainer play to get in here
"Great opportunity to buy since we are closing to the earning date, i bet we wont have this price in the future."

WHEN BIG HEDGE FUNDS TRYING TO REVERSE THE COURSE....NO ONES CAN RESIST THAT....UP MORE AND MORE AS THEY 'RE LOADING ....NOW...
Almost 1 million shares bought in the last 5 minutes of trading  AVGO (Broadcom) had similar action... what happened?
One word.. VENMO. First to market and Bitcoin wishes it could be used as easy as venmo.
Just give it 2 days. Back at 85
PYPL+SQ should run higher tiday btwn 3:30 - 4PM Market clise... why (?);because at 3PM EST; Dan Dolev (Mizuno) & Cathie Wood (ARK) interview... sharing their 5-10 year strategy to participate in global disruptive Innovation
"RIGGED market. Best earnings ever and stock is down, just think about that."
"PayPal P/E was 105 before earnings... Now it is 76...Anytime a high P/E Growth Stock lowers their P/E by that much post earnings, it can support that 90+ P/E again soon."
This stock loves making new all time highs. Slow steady climb up. No wild swings. The kind of stock you look at December 31st and see that you’re up 35-50% for the year. These are the stocks that hold up well during a selloff. Thx high fliers are the ones that get crushed.
Buy the deep before market closeTomorrow the stock will go up
"I have no doubt in PayPal. I’m looking for an entry point. Right now the market is hot as fire and my only hesitation with buying shares of this is the current PE which is probably a little high despite their growth. However, I know this is going to push 200 and pass 200 very soon"
Looking strong!
Just another day testing ath!!
This is huge buying opportunity!!! It is a good quality stock!
Extremely encouraging Motley Fool article on PYPL.“...analysts predict annual revenue growth of 23% over the next five years.”https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c6eac7d8-c44f-3e8b-8b97-467d770b63ef/should-you-start-your-war-on.html?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo
"Again, no one is selling PayPal here. Everyone is expecting it to surpass $100 soon. Stay long."
"A good quality stock! If you are not jumping today, you can still buy it tomorrow. It is looking to break out"
Now it is time to buy. It will be the best time to dip into the red sea of PYPL. I buy Feb18 call 72.5
"Alright....that was not bad....could have been better....just need have support at $260 area now. I am predicting a Nasdaq rebound....institutional day traders like softbank, Saudi Sovereign funds etc are day trading and chasing banks, industrial and energy which should end soon as these stocks have risen 20-30% in the last 3/4 weeks. The disconnect between Dow and Nasdaq will not last and Nasdaq is ready to catch up....soon. So stay strong folks!"
our run to 200 by the end of the year begins today! good luck to everyone!
haha where is that Kevin guy?
"Would anyone else agree that all the cautionary guidance should be behind us going in this next ER? Any news now should only serve to catalyze this stock moving forward, i.e. acquisitions, market expansion, Venmo monetization etc?"
Up 200% in the last year is a buying opportunity... LOL yall are professionals.
Come on hit all time high already. What a great stock.
$100. Yea thir! Now hold it PayPal!
new highs again today.
huge drop around this time?
"he 39 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for PayPal Holdings Inc have a median target of 127.00, with a high estimate of 150.00 and a low estimate of 95.00. The median estimate represents a +30.40% increase from the last price of 97.39."
Got in at 194. 3000 shares
"Paypal may look expensive now but I think in the future it will justify its price. Why? Increasing margins, shares repurchase and increasing revenue. This will lower its earnings per share and thus its PE."
"Like l replied to HAN a day ago, the Long and Strong shall prevail : all the more strength to Paypal : the Fintech World Leader !"
Way overblown. PayPal is way to go for every one in future. Have used PayPal and will continue to use PayPal. eBay has lost their mind it’s their loss and we don’t need eBay.
"I am numb from my tech losses past 2 days and it took a lot of restraint not to press the sell button but maybe things are getting oversold so I bought more shares of PYPL, SQ, NVDA, CRM, SE, AMZN, DOCU & MSFT."
"Thursday and Friday will be telling for PayPal,,,should pop above $$$$110...."
"Previous agreement with E bay PRECLUDED them with working with other ""large potential partners"" like>>AMAZON<<"

Done shopping on Ebay if cannot use Paypal. Certainly not willing to give my personal payment information to a foreign entity.
I wonder if 2020 will be the year they decide to offer a dividend?
"Would be nice to open tomorrow at where we were last week, but hey, good news it is, and I'll take it. My September 270 calls lookin' good."
"Looking forward to listening to CEO Schulman and CFO Rainey on Mad Money today, especially PYPL's entry into the crypto business."
With Dan Schulman at the reigns this thing keeps going up and up.
"go to sleep, wake up and paypal over 78. didn't think we would be testing 80 before December. this is amazing, starting to move like sq has been."
"The people who sell today will be the new bears in the coming days talking about what a ""scam"" $ZM is.

"Cannot believe how PYPL is selling off. This stock will thrive in any scenario other than a market crash. Due to Moderna and Pfizer, people will now, suddenly stop using PYPL? No, they will continue to use PYPL for decades to come. Do not be fooled into a sell-off that does not seem logical."
Jim Cramer said he bought PYPL aggressively this week. So did I.
Company insiders are selling stock during buyback programs and making additional profits when stock prices jump.google that. top brass is selling pypl above 100 for sure
should close above 113. watch the inevitable ramp to close.
"There is nothing but good news coming out of PayPal indicating that this dip is purely speculative. They just launched a product in France, filed to enter into the Crypto markets, and are the most well established payment solution on the market. Buy the dip sell the news."

"I own V, PYPL and SQ. Three phenomenal companies. Just my opinion, but if V or PYPL ever thought about buying SQ, now might be the time to do it. But I'm thrilled if all the companies remain independent. Good luck to all longs!"

Not selling anything until at least 146 today MARK IT
I am begging  and pleading  with everyone in here to sell here @ $285.50 short & buy puts. You own a stock that fell from $302 to $281 in a minute on great news ! WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BAD NEWS STRIKES?
"paypal has a international presence and is better valued than square, which doesnt have such a foothold and is too overvalued compared to its growth. paypal is priced better for safety, always keeps a margin of safety."
PayPal reached an all time high at 285.55
"People consider paypal an online service and benefitted from the pandemic. Several analysts believe this will continue on post-pandemic. Prepandemic PayPal was always growing 30-50% per year in stock price and 20-30% in earnings. The pandemic caused a 100% increase in both when compared to its prepandemic high. People are thinking it'll be a stagnant 2021 for PayPal because of this parabolic uptick. Of course it's only temporary as more and more opt in for cashless transactions. There are some who don't believe in covid, but overall it's businesses that are opting in for cashless and online transactions. Those who don't will probably get buried under. Also travel and all forms of booking is commonly performed on a computer. No one carries $2000 in cash to an agency to book travel plans. Some people just don't understand this and how it will translate to an increase in PayPal's earnings. PayPal is also expanding to other markets like Asia and Bitcoin transactions for other sources of revenue."
Scooped up 200 more shares on the cheap at 192.50. In 10yrs this will be a $1T+ company 
Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Willi has upgraded PayPal from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $80 to $95.
Easy earnings beat BUT the only thing that matters is GUIDANCE!
looking to go down to 230$s
"Pypl go big or go home. Cheers PayPal will allow its customers to buy, sell and hold several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, directly within their existing digital wallets."
PayPal Traders Bet Stock Will Jump 7% in One Monthhttps://www.investopedia.com/news/paypal-traders-bet-stock-will-jump-7-one-month/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo
Maybe people are moving out of SQ and back into PYPL??
Does this mean square is priced in?
Earnings smashed estimatesSignificantly upgraded guidance for year
"high beta stocks are almost always overpriced and seen as lottery ticket stocks, this causes low beta stocks like paypal to be ignored more and gives it a better valuation. plus retail chase high beta stocks.( plus some institutes, trying to beat the benchmark)it is harder to recover from a eg. 40% drop high beta, than a 10% drop low beta."
"This company is doing great don't worry about this small ups and downs. Don't go for easy money, you have to wait to see good result."
Train keeps a rolling all night long........
Bull day tomorrow
PayPal authorized a $10 billion dollar stock repurchase program during the last earnings release. That’s in addition to the over $2 billion dollars remaining from the previous plan. Why sell at these levels? Has the story changed?
CNBC’s Jon Najarian today: Aggressive buying of $105 PYPL Nov 29th calls
"Bottom in, early stages of rising trend, 278.36 held is key. I say climbs into next earnings"
Oh boy
Owning online ebay businesses in Oz meant no bank would touch us for a serious loan. 4 years in and PayPal offered us twice the value of our business for purchasing inventory. No questions asked. The money in our account within 60min. This is truly a great company. One that knows it’s customer better than anyone else. Long all the way
thank you paypal! love you!
Feels like PYPL chart is rolling over. Risky buying here IMO. Better buy around it's 52 week lows and below.
Let’s see some green . Come on mr Franklin . $100
Latest election shows Kev is to be treasury secretary of nambia
Big short squeeze today. Long and strong PYPL.
"PayPal bought Israeli fintech firm Curv, buy more"
"Here's to a better week, to go from $309 to $266.... Let the climb back begin. Love PYPL, been a great year owning it."
PayPal will become a trillion dollar company. It’s not a matter of if but when.
wow...something is up
Very disappointing stock...been in at 80
Ebay consists of 10-13% of PYPL revenue. They have a contract through 2020. All EBAY did was add an extra payment option. Complete over reaction. BUY DURING FEAR. Pypl smashed earnings and has been preparing for life without EBAY for years now.
Red tag sale! Grab some shopping carts and fill them up!
Mark my wordThis stock will gain +100% every year for the next 2-3 years and then after post-Covid 19 will be up +50% per year every year for the next 10-20 years

POP!
First close over $86.00
PYPL going much higher
https://www.researchsnipers.com/paypal-launch-in-pakistan-expected-by-february-2019/
got in at 64 and never looked back
Does anyone know why PYPL is down??
"OK OK, so it's going to get to $100 even quicker than I have been predicting."
PYPL higher than Visa.
going up is the only option. heaven forbid a lower close tomorrow.
Top and bottom beat. Venmo double the volume YOY extends EBay agreement. Terrific numbers.
Wow
"PayPal Holdings Inc joined the cryptocurrency market on Wednesday, allowing customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other virtual coins using the U.S. digital payments company's online wallets.PayPal customers will also be able to use cryptocurrencies to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network starting in early 2021, the company said in a statement.My thoughts: crypto adoption has been slow moving but this just gave it 26 million more reasons why to use it. PayPal is going to crush it over the next serval years. Can’t wait to see what Venmo turns into. Great stuff here folks."
"Big, come back??? "
"if paypal announce a new stock buyback program tomorrow, $80 will be a history"
The next time one of those analysis posts here remember that's you short term sell signal.It happens all the time.
Up we go PYPL! Slowly and Steady gains.
"Square is overvalued, and weak margins. PayPal has Venmo, better than cash app, and much stronger balance sheet."
Great setup for explosive earnings. $95.00 at minimum. Guidance will be the best with new acquisitions.
Almost 3 percent up now... Definitely gonna tank 10 percent after the release
I wrote the same thing on SQ’s forum.. Check out BFT/ Paysafe.. I own all three but BFT doesn’t have the expensive valuations of SQ and PayPal. Ground floor that I got into two weeks ago.. Glta
Breakout
I need money to buy more shares of PayPal.
expect at least 85 soon
Congrats guys. More of the same from Visa tomorrow. These stocks have been manipulated down recently. Paypal and Visa are very profitable.
"Get ready for another amazing earning report. We should be well on the road to over $280 by end of next week. PayPAL will soon be the next crypto purse for all levels of investors and exchange platform of choice, yet that is only secondary to its sky rocketing acceptance."
"UH-O, here comes the “PALcoin” venture in to crypto..."
"Anyone else think this AmazonPay story is nonsnese at best and at worst a plant story to short attack V, MA, SQ, and PYPL? This has about 1% impact on PYPL if even that. Only the smallest of retailers will be held hostage to AMZN. What retailer WANTS to give their sales merchandise and price data to AMZN? :-/"
"PayPal always posts bad earnings and the market always forgives them. Wonder  how much longer that scenario will last, especially down 20% this past month?"
At least a USD 300 stock
"paypal dropped from 91 to 82, but avg price target raised from 90 to 95.67, will be buying more today, long term growth still intact"
Just another shakeout where impatience costs weak hands dearly.
this is getting too cheap...
Will PYPL price be higher or lower than 260 in a weeks time?
"Dumping $28,000 into PayPal before earnings. Can’t wait to see the massive earnings."
"i like what third point said, paypal is the next amazon"
If your making money off Paypal and Square give me a thumbs up
"AUDC HERE WE GO, IT'S JUST STARTING! OFF GOOGLE CONTRACT 4 YOUTUBE CODECS, PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY DO, WHEN THEY FIND OUT KABOOM, SEP 45'S WAY TO PLAY IT, 90'S MAYBE 120'S BY THEN."
Why are we down so much? Is PYPL being considering a Corona Stock now?
wake me at 125.
Paypal will always be a payment option for Ebay ... do you all know what Paypal is .. really?? https://www.adyen.com/payment-methods/paypal
Another acquisition! New 52 week highs coming tomorrow!
Why I think Paypal will surge rapidly this year:1. Revenue from crypto: Square made 1.63 billion from Bitcoin during Q3. I expect Paypal making atleast 2 billion from crypto every quarter as in Paypal you can also trade 3 more cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin. This is only revenue from investing there will be also revenue from buying things with crypto.2. Purchasing power will increase spending stimulus and reopening of the economy.3. If Square can add stocks trading in Cashapp I believe Paypal also will.4. PayPal will be expanding crypto services to other countries. Where the UK will be the first.
thumbs up if you are LONG
"Awesome ,soon $300 plus.it's been there,before here it goes again."
"Just want to point something out. Since posting earnings, PayPals PE has DROPPED. If you were buying PayPal the last few months then you were paying a HIGHER MULTIPLE for it! Keep in mind that PayPal also RAISED GUIDANCE! Given all this I expect the PE to rise back into the low 100s!"
Look at the NASDAQ pulling the entire tech sector up!
$300 around the corner and $400 is not out of reach by years end. #crypto
"Amazon beat earnings, and up only less than 1%....do the math, Pypl will follow same path...up maybe 1%...buy on pullback profit taking tomorrow.."
"I have a couple dumb questions about buybacks. If they are buying back $10B in pypl stock. That's ~10% of the market cap. So wouldn't that automatically increase the earnings per share by 10%?Plus, when they buy them back, won't the increased demand force the price up considerably as well? Just seems like such huge buybacks would significantly raise the intrinsic, and market value of the stock unless I'm misunderstanding something. Seems like you'd want to hold just for that?"
Paypal just lost money on Strategic Investments may tank tomorrow.
One step forward... two steps back. Come join me in the Cryptocurrency market. The stock market is a waste of time anymore with Wall Street stepping up the manipulation to make back the billions they lost from new retail investors.
PayPal is attractive at this level. buy more shares while you can!!!
"Where's Kevin? Will you still call it 'paypuke' when it gets back up to the highs?Maybe you got smart and closed out your short position or puts and initiated some calls/longs.If so, I commend your timing and ability to make a profit both ways. If not, you have some rough days ahead and nobody on here will feel sorry for you."
One of my best purchases. Love this stock.
Anyone heard from (down) big today? Just want to make sure he's okay.
"EPS was $1.08, compared to $1.00 estimates. Good beat, but the market will want more than a 10% beat unfortunately."
$80 by Friday.
Wish I had had the extra cash to put into PayPal when it dropped down to the 80s. Some more high volatile days to come though so will start stacking that investment money again and wait for the next opportunity
"Mizuho Securities analyst Don Dolev has forecast that Paypal will earn up to $2 billion in revenue from its bitcoin business by 2023. This year, he expects that the payment giant’s overall revenue will climb 20%."
I subscribe to MF and they just emailed me DG’s 5 best stocks to buy right now and PayPal one of the 5. :))
"Just as the market rotates away, it will rotate back. If you pull out for a loss now then you’re going to kick yourself down the line. Patience the key to this game $PLUG $PYPL $NIO $NNDM $CBAK"
Looks like a triple top has formed for PYPL. Probably best to sell and let it sell off then buy back two weeks before earnings and catch the run up.
"I’ll buy into PYPL again the next dip. Meanwhile, happy to see it continue to do well. I sold my long position at 87 and moved it to FDC and cannabis."
"Buying opportunity, guys!!!"
All I have to say is when pay pal pops the sky's the limit I'm a strong believer and pay pal been dealing with for years One day you'll wake up and you'll be rich God-bless pay pal in the unions
What a stock!!
"am worried today was a good day for stocks i own 10 and tlry only one down as of now have lost 35,000 dollars"
"looks like another buying chance at 250, like i said before."
"In at various price points in late Feb with avg cost basis of 262. In hindsight, could have waited just a bit longer and gotten in at 230. Either way, still feel very comfortable with where this stock is going. GL all!"
Huge beat and raisehttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-tops-earnings-expectations-as-covid-19-drives-big-e-commerce-growth-2020-07-29?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
New all time high! Up we go!
I would interpret Amazon Pay's discount offer as a desperate move since they just cannot convince the retailers into using their system. Just too risky. It is like a Troy Trojan from Amazon.
Is ebay dropping PayPal?
"I own all the fintech plays: Apple,visa, MasterCard, Square and PayPal. Payments is next frontier of tech innovation."
Up to $84 AH and climbing!

gonna hit 86 today
bargain price $196 ￼ ￼ 
Up on a down day with strong volume. Very Bullish
Nice pullback from opening. Time to fly
I will add and hold. PYPL will crush earnings and revise guidance upward in early May.Didn’t anyone pick up on $FDX earnings and more importantly raised guidance.They go hand and hand and both are winners with continuing strength and huge growth.
BACK UP TO ABOVE $200 AGAIN BY TOMORROW...AND BEYOND THIS WEEK...JUST LOADED more cheap shares...
"like I said shorts, I'm your daddy. shorts and short posters are sheep. You push the price up for us smart longs on fear."
"Ok hint for my former NIOphite friends. $PYPL has had a healthy, more than healthy correction. It is oversold, but showing strength at it’s 200 dayMA.A good pick up here, coming of a banner quarter with double digit growth projected, quarter over quarter as far as the eye can see. It is on sale. Almost 30% off their all time high.They earn money like crazy, and buy back their own shares."
Saw news about a mixed shelf offering they just filed. Doesn’t that dilute existing shares?
$sq will print $150 before $pypl just like I said sq will print $100 before pypl. Square open for business in the am

running to 85 by Friday Dooooo it! dooooooo it!
I missed it completely..
Too much of a reaction to the virus. You will be rewarded if you buy. That is just a simple fact.
I can't believe I sold this position so early. I had 10 July 260 calls a couple months ago but now I only have 2 left.
PYPL has been good to me. Looking forward to ER tonight.
"Wait till these kids get their free checks and 10K relief on college fund, all buying crypto using Paypal CHA CHING"

"Currently if paypal was booted from ebay today it's a 14%hit according to last earnings. that continues to shrink and shrink each quatre.Paypal is still going to be a dominant payment method on ebay perhaps until ayden is better recognised or until 2020. That in itself is more than enough time for paypal to look at newly available options which it is already doing and yet still pulling in revenue until 2023 from ebay regardless. Buy Paypal, sit back and enjoy earnings beat after new partnerships after earnings beat.Don't be a donut."
Seller all down. Now shorts will bring us the Money.
If you people think ads will be significantly impacted due to the virus the same argument should be made for 5G stocks but we are not seeing that. The economy is fine because the shutdown was a control event and you people shorting the market thinking you are a genius should and deserves to lose all your money. $goog $fb $msft $isrg $t $pypl
The story of these big techs and fintechs: Crush earnings. Rise 5-10% after hours. Start tomorrow up about 5% at the bell. See a general selloff until the stock finishes the day up 23 cents. I love PYPL but this is probably how it will go.
Is $SQ eating PYPL lunch?
I hope this won’t be the same as the FAANG stocks slip
Could be worse. Could be SQ.
"Paul Barnard, has set a target price of $350 pershare for PYPL."
They guided revenue lower for Sept. qtr. THAT IS WHY IT IS DOWN!
PayPal reached an all time high at 201.40
Maybe smash that 200 today !
Stock buy Back over next 2 years for a Total of 6 Billion $ .....Barron's reported.....
"Earnings release expected in just 5 weeks. Results will drive next leg. If market remains steady, or improving, and if PYPL provides another beat with positive guidance, i would expect the stock to make new highs and march north to test the 100 mark. IMHO"
This is a good company with very good earning. It is a buying opportunity!!!
Need my July $300 calls to print. With BTC at 60 k already... me thinks it will happen!
"You cannot even use PayPal on Amazon. How does this news effect PayPal other than institutions buying PayPal at a discount. This market is truly rigged, and people sell for no reason. Nothing changed since their last earnings which were up 33%"
"I really think PayPal is a better company than SQ, pypl is at scale, pulling more than 5billion + rev, with massive profits and SQ only has 500million with losses, too much hype and overpriced compare to pypl, should be 300 billion by now"
"CNBC ""FAST MONEY"" DAN NATHAN ""FINAL TRADE"": BUY PYPL , ITS READY TO BREAK OUT!"
"MF article is a must read. As the cliche’ goes, “ Steady Eddie always wins the race.”‘PayPal is expecting revenue to increase 20% to 25% in the fourth quarter and TPV and earnings per share to grow double-digits. These are strong numbers, but they don't match growth from newer start-ups like Square. But PayPal's revenue far exceeds Square's, and sales growth around 20% is healthy for a company its size. That typically means less vigorous stock growth, but lower risk. This explains why Square is up more than 200% year to date and PayPal is up about 100%, which isn't too shabby. But Square trades at 330 times trailing 12- month earnings, while PayPal trades at 81 times earnings. PayPal has an established brand and high long-term growth prospects. It faces some competition, but it stands out with its large network and innovative payment solutions. I would say that PayPal is a low-risk stock with the potential for high gains for shareholders.’"
Finally breakout
"market down big many stocks down over 4%, paypal down 1%. enough said"
Visa and PYPL go hand in hand down the aisle tomorrow. Two good holdings for me and should see very strong numbers with the strength of Fintech and more importantly the perception of Fintech stocks among the Funds. We fly high.
It performed amazingly without travelOr crypto upside
All time high amigos! Awesome :))
Love Cathie Woods. She added another 21430 shares of PYPL today to her ARKW ETF
about time
more then double my money
"Ok, I have a question...if one Bitcoin is worth, ~$56,000, and I own one, how do I sendmy brother the $20 bucks I owe him? How does that work? Anyone??"
Anyone else losing patience with this stock?
Friend of mine just told me PayPal just partnered with Chevron so customers can pay for gas with PayPal at the pumps
"Typical, just like last quarter. Bet eps estimates by 10 CENTS! Unheard of even with MercadoLibre effect. Revenues in line with estimates but seeing slower growth (still up 17%). So what do the MM and hedge funds do? Sell off at 2.50% drop. I have been right so far with all but one of my predictions and this one is no different. Slow growth to $110-$112 by anniversary date of IPO in July..... unless management realizes a special dividend."
Anyone actually looked at the earnings expectations?The bar set very low.Not exactly difficult to beat and with Venmo and delay of income from last report projected in the next quarters you have higher expectations next year which translates into some very big positive catalysts.
"For those interested in statistics : from PayPal’s IPO ( mid 2015 ) till March 2019 it was sub $100 per share : 45 months. Then spent 20 months sub $200. Now has only taken 3 months to touch $300. There is no reason why that trend shouldn’t continue with the roll out of more services and features, plus blow out numbers of new clients and crypto adoption"
"Bought in today, should have pulled the trigger on SQ today also, that stock is smoking hot recently."
"William, I know how you and I both like to compare PYPL and SQ. Let us know the return on the two names over the past week, month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year and all time returns? I’ve made more in sq in the past year than PYPL has returned in its entire public life. And you wanna get on sq board and say pypl had a better day, you make me laugh."
Paypal and Venmo not going anywhere. This stock is just getting started.
"Paypal does not hold any Crypto.....its customers buy and sell and It just charges a fee. WTH the articles speculating the % drop related to Bitcoin? If BTC prices go lower, i believe it would be good for Paypal because more customers will be putting their money in Bitcoin and others.Last few days move is more related to, to my opinion, the $50 gap up post earning and the market naratives for sell off in high growth stocks although i believe there are other absurdly valued stocks compared to Paypal. Institutions are creating panic mongering by their muscle power and eliminating all weak hands....thats it."
$PYPL BMO raised target!www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/bmo-capital-markets-raised-paypalpyplnsd-to-256-from-241/

This thing needs an energy drink or something.
"Buy buy buy! Stay at home play, second wave here and they will blow away earnings because of how much e-commerce sales."
245$+Simple
But PayPal barely beats estimate and provides inline forecast. What happen to stock price? It's hard to predict and definitely not on fundamental. Although it's much better than Tesla fundamentally.
Looks like PayPal is pretty much following nasdaq's trend since March 2020. It's YTD trend almost matches the Nasdaq's performance to the T. I'm confident Nasdaq index will continue to double and triple in the next 3-5 years and so will PayPal and other fintechs
I bought in at $126 in the spring. I just bought more at $186.I only see upside right now when I look through my lenses that see past the Covid election.
Will Paypal ever be relevant in electronic payments?
"Jan 26, call 85 premium is 16-20 cents expires today, tells me something that PYPL will hit 85 today."

Yeah Bitcoin price has fallen. But how many commission has Paypal made from these.....?
"Big, that was me adding again at market open BTW."
I would love this dip if I didn’t already have a large position at $180. Might DCA with margin if it keeps dropping. This is ridiculously cheap. Could be a trillion dollar company in the future
Just reached 100 billion market cap again.
"Lol, What happened to $177 Kevin"
"look at the chart, this is a gold mine in a few years, just stay in, honey is a cash giant"
"I’m in $SQ, but I watch $PYPL religiously; there’s room for both of these great companies! ￼"
New high.
$200 After Earnings? What are your thoughts?
All time high and really just getting started. Once you are over $100 you are in a different class. Investors have more respect for you. Onwards and upwards amigos. :))
$200 end of year?
it's time for paypal to buy first data / clover
look at 6x PayPal open end long for the consolidation chart
Walmart move with PYPL - WOW! Watch out Amazon
Great news out that square got downgraded because of lack of growth. This should even boost stock price in my opinion for paypal because its likely paypal will eventually acquire it which would just bolster paypals potential in the market.
HMBL on CNBC at 1 pm central standard time today. This is why PayPal and SQ are down. HMBL going world wide. This will be a monster. Bye Bye PayPal
So I bought back into Paypal yesterday. Hopefully 77.77 was a lucky purchase price.
Congrats Guys
"The good and bad on this stock: THE GOOD: I bought this winner for my sister at $35 a share a couple + years ago. THE BAD: I didn't buy myself any shares. Fully invested at the time. Keeping my sister in this WINNER.She has made a pile of money in it. Also, bought her SQ at the same time. Made a fortune on that one, too.Of course, I don't own that one either. But I'm very happy for her and guess what???? SHE'S VERY HAPPY!"
All time high fast approaching
"I would not be shocked if PYPL hit 100 by Thursday,"

Strong finish! Nice to see.
"On paypal allowing crypto transactions between customers and merchants - I don't have a clear understanding on paypal's tax accounting on such transactions.crypto is viewed as a asset - like a piece of property - subject to capital gains tax on sale .So say you buy a pair of shoes using crypto from paypal. Seems like @ end of year, paypal will report a gain/loss in converting your crypto to cash to make that purchase - triggering a tax event. Is this true? If so - that seems like it is a no starter to encourage transactions. I'd rather hold us cash to make everyday purchases instead of subjecting myself to people capital gains tax."
"Been buying PayPal since 2016 when it was in 30s. This year hit 300 for a bit. I will be here another 5 years too. Long and strong. Good company cares about employees, community and ensuring democratization of payment instruments to everyone who needs them."
PYPL will inherit all online transactions. It is one click and safe vs credit cards requiring data input. They have hardly penetrated brick and morter. Credit cards are just as easy in stores. Pypl will also become the gold standard of funds transfer which is a market as large as online retail. After the 2019 correction it is a reasonable price.
$249.xx will be the all time high forever in PYPL. Save this post! Forever!
"Risk on, go tech and financials has Fed will be breaking out new tools to squash interest rates. Parking myself fully in PYPL"
Love CNBC Had Money! They are spot on with stocks....Go PYPL! $ 95.00 Wednesday.
Nice to see PYPL finally moving North. I don't know how this hasn't broken out earlier in the past month or so. I love Pay Pal.
Invested our joint fund into Paypal yesterday...but still haven't told the wife yet.
buy zone is $92.45- $97.07 were going up after forming small consolidation after a handle … If earnings are good enough we can easily see $98+
Just wait until market opens
"Why do you people hate those that try to help.Look, I am in PYPL and getting my nuts kicked in today, but not like this, and I feel $PYPL will be fine as it has huge earnings and greater earnings potential. NIO, my former favorite stock, until they failed to act with all the cash they raised.I posted this yesterday with mixed reviews. Don’t hate the messenger. I know this stock better than most of you.Real_Stacey KronchReal_Stacey Kronch17 hours ago$NIO conversationI was probably the biggest bull on this NIO board and in my account from June 2020 until a couple of weeks after NIO day. I did not short this stock, because it is against my principles, but I knew it would tank. I liked the secondary offerings , which I thought they were going to deploy their war chest on expansion in every area. The factory issue is pathetic. The raised about $5Billion of our American dollars and seem content to sit on it. That turned me off, and when you combine legacy autos deploying cash for the EV sector, they have lost a great deal of momentum and trust. Now, I get the tech trades are suffering. I recently moved into $PYPL which has taken a whipping with the overall NASDAQ, but I am sorry, I will stay with PYPL and shun this. The cash in PYPL is real, the expansion is real and their massive revenues are equating to strong earnings. It may be rocky for a while, but $PYPL will bust out after this down cycle to new highs.NIO, once my favorite tech play has been very disappointing, and questionable what they are doing with cash.To my long term NIOites on this board, I issue this caution out of loyalty to you. Remember the November dilution. The locked up shares awarded to those that brought the secondary to market in November, free up late this month. Be careful as the float expands and more shares hit the market.Once again, very disappointed in NIO and am someone suspect on all these cash raises via dilution. Just wanted to remind those about the unlocked shares coming to market in a couple of weeks.I feel better in $PYPL and will have some exposure to China through their arrangements with Alipay.I hope it works out with NIO, but please proceed with caution. Good luck to all on my former board hangout.NIO owes me nothing, I did great with them.I hope to see some of you around, and NIO does deploy some of the cash they raised from the American equity market.LessNeutral"
Then it starts getting REAL!
"PAYPAL HAS JUST ANNOUNCED : it will introduce “Pay in 4” onto its Australian platform, to follow its success in the USA... to compete with Afterpay. Thus making it available to the 9 million PayPal users here in Australia ! This shall widen the user-base over here!"
Looks like the 99/100 level is the base being built.Earbings being the catalyst for the next gap-up.
Want to buy bitcoin where is the best place to do that is it PayPal?
It will be great if it holds $80 and forms a support line.
PayPal just approved BTC ... this is a big deal b/c PYPL is much larger than Square .... this means that VISA and MasterCard and American Express won't be far behind with respect to integrating Bitcoin as options to buy using accumulated rewards or to use as a payment option.
"WHY IS THIS DOWN. MAYBE BECAUSE BILL READY IS LEAVING? GOOD RIDDENCE. THEY WILL REPLACE HIM WITH SOMEONE BETTER. EVERYONE STATES HOW SMART HE WAS FOR FINDING VEMNO BUT THEY CAN FIND SOMEONE BETER WHO CAN MAKE VEMNO PROFIT.

"More and more positive articles has uploaded on Seeking alpha, which means buy buy Buy!"
110 today :)
"wow I deleted my paypal account yesterday and the stock fell by 3,64% didn't expect that. imagine more people delete their paypal accounts"
$100 before next earnings release
How come it missed the revenues and has withdrawn the guidance for 2020 and the stock is going up?I am puzzled
setting up nicely for the next week before heading to earnings
the beatdown over at SQ is very entertaining and deserved...HAHAHAHAHA
"Internet sales have been hot, PayPal might break above $80 this week."
Doesn't look good for after hours.... I'm thinking
So how many people have Bitcoin exposure and PayPal stock? That doubles the risk.
All my AMZN transactions are through PYPL. It isn't like they are one and not the other.
"Throwing out the baby with the bath water?I understand rising interest rates hurt growth stocks, that are starting out or expanding without the earnings that they will hope to earn on their nascent revenue which is growing. Since they need to borrow money to help fulfill that growth. Hence the sensitivity to any little tick up in interest rates.But companies like $PYPL and $AMZN for example can fund growth themselves as they huge earnings. Seriously look at the earnings of these behemoths and the projected earnings. These companies are cash cows. And $FDX FedEx earnings and more importantly guidance says it all about online commerce moving forward.These three companies and others in such an enviable position will outperform the market vastly.Ignore the background noise, look at the numbers, the verbal and written statements and projections made by these companies."
definitely need to hold until earnings report mid july
"Great opportunity to add more shares with this price. Get the dip before its too late, since its close to earnings date! :)"
Pypl shares 90 percent institutionally owned.. combined with 20 million shares short = double down
All I have to say is that the company better be buying back as much stock as possible at these prices. Investors will not be happy if the company is not buying back stock immediately. They have an authorized $10 billion.... USE IT NOW!
"Next week is the 3rd year anniversary of the IPO. Should be in the $88, maybe $89 range. Week after is earnings and that is when the stock may hit $92."
time for a new ATH?
Let’s see after earnings beat MasterCard drop Visa drop Apple drop Amazon drop Facebook drop yet PayPal which has been on a tear you expected what? Like I said Kevin the put buyer is the winner so far. I sold puts but I don’t think of it as a loss just buying some shares of a company I want to own. Send the shares here I’ll take them
You can gamble with Square that's way overbought or you can get PayPal at a steep discount. Buy now and enjoy the run to $100 by September.
PayPal did not get breached... read the actual article and not the headlines... TIO Networks data was compromised. PayPals platform is completely unaffected by this. Paypal suspended TIO weeks ago so they’ve been on top of this.
testing 78 ??

great way to start the week
"These bearish posts are essentially comical and ignorant. Guess these types of promotors said AMZN was a bubble when it went from 30 to 300; now at 1700 and climbing. Naysayers are jealous they missed out on big moves and can't believe companies (and their stocks) can continue climbing as they grow. The more they squad about the downside, the more we should be convinced the rally will continue. When they toss in the towel and buy these stocks, then it would be time to consider a top is forming. From the tenure of their comments, we have a lot more room to run on the upside. PYPL could easily be a 500 - 1000 stock several years down the road; not this year, not next year, but certainly in 2020-2022. Let's wait for PUTIN and his wannabees to capitulate and buy the stock; they will likely be buying mine several several hundred dollars higher than where it is today. IMHO"
When’s earnings? Cash out before then or wait it out?
If you scroll down to 3 days ago I wrote on here that the stock looks like it is about to break out big time. And I don’t use no stinking charts :))
Wow. Is this what is going to happen to Amazon tonight?
go on paypal!
"I love how guys are trolling other companies on PYPLs board. LOL as if... We see it over on TSLA too, trolls pumping prototype EV companies."
"Not a bad day all things considered. Good work team! I’m thinking of scooping at $75/$76 on the way upwards, thoughts?"
On our way to $90 amigos. Ain’t no stopping us now. Play time is Ovah.
This is heading back to $90
$pypl destroying earnings looks good for us in $bft boys!
"Of all the things, Reg T margin requirement comes into to force a close of my position, I had to, don't want my other shares to be liquidated.but I made my meagre profit.... 120 USD for a 12000 USD value position...

"This morning Rosenblatt Securities maintained it’s buy rating on PYPL and upped it’s price target from $320 to $350,Just keep holding for the long term."
And the grind to $100 starts again.
It’s ridiculous to blame one over the other. I own both Square and PayPal and love them both. Right now Square is the hotter stock. In 6 months maybe it’s PayPal. Both are in the right sector Fintech.
$78 today
This will probably be green by noontime

"I would be happy to pay for anything on line right now, PYPL long and strong."
"For the looks of it, most stocks are down today. I’m green for the day thanks to PayPal "
$SQ will print $150 before $PYPL. You heard it here first just like when I told you SQ would print $100 before PYPL
$90 coming
MACD indicator for paypal finally reversed to green today.
Red today because of eBay
"Anyone out there use Venmo? I use it about once a week. I’d like to hear a discussion on this. I don’t believe Zelle can compete as well because it’s run by the big fee banks who will screw it up. My folks like their credit and debit cards as do as most people. So, what do you think the future will be? Everyone will have a smart phone. When you look at the shared feed from Venmo, it’s 90 percent(or more) kids in their 20s. So will cards and cash be diminished or gone? Thoughts on mobile payments?"
A lot of crypto trading going on today.
“Decent” end to a week of unpredictable swings.. decent
good day to pick up more PYPL
Check out the daily and weekly charts for PYPL. It looks like we're in for a major run up and to the right.
Great company soon 220 stay long
still can't believe this was at 71 PPS a couple days ago! what a bargain!
Paypal also has a good development in China's online foreign payment business.
I bought some more shares as well.
Anyone see venmo new promotion with uber eats? Venmo and Honey will drive growth for years to come.
"Sometime ago we were discussing which team would reach $100 first - $PYPL or $SQ. I have both stock (SQ is the largest position in my portfolio), but I’m glad that PayPal is way ahead - it’s a very solid company and I see more and more online shops that use PYPL for payment. I hope, SQ will follow the example "
GO PYPL GO!!!
Zooming to 280 by tomorrow!!!!
Great business model. Huge customer base. New trading and investment products to be introduced within the next few months. For now we just need to deal with the macroeconomic conditions at play though. Pretty much everyone is in the same boat.
"Paypal no longer honors seller protection and states they are working on your behalf! They are only working on their own behalf. I have 3 orders now around $20 that were all delivered to confirmed addresses and ended up being chargebacks so charged an additiona $20 chargeback fee. Why because the sales happened 6 months previously and the tracking no longer works but stamps.com says ""delivered successfully"", furthermore if you can usps they could provide you with valid tracking on these orders!"
"On 235 to June, put on shorts))Up to 200 in November.The news is negative in terms of makrostatistiki. Pressure on incentive programs and more"
PYPL is showing why its a better buy than SQ right now. Solid earnings and earnings growth will trump potential earnings and potential earnings growth every time.
"Hey Big, how your short position going?"
"Strong quarter , long term here"
Rolled some appl into pypl. Pypl will recover quicker.
"not switching to ayden, ebay will bow"
"“Pay with Venmo, saw monthly active users increase by roughly 185 percent month over month from August to September.”"
I'm pretty sure it's better to open red on a day like this and let buyers come back. Hopefully finish green.One thing I don't understand.Square announce s they're upping there game into crypto and stock doubles in a day.Paypal sells off.
"EVERYTHING grew in price (Zoom, Stoneco, Wirecard,Nexi.....) last month, except PayPal.. its time"
Up 10% shall we?
Isn’t the CFO supposed to be buying back shares? Still down 4% yikes
$PYPL is looking admirable now
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3505796-american-express-paypal-introduce-split-bill-feature
Breakout above $85 any day
$200 by end of year?
The world is paying with their pals.
Get ready when they announce full year results.
One of the few among its peers still up for Year To Date... PayPal longs will be rewarded soon when the current rotation boomerangs
PayPUKE  still $309? Haven’t looked in a while? A lot of “overhead” pressure which means no matter their earnings it’s going lower! I think all the longs even though this BUT are like deer  caught in the headlights
"This too shall pass, and quickly i might add. PayPal is an unstoppable force at this point in time and the actions of eBay are but a hiccup. You were presented with an excellent buying opportunity and I hope you all took advantage of it."
PYPL LONG TERM $$$$$$$$$
Solid financials & a safe bet with massive upside. Stay long!

Crazy thing is...in this market...would any one be surprised if it took out 300 in 2 week's?

It will move up to $120.0 for sure with such a good earning and growing company. Hold and don't sell for now in a long term.
PYPL buys payment system for $2.2 Billion.
"Oh sweet, we’re going up again"
Wonder why PayPal didn't create an app where you didn't have to leave eBay site to pay. Seems that would have made both parties happy.
"Someone in here said 200 by Friday.. Who was that? It was not me, In my opinion, I thought PYPL would go back up from it's earnings down day but to 190-192.. Thanks for the suggestion Mr. 200.. I went out and got some calls yesterday because of that. Woot Woot!! Good luck all"
It feels good to own PayPal today. And everyday since $44. :)

Microsoft and apple are down more in the premarket than paypal.I expect them all to be green by market close.
PAYPAL OR SQ?
"VENMO is the standard SOCIAL PAYMENT PLATFORM for the new generation Y right now, control about 90 % of the P-P digital payment. There is no competitors that can challenge VENMO. Analysts try to commend about ZELLE, that can not compete and compare to VENMO at all. Only AAPL which has solid ecosystem that will compete with VENMO, but it is too late because PYPL keeps improving and add value into VENMO. The mobile payment will expand huge in the next 3-5 years. VENMO will be the standard mobile payment in the next 3 years. PYPL price will double in just the next two years."

Congrats to the Long dawgs who enjoyed this last run up! When I can move some things around and free money up I’m back on the PYPL train! This seems like a good forum with lots of nice people compared to other stocks!
There is a rumour that Berkshire Hathaway is accumulating Paypal stocks. Berkshire Hathaway will reveal its current portfolio tomorrow and if they have bought Paypal then we can expect more surging.
15-30 year olds don't use banks much or carry cash. They use Venmo. Very sticky. Extrapolate. Users are only 80 million for Venmo. Will be 150 million by year end.
Paypal gonna crush and then the stock will probably drop $20. Rinse and repeat this earnings season
The whole CNBC lunchtime has been discussing PYPL and the consensus is the stock is about to breakout to $100. All aboard!
"“While management was adamant the lighter top line outlook was mostly just a push-out or delays in partnership implementation and pricing, we believe it could quickly become a show me story.”well played"
"ARKK still buying $PYPL & $TSLA. These are not short term accumulations and being done with confidence of profit. I have and am in both, TSLA being the only stock I admitting have shorted in the past; no more. With PYPLs estimated value and record of earnings, I am miffed that it is not jumping. Investors need to stop comparing it to SQ and unhinge analysis fro Crypto movement. The run to $385 will commence again if Dems will stop tearing down the bricks that have held up economic confidence!"
Plenty of mojo this stock has!!!
Party just getting started
Paypal gearing up for massive earnings. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a big acquisition from them soon in the banking scene. First bought shares this week and its only up from here folks

Venmo use is surging.
I feel bad for the people that did not do their homework and thought this was a good short. I loaded up at $247 today. you still have time to cover before it goes much higher on the conference call. I bet it closes at 270 and opens at 280. IMHO

Holding Pypl shares after splitting out from ebay..it’s an excellent rewarding stock for my core holding
I would be patient With PayPal. This stock has so much potential energy being built up. If this stock shot up like square I’d be worried. Stocks that go parabolic have a huge tendency to take hard pullbacks and sell offs especially when they are pushing the envelope on valuation.
"Congrats to me for calling this to the T. I picked up 150 calls at .07-.08 per contract and just sold them for $2.30 ea....One of my biggest ROI's ever. This still has a bit more to go,but not risking it."
"why i bought paypal. im just old enough i dont consider myself a millennial. i prefer cash and credit cards. but i started a small architecture business that grew quickly the last 2 years, and i kept getting people asking me if i take paypal payments. i couldnt believe it, why where other single owner businesses wanting to use paypal instead of checks? i didnt argue though, i downloaded the app and bought the stock. glad i did, because my client list who use paypal is growing, and now i recommend it to people who ask how i prefer my payments."
"I guess all the ""value"" stocks will no longer require the technology stocks that will enable them to succeed.The stomp on the retail investor waltz continues."
Should be above $270 this week...as Tech comeback ...
I really hope Options Trader doesn’t do this for a living... what a tremendously terrible market sense he has
"Looks like the coming months are going to quite rewarding for shareholders. PYPLs interest in crypto currency vaulting and exchange (Bitgo) is HUGE! Now this is the innovative market capitalization I like to see. The immutability of blockchain fits perfectly within PYPL’s vision to create safe, secure and transparent transaction accounting of global/cross-border transactions. These events and the rumored “crush” of estimated earnings lends me to wonder if analyst estimates shouldn't be over $400/pps."
"If this isn't MM's carving out major profits with volatility, what is?"
Gap is filled
This will bounce back quickly. Good fundamentals. Focus on underserved. Safe payments. Great leadership. Strong cash balance sheet. The long term story should be a great one to tell in 2021.
"shorting at ,240 is a mugs game."

"Gotta love the laser sharp focus of this co., Danny would never buy a fledgling music streaming service..."
Paypal is only 10% of Ebays payments. The question is how much of pay pal's is ebays?
"It's a gift right here. This is a trillion dollar company in ten years. Don't trade it, just own it,."
What am I going to do with all this money!
"Paypal will have its run to 90 next week, use your adbe and sq profits to add a few hundred shares at 80."
topped up
Target $120: PYPL beat est in both top and bottom lines with double digits growth rates.
When’s earnings??
"I am also pointing out that in a Barron’s article last fall that Adyen was one of the companies mentioned as a possible acquisition by..... yep, PayPal! Just throwing that out there."
PYPL boom....shaka laka.
Knock Knock knocking on $90 a shares door HEY HEY HEY HEY.......
back up to all-time-high?
Trimmed some very long held positions in AAPL and AMZN to add to PYPL position on the massive dips a couple days ago. Saw it as an amazing opportunity that may not be repeated.
"Some PYPL bears may be pointing to the fact that operating and EBITDA margins have fallen since COVID first hit. That however itself is not a reason to be bearish unless you know why they fell. If we look at the income statement, we see that both EBIT and EBITDA still increased despite the drop in the margins. So why then did they fall? You will note that revenue, at the top of the income statement, exploded in amount over the last year, an increase far greater than EBIT and EBITDA. Therefore, we have found the reason for the margin compression. Therefore, the bears have no case here, as revenue, EBIT, and EBITDA all increased."
"""37.3 million net new active accounts, bringing total active accounts to 305 million, up 14% year over year. """"Revenue of $4.96 billion; growing 17% on a spot basis and 18% on a foreign currency-neutral (FX-neutral or FXN) basis.""""Repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock, returning $305 million to stockholders.""""3.5 billion payment transactions, up 21%."""
Why is PayPal’s EPS estimates by the analysts so high for Q4? Are they expecting earnings to increase that much more due to the Walmart and AMEX partnerships?
"My target is $300.If $320, I will be very happy."
"if cash money transmits covid19, wouldn't paypay and all other electronic forms of payment be a better bet."
"If we see good earnings today on AMZN and GOOGL, PYPL will rally very handsomely tomorrow"
"PayPal will gobble up market share in the crypto arena from Square once this platform gets rolling. PayPal is huge, and this bitcoin adoption was inevitable, only a matter of time. Square got a head start in the space but PayPal will take the victory lap. In almost every aspect PayPal’s services are more widespread, secure, and overall better than square’s."
What is a good time to buy paypal!?
Pypl is sitting quietly while the market rages knowing her turn awaits.
HAHA the Legend shorted this at $240
Just like I said.... Red by day end...... This market is in trouble
this was the same as baba yesterday. now look at baba. relax. paypals move will come
Call is at 5pm eastern...assume the results will get posted sometime between now and then. GL longs.
the price action today is clearly telling us this run is not over
"PYPL is very overvalued for some investors, but they are the same people that did not understand the internet in 1999, or so they claimed. Yes, these large investors, only can make money if they have information, by ""talking"" to the C.E.O.'s of companies. For them this is a matter of opinion, they will tell you that in the 1950's and 1960's insider information was not even looked into, so for them the culture continues and they old boy network makes sure they don't go away to prison. So PYPL for such investors is not going to be a lucrative trade, as they make money in one go, and advise the rest of us to buy and hold. The only way to make money like this is to create targets. They make money by having a definite result, and fight against momentum as part of their plan. In the near term they will bash PYPL because it the lowering guidance though not even significant was done at the earning conference. It is even suspicious why hypothetical guidance that to of 1% would be stated. It seems a window was created to lower stock prices on purpose. But after this, PYPL will continue to be more profitable and of course buyout more competitors. In the short term the stock may test 95 or even 90 but then it will bounce back to 110 and above. Hopefully enough investors can see through the smoke and realize that growth story does not end simply because of 200 billion in tariffs on a 14 trillion dollar economy. Again this is not even 1.5% of China's G.D.P. And this is done at a full 25% of all of China's exports to the U.S. the real amount will be less even at full scale trade war. So perhaps a pattern of manipulation can be seen very clearly."
$BFT will be $60 before the end of 2021 $PYPL $SQ
"Let us wait for the news of “ PayPal Has Been Talking With Amazon on Payments, CEO Says” Yes, it is old news but it is now more attractive on both company"
pretty obvious funds have $300 call options on this.
The big boys shorting before earning are trying to push the price down so they can close their short positions without loss or with less loss but at the current level they are running the risk being squeezed by other even bigger boys...
"oh my God what should I do. I have 359 shares. Worth about $30,000. Should I do a day order now or see how it looks in the morning."
What’s peoples thoughts on moving my Apple position into PayPal?
"Another tech grand slam, not sure what market will do. very confusing money pouring into super high retail valuations, staying long waiting for crazy M to rotate back"
A-N-D...... WE'RE BACK!!
Wish I bought more today
PayPal should buyouts STNE while it’s still in infancy
A screaming buy at this level. Between now and EOY we hit $100.......IMHO
"This stock is going to fly because PayPal no longer refunds processing fees back to the seller for return. Example a buyer buy a $1,000 item. The seller will be charged (2.9% processing fees plus $.30 transaction fees). Total out to be $30. Within a minutes later, the buyer want to cancel. PayPal will keep the $30 no matter what. Same for return. Everyone is addictive to online payment, there is no way around this. PYPL to infinity."
Finish 300+
The gift that keeps on giving.......
"There you go, Guy Adami CNBC, get into PYPL now."
"Awesome day longs, this is how great management works, time to buy major league baseball or football team now...lol"

The stock is good for traders (good volatility and predictability). This stock is terrible for investors.
130 tomorrow
"intersting why paypal go into crypto-- i read this today-- PayPal’s decision to get into crypto likely has nothing to do with consumer convenience and everything to do with positioning the company for the future of disbursing government payments and subsidies. careful investors who can get past the hype will see that the value of PayPal’s BTC move is much more long-term than a brief market boost. Ultimately, it promises to turn the company into a central plank of our financial system."
"Opened a new position today, 3 percent of my portfolio. I been on the fence, but this dip looks like a nice entry point. GL guys!"
Goes up and comes down the same day. So frustrating
I'm in.
"Cramer just put PYPL on the ""UP stocks"" list...companies that are hot that typically stay hot as fund managers add winners to their portfolios to close out the year to show fundholders they were picking the right stocks."
"Lol look at these PYPL whiners complaining how they're so poor from a $70 drop...there are stocks that have dropped 30 percent or more right now...be grateful for the money you still have. And as usual, in the bad times the PYPL bears come out to play and trash the company when the selloff isn't company specific. If you can't handle a 7 percent drop in the NASDAQ, think about what you lost when the market fell 35 percent in March...grow a pair of balls and quit whining and buy the dip. This selling won't last forever. My cost basis in PYPL goes back to the split from EBAY and if you think I'm liquidating over a relatively tiny drop like this you're mistaken. Come back to me when this is below 150. Then you have a reason to complain. Until then grow up."
PYPL IS A BUY TODAY.https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220
"it is the perfect spot for PYPL to move up in the next 2 weeks. I guess PYPL will move higher to around 78 teasing around the high, when when earnings report comes out then we will have firework because the big momentum from black Friday and Cyber Monday."
"As expected, another analyst raises target. Expecting many more in the coming days.Still a lot of room to grow! $280 around the corner!"
Lets hope we skyrocket from this base... just bought this stock so I hope earnings is enough to get it up to $96+ and more of course I'm just being realistic.
Pathetic that a $320 stock is trading at $260.
"Cramer said Paypal is a buy but to wait until the dust settles before buying...? Really, that is one way to be left in the dust and miss a major surge forward. PYPL was long overdue a bounce before the AMAZING BEAT EARNINGS announcement. I don’t regret my long position in PYPL the least and look forward to pre/post holiday gains. I can pick a hundred other stocks I would take short positions in, but certainly not PYPL. Bring on the analyst buy reiterations and upgrades; guaranteed they are in the works!"
Paypal was brilliant getting ability to buy sell crypto with ease and will generate huge cash
My analysis points to this: Current Support at 262. Current Resistance at 277. Stop Loss set at below 254. PYPL will distribute heavily below 254.
"if they manage to do it the current price is preety undervalued.but if they don't, the current price is extremely overvalued and will probably fall hard."
anyone buying more PYPL today?
Hope I just didn’t miss my chance to Buy in
If PYPL would offer even a minimal dividend it would hit $180.
Patience is the key here. I am long on this stock and down by $20. Market rotation is in full swing. Tech stocks have no bid. However this will turn around very quickly. A lot of these stocks are fairly valued now for their growth prospects. Once the inst start buying again you will see several up days and short covering. The key is we need to hold it at these levels around $240.
Remember paypal gave a 40B Free cash flow guidance. You wont give that if your not confident. I even believe they sandbagged this heavily. Have a good week longs
I put my tax refund(stimulus) to work. went to the slot machine and bought me some PYPL bitcoin. Supper ez.
Higher and higher we go.....
Don't miss out on earnings beat tomorrow morning. Either add or buy lots of call options. Easy $$$ when PYPL beats and exceeds.

paypal is on fire everyday!!!!
"PayPal Rises as It Has Best Quarter Ever, Offers Strong Guidancehttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/paypal-climbs-on-q2-earnings-release"
"This is one of the reasons I originally bought PayPal. With all the carnage out there in tech, we are only $4 from our all time high. This stock holds up really well during market sell offs. Important to own stocks like this. Can’t be all high fliers. You need grinders too. IMHO"
"PYPL was supposed to be working with accepting bitcoin, has there been any announcement in this regard?"
Anyone think PYPL will ever pay dividends some day?
"paypal is making acquisition, share firing up!!!"
"They are profitable so it will be accretive to earnings. On a strategic level , I have confidence in Schulman, he is a smart dude and has done a great job. A bill just aint what it used to be, lol"
Today on CNBC:￼ Pypl up over 100% in 3 months. It is a major beneficiary in the shift to e-commerce that is happening as a result of the pandemic. They are seeing unbelievable new new numbers of new users in volume growth because of people changing their behavior and shopping online. They have done 15 million new net users just in April and May alone. Their largest prior to any quarter then this one was 10 million. So a 50% increase in three months.Volumes are up 50% also.They have pulled forward three or four years of e-commerce growth in the first two months related to the pandemic. Amazing!
Now we fly folks
tarriffs are positive for pypl / no impact whatsoever / more transactions will be done on amzn - eBay - baba etc to avoid tarriffs
$90 by EOW
"Stay long on PYPL, your return will be huge!!! PayPal is right in the middle of the action and this digital adoption acceleration is the biggest reason PayPal stock will keep on winning in 2021 and beyond. As sales and accounts keep climbing and digital payment options keep accelerating in importance, investors can be confident that PayPal is well-positioned to keep its spot as a fintech leader and to reward investors with high gains."
Getting closer to my purchase price of 82.64. It’s just a mater of time. I’m going to hold this stock until my retirement year 2024. Good luck everyone...
"ARK bought 110,181 shares of PYPL today!"
For those who think this “eBay news” is relevant are probably new to PayPal. This was priced in back in 2017 when their separation was initiated. The revenue PayPal collected from eBay was once significant. It’s now dwarfed considerable by all of the revenue streams it’s added over the years. Not to mention PayPal was seeing YoY decrease in revenue generated by eBay. Bottom line: EBay news means nothing now. This was priced in years ago.
"ayden if it IPOs at the price they are setting, it shows how underpriced paypal is. they are really over hyping ayden with all this claimed valuation.ironic how when i end up on EU sites to order stuff i see PP as a option, don't even see ayden, many of the EU sites offer discounts for even using PP overs CCs for overseas customers. i talked to a UK business over there chat function. i was told it was easier the refund the extra VAT charges that we are billed up front thru PP after the order is completed than it would be thru CCs when using their automated shopping cart systems.some of the EU sites do not translate to english, when i ask thru their contact system about ordering, setting up a order, how to pay since i can't navigate cart, pay CC, or if they take PP. right off the bat, they respond we take paypal"
Got another 50 shares at 72.20
PayPal is the next trillion dollar company. Not Tesla. Bet.
"Just bought another hefty block of PYPL earlier this morning. Fundamentals are excellent, the company well run and the recent pull back a great buying opportunity. Looking forward to a long and profitable relationship with PYPL.GLTA"
just don't crash after earnings is all I ask. you know their going best but it looks like it doesn't matter in this market
Back on track to hit $100 by July 1st.
No better financial company to buy load up
$184? Haven’t covered even a single share and still holding 100% of my puts expiring Friday. I still think we see $150. Save this brilliant post.
"I just don’t see why you would sell this stock now, the constant M&A’s and ever increasing online retail make Paypal such a strong company with great outlook"
"So, excellent earning, all you can hope for in a report. The stock is soaring. What on earth is going on?? You mean earnings actually do matter? Who woulda thunk it. Hopefully, the sarcasm can be felt!! Finally, a reaction that is common sense."
Hope the upgrade will give PayPal today a bump up on what looks like to be a down day for the markets.
"Been holding this since right after it was spun off from eBay in 2015 . . . Liked the growth potential, operating leverage, and high (very high) incremental ROIC from investing in growing both sides of the business . . . Still holding, for all the same reasons . . . If it traded at $500 per share tomorrow, would I sell? . .. Probably not . .. In 5 years it might be trading at $1,500 . . . In 10 years from now? . . . Who knows . . . People like growth, so it trades at a higher premium now relative to current estimates - but not all growth is equal, and high incremental ROIC growth is hard to find . . . PYPL has a lot of it, most companies don't . . ."
Hold up pretty well in this market
"PayPal will be a future investment bank .It has the talent to create a quality user friendly trading interface OrIt will buyout a company for its app.It has 380 mill users , most will be trading off PayPal new super app."
"thanks paypal, very cool"
"Read the ER and it was fine. Massive top line beat, massive. Guidance was a tiny bit less than anticipated and they are trying to whack the stock. We will be back quickly. Another tempest in a teacup. Scones anyone? "
$bft replacing $sq and $pypl
Anyone buy the dip?
Crypto currencies ETH and BTC making new ATHs. Great news for PYPL!
Is there a solid reason for the up?
Technical breakout as it broke $80
"$TSNPD A $200 longterm investment in TSNPD will get you about 50 shares. Those same shares can someday be worth the same price as PayPal. Are you a dreamer? $200 into $12,000 challenge $PYPL"
I bought the stock on a dip 231 last week. I didnt even expect such a great profit in this short amount of time just wanted to own the stock because I use paypal for like 5 years already and I prefer it over everything most of the time. I am definitely going to hold this for long time
90 shares under 250 legooooo
One of the great positives.... Ebay agreement through 2023 three years longer than before! Again folks be careful of over exuberance. Remember we have four quarters per year!
"Shook out loose hand this AM, heading to $320"
Of all the stocks in my portfolio I see PYPL giving the best return over the next 6 months. It has a history of rebounding quickly. Of course being a solid company helps.
Can we close above 90 today
Big money moving in
Anyone buying crypto on PayPal￼ ?
"We must believe the cautionary guidance is behind us. Yes, there will be threats looming on the horizon, competition, regulation and the costs of expansion. However, there are so many opportunities awaiting PYPL, new emerging markets, user growth, monetization of assets like Venmo, acquisitions and a glut of free capital. Feel free to share any thoughts on this."

now we are heading to 120 and then all the way up to a new high
$200 at friday opening
Internet sales were up 16%over last year.... I think PayPal beats to the upside...earningwhispers.com says earnings on Jan 30 are$.70...That has gone up from $.54 three weeks ago
$10 a share rise will make me even! I’ll settle for that and hold!
"Well, if you think GOOGL earnings in impressive, wait till you see PYPL tomorrow"
Slow and steady climber

I think inflation will be higher in June. The PYP will reach 200!!!

"new support was created at 76, very strong support. now it's climbing back up, let's get to 77 before eod"
Sensible price valuations for PayPal for next 1-2 years?? Personally.. I think it’s still got LOADS of room to run..
now time to buy?
"full of shorties, don't trust them, research by yourself"
"if market goes up tomorrow,we may see 10 point rise"
PayPal is still heading to $100 a share. The fundamentals have not changed. What I like about PayPal is they have a pile of cash and they will use it if need be to increase shareholder value. Stay long.
"Those who choose to trade this stock will regret it. This is a ""buy-and-hold"". Getting in and out will only increase the chance that it will take off and leave the traders behind. I learned many years ago that trying to take small profits has always been a huge mistake in the long run. If you like a stock, just get on board and ride it up. Don't let the little corrections scare you out; that's when you should be buying more. Just think of the poor guy who bought BRK.A at $20 and took a ""huge"" profit at $200. It's now around $300,000/shr!!! That $180 profit looked sweet at the time. 100 shares bought at $20 in 1965 would be worth nearly $30,000,000 today. I'm not saying that PYPL is the next BRK.A, but it could be the next big winner."
This wants green today
This is my Bitcoin Ride UP!!!
Does anyone know what’s caused today’s surge?
PayPal Rocks.
Good for all those that held on. The negativity on these boards normally takes care of itself. Hoping SQ can follow positive as well.
Congrats to the longs in here. Was in 193-225 and should have stayed on. I’ll be back when I have some $$ and PYPl is going into my retirement account and I’ll be there when this hits $1000 someday...
PayPal becomes first foreign firm in China with full ownership of payments business.
"PYPL opening crypto to novice investors has been amazing for PYPL’s bottom line ; the bad thing is the $50,000 crypto purchase limitation! I wonder why PYPL has not introduced “PALCOIN” that has been kicked around for the last few years... maybe they should name it “Cube-coin” for SQ."
"For what's it worth my uncle is a doctor in L.A,He say's Covid will most likely NEVER leave us, much like the Flu.It will continue to mutate and we will develop new vaccines for more strains, much like the Flu.It will come and go at varying degrees year after year, much like the Flu.But of course, more deadly.Soooo, Im betting its good idea to stay in some of these so called ""shut down stocks"" as people will undoubtable choice to do everything ""safer"" for quite some time to come."
Numbers are very strong year over year
This $8 dropped looks nice to scoop up. won't last long. already curving around.
Whats happening after hours? Its down %1

Anywhere under $215 for PayPal is a great buy right now! I just picked some up. Good luck all!
"yup, this is the right company to be in"

Strong Buy https://cweb.com/paypal-scores-a-2-2-billion-purchasing-izettle/
Good for my $131c 5/8s I bought into this morning. Got a little scared for a sec but then “THEY REALIZED”
Sold at 82 and back in at 74!
"A red day in the market, Mostly all tech is down. PYPL is up. I am -7% at the moment... Next month back to normal. Not worried at all."
"People are using more and more PayPal (no touch) because of pandemic, that’s my observation, I have a retail business."
How many times sales do you people believe it should sell for? It's still 14x sales. I'm looking for an entry point but it still looks overvalued to me
PYPL down 6.6% in past month while NASDQ only down 2.3%. The thought of tougher competition is holding it back even though the financial news might be fine. I am going to hold for now.
$19 billion in sales on Cyber Monday. Can only be positive for PYPL if this becomes a record Christmas season.
Buy the dip? Green tomorrow?
Anybody thinking of buying anymore PYPL today. I am.
"In yesterday's interview with cramer, the CFO said to expect them to be very aggresive this year with acquisitions both small and large, as well as buybacks."
Where do you all see us tomorrow?
"We broke 90 today will break 1oo very fast,"
"if we make it to $200 by end year, i'm naming my first child ""venmo""."
when is PayPals next earnings date? is it before or after hours?
Forward PE 42 earnings and subscriber growth continues on upward trajectory. PayPal is a no brainer.
should we create a gofundme-page for BIG?
It seems PYPL has support at this level. After Christmas we will see the movement of PYPL. I guess CEO and COO will come out and do the promotion again first thing on new year. I want to see PYPL around 76-78 before earnings report.
$301 after market!
Bought a pypl call option for 2023 last week and it’s up 45% already. let’s go!!!
i believe 110 is doable today
Paypal and Venmo Rock.
I have a feeling the gain in the morning will not hold.
what happened. now down. I'm a buyer here
Death Cross has occurred to PYPL today (50-day moving average crossing below 200 day)
Pypl a can now court amzn and baba wihich it could not do before. Huge upside
"This stock is still cheap at $230. I am anticipating between the pandemic and growing online retail businesses, coupled with the explosion of crypto - this stock will be $260 in the near future."
"I believe there are some big blocks wait in line, because PYPL is very volatile all day. This morning I expect PYPL will be around 84.40 because of the index, but not. Let's see how high PYPL will close today. If PYPL passes 85 this week, we will see PYPL at 90 AT LEAST."
Was waiting for an entry point... just bougut some at 284!
PayPal is gradually ramping up and a ER result like Shopify’s +11.4% today is highly achievable here too with the surely blow out results on the way !
Some movement! Finally...
I just don't feel good about it if Ebay will move away from PayPal at the end of this year. Can anyone stop it?
"paypal, Hold strong, VENMO is worth the price alone!!!"
"Luck so critical. It was only 12 months ago that V is $100 ahead of PYPL, I was seriously considering switching all PYPL to V once the gap close to within $20 bucks. I procrastinate, now PYPL is ahead by almost $60. Overall speaking I still believe there is more confidence in the Dow giant than the Fintech juggernaut, at least from historican perspective and P.E. point of view."
Congratulations longs!
The homework I been doing PayPal Should be in the low 90's By the end of the week. a 100 by March
Tom has upgraded Paypal to a strong buy .... fundamentals will have it at $87 way before the end of this quarter
Why has sq yo-yo and PayPalhas remained static or even dipped a bit ?
"5% drop today is not a good indication re. the upcoming earnings report. Someone here said ""jaw dropping"". Yes, but could be a ""jaw dropping"" miss and the rocket will drop all the way to the ground...."
"There are some whispers that PayPal might announce a dividend on April 24th, during the earnings call."
“The most exciting news about Venmo during the call came from PayPal CFO John Rainey when he said he believes the company is a quarter or two away from breakeven on the app.”
Do you all see the number on $155 sept puts. It traded 6000 contracts so far today.
"Wow ! Over 500,000 shares filled up the cheap gap from $184.72 to $186.49 so far....it's huge opportunities to buy low before it leave the train, moving forward to big ...big holidays shopping online this month of Thanksgiving and the rest of this year holidays....for huge return when more and more people shop online for this full holidays season which just begins....."
At what time PYPL announce earnings for this Quarter ?
of course they are going to be conservative on guidance. any company with China ties will do the same as they should. let the whole virus theme play out and pick up some shares on the cheap if you dont already own it.
19% Revenue Growth Projected for 2021. LOVE THIS!!
"We may have a few more days to buy PYPL, After new year, I guess PYPL will flirt around 78. It is time to build the base around 75-77."
"Above average volume and stock move back to its ATH is looking likely with the strong job market, liquidity and fintech merger landscape. IMHO."
PayPal has huge potential to be a disrupter to VISA. MasterCard is more tech savvy but I can really see PayPal taking market share from Visa. Right now with the pandemic it’s increasing their revenue and earnings BIGLY. How they invest this capital is critical to their future success but I’m betting on PayPal!!!
PYPL is a should own stock for the rest of the year.$100 target near term after earnings.
I'm sick of hearing about square . Pay pal's the future banks
I have a legit question everyone. I never had a stock that was bought out. What happens? Does stock go down because of this? Or up because it got bought at a higher price?
Only in this overheated market would a company report both a top and bottom beat and watch its stock price go down. Perhaps a modest dividend would help Paypal get into index funds too!
buying more...
whats best to own pypl or v
$301 after hours .. . Gotta get in before Bitcoin rips higher over the long weekend?
How about paying your long time shareholders a dividend instead of spending $400 million acquiring a company that 95% of people have never heard of before?
Differential between Leader PayPal and goat lead SQ continues to widen. New acquisition today !

"Looking very good today, cant wait to see the end of the week"
what do you think will PYPL stock be worth by 2020... exactly 5 years after its IPO ? Any guesses !
the start of a double bottom reversal? I think so!
PayPal has acquired four companies over the past three months. It will take time but within a year or two earnings will grow significantly more.
"Hello, Im already long paypal almost 3 years. I almost cummed from the presentation? There are alot of doubters. But please the longs will win. 50B Reven incoming. Stay chill. Im opening a beer"
"52 Week high $309, price target $310."
Holding PayPal until after Q4. Should smash earnings but the crypto feature is the icing on the COVID holiday cake.
"""It was planned for in our financial performance and included in our guidance and it does nothing, nothing to change the long-term earnings profile for this business,"" Rainey said."
Let's hope this was just a good ol fashioned healthy correction before new highs.$pypl
"Ok, lets hold the $80. mark this time"
87.4% slump in first Quarter profit yet the stock hovers around all time high. 2nd Quarter result will be devastating. This will drop to new lows with rest of overvalued stocks
"Very excited about the future of Paypal! In my opinion, mobile payments will transform the retail business and it is only a matter of time until a company such as Amazon or Apple teams up to create a juggernaut!"

"Feeling incredibly fortunate. Long PYPL from $38.96 from the first day they went public. 678 shares. 2,000 shares of V since 2012, so... yeah. 500 shares of SQ at $60. 2,000 shares of Adyen (ADYEY) from last June. Obviously I'm a huge fan of Fintech. Recently bought 3,000 shares of IPOE (SoFi) which I think will be a monster. Also bought 3,000 shares of BFT (Paysafe) and 3,000 shares of FTOC (Payoneer). Once (if) Stripe ever goes public, I'll be there too. It will be decades before the Fintech market is saturated. Good luck to all!"

"Close to a billion Chinese are using mobile payments platforms. If PayPal can capture 0.05 of that, they would add another 50 million people to its platform. If PayPal sticks, you’re talking possibly 200 million newly added net active users in 18-24 months."

"Tech sector does not need tax incentive to move higher. They are all dominate the sector. PYPL I know will hit high note next month with out any doubt.

The analyst states that he expects the company's growth story to be sustained amid a shift toward digital payments, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. Palmer adds that Paypal's long-term growth trajectory has steepened with the announcement that its 333M active users would be able to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using their PayPal digital wallets."

"As far as fintech goes, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a dinosaur. It existed before fintech, or financial technology, was even a category, which means its high-growth stage is probably over."
HMBL will be connecting 160 countries in a one touch do it all from your phone system. We are talking 7.5 billion people from around the world in a single system. This will be the most talked about company for decades to come. Get on the train or lose your money with PayPal.
Pretty sure that this tax bill will cause paypal to skyrocket
For some reasons tech stocks doesn’t seem to gain much after positive earning report.
"The Motley Fool article does not specifically state Buffet is considering an acquisition in PYPL, rather he “should consider” PYPL... “But some shareholders have been critical of the Oracle of Omaha for not investing more in the two halves of digital payment duopoly Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) instead of his longtime favorite American Express (NYSE:AXP). In addition to other bets on the future of consumer and business transactions Buffett and company have made, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) could also feature prominently in the Berkshire investment universe.”"
"“Beck said Payal and Venmo are now transitioning from the investment phase of their cycle to the harvesting phase, a move that should be good news for Paypal investors.”"
The Best Stock Ever .
"Big, big day for PayPal... more to come!"
"Just as adobe's positive pre-announcement with accelerating revenue growth sparked a huge rally. I feel Paypal, can have a similar affect. We are begging to piece together a mosaic of positive techearnings. We are in the strongest season of the year, with the big daddys coming next week. Shorts have better cover, they over stayed their welcome. Im sure many of the algo's will also be switching over for the seasonality."
New 52 week High!!!
If it breaks $83.30 it’s a good sign that’s its beginning an uptrend.
PayPal just announced a deep partnership inside the Google ecosystem.
She will hit 100 in next month!!!! Got in at 82 during dip 3 weeks ago!!! Couldn't be happier she is getting the recognition she deserves

"Great quarter, should go higher"
Excellent interview with the CEO and CFO on mad money yesterday. Projections are 10 billion free cash flow in the future double the current cash flow.
It is a beat
"PayPal Holdings Inc.'s profit tripled in the fourth quarter as the company capped off what it called the strongest quarter in its history, fueled by accelerated adoption of digital payments during the pandemic.The company reported net income of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 a share, up from $507 million, or 43 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. PayPal's (PYPL) GAAP earnings per share for the latest quarter included a 60-cent net gain from strategic investments.On an adjusted basis, PayPal earned $1.08 a share, which came in ahead of the FactSet consensus, which called for $1.00 a share.PayPal generated $6.12 billion in revenue for its December quarter, up from $4.96 billion, while analysts were expecting $6.09 billion. This marked the first period in which PayPal reported upwards of $6 billion in quarterly revenue.The company's total payment volume (TPV), or the value of transactions made across the platform, rose to $277 billion from $199.4 billion, while analysts were calling for $267.9 billion. Venmo's TPV rose 60% to $47 billion, whereas the FactSet"

"Really have no doubt Paypal is going to surpise many and report stellar earnings. The issue, unfortunately, is that the market is not favoring growth tech stocks right now. Even though IMO Paypal should be looked at as a financial"
"According to my analysis (and a hazy crystal ball), PYPL can hit $200 tomorrow easily. Watching options now. Get ready for some astonishing movement!"
Whispers of PayPal working partnership with Facebook as soon as able to 2020 summer. Read up on it.Will be huge for both stocks.

I wish I had a spare £10000 to buy PayPal at & $239
Okay its almost show time 
Breaking out. Maybe will push $215 to $220
These days are gifts for whatever you want to buy.
"With Bitcoin prices soaring, and people buying left and right, PYPL stock will continue to fly. Not to mention record number of online transactions! This could easily be another $10 day in the green for PYPL."
Good Things come to those who wait .
"Strong mobile engagement on PayPal's platform contributed to approximately $57 billion in mobile payment volume, growing approximately 45%. In the third quarter, mobile payment volume represented 40% of overall TPV. Venmo, the company's social payments platform, processed approximately $17 billion of TPV in the third quarter, growing 78%. On a trailing twelve month basis, Venmo processed approximately $54 billion of TPV.HUGE NUMBERS"
While I hold some PYPL ..... SQ has more momentum and prospects than PYPL ... and it's showing in the equity returns over past 24 months ... will continue for another 24 months unabated unless SQ is acquired (which has a 50% chance in next 12 months). All good in my opinion
Still time to buy. 122 should be a bit of resistance!
Check out the insider sells. Very discouraging.
"In fact, Ebay charges a bloody fee to vendors, not Paypal. Ebay's days won't be long if it doesn't change."
Well I bought a few more shares at 255.50. I'll buy a few more if it drops to $253.I could be way wrong here but buying the dip sounds like a good strategy.
I'm sure this will do good on the ER but the chart shows a pattern that shows it's going down for the next 2 weeks or so. Patterns do change so you never know. I'll wait till the week of the ER go in.
Yesterday I made comprehensive technical and fundamental analysis of PYPL and it looks it has a certain momentum to grow faster in the upcoming days.
"COVID pandemic is now beyond control. States now going on full shut down, closing hundred of thousand businesses, so it will be back to tele-working and on-line ordering. At least one stock should be profitable from it all. It is going to be an ugly week for the markets if sentiment a d panic repeat itself."
Former Square holder here. Good entry point to buy PYPL right now?
Going to 160
TPV slide: “Deceleration primarily driven by slower growth in eBay.”
Why there is negativity on its earnings date…..Hard to understand…..
PayPal and their current technology and business model will be obsolete in the near future. Get out now and put your money into $HMBL at a bargain price today! Humbl will crush PayPal in time.
$WIMI $PYPL $RLX I feel so hard to play the Stock.Ah.tuition fees also paid a lot.
"PayPal price target raised to $290 from $270 at MizuhoMizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the firm's price target on PayPal to $290 from $270 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Mizuho's PayPal bitcoin user survey shows that nearly one-fifth of PayPal users have already traded bitcoin on the PayPal app and that 65% would use it as currency at PayPal's 28M merchants, Dolev tells investors in a research note. Rising engagement can drive a ""meaningful lift"" to revenue"
"Wish I can say I feel bad for the short sellers here, but I don't. Your money will be well taken care of by the longs."

at CNBCsays to 300!!!!Shorts better
"Merry Christmas to all you loyal longs. We hit $100 and more next year, which will make for a Happy New Year! !!!"
Amazing call !!!
Volume is picking up! PayPal will close strong!
For how long this PayPal stock will sustain near 100 P/E ratio. The company needs to improve the profits at least 300% in 1-2 years to sustain at this price or the correction can come any time in next results.
PayPal would be worth the same cap as MasterCard/ Visa in the next 2-3 years. Only weak hands would sell
right back to where it was yesterday. learn to take profits
Now a good buy?
"does ""debt N/A"" mean debt equals 0?"
Paypal raised 5 billion to help fund the new acquisition I to China.The % rate on the notes are lower than most peoples mortgage rates!Cheap credit to fund a bullish expansion into the world's second biggest economy.No wonder Mao is upset with his shorting shenanigans 
.42 cents a share vs. .32 cents a year ago. Very GOOD!
Why is it there are no comments about Izettle’s results?
Next week we hit all-time highs
"Guys,I've been following this conversation room and you guys were very helpful. Thank you though. For the very first time of my life, I got into this pypl & sq stock share market since last summer and made over $50k. I've always been a type of person who never wanted to invest into stock market because I thought it was nothing but a gambling but after investing almost a year, My mind was changed. I was very fortunate that I chose these two stocks. Ever since I read articles and news because of these two stocks, I became more interested in cryptocurrency/bitcoin. There are hundreds of different cryptocurrencies out ithere but one of them got me very interested which was Ripple/XRP. As a long time pypl stock holder, I wanted to let you guys a heads up on a investment opportunity in this XRP currency. If you guys wanna know more about it, check their website and search youtube videos.I've already invested $20k into this cryptocurrency market since last week. I am 40 years old and tried my best to make a best living out of my life and after working all these years, I have saved a little more than $150k and I still can't even buy a house yet. Since I live in LA, the house market inflation is so terrible and I just don't think it is possible for me to buy at least a house. It would probably happen when I become 50 or even older or never. There's a Korean saying ""If you were born rich because your dad is rich, you were born with a gold spoon in your mouth"" but I was born with wooden spoon. Even if I lose this investment. I am still remaining as a wooden spoon with or without $20k. :)"
Nice day for PYPL today.
Bought calls this afternoon. Looking for a rally into earnings.
Anyone listen to me and short $260 this morning Pre market yessssss
Maybe PayPal can fix the issue of leaving ebay
"I keep waiting for ""Red"" market days to buy more PYPL on a pullback. However, PYPL is always green. I guess the only way to get it to pullback, is when I buy. Works every time."
STNE should break $30 next back to $45 same with $PAGS and $PYPL target
Hope you didn't sell today. This COIN hype will fade away quickly. Paypal is killing it! $500 by summer.
"The fin techs are all being manipulated, Visa and Paypal more then masterCard and Square"
"Read the Conference call notes and you will understand how the loss has been cut in half already. Thorough understanding of the content of the earnings and the $10 Billion buy back set the stage for continued earnings growth and EPS is what drives future pricing. They beat the street estimates and the real issue is the business is growing at 27% , and the company grows on a counpounded basis in a little over 3 years. ( Law of 72 ). To put a finer point on it the company buy back will increase earnings on the current base by 10% over the time period that the shares are bought back. This could further reduce the years to double to 3 years when considering the even faster growth of Xoom and Venmo which is growing at an even faster rate of 50%. E-Bay is still growing after all these years at 6% and transactions in total are growing at 24%against last years 21% growth, Very nice. Margins are solid and growing. Bad loan loss is down by $50 Million. This stock is not yet priced to perfection even though it has been running like the rabbitt in front of the hounds.The model is excellemt with a minimum of moving parts when comparing to Banks, Finance , and has some moat for on-line revenue which is still growing at 10x+ over bricks and mortar. I believe the recent upgrade call to 125 is very achievable , watch and learn and buy this dip."

Did you know that eBay is introducing its own payment system? that means goodbye to Paypal as main payment method
Less than 2%4 hours aheadLet's finish green today
Will COnsumer index cause a negative or a positive trend to pAypal
PYPL's 1/2 billion into UBER. ouch!
"$280 here we go!!! every online store uses PayPal. not square. Paypal PayPal PayPal.... in Covid I have used it more than ever!!!! Venmo, Bitcoin app, etc."
Pypl shares institutional ownership is at 93%.. any pull back they will be buying
Seems like all tech stocks fell a lot. Which one is most likely yo get back to their all time high first?
"All my shares came from the eBay split. I have not checked in on the SP for a very long time. Wow, eBay was really holding PYPL down. What a nice surprise. I sure hope my KNDI stock continues to take off too."
"I understand how Venmo allows people to split the cost of meals, rides etc. however, I am not 100% sure how Paypal in general works. Will somebody please be kind enough to give me a simple explanation? I would appreciate it."
"to all square Fanboys in the US, square does not exist outside the US, while PayPal already is everywhere!"
Sentiment is this is a $100 plus stock...It will get there eventually.
$200 to $300 someday 
$78 $78 $78......the inevitable march to $80 continues. It’s a PayPal world and we’re just living in it. Now I have to Venmo an amigo a few $$$. Cheers!
when I look at 1week graphs in landscape and also in my gut. it feels to me that it's bottomed out at 235-240. I wouldn't be surprised to see 270 even 280 in a week or two
"There is a $clps conference on Friday. If $pypl is correct, at least $300+++"
$1.10 for Monday will be nice !
"Miss earning, miss revenue, stock up 10. NAISU!"
eBay thinks the better terms they got from Ayden will pay-off. What they will find is weaker sales because people who use PayPal will shop elsewhere. The trade off will have a negative impact and I would down grade eBay to hold or maybe sell until results can be analyzed from this move. I think its a foolish move by eBay management.
Opinion on buying today or waiting tomorrow before market closes?
No - this can't be it...
Any DIP today 's a great GIFT as VACCINES WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS / AT LEAST 1/2 YEARS FROM NOW.....ACCORDING TO BREAKING NEWS TODAY...
when are earnings
Tons of tailwinds are upcoming for PYPL which is going to explode!Cherish accumulating...
Attended huge festival last weekend. SQ (Square) was the one and only payment gateway. Seemed like all vendors had the square going on. Every hair dresser seems to use square.
Have every dime of my retirement in PYPL as of today. Not worried though...I have a check from social security every month.
I'm not hearing a thanks either.Sale by the way because its due to the delay of income stated previously that led to the sell-off/profit taking.Form is temporary and class is permanent.
I was selling PYPL during the last up cycle and missed out on the 'cream'. In the past month I started repurchase thinking that there would be an earnings pop but now I am not sure. The chart really looks like a head and shoulders formation and currently the techs are out of favor. Today has been painful.
Hey guys.This is the time to buy the dip.below $248 is best to buyThe buying zone is $247-243.Below $243 is very lucky.I think PYPL has at least 5% jump after ER.We still have one more day to buy at the cheap price.Good Luck.
Need to see PYPL 76 -78 by next two weeks in order to ignite the firework. We will see 85 by the time earnings report.
Only down six after the ER and the Tech Wrech today was amazing. We’re going higher amigos !
"Ending the agreement frees PayPal up to partner up with much bigger and better partners, such as amazon, apple, Alibaba. I think this is a win"
I expect revised analyst targets over $275 or more. Here is the future of monetary management.
"The Street - Bret Kenwell 11/2/20""For longer-term investors, that type of dip is likely one to buy - barring a horrendous development in the business. On the upside, bulls need to see PayPal reclaim the 50-day moving average and $200 level. Above $200 puts the $210 resistance level and all-time high in play at $215.83. Should PayPal continue sailing higher, the 361.8% extension (from the March low to the February high) is on the table near $235. ""Volatility. When the seas are rough, you don't abandon the ship... and that ship is far from sinking."
"NOW it is a BUY! Sub- 270 is accumulate point. Bitcoin reversal still not seen, yet fully anticipated."
very unlikely movement for paypal? any good news?
I don't see how a little bit of interest affect Pay Pal. The job market is getting. More spending
This is one of the few times I wouldn't be scared dropping 10k on a stock.
Like I said this was no surprise for the longs. This will be a steady climber in the portfolio for the next 5 years.
$93 is the key number for PayPal! We surpass that on a hot day and we could see a technical break out which lines us up nicely for a good earnings! Most likely going to see a slight sell off before earnings but that’s just click work. Good luck guys! I wish I had more funds to put into PayPal because I’m liking how this stock is looking in such political turmoil and global market instability.
Cue up the Rocky theme song........... We're punching our way to victory!
PayPal is on fire!
12 days to see how rigged the markets are. $200 a share is inevitable despite those forces.....
I'm going on record right now. My prediction... this coming quarterly report EPS 71 cents a share beating consensus by 4 cents. Others predictions?
One of the best long term stocks out there with digital payments and online shopping!! Long PayPal and MA!!
Purchased PayPal before earnings. I think we go higher.
Monday will be interesting
Wal Mart and other retailers foregoing Black Friday sales ...... More money flowing into online sales = PAYPAL hits $220 before Christmas!!!
"PayPal is still in its early innings. Many people get worried about competitors, but remember a rising tide raises all. Nearly a quarter of the world's population remains unbanked due to restrictions imposed by traditional banks. PayPal is just starting to provide services to the unbanked in the States; but the main beneficiaries will be third world countries with high mobile penetration and solid base of young early adopters. This alone will drive growth for several years as the global payments market is huge and PayPal has a massive lead on potential competitors. It should be noted that PayPal is continuously working to open up in many countries. For instance, it is likely that PayPal will be made available in Pakistan this year - this is a country with a population of 200 million people and is just one of many examples! We in the West mistakenly believe that the likes of Amazon, etc. can take a big slice of the payments market just like that; this is absolutely not true. It takes years to conform with the banking regulations of individual countries - hence providing a great opportunity and a financial moat for PayPal. This company has an excellent head start, and will continue to provide for many years to come :)"
"Options expire today, don't forget."
Just joined. Glad to be apart
Square was recently $60 lower than PayPUKE  now the same price
Again No surprise for the longs remember the 50b revenu guidance for 2025 is sandbagging
Undervalued 
stay strong holder we definitely beat this earnings report
The EPS I guess will be 1.2
"don't close your eyes , because tomorrow is the future , lets goo to 375$"
I think we all know by now that PayPal will be down tomorrow almost no matter what they report for their earnings. Enjoy!
It’ll be back to normal by end of next week. Load up people I added another 400 just now.
the expensive continues to become more expensive. the cheap is getting expensive. With rates at 2.5% the fed has 10 (ten) 1/4 point rate cuts to send the markets into ultra overvaluation. Retail is not buying at these valuations. The fed is buying these valuations. How long will the fed buy is the question. Place yur bets.
Congrats to those who bought at the bottom
89 tomorrow
"PayPal is dead in the water, so glad I bailed. Figured it'd go up after I sold as that's generally what happens. Nope, down is the direction. glta"
"what is this scary talk about ""Venmo, the digital money-transfer service operated by PayPal Holdings Inc., is ratcheting up pressure on users the company says owe it money for transactions that went awry."" from the wall street journal? is this cause for concern? have heard so much news about record credit card and loan delinquencies."
"Up to now, I still don't see any body will be good enough to match PYPL. Even V and MA which is the safe stock, but in term of growth I don't see V and MA can even get close to PYPL. I estimate that PYPL growth will be in the 30% area for the next two years. Don't forget PYPL has no debt. I just guess PYPL should split 2:1 in the first quarter to make it more attractive for small retail traders."
Still climbing!........ Strong Fundamentals!
$261 last night or $249 now? Made a fortune sold $260 and shorted $260
Buying 247.50 calls for Friday.
"I'm already starting to get used to new levels. Apparently, about 273 can be forgotten until next year.I will try to enter below and take profit in the 230-250 channel.This is the best result. But there may be an offset below.It seems to me that after the cycle change, the pressure in this sector starts to decrease. Closer to autumn."
and its ignoring the market sell off! well deserved paypal
"Don't stop now, square is closing in on he gap!"
"(Market Realist) PayPal (PYPL) and Google (GOOGL) have expanded their payment partnership, showing that they're finding more ways to work together despite their rivalry. In the most recent example, Google added PayPal to its Google Pay platform."
Rebounding
Boom
Had a buy order in at $76. Both happy and sad it didn’t go through.
This is a stock to own now and in the future. $95.00 by Friday or better after earnings!!!! Buy and keep!!!
"Plan on holding this until at leas $120, then I will decide on my next move."
Uber up 5%..
"Together we fall, United we Rise"
With the news stimulus coming e-commerce will benefit greatly
Even better for HUMBL
$1000 by the end of the day
PayPal great pandemic stock. Must be surprised earning
"This is already up 12 percent this month, for sure they gona crash it before earning"
Let's put some distance between us and SQ!
Goodbye shorts! KaBOOM to whatever paltry profits you made this week.
The first stock I ever bought 3 years ago. Kept buying overtime. And I will keep buying upcoming years.
"a little profit taking is good. consolidate, give buyers a chance to get in, moving average baseline adjustment, and continue the momentum."
Called it. Said it would close the week with a new 52wk high
Comparing Apple with PayPal is wrong. One has had a decade of growth and at the peak of its now and the other one is just getting started.
Hedge Funds obviously want another try at taking out 229.
"The chart experts were saying Paypal would go below 70, but as youc an see that has not happened. This company makes money and a valid challenger to Visa and Mastercard. In fast growing countries like India, they are skipping over traditional Merchant accounts are going straight to Paypal. There is a lot of growth ahead for innovative companies like Paypal."

Great numbers PYPL! Congrats! That ultimately will carry the day. Watch for big upgrades. Job well done Danny boy!
No way on earth this should be down.
"Louis Navellier has PYPL on his ""Buy"" list. This company has a great deal of upside potential with the new businesses they have acquired!!!"
ARK invested yesterday on PYPL
Holding up nicely today
Remember the days when a few of the Square holders would come here and trash Pypl? Guess the market put them in their place
"$87 by next Friday. $90 on earnings day. Q4 is always a good time for PYPL. Highest amount of online sales, highest amount of money transferred in Q4."
Wouldn’t be surprised to see $PYPL make new 52 week highs today or tomorrow!
I'll take it
Paypal to 195 by weeks end!
wow... we are in red already
Rob take a day off please. Your comments don't relate to PYPL.
Buy buy buy
$CLPS There is a rumor that $clps will be merged $pypl to advance into China.
SQ is up on the news of bitcoin which allows to buy and sell options on the phone. Hmmm. Interesting.
buy the fear baby. love the dips.
5.... 10 years from now Pypl will be 250-350 BILLION market cap. Currency will always be around. Always has. Always will. The way people buy and purchase things may change in future. But not anytime soon. Pypl strong buy.
Good time to buy V & Ma.Look at them the last few days.I noticed when money is flowing out of tech they just take off and when they start to fall money is flowing into PYPL and SQ.Trade accordingly.
anyone else starting to get really excited for this report?
after hour means nothing...stay long and strong
Does anyone else go mute.. mute.. mute.. before you get to the real comments? These boards can be very messy and annoying IMO. Exciting break out here. The stage is being set for a great 2021. Go PYPL!

"PayPal delivered another solid quarter, and consequently we are raising EPS guidance for the year. Net new active accounts increased by a record 41 million over the last 12 months, and engagement per active account once again increased by 9% to 39 times a year. Venmo's momentum continues, with 70% growth in total payment volume to $24 billion. Earlier this month, Xoom expanded to 32 new send markets throughout Europe,"" said Dan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal."
"Josh Brown, CNBC/Final Trades, “ This could turn out to be the largest financials co. In the world.”"
been waiting for this chance to buy pypl
Time to load up !!!
Ebay gave me a gift that is PYPL. What a gift!
FOMO
Last 4 ER's have created upswings in this stock. Overall trend since March 2020 is up.
Lets call Mad Moneys Jim Cramer tonight and get his thoughts on PYPL. 1 800 743 2622
Crypto option making this a rocket ship
"way over done, good buying opportunity!"
I just bought more shares of PYPL. this stock over corrected
Hello new owner
How can any company lose 20$ per share for no reason.But Suprisingly SQ is out preforming us @ 8 $ per share.
Strong future ahead for Paypal!
Just bought 325 more shares of PYPL
Loaded up!I believe in PYPL # 1
the local waste collection technician just told me he is getting rich from the stock market.
Let see $100 by Election Day
Fintech giant PayPal confirmed on Thursday it's reached a deal to buy payments start-up iZettle for $2.2 billion — the biggest acquisition in its history.
Ebay market cap = $42B. $9B revenue for 2016PYPL market cap = $102B. ~$11B revenue for 2016Who's helping who? PYPL makes more. A lot of people don't even use Paypal on Ebay. I don't see the cut hurting PYPL enough to cause this drop. Total overreaction. PYPL is proven and ubiquitous among many pay sites.
should I get in this stock or wait for a dip?
Today pretty good move.
Resistance has been broken! New 52 week highs coming.
My electric bill now has PayPal option. I keep seeing it in new places.
Cramer calling PYPL and a great ER. EBay way overplayed and already accounted for. Exactly what I said. Stock will power back up amigos.
"PYPL is DEAD $ for the remainder of 2019 .... doing a barbell trade -- long SQ which just has the most upside in this space --- short PYPL which growth is greatly decellerating! Too much controversey around PYPL and SQ just keeps pushing through any ""tension"" that is put in front of it. I've made alot off of PYPL .... but 4x more in SQ over the same time."
What price and how much are you holding?
that's a good looking cup
Almost time to buy back in.
"As @Big foretold: $85 by 10am on 10/24/2019. And after hours, @Big is busy moving the goalposts.Perhaps we have discovered our Contrarian Indicator?"
This is the best fintech name to own. Both a recovery and COVID stock. Bitcoin play as well 
IT'S A NEW DAY...TIME to BUY the DIPS.....PYPL...... and AABB Gold-backed Cryptocurrency Ethereum tech
PYPL will be over 110 before November 29~ as this week's chart pattern is indicating a pivotal pending parabolic up move when 105s breaks. Over 105.70 will trigger stoplosses on shorts and triggers fresh buyers who will ride it to all-time highs in the coming months. Would not be surprised to see PYPL over 120 before year end.
I bought this at $95 looking good!
Just bought @80.00
"cramer said buy paypal up to $98, you guys know what to do tomorrow morning"
I use PayPal everyday BUT I am short the stock hugely
"Get ready for the next leg up. Remember, management raised guidance for the year. The pandemic is still raging also, unfortunately. Cases in Florida and other states are still on the rise. Online shopping is in its infancy still with a lot of growth left. Also, PayPal is EXPANDING their business into other areas. The future looks bright. Buying every share I can with my spare cash "
We have lift off!
PayPal reached an all time high at 306.04
Bought some more
Going to love the reaction of all the naysayers this earnings
"Congratulations on the beat FedEx. But more importantly fantastic news on raising your upcoming full year guidance. Obviously, you see the massive amount of online shopping is not slowing, but phenomenally growing. $PYPL will be the prime tool for these purchases.FDX and PYPL, will be having a banner year. Well done."
That conference call was great. Can't wait for the expansion in China next year.
Gonna be up big tomorrow
Paypal is like buying apple early on. Just gonna sit back and hold for 20+ years and enjoy.
I bought at 83.78. Not worried at all. This will get back up in a few months. 100-150 by end of year. Most likely around 120. 35-55% increase from where it is at now. Nothing to worry about LONGs
Lets take the baby over 200 by tomorrow.
it's time to buy ? tiprank v this stock at 88
bought at 258.90. could not miss this ridiculous give away today!!
"Heading towards $100. 6 months ago I called for $100 by July 1, 2018. I think we will get there earlier than I predicted."
Staying long with PYPL is always a 100% sure thing. Glad I added more shares in the last few months!
Remember folks it’s not about “timing” the market it’s about “time IN” the market. Don’t lose money trying to time the tops and bottoms.
Why all the market is down???
Not that they need the money but the Insiders who sold in May/June must be kicking themselves a little. Plus the list of Institutional holders is up there with the best of them. Vanguard and Blackrock are all in. Looking forward to seeing $250 by this time next year. We may see a dividend or split announcement by that time.
I think this will be a very special report. 100 coming.
Great job pypl holders and longs... Was tough esp in February. Now we all know path of pypl. Future 200+ billion market cap.
"Recommend UNH, earnings growth rate, revenue growth rate is around 18-20%, the most impressive is profit margin gets even higher. See you at 235+"
"at this rate we will likely hit high 80 next week and pull back down to low 79, then back to 81 the next week or higher depending on news from online sales. 2018 is looking to be just as good as 2017 or better"
"PayPal will not stay at this level long, if you have been wanting in, get in now. All of the hoop-lah noise will die down soon. And this will be 80+. Folks will be saying, “why didn’t I buy shares when it went below 75??” We all know it’s going to happen. I don’t even think it has been confirmed that Amazon is actually doing what was mentioned, but even if they are, it won’t keep PayPal from growing. This specific market is too big, with Venmo growing at a great pace, and PayPal continuing to grow, this is a no brainer. I’m heavily invested in PYPL and Visa."
Trading at the bottom of it's trendline. should rebound soon.
"if bitcoin bounce right back today to new highs from the selloff the other day, PYPL gonna gap right back up to that buypoint at $216...its tried to breakout so many times I cant count anymore, and $218 breaks but then it goes right back down , really need to see it clear $219 it seems.....it wants to run but markets didnt let it today.....did sell my calls for Jan since time was running out and had a massive gain, glad I did since i sold them this morning as soon as $218 brokedown"
WHAT TIME RED tomorrow ? I say before 10am EST. If you are long sell pre market and short than at 9:30am buy as many weekly 260 puts as you possibly can
"does not matter what the earnings report is, typically this has fallen after earnings report- even when it has beaten expectations. this has had a high run up the past few weeks -so good chance of going down"
New high end of year!
"This is what happens when a stock is in a bubble. Everyone kicks her like a dead dog. Either inflation information or some kind of falling bitcoin.Dangerous paper. Fesbook is also falling, but at its annual highs. And the rebound is faster.But today the PYP is approaching 245, which is likely. If again some passer-by does not kick this dead dog)))"
"This is not a stock you trade. This is a stock you buy and hold for years. Their story is intact and growth is on track. Temporary ups and downs from market trading don't change that fact. If you buy and hold, you will be rewarded."
"Big, how you doing? Remember me from when we were at around 100 a couple months ago!? Ahahaha how's the silver working out for you "
The earning call is at 5pm EST right?
"IMO, PYPL should just merge or buy SQ, if so, they would almost be unstoppable. Pretty much own the USA and Europe markets in this field."
Oh yeah......... I had forgotten about eBay..........
Based on the volume I can only wonder if some insider information has once again been leaked out ahead of the call.
"Buying, Target $270"
$80 is not far off... right around the corner :)
$280 next week
"After a great ER, this better jump to 100 in a week or two! ok three!"
Wow! Anywhere under about $190 is an awesome buy! They are going to report a great earnings beat I believe. Good luck all!
"You have nothing to worry about with PayPal it’s a longterm hold. The price is a gift right now buy more if you can . A couple of others to buy now at the dip or watch very closely PDD, SQ, TWLO and Docusign .there are to many great stocks to name but here is a few"
"Trumps economic recovery plan is loosing steam apparently. Thank you koolaid Joe, but Bidenomics is not working, or is it the rumors of your failing mental health?"
"Don't worry, this is just accumulation day before the run and blowout report."

"Paypal should be a $400 stock with Vemo and making money off Crypto exchanges, advertisements, ect."
Real price $117
I feel +5% on Monday's close
"Well, it seems to me that PYPL is already up quite a bit. So, according to my limited stock market experience any surprise in eps will not be a great cause for celebration, and the likelihood is that the stock will falter because some small thing with be found that will not be as good as expected. Xoom is not exciting, and PYPL is generating income from investments now. Consumer outlook not as hot as it was before. I'm not as excited about PYPL as I once was, but I'll see what happens after the bell on 7/24. Not holding my breath."
I use PayPal for EVERYTHING! Added to my position!
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-forecast-comes-up-short-company-announces-52-million-active-venmo-accounts-2020-01-29
Any chance to go up in after hours?
It's so weird seeing stock drop after a good earnings report. makes you wonder about how rigged the system is. I'll just buy more tomorrow. I see this hitting $300 in no time.
Dan on the earnings call said that eBay have zero growth in payment volume and declining numbers that hurt revenue projections for the year. Leaving eBay is the best thing to happen to PayPal. eBay is going down hill fast.
Up over a dollar in early trading. I sense new highs coming very soon.
"View WatchlistPayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) shares rose more than 2% on Friday after the company confirmed that it would acquire iZettle in a $2.2 billion all-cash deal. The move is significant because it marks PayPal's entry into the point-of-sale transaction business, which puts it in direct competition with Square, Inc. (SQ) and Intuit Inc. (INTU). At the same time, the company’s core business has been very robust ahead of its investor day coming up on Thursday, May 24.iZettle was previously gearing up for its own initial public offering, in which it planned to raise $227 million, valuing it at about $1.1 billion. The company is one of the largest payment processors in Europe and has operations in 12 markets, including Northern Europe, Mexico and the United Kingdom. With shares trading higher, the market appears to see many synergies in the business despite the lofty acquisition multiple.

If only I had the funds to buy more paypal right now.. i feel like I’m missing out.
Analyst conservatively raised price targets. Digital banking in multi-currencies and a rapidly growing customer base bodes well for investors. This is not a Robin-hood stock and one I would avoid shorting.
"IBD = Investors Business Daily just commented that Paypal was in a bullish chart pattern a ""Cup and Handle"" could be on the verge of a good move up!! Also, Paypla's mobile payment business is growing gang busters.In the future you will see lines at the check-out down to a by 70% as folks will be using phones to pay and go. And Paypal will be the leader there."
PayPal has no reason to hit 65 
Numbers are fine - nothing to worry about. We will march on for a strong 2020
This is setting up for a nice upward reversal after the ARK reallocation. Won't be long until we see another 30% gain and PYPL's crypto security acquisition grow confidence. I am less confident with SQ than PYPL... I would like to see a merger between the 2 if the FTC and DOJ would allow it. Talk about a mega FINTech to bury banks!
Cash carries germs. Look for new venmo usage to skyrocket in the coming quarters.
"Regret adding to my portfolio. This company is just a total dissappointment. i cant find any reason for it to drop this much. if anyone could, please enlighten"
$PYPL is the most established and long running fintech solution on the market. Their service is seamless for users and they are only becoming more prevalent. PayPal is here to stay and several analysts have raised their price target to $200.
Will today be a good day to buy more PYPL?
anyone else not really care about the dip?
"My equal weight FAANG stock portfolio has done exceptionally well YTD, up 40% TR vs 4.5% TR for the S&P. The question now is: does one hold on to the FAANG stocks or will there be a better alternative sector going forward? And if so, which 5 stocks within that sector would you invest in? My answer to all of the above is, I believe the below five stocks will be the top performers of the S&P for the next six months (I refer to the picks as BPMCS):BLACKROCK $BLKPAYPAL $PYPLMASTERCARD $MACME GROUP $CMECHARLES SCHWAB $SCHWBPMCS stocks might have performed 15% YTD vs 40% of the FAANG stocks, BPMCS has however, half the forward P/E multiple than FAANG and almost double the ROE.Again, I’m not predicting that FAANG will do poorly from now on, all I’m prognosticating is that BPMCS will be the top 5 performing stocks in the S&P from now till the end of the year.AP"
Legend has left the building

"CEO Dan Schulman: “I think it bodes well, obviously, to have both more customers coming on than ever before, using this service more than they ever have.”"
Not sure if anyone’s posted this already but Dan Loeb believes PayPal has the ability to hit $225 in 18 months!! That is the bullish talk I like to hear from big investors!
"There are 2.6 million Bitcoin left to be mined. Surprisingly, even though 18.4 million Bitcoin were mined in just over 10 years, it will take another 120 years to mine the remaining 2.6 million. That’s because of the Bitcoin halving. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (a new block is created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. About 900 Bitcoins are mined per day."
Buy time for PYPL holders to average down. wont get this chance everyday.
Well done PayPal heading into ER mañana. Get ready to Rocket compadres! :))
Anyone heard of an app called Revolt in Europe? Sounds like a fast growing banking startup. I am just curious if it bring opportunity or threat to PYPL
"I’ve traded $PYPL and SQUARE in the past.Just started trading long options on PYPL .No 1 wonder why ETSY Price was up like 7-8PTS today.IMO, PYPL could swing to 200-205 tomorrow... Maybe it will have a 30pt run up in this market, esp.“BEST QTR ... YEAR SINCE ITS IPO”MAYBE , its undervalued as a transaction - FINTECH- stock.I think this EPS A D FWD GUIDANCE was EXCEPTIONAL!And those fwd guidance comments about Covid is n will permanently change ‘Fintech’ payment structure...and in general going fwd this Fintech - e-commerce WILL CONTINUE to further rely on this platform . IMO, from what I gather the COVID Situation ‘jump-started’ this fwd trajectory into system people will continue to grow PYPLY , due to ease of use n also once a consumer develops a habit / routine with ease, timeliness n efficacy... they will continue with what works!!IMO, PYPL, there could be an underlying positive issue. PYPL will prob rise after ETSY, EBAY WAYFAIR, and transactional platforms will prob cause PYLY to rise after their Upcoming EPS’s .... IMO it should be trading around 200 - 210 - easily I think the EPS / FWD Guidance/ CC were just too positive... just my rant lol"
"$SQ $PYPL, has anyone heard about this week kept secret called $TW?"
New All Time High - let the good times roll
100 dollars is coming very soon easy

"PayPal will go up to $228.00 per share. I like the outlook. Another stock, TSNP is being talked about as a Baby PayPal. The merger to HumblPay is complete. Check it out."
Waiting on some big numbers when earnings get released. Very exciting time for PayPal......and what's going to happen with Venmo?
Down 10% in a week
"20.2 million net new active accounts added, including a one-time addition of 10.2 million in January from the acquisition of Honey; 10 million net new actives added–a Q1 record• 18% TPV growth (19% FX-neutral); 12% revenue growth (13% FX-neutral)• GAAP EPS of $0.07 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.66; includes $0.17 negative impact from increasing credit lossreserves due to revised macroeconomic projections• $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations with $1.3 billion in free cash flow"
Now paypal is free to choose who they want to work with. Ebay used to make them slower not faster.
"great day. We'll pass 80 soon, hopefully by the end of the week or next week."
PYPL earnings still going up. A good time to add to your position
Bought more at 72.10 hoping that is the bottom..... I have faith we will see the 80's again....
JUST BUY IT! IT IS NO BRAINER STOCK.
so you know what's better thsn 69? 79
I just bought 1200 more shares of PYPL@ $78.32
BOOM....
"New highs today folks, long and "
"Well they had a huge quarter as we all expected. I’m worried about the short term, as +$10 isn’t really much, considering it was -$11 just two days ago. It hasn’t even made back that one day loss in after hours and if AMZN is any indicator, they may end up flat or even down tomorrow. I feel great about my long term shares as it’s obvious PYPL is going to be a long term monster and will be only building on this success as the year progresses. I don’t feel so good about my shorter term calls as the funds may wipe them out, holding down the stock for a while... Fingers crossed that smart money decides to change course on tech soon."
Raised guidance
uhmm revenues are up. Earnings were expected to be lower because of purchases
"Adyen is a financial start up.. most likely ebay owns a chunk. This is a deal that may have major negative repercussions for ebay.. it could become a disasterous move, in hindsight, and shift people toOther platforms like amazon to sell"
"In case you didn't look, 10 year bond yield has been rising consistently since Sept 2020. It didn't stop Paypal from peaking at $309 in Feb 2020."
https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling
bigger question imo is will AAPL report along the lines of 3M? this will break techs run and pause to the markets bringing all stocks lower. thoughts??
i am surprised PYPL is green today after so many bad news
All is good...good Call so far..Business is booming.. wait for some strong upgrades !!!
how were crypto numbers?
each transaction carries a $3 fee? good for Pypl bad for poor people?
"For those of you complaining... do you NOT remember what happened last week..... You ALREADY forgot?? PYPL was up like 3-5% while SQ and others were down... You can't expect a stock to go up NONSTOP. Stop the complaining, in the long run, you make money."
Bubble man . You are every message board ? So who is investing this before earning ?
breakout coming!
I'm buying more PYPL this morning
"Investors should listen to all the details in the conference call before dumping all their shares.The statements below give me confidence in the future of PYPL. PayPal Chief Executive Daniel Schulman characterized the move as expected and baked in to PayPal's forecasts and plans for some time, and noted the operating agreement signed at the time of the split precluded PayPal from working with some large potential partners. He called it ""the best possible outcome for PayPal.""""There's nothing about what's been announced today that changes our thoughts on our ability to continue to grow our top line and bottom line after the operating agreement,"" PayPal CFO John Rainey said in that company's conference call."
Let's all punish eBay with short.
"Tomorrow good chance we break $90.I suspect triple digits sooner than mid year now.Money machine and maybe we get a acquisition third quarter to catapult us to $150-200 range by year end. Afterhours meaningless, don't ever think afterhours is an indication of what happens the next day."
I think its about time we beat the all time high today!
Less than $10 from $100. We are so close I can taste it!
bought more PYPL today $82.24
"eps has to be good, Jeffries has put a $145 target today"
is that a massive breakout on silver and gold? hello? is there any more cheaper an asset than silver?
What is reason for selloff today?
Happy to have sold completly V for PYPL in the last 3 months.
kevin the legend...huge but short....short and huge...!
"Bought in after the IPO and continued to hold. Ditto for Square. Will re-evaluate my PayPal position at year end. Square has been on fire and I doubled up twice on it. PayPal also has a fantastic story, every analyst discussion on the stock has been very positive. Many having it as one of their ten best stocks to buy, so don’t understand why we are not taking off. I firmly believe in the company and I am a client. The buck stops with the CEO."
PYPL will fly on Monday
My experience told me that the option buyers start to bid the price close to the offer. PYPL WILL GO EVEN HIGHER TOMORROW.
You guys expect a dip tomorrow or nah ?
Can't believe SQ is up 14$ and we are down 3$.It's all inside dealing.
"Donald Porterfield, via his hedge fund buying PYPL.target price $210."
"PYPL is still Bullish, trending upward."
Oh so close!
"Did anyone see on CNBC explaining how PayPal could be next Reddit trading action. There's a video and the man explaining said it needed to reach $300. But at close it was like $289.19. And finally after hours at 6:02 pm est. It reached $300, I don't know if it will fly but just was wondering if anyone saw the video. If so can you post it? Also I would like a more detailed explaination of what the man was saying. It was on yesterday 2/11/2021 on that show right before Mad Money. I thought it was strange they barely covered Pay Pal activity today, I mean it was up $11+ most the day today. That's news worthy. Thanks to anyone who can help post the video. Please post it on the main page and in comments here too. Thanks."
"K-BOOM! Added a few hundred more this morning. Figured its my last chance under 200. Buying for me is done, now time to sit back and enjoy!GLTA"
"Fear not, my PayPal friends. PayPal will recover, and I love PayPal. It made me a lot of money. I rode it all the way from $40 to about $78. Now I mentioned $TEUM a cpl days ago and look at it now!! This is just the beginning too! It’s up 8%+ today! $TEUM is going to be huge! Get in now while the price is unbelievably cheap :) you will thank me later!! Huge backlog that hasn’t even turned into realized revenue. It’s a golden (semi-hidden) gem waiting to explode! As always, STAY TUNE!!!!!"
"I don’t understand why everyone panics when the stock goes down?? That’s how the market works! Do you expect the stock to just shoot back to $85 a share.. If you’re panicking when the stock drops, just don’t invest in the company because you’re not truly invested in the business model. If you’re just here to day trade paypal you should probably rethink your “day trading” strategy because there are way better stocks to day trade."
i wish i had bought tesla today instead of paypal. am unlucky
Remember pypl is just getting started with Crypto trading. This stock can only point upwards.
"Stayed strong through a rough opening Monday, compared to some other stocks"
"visa, mastercard, and capital one are giving away large amounts of cash rewards to cc users. lots of credit building going on with cc's as well. never been a more profitable time to be a power user of credit cards. each dollar used from a paypal balance generates a cost in the form of lost credit card rewards. think about how that adds up over a year. Paypal is ULTRA expensive to use."
"Shorts are needing a change of shorts right about now,"
Will gap up today
Up we go!
I hope it dips 15% or more so I can load up on a great buying opportunity. PayPal is a great company with a bright future.
I think tomorrow will be a good time to add to my pYPL holding. this is still a good co. with good earnings
"Lest we forget, it's the leader in the number 1 economy in its field and has expanded into the number 2 economy recently"
already 17 million shares? WOW!
$200 coming..
Itching to break through yesterday’s close..
"PYPL down today, temporary, GPN up all day, like to compare but just own PYPL."
why would anyone buy Square over this? I really don't understand the Square craze.
Been long for some time but...........Something is not right at PYPL because this stock should be following suite with SQ. Upgrades are there but it doesn't move.Management is completely mum and Venmo has no clear direction as to what to be. If the CEO & the rest of mgmt languishes with indecisions Venmo will soon be a flavor of the past..........rather frustrated with management's lack of clear direction and innovative ideas
Third Point says this stock is going to $125. Still cheap.
Lifetime buying opportunity

Breaking: Citi raises price target to $186 (from $145) maintains BUY ratingand Susquehanna raises price target $190 (from $150)https://seekingalpha.com/news/3584119-citi-susquehanna-see-upside-for-paypal-shares?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=pypl-citi-susquehanna-see-upside-for-paypal-shares&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-2
"Huge volume this morning, Paypal my highest conviction stock. I think they are going to hit earnings out of the park this week"
"For those who say the charts need a break let me explain something, right now during this pandemic there are VERY FEW COMPANIES that are GROWING, not only giving guidance BUT RAISING GUIDANCE. PayPal has had a big run but it’s not over. They RAISED GUIDANCE. That means BUY ANY MINOR PULLBACK"
"PYPL got a shoutout from John Najarian, on Fast Money, tonight. “This thing is going higher. Giddy up “!"
"so like to see these dips to show everyone how we get higher lows every week. (said lower lows earlier, oops)"
How could you not love this equity? “I will Venmo you the money” How many times a day or week do you hear that? PayPal owns Venmo. How often do you buy bitcoin and get charged by PayPal? PayPal credit? You are nuts if you can’t practically think how this stock fits into your life. Will it be here 5-10 years....why not? That’s why you own it! It is on sale this week!! I bought more!
"Anyone who is confused by price action, it was quite easy to predict if you were looking at the level II data. There was a wall of sellers at $300. I’m a long term holder but I was buying put options at $298 when I saw that. Did not capture the entire drop but still took advantage of a very clear technical level. Next time it passes $300 it should become strong support."
PYPL's CFO coming on CNBC in moment
buy paysafe everyone
BIG? where are you?
HMBL is the next paypall. Jump in before it takes off !! 
Believe
PYPL will be in CNBCon Mad Money tonight!UP we go to 300+++++
"Oversold, and could hit 250 today. WATCH."
"PayPal Website says this: ""PayPal Holdings, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss these results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time) today.""As of this post, it's 4:33PM EST....So, how on earth is the stock down 6 dollars evening before the announcement ?????"
Shorts attacking. Interest rates rising.
Uber up 5%. Where are the haters?
LETS HERE YOUR PROJECTIONS ON PRICE TOMORROW I’ll start $272
"These are powerful long-term trends that should continue to propel the growth of Square and PayPal for many years to come. Investors, therefore, would likely be best served by holding on to the stocks of these e-commerce leaders."
"Don't sell tonight, It'll be 270 tomorrow!"
The last years worth of ER have been great and the company is growing great and they’ve made lots of moves I expect good things but I don’t like how bearish the market is right now
Current P/E is 84 and 12 month forward P/E is 51 doesnt that mean that analysts are expecting the price to go up in 12 months? i cant think of other explanation. and by the way the Forward P/E is used by the FED
Let’s see at least $80 today. It’s been too long around this range when all the news has been good.
300 today
Let’s hold $80! Be a great way to end the week.
What time is the earnings tomorrow
"SQ quarter report come out today, right? I wonder how that will effect us..."
No matter how good PYPL earnings are it’s going down! Doesn’t take Einstein to make this call. So easy & obvious! Save this brilliance
"A key statement:“The really interesting thing is that we not only saw the strongest quarter in our history, but as we look forward, we’re continuing to see elevated levels of digital spend,” Chief Executive Dan Schulman said. “And we now believe the shift in consumers’ digital behavior is going to remain essentially unchanged in a post-COVID world.”"
$115.95 is the next resistance level. buy buy buy
What a bargain! ￼
when all these paid guys come into these chats bashing stocks. YOU BUY.
Just dipped and bought 100 shrs at 174.80 I think the risk is low right here. Could pull back more but not much.
Looks like the fire sale is over.
"Surely this company would perform extremely well during the black Friday, cyber Monday, thanks giving and Christmas with everyone almost being forced to buy online due to coronavirus."
Its going parabolic today
Thank You.
Hmbl news after the close! May be the next Pay Pal! FORW in lock step!
"PayPal assumed coverage at Buy with $280 price target at JefferiesJefferies analyst Trevor Williams assumed coverage of PayPal with a Buy rating and $280 price target. While he acknowledges that the stock faces a more difficult set-up after a 100%+ gain in 2020, he thinks the company's position as an e-commerce pure-play with a unique two-sided network support the long-term outlook, Williams tells investors."
we just reached the 52 week high!!!Going Higher!!!Just hold on tight!
"Just bought more PYPL, 325 shares going a lot higher"
Good volume confirming the higher move. This will be a $125 stock shortly
Incredibly cheap $SHOP $PYPL $TWLO all made new highs $SQ not even close to $100. Chart is poised for a major break out $77 tested so many times technicals has this pointing at $105 if it breaks $83. Forget $77 look at for $83 new resistance don’t sit on the fence and watch.
I just bought more PYPL at 104.70
"I have no doubt that PYPL will fly to 90+ next week. The mobile payment at the record, E-commerce at the record, no debt reserve for NPL and TAX CUT."
PYPL should move their corporate headquarters overseas to save on new taxes that biden going to raise
how do listen to conference call?
So far holding our own on another tough day for tech.
just bought in. Lets go up!
"PayPal and Square may both be having a tough month, yet the superiority of PayPal shines through as the differential between their prices widens"
"Buy when there is fear. Sell when their is giddy, silly exuberance.$PYPL $AMZN $SQ $TSLA $CRMDon’t fall for the old dinosaur’s technology. Some old greedy Wall Street Fund Managers have egg on their face. This temporary phase will pass. And the young employees at these out of touch old greedy fund managers, will be putting their funds dollars where the future lies, not what grandpa greed can not understand.Grandpa greed will pat their young “protégés” on the head for thanking them for getting them in on this dip."
Three stocks to be in right now: $SQ $PYPL and $TCEHY.
buy & HOLD
"PayPal has given me a great year, got in last Feb. 20th and couldn't be happier! Congrats on a nice move up this morning."
People underestimate Venmo. Sleeping giant starting to rise. Buy and never sell
What PayPUKE  bag  holder is in $309? How about $260+ when I was the ONLY one to give good advice telling you to sell & short $260
Pushing 85 this AM.Long since July 2015 and holding.
What's an ebay?
Bitcoin is not in use PayPal is....It will hit 120 this Yr...once it takes out 80 next stop is 95 two good ER takes this thing to 120.
"PYPL in China presents a tremendous revenue source! AXP was first banking company in China, so I thought. PYPL is gradually becoming the Worlds Bank!"
Next week PYPL will touch $200 most likely after their earnings report
"I’m considering switching from SQ to PYPL, what’s your opinion?"
red yet?
"Earnings fine...,.guidance fine....PYPL fine, it's just a victim of the market volatility. Buy the dip"
"I have known Honey deal is a very sweet deal and said it will up-end Amazon's dominance in online retail, but never thought it is Amazon's reaction to this deal justifies the price that PayPal paid for Honey; so interesting."
"Wallstreet at it's finest, trying to scare away jumpy investors, and then quickly buy up the cheaper shares... The fact is, PayPal is rapidly becoming an unstoppable money-making machine. So let's ignore the noise, stay long and strong and enjoy the digital future!"
Fintech sell off for some reason. Anyone know?
Wheres the bottom?
Since this is PP board....let me remind you that Ben Carson is still alive. 
Could anyone who is well versed in options fill me in if the call option for PayPal for the $92.5 (10/19 expiration) is worth it? Trying to learn more about options.
PayPal in 2021 will be second only to Bitcoin in performanceand return on investor equity. PayPal will overshadow TSLA.
"Earnings announcement* for PYPL: Jan 31, 2018. PayPal Holdings, Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 01/31/2018 after market close. The report will be for the fiscal Quarter ending Dec 2017. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 12 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.38."
ok...im starting to smile
I think it found new support at $116. The chart continues from here like normal I think. $2 dollars more to gain to be back around yesterday's close.
"Seems to be the pattern. Sell on the news. Not a bad quarter with huge growth numbers. Just not enough growth for some investors. Usually, come back in a week and its recovered all it loses and then some."
really good day to pick up some shares today!
111 coming in April.
I'm buying more tomorrow if the price drops!! Just more opportunity! $$$
"So for people who are interested in company fundamentals hear me out:PYPL has been solid on its fundamentals but is it gonna continue it in future?Well theyre adding new services like cashing checks, Buy now pay later, crypto,stock investing and funding. And plus developing new super app. But the thing is company is just testing these services with lts limited set of costumers. Here in canada we dont have any of those services and we dont have venmo. So the thing is they are testing new services with small number of costumers and if theyre successful which it seems they are, they would roll it out to all costumers which means more revenue + theyll get new costumers around world as well"
Close above 107 today :)
Bought more PYPL at the close. Bought a lot of stocks at the close actually. This selloff is a gift for those who believe in the future of growth stocks. I've been buying hand over fist. These rates can't continue to rise forever. They will come back down eventually.
EXPLOSION.Ahhhhh
And they’re talking about a possible correction in the market after this 20 point drop. This could go down another 25
all dips are blue light specials. go all in on pypl.
PayPal reached an all time high at 162.50
still moving in the right direction
Foreign markets up big
Sports betting in most of the country hasn’t opened up .Rec marajuana has yet to open up soon to be federally approved ...2 huge markets for fin tech !
Haven’t covered one share from my $177 short position LARGE
"From Reddit:The obvious $SQ counterpoint goes like this: iZettle was about to IPO with a 1.1bn valuation. PayPal overpaid to get into the space where they already tried two home grown solutions and failed. PayPal is the company beset on all sides, not Square, and this acquisition is defensive. Square has totally wrecked PYPL in this sphere (ever see PYPL's competition? The PayPal Here Triangle-dongle? Or see their registers in a store?)So this isn't a reason for Square to be worried, it's $PYPL admitting defeat and buying something at a big premium in the hopes of re-entering a market. It's a signal of failure on PYPL's part.On the other side of the competition, Venmo (another PYPL acquisition) had a huge lead but Square's home-grown Cash App has been #1 in finance apps for all of 2018 so far.PayPal has not had a home-grown success in years. Their reputation among small sellers is bad, and they would be wise to keep their name off of iZettle if they want it to be successful (like they did with Venmo for a long time). But iZettle on its own has no name recognition. It is PayPal, and not Square, fighting the uphill battle here.Finally, compare each company's services with the other and see who offers more. Does iZettle do payroll? Appointments and booking? Employee management? Or is it only a register? Square's ecosystem is very large and sticky in comparison to any of PayPal's + iZettle's offerings"
paypal will hit 95 next week
"In the last two days, investors try to push PYPL down further, but basically unable to. They all know that PYPL has a good earning report and very good outlook."
"Big news: PayPal to launch local wallet in China, a $20 trillion payment processing market. Huge upside expected for PYPL stock when this news digested."
I want to see $78........ You can do it!!
"Hunter, Bill, Randy, Anonymous, Dennis, Anthony and William, are you all enjoying your investment in $PYPL? $SQ will print $100 this week. I’m wondering what each of you have to say now at this point? Been saying this for 6 months. I’ll wait a few days to hear from you all"
"Best quarter ever... and usually PYPL trades upwards after earnings. The size of this beat was massive and hopefully they gave great guidance on their crypto strategy.Then again... look at AMD, MSFT, AAPL, QCOM... etc..."
"Rolling out another option for contactless payments in this period of social distancing, PayPal introduces the ability to use QR codes in its app to buy and sell goods in 28 markets around the world.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3575908-paypal-adds-qr-code-functionality-to-app?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=pypl-paypal-adds-qr-code-functionality-to-app&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3"
Hey stockadopealus how is that trade working out for you. Pulling out of PayPal and going into TEAM and GROW . Guess that's why you are laying low.
Happy new year
In at 220 and sold at 300. Back in at 230 for the LONG haul!!
"INDIA is an instant success for PYPL. It is no brainer to move in and umbrella the whole INDIA, which they already know PYPL.The result in INDIA will pop up in Jan earnings report. I need to emphasize VENMO which most of the millennials love it. PYPL needs to put more energy in it, because it will help the top line and bottom line for the next few years. I am talking about the future not in short term. PYPL has to spend more time and money in VENMO. IT MAY COME IN FORM OF CREDIT CARD ONE DAY IN THE FUTURE, WHO KNOWS."
Pre mkt is <$189... Regarding PYPL ER isn't this supposed to hit ~$195 at least?
"Hmmm, thinking of adding paypal to my portfolio if it drops into the 170's. Bad idea?"
"Dies anyone start to feel a bit eerie about this incredible meteoric rise of PYPL?Mirror the stnning rise of AMZN 2016 - 2020, FB 2014-2018.A voice inside me is starting to wispher ... s, s, se, sel, sel, sell ........ at least a bit of it."
"I love PYPL. I ALSO love SQ. Both are powerhouses, and I hope you all are invested in both. Nothing like have the best of both worlds:) GLTA!!!!"
LEGOOOOOOOOOOO BULLISH BABY
Keep in mind market makers manipulate the stock prices. They look at the volume in Option trading especially on Fridays. They'll stop payment to 265 Puts and 270 call options. Both will finish the day WORTHLESS. This is how they eat up our money.
"We all knew this was coming old news, the sky is falling the sky falling.I love how a story get blown out of proportion to fit someones narrative.PayPal is a great buy and if you not in now is the time to jump on board.."
Red? Seriously?
Now up 50 cents? huh...
Paypal will benefit from Black Friday. How?1. Black Friday means huge spending.2. Most of the sales will occur online as this is the safest way due to the pandemic.3. Online shopping specially on Black Friday is very sensitive to scam. Paypal offers protected purchase and it also hides your credit card infomation.4. Paypal will gain new users from reason 3.
In at 73.05
This is going to be a great week! Window of opportunity at these levels will close quickly. Love PYPL
PYPL is on its way to 100+ soon. Load up.
I hope the flaky investors jump ship and then miss out on the gains in the near future paypals just getting started
Oil prices will fall. There will be a purchase of this sector. Cyclical companies are now growing. Growth companies under pressure in this technology sector

"Jim Cramers ""up stocks"" Include PayPalSource:https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/the-up-stocks-cramers-mad-money-recap-thursday-11-19-20"
Vicious two days. Be done with it.
How do you like me now!
PYPL is not a stock that will jump 100% in a year. Not a stock that will go even 50% in a year.But sure is a stock that you will get a good average of 10-25% per year staying LONG. Sometimes it is better to go for the stocks with a higher chance of going 10-25% per year VS the ones that can go 100%-250% per year but with a low chance. This is why spread out your portfolio. STNE and PAGS are also good stocks to own. Not involved with trade wars. They are in Brazil.
"Absolutely no reason for drop, holding steady"
All market is down...its market effect. As soon as market recovers it will be easy +270
Short term profit takers are out today. Nothing has changed since it's earning growth of 33% yesterday.
"According to Two Sigma, crypto exchange is worth $2B alone, rocket"
"EBAY used to charge 8% of final price excluding shipping cost from sellers. Now it charges 10% of (final price with shipping cost). I used to find many good deals on EBAY, but rarely now. It is way less attractive ."
FINALLY
ContactlessThis is the Future Banking!The future for Inflation!Go PYPL!!!
Merrill Lynch raised it's price target on PYPL to $323
Reality is setting in after today’s euphoria. People really think the stimulus package would shore up the economy under the present crisis? How oblivious can investors be?
people just selling the news folks. this will be green tomorrow. have a look at AMD.
Cryptocurrency is the answer of the future economy?We never know but Paypal has to deal with it. SQ did take a risk today testing to buy bitcoins through SQ on its apps or mobile whatsoever. How’s about PYPL? I have no idea but it would be interesting.
Should be 85 bucks tomorrow
"Bitcoin surges to over $23,000. PYPL gonna roar again today!"
"Ladies and gentlemen,Today's Wall Street Journal discusses Fidelity National Information Services aquisition of Worldpay. What is very telling and a very potential windfall for PayPal is the fact that ""FIS is paying a handsome 23 times Worldpay's adjusted 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization."" Worldpay's enterprise value is roughly $43 billion. Why is this significant for PayPal? Paypal's enterprise value is a little over $111 BILLION. Worldpay's current stock price today has been trading between $106.31 - $107.41."
Honey will be an epic bonanza for PayPal going forward..........
Not sure I can handle this rotation out of stay-at-home stocks combined with a market that is acting irrationally. Have additional concerns about market's reaction to PYPL's upcoming earnings report regardless of how big of a beat it is.
"i think Apple buys Paypal for 120$ billion, 100$ per share"
Shorts shorts are in need of a change right now.
"So strong PYPL, maybe we will reach $95 after earnings this afternoon.."
"continued from my post, careful investors who can get past the hype will see that the value of PayPal’s BTC move is much more long-term than a brief market boost. Ultimately, it promises to turn the company into a central plank of our financial system.so here is the real reason paypal got into cryptocurrency.can square do this no!!!"
Tomorrow earnings from PayPal and Facebook after market close. should be exciting.
here we go fam....76 this week
"Wednesday is just around the corner. After hours reporting... I can not wait!!! Revenues beat and guidance even better with acquisitions,"
"Seems like its all good with a good outlook. Just my opinion.. I don't understand the drop, but I am currently happy with it. I purchased a few more shares."
Pypl and AAPL away over sold TBH
Love it. PayPal is already recovering.
What ever happened to shorty The Legend? Banks are trying to find him
No way this stock will fail. To reiterate its a buy around the 95-96 range as it is unlikely to go any lower than that.Double bottom pattern is forming.Now silver on the other hand.... That outlooks not so great.
"From adyen's website: PayPal is a global wallet for online payments. It has 173 million active customer accounts and is available in 203 markets and more than 100 currencies. Once registered with PayPal, customers can buy from multiple merchants without having to enter payment details again. Do some research, folks. The reported ""ditching"" by eBay is exaggerated if not false."
PayPal going cryto! $300 soon!!
HOLD
Chart setting up for a run to new highs.
pypl dips get bought. fed reserve will support and propel markets higher rather than allow for systemic collapse. valuations have no meaning when the fed has deemed the markets as paramount priority. rate cuts on the way. buy buy buy
Imagine if PYPL did a 4-1 split This thing would hit 400B market cap easy.
"When was the earnings date announced? Weeks ago? Why would it finally dump now right before earnings if outlook was bearish? Is this a shakeout before earnings, and price will soar after?The entire payment sector is down. SQ, V, MA. It's not just PYPL"
Paypal should buy FDC / Clover as well.
"earnings will be insane! attached to almost every online retailer including Amazon, eBay, wish..."
"Yawn 8% nothing if you are a PYPL LONG. This will go back in 80s this month, back in 85-90s next month. By April or May Say hi to 90s+100's by summer. End of Year 125 around Nothing to worry about LONGS."
Back in at $105. Liked the report but was waiting for a pullback to get back in.
"CAn""t believe the games the big players are playing with this stock."
Remember Paypal gave guidance for 2025. Planning to generate 40B CASH FLOW and 22% EPS growth untill 2025. For the longs no surprise
This very well could be down after hours and green tomorrow. We see that happen a lot.
PYPL reporting Wednesday. Will it jump to $260? Thumbs up  if you think so
PYPL on 
In my stock portfolio I own cyclicals and big tech names. All of the cyclicals in my portfolio are up today and the tech names are down. It’s nothing but a sector rotation. Nothing has changed fundamentally. The growth story is still with tech. Fund managers are just rebalancing their portfolios after the big gains in tech. This pause in the tech rally is a good thing. I recommend buying shares on these red days and get ready for the NEXT LEG UP 
this will be green come tomorrow!
PYPL is a cash generating machine....grossly oversold....|$105 by Friday.
250$+ todayStill bargain priceFinancial stocks are the new tech
wow whattttt
"IF PYPL opens tomorrow down, i'm a buyer, they will blow away the earnings on 7/29"
Many of the insider executives sold off at highs around $305 and the insiders are not yet making new purchases. Unfortunately I’m stuck with purchases at highs and wondering if they’ll ever make it back up even near those levels?
BUY MORE ON DIP 's the new RULE OF INVESTMENT THIS TIME....AS ECONOMY FOR SURE WILL RECOVER SOON....
I'm curious; What are the down sides to PYPL incorporating bit coin?Are they exposed to value fluctuations or is that risk on the consumer?PYPL has performed so amazingly since the split from eBay. EBAY has barely budged while PYPL has quadrupled.
Get ready to break out the rocket ship gifs tomorrow
Looks like it’s dropping with bitcoin!! Bitcoin is doing a 20% correction before running beyond $20K!
PayPal Rocks
"Excellent article on Seeking Alpha with regard to the moat PYPL has built using the virtuous circle strategy. This company can only get bigger and bigger. An excellent stock for a long term buy and hold and their are not a lot of these. A sleep well at night and in less than 5 years collect $200, Perfect in your IRA"
"Watch AMZN, if AMZN goes up,just keep buying PYPL."
See y'all at $300
Is it too late to buy this stock now?
Stop losses triggering with Ebay adding new payment processor. Let's see where we go from tomorrow. Would not be easy ride.
PYPL bought a large number of UBER shares too. NOT good stockpickers that PYPL.
Did pypl just miss er? I haven't seen any news yet
Bargain and the move to a different currency is all speculation and years down the line - wouldn't doubt seeing PayPal close to 400$ by end of next year
"Talk about share manipulation. I constantly hear about how banks/mutual funds/insiders/ ect. are manipulating the stock to go higher for us ""suckers"" but its strangly quiet when the stock price is manipulated the other direction. Case in point is today's Paypal price. Not much negative news for PayPal stock price to go down. In fact, the OPPOSITE. Uber up over 3.6% today. What about MecaroLibre? Glad you asked up over $6.50 dollars a share price. Great news right? Wrong, if you look at Paypal's stock price today youd surmise just the opposite. Terrible manipulation!"
Now its the mad dash back. Open the flood gates..People are so short sighted.Most of these events are brief. Look at last March!
Only small amounts AH/ Guess it can still go both ways. I expect UP.
"wedbush $140 target reiterated, move to $115 pre-earnings very likely then earnings will tell the story"
"Not one company who has reported great earnings has had their stonk rise, 100% go down, short accordingly"
"Me thinks DS needs to go on Mad Money, like he has always done after each ER in the past, and face questions and let us know where we are going. We deserve to know as shareholders. The quarter was fine so nothing to be hiding from. Just give us transparency. IMHO"
Like a morgue here today. We were all SURE a big rally was coming.
"pumped they beat, hoping the gains stick until morning. i am underwater on a PCS with Z after they were up 5% AH, only up 2% in PM, and slid down the entire day after a good earnings beat. fingers crossed for the longs playing options here!!"
PayPal has new partnership buy buy buy
It needs a total wash out to bring back interest. I'm guessing a sell off tomorrow A.M. to maybe 203 ish...then it will head back to 300 over the next couple months.As far as I can tell I'm the most EXPIERENCE on this board. I'm here to help
Paypal held up virtually the best today of any on the Nasdaq... Go Paypal... new highs ahead
Imagine where the stock price would be if DOW was up!
"Profit taking is going on, but I believe that new fresh money will flow in to take advantage of the strong economic and Janet will soothe the investors that every thing is fine, the equities is pricey but not overvalued."
Good news and a bright future = PayPal 
Trying to decide whether to buy more or not. Nasdaq and tech stocks are cratering. Starting to look like the run for tech stocks is over. Thoughts?
Insider buying huge at $305 a share and now lack of new purchases by insiders so down we continue to go!
We should start creeping back up from here
"Holding PYPL and not sure why it's not up more, safer to use than going outside."
Selling stuff to buy this.
Faang Bubble is still short Paypal.
$PYPL is where it's at. safe exposure to crypto. Volatility increases volume and larger profits no matter the cost of crypto
$85 by end of the week
Electric commerce use will increase as time goes on. You can not hand paper cash over the internet. Not safe to mail paper cash. It’s the same as touch soon dial cord attached phones to a wall.. and now a super computer phone in your hand that can go anywhere with you. Remember 8 tracks. Or black and white tv’s.. ??How’s about the first mobile phone. It was as big as a shoe. Technology is advanced and it will continue to. We can’t stop it. Change is inevitable. Apples watch is being used more and more. It’s convenient. That’s the key. Convenience is a necessity in this era. I do believe in time there will be driverless cars and taxes and computer glasses. It’s all a matter of time. Invest wisely.
Still too early to tell how PYPL will get today. Sign of heavy volume to push PYPL higher is really a good sign for next week. FANG recovers and even moves higher tells me that traders expect good numbers for the whole. At this moment I expect 91-93 on Thursday.
"It is about the year end now, so the P/S should be based on at least 2019 revenue of Honey. Let's assume Honey's revenue will grow 100% again for 2019 ( it is pretty easy from an internet company with $100M as base ), then the P/S should be 20; though it still looks pretty expensive, but with the huge number of merchants and consumer users from PayPal, for 2020, it is not too aggressive to assume Honey's revenue to grow 150% to $300M, and the forward P/S suddenly become much more reasonable 13.33. Considering Honey has been profitable and with no debt, the acquisition price is high but still making sense to me.And by the way, if you ever founded a startup, you would know how amazing it is to just go through Series B fund raising and the company can generate enough positive cash flow to be self-sufficient. Either Honey has an excellent economics or their management team is superior, or both. This is a quality deal."
pay your pal!
"Goes to $300, it's a strong buy guys"
"All aboard !! EPS announcement tomorrow after market closes. This baby is a solid pick for $125 and the acquisitions will be acretive and the internet is still growing in net revenue much faster than bricks and mortar and Pay Pal is in the best position to enjoy the lion's share of gain to their base sales. One of the best business finance models in practice today.Thus we have a high value with assurance of consistent performance because the moving parts are few compared to banking or insurance. Love it,"
"Whoever bought on the dip, good insight on your part and not given in to selling like some of these people that don't need to be in the market."
Where PYPL tomorrow?$300
PYPL $215 by the end of this week would be sweeeet.
Has anybody done the calculation on what PYPL's forward p/e ratio looks like with the new earnings data and forecasts?
who thinks this is up by days end tommorow? thumps up and down for down
"Now would be a good moment in time for Apple to buy this company and give ApplePay some wings. I'd keep the PayPal name, though..."
"Paypal is the coke a cola of online monetary transactions. Its not going to be easy to knock it out of its position. Even coke has down days. This is a gift, if you are willing to receive it."
PayPal (PYPL)Brokerage Firm: Atlantic Equities | Action: Upgrade | Ratings Change: Neutral » Overweight | Price Tgt: $315
"Nothing is wrong with Paypal nor is there an issue with Square, Payal is a in a different league than Square. Most likely what happened today was technical as it hit 80 and retreated. In the coming weeks it will retest the 80 dollar level and pass it by. Higher interest rates do not affect Paypal which has billions of dollars on it's balance sheets. It has been beating earnings since 2015."
this and Square jump 10% tomorrow.
The Hedgies had a nice profit and they sold to show some profit. It is fun to be on a stock that they love at the moment but we must remember they as a group are far worse than the small investor. They have to take profits where they can by quarters end to substantiate their 2 and 20 program which will go away. They cause what can be marketed as a rotation occasionally. The best thing you can do is buy the dips that they cause if the company is performing.I believe this company is performing very well and the new acquisitions are smoking the revenue growth.I will stand on my 125 call.
It is just going to go back to normal. 190. Shorties making a big panic fuss
listening to the cfo on cnbc only made me more confident. this split from eBay is a good thing not a bad thing
Let’s see $84 today
yahoo needs to fix their 1Y target price for this monster! should be 100 already! make it happen yahoo!
What is the good news that is making the stock surging during premarket?
Has there been any insider trading or what? I know many tech stocks are down but this is weird 2 days before earnings
Great buying opp!
"rocket, please"
"Is not funny that PayPal is going downward. What could be the problem, and is there hope of upward review?"
"Google, Amazon, or Facebook can acquire Paypal in the near future."
Another beautiful day in the PayPal neighborhood.
Love to see the stock holding. $200 coming to a theatre near you.
How will Crypto being outlawed in China affect PYPL? I am even more concerned that China creates its own state controlled Crypto for the Renambi ....that will force the US to do the same for the Dollar and Europe for the EURO...any thoughts?
Venmo is great for poker nights and fantasy football which 75% of football fans participate in
About time we got this show on the road! Bring on the analyst UPGRADES!
got 200 PYPL 90 calls expiring in 1.5 hours. paid 4 cents for them. Come on PYPL cross 90 !!!!
Up 30k and I don't want my profits to get shorted. Looking to sell tomorrow if things turn down. Can't catch a break here. going to have to watch closely.
Last time I keep stocks when report earnings
"I think someone on CNBC said this stock should hit $350. Can anyone confirm? Also, there is a new strain of the virus in NYC that I believe is spreading fast. Exactly who is confirming that this pandemic is over? WIth strains popping up seemingly on a weeky basis or so, do we really belive that we are out of the woods ?Tech stocks will continue to be required now and going forward. Me thinks this is an overblown selloff. MSFT, PYP, APPL which were roaring pre pandemic as well as during the pandemic will now suddenly stop functioning as required technology. Exactly how are value stocks immune from utilizing these stocks as they supposedly step up now? Much of this churn seems illogical, IMHO."
"Considering the potential for profit takers to leave after it rocketed up yesterday, it shows the strength of investor commitment in PayPal’s stellar future that it dropped less than a dollar from yesterday’s close!Next week onward and upward !"
We’ll past $90 this week. $100 by the end of the month.
"Something interesting to note: the management didn't hype up any of the recent major developments, i.e. with the iZettle acquisition. They provided a general overview of the overall development. Could this be because they are looking for an opportunity for buybacks?"
"ARK just sold 893,007 shares of $PYPL(I think ARK wanted to manupilate the market as last week telling market will crash, then they started to buy cheap. Now they see that market really crashing and they started to sell what they bought 1 day ago)$ACIC $PYPL $TSLA $SENS $BNGO $PACB $NDRA"
"Buying more here Buffet could add more, back to $50 should be stronger than $PAGS , Like $PYPL"
"Once Paypal puts iZettle to the metal ( once the settlement is complete ) Paypal will soar leaving you Squares Jerry, behind in the dust "
The higher the bitcoin the higher PayPal runs!! $300-$500!! They predict bitcoin can blow to $400K passing the predicted $100K on one Kitco interview!!!
The best acquisition for PYPL would be IIIV who guides FY19 adj eps of between .79-.81c whereas SQ projects FY18 between .39-.41 adj eps.
"New all-time high pre-market. Toot, toot!!"
It's bouncing.. Looks like people are realizing Paypal is A BANK...so higher rates ain't all that bad.
"Re-testing Friday's lows of $224. Might not go all the way down there, but maybe."
So what’s the cause of this sell off?
Who thinks this will open higher tomorrow?
"For PYPL, it's China, folks....Thursday's talks in Washington is what's hanging in the balance, regarding market sentiment towards this name......retaliation towards US companies that are in China is the market fear pressuring this stock....PYPL just made a big investment in China....that is at risk, hence the fall to 99.......the results of the TALKS, a truce, anything good will propel PYPL back to 105, I hope.....Disclosure: Long at 103.80"
"PYPL revenues set to double in the next three years so why the sell off. I going to be a buyer here - wanted to buy before but just wouldn't dip enough to make a good entry point. Down a good 10%, that's good for me - thank you all for selling! No PYPL doesn't speculate on Crypto coins and that's good. I mean they should pay attention to their core business and grow it. I wouldn't want to own any business that speculates with cash on hand and cash flow - that belongs to investors in this space. Want to speculate in Crypto go get your own digital wallet and knock yourself out. shareholder money belongs to all on board not to just a few."
Long term buy and hold
wake up paypal you are better than this
SQ to 100 before PPYL
"Whilst PayPal is back to where it was 3 weeks ago, it should make up the lost ground during the run up to earnings, or in the very least during a pop at the ER. SQ on the other hand is back to where it was 8 weeks ago and in all likelihood will struggle from this level."
"I wonder if PYPL""s earnings has leaked out, must be good"
5000 shares at $32 per. PYPL make me a rich man. Thinking of taking it all off table but nothing but good news and great guidance has me sitting tight
its time to buy some more adding pypl and palo alto to the portfolio today holding long
Cramer said last night PYPL should go to $100
$130 here we come!
"Once market sentiment improves, this stock will be back over $90. Need to get over Fed speculation. Feds will raise rates if inflation increase. Let's not lose our minds. Economy is strong and ill handle 3-4 hikes over the next 15 months. China Trade wars will continue to rage on for another few months. IF GOP retains control of the house and senate, China will give in."
PayPal reached an all time high at 127.51
"This is a churn at these prices. We can leave some room to run, $400 by summer!!!! "
"Guys, do you think its a good investment for the next 2 yrs?"
Will buy more tomorrow on any dip ...
"Today is the bottom day since PYPL has officially announce its estimate of only 1% impact on Q1 revenue from virus, and confirmed the full year guidance to remain the same. The current price is huge huge overreaction, obviously."
"Buying IIIV, guidance FY19 ady eps is .79-.81c whereas SQ guided FY18 adj eps to .39-.41"
"Yeah, Ark bought a big chunk between $250 - $280 just 2 weeks ago, then sold 1/3 of PYPL holding on Friday. Wood is a real ""expert"" or eggspert."
"If you are interested in PayPal, you should watch this recent interview with the CEO. Very interesting to see him pretty much give away that PayPal was buying back shares during the recent drop =) He also talks about Amazon Pay, eBay, cryptos and the blockchain starting at 21:10 https://youtu.be/-RqXiId-u4k?t=21m10s"
"Hello everyone, If you want a real ROI look at the new player in town, HMBL! Now is the time to jump on board, they just released their App on Friday that will give PayPal a run for their money (seriously). They will also be going onto the Nasdaq by years end."
Great buying opportunity today!
"Wow, increasing buyback to $10 billion."
Cramer gave it a buy!
"LOL Win, Loss, Win, Loss, this is just a few of the stocks I have watched that beat and yet got beat up. Guess tide is turning and puts are the way to go now. Or maybe this turns around after conference call and changes things up. Just my opinion, good luck all."
All this negative talk? Yet up $3+.
PYPL down 103% MORE than other FinTech because big boys want to squeeze you out and buy in because digital payment is growing... regardless and PYPL is most well positioned than anyone else. Hey? Isn’t PYPL also inter twined already with WhatsApp and its push into India payment space?
$PYPL Initiated by Sanford Bernstein Outperform USD 297 Reiterated by Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 229 » USD 297 Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 235 » USD 300
Morgan Stanley expected a EPS of $0.94....so that's a huge miss.Hence tanking
Stock should be at $100. Undervalued. But will get there shortly.
"There you go, the huge UPS beat on earnings as demand for online goods increases at astonishing rates.Translation, PYPL is slamming it."
"This is painful, my portfolio has been wiped 25% in a matter of a couple weeks with great stocks. Hoping for a better day on Monday, Longs. We will recover , buy when the market is fearful ! $APPL $TSLA $AVGO $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA $PYPL $SQ $BABA"
"Another important announcement: PayPal has 15 billion in cash now. They expect to spend 1~3 billion per year on Mergers & Acquisitions. And even better, about 40 to 50% of the free cash will be used for buy backs!"
$300 end of week
First ever @jack tweet being sold as NFT on... you guessed it... Etherium! Just so happens that PayPal lets you own/invest in Ether that drives the Etherium blockchain. NFTs are going to become the basecall cards of the future.https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/97459/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-mints-the-first-ever-published-tweet-on-ethereum-service-cent
"This is a broad uptrend. It is a time to jump in, not out!!!"
this is a huge opportunity for paypal:https://seekingalpha.com/news/3389596-paypal-fills-void-sports-betting-payment-processing?dr=1#email_link
partnering with Walmart is more impactful than partnering with Amazon because of customer volume where PYPL is applicable.
It will be red in AM my calls expiring Friday will be worthless - it is such a gamble playing through earnings-it really doesn’t matter if they beat earnings or not you just never know what’s gonna happen!￼￼
An upgraded sound like an opposite..I am holding it and SQ!
Where are the buyers?
does anyone recall what happened just 3 months ago when they reported good earnings?
"Here comes inflation and taxes, what could go wrong?"
"Bought some yesterday. Now, let's go to $250 - $300. This earns more than NVDA."
"Isn’t there a saying that, what goes up, must come down, and what goes down must go up? I think it was first spoken in 1929...."
Would like to buy but with the 10 yr pushing to go above 1.5% it does not bode well for teck stocks.....anyone adding here??
"Two notes this morning:PayPal reinitiated with an Outperform with $297 price target at BernsteinPayPal price target raised to $297 from $229 at Morgan Stanley, overweight"
"IPNFF Popped 20%, you know I know about my AR stocks, big potential here"
And UP it is
All the market is downDon't believe short sellers
"I own a large ebay business, paypal kept $1000 in fees from me from refunds in 2020 so far since they no longer refund fees on cancelled orders. I hate them and want to get rid of them as soon as I can, but I guess that's good income from them in the near term."
PYPL will be 500 a share by next year. Book it.
When comparing SQ and PYPL..traders think PYPL is a better investment!
calm down it will be back up in a month
fire sale today!
"PYPL ceo just sold 30,000 shares at 112. hmmmm."
"$SQ and $PYPL are down today because FB launched it’s payment solution. This is a background noise. I’m long both payment companies - we will be fine, as it would be insane to trust your  and payment transactions to FB  GLTL"
"sorry guys, i just bought......thats probably why it is going down "
Minimal movement in AH. That’s a good sign. Steady is always nice.
shorts are getting crushed and discarded like a 1987 compact disc.
Once we take out the 52 week high the stock will fly.
"Honestly, I'm rooting for both pypl and sq, competition is good for the consumer and innovation. I am long PYPL."
"added 100 more shares at the open, paypal is still to cheap"
If you are using a Level II streamer just keep an eye on the GSCO exchange . It will tell you where a stock is headed.
up 6%??
Cramer said last night SQ has banking!doesn't PYPL have banking too?GO PYPL!!!
Ark bought ~700K shares today. Woah
Too late to get in at 91+?
Thank you CPAK for undermining or Democracyand causing stock sell off. We just love Jared & Invanka
Can this thing actually fall 1% ever. Haha let's see on the close
Does anyone think EBay is a snake for making this announcement on the eve of PayPal earning release ???
e-transactions market is going to grow a lot in 2018 and PayPal is the major player there
I’d be surprised if this isn’t down 5% in the after hours. It doesn’t matter if they beat or not. I’d be shocked if this wasn’t the case.Enjoy!!!
This stock is a must have viruse or no virus. its so much more convenient to use than visa
PayPal reached an all time high at 222.79
Fidelity Investments is showing PYPL bought back 5.3Million shares
"Also the crypto trades are looking good forecast value to PayPal, At the moment it is only for US customers(So think when they expand the service to the rest of the world -Even more value). https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypals-cryptocurrency-partner-sees-500-085111345.html"
"After an evening of scratching my head and wondering what the problem is with a beat on EPS and revenue coupled with a strong outlook I surmise some momentum traders have paniced and hit the sell button. Today looks more encouraging to me as the economy in general looks excellent. Earnings drive share price and they were excellent with very strong growth. I really believe that the stock will not be punished when the professionals step in today and the next several days. Trump may have placed the final Trump card by coming to an agreement with the EU to explore building a zero plan on tarrifs and subsidies. This has the potential to ignite the market out of this channel trade environment. Visa, Square, Master Card, COF, BAC all should do fine in this situation. There is no zero sum gain between these strong companies"
Stock was upgraded with a target of $171. They should have said sell lol. Good buying opportunity in a few days under $140.
Someone please explain. Why is the PYPL going down after beating earnings?
I don't like buying stocks before earnings but really tempted on this one.
PTON green today and PYPL red? Scam market
"If PayPal can become a big player in sports gambling, watch out, it could triple. But don't know if that will happen yet."
Facebook is going to be trusted with a currency???? How many security breaches have they had in the past? LMAO
Pain. What a bombshell they just dropped during the conference call.
120-200 next year
How long until $pypl overtakes $v market cap? Fintech heavyweights.
"did any of you watched Bloomberg last night?Analyst said the Bitcoin evaluation would be 400,000because of high demand and very limited availability.Go PYPL!!!"
Ebay announcing to work with another payment company
PayPal had conference yesterday stating the would be willing to be bought out. Najarions also mentioned unusual activity in options. PayPal CEO has interview tonight with Cramer. And PayPal has another conference tomorrow. Just relaying info. Also Kudlow accepted job at Whitehouse today.
"if you guys researched any, this tech sell off is due to hedge funds shifting money to non tech's. either way I'm holding because tech is the future, and we are heading to the future marty!"
"Explain to me how their extremely profitable guidance was less than 2% from analysts’ expectations, yet we’re now down 7%! Yes, now I AM adding."
This is the one you should hold!!! It is staging to break out soon!!!
When bitcoin tanks....what happens to PayPal?
pop to 80 after conference call
Why is this stock down.
Piercing pattern bouncing off downtrend line today. Heading to 254 eow
Very oversold at these levels. When you look at this company its future cash flows are 8 times what they currently are. This is a no brainer. This will go back to 300 and then firmly take it out. The sky is the limit for this juggernaut.
"The ""sell off"" notwithstanding, Paypal is well on its way to become one of the main fin techs along with Mastercard and Visa....All the fintechs are good buys and I expect them to remain so for the future but I do expect PYPL at some time to announce that they will be paying a dividend"
I love how revenue was missed slightly and investors lost it but the fact that this year they've added the most new accounts ever goes to show that the growth is far from over. EPS was even revised time after time upward and they STILL beat it yet stock drops. Just can't stop shaking my head here.
It is very ridiculous how a stock goes up and comes down so fast in a mater of days. 2 weeks ago 300 plus today almost a $75.00 dollar haircut from 2 weeks ago. This is what is called market manipulation. Hedge Funds bringing this back down just so they can run it back up again to 350. Its legal so why not. Just hold and it will run back in no time.
Pypl upgrades daily square on the other hand square ...up daily...should invest in both!!
"Just finished the conference call .. ""we understand this is our moment and we plan to capitalize on it"". Lets see why this company will continue to grow: announced partnership deal with CVS to roll out QR codes in their digital wallet (PayPal & Venmo) to complete purchases. Should be in all stores by years end. There is a huge shift towards digital payments. More industries are moving to the digital economy. Venmo will be rolling out new features such as business profiles, direct deposit, credit cards, and QR codes. I am young myself and I can tell you that everyone I know uses Venmo to pay each other rather than cash. They also mentioned that the use of e-commerce is still up big in areas where shelter in place orders have relaxed. Finally, they are seeing huge growth by being used on Shopify and Etsy's platforms. Short term price movement does not matter. Buy the dips and hold for years."
Buy a company or pay us some dividends
Picked up 280 more at 87.70
upgrade to $300 on ER day!!
That that AH Yahoo newsfeed suggests that PayPal is now a strong buyout candidate in the future.... wonder where they got that impression and possible suitors are? Maybe Visa? Are they big enough to buy PayPal?
added at 242.92 to my 236.50 shares from last week.
"at this price, adding more is an easy decision."
Let's get to 80 today. 85 next week. 90 the week after. ER 100!
"A couple of months ago I mentioned that it was only a matter of time before PayPal launches in Pakistan. It is an ideal base for PayPal to reach the next 200 million customers, especially considering the heavy role of remittances in that country. And now the following news came out: https://marketrealist.com/2018/10/is-paypal-set-to-launch-in-pakistan?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo"
"PayPal’s third quarter was one of the strongest in our history. Our growth reinforces the essential role we play inour customers’ daily lives during this pandemic. Going forward, we are investing to create the most compelling and expansive digital wallet that embraces all forms of digital currencies and payments, and operates seamlessly in both"
$85 will become the new support
PayPal reached an all time high at 211.98
"Im thinking the funds are re-balancing the big gainers, stimulus deal is uncertain still so if they re-balance now they will be ready to jump as soon as they know to add to the more volatile sectors."
Bought more at 284.00
"Just had a blow-out quarter, next quarter will be even better!"
paypal calls have made me a good amount this is a 300 plus stock all day look at there earnings and revenue it's stellar if you bought in the dip or before you will be happy
anyone buying PYPL at these prices?
Seems to be resistance around $80. Wait for a breakout after that. That’s exactly what happened last time it broke $80.
"My question is this, is PayPal now becoming a BITCOIN PLAY? If so then that could fuel crazy speculation in this stock "
Good time to add some stocks today
This is a $100 stock. Buy it now or miss out.
"I agree with PYPL's COO that PYPL should not monetize VENMO now, just add more value in it for another year, until the millennials have a feeling they can not live with out VENMO, which I think that day will come soon."
If this gets down to the $250s range I'll buy more but I doubt it makes it below the $260s this week unless tech slides hard.
"Under $183 is an awesome price for Paypal....hold one month, make some decent profit! Once we get past today, a lot of the big money that sat out the election will start to get back into the market."
"PYPL showing some strength , maybe the bottom is in. Was way oversold"
270$ easily EOD
gifts for all
Friday is always a tough day....I see Pypl bottoming around 230-240 range...hate to say but on a down turn i see that coming....We have not got buyers come in yet....May be Monday....hopefully....Nasdaq is due for a big rebound....a big one.
So will Covid19 impact PYPL another way it will impact Visa/MasterCard? Can anyone explain the difference?
Morgan Stanley comes out with great news for PayPal versus the other payment options. The news coming from the Christmas spending is robust. All around the thought is PayPal is poised for a new breakout and a new high. So what does PayPal do today? See red. Well after Feb. 1st all bets are off. This may be the last time investors have to get PayPal under $91.
Get ready for the after hours crash......
I do not use PayPal - why should I? Never had a reason to - I am actually invested in square before its rise- liked the management philosophy and players- What does anyone know about the guys at the top of Pay Pal food chain?
"This is a beast, just bought some crypto and its easy and quick, not like other exchanges.. Wait till the college kids get their money and buy crypto, this is above $400"
I'm in
PYPL smashed earnings!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"Ok Danny boy, party time is over. Let’s get a move on it and get the stock moving up. No more having the stock price sitting there like a stuff dog. Start executing! That’s why WE (Shareholders) pay you the big bucks. Entiendes?"
US Stock market is in serious trouble of rising. Root cause is clear.
herd mentality
3:58pm Weds. Just jumped up to $213.82 which is $1.99 shy of $215.81 ATH.PERHAPS After Hours it'll make a new High or Opening Tomorrow???
Many Many times ...Hold and Wait
$300 plus in a few days. This is a gift here
"can someone educate me on what roll P/E plays any.ore if any at all, even looking at forward earnings... 63 and there is still people out there buying? dont get me wrong great company and opertunity for growth but a p/e of 63 to me is just wild"
The bid on the August 9 $112 calls is at $1.21. That's a little more than 1% for holding the shares nine days. I've favored writing calls on PYPL since before the ER. It looks to me like the rally has stalled and I don't see a catalyst for a further move higher.
Haven’t been here in a while. Is Komol still terrorizing folks? PayPal will indeed hit $100 soon!!! Taking longer than expected but it’ll happen. Please check out $TEUMIt’s going to explode. Stay tune
99% are long PYPL. No short squeeze hopes here. Oh dear.
ARK bought more PYPL today!
Too many days red
charts show fintech rolling over. be careful buying here. I say to sell upside calls against positions to manage risk or pick up some September puts. mho
why would the discount brokers cut online trade commissions to zero? because the banks require more baggies to buy the banks HUGE inventory of long positions. think about it.
Anyone a clue as to why it dropped $6 a share on open ? I have seen nothing critical...
50 dma at 115.06 has been violated. 107 must hold. pypl rarely trades below the 50dma. oh dear.
My price target for this dog is $20 by 2020.
"$PYPL TULIP MANIA BUBBLE is up by 350% in the last 4 years, but the company revenues and earnings were higher in 2016. Today Paypal stock is trading as PONZI SCHEME at P/E=100."
Seems to be mirroring the market.
Are any of you folks on this PayPal Message Board using PayPal's pay app Venmo? If not you better jump on!
time to fully support Square (SQ) ..... the clear winner and Master of PYPL .... DEAL WITH IT !! HAHAHA
first data / clover next on the shopping list?
$249+ LOL 
Targeting 206 - 210. What are the odds that the entire market is down?
you dont trade $pypl
"Looks like one of the most gorgeous, stunning, enlightening double top $249 formations I’ve ever seen in my illustrious career"
Crypto access is a real step towards crypto being a viable daily currency. PayPal will make a killing off micro-transactions
Paypal to split to 3
We seem to be lagging a bit?
"It does not look good for the new year particularly tech sector., I think it is safe to hide behind AAPL with low PE and growth ecosystem rate is still expanding at least 20-25 %."
fasten your seat belt!
PYPL now in correction mode down more than 10%———next up is bear  market 20%
Hey Congress people. This is America. The America you created by sticking your heads in the sand and ignoring the voice of the people. You made this protest. Your job is to listen to the people. Audit these discrepancies in voting and make things right!
To hight to buy rn?
Anyone hear a rumor of a PYPL earnings restatement?
Will wait for the market to crash before I load up on Paypal. There appears to be a lot of panicking in the market due to covid-19 not being under control (more deaths and businesses shutting down) and no more stimulus until next year (if any).
"If this follows the trend, it will end the day tomorrow at 182.__"
"silver to gold ratio is now 90.20. this is a three decade high. anyone in stocks, especially stocks that are lightyears from book value ie pypl, and not exposed to silver is clearly out of the ""buy low and sell high"" paradigm."
Lol we’re already above $80. Let’s finish in green
"can someone tell me why we hit 121,3 or whatever and then came back down to 119,... immediately? any reason for this?"
A solid MISS for PYPL on tap. Banksters know this is their last chance to get out around 100. Ask Jim Bears Sterns Cramer.
I think it’s time to get into this thing now. I’ve been waiting on the sidelines for too long hoping SQ can catch up.
targets vary between $200 and $290
Buy Sq stocks its always outperforming PYPL
Buying opportunity!!!!
"Let me tell you whoever bought PYPL yesterday when it was down $.60, already a winner. PYPL is making money left and right by VENMO. The big fish is SWIFT financial for small business loan is exploding, that will push 3rd Q earnings through the roof. The interest rate in small business loan is almost like shark loan rate. That is why the Oct call option is just like big pool of the bettors."
"For all you investors that are upset that Square is out performing PYPL, remember that PYPL is UP over 30% this year. PYPL and Square are two different companies. One makes money and the other might make money someday. Guess which is which. I'm old enough to remember the ""Dot.com"" era when it was all about the ""burn"" rate. Then it collapsed. Square still needs to obtain critical mass before the next recession. Otherwise it becomes a ""penny"" stock."
Should go over $82.00
$108 and life is great. Go PYPL. :))
Ever tried trading WalMart gift cards for food stamps? This is why PYPL is beyond it's peak.
"ive been in since sept 2015 @$33, didnt go anywhere for 2 years.at the time $40 was the base. Now its forming a new base at $100im neutral for awhile, but catalysts are forming, and tomorrow could be interesting"
Earnings... Nov 2 or Oct 21?
PayPUKE $309 or $230? ROTFLMAO 
"Brought at 70, selling at 700, long and strong"
"This will make a material difference in future earnings. Unfortunately, this will be down another 10-15% over next month or two until pypl announces new partnerships and services"
Will market turmoil outweigh strong earnings
Took forever to break $80....... Let's close above $80!!
is it ok to buy overpriced stocks again?
"Already 2.6 mil. shares change hand, it tells me that the shorts try to stop the break out which I think it wii fail eventually. When the longs gathering the force again it will nudge PYPL higher. It is symbolic of touch new high, pull back and marching on again."
"Venmo vs CASH AppI've looked myself, but I just want to verify my eyes aren't playing tricks on me.Is it true that Venmo produced $450,000,000 in annual revenue where as SQ's Cash App is on pace to produce $2 Billion plus annual revenue? This is quite an astronomical difference if true."

Dip buyers buying high. 95 on the way....
PYPL got upgraded to $300 ... yeehaw!!LINK##: https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/21/paypal-stock-could-surge-23-to-300-on-its-cryptocu/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article
That's overdoing a conference call. Paypal had miserable results and acquisitions and they just lapped it up. People are going to lose jobs and this company will go out of business. enjoy the 5 minutes of fame loll
How does India's PayTM square up against PayPal? Buffet is obviously a smart guy; why wouldn't he invest in PYPL instead of PayTM?
Love “Investor Day” when the stock falls $25 in a minute and loses $20b of investors money  PayPuke is now in correction territory
EBAY now has another payment processor.
sure is a lot of crying going on at the SQ camp...HAHAHAHAHAHA
Don't sleep on LOOM crypto currency. .048 currently and primed for a 10x run up. Lock and load
This is overreaction stick with it u will be rewarded.
$80 so close I can taste it!
simple reason this isn't up with the rest today. look at the chart. it'll go either way and no one knows which. smart investors are staying clear for now
why is this down so much? Did trump put tarriffs on all paypal transaction in China?
Why would anyone short this stock? Def a long term stock.
should we wait for earnings call or??
https://www.barrons.com/articles/paypal-can-gain-nearly-60-fund-manager-51549998522?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooAmazing read! target price is a lot higher than I thought !! future is really bright for PayPal! Lets see this stock grow : )
How to use paypal to maximize credit card rewards AND build business/personal credit: paypal cash balances should be immediately moved to bank account so that all expenses are paid by your rewards credit card. (chase is one of the very best).
Why is it taking ?
Lol downgrade. Someone wants cheap shares!!!

PYPL will blow the numbers away!!! $95.00 ...soon ...very soon!!!
Shorts covered. Time to get the party started kiddies
PYPL and the private fed reserve bank are buying PYPL shares. without the bailouts PYPL would be in the teens.
"very healthy pull back,I am looking at some of the slope of S&P, which is very steep. I will place the bet on only the stock that will have growth rate at least 12 %,and sustain the rate for the next 3 years. I see the finance, health care and some tech like FB, GOOG. I think fluctuation is good for the stocks because you can get good stock at the cheaper price. As long as the economy is still intact, I don't worry much, at least another year."
Yes!!! Finally Square is now up $2 and higher than PayPUKE it was recently $100 lower

$PYPL Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 215 » USD 230
Just bought more PYPL today. I also think they are close to buying another company before they report earnings. Any thoughts
MOST UNDERVALUED and UNDERBOUGHT stocks in the Universe: $AMZN $NVDA $AMD $SQ $SHOP $MU $AMAT $ROKU $TWLO $CRM $TWTR $ADBE $PYPL $NFLX These BARGAINS must RISE by 60-90%.
"Another pump on fox business today. Jamie from JPM thinks 16 PE is fair. Down from 18 to 21. Netflix, nvidia, are rising with high PE. Is this a Visa or amex?"
"NASDAQ 100,PYPL and ADBE are two dogs in there today.LOL. I bet you that it will be temporary. Whoever thinks these two stocks are SOLD will be disappointed. Without the tax cut the earnings growth is around 40 and 50% respectively."
"look up the 5 year chart ""Price Index: Purchasing Power of the Consumer Dollar in U.S. City Average, All Urban Consumers""what is that about stagflation again? silver and gold are going to go straight up in terms of fake reserve debt notes."

"PayPal officially holds a wholly-owned stake in a payment company in China,"
PYPL going to 52 week lows soon..Sell now and buy it back around 60 where shares will be fairly valued.
Going from $309 to $177 in a month PayPUKE  Not too shabby
"I sold out at 88, sheesh. Congrats to u guys. Salute!"
People following the investor presentation? Something they said?
No buy till $80
strong open
The crypto pump is about over...
We said GOODbye to POS PYPL the same say the EO decided to be another HOWARD SCHULTZ political foolBoth Schultz and PyPl's leader forget there are Christians who buy COULD buy their products.If they believe in Alimentary Canal exploring with friends and gerbils KEEP IT TO THEMSELVES..
This is miserable dumping. Feeding on itself. Just getting fried.
Earnings must of leaked out. PYPL up up
"It’s important to note that the pathetic people in here bashing PayPal fall into 2 categories: 1.) those who missed the early buy-in opportunities and are jealous 2.) the short sellers who are more often wrong than right, and try to scare people out. Either way, they offer no good advice!"
Shorting this to $50 ... the hype is over guys. get out of tech
Maybe it’s time to study on other stocks rather than PYPL which is going to be bought out soon. Sigh. I hate Studies haha
Anyone here think Paypal will be the go-to for krypto currency?
"$302? Was that a real print? Missed it. I see it’s down around $10 from there. Sometimes Yahoo has bad quotes. That has to be a bad quote, right?"
based on the options the MM will definitely want this on the north side of 91 by Friday still. They will make a ton off the 88 and 91 puts.
Over reaction was when the stock price went from $25.00 to $85.00 for no reason.
another tiny volume up day...pypl distribution continues
Just got off the phone with Paypal since my account isn't working. Per the recording they are banned from Business from June 20th (today is the 19th and they are shut down already) to June 25th. No business can be transacted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone know what is going on? Perhaps a good time to by option betting the stock will tank before the real news gets out????
You want to own this stock for the long term. Cest tout
"Now it is a new chapter, a lot of small cap got wipe out what was gained since 2017. Psychological changes after night, only selected sector and most of the big cap will be the winner in the future. Now 2018, the gain will be limited, you will not see fluctuated computer sales in the near future. The investors will go back to the basic and value stock again, because the ""FEAR "" will cause the slow trade. The trend will change over the near term even the economic is still very strong."
I just step in again at this price. I have confidence that PYPL will hit 85 this week.
I believe PYPL CEO will be on Cramer tonight
Thanks for those selling for letting me to buy under $300
The committee to re-elect the president is rumored to be refusing to accept PayPal for donations.......
Thank you Robinhooders for participating in the stock market. Now that you're done chasing - and probably out of the market - long-term investors can take a deep breath and go back to seeking good stocks at attractive prices.
in the past two days pypl trading volume has been more than twice the total number of shares shorted. this is not a short squeeze. this is a distributive rally by the banks looking to exit pypl above 100. think about it.
"PayPal says ""follow the instructions"" - supply them with your personal information, they know what's best for you."
"Another red day, any reason why, or is it down just because NAS is red again."
"KOMOL: I think me exit PayPal. It not hit me target and it disappoint. 3 hours later... PayPal really surprise that it hold strong. After listening to crammer cus I am a sheep donkey, me think that I get back in PayPal on Monday.) Monday comes....Oh wow. It only go up .50. Me think that it a weak stock. Me think it should go up $1.50 so for now me leave. Come back and check on FridayConclusion: KOMOL is a moron."
PayPal is down 4.92% to 185.45
Just saw PYPL published on the daily alert watchlist at (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)

"PYPL should be 230-250 eow ,"
PayPal attempting to get back to even today.
"The threat from Apple Pay to PayPal has been exaggerated to keep PYPL share price under $40. But with the stalled adoption rate of ApplePay in past two quarters at the storefront, the progress that the ApplePay can make even after Mac user can use Apple Pay to pay for the online purchase will be very limited, because the user base is already the small existing Apple Pay users. PayPal's dominance will main or even grow because the trend of online shopping has been outgrowing the offline ones, so the $40 resistance will become support this time. Long PYPL!"
Great earnings PYPL could get back to $192 where it was this morning lol
whats going on with this stock
"An extremely modest rise in 30-year mortgage rates has prompted a sudden collapse in mortgage applications for refinancings.Overall, mortgage applications tumbled 7.3% last week and are down over 15% in the last three weeks - the worst drop since January 2016..."
Stock down around 15% in 4 days. Such a ponzi market. Time to sell and short. Zero risk
Drip.....drop....
SQ just hit $100.
Thinking of investing... But who among here have used Venmo? And do you like it more than Zelle? Thank you!
"Let Democrat shuts down the government, let them do it. We will wipe them out from the Senate and the House in November, it is only ten months to go, and wholesales dump them again in the next two years.

After hours 9 % the only way is up !
What a gift
FB is buying PayPal for 250 billion
SQ to partner with eBay...
SQUARE already has bitcoin
Buy more and talk less!
I had 2 choices to make.purchase PYPL stocks orpurchase SQ stocks.I've chosen PYPL big mistake.
SQ is up 96% over the past 6 month while PYPL has been running in mud and paid 2.2B for 130M in revenues. SQ will win the race. What else does PYPL have in their ecosystem?
93 is just a number!
Earnings call 14 day$$$$$$
SHOP announced great earnings this morning. I would imagine most store accept PYPL??And they captured the Millennials who use venmo!!Holding long and strong!
"PYPL is not a vaccine stock. It is an electronic payment stock. Today's move was sheer madness. The holiday season will see this equity soar. Hard currency is slowly disappearing. Following the street is ridiculous. Stay calm, this stock will be just fine."
"Job layoffs surge 35% to highest level to start a year in a decadeJob layoffs hit 190,410 in the first quarter, a 35.6 percent increase over the previous year and the worst first quarter since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas."
"I'm bullish about SYF below 30. Got hit twice by the WMT news. SYF still has partnerships w/ $AMZN $PYPL. The price is currently below Buffet's avg. He owns 20.8 million shares!Not to mention that SYF increased its dividend 40%, from .15 to .21.Calls are not that expensive either. I'm holding a few 9/21 $30 calls"
Is a matter of time before pypl gets scooped up
What happened here?
What a JOKE! God Dam worthless Pyramid Scheme is getting PUMPED Parabolically every single day! It looks like $PYPL Management is PUMPING this Worthless Scheme for the personal gains of its insiders and related parties! Bitcoin's fair value is $0 and it will FALL to $0!

"Should I close my position now, or still hold? Seems like it will clean up my profits?"
"I would think that PayPal has a lot of cash parked overseas and the repatriation would help PayPal quite a bit, does anyone have any insights on this?"
PayPal has such a huge run. Time to close our position and celebrate!!
Buying more in the AM.
"Billions spent buying companies (for their product offerings), 2 Billion stock buyback remains to be completed (as far as we know), new 10 Billion stock buybacks planned, holidays approaching, etc. and stock price doesn't grow, even a modest stock price increase doesn't hold, stock price decreases while every other competitor price increases. Any ideas why our investment isn’t gaining in value? Are PYPL gains being taken by high speed trading, PYPL have jaded brokers, PYPL can't integrate new software/hardware purchases into a cohesive product offering, innovation juices gone, PYPL waiting around for a reason to have a massive stock price drop... Any ideas, guesses, etc.?"
@ChuckThanks for the homework!............. Genius...........
PYPL $220 by January weeeee. Buying some more soon. Just waiting to see if tomorrow is in the red again & I’m hopping in.

I think PayPal will drop $20+ today minimum
I love this stock! PYPL forever!
Let’s take a step back and ask are selfs the question. Who actually uses EBay? It’s an old dinosaur that has failed to reinvent itself over the past couple of years. Shorts jump off the ship and let the longs gobble up your shares!!
"$PYPL Revenue has grown barely by 3% from 2019 to 2020, but the stock price got PUMPED by at least 150%... In the US Stock Market 3% revenue growth is being translated into 150% Market Value PUMPING???What a MEGA BUBBLE!"

This action is so weak. Expected so much more. Better get a jump tomorrow.
LETS GO!!!
Venmo > Cashapp
Stop harping on a 1 cent beat and expecting a jump. Its all about outlook and it was weaker than what the run-up justified. An average report at best and it needs a market correction. This is an expensive stock considering how many competitors are out there.
What time do they release it?

Thumbs up if you use the new black background and like it.
It's obvious someone leaked earnings in advanced. The gain today is what tomorrow should have been.
The SCRIPT is written by some big boys is exactly as I guess. It hit high then pull back. I think PYPL will hit new high everyday this week. BREAK OUT !

Anyone else pick up the fact big buys came in yesterday on the chart...
I must say I think that TSNP is worth buying and getting in on the bottom floor . I can buy a heck of a lot of shares for next to nothing and hold for along time to come. Maybe it will be a success worth a shot.
70 PER share soon
Glad I sold half prior to earnings.
"Earnings beat , can be down with weak guidance since there are too many things on paypal's plate(venmo, europe's xoom launch etc) to handle. Expecting 5% Down."

They're out on investor relations page...
Lots of PYPL shorts and nonbelievers in this forum. You all are in for a rude awakening. This is not the end. PYPL will rally and take out the old highs. And all of you will be scratching your heads wondering why you didn't cover.
Merchant accounts are a full 1% cheaper than paypal.
Short as a percent of float is 1.2%. Sorry longs...there is no short rally coming to get you higher exit prices. The current rally is distributive in nature...a fake banker's rally to draw in more longs for fleecing.

"Is anyone aware of a ""known issue"" @paypal that is placing extended holds on customer's money? I got a lot of explanations.

How many customers are experiencing this issue? Any feedback would be appreciated."

Just quit complaining and short. It’s going much lower. Growth slowed from 41% to 25%. That’s all you rookies need to know. Hope you don’t own over 1000 shares and you aren’t on margin. I think $215 is the highest this stock will ever be. $25 a few years ago was better than $215 or $175 now.
quite honestly dont get the price movement on this one.

"it's perfectly fine to own both PAYPAL and SQUARE..why are you guys so fixate on one or the other lol I own paypal, sq, mastercard, visa and they all have done very well for me. dont need to be hating and dissing each other lol"
Hold or sell before earnings?
I went up 93% took back investment and shares left to ride higher. happy happy
$300 could be a support level....
"Waiting for these drops since April but now that I’m in the market, it goes down...fak"
Sold at 83.Hopefully earnings come in well and get back in. I think they will beat.
"Traders on the floor does not believe in Tax delay, that is the reason why the market comes back. Majority still believes the market will go higher till year end."
PayPUKE still $309? How about $261 this am? Stonks will fall 80%
What a JOKE! Now they are PUMPING $PYPL BUBBLE again!The Stock Price is already up by 250% in the last 9 months...Keep Gambling! BUY ALL THE PEAKS!
Get in before TSNP skyrockets into dollar land and pre-buy out! https://youtu.be/KX9AGjXCrT0
The only one in my portfolio that is RED pypl. Go figure?
central banks are the only ones buying these hyperinflated stocks. this is a gift to retail longs looking to liquidate prior to the collapse.
trapped dip buyers should help with the downward velocity when scampal break south of 100.
"RSI was overbought after earnings, now oversold. Green tomorrow as uptrend continues.Has to go down by over 3% intraday before any profits need to be taken off the table.Week or two at the earliest yet in my humble opinion."
New High gonna Fly!
shorts are trying everything in their power to keep it below 177. Pre market going to lose
PayPal`s subsidiary heavily invested in crypto
near term chart does not look good
"It will be interesting to see how it plays out. PYPL paid $2.2B or 13x 2018 projected revenues, $126M, to compete in point of sale transactions where SQ is already in those markets. PYPL is playing catch-up and is paying dearly to do so. How long will it take them to get back to black on that investment?"
Crying babies go awayLong term3-5 years
"Holding this till 80%+ from current price, having the trading ability in papal in the near future"
"Resistance will be at 70 . Once that breaks, open the flood gate to 62"
Sell it.
Don’t think we see much of anything until the ER is released today. Fingers crossed. High expectations.
"there is a new startup tsnp and humbl it,s a little like paypal but only .46cents cap over1.35billoin take a look at it"
PYPL is up 6.20% to 98.47
Paypal is one of the most secure and fair payments in the world!
Lots of resistance @ $300.00. Hard to break through...
"The Navy and Marine Corps messages, issued Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, reference an executive order directing U.S. Northern Command to implement the Department of Defense Global Campaign plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases 3551-13."
Shorts in trouble on PYPL/ 18 million shares short or 3 days to cover .. u r crazy to short this here
"wow if the nasdaq turns red for no reason, imagine what will happen when elections come and there is ACTUAL reason to panic"
I wonder if Google is interested in buying PYPL
PayPal is a 250 billion company this year
PayPal! PayPal! PayPal! Amazon pay and apple pay wish they were paypal.
Another buy rating. I wonder when this one hits 200 again.
The push into earnings?
Amazon is a monopoly and should and will be broken up.....
Im guessing that PYPL ends the week around $193 or 4....
U.S. Factory Activity CRATERS! Stocks Poised For RECORD HIGH OPEN.
Guys I am new wit Fintech. What is better for keep long:Pypl or $SQ? Is $MA or $V better than $Pypl or SQ?I have 20K to invest for at least 7-10 years.
"When you take your profits NOK is the beat ling on the market, sit back and enjoy the show."
Jack Dorsey sold some Square shares so he could buy $PYPL
C’mon Danny boy! Give us a big ER!!
what just happened?!?!
Bye bye plaid  maybe time to dump this for $PYPL now 
sinking fast just like Square!
are insiders selling?
I will love a reacción tomorrow like TSLA
Buy now or wait for a dip? Pls don’t say just buy lol! Sensible suggestions...
SQ will be $100 after earnings
"LOL!! I guess Paypal's steel and aluminum will cost them more money to buy!! Yea, where do these money runners come from bum F Egypt???"
Some heavy duty players were loading up today. Traded strong. Big upside in the near future Imo.
"If you look at the times and shares, there are purchases of 15,000-50,000 shares at a single time. Institutions are buying up shares. A low float can cause share price to be more volatile and in this case PayPal could see 5%-10% gain if it keeps up."
My left nut for a PYPL BABA JV agreement in the next 30 minutes!
"Wow, breaking $200 is a significant milestone. Let's hope $200 soon becomes the unbreakable low baseline."
Can we pass 75.68 before the close?
one of the few that will grow in this special situation
Bought the dip. Hope this doesn't drop more tomorrow....
PYPL reversal will happen faster than a Chetah on ExLax. Shorting would be insane!
"Glad I shorted this pos. 139 next on deck. They get TWO upgraded to 170+ and this tanks lol. Not going to lie I've been using paypal more than ever lately...100% of the people I've done transactions with all had an account...unlike venmo or cashapp where 80% did not. Even I know this drag is unjustified,but I'll gladly make money on it."
PYPL long term 
I am up 40% on paypal. Love this stock
bitcoin will not freeze your account as pypl does as a matter of policy for any reason really.
Andrew Left said on Bloomberg that his kids could have done better with stocks over the last 3 years than he has. Why do people care to listen to this guy?
"With the recent price swing, I've seen some comments on the possibility that PYPL would be buyng their shares. I'm assuming that it's on the open market. What I don't know is how PYPL is required to document that. Does the quantity of Shares outstanding change, and if so, is there a requirement on how long that delay can be, before they have to update the Available Shares?"
Excellent quarterly results. Guiding down a bit so that next earning will be a blow-out.Enjoy the ride to $150 over the next 6 months
"Baltic Dry Index Collapsing, Germany Economy Slowdown, More Retail Jobs To Be Cut"
"More of the same old, same old. Expectations grow past deliverance. Until free cash flow is used for even a small dividend shareholders will not get anything close to what they anticipate. Well this old dog didnt get bit to bad this time. Pared some of my shares at a little over $129.00 I learned."
Pal.. please check out GROW. I have a new position in it. It's primed to break out.
Next company to cave in .... Amazon..... ? Here's hoping !
No juice here. Consistently for the past two years SQ has demonstrated it's superiority. Sold out PYPL late yesterday and doubled SQ position.
Z
ATH! SOON!
LOW making ne lows. Housing collapse confirmed. Let's spend more money we do not have with PYPL. Is this why paypal is getting aggressive with a growing number of delinquent accounts?
looks like I just made $400 on PayPal the last 5 minutes of the day by selling a credit call spread (170/180). Good earnings just not good enough.
1 word... explosion. U heard it here annoyingly first and often
"Love PYPL, will BLGI compete soon?"
bullish 1000 pypl
Mute USTechBUBBLE2018
"Just got news from a contractor that PayPal has something big coming soon. She wouldn’t say anything more than that, but I’m pretty excited to see what PayPal has in store for all of us."
I love PayPals interface and their company but their stock can never gain traction. It’s sad haha.
SO HAPPY WITH EVERYBODY. UP UP HULA
"Who in their right minds would ever vote for Harris/Biden? Even the liberals hate Harris, she got 1% of the vote in the Democratic primaries."

"Now PYPL 85 is very possible by the time earnings report in the 4th week of this month. Keep eyes on UNH, it will hit 235+ by Jan 17, 2018"
should have bought Mastercard after the pull back in fintech. PYPL is dead money.
Time to short this company. It's heading downward.
“Reinstating and raising guidance based on strong momentum”!
"folks, Pypl is a wonderful stock for buy and hold, and this company has everything going for them... the reason why were struggling us due to the dow nasdaq etc... just hold on"
Paypal in its sector is what the Hoover is to the vacuum.
"Look at the TREND, the financial world changes really fast. Digital payment stock sector will shoot up, without doubt. Who has ecosystem and BRAND. V, MA,and PYPL have the best brand. PYPL has the best ecosystem among three. VENMO will be the big winner, PYPL knows it. That is the reason it keeps pushing VENMO. Wait until it monetizes VENMO, we may see PAYPAL credit card to go against V and MA."

$73-$75 tomorrow!
All eyes on Q2 2021 earnings. The ole fork in road moment when they announce in July. Hold till then!!!
Humbl is the next PayPal and square combined. Ticker TSNP
will only close $2 down today...
You guys want growth? Buy $SQ or $PYPL or even $CAJ......thank me later
Time to fly . Hammer the ask and this will rip to 245. Don't get left on the side lines.
Crude oil is doing what PYPL has been doing for the past 12 months ..... Glad I have a small portfolio of oil shares.
Frustrating market. The tech earnings have been incredible. I guess there just too much rotation on the tape.
will pypl ever split?
Hope it drops even more tomorrow. Good time to buy shares of a great company.
"I guess Wall Street Banks know how much net inflow of retail money there is going into this ER, and what a great way to crush the retail longs."
"How do you feel now Jerry?? PYPL > SQ every day, all day"
"Low volume today. Not much positive action compared to other financials. Disappointed in today, maybe tomorrow."
It will be very interesting to see how successful the Burger King promo with Venmo works out.
Was looking good in the premarket. Not so much now.
"PYPL's momentum run is over...for a while, anyway (since it's earnings miss & ""soft"" guidance.) It may continue to consolidate until it forms it's new base. Only the messenger... I own it, I love it & want it to kick #$%$"
Going down down down !! May reach up to 80 !!
PayPal has now banned any transactions related to Trump.

like rest of the stocks after earnings . Will see 190 again
bears sterns cramer claims pypl is terrrific. oh dear the top is surely in!
PayPal should just buy eBay :)
It is at resistance and at a top. Would not chase this just yet.
Silver is a myth!
hey pal! where are you going?!?!! Lmao.
BINGO REPEAT -- NO juice here. It's listless. In this space SQ is the place! BINGO. Just another 3-4x of PYPL again today ... as it has consistently over past 2 yrs. PYPL return has been very good ..... but SQ's has been 4x better ... and the differential is being maintained !! SQ is just fantastic and getting better .... all aboard the SQ train!!
75k shares
Today is the day $SQ will pass $PYPL in share price. GLTA
If own shares of PayPal then you own some Bitcoin indirectly through PayPal  Is that the logic here 
Discount
no rate cut today means .5 t0 1.0 cut in july. that means 2.25 cut to 1.25 fed funds rate. the emergency is absolutely real and the panic will be epic. remember...buying low and selling high is the ONLY way to profit. Silver continues to be at giveaway prices. PYPL....lol!!!
Sell $SQ and $PYPL and move your profits to $BFT
"low 5yr beta of 1.09, you do know low beta stocks outperform high beta stocks."

"PYPL+SQ runup is holding... might be resetting new bottom, next move up at SQ ER (?)"
Shipping is good now and a strong bet is this company about to release 5-7X earnings over 2019 Q3. You should load up as it will be released anytime now. https://stocksregister.com/2020/10/02/seanergy-maritime-holdings-corp-ship-is-worth-accumulating-at-current-levels/
Paypal the WeChatpay and Alipay of the West.
PayPal is the future of banking. This stock will only go up.
Oversold like everything else. BTC is not the company and the company is not BTC. So sell if you want. It’s a dumb move IMO.
"This is a nothing burger downgrade, just a buying opportunity..."
"If PYPL ever hooks up with amazon web site, stock goes to $100."
A lot of insider selling the last few weeks but the stock keeps rising. That bods well for the future and how undervalued this stock is.
Are u invest for long term or day trading! I am holding my SQ and PayPal for a very long time!!
PYPL is under distribution. Check the volume. What is the news going to be?
"ever notice how venmo is for years now touted as ""will one day be profitable""?"
I sold my stocks and I’m in big with 202.5 7/31 calls I bought 30 at 1.45 this will blast for earnings !
"It's ridiculous rating PYPL to a SELL, but a GOOD opportunity to pick up more shares!"
But why!?!? It doesn’t make sense!!!
"small data breach big deal, folks QUIT selling this stock, you making me lose money dang it. BUY BUY BUY!!!!"
added so much more
"something i read about bitcoin, Investors are long-term holders focused on Value & Speculators are short-term holders focused on Price. meaning 2/3rds of the supply hasnt moved!!!"
thank you for your analysis!
Down 5% from recent highs; anyone old enough in here to remember $249+?
bring on the upgrades! This is a steal at this price.
Just hit 75 ah because of mm....laughing at all my friends who didn't buy when I told them
So far not one mention of the ludicrously large debt increase PYPL has incurred. Why is that?
paypal on Cramer after 4:00
new highs. rate cuts take pypl to 200.
"If will drop to 80 tomorrow, i will not to hesitate to LOAD more!"
New position started in TEUM. going to pop a lot moreGROW!!
"Come on PYPL, take another plunge tomorrow and I’ll buy another call LEAP. Two can play that game. I’ve been in this thing since the 40’s."
Slow & steady wins the race.
Wassup with all the shareholder alerts? Lawyers just trying to get their name out there? Holding want to see what Q4 brings...
PayPal is too damn good.
The 50 day should serve as a bottom during tomorrows trading. That's pretty much a 5% decline from todays close.
Will the earnings report be released before the market opens or after close?
Pre-market is suggesting a new 52 week high today. Love this stock. Holding long.............................
Today is Asana ASAN earnings. Things look very good. You decide my friends
the fear of selling cause it could go up immediately
It's a great time to buy PayPal today. Best stock out there.
"This is a POS company-no phone service for problems,very slow to pay me money owed.Why is this going up ?"
Really curious here. I'm in since 09/01/2015$33.91 and again 09/15/2015 @ $33.19anyone have a lower entry point ?.....?
"IN on PYPL, MA, V. Good luck to Longs."
"Congrats to all $PYPL longs I still ended up owning long calls in PYPL. But . At 3:56pm, I was kinda busy trading n wanted to add to my long option call positions in $ PYPLL n I placed the order n it became a short on the JULY 31 205 CALLS! . I forgot to ensure it didn’t flip to an auto sell n then I add double the Shs n it becomes short on the call F-MEN then I had to Trade outta it N try to make a long cuz Im long PYPL. Well let’s say I expected to have time to get into QRVO.lol I only had time to buy 10 more PYPLY CALLS.WELL AT LEAST I didn’t loose anything !CONGRATS"
Closing the short at $90. Would go long at $70
Bought more shares
Be still my heart $86. We’re in da money. :))
SQ down with no news. it's just a money shift. don't panic.
$188? ROTFLMFAO! I haven’t covered one share yet. Just watch for $120.
"I only own AMd and paypal at the moment, this should have a nice boost ER today"
"Another Bozo from SunTrust=Fake News - Robinson ""HumpAlong"" Humphrey downgraded PayPal to hold from buy. It's so funny to see these jackwagons trying to manipulate the stock, nice try fools!Don't believe a word that comes from SunTrust=Fake News! They have lost all credibility.PayPal is going to $70 easily, next test will be $100 and while these bozo's keep downgrading we will be reaping huge rewards."
"Next resistance level of 235.22 in sight. Looking good in pre-market, yet have to keep my eye on options trading today."
PayPUKE  “only” down $40 and falling a lot farther when Bitcoin begins to tank. I see $200 by Friday!
paypal is the only stock in my portfolio that is up!!!!
Good news is needed!
"PYPL has nearly no Chinese exposure, should continue to be resilient against the trade war nonsense."
Your investment will be 10 folds with PYPL. Just look at MA and V
"Big, I know silver is in a dip but you might need to sell anyway as this short squeeze is only going to get worse herein..."
$97.50 calls doubled. Not bad for a days work. Staying long
This stock really hanged around 190 to 200 for about 3 months before CLEARLY breaking out. The shorts got PUMMELED
All gains wiped out $sq $pypl classic bubbles
I pray PayPal is smart enough to stay far away from Facebook!
Any bad news ???Why is Pypl so low????
weeeeeeweeeeeeeweeeeweeeee. can you say $300 weeeeeeweeee
Anything about Venmo?
"I know who does love Ebay... China. EBay has been a dumping ground for Chinese junk and counterfeit goods and still is. Yes, Chinese junk products that are poorly made and do not last. Like my ""Seiko"" watch I bought there that lasted a month. Buyer beware."
"Lucky that news about VENMO ads hit the wire at the right time, otherwise PYPL will hit the bottom of barrel. Today as usual, profit taking three days in a row. Tech sector suffers most. Wait till Thursday morning if WMT tanks, we will see correction."
Cheap
Yes Barry...buying richly valued stocks and selling undervalued stocks is the way to go. It has been a hard road for the value investor. Fed rate is at 2.5 % which gives us 10 quarter point rate cuts to zero. Should put PYPL at 300 too 600 the next two rate cuts. Yes the economy is imploding. Yes the fed will buy stocks like pypl to support the illusion. Get on board.
"I still stay with PYPL and add position on GOOG, base on steady earnings growth and safety. I feel like GOOG is coming to compete with AMZN for the home products. such as GOOGLE HOME, GOOGLE MAX which I see GOOG has better products than AMZN. GOOG has better AI than anybody because GOOG has played in this field way longer than anybody else."
this will double
Another hulk Green Day!

silver continuing to break out on day 2. who is long the most expensive stock market in history?
Hey Big have you ever been diagnosed as Obsessive Compulsive?
"Next generation growing up with those companies UberPaypalTikTok (FB)Snapchatas long as enough shares are in hands of households ""less"" worries"
exited and made 20% gain. Thank you PyPl!!!
Why do folks want to sell this So much?
Thinking about entering today.. not sure what to think about earnings
"Alright PayPal enough is enough, get up over $100 where you belong!!"
Interesting to see what Dan will do with the free cash flow THIS time! Plus I love it when the analysts can seperate the 14 cent MercadoLibre from guidance. Like that is going to be a one-time only event. PLEASE!!!!
"The $PYPL waters are nice and warm. Already through our 200DMA and ready to go up. When SQ go through? Oh yeah, around $60. Hard up, hard down."
Declare Tech sell off today. So I buy some good one. I like THE BAD ONE ADBE. PYPL two of the super chart.
"Operation ""PULL THE PLUG"" to be initiated any moment. Exchange FRN's for PHYSICAL silver on all dips."
I had this stock when it was in 50’sGood stock for longsJust waiting for a pull back. Not chasing here.Gl
"Split announcement coming, may be EOD today"
I think square will get hacked before PayPal ever will
"im really about to sell most of my portfolio and add it all to my paypal holdings, everything in my heart says we are just getting started on this paypal ride. This is to good of a company , i literally see no problems with paypal."
Happy thanksgiving and a happy leap to $100 soon
Expect this stock will be over 1000 bucks in ten years
EXPLOSION!!!!
PayPal pull towards Nasdaq market is tend to make it high gain today
Doesn’t seem realistic that PayPal at the rate it’s market-cap is increasing will be worth more than Visa in a year. PayPal is way overvalued in my opinion or Visa way undervalued￼
"SQ % return > PYPL ...every day (0.13% vs. .10%), week (5.14 vs. -0.59), month ( 6.75 vs 3.49), 3 mos. (39.07 vs 9.78 ), 6 mos. (65.44 vs 4.33 ), Year (167 vs 48 ) and two years (635% vs. 137% ). DEAL WITH IT !!"
PYPL is up 4.90% to 115.14
Shorts will be killed again!
I wonder if PYPL could overtake V?
$215 to $191 since the fake crypto news
"Will be green late today or by Friday, Friday is setting up for a rally as the Fed will announce the growth numbers tomorrow and the suspicion is that it may bump 5% which will drive the liberals nuts but so be it."
THE MOON ISNT FAR OUT OF REACH!!!!!! HOLD
Omg Amazons going to take out PayPal yah right and Walmart taking out Amazon all hype funny stuff
"I imagine that we will see a lot of profit taking this week, so be prepared. 230 by 12/30/20"
I’ll say it again. Short back down to 80. This is still an amazing long term play. Earnings will disappoint.
"Sell PPYL now and buy SQUARE, it’s moving faster than this Turtle."
Apparently a side effect of the Coronavirus is a market sell off of Paypal
Where’s Kev
"Short gain, though. Any outlook for tomorrow?"
major market crashes occur every 10 years. last crash was 2008. oh dear.
worst company ever slow payouts huge discrepancies bad management confusing Ebay transactions. I encourage everyone to not use this company.
Pypl is the future of money after this pandemic
I bought thinking earnings was today.
just got back in at $180.00
Back again!
what's with the heavy call options trade expiring in 16 days? expecting some announcement?
"With almost 20 agencies upgrading the stock, PYPL is heading to $220 within a month"
I don’t understand how this stock is going down...
"PayPal reaching all time highs. We've seen this movie before. And it's just as good, every time"
"Big says sell @105. Oh, wait.....nevermind."
venmo/pypl provides zero rewards and zero credit building. visa: the better method. the whales are distributing but a great cost insofar as keeping the price up for retail / mom traders.
"Hate to say it BUT no one is ever buying PayPuke up here ever again after seeing it drop $20+ on no news in one minute wiping out $20b plus of shareholder wealth. Just wait until real bad news comes, this will drop $200"
Where this big bounce to 250 you delusional wannabes kept cheerleading about!? LOL
Well....didn't take long for it to bust back below the 200 day. Hopefully it's just testing the 50 day. No reason for this stock to go lower than the 50 day unless it's on one of those market wide selloffs
Cypto is killing it.... Paypal has their fingers in the honeypot!
PayPal is a monster!
"I hate to be back so soon, but I said I would when $teum explodes with an annoying “I told you so.” Well, that day may be tmrw! It’s primed to take off!! And it’s only the beginning. $Teum is going to completely explode further over the next 2 years. Buy it while it’s low, this is a goldmine :) we chat tmrw."
Is PayPal Stock A Buy Right Now
Just bought more Paypal. Wish PYPL would offer a dividend though. $90 in 2019
PayPal's Honey Acquisition Makes No Senseon seeking alpha
"Paypal of the Eastern Euro Qiwi is trading at close to cash value, and growing faster than Paypal. It is incredible to see electronic payment companies stock price rising faster than the west."
OHH NO GOING BACK UP. My middle finger to you shorts.
Was that ebays attempt to give the middle finger to paypal? Not cool bro! Paypal said ebay money was just nuts. There's bigger cows to milk! Let's go paypal!
Big crash coming. Hedge funds wanted this at 180 range over valued
Puts gonna PRINT!!
We need bigger gains. All my other stocks in this sector are kicking butt. I have done very well with PYPL but it needs to start climbing.
I am very happy this stock is going up - large position long term .. but does anyone know why this is going up? Is there news? I am looking myself right now.
PayPal is up 4.91% to 211.88
"SQ is the future, PYPL is the past. Just saying..."
There is always a told you so on every board. Hehhe
I will be happy with 150 by Friday
Time to make our assault on $70. Onwards and Upwards. 
On a serious note... PayPal primed for $80 very very very soon!
Cha Ching goes my cash counter
Has this finally turned into a value stock??
"Well, so much for yesterday's very short lived 5% cryptocurrency pop which was completely wiped out today."
Sorry 350$+Correction from previous post
Big recovery tomorrow!!!
should we sell this pop?
This is a gift of epic proportions.....buy
good news soon
Its going to be great guys..it should bust through $200. PYPL was probably making $$$$ during the pandemic and could have reaped tons of benefits with PPPs
50% of total volume in last 2 minutes. bank only buying. retail not interested. warren is certainly not interested.
wow but DIS stays flat...lol
They will fade the strong opening. Triple witching low volume and still digesting the FED remarks equal a red close imo.His
Looks like round one is done?
can anyone explain why this has not participated in the rally since earnings...great co but I'm wondering if as a stock not so great.what has me as neutral is that it doesn't look like it once to go to even 110 from here. having said that 135 sounds right 12 mis out. with almost all of it coming after first qtr next years have doubts we see 110 by years end stock misacting poorly in the last cal of big rally since earnings
buy at the open?
when will we hit $120?
Every stock will rise if Trump wins. Prepare for the market to sink and stay flat if Biden wins.
TRUST WHY YOU GOT INTO THIS STOCK IN THE FIRST PLACE. BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR EARNINGS.
"There was never a dam doubt. Komol is a donkey. Stop analyzing and look at the damn fundamentals and the company's growth. U heard it here annoyingly first and often, explosion coming. And this won't be the last. Hold this pos. It's going even higher. Please stay tune"
expensive and no dividend?
"PYPL will come back more or less today, because tech sector starts to recover from hang over this morning. Hint: if WMT is up tomorrow morning, the whole market will come back, but if WMT slides down tomorrow, WE WILL HAVE CORRECTION."
"VENMO beats SQ because of the BRAND. SQ has subprime loan which I think it will haunt SQ later. I think it will be PYPL year when it is free from EBAY. EBAY is a dead fish in the water, and nobody wants to buy it."
"Stellar earnings, growth,... And they raise their guidance... What more do you people need??Anyways, market will eventually respect the fundamentals... Though those of us with expiring options might be less sanguine about it.."
"Here we go again, wow week like this, they really want the robinhooders to get out"
I'll gladly be wrong on my predictions this time!!! GO PAYPAL GO!
Charge!
150 soon
"I am surprised that nobody buy Nov 24 call 75 the premium is just 15 cents. I bought another 50 calls. It is no brain stock and i don't need to figure it out that when I buy it, I make money right away."
It's a miss on volume. Slowing down?
This move into India is huge. India gets overlooked being in the shadow of China but a billion plus population of whom very few have credit cards and very amicable to using PYPL. The PYPL story just keeps getting better
Is there a sector Amazon is not considering?......... What a load......
"quality stocks win, like this, no pump n dump, no mad volatility."
Anyone knows about their buyback program?
Anyone concerned about Q4 earnings yet? Expectations are high. Wonder why they were beefed up so much?
There we go. Come home to papa. Will be $120 before we know it.
. What kind of drop are we expecting here? I really like the growth potential here and dividends.
Flipping idiot Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. He must be a shorty coming out with this BS Fake News!PayPal is in it's infancy. Going much higher after earnings and a high possibility VISA will buy them out.Go Long!
did ya buy silver on the big dip?
I'm thinking there will be a big announcement. Why would they take out a big loan when they already have cash on hand?
PayPal reached an all time high at 218.26
People like komol are a prisoner to the moment. Do yourself a dam favor and hold this beast. It's going nowhere but up for the months to come. This is just the beginning gang. Stay tune for more gains.
Fantastic volume and only at 12:15 pm....$95.00 at closing!!! Go PYPL.!
Kev for prez of kazakstan
I'm still buying pypl on under $55.00 price. Stock is still growing earnings. This stock will grow big time for the next 4 to 5 years
Amazon tells users to uninstall a product that PayPal just paid $4 billion for:https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/amazon-says-uninstall-honey-which-paypal-just-paid-4-million-for.html
$182 tomorrow... written on the wall.
"Inmho, Street target price $128 ,other under priced stocks ,MA ,V, FB."
$100 in 12 months.
"Buy orders stacking up, get ready for a big move up!"
"Buy more SQ shares, you will not regret it."
"""Keep the price above 100 so I can sell/distribute shares into the buyback."" -pypl insider"
tiny up day volume. distribution continues.
This is how China buys America for pennies on the dollar.
this bad boy needs to keep going got some calls on this
"Hey ""Schulman""... can you do something that INCREASES the PYPL stock price? - You are on a roll .... but the wrong way."
where are the PayPal haters from Square now?
Come on PAYPAL be a Pal on go on up so I can. get paid!
"Paypal's Ceo is pumping the stock , he never mentioned losing Ebay . SEC should investigate him"
93% institutionally owned / pullbacks like this they are buyers
Sell here buy SQ lower and watch it blast past this slow coach.
DO NOT miss payment company IIIV. They project FY19 adj eps of .79-.81c whereas SQ projecys FY18 adj eps of .39-.41
This is a knee-jerk reaction. 100B mktcap and great balance sheet.
panic selling by people who do not know stockmarket
Payment stocks are up except for PYPL. WTH
"We beat the all time high!! Don't just stop there, keep going!!"
"each and every salary is a dream, BUYING BACK my friends"
"I don't think I will have chance to buy PYPL so early. I want to wait until end of Dec, but today I can't resist to buy it because it is too cheap to ignore. The big picture is we still have strong economy, smart money goes after the cheap PE stocks which have dividends, banks, healthcare, insurance. I believe in tech sector which I think it is still in prime time. Take your pick, you will not have a chance to buy stocks like FB and PYPL this cheap again in 2018."
This is classic overreaction. The switch will start in the North American Mkt in 2nd half of 2018 and will be a multi year transition. PaypalWill be offered as a payment option as well. People will be using paypal for the most part still. It is no fee to buyers. People will stick with what they know. I will bet that paypal will lower their fees once competition presents itself to maintain market share
$309 - $260 = -$50 which is almost down 20% in a week Nice stock lol 
"I love Paypal and hold stocks, still looks like a correction"
300! Stay long folks!
90 ozs of silver to 1 oz gold. silver is now free. load.
Those who short.... I am all for being reasonable but you might want to reconsider your short position. Pypl has been profitable and growing every single ER for last 2 + yearsPypl has been flat last 9 months. You have guts to gamble vs this. Pypl reasonable should be around $100 to even $110 atm. I only see this falling if market correction or recession
Sheesh i missed this one good work folks
"PayPal not good at integration with companies they buy..... Not sure why, but any company they buy will be a large challenge for them to get every penny predicted.... This amount should be the top until they prove otherwise....."
Shorts gonna get smashed again tomorrow
Update: it just overtakes a Wall St icon in size - DISNEY. Would would have foreseen it when it went public 5 years ago.
Anyone's guess if it will continue to drop after open to maximize picking up more?
Told you all 3 months ago after the eBay announcement SQ is open for business. Since then SQ up ~30% PYPL ~.99%. Good work folks
It is down right now because of stimulus but it will have tremendous gains before it ER. MARK MY WORDS
The end of PayPuke was the day it fell $302 to $280 in one second rebounded to $309 and hasn’t had an uptick since
PU83jw....you just worry about your own shares Square Head; SQ about to follow Facebook... they are down 20% down Afterhours dingbat! LIVE WITH IT !
just load up every dip...this will be the Bank of the future!

No reason to sell in this market !

"PayPal's a decent company so the stock price will probably go back up, but for the long run I'd rather own MasterCard or Visa"

Happy $200  GLTA
Opens for pypl are being goosed up only to find BIG BIG sellers exploit the higher prices. PYPL distribution continues.
ENVV and GLNNF entering blockchain.
Anything above a $70 close is gravy. It will take PYPL less time to get from $70-80 then it took to get from $60-70. IMHO
ill start biting once and if it hits the 90s
"so the fed is gonna hyperinflate and stocks will double from here regardless of fundamentals, right?"
low volume gap and trap. cratering economy = buy stocks!
No matter how much we wanted PYPL to gain tremendously today it won’t happen. Sold 2 hours ago at $144 and reinvested in UBER and have gained 2.5% since. Know when to hold them and when to fold them and reinvest elsewhere.
pypl is hyperinflated priced to perfection. silver ramping to 20 end of year.
PYPL earnings are expected to grow by 10% in 2020. So why is it a good investment when it trades for more than 30x 2019 earnings.
the stock market is about to get the shaft. Central banks buying gold hand over fist! https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-demand-trends/gold-demand-trends-q1-2019/central-banks-and-other-institutions

You longs sell $183.50?????
"IMPEACHMENT IS ONLY GOING TO FUEL PROTESTS. LET THE PRESIDENT GO IN PEACE, TO MAINTAIN PEACE.DEMS CONTINUE TO SHOW TRUE HATE TOWARDS REPUBLICANS.#$%$ ON PELOSI."
PayPal will do just fine without EBay. Kinda sad they had to ruin the great company performance by announcing the news the same day earnings came out. eBay is junk for that.
go ahead..buy the dip...do ya feel lucky?
"too much hype, you have too many competitors in the market now , square, apple , google, amazon"
Hope to see 195 by weeks end. possibly 200

Let it drop so I can buy more 
"PayPal offers nothing, SQ is the way"
incessant buying. get on board.
This is going downnnn after earnings are released
PayPal is the future. Cashless currency is the future. You’re in denial if you think otherwise. I’d even buy Visa.
this is why im in Paypal. long term all the way!
Should I buy amc?

Could be a heavily pulling back today after a wild run up since beginning of JANUARY.......
"PYPL will lose 90% of its value from current levels. Watch and learn ""investors""."
Appears the professional money now coming into the stock. Amateur hour is over.
"This market is terrible, cant hold gains at all."
PayPuke still $309+? Man is this a Ponzi
PayPal reached an all time high at 264.80
Sold
About time for this to move up!
"Now that we've pretty much broken the $54 resistance, we will be head to $60 shortly."
This stock really beat expectations I bought it around 80 I was a fool to sell it at 90 (peak price).
How about selling PPYL and buying SQ at a lower price before ER.
"As of today, cryptocurrency is now accepted as payments at tens of thousands of merchants in the U.S. on the Flexa network. Top brands such as Whole Foods, Baskin Robbins, Lowe’s, and Nordstrom will now accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Gemini Dollar."
"Loeb's Third Point exits PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Colfax (NYSE:CFX), and Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW)."
PYPL pay system is frustrating for costumer. Good for company and EBay is better without it. Not buying this yet. Waiting for lower price. Now that it lost its mojo price will trade to higher lows
Paypal dipping pretty bad for the day... I wonder what's going on the back end
"Will be the new coinbase, but a better brand name"
there are less than 14M shorts in pypl out of a billion shares plus. this is not a squeeze. this is a distribution. who do ya think is selling 2M plus shares in after hours above 104?
"PayPal needs to buy banxa. their MC is only 122 mil. partnerships with major exchanges like binance, kucoin. they need to get on acquisitions quick before this newly listed psp balloons in value."
Up up and up PYPL !!
Spent $2.7B this quarter trying to catch up to SQ. How long before they are back to black on those 4 investments?
"Hmmm...where is the bottom, or is this it?"
"Don't be foolish and sell, look at SHOP today, at earnings it literally stayed flat and then shot out of the door. I am keeping PYPL for a while, only in for a few months anyway and think with the Virus going on and a second wave expected. See where this is at tomorrow."
Heard their might be a 2.5% dividend comming
Easy money.

Janet Yellen. She said there will be rate hikes to avoid an overheating economy. Translation for the sensible investor: The economy is in great shape and the worst fear is too much growth goo fast causing inflation = very good news for the economy.
Silver making a run for 20 as bank supported markets struggle mightily for meager gains. Warren has sold out of the equity markets.
Ouch. But can’t trust the AH movement before earnings. It’s all noise
is visa a better stock to own then pypl
Check out ENVA. Way undervalued PE of 3.
"Thumbs if you think PayPal share prices will surge after earnings date, and thumbs dumb if you think it won’t increase much"
I have owned this company since they were spun off by eBay no place to go but up stay the course
"The best stock to buy today should be UNH, correction for UNH is reasonable now. long term July 230 is the best trade"
Just another nice day in paradise.
Bargain priceBuy buy buy
I would be happy if we can hold $86 for a bit until things stabilize. Bad outlook for 3rd quarter is really a blessing since it came with better earnings overall for the year. Just need to hold it until next ER or better news.
why market green it down .market red it up
How can somebody like Rick Newman be taken seriously as a Journalist? His spouting condemning Politics for taking away free speech. Yes he can wrute books and Articles but uts not Journalism or Truth. Its his far left Opinions. Really anyone who has any self respect doesnt need a Rick Newman to telm them what to think because Rick doesnt want your opinion or your speech? Just buy his books and give him your money
Cramer loves PYPL!!!!! One of his top picks!!!!
"Here's my question: Is it true you missed revenue, but that you will be greater than Microsoft was when it's stock first appeared? lolll"
Let’s be real. How often do you use PayPal? Compared to Visa or MasterCard.
Finger pointing is for 9 years olds.This has nothing.to do with Dems...it's a stampede out if bonds do.to the idea the economy will.start booming. Problem is...the more dovish powell sounds....the higher rates will rise at this point
A very creditable improvement in one week of 3.8%... not bad for the week before earnings are released .... at which time we should see it a further 10% ahead !
"I'm an early eBay user, and added a PayPal account as soon as possible to end my use of money orders to pay for auctions (thousands of them, really! a lot of trading cards, car parts, household parts and items, etc.).Unfortunately, PayPal is having problems for some users, and no one there is answering / fixing things, apparently. No response to my inquiries for three weeks for a bank verification problem with their website, and their PayPal Assistant function doesn't work either. You can read about many users' problems, worldwide, here:https://www.paypal-community.comI hope PP gets their act back together soon! :-{Sincerely,A neglected customer."
we have bench mark with $PYPL and $SQ
"Buy Paypal today, paypal's ceo is going to be on jim Cramer's Mad Money"
paint dry
still a multi bagger $500 in less than 2 years
PYPL has been making strategic investments all year that have flopped hitting earnings. big question is how much of the losses will be priced in by the 24th?
Not really a big beat considering the big run it’s had the past 3 months. This will probably sell off before stabilizing and then heading back up.
"Big, you should take your $500 short and go to a new board or back to moms basement."
OK..the music changed to a faster upbeat happy tune...going to be good!
"*PAYPAL 3Q NET REV. $5.46B, +25% Y/Y"
Now is the time to get in.
Momentum gone for 2 Q’s now. Should have bailed out already.
im strapped in
What a load of #$%$ Stuff like this is exactly why no one trusts the market based on basic facts and fundamentals. The options traders and the big boys can make a stock go whichever way they want. This type of drop on this earnings and outlook is a raping of the shareholders
"Zelle can’t even compare to PayPal’s Venmo. If you look at the track record of banks like Wells Fargo and BAC, they are always screwing people over with their added fees."
bull baby!!!
Take the time to mark those accounts as spam. It’s ok to speak your opinion on a stock but it’s not ok to fill the forum with spam posts about the dot com bubble
Are people serious  and didn’t sell $309? Mother of all bubble stocks ever
Loaded more!!!
"It is good flush, so just get ready to buy again. UNH is very good solid stock, just wait for the right price."
I think today will be the low on PYPL. Time to pick up a few more shares
This is a must own stock. Still has a lot of upside potential.
$55 is coming
PYPL should sue anazon over their false statement
golly the number of chances for longs to get out is extra ordinary.
Shorts and sellers just shot themselves in the foot  Longs are laughing their way to the bank
"SQ is up 10% on basically no news....what's up here? I assume that's some short squeeze as they indicate about an 8% of float short, but is there news I'm missing? Uber's deal for postmates is somehow helping them? Where's the comparable paypal run today?"
"Beast, best stock currently in my portfolio."
"Rich TEAM is doing real good, he was in TEUM and GROW"
"EBAY issue is a major problem that will drag PYPL down or not go higher until 2020. I guess PYPL will float around 75-80 unless VENMO still in the process of monetizing. If VENMO does not show the higher growth rate, I guess PYPL will not go higher than 80."
Barclays is a big bank looking to help clients sell their pypl shares without collapsing the price in the process. Barclays is telling you to buy PYPL shares from its clients. Simple really.
I'm in at SQ for 1000 shares. Paid 71.44. Wish me luck !
looks like somebody missed out on the surge and is trying to get in cheap
people start selling sq and buying paypal after third point big stake
Let`s go

The moat is built Even PayPal's investment in Mercadolibre is up over 100%. Almost $1100 A SHARE price for MELI!"
BLAST OFF!!
why is this down today?
$210+ tomorrow !!!!!
"I believe this stock just got way too far ahead of itself. I sold all my shares just before the shut down in order to protect my profit and bought a ton back at $89/sh. I believe that the stock is solid for the long term but, the price per share was above the top price BEFORE the shut down of the country. That made no sense to me other than simply unrealistic enthusiasm. I sold it all off again at a few pennies shy of $145/sh. Looking forward to buying back in again when it makes sense. I love pypl but at the right price."
I love PYPL but sold out at $105. Gotta say I'm pretty shocked this is running.
America first?.............. Not for eBay ......
This thing is going to a trillion!!
"All the hedge funds just have fun to scoop the health care stocks today. AMZN issue is just the idea that is very hard to happen. If you know how the health care providers can develop up to this point, it takes over 10-15 years. Look back at each health care provider then up to now. It takes a lot of time both money and energy before becoming to today. If you think AMZN can disrupt this industry, you need to go see the doctor to check your brain."
no brainer buy

"Jan 26, call 78 is really good choice. I believe that PYPL can hold 78 because the market should move even higher, when bond market moves in opposite."
soon its gonna be green !!! there is no way it stays down..let the upgrades come..just add some more
Big can I buy more shares from you at 105?
Easy $21 by Monday. $PYPL is increasing why not Paysafe soon. Bitcoin boost with paysafe as well next.
"Lets not forget a short time ago on April 20, 2017 PayPal closed at only $43.69. Now we are up $15.40 in only 3 months. Watch it fly after earnings. More good news coming. Unless North Korea launches a missile at U.S. among other places stocks will continue going higher.Accumulate on any large dip!"
J.P. Morgan Chase and Paypal will be announcing new partnership Thursday... exciting times are building.... get ready for the tsunami guys !!!
I'm adding at $75.70
"Paypal on it's way to $70 with no resistance....'yea mon"" we be jammin."
NICE MOVE.
i regret selling at 80 dollars back while ago and now I felt GOOD!
"If your short PYPL cover your positions, go longs"
Could dip a little more
Sell my shares? FIGHT ME.
Could this be the next PYPL or Venmo? HUMBL merging with $TSNP. What do you think?
"I love reading all the comment about how PayPal will go nowhere and is a #$%$ company. I?ve been reading these same comments since PayPal was in the $50?s, $60?s, $70?s, etc. Please keep it up because it seems to keep the stock moving in the right direction. It?s all the shorts getting burnt"
EOD will be around 147.50
MM will run this up a bit like I predicted and then short it down heavy imo.
"""New "" here what if PayPal beats earnings next week, what are your thoughts on price range? Also what if they miss how low do you think this will fall."
"These stocks options are just for sell, not buy: you will never make any dime on directional options play: calls or puts:PYPL/SQ/NFLX/SHOP,..."
This is gonna bounce real nice!!!
PayPUKE has to rally $32 to get back where it was last week lol 
222 by Inauguration Day... if not sooner.
There’s going to need to make a 5% dividend here
The sell off makes no sense. The next earnings will be a blowout and the investment in China will prove to be a huge win. China is currently the second largest economy in the world and soon to bethe largest. Doing business and travelling there I see it first hand. From my part I will be selling some other holdings and purchase more paypal.
"How PYPL will generate revenue to replace EBAY, this is a big question for Dan. EBAY announcement is a big hit to PYPL growth rate, even though it still keeps going on for a few more years. Only way that PYPL can do is put more resources into VENMO and make it national brand and global brand. It is a must, no matter how much it will cost. To make it VENMO ME embedded into the consumer brain is like make golden arc into the kid's brain."
SELL! Cash payment is the future!
The said may 1st was there busiest day ever ..... lol its labour day for ever country outside the US every one was on holiday ... wht a joke
PayPal reached an all time high at 148.69
Making new all time highs yet again.
Break out day amigos! We’ll be breaking $100 very shortly and then we are off to the races. Hang on to this one!
horrible customer service .... just saying ...

"very solid stock despite earnings, very impressed."
loading up right now good buying opportunity
"paypal got over hammered on ebay announcement. 20+ years ago ebay had BID PAY...never used it...as a seller i opted to use paypal, western union, and at times used money orders as a option to pay still to this day. the media would make you think because ebay is switching to another payment system, people will drop paypal as a payment options on ebay....ebay was wrong before, they are wrong again. sellers and buyers determine what payment system they use. no payment system is mandatory on ebay...if there was....ebay stock holders would have to worry. as a ebal seller i have used western union, paypal, money orders, and bank transfers on high dollar itemsalot of media paypal bashing claims X, Y, and X could no same thing, and better. they said the same thing about NFLX, AMZN for years too. in fact just months a go a speaker on financial show said google, msft. amzn and more have the cash to instantly compete with NFLX. there was talk many times by investor sites that NFLX was not a buy out candidate, more or less anyone could do what the company does. Square and paypal imo, should be looked at as buyout candidates, paypal if they acquire square, it will be too late game over...welcome the next AMZN, NFLX, etc"
We have a flat yield curve. I estimate Pypl going to $40 in 1-2 years.
Usually play the er but I’ll sit out on this
"I mean really, this is a no brainer.230 target sounds about right...if we are talking end of november that is.Wishing my funds were already cleared but you work with what you've got."
the crash that was thwarted in 2008 with low interest rates can no longer be delayed. the fake market is being realized for its inherent value. a return to single digit p/e's is a matter of when not if.

Everyone “on board” now? Sold all your $177 stock and went short 4x (quadruple) what you were long. Will make back all your losses before noon. This is how you trade.

It will end sooner than you think because I have seen this kind of sell off before. It is too early to step in. I have to take a chance because it is hard to find PYPL drop this hard. I believe in what Daniel said."
Why are we down AH?
Maximum short PayPUKE  Anyone in at $309? LOL 
"Be honest anyone in from $215 fake crypto low volume new 52 week high, OR $192 this am on the Morgan Stanley fake upgrade? Just shorted more $177......."
"Great buy at this point in my opinion, getting more contracts. Good luck guys!"
SQ has better potential than PYPL.
UMA crypto synthetic token will take UMA 5000x !! the only synthetic Token will tap into the a 1quadtrillion market of stocks and insurance connecting defi cryptos at that time UMA will be 32k :))No joke the real deal is about to happen !!!
I see some bargains. SAP now has p/e of 25. PLD is 20.
The “person” who bought $183.50 will be addicted to crystal meth by the close
looks like last ER when we added 14%
Under $116 now. I'm a buyer under $115 if we get there today!
"If PayPal falls, I'll buy some more. This market is nuts."
I love when this stock goes up and SQ goes down
Nice moves this week $ENPH $QS $CHWY $PYPL $DDD $TWTR were a few of my best performers. $GBTC is Rock'n'Roll!! Looking for a big move north for $PLTR when it reports before the bell Tueday. Not priced for perfection. A weak pocket to be taken advantage. $RKT perhaps the best value in the entire market. Enjoy the weekend. Buy $PLTR after hours. Premarket on Tuesday may be a little late.
The Supreme Court ruling to legalize Sports gambling should prove a bonanza for Paypal !
Whole market buying more on good speech from MR POW WELL....Data-focused Powell says may take more than three years to hit Fed inflation goal...So there won't be any interest raise for 3 yrs from now.....this give high boost to stock market.....uptrend more...
Bought for a trade@251 sold ahr 267
What is up with the reiterated price target of 85 from Terracotta Investments today?
STRONG SELL!!!!!!
We just keep winning!
what's going on
"Time to load up. PYPL moves earnings date from Jan 25 to Jan 31, the same day with FB. It is very interesting to see PYPL number, I have to move the date back to Jan 30 to give some number 10 min. before closing."
one step closer
"Every partnership, big or small brings value to Paypal... just got news here in Australia that ""Gumtree"" ( an Ebay type company that's been around here for years ) is now accepting Paypal for buyers and sellers... Go Paypal !"
"It was a good week stocks considering the week before.PYPL seems to have settled down and is cruising along with the S&P 500 since the eBay news. That's basically what I expect for the next few quarters unless we get some upgrades, downgrades or unexpected news.I have a relativity small position in PYPL. MasterCard is one of my core holdings and I love the payments sector. I think PYPL has great long term potential especially in a couple of years when they are free from the eBay agreement. For now, I'm holding what I have and if we get a market correction that sends it in the 60's I will double down."
Stock has risen 10% this week on the prospect of the earnings news. Be careful overnight...
"I have both PYPL and SQ, but my thoughts are that SQ will outperform PYPL in the long term"
I doubled down my short from $211 when I came in here yesterday and read 100 posts how this was going to $230 after earnings; shorted more this am $177
"How would cryptocurrencies, whether Bitcoin or a Government issued one affect PYPL or V?"
$PYPL should buyouts STNE
"It looks like rotation cools off now. This week COST and ADBE will report on Thursday, both have great number, but does not mean they will pop up, particularly COST. ADBE is a good choice to pop up because it pulls back from the high. PYPL will make a move after New Year, or after Christmas if the market is still hot."
My prediction is this goes to $125 within the next two years.
"With the start of Holiday season, PYPL is going to explode up for at least the next 2 quarters. Should approach $100/share. Now is not the time to sell."
At least the buyback blackout is now over. Hopefully the company will provide support will all those dedicated billions.
"Hey Big you got a problem, V reports tomorrow and they usually kill it...Not only will PYPL go up under its own power but Visa will add to its climb"
Buy Buy Buy it's a no brainier people..

IT SEEMS MR BUFFET LOADING MORE ON BEATEN DOWN TECH STOCKS....
Lets go paypal ! Good luck longs
Very bullish! $PYPL
We've artificially reached Guggenheim’s Jeff Cantwell magic $104 price range. What’s the next fake news?
"uber up 8%, paypal stock up 0.3%.. seriously??:D"
"Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Xmax, post-Xmas all coming....may be the low point of the season for PYPL and a good buying op."
buy all dips. this is a fed backed one way market!!!
"I sold SQ today in the $77 range hoping to buy PYPL,but y'all ran it up to high for me now. :("
This looks good.
As more vaccines roll out ...more jobs will boost economy greatly like before the pandemic....Today 's jobless report is nothing...as vaccinated people need 4 weeks to fully immunity....buy on this DIP is a gift....
US liabilities vastly exceed assets. How can US be solvent?
"Which one better, PYPL or MA??"
"Ok so some info... I bought in at an average of 186. The RSI when I bought was at about a 32. I was trying to time my line when it kissed the bottom threshold of the bollinger band. I got in where I wanted to, and was a bit shocked it dropped to a RSI of about a 20 at one point. Right now the RSI is about a 45. I am pretty confident that next week we will see some peaks over 200, but expect a few days of sub 200 close realistically. From this point, I am expecting a 2 week window to at least a 20 pct upside though, pending any crazy news. Granted, if there is some huge news that comes out, it's all out the window. I feel like TSLA will sell off bad next week, and those funds will filter into other Tech plays, hopefully Fintech. :)"
Looks like we’re going to test new highs this week. Come on $220.
I think its up a buck and a half Thursday
gawdaaaaaaamn what a beat! Congrats longs!
Who buys when PYPL is down 1.50 is the winner today./
global economic collapse in progress. massive rate cuts in the offing. buy and be confident says all banks.
"Gave you PYPl at $35, now buy IIIV ! IIIV projects FY19 adj eps of .79-.81c , SQ projects FY18 adj eps .39-.41c"
"PYPL really needs physical credit card in order to create the complete ecosystem, just one more step that PYPL needs to encourage the customers to use it (incentive). I have confidence that PYPL will decimate the bank card and eventually AXP, AXP will be decimated because it is only used by the big corporation. The merchants avoid it because of the expensive cost. Another avenue will be with AMZN, which I think BEZOS SAYS NO."
"VENMO my bank account, Don please. Just do it, come out with PAYPAL credit card with VENMO logo. I think PAYPAL has enough BRAND power to come out with credit card. I believe PAYPAL can beat DISCOVER easily, then compete with AXP first then V and MA. BRAND POWER I think PAYPAL or VENMO both are good."
ATH incoming....
Wow...down another 0.98 after hours to 81.16
How PYPL is not above $100. The revenue and earning is around V and M. Hard to believe
Keep the good and steady momentum going PYPL!!
all longs have bought. banks now stepping up their sales of PYPL's stock into dip buyers. Baggies get ready for sub 75
"Long on paypal, will but no matter how far this drop goes"
Good time to buy at dip.99% to beat the earning by FOOL Analysis team.
Do I hear $2.80 for $TEUM ? We will have take off soon. Don’t miss it!!!

17% in three days ?
Explain how PYPL can operate in China against Alibaba and we chat?
Thanks to whoever turned the Algorithm back on.
"EBay just reported they are dropping PayPal as their financial partner as of 2-14-21 and will be doing it through eBay management, this can only hurt PayPal in the near and long term because eBay is a major major partner whom they dependedl on ! just wanted to inform you before the news hits the wire, and you take a hit on the stock ,"
$120 on its way
"Bond tumbles, it is good for the stock market. Wait for the market settles another day or two, it should be for PYPL and UNH. High earnings growth rate and high revenue growth rate both."
Speed matters... a lot
Pull back is just an opportunity with this stock...
PayPal just banned me for life today so I don't think I really like the stock anymore
Will eBay’s Earnings effect PayPal tomorrow? Thoughts?
So .....market is being a B
Pypl is Tesla of payment arena. Review earnings report and their new partnerships. fyi international relationships - awesome
TSNP $.021 is streaking up...The newest Mobile payment platform that partnered with Humble last week...Will be taking market share from PayPal and Venmo...A chance to get in on the ground floor...Led by former Fortune 500 CEO...this will triple by next week!
just bought more PYPL at $66.50. Good earnings report out Thursday
"Bitcoin compatibility seems to not be priced in, so its a go @242"
Take whatever the market maker gives me now. I like the index is green and PYPL is red.
"No matter the call, the analysts did not like the buying spree - overpaying for questiinable assets- which now puts pressure on earnings in near term."
"Lets have some fun , 10 years from now in 2028, what do you believe the price of paypal will be? Wild guess but I say $700."
Big bounce once this bottoms. 145 puts are paying off nicely!
buy any dip. feds will support.
PayPal boom!!!And grow up another 9%!!!!Gonna be a good day
"Year end tax selling ,and other negatives CV19,20 tump."
"Meh, I'm not convinced that this stock is going to make a run anytime soon. Would be nice since I own some. But, I'm not so sure here. SQ looks more poised for a run here. Also got some of that. We'll see."
whales/banks that bought well below 100 are quietly unloading above 100....quietly telling retail to buy. just ask bears sterns kramer.

"Okay, I wasn't clear........ Hold above $78!"
Big news about to pop this gem to the $120 range ........
As I write here over 2 weeks ago Paypal is firing on all cylinders.... onward and upward .... we’re gonna blaze past $100 and beyond this coming week .... and leave all the rest running for cover
That’s interesting Guggenheim downgraded it to a neutral they’re putting it on the sidelines
"When it was $189 I got to admit I almost covered, UNTIL I came in here and read 100 consecutive posts claiming it was “going to $200”. Right to $181 like clockwork"
reason for the dip?
dsmn...this #$%$ went to 76.68!!! glad I shifted more to paypal yesterday
This market has a crooked mind. Penalty on guidance ? It was a darn good qtr. and personally I don't have any problem with their guidance. It seems the same institutions who hold PYPL stock are the ones punishing it. I don't trust any analysts or institutions.
My Square is a much better company not even close $190 to $280 in like a week
commin' in hot on 200B cap.
"It's tuning up, volume is high...Good sign!"
"Guys, check BFT (merging with Paysafe next month), probably the hottest SPAC out there right now. It’s trading currently at 13.92, make sure you don’t miss the boat."
"#PYPL #TSNPBOOM - I can't post the link but just copy and paste this headline and read for yourself. LFG!!!""PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second-largest internet market."""
Nice watching kicking off into 300sLet us do it
"BABA, one trillion market cap 's down -4 % in pretrading today, which will pull the market at the open down at the opening...."
Part of this is a struggle between the old corrupt institutions and the new age of commerce and banking. The day is coming when companies like Paypal will trump old world banking.
Most under valued asset of all time is silver. Silver is also currency.
"PYPL should split their stock, Look what happened to Apple and Telsa stock. Both up big time any thoughts"
"very positive start, let`s see where it is on friday"
"SHEP. HERE.............................. If you have a large profit in Paypal and hope to leave it to your children someday, be aware that the D's want to take away the STEPPED UP BASIS of assets that are passed on when you die. As it is now, you children can sell your stocks when you die and owe no tax, but under the idea the D's have (and if they get the two Senate position in Georgia that will be able to do it) they will make your heirs pay the tax based on what your cost was."
This stock will plump back to 50
"Down the road this company will be liable for lawsuits with the way these guys are talking. Don't forget folks the company MISSED revenue and they are acting like PayPal is taking over the world. These are supposed to be company leaders, not used car lot salesmen. They are an embarrassment imo."
"Buy on the rumor, sell on the news. Typical reaction is that PYPL stock runs up to earnings and then pulls back after earnings are announced. When this selloff bottoms it will make a good entry point to start a position or add to an existing position. The only thing I saw wrong was that PYPL grew at 24% this quarter and 25% last quarter. Market overreacting to this. Also, stock buyback makes no sense. There has to be better uses of capital in a growth company. If current mgt can't find better uses, than its time for new mgt."
"Seems like every time we continue to hit a new milestone $50, $60, $70 we trade sideways for a while, consolidate, then make our trek up to the next milestone aka $80. I think the consolidation will be shorter this time and the trek up quicker to $80 IMHO"
Why the drop
let`s go
"Dave, the president is an actor. You know this, yes?"
"Nothing can help us, FUNDS HAVE ON SET ON 190.They will drive this down with everything they got."
"Love the way you do me, PYPL!!!"
taking bets on earnings. Up 30% is my guess.
"Anybody know what % of PYPL's sales are with EBAY? I don't see a problem here. Anybody that uses PYPL on EBAY now, will continue to do so. It's way overblown."
$90 on Friday
A bit too rich on the valuation side here and would love to know how many users have maxed out there PayPal credit without an ability to pay. They raised credit loss reserves by $237 million but will it be enough? No position currently but have a hard time believing this will go much higher.
anyone got in to GRWG wow what stock
Just a curious question. Since CRM and PYPLs CEOs seem to be close business partners. Could a possible BO of PYPL by CRM be in the books down the road. Like i said just curious. I am a owner of PYPL shares just for the record.thanks
New deal with Bitflyer! https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/78279/bitflyer-europe-paypal-integration
Venmo. Kick the Shlt out of Visa and MC vastly overinflated interchange model. Brick and mortar merchants would love this.
PYPL is trading above its upper Bollinger band. I'd expect a pullback to $109 in the near future.
anyone that has followed pypl can see a stock that will be supported and increased no matter what. all dips are bought and the stock is protected from sell offs. buy buy buy. new high nearly everyday for weeks.
I cannot see the future...... But i am expecting $75 - $80 by christmas.
Are these earnings bad?? They seem good to me...
"great way to end the week. To all my paypal friends, stockstradamus, trey, and og skywalker have a good weekend"
"In late December, I posted a 6 month price target of $120 for PYPL. As it turns out, we needed about 2 weeks longer than I thought to hit $120. I thing the move is played out now and it is a good time to write out of the money calls on PYPL. GLTA"
$215 - $178 in a weekWhat’s that gain longs?Going back to $25Too many choices now to pay.
boom
Just bought 300 shares!!! Why not. Life is short but I’m long on PayPal .
wow paypal!! great stock
"I have many friends and only one pal, Paypal."
Why didn't the analysts say anything when the stock moved upto 215?
$277-27510% off for PYPLI will buy more.
"If this opens down tomorrow i'm doubling my position again. I have a feeling it will be up though, but i sure hope it's down. Anything under 184 is a buy for me."
The volatility in the AF is unreal. This market is very nervous.
PayPal primed for $100. Grow and teumUp. Great day :)
I’m seeing 944k after hours volume. Is that right? It seems high.
$MARA taking off on BTC news.
It's tanking
What time is earning call? Uk
PayPal will advise how Walmart should do to compete with Amazon. This is really bad for Amazon. Stay tuned.
So what happens when consumers buy less “stuff” online?!
Good day. Nice gain.
Looking at volume and price action today we can surely say tha someone leaked the earnings...Don't doubt me!
C'mon PYPL you need to Break through that freakin $80!
"""Keep buying"" -Jim Bear Sterns Cramer"
"Amid what's going on with n Korea and the markets being down overall, PayPal holds strong. Impressive"
"$254? HUH? Really longs, really? $177 here we come"
"Allow the consolidation. Weak hands will regret it. AARK buy apparently a rumor, however they were purchasing prior to the run up... in perfect hedge fashion."
"From over 300$, now struggling just waiting for SQ to catch up to us ."
PYPL still waiting for my dividend! Where is it?
Wake up papal wake up-!!
"What ever has happened to LarrytheLegend... you know, the legend in his own puke??? He must be shivering under some bridge somewhere, licking his wounds as his belovedly pumped SQ has now lost over 18% in 6 days, as it hurtles back south to $200. Guess he’s gone back to his regular job of cleaning toilets"
"It's amazing how much better these comments sections are when we MUTE a few of the irrational naysayers (ie, Shorts) who desperately need to see this go down for no reason."
My barber has concluded pypl is worth 400 and has started pypl with a super strong buy with a go all in bias.
Did you miss the train folks.....?????hope not...
PYPL is facing increased competition for big players such as AAPL with their new credit card and the way that AAPL has structured it to keep the users on line and locked into their payment processes. There is more of this coming which could chip away at PYPL over time. My love is starting to fade for this stock even though I have done well with it over the past few years. Selling down about half of my holdings.
I’m no pro just another keyboard warrior but this coupled with the bearish sentiment will probably affect the price. But the reality is that PayPal will probably buy up most of the shares anyway.
First it was UBER Now its honey. Oh dear!
"Last week, I mentioned here that the upward move in PYPL appeared to be over and suggested selling call options on long positions. I was bullish on PYPL since I posted a 6 month price target of $120 in December. I was obviously correct about the move to $120, and I think the earnings report pretty much validated my current strategy."

"Donnie Pugatch, has doubled his positionin PYPL!"
Too hard to hold this down!
One thing people aren’t talking about... EPS .55 a share and this EPS is 19 cents a share HIGHER than any other quarter reported. Why is this significant? Because we are in a new level of earnings growth. Hard to understand why analysts aren’t pointing this out?
This needs to get back in the nineties!
Why would anyone buy PYPL when you can buy my Square (bought at $7)
Anyone think we could hit 2hundro today?
2% gain on PayPal and sold part of GROW today at a 10% gain. Great day!!!!!!!
core inflation is skyrocketing. pypl is clearly under distribution. total econ collapse progressing well.
are we having fun yet..... wheeeeee!
How many PYPL longs have a clue as to how ill- liquid the market will be without ongoing repo operations?
The past chart is very good
Hopefully we'll stay north of $68 this session... healthy showing in pre-market .... Long Paypal !
Anyone in @ $309+? Be honest! ROTFLMFAO 
$MGNI $PYPL $TWLO great end of year portfolio placement - potential for 2021 and beyond. Move some money to these winners with massive growth ahead.
Profits up a bit but revenues are basically flat. Maybe there are too many payment systems.
Its over sold time to avg up
pypl is super top heavy. slam packed with restless dip buyers nervously eyeing the 100 mark. implosion dead ahead.
Awesome beat on expectations. I think this massive increase in major partnerships is going to explode the stock's price in the future!
100 by nov expiration??
"looks not too bad from a chart perspective, maybe a call on PayPal?"
$100 stock by January 1 2019.
sorry I meant earnings
Very low volume today
Anyone here remember when PYPL was 300 and my Square was 189? Now take a little looksie 
Was as low as 122 in after hours.....now 137. Sweet!
where is Elon?
Time to let Kevin Fade away.... plse.
How this is trading at less than $74 is beyond my comprehension.
"Why is PYPL down 1% today? I thought the story read ""double digit growth"". So why is it down more than 1%??"
PayPal and Bitcoin going much higher!
Any news coming in..
Disappointing day
I guess the $350 price target this morning didn’t help! It’s going lower people $250 was forever high
Buy V or PYPL? Both look like sure bets for next year or 2 at least but since PYPL is younger co.does it have more growth?
PayPal doesn’t even have a tangible product to sell the closest thing they have is a debit card 
NASDAQ up $100 PayPuke deep red
Does anyone invested here have a timeline of say more than five minutes?! This is a long term investment. If you can’t be long then get out and day trade. Sheesh! Longs with patience will profit greatly with Visa.
"$WIMI $AAPL $PYPL quality stocks to buy the dip!  $GME dump before the next leg down, p&d is over! "
Venmo|uber.. it just keeps getting better!!
"kick ge out of the dow, and add PYPL. any thoughs"
Square can’t fade PayPal. Market pessimism can and will though....but it won’t last. $PYPL
I think whats really bothering the market is the combination of whats going on at the boarder with putting children in what amounts to be an internment camps and the trade war. If this nutbag is willing to torture kids (albeit they're not white which probably has a lot to do with it) how much farther will he take this trade war. Its looks like hes gone off the deep end. Markets dont like that. A mentally unstable POTUS is a bad thing.
behold the banksters begging retail to go long pypl by means of the media. must be massive whales long millions of shares looking to exit pypl quietly without collapsing the price. buy buy buy says bears sterns cramer.
Going all in on paypal tomorrow hoping to hit mid 70s after earnings wish me luck!
PYPL price is rising!
Let's get this to the magic $180 so the short fest can start!
should I buy more???
topping up
Way oversold atm.
"Every growth stock has been dumped after earning and PayPal is no exception, I don’t see buyers stepping in on the Election Day or rest of this week so my worry is that the stock will continue to do down.... support at 171, 165 and 150, let’s see which one holds"
This stock is going to the moon before you know it! $300 before the year ends!
BEATS BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM LINE. NAYSAYERS WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHORTS WILL LOSE THEIR REAR END TOMORROW (AS USUAL)!!!!
Apple announced users can use PayPal in App Store ... next domino to fall : Amazon to allow purchasers to pay via PayPal ? .... l'd like to see that ... Long Paypal !
"350 coming, hell 500."
Another huge over reaction!
I’ll be sad if I missed the bottom
Venmo will get spun off in next 18 months. Be interesting to see what distribution will be to shareholders.
"Short $211 & $192; plus HUGE puts expiring Friday, PLUS quadruple down my short position at $177 pre market. So simple."
paypal is set up for a breakout next week. will go over 76
Have you ever noticed that analysis always pump a stock when its way up but not when its down?Wonder why....
"The specialists are shaking the trees, Even better buys coming"
PayPUKE down $50 in 3 days! Nice stable stock you all own. Quadruple down short $177 haven’t covered a share still

Ya'll really let me buy this in the $250s today wow.
"This world is cruel, but also very beautiful."
"Nice, baby got her legs back!"
PayPal may make it to $1T before TSLA.
Nice! Profit takers beware.
"This will hurt short term but long term prospects still remain - Tomorrow would be fun - 60's coming, I believe based on new update - https://www.recode.net/2018/1/31/16957212/ebay-adyen-paypal-payments-agreement"
"Buying PUTS on PYPL their earnings expectations are VERY HIGH, even a slight miss and you'll be looking at another IRBT imo"
Earnings are May 7th...
PayPal reached an all time high at 129.22
Merge with SQ?
Come to Papa! $189 to $180. Will be $150 by Friday be patient shorts don’t cover
Easy plus making
"Only a reaction to Uber shares which are really meaningless for PYPL as it has too much cash. But, once more institutions will drive the price down to 99 or so, and then start buying. Classic market manipulation as usual. You can bet Golden Sachs and Citibank have their hands dirty as usual."
Curious to see what ARPU will be in 2021.
"Good company, great growth, overvalued."
100B market cap for a payment company??? US market is JOKE! $8.00 stock is trading at $84.00.
Will buy some extra too...burt first will listen to my favourite earning call music
This willGo higher ...
"Whats up with Zacks Investment, Yesterday they upped their rcomended on PYPL, today they lowered it"
Lol at people worrying about losing eBay in 5 YEARS. And it'll just be then not being primary payment option
One point up at least for today. I just want to know how many upgrades will pop up.
Closing at its highs always a good thing. Everyday the story gets better for PayPal. Arriba!
Paypal to Create Digital Identity on the Blockchain.
Welcome to the club 'beat estimations and go down'.
My Square only up $10
all this helicopter money and pypl / fake markets are flat and unable to rally.
Rumour big boy’s are buying and shorts are crazy! Merger with Apple Pay?
Taking my 3K I put in litecoin though paypal out and putting it in Paypal calls.
$957 million dollars in overnight trading made the huge price jump. Lot of online purchasing figures to go on for a long time. Good bye bricks and mortar.

"I have an equal amount invested in both PYPL and MA. Am about to sell all PYPL and buy more MA. Both great companies with the same gains, but MA just does it with considerably less volatility than PYPL, and that makes me more comfortable."

PayPal needs to stop sitting on their cash and make big investments! I feel they are too afraid to do anything!

"I still believe that tech sell-off is not done yet. So PYPL will not go any where in the near term. I think if PYPL does not acquire some assets this year, it may be a target itself. I like PYPL under 70, because of EBAY. PYPL needs to put more resource on VENMO. If VENMO does not grow reap and bow in the next two quarters, we may see PYPL UNDER 70."

It will probably drip to the 95 or there abouts again and then reverse for a double bottom reversal.
"CNBC (After Hours Buzz article) ""Despite strong earnings, PayPal issued weak outlook for earnings and revenue during the first quarter of 2018."" Also, eBay brought on a new payments Co. (they will now have 2 pymt options, Adyen & PayPal. However, when using Adyen you can stay right in the eBay website to checkout but with PYPL you can't."
Where's the volume?
I am long on PYPL but was wondering... why would a medium to large business use PayPal as credit card processing company when they charge over 2%? Normal credit card processing companies charge low 1-2%. I’m trying to understand what the upside is for using PayPal.
Going to hondo before you know it
What would happen to PYPL stock price if they started crypto conversions on their platform? Why hasn't the management team already provided this service assuming they could charge somewhere between a 1% to 3% transaction fee?
PayPUKE still $309+? Haven’t looked in a while.
"NXTD & TEUM thank you, what's next."

"I'd love someone to point to the ""bad"" in this report? I mean i've only skimmed it but everything looks up and good. What in the world. Is it lower volume, lower new users, no monitization of venmo.....lack of forward guidance? I don't see why this would be down 4% on these numbers."

PYPL is rocking today!!! GO PYPL GO!!!
"All I can say, is if your not buying on the dip, you may soon feel like a dip."
PayPUKE  down an even 20% in a week. Is that really a stable stock? 
You thought the last few months have been good? You haven’t seen anything yet. This really is just the beginning. PayPal is positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of it and there’s no end in sight. Digital is here to stay. Buckle your seat belts or move out of the way. https://apple.news/AnI5FzzkQQxyJ9v6yb-17MA
PayPal is down 5.46% to 254.50
PYPL will move sideway until pass Christmas. This week ADBE and UNH will have surprise move.
This will test low 80s
Brutal
volume 44 mil today? that's a lot of trading in 1 day for PayPal
sans private fed reserve intervention (feds are the only ones buying) then this market will implode.

My best pal. Pypl is in on 
I put $30K into PYPL. Why because I believe in what it can offer. No debt. Mobile innovation. Venmo. Partnerships with Visa and MC. Linked to China's largest search engine Baidu. List goes on and on.
"retail longs had better look at how huge the volume is on down days and how light the volume is on up days. its called distribution. btw, that was an emergency rate cut as the economy is in collapse mode. pypl has admitted as much and sq has confirmed."

When is the earning ?
The upgrades / price targets keep coming in!
"amazing how is is suggested to drop,,,,, I've seen this before and where the expert makes a claim so they can scoop it up at a lower price."

why is pypl not going up? bears sterns cramer screamed at us to buy pypl after it doubled in price.
Just a traders market for now
"Good evening $PYPL family! Check it out. APWC Very high revenues for only a market cap of $80M, free float $3M, Stock price $5.90."
PayPal may be good option for really long term but it seems it’s gonna fall down under 200
Missed the 164 dip
Whats the story with Paypal on March 29 and do you see a chance of stock change because some people may be leaving paypal or locked out of accounts? If they do anything to PayPal business accounts that are making money right before Spring buying season it will be the dumsheet move of the century.
PayPal not always quick money but it will be money
Looks like the last chance at <$300 shares. Yesterday was the shot across the bow as fair warning.

Long term yes. With recession around the corner (next 3 years?) There are better stocks to own...
Traders on the floor are still talking about the market will move up. Financial and tech sectors are the most interesting that will move higher.

who is staying long pypl prior to the dumpfest next week? are ya not selling your realestate too?
The day of earnings release. PYPL drops what a insult.

Inconceivable!
I could not have called it any better than I did on Sunday. Said we were poised to take off. How you like them apples Chuckie. Haha. PYPL is on da move!
"TEUM Up 10% And GROW up 15% today. But who cares. These 2 will explode over 2018. You guys need to get in now. I’m being honest when I say this. PayPal will explode soon, but please start a position in both $GROW and $TEUM. I own about 12k shares in each :)"
"search: google.de: go to ""subsidiaries of PayPal"""
Why isn't this available on $PYPL for purchase yet? DOGE
60% of PayPal revenue comes from EBay. These analysts are playing games. No company in the world takes a 60% hit to revenue streams and get a overweight rating. Imo.
Where is the bottom so i can buy some more? Can this go down to $250? My average is like 184.
This seems like a stock people sell for other stocks￼ That are trending I just hope they’re smart enough to return
how high can paypal stock go? i bought it at 106.75 and it's down at 105...
I'm pulling the buy trigger at the open.
PayPal is up 5.70% to 266.25
"This stock still has a solid fundamentals with rock solid earnings. PayPal was hyped up little too much leading up to the ER and pullback was warranted although it was overdone. Unless we get some good news, this will hold between $85 to $90 until next ER."
earnings reduced half a billion from 2Q to 3Q ...I don't think the earnings will be half of 2020 for 2021...good company but stock is overvalued so is square....this needs to go back to 130 or 150 range
"so where are all the upgrades at these fresh new lows? oh, thats right...bankster tools upgrade at near new highs. almost forgot about how wallscam works."
Anyone here old enough to remember when PYPL was $302?
"Been in since 17, just added a call at the dip because the vision is global and it benefits people. Thanks PayPal."
Nice 5 yrs from now another 200 percent
"In this current climate, good stocks that reported excellent earnings are slaughtered while fraud & bankrupt companies’ stocks soared due to trading. Don’t be silly & naive to sell in a panic but buy it to build your wealth for the long run."
Years of PAYPAL freezing accounts for whatever bogus reason. How is that working for yas?
PYPL should buyouts STNE while it’s still cheap
"why buy this, when you can buy TSNP?"
the bankers that are buying the equity markets have no risk in doing so as they are buying with money they have created from nothing...and they are fully aware of this fact. the retail/401 noob buying stocks well beyond any reasonable valuation bears all the downside risk and are being told to hold for the long term and do not fight the fed. it is this retail group that finances the entire charade by simply not harvesting capital gains. this is why bankers know that all gains are theirs to keep. the bankster has no problem whatever selling their entire equity inventory while the carefully trained retail investor can only think to hold and will only sell after all or most gains are transferred to the bankster.
silver is still free. pypl is far away from being on sale. how are the jobless going to benefit paypal?
nice free shares for me
Ahhh $teum Up another 1.5% today. Going to fly!!!
"What do we think for the coming week, can we hit 72-73?"
Pypl always lags behind shop and sq
Stocks are at a point where if you sneeze too loud they drop. Everything must digest in the days and weeks after so that the algos to react accordingly. I say this helps the stock. I say 160 in 18 months.
Does anyone REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?
Crumbling
"Time to squeeze the shorts is coming. I see at least 5-7 points up this morning. IBM is so so stock still can go up 13 points almost 9 %. Until yesterday 68 is over valued, today will be another story, It is as I guess, the management already telegraph the investors since last month, only the investors did not do homework enough. I TOLD YOU SO. 75 now is not expensive any more, also forget about overvalue too. By next quarter, I see PYPL around 80+. You will not PYPL at this point any more."
So close to all time high guys!
"Uffffff. That wasn’t nice now was it. Market has to learn how to play nice with others, otherwise get sent to your room for a time out. It’s all part of investing amigos, you learn to just take it all in stride. Today we begin again our march to $80. No holding this baby down. Arriba!"
"I love PayPal, I use it for shipping and ebay. I use Venmo every day. Great stock to own especially if you use the service."
PYPL could be ready to move. I also just got a tip about them from (http://bestpix.xyz)
PYPL will close at $1.80 or above. Fridays $1.80 call option is active
I just saw Kevin routing through my trash... he must have heard pick-up is tomorrow on my street.
the minute Cramer said he was buying is the minute I started selling
no way this goes up in this market. not a perfect report
Went from 1% up to almost 4% down in a matter of 10 minutes lmao.
"Option quote tomorrow, $88 put , expire August 27 . No bid , 5 cent ask . Haha . Those bought at 80 cent , it’s worthless"
PayPal reached an all time high at 170.90
Thanks again. I love PYPL under 80 from now on.
nailed it! thank you very much for dumping shares to me this week!!
"It's amazing to me how so many people think all of sudden the stock price will head back to the $90's after dropping to the low $70's only a week ago. Yes, they had a good earnings report. However when you have technical damage to the market and PYPL, it takes weeks of fighting resistance, backing and filling, and forming a new base to move up. I have no position and would like to go long PYPL, so maybe I missed my opportunity in the low $70's. But now with the good report, I think they will fade today's gap up and I can still buy in the high $70's maybe next week. I will say that Paypal is killing their competitor SQ, and it's funny to see SQ up this morning in sympathy with PYPL. PYPL is definitely the leader in this space, not SQ."
I'm out of PYPL for now. Just went all in on Disney.
I think Yahoo raised the price target to 208$
Pypl longs have warned at least three times that the gains in pypl will not maintain. all buying is bank propping to enable the whales to exit longs and enter shorts.
"PYPL is cheap now below 200. Load up while it's low folks, this is headed way higher in the long term. Take advantage while you can."
"between zelle being complete garbage and credit cards banning crypto purchases, only some more reasons to own PayPal"
PYPL will open at a new high. now shows $96.44
way to go PayPal....great growth.. what's that cut the P/E to now like 100?
At $270 I guaranteed PayPal would be RED by the close. Only down $15 since
"you can't sell now. you sell when it's green not red, buy when its red"
Consistently breaking resistance levels. The close is the test for $122.
"I know I heard mention of share buybacks in the presentation, I'd love to hear the # if anyone knows."
PayPal going to $65-$70 easily. Possibly by end of the year
Buy the dips not the rips
the force is strong in this one
My puts will print bigly tomorrow!!
Should be trading at 170!!! she will get there in 6 months
"Stop loss/limit triggers tripped apaprently. Someone fund or group made a major boof, is all I can say. Never let a machine (or blind janitor) manage your trading."
Consolidating before a breakout to new highs.
PayPUKE is going back to $25
"I shorted PYPL this week at 123 because I believe our economy will continue to come up short for several months possibly a year or two. Unemployment will run above 10% and spending will be decreased for months. I agree PYPL is a good company, but it is presently at it's highs and is ripe for short sellers."
I guess the CC is helping a tad.
Just another miserable day to be long PayPal just agonizing over all the taxes I'm going to have to pay.

"$PYPL is getting PUMPED, despite subpar earnings, and fabricate revenues....What a TULIP MANIA BUBBLE!"

Quadruple down on my short this am at 177 looking amazing and the gap was filled at 188 so PYPL is free to hit $150 Friday and $120 long term
Square is being pumped to pass the pal
"""Explosion!"""
Can someone enlighten me? What happens when Ebay drops them?? How can that be a good thing???
PayPal is up on a dream. Talking about 2021 starting crypto. Careful here at 213.07 ..this could easily roll down to 175 trump loss down to 145..
any buyers and at what price. I'm buying tomorrow on the open.
Sell now buy SQ don’t overthink it I did the same with buying GOOG rather than AMAZON when they traded at 1k at the time look where they are now.
"Try to use PayPal on eBay.de, a large percentage of German sellers only accept direct bank transfer. PayPal has done very little to penetrate this huge market and for many years now"

Stock is so over priced ...Going below a 100 Sell SELL Sell
Paypal Lost Ebay yesterday it is official stock going to 134 . Ceo is pumping stock will never reveal this or the fact they are laying off people .Sell Sell Sell
"Obviously a great company who smashed their earnings report. But there are still concerns about big things: (1) peaceful transition of this administration needs to happen. If Drumpf were to finally give his concession speech it would be a boost for PYPL and markets. (2) coronavirus cases are spiking to record levels and this could cause more restrictions; this should help PYPL stock but might not. (3) stimulus bill is going to be heavily debated/delayed causing potential economic damage and market selloffs, especially if bill is pared down from the market's expectations."
"Just read an article on moneygram being blocked by the courts. I've always wondered why people paid large sums to send money, when you can do it for free with PayPal. Don't want this whale too big, hackers will be all over it."
Are they fully monetizing Venmo at this point?
it will go back up tomorrow
I just bought some shares at 253

Imagine where PayPuke goes when Bitcoin crashes (and it will soon).
"I think the market will rebound today. It shows that everybody believe the economy is very strong, which I believe that S & P can touch 3000 this year."
SQ is better
PayPUKE  down only $10 in after hours LOL  Going under $200 tomorrow
Will test $104 tomorrow before $107 next week!! Long weekend always like volume tomorrow
GREAT COMPANY
They had some interesting insights about PYPL on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"or maybe Paypal buys Pagseguro PAGS, to increase presence in Latin America"
Why wasn't the buyback completed last quarter?
Square is down
motley fool just gave a buy recommendation for members
PayPal simply... too good.
Looks like we will finally break $66 next week
"fintech is a hot sector and growing, PYPYL, MA, V, SQ,, GS, will benefit"
THE LEGEND
"I would rather buy Apple with an 18 PE and similar upside expected, less risk 4 sure."
"it a locomotive gathering strength, teasing the 100. Once it breaks out and closes above, it will gap up to the 110 - 120 within days."
SQ will announce earnings tonight. Raised guidance last quarter !
What is your target resistance for the day?
Do you think eBay's managed payments will effect PayPal?
It’s so huge luck that I got it this stock with such a low value!!!!
TIme to go green! What fool sold on a great quarter
Wow!
WHERE IS THE ONE THEY CALL LARRY THE LEGEND? I'M COLLECTING BEAR MEAT FOR MY CHILI!!! HOPE YOU'VE BEEN EATING BLUE BERRIES.
"PayPal down more 1% as SunTrust favors Visa and MastercardCould this be more wrong, believe this and you will miss out."
105 by Friday.....shorts better cover....CNBC with a great story at earnings......Venmo huge growth....buy buy buy
pypl just sitting around here...waiting to breakout to over 110
"Even with Fabricated revenues, $PYPL the Mega BUBBLE misses extremely diminished expectations again!Paypal stock PYPL has $15.00 fair value right now!"
With crypto purchases available this is a rocket
102.90 is the 50 week ma. IF pypl goes to this level then watch the volume. High volume around 103 will confirm that the wales are distributing there longs and initiating new shorts. If pypl can not make it to the 50wma....either way pypl is seeking new lows.
Should I sell Baba shares to buy Paypal before earning ?
Lets see what the idiots at SUNTRUST say now... probable hiding in the closet!
Will hit $100 today.
How does PYPL drop like this. What is the reason for this?
Maybe is a good time to buy a put
I don't need the headache here. Not worth it to me.
"If you liked $215 last week, you have to love $179 now"
"PYPL should go up today again, which surprises me a lot. I don't understand the market. CFO of PYPL told media yesterday that PYPL raises the earnings to 52-59 cents that is over 30% from the estimates, which is a lot, plus the revenue will increase more than estimates. It is really amazing estimate raising. PYPL may pull back if the market is bad which I believe. But the market keeps telling investors not pull the money out because the bull market is not finished yet till the end of the year."
I'm confused. Don't know if I should sell or buy?
"It is fluctuate, it is violent, the stock itself is the one, which the day traders do not touch. It is manipulated by some big boys, the volume tells it all that some hedge funds try to stop "" BREAK OUT "", the other side tries to create the 'BREAK OUT "" SCHEME. The stock itself deserves to break out because the market seems to explode."
Starting to pick up! Possibly more good news coming. Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust will have egg all over his face!
148.21 10 day 30 min
Up up and away
Thin volume and going sideways. What is happening with this stock today?
Cheers to this afternoons buyers.... here's hoping we'll all be toasting a great earnings result very soon !
PayPal is being replaced around 2020 by EBay in favor of a European Company based in Amsterdam called Adyen. Adyen is not traded as I could find yet but im sure it will when put in that position with EBay. PayPal will still be offered by EBay but the primary method of payment will be Adyen. look for price of EBay to rise as this transition becomes a reality.
Slow grind to $100 a share in 12 months.

"If it hovers around $265 by 11it can go either way. Hold on until 11. I think being Friday and weekly option expiration, they'll keep the price around 265 today. They won't let it pass 270 until Monday."
"This price is ""NUTS""! Why? Because even after debt for acquisitions PayPal still will have at least over 8 BILLION in cash! That is nearly a 10% cash to share price ratio! This is starting to shape up as a potential acquisition target for one of the FAANG's, IMHO!"
a good target to short ... the charge fee is too high ... 0.65% for wechat ..

that fake taxi company...uber...just hurts to look at.
"I think PYPL will test high by next week. If big boys push PYPL to new high before earnings report, PYPL has a good chance to hit 85 very easy. PYPL will beat the estimate of its own."
coming to a stock market near you: limit down days.
IS not red now. Sold for a quick day trade @ 79.50. Very happy.
There is Harold. Shorting a stock and then crying for the hills trying to scare people and get them to jump ship and sell. He does this all over guys. Don't let him scare you.
PayPuke was $25 a few years ago who is buying 290 now? That’s not investing it’s a ponzi
End of day run up. $62+ after ER beat.
So why have pre-market if this happens +2.50 open markets down 2.50.
SELL PayPal now and Buy SQ LAST CHANCE!!!
PayPal bitcoin exposure is becoming a problem. It could be worthless in a Cyberwar. Also the original coding is suspect since it could have been developed by rogue elements.
"Paypal 'll be falling like rock as soon as more and more covid-19 vaccines rolling out across usa and worldwide, when shoppers are safe to shop at stores...no need online shop anymore....and so they 'll all withdraw their accounts from Paypal...."

Poor people who sold off yesterday
I think I will buy more pYPL tomorrow

PayPal is down 4.92% to 202.58
PayPal has turned into dead money. About ready to bail. Stuck at $90 give or take a couple bucks for months.
"Record bull run for e payment companies . The secular trend is there. i like Paypal, but even more bullish for payment company Qiwi that i can buy below its cash holding value that even grow faster with multi channels.

"Stated reading a fantastic book called Thank you for being late, Tom Friedman and about 1/3 of the way through. He walks you through the beginning of the Internet, where we were, where we are and where we are going. And how the speed of all this is at breakneck levels as Murphy’s Law now applies to all aspects of technology. Two companies that he especially singles out are PayPal and Autodesk as being especially well positioned as we move forward. Both are in the sweet part as per where we are heading. FWIW"
now the VP Pence is demanding rates be cut. Imploding economy plus rate cuts = massive stock rally.
This here PayPal...its so hot
"Good stock like PYPL will not go down much, I have a believe that PYPL will price around 78-80 before earnings report unless the market collapses. I think the market will pick itself up because of the bond sell off. The stock will have a big bang of earnings for the next two quarters."
"I started watching last thurs when it was 208. Now 230, should I wait for a dip to buy?"
nearly all that i know are coming out of the equity markets and going into money markets regarding their 401k. following buffet's lead.
"I made a correction on my first post but am not seeing it, merchant services charged me $700 not $70, thats more than 4 times less that SQ I had the same sales, maybe more in my second month. it was 0/interchange plus for anybody wanting to get it."
"There is no denying what we are seeing right now. Yields are falling faster than we can even imagine. $15 trillion worth of negative yielding debt is now out there and it's going up in a straight line. This is NOT, I repeat NOT a sign of a healthy economy. So what will happen? Well, something is going to break. Where? No idea. But when there are unknowns, that doesn't mean you should be complacent. It means you should prepare accordingly. The mentality of most novice investors is that they remain complacent and docile. Not a wise move."
PayPal isn’t going to be parabolic like square. Thats why you trade square and invest in PayPal. PayPal isn’t in its prime like SQ.
Way undervalued at current price$500 in 3 years
why amateurs are even selling at this point is beyond me. it hasn't even made it to the daily average yet -_-
Your on Pypl site pumping a $2.19 cent apto stock??
If there was a bounty on lawyers how much should it be? The bounty on coyotes out west is about $25 but a coyote is worth a whole lot more than a lawyer.

Just bought 789 shares (my lucky no ) cos of bitcoin and Jim Cramer. Hopeful 
I want to see $90 by EOD!
"Insane to trade this stock. Like the old adage says “traders make pennies Investors make dollars”. Fundamentally speaking, with the growth of ECommerce and online payments PYPL is ideally positioned and we are just in the early innings. IMHO"
Might add more here.
why is it tanking?
housing collapse may get us a 50 basis point rate cut sending stocks to ridiculous levels. buy now.
Where's Larry the Bum?
So how long will it take PYPL to make the 2B it just shelled out for this Co?
I really believe pay pal will 100% gain this year they are killing it on cash and everything
I hope this is not the trend for a stock that did well. I do not like price action and this might be a barometer of what to come. GFB if a company misses
So are we going to talk about it or keep our mouths shut....I'm talking about SQ by the way

"Printing and distributing is the craziest socialism there is. No one will get angry because no one will be asking them to hand out from their pot. Their wealth pot will lose value by the percentage of extra free printing of money and that extra printed cash will be distributed among the favored members of society. Check this out...if the value of wealth X is $100 on the pot and you Print another $100 out of the thin air....then the wealth is X equals $200 but take that $100 newly printed bucks....give $80 to your buddies businesses and sprinkle remaining $20 to poor saps, the rich buddies are happy and the poor saps are happy too because they both win. The only ones who are hurt are the ones who worked hard to save the original $100. Those Dollars are only worth 50 cents now. This is one of the greatest form of socialism there is and who better than someone like Trump to execute the greatest socialism in the history of this country. Can you imagine the anti socialists reacting if Obama or clintons were doing this? Only Trump can execute this kind of socialism peacefully. If Obama did this there would have been too many right wingers in capitol hills with their muskets."
Why this thing is going to 75$?
"Question is not how great a company is, everyone knows PYPL, GOOG, MSFT..et al... are great... it all comes down to valuation. It was unheard of that any stock gains 100-200% a year, unless it’s a Biotech that discovered a cure, or something breakthrough.... the valuation are ridiculous at this point. Return to normality or not...are we really in a better shape than pre-pandemic? Don’t see that even come close for years... this bubble is created by the Fed, will pop, just when is the question...."
You’ve seen the forever high $250 in PayPal

very very low volume pump today. expect pypl to drop 10 bucks post cooked books eps release.
Does anyone think that PayPal has not prepared for this and has no clients in the bullpen?
You all know that PYPL missed on top and bottom in their latest earnings call. I guess investors are starting to digest that information.

Trade PYPL after Christmas is the safe way. I still like PYPL because earnings is sure bet and the future is very bright.
"Nice for those holding. I could have, should have but instead got stuck with SQ. Embarrassment."
Come on $110.00!!
I swear I blink and nothings changed
Basically $71 which is awesome! Least you forget many powerhouse stocks have released great ER’s and the stocks retreated. Nvidia for one. So for PYPL now only to have held its ground but rise up 5.5% is truly remarkable. What we are witnessing here is a great stock and a steady determined march to $100. IMHO

"If there is really an outbreak of corona virus in US, the logical development should be: a. the forced increase of online shopping; b. the forced decrease of use of cash. And c. The forced bet increased use of PayPal especially due to its lack of offline presence so far. Why panic? So foolish."
too much competition and not enough inovation from PayPal. time to sell?
USA USA USA USA
OUCH !!!!!!!!That Hurts
how many of you are thankful for this 120 PE money maker. I am thankful to all for letting us cash out at this PE level. There might still be some FED juice left in this but i am happy to cash out.
Buy on open sell an hour later. Then wash and repeat!
Panic selling will accomplish nothing but locking in a loss do you really think pypl is going to take this lying down

That is the evidence that business is very strong."
$309 to $220 in a week! OMG 
I do a lot of buying and selling online I will tell you this if Paypal gives me any problem I will just open a credit card and use that to buy things instead and consider using other payment handling services.
we shall see 350 sooner than later!!!Load UP!!!!
love this company
Always sell at least half when going into earnings.That's what I've learned.
buy face book or paypal now?
what is happening?
can this market be any more fake?
Wow I can barely stomach this massive selloff!! Lol. $100 soon
Remember this PayPal staffer's name ... Devendra Tivedi. He and other key staff in India are going to make PayPal one of the important players in this exploding market. See my other post for the 12x increase for Paypal revenue in India's market.

Back to ATH!
It may pass 310 rangd
Maybe silver shots past 20 after the emergency rate cut tomorrow.
What I find funny is all these clowns predicting pullbacks  PayPal already had its pullback and traded sideways for August. Looks like now we are taking the next leg up 
Glad i sold at 89 and some change bought in at the ipo
RSI at 25? Don’t it goes below 20 which would put the stock at around 78 or high $77’s
"Buy more on this one time opportunity DIP as BITCOINT 's UP over 50,000 again today ...and continue further as TSLA buying more BITCOINS as well with many other blockchain companies...."
PayPal just can't get any respect since e9bay announced it was going to other payment processor. Been dead in the water ever since. Can't see what's going to change that at this moment.

why use paypal to pay for anything when one can use visa (rewards/cash back) or crypto (very beginning of payment paradigm shift)? Using visa for all ebay purchases for cash back. Lovin it.

Almost time to take a long position. Enough buy pressure this could easily hit 245 in a single day.
There’s that resistance I was talking about at $83.30 we need to break that.
"Not trying to pump here, but this here PayPal,,,its a tsunami...see ya at 2bills..peace"
$PYPL P/E is above 100. It takes 100 years to get return on investment.P/E and all valuation multiples are being ignoring.

Non-GAAP EPS $0.55 expectation was $0.52
Analysts are good for one thing....to churn stocks with useless chatter. Brokerages love them because they create buys and sell which in turn creates income for brokerages. News like can Micron go higher or is the rally over for Amzn.. Think about it.
"Someone will get hurt, because of the bitcoin. LFIN moves 100 points just take over ZIDDU. IT LOOKS MORE LIKE TULIP TRADE NOW."

"Retails stocks have fun today up 6-8 %, which I don't know how they value that kind of stock. The big boys just take the tech sector to have a hair cut. Don't worry, just a week or two, after that they have to come back and look at the earnings again. PYPL has a lot of advantage and surely earnings will beat estimate. So I don't worry much for the big picture. It is a melt up for PYPL. Big holidays sales even benefit PYPL, because everybody uses digital payment. That is the reason why I bought PYPL this morning."

Wow bitcoin is hot almost overnight. 4 different types of bitcoins trending. Riot and mara soar this week. Eman adma after 60 minutes sunday. Prty wtrh possibly mark though it could go either way with explosion of both calls and puts.
Slowly crawling back up. Definitely a knee-jerk reaction after hours.
"All these clowns saying they bought in after hours at 74 and sold at 79. Yeah right, i believe you. Conference call starting now."

"@JimHarris -- ""PYPL hands-down better than SQ"" -- Hey, Jim -- then why has PYPL been losing substantial Mkt. share to SQ over last two months .... and on an equity side SQ return has been +246% and PYP has been +86% ..... SQ has a return of 3X PYPL .... any thoughts? Capish?"
4 day rally coming to an end. I WOULD Sell above 90.
Let the lemmings sell. Smart money will move in and take shares from them
"oh wow had cancel my buy order I had in over a month at $268, I can get them now even cheaper in premarket"
Buy the rumor sell the news.
PayPUKE $309 to $285 with no bottom in sight
When is it 3:30?
Who bought $255? My god lol 
Beat every aspect but not big enough. I still have to keep buying if it drops a lot in the morning. Growth rate is still intact. It will be around 80 for a long time.
It seems some big blocks will come late in the afternoon. The market makers suppress the price early so they can gather the shares for some big boys. I see no good reason that PYPL going down early this much. It is the same script that I have seen before.
look this up on youtube: Insiders Are SELLING Stocks At Fastest Pace Since 2007! Huge Warning Indicator.
It’s not even down 33% in two weeks and people are complaining
yeeesh this stock is doing nothing
$184!!! Holding strong $177 short!!!
"when a stock earning comes out better hope they aren't good so the stock will go up, happen to many times for me"
why is this tanking?
"Paypal made people see that Bitcoin can be a practical real life reality. FTFT continues this progress. FTFT created the first and only e-commerce shopping mall accepting crypto currency. They also are continuing to acquire investment companies in tax haven areas (currently HK, Indonesia/Singapore, Dominican Republic) so they can provide a safe place to stash and wire cryptos. Apparently 20% of cryptos are hacked or lost so this is a needed solution. They also have a real estate division that is expert in crypto related real estate deals and last week received 10 patent approvals in crypto blockchain security."
"Yeah, this was the final straw for me. I cancelled PayPal and just use my credit card to order online now."
"SQ and IIIV, best payment systems going forward imo. IIIV just projected FY19 eps .79-.81. SQ says FY18 adj eps .39-.41c"

the stock goes up 3 bucks plus yesterday and suddenly we have articles about financial magazines like barons downgrading it potentially because of all the problems in the world. why am I not surprised? anything to sell their rag magazine. most of their analysts don't have a clue as to what's going to happen tomorrow Ludlow next year.
Are earnings today or tomorrow?
"PayPal: Growth on SaleBY MarketWatch— 2:43 PM ET 10/21/2018PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) shares have sold off sharply in the recent market correction, bringing its valuation down to more reasonable levels. Meanwhile, the payment company's growth story just got more compelling.PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) reported solid quarterly earnings Thursday. Revenue rose 14% from a year earlier, slowing from 23% growth the prior quarter, but this was largely due to the sale of a loan portfolio. Excluding this, revenue growth was a robust 21% , in line with the pace of previous quarters. Earnings per share rose 17%, beating analyst estimates, and the company raised guidance for the rest of the year.At the moment, this growth is mainly driven by increasing use of PayPal's ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) convenient checkout button to pay for online purchases. PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) doesn't break out how much of its revenue comes from this channel, but MoffettNathanson estimates it accounted for 86% last year. These analysts aren't worried about excessive reliance, though, figuring that checkout- button volumes can keep growing by 20% a year for the next three years.On Thursday, PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) also provided fresh disclosures showing that it is gaining traction on other revenue sources important to its future. Braintree, its payments-acceptance platform used by merchants like Grubhub(GRUB) and Stitch Fix, processed 1.64 billion transactions in the third quarter, up 33% from a year earlier.Most crucially, the company is making progress figuring out how to make money (https://www.wsj.com/articles/paypal- show-me-the-venmo-money-1517501786) on Venmo, its payment app that is popular with young users. Chief Executive Dan Schulman said 24% of Venmo users have now used the app in a way that generated money for the company, a so-called monetizable action. That is up from 17% in the second quarter. This includes using Venmo to pay for goods and services from a merchant, ""instant transfers"" of Venmo balances to users' bank accounts and uses of the new Venmo-branded debit card.The company gave no details on how much revenue it is earning from either Braintree or Venmo--disclosures that investors would appreciate. But the figures it did cite are enough to demonstrate that PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) isn't just a checkout- button story.Before reporting Thursday, PayPal's ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) stock was down 17% from its September high, wringing some excess optimism (https:/ /www.wsj.com/articles/why-paypal-investors-felt-shortchanged-1532599200) out of the valuation. It now trades at 28 times forward earnings, in line with its average multiple since becoming an independent company and down sharply from 37 times at the start of this year.The recent market selloff has hit many payment stocks--a particularly highflying corner of the market. But PayPal ( PYPL Loading...Loading...) is no Square, which still fetches 105 times forward earnings (https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-its-less-hip-to-be-square- 1539095847). This pullback creates a rare opportunity to snap up an exciting growth stock at what is now a reasonable price."
PayPal at 297.77 funny take any profit
the report is strong. why is after hours down 5%? is it the extended ebay agreement.
"Oh, I get it now FB hits a wall and the world ends. LOL"
If earning beat by a milestone then we will see $230.00 on ER day!!!!

Didn't Paypal purchase a ton of Bitcoins earlier this year?
It looks like it will break out tomorrow... a new 52 weeks New High.
Traded to the bottom of the 20 day 1 hour. Even lower than I thought it would go! Someone realllllllllllly hates you small time retailers.
oh oh.......
eBay is leaving Paypal for another transaction provider. It's about time!

I've bought under 180 and sold when it passes 200 3 times in the last few months and on my to the fourth time.
How do I buy aftermarket close
Keep kicking yourself and trying to rationalize why you are in PYPL and not SQ. SQ was an entire ecosystem what does PYPL have? A card you can pay with if someone sends you money? And a way to check out on a site faster rather than using your CC. Sounds like a moat to me!
Headlines on Bloomberg say eBay switched payment processor to Adyen. Not true. Also basically the same on CNBC. Guess in this day of so much fake news one should not be surprised. I believe after the truth sinks in there is a very good chance we get some of this back tomorrow. But the uncertainty it creates will stiffle PayPal for months imo.
Under $155 today...for sure.
Earnings leaked out. Must be good. go PYPL
"Way overpriced, this is a 130-150 stock."
why dropping ?
"thanks for letting me get more at 69.98. appreciate it guys, really. now I'm going to hold til next year"

It's going to end up like Netflix. Back to 80 by Monday
PayPal consolidating and moving up slowly on its way to $80 :) the best stock out there. Old reliable!!
Holiday Season around the corner. There are only two fintech stocks and that's it. Buy SQ and PYPL. Two global processing providers MA and V. My choice PYPL and V
Phillip sold to early on first trade. Back in @80.00. Thanks for the reply JIM.
Anyone who has owned pypl for some time knows this after hours drop is irrelevant. Expect a quick recovery.
What is happening?
On Thursday PYPL will take a big dive. No way around it after the net income hit. It doesn't seem to matter if there are good solid reasons for the decline. When and if it recovers will soon be known.
Next month i hope things get a lot better. This is round two. The sale continues...
Already under opening trades. Question is is it gonna be a hollow green candle or a solid red candle today? I’m going with a solid red candle
"more pypl shares for longs at 110, 115, 120, 125. Please buy."

Billions in business loans Paypal did and pushed repayment into July are coming.BILLIONS in losses.Ondeck - their main competitor in the space - was just sold after running for 15 years.HUGE bad loan balances r on the balance sheet and will hit Q3.
Its a beat!
high volume close under the 50dma. very rare. very negative.
What is a good buy point? News article says now is not the time to buy. Any ideas?
"Far right nut cases are almost identical to the far left in their belligerence and selfish behavior. Fortunately this country is being run by moderates, extremists don't have a chance. PYPL will be back in a day or two."
https://www.dawn.com/news/1463195great news for Paypal! Pakistan government actually chasing PayPal for it's services! Global expansion is under way- we haven't even scratched the surface. Lately I've been seeing a lot more government services starting to use PayPal.
"Ok ladies and gentlemen, we are now getting near, I believe, a tipping point. It has been brought up before that Paypal may be a possible acquition. The card companies, banks, and even Google have been thrown out as possibilities. While I agree that Paypal may be an acquisition target, my belief is that it may come from private equity firms wanting to take Paypal back private. Ridiculous you say. Not so fast. Paypal was a private entity right after it was spun off from Ebya. Why can't it be again? After all, all it would take is for a bid of say $85, a nearly 16% premium at today's closing price and then the company and its new partners could go back to being a private concern without having to worry about stupid, idiotic, market manipulations like yesterday's closing absurdity. I would gladly sign up with any equity group wanting to make that deal. Imagine not having to worry about losing market share in one day what a month of great news has brought us. After all, the financials for Paypal have not changed one iota but we see this drop because of a bogy man mentality! $85 too cheap you say? Well at least the financial world could then make a rational argument and decision on Paypal's true worth instead of keeping the share price low."
Like it or not PayPal and square have linked themselves to Bitcoin. Fundamentals won’t matter if Bitcoin takes hit.
love using visa for the rewards and credit building when given the option tween payal and visa. zero rewards and zero credit building with pypl. why use pypl again?
PLZ SELL SO I CAN BUY
Loaded More!!!Lets go back to 300!!!
Why the recent Guggenheim downgrade to SELL. Crazy...
All time hi d�#$%$}heidz!
gonna be a new record soon. Bitcoin going up over the months has helped PayPal alot
"Looks like the two weeks prior to end of March was the low for many stocks. PYPL got down to the eighties and today it is over $150. It was scary looking back even for a patient long and everything was down significantly day after day. I stayed long and just lighten up on my stock portfolio just a little and nimbled on some stocks. Picked up some MA, MS, RDS-B with dividends and still hunting. God Bless and stay well."
Money seems to be moving out of big caps and into small caps these days. Mogo may just become the paypal of Canada and is breaking out.
It will break 150 today. Wait and see.
Hard to believe we're not at $63 by now in after-hours.
Cramer fawning all over PYPL with its CEO on Mad Money. Could not have been more emphatic that not only is the stock going much higher but we are in the very early innings. Online payments is such a huge and exploding market and PYPL is in such a strong leadership position that JC equated the “A” word on them. Amazon-like ..... to the moon Alice!
"apple releases ""venmo killer"". next day paypal up 2%...lmao"
Anyone know whats going on with PYPL? Why the stock drop
"I bought in at 38 a share... to put it plainly, Pypl isn't done growing. The tech revolution is only in adolescents..."
the economy is collapsing ladies and gents. rates are already too low so no help whatever from rates cuts. pypl has told us to greatly reduce expectations.
let's see if we hold up over 77 today and avoid these morning sell offs of weak hands chasing gains in other stocks.
Those numbers were put up with one hand behind back
you can now send money on FACEBOOK messenger using PAYPAL.....That's huge said Donald !
We hit $74! Roll on $75 amigos :))
Remember NFLX?
PayPUKE  has to rise 12% for longs (wrongs) to break even from 3 days ago LOL 
"2020 full year EPS guidance: From the 2Q report in July: - PayPal expects GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow ~25%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow ~25%.From the 3Q report today: - PayPal expects GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 37%–38%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 27%–28%.The market's reaction today stinks."
GET LOADED UP AND READY FOR LIFTOFF  PYPL & LIVX
$171-172 looks like a good entry if we get there.
"Why do all these companies have a dip at exactly 12:12? One big player selling? roku, sq paypal all dipped at the same time."
PayPal vs Adyen vs Stripe. Go!

"IPAY etf that has most financial tech, GPN, MA, PYPL, V, SQ ,and more. GLTA."
Nice close above $71 on a down day. Should be climbing again this week. Roll on to $80 baby!
"I started getting fed up with this stock after it went down to low 70s. I thought about selling at 76-77 only because I was watching other opportunities pass be by. But I didn't. Mostly because most of it was a short term buy and I didn't want to pay taxes o a short term hold. Almost a year now and will make a decision. If this goes over 90, I might let it go. Probably dumb idea, but ..."
"Squeeze out of the weak hands in the morning, make me run to the door too. Now I come back when every body comes back again. Crammer just said good thing about PYPL, that makes me think to come back. This morning I saw the tick ran 72, which I think It is possible that PYPL will run again on Monday. Now 70 looks cheap. I TOLD YOU."
"Despite subpar earnings, Extremely Overvalued $PYPL BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!"
BOOM baby

Million shares in the last 15 min ofregular hours

bullish think 
"Watch out for Friday morning, I believe that PYPL will shoot up over 70, because I observe the premium of Call 67, is over 1.50, it is very expensive compare to the stock that is dumped for profit in the last 3 days. I TOLD YOU NOW, BUY PYPL."
Better get in to VGA C now Before it acquisitions tomorrow Going Through the roof
Kevin how’s your short doing
and eBay is up 14% because why?
Lots of competition coming
"PYPL CEO is incompetent when it comes to communicating with the market and what it should do to support the stock. Last earnings, they release info about an SEC investigation the day after earnings, which they knew about for a good month before. This time out they announce a deal with Visa without supplying any data about how they project the deal affecting earnings. Every time they report earnings, they introduce new uncertainties. The CEO also fails to recognize that this is a financial stock, and should have a dividend like all of it's main competitors have. Hopefully he will learn, but until then, it's amateur hour at Paypal."
marcel...you know pypl only goes up. buy the dip! bearsterns cramer has told us to buy
"i bought 5 $185 put contracts before the bell....... if these numbers stay same by tomorrow morning, i'm swimming in cash."
3 reasons Guggenheim upgraded:1. They are used stock salesman2. They have received an order to sell millions of PYPL shares.3. They are distributing high from lower prices.
Yes once we close above 80...85 will be the next wall 90 before ER and 96 after ER pop...dnt chase it.
SQ is innovative PYPL is the copier
"UNH or ANTM pick one. Today is very good time to get health care provider this cheap again. Forget about the BS that AMZN will do health care, IT IS NOT THAT EASY!. The analysts just laugh out loud that ""EASIER SAID THAN DONE """
Wonder why the pre markets have this price dropping...
$SQ will eat Pay Pals lunch
I like Morgan Stanley saying that PYPL at this level will NEVER look this cheap again. I agree. People who bought in 2017 at any level will look back years from now and think how lucky they were. 
Every rise is met with strong selling.
oh no...tanking
Down more than sq today and down a lot yesterday while sq was up 10%
Everyone talking about SQ today....yeehaw! $SQ $ROKU $PYPL
"If you like PayPal Check FTOC merger with Payoneer, today"
"Please stay below 75 before I get the next pay check, thanks!!!"
pointless to sell here / market maker needs to cover short don’t give a single share mostly buyside in after hours
What the heck? MercadoLibre UP NEARLY 11% and we only show less than a 1% price increase for Paypal? By my rough calculations we have added nearly $408 million since Paypal acquired shares earlier this year. This is a serious attempt to keep Paypal stock price DOWN!
These stocks options premiums only for sell:PYPL/SHOP/MELI/SQ/NFLX//
Say what now?...........
Told you’s 100x buy Square short PYPL......
Payoneer which recently begin to apply for a payment license in China and the local competition such as Lian Lian and Ping Pong will erase PYPL in China.

Selling with a greating earning is unsustainable. Believe this is a great buying opportunity.
everything bought just above 101 was DUMPED at just above 102.
Goldman to the rescue!! Amazon will NOT effect PayPal. Visa or MC
PayPal poised to pop gang! GROW now up 6%!!!
"just bought again, have waited so long to buy back"
"paypal will keep riding the pandemic, but once it's over, this company will go down hard. they are literally pickpocketing sellers to increase their own profits, they will go down along with ebay, as sellers are really looking for alternatives due to the constant, new rip off policies. ebay, paypal's mommy and main client was struggling in the EU, as sellers were leaving the site because of the sh*tty customer service, high fees and constant fraud and now the newly intoduced pickpocketing policy by paypal. i'm using both companies for 6 years, but the supply had never been as low as it was between last November and February. The 2020 balance sheet will look fine due to the covid and pick pocketing, people will push it up as well, but the first quarterly report after the end of the pandemic should be the selling point."
PYPL forward p/e exploding upward! Last chance to liquidate above 90.
"This is what it looks like when everything comes together. Earnings, deals, analysts, sentiment etc.."
Will someone tell me why anyone would buy bitcoin at a 3.5% cost then you can't bring any BTC into your account and you cannot send it out? What is the point of that when you can buy it for much less on an exchange then transfer and sell hit much higher on another exchange. Why bother with paypal?

"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) : Cramer sat down with Dan Schulman, president and CEO at PayPal (PYPL) , the payment processor that aims to conduct over $100 billion in mobile payments in 2016. Schulman said that PayPal is on track to be a leader in mobile payments. The company had more than $1 billion in such payments on Black Friday alone. He was also bullish on Venmo, PayPal's subsidiary, which is rapidly becoming the way millennials manage their money, Schulman said. Venmo is expected to conduct $20 billion in payments this year.PayPal is also hard at work creating new partnerships with the likes of Visa, Mastercard (MA) and other traditional payment processors. Schulman said that while it's still too early to judge the results of these partnerships, he's encouraged by what he sees.Cramer said that PayPal is undervalued, given that it's one of the few companies that offer investors real growth."
Jeff Cantwell drives the stock down for a lower buy-in point! These analysts are all so transparent. Put 'em all together and make duck soup.
PYPL is nearing serious resistance. A gambling man may want to trim a bit near its 52 week high in hopes of buying it back in the mid 80s.
"With Apple, Amazon, and Google entering this space it may be time to take a hard look at the environment PYPL is operating within. Are they a take over candidate? Will they have their market taken over by big Tech? If the big Tech companies are going to be successful at financial transactions, and they will, then companies like PYPL won't be able to compete. I am going to consider getting out of my long position here given what is coming."
PE is too high. Banks are up.
Glad I shorted this
Closing in FAST on Visa Card!!!
$5 is the share price of the world's largest bank DB. Not one shred of news about this bank failing. Not one.

EXPLOSION!!
Disappointing day for PYPL especially with my other stocks having a blowout day. This stock will move when you least expect it. Probably some big announcement so hang in there
http://alph.st/ba9efb94 I would prefer $PYPL than $EBAY. This company is not diversifying its businesses like $AMZN
Buy these record highs as the global economy burns. what could go wrong?

don't buy it cause I own it and everything I own goes down
"Anyone want to see where PYPL is headed look at FSLY, bad earnings like PYPL was $140 or so, fell to $93, everyone was buying, that was last week, hit like $60 today. SO if PYPL follows suit, it should hit $150 by Friday"
PAYPAL GOES TOO FAR. Youve condemned those who organized to go to Rally and have no proof that they did any of the damages. Well there are other payment sites too!Im a Conservative and I own PayPal. Hotler tactics judging guilty with no proof!

Haha @ shorts. You lost money

"it is highly doubtful that the Chinese will embrace pypl's policy of freezing accounts, putting holds on funds..indefinitely, and banking of of float. not gonna happen."
Consumer spending is up 5Xs expected. Banks are up 25% over last year. Aren't credit cards and PayPal the benefactors? The stock market is crazy.
"Looks like it is entering breakout mode. This is a company with REAL earnings. Not buying on the come so to speak. Whose clients (of which I can proudly say I am one) are very sticky and not going anywhere. Besides it’s a pain in the butt to change. Plus every time you add a new user you actually are adding several more because they will bring in their contacts to share PayPal with. No need for routing numbers, bank account numbers etc. No security issues. Simple and safe. And with their stranglehold on Milleniums their future is great. A no brainer investment if you ask “moi”"
Investor Day must be going well.
Error message on EBay not allowing checkout using PayPal. Called EBay and they said last quarter of the day they experienced this issue and should be resolved tomorrow a.m. 5/20/2019 22:23Message error: “Please log into PayPal to verify your account”

"For external transactions, once a user passes a threshold of withdrawing more than RMBY20,000 (US$2,897), a transaction fee of 0.1% kicks in. Merchants are also charged a fee of 0.55% on the flip side to every purchase"
"The blind cannot see, the deaf cannot hear, and the fool is both blind and deaf for what he sees and hears and misinterpreted. Paypal had its best quarter during COVID-19, travel restrictions and declining incomes. The stock has far more potential, go ahead sell. In two years this company will one of the few companies which will double what its worth today. It does not matter for Paypal if orange man wins or sleeping Biden."
Might be selling my share soon.Only when SQ shares drop a bit.

So sad that this stock is starting to rebound. Bought in at $175 but didn’t get a chance to make a full position
So what it will recover
"Cramer said on Mad Money tonight that he thinks PYPL will go MUCH higher. Also in an article in The Street, he talks about a new FANG quartet of stocks forming and he lists PYPL as one of the four. Vis a vis the de facto leader in ECommerce, which is exploding. The story can’t get much better but some people are scared of success and a winner and won’t do anything even when it’s staring them in the face as PYPL is doing. Pity."
Time to buy!
Support at $93. Last 1st highs of $93 will serve around the support of this coming lows before exceeding higher than $120.
I figure that your chances of actually catching Coronavirus are around 2%
PayPal will end the week around $194... better bail
300 today so ez
This stock is the pits
Shorts and sellers came out of nowhere. I'm still holding PayPal :)
Feel bad for people buying $pypl here when $ftoc let alone $bft will replace them
"Pypl should buy mogo before it goes higher. I own both, but really like what I see going on with mogo."
"I said it last night does anyone believe that management did not prepare for this and have clients in the bullpen? If not, what does that say about PayPal management?"
‘Bout friggin’ time!

"Nice bounceback for the PYPL....niice. I was kinda ""perturbed"" yesterday, after hours... LOL."
Is it MGI and BABA failure to merge or what. It got to be big otherwise PYPL will not pup 2 points.
why is it dropping today?
"Time to short it, strictly as a trade. It's up 50 straight points. Target is $268, then cover."
I never invest on what Mad Cramer says....please
Why can't this stock make a move up and hold it?
Paypal has become like a mutual fund. Owning portions of UBER and MELI. It's a little concerning when income comes from outside investments.
PYPL and the equity markets: it IS different this time. BUY LARGE!
PYPL all over ESPN on the Phoenix Suns jersey. 1 of my fav jerseys in the league lol $$$
"PayPal Up a fraction, $teum Up 4%+. It’s going so much higher!!! Get in now gang!! Stay tune."
"I truly believe that Venmo has the potential to turn PayPal into the next Apple. Venmo has made cash irrelevant in person-to-person transactions, which isn’t surprising, as paper money is incredibly inefficient by comparison. With Venmo you never need to wait for someone to hit the ATM or make change, and there’s never any payment disputes because the app automatically records transactions on both sides of the trade, (blockchain?!)The question is, how does PayPal monetize Venmo? Management has talked about opening the platform to businesses and earning revenue from transaction fees like credit card companies. This is a potentially huge source of income, as I believe people would quickly adopt Venmo for business purchases for the same reasons it’s used for p2p transfers: efficiency and convenience. Eventually Venmo will replace debit/credit cards as the #1 payment form, because why wouldn’t it? I already use my phone for everything, why not paying for things? As Venmo takes off, people will start holding cash balances within their Venmo account, rather than immediately transferring money to their banks. This represents another novel revenue opportunity in the form of the interest PayPal could earn on these cash balances. Given the billions of dollars in transactions being processed through Venmo today, the total cash balances held at any given time by app-users must be enormous.Thoughts?"
"Fed just announced $500B short term funding. If there is more drop, QE is supposed to be on the way, then paper money becomes less valuable, so investors need to convert the cash into assets immediately to hedge this possibility."
Under $255 today...

"So strategic investment gain is because of mark to marketaccounting, seems like a mixed bag of regulations to me."
"Adrian, Venmo is no moat. Cash app is stealing that lunch. The younger generation is on cash app due to boosts. Again, what is PayPal moat? No one can give an answer but cheerlead PYPL. Money can be made on this name both ways short since $118 I didn’t think it would make it back to $120 a second time before ER. Really want to know the moat?"
That's more like it. All my stocks now green. Hope it holds
Great jobTomorrow we continue
Thought this would go up today
This thing wants to run...a caged cheetah.
Will PayPal continue to go up?
$200 in 20 minutes
There goes GROW!!! Right on cue :)
Qiwi out perform PayPal by a wide margin and grow faster with a small baseline in the payment space.
Should we sell some PayPal tomorrow before earnings or hold it? On CNBC options action they said a bunch of puts were bought thinking it’s about to go down below 90 again
Has anybody checked PayPal’s reviews lately lmao I think people only use it because it’s the only service other than square!
They had some interesting insights about PYPL on http://stocktip.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
panic over we will be green tomorrow
Dude the news about PYPL loss/notice is more annoying than spamming
Do PayPal subscribers have a peise of the PayPal stock or do they have to buy in
PayPal isn't getting eBay transactions starting next year. isn't that their main income?
"I don't see it down at the moment on Schwab, but glad I didn't pay $116."
PayPal attached at the hip with Bitcoin!
bears sterns cramer is screaming buy buy buy!!!!

Just shorted PayPUKE up a penny
yep. the banks are certainly distributing millions of shares. selling higher that which was bought lower.
Paypal %NGN +2348183741873 high and maintained lead over others. Stabilise more like this for yield to and from currencies market
"Sorry guys my $85 call I made yesterday was a little bit off. Also wrong about propelling some of the other fintech names, I guess they will have to wait for their earnings to come out."
$90 come back plzzz
This stock is up from $35.00 for no reason
It will go up fast last 30 min
PYPL is a beast
Gonna explode
Short squeeze on PayPal next week. Get ready folks.
Sell this while you can! Will go to $70-90 when clean up occurs! PE 95 just not possible to continue for ever!
PYPL has had major technical damage yet remains richly valued in an aggressively competitive market. Short at 120. New shorts above 105. Banksters are clearly distributing the shares and it takes awhile to sell without collapsing the price.
"Great After Hours, almost at $260.00."
shiller pe ration at record highs. well above the huge corrections of 1929/1987. waaaayyy more expensive markets here.
Wouldn’t worry in the slightest. There’s potential this hits the 168-170 level but continue to hold. This will be $250 soon enough!
$FB $AAPL $PYPL $PINS hope we can hold these levels throughout the week
"How is Paypal doing today? Yes, there is a lot of competition, but, they own it !"
I hate to say it but I believe SQ will outperform and out pace PYPL.
if pypl is loosing ebay..who is next...sounds like competition will be accelerating..
Where are the upgrades? I have more sell orders to fill above 105!
I remember the last time it went down under 180.I bought inmediately
Just bought a few more shares of PYPL.
pypl closes below the 200 week moving average. oh dear. broken.
"went to several basebal games. saw that concessions used square exclusively. asked if they used papal and venmo. was told no on pypl and ""what is venmo""?"
So does PayPal own Bitcoin? I cannot find any information on it. I really hope they buy some if not.
+8% afterhours. +25% for the rest of the year. $120-$125 target.
Accumulate
"Big boys playing games with PYPL, sell in morning and buy late afternoon."
"Should close today around $185 I'm guessing. Won't be too much longer, and it'll be back up over $200. You'll be glad you got in today under $190. Good luck all!"
Imagine PayPal getting bought at a premium to help adopt and integrate Libra...
Gonna regret if u don’t buy soon
These shortsellersare desperate
$309 to $250 in 3 days LOL  PayPUKE 
Getcha some boys and girls onto the $200 sooner than later.....
Sweeeeet! Zipidy Duda Day.....
...and its just up 6%?unbelievable.
85 by Friday? More down days ahead.
fakepal is no volume on an up day once again. distribution continues. watch for alot of volume to come in during the last three minutes as the bankers sell what they bought earlier today.
Time to short back to 70....
"JUST LIKE BitGo, Brian Foote, CEO of HUMBL will not go cheaply as $PYPL will only be able to do 15% of what HUMBL can! Hundred points symbol $TSNP BitGo has been ""in talks with everyone"" and will not accept a ""small exit."""
11.5% down on an extremely good top and bottom line beat! Come on......this is aimed at shaking the tree so the big boys can get more cheap shares. All this because of ebay pulling away.........and that in 2023. What percentage of revenue does ebay bring to PYPL? Fact: approx. 13.5% with a decrease of 3-4% YoY. By 2023 ebay's participation to total revs. will be insignificant. This is sheer manipulation to acquire more share. I can't see PYPL share price staying down for long over this recent announcement. JMHO
BTW ANTM will hit 270 by Friday.
double down on another short. this stock has so many competitors
PayPal showing a lot of resistance at the $230 level. This could follow squares price action tomorrow.
DROPBOX earnings after the bell Thursday. Should be awesome
"Amazing undervalued Fintech: TRITTriterras, Inc., though its subsidiaries, operates as a fintech company. The company operates Kratos, a commodity trading and trade finance platform that connects and enables commodity traders to trade and source capital from lenders directly online. The company is based in Singapore."
"PYPL will hit GRAND SLAM HOME RUN for the next 4 quarters. GDP for the forth quarter is around 3.3-3.5% for the next 2 quarters. If the Fed does not raise the interest rate too fast, the economy will still keep growing steady. This is the vest time for the country. We will see how high PYPL can go. I guess PYPL will move up fast around 76-78 by first week of Jan. then moment of truth is Jan 18"
I've held PYPL for many years (basis $8.53 = +3068%). Also held LNG for about the same time period (basis $0.93 = +6890%). Currently buying TELL for a long-term hold (current basis 1.91 = +86.61% but still adding to position)
"Yes PayPal may be convenient, but WAY to pricey for what you get to use your own money. HUMBL (TSNP) is this correction! Whether investors want to believe at this point of time or not, HUMBL will make its superior services known very quickly and investors will flock to be part of this transfer of wealth. I’m not waiting until HUMBL’s stock price escalates to get in. Just think about it, wouldn’t have been great to get in on the ground floor of PayPal? Maybe you did, but not everyone did, here is your chance to do that with HUMBL (TSNP). The new ticker “HMBL” will be given in January. Just check it out-what an opportunity!!!!!!"
Thank you for the shares I got AH last night - I've been waiting for something like this to get in.
Please leave this board if you are a square.........
"this stock is based on fundamentals, not on the greater fool theory, that retail investors love to use."
"So PYPL goes down, KTPPF goes up... people moving over?"
Getting worried. Will it hold 230 atleast today.
"bought PYPL in 2016, added in 2018 and again in 2019. Nice to see the returns. I let it ride."
Where are all those geniuses from yesterday who said they were shorting this 
Looks good today
Two more pypl insiders selling at 113 and 111.
it's hang'in in there
At least say they upped their shareholding and now are trying to pump paypal for their clients. Least try to sell the bs. Come on.
Just noticed major paypal hacked... thousands of accounts linked to banks hacked with big time unautherized account deductions...check your bank statements for paypal linked deductions...many unable to change passwords to stop hackers
paypal on sale
What just happened to the market?
"How you feeling Jerry? SQ dropping lower than PYPL today, PYPL > SQ"
"Those of you experts that continually post that this stock is going to $100 Please STOP! Every time you post we lose market price. Perhaps if you just sit quietly and WAIT it will hit your ""expert"" prediction. In the meantime, think of the market as a pitcher in baseball throwing a no-hitter. In baseball no one talks about the possible no-hitter during the game. The team does not celebrate until AFTER the no-hitter has been thrown. Look at the $100 price the same and don't start celebrating until AFTER the $100 is reached."
I love you PYPL!!
I'm sure I saw 2.69$up after market @4:02. 2 minutes after it closed
credit card and car loan delinquencies at 7 year highs. why? what does this mean for pypl?
Looks like a day to get seasick. Hold on for the delayed election aftershocks.
SQ - How do you make only $32M on $1.6B in Rev? 2%? LOL. on pure electronic trx. Sounds like a rev classification issue to me.....
do you guys think we can hit 90$ by the end of next week?
April 100 calls are golden
Worldpay is green right now
Do 10% drop since Friday comes back...is this a good thing? Made my 10% buying today and selling AH....not sure if it was worth holding?
87 open / 3 to 1 buys to sells in ah respectively
Long!! Anticipating a nice day
V at 143 looks like a great entry. no buying until the blue lite special is activated.
pypl tops are marked by upgrades and sweet nothings. pypl bottoms are indicated by downgrades. how many downgrades has pypl received lately?

The stock is going to be under $250 tomorrow
PYPL is up 4.93% to 106.64
All them Wallmart shoppers will add millions in transaction charges!!!
Don’t let the suits win!
I am getting frustrated with PYPL!! Anonymous - I just might sell!

PYPL high today 243.42. Nice!
PayPal is the AOL of payment. Their business model is obsolete and they now have plenty of competition. Market Sentiment: STRONG SELL 
CNBC and Reuter reported that PayPal beat estimates & 90% higher than last year.
Not even down 10% since Wednesday
@Big don't forget to load the truck up!I sure am! $$$$$$$
why did I sell this around $85 for a 10% gain?? big mistake.
"Almost 20% off all time highs, sad."
"ahhh...Boom, Boom Pmt Processors..."
NICE
"Oh it's going higher this is a long stock, steady she goes ."
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3630037-paypal-sees-earnings-growth-slowing-in-q4-stock-falls-5_1
BFT is next PYPL. cnbc said it could triple from today closing price
I could see this getting up to around $195 if it beats on earnings later today which I believe it will!
Heavy resistance @ $ 300.00!
I bought more PYPL in AH.
gee...why do ya spose bank analysts are so interested in you buying pypl shares?
Earnings report coming after market today right?
"Just a word of caution. Just because they beat earnings, doesn’t mean the stock is going to $200 no matter how much we would all love that. The stock is on a tear and in order to keep it at that pace there has to be really great news not just good news."
slowly coming back
Is there any float between when paypal collects cash and pays out? If so rising interest are good for them.
Repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock...because financial shenagans are required to keep the stock price up.
"I don't get it. What triggered this: ""...And the momentum has carried over to May thus far, as PayPal had its largest single day of transactions on May 1, topping previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday records. "" Because people are getting $1200 from FED ?"
PayPal reached an all time high at 177.98
So why the big drop.
I got in PYPL when it was down -2% for no reason right after the earning report at $70. Idk why but PYPl usually drop it like this and has moved up slowly on the north.
cool I'll buy more love buying days
my only red stock. even draftkings is green
"If PYPL ever works out a deal with Amazon, the stock goes to $100.Go PYPL"
I would short AAPL PYPL TWTR AMZN GOOG
"Anyone stuck long: Sell PYPL Pre market here at $177, quadruple the amount of shares you own BUT go short, on margin, $177......trust me, you will make it all back. Please save this post"
boilerplate caution in the guidance everybody chill
Down strong on heavy volume today. Monday is a half day so the downtrend may lessen some Monday but this has just begun it's fall.
Paypal and ebay are sibling companies. Paypal was and is a pioneer in epayments. I believe that it is a matter of taxation. Almost everybody uses paypal so it is difficult for paypal to hide earnings. Thats why they want to boost a new company
PayPal has accepted Bitcoin since 2014.
FRANK THE TANK
Never sell a single share!
can PayPal compete with Google? prob not
my puts got paid...
Wow! This thing is going to make up all the ground it lost in no time!
Holding long! $PYPL $MA $FINX $V. LETS GO!!!
Pick up some cheap shares hopefully in the next few days at around 95-98.
"PYPL is a tough own. Some say it has nowhere to go up, but same people have been saying that about eBay before the split for the last half decade. This stock honestly has no growth. No future. It's stuck where it is by incompetence of the current management coupled with a history of not understanding their primary customer base. From my experience, it's a really bad company. In my business I deal with multiple financial institutions and Paypal has always been the most difficult to deal with due to inept customer service."
Sold today. Locked in a small gain. I wanted to lock in my gain above 90.
I’m not sure what will happen if any news of Amazon Pay comes.
"Like I've been saying on this messageboard for 6-7 months now. Don't Bet the Farm on PayPal. Rather.... Bet the Farm on PayPal, W/Confidence. It was a no brainer. $80, here we come gang."
Congratulations to SQ and their CEO! She clearly communicates her vision and customer relations.
is it awesome?
Congrats to all the longs! anyone doubting this a 100 stock one day?
PayPUKE  is headed back to $126
I sold some of my PayPal and put to sq today. I think more room for growth in both companies. But I feel PayPal business is too far stretch and very not stable. Sq is all interconnected... hope I am right

Sorry guys I bought @$188 so it had to go down
Anyone remember when they announced some sort of cryptocurrency trading @ $215? Bwaaaaaaaa
wowza.. this stock is double the mkt cap of wfc... hmm fair value here?
Beat
I think its ironic that the analyst cant do their jobs and the stock goes down
Looks like another bloodbath today... sentiment/momentum are bleak right now!
"what a great ceo, no place id rather put my money"
anyone think this may actually drop after earnings?
"Paypal is getting ready to crash they did lose Ebay . CEO pumped the stock he called it ""the end of cash "" . Soon he will be investigated for pumping the stock then dumping it . A classic pyramid scheme ."
YTD up $1/share!
added more at 74 dip. favorite stock ever
I guess they didn't miss ebay after all
U guys are completely clueless.All the bigBanks bny even ma getting into crypto will squeeze any advantage out of sq and the stock will collapse.Same as si. And pypl. All xtreme sales here $si $sq $ma $pypl
the loss of EBAy exclusivity could mean the end of Paypal
Omg sq is very close by
"Multi-talented hotshot CEO Jack Dorsey might be hot. Looks like Dan Schulman is an equally formidable opponent, I'm no longer concerned SQ might eat up PYPL one day, but it did look that way at one point in 2017-2018 when SQ was hot hot and hot."
Buenos días PYPLers. Was a lovely weekend here in south Florida and ready for a great week for PYPL. Buena suerte to one and all :))
watch out paypal mogo is on the move
$309 really? R.I.P.  forever All good  things just come to an end. This is   
"Love PayPal, their customer service ain’t that good however"
Holding strong to my $177 quadruple down short! Anyone like $220+ yesterday? ROTFLMFAO
"I have to admit. I had PYPL for a long time now.... but its competitors are doing a lot better. Check SQ, VISA, MA. All did PYPL. Unless PYPL makes a move within next 3-6 months, I will probably have to look elsewhere. We are almost same place we were over 6 months ago. Not a good sign. Same time, SQ, VISA, and MA all moved up fast."
Auto Loan Delinquencies Reach All Time Highs and an emergency rate cut tomorrow. because the economy is in such great shape.
ZOOM OUT and chill
When is PayPal earnings being announced ?
Rate cutes from 2.25% will do nothing to stop the ongoing economic collapse.
"$Grow and $teum holding up. Next week we see them take off, big time. Stay tune"
PayPUKE  lost 20% of its entire market cap in one week lol
"so much winning, i cant take it"
"PYPL will not move a lot for the next 2 weeks. It will be active after Christmas. The best one in town should be BABA. Monday a lot of big blocks came in. Over 300,000 shares premarket , 2 points higher, today is even bigger. over 12 million shares keep pushing BABA. I THINK SOME ONE JUST ALL IN."
haters gonna hate
PYPL killed it in their earnings and it goes down 11% in the after hours? makes zero sense. It's going to be an excellent chance to load up on more shares though!!
Man WTH is up with this stock? Tremendous earnings and forcast yet dropping like a stone for days.....
"Venmo is great for buying and selling weed as well. Fantasy football , poker etc... Everyone uses it!"
Where can we watch PYPL announce at? Thanks.
yippee ki-yay !!

LONg term..... is bitcoin the end of pay pal?
Long way from a good buy. Aint no value stock here.
"I have a 300 call for September, shall I sell tomorrow or keep it for the earnings. As if it does not go up post earnings my call will completely come down. Suggestions pls"
Where are all those analysis that endlessly pumped PYPL now! They know nothing.
PayPal is down 5.76% to 225.30
PayPal to the moon todayBitcoin is up today 4.93%
IBS downgrade to neutral (valuation) while raising price Target to $120.
"Buying the dip, will finish in the green today...Cohen’s departure is a non-story."
Don’t know how I did it. Threw in a low pitch and squeaked in before close today. Now I’m up 2 dollars per share already and I believe it’s up from here on out

"Hottest Company in America, possibly the world."
Up again today whoohooo!! Show me some $90+

The entire gain from the crypto news erased in 1 minute
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-could-offer-low-145746940.html
I told you guy $106.30 by tomorrow
Google pay is a gnat on PayPal’s plate. One swat and it’s gone.
Went against my discipline and got burnt.I sell before earnings but for some stupid reason I let the dice roll.
Dare I say .... Explosion! Lol. Where’s the fella that always talks about that. Time to TAKE A BOW son.
10% downgrade to 275-280This is more healthy for long term.
"The trend is your friend, it’s pretty clear the trend is pointing lower. Why stay in this for the next quarter?"
No Brainer here. Ebay is Paypal's core customer and Ebay is now providing it's own checkout solutions. This stock is toast. .
This is going to take some time. Trend is down for now.
Lets hope this thing doesnt keep falling
Coinbase will start trading on the open marking sometime within the next month according to most reports. IMO I'd expect this to stir up further interest and discussion surrounding crypto. The sales so far on the secondary market for Coinbase could possibly value it at nearly 100B when it hits the open market. I'm sure there will be plenty of chatter.
Called it!!! Time to load up....
Investors day musta tanked
Huge Dutch pensionfund bought PayPal and Activision blizzard!
Wow. My 145 puts I picked up at $2.05 a contract more than doubled into the close! Down big AH tomorrow should be a great day!
Add more at $115
Trust it.. it will take care of you.
simple with pfe announcing 3rd quarter positive trials ...focus shifted to pharmaceutical today.
$174 - $175 seems to be the bottom. Showing strong support here. Will likely begin to rebound now. Great price point to buy in and hold back up to $200 plus. Good luck all!
The big boys shorting before earning are trying to push the price down so they can close their short positions without loss or less loss but at the current level they are running the risk being squeezed by other even bigger boys...
$309 to $285 and dropping like a prom dress 
How's the investor day? are we shooting $310+ today?
If it's everything great why it's going down?
"It is raining free money. rate cuts will happen this year. buy, buy, buy."
"For the uninformed, crushed it!!!!!!!"

18M shares on a down day. that is real selling folks. all of july's gains gone in one trading day.
"think the market will pull back near term. Buy the rumor, sell the news. Christmas correction coming"
Beast holding up on a down day. Tough.
"Everytime we hit the low $90's we sell off, just like clockwork. Getting old."
The #$%$ of the earth are now filing lawsuits. There should be a bounty on lawyers. just like coyotes.
Love how everyone slept on the stock when earnings were released. You literally had an excellent opportunity to buy the stock cheap because this sucker is climbing above it's record high and even higher! Can't wait ! Venmo is driving this baby
It is another day the most that tech sector will get trashed. I don't see any hedge fund managers who don't want to buy more of PYPL. It is the price that they don't want to pay. Anyway they still have to pay finally because PYPL is too good to be ignored.
PYPL is down -6.24% to 79.99
It's a rotation out of tech for now.
"sorry to say say but just think about it for a minute. pypl and sq are a dying breed how are they going to compete with the headwinds of fb, visa, MC and all of the major banks."
WHOOOOOO HOOOOOOO!!!!!! We are getting RICH!!!!!!!
It will make its run to $70 shortly. Too much good stuff going on with PYPL
hopefully this is it
Pentagon to provide military installations near 11 major airports for coronavirus quarantine
Enough damage for today. Lets see what tomorrow brings. More carnage??
Suspect PayPal to miss eanring and beat revenue. It may possibly guide lower.
New 52 week high. Hehe. $$$$
pypl gap around 45 to fill. economic slowdown is real and is severe.
Sold. Not going to be greedy. Will buy later on
Started buying more PayPal and I’m prepared to continue buying as long as it keeps going down. This is the type of stock you buy into weakness. I’m also picked up calls at the close. Looking to buy more on the dip tomorrow.
CEO selling shares is not good. Some surprise coming soon?
"huuuuge day. wow. I didn't think we would surge like this today following a big week, but damn paypal just can't be stopped"
selling is done folks. This stock is going to through the roof. PayPal is an incredible company! I'm so excited about this one
Play pal isn’t done
This will hit 70 again . Who’s buying at that price
"bought too early@67.26, np"
PYPL makes Cashapp and Venmo look like a complete joke.
Frustrating. I wrote a hand written letter to pay pal customer service . They still have not written back I even put : attention ELON MUSK
Why can't you all focus on stocks. Is PayPal going to continue their dominance in fintech? I s one of the bigs boys going to buy them out? That woul make sense seeing how big this space is. Facebook an achieve a lot of it's goals that much faster.
Had another company I own (pets) beat big time and raised guidance. Down over 20% since. Market getting nervous I guess.
"PYPL should be serious about building BRAND "" VENMO "". It is a MUST in order to hook on the consumers. So PAYPAL , VENMO and ONE TOUCH. It is very unique to have brands and words that is easy to recall. I think VENMO and ONE TOUCH will be the big winner next year. Don't forget INDIA and CHINA are the big markets and still in the infant stage. I just keep PARLAY PYPL quarter to quarter."
another record breaking quarter
When the market opens this will open at 82
I bought this monster on a dip 2 weeks ago at 231. Insane.

SHOULD I BUY A MILLION SHARES? CAUSE I CAN PUMP DIS STOCK!
But its great to be out and pick it up low at support again. Maximum boost!
Not recovering at all today!
they're still trying to write their own story since the eBay misunderstanding by shareholders.
Been disappointed in the price action of this stock lately geez.
BUT I am all about the charts when it comes to trading and now now it's time to get in. Their numbers though are awesome!!
"$DPW If $RIOT can get $25+ with 7 employees with no tech exp, what can a actual tech company like DPW do? $PYPL $SQ $ROKU $AMD $MARA $GROW"
Spam on this site is amazing.
"I want some opinion on Honey.There was a lot of negativity about this buy for 4B, way too expensive many felt.Dan S never updated on this company since. Wonder if anyone knows anything?"
"Like TSLA, another poster child for the asset bubble the Fed has blown during this global depression. How big can the bubble get before it pops?It will probably go up higher than anyone can imagine, but within a year it will probably be trading under 10.Wonder how nimble all this optimistic money is, pouring into the market during the worst crisis in history, with no other thesis than the Fed has got their back."
Anyone knows anything yet?

"Funny how a #$%$ like LMND is up huge after going to 103 yesterday,but PYPL can't even break and hold 234 lol such a joke this stock is!"
forecasting revenue growth in the current situation is very difficult. note that many large tech companies have skipped the guidance. with covid cases rising there will be a huge boost in online shopping that will drive paypal's business.
Pay my Pal!
Next week this will be over 200
PayPal just recovered faster than Kevins comments on yahoo finance
b of a with a fresh target if 282 just now
This happens every quarter but it usually takes at least a day or 2 to recover. Momentum will be stronger than usual. Expect 150+ in the short term.
have some money to spend. should I buy $pypl or $sq
SQ UP 4.50$ (premarket)PYPL still down 1.80$( premarket)Pypl also deals with Bitcoin and we are down ????Do we not have any Apps that can deal with trading stocks like SQ.
my business will no longer accept cash! war on cash has begun!
BFT could be a good play off PYPL results
market might survive but paypal has just given up..
This is going to take a quarter to recover at least. 110 again?
"If you shorts didn't cover from before earnings, it's better you do it now. Save yourself the heartache before PayPal empties your pockets even further."
Terrible customer service and can't even keep accounts safe from hacking. Wont be long until we hear this company in the news.
"we are green whilst the rest are mostly red, cos this is a quality company."
$160 today? looks promising!
don't listen to some #$%$ up analyst trying to pull back it and jump back. they missed the boat. fellas do your due diligence and d
Went short heavy from the top this morning. This POS is way over priced I don't care what analyst hacks say
The “Square(SQ)” effect.
eBay market place revenue only grew 3-year-CAGR by 4%..PayPal market place revenue grew 3-year-CAGR 23%
"Analyst target prices are worthless. They only serve to manipulate a share price for the good of a related enity to the analyst. PYPL is a perfect example. Compare recent analysts target prices of $15 to $51/shr for AMRN which is trading sub- $7’s... I don’t trust Cramer, Motley Fool, or any other “Analyst/Commentator.”"
Square snapchat payment no more..wah wah wah.........
Guidance... Guidance...Guidance. When will you investors learn that Guidance is what drives stocks after hours during earnings releases.
Huge short squeeze coming
this is being held down by algos. no other reason for this to be stalling flat.
$STNE dominates fin tech in Latin America should catch up to PayPal
Story repeats. Slower forecast on next Q by management and they would again beat that up and stock would keep going up. Does it matter? No. This is on the road of touching 90. Either you be in or you be out.
has it ever been this easy to take profits out of the stock market? has trump effected an executive order prohibiting the selling off of the equity markets?
Selling I’m scared
hmm usually this mirrors the Nasdaq... not a good sign for us longs
"Hold or Buy....Don't Sell!!! MM is #$%$ you out of your stock. """"""If you remember from when we first told you about it, we were in PayPal primarily for Venmo. Venmo is PayPal?s app that is widely used by millennials. Venmo, in this last quarter, did $10.4 billion in transactions. This is 86% growth compared to last year. That?s crazy good growth! And exactly what we expected and want to see.And generally, PayPal?s business is booming, with its profits skyrocketing higher by 59% compared to last year.Now, if you look at the stock, you?ll see it?s down by almost 6%. You might be surprised by this. If you listened to this week?s podcast, I told you that hedge funds and market makers use news to get people to panic and sell stocks they want to go down. And that?s exactly what we have going on today.You see, PayPal announced that eBay, which used to own PayPal before it became an independent, separate company, is going to phaseout using it as the default payment system between 2020 and 2023.Right now, around 22% of PayPal?s 2016 revenue comes from eBay?s platform. That?s down from 26% in 2015 and 29% in 2014. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, in a conference call to discuss the quarter, said that the loss of part of its business with eBay would be ?quite manageable,? and had been assumed for some time. John Rainey, PayPal?s CFO, told investors that the eBay business is low growth and low margin for their company, and that it?s a drag on profitability. Finally, they expect that the lost eBay business will be more than made up from recently signed agreements for PayPal with Disney, Home Depot and QVC. Bottom line, hold on to your PayPal stock. Today?s decline is just one more instance of market makers trying to get you to panic and sell your stock to them on the cheap.You know what happens next. Once all the people who are going to sell are done, the market makers will go to sell the stock you sold them for higher prices."""""""""
Insiders sell

Looks like the party is over!!
Nice earnings for PayPal. Hope it soars :) take some profits to $TEUM. You won’t be disappointed :)
SQ looks better today

ARK Must be buying today!
Just found out that PYPL got alerted by http://Experttrade.uno. Seems bullish
500 bitcoin will make this explode digital currency the future
"I have had it with Paypal. A relative in another state wants a loan pronto. He needs to pay some income tax by tomorrow night. I tried to send money and the site said it could not be completed. After talking to the computer at customer service, the computer and I agreed they would call me back in 40 minutes. One hour and 40 minutes later, a person called me. He was po;ite, but after beating around the bush, said my $300 transaction was too large. I have used Paypal to pay for ebay transactions since 2001. I have bought vehicles on ebay and paid with Paypal. The guy was polite so I was polite about telling him I was very disappointed overall, and I suggested he be ready to find a new job when ebay changes payment methods and people realize that was the only thing Paypal could do."
Schulman! WE WANT DIVIDENDS! DIVIDENDS! DIVIDENDS! Shareholders need to bang the drum! DIVIDENDS!
yes but only if you believe in Far Left thought! Otherwise they drop you if your not drinking the Kool Aid
my best pal is Paypal.
Hey Big Mao... How's that silver dip buying working our for you???
I just loaded up a bunch here long. I dont care about the earnings
I wouldn't bet against PayPal .
UP UP
"This payment sector will report like the banks did, all good news a jump of 10% up today after earnings."
"PLEASE, could all haters just **** off, thanks"
Buy point at all time high 
ultra tiny volume today. DISTRIBUTION continues.
Next support is $203
@ $250 which is $10 more PayPUKE  has to rally 25% to break even from 10 days ago LOL 
the next selloff will be EPIC baggies.
"When my Square was $160 and PayPal was $200, I told you 100 times, Square 100x better stock to own. Well, look here, one is $202 and one is $193, lol. You all chose poorly"
"The shorts are punching walls in frustration right now. And I'm watching the money roll in. Been a bull on PYPL since $42 a share, and am not about to quit being one anytime soon."
distribution continues. more upgrades and a 100 basis point cut are required to keep the scam going.
Call Cramer tonight and get his thought on PYPL
$200 by Friday
Komol is prolific!............ I like it!
Bought my October Puts today. Should yield a nice return.
