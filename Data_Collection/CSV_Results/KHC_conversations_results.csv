double volume green day ahead of earnings..very.interesting
I've been long KHC for quite awhile. I'm glad it's finally seeing some bull action. I see some more upgrades prior to and after earnings...
"Interesting - price bottomed at 32.05 yesterday. At 32.00, the yield (based on the new dividend rate) is exactly 5%. Perhaps this is the new support level?"
"good to see you're following my comments at the other one. paid forums posted in the a.m. triggered my mobile as alerts are set to all our trust holds. additionally KR was tagged as well. of course, KR is not laboring under poor next 5 quarter of earnings forecast. we have many sh of KHC and KR and will continue course. of course, you know best, and thank you for continued enlightenment."

I muted 8 or 9 posters with doomsday messages. instead of thumbs down mute them and send them to isolation island.
"Put that OSCAR MAYER bacon and Kraft Cheese , Mayo and Heinz spicy Ketchup on the FAKE meat burger and man you have something you can choke down LOL"
Fantastic numbers from Kraft Heinz. The turn-around is real!http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kraft-heinz-reports-first-quarter-2020-results
Is dividend safe?
Its all over folks Buffet confirmed he was the big seller
Are Kraft wearhouse have enough to reload empty grocery shelves?Let's feed the world and be kind to each other.
"If KHC goes to 20, I will add and stay long. Will be 50 in 4 years. Be patient, Boys."

I think that everyone is scared of bad news and they think whomever is selling has gotten heads up on whatever that news is ----the drop only stops when the news is out in public (or goes down a lot more if the news is truly horrible)
We have seen a big move down in the markets the last week or so and this stock has held above 30 dollars. i think that is proof enough that we have seen the bottom in this one.
"Once all the fund managers liquidate their positions like the sheep they are, this will stabilize and start to move back up. There’s a reason index funds usually outperform active managers"
It's like KHC is under pressure because people are scared or are betting on a new sell off from 3G. Very interesting. I plan to double down before earnings
hope everyone is enjoying their KHC dividend. making nice bank on recent purchase of aapl shares.
"This is starting to look like a good deal. In the big picture, the large charge off is a non cash expense and shouldn't affect earnings or cash flow at all. The dividend cut is also irrelevant because I think its actually a positive and can help address the debt. The stock sold off nearly 20B in market value due to the write down and div cut, seems oversold. I almost see it as the company just got 1/3 cheaper with the same cash flow and earnings because that is pretty much what happened"
"They missed on top and bottom earnings of $0.84 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.10 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.94; revenues rose 0.7% year/year to $6.89 bln vs the $6.93 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus"
lower price is good for long term accumulation..down is good for me..roll over dividends and add more to roth jan1
holding gains..that's positive
Added 500 shares @ $26.70
It’s worth 40$/share
"This might be a stupid question, but could someone just buy certain stocks the day before their dividends are given out and sell and find another? Or do certain company's require a certain hold date"
Forward P/E is 15.88.
"Alright guys i don't see Macaroni and ketchup going away anytime soon... yeah little on the high side debt wise, but this is a strong buy."
"Hmmm, 35 after earnings maybe? Or does the whole market tank.... Fed pump makes for ever increasing stocks... The mac and cheese is strong in this one."
Cheese and ketchup will not get a bailout.....
Some Big Guys/Hedge fund owner --- buying big amount of stocks--- LOOK @ VOLUME. Buy it right now and wait for just 2 or 3 weeks. -- good chunk of money in 2 or 3 weeks.

LAST POST INSIDERS ARE LOADING UP ON KHC STOCK!! AT 12 TIMES EARNINGS TRADING AT A HISTORIC DISCOUNT.
they have issues..but most of the bad news is factored into the cheap price already
"Sold my entire KHC at $32.30 lost $27,000. Rolled it over to Facebook. Don’t get me wrong I still like KHC but with all the negative news and Lawsuits it’s not moving like I thought and I currently believe FB is a fast upside from now to earnings."
Another record high today and it is just the beginning. Buying shares with dividend until this hot $64.
"Current price is $31.75. Very reasonable numbers show that stock should hit $43.25 by year end (+36%) after surprisingly good earnings and $46.55 within 12 months (+47%) from today's prices including dividends. Stock hit $97.00 when the DJIA was at 20,500 in 2017."
If Buffet and 3G ARE selling here come the 30’s!
Tomorrow we jump over $30 and the uptrend begins
Glad this isn’t in my portfolio
Do super bowl wins make stocks go up? GO PATS!
Should I buy today or wait until tomorrow?
I hope the stay away from Campbell soup. people want healthy soupnot soup overloaded with sodium with almost no nutritional value or fiber.
Buffet and 3G averaging down slowly !!! I believe that as the generel market drops KHC will continue to rise as investors secure a good dividend and move to safer stocks. We all need to eat no matter how the economy is going. Time to buy KHC at these low prices.
Keep ur eye on Buffet.
Right move to sell cheese. Now they need to build up more vegan products.

"Did ok with the covered call play at 35 strike. I doubled down on shares and traded a dollar plus profit per share before earnings buying in 32s and selling at 34. Lowered my basis of common.

Mr Market is giving new investors a nice gift. RIP current investors though.

$40’s Coming...
"Like to buy KHC for its dividend, what I am missing any long time investors please sheds some light I am 71"
"Wow: ""Warren Buffett's Plan for His Wife's Inheritance Is a Must Read for Investors""It sure is. He directed that 10% of the value transferred to her should be invested in ultra-liquid, short-term Treasuries, and the other 90% not be placed in Kraft Heinz Company (KHC).Good call.82BusinessInvestor's Business Daily Video•11 minutes ago"
KHC didn’t get real sales even during this crisis. Ppl can easily return back all KHC sealed or open products next week! We value our health so much more now!
This may be a good co. but the stock has gone from 97 to 56.
sure wish I had gotten some in the 20s
"About 3.2 billion in annual profits, when taking out paper write downs. With PE of say 15, that is 48B, so about 20% undervalued. It is paying down debt at 1 billion a year. It is just a matter of showing stabilization of sales. At 1.6 % treasury yield you have to take some risk. It should be pretty recession safe."
just now khc big upgrade
institutional traders not happy with retail. there go their bonuses lolol
"BOYS...IN AUGUST KHC WAS 25.41. NOW AT 24.77, I WOULD SAY KHC HAS HELD UP NICE. ITS VALUE, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. PLUS. ..WE HAVE BUFFETT AS A BACKSTOP AND A 6% PLUS DIVIDEND. BOYS...KHC IS RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT TO BE, LOOKING FORWARD !!!! GENTLEMEN...THATS WHY THEY CALL ME THE ""GREAT ONE"" AND ""DR COMMON SENSE"". I BREAK THINGS DOWN SO THAT ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND IT !!!!"
"The Kraft Heinz CEO says that sales are surging, especially Mac & Cheese, during this downturn and pandemic. KHC has bullish indicators, strong sales, a generous dividend, and great brand recognition. Look for the stock to continue higher."
"div to .20¢ is not a roadblock. will make for more revenue options for 2020. good sign in all respects. if you're on fence and still not adding shares, in my opin only, sell all sh today. we hold many 00,000 sh in trust and of course expected, and welcomed div reduction. should have been done earlier. THS is worth watching again."
5% dividend NOW isn't until it drops to 32. I can wait a few hours.
Kraft Heinz is up 4.90% to 38.83
Gotta love this setup coming into Earnings next week.
Just about all cos. will be like this one eventually.
Steady trickle of stealth buying this week....I see huge marketing push in the UK
I just increased my position in this company! I think the turnaround is going well and there is potential. That and people are loading up on Mac & Cheese for the winter!
"Heard KHC is starting up a new Venture Businesses Division. Would love to hear the pitch to new companies. ""Come to KHC, so you can witness the complete destruction of your brand and it's people"" Easy prediction - this too will fail."
"Bill Holden, of Enterprise Fund, has targeted $35 per share asnew target price for KHC. Real Earnings and Growth."
26 billion in sales .. doesn't sound like a struggling company to me . long term hold should prove beneficial ...
Just goes down down down
Once KHC comes out with their own beyond burger version they will squash them like a bug. Stock will be over $35 in the next couple of weeks. Earnings will be better this quarter.
"here comes 28 , buy as much as you can"
Thats a 47 million dollar move. obvouisly buffett or a fund

What day does this garbage stock not fall? It seems to just fall everyday
"Once up, Barron's comes"
"KHC filed its annual report today. A firm’s reported earnings vary from their cash flows. That disparity, known as accruals, reflects the calculation of the organization’s future interests. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/KHC. The calculation involves great subjectivity and is susceptible to manipulation, making accruals quality low and difficult to turn into cash. From this perspective, the higher accruals in a firm’s reported earnings, the more likely it will record poor future earnings. If you want to estimate the quality of $KHC ’s earnings to be released, you can calculate its accruals level, and the portion that may not be able to be realized in cash flows. For the method, please see: http://www.financial-education-hub.com/2/KHC."
Another good day to own a boring food company
Nothing wrong with the company. They are just spending on means of production... spending a lot actually. When done will pop back to profits again.
About a billion better on the balance sheet. Assets up about .9b and debt down .1b. You have to subtract out goodwill and intangibles.
Greatest investment ever...

"Dream about everything being solved by next quarter or the quarter , it maybe can't really be solved people want to pay less , brand names do not mean the same to younger people they have dozens of other ketchup brands they are buying might not even know or care that Heinz is the grandaddy."

"@steve....Patricio has been there since last July...SEVEN MONTHS.BTW, I just sold one of my houses on December 23. It closed on January. Wife transfer in bank. That's 16 total days, but only 9 working days excluding Christmas and. New Year. You talk a lot of nonsense."
"Unless you can keep buying people to hide this POS business model, it all falls apart. That's what you are seeing today and it's gets worse from here going forward unless they do an acquisition. In the long run, this thing gets busted up and sold off in pieces. Chickens come home to roost."
"The Coffee Blenders Company announced today that it has signed a co-packing agreement with Gevalia Kaffe, a Kraft Heinz brand to prepare and supply custom package coffee under the Gevalia Kaffe brand.Single serve pour-over coffee is a common and popular brewing method in Asia. The market in Japan alone is estimated to be approximately 2.5 billion cups per year."
Bond Raters are biggest joke; they failed to even catch the shenanigans in the mortgage backed securitiesbond market in 2007 to 2009 period.THEY ARE TREND FOLLOWERS !
Just need 3G or buffet to buy a little
Will KHC acts like GME? The pattern seems possible
Steak and Mac and Cheese tonight!
This should be soaring with low rates and everything they make flying off the shelves!
"Big mistake if selling into this stock rally. Khc will be back to mid 50’s before Q1. If you can’t wait 3 months, then any stock you buy is not worth being in your portfolio. At these price I don’t doubt a competitor like Nestle is buying"
"BOYS...I LOADED THE BOAT AT 27.45. BUFFETT IS PUTTING IN A FLOOR ON THIS STOCK. BUFFETTS BUYIN WHILE OTHERS ARE IN PANIC MODE. PLUS, THE CUT IN DIVIDEND SCARE IS HISTORY !!! THERE IS TOO MUCH VALUE HERE TO PASS UP, AND GUESS WHAT. I DONT GIVE A HILL OF BEANS ABOUT WHAT THE ECONOMY DOES....BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL EAT REGARDLESS. HUGE UPSIDE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND DOWNSIDE IS QUITE MINIMAL !!!"
"I hold a large position in KHC. I bought based on my analysis of their financial statements. I won’t bore you with the details. Last week, out of curiosity, I purchased a generic competitor of kraft ketchup. One person’s empirical observation does not make a market, I grant that; but I assure you, I’ll never buy that generic brand again."
I always say. Patience is a virtue. We are going to get KHC under $28 tomorrow yielding 5.7+%. This is awesome. Feel sorry for all those in at $60+. Hope it gets back there soon.
What is Buffet up to I wonder? I’m sitting with to much imo. He is supposedly adding. Wish I had never gotten involved. Sure think there are better investments out there than processed food companies.
Wait til people find out Buffet has bailed. Stock will drop another 20%!!!!!!
"The people who are disgruntled at KHC are hilarious. This is just a speed bump. Yes, millennials are buying healthier expensive food products instead of processed foods. However, when the next economic slowdown occurs, they will transition to the cheaper alternative every time...Seen it in '99 and '08."
in the future when we get to 33.50..look out..hope it grinds higher to that number
This stock will be over $40 by months end 
"First Kraft and Heinz should have not merged , second selling control to someone from Brazil with no experience in managing a company like Kraft and Heinz . Fund managers not interested in innovation only how to squeeze a business of its cash to fill their pockets. Fund managers are not suited to grow and innovate . Why a company like this has over $32 billion in debt ?"
Awesome day! 
KHC has been diving since 2017 and has absolutely been spinning it's wheels for the past year. It currently sits near the low end of valuation for a 52 week cycle. Its bond credit rating has just been reduced to junk.I can't find the sunshine and rainbows so many on this board see. I just can't.
Kraft Heinz shares are trading lower on continued momentum from yesterday after the company reported worse-than-expected Q4 sales results. Also hearing that Fitch downgraded the stock to Junk.
Look good stocks don't lose over 65% from the top. Amzn buying whole foods was the start of the end.
"""Sales fell about 2.2% year over year on a comparable basis."" Been hearing the same thing from KHC for years now and they cant stop it. Thats not a small decline either. 6x-9x max for KHC. $17.10-25.65 price target."
3G could be raising cash for a deal or part of a deal might include 3G having less ownership. Lots of acquisition targets don't like the 3G approach to management.

"KHC's sugar daddies will be buying another food company and melding it into KHC. The combined entity might even have a different name, but KHC 's internal operating management will have little to do with what is acquired and who stays and who go's. Will be interesting!"
notice how positive news gets no outlet..no barons or wsj or times..only when bad news to fit into their sgenda
Sales are still falling.. even boomers are switching to newer tastier healthier brands

There is a DIVIDEND coming next week . Get in on Monday or miss out. This stock is goin UP.
tomorrow is exactly 1 month from big drop.
amusing. bunny will tune into motley and alpha for sage advice. read those posts for amusement only.
good to see them selling off lessor units..reduce debt and focus on winners like heinz
"Looks like all of Warren Buffett stocks have CROOKED management. I would no buy any of them , GM was killing their own customers with a faulty switch they knew about for years , but said nothing, WFC what a mess, Now KHC cooked the books , JPM has some going to jail for manipulating the silver market and the overseas crooked deals"
If the market holds up we should hit $34 in June sometime.
60 end of year . Watch just watch and see !
Their product lines are badly out of step with consumer demand. They completely missed the low fat craze and now the natural foods trend.
"khc , one thing to consider it can never be like last quarter with the 11B dollar write-off . Before the results Thursay morning before the market opens there seem to be a lot of high priced puts out there take 30.00 strike Mar its worth a lot of money if the earnings are ok causing puts will dive through the floor put causing holders lots of cash. Expect it to be volatile mon to wed."
If I get that job driving the hot dog. Van am I allowed to smoke weed in it ?
Be a Buffett. Buy at 15 bucks.
Mutual funds need a couple of days to unload their positions.
Warren Buffet and 3G's millennial CFO was such a great idea! LOL! Has anyone checked Warren Buffet for Alzheimer's lately?
near 34 by weeks end....new coming!!
"I want to buy in, however financials don’t look good. I know this company will recover, but there needs to be some adjustments. That being said, if it goes back to 25 I’ll be like f it I’m in."
I hope this keeps dropping so i can buy more!
just left grocery store..watching all the unhealthy food people we're loading their carts with...khc has nothing to worry about...plenty of people still eating there food and my wife bought phily cream cheese again..great product
Scott's a baggy at 50. He will tell you want you want to hear. Plan is sell your shares and take the loss. You will be happier in the long run. Mistakes happen look at Scott!
"Surreal that it takes 4 teams of accountants (SEC, forensic auditor, PwC, KHC staff) to make insignificant changes to reported periods. I assume the Keystone cops are getting paid for this fiasco."
Why is this tanking today?
earnings beat and short hammering..could happen
Ppl selling tech and getting into pkg food.. this could trade back to 30 before the virus passes.
"Went to the grocery store and actually examined what a ""Lunchable"" was....TRUE STORY....Consisted of some bagged fruit flavored drink, what appeared to be Ritz crackers with some processed meat and cheese between them, and. a Reeses peanut butter cup. Wow. I cannot imagine any conscientious adult providing that to their child and believing they are doing a ""good thing"". Kraft might as well stick a cigarette in there. Everything else is tragic. It would just complete the tableau."
KHC needs some viagara
Lets go baby!! lol
Lower lows but it’s a still a great bargain on this stock.
"cutting dividend could be in play: with OVER 17 Trillion in global national debt (read bonds) it is no wonder a cash flow public company with a good div rate can afford to cut % rate to almost nothing. in my opin, er guidance continues to deleverage and i'd cut div to 1.2% for few good reasons."
"Huge tumble....buy before Buffett speaks on Monday...although with the release of his letter this weekend, you may already be too late."
Lower taxes coupled with massive deregulation = an explosive economy! Enjoy 
"Warren Buffett to appear on Squawk Box, bright and early, on Monday morning. He'll likely tell everybody ta' simma', Simma' Down now, Ya'll just Simmer Down. This is a BUYING OPPORTUNITY, I look forward to him pointing that out, at the beginning of next week."
I think one more panic sell if they cut dividend..but need to to right the ship long term..may get one more chance at cheap price
Good time to own food stocks. Store shelves are void of product.
A close over 36.33 on volume confirms the break-out is just starting. GLTA
Bam Bam!
PPS now higher than it was before COVID-19 struck! Go figure. Might be all for naught if rumors about a dividend cut persist. Congrats to all who bought around $20. That's a handsome profit in less than 90 days.
Bought 150 shares today . Wish me luck !
"Until they completely remove the dividend, this will continue to sink. They are not serious about the $31 billion in debt."
KHC needs to evolve like GIS .
sometimes you just gotta like solid dependable brands
not finding any news
7 days straight more buying than selling volume. Dividend coming up soon as well.
Target is upgraded to 46.
Tomorrow may give me a chance at increasing my position. I will keep my bid active.
Markets are all down big time but KHC is up. What's that tell you. Can you say way oversold?
Warren Buffet is the King. KHC will be okay. Believe in royalty. Believe in Warren Buffet.
they keep dividend. and paid 98 mill debt.
We could slowly make our way back to $30 in 2 months or so.
Looks like ER will be on thursday August 1st. And most likely dividend date announcement also.
"in 3 months kraft numbers are coming it will fall further. Can people's food choices be changed from fresh , wholesome back to bottled ,salt sugar with vitamines added."
I suspect this will drift to 32 or less in the coming weeks to months based on percent change in the dividend. To achieve a 5% dividend or higher at 1.60 a year would equal $32 or less stock price.
"Omg! Epic! Buffett just bought KR not KHC! Ppl here just try all kinds of effort, including silly lies!"
According to what I read and believe the dividend will not be cut. But if it was cut for some reason imo the stock would also pop because they could grow the business. Either way a win win absolute floor imho is the 25 area.
KHC exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
Nothing to worry about here. Many companies have cut their dividend only to return it to previous levels a couple of quarters down the line. $KMI $COTY Buy this bad boy if you have the funds.
"52 week low....when does this find a bottom? Looks like it is here based on PAST chart....but, seems like lower is possible."
"I like Kraft because dividend, and I think they can turn around. But Nordstrom is probably better. Kraft is probably a good retirement stock tho, but it now and hold for the next 20 years. Reinvest div."
"There wasn't the usual options action that occurs prior to major stock moves. There has been more negativity towards the prospects for this company. Whether this is a technically driven move off extreme oversold conditions or something fundamental is afoot that hasn't hit the airwaves remains to be seen. Regardless, I don't think anyone that is long can argue with a little relief at this point. Maybe next week we could see another point or two. Take whatever is given and be glad its up instead of down...."
4 analysts have upgraded KHC at the Analysts section of Yahoo.
Time to buy! 
"Yes i posted to the other one: Will Ferrell SNL doing the Heinz ketchup toot at thanksgiving dinner skit. but wait, then ""dad"" gets the new ""Heinz Relax"" ketchup bottle. no more toot. but, new sounds. check it out at you tube. you'll earn a laugh and now be thinking how many billions of world wide free advertising Heinz just got ""Relaxing"" and not doing much else. thank you SNL and Will Ferrell. why didn't i think of this"

"3G Global Food Holdings LP 2 CHECK THE APPROPRIATE BOX IF A MEMBEROF A GROUP just filed a ""Statement of acquisition of beneficial ownership"", which is also known as a 13G. In the filing, it appears as though 3G Global Food Holdings LP 2 CHECK THE APPROPRIATE BOX IF A MEMBEROF A GROUP claims to own 570,470,868 shares. This represents 46.7% of The Kraft Heinz Company."
"While Kraft still faces headwinds, the company still appears to be an attractive security, especially in the highly valued market we have today. Kraft is trading 27.5% under its book value, which is reflective of the $15.4 billion in write-downs. Furthermore, Kraft has lost significantly more market value than it has total revenue stream. It's worth noting that a solid portion of Kraft's revenue declines were due to currency weaknesses and negative pricing. However, currency weaknesses are quite variable, and Kraft has already stated that its new pricing strategy has turned pricing positive. Furthermore, Kraft is producing free cash flow figures that are near the company's all-time highs. Kraft cut its dividend by more than a third and still offers a dividend yield of 5.28%, which is more than sustainable with Kraft's cash flows. While Kraft may still have its work cut out for it, its shares are worth a strong consideration at current market prices."

"Prepacked food has heavy competition. I buy some Kraft or Heinz products at the 99 cents only stores, and the same with Campbells.. I prefer Best Foods for Mayo and Walmart Organic for Ketchup, even if it cost more. Whatever products are offered have to be competitive in price and quality."
40 cent dividend to shareholder on record by Aug 21 2019 Looks like $1.44 is not to bad for a stock trading this lower

My guess is that KHC will finish this week around $37.50... what do you all say ?

@Jan Andersen. Still awaiting your educating me about the virtues of KHC. You certainly had all the mouth before.I figured your genius should be shared across the board.
Warren Buffett...HELP!
To think that this stock is finished is madness . This is a notorious food stock with signature goods . Never going away !
KHC filed an incomplete prospectus showing no value for the unsecured bond offering or % rate.Why file it then?Is there a deal to buy someone?
GS is famous for posting nonsense like this then a month later issuing a buy recommendation. Yet somehow the markets always over react to anything they say.

Dividend rate at 4.11% or 92% higher than the 30 year bond is nothing to snear at. This could easily be a $50 + dollar stock within the year. It's even selling below book value and substantially below enterprise value. Let's not forget that Kraft is the fifth-largest stock holding of Warren Buffett’s portfolio accounting for 4.18% of the overall portfolio.
wow....$35 billion in market cap wiped out in a year.
Am I the only one here that is seeing this company actually making money?
"Ge comparison is perfectly relatable. KHC has $31 billion in debt. it is expected with lower profits to increase to almost a 5x leveraged position. For any company, that would be drowning in debt. for a company who growth is flat or declining, this is disastrous. There is no positive way to spin that much debt. They should eliminate the dividend completely and focus on bringing down the debt and revamping the brands. Just like Ge they will keep falling until they really tackle this debt. If you think it's not a problem, you dont know much about balance sheets."

Buffet is going to buy today. It matches his usual strategy and he is drowning in cash right now. This is a buy at open.
"Someone is trying to manipulate, by dropping bids of 100."

"Soros sold his shares today. Nice quarterly div coming up, though."
Thank you urmoney webr and all other naysayers for always being WRONG
To prouve my point that people are positive... Look all the insiders transactions from Heinz officers... Do you see many sell...https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/khc/insider-trades
Buffet could add to his stake to the tune of $1.5 billion 1.5% of his $100 billion Berkshire has to play with at the very least dollar cost average the position
LOL From 97 to 32. Just terrible.
those who were long will probably have to eat Kraft dinner for a while
My target cannot stock Oscar Meyers fast enough.. it’s sold out within 8hrs after truck offloads
Lets not forget that almost all of the analysts had this as a STRONG BUY. Lesson learned not to listen to them...
merry Christmas peace and prosperity
"Yesterday Krupa Global Investors (activist) wants Kraft to call a special shareholders meeting. Also, Look up their letter in September, 2018. At that time they they owned a substantial amount of stock in Khc."
"Hurry SELL, SELL ,SELL and I just might get another 7% dividend only need 2 more days like today so SELL , because they missed by 3 cent and are going out of business LOL, Maybe it's down so big because Warren Buffett is selling all his shares of Craft LOL just maybe"
Bought another 1 million usd on this. Keep on buying.
Share price is about equal to it's total debt.
going up. holdem
Kraft Heinz is up 4.91% to 37.10
Today was the low of the century… So don’t think it’s going any lower.
put order for 28.30 . just got the $400 dividend.
is the pain going to stop today
Since the sale of over 25 Millions shares by 3G Capital on Sep 16 resulted in KHC stock closing UP for the day the sale had to be to a MAJOR buyer ( an international Beer Company based in Brazil ? or even Berkshire H) .Yes; for every seller there must be a buyer or the stock would sink. The book value is around $40+ .Just be patient ! If you are worried about the dividend buy one share of IAE for every share of KHC and fog_gedabout it.
Clearly into the gap now..need to work back to 47$ to fill the gap..a couple more quarters like this and they could juice the dividend a little
"PB 0,8!!! Profit and dividend. It will turn finally."
"The dividend is is gonna slap us SILLY in May!! Will plow it back into this baby. REtained earnings will be used to pay down debt, maybe a brand sale too.. credit rating revised up later this year too"
Buffett is buying millions of shares. At this rate we will easily clip $40 in the next ten trading days. 
PEP posting excellent results today. Hope KHC will do the same !
"doesnt matter, hedge funds with seeking alpha do it all the time with $2 biotechs why not kraft? sec wont do anything. oh well i made money and shareholders made money. and these ppl made a boat load."
i think i will buy more in the ah market.
The problem here has nothing to do with KHC. Check out Kelloggs and the others. The whole sector is being hammered by increased costs. It wont last forever. These are products people buy everyday. Look at it as a buying opportunity for the LONG TERM because when costs come down then the bottomline will come back up for not just Kraft but the whole sector.
"Great co. Planters , Philadelphia, Mac and cheese, Velveeta. All comfort foods. Worth $45https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/brands"
So I guess Warren and Charlie are buying :-)
"Yeah, the stock won’t do well until they start making food that people in the 21st century want to eat. Unfortunately, a large chunk of cost cutting was laying off product development people. I’ve seen no sign that management recognizes this."
Forming a bottom
BUFFETT IS ON CNBC NEXT MONDAY MORNING FROM 6-9. WE MAY GET MORE INSIGHT BY THEN AS I AM SURE HE WILL BE ASKED ABOUT KHC. I STILL LOOK FOR BUFFETT TO TAKE KHC PRIVATE !!!! BUT.... AT WHAT NUMBER !!!!
Buffet is sitting on 100 Billion cash that he has been looking to put to work. Don't press your shorts over the weekend.
motley fool says can't sell brands..after they sold two brands ror a billion and a half..fake news
Long vacation for CEO coming
"This thing has been stagnant for 3 months, at what point is it low risk, high reward?"
"Went out to Walmart to pick up some goodies and picked up a bottle of Walmart brand ""honey mustard"" for 99 cents. I looked at the same sized bottle of Kraft for $2 and change and laughed."
KHC reminds me of PG . PG went down to 70's because of bs from fake news and now trades at 100 .
"""Whoops! I did it again!"" says Warren Buffett. Seriously, there is only one reason to buy a ketchup company that I can think of: If FDA were to declare ketchup a vegetable again. But this is not likely to happen under this president: He likes mayo more than ketchup."
Ouch!
should see breakout of 42 level next week
I wonder how many shares Goldy picked up today
"Berkshire owns 325,442,152 common shares of KHC and no preferred shares according to SEC filings"
"Those ANALysts scared me into selling my entire SNAP position at the bottom under $6 and see where it is today; they are trend followers which is why the rectal sphincter is part of their profession. They are contrary indicators. The book value is over $42. Since I own a big position ( at a huge loss ) and since Uncle Warren is still holding ( I hope) , like Peter Lynch of ( Magellan fame) I toured the aisles at Sam's Warehouse club and Walmart yesterday and was surprised to see rejuvenation of the brands. Two examples: the Mayonnaise bottles have a nice new label which emphasizes "" Made with Eggs from Free standing chickens"". The popular cream cheese labels now emphasize that it is fully natural etc. So long as the Brazilian mafia running the company do not reduce the dividends I feel KHC is on the mend. No guarantees. In the mean time buy one NRDBY share for each KHC share you won and collect the 12 pct dividend. Happy weekend for those like me in deep kaka."
Buffett is not selling. Maybe he is buying.
Hey Bry. I’m waiting until we retake $28 before I jump in. No harm in waiting.
"""Trading Central,"" reputed ratings firm, calling KHC a hold today, moving up from Sell."
Why is this negative today when they exceeded earnings?
"It doesn't make sense to spend $400 million on advertising products that people have known about for a generation.Paying $400 million to sports players and paying dirt wages to the workers.Makes me sick and I am now in KHC 3500 shares.I am a nobody, but I hope that KHC management and Warren see that $400 million is a waste of money.Over 10 years that is $4 billion.Dividends drop, sports players make millions to catch a football or bounce a ball.Home much ketchup do they need to sell for each basketball bounce?"
This is when you buy.
Waiting for buffet taking private for $45Gl!
67% increase in cash from operations and 107% increase in free cashflow. Wow!
MY prediction is that when Buffett passes they unload all of KHC. Better stocks to buy imo.
this hurts. please go back up soon....
This is so down mistakenly.
DEFLATED both R. Kraft's stock and Tom Brady's footballs. Please trade accordingly.

"Heinz Ketchup Dip and Squeeze packets:I came across these colorful and attractive little guys in the shape of a small ketchup bottle at the Shake Shake Las Vegas airport.

"I have never owned KHC, but this was killed today and overdone. What a gift. Bought quite a bit. Divvy in 30 days as well.. There is so many ways they can restructure.."
"This stock is the cheapest food stock out there, has some of the best brand names out there and Buffett owns a good deal of the company. Make sense? No way, the market is trying to force this stock down . It might be below a PE of 15 right now, Cambells has a PE of 17 and it's forecasts have been coming down. It's crazy, hope to buy some more in the low 50s if they'll sell it to me at that price."

So much for my Dividend Play of 3125 Shares @32.90 Earlier Today.Thought waiting till after this had a Good Up Day was the thing to do.Now I'm in The Bag Holder KHC Club.
Huge movement by weeks end 
Just bought 100 shares just for fun
Buffet owns almost one third of the stock. Wanna guess who is buying it up as you sell to increase ownership
holding khc until.$1T
Turning green baby
Buy tomorrow to get .40 dividend 500 shares gets locked in $200
"Warren Buffet likes KHC then, he should like it even much more now . He should just buy more or buy it out. It is a predictable business . With the CFO back and 3G is out, it will be back to normal. If it can offer to buyout Unilever before, it's ability to generate cash is not an issue. It was a matter of cutting too deep and hiring the CFO back is the best and I expect that the CEO and CFO can easily restore the order to the chaos."
No more steak dinners. guess I'm eating Lunchables for dinner
Break out 42 44 then will settle in.
Buffet needs to fire the management and replace it with competent management.
Warren B always comes out smelling like a Rose.
"Whether you like KHC or not, it does offer a safe place for cash during a time when markets are at a high.. basically no downside at $30 and you earn 5% div.. hell even during the pandemic it didn't sell off as much as defensive type holdings. I don't own it, but it seems to have a bottom at $30 and with a 5% div, I may rather park some cash here rather than buying S&P at 3,900.."

No support till 57.50.....Dog & witch handle clearly forming...Pauline 
So where are the earnings? I don't like a company that does not have predictable time lines.
"This company could be almost insolvent. More Debt then assets. $31 billion is not a small number. If people keep moving away from the brand, it's done."
Less than big volume and respectable increase get ready to soar accumulation completed
Finding the correct pe for this is non trivial. The forward analyst earnings are approximately 3.60 and the last 4 earnings numbers on nasdaq are similar so here the pe is 45/3.60 or 12.5. It’s cheap.
"BOYS....BUFFETT KNOWS AT 27, KHC IS ONE OF THE BEST VALUES IN THE MARKET. MOST PEOPLE ARE SHEEP, JUST LOOKING FOR SOME ONE TO FOLLOW. THOSE, WHO CAN THINK FOR THEMSELVES, ANALYZE THE SITUATION AND HAVE COMMON SENSE WILL WIN. THE SHEEP, WELL THEY NORMALLY LOSE !!!"
With KHC u are basically buying a dividend aristocrat at a 30% or more discount. Get it? 20% dividend every year....
As #$%$ as it was KHC has become one of the safest stocks to be in as the uncertainty of covid-19 looms. Their operational efficiency has improved and the bump in revenue goes a far way in improving its capital structure. If these conditions persist for another 2 qtr KHC will be in great shape again. Be wary of a flight to tech growth and fin stocks when we clear this virus. That could drag khc down
"Incredibly cheap for such a profitable company, the more it's going down the more I'm buying"
"Hey I hate tomatoes, but I love ketchup. I’m buying more if this is down Monday. Just like Buffett, I hate the Midwest winters, but I love me some DQ ice cream! In the meantime, I’m happy collecting my Divy!"
I just got in at $35 but would have a massive headache if i entered on Thurs or higher..
"Can someone explain why debt on this deal is such a bad thing? According to last years numbers it has debt interest covered by 5.5X their profit before tax. Even if earnings get cut in half, don't they still have plenty of room to go? Also, other people are saying kraft products are going out of style, but if you look at the last prior years it's pretty consistent earnings. Thoughts? Thanks!"
It's really ef'ed up how this stock works. Never saw a more undervalued company. What's it gonna take for the world to realize this? I mean Beyond Meat's market cap is currently 25% of the value of KHC?!?! In what world?

https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-04-05/lemann-says-3g-has-to-focus-on-consumers-after-kraft-heinz-routAny thoughts on this recent article
Very good value for the sale of a product group under the most price pressure from generics. Hormel has better leverage on the cost side so a good move for both.
Down over 2%? Jesus. I just wish I had money to buy. But already in.
"Dumbfounded to hear all the comments that their products are no longer relevant and the generic store label brands are equal in quality or better. Yes we all know the generics are cheaper.So I did some research and explored a few products to compare.Oscar Mayer hot dog variations, still much better than store brand.Kraft cheese doesn?t even compare with the slimy sticky store label brand variations.Oscar Mayer Deli packaged meats, 5x better than Kroger, Meier or wal-mart versions which are slimy and have fake flavor with bad aftertaste.Their salad dressings are much better than generic versions.Their ketchup, mustard and barbecue sauces beat generic competition anytime.I?ll look at more products, but based on my diet these apply most so far (low carb). Unless customer taste level has gone to #$%$ as to develop poor taste buds for generic cheap quality, then this company is nowhere near outdated and the media has punished it way far."
WOW look at that pop higher on the CEO change.

Current intrinsic value is around 30-35 dollar per share. I am currently in at 49. I was a bit to optimistic doing my Calc last year.. but still holding on.
Back to $40 by quitting time
Think about it..if they drive the stock to 50$ they will all get serious bonuses..don’t see anything negative coming anytime soon
Why would this go up when the SEC investigation hasn’t been concluded.
Did we win yet?
KHC will continue to bring in constant revenue annually regardless of the state of the economy.
"Dean Foods and KHC have the same problems , Companies dropping their products"
What are the chances that KHC cuts dividend again or eliminates it to pay down debt?
"The Street really don't like uncertainty, for sure. I hope KHC waits until the very end of July to release this Q1 (which can't be so different than Q4 18) so I can add some more like I just did. At this price it's a no brainer for my retirement and just a couple of days from cornering the market"
Lots of negative comments shorts must be getting nervous today
Does anyone believe KHC can get to $40 by end of year and if so what will have to happen from the company's side?
Fantastic Earnings beat! Great for Berkshire investors! Buy Buy Bjy
"make ketchup or mustard with cannabis , the stock would skyrocketed ,lol"
"The problem with Iconic brands like Kraft-Heinz is that they never evolved to become a 21st century brand...look at Sears, Toys R'Us as great examples....investors think become they've been around for 100 years they're a safe investment, WRONG..."

"Up after hours. I wrote covered calls, 35s. This thing tanked on there own investor day. I'm long some leaps. No faith in 3g management. If they sell planters they use the money for debt. Since 3g, buffet. Not any product development. Kraft hadn't had a new product of any significance since di giorno pizza I think. You can't cut your way to growth. No innovation, no marketing, no advertising. Best thing that happened to kraft was pandemic. When that ends then what??? Investor day gave no answers, they sold off."

Kraft hienz is the best stock on the market right now I own a few a craft hienz always delivers the fact this isn’t higher is surprising undervalued it is worth double what it’s stock price is I think it’s almost charity that it’s this low.
"Commented a few days back and got laughed at. Called a short, lol. I am not short, I am looking for a bottom on this but we are not there. We need a dividend cut. 34 billion in debt is way too much at free cash levels. Going to take 120 years at least to pay off. Declining rev, out of compliance with financials, market coming down hurting KHC. If the divy cut happens and the stock doesn’t fall you know the bottom is in. Otherwise why catch a falling knife."
So tempted to buy here but I already have more than 5% of my portfolio in this stock.
"Now that Warren Buffet is no longer an insider of the Obama administration, his investments are no longer 'golden'. In fact, now he is just an 'average joe' (or worse), who no longer has access to inside information. You see, it is hard to outperform the market, when you don't have inside information. Warren Buffet's favorites of Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo Bank and IBM never panned out, because Hillary didn't win the presidency. Now, he is likely selling his 25% stake in Kraft Heinz in order to get rid of the blemish...the same way he sold IBM. More downside because of this..."
"Interesting that Hormel is all excited about the acquisition of Planters and how they see a pathway to growth, while 3G/Buffet think just the opposite. They both can't be right. I cannot see under any reasonable scenario why 3G/Buffet would jettison this iconic brand. For a food company, the snack business is where it's at, NOT mayocatchup(which has to be the dumbest new products in the world!!!! 3G is incompetent and Buffet is holding only because is stake is too large to sell without significant discount and meantime he is strong arming the Board into continuing to pay a dividend they have no business paying and draining precious cash. This company is a mess and while their earnings release seems to be solid, I have my doubts. I am long(many years now) only because I failed to sell at higher prices and will wait it out while collecting the dividend. Not the best reason to hold a stock.."
BOYS.....BUFFETT IS NIBBLING !!!
"BIG THINGS PLANNED BY KHC!!!Final Word on KHC Stock“By implementing our integration program and improving our performance in the marketplace, we continued to drive results in the second quarter,” said Bernardo Hees, chief executive officer of Kraft Heinz Co. “However, to sustain our momentum, we must remain focused on profitable growth, innovations to meet consumer needs in a challenging environment, and improving our operations. We’re off to a good start, but there is still much work to be done.” (Source: Ibid.)If you want to take advantage of this growth story, this is probably the right time to buy Kraft Heinz stock. Rumors are rife that the company may be preparing to acquire another food giant after consolidating its balance sheet. The name which is making rounds in the press is Mondelez International Inc (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of “Oreos” and “Triscuits” brands. (Source: “Mondelez Shifts From Hunter to Hunted After Hershey Deal Dies,” Bloomberg, August 31, 2016.)"
"BOYS...BUFFETT MADE IT CLEAR. KHC IS A STRONG BUSINESS. YES, TOO MUCH DEBT, BUT NOT UNMANAGEABLE DEBT. AT CURRENT PRICES ITS A HUGE VALUE, AND ITS A DEFINITE THAT BUFFETT AINT SELLIN...PROBABLY EVER !!!!! LOAD THE BOAT AND WIN WITH BUFFETT !!!"
"HopeBusinessInvestor Disgust May Have Created an Opportunity in The Kraft Heinz CompanyGuruFocus.com GuruFocus.com,GuruFocus.com Mon, Feb 25 12:50 PM EST . Reactions Reblog on Tumblr Share Tweet Email - By Praveen ChawlaOn Thursday Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) blind-sided investors with a carton of rotten eggs when it closed its books for 2018.The company faced a bad earnings report (expected by many as the company had been struggling with lack of growth for some time), a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices that resulted in a $25 million charge and a monster write-down of intangible goodwill that resulted in a $15.4 billion charge. Its book value per share was slashed from $54.70 in 2017 to $42.45, and it cut its dividend by 36% from $2.50 a share to $1.60. The new dividend yield as of Friday is 4.6%.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with KHC. Click here to check it out. KHC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KHCPeter Lynch Chart of KHCThe stock, which hit a high of $90 two years ago, plunged 27% Friday, the day of the report, closing at $34.95. This plunge has been a humiliating comedown for the great Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, who midwifed the merger between Kraft and Heinz to create Kraft Heinz, which was supposed to consolidate the food industry. In fact, only a year ago, Kraft Heinz tried but failed to acquire Unilever (UL) towards that goal. Berkshire owns about 26% of the common shares and 3G owns about 22%. 3G's modus operandi is ruthless cost cutting using a management tool called zero-based budgeting.The media narrative is that too much value was extracted from the Kraft Heinz brands through cost cutting, which impacted growth and innovation while at the same time consumer tastes were shifting against conventional packaged foods towards more healthy choices. While I do not know the internal machinations that drove the rather sudden recognition of the goodwill impairment, my guess is that this may have been through the intervention of the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. In any event this appears to be kitchen-sink quarter, with management taking its lumps all together and putting a brave face forward.The reaction among shell-shocked investors, financial media and the blogosphere has been savage. Many small investors who followed Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) into Kraft-Heinz vented frustration and bitterness on the internet forums and blogs. They lost their trust in management and fear that more cockroaches are coming.But lost in the clouds of crying, lamentations and angry finger pointing are two silver lines. First, the company has reported a modest increase in net sales from $26.259 billion to $26.085 billion - a minuscule move in the right direction.Second, the company's operating cash flow (ignoring non-cash impairments and non-cash tax adjustments from last year) is still $3.86 per share (see note below) compared to around $5.37 to last year. The non-cash impairment, while unfortunate, is driven by accounting assumptions of growth and discount rates and is largely an adjustment of already sunk cost. It's at best a belated recognition that the company paid too much to buy the said asset originally, and the market conditions do not warrant that valuation.Goodwill for brands is such a fuzzy and intangible concept that I do not find it meaningful for valuation purposes. Operating cash is much more real for valuation, and right now and Kraft Heinz sells for around nine times each dollar of operating cash flow. Nestle, for example, sells for around 18 times operating cash flow, Unilever is at 18, General Mills at 10 and Campbell Soup at 7. Hopefully, Kraft Heinz will improve its numbers from their current depressed state. The 4.6% dividend is all not too shabby.Figure 1-From Kraft-Heinz fourth-quarter 2018 investor presentationMy adjustments to get to 2018 operating cash flow estimate:Millions except per share amount 2018 Net Loss -10,229 add Non-cash impairments 15,939 Subtract income taxes -1,006 Operating cash flow 4,704 divide by Diluted share count 1219 Operating cash flow per diluted share $3.86 Disclosure: I am long Kraft Heinz and am currently underwater.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!

I like their Mac & Cheese. Tastes a lot better than Shoprite brand. Their Mac & Cheese is worth $48 dollars a share by itself. You get the rest of the company for free.
Any move lower in KHC should now be purchased or call options way deep in the money . If you do deep in the money calls make sure you are paying almost the same price as the stock. The reason you do deep in the money calls is so you can take the shares away right before someone thinks they are going to get paid the dividend. Build that big position and work it to lower your input cost so you have the lowest input cost paying the higher % dividend you can on your shares. You must now take full advantage of the Wall Street AI computer when the Wall Street crooks use the AI computers and way over sell stocks and you must also take full advantage of the Wall Streets crooks when they use the AI computers to drive your stock to high. It is totally up to you if you want to take advantage of the AI computers the crooks are using to control a stocks movement. Very easy to see now and boy do they move fast up or down what would have taken years they now do in months. Have fun and make lots of money
volume too large..something's up
JP Morgan's new price target is now $29.00. Buy food stocks.
Be careful everyone “Legendary Trader” has stated that KHC will be at 30 by next weekend and he has been right...........................................I can’t find where he has been right.
"Buffett said it's a ""Wonderful business"" and has no intention of selling."
Mac and Cheese sells at $1 per package. Not much margin.....
Why is this dropping with two analyst upgrades? Weird stock movement
Slash the Div and that money will go to the upper management.
"Schwab has this as a A rating. Buffet owns over 25% of the company. He's stayed in there, and for good reason. I'm staying long, and think it will recover some before earning are announced."
these analyst are worse then Cramer predicting anything...always wrong and after the fact
"If you want to buy, I would recommend watching for a few more days. Could be better opportunities in store. Dividend cut for a company like this is a horrible sign."
Kraft Heinz should trade at $40+. The turnaround is real. Great thing to come.
"Looks a lot better dropping into earnings , gives a better change to jump higher . Would have worried if KHC had just keep moving higher into earnings for sure then it would have dropped no matter what they posted."
any guesses where the bottom is in this?
Let the 2 weeks to ex-dividend run begin today also. The perfect storm!
Heinz alone is worth 50 bil. Lol
"when they suspen the dividend and address the debt, I'll buy. I'm guessing that'll be around 15 dollars. if they don't, the company will continue on its slow and painfully death spiral. if they do suspenf the dividend and pay debt, they could restart the dividend down the road and stock would move back up to 50. but it is a 5 year process, IMO"
buffy was a little shell shocked and unsettled this morn talking with b quickmy guess he will start unloading khc by next quarter
when will be the next dividend paid out? does anyone know the date?
"FWIW: yahoo recommend ratings (bar graphs) noticed today are all holds, buy, and strong buy. markedly up from november."
This is a buy!!!
I think they will sell Maxwell house before announcing the plan in the spring..they should sell planters and cool aide and some others also...pay down debt and circle.wagons on heinz
Look if Buffett is not adding what does that tell you?
ex divy..now we find out how many people will continue to hold..maybe more write downs and dividend is not a sure thing..I believe after the smoke clears in a few years this will go way higher..looking at panic selling to further a cheap position for the future..long term.holding
Just Remember Folks.......Analyst Just Said Over Valued with a $27 Price Target !
dividend is solid
"$KHC consolidating, forming a nice bull flag. New pole coming this week."
Can someone explain to me why Google finance's PE is 14.7 and Yahoo is 5? Also why is there such a huge difference between trailing and forward PE on Yahoo?
steady progression with healthy volume signals big gains ahead111 Accumulation completed and later DISTRIBUTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bought Friday AH 35.02
aiming for 35 today atleast
@Stock Trader been pumping this all the way down.
Been a nice stock for me bought at $ 22.0
"If KH wants to buy a health food brand,Nature's Path Foods is the one to buy.Kraft bought their Lifestream brand and then re-sold it back to them."
"NO more cuts in dividend , say the Sage of Omaha:""Kraft Heinz should improve its balance sheet.Buffett is known for his winning investments, but his track record is far from perfect. One of his most disappointing large investments in recent years has been Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC), which is down 72.7% overall in the past three years. Buffett's view is Kraft Heinz has too much debt and it should keep things simple by focusing on paying down debt and maintaining its 6.3% dividend. ""The debt holders are going to get the interest, and the debt should come down by y"
BET YOUR LIFE....BUFFETT WAS BUYING YESTERDAY. THE MAN KNOWS VALUE WHEN HE SEES IT !!!!
Anyone read latest article on private brand Kirkland and market cap of approximately 75 billion. I don’t see how Kraft/Heinz can compete
PE still much to high for a company with results like these. Clearly they can't grow in this market like the share price would indicate. Mid to low 60s is coming before next ER
any move higher in KHC is now only a chance to sell the rips and don't buy the dips until after the full plan is out
khc is down 1 cent as of 5:37 est
My feeling is this will continue to decline over time due to the unhealthy processed foods they offer. The trend is healthy eating and it’s growing rapidly.
"Ketchup shortage, lol. KHC is pushing production to print more money. Tremedous amount of growth as the US president said."
"prob was it was a trifecta div decreased, earnings decreased and sec looking at youbuffy aint too fond of shaky management"
if this goes to 75..I retire early..if zero I work to 67
You know there is trouble with the financial and operating data they present when you cant even get your earnings reports and govt filings in on time.
it definitely needs to touch that 29.70 support today. look at the chart its a big down trend.
Call options 37.5 March 15 wait for Fibonacci retrace make 100% or more
This is just the start of declining. You’ll see a real collapse upcoming. The decline of yesterday and today is still gentle. The real monster hasn’t arrived but is on its way.
KHC has something against $36
Buy pepsi out right with bud.split the company khc. Take frito lay and other money makers they have 22 biilon dollars product. Sell dsd side of business direct store delivery (beer trucks)cut out the middle and upper angetment and start to make money
My biggest regret is buying kraft and Heinz’
"@Stock Trader 2 days ago: ""If Buffetts team starts buying more while he's talking it will take a small amount to make this pop to $40 -$43.@Stock Trader 2 day ago"
Kraft Heinz reached a 52 Week high at 35.82
"Bought shares at $34.5 and 2029 4.625% notes at par. Sales are increasing and cash flow is immense - particularly with the lower dividend. This is a stock that the market will ""discover"" when the recession hits."
"Geez, where's the bottom."
Just follow the net income from operations. KHC IS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD COMPANY. Artificial intelligence trading is utter nonsense if you are an “investor” and have a long view. If you’re trying to get rich quick the markets will crush you.
expect another huge quarter..especially with covid raging in u.s...last quarter was a home run..more good news ahead.for.khc long term
Sold again. Just way to many red flags in packaged food and this still has a PE to high for their results. Anything but a great ER will send this to fresh 52 week lows and nothing makes me think they can have a great QTR. The rest of the industry has shown mixed to bad results and KHC looks to be the same. Also the DIV is to high paying out 70% of earnings leaving less for debt and new acquisitions. That failed Unilever buyout looks like a bad joke in hindsight with UL having over twice the market cap of KHC now. Very possible this goes under 50 with a weak ER.
Bought huge at the close yesterday. Debt is going to come down fast. SP will be restored back to the $60-90 range. Especially if there is a flight to safety.
If Warren buffet is such a genius why did he buy such a large chunk of this company?
6.75% dividend
Buying after sell off is better than buying a growth stock!!
Get ready for a little pop. Buffet going to market to buy the extra 10% of shares he was waiting for. Wonder if he paid the CS guy to release that timely target.
Woohoo!!!! bought today for a quick rebound
This stock is way underpriced. The right price is 40.00 with a .40 dividend and a 4% yield.
If divy gets cut the stock will dip then start a long steady climb back up to 50
Did you really believe any company with Warren and Berkshire Hathaway behind it could possibly fail? Go to laugh at the shorties. KHC is going to rocket from here. Zacks article is enough to do it...
This is under value for a wile
"Great volume looks like it's the flush and KHC is now going higher , Get your shares , To good of a dividend and $1.44 for a stock trading this low . The flush is now happening"
"Same thing in Canada, everything from KHC is almost sold out... Ketchup gone, kraft dinner gone... Then millennials will discover the real taste versus the store brand.... Kraft/Heinz inventories will go down very fast..."
KHC finally has the reverse hockey stick technical indicator. Better ask my magic 8 ball what to do next.
khc revenue 26B Market Cap 40Blyft revenue 2B Market cap 20 B KHC stock price should be 124$or lyft should be 3$both industrial are comparative wait and watch
I am buying all I can under 30 dollars a share.
Khc processing the books like they process their products. Whole lot of filler and artificial additives. Khc revenue will continue to fall. Less and less meals are home prepped thanks to 3rd party delivery and cheaper automated POS/accounting platforms for micro restaurants popping up locally daily
State Street had some accounting issues back in 2010-11. Had to pay 34 mil or so to the feds. They have a big stake in Kraft. Things that make you go hmmm!
"news now strongly indicates 2019-nCoV is in infancy and infected numbers pandemically are not calcuable. of course s&p and futures daily gulping the short koolaid. this can last. with the latest ""you need more than a cough mask"" to navigate the bagel bite aisles, market pain exposed. if you travel alot, we do, easy to see ticket prices attractive. fed can't fix this nor can Jamie. was told by young person today that Chicken Soup and Aspirin may do wonders."
If the share price remains at this level much longer there will be a buyout.
"Thestreet.com: Down over 60% from its 2017 highs, Kraft Heinz has been on an ugly ride. Let's look to see if the $34 to $35 area can hold up. If it can't, this one is in no man's land. If this area does hold as support, look to see if Kraft Heinz stock can get back above downtrend support (blue line). If it can, a snap-back rally into the low-$40s is possible."
I found out Kraft owns one of my favorite brands: Primal Kitchen. I'm really thinking about buying some shares!
i see KHC at or around 45$ in less than a year.
"The whales of Wall Street are going to flush out any retail shorts and run it up into earnings.You want to confirm any rally in KH versus the consumer staples ETF XLP.The KH AGM is on April 23,another reason to run the stock up.See you in 2 weeks!"
buy some shares with the cash from your dividends payout .
It's coming. There will be upgrades. There will be government help as well. They are doing so much - all voluntarily - because they can easily weather this storm.
Poor volume..
New 52 weeks high !! Booom !!!
Buying at a minimum of a 10% discount to Buffet and 3g. Only in america. Even if Buffet/3g just get to even money we make 10% minimum. What a beautiful day! Buying half at the open and half at the close
Just sold out my position until the dust settles. If you can’t trust the numbers then you are gambling
one of these earnings reports they will not take write downs..and it will be a blow out quarter..maybe oct 29?
"After the 8:30 conference call this stock is going to go. up at least 6% overall the results of earnings are not that bad. In fact, I would call it. On its way to recovery."
adding to my position i started a week ago. anyone else buying more today? i know khc debt is high but i don't see this company going away any time soon.
This is a secure long term investment stock . Easy
$55 Soon!Guarantee!!
That was an amazing reversal. No telling where it will close but unbelievable move today.
"Could someone explain why they now sell planter ? I had understood that the cheese business was a low profit business and that it made sense to sell it to a bigger cheese/milk company, but planter ? What is the point in selling it ? I haven’t read any good explanation. Why not cancel the dividend for a year if the goal is to pay down debt ? I want a company to grow, not to be sold part by part...The only good news is that we now know that all the intangibles and the goodwill on the balance sheet are really worth something..."
Buffet doesn't have the midis touch any longer.
"Folks when and if the economy tanks... we still need to eat our burgers, Mac & Cheese and kids take their lunchables to school. This is a safe stock at this price and it pays a good dividend."
"I am a buyer if it gets back to the 20's. Bottomline, they need higher quality products. Millennials do not want Kraft Singes or Velveeta. I am neutral short term, but bullish in the mid to long term."
I like to add at 28 love the dividend.
price was double this amount in August of 2018. You may not like the company but it is way over sold here.
all the usual suspects out in force to drive this down..barons leads the drive
"BUYBUYBUY, i have 3 million more usd to buy this."
"Time will tell, u can pump it or bash it. But earnings makes the grade. I personally believe it's very very salvageable. But I admit it's a risk."
Yea my target and Walmart is gonna be cleaned out again . ChaCHING!
Don’t buy this today on a small bump. If your long hold on. If you don’t have a position wait for it to crater. I dont have a position (yet) but I have been on the wrong end of a similar downward spiral. There are longs who will still bail with the slightest bump. The knife is still falling.
Warren Buffer rumored to be bidding $85-90 for Kraft-iconic brands
why is M. Burry so interested in this stock. hedge for inflation or has something changed in the past year that will turn the tide from the last 5 years? Anyone have insight to share? bears and bulls welcome.
"Khc is price way below intrinsic value(48). Think about it, your not going to find a stock at this price that pays 4.8% yield. If you buy today, you’ll get the dividend in 3 days plus any incremental value. It’s way oversold, and guess who bought all those million of shares during the last 10 days. BERKSHIRE. He said he wouldn’t so not to spike the price. Buffet doesn’t have to disclose his purchase until next quarter which is in May. By then price is going to be back at 48 and everyone is going to forget. The lawsuits are bunch hot air. Look at Frontier Communications. Nothing ever happened"
"Analyst RatingsKRAFT HEINZ (NASDAQ:KHC) PRICE TARGET AND CONSENSUS RATING21 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Kraft Heinz in the last 12 months.

Probably taking an L tomorrow. Thought maybe this gain $2 like HRBs recent drop
"I just bought 10,000 shares at $32.26. I’ll unload when it crosses $40 next week. "
why is yahoo posting and posting old negitive news on kraftsome kinda of con going on
"If Buffett bought this for much higher, shouldnt you own this now?"
"The Wall Street AI computers are starting to show a switch from sellers to buyers, Might just get a pretty good run higher in KHC and for sure they will over do it. Looking for a move back into the $40's"
"I won't be surprised if we see $ 40 before the third quarter, especially if earnings are 30% above expectations"
"care less sh price or eps which is in dumps and forecast to stay there. div is all that matters to us. preme mmf was cash cow even as late as last year. now, it's a wipe out with less than quarter point. we're small game and that was over 10k hit a month. suspect with 5% sustainable one would think peeps would be standing in line for even $40 share price as it wouldn't matter. of course, you robinhood acct holders know better."
"Looks like a miss, o'well. Would have been nice to show some forward progress"
Bought more
how much real estate does Kraft Heinz own and where do find the details of their properties?
Is it possible Warren was wrong again?
"This stock is a BUY and HOLD. I predicted it would be up $5 within 2-weeks, we're heading back up there now. Hold for longer and you will see it back over $50."
"Millennials saddled with $100Ks of debt can't afford any brand name shopping. Can't even afford a house, get real people.. middle class went out with the Boomer Gen."
I think they will continue to pay the dividend in the near term
what just happened
How long before the bleeding stops?
i got 48 ave here. any chances to see khc at 48 in next 3-6 month? or with those problems... can go lower?
"Krafting losses. They'll have to cut their dividend soon at this rate, yield keeps getting higher"
"I gotta imagine shorts are getting a little scared. That most recent pull back just allowed KHC to get on the spring board. If we get a good earnings call, the MACD will cross over the zero line on the daily since it’s very close, giving us an extra technical pop. That pop will also push the MACD over the zero line on the weekly candles (also on the cusp)... for the first time in 2 years. I initiated my position a couple weeks ago and have been averaging down into earnings."
PE is 13.72 right now. Still much to high for a company with these results. Target price is 43
"I'll tell you the best time to buy a name like KHC, which is down substantially year-to-date. Sometime around December 15. It's not likely that this name will get back up to $45 in this calendar year. So, a lot of investors will sell it for a tax loss in December. When you see an escalation in volume on its final leg down in December, pick up some shares and between late December'19 and January'20, you will see a nice gain in the name."
2 years.. stock is flat. cheers to the longs. I'm out.
If you need to worry about the price of Heinz ketchup or the store brand (watered down garbage). You probably shouldn't be investing in the stock market. You need a healthy emergency fund first.
Planters peanuts are the best by far. Heinz ketchup is the best by far. Therefore I am all in.
Hard to believe KHC traded in the 80 range not that long ago.
"I’ve been investing in battered stocks for quite awhile. Looking at the charts, KHC looks like a definite strong buy IMO..."
BOUGHT TODAY hoping buffet can get khc back to at least 50 and keep the good div
No restaurants no ketchup stock should be around $18 end of week
SA is calling 40$ USD
"buy the panic selling, like always will be genius."
"closing in on buy alert. be mindful. buy in tranche. if you're giving thoughts to 25K share initial tranche, would use puts for swap ins. know of what i speak. good fortune to you."
"Kraft Heinz still knows how to dominate shelf space in stores, which is tough to do. It'll come back"
"Just jumped in at $34.19 , hope it pays off??"
I thought Warren knew more than the rest of us.
I’ll sell one-third at 55 maybe
the dream for me is to break even. thats it =)
"vet's day today and we did our camaraderie at legion yesterday. no volume today, and earnings season all but done, we coast to 2020. there's a few buys in cons staples lurking, but those are dependent on acquisition. KHC should stay range bound, as in it's very safe for now. div could suffer but that would not be surprise to trust holders. be mindful that as sh price rises, it will, div is cut organically. btw, we have reduced sh CTL and PPC. have a few min today: give a listen to ""richard rogers"" victory at sea."
"columbine capital/affiliated with Fidelity, downgrades KHC one position."
Lol...I purchased 2500 shares of XOM at $36.63. Now it's +$62 and I earn $3.48 in dividends. Keep wallowing with KHC.
About 50 moves like today and we'll have something.
This is brutal. Sorry anyone who took this hit. I never would have expected it from KHC
Mute the paid pessimists and enjoy the king of stocks KHC.
Was Planters division Losing money?Will Kraft see a big revenue cut due to the sale.I guess I just don’t understand Big Business.Buy Buy Buy?
If Soros and Buffet like Kraft ..... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/george-soros-top-6-buys-220919045.html
This market is only interested in tech stocks which is moving by day traders. It will eventually see a big correction. Its a sham.
"Buffet The Baggie Had A BAD KHC DAY ! A 1.1 BILLION LOSS !The famed investor's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate owns about 27% of the food giant, according to Bloomberg data. The value of its stake plunged to $8.7 billion from $9.8 billion between Thursday and Friday, after a one-two punch of disappointing earnings and a credit-rating cut pummeled Kraft Heinz shares.TIMMMMMMBAHHHH !"
$55 Soon!!
"My question is: why would any sane, self-aware person be buying this stock now except to cover a short position. Please sell."
"All the bad news was put out at once for a reason. This stock found it's floor on Friday. Buffet will help this stock recover starting at 6am on Monday. Fingers crossed he will buy the rest of the stock, since they already have almost a third, and take this company private. Keep in mind he has been touting that he has been looking for something big to buy. If you hold your shares it will go over $53. IMO"
building cause until New plan is announced..if they sell Maxwell House and have a new path set this could be a beautiful spring
This drop after the COVID pumped profits euphoria wears off is expected. They are selling one of their only two edible products. 3G and Buffett ruined two formerly okay US brands. Once COVID is over KHC drops back under 30. Nobody eats plastic kraft cheese and cold lunchables crackers in 2021.
Adding more tomorrow . Ive owned this since it was spun off . Crazy this was a 80+ dollar stock not too long ago. I can see some brands being sold off with the restructuring . This is a winner long term from here.
"Not to be greedy, but would love to get back to $70."
"Just blocked UrMoney and the sky turned blue, the birds start singing again lol.. relief!"
Down 5% post market?
Rate cuts makes debt easier thus up up
"I think its nice that Kraft Heinz is donating millions to help feed the world; however, I think they need to worry about their shareholders. the stock dumped from the sixty dollar mark and is sitting in the twenty dollar range. If the company is doing so well raise your dividend higher again! You know the old saying charity begins at home. Protect your shareholders."
"W@W ! There Ya Go........Another..........52 WEEK LOW ! Amazing this is holding up as well as it is Today with all the Bad News, Buffet Has Got to BeThinking...........Just Sell and Get Out of This !"
"when aaple was 150 a share, bad news happened and it went down for another 10 usd, a lot of haters lots of issues. this is another aaple."
1. 30B debt2. Food has negative nutritional value3. Losing market share and pricing power to private labels4. Could go bankrupt and that might increase the health of Americans
Billy Ray Valentine has called the market on KHC - will be trading at 38 by next earnings announcement.
Finishing green today
I could run this company 10 times better than management over the past 3 years. need Kraft Heinz Premium brand 2x the cost of the normal brand but with healthy quality ingredients. Capture more of the market share that way. KHC has ignored the natural foods market for too long. One of the Reasons we continue to drop. Consumer taste is changing. Consumers want new products. With KHC platform it woulf have no issues capturing more profit.
Is there not an earning call?
"Something is going to dig this thing back up you wait and see when all sell too low!!! KHC is long term, but someone in control out there has no patience and will drive it up sooooooon!"
the sudden crash in oil prices has triggered today monday down futures.
Close to 3M shares trade hands in the first 5 minutes!
"Listen guys, KHC will be fine. Anyone buying today will be richer next month. This isn't circuit city Ge cotton gin stocks, or Schlumberger. It's the blue box and bill Cosby favorite dessert!!"
"Get company, stock went from 97 to 56."
"Come a recession, millennials will stop loading up their credit cards and will turn back to this."
For any long term holders of KHC shares. It appears the company's total debt on the balance sheet increased since the last few quarters?
Does anyone know why the dip was in the last half an hour of the trading session?
374 shares in I bought in at 22. First time in the market . Going long
"I bought on the dive on Friday.. Great value with a 11 PE even now, and a $1.60 dividend, with first payable March 8th. After the dividend, I will sell 30 day covered calls. Ride it up..."
CEO has to go
"Cheese business was getting killed. Store brands, especially Walmart Great Value equally good AND much cheaper. Everything KHC sells is being sold by someone else at an equivalent quality and cheaper. Granted I haven't seen Walmart ""Snackables"". but the combo of a cookie, a cracker a piece of cheese and some processed meat isn't something sane people want to replicate."
4.8 Billions Free Cash Flow for a 59 Billions market cap company is incredible. The price setter ability of KHC is showing its moat.
Are you getting ready for analysts' upgrades from this point on?
and I'm in - great entry point
Shorted SNAP... but I think buy KHC at these levels makes more sense. We can see a $6.50 to $7.50 reversal here soon. This is an overdone!! I like my burgers  with ketchup always.
I see Maxwell house and Heinz on sale this month at Costco..maybe some others also..I think we are going to see every trick in the book to move inventory right now and next quarter will beat estimates
Up big today it must be because of management as well
"To set the record straight, revenue beat estimates. 6.38M vs 6.31M estimate. Commodity costs are hurting the bottomline."
"PB 1, almost no other company so cheap now on the market."
"you can still take 5 top competitors of khc, tally up ALL their long term debt and IT WOULD STILL BE LESS THAN KHC'S!!"
"was looking at a few stocks i own aapl, noc, google, nflx, pgr, jpm, bmy, back in ba, mcd and just couldn't justify buying khc. maybe the quarter will be good and the balance sheet will be improved somehow so i can buy a few shares in a few weeks."
"Only ""PUDDINHEADS"" sell this stock- the fund manipulators- same as last year this time"
Big profits coming for KHC...https://thedailychronicle.in/news/562107/ready-meals-market-to-see-drastic-growth-post-2020-hormel-foods-nestle-kraft-heinz/
KHC could solve most of its problems by announcing that they are getting involved in the Cbd infused food business.
Good value at this price level.
Insiders are buying.
BW already said what the next move is... get greedy. Mark my word.
Wow lol my 100 shares at 32.5 lookin bad.
"This stock has never let me down. Every time I look at it, it is in the red. I hope it can turnaround. Anyways, maybe in a few years it will go back up. The stock market has been beating me up lately."
Strong beat in ER and predicting mid single digit top and bottom line going forward with a solid dividend. Continue to believe KHC is good part of a balanced portfolio and will perform.
"My grocery was selling super cheap Heinz BBQ... bought like 6 bottles. May not be fat free or organic, but very very delicious. Almost perfect, hits the spot!"
This stock will fly to 60 end of year !
So what's the news that is driving this run?
Don't know if this is 3G but if it is they need their bxlls detached.
Kraft Heinz trades like they are filling for bankruptcy
"This entire board has become a spam fest...plus webr (even worse). I am so unimpressed by KHCs PR...how they promote themselves, the news, the buzz. Which is why there is none... which is why people still think this is the same KHC it was two years ago ...which is why we know nothing of the turnaround plan they've been working on for 20 months. Now I hear about a big push to 40...breakout levels...finally news...and we go down Wth"
Do they make Velveeta ???? ...... is it real cheese????
Trading at ALL TIME LOW pre-market now....
We're going back to the 70's every quarters from here
"really surprised no one talks about how good great value ketchup, mustard and other goodies are from walmart are or some of target's market pantry stuff on the board here. very interesting as a lot of those products taste just as good and are half the price of khc products. lots of folks have tried them and leave stunning reviews on their websites."
they put all the bad news on one quarter for a reason..could show a couple good quarters now without much trouble..I think upside potential out weights down
Time to buy. About to pop real soon.
two days in a row up---instead of enjoying the gain I am nervous about a pullback --- I would feel much better if there was an obvious reason for this increase----we don't go up 3% in two days for no reason
All Kraft products are are sold out!!!!
"They will be cutting the divy again; they didn't want to put the stock in freefall all at once. The funny thing is the cut they made won't do that much to patch up the debt , especially with falling sales."
"Let's be honest....suppose $25k fell from the heavens, what stock would you invest in? Aside from that I'll give you 5 choices...T, KHC, SJM, XOM, MO.This is just for fun and frolic. Really curious!"
If you are looking for dividend you might want to check out IVZ pays around 7.32% and they just posted great earnings and it goes ex-dividend on Nov 8 Was Bill Gross's number on pick
This company is an American mainstay. Start moving already. I need a massage!!
My opinion the former CEO was in way over his head. Like the CEO of IBM. But the current one no. he invested a lot of his own money into the stock. That bodes well imo.
buffet owns shares and their products sells out everyday RIP shorts
Why is this down today?Any news?
"Phladelphia cream cheese dip no longer has any cream cheese in the formula. Now, the no #1 ingredient is modified milk product (which apparently is just whey), and the #2 ingredient is water. Once again, a formerly tasty product has been watered down to the point that it tastes like crud.Kraft will NEVER recover market share when they engage in such flagrant recipe and ingredient downgrading. Is this a food company, or a chemical company....because looking at the list of ingredient in philly dip, and virtually any other Kraft product, one needs an advanced degree in chemistry to comprehend what is being consumed.It was appropriate that Kraft dropped the word ""Foods"" from their name, because what they are selling certainly isn't food any longer."
20 dollars soon
This is a rock stock and will drop to 12. Kroger mayonnaise is as good as any.
Just saw Cramer holding up two bottles of Hienz Ketchup.
I see a lot of optimists on this board. I wish you all the luck in the world. My bet would be that they will miss EPS estimates and cut the dividend to an industry average and start to pay down the debt.
there we go. bring on that new LOW.
will buy a MOUNTAIN LOAD of puts once there is even a glimmer of things getting better.
"Already undervalued on a red day, fly little bird, fly "
Buying now
if they can keep dividend this is a buy
"There are some good and bad points to invest in KHC, but the bad point is Warren Buffet wants the stock to drop as low as it can before stepping in to buy it up. He said he isn't buying nor selling and pointed out that he paid to much when he bought it. The good news is they are still profitable and they have new healthy brand products in their pipe line to off set the old unhealthy ones. A turn around is imminent, but the question is how low will it go before the big guy steps in?"
THEY LOSS OVER $9 PLUS A SHARES THE WORST IS YET TO COME THIS WILL CRASH XRASHBELOW $15 INTHECOMINGMONTH TO QUARTERS
Warren Buffett is almost as old as Krogers marketing strategy.Both are fossils that should be in a museum. 2 years from now Kroger is going to be worse off than $KHC.
finally some numbers and discussion about business..both management been wwaaaayyy too silent for a company this size
Bought more at 26.33. Hope the floor is 26.00. I will wait to see the turnaround plan the 1st of the year as promised.
BIG MONEY TO BE MADE IF COMPANY IS REJUVENATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUFFET WILL SPEND TO DO SO
Kevin trying too hard lol
6% divs nice up 1% I’m in
Warren Buffett could right this ship anytime he wanted to.Pause and reflect on why it's not happening.
"Still pays a $1.60 annual dividend. With the treasury at 2.64%, KHC is buyable here because of the divvy.."
So long 60's.....it was fun while it lasted :(
BARRONS SAID BUY KHC ON SUNDAYS TV SHOW...I AGREE...BUT THEY SHOULD CUT THE DIV. SO THEY COULD USE THAOSE $2 BILLION A YEAR TO PAY DOWN THEIR ENORMOUS DEBT OF LIKE $30 BILLION...
Good buy
I will buy now and hold long . Thanks
"WEBR....AINT TO SMART. IF HE THINKS KHC IS GOING ANYWHERE BUT UP, WELL AS I SAID HE LIKELY USES HIS HEAD FOR A HAT RACK. BUFFETT IS INTIMATELY INVOLVED NOW!!! KHC IS A PRIORITY OF HIS AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM BACKING BUFFETT ON THIS ONE. I BUY THE NEXT DIP, AND YES THERE WILL BE ONE BEFORE THE RECOVERY PLAN IS COMMUNICATED AFTER THE 1ST OF THE YEAR. BANK IT !!!!"
"should earnings october 31 start at .54¢ or higher, coupled with announcement of div decrease, would expect khc to drop after hours and increase to over 30+. why: debt is being reduced as i type at you and rates on debt are crashing. all good news. plant consolidation, more heinz select branding, and better shipping rates. know what you're reading grasshoppers."
Organic foods projected to quadruple to 325 billion by2025. KHC has the unique opportunity to buy HAIN foods.Their stock would rally hard on deal.If not HAIN there are some other opps but HAIN products KHC could increase their sales 10 fold with their distribution network .organics is the futureEither become relevant or look at a 40$ stock
"This isn't a bankruptcy , Oversold"
They will have to double the sale of nitrates and empty calories to dent the 30b debt
I bought 200. I figure it's time.
GOING PRIVATE
Incredible discount to setup for a BUYOUT of major brand names.Won't stay down in April.
"I would look for earnings coming out of KHC soon , Why because Wall Street is just about done driving KHC lower with their coordinated attacks of KHC."
whats everyones cost average. Mines 32.60
Just bought in. Long KHC.
2 million shares traded @ close. That’s the largest volume since 3/1. Interesting that after that large volume traded the stock went 3.5% up.
"KHC will buy a company when everyone least expects it. Then, skyrocket back into the 90's. Buckle up baby!"
Power growth right here!! Forget PayPal an Amazon and Workday!! KHC!!!
Worst investment ive made besides Nio Lol...
Woo-Hoo..!!! Rates will be zero for a long time. Kraft Heinz will benefit hugely as they pay down debt.
49 coming end of week. Sad.
"Sold at 41 bought at 27, 2 k shrs. Still get next div lol extra punch "
"I think I would be more worried about the millennials and the banking system and big banks than KHC . Why because the millennials don't need big banks. For sure once Facebook and Apple become banks , All the big banks are toast Why because they hate the big banks anyway and they are on their phones 24 hours a day."
Tomorrow is options expiry. Those with $25 calls want it up the price puts with
"The stock could also get bought out as the current EV to EBITDA looks moderately appealing and we can see someone offering $40/share to take this private. Considering the huge amount of dollars involved, we think everyone knows who that someone could be. We are upgrading this to a buy."
"Have only been loosely following for last 24 months with a couple of swings for profits but I took a look to see if there was any entry. Have to say, I think the dividend needs to be cut. I think this is going to $20."
is AH trade real up $1.46 to $34.60.
Man this stock is drowsy. Expected much better gains by now.
Congrats to those that held. The price to day trade shares keeps going up.
Sweet! I am definitely a buyer here……
"Also, technically it is sooo far outside the bollinger bands, it is bound to snap back."
"the list effect: skipping LAtex logs and minutiae. know the list effect and searches. well know KHC is accumulating rank and positivity. bots know this and probably care less that i'm telling you. it's happening now and becoming routinely evident. make up your own mind, and looks can be deceiving. however, if a correct read, you may not want to miss this one and dislike yourself for doing so in coming years."
Too late to buy?
Just put a order to buy shares in the low $20's and you just might get filled when they cut the dividend.
"now the slime pro's are going after the ""safe"" dividend stocks like At&t, Verizon, KHC, EPD, to make sure there is nowhere to hide!! Despite good profits etc. they are giving negative calls so they can start bottom feeding off of our loses!!"
I love KFC! Best fast food around! Go Colonel!
"My expectation is that KHC wil be back in the $40s next week, if not they will quickly become a tasty (pun intended) buyout target."
I have a position here and when insiders buy in the 28.50 area it is not going back to new lows period. I would b adding imo. Don't let the bashers scare you out.
Nice Buffet inspired bounce.Looking forward to my bid in the $52 area being filled.
"$877M of Free Cash Flow in first 6 months of 2019.Not exactly in ""trouble"" like the negative articles are trying to portray."
Heavy buying of the $62.50 October calls continues.............
Predict stock will rise from 0930 - 0945 then who knows.Warren will be CNBC for three hours on Monday.FACT: Warren's mom was confined to an insane asylum. Maybe it runs in the family.What's the difference between insanity and genius? Answ: SUCCESS

just reviewed the quarterly financials again..this company is fine..all smoke that they are in trouble..free cash flow 532m...after dividend..2.3b cash..debt down to 28b already...you can sell coffee and a couple others and pay debt way down and still pay dividend if you want..non problem
Down from 100 to 26 in 5 years - Buffett just sat on the stock and didn't force the change in management? KHC didn't have to go down so much.
"Congrats Buffet. You may have topped Time Warner buying AOL in 2000 with Kraft/ Heinz. As a holder of this and BRK, I believe he needs to step down."
The dividend appears to be $1.60 (Not $2.50) based on their most recently declared quarterly dividend of $.40.
"Cramer's droning and ranting on and on about KHC, and how he warned viewers to stay away from the stock months ago, when it was trading in the $50-60's. Well, he was right back then, but bashing it now, at this bottom of the barrel value, is just silly. So, take heart, KHC should be recovering some, from these depressed levels."
i sold out price was getting too high! Good luck longs!
"Down one dividend payment today and down every single day since the 8th when the CEO chickened out of slashing the DIV and putting that money back into the company. That debt is not going to magically disappear on its own. Those outmoded brands are not going to magically become popular again. Vote ""C"" in as new CEO because I would have the stones to make the tough calls now not in a year when things are much worse."
"The wildcards tomorrow are new CEO and how the company moves forward. Does the dividend come under fire. What type of asset sales of non performing assets. Does the company buy back its stock. EPS, revenue forecasts are only part of the story. I own the stock but I'm also hedged..."
"EPS revisions as Zacks cited points, in their words, a bullish overview. they also gave a % chance of upward direction using eps revisions in general. lots of calculus i'm certain. regardless, and couple that with straddle suggestion, not certain we will have a ""wash"" or no move, one way or other. expect a move per the math, as it seems given."
"Seeing some new marketing in grocery stores, especially the Miracle Whip displays. What to watch for from new CEO https://www.thestreet.com/markets/kraft-heinz-new-strategy-15082220?puc=yahoov&cm_ven=YAHOOV&yptr=yahoo"
Oversold for sure. See how even new bad news can't move it down much? It's like a spring pushed down as far as it can go...
KHC is rolling over and will head down despite a dead cat bounce soon. Younger people are not buying what they sell and the company has ties to Kerry and his wife. All good reasons to stay away.
"i bet big on this, glorious!"
Dow futures +140 looks like a nice day for the market overall yet KHC trending lower. Lotsa luck to all the cheerleaders on here. Keep shaking your pompoms.
Management change needs to happen here. They are out of touch with today’s consumer. Buy CHD and use their management to run the Combined business.
Will earnings surprise to the upside or disappoint to the downside? Current stock price action suggests disappoint.
Due to the Corona virus fears Kraft mac and cheese dinners along with Heinz ketchup are flying off the store shelves. Food Lion is having trouble keeping these items stocked.
"135,000,000 shares traded with a range of $1.49 Low $34.51, High $36.00That is a tight range."
$NWL and $KHC are terrific buys but not long term holds.
Nice early reversal.
Bought 500. A bargain. 
So what is the deal here? Why the misses? Is it still cost of materials being a drag on earnings? Too be honest this a small holding of mine so I dont follow it very closely.
Folks.... futures up and shorts crying. Lol ... it’s going to be a very good day thanks to the shorts.

Own khc cag k t mo m sold algn and wdc way too early
Question for me that how KHC will lower its longterm debt in coming years ? I really want to invest in this beautiful company .
"Tons of buyers below 31.75. Go ahead shorts, bring it down there...it wont go below that."
How come KHC has not bought Impossible Meats already? I fear Kraft's vegetable burger has been left in the dust.
"This is a classic scenario, has happened to many big brands, and they came back from it."
Goldman downgrade meaning-less.
Question for you If GS wants KHC to go lower. KHC will go lower. Why because they control the news
"If Buffet is off the board, maybe they will be able to be more aggressive to acquire something big... I hope for Kellog or Pepsico. That would be amazing and bring the stock back to 90$. The stock went down because the Unilever deal failed. The good news is Buffet is still there to back-up, but not in the aggressive acquisition discussions."
Kraft Heinz shares (ticker: KHC) closed down 6.6% Tuesday to $29.06 after reports of weak trends in food sales based on scanner data in the four weeks ended in mid-May.
Roy boy. Salute to me. There is an official on message board.
So Khc will have a good year then back to the gloom..
Goldman clients...lol
Brutal day for consumer staples and KHC on heavy volume.Started buying KHC today at 59.78.Some whale bought 10000 KHC calls Oct.18 expiry at 62.50.Cost around $2.5 million
"Iconic name, but looking at what is under the hood i.e. financial. This company is a hot mess. $36 billion in goodwill and a further $49 billion in intangible assets. Sure one can say there is some value for patents, trademark, etc but $49 billion.... I think that is significantly lofty. If write-offs don't scare you then you should be afraid of the $30 billion in long term debt. I see management cutting the dividend to $0.05 per qtr. This is definitely a disaster."
What about Buffet's 2 rules?1 Don't lose money.2 See rule 1
Why would anybody buy before Buffett ‘s interview tomorrow morning?
the balance sheet is even worse than it looked before this. that's really not good
Sold at 32.14 appx 3 weeks ago. Been watching it for a buy again. I don't believe near term bottom in until it gets to the Goldman call for 29. Time will tell.
"Well... Maybe I missed something... A lot of bashing here... For such a company the big thing to look at is the cash flow, and the operating cash flow increased from 2,6 billion in 2018 to 3,6 billion in 2019. Moreover debt decreased significantly during the same period. I am not saying this is the best company of the world, but they are still a strong cash machine. CONSTRUCTIVE comments appreciated"
Buffett always said buy when there’s blood in the street so I just loaded up ! Wish me luck ! Long term has to come back people still need to eat
If Buffet’s team starts buying more stock while he is talking... it will take a small amount to make this Pop to $40 - $43.
Warren and 3G capital can stick this stock where the sun don't shine
..too cheap...accumulating shares for long term with a nice dividend payout...
After last week's run its natural that we go down a bit. This week GIS and couple other food packaging companies are reporting results----assuming they beat we should go up as well
Any moves higher in KHC should only be sold now. Why because there will be massive Tax loss selling and people will be taking all the losses they can just in case the DEM wits win in 2020. KHC has burned just about any one that invested in it. No one cares what they do and most will be selling any moves higher. For sure 3G and maybe even Warren will be selling to take some of the TAX losses. Sure KHC might go higher but it will be meet with massive tax loss selling. Time to wait for the plan and a new year before even thinking about putting any new money in KHC
I predict a .04 to .06 cent increase in dividend
Never doubted KHC for a single moment. $40 near future. $60 long-term. Ka-Ching.
Has anyone tried the meatless meat? I've heard that it does taste like meat. Would like unbiased opinions.
Don't allow those pseudo experts (analysts) fool you into thinking Kraft Heinz Inc is in trouble.Those analysts are just trying to shake the small investor out of the market of this company.This tactic has been ongoing for years as is the creation of recessions for the same purpose.Don't be fooled by selling at a loss so the money people can pick up your shares at bargainprices.
Once news breaks of closing of cheese deal and a upcoming peanut deal hits forward earnings guidance should be reported and up we go from here!
Bought quite a few calls yesterday. Hope it goes up after earnings and into december.
"Okay, this is funny. Earnings grew from the last years, but we at the 52w lows again at the pre-market"
"Just jumped in big time. Time will tell, but I'm thinking this is one you put in the drawer for 2 years and make a nice 50% when you check back."
How much further down can my beloved company go? I just don’t think Philadelphia Brand cream cheese and Heinz Ketchup are going away. Perhaps I’m wrong but I believe they have a durable competitive advantage such as Coke. I’m all in on this one or the heavens fall. Has anyone on this blog ever had cream cheese on a bagel ? This company is a solid American Brand.
"Sales decline in US YOY by 2.7%....lower shipments of cheese, coffee, cold cuts and bacon offset growth in condiments and sauces. Once again Kraft is dragging down Heinz. If you want to unlock shareholder value split the companies back up again. (Remember Kraft/Mondelez? Or Altria/Philip Morris?)"
"I'm all in at 30 it can't go any lower....my bad, I meant to post that a week ago...."
Why so much hate for ketchup?
Take the tax loses because you still have over 30 days before the plan comes out and that will give you time to get back in if you want to. That way you have the losses book. KHC will need to do a lot of work and I think they will cut the dividend to help with the turn a round and all the debt. Just my take
Continuously averaging down!!! I see my stocks as tenants who constantly pay me rent in form of dividends!!! Hopefully this stays in $26-$32 range!!! 6% annually guaranteed is great!!!!
"KHC Stock seems like the company is intentionally driving its price down to acquire stocks themselves, With no major acquisitions possible immediately and poor q3 results due to high spending, this is an excellent strategy. Has anyone asked why go on a huge training spend when your operating margins are weak and stocks are a 30% less levels within a year. Is the company blind to its investors concern of their share value. I don't think so. I think this stock is worth much more and selling KHC will not be the best idea. It is an excellent buy even at USD 55 levels. So don't miss this opportunity"
I am in. Thank you for the huge discount.
"This is the most manipulated stock in regards to the options market. They swallowed all the $35 calls that closed in January of this year. They take it down whenever they want. I'll bet they swallow all the 37.50 and 40 calls expiring April 16. Its so stupid. There is absolutely no reason why this doesnt slowly rise to fill the gap to $45 from 2019. This rose to $39.20 last week on over 22 million shares traded. Then they pour cold water on it the next day with a downgrade and it drifts down to $36.37. It closed in the gap, but who the hell would be selling this with the ex-dividend date coming in the next 2 weeks? Severe manipulation"
"ok kraft clowns , read [Warren Buffett: Costco's Kirkland brand thrives] http://va.newsrepublic.net/s/MTySNQ"
"For anybody wondering, their 10Q-NT says that they have until 7/31/19 to release their earnings. They have not released FY17 numbers yet and Q1 will come out after those."
"Looking at dividend, how is a dividend of 2.5 equal to a 5% yield on a stock selling for 32?"
"Zacks Downgrades to STRONG SELLBottom LineKraft Heinz is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based, in large part, on its earnings revision trends. The company also sports a “D” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and rests in the bottom 33% of our 256 industries. Therefore, Kraft Heinz might be a stock to stay away from for now, despite its huge fall.Those still interested in the industry might instead consider General Mills, Inc. (GIS), which is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock."
Heinz releases first blend of veggies with ketchup.....KHC is on a roll....the Planters family of nuts has new packaging which has the words NUT_ritional on it; just as ANALysts have spinchter in the name.
4 Analysts upgrade in Feb based on Analysis section in Yahoo. Free cash flow has increased drastically.

Seeking Alpha: Changing My Tune On Kraft Heinz: It's Now A Buy.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4293546-changing-tune-kraft-heinz-now-buy?source=partner_gnews
"A dividend cut, an SEC investigation and crummy earnings? Only down 20 percent? Longs are very lucky it's not down 50 percent. I wouldn't hold this pos for anything!"
Load up now for defensive and dividend play in this part of the market cycle folks. Keep it for awhile and lots of potential ahead. Best in class!
"Hyman Moskowitz, informs us Hunter Biden,is working for KHC, in sales to France.Is this the reason for stock price decline?"
"If pessimism returns this will climb as people rotate to defensive. If optimism rises, sidelined cash will go into funds and indexes holding khc. If they meet earnings, khc will rise. If foodservice fires up, khc while climb."
"retaining a 5% or better dividend with more ""virus"" action keeping vendor/wholesale side or product sidelined not possible. only few of you here have even a dozen shares so doesn't matter. only institutions can afford to hold khc. common sense investors with active acct are not giving khc a thought."
"It reported 7 billions net income. If i even used converservative 4 billions as the income or free cash flow. My valuation of this stock is in the 45 to 55 dollars range. I am still using the Ketchup for my burger and fries. Unless the sales of Burger and fries have decreased. Predictable business and income. Add the Kraft spread on top, you have a yummy stock that will provide stable income and upside."
"sold my shares. 40% loss. replaced it with another dividend paying stock that pays 4%. khc is a mess. maybe they can dig their way out of their situation. maybe they cut their dividend. sell off some brands. whatever they do, it will take time. the other company I bought will recover with the market. not so with KHC. it is down for more reasons than market."
"I used to hold shares in Kraft Heinz a long time ago. Back when they were around 60’s I decided to sell them. Holding the shares when they were around $80’s climbing to $94 after the acquisition rumors I used to come here to this chat, see what people are thinking. The stock fell from $94 per share to $32, I saw people saying that a turn around is near, when it was $70 per share $60 per share $50 per share $40 per share And now the stock is $34 Sometimes to say you were wrong is better than doing just that."
Very undervalued!
Warren Buffett is getting paid 5.4% while he waits for KHC to deliver. He won't sell imo. How do I know that? because I never would at the current level. Second half should be better.
"There were tons of chance for bag holders to escape after my concerning/warning posts on Friday. It was even above 30 this morning around 9am. From now on, it’s the history behind."
I really wanted to buy Kraft but the purchase of another healthy foods losser has changed my mind... These companies will never learn...
ok we have our gamblers and now we wait to see if patricio talks about declining sales and selling off assets to get under the biggest debt in the food industry by far. just like ole times.
"Forget Campbells. Buy Papa Johns or Dominos.Cheese, tomato sauce and meat toppings—all things we can supply them!"
Any insider sales in recent months? 3G and Buffet in big trouble for not disclosing what has been going on? Not good for he overall market. People lose trust in the game.
KHC is a BUY. When was the last time you dined out and the restaurant DID NOT have Heinz ketchup on the table? Enough said.
"Kraft Heinz Co. saw sales gains between 10% and 20% in the rolling four weeks that ended March 8 for items such as soup and breakfast food, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Diana Rosero-Pena sai"
Now comes the short squeeze. Don’t sell into this gain. There’s more to come. 50% of shred is held by 2 individuals and they have no intent to sell. Less sellers naturally more buyers
Earnings ideas?
This stock here is a diamond in the rough. A few changes and before you know it this will be climbing upwards again. Alot of the risk is already priced in.
"A lot of people think this one's going to get bought out and go private. If it does happen, it'll be after the price is in the twenties and they'll offer you 30, and you'll think it's a Christmas gift."
"short shares and float dropping as Straddles are evaporating. expect short straddles to appear again in 34-35 sh price range. of course, puts priced when sh are 34-35; expect put contracts to be spendy. favorable for our porfolios.

JUST A CLUE SMART MONEY MAKES MONEY ON THE WAY UP AND ON THE WAY DOWN AND IT CONTROLS THE SPEED
To me we are experiencing the final sell-off. Downgrade of CS and sell by CNBC. Newbie traders panic and create the bottom. Thank you very much because this is a rare opportunity. CS lowers to eps to still $2.6/s. Div is 1.6/y. And ketchup does exist already 150 years so it will not disappear overnight. Strong buy!
grabbed another 100 32.80ish
"Great day for KHC! It is going to be a fantastic turn around story, back to $70 in no time! two more quarter! A great day for Berkshire and Warren Buffett and all long term investors!"
I'll do what I normally do buy a nice amount when it gets to $30 + _ . sell when it gets close to 32 and then repeat
"Earnings will be coming soon look for the press release telling you when , Massive buying will take place once earnings are out. Why because the SEC will be done with and it will be time for KHC to go higher. Same business only better more clean and shinny . Look for higher revenue Why going to take a lot more of KHC products to cover up the taste of fake meat. LOL Plus have you seen the price increases all adds up to higher revenue for KHC"
One month ago believe this company will turn around for good during pandemic. Foods is essential for family to eat stay home more economic than eating outside. This KHC is outperform will do better.
The lack of news is eerily disconcerting.
"I hope all the bad news are out. See some strength on$32, however it is not breaking $33.5. If you are not in, don’t buy at this point."
$35 straight after the bell. Going up today.
The brands aren't going anywhere. I will hold for the long term.
going to take some period of time to get..thru..this. resistance area and..back up into the gap....i will hold long
Hopefully breaking even today. Avg 33.35
"khc bulls have been so underwater for so long i have hope this disaster called khc goes up. awful balance sheet, awful products and zero growth. but folks are buying everything that seems like a ""value"" although these folks haven't looked at khc's financials. but whatever gl."
Will load up if dividend is not cut
"Thinking of selling some AMD that is up today to buy KHC, what is your advice? holding 4.5k shares of AMD and now 1k shares of KHC."
I bought at $34 and this company makes me sick. Buffet ate your lunch feel like a dupe waiting for the bounce that never came!
Kraft Heinz Selling below book value? Unheard of....
Will the increased sales translate to increased profits for KHC? I am expecting the sales numbers to double. What do you all think?
Maybe you took notice today how Goldman Sachs dissed Kraft Heinz Co. and seems to have succededin driving the stock price down. This is an obvious attempt to get a bargain price for their friends atGoldman Sachs. Let's be real who can really trust Goldman Sachs. They have been fined for theirquestionable practices and law breaking in the past. They don't have the ability to be honest.
WB will take KHC private for 40-42 $ per share me think ...
To those with Aug 21'20 $35 Calls - Enjoy! Let's get it!
So how long you think it will stay at this price ?
"Where are all the people screamong great buy at 35, 34, 33, 32?"
Kraft is a defensive stock... Up when everyone is down today! No need to worry with Kraft. I ll still eat Ketchup in 30 years!
Dead Money
"Any pull backs in KHC should now be purchased. KHC is switching from a long term multi year down trend into a new multi year up trend . Not going to be a barn burner at first , but for sure it's now time to start buying the dips."
Buffet will just buy this company and take this private.
Buy when people are fearing and fear when people are buying.
I don't hear anyone mentioning that KHC products include healthy foods as frozen vegetables and frozen fruits. Yes people buy them all the time including me
lol you people! the retail sales have to make up for the restaurant sales. you people know how much the restaurant sales were last quarter? lol gl
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Buying more!!!!
Looking Strong!
"If it just moves sideways, I'm happy. Just don't go down!"
zachs upgrade..late to the game...as usual
Nice to see KHC make the Charles Schwab A-list (strongly outperform). That has convinced me not to sell but to hold. It's a long way back to the $70-80 range. I will try to be patient as long as I can.
"Bought April 40 calls yesterday for .55. 100 contracts. Needless to say, Im very excited for what they could potentially be worth in the coming months "
looks like long bottoming in progress..very nice
"Purchased a position in KHC today. Too low of a price relative to its peers, great dividend. This ranked in the first place because the perception was...people are moving away from processed, packaged food. I think this is over exaggerating and the pandemic environment will bring demand back over the long term."
Buy now or wait for Buffet talk?
institutional buying will kick in look for 1 million buy block for technical support
Shorts are not done. It will take 2-3 days.......
Even though I sold at 32.14 months ago I've still been lurking and watching for an entry point. Any news on when the turnaround plan will be announced?
Can't go wrong investing in a brand name with products found in every home and every restaurant. Pointless you shorty doomsayers claiming otherwise. This is a complete gift.
"When the core business is collapsing, the making-up number can’t fool normal clear-mind ppl. I told you the perfect option pinning action happened last Friday is a tricky action. Luckily, market makers even gave you opportunity to escape above 30 yesterday. If no sales, what to support this Fast processed food business? All basic questions are hanging there. Sometimes, ppl just want to fool themselves. Let’s see how long it can hold."

"Folks Buffet is hanging on to his shares cause he is losing $4 billion but plans to recover. An article just can out stating 10 stocks with generous and safe dividend, KHC was on the list . I strongly believe this is bottom from as high as $96 approx 14 months to $32 and a giant food company. Time to buy and squeeze the shorts out to help us drive KHC higher."
would be a great time.for.a.solid earnings beat to.push this up.into the.gap
When do they report earnings?
Any brave soles out there holding or opening a short position past today's close? If so get ready to pay the dividend to your broker.

"China Tariffs delayed by Trump and Futures high... KHC is going to open around $38 for 4 reasons. The China Tariffs delayed, the Buffet comments, the dividend and the shorts covering !!"
with uncertainty going away .this is a value play now..even with debt..way too much value over debt..25/6 billion in sales
can't believe this is still over 25.
buffet touch over? what's to like here
STOP SELLING!!!!!!!
Insiders buy big for a reason. Listen to last cc. Things expected to improve in the second half. If Buffett says he bought more stock imho could pop 5-7 points. Always a chance imo he may buy the entire company. Now that we have good management in place.

Getting closer to $30 after lunch. it is just a matter of time to get to 40 and beyond.
this stock will stealthily work its way back up to 40+ over the next few months and all the analysts that hated KHC at 25 will then love it at 45; figures!!!!! I expect nothing less from short term thinking analysts. A financial analyst is like an art critic!! Useless!!!!
give me 45 and i leave this board :(
This is starting to perk up so fast that I think others are doing the math and realizing the same thing. Maybe we wake up to a tender offer tomorrow or Monday.

"Folks for what it’s worrh... Spoke with a Morgan Stanley broker in West Palm Beach and he told me they are recommending KHC to their high end Investors. They feel that having Buffet in with 27%, the approx 5% dividend and the fact that the company has good earnings... they feel it’s a safe investment."

I love how a lot of us have done so much research on investing and all the fundamentals and thought we knew a little something then game stop happen and now it’s like what we spent so much time learning ends up hurting us depression kicks in and you realize that if you don’t win with the big guys don’t win with the little guys who do you win with my mood today

"KHC on my list for things to watch now. Not in a rush to buy on the drop today tho, as the description of what bit them tells me that pressure is not going away soon. Increased costs they tied to increasing commodity costs and transportation. I don't think either of those pressures are going away, and generally will be increasing going forward. Their competition should be having the same issues tho. May take a little while for group stabilization. But I'm watching KHC now, as with anything that takes a dive on news but still has some attractive stats in places."
KRAFT IS SHINING TO 40 PLUS DOLLARS
If they bought boar’s head I’d be buying a boat
I’m in at 32. Tempted to take the loss now before year end and buy back after the 30 days period. My concern is someone like buffet may announce a tender offer before year end. I’d jump out the window if that sequence of events happened. Any advice from anyone ?
"My point is the company hasn't received a ""death blow"""
kraft and heinz products are not selling at my grocery store.... i was hoping restuarants amd stuff would fill in but now that i think of it. millenials dont go to restauarants. this may have been a bad investment.
"I bought some more, the uptrend is obvious"
$KHC is BREAKING OUT! Above $35.00 in a few days!
KHC does show good reviews from other known investment companies. I do own a modest amount of shares.
Tillamook cheese 25% cheaper than kraft and MUCH MUCH BETTER. Try it next time and save money!!!Hillshire farms or literally any found roadkill > Oscar Mayer This will be out of super markets sooner or laterAny store brand Ketchup = Heinz They cant patent a recipe or taste.
under $30 somewhere may be reasonable wait until margin calls get resolved
Campbell soup bad report and all retail foods are falling..hnz already cheap..if it continues to fall I will be adding at panic times

Goldman Sachs has had two down grades on stocks I own the first was Apple the analyst was Rod Hall check it out he’s down grade was Appl from 260 to $240 the stock soared to $350 nice call. Now the 2nd call from Mr. English on KHC from $33.00 to $30. And the call is sell Mr. English has a track record of about 43% correct and most of those calls were fair not good. Hey Goldman is Rod still with you because if my work was that bad I would be looking for work. If you want to bring the price down with a sell for your clients than tell them to short the stock. My call on KHC is buy before earnings I believe the company has finally turned or is turning the corner. They still have work to do but it isn’t a sell. I call it a buy because I’m not a professional but neither is Mr. Hall and Mr. English
The market down and KHC going strong... it’s a great defensive play at these low levels.
"Touring Walmart and see KHC products dominate the shelf and just want to confirm its market position. With that dominance, i will add more shares"
Hard to believe the 12 month target on this is 36 with top estimates at 42 bucks a share. I'll take it.
Is this over sold? 3-5% pop Monday?
The market is crazy. Why is this down 5.6%. It should be up 5.6%.
At these levels is still paying a 5% dividend.
"Going up on strong volume... just saw another 100,000 block."
I am curious about how long KHC takes to recover its fair price.any opinions?
"whats with khc lately , have most people stopped eating ?"
"Volume coming in. Bullish indication in MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
buying all day if she depresses to $28; u actually can’t lose if recent trend continues and you’re holding....
Here I'll sound like a long.Way oversold. Everyone eats this! OMG! I saw them in the checkout line at Kroger. They had cream cheese and ketchup!Warren Buffett still holds it.The dividend is so great.They sell soooo much stuff.It can't go any lower!It's just as ridiculous writing it as it is reading it.
Reminds Me of that Popular song that has the phrase.......Low Low Low Low Low Low Low In it......Catchy TUNE.......
Please just get back above 30...I said please
$55 even sooner
Earnings report audits are complete.Earnings will come out anytime.$55 Guarantee!!!!
Reversal starts??
Slowly creeping up.$55 soon!
another beautiful day folks. another beautiful day.
OH....AND THE 6% DIVIDEND IS SAFE....AND QUITE NICE!!! WISE UP !!!!
"From CFRAWe lifted our opinion to a Buy from Hold on 9/16following an encouraging Investor Daypresentation. We now find KHC’s dividend yieldof 5.0% attractive and believe its currentdividend payout is safe as the company will beable to generate significant cash over the nextfew years through an asset sale ($3.2B cheesebusiness sale is pending) and productivitysavings, which will be used to pay down debt,fund the current dividend, and fuel thecompany’s turnaround strategy. We think KHC’snew management team has learned from themistakes made by its predecessors and is nowmore consumer-centric, focused, and united."
these guys sell ketchup right? for a minute there i thought this was a high tech conpany
"amusing the whining in open, free KHC forums. paid, staple newsletter forums not surprised at KHC going forward. next 5 qtrs. already posted have several top rating firms with earnings quarterly numbers. and, numbers are dismal; no sugar coat needed. at moment we have nine staples and three, marginal ""staples"", ctl, kr, wmt ensconced in trust. our view based on newsletter avg's, pretty much envision 28-35 for highs (not lows) this 2020. of course, anything can happen, but less frequently when discussing staples. will say if mid east keeps stirring pot, namely iran, staples may serve safe place. but, nervous types trend to silver and oil during unrest. so, stay tuned, or not. since most of you keep your Gemini cats moored in equatorial waters, we always defer to your judgement posted here in Yahoo forums. pass the meds please."
good report
I hope this goes up I need to ketchup
Better pray this stock stays 30 until next. Paycheck . This is a steal !
me thinks earnings will surprise huge to upside
$37 by the end of April >$40 EOY
this company is a disaster. they have declining sales and a mountain of debt. they can't buy anything because they don't have the money and what little they have they give away to keep ppl interested in their stock or pay down debt. and its going to be the same for YEARS. just a disaster.
@ $26 it would have a 6% dividend and I would strongly consider loading up then.
a little good news and this is flying
"ARE you ready to get slaughtered if not you should have not purchased KHC, Why because what happens is totally out of your control and you should only invest in companies you totally believe in for the long term what happens tomorrow really does not matter as long as the Company is doing all they can for the longer term goals of the company. Invest in companies and people not quarterly earnings."
"They knew about the write-down years ago when they did the merge.Write-down the company, tell everyone it is not the worth buying, then offer 20% premium and the longs will jump at it.I can see it coming, I just know it.Offer $42 since the adjusted earning were $0.84 for the quarter, $8 for the next 4 quarters, and Buffet will take it private.$42 is less than half of the peak. Longs will take it.Some lawsuits, but they will take it.Unless I am wrong and Buffet is selling, then I am way off from reality."
"Kraft Heinz cuts output at three plants, adds shifts for mac & cheese"
SPARTACUS...IS A WISE INVESTOR IF HE GOT IN AT 28. VERY VERY WISE !!!
"LOL why would anyone want to buy KHC now with massive TAX loss selling starting and California trying to get Warren Buffett to buy PG&E, He just might sell KHC to buy PG&E out of bankruptcy. If you say for the dividend there are a lot better stocks to buy than KHC that might or might not cut the dividend again. Lot of risk in buying KHC today at this price. Why not wait until the TAX LOSS selling is over and KHC comes out with their plan in Jan. Here is one stock Bill Gross thinks is the best stock in the whole market and it pays over 7% and they reported great earnings last week and it goes ex-dividend on Nov 8 , if you don't like that of find a different one until TAX loss selling is over in KHC"
"Working at Kraft Foods was an awesome experience. Working there is how I got into investing in stocks. I worked as a Ammonia Refrigeration Tech. There was some blue collar employee's such as Electricians, Mechanics, and Refrigeration techs that had a million in stocks. One guy had almost 1.5million back in 2015, before the market really took off. Another retired at 53 because he was investing since he was 18. my one co worker would constantly tell me to invest in stocks and I took his advice and opened a brokerage account back in 2013. Unfortunately after they were bought by Buffet and 3G they closed down our factory."
They have made a recent purchase of a great new brand.
bought a few shares of khc and i mean a penance of shares at 32.10. still think its trash but wil e ceo might be able to fool the machines again into buying and news from cag influenced my decision. will still trash it but we'll see how it goes.
Sold it all at 42 & change on December 26. Dollar cost averaging into McCormick.
Almost up 100% from all time low; this was kissed this past year. There’s room before eoy to reach $55 imo especially when next 2 ER will be stellar and Americans are looking to buy more cost efficient meals. Miguel Patricio for kamahla’s VP in 2022
"Economy slowing a bit... soon investors will be moving to safer stocks like KHC that pay a good dividend and are less affected because we all have to eat. The big move up is coming soon folks, just have a little patience you will be rewarded with KHC !!"
Just wait to buy KHC is going lower and will retest that $24and change low the only question is will it hold ort not?
In for 100 to have a stake in this roller coaster
"knoph move is red herring and just deck chair move. suspect BRK made the Nina Barton call. keep your eye on ms barton. Div news/guidance pending. (yes, posted to twits)"
"Enterprise value is 65 billion with ebitda of 6,5 billion.. Intrinsic value is around 35. Its currently becoming a buy. I will buy more."
"KHC products are now completely out of kilter with the market. In some cases that are 4 or 5 times the price of similar products. I can no longer see how they can grow the business. Yes some are sticky like Heinz Ketchup and some others, but supermarkets have taken away much of their market and people don't switch back. We have tried several own brand products and the taste is quite often better from the own brand.Batts (own brand Lidl) is 9.4p (in the UK) per 100ml. Heinz is 46.8p per 100ml. That is almost 5 times the price. Lidl has both products side by side and the Batts flies of the shelf whilst most just ignore the Heinz product.Ok this hardly constitutes an extensive market research, but frankly it is just common sense."
The lawsuits will rip this to pieces for a long time. this is dead money.
never would have thought I'd have a capital gain of 68% on KHC? the dividend has also bought tons of shares the past two years.
Just doubled down. See you after earnings
Buy after the dividend is slashed by new CFO
"Just saw that Deutsche Bank raised its estimate for KHC's share price to about $45/share. However, KHC is currently selling at about its book value per share. So, $45/share isn't much of a stretch. I can't believe DB pays its analysts to produce ""yawner"" estimates."
Whats the move here ??? Sell or Hold ?? Bought shares at $28.87. Expert advise only.
Well.. I guess Kraft Heinz is far far far from dead yet! ;-)https://news.kraftheinzcompany.com/press-release/corporate/kraft-heinz-showcase-two-super-bowl-ads-first-time-company-history

"losta long and short banter here. I want to see the dust settle. Biggest issue I saw in the loss wha that they painted it as cost of production and commodity rises. Neither of those issues go away overnight. Competitors should at least have the increased commodity costs hitting them too.

Good. Very good.

Made it to green. Take it one day at a time.
Similar price action daily. It’s really impossible.
$70 stock just one year ago. Assuming current after hours price of $39.65 happens this will represent a 43.3% whacking....that's huge for a so called 'safe' stock. Shocking! And in all probability is going even lower....and with the 'new' dividend that will go lower. HUGE volume tomorrow with a plethora of funds and individuals exiting this loser. Would not be surprised if Ole' Man LIBERAL Warren sells some of stock and eventually exits it altogether. He doesn't stay in things like this.....check out his track record.
Ok what fraud “analyst” or fraud “media” company this time
@Eddi Brand names will win.
Stocks Refuse to Go down stocks want to go up
Only 6800 shares pre-market. This is definitely not an indication of how KHC will open. Flight to yield but not necessarily safety will happen today. ATT might be a good play here.
"All I gotta do is look in my daughter's fridge. she is a millennial and they are supposed to all of a sudden not like old names in favor of the new healthier products from whole foods, Trader Joes, etc. and not shop a walmart anymore or buy any of the old brand names. All I can say is she had 7 KHC products in her fridge. Mayo, ketchup, 2 types of kraft cheese, phil cream cheese, new oscar meyer deli chicken with no nitrites, and 3 or 4 of those just crack an egg containers for her to eat a quick breakfast. Any analyst that thinks KHC is going to run out of money in 2020 is completely out of his/her mind. ""Buy what you know / buy low"". Remind you of a quote from anybody."
If ER was so bad why is stock gradually recovering? Perhaps it really wasn’t as bad as clueless investors assumed. One time expenses don’t mean much long term yet revenue was up. I believe we have seen the bottom and this will be 65 then 80. Give it 6 months
Buffet got this one badly wrong
people better jump a board now all you put purchasers sell before you lose it all
Buffer said private label dominating Kraft. No moat around cheap preservative empty calorie food. Race to the bottom on price. 30b debt
I wonder how many goofs on here chased Warren into not only this but Delta and KR....omg. What a complete disaster this company is...
Bought more shares Averaging in moreLonger terms I feel like this will turnaround
It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood. Hopefully the afternoon will be also!
here we go testing that 32.50 top. waiting to see if it can break it. gl
"Bought KHC at 25.50. But, that's a few months ago."
"The bonds that are secured are the only bet on this company that'll make money. I wouldn't be surprised to find out old Warren has been selling commons and buying secured bonds. When he gets to the level that he's happy with, don't be surprised to hear of a prepackaged bankruptcy. He still wins and gets greater control."

Great American stock here forever !
I’m new to KHC! I like the rest of the market has arrived to prey upon the bargain prices! I’ll be buying 1000 shares tomorrow! Time to make some money!
Gonna have to do a DRIP on this since shares have dropped back down. Will offload in the 40s
"picked up some at 26.50 open order for 26 unfilled, missed it by 5 cents."
Watch and learn. The only reason KHC did not raise the dividend IMHO is b/c a acquisition is coming! and no not soup!
I'm disappointed I thought I could buy under 31.50 today.
whats the news? mdlz moving as well
$55 soon!Guarantee!!Never short a dividend paying stock.
$40 by September
"Hate to bear bad news, but we're dropping to $30 if not $25 imo. Reversal of what was formerly taken for granted is now known and out in the open, and it ain't pretty. Dividend cut, SEC supoena, Buffett bleeding all over the place = sell."

"Madonald selling Oreo fluffy drink, put on the Kraft cheese on burger, Americans love of cheese, Ketchup, and love of Oscar Maye will allow KHC to crank out stable free cash every day. Buy below book value for a great over 100 years old company is incrediblly cheap."
"Hooray, only another $41 share price increase needed until I break-even!"
"CRAMER SEZ.............. SELLLLLLLLLL ! (Quotes Below)TheStreet's Jim Cramer was bearish on the packaged food giant, noting that the company not only missed on the bottom line but that it is also the subject of a Securites and Exchange Commission. Kraft Heinz also had to write down $15 billion and it said it was cutting its dividend by a third to 40 cents per share from 62.5 cents.""There is reverence no more. Instead, there is just intense derision, as seven different firms took it from buy to hold as recognition set in that its style of making acquisitions and then cutting costs has failed to generate any growth at all. Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) have been flat over five years and its stock has declined from $72.96 on its first day of trading as a joint entity, to $38.24, a 45% loss,"" Cramer said."
"Looking at the last weeks announcement of KHC cutting 400 jobs and was just wondering ""how much of a pay cut is coming from the 3G board of KHC that got everyone into this mess?"""
Since Buffet/3g own 75% of KHC. It would only take 10-12 billion to buy the shares they don’t own at $35-40 a share. May be a good time to pick up shares?
Sell your shares. I am buying them and a huge discount!
"mindful, that 30.50 number has some importance going into earnings window februrary 20 with 4 day trade week ahead, don't hope for much. if i were greedy, i would expect 32 easily end of next week. why?: we almost made high of 32 today. we will have a good weekend with bagel bites and velveeta nacho bake at game ready temps. Go Niners."
seems to have find a nice cozy base here around 34.50-34.60
The type of restructuring that KHC needs is best done behind closed doors ---as a private company. As soon as they are up to date on earnings and the dividend is cut (maybe) they will be taken private. I would be surprised if by the end of the year they are still publicly traded.
"Ohhhh girrllll, I'd be in trouble if you let me down...."
cnbccrammer called this very company a beast when it was trading over $90 -- I almost bought it because of that comment but then again it is crammer the clown we 're talking about -- I wonder what he is calling it right now..
"It is time to stock up on shelf stable food. You don't want to be in line with a mask on like what we saw on TV today in Korea. A lot of people eat out, and that will slow down, meaning a lot more demand for cook at home food."
i believe.the new.plan will be.some asset sales and dividend.cut to around.80c yearly..im ok with that..
Amusing motley fool bashed this all last year when it was cheap..now they talk about how great it is and safe
"BOYS.....BUFFETT IS LOOKIN BIG TIME AT KRAFT AND BOEING. HE MAY BUY THEM BOTH, AND HE CAN JUST WRITE A CHECK. NO FINANCING NEEDED. I EXPECT AN ANNOUNCEMENT BEFORE APRIL 1 !!!!"
With a new all time low of 53.57 the PE ratio is still 14.8. I think it's all but inevitable it goes under 50 at this point. Way to much for the stalled earnings that khc has. A much more reasonable 13pe puts us down to 47 and a full 14 is just over 50. A really good earnings could reverse the down trend but I just don't see how that happens this qtr. Glad I got cold feet and got out last week with a small profit. With numbers like these something has to give and the share price is much easier to change than khc`s revenues.
"Chop chop time: ""Kraft Heinz expects to cut 400 workers as part of restructuring""What an excellent idea! From now on, ketchup will make itself."
I will never by Kraft products anymore. Kraft products are 90% chemical and fake.
So why General Mills bringing back the old flavor cookies back??? Ppl miss/love/desire the old taste/memory/happiness!!!
"back to 40's when panic subsides , maybe ?"
PLEASE Properly Welcome Me To the KHC Bagholder Club3125 @ 32.90 This AM. Already Way Down.Man I can only imagine the people in this group getting hammered.
"I just bought today, not holding a bag like some of you. ...not yet anyway lol."
I have question. Kraft write down Oscar Mayer brand. But what happens if sales of this brand (oscar mayer) somehow will increase after write down? is it can influence price of shares or it doesnot matter?
"kraft is almost stable now , the smallest bit of news things are improving and we start to move towards 27..50 ."
i’m sure management will kraft an excuse for getting this company into a pickle
STOCK FUTURES SOARING ! KHC Must Be Way Up......OOPS.......I Just Saw It's WAY DOWN in Pre Market !OMG
"Just bought. Great company, low price, excellent dividend. This has to be on Buffets radar to buy at this level and the amount of shares he already owns. He had too much money and had to deploy it. He wouldn't have made the deal originally if he didn't like the business and management."
Watch next qtr they take another write down... Watch next qtr sales decline again... Excluding the write down they might manage to keep bottom line in tact with some cost deferring
For Kraft...its about the next quarter. Confinement combined with eating from home and no restaurant will last the full quarter...with a massive surge in grocery business...Kraft will get huge benefits. Stay at home was only 2 weeks of Q1 ...so not much effect. hearing up 3 percent vs down 3 percent...was all driven in only one month.....imagine 3 months! Long and Strong for the future.
Guess it’s time for some Mac and cheese with ketchup.
The 40 cent dividend is good for a 24 dollar stock.
"Don't care if this goes up, just stay flat and stop falling for a few days!"
"Moody's just lowered their outlook in Kraft, thanks for the help on that! lol"
"WB said on CNBC that he ""overpaid"" for KHC but I'm sure that he may be buying more on the dip. Let's see form 13 on next quarter..."
Great news: The stock bounced a little.Must be because of the next 40% dividend cut next month.
MAKING KETCHUP REQUIRES SPECIALIZED SCIENTIST. IT IS A VERY PROPRIETARY BUSINESS...... NOBODY CAN MAKE KETCHUP BUT THIS COMPANY..... NEXT DIVIDEND CUT COMING SOON....
still a good stock. Who knows how much is the brand? Focus on dividend rate.
"I will be up early Monday with a nice cup of coffee ️ at 6:00am and if Buffet says anything positive, I will loading up with another 5,000 shares. Will hold to $45. Buffet’s average is around $54 - $58. This is a no brainer for a fast pop."
Another Day....Another 52 Week low........Just Taking Longer and Longer to.....'KETCHUP'LOL
"The question you have to ask yourself now is do you wait till Aug 20th (holders record date) to get the div on Sept 13th, or will the share price be lower by 8/20 to wipe out your dividend? # of shares I have x $0.40/share dividend tells me the risk of the price dropping more than the dividend received is a big risk. I'm outta here."
"Buffett's talk will drive this up, quite a bit on Monday...Hold it and watch the momentum take it Monday morning."
Very bullish it has such a high yield
They blamed Cosby!!!
"WITH THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT FRIDAY.....THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE REASON KHC HAS GONE UP, AND THATS BUFFETT. WISE UP !!!!!"
Insider buying gives me much comfort here with KHC.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO JUST OUGHT 30 mORE SHARES!!!!!
Is it too late to buy this for the 6% divy today?
Adding listen to Aug 8 update and like what I heard. BTW The dividend will be maintained. 5.4% while we wait.
Going back up. Needs to sthick
"Every time I decide to look at the comments section for KHC I see the same junk from ....drum roll please ----""Legendary Trader"" - once again indicating we will be below $30 VERY SOON! He provided us his great prognostication of KHC being below $30 by this Friday - anybody want a side bet Once again also posting junk that the credit rating was downgraded (pas tense) when in fact it is only being evaluated for downgrade because they have not filed the 10K not for any other reason. Do you people actually think anybody pays attention to your up or down comment dribble? That's rhetorical please."
This is a pure value stock but i think under the present circumstances the div should be cut strongly. Bringing down the debt At a fast rythm would calm down the rating agencies and introducing new products would guarantee the future. Not forgetting that from a shareholder perspective reimbursing the debt or paying dividends have almost the same effect on value
This stock was $97 at one time. I don't expect this will ever get back to 1/2 of this amount.
"Warren Buffett has sold his shares at the end of January, sad for little guys like us, still long"
up 20% tomorrow big earning day
How much per share Buffett is averaging here?
time for 40s?
"I'm a KHC shareholder, full disclosure. My question is: Why is Wall Street so concerned about debt when it's covered by a 5:1 profit/debt interest ratio? I understand, that in the long term, debt can add price to a product (debt transferred to consumer price) which can eat away at marketshare... but KHC profit has a huge coverage on debt interest. On top of that, the last 3 years it's bit hitting about 3B in after tax cash... that's a lot of cash for a 33B market cap company."
"I ve been invested in khc for 1.5 year, with lots of ups and downs. Bought a big chunk in the low 20’s that make me break even at around 31 (taking the divy into account). Hope to see it pop with the ER in order to finally sell for a nice profit. Based on fundamentals and the brand portfolio it is not worth more than 40 imho."
$31 today. $55 soon!Guarantee!
"For 1Q and 2Q, beat on EPS but slight miss on revenues. New CEO needs more time - he has been on the job for over one month."
Don't plan on selling this for many many years to come. Lock me into a good dividend please!
Good investment right here...not much down side risk. Buy Buy Buy.
Seems way overdone. Staples safety area. But it’s a hedge fund name. Staples is where you want to be here
looking to add a food based company to my ira for long hold. khc or bgs are both near all time lows but have very good brands and pay solid div. can someone tell me why they have been dropping so bad? And would now be a good time to get in for a long haul? I currently have energy and tech holdings just trying to stay diversified and still a noob. thanks for any info
add on weakness and wait..this will have positive outcome..too many ways to fix this..buy more on dividend cut
With increase Covid cases more people will continue to stock food at home.They will reach $36-$38 by year end earnings.

Nice close!
"Lagging the Broader market today. Not surprising. Irrational panic buying is over. Took a walk through the local Wal-Mart this morning. The center aisles were slam full again for the most part. People seemed to be more interested in the fresh meats and dairy products. Things still lagging seemed to be paper products (nearly empty) and cleaners/sanitizers (about half empty). KHC has no stake in either of those areas.KHC can attempt to ride this Corona horse, but it ultimately isn't going to get it to the finish line."
This stock has a ball and chain attached to it's foot.. CAMMAN.. MOVEE!!
"Buffett in today’s letter to shareholders: “Our advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying that in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie (Munger—vice chairman of Berkshire) and I expect them to deliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing."""

I like ketchup. Kids love Mac n cheese.
Well they are saying tomorrow and well they have to as its the last day to report without more SEC interaction.

"After 3 years of none growth, maybe waning revenue? But keep the shareholders happy with divs and buybacks, then a return to growth? And I'll never sell. I'll be like Buffet and Coke, eating Mac and cheese at 82 like Buff drinks coke now lol"
"Taking a Long Time for this stock to ""KETCHUP'HEE HEE HEE"
"@R. Book value doesn't mean anything. Only real value is the ""market cap""(number of shares times price). Yea if KHC went bankrupt it is worth zero. There is never any actual value to ""goodwill"", except in tax calculations. A value in a company is the earnings, which at 5 billion a year, and a PE of say 16 is 80 billion, much more than current market cap of KHC."
chris is time for your afternoon nap
CPB is up on news about being bought by KHC and this is down.
Close above $35.59 with volume takes out previous high and sets up close of the gap to mid 40s
"I'm not an expert, but here are my thoughts on KraftHeinz: Current market cap is 35B, and with roughly 4B in post tax earnings (last 2 years) I think it's in good territory for investment. The question is: will this trend of migration to healthy alternatives continue, and if so, will KHC continue to earn what it's earning over the next 10 years? My 2nd thought is this company has a lot of debt, but it's coverage ratio appears to be 5.5/1 - roughly 6B in profit per 1B in interest expense. That doesn't scare me too much. Lastly, one of the negatives is it appears to have a ton of intangible net worth, and as we've seen, this is not dependable or accurate. However, I still believe KHC has a lot of very strong brands with sellable value. All in all, I believe this to be a good business that I have no problem holding for the next 10 years."
A 30% drop in a day would make sense if their ketchup killed or sickened people or was tainted with bacteria and millions of bottles had to be recalled. I don't know much abt their sec subpoena but it cannot be as messy as the wells Fargo fake accounts or the BP oil spill pi r PCG northern CA fires

"At this point I assume this stock is a lost cause. Invested at 72, will probably need to wait another few years to see if *maybe* this stock can climb out of the deep deep hole it has got itself in. Management has brought this company to a dead end. They missed the boat of the healthy eating and organic movement. Hopefully they can re-invent themselves from within or through aquisition but that would require a management overhaul. Good luck to everybody."
I am looking where it's written that Warren bought more shares... Any link would be very appreciated please.

I rarely sell long term holdings but I see lots of challenges here for KHC. There are other better choices I believe and you always have to consider what you have today and where will it do the best as far as an investment. I never allow myself to"" rear view mirror"" invest. I consider what I have today and if fundementals change or management mis manages Im out. Good luck to those holding on. It could be some time to come back...I moves on with this one..."
"don't get caught trying to buy a dip-there is no dip-,buy back at 28to29, keep your profits , it had its run."
All the automatic sell orders are almost done. Here’s come the squeeze
.60 cut in dividend would save the company 728M/year and leave the dividend rate a 3.27%. Would you all take the cut if money promised to pay down debt?
ads and more ads thats all they have ppl. ill enjoy their entertainment but when i go to walmart ill pass right by their goods and buy the similar great value brand at 1/2 price or better.
With Nelson Peltz becoming strategic advisor to cannibus company ACB I fully expect KHC to get into the infused food business. It will definitely boost the companie’s share price and business.
Mac and cheese.
"The negativity in the media about KHC is excessive. This is a healthy phase of cleaning house and re-inventing itself. KHC is a global food giant with access and infrastructure. I find the stock cheap, 5% dividend attractive, debt is shrinking, income will stabilize... Potential for growth!"
$54 right around the corner 
Seneca has tanked right along with KHC and has a PE of 1/2 of Kraft's but they do not pay a dividend. You get nothing while you wait. KHC cut their dividend to 40 cents but hope they don't suspend it like Ford and numerous others. Banks may be next to cut.
The lower it goes the better chance Buffet takes it private.

they cut the divi ....sec .... falling earnings and revenue ... they need to fire the CEO and a bunch of other high level execs ... Warren Buffett will probably ramp up the pressure
Why this one so down...?Is it good price for someone for fresh entry ?
"20 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Kraft Heinz in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $34.21, suggesting that the stock has a possible upside of 9.29%. The high price target for KHC is $60.00 and the low price target for KHC is $25.00. There are currently 4 sell ratings, 15 hold ratings and 1 buy rating for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of ""Hold"
"The worst has yet to come. Do not catch a falling knife. Now is the time to sell to protect your investment and wait until the sky improves. KHC needs to take decisive actions: time to prepare by cutting the dividend, layoff workers, and reduce debts. It will take time for KHC to turn around or may be longer beyond your control. Just do it before too late.I do not like all the late hypes and Hedge Funds involvement."

Don’t know if I even trust buying into. It has been on the downside for over 5 years now. Consumers have too many other choices that are available to them.

I love the Wall Street full out CON jobs and no one ever goes to jail. Analysts down grade knowing and tellyou to sell all the time knowing their Wall Street firm or the other firms they are working with are buying. Make is an out right CON job for financial gain. Even better is the whisper number CON. Company says they will make 61-68 cents but the whisper number is 71 cents WOW the company missed by 3 cents. LOL not really they made the up end range they gave of 68 cents. What a great CON job that one is for Wall Street. You want them to beat the whisper number is 61 cents the company reports 63 cent WOW they beat by 2 cents but is was at the low in of the companies range . Best Wall Street CON there is the whisper number.
Healthy eating a fad. Future is all about heavily processed foods. Strong buy.
Accumulation is done. Financial audits are done and signed off. It is up to Kraft to release them at any moment.They have until 9/11 to do release it.$55 or above soon!
Wonder how many people bought this just because Warren bought it. haha.

Berkshire Hathaway may be secretly adding shares...
"Lets see, Wall Streets AI computers have pushed KHC down more than they should have. KHC has put all the bad news in one Q and all the bad news is now out. KHC cut the dividend and the stock has dropped to the point it's now paying you twice the 10 year. NO BRAINER must start buying shares . Why they still make lots of money and they are paying you twice the 10 year. Watch and learn. KHC will be going higher from here over time and you will get paid 5% on your investment as KHC grinds back higher"
I take back my last comment now. Dividend slashed to 0.40. Sketchy.$30 share price puts it back at 5%.
Can someone please tell me the ex date for KHC?
Devour Foods a KHC brand of frozen dinners is being featured in the Deadpool 2 movie which is set to open this week.Should turbo charge their sales to record levels and beyond to a whole 'nutha level.Especially if the dinners are good.

WOW with all the KHC bashing for sure you would have never believed that revenue for Q4 2018 was up .07% . So where is the big fall off in sales if the revenue was up for Q4 2018. Boy you got bash and buy by Cramer LOL Cramer was bashing so MS was buying LOL
"Jumped in today with a small stake, only 200 shares. I've been watching for awhile, but wanted another pullback to where I could get a 6% yield on the current div. In at $26.60, pretty happy and believe the long term prospects are good, providing one can stomach the short term frustrations."

How you guys liking that dividend now? You are only down 2 and a half years worth of them since they announced they were not cutting it. Ohh and you also got cut to junk credit rating by keeping it. An 8 year old running a lemonade knows they cant pay their friends before paying for the lemons and cups and signs.
Chart looks like it’s going to $60’s next 12-18 months
let's mute urmoney and have intelligent discussion board.
"Hello longs! I’d like to discuss something more meaningful than bashing Buffet and consumer goods, like most posts on here.First, I am long here as well, with an average price of $55, yes back in October or so, I thought I was getting a deal considering this had traded at 80-90 less than a year prior and all the news was that it was tunrmjng itself around. With such a huge brand name, a Buffet stock, a 4.5% yield at the time, and the fact that a quarter of the grocery store space is KHC products, I thought I was ‘safe’ in the turbulent correction at the end of 2018. I read a ton of negative posts, nothing positive really, even comparisons to GE, which are still bogus. However a possible scenario keeps coming back to mind. This is already half owned by Berkshire and 3G, has anyone considered a takeover for the other half? If so, figuring out a premium or right price would murder any longs on here, since I am most certain many have bought at even higher prices than I have. I understand 2019 will be a 0 growth year here, somehwat complemented by a lowered dividend with the only positive being deleveraging. The thought of a buyout at these prices tho, terrifies me, as it would be substantially under purchase price. Thoughts? Let’s keep bashing off."
even More call volume today. is something up? breakout to where? all institution and server trade.
"Investing in stocks is a long term endeavor. Looking for an uptic after a couple of months is gambling, not investing. A lot of gamblers in this market. KHC is a long term hold. Soros sold to focus on Lyft which is costing him billions !!!"
HAS DIVIDEND BEEN PAID ?
"Comparing GE and KHC... khc got much more safer business compare with ge..in addition, ...ge was in downtrend for last 2 years, from dec 2016 (around) and bottomed in december... kraft was ATH in feb 2017. now we are feb 2019. so basically the same, before drop on friday, khc paid around 5.2% yield, with that drop, and dicrease in dividends, khc also paid around 5.2% yield.Smart money buying, panic boys selling.and yeah, of WB will try to sell his shares, he will try to push this stock higher, like with some rumors etc... or atleast they can manipulate last er with stock gaining atleast 10%...WB sells hight, he dont sell low."
"Big move higher on Monday for KHC, Why dividend reinvestment your running out of time to get your KHC shares so cheap, There could be as much as 15-16 millions shares purchased on Monday just from the dividend reinvestment. How Easy do the math 1.22 billion shares times .40 cents + about 488 million dollars plus about 25 million shares that were shorted times .40 cents = 9.8 million so 496 million dollars can buy 15.5 million shares at todays price the power of dividend reinvestment WOW a 15.5 million share buyer on Monday. The power of compounding you money making money"
"Good news. The Board of Directors of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock payable on June 14, 2019, to stockholders of record as of May 31, 2019."
Another new 52w high today..KHC itching for 40..plus great div
$KHC Good stock for a covered call strategy.
They make $6 billion. 1.2 billion shares. $5 per share earnings. $1.60 dividend. What is the the p/e? low What else do you want? Usually Buffet gets a great deal at the expense of others. This time is your chance to get the deal.But not from Buffet. From others. Buffet says he is not selling nor is he buying. We are all just collecting the dividends and hoping for the stock to rise so that we feel better about our investment.
"Oct. 31, the day of reckoning. Beat, meet, or miss?"
GE is rebounding strongly and paint the same picture for KHC. they were oversold for a transient event.
"Eventually the market will establish the right price for KHC shares , before WB takes it private ."
down 25k in this... dont know what to do... wait or take a lose..
"Time to buy. I've been saying to buy at $48 for over 6 months. Well, this is close enough for me. I own a small amt. of KHC right now but will add a bunch more on Monday and will average down IF it goes down more. This is the time to get into KHC. The Dividend is great and it appears to be safe. Their sales are awesome and I believe their revenue will go up due to new products I'm expecting them to bring to market. I also believe they will find a way to decrease their huge debt. They may look at adding more rev. by acquiring a smaller co. Who knows? The divi. alone is worth buying this at this level. KHC at $48, or a little higher is worth an investment."
"All they gotta do is get the debt under control, then it’s off to the races, and raising dividend "
Zacks upgrades KHC from Sell to Hold dated 1/30. don't discount this move thinking you know better.
Surge because of unsubstantiated rumor saying buffet is preparing to tender an offer with 3g for the rest of the KHC shares he doesn’t own for $36.50. DO NOT fall for this. No chance it is true. Why would he. He can buy for $29 on the open market.
"BOYS...MANY OF YOU MAKE GREAT POINTS. KHC BUSINESS WILL HAVE JUMPED DUE TO THE VIRUS. NEXT EARNINGS CALL WILL BE SWEET. BUT I EXPECT SHORTLY FOR BUFFETT TO MAKE A MOVE. THE MAN IS SITTING ON 128 BILLION IN CASH. HE MOST LIKELY IS SITTING PRETTIER THAN ANYONE ELSE. BUFFETT LOVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. HE WILL STEP IN AND BUY SOMETHING SOON. I BELIEVE DUE TO HIS 26% OWNERSHIP IN KHC ITS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT HE TAKES KHC PRIVATE. WITH A PURCHASE HE IMMEDIATELY REDUCES THEIR COST OF DOING BUSINESS, PLUS UNDER PRIVATE OWNERSHIP A BUSINESS CAN MOVE MUCH FASTER AND EFFICIENTLY....AND THATS WHAT BUFFETT LIKES THE MOST. LOOK...BUFFETT IS GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOMETHING SOON AND KHC MAY BE AS GOOD AS ANY. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EAT NO MATTER WHAT THE ECONOMY OR VIRUS DOES !!!!!"
Hehe I was right about the 2 quarters released together. Excellent news
i punched all the data into my XE200 stock analyzer.. and it shows KHC closing at 65 by years end.

"sell at 33.32 -- take the profits to the bank this afternoon ,, yeah Baby !!"
Look at those profit margins of the past...! This is insanely good. I think this can be a gigantic turnaround!
"Great news, the former successful CFO returns to the company and replace the poorly performed 3G capital young chap. Experience does count"
Heinzi really looking strong here...
It’s simple the answer is buy !
Starting to get really concerned about what they found in the 1Q earnings. Called the company to see when earnings will be released. They said they have no idea. Did they discover something really bad?? Shouldn’t they let shareholders know what is going on. Good or bad!
"Relax, they report at 5:00 ET."
People have to eat. Long and strong KHC
"If debt were a relevant thing, the USA would be bankrupt. But its not relevant."
Why no dividend increase? August is traditionally the time and results are good.
Hurry Buy so when 3G dumps 25 million more shares it won't tank it back to $26. 3G soled the last batch at $28.44 so we are almost to the point they think it's over priced

For the length of virus they should do well. I never saw so much Mac and Cheese stands in supermarkets They can’t keep up with demand.

Hello Khc you had some decent earnings... Wake up and rise from the bed finally.
"Billion dollar losses, div cut, sec investigation, lawsuits, man this is some dog."
Anyone see Market Mornings youtube post on this? Breakout Potential?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOCJBlqT9lo&t=4s
Buy at the dips and be rewarded....easy peasy
BUFFETT CAN JUST RIGHT A CHECK. HE NEEDS NO FINANCING......WHICH PUTS HIM RIGHT IN THE CAT BIRDS SEAT !!!!
Who in their right mind would buy this stock just from an SEC standpoint??
"you ppl can trade and play little games with the options but the debt, management and competition are taking this lower. did i mention that KHC has MORE debt than SEVERAL food companies COMBINED!!!"
I'm in. Yesterday was an exaggeration.
When you add the 31B of debt to the 31B of market cap I don't see any value for this company.
Can someone please tell Buffett to sell his stake in Kraft Heinz so the stock will go up
how do analysts with strong buy ratings for khc and other clown stocks always continue to have jobs? If I was THIS wrong THIS often at my job I would not be employed. Isn’t that how capitalism is supposed to work?
Interesting Buffet wants to deploy cash and buy a big business .... could he be thinking of KHC since is dropped 30% and they already own a third anyway ? What do you think ?
Is it OK to put Ketchup on an American Cheese Sandwich?
Why are we up?
Nice finish!
Moving up nicely on this last day of winter.Let's celebrate arrival of spring and blossom.
"Buffet and 3G are giddy that the market gave them the opportunity to take KHC private. Max they will need to tender is $40 and everyone will be thrilled. The market saved their investment. And believe me, they know it is worth $60 once they clean it up a go public again"
Precursor - KHC is going to skyrocket  next week 
kHC should buy Blue Apron to enter into organic and fresh segment.
I trust and believe in Warren Buffett because he became a multi billionaire by looking out for the best interests of the small investor. I also have some waterfront property (really!) in South Florida near Naples that I'm wanting to sell on the cheap.
Analysts at J.P. Morgan see the U.S. food production space as a good place for investors to place money amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm out. no sign of recovery after it broke below $25.50
c'mon $30
"I may sell at $35.My basis is $25, and this stock should have benefited more from the pandemic considering it had three earnings calls since March with people hoarding food.Meanwhile other stocks have doubled, tripled, etc.I’d like to keep it, but $28 looks more likely than $40 at this point..."

KHC is not one of the stocks that I follow but at a glance appears to be a good value. Considering buying on Monday or Tuesday. Not sure if it has more room to drop before it starts going back up.
"This is even worse by keeping the dividend in order to persuade Buffett not leave. That divd factor is the only one reason for Buffett now. But Buffett is KHC’s biggest tool to fool ppl. If no sales, how long and what to support this situation? KHC will dive in even deeper from now on. When the public gets to know the info that Buffett already escaped, it’s been at least 1 month delayed. Before that point, you’ll see KHC keep declining. After the formal announcement, you’ll see a collapse."
so how many shares sold after hours?
“Equity Bond” stock.....great dividend and revenue and profit will continue to benefit through next 2 quarters from continued stay at home and more millennials cooking......then management will start buying back shares in addition to paying down debt.
"Shorts are scared and desperate, they are going to be punished soon"
Don't be scared. $6 to $7 in earnings as per Buffet is not bad. Debt will be paid off. Insiders that wanted big bonuses for their crooked deeds have been caught. Less crookedness will mean better earnings. Don't be afraid.
"Director just purchase for $250,000 of Shares. This is good news to me when Insiders purchase KHC stock!"
So glad to be done with this one. Cost me 20% but my remaining capital is better invested somewhere else. Good luck all. Chances are good now that I am out that it will soar.
"Folks as analysts start up grading due to the low valuation and dividend, the stock (KHC) will move higher."
"Is someone leaking bad news to Zacks?"" On October 22, 2019 Zacks Investment Research, Inc. downgraded KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY ( KHC) from HOLD to SELL."
Another SURGE!!! The growth bubble is finally popping and value is back!
Can it get to $60. today ?
straddle expected movement for khc after ER is interesting.
"while we are indifferent to recent rating releases, it was done in a flurry. ""trading central"" is widely recognized, and often cited in our paid forums and staple newsletter. 1/22, weds, tc downgraded to ""sell."" not good following up with today's, 1/23 ""jefferies"" downgrade. these downgrades are not resonating with the institutionals. and, of course, we are still acquiring khc when price suggests. selling out of our bgs and cpb 2018 and 2019 gave us room to run. fwiw, months ago we parked some wmt and pg. we won't disburse any timely info here, sorry. it's pay to play."
What time are they suppose to report?
"I’m going to wait until the tide rolls out another 20 percent, then I’m in long-term"
"Posted by ABMN Staff on Feb 15th, 2020 // No CommentsKraft Heinz logoKraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) has been given an average recommendation of “Hold” by the twenty-five brokerages that are currently covering the company, Marketbeat.com reports.

I hope KHC is working overtime on a veggie burger to compete with Beyond Meat.
You bagholders have ABSOLUTELY lost your minds!!!There is no way I’m paying $8 for Miracle Whip or $3 for Heinz ketchup when there’s a product that tastes good and has good quality and the same nutritional value at better than half the price of KHC products. I’ve said before and again I will say it again: “KHC is a short until they become competitive in the marketplace and cut that dividend to improve that balance sheet”.There's a reason why buffet doesn’t pay a dividend on BRK shares.
If it drops more people will buy.
"how's the trust fund web?? you ok? im going to walmart later to pick up some great value products $1 honey mustard, $2 big jar of mayo and $1 bottle of ketchup. if i bought khc it would cost double."
Yep things have changed interest rates have dropped greatly from 3% on the 10 year to now under 2%. plus KHC raised prices in Jan and it looks like they stuck.. I don't think I would be selling any KHC stock at this level . both things are greatly going the help KHC
"KRAFT DOWNGRADED TO ""JUNK"" STATUS:On Thursday, the maker of Heinz ketchup and Kraft macaroni and cheese revealed a 5% drop in fourth-quarter net sales and a 14% slump in adjusted earnings per share. CEO Miguel Patricio said the performance was ""disappointing"" in a press release.On Friday, Fitch cut Kraft Heinz's credit rating to BBB- from BB+, downgrading its bonds to non-investment grade or ""junk,"" Bloomberg reported. The credit-rating agency cited the company's large debt pile, dwindling profits, and negative outlook."
Upgraded with $39 PT. Life is good!
"Anybody think we get shares a little cheaper in the next 2 days before dividend? Not greedy, but love a deal."
I just bought some I believe!!!
Enron all over again
I added more shares yesterday to reduce cost basis. I think it is a stable long term hold. They'll get their issues worked out. Berkshire Hathaway has to save face. Collect your dividend and watch it slowly climb back.
Great buy
Warren Buffett needs to announce buying more shares here
"""BUY WHEN OTHERS ARE FEARFUL"" Warren Buffett"
right near three month and six month high..excellent
I WAS ON BOTH THE M AND HD BOARD WHEN I READ HOW RDUNCE PANICED AND SOLD M IN THE 15 AREA!! HE IS JUST AN OLD TRADER!!!! IN DEFENSE OF KHC THEY MADE A GOOD NEW CEO HIRE AND THE RECENT CAMPBELL HIRE ALSO WAS VERY GOOD!! I EXPECT KHC TO GO PAST 40 IN 12 MONTHS.
"i dont know what to make of Gareth Soloway..... investing d0t c0m says:Shares of Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) have been in a spiral lower since 2017. The stock topped out near $100 in January 2017 and has fallen almost non-stop. While the chart is nasty, there are signs of life as traders start to accumulate. First, KHC now pays a 5% dividend yield. With the 10-year yield trading below 2.50%, this makes for an attractive place to park money. Next, Buffet owns a large stake and he rarely loses.Technically OversoldAnother big factor is the oversold metrics. Almost every technical signal shows an oversold condition with positive divergences starting to appear. This speaks of a coming up move for the stock. Finally, investor sentiment is as bearish as ever on Kraft Heinz. When investors expect the absolute worst, it does not take much for the company to showcase some light at the end of the tunnel and see a short-covering pop in the stock. With earnings due, signals point to an up-move ahead. Calculations show a possible upside target of $41 from its current $32 price."
The lawsuit and penalty factor hasn’t been priced in yet. The timing of news releasing is really tricky. It was released at 8:01pm right after AH. KHC investors are locked up!
UrMoney sounds desperate. Poor guy.
"Just took a peek at KHC and i just have to say they are not letting there stock holders down at all, what a POS stock!"
Duke and Duke is putting all of their clients into KHC based on the recommendation of Mr Valentine - they see current price as excellent buy in point.

"The funny thing is... all this company has to do is survive and we all get a 50% gain in the short term Lol. I'm betting that Kraft can do that, survive. Thank you."
i get the dividend.... i may almost break even...... if you dont count tying up my money for monthslooking for the exit door.... june 3lesson learned... a good dividend doesn't make a good stock
live it..buy more tomorrow
Oct. 29th will tell the whole KHC story.
Been hearing the pumpers $40 by years end. You keep pumping you have fewer than 30 trading days. A dog with fleas might be lovable but it's still a dog with fleas. This is the GE of the food industry. Heading nowhere really slowly.
POS
holding for years..wake me up when the drama is over
these write offs are timed to maximize run down...weak hands will be all out and buffet and company will fill the void at lowest cheapest price..obvious what is occurring..tune back in in three years when the story is complete..Heinz will be spun off by itself again and Kraft will be sold I believe
this stock would need to go up 35 pts to get to the point where it is even CLOSE to where it was a year ago. that wont happen when they cant even get their earnings reports out on time.
sold 25 million shares guess that rules out buyout
Consumer staple trading at lows something is wrong
my instinct told me to buy low friday. my experience said nope. not done going down.
Robinhood and masdaq says earnings was june 19 what is going on?
Love Warren Buffett but he didn't do his homework on this one.
Wow! Solid earnings reportTrading for 11x earnings with a 5% yield.Take that any day!Good luck longs
AH last night's low print was due to only a few shares.Nothing to see here....move on.....khc to infinity.
Can anyone please upgrade KHC? Thanks!!! 
"Chart looks like a downward staircase. Please give me 3 good reasons why it should be going up. Please use FACTS and LOGIC, not emotion or apocryphical stuff ( CEO bought more, Warren Buffett owns it). It seems to be declining in every metric, I'm simply asking for pure LOGIC."
I sold my measly 43 shares earlier. Figured this was a good one to take a tax loss on  It could pop good in the next few days. Who knows but I do think this SEC investigation will continue to put pressure on this...
"I really think it's better to cut the dividends for a while and reduce the debts in order to turn the ship around. As in investor im ok with that.. Look at GE for example. they cut the dividends and the new maangement Larry Culp was able to turn the ship around.. in 2018, 52 week low was at 6.66$ now it's at 13 $ ..I know it's a different industry but ....."
"New to KHC! Holding 1,000 shares at $35.31"
I wonder how the dudes who paid 91 bucks in May 2017 feel.I can only hope that the windows in their offices don't open.
What’s ur fav ketchup mine is heintz it’s the only one worth buying do u think this company is in trouble if they sponsor the Steelers stadium I don’t think so we have a real winner here been holding my shares for a long time and we’re not going anywhere

"Stock in free-fall. No confidence, no catalysts for growth, work force is demoralized. CEO and BOD are out of touch. A recipe for disaster. I find it hard to believe Buffet would do another deal with 3G given this debacle. May 2nd earnings = more pain, more pressure."
baboom
The day KHC files.10k ... up $2the day settles with SEc .... up $3ER day with beat... up $4the day raise div to $.10 quarterly.. .. up $3the day KHC fires CEO...... up $3KHC will be at $46 in 6 months if all plays out... Dream now... wake up at $46
"I Bought at $35 and am still holding. Why? Unfortunately, I don't have a defensible response, and it is largely...hope that it will bounce back so that I can garner a bit of profit. Options action I saw tonight has ramped up and I am taking from this more encouragement that KHC will bounce..some. I was very disappointed in Warren Buffett's rhetoric regarding Kraft. i.e. ""I paid too much."" #$%$?? Where is some diplomacy baby? Like ""I bought shares in this company because I strongly believe in the product and management and that has not changed..."" something like that. Instead of ""Yep, I paid too much."" Crazy guy...Wonder if it is age that's talkin...:("
"Recently saw a headline ""Denver 'iOS' for cannabis dispensaries funded by Kraft Heinz"". There are virtually no synergies between this business and Kraft's business - different sales and distribution channels, different manufacturing, quality, and regulatory concerns. Perhaps if KHC focused on their core business better results would be delivered."
Please tell me what they see in a dying horse company like Campbell Soup ?
Massive reform to bring about appreciation
If Buffet owns stock like this.. I thought the fundamentals are to buy again if they go low? Has Buffet bought more to bring down the cost basis?
KHC Used To Be Great !Now Jaffray Cuts to.....UNDERWEIGHT !Which Means.........S E L L PM Down to 32.50 !
Perhaps Kraft could get the stock price to improve by concentrating on the products they sell and less on promoting a social agenda promoting interracial relationships in their commercials....it's called keeping your eye on the prize
probably see usual suspect rags..barons..wsj..Cramer..motley..all throw some negative spin before the er
nice volume!
Warren Buffet is gonna come down on the CEO of KHC like Julius Caeser!!
"NEXT QUARTER EARNINGS CALL WILL BE A BLOWOUT NUMBER !!!! BUT, BUFFETT WILL OWN IT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS !!!!"
"KHC has only one problem - too much debt. That's it. They can sell assets, or they can lower the cost of that debt by refinancing it....but not in the US. They should sell bonds in Europe or in Japan, at much lower (possibly near zero) interest rates, and maybe even denominated in weakening currencies. Then the company will have enough free cash flow to reduce its leverage fairly quickly."
"For all you 10 year plus trades, this low volume and bottom is a sign of something brewing while the big boys quietly accumulate. Soon there will be a big pop up with some type of good news. Be patience and you will be rewarded !!"
"Good, they didn't cut the dividend!!!! Very good sign for me!"
Need to add a packet of bacon bits to the Mac and cheese line! I should be running this company!
"lot's of gibberish being posted this week: ignore. we only write for investors, not traders of cons staples, reits, mlps, utilities and the like. alert: writers now gathering to theorize next earnings call. this even before the 10Q for this quarter. some writers are strictly cautioning another KHC downturn owed to earnings pressure again. mindful, we are a quarter away from next er. this is entirely wrong in our opin. summing up: start monthly buying dip KHC. if you're trying to build family trusts, start with this. also, some reits, are pulling back a bit. one tobacco company was ptiched on pullback by analysts."
Just looks a tthe ending 12-31-2017 financials.Approxiately 1/2 of net income was tax refund. Don’t believe that will happen every year.
"Wow! Unbelievable loss in value. In 2017 had huge tax benefit based on their financials. That and then some is gone. Lost 15.9 illion of market cap. If Berkshire didn’t dump, their loss would be close to $4.3 billion. This is from last shareholder report.Big supprised."
Notice the huge volume and little change Selling drying up A GOOD OMEN
Why KHC down 6 dollar in few week I am senior any long time investors please shed some light serious discussions even if you are short
Anyone see the show “the food that built america” on hist channel? It show Heinz company beginnings. Neat program. It also showed how KFC and Kellogs got started.
Best investment I made all year Kraft Heinz for ever
Why isn't uncle Warren averaging down ?
something gonna happen ...after a quarter like that ...heads are gonna roll for one thing...major shakeup coming ..and that is good
Mac and cheese is moving!! Labor Day bbq.. Oscar Meyer hotdogs!!
I will hold my shares till my hair turns grey.
8/9/2019 Guggenheim: Neutral to Sell11/14/2019 Goldman Sachs: Neutral to SellBIG money doesn't like this stock kids. Buffet has said countless times he wants a do over on this deal. gl
"I wanted to buy Heinz stock before they announced this merger and I wanted nothing to do with it after I saw Heinz stock run from 40 to $75. I remember thinking how can Buffet even make money that way after paying so much for a brand that historically had very stable valuation. I though maybe he knows something we all don't, it turns out he didn't and he just overpayed and chased it higher when he should have walked away. Always do your own DD"
I know we all want a fast buck and sometimes we don’t have no patience to wait a little. Buffet and 3G are in this great company heavy at a much higher price. I suggested to all that are buying at these low levels to hold all the way to $48 -$49. Keep in mind KHC will be very aggressive selling this Spring and Summer.
"BTW, slew of Overweights, buys, etc. issued today....most did lower target price to $80 though. Seems like good risk reward here..........waaaaay oversold and chart shows great support here in the $68 range."
"This will most likely b over 30$ tomorrow, we are at a a very big resistance and have a new ceo. Even if the earnings are OK we just need the ceo to bring some form of certainty and this will fly"
This is hilarious. How that Buffet/3g team feeling today. Nobody will ever invest with them after this. Bye bye.
Wall Street gamblers will never get it. They are making this stock so cheap that Berkshire will buy it all.
"I don't want to fight the herd, but shouldn't KHC, SJM, GIS earnings be up this coming quarter. There products are the one thing people are buying, especially if we go into quarantine mode. Am I naive in thinking that? Neither KHC or SJM are still getting pummeled the way financials, oil, materials, tech and everything else seems to be. That's is sad I'm saying a -3.43% is not that bad."
Earnings release before the open tomorrow. GLTA!
Reminds me of GE...the Skeletons are coming out.
"yes Patricio tried his best but still failed. In the past 3 years, KHC has been trying to appoint different CEOs to save the business. The reality proved none of them could save KHC which owns huge debt and heavily chemical processing food."
Was looking to average down at 50 when yield hit 5%. Waited and was able to add at 47.50 and 5.25% yield. Buy low and get paid to wait.
"LIKE IS SAID DON'T DON'T DON'T BUY IN YET PUT IN ABID BELOW $23 IN 2019 YOU WILL GET IT SOON IN 2019, 2019 A WASHED UP YEAR THEWORST IS YET TO COMES IN THECOMING QUARTERS THIS WILL CRASH CRASHBELOW $23 TO BELOW $24 MASSESESELLING DUMPINGBELOW $23 COMING"
"Anyone know if Butterball is a publicly traded company? in an overly simplistic view, it seems it should skyrocket during November, and be on sale the rest of the year."
KHC is of great value now. i just finish a club house barbecue gathering with lots of burgers and Heinz Ketchup used by most attendees. The moat is still there. As Warren Buffett indicated the operational KHC was doing fine. He still have confidence with 3G Capital. I guess that The goodwill write off is not a big deal.
"Kraft Heinz could be running out of cash, according to a Guggenheim analyst. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Ines Ferre break down the latest market moves."
"""Heinz to Home"" has started to work over here in the UK -- I sent my old mum a pack during lockdown of some of her favourites."
Is the earnings report before or after the bell today
when real numbers are posted..everyone will realize this is huge revenue generator just like before the write down..nothing has changed...billions and billions in revenue
"Stealth rally, no news. I like it."
"Kraft Heinz Co's (O:KHC) Ore-Ida, the main producer of frozen fries for supermarkets, is rushing to bolster supplies."
Should have bought GIS instead...
"No matter how you feel about KHC, might as well not sell today....goes ‘x’ tomorrow. At least the payout will mitigate, in some small way, any paper losses."
close above 32.5 on good volume is super bullish
"I got in pretty big at $26 after watching at $25 for awhile. As long as they keep paying dividend, a good long-term buy; maybe even short-term."
Buffet also owns shares of Apple .... and they will rebound just as Kraft-Heinz will do. Patience. next quarter we don't talk anymoreabout the fears of today
"Next time don't follow Warren, buy GIS instead. This thing is done for."
"Q2 release tomorrow, what about Q1 ?"
"I went Long KHC today just a small 50 share position. I remember when Phillip Morris sold Kraft, not sure why they did it but now all of them seem to have been thrown in the value stock bin. I believe their sales are more than NFLX, ROKU and TSLA but it just goes to show how crazy the stock market is at this time. KHC has a 22.4 operating margin, TSLA has .62. NAS:KHC's Operating Margin % is ranked higher than93% of the 1668 CompaniesIn case you all are not financial wizards, Operating Margin is the % of revenue you get to keep after expenses. So it's basically what you put in the bank after you pay your bills. This stock should be 60 and they'll prove it in a few quarters."
KDP and KHC both good stocks for 10 years

"This was an $85 - $91 stock Not to long ago and its sales are strong... once they get growth back again it will be in the $80’s again. Meanwhile collect the 5% dividend. It’s a safe stock owned 66% by Warren Buffet and 3G... what else can you ask for. Buffets average is around $53 - $56, of course this is a buy and the bottom was in. From this point on we climb slowing up !!"
Did I miss any NEWS
Why would anyone delete my post just because I said that it appears this stock is headed for $18 to $19? That's the truth. The big boys are propping it up to make a final kell on Friday. Just be careful as you trade this thing. It's gone.
Volume 4mil not even one hour..the big money is entering
"KHC will should have a 15-18 millions share big buyer on Mar 23 2019 Why the power of dividend reinvestment , Easy do the math 1.21 billions shares times .40 cents = about 484 million dollars should buy about 15 million shares. Plus you will have the shares that are short times .40 cents which should buy about 1.5- 3 million more shares and it will all depend on how many shares short had to pay the dividend before they covered. That's the true power of compounding makes for a guaranty buyers that day after the pay date."
All I can say is the avocado mayo is Amazing!
"keep holding, it's your money , wait till you see where it's at next week. a Lot LOWER."

Warren Buffet a value investor is making KHC a buying opportunity.
that's what you get with a Brazilian run company what do you say Warren. ??????
This is a great opportunity BUY
"you read cramer's khc ""don't buy, don't buy"" call 7/15. many of you suggest cramer usually makes an incorrect call. so, you're buying khc, right?"
Any reason their down 7% currently?? I love this stock think its very undervalued and will thrive in these conditions

"based on mostly bullish comments, KHC share has not reached the capitulation point yet."
$55 Soon Guarantee!
"Rush of positive comments lately from sheeples. KHC is a value trap much like GE in 2018. Too much debt on the balance sheet for a company struggling to grow. Glad they are being proactive and cutting the dividend now. This is heading to 30 en route to 25. No quick fix, take a look at Campbell’s Bolthouse farm acquisition to move into 21st century buying habits. It hasn’t worked out for them. These companies don’t know how to grow. As door dash, quick casual, delivery, pizza, Chipotle continues to grow it eats into companies like Kraft"

"Khc will spike household sku sales this qtr, sales will smooth off at a higher level than pre.-crisis but lower foodservice sales will negate most of the household increase. I hope khc isn’t hiring fulltime employees with benefits because this will pass and back to the gloomy reality"
"Time to nibble real soon (maybe not immediately, but watch it like a hawk - very very soon). GE turned itself around from 6 back up to 10 and will slowly continue to gain (small amounts) over the next 5 years as the company very slowly reduces debt load bit by bit. Craft at 34 is equavilent to GE at 6 or 7as it too has large debt load, but will slowly reduce it bit by bit. I don't see a fast turnaround and the stock could continue to drop below 30, who knows. That is why you dollar cost average in - little pieces at a time (50 shares). this is a time for young investors in their 20's and 30's to establish a position. All analysts have jumped on KHC like killer whales on the back of a baby hump back whale. Downgrade after downgrade, etc. Time to start watching a stock closely is when all the analysts hate it. If there is one guarantee about analysts; they are always wrong long term - when they attack in force and drive a stock down. Good luck to existing longs; add to your positions very very soon."

Looks like KHC has a great guy in charge and got the right CFO in charge time now to set back and let it ride raking in the dividends and waiting for KHC to go higher. I see a lot of upside. Always look for companies that are making the right moves to make the company better down the road than it is today."
dont sell before 90 $
"I bought KHC at $42/share, and have an average cost of 37$/share thinking I was smart to follow Buffet, but when I did the real analysis, I now have come to the conclusion that KHC is a Buy at 15 bucks and a sell at 30 bucks. So its currently trading at fair value, and this thing is not gonna sky rocket anytime soon. If your holding it like me, its only for the dividend and the long, long, long, long 10yrs + kinda deal."
"No offence @Zeev Goldansky, but your pumping the stock is not going to make it go up.

"The dividend when this company was merged was 50 cents quarterly in 2013. They increased it yearly 2 1/12 cents each each till now. Today it is slashed over 40% to 40 cents which is LESS THAN the original dividend declared 6 years ago. THIS IS A DISASTER for dividend holders. But, it will get up percentage wise as stock drops. But will this new dividend hold? Time will tell."

Dont Mr. Buffett own plenty of KHC shares?
3G just sold all their shares.... Bailing out or paving the way for Buffet to purchase?
I remember watching Kramer back middle of last year touting what a good opportunity KHC is after it plummeted. The guy is so full of himself.
nearly every house in us has multiple khc products in their kitchen right now..strong..especially ketchup and cream cheese coffee and fries..all are consumed and repurchased by same customers
Is this a buy?
Who saw this coming when they began messing with those weird upside down Ketchup bottles?
Jorge Paulo Lehman bought 3.5 million shares. 3G going way… Best decision ever!!!
Either this is the easiest stock to front run or the market doesn't care.
"They will throw in the kitchen sink this Q. The new CEO will want all the bad news out now so there is a lower base for him to show progress. Any estimates will be conservative, reserves, write-offs will go into the Q. If interested wait until after earnings for entry point."
"Not sure why my most recent posting didn't appear. Anyway, SEC's website has several Form 4 items for insiders purchasing or being awarded stock in KHC. The postings at SEC's website occurred yesterday (03 MARCH 2021). These largish amounts are a strong BUY signal to the market. My suggestion: Buy, Buy before its bye-bye.ALL SYSTEMS ARE ""GO"" FOR LIFTOFF !BTW, some of the insiders are the CEO and also the Head of Global Operations."
Why is this down so badly?
Brace for $26 or lower. Downgrades are coming on sales concerns. Even their strongest brands are losing market share. Consumer curiosity and price sensitivity is rising
NEW LOW! NEW LOW! NEW LOW!

"If the business is booming, increasing debt is not a bad thing. If the business is declining, huge debt will need to be paid off by filing chapter11. The logic here is so simple. Just ask yourself whether or not to love eating chemical mix and pollute your blood every day? KHC’s problem is not about marketing nor distributor channels which actually are its strengths. Its problem is its heavy chemical products. No one wants to literally get poisoned by them. Especially now there are So many healthy genuine options out there."
"Wow, I've never seen so many people suffering from amnesia!Less than 6 weeks ago we heard this:A loss of $10.34 a share in the quarter on an unadjusted basis.

Everyone needs cheese whiz!I’m buying right after the dividend is suspended!
"I bought this stock in 2019 at about $28.I figured that while big mistakes were made, the company can right itself in about 2 years.So...... here we are. The new beginning.What now?

Back over $40 by Friday and over $50 within 30 days!!! The selling has come to an abrupt halt.
I never ate Kraft dinner in my life and im 30 years old. But i did buy some OTM calls with far expiration bcuz this is going back up eventually.
the options market has an implied 2.10 move up or down. lets hope for the up.

Real PE of KHC is 17.55 right now. 63.21 divided by $3.60 earnings in the past 4 qtrs. Do the math yourself and dont fall for the pumpers who claim its 7. KHC did not make 8-9.00 a share ever like yahoo reports. The numbers are easy to do yourself or use a real site that uses the correct #shttps://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/khc/pe-ratio
$40+ as soon as next week. Watch this space.
Up up and away. Time to jump
right now bears in control..that won't last forever..I will add at times and hold long..3 to 5 years hold
"KHC is at 0.74 book value and valuation is way below Unilever 11 times, Campell Soup 11 times , General Mills 4.x times. , Kellogg at 8 times, Herey at 17.x times of book value. KHC should be able to dominate the food supply field once it is stablized. This is definitely an undervalued stock. New Management has identified the mistake previous CEO made. THe upside is at least 5 times to bring to bring it to a conservative 4 times book value. The debt has come down with positive contribution to the positive cash flows now."
"in a recession i rather be holding khc shares than shares in a lot of other companies. i am not predicting an imminent recession, but one will come again at some point in time. it is then that the defensive names will shine. even if khc is s$%t food. people need to eat. and in a recession, a lot of people need to eat cheaply. don't bash s$%t food."
"W@W Very Negative Comments Out Today (Strong Sell)OutlookManagement expects to continue with organic sales growth in 2019, on the back of additional consumption gains stemming from improved volume/mix. This, in turn, is expected to be fueled by innovation, whitespace and distribution endeavors, and pricing activities. These are likely to help Kraft Heinz battle cost-related worries.However, organic sales are anticipated to decline in the first quarter due to unfavorable year-over-year comparisons. Further, currency headwinds and divestitures are expected to hurt net sales by 3-4% in 2019.In terms of profitability, management expects adjusted EBITDA to decline at a high-teens rate in the first quarter, owing to cost inflation and planned commercial expenditure. Although the company in undertaking solid pricing initiatives, these are not likely to yield until the end of the first quarter. Moreover, management expects the bottom line to witness impressive growth from 2020.In 2019, earnings are likely to remain pressurized by soft EBITDA, increased depreciation costs and elevated interest costs, among other factors. Though the company remains conservative about 2019, it is on track to deliver consistent rise in profits from 2020 on the back of improved cost structures, brand strength and enhanced capacities.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -26.26% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Kraft has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Kraft has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months."
Why are people selling this stock. It has a PE of 10 and pays and 5% divi. Dividend is only have of earnings. Why isn’t this a $45 stock?
chat up in paid cons staple forums raising specter of interest rates rising going forward. we consider rate increase as not significant. THS earnings did set staples back as a whole.
barons and Cramer again..suspicious
Only concern is the dividend.
"Downgrade by Argus today from hold to sell, no reason behind downgrade."
Warren buffet have had a tough year... first IBM then Apple then this .... omg
Equity Bond....Kraft Heinz pays great yield and is inflationary hedge....next few earnings will be huge......amount of price promotion way down as people pay full price for groceries and cook at home trends will continue through much of 2021.
Value play - buy and hold. Dividend pays for your patience
Think it’ll get to 32? I think it will get a couple upgrades next week. And start climbing to 40’s
The king KHC remains green in such a down day. This the stock to own plus dividend.
"I'm holding comfortable. Just being patient, will be fine"
"""We just can't let this stock get to high and we don't want a short squeeze on our position, so we at Crump, Crump, and Crump downgrade this stock. With any luck our short position will make us at least $20 million. God bless America and our firm's ability to turn hot air into cash."""
Anyone know what time they report earnings at
What is it around 32 that makes this a 5% dividend stock again ?
So now revenues don’t matter ? They beat and it plunges

Too bad I wasn’t smart enough to sell them last December, would've had over $32,000.00Thanks Warren, this sure turned out great for Kraft shareholders :(Good luck to those staying with the ship."
The dividend will not help when it's sitting at 10 a share.
dividend is safe
"Omg, did KHC send the shareholders an address to send flowers to? This thing is headed to the funeral home. Warren, it couldn't happen to a better person..."
"KHC will be a gozillion dollars a share by the end of next quarter, just trust 90% of the posters on this board. Of course it hasn't done anything in the past 90 days since it fell off a cliff....I'm unclear if the delusion exists to convince others or themselves that riding this dead horse is such a grand idea. Warren Buffett makes mistakes. He admits that. Everything he touches is not golden. He admits that. Get over it. This is dead money. Wait for the dividend to get slashed again and keep posting about how great this is. Truth is a bitter pill for the longs."
"Is this a concern?""Kyros Law Offices is alerting investors of The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq:KHC) that it is investigating legal claims on behalf of investors against the company for possible securities fraud violations."" See story on Yahoo Finance KHC summary page."

Market down no biggie . Khc long green next week !
Picked up 1000 shares for a bounce on Monday. Hopefully Buffett gives some positive vibes over the weekend. Good luck to all.
Honestly Buffett a great investor is old now. 20 yrs younger and heads would roll. He was not so folksy as a younger man.
"Cramer should have said BUY, KHC but we all know Cramer won't tell you to buy KHC until it's already up $10-15 dollars and after all the Wall Street firms are in on the cheap"
"Pauline.....Recently,I saw a vegan mayonnaise in the organic section of my supermarket.Was it an organic food brand?No,it was Hellemann's which is an Unilever brand.Srores do not sign multi year supply contracts with small companies concerning food products.Tea or coffee is another matter."
Too many tired brands. Gotta thin the herd and start relating to millennial trends.
Credit Suisse“We are lowering our TP to $26 from $33 and our forward estimates on KHC below management guidance due to the possibility that the SEC’s investigation into the company will continue to reveal breakdowns in the company’s internal controls and negatively impact the company’s forward outlook. There is also significant uncertainty related to potential dilution from divestitures and reinvestment needs. We are lowering our FY19 and FY20 EPS well below consensus to $2.68 (from $2.80) and $2.61 (from $2.85). ”
"KHC will be fine. I just bought a few boxes if Mac and cheese, blue box. No problem, stock will be fine!"
I don't think that they will announce earnings until they sort out their accounting issues and restate the results for 2016 and 2017. If the issue is really regarding purchasing practices that should flow thru ending inventory and end being just a timing adjustment---but then why such a huge delay. Anyone have any ideas/news
This board taken over by spam.

Looks like KHC is bankrupt The Kraft Heinz Co Tangible Book per Share : $-26.87 (As of Sep. 2019)
So who’s buying today . I know I am open please !
"It is marking up in the last month as it is too cheap comparing to other consumer staples such as Unilever, Netstil , Mondelize etc."
WTH is going on? Wasn't KHC supposed to unveil their big Marketing and turn-around plan? Did they have that meeting? I can't find any news on it.
"I bought at 33.30... I'm not really down. It's like when I bout PayPal at 38 and it dropped to like 28... wink wink, see my point?"
"I'm glad everyone is so sanguine and positively looking forward to better times. The PUTS and covered CALLS have helped insulate me from 100% of the damage that has been created by the sudden collapse from $33 to $28.50. Take a look at the chart on this one. Back in June 17, just before the long descent began this stock was at $85. If you got in between $32-$35 thinking it was the bargain of the century it doesn't look that way right now. I don't mind saying that I hate to have to resort to buying PUTS to make up for a poor investment choice. The stock is clearly, deeply oversold by every technical yardstick that exists. It has been that way ever since it cracked through 66. So I, like the rest of you will get the dividend...but honestly I would like to see a relief rally that gets us back up into the mid-thirties and I will be happy to exit...."
Should I buy in at 28 ?

About tangible / intangible value: i just had a look at similar well known food suppliers... They all trade way above their book value and if you take off brands and goodwill from the assets the price to book ratio can reach 10 or even higher... All this to conclude that KHC is now way undervalued compared to its peers.=> Perfect case of value stock here

(BIIB) and Kroger Co. (KR) while increasing its stake in Kraft Heinz Co. (KR), the company disclosed late Friday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Berkshire reported a stake of about 648,000 shares of Biogen and 549,000 shares of Kroger that were not listed in last quarter's filing. Kroger shares rose 6% after hours, while Biogen shares advanced 2%. Also, Berkshire increased its stake in Kraft to about 10.5 million shares from 9.1 million in the previous quarter.

Think about it. This is a 100 year old company with roots in every part on the world. Since they merged it has never been below 48.00. Intrinsic value 49.00
Spin Heinz back off into a separate company like before. Take Kraft private.
what is dropping it this morning PM??
KHC reached a new 52 Week Low at 69.51
over 200 brands..could easily sell 5 and not miss a beat
Welcome to the bottom.
When you look at the chart we pretty much found a bottom or a near bottom. I mean this can’t go down for ever.
Just maybe Warren will do the right thing and sue all the companies that were faults reporting KHC earnings would be today. as they tried to manipulate KHC. Might just be fun for Warren to do the right thing and watch the squirm.
"Impressive move to the upside, just hope it holds through the close."
Just took my profit from other stocks from December low buys and loaded up on KHC again! Just sitting pretty for awhile until back to $80-90 per share in the future
cag and bgs have debt but have better balance sheets than khc. ceo is a marketing specialist with zero ceo experience and surrounded by marketing ppl so how is he suppose to turnaround a company? growth was dreadful in canada and rest of world. KHC does bulk of sales in US and it declined another year. it will take MANY years for this to pay off debt while revenues have been shrinking in these companies for years. the dividend is a HUGE problem as it takes most of their money for a turnaround either by paying down debt or buying growth or funding improvements within.
"KHC, MPLX, MPC, WBA, KL, CRON, GILD......BUY THESE STOCKS AND WIN. NO SLEEPLESS NIGHTS EITHER !!!!"
Expect a double Smart money will prove it
"SO NOT SELL until you start hearing all the wonderful claims about KHC coming back from the dead. So far news has mostly bashed KHC until the past couple of months. NEWS is always a byword, after the fact, signal. Once this gets into the 40's you will most likely hear wonderful claims of how smart Buffet is picking KHC and etc articles about how great the dividend is. THIS IS WHEN YOU SELL!!!!. Wait till the news over-expresses the greatness of KHC. Well will be in the 40's before you know it."
Long term hold buy now at 25.00 and collect the .40 cents a share
"Update: S&P Puts Kraft Heinz On Review For Possible Downgrade That Would Move It Closer To Junk Status -- MarketWatch9:21 am ET March 18, 2019 (MarketWatch)Share PrintS&P Global Ratings said Monday it is placing Kraft Heinz Inc.'s (KHC) BBB rating on review for a possible downgrade that would lower the food giant's ratings closer to speculative, or ""junk,"" status. The company's BBB rating is two rungs above investment grade. The move comes after Kraft Heinz failed to file its 2018 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission by its due date, which was extended to March 14 at the end of February. It also follows ""a series of negative developments over the last several quarters, including operational shortfalls that accelerated in the second half of 2018, the large fourth-quarter $15.4 billion goodwill and intangible charge-off, and disclosure of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into the company's accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to its procurement function,"" S&P said in a release. The ratings agency expects to resolve the issue following a review of the 10-K and first quarter of 2019. ""It is likely that a downgrade would be limited to one notch, unless particularly negative information is uncovered,"" said the release. Shares were slightly lower premarket, but have fallen 50.9% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.6%.-Ciara Linnane"
No rush to buy. As long as you get it below $31 you are a smarter investor than Warren Buffett and 3G. Pretty cool to tell your grandkids
"BOYS....KHC NEXT EARNINGS CALL WILL BE A BLOWOUT NUMBER. BUFFETT, MAY WANT TO MAKE HIS MOVE BEFORE THEN !!!! HE ALREADY OWNS OVER 26%, AND BY GOING PRIVATE HE REDUCES COST SUBSTANTIALLY. COMPANIES GO PUBLIC FOR FINANCING......NEWS FLASH. BUFFETT DONT NEED IT !!!! THIS COULD VERY WELL TURN OUT TO BE BUFFETTS FINEST HOLDING, AND AS WE KNOW . HE HAS MANY !!!!"
If Buffet likes this company and back the company... Heinz is Heinz and we will always buy Ketchup... The Price vs book is just 1... P/E is 6.14 ... 4.10% dividends rate... It's a no brainer for me... We'll see in 2 or 5 years if I was wrong on that one...
"Bought at 24 in March for dividend now vaccines are out there it might go down, I am thinking to sell khc and like to buy Dal or Mo any thought I am 73"
Loading up boys !
I'd like to get my money out of this investment. An eventual move into the low thirties would do it. I like the brand and use several of their products. I hope the company sees how important it is to keep in touch with its customers and change quickly as their habits change. This has been their single biggest mistake. They fell behind the curve....
This has lost over one years dividend payout since Aug.
"and they cant cut the dividend or investors, i'm talking about intuitions BAIL. it'll look like BGS. stock down sharply with a HUGE dividend that if their advertising campaign fails will be a big disaster because khc management are marketers. their expertise is marketing. theres no growth in the sector, everyone is fighting for the comsumer and prices are going down. its a losing business with tight margins. and getting tighter and tighter all the time."
Would buffet ever increase holdings by another 10%? 3.8B share buy would surely move this one.
I tried the unbranded Philly cream cheese as it was 1 buck cheaper than Kraft.. Next time its back to KRAFT !!! They are top quality and not bland.
When KHC gets cheaper....maybe Buffett will just buy it outright.
Is now the time to buy?
cramer is always wrong
I believe they kept pushing this back so they could show some good numbers..and reveal government investigation complete
Next stop $47 close the gap
"The same CS analyst (Robert Moskow) who downgraded the stock today with pt $26, upgraded to hold and pt $52 only 7 months ago. Clearly an analyst with no vision. If the argument is uncertainty, well in one way or another the company will redress the situation. Panic now is only for the unexperienced."
KHC is the best pick if you count the dividends paying over 5% and you have some upside. Just by not coming in as bad as Wall Streets thinks everything bad is now priced in.
Watch out if goes to 33.25. It should break past that.
I can't believe everyone on here saying not to buy. to buy a company like Kraft with a pe of 7 close to it's book value is hard to find. I bought back after 2008 at 10 dollars a share I think before there merger and I think this is a perfect time to buy
Looks destined to close gap $48
Oversold and electronic trading. last 3 hours of trading set the floor.
So much noise every day. It all comes down to filtering out all the noise. Long $KHC and $MO
At what price is this irresistible?
50 day getting close to crossing 200... then it will jump
"""People gotta eat"" ""Its in my kitchen"" ""I use it"" ""Most popular brands on the face of the earth"" Personal market research all by personal marketers long on KHC that dooms you to failure.Please avoid for now. Not forever. The company is not dead. It is on a respirator."
"Earnings will go through the roof due to all the sales from the Coronavirus situation. All Publix supermarkets were practically empty and when the food arrived, it’s gone by the next day. This will be a blowout quarter for Kraft. Keep in mind that die to the shutdown families were eating inside their house. Buy and hold this will go back to $60 !!"
"Finally.....if current price holds stock price will be over the 50day mov avg line for first time after the big drop to under $25.Excellent rebranding of products: Heinz ketchup blended with veggies; mayonnaise made with Eggs from Free Cage chickens; Planter's Nuts relabelled with catchy phrase NUT...ritional. I follow the Peter Lynch school of investing. Go check the shelves at Walmart, Sam's Target etc. For those who want a safer high income trade go for IAE and/or NRDBY"
"KHC is a dinosaur. Just decades and decades of pouring $$$ into branding and marketing while the competition developed comparable quality at cheaper prices and/or better quality at comparable prices. I can by practically any KHC-like product at Aldi or Walmart or Costco at half the price and, really, it's as good or better. When you realize your paying this corporation for marketing and politically-correct blah blah you'll get out."
"Not sure if anyone follows what the large hedge funds and institutions are buying, but several added last quarter. Not bullish, not bearish, not an onwer...just passing along what I read and offer anyone who cares can go read it for themselves. Personally I thought it was interesting."
Long hall dividend reinvestment here.
It’s time to buy? I want to invest $10.000 here
Been noticing a lot of commercials for Deli Fresh and Maxwell House lately. KHC must be in the midst of a new marketing campaign. Must admit Deli Fresh is very good and about the same price as deli service meats and does not start to get old until you open the package.
"Food is a great inflation hedge.....and KHC low valuation provides 30% upside in near term, I believe."
Just passed by the market and got myself some ketchup and mayo. guess which brand was all over the shelves? Hitting $50 by end of year
"This drop is due to the global markets that are all red today, this is influencing khc since his beta is higher than 1. The price is juste eveb more cheap at the moment..."
"I am out, this feels like GE. It seems like they are complicating a very simple business model."
W@W Dow at New High.....ATT (T) Declares a Huge 51cent share Dividend.GREAT News All Over Today !
"Pete Najarian was the buyer of the 10000 KHC call options yesterday.Watch the Halftime Report video from yesterday.WOW.Warren Buffet retiring from the board doesnt mean much.He 's getting old and wants to reduce his travel.I find it interesting that he is not being replaced from someone at Berkshire.So,he must have confidence in the company's direction and his stake in it.Van Damme who is replacing Buffet seems to be an Independent director from Europe who is a shareholder in one of 3G's holdings."
"KHC couldn't get traction on a plowed, salted and sanded road with snow tires and chains. If you're in for the dividend and need the income there are better choices. This isn't a growth stock. It just isn't. Pushers on here beginning to look pathetic. It's just not going to $40 anytime soon. Sell all the ketchup and sad box macaroni you can. Still no $40."
Looks like the SEC is done with KHC here is the press release. nonthing new looks like KHC all good to go higher from here.http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kraft-heinz-files-annual-report-fiscal-year-2018
Hope price to stay at this level or a little lower for next week's big dividend payout and reinvestment. Compounding for the long haul until true intrinsic value can be reached later.
"Price looks good, and the company makes a lot of products that are in my kitchen. The nice thing about a stock crashing is it gives plenty of room for growth."
Earning on July 30. In past five years the earliest earnings was Aug 3. Latest Aug 8. They say if earnings are pushed so much earlier usually it’s a good earnings!
The 3G stock sale was the near term kiss of death for KHC. Still believe 1-2 years we will all make boatloads(if you bought lower 30's upper 20's).
"BARON... Nice call on KHC! Also, how has shorting Tesla at $371 worked out for you? Have you covered yet? LOL!!"
could run out of cash says analyst ... they will have to sell assets and cut dividend AGAIN
Oh look another 52 week low!
"An article recently written by Murray Coleman, an investment writer for Index Fund Advisors said that Wharton researchers found Jim Cramer’s AAP Portfolio produced an annualized return of just 4.08% in the 16-plus years which were reviewed. At the same time, the S&P 500 gained 7.07% and IFA Index 100 returned 9.29% per year"
Don’t worry if there was a recession people would run to the supermarket and Mac and cheese !
Berkshire hathaway will be dropping like a stone.
"Way cool! It seems Warren finished dumping his shares!We'll bounce for sure, maybe even 2 bucks."
KH is a defensive stock.The stock market may yet see new highs but the correction will start before year end.All that money that is chasing FANG stocks is going to go where? lol Buy and hold for 18 months.KH will see new highs by the end of next year.
march sets alltime record for grocery sales. Nielsen stated u.k. sales up 20% for the month. up 43% for week ending 21st. average person has made 3 more trips in the month of march then average.. with more lockdowns announced this morning and extensions added almost everywhere this trend continues
Kraft seems set up to offer a Beyond Meat competitor at a good price
obviously some news with financial statement fiasco..should find out tomorrow
Time to buy
Will we hold $25 if fitch cuts them to junk. Why isn’t buffet buying here?? This is bad
perfect time to buy..??
super stock screener still maintains super buy on KHC. current super buy continues super stock screener previous call of super buy. not using quotes to indicate specific url site as yahoo/verizon tends to not post if incuded.
Long
"If the new CEO restores brands by using marketing/advertising that were cut under the previous CEO, KHC could easily move to 40's."
This is a very good business actually.
buy at 30
Hum less than book value. Time for me to double up.
Still a huge Berkshire holding....as long as they can keep the dividend it will rebound
Easy buy . I’ll come back in December!
Q&A highlights:--very strong in developing countries--iconic brands showing pricing power--CEO Patricio: we are just getting into the 2nd inning of our transformationRe-invigorated ad campaigns clearly bearing fruit.Blue skies overhead.
"Short-Term.... this stock is going into correction mode. Long-Term, this blue-chip dividend stock is quite solid.Since the whole market is about to take a dump any day now, and this stock's chart is flashing sell signals like a strobe light at a rave party, I'll take the short-term play with this one."
Folks botton is in... and I tell some very big blocks buying KHC at these levels. As investors move to safer dividend paying stocks KHC will move up to $42.50 - $45.00. When the market goes down these food companies go up !! Time to buy now.
accounting gimicks mask huge quarter..looking stronger all the.time..the accounting games.will end.at some point
"Wow, pretty bullish now!"
Nice move if it holds.
KHC is a disasterLONG TERM DEBTKhc 28 billionK 7 billionCag 9 billionBgs 2 billionPost 6 billionMkc 4 billionGis 12 billionI can fit multiple long term debts of major food companies into khc’s!! Khc has been mismanaged. Really mismanaged and have products that will again show dwindling sales once things start to get back to normal.
Selling has been relentless.See what happens tomorrow.
Amazon should buy KHC
Great day for the “Kraft” name !!!
Need some positive comments on the conference call or else look out below!
Buffet said a further impairment charge would come. Read the article. This one will send the stock to $15. Read the article.
"This was, is and has been the peoples choice. Food is needed world wide. They stepped on their wangs and will fix all their problems. Stick around and buy cheap."
Not only stock price is important. KHC brings profit and dividend to BRK. You have to put money to work. Stock will eventually follow.
"What is a $5 earnings per share company worth?What are the individual pieces worth?Sell off half of the pieces, pay off debt, then decide what it is worth."
Advice for management.Buy the future not the past!
how many negative articles in barons AFTER it dropped 70%..nice call 1 year too late
The Cramer effect! Read he is not a fan. Time to move up!
I wish Warren Buffett would stop talking about overpaying for this stock.
Great buy. Khc long folks #USA
if everyone is seller no buyer then why its not tanking 50% 100%
This will be green by close of trading.....Said no one with an ounce of brains.
"Will Warren Buffett buy out KHC as the Elephant size acqusition ? It is like precision cast part, he owns a piece than offered the buyout. He owns KHC and.may as well buy out at this cheap price with a company he familiar with."
"I am going off of the message boards. Taking way too much time and productivity out. Also, decided not to check the stock prices for the next 3 years. It drains so much mental energy, it is unbelievable. Fwiw, I am invested into KHC, WFC, BAC, BA, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, TSLA and CELG. Let's see how they fare after 3 years. Will it be a nice surprise or will I suffer a stroke? Time will tell. Goodbye all and Good luck whichever side you are on."
"Warren, please buy some ketchup?"
Dont by a share until the BOD is replaced! They have allowed the company to be looted!
today is a huge market up day or Kraft would be down a lot more
"Getting cheaper by day, bought some yesterday at 33.20 added today at 32.20 will assess to buy to average. long time holding since my first purchase at $27 ."
"Selling what makes it great, is troublesome... I hope they can work their magic on new food items. They really do make perfect tasting foods."
Textbook value stock case here
"BOYS....HERES ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER WITH BUFFETT. HES DECISIVE, I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE MADE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT TUESDAY MORNING. NICE LONG WEEKEND TO PUT A PLAN TOGETHER. NOW, I AM NOT SAYING THAT IS CERTAIN, BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT BUFFETT KNOWS EXACTLY WHATS HES DOING AND HAS ALL THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. BOYS, THIS IS JUST BUSINESS TO BUFFETT. HES WORKED OUT OF JAMS BEFORE. BELIEVE ME BUFFETT AINT SWEATIN !!!!"
Big day..closing in on 52 week high... can’t wait to close over $40 the first time
blowout quarter..guess people cant.read
The street’s new article price target for khc js $60. Maybe a bit optimistic but in long run it’s possible
Buffet is probably buying this pennies on the dollar
"REMEMBER, When a stock falls 30%, it needs to climb 60% to break even. :("
That's a lot of ifs.
BS. WILL BE UP. BUFFETT WILL KEEP BUYING MORE HERE. VERY CHEAP STOCK
Loading up more . Going long !
"Did Warren Buffet say ""Uncle,"" yet?"
And this is supposed to be defensive stock ----one to which people go to in troubling times like today---I guess not today
seeking alpha ran an article negative on khc..that site is pyschotic..one day they run article to buy..the next day article to sell..they take both sides of the bet
"Pretty interesting that an insider would buy 40K shares at an average price over $33 when that’s above both the 50 and 200 moving daily average, and the stock’s recent ceiling is around $35.Quite bullish?"

Credit Suisse warns of Kraft dividend cut. Surely this will bring it down to 29.05?
Basically...the write-down improves the future earnings. Smart and necessary adjustment.
"Dividend of $1,60 at current price is almost 5%. Time to buy."
going back to 40 in a month
$50 is close to entry level. Still too high and estimates are declining.
Is Uncle Warren on suicide watch? This dog will never catsup to its closing price from yesterday.
"Ibott.......bacon bits would be a great addition to the ""Just crack an egg"" breakfast scramble bowls.These are marketed under the Ore-Ida brand and were just introduced in February.KHC cant keep up with the demand for this product,the CEO said at earnings."
"Processed manufactured foods.... yuk...Heinz at least creates real food items, Kraft? produces garbage , always has and the market place is turning away to real foods."
ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW.
Food cos. are all in a bear market. It doesn't matter how much their undervalued.
Yea this stock is gold RN. Any industry other than consumer food is a nightmare you have no idea when you’ll wake up from
"The market just overreacted, hold thru the pain and ull be fine."
Hope there's a sell-off tmw. I would like to add shares. The brands will survive for sure.
khc stock will be ten dollars by years end
"I hear a lot about debt. Does anyone know when the next debt maturity is? I’m not particularly concerned with the total amount, but maturities are the primary concern. Debt can be refinanced and pushed out further down the road (KHC is not a live person with an expendable life term), as to allow the company to focus on returning to growth."
Looks like JP Morgan wants cheaper shares for themselves and their partners....an easy way to get them. In my opinion.
we're flying

"April puts tell all. There are a lot of 50 dollar strikes plus and minus. When these open contracts are closed you will know that KHC is going to begin it's climb from the grave. I've been watching the 50, and a few days ago it had around 18K open now about 11K somebody took their money and ran. Most were opened the first day of the big drop. They've been bouncing it daily to skim as much as they can before they lose control. Whose selling now? The dump happened. This is just a shake out. I was waiting for a big leg down to bust weak hands but with the puts diminishing I think it's time to stick your head up. I will be jumping in on this head long when the tide turns, already have my floaty's on!"

"A double bottom has been put in KHC , also with rates getting slashed it will become cheaper to service debt which KHC has plenty. The downside risk for this stock has been reduced substantially."
Thank u Z for historical past khc price.
"All the falling knives I tired to catch has cost me dearly KHC at 29.85 was one to remember. initially I bought 500 shares at 32.20 and was happy with dividend , today I attempted to average down and double my shares which was a mistake.Donation is accepted I post my broker account on go fund."
"Lot's of people here trying to hype their shares in KHC. This stock is toxic because KHC misread the changing consumer sentiments on their products. Now it's all about ""healthy"" eating. KHC will need some new thinking at HQ before they can recover. If you're long you may have a chance way down the road. Personally, I like their products. But I'm old enough to have grown up with KHC. The new generation will need some incentive to revive this brand."
"Here we go...33-35 by close. Upgrades over next few days. Base now rock solid...and upside is the only real direction .

Also I would like to mention that khc's relationship ended with McDonald's when they hired burger kings former CEO. But they still have 60 percent of ketchup market. What abt Pepsi? They sell healthy fooda?"
KHC is on its way to double the price in this year. Hold tight.
"I thought it was worth reading- JakeBy Jonathan PolandIt's finally a bargain. Big drop, Buffett loss, your gain. It's that simple.Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) didn't divest its holding of Kraft Heinz (KHC), so picking up the stock at this bargain basement price now makes total sense. My first article on the holding wasn't well received, garnering 2.6 star rating. At the time, I was asking the question ""Is Kraft Heinz Buffett's Biggest Mistake?"" last summer. At the time the stock was just below $60 a share. Now it's at $35. • Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with KHC. Click here to check it out. • KHC 15-Year Financial Data • The intrinsic value of KHC • Peter Lynch Chart of KHCHowever, now that the market has acted irrationally, sending the stock price down 28% in a day, the multiples look more in line with slow-growth blue-chip companies. And, the dividend yield is super juicy! Finally, it's a buy. And, all these downgrades just further the idea that it's a bargain. Investment analysts are usually the last people to hop on or off the bagwagon. This time it's no different and with the stock trading below $35 (pre-market), Buffett himself should be buying more down here.￼Buffett even admitted to overpaying for the stock, a mistake that he should not be making on a company like this, but Mr. Market gets us all. Buffett told CNBC, ""I was wrong in a couple of ways about Kraft Heinz. We overpaid for Kraft."" And, ""It's still a wonderful business in that it uses about $7 billion of tangible assets and earns $6 billion pretax."" But, ""we paid $100 billion in tangible assets. So for us, it has to earn $107 billion, not just the $7 billion that the business employs."" More importantly, Berkshire is not selling or lowering its stake in the company. What more vote of confidence do you need that the stock is on sale?Aside from the 7.15% dividend yield, thanks to the 27% sell-off, the stock is now priced at less than book value and below 10x forward earnings. Is Kraft Heinz going out of business in 10 years? What about 20? Highly unlikely. That's all investors need to know at this point. While we may not have a bear market, this is a bear price for an incredible company. Take advantage while you can.Disclosure: I am not long or short Kraft-Heinz.This article first appeared on GuruFocus."
"why do they report these after hour trades as real...many times just 1 share trades by some short seller trying to scare everyone...like today..price over 32 whole time except one trade at end to ""paint it low"""
"Human population increasing every second, obese people everywhere and these food companies have declining sales. They can't all be eating organic spinach."
KHC trades at approx. .88 of book value if I'm close to correct. I say buy the dips and forget about your investment next 5 years...should be a winner...
Up on heavy volume!
This is frustrating. A year ago it was 97 .
"there is still 30% downside here. until they eliminate the dividend and the Executive suite, this will continue to drop"
I give this a triple double down jim Kramer buy buy buy which really means to sell. Always do the opposite of jim Kramer
Will buy more once this balances out . Great stock to buy !
"Here is a puzzler for you :-Warren Buffet talks about a high return on net tangible assets and implies it is a brilliant business because of that, i.e. returning $4.9bn+ of operating income on net tangible assets of �7Bn. Great -- that implies a return on assets of 60%+ or greater.That's all very fine and dandy, but are we to completely ignore the rest of the balance sheet?Goodwill of $36Bn for example or:-Intangibles of $49BnWell given the pain of last years write downs, clearly you can't just brush these under the carpet.The real ROCE (return on capital employed) is EBIT (or operating income) / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities), which on a quick #$%$ packet calculation = $4.96bn/($103.46Bn-$7.5Bn) = 5.2%So the real return is 5.2%.I believe there is recovery potential in the share price here, and it has some momentum right now with Covid, but as a long term investment, do you choose a company with a ROCE of 5.2% or one at 25%+ for which there are a plethora of them in the US market today?I'm holding out for the recovery, but long term is the dividend sufficient to retain interest if the business can only return 5.2% which is close to what is being paid out?Shoot me if I've got something wrong here guys.Larry -- From over in Blighty across the pond."
I'm eating KD tonight!
Excluding 9/12 KHC has been up for an impressive 12 days straight.
I just bought 2 thousand shares at the 52 week low at hoping to get few points out in short period of time. Any options
"very pleased with this swoosh down, will have money for walmart goodies this weekend. lol"
I've had a buy order open since Friday morning for 34.50..........and it just wont execute........C'mon.....a couple of cents.....
Wow! I am long but seriously reconsidering! My hands are shaky right now
$40+ in August. Watch and see.
"barrons and these ""analysts"" should hire me to do their work because theyre just hiding in their NYC townhouses not visiting the stores and talking to people who visit target , walmart and the other box stores that sell competitors. theyre just plugging numbers saying the divy is safe without seeing the big picture. laughable."
Roll over dividends wash rinse repeat
Higher highs is good. Only 2.5 million shares traded so no one has picked up low here. We had 8-10 million shares a day when shorts and I assume tax loss sellers liquidated all throughout December. Every comment I read says will buy after stabilizes so possibility here to rally into a China trade deal quite solidly. However needs to follow through. This has been hit end of day for a month.
Cramer has never been right on anything his whole life..that should be enough to buy this stock alone
"The Peter Dorrance Group, is adding significantly totheir position in KHC, as per Carter Randle, Executive VP."

"Warren Buffett screwed up the stock market for everyone. Since he thinks splitter stock is a bad idea, now no one splits. Companies try to buy back shares to reward shareholders. This limits the number of shares available and inflated stock prices. Makes it tougher to get in and more painful if you get it wrong."
60 end of year
People over here only post stuff when the stock is down. Since yesterday the shares of KHC are up almost 3.5% and no one has anything to say.
I like the pay for higher share price deal..this guy needs to perform to get paid big
Even in a total market crash KHC earnings will be minimally affected
OVERREACTION period
this is what happens when management only focuses on cost cutting and squeezing every little penny out of operations. I wonder what it was like to work there? must have been very unpleasant.
Perfect Investment under this circumstances. Unbelieveable great opportunity.
"It's definitely bleeding real blood, isn't ketchup. Somebody get a nurse in here."
"Grandet believes Kraft Heinz must “aggressively” sell close to $7 billion in assets and slash the dividend by 50% to conserve cash. If Patricio is unable to pull the trigger on these things, well, it won’t be good. Grandet thinks Kraft Heinz could run out of cash as soon as 2020 at its spending current pace if those assets aren’t unloaded and the dividend isn’t cut."
"folks with no formative ideas are selling out creating good opportunity. not a stretch here at all to see bottom begin to form. no, i'm not saying bottom is in. but, you can't buy at the bottom. i have lost huge sum at this point, but continue to manage avg down. ymmv."
"MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. packaged food giant Kraft Heinz has launched the sale of its baby food brand Plasmon with preliminary bids due by the end of next week, two sources close to the matter said.Private equity firms and food groups are looking at the business, both sources said, adding it could be worth about 700 million euros ($783 million)."
see this all the time before good earnings report..stay calm and wait for real information..not all the misinformation posted by shorts
"Benzinga · 4/17/2020, 11:17:17 AMJP Morgan maintains Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $30 to $34"
Not bad Kraft Heinz. Not bad at all..https://finance.yahoo.com/m/fed6b9e0-87d0-38bc-9a6b-454686e25d0f/kraft-heinz-signs-deal-with.html
Khc long . God bless 45 . #USA strong .
Im just wondering if its really too late sell. If most of the downside is priced in here or maybe even too much downside priced in then we can get a bounce. A 28% decline in one day steep. Im debating whether to sell or not. Its only a small part of my portfolio..
"BUFFETT....IS TAKIN KHC HIGHER, WITH HIM ITS ...PERSONAL. BANK IT !!!!!"
Folks this is going up . Mark my words . Enjoy

I have basically owned this since buying Altria in 2002. Pretty much has been free for me. I'll sit and collect the dividend still
Headed North Next Week.Looks like a nonstory as usual. error of less than 1pct on the books...like every other Corp. who the hell is paying $139 for a fake meat company that is not earning a profit. ABSURD...stick with KGC and the divi for the long term.
Buffett is holding the line at 31.70. This is a steal. He is going to transition them back to profitability. Expect bounce to 40 after 10k
Maybe a good time to add some more before Q1 is released. I love this stock now it's undervalued
Looked at GE as a cautionary measure before buying…GE 12 mos ago $14 …dropped to $6.41 ….a 47% decrease( thanks to bad news and shorts scaring the GE stock holders to sell)…now $10.85 pre market …GE dividend .0038...Kraft 12 mos ago 68.59…dropped to 32.12 a 46.8% decrease (thanks to bad news and shorts scaring the Kraft stock holders to sell) now $32.18 pre market…Kraft Forward Dividend & Yield 2.50 (5.19%)Shorts you have been warned
Not going to test 52 week lows imo. Ceo bought 20 mill worth and 3g co-founder 100 mill. As for CRAMER he is a FOOL!! Should be off the air!! Him and I believe a guy named Greenberg many years ago bashed a stock that I made a million on!! said to SELL!! The stock was Hans now Monster the greatest growth stock in History!!
"Good thing i bought on Friday, i just shouldn’t of bought AT&T yet though. Still faling"
I came out khc. Will probably enter each time they announce some bad news: Missed top line.. missed bottom line.. divy cut.. asset impairment.. capital structure deterioration..
I’m hearing Kraft nearing deal for organic Hain Foods @ 49$ a share accounting for KHc strength...
KHC is a great inflation play with a good dividend to boot.
Mr. Buffett contemplating on taking this private!!
KRAPTOver-processed foods have peaked.Studies prove that kids that eat natural foods have straighter teeth. The mechanics of chewing tougher foods forces teeth to straighten out.You don't even need teeth to eat Krapt foods.
BOYS...I LOADED THE BOAT BIG TIME AT 30.57 YESTERDAY. NOW...I SIT BACK AND RELAX. BUFFETT AND THE BOARD WILL NOW DIRECT THE TURNAROUND....BANK IT !!!! I LOOK FOR SOME SALES AND SOME BUYS BY KHC THIS YEAR.
Doing well and it will continue
"3G still is 20% owner of KHC, so they wanted $700M to use, so what."
Not bad results at all at this point in the turnaround. Have to listen to the call but it is good to see they are reigning in expense and more focused on the rollout of new products.
"its beginning to look a like christmas everywhere you go. i love khc, see this is what khc used to be, on a nice downtrend and people banking, very nice. looks like more ""great value brands"" this weekend for me."
This thing held up well.
"I keep posting this and they delete it…so here we go again for a third time.. Shorts who is buying your oversold shares? RSI 13 Perhaps WB…he has billions on the side and looking for a great priced stock…with a PE of 4.05 (that for some reason is not showing on the Yahoo summary for KHC) and dividend of 4.5%...seems like a good value for WB…WB sold IBM, Apple, and Oracle, but kept Kraft….Money talks….Listen"
"I wouldn't have touched this stock on an individual basis. Just my old school valuation philosophy, but any $120B company that carries $100B of the assets on their books as ""Goodwill and Intangibles"" is riding on faith and not substance."
"Khc isn’t going anywhere and you will never, ever see this price again. I’m a grocer manager and they strong arm you in buying and allocating shelf space. They sell everything from A1 steak to weight watchers. Get a grip, plus there in every continent on earth"
this stock will hit 100 again when there is a food crisis
Buy for the 5+ yield/ hope for share appreciation long term.
It’s the Cracker Barrel Mac and cheese.. that stuff is moving!!

Question: will KHC’s turnaround plan in May include a reduction of the dividend? Up = yes; Down = no
Easy buy . Easy money !
Amusing motley fool now recommend khc after spending all last year when it was cheap bashing the stock
Oscar Mayer Opens the Wienermobile for Overnight Stays on Airbnb. This is the genius PR departments recent release. BULLCRXP!
Is it too much to just ask for a 1% daily increase?
Berkshire average price for KHC is 43.04$ and want to hold until they recover and exceed the carrying value
"Hard to believe I sold my position out in the $70s. Here we are near 52wk lows again. Pivots 25.72, 24.85 and hail Mary of 22.40. You would think a consumer staple would be at highs. Maybe $23ish is a safe entry point. GL longs..."
This is really sad. It is a sinking ship. I will hold my shares though.
STOOGES /LIBERALS......I REALIZE YOU BOYS DO NOT UNDERSTAND CAPITALISM. SO LISTEN UP !!!! KHC WILL SELL OFF SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS WITH LITTLE TO NO GROWTHAND REDUCE DEBT. THEY WILL THEN MAKE SOME NICE BUYS OF UP AND COMING COMPANIES.YES...THE TURNAROUND LIKELY TAKES A YEAR. THE BUY POINT IS 29.50. THEN LOAD THE BOAT. ITS A 45 DOLLSR STOCK IN 2021. I CAN LIVE WITH 50% ON MY MONEY OVER THAT TIME....PLUS THE SAFE DIVIDEND!!! WISE UP AND RIDE MY COAT TAILS. ALSO....IF THE MARKET TANKS....KHC WILL BE MUCH LESS PRONE TO A SELL OFF !!!
"So seems the bottom is in. Buyers are outweighing sellers, and they will battle it out over next couple of days, 2 weeks tops"
all the bad news is out all good from here on out --change in management this is excellent stock to purchase it's been through hell now try to recover
"{accounting issues: ""Kraft Heinz revealed the development in its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings release. The company said, however, that it does not expect this issue to be material to financial statements for this period or previous ones."""
A small bounce maybe? 28% is a very steep drop in one day. Its hard to know for sure but I think maybe too much of a drop...
Glad that I sold ketchup company at $33.18 with a small tiny gains.
does anyone receive dividend ?
"This becomes a very secured day trade stock. But below $32, you will make the money."
"BUFFET has $135 billion waiting for a BIG turnaround ,my guess he pays $50 for the rest of KHC that he doesn't already own, INTERESTING"
"During the past 12 months, the average Free Cash Flow per Share Growth Rate of The Kraft Heinz Co was 58.60% per year. During the past 3 years, the average Free Cash Flow per Share Growth Rate was 25.80% per year."
Lol finally went over my buy in
Buy when others are fearful... Especially 2 days before a major earnings release
It is about time WB offers to buy out the whole company as part of the E lol elehant size acqusition.
"ok, so the underperforming division was sold for 12+ Ev/EBITda and KHC in whole is trading at 10-11x EV/EBITda....."
New 52 wk low. Gotta love it.
Bc there are 1 millions of reasons to be bearish it but not even 1 reason to be bullish it! All the way to low 20s first then teens!
Kraft Heinz declared dividend of $0.40 today also.https://news.kraftheinzcompany.com/press-release/financial/kraft-heinz-company-declares-regular-quarterly-dividend-040-share-4
Book Value Per Share (mrq) $42.25. Don't let the ANALcysts scare you into selling... a buyout offer atleast 20pct more than current book value from a major Brazilian beer company is on the table....first all the write downs have to be completed ( not many left) andsome layoff have to be done.....
Nice pop for this stock. Nice volume also........? Good news comming ?
"Buffet likes big Dividend Stocks LIKE ATT (T) Paying about 6.50%.Doesn't Like KHC Anymore, NOT BUYING ANY MORE OF KHC He is Saying."
This was a $97 a share stock just 2 years ago to the day....
"The problem with KHC (and its not going away) is they SOMEHOW missed consumer preferences toward all natural, less processed, healthy food. How this happened is anyone's guess but to change now is going to mean huge investment with cash flow they do not have. The ship is going down fast."
Maybe a good multi year hold. I bought at 27.
"Too many uncertainties, shaky investors are jumping ship. It will dip and then go up once positive news arrives."
"Folks this company sells $26,500,000,000 a year in food. At these bargain prices it’s a steal. But before Monday’s Buffet effect. "
nine month consolidation...looks good
"Get ready hot off the presses , Call buyers are forecasting a big press release for KHC this week. Place your bets they sure did."
I am a nobody on this board but I can see a buyout.
"People posting fake news about Buffett getting out. Here's what the annual letter actually says:Below we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value. We excludeour Kraft Heinz holding – 325,442,152 shares – because Berkshire is part of a control group and therefore mustaccount for this investment on the “equity” method. On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinz holding ata GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire’s share of the audited net worth of Kraft Heinzat December 31, 2019. Please note, though, that the market value of our shares on that date was only $10.5 billion."
What's more common: the planets align or KHC closes in the green
"WOW ! Cramer Negative AGAIN !Picks Require HomeworkThe key to picking individual stocks is being able to tell a great company from a bad one. All it takes is a little homework.In the packaged foods space, both Mondelez and Kraft Heinz were similarly valued this time last year. Mondelez had a marketcap of $58 billion while Kraft was valued at $52 billion. Since then however, Mondelez has gained 21%, while Kraft has plunged 46%.On the surface, both of these companies appear identical. They sell similar products into the same markets and have similar costs. Both companies also make acquisitions to grow and then cut costs to improve their bottom lines. The difference however, is in the execution.Cramer said Kraft uses a mallet when it cuts costs, but Mondelez cuts with a scalpel and uses surgical precision. So while Mondelez has seen its sales stay essentially flat as it divests businesses to move into more lucrative ones, Kraft has been forced to take write downs and slash its dividend.Cramer was still a fan of Mondelez, but told investors to steer clear of Kraft Heinz."
"Oscar Mayer Where is the MEAT , Where is the MEAT , Where is the Oscar Mayer MEAT. all stores are now out where I live , No bacon, No lunch meat , No Cheese, No Mayo, Some Heinz and Jello Nothing in the freezers at all. KHC could do a game to find WHERES the MEAT."

KHC make stock market great again
"BOYS.....BUFFETT AINT LETTIN KHC FAIL.....PERIOD. NOW....READ AND LEARN. THEY WILL SELL OFF APPROX 25% OF THE LEAST PROFITABLE BRANDS, AND WILL BUY AN UP AND COMER!!!! WHAT MOST OF YOU DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND SHELF SPACE THAT KHC COMMANDS PUTS THEM IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE THAN ANY OF THE UP AND COMERS. PLUS...BELIEVE ME. BUFFETT WILL PUSH FOR TOP QUALITY EXECUTIVES TO GET IT DONE. HIS REPUTATION IS RIDING ON IT AND AT THIS POINT IN HIS LIFE THATS ALL THAT MATTERS. KHC OVER THE NEXT 3 YEARS IS A DOUBLE AND THE 5% DIVIDEND IS SAFE......BANK IT !!!!!"

Why it is up today
Hello khc looks like I’m going to join you guys for a possible break out. Buying some shares.

"BOYS....THE MORE I LOOK AT IT, THE MORE I BELIEVE BUFFETT TAKES KHC PRIVATE. BUFFETT HAS 100 BILLION TO PUT TO WORK. HE SAYS VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IS OVER PRICED. WITH NO DEBT KHC WOULD REAP BIG TIME BENEFITS AND BUFFETT MAKES A KILLING OFF HIS INVESTMENT VERSUS TRYING TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE....OVER PRICED !!! KHC WITH BUFFETTS MONEY, WOULD BE A HUGE RETURN AND GOING PRIVATE TAKES THE SEC OUT OF THE GAME.....WHICH IS ALWAYS A BONUS !!!"
"woke up today and i said "" i hate khc, M, six and now aapl."" can't stand them."
BUFFET IS HOLDING HIS POSITION. So should you. These are lying cheating shorts on this board who are claiming he said things he did not.
Bought a small position at 32$. Wasnt wanting to bank much money on this but its almost to the point of being ridiculously oversold. May have to pick up some more
"I went to Walmart , trying to buy Draft stuff, lots of people carry Karft products. I bought peanut butter and happy to know the products are flying off the shelf"
Great stable yield bottom in from March. What's not to like?
"I also don't understand how this stock isn't 26+ considering how they are handling this crisis. They are in every home again. They have a great dividend. They can easily handle their dept. They have new management and they have (hopefully) learned from their past sins. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way to end the day down. For no specific reason."
Here we go again! Release earning already!
"Do not follow just buffet. He is like you and me and invested years back. His luck at that time was good. People say when you have luck with whatever you touch becomes gold. As far as that guy, he is very good human being but he has to learn new techniques. He still uses his old banana peeling strategies which will not work in modern world. I feel sorry if you put your money by following him.Gl"
Have they announced 50% divy cut yet.

The overzealous shorts will get pulverized today and the weeks moving forward!
don't see any Kirkland ketchup or cream cheese..sell off some of these lessor brands and pay down debt and circle the wagons around the solid products
i bought 500 shares two weeks ago at $77.25. Warren buffet hold 25 % of the stock.What will be the 12 moth price from here ?
"they have to beat top and bottom but if they miss the growth numbers,. its alllllllllll over baby. FACT. guide down. DONE. revenues come in light question paying a hugh amount of their income on a dividend. dont forget, im not the only one buying the same items KHC sells at 1/3 or 1/2 off everyday at walmart. there is serious competition and the stuff is very good."
crazy over reaction..looks not bad to me..get on with asset.sales.and debt paydown
A momentary feel good day maybe. There are still the reality’s of debt and long term growth with questionable profits. I like to live in the real world and not some feel good moment from an investment bank worried about their money.
Etrade just lowered margin requirements on this one by 50%...best believe its gonna soar
This is the peoples brand all over the world. This will go up again.
SHORTS NEED TO COVER BEFORE THEY GET BURNED FURTHER. BUFFET BUYING THE REST OF THE COMPANY

"BRK jumped and 1/3 of jump er was owed to KHC. BRK has been busy buying all the way to 24's (as we did for fam trusts). and you sat back in your cozy neuron taxed commoner forum indicating 5 was coming. you could have earned another MBA tuition for your kids or grandkids. but no, posting comments was the way to go. and, those here who actually have an account with a few beans in it, sold their KHC as soon as it managed 30. genius. post more comments and report the already released KHC news. you're big on that too. except for that one guy who cites nutrition facts: he don't count as he is voting for Pete. hey, why don't you join him in voting for pete. that's adorable."

Lol Reuters posts a negative article hours before earnings. They want cheap shares in premarket
Am I the only one sad to see our wonderful tasty cheese products go?
shorts coming in after horrible earnings. dead product. sub $10 per share eventually.
Time to buy writedown fully priced in dividend cut priced in by over sold by $5 billion
To the moon we go . Ketchup high !
"Roy G Biv.... I am not lying, currently down around $2.45 since I have been averaging down. It’s my style. KHC will be at $39 - $42 soon. Mark this post."
compair GE fall use those % for your risk
innovation new products new ceo if you look at a few other companies that change ceo created new products they are much higher and hitting younger generations
no one can pick bottoms ..eventually numbers will hold try and don't lie..they make 26 bil and pay down some debt and sooner or later value will come to stock
will close 35.20
The math still indicates this is a $40-$42 stock next year based on the estimated earnings. I bought in at $28 a few months back when the market was punishing the price for the write down...It’s still be punished for a one time write down...It will continue to slowly move up especially after year end profit taking ...next financial results will get thing moving upward
good..buy cheaper..today is dividend reinvestment day
I am a buyer at 50. This will then yield 5% which looks good to me at that point.
"As long as eps and divided is ok, buffet will not be worried"
I cant see why people are buying much organic foods. I think more people are just buying generic foods. Anyway it looks like they are not buying brand name foods like before. Most brand name food cos. are doing poorly. They should all go private to spare the pain to shareholders.
Will people eat as much Ketchup in recession as they did in good times?
Folks buy before King Buffet talks on Monday... it will recover $4 to $5 bucks on Monday.
well their goes a year of dividends
KHC is like the GE of food stocks
"great, let it fall. I will get it cheap."
The time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets.
almost zero free cash flow - dividend will be cut again. I have to admit I did a poor DD here. Poor old fashioned brands that havnt been invested in since 2014. Slashing costs & raising prices is not something that works nowadays.
BUFFET WILL BE UNLOADING SHARES AT THE OPEN

"Does anyone know the test for brand write downs? Is it by segment, product type, geographical area? The performance is amazing, but they are writing down. I don’t get it? Sales are up 6%, gross profit is up 7%, adjusted EBITDA is up 12%. Everything in the metrics is great news. Yum confused how brands are written down with all these positive performance indicators. Can anyone explain this?"
BOYS.......BUFFETT IS BUYIN....BIG TIME !!!!
no news I can find..obviously big selling
Told you to buy. Don’t be late to the party
"In reading KHC price/book valuation, someone should remind management to remind fund managers what a steal this company is based on this metric alone. If and when Wall Street decides to quit beating up on this company and give it a price/book value of 1.5 (very reasonable) for a company that owns half the aisles in most grocery chains, Walmart and Target included, the price would reflect a company that will be around for many more decades."
"Don’t worry, it is way undervalued"
Got out today at 32.14. Enjoyed the forum(except webr and urmoney). Many get back in after tax loss selling occurs. Good luck to all longs and may all shorts get burned.
Hehe ready to buy more if the downtrend makes it possible today. What a timing !
"Baron, come back to the MO board. KHC is for old dinosaurs like Warren Buffett."
"Where I live, you can now buy 10 bottles of ketchup for the price of one share of KHC stock. I think buffet should incorporate this new bottle per share metric into his valuation analyses. I like an entry point of 7 bottles or less."
Why was buffett so wrong about this stock pick? It is very unlike him.
when is earnings date. I have heard various dates but thought it was tonight.
At a price of 28.41 Argus has a pe on KHC of 8.39. No wonder insiders are buying hand over fist. Btw already I like what management is doing teaming up with Baileys!!! very smart.
"Jim Crammer made a good point, KHC needs to update themselves, disrupt and innovate. Otherwise they die on the vine stuck in the 1980's brand names that the younger generations could care less about."

anyone hear anything yet? I cant find a peep
Thank you Mr. Market!
buy when there is ketchup in this streets
Only certainty is that once the price gets cheap enough 3g takes it private. It’s the way they roll
Unilever shareholders dodged a bullet
"This company looks to be sinking slowly into the background. Everytime I visit a UK supermarket now, and I mean Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Aldi, Lidl there is less and less space assigned to Heinz products and even less for Kraft. The reason is simple, Heinz and Kraft products are anywhere up to 4 times the price compared to own brand which to be honest taste very little differently. A bottle of Heinz ketchup in Lidl is £1.99 yet the Batts brand supported by Lidl is as good to taste and costs 47p.The importance of the brand is shrinking and the consumer knows this now and vote with their wallet."
Ruh Roh you shorts - looks like the China trade deal will happen next week and tariffs lifted on farm and food products. Ketchup market growth at 7% and China is liking our fast processed food meals. We may be back to 7 billion EBITDA before YE.

Buying opportunity for a long term hold. Keep dropping!
"Several days ago, I had my first taste of Heinz' Mayochup, which was recently introduced in my country of Israel. I dipped my schnitzel, on top of which was melted cheese, into the acclaimed condiment. what followed was a deep spiritual experience of flavor. i felt like the mouse in Ratatouille. It was a flavor sensation the likes of which I had never felt before. far superior to the uncomfortable process of manually mixing the 2 ingredients. as a direct result of this, I have sold my entire portfolio of stocks, my house, and all of my wordly possession besides the phone with which I am currently typing this, and the clothes which I am wearing. The resulting funds were all used to purchase shares of Kraft Heinz. i am currently sitting on a cold street corner, along with my wife and 2 daughters, waiting for the inevitable appreciation in the value of this company's shares. Wish me luck."
"I like going up when all indexes are heading down, especially today now we're above my average price. I wish the same to all longs here"
"Miguel Patricio commented that the cheese unit was sold at 12 earning multiple and was under performing. This leads imply that the goodwill is being priced on multiples much higher, which further leads to imply that operations are supporting higher multiples. YET KHC continues to trade at 7.0 adjusted multiple (adjusted for GW-non cash). Sounds like the sale is very accretive to NAV. Well done!"
still cheap..I'm a buyer
Recession proof stock
An 11 percent drop in market cap isn’t justified considering the news. This is a good short term play
all the haters are amusing..adding today
"Amazing results. Price will recover much sooner than expected. The new leadership team of the company is the best. Once again, it shows that Warren knows people very well and always made the best choice."
All these legal actions are just to shake the little investor out of Kraft Heinz Company stockso the money people can buy cheap and make a killing. This is an old trick that has been done many times before. All the past recessions have been started by big money to forcesmall investors out of the market. Then those that caused the recession buy in on thecheap.
Doesn’t matter what the market does. $35 to $40/share is the same no matter where the S&P is that day.

"Haha the 6months chart shows a typical dividend stock which does not move in any direction. In the long run I’m sure the goodwill Heinz built will reestablish a prominent position of KHC on the international market with increasing markets and eventually a rising SP with stable dividend. They must unload a lot of that debt tho, in before the next crisis which will happen whenever"
Years of mismanagement has led to them being force to chop the company apart and sell it. They are selling one of only two edible products they make and the shills here act like its a good thing. They will be debt free in 10 years with nothing but ketchup to sell. Will hit 20s again long b4 it sees 40s.
KHC can still generate 3.6 billions free cash flow each year. It is a great money generating machine. 33 billions market cap making 3.6 billions with ability to grow again as the issues created by previous CEO cutting too deep can be resioved
Yahoo Headline …. JPM passed over for 1 billion KHC note purchase!! Funny how JPM bashes KHC days before it is announced that KHC used Goldman and everyone else except JPM in the 1 Billion note purchase deal. Does that not say it all how analyst's are liars and manipulators of the truth about stocks?
These guys better have a plan come investor day.
Very very undervalued.
ad's are filling forum. yahoo pushing premium membership hard.
Always buy low when a stock crashes and people panic. Always short when very high or 60% increase in a month. Try it and you will do well.
If recession hits! Most of the Midwest will be putting Heinz ketchup on Oscar hotdogs and making grilled cheese with American singles.
KHC reached a new 52 Week Low at 74.42
Wonder who bought that much . Just ordered a burger with tomatoes !
"3.3% rise in sales but an 8.9% rise in costs, excluding impairment losses, has pretty much taken all the steam out of this. If they suffer similar cost increases in the next quarter, the sales increases will account for little.Given the opening statement that the sales grew 3.3% despite negative impacts on currency and Indian beverage divestiture, you woud expect their sales and admin costs to start to fall not rise.Instead you have a big increase in cost of products sold from $3.948BN in March 2019 compared to March 2020 quarter at $4.299BN.Glad to get out of this at $30, despite the hope that it might have turned around -- maybe it hasn't - maybe UrM called it right. How's the short going UrM?"
"anyone know where I can buy some of that Kraft peanut butter on sale , have a mice problem and peanut butter really draws them in."
"Over 85% of KHC stock is owned by institutions. I think the number is a little over 1,400 institutions. One of them had started a massive sell off which created the massive drop in price. There was a lot of bad news in the 1st quarter I feel the write offs are going to make a good difference in earning in the 2nd or 3rd quarter. It is still a 40 cents dividend per share per quarter and a 40 billion dollar company."
can we get and hold 40?
ACTUAL HEADLINE.....Kraft Heinz is a hot mess and its stock could easily fall another 50%read it and weep longs....
Undervalued.
"Dividend currently around 4.25% just doesn't excite me with the amount of risk going forward, I see this moving at least another 10-15% lower from here"
"Bought another 1,000 shares on margin at $31.82... this is a screaming buy !!!"
"Mr. Hees, Kraft/Heinz has 33 different vice presidents each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, & I still can’t figure it out. One thing I do know, is that our share price was over $92.00 on May 1st 2017, & now, approximately one year later, it’s around $58.00 - The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated. I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them! The point is, ladies & gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, & captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Kraft/Heinz, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much."
Resistance at ~ 33.20
Trust me...Kraft is well distributed and a huge value to Amazon.
To increase profits for Warren Buffett Heinz ketchup will modify the formula
I bought soo much khc I don’t have enough buns
If buffet does decide to give KHC as low interest loan like someone below mentioned he is going to want the Dividend cut to basically nothing and then following his style he will loan them money for low cost call options that he could exercise later after the nose bleed of cash ends and make a lot of money. That's how he does business. He isn't going to be the bank of rescue if this thing going to yield 6 percent and burning cash like its being thrown into furnace daily.
got milk? dean foods files for bankruptcy. List healthier options as a reason for the decline in sales.waiting for got mac?
weekly chart looks very good...grind up to 34$ and things could get very interesting
"the dividend is the only thing holding this thing up. if dividend is cut, I am afraid I will lose more money. I hope the CEO realizes that. I think he needs to sell the Wienermobile first to raise money before considering other options."
"I eant to buy more khc. Already own 3 million usd khc, have 2 million cash to buy more.Basically Im going to all in for khc."
Hedge funds will soon buy in with big volume chat shows support near this level Manipulation always a factor
Should be a good day for Kraft. Defensive stock likes ugly day like today!
KHC is expected to go down further based on bad news coming out.
"Returned to Heinz ketchup, and boy did I stock up. Although I don’t eat their Mac n cheese I have a case of it downstairs."
I’ll bet it will trade positive by the end of day! $36.57 close
who says buying a food company is a good and safe/sound investment?Kraft Heinz’s 20% Stock Plunge Sees Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Lose $2.8 Billion
"I am in the process of potentially adding Kraft Heinz to my portfolio, but I have concerns. I looked up the entire Kraft Heinz portfolio and they have virtually no healthy or organic products. Where a lot of these products are reconcilable brands they really need lines like Annie's, Apple Gate Farms, Food for Life, Pacific Foods, Cascading Farms, Peet's Coffee etc... to start acquiring people who want to eat higher quality products. No way they are going to win the war with Velveeta, Kraft American Cheese and #$%$ Maxwell Coffee. Your thoughts?"
In at 34.54For Short trade.
"maybe they should buy back some stock that would help them cover the dividend more safely and support the price and usually i dont like buy backs, but they will buy it below book value."
Reddit crowd got ahold of KHC and has noticed how undervalued it is. This thing is about to start getting the attention it deserves.
"I did see my portfolio drop after this thing tanked a while back, but I just keep averaging down to bring my average price closer to current price. Currently it’s my only holding doing well over the past few days. Also it’s currently far below book value. This is on SALE. Also it’s BBQ season and Heinz products are everywhere."
Steady fall for day. Why?
Bought couple of days agoMay be too soon??Where is the bottom and not even a little bounce..
"shorts this morning trying again to sell a few shares cheap to bring down price at open. Kraft is pumping out the goods , next earnings will be higher."
Broke 30 on a bad slide down in 3 days so thinking this might test low 20's before it finds a bottom. This was selling at 65 a year ago so not a bad risk irregardless of the negative dooms day BS
"Bought 1,000 shares Friday at the low. I hear WB will be on cnbc Monday morning and will, no doubt, say encouraging things about Kraft."
"KHC needs to pay down debt and build cash so it can make acquisitions and expand its business during the down turn. People have to eat, will carry on business as usual."
"I just wonder how many shares traded today by GS clients that came late to the party? All though volume is not off the charts, so maybe GS doesn't have a weight they did."
building long term position with periodic purchases to get good average price to hold long..they will fix this...but it will take a while..strong hands will make money over long term
"Reversal coming for stock!Numbers were not as exciting as anticipated. Stock had rallied from 23-31$/share. Time for adjustments to 28.50, maybe high 27’s. Best of luck!"
Looks like Wall Street has some good news on KHC we should get the release tomorrow or later this week. Just like the dividend news . It's something good just by what Wall Street insiders are doing
"Interesting Read....Business Insider ...Kate Taylor....28 Sep 2016 (Yes it's dated still interesting nonetheless)....THESE 10 COMPANIES CONTROL EVERYTHING YOU BUY (And she was referring to food ).....In no particular order:NestlePepsiCoGeneral MillsKellogg'sAssociated British FoodsMondelezMarsDanoneUnilever Coca ColaWhile the world is indeed an ever changing place, and this was almost 3 years ago, I see no Kraft Heinz.Please research the article for your own interests. The portfolio of brands these companies own makes KHC look like a Mom and Pop operation (which it's unfortunately becoming)"
I would like to know also about earnings today.
"Very healthy consolidation after all, before rising up again. Many shorts will learn a lot on this case"
Look for Q1 and then Q2 earnings to come out and for them to have to raise Q3 earnings. Easy because it's summer time.
KHC is holding off earnings to wipe out the short sellers. $55 or more soon!
should I buy some shares and hope for a quick pop. put a stop loss on what I purchase or not even bother with this I'm new to stocks and thought this may be a good opportunity to make a quick buck.
Waiting for a jump after earnings to finally sell all of my khc... i really can’t see where the value would come from in the next 5 years. Plus the divy is not safe imho. Opinions welcome

A Bagholder No Longer ! I'm Out @33.04Whewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww !
Sold 90% of my position two days ago based on the chart action I follow. Added to my put position this afternoon at $47.5 for the Mar 19 expiration. I will cash out tomorrow morning. Also bought back a few shares in afterhours. The stock now pays 4%+ on a post dividend cut. May get some more selling tomorrow just like folks saw today with CVS but unless something else comes out the selling should slowly dry up......
Wait till the SEC announces no wrong doing(hopefully) on KHCs part. We'll get another $1/share at least.
I'm riding this Baby to Zero. My investing strategy is ride 'em from sky high all the way down to Zero. As an investor I am frozen in in-action and ride everything in to the ground until I'm wiped out.
Happy I had my stop/loss in @45. You guys are going to get hosed today. Learn to invest and stop losing your money.
4 analysts have upgraded KHC in May! check the Yahoo Analyst section. Time to rock and roll. I guess that the Analysts firm have bought the shares at the lows. .
Bought today at this bargain price. I love 4% dividend. Will hold for life .
My weekend post tells the story; Book Vlaue $42 (after most of known write downs) ; current stock price $28 and going up .A major beer company with HQ in Brazilian could take a 10pct interest in MO. Smoked almonds and cheese go nicely with beer.
In a perfect world earnings will be released before 7/31 and will be acceptable. A plan for fixing the balance sheet and product lines will be offered along with debt pay down propositions and we will be back on our way to Anwar's prediction.
$35 for a stock paying a 40c dividend. Sounds pretty good to me. Next quarter the dividend will rise.

(In addition to his salary).Yes, in the corporate world Thats nothing.

"The one major think to look at is KHC will always have a major bank for anything they need to do. How just look at the biggest investor and the Bank of Warren. So KHC will always have away to finance . If push comes to shove . Just the facts and how the Bank of Warren Buffett works , so if your betting against Warren Buffett you will lose in the long run."
"KHC is one of those that will feel more than heat when correction shows up. we hold KHC indirectly with our large holds BRK B. not saying one way, or another, be mindful the last drop to twenty was swift. that was principal issue. KHC lost its footing quickly, and continued down. you know what you're doing."
"CNBC Options Action's Carter Worth and Mike Khouw recommended on June 19 a bullish options trade in Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC). Based on Worth's bullish technical view, Khouw sold the August $32.50 put for $1.90.Since then the stock traded a bit lower and it is trading close to the strike at which Khouw sold the put. If the stock closes below $32.50 at the August expiration, he is going to have to own the stock at $32.50, but his effective price would be $30.60, since he collected $1.90 of premium. Khouw is comfortable owning the stock at that price and he is going to stay in the position."

36 BILLION in DEBT. They will be gooing bankrupt in next couple years noone is eating there disguisting unnatural products anymore. Not even call it food . stock will fall below 15
I still didn't see 26 or lower that some pronosticator was projecting to happen earlier this week.
Just got paid! now for the stock to rally...
"Got my dividend this morning. Yes, it's a bummer they cut it, but I still got a nice dividend so I'm happy. Eat more mac and cheese people!!!"

OMG!!!!! Here comes 33
Looks like $25 may be the line in the sand.
"Campbell soup did not cut its dividend when it went through share ""adjustment"" recently. Their shares went up somewhat. But they came back down to the 52 week low. KHC cut its dividend 36 percent today. Not good. Bad."

"I like @Anonymous specious argument ""people must eat"". Yes, but there are plenty of companies filling the same market space. They don't have to eat KHC brands.People need an automobile...but they obviously didn't need an Oldsmobile, Packard or Studebaker, did they?"
Don’t forget...longs mean to hold for a long time. Sometimes years. Ignore the noise. KHC make a lot of money direct from operations. It is a dream company with solid products and an effective logistical delivery system for many small organic producers. Everybody just chill out !!!
"I keep seeing comments about Warren Buffett dumping KHC as well as Buying KHC. Logically, neither of these events will occur. He need not do anything. If he holds his current position the stock will be perceived as being a solid position and will rise over time by perception alone due to the one time write down and its effect on the P/E ratio for 2020...If he starts to reduce his position in KHC then it will show up on BKH filing and which will indicate he has lost faith in his investment...KHC and BKH both a slammed if he sells anything... Thus his best option appears to be “Take No Action”"
I’m waiting to see how low KHC will go before a reentry point. VFF on the verge of a breakout this week. Good luck to all!
Let's say goodbye to pessimists and hello to KHC to $31. Mute these paid pessimists with negative comments. I did.
Do you guys really think it has more room to go up

All analyst should be required to report to the sec if any company they have any kind of interest in is banking on a position or has taken a position. whereby releasing a report could in any way affect stock price. I think there is just way to much of this #$%$ going on behind the scenes.

Wow one decent qtr and ppl treat this like a growth stock lol. If this goes higher I will short it. Price increases on their products just made it easier for competitor brands to enter and compete in the package foods space. Watch khc lose more market share in 2020.

Look at the leadership of this company. It's a total joke.....and the board is responsible. You've got a bunch of 3G guys running the business with absolutely zero food industry experience. The CFO is just out of diapers. Buffett really needs to wake up here.....Cahill is a serious CEO with years in serious organization like Pepsi and the pre-acquisition Kraft. This is something to despair about.....this is something to act decisively on......change the leadership and protect the value of this iconic company and its iconic brands. Get this South American railroad executive out of the cockpit of what is primarily a US domestic food company! This guy Hees clearly does not know how to run a packaged foods business!
Who did that big buy ?? I am almost even
Nice plan!! The CEO knows what he is doing man
"it depends on what you expect. If you are ok with a dividend range between 4-6% yield it is great and quite sustainable. But if you are into price and expect higher returns, then is not that simple. And i am talking about the next year, For the next 5 years i dont see it offering lower than 10% yearly returns"
In a recession and tesla that sells low markup expensive cars that people can’t afford or don’t want can jump 10% with a PE over 1000 BUT..... khc that sells packaged foods rain or shine pulls in cash and pays a dividend can’t even gain 3% on a PE under 20???
KHC is not a ketchup company . It's a food company .
obviously some news is leaking..maybe sec finished..or earnings date set..something is out..can't keep secrets anymore with internet
I am doing my part. Asked for double mayo in my sandwich and in my soda.
"They need to mix catchup, mustard and mayo in one bottle! $$$"
"Don’t cut the dividend, cut upper level management."
CEO admitted kHc performance is poor and on downward trajectory.. couple years to turn around sales and marketing and 3-4years before financial profile shows a confirmed improvement. This being optimistic
"If you look at the market cap on this stock, it's a small-medium size company about the same size as General Mills which has a higher PE ratio. If it continues to hit their earnings then it could get a higher PE ratio, maybe or 16 or so. It's got fantastic brands so no reason for it not to rise."
Tadaaa earnings tomorrow naysayers. Happy now ?
What a beat 
"So, KHC lost in three days all 9% gain it made on Friday for no reason at all?"
"Tomorrow we will see another big Pop to possibly $34.50. Next week we will have a $2 to $3 share price increase, that will signal value investors are back averaging down."
I was really caught by surprise with yesterday's bad news but I think I will continue to hold Kraft Heinz's. But with a premarket drop of 20% I wonder if there may be a sudden attractiveness to acquire Kraft Heinz by someone else. in fact I wonder about the possibility of Mondelez buying them. One share of Mondelez for one share of Kraft Heinz would be a nice premium as of the premarket prices. Any thoughts?
WOW Looks like KHC is going out of business the way the stock is trading how soon before they cut the dividend or file bankruptcyyou would think it's any day they way the stock is trading.
18 people didnt like my comment last night and 3 did. Unfortunately some folks took a haircut today. I didnt. They kept the dividend which was surprising and the long awaited turnaround plan would come in May. Sales fell and another writedown of Maxwell house. The reaction by investors was swift. I cashed out of the hedge on the put side set up new ones at 27.50. Also added stock to my positions. There is a lot of anxiety and not surprising the stock is bouncing around like a Mexican jumping bean....no ethnic slam intended here. Might take a few trading days before the dust settles and we see if there is going to be a next move up or down..
"New 52 week finding newer lows. Still think KHC will rebound for longs that are invested for the future. Me, I just shave a few points when I can with 700 shares."
"I just saw 3 blocks of 50,000 pass by... folks someone big is very interested."
"I'm all in, 28.67 or bust, gla"
"With its latest decline, Kraft Heinz now trades for about 10 times projected 2019 earnings and yields 5.4%."
"Someone believes earnings at the end of this month are going to propel this stock upward, buying 13,139 Aug16 32.50 call options and paying $0.87. October 35s also being purchased with over 1000 contracts being traded today. Stock is beilng accumulated as it breaks above 50 day moving average and starts to bare down on 100 day moving average."
"Former CEO stopped advertising to save money and he destroyed the brand - in this age, you can't survive if you don't remind consumers of your brands constantly via TV/Internet advertising. I am surprised Buffett with a sizable stake in KFT would allow that to happen. KFT's problems are self-made - never hire private equity people as CEO of a brand consumer company."
kraft numbers .58 cents rev up too.
cant believe buffet would throw good money after bad...must be value play now for him to increase position now..good sign for sure
meh
there we go
Did we find the bottom yet?
"Kraft Heinz is a good reminder that just because a stock is falling doesn't mean it's a bargain. As my fellow Fool Leo Sun has noted, Patricio's former employer Anheuser-Busch InBev cut its dividend to pay down debt, a strategy the CEO might consider at his new job since Kraft Heinz spent more than 100% of its free cash flow on dividends.It's hard to say how much further Kraft Heinz will fall. But given the challenges the company faces, it seems unlikely the stock will be an outperformer anytime in the near future."
https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-KHC/
time for another merger
"Is Kraft Heinz on the way back? If so, this could be an excellent buy at this price. Any commentary appreciated. Happy Holiday Season All."
Read the news today about KHC being one of Buffet's worst investments. He still gets huge dividends each qtr. despite the cut but if he ever decides to pull the plug this stock is toast. Look what happened to the other stocks he sold off this year including some banks and airlines. The merger with Kraft and Heinze at the price they paid was way over the top. They bought too much debt and now they are trying to fix the leaky pipe. They need to make many more cuts to bring this stock back. The forward PE is getting better though.
"If it closes higher today , that would be a ""KEY REVERSAL"". Chartists will tell you that is very bullish, especially with high volume."
strong ahead of earnings..no more negative news would go a long way
"ostensibly the buybacks at 25 or less in the many millions of shares have not been accounted for on quarterly. these won't appear until next er. may not make any dif, but may impact the relevant div cut hot discussion currently going on, but not in this commoner forum"
"So BofA turned bullish, huh? $38 and a buy rating? What took them so long? Kraft Heinz is making a huge comeback!"
Please fire the ceo ASAP . I
CEO has to go! KHC needs a total shakeup of leadership. What they have been doing has clearly failed!
"poor volume in light of thursday this week and may 2, next week. wholesale vendor side still parked and now growing roots. am beginning to accept status quo and take our div and back off. should volume spike tomorrow as i thought it would, that's redemption. if not, you'll still have the hundred share long group that populates the forum to listen to. at this point, urmoney, who doesn't have much more than his simple 2X4 abode for world equity makes more sense. as i said, here and other one, perhaps BRK meetup sat gives KHC some love remarks wise. and, yes, i would welcome that to the tune of 000,000 up votes without going into detail."
My only regret is I don’t have more money sitting idle to put into this great American company.
"Where is BARON? That's right, he's holding his nads."
Buffet thinks in ten years this thing could make money. I guess he is going to take this to the grave.
I'm getting a BAD vibe about this stock
don't see any info out there for today's drop..obviously a big seller
When KHC underperforms earnings longs can be quiet and stop posting here. Forever. Those are the rules!
How do you guys think this stock will react to a recession?
should be nice recovery over the week
"As of 09/28/2019 there is still $35.826 billion in Goodwill on the books and $43.394 billion of intangible assets for a total of $79.220 billion out of $102.822 billion in total assets. How much is the Kraft brand name worth above the cost to duplicate the means to produce the ketchup? How much of that $79 billion does it cost in advertising to convince consumers that your new brand of ketchup tastes better?Goodwill and intangible assets are where G3 hid the excess price paid on the balance sheet.Asset write downs of $15 billion or so can be taken five more times before phantom assets are off the balance sheet. When, or will, the other shoe drop?"
All the early morning automatic sales order will be done in about and hour. Better load up because it will touch 35 today
when the sweet dividend will be distribute.
Still so many people so negatives. Doom and Gloom..
"Let's look at a couple KHC products. Velvetta is of poor quality and a cheap highly processed product. Heinz 57 with high fructose corn syrup, soybean oil, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate is not healthy and quite frankly shocking. I could go on and on about their cheap and chemically filled ingredients. They almost produce nothing with organically made foods. Organic means free of pesticides, herbicides and synthicides. The millennials do not want their overpriced garbage products."
Kraft Heinz reached a 52 Week high at 34.34
Problem is people don't eat toxic foods like Kraft Heinz much anymore. It's old school and bad for you.
Miguel has an excellent track record.$55 Soon!
Just bought another 1 million usd khc today! Happy
"Okay, just need to be patient and we will be set. that 25% upside will happen."
oh look Barron's is back up up up
Who is waiting for 25 still? lol
$56 soon
$55 soon Guarantee!!!
I do wish the company would provide some guidance
Bond rating agencies are always late. Sign we are close to a bottom. So much bad news priced in. We will see.
interesting move today..see if it follows thru
"Buy on the incredible turnaround. Sales dip is ok, divi is safe."
where are all the doom and gloomers that talkes so big about the dividend going away..the dividend is rock solid and they went away
moscow mitch luvs the blue box to match his blue b@lz
"they sell nothing that is not loaded with sugar, salt and fat."
32.50$ next number to close over..then 35$ with volume...could take some period of months
The bottom line imho is you can't trust management. Buffett no longer on the board. His cost basis is around 30.
Does anyone have any idea when this bleeding is going to stop?
If SEC probe favorable and earning just in line the upgrades will come. Uncertainty is the enemy now.
To the moon! Wish I would’ve bought more!
"Now how the new management spends money is scaring. Yes they are 100% making huge effort right now, but toward the opposite direction."
"Need to cut dividend from 1.60 to 1$ no more preferred dividends at 9% for Warren the pig, he can get paid what everyone else gets. need to pay down debt"
"Cramer says another dividend cut in the works.Excellent, I hate having a lot of money."
I'm a buyer at 32
"Buffet loved this for over $100 Billion dollars. He still thinks it is a great Company. If you own a stock you love for over double the price and are a long term holder, what do you do when its bottom drops out like KHC did last week? You buy more and average down in price so you can eventually get out. I believe that Berkshire is very likely going to be a big buyer of this stock at $34-$38 level. That is how I see this stock making a bottom and starting to fill in the gap in the near term."
I think it will go to $34 today.
Shares strong in the gap..no fade near 1 year highs..strong..looks like it will close the gap on next good news $48..good quarter or debt repayment or dividend increase should do the trick
"as i stated: if you must own KHC, hold brk b. when i told you to buy wmt, you did, or didn't. you should have. it's not a buy now. wait. turning to ppc. watch that one and jump at 16. doubt it reaches 15, but it could. ""virus"" news is so flaky, like dems, you can't trust ""virus"" news."
IMHO Maxwell House brand is worth a lot more than the 1-2 billion value placed on it by Barrons article. very underestimated. typical for all business articles related to KHC these days. Analysts and Business media people are like sharks circling for a kill on a wounded whale. So typical and pathetic.

"I think KHC is switching from a very long term down cycle and it's just at the beginning of a new long term up cycle. Any sell offs should now be purchased . You can see on the 5 year MACD weekly chart has now started it's up cycle and the multi year MACD monthly chart is just about ready to turn , up to you what you want to do. KHC will not be a rocket higher but will move higher over a many year time frame. But that's from the old days , With the new AI computer things now seem to move at the speed of light . LOL"
i just found out Buffett started buying geico at 60 and it fell to 2 and he bought it out and it working out good so far . so not sure what ppl talking about Buffett. but its not his first rodeo
"This stock is going to fly. Here in the UK all if the Heinz products sell out in minutes. Shelves in all major supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury, Morrison, Asda are completely sold out"
"The sum of the parts far exceeds the value of the whole at KHC. The company still has a stable full of iconic brands. If Planters is worth over $3 billion, what's the value of Oscar Meyer or Kraft cheese on and on.They could sell the company piecemeal and end up with more than than their current market cap which undervalues the individual assets..imo"
In a chaotic world kHc is quietly stable stock with nice dividends
Given that they gave a percentage to covid-19 charities and still beat expectations? Amazing
3G trimming. Sold 20 million shares at price of 59.85.
Gotta feeling that KHC will be $45 by year end.
"It's going to $40 within the next 12 months. Dividend seems safe and one of the highest in the food category. Just went through stock purgatory; a lot of stocks have done this and then had large periods of expansion afterwards in stock price when 'risky' suddenly becomes much less so. Debt is slowly being addressed and the new management team is experienced, young and creative. JPM and others have upgraded their outlooks. Not a gem of a company, but lots of upside at the current price."
Regarding the JPM downgrade. JPM has always felt scorned by the fact that Warren Buffet prefers to use Goldman Sachs vs JPM in their business transactions so it is not unusual to see JPM take shots at a Warren Buffet owned stock like KHC. If anyone sold they should buy back quickly before it is back above 39.00 a share soon because the JPM affect will be very short lived. IMO

"Hello my friend. I have a stock for you. It has a mountain of debt that cannot be paid off for many many, many, many years. No growth. And its sales from last year have been cut in half. Ooh and its competition sells a similar product at more than half the price. What do you say my friend?"
"Needs some positive news , in order to go higher , only bs . news so far."
Buffett first bought Heinz. Near 70.00 PPS. Currently owns 27 percent. Today he is down 4.3 babaBillion in KHC! Wow. Some people never learn. Buffett is in Denial It's time to retire
"I was reading this article about beyond meat and it mentioned the competition. I was surprised to see that Kraft Hines is also a competitor , below the cut and paste from the article mentioning KHC.CompetitionThe firm grabbed roughly 2% of the alternative meat market in 2018, according to research firm Euromonitor. And meat alternatives currently account for around 5% of the total meat market. Meanwhile, Kellogg-owned MorningStar Farms captured the largest market share at 17%, with Kraft Heinz’s KHC Boca brand at roughly 4% last year."
Buffet is taking it private at $45 a share. sell off brands they don't want.

"With a debt-to-equity ratio of 48.60%, KHC can be considered as an above-average leveraged company. This isn't uncommon for large companies because interest payments on debt are tax deductible, meaning debt can be a cheaper source of capital than equity."
"free forums: Jefferies Downgraded khc to Hold, from Buy. what you read in these free forums is useless because the forlorn and lonely have no accounts and small solvency. commenters are mostly tucked away in their small abodes somewhere hoping to engage some random real account holder with a life. when they're invited out, they hide off. as to KHC pricing, it's argued that holding 30.50, means all ratings firms on board for 34.60. these are what is termed ""standardized opinions."""

Executive turnover at Kraft Heinz continues as chief marketing officer departs - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/04/kraft-heinz-chief-marketing-officer-departs.html
"Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio), the co-CEO of Markel Corp. (NYSE:MKL), disclosed last week that he established two new holdings during the third quarter: The Kraft Heinz Co. (NASDAQ:KHC) and Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN.B)."
Ex-dividend today
"A 5% dividend cut wouldn't chase me out of this investment if announced... Good grief, we are getting 5.6% now. So, 5% off of that wouldn't be dramatic.."
why is khc down big time premarket?
"KHC final days of trading below $33 are coming to an end any time now, debt pay downs along with expense reductions and China tariffs going away will move this upward."
Bought yesterday at $33 will sell at $40. That’s a 50% retracement Fromm drop at $48.
added a lil under 37 and grabbed a bunch of calls to (hopefully) pay for them
Excited about earnings..could be a huge quarter
"The Company currently expects to file its Quarterly Report for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019.Part of the press release .

payday tomorrow people ----.40 cents per share
"No divident cut, beat earnings. Just good news to me. If the price go down, i'll buy more khc stock with my next divident payout"
This is an easy one for me. Warren Buffett should buy the company. They could manage it so much better. There has already been the huge haircut and they could immediately add value to the company. They could buy it for around $50 to $60 billion and they have the $118 billion to do it. Why not?
why the pop after hours?
$33 billion in debt and only $1.4 billion in cash??????? Not good!!! Cuts dividend and the Conference Call was Very BAD!! This is a nightmare.
"they are ""managing the write downs""..when they are done they will run it back up with other similar tricks...probably split the companies again and issue shares in both like before...buy in low and hang tight..eventually the value will be squessed out one way or another"
Warren will likely allow khc 2020 to turnaround. If they’re unsuccessful he will divest some or all. I expect them to be unsuccessful... if you want to buy probably don’t buy here and now
Back to green since before covid19 .. looking super good longs!!!!!
told you these are Buffets puts at work
The virus is saving food companies and supermarkets.
Inordinate upside volume and green means this is the low
"Im so smart. Here is my post from 3 months ago and it was dead on. I expect lots of thumbs up for helping you guys out. Looking to jump in soon for a run up to earnings but I will sell before. They once again need to beat by .05 or more (.88 vs .83 expected) or this stays under 60. Any miss will send it to lower 50s. ""Earning were .98 in qtr 2 last year. Thats why I said earning est are lower than ACTUAL earnings last year. If they do in fact make .94 this year then they are not growing they are in fact contracting. They will need to beat by 0.05 or more and yes its possible they can. Still with a PE this high even making 1.00/s might not be enough to keep this from dropping well below 60 again."""

I just feel all these companies have fat and lazy management now (after much success) and will continue to fade unless new management is brought in. But solid brand name, solid products and solid history. No fundamental issues. T (AT&T) is another stock. But that deserves a separate discussion. I own all of the above stock today.

Smart money will take this for a upward ride!!! why????????? Because they stand to do very well financially
How high does the dividend need to be before the dividend investors start to buy? 7%? that puts this around $23
Agonizing sell offs almost every morning only to recover toward mid day and close. what's up with this?
"2/8/20, 07:58 AMCompared to an average industry price book ratio of 1.30, $KHC is valued rather cheaply. chartmill.com/stock/quote/K..."

Get rich. Load up on KHC and CAG at fire sale prices. CAG will fix Pinnacle. Buffett not selling a single KHC share. 40 % gain this year.
please explain how long term debt rose from 20B to 30B since june 2017 and earnings declined....
I own 200 shares at under $28/. sure wish I had bitten off and even thousand shares. The dividend is nice too.
"Just took a position in KHC. Was thinking that perhaps the company should consider getting into the pet nutrition business? America loves its dogs and cats and having just got back from Europe, I see where Western Europeaons are getting as wacky about bringing their dogs everywhere as they are here. Given the expertise in the production of food, it would be a no-brainer for Kraft to set up shop for a pet food entry and hopefully goose domestic growth."
"We got a little beat up, but we are looking better today."
"Walmart has a store within 10 miles of 90% of the us population….kraft products all over the store….Walmart shoppers do not shop at whole foods, like Kramer and the NYC elites…they consume mac and cheese, hot dogs, bologna, bacon ect…do you really want to bet against Kraft and WB"
"If u bot this recently, u did better than Buffet, enough said."
Imagine getting in at 34 dollars a share what if it rebounds back to 55 down the line....
So what is the new dividend yield? Might become interesting to buy in now for the long term
Invest or sell?
They need to partner up with a cannabis company quickly lol
"BOYS...I TOLD YOU ALL AT 33 TO JUST SIT BACK AND WAIT. UNDER 31 IS VALUE. BUFFETT WILL TURN THIS AROUND...IF ITS THE LAST THING HE DOES.

Dividend will go back to 2.50 then those that buy today have a 7% div yahoo
nice come back after hrs. 2 cents

I was wrong...I loaded up at 48.55 just 200 shares tho....There is NO valid reason this should be under 53 bucks (we shall see that change by next month/feb2019) So, I thank you Lisa and I really dont see this sinking any lower then 48. Just way to valuable of a company here...Lots of room for growth and great dividend. Load up gang...load up :)"
Buffett waits for companies like 3G to make amateur mistakes like cutting to the bone and diminishing the quality of people and products. Buffett recognizes this is a correctable blunder like when Coca Cola initiated “new coke” and the shares plummeted. Amazing how value investing techniques are lost with each new generation.
A cut in the dividend to about 1.20 would not bother me a bit as long as they were forced to pay down deb with it.
"I had bought 5k shares at 26 few days ago. Hopefully, KHC will prove me right and make me look good to the wifey"
I am of the conviction seventy before Labor day
￼￼￼￼I think They’re going to have a surge in earnings report on 30 th of April￼. ￼America is not going to￼￼ get over the pandemic for the next several quarters￼ and will be buying the comfort foods for awhile They are going to be￼ showing VG earnings This has the potential￼ To be in the $40 - $50 range￼￼
"Someone (probably institutional investor) bought twice each time 908,664 shares of KHC at 15:00:00  and for the price of $34.23"
$42 and I'm even. Hope to see it by mid year.
I love these boring stocks. Can't beat the divies. Been holding since '09.
"Are we out of cash yet? ""Kraft Heinz is running out of cash: top analyst""No more ketchup?"

Earnings release will catch the shorts off guard. $55 Soon!
LSF (packaged foods) shot up to $45.00 today after a very profitable IPO surpassing a huge company like KHC. I always buy IPO's and cash out quick because they always come crashing down. BYND did the same thing but has since started to rebound. Remember SNAP. Same thing. No one cares about valuation so just play the game and take a quick one.
must be a lot of Ah in Vegas
slow and.boring 4%...a beautiful thing..stay under radar three more years please
just added at 29.85 to average down my original purchase of 32.20. love the dividend.
Back to 30
"Natalia, you were right on about Barron's."
KHC is up 4.91% to 57.65
Just bought a few shares. They might start making cannabis cheese or pudding. Lol
"Funny how talking heads push this nonsense about consumers switching to healthy and fresh food. A year ago nobody was eating canned foods, now Campbell and General Mills are hottest food stocks. Coke and Pepsi - producers of least healthy stuff - are at all time highs. Fake meat is a horrendous concoction yet popular. It’s all a lie, peddled to shake fools out of their stock positions, nothing more, nothing less."
Guess we will not see any real movement until 10/31.
When are they giving out the dividend?
@R. What is your agenda here exactly?
"U wanna know something KHC has going for it? The only thing u guys noticed is dividend and debt, that's what most if u focus on. But one thing: they can make a deal. When u go to wallmart and target they have like 6 shelf's that's all Mac and cheese. My point: they know how to talk a situation into benefitting them. A silver lining on the debt cloud."
"Berkshire Hathaway appointed the Brazilian Private Equity Guys to manage this company. KHC better figure out it's not about margin only on low cost foods, but more about ORGANIC foods, enough with the Sugar & Salt, OK."

Good luck to all longs of KHC. Sold at 61 Premarket because I got a little worried about the earnings report.
At the Rate This is Falling......It Will Take Folks A Long Time to 'KETCHUP'.HEE HEE HEE
"I'm AMAZED and SHOCKED to see KHC going down, down, down yet again. Why? No news, it goes down. Even on upgrades or positive news as a ""value stock"" it's going down. I've been holding this stock since March thinking that a company as iconic as Kraft/Heinz...with over 200 brands...and the power of Warren Buffett can't possibly go down more. And yet here we are, back to 30 a share. Why does it seem that no one really believes in this company. And why are they so slow with turning things around. For example, there is NO REASON they could not have developed a true Beyond Meat competitor in the past year. Even Trader Joe's came out with their own branded protein plant patties this week. But Kraft? They are missing the boat - and might I mention that Beyond Meat - a one product brand - as a market cap of nearly 1/4th of all KHC (at one point it was 1/3rd).I am getting ready to bail on this."
Just bought...
"Natalia, you picked a good time to double down, so far."
"The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Kraft HeinzIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Jorge Paulo Alberto Lemann bought US$100m worth of shares at a price of US$28.60 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$30.70 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Kraft Heinz insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months Kraft Heinz insiders were buying shares, but not selling"
"What annoys me is what the big boys do with the small investors on such stocks as KHC. They make it look like the price is going up, and the small guys throw in some money, believing that the bottom has been reached. What the boys have just done is that they create a new shorting plateau. They sell the stock short at the new price and then beat it down. Sell this stock. Sell it to those who are buying to cover. It is heading to $18/$19 soon."
For gods sake Buffett SAY SOMETHING. Inspire some freaking confidence.
"Berkshire Hathaway, rumored to be buying more KHC."
"Tone Loc said it best 30 years ago....""I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener..."""
big Berkshire meeting could influence khc stock price short term
Wall Street had to take KHC up before earnings to get out before it tanks when they cut the dividend
This stock has an insane amount of debt. sorry it is a good business that is shackled.. it cant grow until it pays down the debt 90% and this means cutting the dividend at least 75% from here. Better to do it and get it over with. let the stock go to low 20s. then it will find a bottom and paying off debt it will recover. but it would take 5 years to right this ship correctly. IMO.

"Despite suffering huge losses thanks to his investment in packaged food giant Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC), the value investor is steadfast in his long-term strategy, remaining less phased by short-term setbacks"
i hold KHC in my 401K. No tax write-off for selling. I would think the damage is done. Too late to sell. I am losing a small amount of money relative to size of my overall holdings. Not quite sure what to do with KHC at this point.
"SURPRISE, SURPRISE. another up day with limited buying of the company with the huge debt and zero growth post covid 19. very interesting."
"I always keep my stock and buying more when stock is down on ER. KHC is the first stock I sold with a big lose on ER in the last 2 years. Yes, I did exception since the style of releasing all of those bad news in 1 day is AWFUL. It means KHC management is in trouble. Look at 18 months chart of KHC, from Oct 2017 when it hit $90 it is down to $33 today, and never goes up in that time. Use simple logic or try to explain that - this stock is dying."
4.5% div is still not bad. I may get some at this price. Big guys will make it better.
Breaking! Form 4 disclosed. Jorge Paulo Lehman bought 3.5 million shares at 28ish for a little over 100 million dollars
"Other large companies in the consumer food industry have been making acquisitions of smaller companies that have gained market share as America’s tastes shift. INBEV has bought a number of craft breweries in order to recapture lost market share. Similarly, so too has Coca Cola, Pepsi, and so on. The fact that Kraft had not made the necessary changes that competitors had had been apparent even before today. Kraft has a disadvantage of starting late, and needing to play catch up. This task will not be easy nor expedite. The share price will continue to be subject to downward pressure until a plan with results give institutions reason to feel confident."

yikes. just bought it at 32.12. surely it can't go any lower. 
Kraft Heinz for ever I said it at 28 I’m saying 37
"Buffet buying this @ $80 is a no brainier. They own over 315 million shares. Multiply that by $33 for the difference of the price and $80. That directly comes off the price. Then they are saving billions from the dividend. Buffet, grab your elephant gun."
They need to cut the debt divest or downsize some of the weaker brand operations and acquire something big like boar’s head
Very vulnerable to a takeover at this price. The question is who.

Seeking Alpha predicates continuous growth from here. I think KHC will outperform. The management's single digit growth rate is very modest and conservative.
"Nice, I’m not betting on a pop tho, I’m betting a full recovery. And return to div growth!!"
The more it drops the more shares I can accumulate at a lower price while dividend yield rises. What a dilemma.
Looks good AH on high volume.$55soon!
"@Priscilla you think buffet really care about the stock price ? he only cares about the business. if the share drops to 10 , he will probably owns the whole company since the business still able to produce decent profit."
This company (KHC) has a total book value of about 50 billion (and market cap of 50B). Compare that to a bubble car company (who’s bulls keep saying “it’s not just a car company” LOL) which has a total book value of 22 billion (market cap 710B). I’m bullish on KHC for its value.
khc just paid for my DIS+ subscription and extra groceries at walmart later!!! thx
"Shorts are really risking their investment with khc. Think about it, buffet won’t sell his position and take a 50b loss for BRK.A. What he Can do and probably will do is buy the 30b debt from khc for preferred shares or at 4% rate. He will make money off the debt and the share price will double compensating him for his loss. Just a thought"
Better off buying KHC than UBER. Fact
Kraft Heinz: Warren Buffet Went Against His Own Advicehttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4346998-kraft-heinz-warren-buffet-went-against-own-advice
"MCD at $12 decades ago,, no one wanted it. it is at $200 all time high now. People want healthy food? Ask MCD. KHC will recover under new CEO. in 2 years KHC will be at $60. Will hit $100 in 10 years. Day traders want it to go private for quick buck. They listen to Cramer.Not me. I am a seller at $100 while collecting nice div."
i want 40!
be greedy when others are fearful!
Around 20-21 it will be a buy for me. :)
Chart looks very good finally...
"purportedly, new ""analyst"" ratings coming forward next two weeks. institutions that own KHC, and that represents 99% of KHC, never pay attention to digital media analysts. only retail gets thrilled by those statements."
"When you look back, you’ll regret of missing the Chance to escape at 26.7!"
"Stop removing my posts! Entry price is $30.83, with an annualized dividend yield of 5.19%. Keep an eye on this stock like a hawk, don't buy in too early!"
Why they didn't state proceeds will be used to pay down debt on the sale of Canadian cheese company is beyond me.
doubled my position in khc. Thanks to those who let me buy more shares at a $2 a share.
"@Stock Trader is dubious, Pay attention to him at your peril,"
I’m escaping from KHC is not bc of economic down term. I’m so worried about KHC declining sales and dropping market demand. The core business is so worrisome. The new management failed to make a turnaround!
Have a better chance making 20% in KHC than AMZN
LOOK FOR A BIG JUMP IN PRICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
36% divi cut. How they even pay this going forward will be remarkable. The product 'category' is just not in vogue now.People are using less and less of the products offered. This is just the 'beginning of the end'....SELL SELL SELL!
like it. I'm in below 30. if all else fails collect the dividend.
"Who else thinks the earnings report won't be all that you expect? They might have increased sales, but that was a temporary run on the business. They might cut the dividend also, wouldn't expect too much from earnings and we may drop again!"
"Warren Buffett would have taken the hit and sold this stock if it did not hold promise. Hold on all longs, this will pop when the company is back on the recovery path. Back to the 80’s in few years!"
Just bought more tomatoes
"i use KHC for options. it has no value as a hold to me. BRK B trades this the same way. dont waste your time with ratings and charts and technicals. that's what ratings companies are for and they do it far better than you. if you're spending time with charts, buy an etf or go to you tube and learn the next big thing."
For anyone that likes Warren Buffett stocks KHC is now the one to buy and is the safest. Why ha already been slaughtered and will have the most upside going forward. Warren Buffett stocks to still get slaughtered are AAPL and JPM why their crooked deeds are still to come to light. AAPL has not been paying QCOM so they will have to restate earnings. JPM it's only when they get slaughtered not if.
"Revenue seems fine, operations needs a total overhaul"
Sorry guys... I can no longer ride this down to a point it would take 2-3 years at best to break back even. Have to take the loss and whatever tax coverage I can get. Good luck to all that can weather this FED storm on our economy.
"There is no free cash flow at KHC without the sale of assets in 2019 -- the operational cash flow is insufficient to support the dividend and debt reduction.Without the sale of assets + $1,875M in investing section of cash flow statement.+ $420M (lumped in operational cash flow)Plus Hedging + $590MThese three items alone total + $2,885MThe declared free cash flow before the dividend payment would have been $1,144M + the Dividend of $1,953M = $3,097MTake off the asset sales and hedging and it would have been $3,097M - $2,885M = $212MThe diviend is almost completely uncovered from operational income.OK you can argue that part of this is debt reduction ($4,795M debt repaid - new debt issued of $2,967M = $1,828M net debt reduction.Even so the figures don't lie.Unless KHC can significantly increase its earnings, it can not afford to pay down debt and pay even this lower dividend without asset sales.The share price could well rise in the short term with the Covid sales boost, but is it sustainable?What has changed in the company that will justify significant sales increases?"
Just waiting to average down.
uffet confirmed he was selling
"How does this stock break through $35?Good company, common household products, a little high on debt but OK otherwise...making money, beating estimates, paying dividends.I hit this on the bullseye buying at $25, but kinda stalling..."

"Happy Anniversary Warren ! BUFFET Buys 1st KHC on V-DAY 2013 !What's Buffet Down Now on KHC ? 50 BILLION Or So (But Who's Counting )Kraft Heinz stock has nosedived almost 75% from its peak in February 2017, underscoring the magnitude of Buffett's mistake.The so-called ""Oracle of Omaha"" partnered with private-equity group 3G Capital to buy Heinz for about $28 billion on Valentine's Day in 2013. The pair then cofinanced Heinz's $50 billion mega-merger with Kraft Foods in 2015. Kraft-Heinz's market capitalization is currently less than $33 billion.YIKES ! LOL"
22% operating margins. A buyout here would see a return on investment every 5 years. This price is a gift. I loaded up after doing my DD. I posted this earlier seems my post was deleted. Buffet owns almost half the company.
credit suisse downgrades to $26 today; significant move. why?
Nice move on a down day.
hmmm looks like a good time to get in.
this drop will help us crack into the low 40s imho
Ok Mr buffet time to get involved and seek new management.
"Undervalued? Are you ppl being serious? We're talking 138X price over Earnings, and you think a 150yr-old ketchup company has more leg room to run? There is a reason why it crashed PRE - covid meltdown, and no reason it should be trading at higher levels now than it was. This Stock has gone up about all it can mustard. With the market bubble about to burst any moment now, KHC is in a real pickle for the rest of 2021."
"The turnaround plan is not only delayed and difficult to write, so the execution is even worse to fruition. Don’t complain anyone. They all work hard and put in tons of effort. It’s just the issuer of this new era when too many disruptors/competitors out there! Don’t get shocked everytime when KHC gets another leg-down."

"Can Warren Buffett buy out KHC , it is so cheap now."
"I am really shocked. I thought I was getting a bargain when I bought recently, because it had good dividend and share price was depressed. I was betting it was at its low. I expected it would take time to turn around, but I would collect dividend in mean time. Well, they cut the dividend. Not good. Of course I am sorry I made this purchase. live and learn."
will be green soon .
if this hits 25 i'm jumping all in on this ship the divy alone is by far worth the risk
"Stephan, yes of course. Buffet doesn't invest for the day or the short term. He invests for the long-term. Hard for the DT's and Shorty's to get their tiny minds around things like that."
what if price slides into the teens.. buffett using a stop out?
came so close to buying on Buffetts move. Can you imagine his pressure on this company but 0 improvement. Buffett really got snookered
Summer time is around the corner . People will bbq and buy Heinz sauce
going up from here

Are we finally set above 29.50$ ? If yes we're going straight back to the 30s
"30 Day rulethis is the last week to buy before those who sold after last terrible earnings release on Feb 22 are allowed to buy back sharesor face the wash rule.This stock therefore has a slight upward bias, can be a good tool for trading. Anytime you see it 1% or less down, buy it.trade it out intra-day or play it for a bigger bounce next week. I am pretty sure some funds will be buyers again (those that sold off on Feb 22 and beyond will all be buyers next week on 25 March, 26 March or 27th March."
I predict after khc is up 15$ or so they will upgrade it to market perform after missing 50% gain

"they never addressed their debt. I said. a couple years ago, along with many others. They needs to cut or suspend the dividend and aggressively pay down debt. the stock would go into teens and build back up to 30 over a year, then toward 50 over 3 or 4 years as dividend is improved, if they didn't I expected a 15 handle , nothing has been done to change this opinion."

KHC DIVIDEND GURUS:Today you lost a year and a half of those dividends you collect...when new CEO CUTS DIVIDEND then what?Wait 40 years for hot dogs and Kool Aid to come back en vouge?
while we say goodbye to W and pessimists let's say hello to $30 and goodbye to 20's.
wow! Nice increase (finally). What gives?
KHC doesn't make sense to me. I thing that the stock price should be significantly higher. The 2017 earnings were outrageously good and other numbers are good as well. This situation makes me very suspicious. What are we not being told that some people seem to know?
Keep in mind that at $35 they’re still valued at 2x revenue... for Mac n cheese and ketchup!
That subpoena is really cutting the cheese today!
hopefully everyone who was going to give up is out now..lots of volume on that last down run..maybe that was the capitulation..finally
Everybody waits to sell high=no chance guaranteed for you to escape26+ is much higher than teens.
Dividend will increase drastically tomorrow baring any dividend cut....will be nearing 6% but at extreme risk going forward.

"Patience, my friends...will head back up on Monday."
You must own this by Tues. to get the div. before ex date on the 25th. Big insider purchase at $30.38.
Waiting to get exdiv tomorrow. I figure if Buffet thought it was a good deal at $31+ might be worth picking up at $28
KHC is likely to raise the dividend soon
I’m in. When’s the next time I am going to have the opportunity to buy something for half of what Warren Buffet paid and stills likes.
If you want to make money you buy some shares of M today on the cheap . Goes ex dividend on Dec 12 2019 and it's pays of 10% for the year. or 2.5% for the Q and it makes more money than KHC and it trades for 1/2
Thanks Giving in a couple of weeks 1 million out of work . Pass the Mac and cheese please.
Food is still in vogue. Forget fancy products. People can only afford Kraft now. Addios expensive organic brands.
Thank you 10% trailing stop limit. Cashed me out yesterday at $30. I still think KHC can turn things around. I’ll buy back in at $24. GLTAL
BUFFETT...AINT SELLIN A SHARE....BANK IT!!!!
Bought some at the close at $29.06
Does anyone know when Patricio plans to unveil his big turnaround plan? It was originally Feb...then it was moved to May or June I think.
Urgent message for UrMoney
1 billion in free cash. Freed up another billion from cutting dividend = stable company. Buy this dividend play right now guys!!!
I would think a year from now KHC will be selling close to $40 nice dividend and a decent recession stock.
This stock is down > 30% compared to pre-earnings. How far further down?
Well that was easy to call. Taking the new 3.62 ttm earnings and going with a generous 12PE new target price is 43.44. This has a long way to drop. Do be fooled by after hours moves this is going under 50 in the next week.
What is KHC doing to safeguard Shareholder value. There seems to be absolutely nothing to suggest any attempt to stop the slide. Do long term investors just sit back and see their investment erode?
Signed up to (http://Rightpicker.com) last month and instantly saw why my trading buddy has been banking so many winners. She tried to fly under the radar but the secret is out. Join them today.
Mac and Chesse Time!
$56 soon.
Something interesting ---Boca veggie burgers (owned by Kraft) have a larger market share than Beyond Meat ---and I know that direct comparation of these two companies is not appropriate but my point is that KHC is not just sitting back and doing nothing to address the changes in consumer taste and preferences. Short term there is not much that you can do ---but long term they can deliver what people wanna buy and get back to growing again.
"how many of these ""conversations "" posting doom and gloom on this board? I muted bunch of them to read real posts.I see few on other board but not as many as here. Are they attacking stable and profitable?"

"Relax, this is a buy here at $35."
Let’s have a ketchup block party. Who’s in?
KHC needs a completely new brand portfolio. How did they get to this point of holding the absolute worst brands and products in supermarkets??
Why is GIS up more than this. Isn't this cheaper ?
Stock is down 56%. 6% Divy. Last time I went to any store large or small the shelves are packed with KHC name brand products and the investing world hates this stock...Time to start averaging in.
"@david I am 64 and I have not drank any coffee but Maxwell House for 20 years. My wife, and her whole family know nothing about good food, good beer, or coffee. They go to Starbucks because it is popular and she likes to waste money. I am a coffee expert! If you want to taste really bad coffee, buy some Folgers! I just bought my first 1,200 shares of KHC @34.89, on Friday at 3:57 PM. I know nothing about the Food business of investing. I am strictly and oil & gas guy. But I will take Original Roast Maxwell House over anything from Starbucks, including that Moron founder who thought he would run for President. They hate him because he is rich! I am one American who thinks we need more rich people, not less!"
People will always still have to eat a few months you will lookBack and say was I nuts for not buying ! Goes ex div next week also
WAY Oversold! Back over 50 within one month!!!
"Generic brands ? Did anyone bother to research who makes those? I can assure you Kroger and Walmart do not have food factories. The cheaper generic brands are still off label food items made by KHC and peers but are sold in bulk at a slightly discounted price which is then passed on to consumer. Bashers here need to do some research, unless all you eat is veggies and meat, YOU ARE STILL BUYING products from KHC and peers even tho you call them ‘generic’ or ‘store brands’."
Good time to have a mix of Div stocks like this right now to balance your risk a bit.

A lot of astute remarks regarding the unexpected downgrade by Goldman Sachs....It wasn't up to Goldman to decide for investors that the rally in Kraft had run its course and that the stock was worth 29. The collective market could have come to that conclusion in it's own time and space. Why Goldman decided to front run was wrong and I wouldn't be surprised that we've heard the last of this....
Thank GoodNess The DOW IS up 135 Today ?Other wise Where Would KHC BE !!!!LOL
"KHC is estimated to make around $0.55 is Quarter, but they are really going to beat by $0.20 cents. Most likely they will make $0.75 to $0.78 cents this quarter. Their sales skyrocketed in the last month of March."
I’ve been saying all along since the write down this was a 3-5 year turnaround..patience will pay off another 3.5 years
"Love it. Same pattern every day.... scare small investors to sell, then they buy it toward the end of the day to drive it up. Best way to grab stocks. Good luck."

Kraft CFO buying shares at $26.07http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/node/11786/html
WB did NOT recommend buying here.
Buffett is buying and will right this ship. My guess.
Actually THIS should be one of THE stocks to profit from corona crisis. $^DJI $BUD $KHC $KShelf-stable food!
@mikey - same analyst that had an outperform rating on KHC right before the last earnings release. Silence is golden mikey.
Insiders are buying hand over fist. IMO Buffett will never sell khc because he understands the business and can predict the intrinsic value of the company. Plus during a recession when it happens Food stocks hold up well.
I don’t like to see companies sell off their brands and leave their foot hold in some spaces. Idk why mgmt feels threatened by the debt.. its easily serviceable with interest rates where they are for next couple years. I hope they use this money to launch or acquire a new brand more appealing to current consumer taste and style
"Any good news, anything at all would be welcome !!!"
Will be up 3 days. Down 1 day. Up 3. Down 1 until $40. Steaks with Kraft honey bbq sauce.

This thing is about to explode come tomorrow! $$$
Green later today !
"Barrons 5/31/19: Kraft Heinz shares could be near a bottom after the latest downdraft. They trade for less than 10 times projected 2019 earnings of $2.79 a share and yield 5.9%. The stock, which once commanded a premium, now has the lowest price/earnings ratio among its peers. And its dividend—one of the highest in the sector—looks safe after it was cut to 40 cents a quarter from 62.5 cents in February. Its dividend payout ratio is below 60%, based on the 2019 consensus."
any one for some cheeziest mac n cheese bad products = bad stock price
"KHC is being bludgeoned by the consumer preferences they ignored for 20 years. Low fat was the first thing they ignored, then it was natural foods craze. They never updated their high fat products to accommodate consumer preferences. Now its a little late."
"The blood seems to keep flowing, my stop is set at 31.90 . And I’m worried it will trigger tomorrow."
Woo Hoo!
Buffett says he will continue to own this stock 5-10 years from now.........enough said.
Now Soros adds KHC and Mondelez....will they marry back after the separation? Lol
The PepsiCo results are a very clear picture of where an improved marketing effort will take this company.
Book value is over $45 per share
Company Has Many well recognized brands. Buy Company does not have the bandwidth and resources to grow them all.It make good sense to sell some brands while they still worth a lot of money.Wise move.
Really expected a bounce off the lows to close at $37ish. I guess still time but looks like my swing trade ain’t gonna work today. Oh well.
Going to be interesting to see how many analysts(except CS that is) say they knew KHC would go private. Always after the fact.
Maxwell got a buyer.$55 Soon!
Panic sell! Doesn't Buffet own 3/4 of this company?
"Meow, meow, the dead cat bounce is over."
I looked at the financials for the last 6 years. Nothing is wrong guys. It's just momentary. Revenue had been climbing slowed a bit in 2017. Nothing to worry about... except the debt.
The only dark spot or should I say red in my portfolio. May have to dump it for some tax benefits.
Loving these discounted prices! Loading the boat. Why would financial ANALysts downgrade a consumer staple like KHC after a major pandemic? Pretty sure part of their decision is to get more shares from it's reinvested dividend on Thursday... Next ER is going to be huge.
that's quite a turn around today..crashed on light volume early..and recovered to earnings report open....interesting swing
"Sold a year ago after the meltdown, dead money ever since."
Buying more . Money will rain long
"Time to sell Oscar Mayer to Hormel, Smithfield or Tyson"
Buffet will unload shares as soon as the market opens and the price will plummet to the TEENS! That’s when I will buy!!
"The Kraft Heinz Co's current price is $26.88. Its book value per share for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2019 was $42.32. Hence, today's PB Ratio of The Kraft Heinz Co is 0.64."
"BOOOOMMMMMMM, I knew it!!!!!!! Was 90 $, people got scared because earnings could decreased... The stock fell in the 54-60 range... Now Kraft increased earnings and revenue from last year... WOW! Cant wait to be back in the 90$ range!"
First the dividend will NOT BE CUT. Second the soy sauce market only is 12 billion dollars and Kraft is going after that! plus add other condiments. We have an 70% ketchup market share and a 68% Philly cream cheese market share and we will not be LOWERING PRICES on those products at the current level I see a good margin of safety.
Buy Kraft...large secure div and no downside here...
"Sell, Sell, and Sell."
down it will continue. this is a $25 stock now.
Still a joke of a company!
"With the moody's debt rating downgrade this morning, debt financing will get more expensive. This is another disaster waiting to go off for this company."
KHC will be fine. Great brands. Give it a few years.
"This is where 3G crushes the shorts, and we drive to $120 a share."
KHC is way oversold and ready to rally up.Americans are loyal to kraft Heinz products.....all over super market shelves.Buffett's must have loaded up more shares.
can't find any news yet..probably something in article over weekend
Is this the chance of a lifetime?
Actually.......Calm Down... Proceed Orderly to the EXITS....It's ONLY Down 2.3% Today....A GOOD DAY(Snicker)
ACCUMULATION NOW COMPLETED EXPECT BIG GAINS
Bottom has been officially established. See you at $45.
talk about a train wreck of a company
I believe we will grind into the $50’s and stay there for some long period..eventually it will return to $70’s..holding long term for dividends to roll over forever
As KHC products lose shelf space and market share you know why the pumpers here turn to insults immediately. They are underwater and scared. All you have to do it look in your grocery store. Once dominate brands are afterthoughts shoved to the side for cheaper and better selling/tasting brands.
Holding for that juicy kraft dividend.
Heinz has pricing power. Kraft doesn’t. Gotta split em up
I’m young and I’m buying khc . This is for a long hold ok
"I think best to hold for the long term. Anything else is the irrational exuberance of the day. If you bought in the low to mid 30’s just ignore the noice and enjoy the dividend. I own a lot of real estate and I assure you a going in return of 5 per cent on my money is an excellent deal provided there is upside. I earnestly believe that, long term, at a purchase price as aforementioned, KHC is an excellent “investment.” Everything elaebis just noise."
"Though I try to read every analyst report out there, this is one stock that is very mixed...It is great to read through some of your comments to help an early investor decide on going in on Kraft Heinz."
All good news turnaround in progress full steam ahead blowout quarter once again
Earnings are coming out people are getting on board while they can. It's going to be popping fireworks
Fair Value $60
Anyone adding with the restructuring or am I completely mad?
"Hold tight, get that div and wait patiently."
I’ve been saying for months $48 was the next level
"Do you think the dividend is safe? They do have quite a bit of debt, but it's still only a fraction of their total worth. 5.7% seems excessive to pay out in a dividend; I'm not complaining though."
why the sell off after the bell?
"CFRA MAINTAINS HOLD RECOMMENDATION ON SHARES OF THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY1:24 pm ET March 1, 2019 (CFRA) PrintOn 2/28/19, KHC filed an 8-K with the SEC noting that the company will not file its Form 10-K by the March 1st deadline. We suspect the reason may have to do with matters related to the SEC investigation into KHC's procurement practices, which has so far led to a $25M adjustment to increase cost of products sold. KHC did provide further information related to the $15.4B write-down to goodwill ($7.1B) and intangible assets ($8.3B). The goodwill write-down was related to five reporting units, most notably a $4.3B write-down in the U.S. Refrigerated unit. The intangible asset write-down was related to five brands, most notably Kraft (with a $4.1B write-down) and Oscar Meyer (with a $3.3B write-down). One key takeaway is that the U.S. Grocery reporting unit with $18.5B of goodwill currently has a fair value excess less than 10% of carrying value, leading us to think there could be additional material write-downs in the future. We maintain our Hold rating."
Earnings are already late and we have no way of know if they will ever come. How does this make sense? Get new accountants if the math is too hard for these guys. The public deserves to know what is going on. We better not find out that 3G sold another 20million shares.
I can't believe I could buy under 32$ today right before earnings. Just perfect
Great entry point here! 5% divident on top of it
Things that go down 40 bucks don’t rally 4. Just started to rally
it is easy to see this is moving up no matter what the rest of market does.
Someone(entity) does not want to let this get to and remain above $28. WHY?
"When this stock is capable of showing 13% increase, all possibilities are on deck"
Loving these buys !!!!
The recovery to the stock price over 95 is on track. Hugh increase in earnings
I'm one of the people waiting for this to get back to 29 to buy. I only tell you this because I don't believe it will ever get there. I think people like myself are late to the party. Good luck guys!
Up on no volume? This might drop back to 32.00. What you guys think?Disclosure: long on khc
"Been eyeing this stock sinking since $60. Haven't bought. Will if it keeps dropping to say, $30? Maybe."
Bought in at 31.75. Hope I made the right choice...
"why doesn't buffet take this private.this way he can pay $42/share or almost 27.5% premium on sharesbut he can make that up for not paying dividends any more for 5 years.All he has to do is buy the rest of what he does not own.At $42/share today, most will be willing to sell.I would then wait it out a few years and in the mean time get rid of underperforming brands and keep the better brands and repackage as a new Kraft Company. What do you all think?"
"So many shorts here...fascinating.....having watched CPG for years I am confident that earnings will be strong and forward PE will drop to 10ish....surprised that shorts think there is that much downside,,,,so many other overvalued stocks,,,,,,shorts here are trading on history in my opinion. Good luck longs...."
"ANALYST.......KHC Could Easily FALL ANOTHER 50% FROM HERE !Stock may drop even moreKraft Heinz stock has shed an astounding 68% over the past two years under the existing leadership team. Forrest thinks the stock could easily fall another 50% based on the company’s awful financial affairs.Others on Wall Street agree that Kraft Heinz is in serious trouble.Guggenheim Securities consumer goods analyst Laurent Grandet says Patricio must take aggressive action if he wants to save the company. The company must invest in a range of $700 million to $800 million over two years to jump start sales growth, Grandet believes. Required investments include marketing to drive interest in core brands and in research and development to find the next hot product."
"Shorts are in control for now, it's temporary for sure and creates the buying opportunity for those who regretted they didn't load up when it was under $25"
Numbers looked pretty good. I get the people complaining about the debt. It's a wait and really. See if they can get any results in the next year from the cost cuts and most of all marketing. Khc should stabilize there products pay down debt and merge with someone. Merge with GIS or Kellogg's.
This stock and CVS were Cramer favorites as I recall...not faring very well are they??? LOL
"https://fintel.io/so/us/khcTold U buying started, first small but"
chart looking more solid all the time grinding back to 33.5
We need to boost our immune system by real food instead of KHC chemical mix!
Pay day tomorrow !!
Seems that ACB added some Kraft folks to their board
Morningstar reports 50.00
Nice beat.
did WB just reinvest his div? look at those buys...
I got the alert from Yahoo KHC reached a new 52-week high. How disappointing it was to see that was set at $34. I was a long term holder in HNZ before Buffet bought them out. I guess it was a mistake to think the combined HNZ/KFT would perform just as well...oh well.
"@UrMoney hahahaha you’re definitely a scurred lil short. I can tell because you talk like everyone here has a cost basis of $80 a share. I’m sittin at $30.50 cost basis and am stoked to see these technicals and earnings blow you outta the water. UrMoney, more like my money now!"
earnings on oct 31. before market
"check out what this investment co. bought. First Eagle Investment (Trades, Portfolio), a New York-based firm that seeks long-term capital appreciation through a value-oriented approach, disclosed this week that it established five new holdings during the third quarter: Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE:SCHW), The Kraft Heinz Co. (NASDAQ:KHC), HD Supply Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:HDS), Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) and Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (NYSE:VAC)."
0.78 vs 0.73 ... EPS beats by 6.8% and people are unhappy... Mr. Market by Ben Graham...
"Perhaps someone trying to shake the weak hands out. Maybe WB wants to steal our shares. Societe Familiale Just acquired 250,000 shares at a higher pps."
How about that Buffett Bounce!
Interest rates are up. They have to much debt
Another dividend cut followed by another 30% drop is more likely in the near future
Patience
Fair value $45
Warren always makes money!With two Warren Buffet board members on KHC I bet that dividend is rock solid!
KFC is a great stock. Congrats guys!
"two pieces of irreevant chatter popping up in free KHC forums today: 1. KHC director sells off few thousand shares and 2. regulators may try KHC in court again after KHC sued for damages in non disclosure stemming from derivative alleged manipulation. shares bought/sold by insiders means nothing for so many reasons i won't bore you. further, discover how many shares they still hold. as to the CTFC suit chatter, this will be settled once again out of court and probably to KHC benefit. news media and ""analysts"" are just trying to acquire your eyes and tracker clicks. KHC is doing fine and trending. yes, headwinds are certain with next 5 quarters of projected light earnings numbers. on a personal note, our avg down in 2019, and adding div to lower basis as well, and just speaking of KHC: our tax accountant indicated a 9.273% gain. we're pleased, and of course, Treasury is pleased as well."
"Hmmmmm, another fresh ALL TIME LOW today. And it's going lower."
"With $SHOP multiples $KHC is $150,000.00 stock."
Just bought another 1 million usd khc here. Happy.
"I may have missed something, but how did you arrive to 5,5% diví yield? 0,4 from 28 is not that much.."
i like the following non tech stocksKHC and CVS
"Think to yourself ""Is this a broken company or just a broken stock""?------Answer---Company- Going under $28.00."
probably close green
"The Ex Div date that I know of is March 8th , so Friday not the date your looking for unless things changed"
@R @UrMoney How is that covering going ?
"Looks like realisation of the continued underlying losses here are creeping in. Without asset sales the headline figures woukd have been a further loss. Seems that Ketchup sales keep declining, and soup and beans are a very competitive market indeed with supermarket home brands offering much lower priced options."
"Can this get to $45 by April 16? My options would be worth $50,000 if it can. I sure could use it with the bloodbath going on in tech lol"
Good thing about being almost bottom priced is not much further to go in this bad market.
While you guys sell...million of dollars in call options were going in...so I joined them 
What are you guys thinking about earnings next week? Beat and raise?
Capital gains tax won’t hurt buy and hold dividend investors much
stock not going much lower. buffet and 3G not selling. didn't buffet say buy when everybody else is selling.
Next week is gone to have big bounce. Nothing going to happen today because of the option closing today
Kraft Heinz reached a 52 Week high at 36.23
earnings in may will be.thru the.roof..huge.quarter..factories working round the.clock
KHC is now paying more than 7% dividend yield. May add more ahead of ex-div date.
sales are up over 200%
http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/sec-filings
"If you have been paying attention, they have been doing more advertising"
It appears the bottom is in. Up today with the DOW down 400+
new CEO..new cfo..right the ship and move on
1%+ reversal very bullish.
Mac n Cheese is off the best seller menu.
I love KFC. Had the spicy chicken yesterday. Added tomato.
KHC is worth to own . Is cheap and undervalued stocks.
KHZ and CPB complete gifts. This is when you buy and buy big.
$76B in debt! $ 76b in debt $76b in debt $76b in debt. If you make 1 billion in pure annual profit “post” dividends...it will take 76 years to pay it off . Or you can sell off 25 more BUs @ 3B each ....leaving you with no brands to sell . This stock was at 95$$ !!!! It is a beached whale 
"markets down 4% and this is flat, yeah 100% nonsense. wonder what wil e patricio ""genius"" is up to? guess he has his ""growth officer"" making some new all vegetable ketchup mustard relish or something mix. they do know how to innovate over there at khc lol."
I laughed at the nervous Nellies and now wish I was one of them $9k loss hurts.
not bad week..treading water... hopefully bad news is over and slowly build cause
From this point on we go up.
BMO puts new PT at $40
big day..need more volume on these up.days..below avg volume
the wording on last earnings release was this was a low base dividend and it could increase slowly from there
mute the pessimist nonsense posters and enjoy the king of stocks KHC.
Folks this is the reversal that comes when a bottom is in !! Ann if Buffet and 3G buy just a little this thing will be at $42 in two weeks.
KFC moving up! That's what I like to see.
Great news from kraft at the conference call . This company will boom. God bless the USA . Stay safe !
The faster the fix for KHC the bigger the dividend cut is going to be Think just like GE had to do. Look for all the dividend to be gone and fix the company fast like 3-4 years
"Buffett isn't selling, and neither am I."
No support @ 60
Nice I have 350 Jan $42 call options. They went up 18 cents today! :)
LOL OH NO Warren is selling AAPL and buying Kraft. LOL now what are you going to do LOL
"4 in 1 ad breakout. easy to grasp when most are watching on screen sizes of 65"" and up. we use an epson ceiling mount with a pull down in our seattle basement and have a home full of eager, opinionated viewers. guess it's pick the corner of the screen that interests you. purportedly this will become norm for marketing."
Will see a nice bump on Monday morning...buy it..
"This will follow GE’s lead and split itself up. Question is what they’re selling and for how much? Considering the recent write off, investors don’t know how to value the sum of their assets. And.. I’m too lazy to do the work. So many other great companies out there. Any bull case has to involve divesting.. till that happens, tread lightly."
"It's rattling around 31.90... obviously sellers are out. After more bad news it didn't go lower. To the brave: ""Time to buy"""
"It is telling that after the initial bust, Buffet REDUCED his stake in KHC. How often does he do that?? Not very often. I would not be surprised to see another filing that shows a further large reduction in Berkshire's holding of KHC."
"Still say I don't believe the negative articles are capable of bringing about a 2.5% decline. SOMETHING has been leaked that hasn't hit the wires yet. This is ridiculous last weeks excellent run wiped out in 1 day! fire the CEO, oh wait, they already did. Just hope the incoming CEO is all he's touted as."
"Ketchup shortage? Hahahahhaha First we had a ""penny shortage"", then a ""chip shortage""....now this ...Socialist media is comical."
"Millennials won't eat processed cheese,but stand in line for processed fake meatand Tide Pods.I'm 75yo and ate Kraft/Heinz my whole life.Doc says I'm healthy as a bull.No problem."
"On May 2nd, Oscar Meyer is giving away up to 1M meals, every time you use #FrontYardCookout.Socially responsible KHC"
Is earning before or after then bell today?
Next mile stone breaking into 40’s we got this Kraft Heinz for ever.
"All the increases with only 2 weeks in the pandemic in March, imagine during the entire 2nd quarters... Shelves are still empty at the store and heins/kraft facturies are working 3 shifts per day. This is good signs!!"
dividend is solid at.this level..acct issues are gone..plan in.sept will clarify path to slowly pay down debt and short term.earnings should be great due to.coronavirus..all good
65 end of year !
A controlled 2.80% decline each day from the initial train wreck indicates this has about 10-12 % more to slide before it bottoms out. Then there will be a very slow clawing out of the cage.
Can you say mega merger with Amazon/Whole Foods? If this were to ever happen we would be right back up to $60. Amazon could handle the debt and would love the tax benefit from the recent write offs.
This is going back to 80 end of year
Another $9 and I'm even. Let's keep moving :--)
I think in a decently sufficient recession KHC is done and files for bankruptcy. Put it in the red book.
Brands losing to retail? Buffet gave no reason to buy.
beat estimates on top and bottom more upside to come
"KHC is selling way under book value, it price / sales is 1.33 comparing to peers at way higher price sales . Modenlez is at 3.3. KHC is at the bargain bin like TAP, i love them as valued consumer staples holding"
How low will this go?
"KHC is a buy here.1. Technically in weekly chart, its a double bottom, and the price breaks the long term down trend. If you know DOW ABC theory, this is the best entry point, as its B. Once price go above 32 again, this is going to rock.2. Financially, KHC debt rate is not high actually. 50% is nothing in todays low rates. KHC profit margin is around 25% TOP in class. KHC PB is 0.6 which is realky low.3. KHC can save a TON of taxes in the next 5 years after it report loss on assets. And it will boost income crazily.Look at MSFT, after it report NOKIA asset loss, BIG HUGE upside. Overral, its hard to find a good business with such a low price!"
Buy or sell?
It is oversold and it is time to nibble away as GDP rises to 3.2.
Anybody else heard about buffet adding to his position now that khc is cheaper￼
food inflation is not looking good right now.....
sold. bad for years not waiting around way too many opportunities
Watching Buffet talking on cnbc 3 months ago about Kraft said he could buy 10% more shares in the company in the future if he see fit. Wondering if he is waiting for the stock to be in the teens OR when the SEC investigation and accounting errors are over. Could be after the company resolves these problems which could be 1-2 months from now. For the meantime stock could be headed to $20. They also have too much debt for Warren to even consider going private which I doubt
kraft's Ranch dressing beats Hidden Valley by far.
KHC makes cheap delicious food. Next recession going to have people loving Mac and cheese again lol.
"I bought a bunch yesterday. Yeah, a bit of a #$%$-shot But.. Selling under book, Buffet has a boat load at a big loss, and the virus may boost it's sales. Plus a potential takeover target?"
Best KHC Product Sales:1- Ketchup2- Heinz 573- New Product ! TIMMMBER !(Snicker)
This is a great opportunity to build up a high dividend portfolio while waiting for 30% upside. What's not to like?
steady Eddie over here with mo green for longs
"I know I know, you've seen it already. but KHC is still holding these price levels. not a big fan of the false breakout it had. but I still like the idea and possibility that this could start to climbhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOCJBlqT9lo&t=39s"
This is a value stock. If you aren't comfortable with them cutting the div and the price going to 26 or lower then you need to move on. They could also not cut the div and show that a recovery is taking hold. You need a strong stomach to be a value investor.
Second best dividends in food if you think otherwise at the cost.? Why? Expansion? Campbell’s? Maybe go into frozen food again?
"Analyst Upgrade, low interest rates and retired 2 billion of debt. Things are looking up."
could be down pre-market. but dip would be bought in pm trading
"What will it take for KHC to get over the hump? Been stalling at $35 despite powerful brand, good dividend, products everyone buys, etc."
Downgrade on ex-div date. Coincidence or planned? Nice way to collect div plus cheaper shares.
i am having my KFC at lunch. Guess what xomes with the fries. Heinz ketchup. The moat is inpenetratable. it is getting very attractive at this price when products are consumed predictably and generating free cash flow. still. Next quarter will not have accounting write off.
weak hands are all out already..if they get a couple things right the next few months this could take off big time
"Someone put out $300,000 on in the money call for 4/18And a lot more calls for May and July out of money calls as well."
This was a good day to add at $28.50. Sell at $29.50. Just buy 1000 shares and day trade this for years.
Enjoying my HEINZ KETCHUP right now! Best value stock!
"I'm not expecting rapid share appreciation. This has been a black-eye to Warren Buffett... But, do not underestimate Warren on working to make this company have a slow but steady comeback..."
only thing better than getting a new box of Great Value Graham crackers under $2 today would be to see a trump tweek about more tariffs either on china or eu.
Book Value Per Share (mrq) 53.64i guess the sec will make some adjustments?
"Aren't these the same bond rating agencies thatwere complicit in the 2008 MBS, CDO mortgagecrisis?"
I would be shocked if buffet doesn't buy this now and go private..parts worth more than whole..sell off all and keep ketchup
Got to have volume to have the flush and the bottom put in and for sure we are getting the volume.. Being above the old low is for sure looking good for a final flush and KHC to start it's long term move higher . Great earning and dividend for a stock trading at $27 dollars
Here comes some more buyers.
If it drops another 5% I’ll add 500 shares

Law office of Howard G. Smith announces investigation of conduct which harmed investors of KHC .
cannot go wrong with KHC in this market!!! safe choice!! people have to eat!! will go UP UP UP!!
Buffet needed a deal. Before Friday it would of cost $60 a share. Now can take it out for under $50 a share.
Remember when khc was trying to acquire UL 3 years ago?? UNilever was like “noooo thank youuuu” lol. That was when khc knew the road ahead would be rough
"""Typically, if a company wants to pay a dividend, you need to have a solid balance sheet and strong cash flow, and those are the kinds of companies that do well when times get tough,"" Mark Tepper, president and CEO of wealth management firm Strategic Wealth Partners, said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""THINK ABOUT IT."
"The largest stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) was held by Berkshire Hathaway, which reported holding $9096.6 million worth of stock at the end of September. It was followed by Citadel Investment Group with a $124.7 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Levin Easterly Partners, Laurion Capital Management, and Armistice Capital. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Berkshire Hathaway allocated the biggest weight to The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), around 4.24% of its portfolio. Fairholme Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 3.81 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to KHC.As one would reasonably expect, some big names were leading the bulls' herd. Armistice Capital, managed by Steven Boyd, established the most valuable position in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). Armistice Capital had $41.9 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management also made a $22.7 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with new positions in the stock are Bruce Berkowitz's Fairholme Capital, Renaissance Technologies, and Simon Sadler's Segantii Capital."
"If it stays above 28, I’m happy with the dividend !"

"I like that my value plays $KFT $T $CVS and $L.to all took off when market went down yesterday......these defensive plays will all report strong results on back of stay at home food consumption and HBO growth (AT&T) and vaccine roll out (Loblaws, CVS)......in meantime I like the aggregate 5% dividend......great natural hedge to the tech volatility ahead! (Though I like Apple, Amazon, QQQ too....this is just a nice balance in the portfolio!)"
Value stocks are in play now. Im in with 500 shares. The rest of the market is too high and you're seeing a shift back to value
Can someone explain what writing down the value of brands actually means? Seems like a pretty easy way to cost me profit at the moment.
"KHC is the perfect example of why you DIVERSIFY. KHC was suppose to be ""safe"". A boring old consumer defensive. What ashame. Feel bad for those who thought this was safe and put more in it than they should have..."
"No one willing to take a risk on KHC without knowing the ship has stabilized. This may not come, according to company until 7/31 or there about. I'm still scratching my head on the .60 runup last week only to lose it in the same session."
"I'm in, 200dma? yup, starting a position in AH and loading calls in the AM."
Great neutral article about KHC ! https://junto.investments/companies/kraft-heinz-time-to-invest/
I just banned urmoney lol bye bro
Unilever should buy KHC.
I invested in KHC because I was told there would be food. Let's eat!
"Wow, thanks for the discount!"
The list of law firms suing KHC will be long.
"ON THE WAY UP. JUST GOT 5,000 MORE"
Was this a buy couple of years ago at $ 92?
OMG OMG close to $1000000 gain in one day!
"Kraft Heinz is increasing overall manufacturing and shipping efficiency by cutting production of some items, for instance reducing less popular flavors of a given product. This has freed up enough people for Kraft Heinz to create a third shift in many factories, up from two, Patricio said.Patricio said sales of Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Planters nuts have increased, and that people are also buying more Heinz vinegar to use as an alternative to cleaning products.“We’re breaking production records every day,” Patricio said, adding that a Davenport, Iowa-based Oscar Mayer plant he visited yesterday had increased weekly capacity by 40% compared with the same week last month."
KHC just introduced Salad Frosting to make kids eat more vegetables. should be a $40 stock soon.
next purchase after dividend paid..keep averaging in
Warren buffet members of the secrete society of loving cheese I’m issuing a all in alert on Tsm
Perfect example of why you can't ignore spending on advertising and marketing to build brands. 3G's approach leads to short-term gains but long-term disaster.
Great day again congrats to all longs
Time to buy!
"The 10-K annual report (on the SEC's website today) for 2020 is intereting in its y-on-y improvement. Its current ratio for 2020 is approx. 1.34, whereas the corresponding fihure for 2019 was approx. 1.03. Some of this is pandemic-related, but solid organic growth is also not to be discounted.KHC seems, IMO, to be a classic illustration of Benjamin Graham's investment strategy, namely:Find a large, well-established company which has been kicked to the curb by the investment community. Buy shares and wait a year or two. Sell out when your investment has appreciated in share price by 50%.Improvements in the running of KHC are beginning to causing its share price to advance."
"KHC can't stay out of court and litigation. between consumer protection and shareholder suits, it never ends. this latest appeal and sustain, by consumer plaintiffs, leads the day. question is whether it's worth over 2%. that's a question you will decide before putting out 500K for more shares."
"Until you see a press release on KHC own web site about earnings. I would not believe any of the fake news stories about earnings , KHC will announce when and where the conference call is for the earnings release. DO NOT believe any of the Wall Street fake news to try and manipulate the stock."
Tomorrow day traders will take it to 34/35 easily
"At the end of 2015 they only raked 600+ at barely 7b and the share price was $70. The revenue numbers is 2019 blow that away. This will stabilize and rebound, one of my favs."
Do you think it will go to 29.00 today ?????
Is the price going down today because of Kellogs?
"I wish I could buy more but as a value investor I don't trade on margin, even for screaming bargains like this.Is the dude shouting yesterday to switch to BYND instead dead btw ?"
"An Upgrade! LOVELY! Up she goes. Lovely dividend just around the corner too,"
Idk about all of you but im Buying KHC... Strong buy.
Folks you have 4 minutes to buy before the Monday Buffet Pop !! It will pop only $3.50 to $4.50 on Monday.
"stock at all time low since merger; let it bounce onto that 26.05 ATL again to form a double bottom; then back up the truck and hold for next 2-4 years as a long position. Heinz ketchup IS NOT going away! Buy what you know, buy low and ATL is an absolute gift. Patience, patience, patience."
"Sales down profit down, to the moon????"
Is the dividend safe?
people do not shop center aisle at stores do. you. fresh fresh
$40 by year end?
Who will be buying at 31 tomorrow?
What a Surprise......Red Again.
This is a huge buying opportunity. Especially if the economy is predicted to slow. KHC is always a hot commodity during hard times.
I bought today but will sell on Monday. if this is down over 27% and Berkshire owns 25% of the company he had to have unloaded a bunch after or during the earnings call. if the next 5 years are anything like the last 5 years then this is definetely going down more.
I bought 1k shares at 34.89.....and am very comfortable doing so...will close over $37
NiceEarnings up 10 percent Stock up almost 80 percent in the last year. Thanks Please keep it going
What are the chances of this getting over 50 in the next year?
put the accounting department in jail
i think the.negative reaction is due to people wanting more unit sales quicker to pay down debt faster..i am ok with their plans..but sure thought they would sell maxwell house..they definately need to deal with the ingrediants in their products and update to lower sugar..costco already carries zero sugar catchup
Only up from here!
Good long-term stock for compounding dividends
Nice base forming..KHC will explode up on good news...
POS!!
Finally time to buy this
Folks from here we paint the moon in ketchup!
"""The price for individual ketchup packets has increased by 13%, the Wall Street Journal reports. Restaurants have been trying to stock up on the packets since the CDC recommended to ""avoid using or sharing items that are reusable such as menus, condiments and any other food containers."" That, combined with many eateries reverting to take-out only orders where packets would be included, has resulted in a shortage at chains according to WSJ. To combat the shortage, Heinz — which is America's most widely used ketchup brand — plans to increase single-serve packet production by about 25% to produce over 12 billion packets per year. This shows the power of the KHC brand !"
holding long term
bought 400 shares at $34.95
"Worst managed large cap consumer staples company. Cost cutting, firing employees, shutting down plants can only go so far."
should be no bonus checks for awhile use that to pay down debt
"dropped in to the message boards. Phenomenal day, yet this stock went nowhere. At some point, it's time to cut losses longs. Cheers."
Berkshire is down $800 million on Kraft Heinz today
KHC is down -4.96% to 69.10
KHC grinding up out of huge weekly base
The short squeeze coming when Buffett announces how much stock he bought in q3 is going to be hilarious.
"new leadership in behind scene form of greg e. abel and very present disruptor 'springboard brands' are to keep long term, large share holds motivated. free tip for those lost in weeds: KR shares were not acquired for abel's amusement. are you folks conscious?"
Fair market value is still much lower at around 43.00. It may take one more bad qtr to get us there but the market always wins.
"Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for this POS? I thought this was a good buy at $68 and nothing but down and company does not say a word, or do anything to make it better. I wish Buffett would just buy them instead of being a very large share holder."
"BOYS...THEY CALL ME THE ""GREAT ONE"" AND ""DOCTOR COMMON SENSE"" FOR A REASON. BUY KHC UNDER 31....THATS THE BUY, AND NOT BEFORE !!!!"
I think todays is telling you something and that KHC will have news on the earnings date very soon . So I would start looking the the earnings release date. to come out soon. Just my take and I would look for KHC to start going higher.
KHC is a cheap stock you can own under book value. The next report will be outperform. During the pandemic is essential for family to buy more food than eat out. This company will turn around for a long term investors. Good dividend.
GL longs
Not a fan of class action but in this case its screaming for one. Almost looks like its intentional. I can not imagine Warren Buffet being involved in this just to take it private. Would not be good for his reputation. Anyway new CEO starts July 1 (another 3 G boy). Should at least hope he can read and push out earnings in a timely manner. Not like his buddy is doing right now.
"kraft heinz is one of the best to trade, please see this technical breakdown on khc, very interesting chart http://prpro.press/2019/01/06/the-kraft-heinz-company-khc/"
"overvalued due to todays sec filing. expect below 30's easy, possibly teens."
KHC will fly Tuesday.
What r the chances Buffet buys out KHC
"KHC should go ex dividend the weeks of May 13-24 , Love that 5% dividend payer"
Will set another 52 week HIGH when stock opens. Onward and Upward
So happy i bought Jan 2020 calls for .93 cents literally this week
"Not retailer volume 9 Mio already,In evening checking SEC who increased"
"Just bought another 100, don’t see a huge downside right now"
Does anyone know if 3G / Berkshire are allowed to tender an offer to purchase the remaining 45% of KHC before the SEC has their missing info?
You can now get paid over double the 10 year in lots and lots of stocks. On a ten year investment Stocks are still way better than any investment in any bond.
Up .35 today at 2.05pm. Some people obviously believe in this company.
this stock will move when cut div. and increase eq. for adds and changes
does anyone no how much div is going down to
Does anyone know 1Q Earning report date? Thank you.
6.7 m shares traded...back to normal..panic is over
Any thoughts of buying Jan 2021 calls at 40?
"s#$t food is here to stay. long live Oscar Mayer. long live Kraft. Long live KHC. Give me extra ketchup on my fries and a nice juicy cheeseburger. this company will be here long after I am gone, long after Buffet is gone {well, that's not sayin' much}. it will be here a looonoog time churning out dividends ."
"I would not look for any earnings on KHC today , Why because you have not had any release from the company on when earnings are and the conference call is . Here is the Company web sire http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/index.php/"
all aboard ACB is leaving the station
KHC is already undervalued. Lowest I'd see this go would be around 20$ a share and thats if they cut the dividend again for whatever reason. KHC still brings in billions of dollar's in revenue each year. Needs restructuring and dividend cut for the long term. NO PREFERED DIVIDENDS to Warren buffet anymore or 3g. Eats up all cashflow.
Are buffet or burry selling today?? NO WAY holding for a decade like me
Well Bagz......I've come in many times over the past month pointing out the last Downgrade from a well thought of analystsaying KHC.Headed to $27.00. Looks like he's correct !Buffet stock Baggies.........
Debt is not relevant to a conpany this size. If debt matters TSLA would be at zero
48 coming on next good earnings report
looks like we are headed to retest highs
Dividend coming
"Well this isn’t good for my kids college fund, but at least I still have all those stamps[.]com shares. I go check in with that price and see how aaaargh......."
No plan.....no true evaluation/ price should be well under 20 already!
$42.00 coming get or shares before $42.00
the hoarding is on...stores here in vegas are packed as governor has threatened action..costco was swamped with people
Owning KHC long term is free money.
Question can the CEO be fired?
@Duckula......I SURE Miss You !Think Maybe You Got.......Ummmmmm Margin Called ?
"I've seen this movie...this won't hold a $30 handle, divi buyers won't come in until it pays over 6%"
"Further dividend cut talks are from shorts trying to manipulate the market. The company has taken its cut and is now adjusting its business.This looks like a fantastic buy created by illogical selling pressure. Even with the new dividend of $1.60 per year, that's 5% at $32 per share and just a hair lower at the current selling price of $32.12. A great dividend rate on a solid company that is more than likely to improve its operations and gain in market price. So, 5% while waiting for a capital gain -- that's a sweet deal. I bought more, today.Good luck, longs."
"Time to raise prices on ketchup. .20 cents. Sort of like net flicks ,stock gets hit raise prices no problem. or .10 cents every item earnings good. small effect big pay off...."
"If it’s true that KHC recently changed the ingredients in their cream cheese, it would surprise me. It’s precisely the type of product tampering that Buffett has always warned against as a means of reducing costs and possibly increasing profits."
"M2 money supply moved to the right. Economic output remains stable (or more likely suppressed) this equates to increased prices. KHC input costs likely stable or falling due to weak demand in supplier’s market (agriculture demand weak due to less restaurant consumption). KHC products are predominately price inelastic therefore higher prices shouldn’t impact demand. Beneficiaries of increased grocery foot traffic as consumers forgo restaurants (out of fear, shut down, or lost of wages). Consumer staple demand increasing as work from home orders persist. Now, it’s all about management execution... KHC is experiencing strong secular tailwinds and is poised to breakout if they’re capitalizing on current market conditions. It will come down to execution and managements ability to pass prices through distribution (could be tough as channels also are attempting to expand margins)... My analysis suggest it’s a strong buy as I see both channels and manufacturers poised to benefit from strong secular tailwinds."
We will see soon like Monday Mar 25 2019 if I am right or wrong and if KHC pops higher on dividend reinvestment day. NWL sure did on it's dividend reinvestment day Mar 18 2019. KHC has about 15-16 millions shares that can be purchased just from the dividend pay out so we will see if We have a very big up day when we have a 15-16 millions share buyer. If so you are running out of time to get your shares of KHC so cheap and paying about 5% dividend
don't worry your steel will get 5%dividend will take 7 years to get your money back. if you purchased the stock today
Can someone define food inflation and why it would increase share price.
"I think KHC will rebound, parked it in my Roth! People will always need food and KHC has been a staple. I am long KHC!P.S. I owned before but bought back in after the dip."
Thanks for the cheap shares to all the Dumbells selling today.
Is today the day the bleeding will finally end?
No one cares dividend in this market! Dividend is nothing! The huge branding treasure is the gold mine! And new CEO Patricio knows how to leverage this power!
Undervalued
#G does not think KHC is worth more than $28.40 because that is the price they dumped the last shares so look out if we get back to that high again because 3G still has a lot of shares still to dump.
Funny how those CROOKS at CNBC never brought up the Lemann big buy. Big money and I have made it is made by not getting scared out of good companies at good valuations. Enjoy the day.
"buy fast, baked beans are almost sold out! :-D"
"Up .30, down .30, up .30...down .30. Come on let get this thing moving!!!"
Looks like a strong day in the market is brewing...momentum is building...KHC is already beyond liftoff here with a positive trend going forward.
"Hey, @KHC here's an idea. Why don't you FIRE YOUR HEAD OF PR. And while you're at it FIRE YOUR AD AGENCY.For your company to be this silence...this passive... and this detached during the most defining challenge of our generation - if not our century - is such a lost opportunity. KHC is in a unique position to be one of the heroes of this pandemic: Keeping factory's running around the clock so our grocery's and supermarkets stay full...setting up food banks in parking lots...helping those less fortunate in the coming weeks with care packages...and reminding Americans that Kraft Heinz is ONE OF US. We are an an American company, born n'bred in the USA (or should we say ""born 'n bread.) So yes - THIS is the time for a PR BLITZ. This is the time to ADVERTISE - when rates are low, and people are watching. And when you do advertise, do it with an inspirational tone...make it a pep talk, cause this is a war. And we are on the front lines fighting right along side viewers. And we are in it to win it.So wake up Mr. PR dude...get a clue Mrs. Marketing Manager. Step up, get proactive, and start connecting with the American people again. Create some corporate responsibility programs. Reintroduce yourself to our country. Help them get to know who Kraft is and what they stand for...give them the opportunity to make see Kraft with fresh eyes...in a whole new light. So get out those hand held cameras and iPhones...revamp that Instagram and Twitter page (and start a Tik Tok account while you're at it). And show us how you are making a difference: in factories, in marginalized communities, in people's kitchens. Because NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU STAND FOR. It's time for a branding campaign...and everyone's watching. Signed, A Major Shareholder (and award-winning advertising executive)"
"Earnings forthcoming before August 2. Should you have sense enough to Read Q4 Earnings Statement summary you will have all you need. and IF, KHC comes in with .60¢ to .62¢ the 81% AI will buy. KHC could make 33.50, perhaps. if less than .60¢, KHC will be battered and we will continue to add again. we maintain a family trust. we are not investors. enable option straddles if you are a trader. for the lonely hearts here, most of you, try tinder."
Still a great dividend stock and will go back up eventually
"3.3% yield and 14 P/E ratio with the yesterday's close price. I think the numbers are not bad. 4.5% yield and 10.6 P/E ratio with current price. It is attractive with the improved payout ratio. The only thing I am worrying about is the cash flow. If KHC can make better cash flow, the dividend can be recovered, then the stock price will also be recovered. Can they improve the cash flow?"
"This stock is 'Dead Man Walking'. $30b in debt with $1b in cash and declining sales/profit? Wow. CEO coud not get a job anywhere else? I can smell the rotting of all of the sugar, highly processed products they produce."
"Everyone uses The Kraft Heinz Company. A poll: if you have used KHC products give a thumbs up, if not, give a thumbs down."
I have been following this stock since the big dip and decided today to buy shares. I believe that they have an extremely popular product line and will recover on a gradual basis. Plus they have a decent dividend.
Sold earnings coming. They can write down assets some more at year end won’t affect cash flow. Probably shake some weak hands out. I’ll get to add more for cheap
People.will keep earing this stuff. A good buy at 35.
I'll load up st 45. Downgrades next week.
Last time we were at this level 3G sold and tanked the stock. Let's hope they have enough cash in their coffers and will let it ride this time.
Listen to the tape
Does anyone else feel that this will be up a few dollars per share tomorrow in pre-market
This is BS! Had great news and up 2.5% in the morning and now we are back to where we started. Why???
UrMoney answer your phone. It's your broker making a margin call.
"was having an awesome trading day until i saw khc. ugh, unbelievable. don't worry there is plenty of room in the pumpkin patch."
Urmoney its lunch go take a break
"The thing that troubles me most about KHC is the terrible job the so-called genius Warren Buffet and his employees at BH did with KHC. How could they allow this criminal management team and BoD to destroy the value in so many great brands, squander billions of dollars of earnings and far more in equity value and increase debt to ridiculous levels. Where the hell was Warren, the dope?"
"This is an opportunity to buy right now, still a good consumerstock!!! Marketcap 42B /enterprise value 89B . Tomorrow it will bounce back nicefully step by step"
Why up AH?
New investing motif: take the other side of Buffet's positions.
looking to buy a position in this stock is this the right choice?
"Horrible run company, but look at their products. I bought today."
"I've been saying to buy at $48 for about 6 months now. Your chance is coming very soon. Buy at 448 or miss the boat. If you think it's going lower, you're probably wrong but why take the chance? At $48 this is a steal, pull the trigger and make the buy of the decade."
Up almost a buck. Rotation back to defensive staples. World's gotta eat.
"KHC sales are very good as shown by General Mills, Modeleiz, etc."
"Opportunity seldom knocks. When it does, open the door and take advantage of it!"
Filled 1811 shares @ $33.12. You guys will miss out on the chance to make $$$.
Call to put ratio is 3 to 1. So more expect an upside in near future.
oh yeah. new low right there. no way it doesn't see 25 bucks in weeks.
So they grow the top line but miss on the bottomline. Sounds like increasing production costs that should be temporary. Buying opportunity IMO
the only stock that gives dividends during covid19.will reach all times high today
This is free money
"I'm buying. Could take a few years to figure things out and recoup but as long as div stays, i can wait"
Going down to $10 per share perhaps!
Stil expensive.
"argus research did its downgrade 4 or 5 days ago. that's history now. ""trading central"" now caling: ""if 29 resist holds, look for 35+ going forward in reasonable period."""
"picked a lot of goodies up at walmart, not one khc brand went into the cart as usual. leaving money for real purchases like fresh fruits and meat. stay away from that processed trash folks, it raises your chances of cancer dramatically like smoking."
Looks like I was right KHC is going to be safer and better than any big bank. Just maybe Warren will sell some JPM and buy more KHC.
"It's very disturbing and sad to see how many may own stock in a company they actually know nothing about. Robert Kraft's Kraft Group has never been associated, involved, or part of Kraft Foods. Robert Kraft has nothing to do with Kraft Foods. There is so much ignorance here it's sickening. No wonder so many are losing so much money. Get your facts straight"
What/still a pos.

Options point higher!!
MARKET MORNINGS on youtube just released a good video on kraft and its breakout potential.
"Been watching this for about 6 months now, always considered the valuation too pricey for consumer staple, but when it dropped to 53-55, It became more compelling, so last week I entered a position at 55. Surprising to see a company this size and with this reach nearly 8% down per-market, so today will certainly be interesting. I would not have touched it back at 90, 80, 70 nor in the 60’s, so I thought I was getting a ‘deal’. LolIt’s quite the spectacle what the market is doing to these food producers, GIS, K,CPB, etc. price per share are dropping with valuations lower than 3 years ago, yet consumer eating habits have not changed that much. Instead of buying some organic meal or product, you just get the organic version of it made by KHC now."
Rangebound 32 to 35
So that's how recovery looks?
So maybe putting profit ahead of people doesn't actually work so well in the long run?
"Rising with good volume. Stochastic oscillator and RSI are triggering bullish signal, according to stoxline. A break of 64.75 could move it up to 75.63."
WOW the guidance is
Why is this trading at 127 P/E? It's a food company....
mindful: ex div date November 14. Pay date: December 13. You reinvest your thousands of div pay outs during Dec.
Heading over $40 by months end! 
"Buffet and 3G are 100% to blame for this. Corporate greed. They are pirates. They combined these and just took the money. They had to know this was going to happen. They both have people on the board. This is so corrupt. They have so much debt because of them, they may never get out. The pirates already took the money. Buffet can only redeem finals by buying this company. Maybe he wants it bankrupt so he can but it even cheaper. I'm now Bag holder. Unsure if I should take my losses and get the hell out, or wait to see what is done. This is so far below book value. Buffet is not the upstanding man he tries to be. A lot of people were paid off so he could make money."
NEW CFO!!!!!!! Super happy!
Options are showing that many are betting big this will jump to $37.5 - $39.00. Lets keep our fingers cross. Tomorrow will be a positive day. Just be patience !!
This has really done well since the onset of this mess. I started buying before it hit the fan and the price has recovered already and then some.
Every dog has its day.
"So the vandamme buy was actually not a buy ?Stock looks cheap, 4 billion free cash flow this year, 12 percent free cash flow yield"
Khc products are constantly sold out in the 3 supermarkets around me. Tried a few products and were impressed enough to buy more off the shelf and buy the stock.
woweeeeee; pass me the 57
Maybe KHC can hold $36 next time..meanwhile happy with div
Just no one who owns shares ever sell and then it’ll have to go up
"All buffet has to do is go on TV and say how he is buying more and how KHC is a deal at this price and boom, a gain of 10%."
Their strategy seems to be to panic and reformulate their products to be cheaper. Tried new formula Mac and cheese. I will never buy it again. This stock has further to fall.
Kraft Heinz has new ceo and buffet is would buy this stock at cheaper price .
Warren Buffett needs to do something
"This breakout from 32.17 is clean and cleared, march towards the higher higher seems to be certain that supports by technical and fundamental strong tail winds !!!"
First close above $40 since Feb 2019!
Wow if your cheese is unpasteurized it could have listeria in it only but KHC cheese it’s pasteurized. KHC saving America one cheese stick at a time.  thanks for not poisoning our food like the other cheese brands thank you.
There is only 20 million shares shorted.About $600 million today.But a squeeze could happen Monday.
Lot of volume today.
This will do what $GIS did. $55 Soon!
Is Warren buying everything? Nice little run
"only vultures with lawsuits in the news feed so far , is there anything else going on in the company ?"
$90 Soon!
Buy CHD and replace current management at KHC with the management of CHD. Two problems solved at once.
"KHC still has about 30 billion in goodwill it still needs to write off. LOL,LOL and you were thinking it can't get any worse LOL, LOL,LOL"
PE as of yesterday was 11.48 while the average in this industry is 22. Can't believe people are selling today when the ex div date is Wed. at over 5%. Maybe they are chasing TSLA and BYND
Looks like many shorts are trapped !! These will continues to gap up for days ..
"In Buffet's letter to Berkshire investors , he acknowledged the loss from KHC - then he said they like to buy stocks ' when the company is on the operating table ( wounded ) "" . Based on that comment , he may buy some shares next week at a discount - he said "" companies that offer value 5 ,10 years down the road "". Let's hope he pumps the share price based on this discount -"
KHC is leading the vintage flavor trend comeback with General Mills together. The Super Bowl ad is so touching and just the start of this retro flavor campaign!
"""Buy,, When there is Ketchup in the Streets"" Warren Buffet"
I think ketchup should be a commodity like orange juice or pork bellies.We could measure it as frozen concentrated ketchup per pound and sell futures contracts.
40 is bottom
Will be up a few dollars next week but a long road back the noise is deafening.
KFC looking good. Buying tomorrow.
"WOW look at that rates are dropping like a rock. That got to be really good for KHC, Plus KHC pieces are going higher just like everyone else. Now that has to be really good for KHC also. WOW I think KHC is going to be going HIGHER."
KHC will be worth $42 a share by April.
I picked some up to add to my div folder
Be careful comparing this with Apple getting hit and rebounding. Apple didn't cut dividend. That is a significant difference. Let the dust settle before buying back in....
Cramer on CNBC this am gives it a buy! He said they need to buy somebody. Could CHD be that somebody?
Bottom line is valuation is now attractive...buying opportunity I wonder if 3g and /or BRK decide to double down here?Or maybe someone else comes in to drive a turnaround?
This proxy against buying Campbell’s international in a logical world is super bullish. Focus on fixing what you have and lower debt.
"Buffett will not sell KHC imo I have followed him for decades. Even if he did he once sold hd, mcd, wmt, over the years and those stocks over time went up way higher! my point is do your own dd and don't follow the herd which is a ticket to the poor house. One thing however that you can take from Buffett is to buy with a margin of safety."
Very bullish now...
insider trading strikes again this was going up before the news came out this is bs
Sure looks like Heinz made out on this deal. Perfect timing
Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers upgrades Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) from Hold to Buy and announces $38 price target.
the currently high dividend is not sustainable. change my mind.....
"Not really sure who had a bigger ""BLOW OUT"" Nike or KHC? Great buy at $35.00."
Glad to see KHC is keeping pace again today i sure don't want to be let down.
going to go buy kraft ranch and shedded cheese to go on my salad some ketchup for my kids fries...almost forgot the Philadelphia cream cheese for my chips.

"The amount of debt over FCF is really scaring me off this stock, comments?"
"KHC conversations are useless. WS continues to lack any long term confidence in KHC. Higher sales and earnings, but non cash write down of brand takes precedent. WS looks for negative in KHC while pumping less value equities with higher debt and lower earnings. KHC PE a is much lower than market. What will propel KHC higher? Consistent quarter to quarter earnings and cash flow improvements with out special writedowns, along with new brand strategies to push healthy products."
ur money guy is a rabbit. he's run off now. just know that he won't back up a word he says. he hides in his wife's home and talks smack. he met the wrong guy to do that with. now ur money just hides and talks. will ultimately state: next time ur money talks smack about my family i will meet up with him and have lemonade.
"It will go to $40 soon because I said so.Yeah, that's my justification.Also because they produce at least 100 products of all types, 20 which I buy.You know it, I know it, it will go up.Just not today.Maybe next week.Count on it."
They are supposed to announce earnings today after the market close
Looking to dip my toe in this at some point today. Volume has decline each of the last 3 days and I think most of the sellers have already sold if they were going to sell.
looking at the chart looks like khc is going back down to the twenties
"With earnings a week from Thursday, I like $KHC. Has a 5% dividend yield, Buffet owns a big chunk. Investors expect horrible news (expectations low). Stock trading at multi-year lows. Chart in extreme oversold area. It has all the makings of a bounce."
Can you say $5? How do you know WB is not shorting?
lock down extensions will do well for khc sales in 2q
When they downgraded the credit rating it goes down 2$ when they upgrade it it goes up .12c
What time does WB speak tomorrow?
price means nothing without understanding the company.
Very attractive PE
"This stock was valued at 98 $ a year ago , now at 32 has no buyers what a joke . This is a plot to take over the company ... me think ."
"sold all my shares, no sense being greedy , it had a great move ,, picnic season is over which gave the good news."
Bought at $60. Love it. This baby is $70 by end of July.
KHC products sold out everywhere! Nothing to do at home but eat
"Warren Buffet was the kid who dated the ugly girl in middle school because he knew she would eventually lose weight, acne would clear up, braces would eventually comes off, and her melons would be big. He knew this by doing the research, in this metaphor it was looking at her mothers physical features. He buys garbage 10 years before it becomes profitable."
why is cfo still in his position..David knopt..29 year old punk should have been fired long ago

Seeing a prolonged rescission as unemployment will stay elevated next 12 months. Expect defensive stocks like khc GIS pep tsn to be the safe place when a vaccine is distributed. Optimism will see money being rotated out of these stocks but also a portion sidelined money will be put into these same stocks. Not much downside here
Buy KHC for long term investors get a good dividend. Company will turn around for next report optimistic during the pandemic more products been sold than expected.
Obviously holders of KHC are pumping this stock. They HOPE they didn't make a bad decision. They want you to join them in this stagnant stock. KHC failed to recognize changes in consumer tastes. This is not just a momentary anomaly. Nothing will change until management takes steps to modernize their vision for the future of their products. But I do happen to like KHC products and often select them over generics or new organic fads. But then I did grow up with them.
Buying heavily here
"So if nothing else changes, we had a double bottom around 31. And from here we rise. For a stock like this, no news is good news! Please no more news......"
Does anyone know when they will announce earnings? is it on May 23rd? Thanks
KHC now down 50% in less than two years. So much for safe food stocks.
KRAFT foods can't make products fast enough for their demand ! Mac and Cheese flying off the shelves.
Company is in a JAM and needs to Preserve the balance sheet.
"With bond yields crashing and the market looking toppy, investors will be looking for stocks with good yield that have not run up recently (and therefore might not drop) during this next downturn. I think holding KHC here will prove to be very smart."
BOYS.....BUFFETT IS THE BACK STOP. NO NEED TO WORRY. BUFFETT IS SITTING ON OVER 100 BILLION IN CASH. BUFFETT AINT GOIN TO LET THIS DROP FAR....BANK IT !!!
listen to @Stock Trader at your peril
of course buffet was told a few days ago what was going to happenhe certainly couldnt sell but then he didnt buy anymore did he?
I keep seeing comments about selling now and taking tax loss...If that’s your game then now may be the time for one reason...you have over 30 days before year and typically fund managers sometimes sell before Xmas holidays in order to lock in there profits for year end...This helps fund manager insure their performance bonus...Thus you may be able to buy the few days after in a dip and have your tax loss...
YOURMONEYNOTMINE.....AINT REAL SMART. DOES ANYONE THINK BUFFETT WILL LET HIS 25% EVAPORATE. THIS IS NOW ABOUT PRIDE. BUFFET TURNS THIS AROUND IF ITS THE LAST THING HE DOES. BELIEVE ME.....HE WILL PUT THE PEOPLE IN POSITIONS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN....BANK IT!!!!
look at that chart. you're basically the same place you were before last quarters pop. while you had your money in this mess those months you coulda had it in something else. wow. no point in buying khc when bgs and cag have better balance sheets.
"NO WORRIES.....UP IN AH TRADING !Alas, ONLY A Nickel !Snicker @"
Really is a different company than just 1 year ago. Concept of the change to work at home post pandemic is really a strong macro trend. Large investors getting in right now.
"I own long term call options out to 2021, thought for sure I’d be selling those after the earnings report would lift it over 50, looked at buying puts to protect my long position, but they seemed pricey, and I did not believe it would drop below 42, well, as usual I was wrong. Will load up on more calls......and for those reading about Robert Krafts troubles....he hasn’t nothing to do with KHC, he made his fortune with paper, just happens to have the same last name."
Best brands in the world
With the dividend cut I just dont see this going anywhere but lower. Think I will sell and put the money to work elsewhere...
Expect 30+ today or within the week
wow not only 52 week low ah but 5 year low how buffet will react tomorrow?
Tender the offer already before the market pops the stock and shareholders don’t want to sell. We all know it’s coming. The worst kept secret on Wall Street. $40/share or 24 billion. Pennies to you guys at 3G and Berkshire. Clean it up and refloat it at $100/share.
"Campbell's soup, Conagra and Kraft is where you want to be in a market like this."
Slow grind to $48 short term
Tomorrow will be 35$
buffet last seen wasting away again in margaritaville
CAG is also ready to move up. World gotta eat.
it takes but a few seconds a day to mute the annoying spam from China.
I wonder what really is going to happen to the stock price when they do finally report earnings. For their sake I hope that somehow when the report comes that it exceeds everyone's expectations. Otherwise its going to be a horror show......Makes me want to own some puts.
"I think Buffet is averaging down and getting ready for a big surprise !! Folks this is a food company, if they improve their merchandise and get into healthy foods the stock will pop to $45 in a week."
see if it holds gain...usually fades down stretch..like my horses
Thinking about buying a starter looks like it’s settling now. Do you think they will keep any dividend going forward ?
"Walter Kerr, a Canadian investor, is increasing hisposition; Mr. Kerr feels with strong convictionthe dividend yield makes KHC a Buying Opportunity."
23 cents from losing an entire year dividend in 1 day and no news.
What I got from WB interview is that he would be a buyer at these levels
Power bottom action today!
"june 14. divi. All short left this position. AI robots buying ov every dip. Slow recovery. We should close gap 48$ somewhere in next 6 month. Same story as with chipotle, when went down from 750 to 275 and after back to 700. My prediction: early 2020 $48-51 and may/june 2021 - 78-91$"
Relief rally sooner than later. May be today? Who knows. Stay optimistic guys.
This will creep up to $45 until the earnings are released. $55 soon!
"mindful May 2, 9 am CDT brk meetup starts, continues 'til noon. no audience questions: good. all questions fielded by cable news ostensibly. no khc div news allegedly as div already slated pay june 26. khc/mgt will be showcased as example of stellar stewardship during ""virus"" constraint. although khc is on back burner re 3g/brk governance, i expect div suspension language or similar later half of year."
"KHC Tanking Big Time This AM As Buffet says on CNBC 'I WILL NOT BUY MORE HKC' Stock Was UP Big PM, Now Tanking on Buffet Basically Saying 'SELLLLLLLLLL' !!"
should I wait or buy now? any thoughts?
"If you like it at $34, you will love it at $33 tomorrow, and $20s by end of March. $25 by summer. Management is not serious about debt. Remove dividend, sell off underperforming assets, pay down debt, improve product line. That would make is stock go up. Anything less is just buying time to dump more insider shares."
I Don't understand this stock being that low. Everything with a Kraft or Heinz logo is almost sold out here.
"Some say this is going higher, others say it will crash lower.But as near as I can tell this thing is stuck at 32."
Come on KHC.. You’re lagging! Let’s go!
"Bernardo HeesLavery, it's Bernardo again. Look, I think, if you see the second half performance of our commercial initiatives and returns of our investment, it's going to see a very positive scenario in that sense, right? We're having volumes, consumption and market share gains in the vast majority of our categories. Even categories that have been declining for quite some time are seeing a momentum, right? And we do know there is more to come. Not only that, even with the miss of the fourth quarter, we continue to operate at industry-leading margins, and we think the 2019 base that David just highlight is a base we can grow sales and EBITDA going forward. With the actions we're taking on dividend and the work we're doing in portfolio, it remains to be successful and we are confident we can be. We will have a balance sheet that's more flexible and more prepared for future consolidation. So in that sense, I think the commercial momentum is happening. In that sense, I think even with the miss in U.S. operations, we still have the base of the margin here that allows us from this base to build 2020 and beyond and the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation for us to be a consolidator if the industry goes our way."
Bagz ! Let's See......Ond Analyst a Generous $31 PT< The Other $27 Recently.....Wow ! How is this Still $32 !
Small long position started in KHC today. More Buys on any further dips. Either a value trap or a great opp. Time will tell.
when people scared they go to safety. khc is safety.
Any surprise on Thursday and this will be up big time!
Only up from here. Nice div too. What's not to like. Kraft will never fail.
In at 240 shares !
In four to six weeks KHC @$39 - $40 per share. Watch and learn.
"Any thoughts regarding acquisition/disposal of shares by insiders during the last few days ? I've looked at the Form 4 submittals at the SEC website. - IMO, the transactions seem to involve relativel small amounts for these insiders, at least compared to their overall holdings."
baron article says may for new plan details..but.they clearly state dividend will survive
OVER REACTION!!! Lets see what old Buffet has to say.
I think this stock is a good pick and the prospects are good for more upside to come!
"Buffett bought KHC at 70-80. It’s at 29 now. Absolute steal at current price. People are coming back to their brands, which will be a boon long term because we are creatures of habit."
"Its trading water hard ,, time to go SHORT ,, bigtime !!"
Don’t care if they pay 0 on divs . I’m khc long in nyc baby !
"Everyone, turn-off your phones and restart tomorrow"
"The SEC subpoena is for minor$25 million added to Cost of goods soldMaterially it may not equal 4 cents perShare. This is wrong but it’s minor.As for drop in sales, all food items like cereals, crackers, soups-canned are declining. Examples include Campbell Soups, and General Mills. WAy too many generic foods and stiff online delivery competitors are causing shifts, lastly the divvy cut to 40 cents per quarter from 62 cents. The net yield is at nearly 4.65% even after cut at 36 and change for stock.Maybe 34$ is where we go. I doubt we see 30 and possibly as high as testing $40/ share is possible. Interesting to note 2/3 of all outstanding shares are owned by Berkshire and one other fund. Only 1/3 shares exist in open market."
"BOYS....KHC HAS ALL THE PIECES IN PLACE TO TURN THIS AROUND QUICKLY. SOME LESS PROFITABLE BRANDS WILL BE SOLD [DEBT REDUCTION] AND THEN THEY WILL BUY AN UP AND COMER. I SAID THIS A MONTH AGO, AND FRANKLY YOU CAN BET YOUR LIFE ON IT. I SEE 50 BY YEAR END. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT AN THE 5% DIVIDEND IS NOW SAFE!!!"
"CEO made all kind of excuses. Hiring, marketing, new products? Aren’t all the companies doing the same things?"
"The pandemic shows the power of the KHC brand, people empty the shelf for their trusted and loved products from KHC."
I will wait until tax loss selling is at the peak and have decided to double down at that time. It may test the 52 week low again with all the selling that will possibly occur. I am willing to hold this position for 1-2 years.
$40 next week
Needs to go down another 20%.
This is $40 value with just the real estate alone.
I'm scared Boys! I wish Warren Buffet would have lunch with me at Dairy Queen in Omaha to comfort me and to coddle me. I'm on the brink of tears. Anyone want to buy my shares? Would love to unload them. I'll give U a good deal.
"This is madness... All others companies sales will decrease by 50% because of the covid... KHC sales increased... Minus 4%, what I don't understand? Last year, we missed earnings by 2 cents, minus 10$ a share... Now we beat by 16 cents, minus 4%... Seriously..."
loaded more calls
"What are the New acquisition target for KHC. Here is an article i readSummaryThe Kraft Heinz Company is one of the largest global players in the food and beverage space and has paved its road to growth through mergers and acquisitions.The management has struggled with generating organic growth, product innovation, changing consumer demands, and competition from young brands.While the stock is trading at a low, it is evident that the management is getting ready for a big acquisition which has the potential to unlock value.The recent insider buying is a strong green signal and our analysis indicates that the stock could be an interesting investment for a 12-month horizon expected to reach USD 80"
"It's free cash flow in Trailing Twelve month (TTM) has increased to 3.8 vs. 2.7 billions comparing in 2019, and reduce 2.1 billions debt with excellent traction! A hugh run up will occur. i have re-rated it to out perform"
this will easily go up tomorrow
Conagra up 5 bucks in 10 days. KHC next. I own both. Buy now and be patient. Collect fat divvys. World gotta eat.
"Look at GE was down so much , today up 15 % almost touching 12 . Same with KHC , just needs some time to recover ."
"Oscar Mayer.. I work in walmart as a dept manager on meat/deli... and i got around 35-40 price changes for oscar mayer brand, or exactly on ""Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh"" (turkeys, chicken, ham etc (all different sizes etc) and prices increased, like from $3.48 to 3.98. and some from $5.48 to 5.98.. But only on that category. Bacon, sausages, hot dogs, lunch meats and few others same.Don't know it is a good sign or bad.Just some ""who cares"" news."
It bodes ill when a company cuts dividend.
going to 40 its a great opportunity right now
"Very close to a gap fill here. And if you think there hasn't been news, you haven't been paying attention."
"Barrons says Fair value is $60, buyout is $88"
"Naysayers. Ideally they can turn this pantry burst into debt reduction, and have a better balance sheet when this is all over. This stock doesn’t have to “grow” it can just continue paying an outsized dividend. Less debt= bigger div"
"Autopilot is collecting, looks like the computer are in the mood.So somebody is collecting.Have a good day"
So how does KHC compete when Walmart and Target provide same product and undercuts KHC price points?
Supply issues fixed. Planters and other brands revamped already with new products. selling good from what i see.
I'm going to have Kraft Heinz Mac & Cheese and Champagne tonight. Finally landed me a chunk of this baby at a knock-down price!
"I will loose all respect for Buffet if he comes out Monday and defends this no-talent CEO and their strategy. And if he does, sell your Berkshire stock because he is clearly out of touch. The evidence on KHC was in front of us all along...just a ticking time bomb. A very happy day - vindication - for all those ex Kraft Heinz employees that didn't drink the Kool-Aid and tried to stop the madness."

volume is really light----thars is what is contributing to the severity of decline
Kraft KHC OUT WHITTED BUFFETT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE
Who is buying here?
Why would anyone still follow any analyst on Wall Street they are always 100% of the time wrong over time. They NEVER EVER tell you to sell at the top in the 40 years of investing and always tell you to sell after it has dropped $50 when they should be telling you to buy. The only reason they are there is so the Wall Street firms can try and manipulate the stock movement. Fact.
Shorting this here. My generation has zero interest in KHC products. Sales numbers reflect this. Turning around this big dinosaur is gonna be very hard given their debt burden atm
most people on these boards I think are short term traders using pump or scare tactics..ignore
"vultures keep suing and want some free scraps ,lol"
Omg . Another down day
Bought sub-$25. Nice pipeline. Just need new product line.
Oscar meyer worth several billion alone. I dont wanna hear that its impossible to get out of this...its actually easy.. Sell off your underperforming assets
"The problem with Kraft is they tried to have products in the niche categories, which people purposely avoid getting from big name brands, salad dressing for one, people want something organic/local, no way do people want kraft, except for classic flavours only. This trend is going to continue, kraft should focus on what people already love about kraft, ditch everything else, stop innovating. If im buying kraft it is peanut butter, kraft macaroni, heinz ketchup, nothing else. They could also go big, maybe too big for berkshire, with WBs, blessing and start a grocery franchise and use their brands as private label. Or sign a massive equity partnership with amazon to use kraft heinz as their private brand."
Finished the day close to the high and did not give back much. I like it!
"ok, with sales dramatically increasing due to mass hoarding, interest rates going to zero (debt no longer a problem) and the juicy dividend khc seems like a hard to resist opportunity during a the present bear market imo..."
Buffett should have added on the weakness...looking for $40 by year-end
"Unfortunately, KHC buying CPB is still rumored to be in play. I just don't see the synergy between two slow(n)-growth companies struggling with traditional brands trying to reinvent themselves for evolving tastes. If KHC had some proven traction with that at this point then it might make sense. But they don't yet: https://seekingalpha.com/news/3367729-campbell-soup-pushed-explore-sale"
The share price is sick.
Good buy at this price
"I can't believe ""the article"" is the reason for today's drop. It's either profit taking from last week's runup or news that hasn't hit the wires yet. My guess is profit taking."
"you gotta love analyst...... goldman just reversed on hershey from sell to hold.....and lifted its price target to 142 from 82 great call g s!!! also saw a research report on hsy....13 analyst following...10 holds, 3 sells, and 3 buys..??? i think that adds up to 16?Ten of the 13 analysts covering Hershey have given it “hold” ratings, three have given it “buy” ratings, and three have given it “sells.”they will prob be just as wrong on wrong on kraft!"
Well here you go: Warren Buffett's Kraft Heinz investment might still be in the money https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-kraft-heinz-loss-161853570.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=ma
"Lets all look at KHC at an investment. Do they have good products? No, they have great products. Do they have good revenue? Yes. Do they have a good track record of sales? Yes. Do they have a good P/E (anything under 20 is good IMO)? Yes. Do they pay a good dividend? yes. Overall is KHC a good investment? Yes. Now, to tackle another question asked on here. NO! There is absolutely no way Warren B or anyone else will buy this co. Buying shares for the divi is one thing but buying the whole co. with all that debt? NO WAY! In my opinion, KHC is a good stock to buy for the divi and I believe KHC will be $80/share by the end of 2021. So I did buy shares today and will buy more if, only if, the share price drops to $48. If it doesn't drop to $48 I'll just keep what I bought this morning and sell it at $80 and collect my divi until then. Good luck longs."
I am liking the dividend without much volatility it can just sit here and I will collect till Wall Street decides this is to low priced and its in play. I bought near low and added as it went down more.
"I will buy more the ex-dividend date. Chaos, chaos, let’s go to chaos. Chaos is fair. Then everyone has a chance to be rich . Let’s flip the coin. Head or tail."
"I would look for a lot of new money to start flowing back into KHC , Why no more dividend cut and the cash flow is more than enough to pay the dividend and pay debt and rates are now going lower and lower and the debt is going to start looking smaller and smaller , The FED is going to force money back into the market. For sure the next time they go to renew their CD they are going to be look at stocks to put their money back in that gets them a lot better yield. Boomers need yield to live on FACT."
They are thinking of selling a very small part of the business. Will not amount to didly.
Booom !!! Breakout 52 week high

Time to accumulate like Buffett (325.6 plus million shs) at 15.6 plus Billion dollars. Called Value investing.
"dividend cut back in news today and thursday. if just a rumor, regardless. be mindful."
"the lowest short interest I can find is in khc, smart shorts avoiding this , means buy , golden cross , 40 january"
At these levels it's a good opportunity for someone to split the company up into parts or even for someone like Buffet to come in and add it to their long term portfolio. I think the problem was with 3G and their cost cutting which didn't produce long term results. It's still a good solid company.
"Don't sell your shares as a deal could be announced.On the other hand,dont buy shares at this price.I am holding my shares with a buy order to double up at the $52 area."
Stock will go back to 40 end of year .laugh all you want remember what I said
SHOW US THE REPORT
#KHC has been showing support 58.24 and resistance 62.41. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI at stoxline.
"This past Memorial Day weekend, was an eating frenzy for most Americans! Went into a Walmart and who held the COVETED end-aisle display section? KHC's, ketchup and its ""new"" mustard and mayonnaise offerings and Americans will still gobble-them-up unless they all go on a diet (not happening).!"
40c dividend for a stock at this price. That's actually a good investment. I expect the dividend will rise again from here on in.
"rate cut, per se, arguably may not affect KHC nor its bonds. share price can be affected in that market enjoys low rates and will rise going forward dragging even basement trending equities with it; namely KHC."
We wait......
When will the dividend pay into account?
"If a well known brand ketchup is available for $3 and a store brand is available for $2:50, I am still going for the well known brand. Why would I feed my kids an inferior product instead of one that's been around for decades."
this stock was $88 June 2015 - how many billions of loss is that? WB paid around $50 PPS . This stock has lost ~$67b in market cap since it began. Wow.
"Went to Walmart to pickup some more goodies and the stock kid was there. So I asked her since i recognized her ""hey just curious, what salad dressing do you replenish more often. And she said without a doubt the Great Value brand"". I grabbed a Great Value Honey Mustard and said sorry, have a good one though""."
"This is the tax loss selling I knew was coming. Why, the last 2 days the selloff had been way over the drop in the S&P. Getting ready to buy."
Algebra 101: Dividend becomes 1.60 from 2.50. That is a 36% cut. Shouldn't the shares at least shrink 36%?
"Why Kramer is spending so much time with negativity on KHC with his usual cheap gestures and vulgar comments! This guy is unpredictable, promoting many of his failing worse stocks!"

"Look for Warren to sell JPM and buy more KHC, High yielding stock ."

Reinventing dividends tomorrow
This should be 60. Easily.
"The investors who bought on May 1, 2017 at $92.20, thinking KHC was a a conservative stock, are down $63.04 per share. If you can buy at these levels and we reach $92.20 again that is about a 218% gain. Along the way cashing a 5% dividend is not bad either. I could see this stock realistically in the mid to upper 40's by the end of 2020."
"The Environmental Working Group says that 70% of conventionally grown fruits and vegetables contain up to 230 different pesticides or their breakdown products.12 fruits and vegetables with the highest concentrations of pesticides—the so-called “Dirty Dozen” include nectarines, apples, grapes, peaches, cherries, pears, tomatoes, celery, potatoes and sweet bell peppers."
Yesterday KHC soars and gets beaten back down. Today it skids and comes back up. This is gonna be a wild ride on the way to $45 by year end.
what is a good entry point for khc? i'm thinking $25?
Time for the shorts to cover their losses!
"blow out earnings 80 cents a share. KHC "" THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE"""
...Trading significantly under book value and a forward PE of 12.8...It's a keeper...
KHC was on my buy list but I bought GIS instead. So very glad I did now.
Closes 52 week high ahead of earnings
closing at highs..strong couple.days..need to break past 33.50 to make headway upward
Mac and cheese please! hot dogs with ketchup oh yes!

Happy National Hamburger Day!
There is some heavy buying under the surface. Almost 4 million share bought Friday on the ASK and again today another 2.6 million on the ASK. Someone knows something or maybe it is Buffet increasing his position before earnings. Either way it is definitely not some chump retail investor buying almost $200 million in share in the last two days.
whoa. take a glimpse of call option tables today. surging.
"Warren Buffet, being the largest stock holder is indicationof significant earnings growth."

Wells Fargo, used to hold GE now KHC..That huge writeoff of 15 billion over previous acquisitions tho, makes me wonder if this fast food in a box company is attempting to sell itself.

Could someone be attempting to take this private?
"Basically, if you aren’t long get out. It breached to a new low. Technically, it’s standing on shaky ground. If you are a dividend hore like me, maintain course!"
Sent out an email to Soros and Ackerman camps. We need an activist to get involved now to avoid 3G and Berkshire from stealing this behemoth for under $50/share. You know they will tell shareholders that $50 is a great deal but it isn’t for those in at $70-$97
Beautiful up trend and back to $96.
Even Buffett said that they overpaid. He miscalculated the staying power of old established brands. Younger consumers don’t just buy the same brands their entire lives the same way previous generations did. That lowers the natural value of brands in the KH portfolio. You can’t just put the same product on the shelf unsupported by marketing and expect great results simply because that’s the brand you had when you were a kid.
"I am long on this. I did buy a lot as a new investor and watched it drop like a rock afterwards. I’m a buy and hold kind of person. It seems stable now. I actually like the new CEO. I do think Its oversold and is gonna touch 30 next week. I really love Heinz products. I’m still working on loving Kraft products. The Kraft salad dressings are good, and I’m not ashamed of admitting I love cheese whiz, and KD sometimes. I think KHC could easily get I to the veggie meat burger industry."
Who bails out two days before ex-div date? Those with inside information. I got in after the first plunge at an average of $32.85 but this puppy is making a tough market tougher for me. Thought of bailing out last week but now I'll sit it out for the news.
Berkshire owns 27% and Buffett's successor is at the board... What the heck is this analyst thinking ?
anyone else ever see anything like this? delayed earnings like this?
"My fellow Americans,1. The Ex-Dividend Date is tomorrow: Aug-20-20192. So, you will get $0.40 per share, if you buy today3. That explains why the price is up today.4. Tomorrow, we may see the price going down again, after the Dividend investors locked in their shares to get paid the 40 cents dividend5. So, will KHC go down tomorrow? Dividend analysts will say yes... But you never know...Peace!"

Buffet selling everything but khc. He loves the divy and knows this bad boy will just kick out even more divy 2 years from now
Expect dramatic move as sellers are exhausted
Been saying since it was at 89 (you can look) that this is vastly over valued. Last warning was right here 21 days ago when I said it was inevitable it would go under 50. Let's look at this disaster of a company. It's now paying 80% of revenue to dividends. Revenue was up 1.6% until you realize inflation was at 2.1% so in fact revenues are down. The dividend needs to be cut and very possibly will be in the next 12 months. Eps were also down 7%. So let's be clear this company is shrinking and has been for many qtrs. At the now lower 52.00 the PE is still a whopping 14.1 for a company that is contracting. Fair value is about 43-44 dollars.
Where is the plan that is to be out in Jan?

"Dividend SHOULD have been cut for a minimum of 3 years to bring down debt. Reason it wasn’t was entirely due to Buffet who wants to milk the company for everything he can get and then swoop in with an expensive financing offer(think 10%-12% debt) to finish them off. If you are a stockholder, Buffet is ONLY thinking of himself, NOT you! If you think I am way out on a limb on this, just watch the next 3 years..."

You guys remember when KHC tried to buy UN for 150 billion just a few years ago? LOL Now UN has a 160B market cap and KHC (38B) has done nothing but fail at every turn since. 3G and Buffet really did destroyed what were once 2 iconic brands.
"KHC visits a tick up sh price for few days: this is owed to at least three reasons: one is prominent and well respected ratings companies, and a few hedge funds, are starting to acquire options. secondly, 30.50 seemingly is holding. this number is indelible and needed for most of the year. this support portends 34.60 earlier rather than later 2020. remains to be seen. third: as i stated several days ago, and again, ratings analyst KHC maverick news, is the absent negative news to be associated with februrary 20. other words, no news may equal good direction."

"If you want to own shares of KHC NOW is the time to buy. If you keep thinking, ""I'll wait for it to go down $1"" you're a fool. $48 was a great entry point for anyone wanting shares and obviously the current PPS is an even better entry point. Don't try to call a bottom because you may miss out on a great investment. With the divi and long term growth prospects this is one of the better investments in the market right now. Don't listen to the naysayers, or as I like to call them shorts, because they have an agenda. Their revenue is not going to go down. I have to think KHC is working on new products and I believe they have a pretty good team in place even if most longs don't believe that. At $47 plus this is worth buying and if it goes to $46 I believe some BIG money investors will be buying every share they can get their hands on and KHC will be $50 before you can buy any shares."
"Oh the irony. Buffet hated MDLZ and wanted nothing to do with them when a merger was bandied about. MDLZ has beaten 3/4 qtrs and 1 meet, bet he wished he was still in MDLZ rather than KHC."
"Before you get carried away take a look at the financials. Lower Rev's, accounting tricks help them do better on earnings. Not impressive.

"CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANYWe lift our 12-month target by $5 to $40, 14.9x our '21 EPS estimate of $2.68 (up from $2.63) and in line with the peer average multiples but a discount to its historical average (17x). We introduce our '22 EPS estimate at $2.88. KHC posts Q4 adj-EPS of $0.80 vs. $0.72, $0.06 above consensus. Organic sales grew 6.0% Y/Y, only a slight deceleration from the previous quarter (6.3% Y/Y) despite the McCafe exit and steep foodservice declines. Adj-EBITA margins grew over 180 bps to 25.8%. KHC guides for flat to positive organic sales growth in 2021 and low-single digit adj-EBITDA growth (ex-FX). KHC also agreed to sell its Nuts business to Hormel Foods for $3.35B, its second major sale announcement over the past year (also will sell the Natural Cheese business for $3.2B). These divestitures are in line with KHC's transformation plan outlined last year and should allow KHC to pay down debt and invest in other high-growth areas. We keep our Buy as there should be upside to EPS as the turnaround strategy is executed."

"Tremendous stock.Don't look at the 2 year performance.Don't read the thick book annual report.Market research. He bought ketchup, she bought mustard,,,Unfortunately irrelevant. When your sales value per unit falls, you're falling behind with every sale."
This stock is a value stock.. it will likely do well in 2021
"there should be little movement this forthcoming week with Holiday thursday. expect 31 this week. i would be disappointed if KHC could not regain 31, or more to close out Friday. Very little volume this week as well."
31.60 level breached. New 52 week low. Bearish... Depends on the closing price of course but I would not buy until it hits 31
I feel a great comeback in the air!!!
"Poor Buffett. He's in the roach motel now. Got in but can't get out. Even if he tries to get out, it will take him a long time. 10 day average volume is 26.5 mil or so. If Buffet is 20 percent of the daily volume it would take every trading day for the next 3 months for him to get out.Let that sink in....."
We will linger between here and $45 until the earnings are reported. $55 Guarantee!!!
Road to recovery.One small step at a time.
As expected KHC is hesitating right at the gap fill of 29.50. Shorters come in then. When we finally break through the gap fill that will be a very bullish sign.
I see one more dividend cut to 1.25 a year about a 4% divy on a 31.00+ stock price.
More like KFC... cuz all I'm seeing is fried chicken.
"This will affect so many people today especially those retirees with most of their money in this loser. Also, those currently working with most of their retirement funds locked up in this loser. Yeah, it was considered so safe. So many of these feckless analysts who have strong BUYS on this loser only trying to protect their jobs with spin on why the company is still strong after these disastrous results. Gen Xers, millennials are just not using these type products anymore. The game has changed. This stock is no longer a 'safe' stock. On the contrary, it is one to avoid and only 'play it' for short term gains or losses (if you are shorting). I don't see any reason to be long in this loser. It's a GEEZER stock now and what was once a strong company based on strong fundamentals is NOW just a stock of the past with its customers either dying or changing diets to more healthy foods.And there are other companies in the food industry like this one that should be avoided and never considered for investment.They are just 'geezer' stocks just like the ole' fart LIBERAL Warren Buffett. It's a 'bye gone' era."

Folks please don’t hold on tmr! Let me sell first! This is my retirement fund!
"I had a look at KHC's 10-Q form for 3Q2020. Its current ratio (CR) is approx. 1.3. Contrast this with KHC's CR of approx. 1.1 for the 2Q2020. The most recent CR represents about a 20% improvement qtr-on-qtr. Although in no way could that be called a spectacular improvement, it does signify that KHC is being solidly and prudently managed."
Should be an interesting weekend and Monday morning with Warren Buffetts letter coming out over the weekend and him speaking on Squawk Box on Monday morning..expect to see a nice upward swing.
Look forward next quarter earnings without accounting adjustments.

"as rates rise stock purchases will contract. KHC will NOT be affected in our opin. div, even if reduced, coupled with already released forward glowing report of earnings, should be cause for even strong growth. hope you picked up 0,000 yesterday for your trust."

The Kraft Heinz Co. is joining forces with the UFC Performance Institute to launch a new P3 Portable Protein Pack. KHC size can come up with innovation products and can easily grap the protein market.
did they buy a whole bunch of shares so the options are in the money?? lolol thats what they did they pumped it up so expiring options are in the money lolol manipulators.
"KHC still making money, the company is financially stable. 2 billion in cash sitting around each year to go to debt, no problem. Delicious unhealthy food. Just overspent in 1 quarter, better not happen again and we can all get rich soon."
This will rise by $5 as early as next week. Back over $50 within 3 months. Too many big stakes in there.

Haven't seen a post in a long time with you bragging about your $1,000 bottles of merlot. Hope you have enough money for next month's rent. LOL"
Remember changes in millennial patterns pertaining to eating habits and nutritional habits. Could have a long term effect on company revenues for sometime. I just think there is time before this stock Forms a bottom
What did Jim Cramer say about KHC? Seriously. Just curious.
Hope we can hold 28.50 today.

"As recently as June 1, 2017, investors valued KHC at $11.3 billion. Today they value it at $4.02 billion. Only about $4 billion of that decline belongs to Berkshire, so a lot of other funds are nursing rather large wounds, along with the pain of all the indivdual investors."

Nearly 2 year bottoming pattern seems complete.Love the value and dividend; (relatively) new CEO with fresh perspective and marketing expertise; 2 billion eyed in cost savings over next few years; investor presentation from Fall 2020 worth a watch.We could skate to $35 range over next few weeks in midst of strong uptrend back to $60++.Accumulating shares and LEAPS.
6.2% dividend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I know a lady, who knows a lady that works at McDonald's in Omaha. She serves Buffet every morning.

All in for the dividend!
I can’t believe this hasn’t hit 12 yet. Give it another week. You can make a lot of money betting against Warren. Can you say “out of touch “

"276,705 traded after hours... 1 trade for 1,400 shares went at 26.92.. Poor guy. everything else in the $29 range"
This company is flat out on sale. You get a nice yield along with value. Are the markets to focused on momentum?
this dog is going to just keep on rolling over
Anyone see a KHC CAG merger? Food costs could dictate. Any other merger possibilities?
Good news is Both Grandpa Warren and 3G global needs to cough up a few more billions $ to take it private and salvage their reputation. The bad news is they might want it cheaper from the current price.
whoa. over 20x's average volume. come on buffet buy this company
Don’t complain Buffett. He is a wise grandpa compared with his generation and honestly admitted many times this is his mistake investment.
Buffet is King. He won’t let us down. We are safe with khc. Buffet is loyal ‘till the end.

"KHC was grounded by the management - they cut marketing costs and R&D costs which made it impossible to protect the brand. Even if you have a well known product, you still have to advertise to keep that brand alive. What is surprising is that BoD let CEO do all that year after year and stock price kept going down year after year. Even big investors like Buffett didn't intervene. Everyone behaved badly. KHC is fixable but it needs a strong management team."
bottom is near. volume is trailing off today
This KHC stock is way undervalued. Book value is a bit over $40.00 a share. With the cheese deal for 3.2 billion and the likely Mr. Peanut deal for 3 billion those sales will significantly reduce their debt to levels that keep the dividend rock solid . Lowering the debt should also increase stock price as well. KHC makes about 6.5 billion a year profit which they intend to use some of that to further reduce debt each year so owning KHC for the next several years is a no brainer. Easy money!
Debt not a problem as sales are 25 billion profit 8 billion plus = sustained dividend and stock price appreciation. Still not too late to flip your short position to long and enjoy the ride.
"I was looking for a good entry point but goodwill and intangible assets of $ 84B really blows my mind !A big chunk of that 80% are just artificial assets... When that stuff writes off during this Corona event you've stepped on a boobytrap. Falling retail prices, declining revenue and rising costs will take this stock to a meager $10-$12 stock. I'm not saying this company isn't successful but it's way overvalued considering market cap."
"BUFFETT CAN PAY OFF KHC DEBT TOMORROW IF HE CHOOSES TO, THEN PROFITS GO THRU THE ROOF . THERE ARE NOT MANY OTHER OPTIONS IN TODAYS WORLD TO GET THAT KIND OF RETURN ON YOUR MONEY....PLUS BEING IN A POSITION TO MAKE ALL THE CALLS AND RUN THE SHIP TO BUFFETTS LIKING !!!"
Going for mayo buiness
"Curious, Who stopped eating Ketchup? Thumbs Up if you did."
"It’s always a little green AH then a big drop the next day! Institutions know how to accurately play KHC and still make big money even in down term. Don’t be innocent and think Buffett bought above 30. Yes he bought when it was 30+, but he didn’t pay at 30+ from level II market. There is even an article writes about how to calculate the final price he actually paid. The calculation comes out to be still profitable for him even if KHC heading down to be teens."
"I don’t care about earnings, I want this virus bump in sales to translate to debt reduction. And many decades of dividends to come "

"Every single day, albeit slowly, society moves closer to a world consumption based on naturals and organics.Kraft and Heinz produce foodstuffs which are generally know for being 100% artificial, and at some point during production, there includes exposure to toxic pesticides, chemicals and antibiotics.The stock has been plummeting since late 2016 and will continue to decline unless the company immediately embraces organic and natural product lines.This company urgently needs to fire 90% (minimum - no 2nd chances or excuses) of all management and decision makers, and begin an entirely new path to modern food trends. All involved in the last 3 years obviously do not see the writing on the wall and need to be eliminated. An entirely new team with instinct and the ability to play chess is instantly critical. If 2000 people need to be axed, regardless of hierarchy positions, so be it.If within the next month or so, Kraft neglects to launch a global advertising campaign stating something to the effect of ""Kraft is planning on helping people live happier and healthier lives by beginning to convert our products to natural and organic over the next 5 years..."" etc, than I strongly suggest shareholders sell. (unless, of course, you need the write-off).Good luck Kraft/HeinzPS: I could save this company in a heartbeat and I did not even finish high school!"
bottom. hold this level on 5 min chart. and double bottom on 15min
I didn't see many stocks that were up today and many that took significant hits. When selling hits the market like it did today everything gets hit..
Could be more hurt ahead for KHC BUT good news can see stock pop.
Higher in six months back to $45 like ibm nvda intel even Walmart went from 108 down to 85 on earnings and online miss
If they don’t hire me as CEO ASAP there going to fail a American icon sad can’t keep up with the little guys anymore they need change and I’m the man for the job !!!! Period
Shorts playground today. Good opportunity for a buy
Stock going to 40Always buy a good company on bad news!
"To all the pumpers and cheerleaders announcing the magnificent purchases you made yesterday.....Take heart in knowing that you are in the company of Warren Buffett, the ""Oracle of Omaha""....he admitted that he overpaid too."
sell off doesn't end in few days... just saying
Americans meat intake is 25% processed meats unchanged in 18 years
"Said it already, saying it again. BUFFET WAS NOT WRONG! BUY and HOLD this is a complete gift."
"Investments into KHC is basically anticipating an economic downturn. Notice any mention of stimulus it drops. Every time. Keep buying, this bubble is going to pop eventually, and KHV will become the winner..."
very cheap
"Gary, somebody bought over 100 million shares of this company on Friday. They see tremendous value long term. No question this was a bad hit but for the long pull I think we will do well, I am a buyer on Monday. They have 39,000 employees dedicated to getting the job done. No one else on earth can serve 300 million Americans macaroni and cheese, week in and week out...."
"They need to lower there prices, all the another ketchup including organic brands are cheaper....."
See you at 45 in a few weeks! Planters offload was terrific
buffet on khc...debt will be.paid down with current dividend in tact..sees no issue paying down debt
They have enough cash flow and income to pay off debt and pay the dividends
Entry price is $30.83. Giving you a dividend yield of 5.19%. Anything above that will get you in the red.
Very touching and sensitive super bowl ad . Absolutely love it
Switch to the only company producing the 5G wirelese chips: QCOM. that is where massive gains will be.
Rare 1980s Coca-Cola opportunity repeating itself.
Here’s one of the Links fro my early post on Goldman’s downgrade https://seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3561613-apple-cut-to-sell-20-downside-goldman
My guess is Buffett buying up as much as he can before his interview on CNBC on Monday morning from 6:30 till 9:30 am.
A slow growth condiment company that is being investigated by the SEC....What wouldn't you love about that?
"Anything but Heinz. That is what I heard a lady in our local grocery store say last week. Omg, hahaah"
"you have been witnessing over the past months smart money leave the ""bloated"" tech sector and move into KHC . Keep watching."
Breaking about even thanks to my puts. You can continue to give me a thumbs down but management has to change.We must get out of the past and into the future!
Retail U.S. consumer here and just started buying some new Kraft Heinz organic products. So am also buying the stock.
"i believe we will.close.the gap and.get into the 40,s at some point"
"Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC) is trading at a 40% valuation discount versus its peers and represents a good buying opportunity for investors, according to BofA Securities."
KHC is the biggest benefited from Super Bowl ads. Ppl can’t easily buy Honda cars but always can grab some KHC snack anywhere anytime. That’s the power of the staple! Especially this historical brand which shares so much memories with Americans raised up alone with the right taste!
Jumped in.
"If Pepsi co can have its Macaroni & Cheese flying off the shelf, so will KHC"
Buying back 1B notes is best news I heard.
"n-The general market is just having a correction which will end next week before moving onto new all time highs.The consumer staples etf XLP is close to finishing its own correction.At 6 P/E on a major defensive stock like KHC,you will find no safer equities investment at this point in time.Just wait until after earnings and if it starts running up in price,you will still get a great price.I will be buying KHC next Wednesday whatever the reaction to earnings is."
Great value
ppl must have a lot of money if they're buying this nonsense.
Only reason I have been holding a small position here for the past several years is in hope of KHC making a large purchase.
"Cramer is right ""Hogs get slaughtered"" was going to sell my 1K shares two years ago @ 100 but it only got to 96 so I didn't pull the trigger now I'm holding the bag."
Buffets team buying the stock while he talks. Prepare for the Pop at 9:30am
"We’re looking at a $40 within ten days. For the longs, enjoy your handsome profits! "
"Buy now,,,,See yaa at $35 on friday..buffett is not selling"
Report seems to be in line with expectations. I guess people wanted much more.
"According to analyst, everyone will stop eating.. sell KHC"
Walking into our local food market here . Well what you know I hear a kraft Heinz ad on the radio !!
"Premarket they were in the green a few cents, i thought they were going to let me down but again they came thru now there in the red way to go KHC"
"Mr Kraft makes statement ""I Dindu Nuffin""!!!!"
"@Stock Trader ""style"" (according to him) overpay for company declining for 2 years, suffering credit downgrade, SEC Investigation, bad earnings report, 36% Dividend cut, hold for a month and make 15%."
You guys ready for another dividend cut?
Oversold
Great perhaps I will have wage for the company well done travel on crates been a long deed. Company will buy how’
Gonna unload the stock if it climbs into the 40's again
"Should be 35 within 2 weeks, the uptrend toward high 30's is clear at this point."
Reasons to buy.... here we go! gl
Looking to buy in @ $27
Don’t you love these buys . Hold for the future !
"If people eat out less due to fear of corona virus that means they're gonna eat more at home. However they eat they will probably eat about the same which means more package foods and more easy cheap foods. Definitely doesn't hurt package goods products, if anything it would give it a boost!"
This stock is placed right where it should be . Great time to buy in for Kong’s !
If anyone thinks Buffet/3g aren’t tendering a $35-40 bid for the rest of KHC they are fooling themselves
Same bozo at CS will upgrade to conviction buy list when KHC hits $40.
Finally!https://youtu.be/KDn_qahFTr8
is this warren buffett's stock?
selling remaining sharesand leaving this Turkey
went to see how many brands of mayo are available at Walmart and was surprised to see so many and at the same price or lower than the KHC stuff.
Not good for Mr. Buffett. Should have bought Disney instead of KHC.
"This is a bargain, just bought 2,500 shares at $32.10 on margin. My gut feeling tells me this is a steal and it has to bounce soon. This is bottom."
It says dividend 1.67 but I got 0.4 per share. Has yahoo not updated yet? Or I'm missing something?
The turn-around is real..!!
Should be trading 35-40$ given EPS
I wonder if Buffet regrets getting involved with this deal?
I hope they crush it
This stock is a buybuybuybuybuybuybuy!
Say good bye to that $25 print tomorrow. Markets are up on lite buying and this stock loves to give money away to faithful bag holders.
"Ohhh JP, you should to respect the technicals! ...or you're letting your clients load up now that you see the compelling valuation. Nonetheless, I couldn't disagree more, I'm a fundamental investor that understands technicals, both line up nicely here."
"People, STOP and get a hold of yourself. There isn’t a single KRAFT-HEINZ product in my grocery store and I live in the sticks that is just getting gentrified.They are losing out to smaller and more nimble brands. On the other side they are losing out to house-brands. With over $30 million in debt this is dead in the water.We are no where near the bottom or the turn around point. With that being said very few markets have catalysts. I have owned KHC and cut my losses at 60. Played a for a few swings since that were short and sweet.You want something that is further along in the cycle then check out frac sand. The dirty little secret is frac said completed its downturn of a cycle this quarter as they had theirs with oil the last few years and sand specific issues last year and earlier this year.Drillers have stopped drilling!!! But this is actually good news. Because there are more DUC wells than ever. Wells that are drilled but not completed. From here on out they will be taking capital for drilling and reallocating to completions which require the frac sand. My favorite names are sand plays $cvia, $hcr and then these guys who actually do the pumping and completing of the well, $ftsi.The beauty is the stocks are so cheap that management is buying back shares. That is how you do buybacks!!! Spend it when you can buy the shares cheap. Not like the fake companies out there borrowing to buy back shares at all-time highs. These sand plays had some tough times and they learned to swim.I truly believe these names will outperform anything in the market in the next 1-2 years. The world needs oil and nat gas. Our consumption of the later is growing thru the roof on a worldwide basis."
reality is reality .....right now its a 26.50 stock the real question is ..... are there better places to put your money?
"KHC MDLZ and HSY and we have all three in our trust. HSY results today are viewed encouraging. while you may suspect that HSY product and marketing has NO relation to KHC, we take opposite view. true, KHC has let us down, but it isn't a BGS, which we sold last year. no, MDLZ and HSY have similar econ patterns to that of KHC. further, KHC has a large capital backstop arguably larger than HSY. should you add 00,000 sh today to your trust, and only you know. of course, if you are in the option camp with puts at 25, which are costly, well you know what to do?"
"I would say this. KHC has been much improved in terms of operations and efficiency. Efficiency is a key, this is not about saving costs, it is about how to get the operation continue improvement. The keys are they also improved the advertisement and targets only for couple of strong brands. In a few years, this stock will flight high to 40 to $50 range at least and good dividend while waiting. this is another positive, Warren Buffett has been very very supportive. he put his two people on board to KHC to oversee the company. I love it..it is getting much better everyday."
"Baby faced Jared Kushner, has invited Hunter Biden, forlunch at the Kosher Pizza Palace in Brownsville."
I'm calling bottom
No downside now right?
I hope I can buy at $29.
i believe this will close the gap at some point..will be a rocky road..more goodwill write downs along the way..but.dividend looks solid while you wait..better path than one year ago
The market is here to stay folks . America is open for business !
Just to set the record straight some bashers here say that the divi was cut in half. More like a 36% reduction.
added more shares ...love this set up
"Buffett faults Trump for the greatest economy in the history of the country? Ok, that is what a leftist does when things don't go well they blame others, however, if Buffett invested say $100B in roku on 26-Dec-2019 and made a cool $100B in just two months would he have given Trump all the credit for a great economy? Or would he have happily taken ALL the credit for himself? Lefties, never their fault, but always (when it works out) their credit."
Just waiting for a stable time to buy in .
Kraft Heinz earnings will smash estimates massively the next few quarters. Products flying off the shelf in stores.
Quarterly earnings reports. A lot of companies have already reported their June 30th earnings. This company has not even reported their March earnings.
BOYS...NOW FOR SOMETHING IMPORTANT. DAYTONA LOVED SEEING THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY. TRUMP/PENCE VERSUS BLOOMBERG/CLINTON. TRUMP WINS OVER 40 STATES. BOYS...TAKE THAT TO THE BANK !!!!
Buffet SAYING.......OH NOOOOOOOOO I MEANT 'KFC' NOT KHC !
And we all jump back into Bitcoin today. Nice
"I see nothing to motivate here. Declining sales, little innovation, Uninspiring management. I'd like the company to be successful. I certainly believe Heinz back as a stand alone company would be a winner. The massive anchor Kraft brands brings keeps this in the garbage heap,Split it back up. Allow Heinz to soar while Kraft continues to wallow. Your shareholders deserve this."
"Warren Buffet lost 4 billion in one day, hope it aint your money! Any one got money for him to invest?"
Warren Buffet hit the company hard.Cramer hit the company hard.Lots of analyst hit the company hard.Buffet is not selling. Berkshire might still buy.Buffet and Berkshire are 2 different entities.
It is not absurd it a good company gone bad. it will take months if not years to get back to 38.
"Im looking at cagQuarterly Revenue Growth (yoy) 18.3% vs khc –4.8%Net Income Avi to Common (ttm) 802.8M vs khc –10.81BQuarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) 97.90% vs khc 45.20%But they’re both disasters cag doesn’t have a lot of cash on the books and has 10Billion in debt. all these companies are heavily in debt and have a huge amount of their income going towards paying dividends and debt. And there is stiffer competition on the way. It makes no sense to buy this nonsense. The days of buying cheap food and throwing on the shelves at a huge mark up are over. This isn’t coke vs pepsi, these are base items like peanuts, ketchup and mustard. and more companies want a piece of market share."
I put in a buy order yesterday. Sure glad it didn't get down to my price. Will be looking for other opportunities.
"I bought in big in the 30 range and will let the fools talk and lambast all they want. I’ll go to sleep now and look at my 100,000 shares in a few years !!"
Could trade about $38+/- Monday when Warren speaks on CNBC
"makes sense to take it private, too much goodwill"
Kraft has little pricing power. Heinz has more. Split them up.
Will it fly????????????????
"Regarding the sec subpoena, I cannot imagine that two large funds that own half of a company wouldn’t both have there own forensic accountants that hawk over earnings and audit accounting practices on a daily weekly or very least quarterly basis. These are the big boys..they don’t just invest huge and then just walk away and trust that there money is safe.."
Question you should be asking is why is Wall Street trying so hard with the coordinated news analysts and bashing on TV to drive KHC lower before earnings come out? Does Wall Street already know that earnings are better with the price increases and needs to pick up shares of KHC ? Guarantee if they wanted out they would be telling you how good things are. I would look for KHC to blow away earnings
Why would Unilever bid for KHC now at $35......2/3 less than the price when KHC bid for Unilever.....and Unilever is up since the bid! Combination logic is essentially the same and the whole 3G squad would go as cost saving synergies!
Value fundamentals + strong technicals = grind higher
Thanks JPM! When you push it back down to $35 I suppose you will upgrade again and still keep your same $41 price target and favorable comments about management direction.It is investment herding. No different than Reddit/social media. I am long KHC. Will consider trimming my position somewhat when we are at $65.
"The Institutions, After Hearing Buffets Comments , CAN'T GET OUT FAST ENOUGH.IMHO"
Just came back from the supermarket and seen Heinz mayo ketchup. Let’s goooo khc baby !!!
IBM really went down before it's started a turn around. Every case is different but KHC may need to go down further and who knows maybe dividend may be cut. Just my wild guess.
Looks like they're listening. It's about time. https://www.campaignlive.com/article/kraft-heinz-puts-600-million-global-media-account-review/1677778
"When colleges and schools reopen, the foodservice business will start to recover and that’s money!!"
I would rather put my money to work in ATT. At least T has better growth prospects down the line.
I say: Buy when there is ketchup flowing on the streets !
Shorting time disappears slowly but steadyHang on
KHC is a golden stock. World will continue eating food. Buffet is a major shareholder. Buy the dip.
"Bernard Hees and the rest of the 3G clowns have got to go. Private equity has destroyed so many companies, when will they learn?"
I muted about 5 of the doomsday pessimists SCREAMERS and more coming up.How many of these paid slave are on payroll?
Cutting the dividend is really not funny.
Debt larger than market cap.....Doh!!
the shorts are out in force in this board..wow..so much anger
"Well, It yielding almost 6 percent now at todays price 5.82.percent. What's next dividend cut to nothing to pay down debt and stop the nose bleed."
When this is $70 in a few years they will be talking about buffet being genius again collecting dividends for years
buying more tomorrow..trying to accumulate a big position with average price
Screaming buy.
ouch
"why the sell off , buy any dip me think ."
Here we go!!!!! https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555014-jpmorgan-bullish-on-kraft-heinz
Pandemic ain't going anywhere. KHC will be stockpiled again.. more consumers will rediscover their love for the comfort brands they grew up with - and millennials will discover what they've been missing. The turnaround continues. And upgrades are coming. Stay the course people.
All the goofs that followed Warren into this....omg
If the overall market doesn’t stabilize then there we be a change of the dinner menu...Mac & cheese will become an entree rather than a side order...
Ever since Patricio fired 3G CFO a year ago every thing financial is right on old cfo basilo doing awesome job
fact is they are paying the dividend .40c. and may continue to do so..could sell Maxwell house and pay off some debt and others and continue to pay dividend with no issue..all the shorts are constantly trying to bad rap a company that makes a profit with 6 billion in sales a quarter and cash flow up the ying yang..so they can fool some poor fool into selling scared too early so they can get 1c on a short trade..don't sell this anytime soon..the turn has just begun..40+ is in the cards by next spring
KHC Board needs to call in the SEC for all the miss information from so called Wall Street news of earnings 5/1/2019 or for insider trading if the date of 5/23/2019 earnings date is correct. Either way it is someone is trying to control and manipulate KHC stock price and it up to the board to protect the Company and it's shareholders. Call in the SEC today.
Well I thought it might hit 32 today. Could hold 33 after all. But it will be close. last 30 min will be interesting.
"FCF margin is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by its Revenue. The Kraft Heinz Co's Free Cash Flow for the three months ended in Sep. 2019 was $532 Mil. The Kraft Heinz Co's Revenue for the three months ended in Sep. 2019 was $6,076 Mil. Therefore, The Kraft Heinz Co's FCF margin for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2019 was 8.76%."
a lot of this was stop loss triggers. it will go back up
going to be a great earning
Big Whales Buying Thoughts on Dividend Play Shorts not wanting 2 Payout?
"The vast majority of assets are intangibles and goodwill...Its fluff... Tens of billions in debt, and not even 2 billion in cash... slightly concerning. Dividend is good but I think more value would be created if they worked on improving this clearly soft balance sheet banking some cash."
Don’t sell!!!
Is that a kraft grilled chees sandwich or short sellers cooking on the grill?
"wow, everyone wants in"
"BOYS......BARRONS BELIEVES BUFFETT MAY BE LOOKING AT WALLGREENS ALSO. FACT IS, BUFFETT COULD BUY THEM BOTH LOCK, STOCK AND BARRELL WITH CASH AND STILL HAVE 25 BILLION LEFT OVER."
"Corrections and Amplifications: An earlier version of this story stated that Kraft Heinz earnings were set for Wednesday, July 17 . That date was an estimate based on prior first-quarter reporting dates. This year's first-quarter reporting date has not yet been set."
"Consumer staples is always a great place to have your money during inflationary times. Before going dark, Dr. Burry spoke of the potential for ""weimer-style inflation"" in the U.S. With these beliefs, and the obvious upside upon fixing the balance sheet, Kraft Heinz is a great buy. It also really highlights his concern for the current market-conditions. Additionally, he has purchased shares in other companies in similar situations. Lumen, CoreCivic, Geo Group, Citi, and Holly Frontier are all examples. These are reputable companies that are or were undervalued mostly due to trouble on the balance sheet. Don't forget, inflation favors the borrower because when it's time to pay back all that debt, the amount of debt may not have changed, but the value of the dollar will have."
If this break 36$ that’s key!
looks like a tea pot handle. I like tea
Any shorts will be on a buying binge today!
strong day
"less than 28.00 I think kraft is not very risky . When we get there maybe the virus will have eased some , things are changing so fast its best to move in small steps."
what is wrong with this stock
"Unfortunately, there may be more downside to this. People would rather spend their money on fancy electronics than buy a great, delicious, quality product like Kraft and Heinz."
I like this stock.This is not a get rich quick stock.I fully expect an annual return of about 10% between cash dividends and price appreciation.We will slowly melt back up to $50 in about 2 years.No rush. I can enjoy life and sleep at night.
KHC will only go up long-term.
@BaBy maybe at 1/2 of current price since warren no longer wants to overpaid lol according to the interview

"This stock has ps ratio of 1.3, in comparasion coke cola has ps ratio of #$%$ a lifetime buy opportunity here.BUY BUY BUY BUY."
Slashing the Div to 0.05/Q frees up about 425 million every qtr or 1.7B a year. Anyone here know of a struggling company that could use nearly 2B extra a year in FCF? Management still thinks its 2015 and this merger is a match made in Buffet heaven. Reality still has not set in and it will continue to bleed market cap and market share until it does.
Amazon could be a good candidate to buy this company and continue their expansion in the supermarket business. Watch out shorts !!
Didn’t I hear somebody else say we should be in the pizza business?
great to see some money spent.on marketing superbowl..hope they are.funny

"I've got 16 tons(of Velveeta) and what do you get, another day older and deeper in debt!"
Don't worry. Warren Buffet loves us and wants us to be happy. He will take care of us.
Good buy at 18
Don’t care what Buffet gets on his preferreds as long as I get the common cheaper than his $31. Will buy at the close and tomorrow exdiv
could be.huge winner on.earnings date..would like to see no write down quarter one.time
"Thrust me, it will gain all the lost points it lost within next 14 days. ."
25 coming
Did anyone honestly believe that 3g and buffet were going to let anyone hurt their investment. There is either going to be a tender for the rest of the shares they don’t own at $35-40 or they will reduce the debt to zero and retool the company to print money. One way or another the bear raid is done and the climb back to $100 begins. Mark this post.
"The break out is a great sign after a long side way pattern. ADD MORE. 4 Analysts upgrade in Jul in the Analysis section. Buy a strong consume staple business below book value is a bargain. Technically, it shows strong momentum"
Still dragging their feet on financial report. not a good sign.
"Wow, bullish Heinzi! If we brake 36 we go to 44."
Buffett is in love with Heinz and Kraft...great bones and heritage distribution channels...he will take your free money.
"Strong buying at close, very bullish. 32.50 next week."
"KHC SHOULD GET TRID OF THE DIV. AND SAVE THE $2 BILLION,,,USE IT TO PAY DOWN THE $30 BILLION OF LTD...IF THE KILLED THE DIV. THE SHARE PRICE WOULD GO UP $5.00..."
That is just about the flattest daily trading curve I have ever seen. Ranging from $34.51 to $36. Someone has been buying BIG today.
So what do you guys think about Cramer and Barron's negative outlook just before it took off? Like when it was 25 three days ago. How can anyone trust Creamer?

"These guys have no chance long term, not only are people moving away from high sugar/salt content products but also those that want it can buy alternatives so much more cheaply.Here in the UK, you can buy supermarket own brand products that taste just as good for a fraction of the price. A Heinz Tomato Sauce selling for £1.75 in a local supermarket compared to their own brand (Batts) is 45p -- the Batts tastes as good if not better -- that's a price differential of 3.8 times -- madness.Either Heinx is going to continue to lose massive market share or they will have to slash prices by more than half to compete and maintain any semblence of the volumes they used to sell.How will they handle all that debt?"
"seems to be a coordinated effort to ""talk"" khc lower..barons certainly leading the pack..very suspicious..without financials it is all speculation put forth as fact..I believe they are waiting for new CEO to release financials and plan going forward..I will wait it out and ignore all the ""experts"". time will tell who is bs."
"The things they don't want you to know, If you want to sell and get the most for your shares is sell the Jan 17 2020 $35 strike call you will get paid almost $3 for it and you will get the dividends until someone takes you stock from you. That will get you almost $5 more for your shares than selling them today plus it will protect you for $3 to the downside. Much smarter way to sell than selling your shares today."

"Selling the cheese division to pay down debt is a weird move... You just lose future revenue and profits... You want a company to grow and to invest, not the other way around ! Here they are selling the equivalent of 7% of their revenue... if the goal is to pay down debt, it seems better to cut the dividend by half for example... And how could the divy become more sustainable with less profits ? Their debt was precisely downgraded because they did not cut the divy, and i agree with that... Comments appreciated !"
"When the big investors give up on kHC,a bad earning call is around the corner. Still a good value play over time!"

looks like a amazing buy atm? what yall think?
if you have McDonald's in your portfolio I highly suggest that you sell!
"Chop, chop, chop to $30?"
"I don't get why dividens cut should be so terrible, more free cash flow means less debt, or apply buybacks instead of dividend at these prices - it would be a gift"
There's no way I'm selling today. The ship just began to turn around and we're still dramatically undervalued.
"Kraft Heinz Stock Is Sliding on the Latest Bad News -- Barrons.com10:07 am ET March 18, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Teresa RivasKraft Heinz stock (ticker: KHC) is drifting lower again on Monday, following news that its 10-K filling will be delayed.The Back Story. Plenty of consumer-staples stocks suffered in 2018, and Kraft was one of the hardest hit, tumbling in November on disappointing third-quarter earnings, a poster child for the argument that safe stocks that don't look so safe anymore. However, Kraft went from a lagging staple to a much more worrisome story in February, when it reported fourth-quarter results. Not only did those -- and its guidance -- disappoint, Kraft also slashed the dividend, logged a $15.4 billion asset write-down related to its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, and disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating its procurement division's accounting practices since October 2018.Not surprisingly, a number of analysts downgraded the stock over the weeks that followed, and Kraft is down 49.5% in the trailing 12 month period. It's off nearly 26% since the start of the year, with even Warren Buffett admitting he was wrong on the stock.What's New. Late Friday, Kraft said that it wouldn't be able to meet the deadline to file its 10-K with the SEC. It now has 60 days to file an action plan for the document, and the company expects to do so in the coming weeks.The news is not exactly surprising, given all the moving parts that Kraft warned of last month, including the investigation that the agency is pursuing. Yet it's enough to push the shares down again Monday.Looking Ahead. Back in November 2017, Barron's warned that staples softness would persist, a thesis that's held true for Kraft -- and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP), which is up just under 8% year to date, trailing the market. As we noted when news first broke, Kraft was already one of the weaker-performing packaged food companies, as it was struggling to show organic sales growth without deep discounts, and was saddled with a high debt load from private equity deals concerning its predecessor companies. It was also troubling that the company chose not to disclose the SEC investigation during its earnings in November, even though it already knew about the agency's concerns. Today's news is serious, it's the latest in a long line of bad headlines for Kraft stock, which doesn't look like a bargain, yet.W@W !"
Just enjoyed a bagel in New York with Philadelphia Brand cream cheese. Say what you will about the adverse health aspects......it was delicious !!!!!!
"Why don't they issue a press release like Campbell's did? Increasing production to help stores stay stocked with nonperishables. And why don't they make announcements of any kind regarding an increase in sales, etc. They remain too quiet. And Buffett hardly says a word about the company, his faith in the new management, etc. I don't get it."
KHC will be back to 40 MOnday Tuesday this is a no Brainer

Primal foods what a joke ! Oh eat healthy like a caveman LOL did everyone forget they only lived to be 35-40 years old ! No thank youuuuu !

Good news CFO is leaving.

"WOW ! KHC SUSPENDING GUIDANCE ! WOW !Kraft Heinz Will No Longer Give Guidance -- Market Talk10:54 am ET August 8, 2019 (Dow Jones) Print10:54 ET - Kraft Heinz has decided to stop giving guidance about its expected financial results, executive says, as the company tries to get its arms around a host of challenges. ""We have a big agenda to build,"" CEO Miguel Patricio says on an investor call. ""I think that working on short-term targets will not help."" Patricio, who took over the CEO job at Kraft in June, also says he needs more time to evaluate the business."
Bernardo Hees (fired KHC CEO) receives a pro-rated bonus (6 months) of $1.084 million. Nice to see that KHC rewards abject failure so richly.This company is a joke.
"Wave of consolidation in the packaged foods industry is coming.... way too fragmented now....GIS-KHC and CPB-K combos would be ideal. General Mills will bid for KHC soon, it has to, it’s business is not doing any better than Kraft’s, can only improve by cost cutting."
This hurts....
Do Chinese even use ketchup?
"Definitely turning around, up 50% last 12 months. Long term holder reinvesting dividends.the"
When you go to the store later . check your isles and see how ketchup is doing on the shelf . !
"Ex-dividend date approaches stock has maintained around $34.25, oversold conditions. Folks it’s a food company we all buy from... they just need to improve their products. They have plenty of shelves space in stores. Company is a power house. This is the time to buy !!"
Consumer's staples have been beating earnings in general lately. Wouldnt be surprised if KHC follows suit.
CNBC reports Buffet not happy with 3G. If he starts selling shares we are in big trouble.
Please advise what to do.
$15 billion in market cap gone in a day
the revenue numbers don't change much..don't expect any surprises there..margin is the detail
"Bet u anything next earnings will be good. Any well run company knows how to produce 1 good earnings report when the chips are down, look at aapl. When the world is watching, u gotta know how to produce a single good quarter lol."
Can someone explain why this dropped 40 cents last night just before After Hours closed?
rollover dividends soon
"KHC behaves like a fang stock these days. Huge swings, which I'm loving."
Considering a down market . This stock is doing excellent !
Can we get a statement from Warren Buffet please? Will Warren Buffet please step up to the microphone?
Just bought low again just in time for ex-dividend again soon
"They would fix the stock price if they just said ""Hey we are making positive changes in management"" Stock would shoot up 10%"
buffet said khc did 25 billion in revenue while kirkland in costco did 39 billion
The last five days seem to indicate the bottom was passed.
"Shouldn't the wright off of 15,6 Bil $ be good for the tax benefits ?"
restate earnings..looks like this accounting issue is getting to the finsih line .I bet it turns out to be small number % wise
why are there so many financial critics after the fall of a stock?....what a joke!
Book Value Per Share (mrq) 53.64.Are sellers going nuts? short ratio is very low too.. do they have asbestos in their products too or am I missing something here?
when is ex div date?
What happened? Did the Chinese impose tariffs on Ketchup?This is supposed to be defensive stock.
Newsflash: Warren and Charlie are #$%$! They may just buy this gem just to show who?s BOSS!
they forgot to mention they still make money and have 25 billion in revenue..minor details
"The short selling is accelerating, and the volume is now x3.5 of the normal trading day volume. That's a huge sign of danger. By Friday, when the bottom falls of this stock look out for $18. Nothing can stop that."
seasoned investors well know that earnings release at this point is a red herring. long khc and continue to place buys at strategy levels. realize you had better be long on free cash.

Why would people buy today when you can get shares 40 cents less tomorrow or less.
All time lows now with a healthy dividend. I am buying and accumulating crazy not to for div alone
Wonder how management is sleeping these days?
$30 BILLION IN DEBT IS EQUAL TO ENTIRE MARKET CAP.. STOCK IS WAY OVER-PRICED!
Folks don’t believe fake news . Khc is s great stock !
Negative growth company with 16 P/E is not reasonable. I won't buy this stock unless the P/E become less than 10.
$29+ a share! Thanks JP Morgan! https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555014-jpmorgan-bullish-on-kraft-heinz
cant wait for the bad advertisement to stop. once this stock stops making headlines it will rise again
"RSI under 13, extremely oversold....will not stay at these levels for long"
Who wants to hold this stock over the weekend? The only good position for this stock now is SHORT.
I bought some Kool~Aid today. Warren Buffetts favorite drink but it did not cost me 4 billion dollars. Monday CNBC stay tuned.
"Kraft went from 48 to 34 in 1 day. I guess people don't need food anymore?I just took a position at 34. Buffets holding, saying in the long run it;s a great stock."
i'm in house of pain. avg 36 sh. did read today KHC may go private. not concerned. am buying it down again after hours. ymmv.
where these weird people with doomsday coming from?who is paying them to write page long assay on message boards?I only read 3 to 5 lines messages and mute the long ones.
Why did this stock lose so much of its value? I bought it several years ago and it’s worth less than half. It has been my worst performing stock. I haven’t sold because I feel it will improve. Just wishful thinking? Or should I sell and cut my losses?
lookin strong
$0.40/ex-div next week. I'm in.
"It is me, I am the reason this stock is not back to $48.00. I bought KHC and like many stocks before the bottom falls out. You people should pay me to sell, then you will start making money. In fact the whole market should pay me to NEVER buy any stock again."
When everybody is negative that's the time to buy. Buy low sell high people.
still enjoy KHC and M. making the fall of my tech stocks feel a lot better.
Credit Suisse slashes its price target for KH from $77 to $55.Ouch.Due to lack of product innovation and brand support.Be careful not to fall for a bull trap if KH rises into earnings May 2.That would be a sure sign of a post earnings collapse.
hire the pepsi people they dont seem to have any problems selling frito lay
"Guess the point is that Khc operating cash flow has been around the double of the paid dividend for at least the last 4 quarters. This tends to show that the present 4,5% dividend is safe, hence the solid increase in the stock price. Not a fantastic company, but still a strong cash machine"
"BOYS...HERES ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. BUFFETT, THE WORLDS GREATEST ALLTIME INVESTOR IS PLAYIN CHESS, AND EVERYONE ELSE IS PLAYIN CHECKERS. BOYS...WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TEAM WITH BUFFETT LEADING THE WAY !!!!"
"Quit pumping and trying to sucker unknowing investors into buying KHC. Most have no clue that there will be MASSIVE tax loss selling going into the end of the year and that anyone that has losses will be taking them. Why because if the DEM wits happen to win in 2020 you are going to need all the tax losses you can get piled up . FACT. All part of tax planning for the future. You will see people selling and taking gains all next year, because the tax rates will be lower than if the DEM wits win. It is always better to pay taxes at a much lower tax rate than to watch all the paper gains go up in smoke and pile up the losses if you have any to take so you don't pay taxes the whole time the DEM wits are in."
Pay out ratio is 191.27% How can they lower debt while paying lot in dividends?? Is dividends at risk??
"Awesome! A 25 bucks stock that loses 9.10 per year. And KHC wasn't even trying!Warren, i have to give it to you: When you FUP, it's always big."
I predict it will be $45 by the end of the year. These low commodity prices have to be helping their bottom line
Too much confidence in a company not running on all 4 wheels. No wonder they needed a new ceo.
"The way I see it is there is no way BYND (Beyond Meat) is worth 1/3rd if Kraft/Heinz. Even with KHC's issues, this stock is way undervalued for anyone long. They have 200 products, many iconic brands. They def need to innovate...and investin talent ...and stop the budget cuts - and they know that now."
Billionaire Democrat Warren Buffett lost millions today on Kraft/Heinz but I don’t think he will lose any sleep tonight.
I thought quarter report was coming out today. New to this game but im in on KHC
Finally getting earnings pre market tomorrow. Analysts are expecting 0.61.
About time to replace this leadership ( lack of leadership ) team.!!!!!
broke thru 31.90. Wow.
CNBC rally on Monday will be short lived as usual. The stock will be lower on Tuesday.

Great buy for dividend yield alone. This at lowest price in awhile. All in
"Warren Buffett will not be selling KHC at these low levels, especially when there average is around $58.50. I think this is a good time to buy when everyone is panicking. It’s good to know Buffect is holding lots of shares."
Credit to @bettingbruiserTomorrow I have confirmed that $MDLZ via $ACB is going to announce Mr Lance Friedman from $KHC to the BOD of $ACB. However their is no investment associated with the appointment. Peltz & Co. are not putting any money up by all accounts #PotStocks
I am of the opinion they should suspend dividends until the debt is reduced significantly. Then watch the market reevaluate the share price upward. Future earnings over and above retained earning should be used to buy back shares.
$36 by weeks end! 
Way oversold buyout setup
KHC is up 4.93% to 25.99
It's still a solid company! Need management change moving forward. today its only a paper loss for buffet. $0.4/share is still a good dividend!
ttm pe is very high
can anybody explain why Kraft stock should go down as result of the vaccine? people are not going to eat in post COVID era?
Bought in 32 24.
Saw KHC bounce off that .08ish support and rally back up yesterday. See how it goes.
"In regards to the suspension of dividend rumor, does it really matter whether the profits are paid out rather than retained to reduce debt and grow the business? Won't the scale of the marketplace eventually re-evaluate the business based on the intrinsic value growth?"
i wouldnt worry about anything. the chief growth officer is hard at work as we speak!!!
"The analysts tell us to stay away from Kraft Heinz here in the $30-range will call a strong buy when it comes back in the $50-range. Wall Street and its games. No thanks, I will just use my brain and buy now."
"Found this while cleaning up folders today.Buffett Builds Heinz Stake to 52.5% With Penny-a-Share Warrantby Selina Y WangJune 18, 2015 — 7:04 AM CDTBerkshire Hathaway Inc. increased its stake in H.J. Heinz to about 52.5 percent as billionaire Warren Buffett exercised a warrant in the ketchup maker ahead of its planned merger with Kraft Foods Group Inc.Buffett was able to add a 5.4 percent stake in Heinz for 1 cent a share under terms of the 2013 deal when Berkshire and 3G Capital took the food company private. He purchased 46.2 million shares for about $462,000, Pittsburgh-based Heinz said in a regulatory filing Thursday.Berkshire previously controlled about half the common stock, and also has preferred stake of $8 billion that pays an annual dividend of $720 million. While Buffett is on the board of Heinz, the company is managed by Jorge Paulo Lemann’s 3G, which has been slashing jobs. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire and 3G have agreed to combine with Kraft, where Lemann’s company has said it plans more cost cuts.“Efficiency is required over time in capitalism,” Buffett, 84, said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May. “I really tip my hat to what the 3G people have done”"
"The new CEO is going to want shares to appreciate to between $45 and $55 here's why,And Patricio will receive a performance-based stock award that will entitle him to receive between 200,000 and 600,000 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock, depending on the company’s stock price appreciating to between $45 and $55 per share during the first three years of his employment. If he receives these additional performance share units, he will be required to hold them for an additional 3-year period."
great set up for seasonally strong period
Huge algorithm block buying after hours. We’re ready for launch 
Sold out my position. Supposedly Buffet said he has no plans to take KHC private and might unload shares of accounting problems persist.
Oh shes a fighter!
"Glad I sold yesterday, will rebuy tomorrow Love the dividend!!!"
About to hit 38
I bought my first 700 shares.
Ok KHC Management. If ever there was a time to buy back shares this is it !!! Borrow the money if you must !!!!
CONGRATS TO ALL THAT BOUGHT TODAY @33.15LOL
When Wall Street and manipulator FAKE news reporting rag Barron's push KHC lower make sure to take advantage of it to work you cost lower. Get some cheap deep in the money call so you can take Wall Street shares later right before the next dividend is paid. Never let a good stock manipulation go to waist. Always work at lowering your cost.
"if they cut dividend and paid off debt. this would recover,,IMO"
"Alrighty, recovery all ready beginning Maxwell house possible sell off & then Buffet speak on Monday. Hang on to your hats, this was oversold on Friday probably due to stop loss triggers, this stock is going back up. GLTA"
"Just doubled my long position, EPS great, dividend great, PE great...and set to break that 34-35 wall ...with a chart pattern suggesting a quick correction to 48."
Just think we are guaranteed to lose .40 at the open on th. Ex-dividend day.
Buffet donated $3.6 billion to charity ---he could have bought 10% of KHC---if stock that dropped from $90s to $30 does not qualify as charity case I don't know what does
31 or 32 would be a 20% move. Whatever wrong with this stock will be fixed. Don't they make ketchup and macaroni and cheese?
Last time I looked KHC was a food stock.
Hellloooooo $28!
"KHC pulling on their $4 bill revolving line of credit from banks. If a company whose products are flying off the shelves thinks they need to tap into that, because they don't trust the banks that doesn't bode well for the USA."
Cheap tasty nutritious food with long shelf life back in vogue.
GOLDMAN SACHS WILL BE WRONG ON THIS ONCE AGAIN.
RSI is at 15 wow
KHC thinking of spinning off Maxwell Coffee Business Worth near 3 billion $
"KHC still trends basement. so, be mindful here. earnings beat caught many flat footed. mindful that zacks and barrons did hedge their sell post recently. that was a clue for me and i posted that. but, an earnings beat, regardless is NOT taken lightly. KHC is back in spotlight again."
So is everyone expecting an ER tomorrow as its the last day to report and then another on Thursday for the qtr that just ended? Is it even possible they release one after close tomorrow and the next before open thursday? 2 reports while the market is closed is something I have never seen before.
Asian Markets upsome more than 3% in just the first few hours. Positive outlook. U.S Markets will go upBuy Buy Buy
Have not received dividend. Isn't today payment day?
Good luck longsWe shall hear tomorrow
Someone bought another 10000 KHC October 2018 62.50 calls today!
"This stock could easily drift down to $25, just like GE keep going lower and lower before finding a bottom. with so much bad news, a bottom usually is not formed for awhile."
"Are you ready for KHC to go higher , if not you better get ready, Why because KHC is trading way lower then it should be and it will be going higher"
"Using PAC money trying to control representatives votes - political activism in connection to Kerry's wife no thanks I'm out of here!! Disinvest 2,000 shares ... there's plenty of America First companies where I can invest my money ..."
This company is red like tomato ketchup
"it needed to fall a little, the chart indicators were all thru the roof, added calls."
This is going to 30 . Book it Dano!
25+ by EOD
"Get a grip here people. At a conservative PE of 15, this is still a $50+ stock, that still pays more than a 4.5% dividend, even afer the cut. I doubled down @ $34.55, thank you sellers, you're OVER reacting."
KHC Up 2% in early trading 35.65
"Too many poor quality products in their portfolio: 1) Velvetta 2) Maxwell House 3) Kraft American singles 4) Cool Whip 5) Easy Whip 6) Shake N Bake, 7) Oscar Meyer Mystery Dogs. My family or anyone that cares about their body is not eating this If you eat this on a daily basis I can guarantee you are grossly over weight. They are losing the last few generations to companies like Kashi, Food for Life, Annie's, Amy's, Cascading Farms, Saffron Road, Barbara's Bakery and the list goes on and on."
"remember, no stock is a safe stock. diversify your bonds @#$@# https://youtu.be/zhUnEg0he4A?t=48"
Are they buying shares back ? I sure hope they start
it breaks 27.40 its down to $25 then there is zero support. so lovely.
"I blogged last Friday morning pre-market opening to SELL this loser right at the open and that would be the highest price in the near future. I was RIGHT ON on that prognostication. I still wouldn't touch this even a couple of points lower. I would probably NEVER buy it. This is a 'geezer' stock. The younger set is just not buying these products but, instead, going to more healthy foods. It is so obvious. Warren Buffett said he is not selling shares (for now) but I know he would love to exit this if and when there is any share appreciation. This stock is a LOSER now along with many packaged food stocks. Their era is gone!"
nice push back.
When I said Kraft for ever I meant it.
another unit.sold and.pay down debt 3b..nice
Well.. no growth but pays a nice dividend. Better than a bond anyway.
one of my only plays in the green on a down day. they should fetch over $3B in international cheese cuts. i’m betting on $45 by 2nd qtr 2021 with fine drip; miguel patricio cuts the cheese........
Nice move but can it hold?
argument early a.m. indicated khc hitch hiked clx beat and noted clx organic sales and households. take the help regardless from where it appears may be the theme. earnings bar unmoved for following quarters inc februrary 13. our ppc made for celebration yesterday. had to forego while sitting in ice shack in wi. no luck with fish.
perhaps most who were going to sell are now out..this could surprise in good way if they are done with write offs
Great company never going anywhere folks . America is open for business!
I think that if Buffett were younger he might buy the company. but he is pushing 90.
Whatever Berkshire Hathaway does on the next few day will determine which direction this stock is going to go. No one knows what Buffett has in mind!
"Book value over $42. Enough said.....Buy with both hands and margin as well. this goes back into the 30s within the month and 40s by year end. the bad news, actually terrible news us all out setting up a quick displayed improvement with more to follow."
"""Kraft is to investment grade as Velveeta is to cheese...The ingredients dictate what something is, and Kraft Heinz is JUNK.""Christian Hoffman, Portfolio Manager at Thornburg Investment Management.Hilarious!"
"The dividend has already been cut recently. With a dividend yield now at 5% and business failing, one could 'assume' that the dividend will be cut again going forward."
Kraft Heinz is probably better as a private company in this environment.
Doesn’t warren buffet own a boat load of shares? If khc keeps falling at the rate it is when will he bail
Let's see what happens Monday.
FOR THE LAST TIME ; Robert Kraft HAS NO CONNECTION with this company - use google or Wikipedia - NO CONNECTION WITH THIS COMPANY -------------------
"They've done well for the past year, but I'll be happier when I break even on my May2017 entry point. It was my ""sensible"" investment, made the same day I took a long position in Shopify. I've spent the past four years grinding my teeth, reminding myself of the merits of being Sensible. I averaged down once in Dec2019 $33, but I wonder whether I will ever add any more..."
I bought 241 shares at 22.80 is that good ?
Pb bellow 1! Growing sales. Hold and forget.
Up 2% after hours. Something big is brewing 
It's all about what will be said in the conference call now and guidance going forward.
this is dream to see 48 by end of the year. (close gap)
Stable consumer staples will shine with its risk adjusted return is higher than many other sectors.
BUY BUY BUY FOLKS. 55 DOLLARS SOON
"It’s an error AH, people :) Look at Nasdaq."
I see $60s in three to five years possible
"Is the mad sell off over yet ? Market always overreacts in short term , don't forget that . After the storm sunny days are coming ,lol"
This is the day to buy if you want the dividend
Buy it..you'll be glad you did...
"@StockTrader 2 days ago ""Goodnight guys, tomorrow is the big reversal day, it will pop at least $3.50 - $5.00"""
Wondering with KHC at this price.if Mr.B is sharpening his pencil or licking his chops for a takeover............
I just bought a big bottle of ketchup..this should help
"Sold 10 puts w/ expiry 2/21 at 30 for 1.00 each and 10 puts at 29 w/ 2/21 expiry for 0.90. If sales decline is arrested in next earnings, stock should be fine."
ceo better deliver or its allll over.
"WOW !!! Buffet DOWN 5 BILLION THIS YEAR ALONE ON KHC !Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway has lost more than $5 billion this year on its investment in Kraft Heinz as the packaged food company’s stock has continued to tumble.Shares of Kraft Heinz hit a record low on Thursday, falling more than 13%, after the company announced an additional writedown of $1.22 billion and missed revenue expectations."
"Analysts has upgraded, free cash flow increasing, debt has come down, insiders are buying. KHC can replace the outstanding bonds with lower yields. KHC seems to have improving the financial strength."
I lost a lot but it's part of being in the game!
"Interesting results from KHC with a sizeable Covid boost.They are going to have to work hard on getting their costs down going forward though, because a 3.3% rise in sales was at the expense of an 8.9% increase in cost of products sold and a 4% increase in selling and admin costs. Looks like the Mexican boys haven't been as aggressive on cost cutting as they have been labelled by the press.If we get $32 on the euphoria, I'll be well chuffed."
If this ever breaks 37$ area look out
Keep selling! Loving these discounted prices...
Let's keep this upward momentum going!
"from twitter. 3G Capital blowing out of Kraft Heinz $KHC tonite in a spot 18M shares. Well, they trying to get rid of 3G. First CEO, after CFO, and now Capital. But thats ok, Should be bought that dip."
this company’s management just can’t cut the mustard
Bond upgrade..doesn’t hurt
A dividend cut is a HUGE run for the exits signal. The accounting investigation may not be huge but a dividend cut says things are much worse than disclosed. Even GE did not cut the dividend for 1.5 years after problems started. This is going to be big - it’s a short sellers gift
"If they slash the dividend and they will, this will drop to 20'sSoon..."
"BOYS...REGARDING BUFFET, REMEMBER KHC IS A PIMPLE ON HIS REAR END. ITS NOT LIKE WARREN IS THE CEO. HOWEVER...YOU CAN BET AT THIS POINT HES MUCH MORE INVOLVED THAN HE WAS A YEAR AGO. I LOOK AT BUFFETS STAKE AS A POSITIVE, AS THERE IS NO WAY BUFFET SELLS NOW. HES DETERMINED TO RECOUP HIS VALUE AND WILL BE VERY VERY INVOLVED !!!!"
Still an icon and great company. So the sell for 11 times earnings versus17. Buy and hold
I hope longs have a happy ending just like Mr Kraft.
I’m getting really tempted to buy this
"If I was Warren I would give KHC a very low interest loan to KHC to buy stock back and retire the share , Would be one of the smartest moves to make for both KHC and Warren Buffett at this price"
Anything Deutsche bank says is worthless garbage regardless of what stock. They should look at their own business entity which is a total mess ... top to bottom.
"Its really hard to not buy this. Warren Buffet, 52 Week low, still a billion dollar company..."
"Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) reported Q4 EPS of $0.72, $0.04 better than the analyst estimate of $0.68. Revenue for the quarter came in at $6.54 billion versus the consensus estimate of $6.6 billion."
Is Berkshire purchasing more shares... They were holding 25% and now I see they hold 26.71% of Kraft... Can anyone let me know if I am wrong please?
Bought AH 51.20
Last minute to receive 40 cents dividend.
If KHC ever sells what consumers want healthy & organic and buy HAIN foods they could increase sales 10x
"ixic is still 3000 point Up from its low. KHC will probably rise from 31.50 today, but there's a strong headwind. wholesale side is going to struggle and no one knows for how much longer. ""virus"" thing continues to play out. after election, and if all goes well, ""virus,"" and such will go away. ppc might, rumor, offer div 2021. another brazil company that moves needle in right direction. you can buy cheap today."
One point this was a non cash write down of business assets not a cash loss of 15 billion. So you can blame Buffet for this by taking his eye off the ball. This is still a good company that will have to dig it's way out of this mess. That is why the massive selling some investors don't care for management f ups. So I am sure more selling is coming but still a good company long term.
"Jim Cramer, just bashed Kraft-Heinz... Why, I just don't understand... What everybody has against Ketchup? Nice divident, solid value stock."
We got Oprah!
"spartacus: one of our neighbors in seattle, has a woodwork shop. he uses slickdeals to alert him of the rockler and kreg deals. he grabbed a bunch over holiday. you said you enjoy wood work. anyway...have a good year."
"You can see Kraft foods in super market are moving quickly, the sales must have increase 3 to 4 times. This is one stock benefit from the transient fear"
Headed to 10$ a share
"The problem is not promotions. The problem is far deeper. The company has been destroyed by chemists. Almost all Kraft products have been degraded beyond saving. Kraft Dinner, now called KD, doesn't use real cheese anymore (its whey, chemicals and colorant) and tastes so gross that even kids won't eat it. The Kraft dressings are water, high fructose corn syrup and some fake spices. In fact, whenever you read any Kraft ingredient label, it is clear that they have removed the whole notion of FOOD from the product. Its now a chemical soup of unpronounceable stuff. When you destroy the brands in cost cutting, there just isn't a business worth saving. Because EVERY product in their line has been so ruined, this one cannot be repaired."
"Well I work at a super market I see how much product sells I think about all the wal-marts, meijers,Kroger’s, Safeway’s and all the other stores that sell kraft products the experts are wrong they won’t be bankrupt in a year or so u can believe that"
Who is shorting this now? Why not overrated overhyped ones like shop cmg etc?
Kraft is #6 in the Buffett holdings
I see insiders buying
Kraft Heinz Chart Breakout Alert: 42% Upside Target once it closes higher than 33.65
Congratulations to all buy below $32.
Hot dog sales causes price increase!
Probably pick up tomorrow as well. Only concern with it this low is Buffet and 3G buy the rest of the shares for 20 billion ($35/share) which is peanuts for them. So I might pick up some today near the close.
Earning 9 a share and only paying out 2.5 in divy. Plenty of room to increase divy. Cheap stock
Buffet has enough cash to do a complete take out. Eliminating the dividend he could make a great return.
"So they have 30bill in debt. They produce a billion in free cash. They cut div, adding another bill in free cash. Let's say they can pay 3 billion a year towards debt. Plus cost cutting if effective, maybe 4 or 5 bill to debt. Raise div and keep paying debt. That would work for me for at least 3 years."
Morgan Stanley... states potential 3G involvement in KHC... this will really move the stock !!
Blood in the streets at $22. Getting ready to load the boat!
I can't share Buffett commitment to this stock. The div cannot be sustained at this level. Not unless there is a big increase in revs and therefore: earnings. I sold out yesterday. it was only 1000 shares but still: I held this for 2 weeks and walked off with $700.Not much but a profit is a profit. Good luck to you all
Well if they were doing everything right we would be at 50 so everyday a opportunity to win or lose .Warren would say don’t let your emotions make your decisions stay focused.!
"They pushed it down with 2 mil shares in 5 minutes ,may be big shorts covering ..."
congrats who bought around 25...next 3 month will be in range from 29.50 to 33.50. next ER 42$ and higher.
"cramer spins on a dime. tiny dancer. KHC is trending now after earnings and will simmer leading up to holidays as cons stapes usually do. nyc and other leading financial centrals are gearing up for black fri and holiday vacations. don't expect much in drops nor more than 35 to close out 2019. college bowl games start in a month. bagel bites at the ready. oh yeah, 1040 forms."
Maybe WB is buying today!
"Green after hours, things are looking up folk!"
i will have to eat mac & cheese w ketchup for next several months to make up for my losses lol
eventually it will settle around $28 and if next quarter is better jump easily over $30.
"Guys, you have to think long term ehre. This stock has nowhere to go but UP. Think about the long term and the next two quarters. KHC will increase as things go along. The book value is incredible, and so is the earnings. People are only thinking in the short term because of the GDB being down 33%. THE STOCK MARKET DOES NOT FOLLOW THE ECONOMY. Kraft will be at $50.00 by the end of the year by my estimation."
My advisor suggested I buy some shares in this company a while back. Glad I ignored him. I'll hop in at 20
Dividend Record Date
Paying dividends is useless for the company right now . For 2 Bill's payout a year the company could buy back all the floating shares ( 298 mil ) within 5 years or pay off 1/3 of its debt .
"9/16/2019 Jorge P Lemann Director Buy 3,496,503 $28.60 $99,999,985.80Why would Jorge buy this much stock 1.5 months before earnings release if he thought it would lose? It has only been above his cost for 6 days during this time. Don't you think he must know something about the last quarter earnings to risk this amount?"
They better beat earnings and revenue.
Finally they canned that kid! I'm surprised they didn't fire him last year! Who ever recommended him should be out the door as well.
Easy buy
"With another 4 months of political lockdown, consumer staples are flying off the shelves... the trend here is your friend."
Buy with the confidence that Berkshire Hathaway is seriously into this company. This is a gift. Grab it with both hands.
Ok folks... now for sure we know it’s bottom. Cramer bashing the stock after it dropped 30% the last two days. Lol  I guess that is our sign to buy it heavy !!
I think Im buying this dip
"Bought another 5,000 shares on margin, no guts no glory !! It will be around $40.50 - $42.00 in days. Great dividend coming very soon."
Beat earnings due to early Easter.You may not hear that any where else.Final low I don't think is in.But we are very close.Looking for a $52.XX print.

"KHC is the Phoenix rising. Out of the ashes of its past....it has been saved by COVID. Retail checks show empty shelves, Restaurants closed, and will have little attendance for the rest of this year. Eat at home up 2X....so all the grocery providers booming. KHC still below 30...should be 45 within 60 days....exciting times to own again. They are cranking out the KD ...and BBQ season is on the horizon!"
Great innovative Valentine products from Kraft. I can see marketing is greatly improved hitting where the demand is..
Anyone know where I can buy some cheese?
Lots of selling by paper hands. There are not enough diamond hands in this stock for the price to steady
"KHC will be insulated against a severe drop in its pps by virtue of its 6% yield. The big question facing KHC longs is, ""How safe is that dividend?"". Maybe the interest rate drop enables them to pay off debt more quickly, in which case the KHC suits might decide to hold off cutting the dividend.Or, maybe they believe they should couple low interest rates with a temporary (?) suspension of the dividend until the balance sheet is cleaned up?Beyond that, KHC's biggest problem seems to be consumers being content with paying less for store brands and off brands than paying a premium for KHC's long established name brands. The way KHC has watered down or downsized its core products over the years, it's no mystery that consumers don't see any difference. So, why pay more for a label?"
"What are you gonna do with your profits from puts or shorting khc into the next conference call?I'm looking forward to buying even more Great Value brands from walmart!!! Yep, more GV ketchup, mustard, graham crackers and at half price of similar sized KHC brands. the cabinets should be extra extra stocked after that conference call."
"It went from $25 to $29 in less than a month, quit complaining.This is normal pull back.If you bought in the $50s then good luck!"
a increase in sales when restaurants around the world have been closed is impressive. I think quarter 2 will be even better with high volumes continuing and the eventual opening of restaurants mid 2nd quarter or so
$0.40 dividend every quarter.not too bad.
Kraft will cook the books next week . Target price after earnings is 33 and higher. Not bad .
I don’t have a position anymore but am excited to see results. Good luck KHC holders
I put my order in for 500 shares not filled yet.
"Earnings next week will be blow out positive, so get on board HKC express......Buy Buy Buy.............!!!!!"
JPM downgraded KHC this morning...
Funny watching the longs and shorts bicker back and forth. I’m on the long side
"I post a lot of negative things about KHC. I do NOT want this company to fail. I am a shareholder. I sold the majority of my position in October 2016, but I continue to hold a position. My biggest qualm with most posters on here is the ""sunshine and lollipops"" attitude when more bad things are going to happen. I hate seeing investors falling into a pit with a recovery timeframe of years. This is going lower people. The dividend will be cut again. I'm not suggesting that you never invest in KHC, I am suggesting that you delay in investing in KHC. I like a lot of the Heinz portfolio of brands. Good stuff......Kraft....not so much."
Defensive Stock!
All this share plunge cause of write down is analytics BS. A staple is a staple is a staple. This all is being done with s view to some acquisition or buyout by someone. Buy or cry later
"Well, I'm buying today."
Thank you Dean Witter.
Such a big mistake to spin off Mondelez back then! That would be the bright spot now as mondelez had a great international presence (especially in emerging markets) and the snack business is gaining momentum despite the fact that consumers live a more health lifestyle. Hope they sell Oscar Meyer and some other brands and invest in GROWTH via marketing and R&D!
yeah baby. up to the moon
New group of negative nellies on board..been collecting huge dividend for a year and a half and account big green plus with very low average buy in..I am very comfortable in this stock going forward I’m ok if they sell everything except the ketchup and cream cheese and pay off all the debt
"We will just buy more shares back with the Dividend... Stock is like the bread you buy... Do you prefer to buy your bread low or High... Revenues are safe, KHC lower his debt with a nice div... The entire market is crashing... Remember you buy a company.... KHC will still be there is 10 year, there will be a merge or the will be purchased for more than the book value..."
Over $35:00 finally.
Strong dividend
It will pop on next earning announcement without the accounting write down. Price / sales is too cheap compare to other consumer staple stocks.
"You could basically draw a stock out of a hat and come out better than KHC, omg...."
"We've been through a tremendous period for stocks. Ultra low interest rates (great for stocks, as companies can borrow money on the cheap to buy back shares, invest in R&D etc, & very little competition from no risk investments like CD's) Now, even through interest rates are still low, they've risen substantially over the last 1.5 years. Some say they're going much higher. I don't necessarily believe that, but I think we need to ask ourselves one question. If KHC has a 5 year return of -27.77% in a 'perfect storm' environment for stocks, what will the next 5 year return be if ratescontinue to rise and/or the economy slows ?The only bright spot is that since early 2016, I've taken all dividends in cash. 410 shares with a cost basis of $49.98"
i sold some of my boat anchor stock (att) and bought some of this.
think we go under 60.
you think warren is selling today?well... know it alls?
"Good god, there's a virus and I've been living off Ketchup for 6 months. Why hasn't the stock price gone up? I've been planning on trading the ketchup bottle for lobster tails but lucks not with me today..."
"The Board of Directors of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share of common stock payable on June 15, 2018, to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2018."
Food hoarding is beginning again. Will help make sales soar. Ride it for now.
BUFFETT.....WILL NO DOUBT BE ASKED ABOUT KHC MONDAY MORNING ON CNBC. 6AM TO 9AM...WATCH AND LEARN !!!!
"Looks like the Wall Street machine is in full force trying to destroy a company and they are 100% wrong for sure. After listening to the call I think they have a great guy now running the show and will have a great plan by Jan. I also believe the people running the company that now says they have the cash flow to keep paying the dividend at this rate and will still have the money to make the changes they want and need to for the future. I guess it really boils down to do you believe in the people and company you are investing in or do you believe in some Wall Street firms that are shorting the company to make money and are wrong 100% of the time. I will be buying more , Why because times don't come around to great companies so cheap very offendUp to you what you want to do , but they said thing will be better in the 2nd 1/2 of the year. Listen to the call yourself and make up what you want to do."
Hope this doesn’t turn for few days.I want to load up more shares.
pretty much no secrets as regards AI and institution holds (more than 90%) at this writing. VOLUME indicates direction. appears a done deal. reports and data also indicate straddles among traders have increased. certainly bullish direction if you follow such nonsense.
Folks the news is getting good and the shorts will loose their shirts   .... and this is only the beginning !! Tomorrow we will see this over $34.50. Buffet and 3G have been accumulating all these days. Now they are ready to push KHC higher !!
Looking cheap
could be a quick run to 35
"Sales declined partially because prices were increased and fewer promotions. This lifted operating margins. Free cash flow increased and debt was reduced. Yes there is all the healthy eating fear, but there is every likelihood the sales fall will begin to minimise, they will offload more unwanted brands and debt will come down faster. Could be interesting but obviously not without risk. Bought last time at $26 and sold at $32. Just bought back at $27.4.Worth a shot an a rinse and repeat cycle and collect some dividend in the process. Operating margins rose in their report so they are obviously getting costs under better control. Too many doomsters attached to this stock is also an interesting point."
A bounce! Whoa.
"This is a brutal reminder to always use a stop loss. Good teaching moment, lesson learned. But this is also a good reminder that you never invest with money you can't afford to lose. I hate that I made a bad call, but I can hold the shares for a long time and believe in the company long term. GLTA."
"I am a prior $KHC holder who is 38 years old and had a penchant for investing since 8, trading since 14, and sold my first equity analysis company at 19 in techboom.I love deep deep value and read the intelligent investor in 6th grade. We are not at the bottom here. However I have been following lots of deep value and I think we are the bottom in FRAC SAND.Remember the stock market is a forecasting tool that sees into the future. Today after a wash-out sell off $CVIA ran and ran and ran. Go do your own DD. But from technical perspective we had a huge daily engulfing candle. There have only been two. One was last month. On balance volume peaked (negatively) in June meaning accumulation has been happening.The sum of the parts of this company was easily worth 4-5 billion based on recent asset sales. One plant sold for 135 million and 100 miles of rail sold for 100 million. They have 40’more plants and more rails. And the stock has a mkt cap of 200 million with 1.6 billion debt.The other frac sand name I like is $hcr. They are pure frac as opposed to cvia which also makes industrial sand for glass, tile, paint and roofs. $hcr has the opportunity to buyback shares starting tomorrow.Last quarter they were kick to buy as soon as they announced and do so in the 2.7. I do think you could sell some KHC, buy some sand, then use the proceeds to buy far more KHC in the future."
Great “equity bond”...I’ll take the 5% even if it doesn’t move up in price and I think there is limited downside with likelihood to be 50% higher at end of 2021 given beaten down valuation. core brands like Heinz Ketchup are cash machines......much less discounting/trade spending across CPG categories which will be nice bump to profit in next few quarters....
Get ready for large run-up in stock price.
"be mindful: yes, yes, organic growth is on the move. and, if continuing, sure KHC can make 50+. not all the news is out of course. our trust re doubled all the way to 25. we are overweight KHC now, and some needs to go...perhaps. alert that if KHC marks 35, we will continue to buy, and shed more CAG and GIS. all CPB and BGS is sold. our CTL PPC MDLZ PG continue to amaze."
"Beyond Meat is getting punished. $39 price target. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that during economic downturns, people choose generic cheaper brands every time. Look for this to soar as more dire economic news begins to roll out..."
Looking good today boys !! Finally a reversal is coming and of course the shorts will help us we they start heading to the doors .
Time for a breakout boys 30+ today!!!
Roy boy.....
"Lol GS downgrades, need I say more?? Looking for 40 by September"

Why is KHC selling off today? A pretty good quarter
OMG. This is exactly from the Burger King playbook. Bought more.
"Bought a sheer amount at 32.10, buying more now at low 27s. The brands KHC has are huge, lots of value in this stock. I have time in my life to see my investment here triple. Averaging down!"
If this opens at $52 (looking at premarket) this will hit a 52 week low. I have been watching this stock for about 5 months. Is $52 a good entry or it may still drop a little? thank you very much.
"42.385 is where my math puts $KHC within six month recovery. Everyone knows the brands, you know what your buying. They put some effort into lowering prices on some goods for those in the arctic to help out. It's the little things. Read the transcripts, management truly put the voice of recovery and action together fluidly. It's good news."
I’ll most likely sell on the beat and roll into MO. Good run from $25 to $35.
"a buffet dinner, he can pick up the company cheap now... good times"
"If you want a growth play and perhaps a buyout play on a pullback, take a look at Dropbox. You are more likely to see a 50% rise this year there then here. Most analysts still upgraded and $35 price target. currently 23 after a slight earnings pullback. Good earnings but missed guidance on margins by 4% but stock dropped 10%. Plus they could easily be bought for their data storage."
$40s for sure
"Now this is good news!!!!!!!! Warren is there!!!!!! Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. started new stakes in Biogen Inc. and Kroger Co. while increasing its stake in Kraft Heinz Co. , the company disclosed late Friday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Berkshire reported a stake of about 648,000 shares of Biogen and 549,000 shares of Kroger that were not listed in last quarter's filing. Kroger shares rose 6% after hours, while Biogen shares advanced 2%. Also, Berkshire increased its stake in Kraft to about 10.5 million shares from 9.1 million in the previous quarter. Berkshire cut its stake in Travelers Cos. to about 312,000 shares from a previous stake of nearly 6 million shares."
Thoughts on impact of potential planters deal in conjunction with earnings call? Last sell off (September) there was a solid dip. On the contrary the last two quarterlies have resulted in spikes.
"STEVE....ITS NOT A MATTER OF DO WHAT BUFFETT DOES. ITS A MATTER OF BUFFETT AINT LETTIN HIS INVESTMENT DISINTEGRATE, AND HE HAS THE MONEY TO BACK STOP IT. ITS COMMON SENSE, TO THINK OTHERWISE IS TO LISTEN TO NONSENSE. NONE OF US KNOW FOR SURE BUFFETTS PLAN, BUT ITS A SAFE BET THAT HE WILL DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT HIS INVESTMENT. THATS SIMPLY COMMON SENSE SMARTS !!!! FRANKLY...I BELIEVE HE TAKES KHC PRIVATE, BUT WHEN AND AT WHAT PRICE ARE THE QUESTIONS. KHC IS THE 5TH LARGEST FOOD COMPANY ON THE PLANET, IT MAKES MONEY AND AS A PRIVATE COMPANY IT OPENS UP MANY AVENUES OF PROFIT FOR BUFFETT. PLUS...BUFFETT HAS OVER 100 BILLION IN CASH BURNING A HOLE IN HIS POCKET. I SAY ITS QUITE LIKELY !!!!"
How can this possibly be legal---to announce that earnings will be published on or before July 31st and then on July 31st to move that day by a week. What about all those people who priced and sold/purchased options planning that earnings will come on July 31st-------all for everyone else who was negatively impacted by this delay. At this point can anything that the management says be taken at face value.
"KHC generates a billion in free cash BEFORE the crazy blundered ""cost cutting"". They just feed up another billion from slashing dividend. See my point? The company can weather this, the balance sheet is adequate."
"Karma for WB and Charly for supporing Hillary. The ghosts of X-Mas past are visiting, cant take it with you."
Thank GOD! Kraft finally speaks. https://apple.news/AwngMBEwDTvmRmSjm8BHEIA
Anyone remember when the analyst downgraded Tesla to 10.00 a share just a few months ago? Went back over 240.00
"Good Job Warren looks like you can pick the companies with Crooked management , WFC, KHC, and JPM is trying hard to be the crookest bank on Wall Street, They got some going to jail for manipulating the silver marker ,Looks like what makes them best of breed is making money on crooked deals or crooked accounting ,"

This stock will look great on total return over next few years for buyers at 35 areaStaple products
"I finally sold.... at a loss. talking about not selling products off, and massive debt, ""trying to save money"". They should have just said they are cutting the dividend to 1 cent. I see nothing positive that will move this stock. Good luck to the ones that hold. I originally cost because it was down, paid a great dividend, and Buffets backing. I'm only doing mostly ETF's from now on."
"For sure the beyond meat fad is over at our local markets ,The Same pile of beyond meat has been sitting there for weeks now and the real burgers that are 10 for $10 are sold out and you have to keep asking for them to put more out and as soon as they do the real burgers are gone again. I would for sure start building a position in KHC. All up to you if you want to or not."
$55 Soon!!!Guarantee!!!!
No doubt the dividend is history. Kraft will survive and recover.
I will continue to buy periodically and still believe long term
The real Fact is KHC has been in a multi year down trend cycle and that cycle is right now in the process of changing into a new multi year uptrend cycle.. I would be buying your shares at this way under valued price and get paid very well for the many year up cycle. But do what you want . You will anyway LOL
"Panic selling, and it is not acceptable. Rich will get richer because you sold. This is a staple stock Buy Buy Buy KHC.............!!!!!!! Load up the truck"
They should have cut the div to .25/q with the amount of debt they have. These half measures look just like when GE first cut theirs then had to slash it again when the reality of how bad it was came out. So much better uses for that money right now than a div.
Coming up on that 52 week low. Lets see if it holds. Not sure why such panic lol
Was the divident cut??
"CNBC asked Buffett why he doesn't buy more at these levels (2/25/19). His answer: ""Because it isn't worth as much."""
My wife and I only buy Philadelphia cream cheese..because we avoid sugar in other products..but we still have that in our home always...probably 75% of homes have at least one khc product in their homes right now..hard not to like this stock going forward with issues being resolved..debt and accounting
"Food, energy, housing and defense. Food is neutral, energy is flat, housing is gonna pop for a short time with interest rate drop and defense is popping right now..."
So KHC will report good Q4. Stock will hit $36 and then fall back...
"This stock is GE redux, a company was thought to be the heart of everything, which rested on its laurels, and never knew that the world was changing. To hold it is to watch your money melt like salt. The world eats fresh produce now. Few people eat Kraft dinners or canned baked beans, etc."
Buy before this takes off i think it will skyrocket Not to long ago it is not far from one hundred !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good luck for tomorrow
"From new balance sheet, long term debt now $28.4 bil. they paid 2.5 billions already"

i Could see this dropping to mid 20s before heading back up. Long term this will rebound as long as preferred dividends arnt paid out to the crooksters

Imagine only if today’s broader market was up ...
Berkshire has more than enough cash to buy them out!
"Sell, sell, sell! Word is the world is going to stop eating. Don't tell anyone."
they need to cut that divy in half or go to a bank or mr buffet for the money to pay those 1.2 BILLION shares outstanding.
"KHC topped on April 25,2017 at 92.89.This stock has been in correction mode since then.The stock has been falling for one year.And the chart shows the stock is bottoming out and creating a basing pattern.The correction is over in price if not in time(might be a double bottom)Heavy short position.This could sky rocket."
The crooks on Wall Street are buying Kraft Heinz Company while they bash it. When they are done buying the upgrades will be all over the place. Get in now. We are going up.
Free fall - the 3:00 PM margin calls are in.
Heinz owns baby food companies around the world but not in USA. Here's an idea Heinz Certified Organic Baby Food in America. Huge prices for small packages of food. Maybe I should work for Heinz.
"That's the market there are never any sure things. However, I bought more today, dollar cost averaging and since this is such a brand icon and company with money I do not see a long term bust. But it takes guts to go against the grain when headlines cast shadows. Not advising anyone but consider all the financial facts. Also why I don't see KO going down. A bumpy road yes but one of the most iconic brands ever."
Love this stock! Diving in plus options. Think I'll have a bowl of KD with ketchup to celebrate.
This has been going sideways for long enough... I'm dipping in long here.
Tsm and khc and t and msft money all day long don’t miss it
The Kraft Heinz Co has a current ratio of 1.00. It generally indicates good short-term financial strength.
"Hold your shares, don't listen to shorty's lies."
KHC should create new vegetarian meat products.
What a P.O.S.
Once trump took office I woke up. I invested and stopped listening to fake news . God bless 45.
bought more and sold some covered calls to mitigate my losses...
Another month and this will be in the 40's. They took a charge for 15 Billion BUT if they don't realize that charge then it WILL HAVE TO BE REALIZED as REVENUE!!!
Kind of amazing firstly that Cramer would even mention this on the first sign of rally. And secondly that his words have so much impact. This has dramatically underperformed on the rally. More to come assuming no new downturn in the market. Always a concern.
Looks like the WALL STREET firms that control YAHOO don't want you to know.No brainer buy today for $33.40 or if you own the shares and want out . Just sell the Jan 17 2020 $35 strike call you get almost $3 for it and you get the dividends until someone takes your shares from you plus you are now protected for up to $3 more to the down side. Just sell smart or you can just give them away to me and I will make $5 more a share.
Expert advice is..... there are no experts.
it was a failed merger. a company climate changed to worse. Many qualified pros. left the company. A further outcome is obvious. May be I will come back to this stock in $10-12 range. disclosure: sold as soon as a merger was announced.
Shouldn´t consumer staples be a safe bet in these times?
"What's important with KHC is demand for all their products is way up since especially in Calf there are all kinds of shortages of food, especially can't find any fresh meat--so KHC mac and cheese is in high demand. Yes restaurant demand will be somewhat done but drive though windows helping. Overall I think KHC is the best positioned it has been in years."
Bought another 1million usd khc here. total 4 million in and have 1 million more cash to buy more. happy
The big ship is turning around
Not just dead money.... dead money and buried!
"I bought 2 million here, and have 3 million usd left to buy more. Love to buy this."
"Please sell some more, so i could buy huge amount of this pretty food market share"
comical all these food stocks are being taken down. Must be a recession in the cards and they need in these safe havens on the cheap. I am buying here . Just like oil and tobacco at there lows. Just a huge game
Remember no one is buying Chinese ketchup or Indian Mac and cheese. Buffet is not selling. Worst is over. Downside low.
"I've been waiting for 3 years for it to go to 15 or so. came close. it needs to fill in recent gap ups from bottom. I think a retest of 18 to 19 realistic. debt is the problem with this company. Until they address it. It will flounder about. We will see if it gets to my target. I was called an idiot for saying 15 price , 2 years ago, 1 year ago. We will see. They need to suspend dividend, pay debt, take the hit on stock price. In 2 years the company would be much healthier. They could restart the dividend at that time and the stock could head to new highs, in 5 years. Until debt is addressed, it will continue with the malaise hanging over it."
"The $1.9 trillion stimulus will help to purchase A LOT of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese; maybe even splurge on the Deluxe White Cheddar, Garlic and Herb :)"
just one normal earnings report would send this soaring..no write downs or negative news....it's been a while now..not sure if it's this quarter..or next..or the next..but at some point this will return to normal
"im going to watch tomorrow , might buy in"
Kraft dressing and Maxwell coffee... very 1980s... Reminds me of the game show Supermarket Sweep.
"Too much debt... 30+ billion. How areThey going to pay this off with no growth, increasing expenses and declining eps"
Looks like every February since 2018 KHC takes a dive. Only difference in 2020 is smaller dive (of course it doesn't have as far to fall anymore.)
"Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC) saw two directors buying some shares last week. At $28.27 to $28.60 apiece, the almost 3.75 million shares reportedly acquired altogether totaled more than $107.11 million. Note that the larger of the two purchases was pursuant to Rule 144(g)."
WOW rates going lower and lower is sure making KHC look better and better. WOW KHC is now paying more than twice the 10 year
Don't They Say HEINZ is the SLOWWWWWWW 'Ketchup'HEE HEE HEE
"last day may options , boys maybe trying to keep 27.50 calls alive or $30 puts most probably in the money."
"When I get fast food, the ketchup packets I didn’t even ask for go in the trash...but the stock itself is a HOLD and BUY MORE"
Cooked the books. Massive earnings revisions coming. Board to be fired by Buffet
"Earnings are coming out before market open, so I’m assuming 8 am?"
"Looks like my family is now not the only family boycotting all Minnesota based companies . To send a message to the voters of Minnesota that the hate for the Jewish people OMAR is spreading is wrong and they need to do something about it. We sold all are GIS stock and started boycotting all Minnesota based companies , Looks like we are not the only family anymore after the hit GIS stock is taking today . We felt doing nothing was no longer an option and to see if how we spend our money and invest it would have the power to maybe make change for the better. Looks like the boycott is not just in my neighborhood anymore and is spreading. GIS now has un sold inventory no sitting around in every store where I live. We new nothing would change if we were the only family that felt this strongly , but today looks like we are now not the only family."
do i put another 100$ of shares in this company? i currently have 20 shares.
WOW
People don't eat healthy. MCD sits at all time high. Bought more just now.
Just WOW! Back to value!
"Setting a buy of 1811 shares at $33.12. Will make some money tomorrow with a slight bounce, as it always does on Wednesdays. Have a great week to all!"
R ALSO WRONGLY CRIED ABOUT ABOUT A DIVIDEND CUT ON THE M BOARD AGAIN WRONG. IN THE LAST CC CALL FOR KHC THEY SAID NO FURTHER DIVIDEND CUTS. INSIDERS BOUGHT 100 MILLION OF STOCK.
Insane that pandemic is all time high and shutdowns are coming worldwide - yet KHC is down under 30. Long cold winter coming. Lots of hot Mac and cheese. Can't wait until earnings.
"convincing bounce off insufferable 30.50. proprietary news is strong suit for KHC presently. we expect improved share prices going forward to all important february. several, no not all of course, have started covering large baskets of puts. while you're doing your search, note that institutional top ten holds have done little selling. as we earlier stated, we are more concerned with our overvalued other staples in our years old trust. khc does not present that problem until once again emerges as a 90+ dollar equity."
I trust the new CEO. KHC won't be that cheap for long.
"It's because they are old school long term cash cows, that pay a healthy dividend."
"Issued Press Release on February 13, 07:10:00: The Kraft Heinz Company Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend of $0.40 Per Share businesswire.com/news/home/..."
"Kraft need to buy a cannabis company ..... pot infused cheese, ketchup, crackers, etc. will save KHC"
"Person close to 3G sees 'chance' for Kraft Heinz go-private bid, Bloomberg says Bloomberg's Craig Giammona and Katherine Chiglinsky stated in an article earlier that a person familiar with the situation said ""there's a chance 3G could try to take [Kraft Heinz] private, perhaps tapping a $10 billion fund"
KHC stock closed OVER its 50day mov avg and also above the trend line joining last 2 highs in 2019; very bullish technical chart development.....smart money is accumulating in anticipation of some news which may notbe out for a while.
people we go thru this every week chill out..
"Excellent day I just bought some more, I really will be from those who laugh in August"
Lol you think warren Buffett will let this fall . Think again !
a little trouble cracking that 32.50 wall. maybe you folks can close there one day?
"Yep, another stock that's a trap. Should have bought GIS instead."
Today it looks like 24.00 dollars can reached looking at the premarket. My guess is when Kraft numbers come out for this quarter its hello 27.50 and we very slowly climb our way to $30 perhaps in August.
22% operating margins.
BUY BUY BUY.....BLOOD in the street
who is reporting a dividend cut? fake news!!!
"So on April 21 a top-notch firm maintains its buy recommendation on KHC with a target price of $45.Today a third rate firm downgrades the stock and it drops over 1%. Meanwhile, stocks that will have no earnings for years with not 1/2 cent of dividend go soaring into dreamland. It pays an annual dividend of 3.91% which is 240% higher than the 10 year note and 173% higher than a 30-year bond."
"KHC, CPB, and GIS are by far the best companies to own just before an economic slowdown. I've been buying large blocks since the Christmas eve correction. An economic slowdown is imminent, May want to set yourself up for success, by buying these companies which offer lower priced consumer goods in during hard times..."
I recommend the Kraft Pineapple Cheese Spread on toast while waiting for the stock price to rise.
we will get a bump as KHC will report better than expected earnings. could see 32 after report
Sellers should see some exhaustion by the end of the day.Normal for two heavy selling days to be followed by some relief tomorrow.
"sone of you heard what you wanted to hear from Warren. But the bottom line is he talked the stock down from 75 cents up to 7 cents down. yes, he is not selling but he is also not buying anymore at these low prices. Not exactly tge rousing endorsement we were all hoping for."
Will add in Jan. after tax loss selling which feeds on itself. Looking at CAG fire sale. Everyone has to eat.
"I love Kraft Heinz, their products feel like home"
General Mills shareholders are at a 5 year low.They have fallen 27% this year alone.Tell Annie to pick up the mess in the bargain aisle while she 's suffering ORGANIC losses. lmao
Time to bring out the good stuff today
"I don't own KHC, but am starting to get tempted. Any predictions on the bottom price and why, for a good entry level?TIA"
I keep buying to average down and get a good dividend. Now at $41 per share average.
"with more lock downs I think market will take a hit beginning of the week. look at the shelves of your local stores khc products are always blown out even with them producing record breaking numbers. the ""healthy"" alternatives that was such a big thing only a month ago are still stocked. so much for the people who was saying ""khc will go out of business no one eats that stuff anymore"". this earnings will break all the records and it will carry thru the rest of the year as people get laid off and start spending wisely and stay stocked up"
I am glad I sold this.
Post hour fraud to cause panic selling
CS upgraded KHC to $90 when was at $81. lol. With TP at $26 and yet KHC makes $2.61. div $1.60. .. just keep buying. CS?? lol...
We should close at $31 today....good sign for the rest of the week.
"Shelf stable food is a safe investment. We see when the sheet hits the fan like in a pandemic, all anyone wants is shelf stable groceries and good things to eat."
Still a $1.60 dividend. Sweet bought at $38.42
Awesome entry for new shares.. thank u
Lock in that high dividend for years and decades to come!
Congrats ! Up a Dime in PM ! Great Time To SELL Before the Continued March to the Most RecentAnalyst Price Targe of $27.....O Well..........Back to the ATT Board !
BUYING OPPORTUNITY - BUY ON THE DIP!!!
"they can produce A LOT more than they used to, and retailers want EVEN MORE. and this is just the beginning as more and more people will be forced to stay put. Just wait for Wallstreet to finish processing that 1+1=2, and see KHC surge!"
Should I be blindly snapping this up or should I be scared?
I added today boys....they kept the dividend so I don't see much downside at this level.
several pompous Winchester types on board who probably own 10 shares in a drip
Averaged down to $39. Hoping by year end I'll be even and also hoping the dividend doesn't get a cut.
trusting bryan spillane: why sure. july 2018 he and bofa had a $85 price target KHC.
Any idea of the ex-div date announcement? Mid-Nov.?
"In my view, the only way to get my money out of this value trap (without waiting 5 yrs), is to short sell it. If the interest rates go up, this baby will fall, and if I short a % of my portfolio I might break even."
"Most analysts are cutting their price target on KHC, that's the bad news. The good news is, after making their cuts, several analysts still have a $50 price target on the stock. Face it people, that makes this a STRONG BUY! (don't always believe everything you hear)"
"I was going to stay with the ship but I just got out at $27.333 after reading a just-released blurb about Credit Suisse cutting it's price target from $33 to $26 while explaining a host of negative issues for the company. This stock would be facing an uphill battle without the other market issues - inverted yield curves, trade war, possible military action against Iran et al. I'm OK with the possibility of missing an huge upside move - there are other fish to fry I feel more comfortable with right now."
Futures up... it’s shaping to be another good day tomorrow. Hang in there and pickup the .40 cent dividend.
I guess Kraft Heinz isn’t going bankrupt any time soon? You shorts had your fun. Time to buy.
It’s crazy to me people don’t see the potentiel here this is one of the safest and smartist investments a guy or gal could make and I mean that sincierly
"Suspect that earning for KHC, this quarter, will be reasonably good. Then shortly thereafter, perhaps, a good time to sell."
Yahoo needs to fix the details on the Dividend
they will hit their target value knowing they are heading in a positive direction.
If I lose money following Mr. Buffet then so be it. Have a nice weekend!!
"I JUST ENTERED AN $85K POSITION AS 6% DIV. IS EXCELLENT AND KHC IS AT IT'S LOWS....THE FOLKS WILL CONTINUE TO BUY FOOD SO CALM DOWN AND WATCH KHC GO BACK UP...DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW MUCH BUFFET PAYED FOR HIS SHARES?,,,"
138M shares traded. Good volume. This stock has another 15% downside. Anything more will be a total collapse.
29% crash in one day seems contrived. I bought 500 shares. If it goes lower I’ll add more until it stops going down.
Dividend tomorrow
"""people"" aren't selling. 81% of market is quants and bots. human contact is mostly absent now. while the ""hummingbird project"" is a lousy movie, it may enlighten you. the steps firms take to have their bots first in line and trade over and over every Milisecond should, may, give you an idea of what is actually happening. KHC is fine."
why did they loose 10 billion in 2018? what was the hit and was that just a one time thing?
Looks cheap
above 42 with conviction
Interesting candlestick ...someone #$%$ 1.5 mill shares
Back to 30s
Everyone is surprised but it’s still nowhere close to where it deserves to be
This is painful for most. and I feel your pain and refuse to make anymore sly remarks. Sorry for your losses
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-upgrades-kraft-heinz-170018704.htmlMorgan Stanley's multiple concerns reflected in a bearish stance on food company Kraft Heinz Co (NYSE: KHC ) is now fully priced into the stock after a 53-percent loss in value over the past year. The ...
"Kraft and Heinz products are legacy products that their followers are getting older and buying less. Massive competition from new disrupters. I am wondering why the Oracle of Omaha did not see the writing on the wall. Just look at Wholefoods and Costco how many of their products are sold there. This company is going the way of Sears. Sorry but this a long shot, why they did not buy the new hot companies, they let the competition eat at their revenue slowly. The new generation is shying away from old legacy brand, it is associated with unhealthy eating. This is what Amazon is doing, helping the new food startup from ketchup and tomato sauce sell online with little upfront cost."
Short term breakout now on decent volume. Looks like some bigger players are buying ahead of earnings.
cutting Dividends by 36% just announced
Bought a little more for a long term gain (hopefully - cut losses) and especially the dividend.
Looks like Wall Street has the earnings date and the Ex dividend date they are trying to push KHC lower to get in before the rest of us get the information
"Barring new downgrades (or maybe, even in the face of new downgrades), the stock appears to have bottomed. One big concern is that the stock closed near today’s low on 4x volume - that leaves open the possibility of additional forced selling tomorrow"
$32.00 bottom???????
So khc wil be back at 30 next week
KHC could be a bit of a safe haven in the event of a second wave. We’ve seen some good numbers last ER.
On KH's twitter feed from last month........Harris Poll's recent Reputation Quotient Survey...The top American companies Americans CAN'T IMAGINE LIVING WITHOUT.1)KRAFT HEINZ....69% of Americans say this is a company they can't live without2)Amazon.....63%3)UPS....59%4)Microsoft.....58%
Please Please !Orderly Rush to the EXIT !(Snicker)
Kraft Mac and Cheese ALONE will keep this company around for. centuries.
KHC is getting better now. Company will turn around for the future. Prices is increased will pick up more sell during the pandemic.looking forward the profits. Stay on course for long term investors. Be patience.
Down a little bit but i feel the bottom...chart just screams comeback
I miss this stock being $97
"American Cotton Oil and National Lead were on the Dow Jones.Things change. Demand for cotton oil and lead probably greater today then back then, just not incrementally so."
Covid not ending soon. KHC going to profit for long time
I think the new norm is to sell anything that Buffett buys and buy anything that's buff it sells.He is getting old. He wants to leave Berkshire in good shape before he steps down.
"If you can’t handle volatility just sell the stock. Yes it might be a risky stock with its high debt. It might even go lower, but stop bragging and sell if it doesn’t suit your style, it’s completely normal. I’m sure many of us here (owners) bought the stock thinking it’s a defensive pick, and that prices will not move this sharply. But it’s happening it went down from the 90’s to this level. I hope the turnaround is just around the corner for KHC."
"People have shown that Warren Buffet is still in a gain situation with this company. So when he made the comment today that he ""overpaid"" for KHC, I bet that means he thinks $34 is still overvalued. I was kind of shocked he got into this at all, he usually does not like companies who have a balance sheet drowning in debt."
Great timing on the article from TheStreet. They’re only a month off. Or 40-50% off. Or millions of boxes of Mac & Cheese ago. The bottom is long gone.
"chart says someone is buying big, @27% discount I already filled my orders. Now I just wait for those late to the dance to fill my pockets"
Why would anyone stay short at this level!!! You short at 90 and cover at 27. Simple investing buy low sell high
A couple of my friends and I just started buying this today. We hope that it will run up about 20% within the next year or two. Meanwhile the dividend will be very nice to collect while we wait
This will pass and KHC will be over $42 soon enough.
buy and hold for 5 years 20x returns.
Hey Warren! How’s it feel to lose all that cash on KHC.
"Let's say goodbye to Amy and press the mute, her useless unsupported opinion is worthless."
"GREAT 4% DIVIDEND STOCK , REMEMBER THIS STOCK WAS IN THE 90's A FEW YEARS AGO."
THE SMART INVESTORS ARE LOADING UP ON KHC.
Folks KHC has iconic brands... they need to invest more in their marketing plan and come up with healthier trending foods. This is a buy... no brainer !! It is also ression proof... we tend to eat more during ression periods. This thing will be back to $42 very soon then back to where it was before earnings $48.50. Once they show growth it’s a $65.00 stock.
Robert Kraft arrested today
KHC invested in a sweet proteins company:https://www.fooddive.com/news/kraft-heinz-leads-69m-investment-in-sweet-protein-company/581959/
It looks like a rotation back to consumer staples. CAG GIS CPB. KHC starting to recover. World's gotta eat.
Where is the bottom ?
"I just realized KHC is my portfolio's biggest winner... funny! I bought this because I assumed it would be a slow, boring, DIV payer then it went up 30% on me : )"
KHC stock price will pop once investors see they are serious about improving the balance sheet.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/kraft-heinz-weighs-sale-of-its-breakstones-cottage-cheese-sour-cream.html
"KHC should not be selling below book value and at less than 67% of enterprise value. While you wait for it to attain its justified value, a 4% dividend is nothing to sneer at. Target price $60."
Ride the waves . Khc long .#USA
"This stock is bipolar. Period. If it wasn't for the dividend, I wouldn't hold on to it; plenty of opportunities elsewhere. That isn't to say it won't return back into the 40s mark by summer time."
2 hours to go. Will it rally into the green and stay????
"Why people panic? A stock is like the bread you buy at the grocery... If you like a kind of Bread (stock) , do you prefer to buy it cheap or that you bread (stock) price increases week after week... On the long run, you want your stock low to purchase more right now... Eventually, the price will goes up because of the fundamental, but just be happy when the price is low right now..."
Down another dividend payment and a half today. LOL Thats nearly 3 1/2 years of divs lost in market cap since they made the foolish decision to keep it.
"Hi guys. New investor to KHC! Just so you know, everything I touch usually turns to mush. GLTA!"
still under book; this play can rise way more; any word on increase in ady or warrens cronies increasing stake and this goes up 10-15% quick
Buy orders fly under the radar in pre-market. Another article suggests to buy KHC while it is below book value.
"""Guggenheim Securities consumer goods analyst Laurent Grandet says Patricio must take aggressive action if he wants to save the company. The company must invest in a range of $700 million to $800 million over two years to jump start sales growth, Grandet believes. Required investments include marketing to drive interest in core brands and in research and development to find the next hot product."" so a start up company again with $30b in debt. wow. How about going back to basics providing solutions that trends suggest? Just breakup the company and sell the parts and get on with it."
KHC taking off after hours
BOYS....I LOADED THE BOAT YESTERDAY AT 30.15. HUGE VALUE. NOW I SIT BACK AND WATCH PROFITS ROLL IN AND THE MARKET WISE UP. THE 5% DIVIDEND IS GRAVY !!!!!
This puppy is ready to pop any day now! Loading up on more today!
"hi everyone im new. im putting together an income portifolio. so far i have pbi, m, lb, hbi, rrd, khc, ge, bgs, and tup. what else should i add for long term dividend growth?"
"At least they won't buy Campbell, that's the best News of the day... Just for that, the stock should take 5%... Mondelez, PepsiCo, Kellogg, etc... Anything but not Campbell."

Kraft Heinz is back as one of America's Favorite Companies. Ranked #6 in Consumer Goods and #30 Overall...https://apple.news/ACzSqFzjWRBqS4A-CFQOMmg
STRONG AND LONG DESPITE BIG SELLING WHAT DOES SMART MONEY KNOW???
bought more shares today
you can go into nearly every home in America and find multiple khc products..they will fix this and long term the stock will recover..cooler heads will profit
beginning of positive news cycle..to the moon Alice(very slowly over years)
maybe Warren Buffet purchased KHC shares because he wanted to ride in the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile. I bought my shares because he owned them. I have no interest in riding in the Wienermobile. I just wish he explained the reason for his purchase to shareholders before I went ahead and bought shares.
Negative article on CNN(fake news) today.
"STILL under book value.Cat risks gone due to them taking the right steps.Looking really good, if they can do $3 dollars a share in earnings a year we are laughing here."
"What an opportunity to these shares so low. Drinking my Bahama Mama... and just watching this, might add more before the closing... cause come Monday this thing will Pop when Buffet speaks."
Well look here they are not letting us down today at all way to go
"Earnings announcement* for KHC: Aug 02, 2019According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 4 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.76."
Read my POSTS ( not my lips); KHC is on its way up to $45 in next 18 months.Brilliant moves this last week of tendering high interest rate notes and replacing them with new loans at low interest rates; a gift from the FED !!
"Very bullish reversal this am in face of disappointing ConAgra earnings. 4.5% dividend is outstanding from this old, stable company that is supported by an over 25% stake by Warren Buffett."
KHC should buy GIS which has organic food lines. Or at least buy HAIN for now
Cheap valuation right now. Would rather see KHC drop farther short term. Load the Boat
Downgraded by Piper Sandler. Unchanged 41 PT.
Kraft Heinz reached a 52 Week high at 33.77
I’m so glad I held onto this.
Where you gonna put your money during these times ? Airlines ? Cruise lines ? or secure Companies with safe dividend ?
JPM did not get in on the sale of the Cheese bizz or the Planters Peanuts deal. Understand why they might take a hit at KHC since they used Goldman instead? Not to hard to figure out JPM's lame downgrade position. IMO most analyst are liars. I mean his excuse is KHC improved quicker than expected? How about you just are a poor analyst who continues to undervalue KHC. Guy sounds incompetent. Glad I don't pay for his advice.
When do the ambulance chasers come in?
hoping it drops back to 27.50 and do it again
I think Buffett is going to demand some changes. I think a lot of over paid management needs to get let go!!
"KHC... large unpopular company... Benjamin Graham would have bought it... so I did, at 59$."
Get in and get the dividend in a few days.
This is not going to get better until there is a change in management. Buy CHD and put their people in place here. Not rocket science!
How can there be more selling? Even stamps.com popped after crash ..
Bizarre..3g exits and stock goes down...best thing to happen in two years
"market maker has a lot of options to sell , time is ticking if the numbers are half decent and the stock rises even 1.00 its going to cost big."
We also loaded up $KHC at $27.12. First Tgt $34. A good long core hold. Lots of smart guys can make it work. Odds r in their fav.
I’m still waiting on the dead cat bounce :). I believe this stock will recover some from these prices.
After they close the two deals and pay off 6b in debt I believe they will increase dividend
Finally catching a bid...if dividend is safe this is a buy
A 5 million share block @ 2:57 pm. Nearly four times average volume today. waddup
KHC is on a 30% discount now. If it gets to $19 I would feel ok about adding more. But I’m going to sell all when it gets back to $42 because I see it’s moat and shelf space being eaten away by store brands.
"Once this smoke clears, makes for a buy opportunity, IMO. Actually a good buy now but the emotion still not settled out. The 85% electronic algorithm built into the market is at work. Once principles take charge, this stock will move upward."
looking to add 800 to 1000 more shares will see
NasirBuy all you want hereWill enjoy a 40% return over next 6 to 9 months
"Looks like the analyst is a liar , Warren is saying things are ok and for sure someone purchased 1 million shares on the close yesterday, Go look at the volume."
this has to be close to the bottom
Buffet is getting his nuts blown off as this poorly positioned company continues to lose brand value. The only hope we have is a complete overhaul of its products.
"well here we go another day coming of brand shrinkage , try french's ketchup great taste , lower price and will probably give you the same amount of cavities."
low volume and Cramer bash so not so bad today. Will be green at close
"please note that barrons and zacks are pausing their outcomes from sell to sell, but with caveat that earnings and subsequent all important 10Q will feature positive leanings. we expect both reporting firms to go to hold, or even neutral in next 3-6 months. this should earn you 34-36 call. for respectable 55, which is still low, a future earnings beat would be needed. october 31 and 10Q earnings statement is not yet the answer. we sure have no idea of direction as too premature."
"If you looking for dividends here is one to look at IVZ and it's trading at lows, with upside , Goes ex dividend on Nov 8 pays around 7.4% that's about 1.85% every 3 months not bad and has some upside. Bill Gross's favorite stock in the whole market."
buying monday
Just an FYI: Robert Kraft (the Patriots owner) has nothing to do with this company. They just happen to share the same name.
Loading up boys . Great stock . Good reward for longs !
"12/02/2020 KRAFT HEINZ CO Director Buy Indirect 90,000 $33.199 - $33.242 90,000"
"Hyman Tische, has an immediate price target of $32 per share.Warren buffet, not selling anytime soon!"
Good times are here again 
having a hard time believing any sellers left.
Waiting for them to cut the dividend. then I'll buy
I used to work at Kraft then when they got bought by Buffet and 3G they shut down many factories and lost my job. Never thought I would buy back in tje stock after how poorly it has performed. But I took a small position a few weeks ago
"Dont think this was posted yet:new ceo has invested $20m into the company of his own money.In connection with his employment by the Company, Mr. Patricio has committed to purchase $20,000,000 of Common Stock, which Mr. Patricio has agreed to hold four years from the date of purchase."
the good news is that they must report by 7/31 earnings by their own deadline
Krafties expecting huge pop....Nope.
"Kraft problem started with 3G, the greedy Brazilian who destroyed the brands of Kraft and Heinz. I got a college who was laid off by Kraft after 3G bought the company. Basically what 3D did was to lay off everyone who is not in production line. Now, everyone realize that is a wrong approach to business, even 3G admitted that. KHC just got a new CEO who is a winner. I expect good things will happen, because American still eat and drink."
"We should see a strong rebound soon. KHC price is hammered for no reason but 3G partial sell, nothing can justify such a low price"
"Mathematically, the numbers say KHC is a $40 to $42 stock when looking at next year’s forecasted earnings of $2.60 per share...$2.60 x 16 (P/E) =$41.60...if you look at comparative food companies GIS, TSN, Hormel the average P/E is around 16...KHC is probably at least worthy of being considered an average corporation in that group...The stock has already been punished for its write down...It will be over $40 in the next 12 months if the market is rational...plus you get a better then average dividend while you wait..."
I wonder if Warren Buffet is buying more ???
"You guys lol, people want organic beans and that's all America eats right? U do realize there are many markets in America. Not just neck beard calorie counters right? Ever heard of Wallmart and Dollar General....... two failing companies lol"
"It looks like Warren or 3G is now buying Shares under $20 , Looks like KHC got the lucks rabbits foot A Knight in Shining Armor has come to the rescue and is now buying for sure under $20"
"Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) Is flat, other packaged food stocks are flat. its only this one with the high options volume that had the classic spike after the morning rush. Claps hands, you institutions know how to make money."
I forgot if we get back to the 30s today or Monday
"remember on benzinga the report of unusual options action on khc , well you see the results now forcing the price down almost everyday. I think whoever it is bought 27.50 puts and the computers are just whacking away with sell orders . We read that khc is making good progress."
"Little discussion this morning. Let's say Kraft dividends are safe... Let's say the keep them at 62.5 cents (2.5$ per year). The U.S long term interest is 2.89% this morning... An annuity of 2.5$ payable annually for perpetuity is worth 86.51$. Just base on dividends, this stock in worth 86.50$ and you still have the value of your stock... Can anyone Explain me the price of 55$... I am not complaining and I will buy more every time I get dividends... I just don't understand"
KHC is rocketing
KHC must step in with some positive announcements to boost investor sentiment
higher lows...good sign..building cause..next stop 33.5 retest
I Was Wrong KHC Doin Fine......It's Actually....Ticked UP A Dime !Sir Poet........Mikey
pure panic...start buying
CFRA maintains its hold on shares of KHC due to its substantial drop in share price and company valuations. Time to accumulate.
"Here in Michigan (Metro Detroit) store shelves of Kraft Mac & Cheese are empty and when in stock it has limits. I would expect that the KHC top line should look great. my feeling is the stock should hit $42 by July, 2021."
"Maybe Warren can engineer an Apple Kraft Cola merger, since he loves rollups so much."
"Well I'm In 3125 Shares @32.90Holding short term Dividend play, we'll see how this works out.Play Money.....Big Dividend Position is 34K Shares ATT (T) @29.55, picked up a few weeks ago.Waited until this at least showed SOME signs of life, stopping going down EVERY Day, etc....Yesterday showed maybe a little life......."
Nice time to buy/
"Hold your cash for $25..then, we buy!!"
People are busier buying the company that may be bought out instead of the company doing the buying lol. If khc skips campbell campbells price is going down not khc. If they skip its because theyre looking elsewhere to buy
"Warren Buffett gonna make me rich, sell limit set at $60"
Mathieu.....go to www.sec.gov to review corporate filings. Click on the link below.I found a link to the document on stocktwits.
Really? You must be looking at the wrong chart.
Pb 1!!! Growing revenue. Stop panicking.
Your running out of time to take advantage of the Wall Street AI computers Why they are always 100% wrong. They were wrong on the upside for KHC at $96 and they are way wrong on the downside for KHC at $32. If you want to be the next billionaire bob you are going to need to learn when the AI computers go wacko on the upside and on the downside and IT is up to you if you want to take advantage of the Wall Street AI computers. Time to start picking up shares of KHC
This stock is fire . Just amazing
"Look on the bright side, if you buy today you got it cheaper than Warren Buffett"
"Ok. Yahoos deleted my post so let’s try again. As I said, enough with the cheesy comments people, let’s grow up, stock will ketchup in no time."
"Question how many on yahoo, use KHC products? I am one that for sure does, We also used to use GIS products every month we would spend about $70 a month between all products, pet food was the biggest cost. We are now boycotting all GIS products and after Kellogg's earnings it looked like a lot of just switched from GIS to Kellogg's products. I don't see us switching anytime soon from any KHC products. If anything we more than likely will be trying some of the new products. How about you?"
"KHC is now safer to buy than AAPL, Why KHC has taken the hit. AAPL still has to take the hit for over reporting earnings , Why because they have not been paying QCOM so their earnings have been reported higher than they should have been . SELL AAPL and BUY KHC"
This is a Buy of. A Lifetime...
Rollover dividend rinse repeat see you in ten years
if you collect dividend and it is not cut for next 10 years that is $25 a share you earn. If share price stays same for 10 years you still make out ok.
"Next time buy GIS instead, forget what Warren does."
May just be a rumor but looks like they are going to start spending to aquire some top organic product producers. The market is huge and there are plenty of companies looking to get acquired from a giant in the industry.
total debt 31 plus billlion and they only have 1.45 billion in cash banks could call their loan in
"This won’t be a quick turn, they’re going to need to increase spending to develop new brands and market more effectively with the old ones. The problem is they already have a big debt load and they said they want to stay investment grade in their credit rating. This means a dividend cut is on the table in the next year or two if business doesn’t improve. The rate they can borrow at should be no problem. The other unknown is what the trade war will do to food supply and prices in the near future."
"Only novice investors like me sold at 25, except I didnt sell. I bought 5K more and some calls to go with it."
look the little engine that could is buying. big value hedgy coming in for a great value play!!! the same folks that said bgs is a great buy and its divy is safe. lol
Probably will close near 31.90
Holding well----------60 2019
"Kraft is a defensive stock, may do whll in this stock market turmoil..."
At sixty price this will move fast gaining momentum and respect
disappointed in the share reaction..buyer with divedends long term. on right path now i believe
"Hey, fools, the new CEO from AmBev is taking write downs early in his tenure. WHY? For obvious reasons; He can book the bad news on the write downs and that will accelerate his claims to future ""growth"". In other words, push the corpses out the window and go on with life. Now he no longer has to put up with the smell and the company can breathe again. Now, take a look at the list of products and tell me how many of them you buy. Buy the stock. The corpses are gone."
Overreaction. YoY everyone is doing bad and there was no expectations to beat that. It’s about not being in a dying company. It’s about growth moving forward.
The $0.4 dividend is at a 5% yield then stock starts to recover and after many years the stock recovers and gets its old dividend of $0.6 and gets a 7.5% yield. Pair this up with the stock moving up to a price of around $55 (what price Buffett bought in at) a 70% move over probably the course of 8-10 years and a high yielding dividend this is so much money to be made.
Back to 40 soon.
"Lol silly nonsense, wishful thinking at best, track down past Berkshire hathaways ie (warren “you bobb on my every move because you don’t know what you’re doing Buffet’s 13f filings and READ. the Berkshire 13f filing show 570,470,868 shares that is a DECREASE from 3g selling and not warren selling last year. The notes of the sec13f tells how many shares are owned and the relationship between 3g and Berkshire.. Part 2 As a result of the relationships described in this Part 2 of Exhibit A, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Warren E. Buffett, 3G Global Food Holdings LP and certain of Global Food Holdings LP’s affiliates may be deemed to be a group for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Act. As of December 31, 2019, the foregoing persons collectively owned 570,470,868 shares of common stock of the issuer. Warren buffet (geez you ppl have a serious man crush on a 90 year old) said last year “he will not BUY OR SELL shares of KHC regardless of price"". I read somewhere he has a khc cost basis of $51 a share from the deal and looked very good as it was trading at $80-90 a share. You ppl don’t have access to those deals so again I say following someone else’s movements and finding out MONTHS later after they have done them is silly. If you really care so much what buffet does then just buy brk b shares."
"This needs to drop more before I even consider buying this. This is a long term investment. As long as the rich get richer and the poor becomes poorer, process foods will flourish."
it will go below 15. been saying it for 2 years. They aren't addressing debt. If they don't suspend the dividend and address it. it will continue to drop. lower than 15.
got to come clean with financials and move on before anyone will believe in this stock long
recession-proof company
Could this be the dead cat bounce??????
I really wonder how far down it can go. I don't think it will see 28... ever. But I do wonder!
Only day traders play KHC now. Who can trust KHC which is always down 20% right after every single earning report?!
This is a horrible company imo. For once Cramer was right. Amazon is expanding to take on groceries giant Walmart. Too me that seems like food prices will go lower.
Alejandro. He probably has a lot more money than you. Have some respect.
have cash waiting for double bottom if it comes.. great chance to add
Earnings for Q1 should be out by end of July as per last press release
Don't believe the Hype produced by alleged analysts concerning the demise of Kraft-Heinz share price.These pseudo analysts want the small investor to sell and drive the price down so the money peoplecan buy on the cheap and then drive the price up. Hold because KHC is very stable and they pay agreat dividend. Everybody has to eat and that's Kraft Heinz's business.
"The intrinsic value of KHC, is about $93.40, so, it's an incredible value, a deeply discounted screaming BUY at the present level, in the $34's. With a 4.6% divvy as well, it's a no brainer."
This is Just HILARIOUS
3 times my target ownership - Ave price $32.49. Need this stock price to show positive movement (up) along with some good news. Dividends positive.
Great company. Buy now
Lool at BGS today... will be back soon!
"Purchased Oscar Mayer prepackaged spiced ham with smoke favor. This product is losing ground in quality. Whole bunch of white spots (which represents fat) more than usual. It tasted as if a whole bottle of smoke was added to the mix. My family and I have noticed that the quality of their package lunch meats are not up to par.Last package of regular ham was feed to the cat. The cat wouldn’t even eat the spiced ham. I’m calling tmrw, I want my $3.00 back."
"Without M&A news,KHC will very likely retest support at 54.11."
"It will take some time, but this mac and cheese mess will get cleaned up pretty easily and stock will ketchup. BUY on the massive DIP."
From $27 to $31Taking a breather.$55 Soon!!!
35 here we come
This has only one direction to go . Join the train before it’s too late
Glad I got the hell out at $31 with a loss. Next they are going to cut the dividend again. Not good. Buffet is going to buy it after that point. probably for $20 a share.
"People keep talking about how tastes have changed and people want organic and healthy etc. Thats all true but most blue collar Americans aren’t going to pay $1 extra for something just because it says organic. Kraft still sells the cheap Mac and Cheese boxes with powdered cheese for a reason, it’s what many Americans and college students can afford. Even with the debt problems I think this stock is a buy at these prices."
Everything was going so smooth until the 3G sale. Seems I was within a couple of weeks of breaking even at 31.36. Now it seems it could take 6 mos to a year. Any thoughts where price might be 1 year from now if div remains.
"This stock is definitely a buy at these level. With a recession on the horizon, food stocks with their generous dividends hold up. With 3g capital and Berkshire Hathaway at the Helm it will only be a matter of time before this stock will traject higher. Buy and hold this one ."
Looks like we picked up a buyer creating a position.
KHC is under book value stock. Pandemic is the time to turn around for this company it becomes essential for family to used more product. It will increase sell and make a profits for next quarterly reports. Buy and stay on course for long term investors and collect the dividend.
i guess turkey isnt going to order their yearly case of ketchup

"can I make a suggestion to KHC longs here? If you haven't already tried it - give maxwell house ""bold"" coffee a try. The ones in the K cups. it is absolutely delicious, buttery and a very flavorful dark roast coffee. To me; it tastes as good as anything any other coffee brand has to offer; especially those store brand generic coffees. It is cheaper than the other premium brands too. give it a try; you'll be pleased you did. Commercial over."
Goldman downgrade day before x-date?
bought some today at 66.80. Looks like an easy 10%. GL all.
we got plenty of shares for you on level 2 eat it buy it up
Great Long-term buy considering you'll reinvest the nice 7% yield.
It seems that the denial and delusional state is hitting some longs. There is zero reason for this to go up. Reasons for a bottom include: Completely cutting the dividend and focusing on debt repayment. Updating the brands to include more healthy options. Firing the executive suite. Increasing revenues and profits. There is NONE of this going on. Hence you will see lower and lower share prices. The only reason this is still above 30 is more bagholders buying because they think the drop is a good buying opportunity. Just like they were saying the 45 was good. then 35 was great. then 34 was great. now 33 is great. tomorrow 32 will be awesome buy. it will be an awesome buy down into the 20s. I guess losing is awesome.
Shocking to see how few people follow this thread and cover KHC.
"Folks tomorrow we go up... it has fallen too much and I have caught the fallen knife . Lol  So tomorrow the the shorts will be covering. Management is kinda quiet, something might be brewing!! KHC will be at $42 - $43.75 very soon. The drop was to much, it will bounce."
Listen up you pseudo stock analysts. Kraft Heinz is going up because people must eat.All this B/S created by you guys is only an attempt to shake the little investor out of hismoney. I understand how you drive the stock price down so the money people can buyKHC on the cheap. Then it will turn around and who gets screwed?
Unilever might try to buy KHC.
buffet the genius
This message board is mainly fraud. Good buy and divvy here.
dividend solid..slow rebound
personally I'm counting on an easy 30
"BOYS....LETS LOOK AT THE FACTS. IF NOT FOR BUFFETTS 25% OWNERSHIP WE WOULD ALL BE IN TROUBLE. FRANKLY, ITS WHAT CAUGHT MY EYE AND INTERESTED ME IN THE COMPANY !!! HOWEVER, BUFFETT WILL DO WHATS NECESSARY TO TURN THIS AROUND. HE AINT LETTIN HIS PRIDE AND MONEY GO DOWN THE DRAIN. BUFFETT HAS THE WHERE WITH ALL TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY.....SO RELAX FELLAS !!!!"

"Company cut to the bone and is now having trouble making money, debt is increasing and even with the current boom in the middle aisles are drawing down on credit while continuing to suck out 1.6 billion in annual dividend like a vampire . what could go wrong?"
Buffett needs to flush out management.
I like the new CEO idea of improving existing brands. We do have a 70% market share in Heinz kep and 68% of philly cream ch.The fuure looks good imo.
"I think in the near future everybody sees who brought more piece of the cake, Startet even myself 34,58 first piece"
big upside coming
"Put a buy order in before market at 33.35 , got the shares . Company has been cut in 1/2 over the last 12 months might have a little more downside but bought to hold for a while . Company still making money , dividend over 4% still looks good at this price !"
Looks like they want to spin off Maxwell house. Time to start computing a sum-of-the-parts valuation for KHC. Thinking it has to be higher than current market cap.
I own khc at 34.89 but like con agra better. They have better portfolio of foods such as healthy choice and Marie calendar's. But also offers generic foods for under a dollar such as banquet frozen dinners. And kellogg's makes a power protein bar 3 egg whites 6 almonds 4 cashews no bs rxbar

"when they introduce oscar mayer sausages in a squeeze bottle that you store upside down, you know it’s time to sell"
patiently waiting
KHC down $2 after hours. Is that real?
Why the after hours movement though?
In on calls. Will bounce back to about -5% EOD.
America is on a long-term trend to eat healthier. Kraft needs better products better marketing and branding.
I have much compassion for those in need but get real here. The share price dumped and has been down and struggling for years. The company lowered its dividend and had sat in the twenties with no performance. It's a company that owes its shareholders something. Perform as a company and then be charitable.
buffet can't buy the company until they announce earnings at least ---everyone would be screaming insider trading. let's get serious people
Probably nothing going to happen here until the turnaround plan is released in early 2020. Just collect div and patiently wait for the plan. The only problem will be tax loss selling which could send this down another leg.

yessir!
ATT Pays a Great Dividend ! NOT Cut !
Ripe for a takeover? I wonder what the value would be.
Don’t short this stock.. you will lose your shirt
Seems like a value buy at this point for poeple who aren’t in it. It’s not like they going bankrupt
"Buffett honestly admitted so many times in both public and private meetings that he made this mistake. He is successful bc of few investment failures in a long long time frame. Unluckily, KHC is one of the few! Everytime When you mention Buffett here, you show how bearish KHC is now and future. Why don’t you follow his tons of success? Why do you follow this only one failure so stubbornly?"
"so we'll give you 2% today, but we'll take 4% by the weekend. abbot and costello economics."
I bet they will Buyout UNFI! Strong buy here!
"KHC can market virtually ANYTHING they produce and the stock is down 5%! What is wrong with this picture?This is certainly not a vote of confidence. The only event that's positive is the dividend payout in a few days, if you DRIP you get more shares!"

It’s Kraft!!! They’ll turn it around and 12 months from now we will wish we had mortgaged the house to as many shares as possible. See you at 35.00.
They will recover in time. They have very popular products
"I guess people just read headlines from the prFollowing this initial SEC document request, the Company together with external counsel launched an investigation into the procurement area. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of findings from the investigation, the Company recorded a $25 million increase to costs of products sold as an out of period correction as the Company determined the amounts were immaterial to the fourth quarter of 2018 and its previously reported 2018 and 2017 interim and year to date periods. Additionally, the Company is in the process of implementing certain improvements to its internal controls to mitigate the likelihood of this occurring in the future and has taken other remedial measures. The Company continues to cooperate fully with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.At this time, the Company does not expect the matters subject to the investigation to be material to its current period or any prior period financial statements."
Recent dividend increase thank you for the Blessing adding thank you .
Maybe painting the last day of the quarter
Ivz another reason it's flying. Investors seeking momentum may have Dynamic Semiconductors Invesco ETF (PSI) on radar now. The fund recently hit a new 52-week high. Shares of PSI are up approximately 68.1% from their 52-week low of $44.68/share.
cutting dividend?
Kitchen sink qrt. Get the books right so WB can take it private.
I am glad to see KHC get away from the $30 price.
"Here's my prediction. Post earnings, shares will jump to between 34 and 35. The transparency will give investors the confidence to begin trading this stock with dignity. It'll be @ 40 dollars comfortably by November."
"Just a thought. So Buffet owns about 325 million shares..his company has 21 billion to invest...anyone think he may use that cash and just buy back the rest of the company cheap, and then turn this baby around. Wall street is having a hey day with this, but it does have significant sales and is a big company. As far as writes off, Yahoo did not do an in-depth report, but if I was new guy coming in, you might as well clean the balance sheet right off the start. Goodwill is usually amortized so I do not know what brands were written down, but Buffet is already in big, his company has tons of cash, and rumor is he has been looking for a company to buy, why not buy this thing cheap, after value has been driven down by writing off goodwill, and make it on the upside, while getting a dividend?"
"When others are fearful, be greedy?"
back too 30s
KHC should be around $38.00 for March 15 opex
Strategy matters Warren....cut cut cut is not a strategy----you will see $24 before this is over---sell sell sell is a strategy. May be the best short in the S&Ps. Capitalism even run by Warren has financial engineering limits.
"hahha it's funny to see when price goes up or down. So many ""Told you so"" starts showing up. I wondering why you guys still haven't been billionaires with this much accuracy lol ."
Yet another cowardly analyst who downgrades a company after a rise from the ashes.....KHC was in the 90's a number of years ago. The dividend is secure. The new CEO is making the right moves. Patience will be rewarded. Sniff test says that JPM wanted to buy it lower and gets to do so now that their analyst has downgraded the stock. Classic willful manipulation.

A serious question ——we can all agree that after the earnings come out the stock will either go much higher or much lower —-there is no way it stays where it is—-how best to play the volatility?
The investigation will turn up dirt every couple weeks for the next few months. This company won't get a break for a very long time.

In for the dividend
"Steve Grasso, of Mad Money, large fan of KHC"
The earnings date shown on platforms is an estimation that algorithms give for the expected date of earnings....look before you leap
Management did NOT go far enough in cutting the dividend! It is obvious KHC has debt problems and needs to invest more into their existing brands and the organic space. Only way to do that in the time frame needed is to completely eliminate the dividend for several years. This slow bleed shows lack of strong leadership. Need a new CEO that will level set investors realistically and do what is needed.

i can see 45$ per share in less than 1 year. buying more that this level. Dividend is stable after the last cut.
This thing isn’t close to where it deserves to be. Let’s go now. Full steam ahead.
What I want to know is why are these analysts pushing fake news . Khc is s gold mine folks !
32 billion in debt and possible cooked books. If the US goes into recession there is a good chance this doesn’t make it. Assuming realistic cash flow and positive you are still talking about 120 years to pay off that debt at this rate.The dividend will be cut. If the stock doesn’t fall on that news you will know the bottom is in. Until then stay away from this. Don’t double down until you know it has bottomed.

"Aside from KHCs present issues as the market continues to decline and possibly experiences a years overdue market correction KHC is going along for the ride. There is a likely ultimate bottom in the 40s. I am wondering about the sustainability of the dividend at it’s present level. Over 5% at the current price. While reducing the dividend would have an understandable negative impact on the price, a reduction to a 3% return would amount to approx 1.25 billion dollars that could be used towards debt reduction or acquisitions."
It’s just a old company/brand......that’s all! Father Time is undisputed
The low interest rate will make it easy for the KHC to pay off their loan...no issue with saving dividends while paying down loan

A lot of people got clobbered today. For those like myself who got hung out to dry at 33 today was redemption if you sold. I didn't. I had calls at 30 and 32 that I had sold that put my break even down below 29. I did buy puts at 32.50 as I think there was a hugh amount of short covering. Well see how long it takes for the excitement to level off. This company is very troubled and a good report doesn't wash away all the problems
"It's obvious the Senior management of this company has no idea what it's doing - the whole lot of them should be fired. All they know how to do is write off the mess they made.The FIRST thing they should do is become price competitive. If they are losing market share because of their pricing - GET PRICE COMPETITIVE. Instead of cutting marketing budgets to reduce costs, reduce the senior management staff that aren't hands on. The shareholders have taken hugh hit both capital gains wise and income wise. It's time to dump ALL the existing management compensation arrangements and tie them DIRECTLY to company performance. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out."
Ive been telling everyone this is oversold. You always buy when everyone is so negative. The problems facing KHC are not fundamental and can be fixed. Longterm this is a great value and dividend investment!
Warren Buffett needs to do something!
At this level. It can go private
$38.50 is still too expensive.
Just like yesterday......Start high finish LOW
"Will reduce stake at $42, buy back if dips"
"Stock looks cheap at this price but they need to get rid of some of the financial engineers who think cutting is magic and bring in marketing and branding professional (and I do not mean any old MBA with their Gent charts and Ven diagrams).Should be paying debt down while actually working towards growing brands with a little more imagination than they are currently using. Cheap entry point with limited short term downside, should be able to tell whether things are improving or not before stock drops much more. Oh yea if any fees for consulting or other services are being paid to the Brazilian hedge fund folks it should be stopped immediately."
"The fact is until the whole plan is out in Jan , you are gambling that KHC is not going to cut the dividend. The Fact is with all the debt and drop in revenue and YOY drop of 9% and still dropping KHC still needs to fix the business, That is going to take lots of cash. All depends on how fast they want to fix the business and how much money it's going to take whether they cut the dividend all the way to a penny like a GE or not at all. Gamble if you want , but I would not invest in KHC even with your money , because I am not on the inside and know how fast they want to fix the business and how much money it going to take. If they don't fix KHC fast then KHC is not going higher any time soon either , because of the slow drip of still losing revenue with products that are over priced against store brands."
KHC is now a sitting duck for a takeover-yes they have problems and $30 b in debtThey went after UN and I thought they should buy MDLZNow the tables have turned UN has a $150 b in mkt cap MDLZ $70b And KHC $58bUnilever could easily do this if they wanted to. What Buffett does is the question---does he buy more or does he want outBTW He'll be on CNBC for 2 hours Monday--lots of questions
Finally getting earnings tomorrow...i think. Consensus EPS Forecast 0.60 or the worse QTR by a long shot in company history. Should be a number they can beat but you never really know with KHC. I will be disappointed with anything under .65.
"they found a cure, it's baked beans! ;-D"
Buying the dips :)
"Glad I didn't take the dividend bait. We may hit a new 52 week low today. Which means, somewhat literally that KHC can't even PAY people to buy their stock right now."
15x normal volume traded in KHC today so far. Long or short that’s a lot of stocks.
Wall St. has been brutal with some big name company's. KHC's 5.5% yield plus the huge upside is ok with me!!
"A company that is loosing money, but at$28 plus div in my opinion going in for 100 share is o.k."
I'm glad I averaged down at $24
This reminds me of GE
Holding strong
"52 after hours just puts it where it belongs. Look at chart, lower highs and lows all the way down."
"Another 47M shares trades today but the stock is only down 2%...same as Friday, opened 28% down and stayed there all day, a lot more buyers than sellers it seems at these high rating levels"
"Management knows what to do. . .get rid of the dividend, its just a matter of when."
At this level someone will buy this company. The question is who?
"After reading transcripts of the call, and reading all of what Patricio had to say, I’ll be keeping my position and giving them this year to turn things around and get the dividend heading up."
Will wait 24-25
"Our Leader Mr. Kraft got in to some trouble down at a Sauna in Florida. The stock should take another 5% hit because of that. However, the stock will trend back up when investors realize Mr. Kraft was just having a good time and no one got hurt."
it's going to hover @ 30 to 31 up until July 31
I went to the store... People are pilling and getting tons of reserve of kraft/heinz products for the quarantaine... Q1 will be amazing!!! Shelves were almost empty!!!
How does KHC expect to succeed when the entire leadership team is composed of outsiders to the food and consumer packaged goods industry? Winners in the industry understand consumer behavior and have experience navigating the complexities of retail relationships. For KHC executives these are new concepts.
U guys ready from some power bottom action tomorrow??
"So where's the $38 today? $48 by end if week lolSame deal for GOOSAs I said before, to make money go opposite of the posting consensus."
KHC at 25$ was a gift
"mar30 call volume active at moment. with that, tomorrow we also watch pep. we don't own, but hold ko."
Gonna double in bears faces
"Buy at all lows...Buy at all levels.. its the company brand valuation, check sales which are increasing. Inspite of higher input cost it will reach higher levels next quarter."
This is now a SCREAMING BUY!!
Costco charging close to $9 for a 2 pack of organic ketchup. whats up with that ???
"The business is going through a fundamental change. All the BS that’s going on here is by short minded investors. A reorganisation takes time. There is quite obviously a positive action happening as per the ceo addressing the shareholders. If you guys want to drop your pants and get out good luck to you. As far as my other investments go. Pull your money out and run. Just made a small fortune in my other investments. Tesla being one of them. Please stop thinking Heinz will fold. Not possible, Europeans(as one of the more healthy countries. Ie not fat Americans.) still enjoy tomato ketchup. Baked beans etc. Get ready for the jump. Obvynot today. Fat Americans are running, but I guarantee this puppy doesn’t fold. Now. Ready for questions..."
Bought in @ 24 going to hang out awhile
25 on Monday
Ok......here we go !!!!
Back in 2016/17 KHC was a $90+ stock. Wonders do happen so lets go KHC!
"This company is so undervalued, debt repayments, focusing on core assets, improved cash flows. This stock is cheap"
New PE is 17.16 (62.12/3.62) with the last qtr earnings factored in.
"If I read the Form 10-K correctly, KHC should go up Monday to $30+ by early morning, then shorts may want to cover driving the price higher, but there appears to be only 20 million shares shorted."
Earnings seem to be positive judging from the money flowing in with the bottom form and nice upward slope crossing the medium line.
"Just remember, disruptors get crushed or bought out. KHC ain't going anywhere"
a lot of call options for friday at 20.79
The shorts are covering as KHC earnings are improving. Long way to go
still making money..sell off is short term..buyer tomorrow..this will be fixed slowly
The virus will rage for months to come. Kraft should do very well. The vaccine will not be available for mass application until late next year.
Sold 30 puts at an average exercise price of $29.50 with 2/14 expiry. Will pocket $3500 if price closes above $30 after earnings release.
dude...its at the bottom..and warren buffet. Serouisly...this is a steal.
This is the first earnings season that I have seen the earnings dates so messed up.
Hot new tech stock Kraft Heinz leads market gainers for consecutive days.
Aaron your put purchases are worthless now you need to start averaging down. this stock is nothing but up
me likey ketchup
What changes from Fri it should be 40$
"Been following this stock for a few years and am really happy to see the steady growth. Miguel’s plan was to reinvest in building Kraft Heinz’s brands and stop the constant cost cutting that 3g was known for. My question to all investors is do people really care about name brand in the grocery store? ( or is store brand okay)My fear is that when the millennials and gen z do most of the grocery shopping the trend towards consumers purchasing store brands is going to affect Kraft negatively long term. Didn’t know where else to post this, I am considering increasing my investment but can’t get this thought out of the back of my head. Love to hear some feedback"
Oh I'd love to be an Oscar Meyer Weiner...... But Now Only Warren Still Love Me Me Me..........Sing it...........Sing it !
"ALL ABOARD, UP WE GO!"
"Just another side note , when the risk trades diminish later this year there will be a flight to safety . It's better to be a little early than to get caught with the wrong securities in a downturn."
Don’t listen to fake news . This stock will soar to 60 end of year . USA USA USA
"Classical turnaround play. New management needs to make the right moves, then there should be a huge potential at current valuations. Patience is needed, however. Don`t think that dividend will be cut further in the short term, divestments will help to cover this."
"I am buying today for the dividend, Goes ex dividend on Mar 7 2019 and you get paid on Mar 22 2019. I will now hold and get paid and be getting paid almost 4.8% on my money . Sell if you want to , but if you sold smartly you could be getting $2-$5 more for your shares , You can sell calls that get you a lot more for your shares than selling them today plus you would get the dividends until they are taken away from you . At least sell your shares were you get the most for them"
"this stock will be up 10 bucks in two weeks, watch"
OMG it's green for once since it tanked. Thank God.
This stock will fly high soon . Wait for it
I told you guys the bottom was in !! Time to buy before it jumps to $42 - $45.
Buffet no longer the man. He suffered a $2.8 billion loss from Kraft.
Trump is going to tweet at 2AM Wednesday that he hates Heinz ketchup.The market is just leading!
KHC is selling off product lines now including its Maxwell House coffee to raise cash. Looks like company is in trouble financially and liquidation very possible.
"This stock has completely bottomed on the 5 year chart. Sellers will be dried up soon enough. Would be nice to fill that gap from 36-45 early next year. 45 will be a formidable resistance but if it breaks through that, no reason it cant double from right here"
Stay indoors! Don’t eat out. Cook with Kraft
KHC's new slogan... We guarantee our pizza deliery in 29 minutes. Or we add 2 free tickets to Oprah show.
My kids love Oscar Mayer beef franks.I hope they stay in business....
The action is painful but its resetting the market and has taken out alot of speculation in sectors some which are deals here finally $aapl $amzn $shop $ddd $msft $nndm $qqq $khc
China probably needs to stock up Kraft food now.
Did you get some shares of KHC when the Wall Street AI computers put it on sale. If not it's till not to late to make that first purchase for sure you need to start buying shares on any sell offs. KHC has priced in about all the bad things that could or would happen and when they don't KHC will be a lot higher and fast. Always remember the power of compounding with dividend reinvestment and that no matter what Warren always ends up a winner in the long run. I would think earnings just might not be as bad as people think. KHC does have some new products hitting the shelves. Make that first buy and get ready to buy more. If you want to take advantage of Wall Street AI computers putting KHC on a big sale price for you. All up to you what you want to do.
"PINCH ME ! L@@KS Like I'm Leaving the KHC Bagholder Club !PM @33.70.....Long 3125@ 32.90.At Least PM, I'm Whole Again ! Thanks for the Upgrade MS !"
Watch out below on earnings in the coming days........the cliff will be a steep drop!
26 is the line
"KHC trades at 10X of EBITDA, GIS trades at 12.54X and CAG trades at 14.55X - If earnings are solidified at next announcement and hold at $7B EBITDA this could see a nice climb to $40. Lets see if they can be trusted on their earnings announcement and things hold if not all bets are off."
"add on all pull backs..generational recovery, food inflation"
60 end of year . Mark it !
I stopped buying there products about three years ago. I find all of their products unhealthy. Read the ingredients on the bottle. Even there organic products are not great. This is a sugar and salt company.
Instructed my employees to buy only Kraft - Heinz brands for our yearly company barbecue this weekend !! Also will be giving out big bottles of Ketchup to all employees. True... Lol 
"take a look at what price level WB bought Bac....to falling knives, WB always picked them up from the ground!"
Hope it makes its usual late day run.
buffett finally wakes up to reality? bwahahahhhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/25/buffett-says-berkshire-hathaway-overpaid-for-kraft-following-last-weeks-stock-plunge.html?&qsearchterm=
KHC should go way pass 90 as the new management has fixed the talent issue created by previous management. Sales growing again in secular trend.
this is probluy the most oversold i seen a stock in years p/e at 3 and over 20% percent under book value its like the company is going bankrupt
With the accounting scandal far behind it kHc has stabilized and now we will see if new management can move ahead and do something transformative
3 hours ago · Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery upgraded Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC) from Underweight to Neutral with a price target of $31.00.
The Kraft Heinz Co Book Value Per Share : $42.32 (As of Sep. 2019)
Food will never go away . Buffett told me that once in a interview meeting at my college campus . Remember this !
ceo has spent most of his time planning next superbowl ad and doesn't have a clue how to compete against store bands that are cheaper and high quality besides tv ads. khc will take out a massive loans to support dividend and marketing while sales decline as people decide to not have high blood pressure and/or diabetes from KHC's line of food.
What are you talkin about it beat on top and bottom.
Any news for this spike ?
"It's not about KHC anymore, the whole market is selling off. Hope investors can discern where value is in times of uncertainty. Cheers and good luck to all!"
"Just wait till the social media rabit crowd pile in to KHC and push it up like Gamestop , SKT...... , KHC has lots of room to go up."
"Yeah. It appears 32 +/- a few cents is the bottom. Kraft isn’t going anywhere people. Lowest of lows, time to buy."
Will somebody just close the doors on this place already?
MOMENTUM MEANS TO BUY WHY BECAUSE ON THE WAY TO DISTRIBUTION AS ACCUMULATION COMPLETED
Told you. 20% still to go. strap in and keep you arms and legs inside the equity at all times.
every time we get here..some rag like barons runs some negative bs story with old news or fake news
"Be fearful when people are greedy, be greedy when people are fearful"
So much for the accuracy of Investopedia! Didn't figure earnings would be released without a Co. press release.
"in 2013 revenue was 6000, 2016 26400, 2017 26200..... get it? That's not a deathblow."
Warren is either buying or dumping. price and volume suggest he his buying
I’m in @$27.10 and this is going to be fun
"What a mess this company is, I owned this company prior to the partnership with the current company. Why would any company deal with a foreign company that was and is a PoS company to begin with ??"
Well I hope the news is fairly good tomorrow. Started my position before it breached $48. Good luck longs.
Where did all the fearmongers go today ? Maybe there's better to short now ?! Just saying
We rarely find such a historically impactful snack brand like KHC out there! It defines American’s taste preference and happy memories generation by generation. Huge intangible value for sure! The is the power of branding which it takes an era to build!
going to 40
Will KHC meet the goals on next ER?
Buffet investment price is 30.
"Listened to the earnings call this morning and was very disappointed. I think it was the CFO who couldn’t pronounce McCafe properly. I know he’s Brazilian and English is a second language but come on, that’s in your wheelhouse. And if I hear another sentence that stars with “headwinds” I’m going to throw up. Business, like life, is all about headwinds. If you’re as agile as you claim to be, you embrace headwinds. Just my 2 cents because I’m down mucho donero"
For sure now any moves lower in KHC are now opportunities to buy and start lowering your costs.
If buffet were smart he would buy the remaining shares in this POS
This is a buy! Restated earnings decline are already accounted with the current share price. Price will jump to $45 before end of May IMO
Khc will have a less spectacular Qtr coming up. Grocery sales are normalizing after initial panic stock up. Sales mix will skew a little more to lower margin items. Foodservice sales will be marginally lower. Probably a little bad debt write off. Maybe some routine asset write down.. increased operating expenses with additional staffing and covid measures.I’ll add bigly for cheap after next ER
BUY BUT BUY. 50IES ARROUND THE CORNER
"AI and Bots and their handlers having fun today going into 3 day market holiday. KHC yanked 2% without even so much as a kiss. small volume so while pain is real, this too will pass. mindful, and something to hang on to if you're long, no reputed analysts are suggesting any news of any import to headline february 20. this is good."
"Not a specialist in technical analysis, but we broke a strong resistance @ 36-37. excellent signal for a rally !"
"the more coronavirus, the more khc will boom."
"Springboard's first partnership was created today.David Chang's Momofuku debuts new flavors of SSAM sauce nationwide on amazon.com.In other news,Morgan Stanley cut their price target for KH from $80 to $73."
"Truly amazing the amount of people saying Buffet has lost it......They have $175B in equity's and business's plus over $100B in CASH. A stock he has go's down, ok. Get over it. I think about every 10 years people say his strategy is old and will not work anymore. I would rather invest in company's he is in vs. not."
easy to see the short sellers and their always negative agenda trying to scare everyone to panic.. amusing to me..the lower it goes the more I will buy..so thank you to all the negative nellies
3.09 earnings TTM. Give it a 10PE max for a company with falling sales = 30.90. Maybe an 8PE is more appropriate if they cant stop the sales downtrend = 24.72. Cant see any reason to value it higher. It popped on an earnings beat but the underlying problems are still very much there.
"I don't understand it either. No news that I can see. It's not a tech stock, maybe that's it."
Is something going on after hours? ￼+$1.42 ??
I predict a huge run up on Kraft dinner
"its been a few YEARS now and khc is still worse off than it was then. management is still playing games not knowing what to do to fix things, the dividend is eating declining profits up and they're patting themselves on paying 2b in debt in 2019 while they have another 10-11B to get rid of to the even be at the dreadful CAG levels of debt. its awful."
Wonder how much Buffet bought on the big drop??? Time will tell
Reminds me of General Mills 18 months ago.GIS know up 25% with 6 divis in the bank !
"funny, when i type in khc, yahoo brings me to CHK (-30%) today. odd."
Wow! Surging... AGAIN. I'm fed up of reading Value Investing is dead.
"Remember to start building that long term position in KHC and always the real power of investing is dividends and the power of compounding them with dividend reinvestment over the long term . Stock flippers always go broke. How , because all it takes is for an airplane to hit a tower and all the fast money will lose all their money fast, That is why Warren Buffett always ends up on top in the end over any long term investment. The only down side to how Warren invest is you have to take advantage of follish people who are always selling when they really should be buying."
Buy when ppl fear. KHC is the staple.
take the dividend and wait. when economy crashes ....and it always does ..it is a cycle .. people will forsake whole foods for mac'n cheese. in a recession khc will do well. so just sit back and collect the fat dividend
Without even thinking I just bought in . 534 shares let’s go !
"mindful, cfd's international short interest approaching 70% today. never seen it that short. not saying heloc the cabin and ranch land, but shall be some fire sales offered on many a good company. in the gundlach and j. mc afee inflation return camp."
I'm looking at doing some research to invest in this company.... Can somebody give me a general idea on why this company has been beaten down so much over the last 5 years? Seems to be on the upswing. Appreciate in advance any help you can give me. Cheers.
Buffett paid 9.8 billion for 3.25.4 million shares and counting his dividends is about break even or slightly under water. We have a chance to buy for less then Buffett who imho is the greatest investor of all time.
"So processed food companies are doomed, huh? Kraft Heinz products are selling faster than they can make them right now all over the world."
Got filled 2500@ 34.55.. putting this one away for awhile.
Why KHC is up today
Good job KRAFT.
25 in 2 months
Was yesterday a short squeeze or would that be even more violent to the upside?
"I got dividend reinvested at $38 and change, the low on Friday was high 39 and 40.Do they discount dividend reinvestment?"
I will buy in at 35
"BREAKING NEWS ! CNN Reporting Armed Conflict India VS Pakistan.Stock Futures Tanked 150 Points, IN SECONDS."
I HAVE DECIDED TO HELP OUT BUFFET .TOMORROW I WILL START PAVING MY DRIVEWAY WITH KRAFT SINGLES.
"Kraft is fake food. Empty calories, GMO, chemically enhanced. Reduce Kraft and that will reduce health care costs."
I knew I shoulda been loading up in 50s
did you notice the golden cross on khc chart ? heading to 40 now
"i have $46 ave, down 19k... i feel so bad. don't know should i hold this or no...."
Looks like he is going to take Kraft Private...based on that video.
buy at $20
I made good money in the stock market today thanks to Trumps booming US economy unfortunately Kraft Heinz took a dump so what’s going on.
I want to buy in but am not sure if KHC has reached bottom yet?
oversold
A real company with hundreds of products making money and paying down debt and paying 4% dividend ....why would anyone want to buy that? Not thin air crypto fantasy
Like the jeffersons song goes...mov'n on up
Interesting after hours bidding
Even if the stock drops 20% today like after hours the dividend is still significantly lower than it was yesterday. This will need a massive drop off if I'm going to consider buying it.
"Market cap bigger then $KHC, and I can't even buy a bottle of ketchup with DOGE. Things that make me go hummmm..."

"I bought up 1,200 shares on Friday. That's how sure I am of this. Watched my order fill over the course of the day. Even if it only rises $5 in the next week or two and I expect it to. I'd rather have my cash in this stock than lying in a bank account."
i am glad to see 3G go they have done nothing good for this company. i bet buffet will stay
"without going into specifics, numbers of people making large buys on the cheap. these buys could prove to be huge money trees or...not."

"Yo, Warren dude, do you think that KHC shares look cheap now after their plunge?Warren dude: Nope, they don't.I see."
watching and waiting to nail my next purchase at good price
This is a great company . We will go past 100 in the next year !
The last quarter earnings release was the time to sell. Pre announced possible cut to dividend. Just because Buffet owns it doesn’t make a good decision. Buffet him self said on CNBC it was a mistake last quarter.
"Look at Hasbro today.Reported brutal earnings pre-market and yet is up 4% today after retail investors were shaken out in the morning.KHC will rally when you least expect it.For now,the beatngs will continue until you start enjoying them....haha."
Just doing my part of being greedy when others are fearful
costco..khc mac and.cheese was.selling like.crazy
"I bought some heinz a while back, I sure hope it can 'catchup' to the rest of the market, I don't like feeling the 'squeeze' thus far...the whole thing feels like 'rotten tomatoes' to me."
Hey 'T' As in ATT Pays a REAL Huge Dividend.Just Sayin.........
"12% increase in ketchup packet prices due to demand. 25% increase in production coming. An institution just bought 30 million dollars worth of this stock about 30 minutes ago on the block.Burry and Buffet are both extremely bullish on this stock.I bought 400 options contracts with $41 strike price earlier today, plus 1000 shares. Feeling like they need to start making ketchup green again because that's all I'm seeing is green."
Fed model shows a greater than 60% odds of a recession. What kind of food will everyone be forced to buy when the u employment rate rises to 8%+? Going long KHC
"Comfortable holding here from 29 with a dividend yield of 5%. Easy money for next several quarters, maybe longer."
the problems here will be easy to fix and the valuation is fair. will be a good performer in a bad bear market. what is not to like?
"Surprised to see KHC go up today when everyone else was tanking. We are not out of the woods yet and perhaps this stock is a good bulwark during tough times like these. Even though they have stumbled in the past, they do own a large portfolio of staple brands. I was shopping the other day and was surprised how many KHC products ended up in my shopping cart. The interesting point is that the dividend seems safe and they are increasing their sales. If you are building a dividend based portfolio, this could be a nice bulwark in troubled times with a protected large dividend. Just a feeling. Glad I purchased shares."
Jeffery immelt is available to help with the needed turn around. Thank goodness!
too the weekend for people to digest the good earnings and realize the hoarding may start anew at any moment...
"The pessimism about the company's prospects has pushed the shares into undervalued territory, and now is a good time to invest in Kraft Heinz at a much lower price than Buffett did back in 2015. His investment of $16.7 billion to acquire 325.63 million shares translate to a per-share cost of $51. Kraft Heinz is a buy"
Selling Maxwell House? Looks like KHC is getting ready to buy back the shares - WB's style of investing...
With the mad dash to the grocery store my wife picked up Kraft American Cheese slices rather than store brand. My son asked why his grilled cheese tasted so much better. Go KHC.
KHC is not going to be under $30 or over $33.5 until next earning.
Probably will bounce off 20 and start going up if there's any silver lining at all...
will investors buy KHC before ER to get the dividend ???
34 to 55 soon!
Can’t wait for the day we close above 36.5 that will be beginning of the gap closing
Don’t panic. Revenue growing. It’s it always better then otherwise. Look ibm.
"Next week will see the 20s Unless management is completely changed and the 31 billion debt is addressed, this will head towards the low 20s."
"Kraft Heinz Q1 Adj. EPS $0.66 vs $0.90 In Same Qtr. Last Year, Sales $5.959B vs $6.3B Year Over Year; Q2 Adj. EPS $0.78 vs $0.99 YoY, Sales $6.406B vs $6.69B YoY"
"call orders ""analyst"" stated today directionally very bullish running 5x normal. read, today. earnings date consensus call february 20 indicating no announcements of import. again, that's for today. mindful over a month for er post."
I will be buying all the Mac n cheese off the grocery shelves this weekend in support of earnings.No one will recognize me as we have to wear masks now
hopefully a big warning sign will give retail investors a heads up on this nightmare.
Ignore the noise. We all know that it will recover and JUMP above $90.00 again within a few months. Keep BUYING!
"PEP wants to compete with KHC - in mac and cheese???!!! Be my guest. I have eaten 100 different types of mac and cheese - from restaurant quality 5* to mom and pops home town cafe's and everything off the shelf. There's only one! Kraft mac and cheese in the blue box; nothing and I mean nothing comes close. so cheetos or PEP or whatever - be my guest. I'm sure it will taste good, but it is like comparing pepsi to coke. Pepsi tastes good, but it doesn't even compare to coke. Nothing ever will; nuff said."
Looks like KHC is now missing from Warren Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/22/warren-buffetts-annual-letter-to-berkshire-hathaway-shareholders.html
Refinancing in progress pushing debt way out. Like I said a year ago when interest rates are this low junk status is irrelevant kHc debt is wanted by investors as a pretty safe bet value play
"You might wake up some day and see that KHC is being taken Private. Two institutions own 66%, so at this low price they really don’t need that much money. At least $45 to bring it private."
"Once Cramer gets this negative about a stock the stocks always are way higher 3-6 month later , Just like BBY, GIS even M oh he hated M at $17 and M went up to $35 LOL. Cramer is my gauge on when the best time to buy because you know Wall Street is paying him to bash. so Bash away Cramer and I will just keep buying more KHC LOL"
32.50 is the support —if it breaks below that it will go down a lot. If that holds it will go over 33
after all bs they still have 26 bil revenue

"If KHC goes to 20, I will pick up another 150 shares and be long with 1000 shares. These brands will survive. I wouldn't make too much of the analyst who says KHC could go down another 50%. Very often these predictions do not pan out."
If you buy today do still get the divy?
Now Barron's jumps on the negative article bandwagon. At least we are .21 off the low.
"where's @Jan Andersen who tried to lecture me yesterday? Where's@gfy gauzy who bought their first 700 shares yesterday,?Where's @duckula who quacked his mouth off so much?Where are all my great clueless amigos?"
Short squeeze is coming
Don’t be scared- Warren is NOT selling his shares and you shouldn’t either. It’s not like this company will go BK. I believe this is a good entry point and picked up shares at 34.55 we will see what happens......
"Who else can supply 300 million Americans with macaroni and cheese and ketchup and lunch meat, week in and week out ?"
BOYS....BUFFETT JUST KEEPS BUYIN !!!
BUYBUYBUY im happy buying
I would buy if only I could figure out why the operating cash flow numbers for the past several years are so low. I do not trust the operating income / EBIT numbers due to the absence of good cash flow.
Please dont get caught with Fake BYND. Way overvalued. KHC should top $34 next week and the dividends will keep coming...
Not one negative person on KHC has provided any formula as to why it’s under 40.00 per share.

"Isn’t KHC dividend pay day March 13th?, or did they cut their dividend??"
"The beginning of the end was the dividend cut. I got out at a loss at $31. There will be another dividend cut. There will be a buyout. However, it will be at a much lower price."
Anyone listen to the conf call? I was expecting a more positive one - top management needs more stock awards they said.....And costs for cheese hurting - wait - they don't make real cheese - only fake stuff. how can cheese costs hurt them?
this stock graph looks like a set of steps... every report it drops .... they are running out of steps .....
maybe double bottom in making ?
"We're seeing the 25s thought this could not happen again, clearly I was wrong. Very bullish from here"
Check out the balance sheet. 80% of assets are intangibles and goodwill. Debt at $30 + Bil. Cap in excess of par at $60 Bil. Wow!
"options and day traders know the x div drill today and not sure it's worth the few pennies they may glean. don't expect 31 to hold if you're embracing that thought. then again, maybe the passive mask wearing drones will awaken to 5+% div and stand in line to purchase at any price."
"There are so many brands under the KHC umbrellaA few that I will mention are some really simple but good brands.PHILADELPHIA, VELVEETA, CLASSICO, PLANTERS and ORE IDA.Now you can argue that millenials dont like processed or frozen foods but instead prefer fresh organic foods.Here is the reality. America is aging and most of the population is 50+ years old or older, many are in their 60's and a lot of them are going to be retiring. Let me tell you, they mostly are not organic fresh food people. These folks grew up with Mcdonalds and KFC and Dunkin Donuts. There are many years left to turn around the fortunes of the KHC company. I would say, maybe they need to sell a few brands and infuse the company with cash and then do a deal to buy another more suited brand for the young ens!Lastly, with a company making billions in sales with these brands albeit at a static rate, there is lots of potential with management shift, product marketing and perhaps deleting a product and adding another.I like the fact that they had a kitchen sink quarter, there is not much bad news left. Perhaps you wait a few days and weeks but its time to accumulate.Best to all of you investors!"
Losing about $1 per share per day for the last 3 days. This is getting out of hand! The report better be good tomorrow.
anyone else not happy with the new CEO---he doesn't seem to seem to be in a rush to change anything---no urgency at all (and I know he has been on a job for a week but he could have put out a decent interview at least)
warren can i have your email?
Everything eventually Ketchup with them!
The Kraft Heinz Co Forward PE Ratio : 11.51 (As of Today)
New shareholder why would anyone in there right mind sell KHC at the current level. 200% upside in 3-5 imho. How cares what anyone does? Buffett likes the company. New CEO imo is smart and will right the ship. Has 20 mill of his own money in the co and incentives. So CNBC will bash the stock all day now. They did the same if you remember when Apple was in the 140's. I don't think that the dividend will be cut. if anyone on this board can't buy when a stock is falling I suggest a no load index fund. me I am rich and love the price.
Fair value on this is 49 it has been raised.
1/3 of the company value vanished
Kraft Heinz Cut to Underperform From Peer Perform by Wolfe ResearchA little too late there Wolfie
Probably last chance to get the. Bemow $40 this week
"People on here talking about how Kraft makes unhealthy food? Gimme a break, we all know with good marketing people could be convinced to eat actual $h1t. We as a society aren’t smart, just gotta see if management can get it right."
I wish I could have bought more at 26.50. It is my only regret. My original 5000 shares were bought at 32. When all the dust from all these companies that have “bright” futures but produce no income from operations they will which they had KFC in their portfolios.
Good earnings! great job by management. Like to see growth from within. Who cares what Trump thinks. Companies jobs are to create profit for their shareholders. Trump lost almost all of his shareholders money on his casino stock. The President should stay out of what companies do to profit. Recent companies that he attacked have gone up Nordstrom as a example. KFC should continue doing what they have to do to increase shareholder value period. We should see the high 90's in 2017 imo.
The American stock is back in business folks . Sorry but Heinz is here to stay !
"for you khc bulls, when gme goes up 10x in a few weeks on zero news and is a declining business then anything is possible but this company is a disaster."
Another 8 billion in equity wiped out this week. It’s seems a little excessive considering it’s still kraft with a lot of household brands and they still made 6 billion last year minus non cash write downs
"Hey Legendary Trader, you ever been right about anything?"
"I am disappointed. I just got this for the long term, but now I'm second guessing. Psychology is a factor that scares people to sell off quickly, but its also there to help you realize common sense. Are these brands gonna be here in 10 years?"
Urmoney I'm with you! This is running up too fast. I'm trying to accumulate shares at a lower price. Please short it some more.
"BOYS...UNDER 30 THIS IS A BUY, BUT NOT BEFORE. BE PATIENT !!!!"
"Pre market freefall, sorry Natalia and all longs."
KHC food products are flying off the shelf as people stock up
awesome day..for those that bought low this is great news the financials are about to be straightened out and the uncertainty goes away
If you were to buy either GE or KHC which one you buy?
Can Buffett just put a lid on it and give it a chance to bounce. All moving up on trade and then he takes the knees right off it. We get it you messed up.
I’m definitely a buyer at these prices.
driving the stock down to buy more.
"every ""genius"" short term trader is sure this will go down...that's a great sign long term longs are on right side"
"Have you seen what Elliot, the hedge fund manager has done with ATT stock. Up 10 days in a row. It seems to me an activist fund manager is accumulating KHC and will issue a statement when they are done buying. One can only hope. IMHO"
"Every post on here is negative.... that means one thing.... you are all wrong, this is a contrarians dream!"
Yes this is an A rating divd stock and it is primed for growth. Me likey
"$40 in July, $50 EOY."
all will be well here...Warren Buffett on Squack Box on Monday and will pump it back up a bit..
thanks for the dividend cut! nice work lol!
"This is the kind of thing, which suggests to me there's a buyback about to be initiated. The stock is cheap enough for the company to take it from the fools who will sell it this cheap. After which, the stock will shoot up. Always ask yourself 'why' something just happened, or appeared to have happened, and always have your eyes on the NEXT Quarterly Earnings. Next QE this is over $50..."
Let's all meet when KHC hits $45 to party in 2021. Shorts are invited too since they will pay for it. Will meet in Omaha so Warren can attend too.
"How much lower can they go, valuation is equal to Kraft prior merger. Going to buy at 32"
For the record I will be buying kraft all next year with every dividend I get from other stocks plus of course Krafts dividends and if it stays down longer. I like money.
15% of my entire portfolio is basically evaporating....
Should test 31.30 by the end of the week. It will be 30 by the end of the month. By April it might go to 34.90
For all of the doubters and dummies that laughed at me getting filled for 1811 shares @ $33.12 before market close. Who's laughing now?
baked beans will rule the world!
26 days left before earnings report was promised..so there is an end to this madness..probably wanted the sale of the Canadian unit includes in the numbers
Only k and gis are direct competitors. Cag khc cpb all make food product but their products don't overlap. For example gis makes dairy (yogurt and hagen daaz ice cream) but no cheese. Khc makes cheese but no yogurt. Cpb is mostly soups and v8 juices. Heinz is mostly condiments. Cag also makes pam cooking oil
Tuff Day Again Today.....
Shorts so unpredictable!! Knock KHC stock price around so you sell take profit then price goes up a lot. Go figure!!!
I guess Iran told Kerry-Heinz Company to hold the mayo.
How much dividends cut?
"Would they do such a thing? Is this possible? ""3G sold off $1.2 billion of Kraft Heinz stock six months before the writedown news tanked the stock last month.""Yup. They sure would. Funny thing is that the bag holders still don't know that they are bag holders."
"AMD, NBIX, WDC, BP, TGT were some of the names at Junk in the past. This shall pass. Keep buying."
"Kraft foods are healthy enough. Cheapest way to feed the family. I own GIS, CPB, KHC, and K."
"Maybe Kraft Heinz should look into buying Tofutti Brands, Inc.?"
"Judge a stock by who else holds it already. Massive upswing from here. Too many big stakeholders, including Buffet."
"45 by year end? My wife bought private brand ketchup, i took it back and got Heinz"
Up but the volume is well below the average ----unless we get some good news like earnings for Q1 I am afraid we will give the gains over last couple weeks.
My kids won't eat peas unless they're in a 9 dollar fakeburger.
Shouldn't the subpoena have been disclosed much sooner if it was issued in OCT? I'm quite surprised they could get away with that being a publicly traded company.
Amazing how Yahoo Finance doesn't list any positive news about KHC. Just old negative news on the homepage
Warren and Charlie will buy and take KHC private and make billions while you little folks will get robbed. That is what you get for dumping your shares cheap.
Tomorrow KHC will jump up open because finally I bought today.
Buying on every dip to $32
KHC And LSCC.Buy now.
High volume going into close
You can surely feel this thing will be pushed much higher !! And with 3G and Warren Buffett anything could happen. I believe shorting KHC at these levels is crazy.
Earnings will do well based on stay in place for the past quarter
This thing is going to fly
"The 30oz bottle of No Sugar Added Heinz ketchup can't be stocked fast enough at any of my local stores. This is the millennial friendly language that they need to start tweaking into their other products. It's not really that hard, their brand name and goodwill is not going anywhere. This is a $75 stock with just a few changes and re-packaging."
"According to latest 10-Q SEC filing from Aug 5th Berkshire doesn't count the price drop at KHC as a loss as they state that it is ""temporary"" and don't want to sell until at least their buying price ($43.04)"
"Kraft-Heinz is a dark-spot in Buffett's legacy. Not only is it losing money, it resulted in a lot of job losses. Even when you have as much money as Berkshire, there's no need to gut legacy companies to make an attractive ROI -- you can find companies that are on the upswing and buy/invest in those."
Knew it was coming when they started messing with the Ketchup bottles.
"Volume is back to normal... no more panic selling, KHC is stable now. Don’t be surprised if they take this company private at these low levels. That will really destroy the shorts !! Good luck to all longs."
Grab yer ankles girls! Warren Buffet just said something is amiss at KHC because the auditors won't sign off on their financials!Disclosure: I am one of the unfortunate KHC bag holders.
back to 70 we go haha
solid dividend..turnaround in progress..covid vacine not available for many months..this price.movement is temporary..makes no.sense
signs of bottom as funds seem to have finishing accumulation.
Trump needs to persuade China to buy thousands of cases of KHC on a monthly basis and company will be fine. Mustard and pickles are big sellers in China.
"hope everyone enjoyed listening to warren buffet. i dont watch cnbc, missed it. im sure he said his usual banter of hold forever jibberish. thats good for serious stocks that are managed by professionals, have outstanding balance sheets and sales/revenue growth but khc isnt on that list. really glad big money is ditching the best companies in the world. i see lots of opportunities in real companies this week. a little upset ppl are dying for the opportunity though."
Nobody uses ketchup anymore. Or mayonnaise.
Slowly heading back up. I think the drop was just market manipulation!
what is with all the polictical discussion on a stock board...leave it alone all ready..jimminy christmas
giddy up!!
Power growth stock! Don't get left behind!!
seems like this company is about to pull a jeffrey epstein
Back to 70 end of year !
"Slowly but surely building momentum, this will recover but SLOWLY ... I am long ..."
"what causes socialism/Marxism to thrive, it's the breakdown of the greedy demoralization of the free enterprise system, a system that promotes riches an d wealth but leaves the players demoralized and broke. think about it....."
"Morgan Stanley... upgraded KHC to equal weight, things are shaping up. Time to start accumulating now !!"
im buying MORE
Up on strong volume. $55 Soon!
so when does the divvy get paid out?
Wait till it hits 20 and then buy
Value stocks will be back in fashion. The high flying growth stocks at such high valuations comparing year to year financials will steer investors to value. Imagine KHC $100 share. What us out of style eventually back in style! Go KHC!
Feb 13th 2017 this was at 96.65. Today's close is 1/3 of that almost to the penny. How does the CEO still have this job?
"Wow! ""Sell Kraft Heinz Stock Because the Turnaround Task Is Enormous, Analyst Says""Yawn.I used to think that if you make both Cheese Dogs and Ketchup, you just can't possibly lose.Not any more."
"very good day folks, nice profit. can't wait for next week."
needs to break 34.95 to break out - hopefully today :)
This stock was 27 bucks on Friday. Food stock soaring.
"Folks something is brewing... I saw 1 block of 100,000 shares and 3 blocks of 50,000 shares. Definitely the big boys are buying At these low levels. There is value guys !!"
"Rekindled taste for khc products. If we don’t eat so much for so long that we are sick of it, we can normalize to higher sales levels pre-covid"
Falling revenue due to competition. Aging product lines. A shift in the public's eating habits. High debt. Most of their assets are non-tangible. This stock will take a beating over the next few years. I am not short. I am watching.
Where is the bottom on Kraft? UNDERVALUED? guess most of the supposed smart investors must be looking through a different type glasses.
CAG on a tear. Up 6% in 2 days on fake meat news. I own both CAG and KHC. world gotta eat.
"Look for the press release on earnings as soon as today or some other news, Someone purchased almost 5000 call option late yesterday out of the blue. Over 1000 $31.50 for today and almost 4000 for $31.50 and $32's for July 19"
Kraft Heinz is a great turn-around story. They are beating on revenue and earnings and slowly but surely rebooting the business to former highs - and while we wait we get to collect the fat dividends. Sweet!
This stock is easily worth 65 dollars a share. Company is making all the right moves to improve balance sheet
I've gotten so use to this stock falling everyday I've stopped caring. The management team clearly needs to be replaced and 3G removed.
This looks like it will be a nice addition to my retirement account
The bank of Buffet will buy the winning management team.No worries at KHC.
I've never seen so many people on business channel say don't touch this with a ten foot pole. way way better stocks to buy
later when the stock is 40$..all these trolling shorts will have lost money and will be gone with the wind
Robert Kraft has nothing to do with Kraft foods ... Please do your homework
"The COVID-19 situation will change the food industry even after things are back to normal. This is a life saver for KHC. People were going towards non processed food and shunning canned and foods with long storage life. Now it will be a 180 degree change. Not only will be more demand, but demand will be Through the roof as people start hoarding Long shelf life foods."
KHC has the same problem Campbell Soup has. Their products have lessening demand. This trend is not going to change anytime soon.
When everyone will be destroyed today... Kraft as a defensive stock will be ok!
Dropping like a rock
"So on Thursday its a $48.xx +/- stock, Friday its a $35.xx stock. Normal trade volume of +/- 6 million shares, then on Friday trades 135 million shares with a trading range of $1.49......that is real strange to me. Of course somebody had to sell, and somebody bought......doesn't seem like it was day trades. Just a thought.Disclosure: I am long KHC"
"I hated this stock but based on grocery trends since March this is a buy all the way up to 33. Ceo is really developing transparency throughout entire organization to monitor, control and monetize the brands"
"I usually don't like trying to catch falling knives, but this sell off is ridiculous. I like Heinz Ketchup, their Mac-n-Cheese is the best, amongst many other household names, even ones that are good to the last drop, ah, and Warren Buffet is a HUGE shareholder of this stock who may just take it private, I'm in with a half position, and will dollar cost average into the stock, at these give away prices. A company with a book value over $53 per share, we could see a nice snap back to $40 or better imo, I'm in."
Bought 3500 calls target 38 December at German stock exchangeSmall play for a renounce coming weeks
Wall Street massages the SP up just a tad to give you hope. Kinda like a feel good moment before the weekend. You’ll watch sad movies over the weekend and fund managers will have cocaine parties thanks to you.
Like the stock...but idk about the stock price. Still seems high at 58
I am so mad . Fire the ceo ASAP .
It's about time. Whew
that's what I'm talking about!
Buffet overpaid—but I didn’t!!!
Get reary to lose all your money in the stock market. Massive drop is now coming
U think people eat organic beans everyday?? Why hasn't Whole Foods put Walmart out of business... what planet are u guys living on?
Custoemrs at Costco are picking up KHC with increase purchase.
"Recently got interested in khc,because it’s down 50% from 2018. However, looking into its earnings, it’s still not cheap. $8.5-$6 from one tie tax cut benefits, that’s about $2.5. for stock priced at about $48, it is still not a good buy for me.Any thoughts?"
"Averaging down, it's painful for now but when you know that 26% of the shares won't budge and that the best investor ever has his lieutenant at the board and no choice but to turn the shares up it makes me fine."
Warren bought more KHC. Now he owns 30%.
A rate cut is fantastic news for Kraft Heinz. They will pay down their debt much faster.
just doubled my position.
John Kerry running this company with his liberalism.
"This feels so much like KO in 2015. I bought big into KO when it dipped under 40 a few years ago. Got out when it went to 50, took 13 dividends in between, went back in and have been enjoying the dividends since then. I expect this to give me more profits than that example. Similar brand name business though, that can't go wrong."
"These brands are two of the company's most important brands, worrying the Street that if Kraft can't manage these brands, it may not be able to compete in today's competitive grocery landscape. The end for KHC House brands are better and half the price of KHC,"
I am a buyer at $50 - good entry point
"As people stop eating, KHC won't have any customers. Higher interest rates will be definitely hurting the company. Imagine how much their new borrowing cost will be. Target price 50 cents"
while you guys are enjoying the weekend buffet iis gloating how he bought another million shares for less than 27.00 bucks a share bringing down his average.
"They need to lower the price on the Ketchup. The competition is way cheaper and taste better......It's tomato and sugar, lol...."
What to choose? $KHC $TAP $MO or $BUD ?
"Overvalued? Really Yahoo! Share price has been solid low 30’s for a long stretch, the dividend is fantastic considering this low rate environment. I’ll take it."
"Let’s buy Dominos! Tomato sauce, cheese, and meat toppings. Market is going to be there forever. I should be running this company!!!"
With a close to 5% dividend I am very happy owning KHC if all the drama is done. I am praying all the drama is done.
"Attention BARRON!Sir,Three hours ago you posted that KHC ""had no debt""! LMAO! They have 29.24 BILLION dollars of DEBT. Not pesos, but DOLLARS. It looks like this: -$29,240,000,000.00.As of last Friday, the market cap was 32.82 billion. That leaves $3,580,000,000 of equity. Shares outstanding = 1.22 billion.That means that as of today your shares are really worth about $2.93. Like you, I am under water. Maybe someone dumber that Warren will think they are getting a good deal and buy them. But I think this ship is sinking..."
"Yes this company has debt, yes they can pay it off but it will take time. As balance sheet improves its equity prices will also improve. Very efficient company. This is a long term play"
We will be at $35 by earnings announcement.
"Has anyone else noted that this is the sign of the beast? Kraft is doomed. "" The food giant took a $666 million hit in the quarter"""
Kraft and Campbell Soup at discounted prices right now. Buy for long-term holds.
Markets rage higher today.... This thing stuck in the mud.
i used to work at walmart as a cashier and let me tell you people realy dont buy the name brand food any more like they used to they buy the walmart brand because it about the same but about half the price so i hope kraft can find a way to change that
Buffet said hes not buying or selling. but that does mean hes not writing Calls and Puts. at first he will write puts drop the price to $25 . Then he will write calls. win win win.
The bottom will fall out tomorrow.
"This is huge............WB will do ""something"" about it...........it's almost guaranteed. Problem is ......... we don't know WHAT he might do......"
ONE CAN MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT CONSIDERING HUGE SALE KHC REMAINS STATUS QUO
"Patricio is betting on his own success: He is personally doling out $20 million to buy Kraft Heinz shares that he’ll need to hold onto for four years, Kraft Heinz said earlier this month. If Patricio can lead Kraft Heinz to growth, he’ll recoup that $20 million and then some. If Kraft Heinz’s stock price rises to $45 to $55 during his first three years there, he stands to receive from 200,000 to 600,000 shares."
Just bought in - 5k shares.
Coverage now of CNBC
Tomorrow’s pre-market Price when Buffet speaks will jump to $38 - $38.50 and after the open it will bounce to $39 - $41 because of the dividend and Buffett’s comments. By next week it should be around $44 - $46.I have seen very positive comments here and people saying the selling was overdone. Several analysts have made assumptions. I plan to buy at the open. Good luck to all longs.
Is there anyone who has not sold this stock since 2017?
This stock is a gold mine . Long term will be rewarded!
"When 95% of all companies will see their financial result decrease by 50%, Kraft will have 25 to 30% more in sales in the next quarter!!!!! I am still wondering why Kraft is a 50% of book value... Nonsense!"
I rate KHC a hold.I would rate it a sell but management has said they are looking at acquisitions.And you dont want to miss a pop like when they announced the Unilever deal.KHC will re-test the 52 week low at least and I have a buy order in the $52 zone.This is a long term hold or core holding.It is a well managed company and both Buffet and the Brazilians have no intention of flipping this company.
"BREAKING NEWS ! MOMENTS AGO 12:26 PM EST $27 Price Target !This Analyst Thinks It Could Get Worse For Kraft Heinz12:26 pm ET March 29, 2019 (Benzinga) PrintInvestors assuming Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC)'s business can't get any worse are likely wrong, according to Wolfe Research.The AnalystWolfe Research's Scott Mushkin downgraded Kraft Heinz from Peer Perform to Underperform with a fair value price target lowered from $33 to $27.The ThesisKraft's management indicated during its fourth-quarter conference call it will be increasing prices by the end of March, Mushkin said in a note. The research firm's first-hand checks found only three brands cost more (Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Velveeta) on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, other brands including Heinz Ketchup actually saw a price decrease.Overall, a basket of 17 different Kraft items cost 2.6 percent less today than it did last year at retail giant Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).It's possible Kraft oversaw a price increase at some of Walmart's competitors, but Mushkin said it's ""difficult to retain if they are not accepted by Walmart.""Kraft Heinz boasts among the best EBITDA margin rates in the industry, but multiple factors aside from the absence of price increases could see its financial profile worsen in the near term, Mushkin said."
"Kraft needs to start immediately making their foods higher quality. Sorry, but millennials do not want Velvetta and quite frankly no one should be eating that totally disgusting excuse for a food."
"The father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, explained this concept by saying that in the short run, the market is like a voting machine--tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular. But in the long run, the market is like a weighing machine--assessing the substance of a company."
I always thought the Kraft Heinz distribution capability could be a great way for small producers to get their products to market. Sort of an Amazon to small farms in addition to the KHC lineup of its own products.
Slow and steady growth with dividends. Easy stock pick here...
Bought some at 29.19 plan to add if drops.
Doesn't this company wind up making soylent green? So just buy it. They will be here until the end....lol
"I buy this as a dividend play. In 30 years I will be making 50% of what I invest now, yearly!"
Wow what’s going on??? I’m not sure how to react since I’ve had two months of disappointment every day
KHC will be a blow out quarter. The money is on KHC Buy Buy Buy!!!
hitting 40
"I am not convinced they will cut the dividend, thoughts?"
Not a good day for anything Kraft
Amazing single quarter turn around. Analysts pushing this down so they can buy. Dont be fooled. Dividend is safe!
The biggest shareholder Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway see its holding devalued by $4 b in a single day on this.
I loved the Kraft super bowl commercial!!!
A high school junior could run this company better than the ceo.
"Can someone answer why this stock keeps going down? Seems like a good, stable American consumer brand with $10B/year earnings, 7 P/E, >3% Divy. Only issue I see is the debt, but I think a lot of big consumer companies carry high debt.. What am I missing?"
Breakout
go watch Market Mornings on youtube. interesting take on KHC
"yep, house of pain approaching. checked our gis and wmt quite early and well knew no free lunch today. fwiw: paid forums housing very sharp forex guys, citing the fasb no 52 and how it's causing some havoc and sales. aside,picked up friends early a.m. at SEA and was not busy as usual."
something up for sure...the CEO is dead serious on making a major acquisition. nothing os too big for this company or its management. this should be interesting
$31.03 is very painful.
"dropped over 30% after the dividend cut, over reaction= under valued"
Looking past recent volatility...the dps for 1st quarter seems really easy to beat
We should close today at around $33.50.
Why has the price been declining the past two years?
shorts squeeze would be nice ...
now up almost 10 off Low plus divy
when the takeoff ?
That's what you get if you follow Buffett's advice.Did he really think that people will pay 10 bucks for cheesedogs?
"We're already down...big...and then Cramer and others begin saying Kraft products are out of favor with the millennials...yadayadayada...I see PLENTY of people in line buying Kraft products - Not everyone is a .....millennial, Jimmy boy. If people were so obsessed with their health, there would be no fast food stores, pizza parlors, ice cream shops, ets."
"I'm a buyer at these discounted prices. In the event of an economic slowdown, Organic foods will become overpriced. People always choose the cheaper alternative every time. Watch this soar in the next 6-12 months..."
Buying KHC now would be like buying 30 year US Treasury Bonds in November 1981.I would think that Warren Buffet might be interested in increasing his holdings of KHC from 26 percent ownership to 100 percent. An excellent fit for Birkshire.
Ex-dividend tomorrow!! 40 cents/share to those who hold tonight!
"BUFFET IS HOLDING HIS POSITION. YOU SHOULD BE BUYING IN, OR HOLDING...https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffet-absolutely-no-intention-of-selling-stake-in-kraft-heinz-14876142"

Brand names going the way of Sears.. Retail apocalypse caused by Joe Blow's welfare check with food stamp benefits. Its cheaper for Joe to buy a Big Mac & Fries.
"why is there so much blood in the streets?!... nevermind, it's catsup."
Good Thing Dow UP Over 400 !Eh BAGZ ?(Snicker)
Strong Walmart numbers might indicate strong sales for Kraft Heinz. ~20% of KHC sales are from Walmart.
Why KHC went from +3% to -3.5% in last hour? Did I miss something?
"Time to start picking up shares on pull backs, either buy shares or deep in the money calls after Aug 2019 , but do not over pay for the calls. KHC should go ex dividend in Aug so you want call options so you can that the shares so you get the dividend. Time to start building a stake in KHC"
Khc is every pantry in North America and maybe the world. Retailers want better margins and look to suppliers for rebates and lower prices. All there brands make billions dollar brands and goodwill write down is just an accounting term to lower the balance sheet for tax purposes. Heck they made .84/share 4q. Khc intrinsic value 49.00 easy
Wow... put my buy order in for 22.00
I am very happy with the new blood in the company!!!!!! I love the new hire of Abrams-Rivera! Great history so far! Great future!
"Barron's, seriously ?"
Price getting good again to press bet up
This is a cruel market. Anything wrong with the stock it will get crushed.
"Time for Buffet to take khc private at $30, complete the reorganisation and bring it back to the market at $50 within a few years."
0.40 dividend per share
"Geez, can this stock drop to 5 already so I can buy some shares!"
nothing breaking khc chart now. big swoosh down then flat then another swoosh down. and the trend continues.
Upgrades and downgrades are simply short term views. There will be times when the same analysts who downgraded are going to upgrade KHC. It's just a matter of time. Money is made in the waiting for that time to come. So long!
Imagine....tomorrow you will be able to purchase shares for 10% cheaper than any of the shares Buffet bought. How many times does that ever happen?
This is when you buy!!
$25 is where it will go guys. that's where buyers will come in.
Have been waiting for over 2 years for this once in a lifetime opportunity to buy!
This stock will soar on just a little bit of good news. IMO
"You HAVE to realize when a business is in DECLINE......like Sears, etc. times area changing and that does not bode well for KHC."
"Order filled, but I think I'll take another 200."
"Stock still reeks of rotten cheese, still not cheap enough for me to buy yet! I want $20/share!"
"Management knows and they 'hoped' for this big drop, with such a huge drop (higher VOLUME) they could buy more shares. with all panic about dividend cut by 36%... they cut, but at the same time with that drop they paying the same yield for those, who bought after the drop =)) anyway, goodluck guys."
why is it down almost 5% today?
Plz no run out of mac and cheese :( 35 to 50 cmon Kraft rebound u can do this will take some time though maybe Buffet will say some nice things next week
"let's see, cut dividend, sec probe and miss earnings, well i don't think they could screw up more than that, excellent mgmt team!"
melted down like velveeta on the sidewalk in the summer .
"If you see the total volume these last few days, the fact that it hasn’t gone below $34, the fact that Buffet and other fund own approx 66% of the company outstanding shares. My research tell me we already hit bottom today. Mark this post."
This was once a $97 stock. I guess it will never get back to that price.
Why the after hours pop?
Buffet dumping?
This is a good company in my two cents.Should have bought it earlier .
Those who bought cheap and hold will benefit from Warren's giant overpayment.
No one that bought this is expecting it to jump. We are shrewd and patient. Enjoying the dividends while we wait.
"This looks to be way oversold based upon an intangible w/o. Without the w/o for the intangible they were .84 per share, thats a $3.4 per share just above a 10 PE with a dividend yield of over 4% on a company with high quality brands."
why did they sell planters to hormel.
Oprah Winfrey name isn't going to help this company anytime soon.
"UrMoney, I hope you've enjoyed yourself. For me you are now muted!"
"For those that think the current price is an entry point, look at GE. No one buys Kraft products anymore, processed cancer causing fake food. The decline in this stock has just begun."
Dividends stayed constant
"Borden Dairy Co. filed for bankruptcy, becoming the second major U.S. milk seller to do so in two months as competitive pressures, declining consumption and falling profits made its debt load unsustainable."
I think some selling and rebuying on the dip is in many futures today... 10%!
I predict this will be right around 33 tomorrow.
looks like management sold lots of stock ahead of the news.
"LOL hurry buy we now have fake tweets because the stock is going to crash under $20 and Wall Street wants out before that happens they already have the earnings from KHC , Because Wall Street always does have the earnings weeks before the rest of us. Get ready for SUPER SLAUGHTER time fake buy outs are always the tell that you are going to get slaughtered"
Easy buy .
"instead of cash dividends, can i get the ba coins?"
patience
What companies are considered to be Kraft Heinz's to 3 competitors? I'm working on school project.
The board clearly said the dividend is safe. Thanks for the cheap shares.“dividend of $0.40 per share”“ Today’s dividend declaration is the Board’s confirmation of their confidence in the turnaround plan being led by CEO Miguel Patricio and the team he has now put in place.”
Kraft is down - and will stay down for a couple quarters & until management can show clear positive direction . Cost cutting & big acquisitions is not a recipe for brand growth and this write down proved it .
KHC is a deal here! Some more heavy buying from institutional buyers for sure on this heavy branded company.
i think we get paid tomorrow
I want everyone to remember that somewhere out there is a Mrs. UrMoney and that woman is a saint!
"downgrade for kraft and pushing POst has to be a joke . Its the opposite as soon as people go back to work Post will be like it was , even milk sales are falling , Post getting get up by fast food breakfast sales. more nutrition in eggs than cereals that have to have some vitamins added ."
slow and steady wins this race!small upstarts don't have the distribution and financials as khc...
I thought frozen veggies sold well.Why sell Ore-ida?
Seems to usually make a bounce attempt late afternoon.
Is the bottom in yet? With all the insider buying you would think so.
"Dividend will be 40c on March 8th, for the guy who asked."
Once it broke into the gap I’m sure it triggered all sorts of buy signals on technical basis..most of the time they will fill the gap after breached.. should get 47$ at some point..self fulfilling with all the technical buy programs
can we get one good earnings report please..and jump into the gap
Just bought my self a pair of new flippers hitting up the keys . Ready to load up on Monday .
Definitely an over reaction. Buying at $75
Time to stop playing Buffet game. Momentum upwards is very little now what you have to fear is a bad quarter in 3 months . Your hero Buffet will do his job to save his massive investment and cut the div. again which will trigger a big fall in the share price. Upside from here on is going to be small or not there at all. First move I am guess will be for kraft to lower their prices to at least maintain market share or stabilize it.

"nice buy now , blood is certainly in the streets. Just a small move over 27.00 would be a good start."

"Sell Option Missing from Robinhood for KHCHoping someone may have an explanation for me, because it's very weird. I sent a support note to Robinhood more than 2 days ago, but haven't heard back yet.I have a large portfolio, and this is the only stock that is not providing me an option to Sell. Just Buy or Options trading. A dividend is being paid on June 26, but that should impede the ability to sell the stock. Just trying to figure out if this is a technical bug on Robinhood's side, or someone specific about KHC that restricts selling for someone odd reason.Any thoughts are appreciated.Thank you,Bob"

"If KHC had a decent Board of Directors (which it does not), it would fire the entire top management team and replace it with executives from P&G and Nike - even if they had to pay huge salaries. KHC has been one of the worst managed companies in recent memory, squandering the benefits of some of the most valuable brands. No innovation, no productivity, and zero marketing acumen. It's almost criminal."
You will never see khc at these prices. Heinz on its own is worth 35.00/share. If you don’t sell naturally there is more buyers. Summer is just around corner. More hot dogs and cheese dip
"One thing I learned during the great recession, is when people aren't working, high priced foods such as imitation meats and avocado toast aren't enticing anymore. They always flock to generic brands every time. Gold and food staples are always the winners in market downturns. GLTA! Cheers!"
needs a natural brand spinoff with a little higher prices. more of a dividend cut to pay down long term debt
I'll say it one Time ( Potato Chips ) Make them they will come.
people buying these foods cant keep it on the shelves
This will be 5x volume vs. 10 day ave. in 15 minutes of trading. Out of sight volume. All on sell side.
"until the cut the dividend and address debt this thing will slowly die. I said it a year ago. cut it. take the stock hit to 13, pay down debt aggressively. Then it can grow again and be back to 45 or 50 in 5 years with a healthy dividend. If they don't do this, I think it will get to 13 then single digits.. IMO"
To much competition anymore for these companies to compete. That's the only argument I need to hear and believe.
"This is destroying quite a few of my gains from the rest of the portfolio. It's going to be a long, long, long haul on this one"
BUFFET SAYS HE IS NOT SELLING!
will trend lower over the next few weeks. not a buy at this point.
"Gramham taught about buying great business with moat under book value is always rewarding. My personal experience has been positive and proven when i bought JPM, BAC and C way under book value. Now, KHC and TAP are great dominating companies with marketing shares leader in its market. They are showing signs of consolidating and break out, Once they breaking out like TAP, the chart shows no resistance and can rocket very quickly to pass the book value."
Don’t listen to analysts they are trying to strip shares from the little guy.
This isn’t the bottom
"""Still, Buffett told CNBC that he viewed Kraft as a “wonderful business,” and argued that it is hard for rivals to compete with the food giant. """
"Inflation hedge at reasonable valuation....more likely to be 20% up than 20% down in 6 months. After years of tech overweight, i am rotating into good value, dividend paying stocks, cash generating stocks that can price to capture inflation risk."
CTV News: A single factory is now working 24/7 to keep Kraft Dinner on grocery shelves.https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/a-single-factory-is-now-working-24-7-to-keep-kraft-dinner-on-grocery-shelves-1.4862199
This is tempting to make a purchase. I expect a dead cat bounce and then drifting lower. If it drops tomorrow I will get a little and wait for the dead cat bounce to unload. I would not be long here. It seems to be a falling knife and Buffet is not buying any more so what does that tell you ?
They still have not cut that ridiculous dividend (nearly 6%) even though they have 30 billion in debt. For comparison MCD also has 30 billion debt but only pays 2.5% and has way more FCF. If they dont cut the Div Thursday run for the hills as the new CEO would be just as spineless as the last and unwilling to do whats needed to right the ship. Cutting the DIV to 0.05/Q saves 1.5B a year thats desperately needed.
Buying more . Fear don’t scare me
"In the last month KHC has been walked from $63 to $56 and it is still walking downstairs. I don't think this is temporary, it could take months or years to recover, if at all. Look what happen to T it is selling below it's IPO price of 8 years ago."
At least R. Kraft had a happy ending... less so KHC stockholders.
"Just a reminder I warned about this TRASH at $33, $31, and will do so again at $27 now. This DUMPSTER FIRE has shrinking revenues, shrinking earnings, and COLOSSAL DEBT! It only has $6B in tangible assets, the rest is MAKE-BELIEVE GOODWILL! Contrast that with OVER 30 BILLION IN DEBT and you have to ask yourself: why lose money on this GARBAGE? A terribly run company selling terrible products to a shrinking demographic... Headed for $0, quickly! You'd be better off tossing your money into a volcano!"
