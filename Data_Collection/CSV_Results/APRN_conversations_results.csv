Recent headlines and conversations for aprn
Blue Horseshoe Loves Blue Apron. Call it into Jim Cramer's Mad Money at 1-800-743-CNBC and mention APRN's and its competitors (HFG and MMM). Let them know you think APRN should be on Jim's COVID19 Index.
Blue Apron buy out is coming.
"This is the future of grocery shopping. Not having to go somewhere to get food is a huge plus for a lot of people. Whether Blue Apron can come up with something no one else is doing (again) and capture more subscribers is what we will have to see. Fast food restaurants offering meal kits won’t last long. The whole purpose of fast food is to get it and go. Not get it, take it home, put it in the fridge, and cook it within a few days. People that aren’t interested in meal kits will get frustrated that their wait time in line is much higher because of these people. Blue Apron has been a great company in the past and will find a way to get back on top."
please do something this stock has potential but need some good management
Any idea why it rose today?
The ones who are hating on this stock are fasting for 2 months. We need food here and we can’t bother going out to supermarkets all the time as people are fighting to stack up their carts or some may carry the virus. If the Government get us money that’s even better.
Any chance of a buyout at the 52 week low?
"Just compare the sequential revenue increase (Q1-->Q2) of the 3 listed meal kit companies: Hellofresh US: 79%Marley Spoon US: 88%Blue Apron: 28%They are loosing so much market share. They arent even no. 2 in the US, Home Chef has surpassed them, just have a look at google trends or similarweb"
Blue Apron never fails to disappoint only added 20 k new customers ....please sell company

Blue Apron & Heat Biologics ready for a breakout

"75% of companies are in severe debt, many way worse than APRN, and yet trade at many multiples of revenue. I don't know if you guys have heard, but we're in a business debt crisis. APRN is already trading at a bankrupt valuation, unjustifiably. Only $20 million in APRN shares trade."
"will never ever ever turn up a profit, no cosmetic mgmt shuffle will change it or failure business model"
"Ignore the shorts, strong longs, with almost four times all the tradable shares traded today the shorts are in big big trouble. You can check for dilution yourself on the SEC's website, there isn't any. Lock in your shares, place reasonable profitable sell orders expiring far from now and never change those sell orders again. https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=aprn&owner=exclude&action=getcompany&Find=Search"
Time to buy APRN
"Puts are up 3 fold,suggesting people are buying protection from drop"
This company has class action lawsuit written all over itselfGo public one month ago and then announce 24% job cut
"This is the CEO's one year anniversary call. When she joined APRN was trading at $14-15/share, and she has done everything right since plus got this recent boost from COVID-19. I hope she is rewarded for all of her great work here, and being a hero during this pandemic."
"Nice, almost all the tradable APRN shares have traded, and it's not even 30 minutes into the open. And, this is not a setup for dilution based on the sec filings, excellent! Remember, strong longs, if you don't want to lose your money place reasonable profitable sell orders expiring far from now and never change those sell orders again."
Blue apron ceo bought a lot of put options since the company got the ipo( he wants us to be bearish ... when a new company enter the ipo it should not have options so APRN is like facebook ( exception ).furthermore the old ceo made a fortune but the good news is that the new cel will bring back aprn to the ipo price ... good luck everyone blue apron is a new facebook :)
"tell me of a successful company with woman as ceo?-lucent, pat russo, company dismembered and sold in pieces for nothinbg-IBM, marie rometti, 20 quarters of shrinkage, she was dumped and ibm has now recovered some-HP Carly Fiorina, company runed to the ground, she was dumped-ebay, Meg Whitman, company lost mklt share not able to compete in asia and elsewhere, she was dumped-yahoo, Marissa Ann Mayer, yahoo revenue shrinkage company sold as scarp pieces to verizon-now the bluethingy ahahahahahmy PUTs are gold!! back to $2 or lower in the next 3 months.."

"$Blue Apron Hldg what is happening with the puts?! the stock is down 28% and the puts are down!? this doesn't make sense! the calls are down, why are the puts not up!?"
Here we go. No stopping it.
"What's so funny is that Blue mountain got caught Paying for a positive article on PCG against PGE filing, BK just so they could exit before and could get out before the stock tanked. Here it's obviously being attacked by some huge short fund that desperately needs to cover; LAUGHABLE"
Avoid to much trading like I did with AR - I earned like 20% instead of 400% as I predicted. I tought I'm better than those trading machines and I'm not. It's gonna be much higher within several weeks. I know it. Good luck and enjoy the trend
"The virus won't stop. Once I did my homework on this virus, I already predicted a Great Depression back in January and moved my 401K to stable and shorted the market. U.S. total lockdown coming in days. Restaurants closing soon. Hundreds of thousands of restaurant workers will be laid off. Tens of thousands already started in states where opening restaurants are prohibited.This won't end anytime soon because the virus, as the 1918 and 2009 Pandemics proved is they went through the hot month of July, not to mention countries with hot weather all having massive infection counts going up. In a month the entire planet will be on lockdown. There will be some respite in August/Sept, but then the virus, after incubating in our kids during Sept, will hit a second wave in Oct. Pandemics generally last 1-3 years, which is why Trump finally admitted 18 months. The Trump team actually has some talented doctors, but Trump's been downplaying the virus and allowing it to spread exponentially for more than a month, ensuring this upcoming Great Depression, while patting his own back saying he's done a great job.This virus doesn't sleep and doesn't care if you don't believe. It will do what viruses have done for billions of years. $APRN to $100 before the summer is over."

If this breaches 4.00 into the 3.50s I’ll add a few more. Can’t really see this
Aprn double the website traffic last month
"I don’t think it will be a bloodbath for this stock as meal kits, vaccine, grocery stores are news trending. In the back of that, they will announce earnings in May. A company who’s selling pricey meals like hot cakes? Think about it. This stock should trend at $30 during this pandemic."
After earning Expect $8+ Fundamentals are all supporting the fact of upside
"half of my office is signing up already,,,, it's a craze already I think it's going to be fantastic"
"Anyone who is saying ""supermarkets are open, this is a bad stock, don't buy"" why would you order online? For the simple fact that with almost 800 deaths in Italy in one day, people aren't taking any chances of going out what so ever. Some will because they think they young and invincible but families aren't taking chances. So please instead of hating we should all support these companies who are trying their best to help us. Don't buy if you don't like it but some of us do."

APRN reached a new 52 Week Low at 1.78
"Just some points worth restating now that HFG, MMM, and APRN (the three publically traded meal kit companies with operations in the US) have all posted Q3 numbers. Instead of looking at year over year quarters, I am more focused on COVID back to back quarters and here is the run down (Euro & Australian Dollars converted to US$).MMM has 362K global customers and HFG hit 5M global customers. But in the US, MMM has only 180K customers up slightly from Q2 (4K). HFG lost US customers from Q1 to Q2 (2.64M down to 1.98M). They regained some of that reaching 2.49M customers in the US during Q3. APRN dropped from 396K in Q2 to 357K in Q3. I am not suggesting anything here just pointing out US market sizes and that for MMM and HFG, the US represents a significant 50% of their customer base.As for revenue, MMM decreased from $83.3M (Q2) to $81.5M (Q3) with US revenue going down from $43.5M to $40.2M. HFG global revenue increased from $1,102M to $1,148M with US revenue increasing from $598M to $623M. APRN’s revenue decreased from $131M to $112M. Again, just stating numbers.The global market for these three includes 5.72M customers with combined revenues of about $1.34B. Of that HFG has over 87% of global customers and about 86% of the group’s revenue. MMM has a little over 6% of the group’s customer base and 6% of the group’s revenue. APRN also has a little over 6% of the group’s customer base but over 8% of the group’s revenue. MMM revenue per customer is about $225 and HFG’s is about $220. APRN’s revenue per customer is significantly higher at over $313 per customer!As of yesterday afternoon, MMM’s market cap was $330M and HFG’s market cap was $9,172M both down after earnings just like APRN. APRN’s market cap was only $109.5M. The total market cap for all three is over $9.6B. Naturally, HFG owns the lion’s share of the market and about 95% of the market cap. MMM’s percentage of the market cap is about 3.5%. APRN’s market cap is just over 1% as compared to the other two even though its numbers are on par with MMM which lost 30% of its shareholder value right after earnings due to dilution. I suggest APRN is way undervalued. And if you factor in the reality that APRN only operates in the US while both MMM and HFG report that the US is about 50% of their customer base and revenue, then APRN’s value actually doubles in comparison. My conclusion for this stock’s inept valuation is that it has been toyed with and hopefully that time has now passed."
"So, apparently they broke lease of rented warehouse space, paid 1.5 mil to get out of it. Doesn’t sound like expansion to me"
Feel like buy out offer is in the works. Anytime now.
CEO and board quiet silence as the company crumbles ...they must have a long weekend in Nantucket . CEO does nothing to promote or pump the stock up SELL THE COMPANY
NOT SELLING
NM up 20%

Snagged 2200 shares at $11.91 today. Play money. PT is $16.
There usually is a stock offering a few days after a significant reverse stock split. My guess is 5 million shares at $4.50 post split. Be careful.
"A little insight into the upcoming ER. Aprn has stated that capacity is increasing and that sales have a sharp increase. This isn't hard to see where Aprn is headed into the ER. Being around $12 is huge and Edith can see a huge pop into and after the ER. Why? It's simple really. Beyond the capacity and big spike in interest, let's not forget about the upcoming guidance. While most companies have done away with guidance, due to horrific future numbers, Aprn will be gladly and proudly letting us all know where it's heading. Which is much, much higher! Sales, Revenue, and soon stock price! Yeah!"
"The last run took this to $28, remember? This will take it to $50."
"Hello will buy Blue eventually! they can't kill Blue, they got to buy it. hopefully 70$/ share. can't sell cheap as 30$!. wait n see in less than a year!"
"End of July this was stock around $14. Now cut in almost half in less than a month, one would think that management would come out with some positive news if they have any? Like a what price did they they get the stock offering and how much were bought? Or; what plans they have made to increase returns? (marketing Etc.) where I presume some of these extra money are supposed to go?I am currently short (from $12.26 with a stop loss at $10.00) but I am a trader and willing to switch to long if I see some signs that APRN is being managed wisely for future profits.Best of luck to all! Cheers!"
Short squeeze will happen on the 25th when these may puts expire

"On Blue Apron's Facebook page:Please see below for a letter from our President & CEO To our community of home cooks:First, I want to thank you for your patience during this unprecedented time. We had to make some difficult decisions this week that impacted our service and I want to personally email an explanation.On behalf of the team at Blue Apron, we are truly sorry for any issues you may have experienced. Within the span of 48 hours, we saw an increase in orders that surpassed the staff we had in place to fulfill this higher-than-expected demand, and this caused some challenges in our fulfillment process.We know we are in a position to help people across the country by delivering fresh meals to their door so our intent is to help as many people as possible by getting them the food they need. To do this, we had to make some choices. First, we simplified our operations so that our team could fulfill more orders. This meant we discontinued a set of recipes for all customers, which allowed us to send more meals to more homes. Even with streamlining our operations, we had to delay a subset of orders and informed some customers that we would not be able to send them a box until the week of 3/30. We had to make some changes faster than we were able to communicate them to you and understand the frustration this may have caused.While this is not the experience we are known to deliver, the good news is, we are ramping up our capacity very fast and plan to fulfill all of the orders we receive by the next delivery cycle, as early as 3/30. We may have to discontinue some recipes in future cycles to maintain our focus of getting more food to more people but assure you this is only temporary. Moving forward, we promise to consistently communicate product updates to you.We are working extremely hard to serve our customers. We are also doing our part to support communities in need with food donations through our existing food bank partners: City Harvest, Tarrant Area Food Bank, and Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano. And, we are about to launch a partnership with Feeding America that will enable our customers to get involved––stay tuned for more details on this. This is a trying time for all of us, and we are doing our best to help as many people as we can.To our most loyal customers, thank you for your longstanding commitment. Whether you’re new to Blue Apron or you’ve been with us for years, we want you to know that we value everyone who invites us into their home and chooses to cook with us.We hope a home-cooked meal from us brings some comfort and joy to you and your loved ones during this challenging time in our world. Thank you again for your trust, patience, and understanding.Linda Findley KozlowskiPresident and CEO"
 LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE & SEE HOW EASILY THISCOULD TRIPLE YOUR MONEY You'll be BUYING. APRN after reading this article https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2019/08/02/5-positive-factors-ahead-of-blue-apron-earnings.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo Now keep in mind the earnings are out and it consolidated and is starting to base and climb. You chartists can easily confirm this.
Looks like covering has begun. Volume up your morrow will be interesting 
"Frankly, who believes we will be back to our normal lives and eating at restaurants in less than a month?"
Don’t panic ! It’s a loading time for huge jump to upside !
"$1.50 towards $8.50, great opportunity to earn good"
"APRN cannot even make money during lockdown, now that lockdowns are lifted next week, this is going back to $2."
I think I'm gonna be in this until the end of next week. If it starts ONLY going up %10 or so I'll start thinking of a sell but im thinking $50 isnt out of the question within two weeks really.
The calm before the short squeeze storm!
It will ride back up. It’s all machines now.
"There is this struggle between Hello Fresh and Blue Apron, where Hello Fresh is trying to expand into North America. There is seemingly a renewed ad war on social media this quarter too. If Hello Fresh starts missing on any front (like if APRN steals some of their subs this quarter), their stock price is going to take a significant hit.... while if APRN shows some growth this quarter, they will find a nice pop in price... Hello Fresh needs to buy Blue Apron to successfully take over the NA market and eliminate their painful competitor there asap @Bastian."
soon < $1
Buy on dips. Profit taking is healthy for a stock to rise
skooter

"Main issue I have with BA. Actually they don’t know what they are doing yet. They are continuing to do little tests instead of focusing on fixing what is causing them to fail. Further, Lofty words without substance behind the are an insult to share holders."
"Holy Cow! 2,480,000 shares shorted. And that number could be even higher if you add the shorted shares in the last few days. When hedgefunds are willing to take such risks like this is because they're insiders and running the company. Notice how the earnings report was pushed to feb 19th when traditionally is late January or beginning of February. They are desperate to get retail to sell and are trying to hit as many margin calls as possible before starting to cover the shorts and beginning to accumulate the shares. Of course they don't tell the bod of mgt that. Morgan Stanley and Citi are definitely behind all this."
BA sent out an ad for beyond meat today at 5:00 PM. Feels like they are talking some smack ahead of the earnings call.
"GO WTRH TOO! EXACTLY LIKE BLUE APRON, COMPETITIVENESS WILL MAKE BOTH OF THESE STOCKS FLY!! WTRH & APRN FTW!!"

"APRN is not ready for what’s coming yet. They are taking steps to increase their stock by March 30. This is very normal for any small business that sees a huge increase of customers in a few days. This company is not going to be bankrupted if any meals they have gets sold out. As soon as they are coming with new stock this will fly up like a Mf. However in the long term, after the virus slowly fades away this company will go back to being a 5-6$ dollar stock."
Thank you for selling your shares to me at $13!
My wi-fi in my home can’t keep up! 
So in 24 hours this stock has gone from a 10 percent premarket upswing to a 7 percent loss ?? Good to see the fundamentals have absolutely NOTHING to do with stocks anymore.
"WTRH +100% too, don't miss train"

"Number One meal kit 2015 ,2016,2017 nearly 2 billion dollars value at IPO what a bunch of sheeeeeeet has done nothing since IPO but steal money from Long share holders This company will be talked about for the next 100 years at every Business school the MOST EPIC FAILURE OF ANY IPO want to see something funny watch some videos of the first CEO going to investors groups before IPO suit and tie saying how great Blue apron and will be in every kitchen in the USA .... how meal kits are the wave of the future he was right just not Blue Apron he meant to say Hello Fresh"
We eroded from $10.31 six months ago. Much to still be gained here.
Hello Fresh is currently trading at 44.15 US dollars Blue Apron is trading at 7 .00 divided by 15 reverse split is .46 cent why you ask ?? one company was founded by Con Artist 's and fraudsters who only wanted to go Public they had zero game plan on how to make a profit and still don't !the other A German Company well oiled machined with an outstanding CEO and Board .
Blue Apron was broke now 13.44 dollar on a R/S Crazy

"If it want for the imminent dilution, this would be trading at $15/share. That’s the value of the supply chain alone."
Another Green Day for Aprn! Yeah!
Should be an interesting day.
These are bargain prices per share blue already went up near 10 on friday and will probably head higher again this week. I picked up a few more today couldnt resist this stock will be back up in no time meal kits are so needed right now and even blue has to work extra to keep up with demand. Dont get discouraged one bit this stock will be headed for the teens again and might even surpass the all time highs of $20s this year. Dont be fooled and I recommend some of you actually try blue apron for a week the recipes are better than some of the most expensive dining spots and was easy to make. This stock is going to climb and any red day like this im collecting shares and holding long term.
"they are strapped for cash and secondary A class offering is to pay salaries, buyers will have to get very low risk terms, (i.e. can convert to common and dump in open mkt in months), and offer price will come down substantially to be less that $9. so load up or load down"
"A 'fit and healthy' nurse, 36, on the frontline of the battle against coronavirus is now in critical condition after being diagnosed with the illness, her devastated family have revealed.Areema Nasreen, a mother-of-three, tested positive for the virus after developing a soaring temperature, body aches and a cough.The nurse, who has no underlying health conditions, and has worked for the NHS for 16 years, was taken to Walsall Manor Hospital in the West Midlands after her condition worsened.She is now on a ventilator in intensive care - being cared for by the medics she usually works alongside."
Who's having fun today! Yeah!
Lock your shares by putting a sell order with good till cancelled. Dont let shorties borrow your shares. Let’s give them a good pain boys.
Wait.............Aprn just turned green! Yeah! ha.
"If BA just gets 10% if WWI customers, watch out, BA will get back to 1 million customers. The speed of getting WWI customers will be fast. Cooked meals taste better then the precook meals. Need a close above $1.03 soon. It's about time."
"I expect the market to be red tomorrow and give back some of its gains. When it does, it will be thinking of the Coronvirus. And the more people think of the Cornonavirus, the higher this stock goes. So tomorrow I expect it to close at around $13!"
"Slowly coming back.. I bought at 6.25 and didn't sell. Fundamentals are strong, there is absolutely demand for this in theIndustry. It's just a question of B apron holding their quality, lining up customers and growth rapidly, or both.Either route yields a buyout or a win! Analysts will start upgrading and I say in a few yearswe're double the size. Price, eh. Sure it's not free like Snapchat but it's a hell of a lot more marketable and versatile across markets thank disappearing movies that anyone else can make. Shorting a youngand weak company like this is just low"
I bought the dip again ... scared money don’t make money
Going back to 7.75-8.50+ range after earnings.
GIVEN THE REVERS SPLIT 1:15..THIS IS UNDERVALUED
"I feel even if earning call has all good news,shorts will take control"
SO WHOS BUYING US ? AND FOR HOW MUCH ?
"For once I’d like to read something meaningful on these posts, not hopes and dreams and predictions. Facts and accurate news seem to be not important anymore :)"
APRN Longs will be rewarded Despite huge market drop Still holds firmly
Hellofresh will be the first to approach the company on a buyout. Quote me on that. This is a very bullish press release. The shorts will try to keep us down tomorrow. There will be a standoff between the bulls and bears but eventually the bulls will take charge on heavy volume.
ETSY Blueprint is being implemented into APRN; Female target marketing. I wouldn't want to be short on this stock.
FYI as of today (9/9) first available delivery is October 8. I am assuming its another full quarter of max capacity sales. Their guidance of Q3 loss was based on historical trends. I will be very surprised if they are not close to breakeven at net income and positive on EBITDA and cash flows for the July-Sep quarter.
APRN reached a new 52 Week Low at 2.91
"This is just speculation, nothing has confirmed. I would not buy at this point"
"To Edith, this look like it about to double. Possibly triple. Yeah?"
wish it follow $KOSS move from ~ $5.50 to $50
if it goes under 4.00. I'll have to buy another 2500 and see where the ship takes us
APRN Over $8 this year2019 $13$+Hold on your shares
"fake information yahoo, says bluething overvalued?"
"Haha, even Blue Apron knows the stock is massively overvalued, so they try increase capital as long as the stock is soo expensive."
WTRH could move up when doordash ipo comes out maybe mid December this could help APRN move up food delivery good now
"Heading North Oversold , short squeezed Prep for huge jump"
"at one point I thought they assets I thought they owned a farm ? The office in Manhattan is leased the two facilities remaining facility in Texas was shut down right before virus LOL are leased so they have zero land , zero offices , probably all the Mercedes are leased they have nothing to sell but name and mailing list and current subscribers . Zero zippy assets except for the loan and cash on hand no wonder they couldn't sell company who wants to buy an email list for 100 million"
"How bad can it go? I believe even if things go bad it’s gone be after the virus goes away... this company is soon gone be profitable, and profits are not important, just the grow of earnings will make it triple!"
I am a buyer at .50
i am in bought at 6.78. When people are fearful...
"Bottom line, people want already cooked food delivered, not ingrediants...."
What is your real projection? No day dreamer please. I would like to know around what price will start to drop today...
"You shorts are staring into a dark abyss. I rarely take pleasure in others pain, but in this case I will make an exception."
"The problem with APRN is not enough customers. This is simple to understand and is the primary reason why the stock is now 70 cents per share. After the reverse split, the problem will remain. BUT, there will be a lot of runway before it goes BK. Pure genius! Everyone reading this post is a genuine bag holder. It does not matter when you bought in, you are a bag holder. The RS allows to be a bag holder for just a bit longer."
8.38 divided by15 is .55 a share long term investors 97% down from IPO of 10 to .55 great Job blue Apron
This is an excellent entry point
Keep the price here for a week. I will move some funds in so can buy more.
Ok who’s holding over night? If you don’t you’re losing on the breaking news for them!
so does the RS take place next week or the week after. Thanks
“Everyone knew ( except the investing public) this IPOwas an escape plan for insiders/VC.” OUCH ! Now that hurts......
29 days to get into compliance or become delisted - HAHA!!
"Simple fact is, their balance sheet is horrible. Fair value of this stock is $3/share- if that. This company is loaded with $53 million in debt. Expenses are out of control. Losses have increased substantially Q over Q. Revenues have crashed for 3 years running. And one quarter (maybe 2 quarters) of panic buying isn't going to save this company. Company is out of half of their items...can't fulfill current orders...and is hiring (more expenses) to meet current demand. Once this Coronavirus dies down, the stock will die too."
Will this plunge 35% like Grubhub did yesterday. That’s why I worry until there is a better sense of turnaround.
"APRN , $5.50++ after Earning announcements Best time to accumulate And Longs , hold on your shares !"
11$ back. Just hold tight. Great food and I buy every week. Startups take time.
Just created an account with Blue Apron with first meal delivery next week. If I like the delivery service and quality of food I think I'll buy some more APRN. Looks like it's about $10 per meal which isn't too bad. A little more expensive than doing own groceries but cheaper than eating out. Anyone else have any opinions on their service and food? Will more and more people opt into this service?
soooo the stock went up but that EPS is still -4.666 if that's not an omen i dont know what is.
Where do you come up with an $8.00 target

cheap shares boys!!!!! Keep accumulating
This is a one off bumper quarter. It is all downhill from here for APRN. The expect 18m loss next quarter. The price action will show it today. Sell now and move on to much more profitable trades.
Edith's face waiting for the bell. Yeah! ha. Let's go!
"I suggest wait for the ER. MMM posted last week and for all the fools that are focused solely on customer count, their numbers should be sobering. MMM posted their second profitable quarter with an EBITDA of $1.5M (converted EU To US$) up from last qtr's $.5M. This was on revenue of $83.7M half of which was in the US. Interestingly, revenue rose only 2.7% from Q2 ($2.2M).All the while MMM lost nearly 10% of its customers (35K) from Q2 to Q1, 19K in the US. Hmmm ... and yet they made more money?I can't say for certain what the stock will do, but I suspect APRN to post solid numbers. Oh, and shorts should be careful. I hear that there is a band of 'short' crushers out there just looking for something to buy."
"They are un-American......to short a company like this in these times. Disgusting. They have no shame. We should be pulling together and supporting companies who supply our needs in these rough times, not the opposite. This just displays how disgusting shorts really are, no regard for the net benefit to society, just want to destroy a company, who in desperate times, provide quality food to those who can’t go out. I just don’t understand how humans can be so self absorbed. Let this company strive right now...justified or not, just stay away and let it be overvalued and move....plenty of more stocks to short than one supplying people with food. So disappointed in society, shorts have absolutely no shame."

"Ok so I’m down now on blue apron. Not in a lot of money, and I know about not trying to catch a falling knife, but there is been some news and they have been on commercials lately. I can’t see them going under 5.00’but if they do, 3.00 could be the next stop. Only down 57.00 but it’s still 3 percent in less then a week. Still a little humbling. That’s ok, it’s either a screaming buy at these prices are a stay away. Opinions and facts in this company please. I’m not going to sell wjat I have but I may buy more"

"Don't forgot this is a company that benefits from the pandemic. That is a rare commodity/attribute in this market. Most businesses have been obliterated (HTZ, OXY, CCL, etc). 2Q guidance is all that matters, and it was $130MM when the street was expecting $118MM. More importantly, that represents almost 10% annual growth (first time since went public), and POSITIVE operating cash flows. This is a volatile stock in both directions."
Very low volume ?
"I have been following this stock for a while, but never took the risk of investing in it. They seems to be going no where. There is a company in the Canadian market that offer the same service.

Don't jump in to fast. This will tank as fast as it went up.Typical pump and dump. I have heard that they can't fulfill all orders already as they have shortages of ingredients for many of the meals.
I'm short selling it at $11.33 because!
Guys it’s worth buying it now at this price 5.5$ please.!! Any suggestion please
Probably the best thing this company could have done to save it. Still some skepticism but overall positive outlook from here on out.
It’s almost comical how hard shorts are pushing this stock. I’d be laughing more if I didn’t own it. I will not sell. Not like this. Ride it out. I got time.
bought additional 3k shares at 0.79 total at 7K shares.
Blue Apron has $1.21 of cash per share. I think 62 cents is extremely undervalued for this stock.
quarterly numbers will be continuously horrible and aprn will dip into $2s
"The environment is very bullish for APRN as people over 60 are being asked to never leave their homes, and schools of all prestige are going online. A small percentage will go the easiest and most indulgent route for food, they will go with APRN."
Started a new positing today at 5.38 only 1500 shares just to nibble
The bar to beat ER is so low that they will most likely smash ER and start the climb north from there. This stock is so low that it can jump 25% on APRN hitting a single.

anything under 15 dollars is still trading under a dollar pre-split. has a lot of room to come up if Linda keeps growing it as she states. very bullish going into 2020
As it gets closer to ER the shorts will be covering. It’s too risky for them not to cover otherwise they would be shorting more. It’s a dice game for the shorts and the clock is ticking.

"From just filed 8K""Blue Apron has built a strong operations team, and Jason and Greg have played key roles in driving the ability of our operations to scale and meet the demands of our customers. We will continue that work, executing our strategy while simultaneously increasing capacity and capability as they take on additional responsibilities to lead the entire team,” said Kozlowski. “Alan was instrumental in building the structures and processes these teams leverage today, and we thank him for his contributions and leadership and wish him the best in his future endeavors.""Blue Apron continues to see heightened demand for its meal kits as a result of changes in consumer habits related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has now scaled operations to meet the increased demand, and has started re-introducing variety in its menu, as well as returning to executing on its product and marketing strategies designed to engage existing customers and support the acquisition of new customers.Blue Apron also reiterates its 2020 second quarter financial outlook provided on April 29, 2020 and continues to position itself for sustained long-term growth."""

This will go to 30.00 this year
How can a company be successful when everything it offers sells out so quickly? PS this is not a Yogi Berra question; this is more of a supply chain issue.
This is just the beginning I’m sure.
"Hello Fresh USA revenues for the last 4 quarters (old to new in US$m)- $337, $502, $604, $602 (estimate)Blue Apron revenues for the last 4 quarters (old to new in US$m)- $94, $102, $131, $112 (actual)In the same time period, HF has added ~$260m in revenue, increased its profits and quadrupled the share price. APRN on the other hand managed to add $20m in revenue, still loses money below $120m in revenue and destroyed shareholder wealth pretty much every month of the way! (am extremely pis*ed right now that the management is not taking this opportunity to take some share of the growing market)"
I like the premise of this company. But the history of this company is showing that its a fad. Sales fluctuate and decrease so it will decrease in future but for now it seems to be at a fluctuation phase. Maybe this stock will double? Cannacord analyst maria ripps thinks so. Her track record is superb at over 75% success rate and whopping 50%+ profit margin. She is ranked top 100 analysts but that over 50% profit margin could be top 10 who knows.

This looks like it’s on discount...
Aprn will be bought out by the end of June for around $9
Amazon Prime Pantry is closed because of the insane coronavirus demand. I can only imagine how many customers Blue Apron is adding every day.. They could easily 10x their customer numbers this quarter. Then that unicorn valuation they had in 2017 would look small in comparison.

"A couple of quick comments here. Today was a good day for anyone holding. But... we have seen these green spikes before in a sea of red chart lines. Tomorrow will be significant in my opinion. RSI and MACD (if you follow technicals) are all suggesting oversold. Stochistics turned today with %K rising above %D -- normally a trend reversal sign. The next couple days will be important in defining the actual trend. IMHO so long as we close up tomorrow on decent volume, we should be in good shape for some upward movement. Unfortunately if we find ourselves back in the 6s again... well we would either be retesting the bottom of around 6.50 or continuing the downward spiral. Unfortunately we are coming into a 3-day weekend... so a number of traders already on vacation.Hoping for the best. Still looking for 8s. I believe we will see double digits before the next earnings call, but that is a ways off. Good luck to those holding -- be well and stay safe."
Yesterday was a big down day for all stocks. A fluke. Buy the dip. Won't last. Weight Watchers is up.

"Short volume is finally down, while trading volume is high. I'm expecting a more good news from APRN this week to push us upwards. All the hype is good for their business model as it simply floods the top of their funnel with emails. Expect more ads to drive conversion and subscriptions will go through the roof. Even if it drops off after we get the ""all clear."" It will do wonders for this stock in the near term."

With their debt and low cash on hand they should do an offering at these prices so they don’t have to dilute the shareholders as much. What you think?
"To my chagrin, I admit to buying the IPO stock of APRN. At that time, I did not feel stupid or used. Now that APRN has spit the bit, people are coming out of the woodwork saying we were all had by those who floated the IPO. In retrospect, this meal kit concept is a stretch. Customers try it once or twice and then leave. But I was not stupid 18 months ago. It just seem so right and I could make a lot of money."

This stock will definitely make a comeback. Will be a good 2Q. It is priced to buy now.
Don’t forget to put a high sell order which expires months later. This will lock your shares and your broker cannot lend them to shorties.
"For 2 years I’ve been getting cracks by the Shorts, payback time! You can have my shares at $15! Don’t worry, I have a lot, a lot!"
Very sweet point to enter. I sold at $3.90 and bought in today agai . I have done multiple trades with APRN over the last year and made good profit every time. I believe this time wont be any different.

"Like stated before, Airbnb is a great partner for Blue Apron model. If they can expand that relationship and offer that service to all Airbnb clients as a package, it will expand Blue Apron footprint. Costco will reach a totally different market demographic. Win, Win, situation. Good Luck"
Reason #2 why APRN is down: They should have bought back shares rather than reverse split. A buyback signifies strength not the weakness of a RSS.
Buy out rumors? RIGHT.Also this turn around plan I keep hearing about...I’ll add a little synopsis here. I thought turn around plans were:CostcoAirBnBBob’s Burgers jet.comWWNow an ‘accesory’ Meal kit? How many turn around plans have there been...and what results have been produced?
I think this company going to bankruptcy can’t hold price
Be careful. $1 has been providing a big supoort for many weeks now while the market went nosedive. If breaks $1 then will fill the correction which is due.

"APRN will continue to act opposite the market. Market goes up, APRN goes down. Why? Because people foolishly believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel already, and there's hope that they can return to their lives on the arbitrary date of April 12. Returning to their normal lives means shopping at the market, and eating out. It's a false hope, but it's having real effects on the market."

"I am betting that this crisis is an inflection point for the company and for this stock. The outcome will depend entirely on how well management handles this national crisis. Will the Blue Apron workforce rally around and find a newfound sense of purpose in their jobs by providing a public service during a national crisis? Will management listen to the market forces and adjust the company's business model? That is the bet we are all making in the end. And with only 8 million shares in the float, a 50+% short interest, and 2 years of negative news, I am voting YES.What are you voting for?"

"I called the SEC today concerning reverse split of APRN stock. They said it will take some time before the exchange delists the stock. By then, the Company does something such as a reverse split to be in price compliance. Most companies do a deep reverse such as 3:1 to get some leeway. But the process is often in vain for 70% of all companies that have listing problems ultimately go bankrupt."
"Being short APRN (from $12.26) I have a decision to make. DO I cover before the earnings call end Oct 2020 or do I bet on the results being abysmal (again). On one hand; they HAVE had improving results, the competitors are having great earnings, and they WERE unlucky with their facility closure timing.On the other hand; their (external/investor) information flow sucks and might reflect the whole organization, ARE they earning any money with current prices and promotions, will the ever changing management and board members do more harm than good?They might even come out with a mixed bag. It could be better results, but also inform us that the private placement for more cash, did NOT work out well and they will need to issue more (diluting) shares for more fund raising.Any constructive input is appreciated - Incl. what you would do. Cheers!"
"This is interesting. According to Zacks today, ""Investors in Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. APRN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 26, 2019 $10.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.""So this big move obviously has to be the earnings report on August 6. Now let's put two and two together. If you are management and you know you had a bad second quarter, you are not going to go next day to an investors' conference to make a fool out out of you.. It's just plain common sense. Mgt timed the PR one day before the investors conference. This wasn't coincidence. They know they have a knock out punch. Then all over sudden the deal with Beyond Meat and WW will just piggy back behind the positive momentum."

"Use your head and think. The demand for fresh foods and healthy ingredients is more needed now than ever. That’s what blue apron sells, fresh ingredients! Businesses are closed until the end of the month or even longer, this stock will be in higher demand than ever."

"Our family started using Blue Apron over a year ago and love them. Cheaper and better for you then eating out, and usually a great deal better tasting too. Also a great way to learn New recipes…. I / We most buy and trade stocks of companies we have had experience with and sew greatness. Bought LUV Southwest Airlines about 6 years ago for $18 a share. Pays a decent dividend too.. After having flown on SW several times before. I only wish I had bought LUV back in the 1980's I be retired now....My long winded point is, I see greatness, Love their products and know may others do as well. If you have a good product, people really like it and see value,,, ,that company will make profits regardless of what external or internal forces work against it. APRN will see $18 and will not take 5 years like SW, more like a year"

"Blue Apron is the next HMNY, as soon as it Reverse split, price will drop below $1 again and they will be at risk of being delisted again. The best option for them right now is to just move to OTC market or liquidate. Look, a lot of these IPOs are actually bad business ideas, but the original investors want to get paid so they unload it to the public: GoPro, SFIX, HMNY, etc."
"Blue Apron should capitalize on this and get a celebrity to cook the recipes live stream. This is a no brainer and could encourage thousands to join and share part.

"Our blue apron order arrived on time last week, and this weeks order is arriving today. It fed our family of 5 easily, and was delicious"
"I shorted $APRN at $14 and bought 10 $14 put contracts with a Jan 2021 expiration. I'm up quite a bit on this now and it's still dropping like a rock. I think it can touch $2. I'm gonna wait until this drops further before covering, they're out of money in a matter of months. Who the hell went long on this turd. So many better companies in this space."
"Let me get this straight: We have to best possible environment for APRN, but they are loosing more than 10% of customers in 3 months and q4 will be even worse revenue-wise?Their competitors have increased revenue by more than 100%. Whole management team should pay back their paychecks of the last years, this is embarrasing."
ooo Bloomberg TV just covered Maria's upgrade for APRN to $18
"APRN c’mon late April beat on EPS, Rev, EBITDA, guide higher next quarter, guide higher full year. If that happens stock will go up 50% next day open then drift up much higher to low $2’s"
"I am thinking of doing a cover put for .70 a share with a price at $3.00 until April 17th. After personal research and the current demand for this product, what are your opinions on this?"
Buy every dip. Blue Apron is so undervalued compared to its competitors. This will eventually recover to its IPO levels. Just buy and hold for a year or 2.
"why yahoo says ""bullish"" long term? :)"
Will go up and close green today. Shorts should cover with these discounted prices.
5.00 by the end of the week
I'm so sorry that I mislead all you investors. I mistakenly said we would break $13 today. My bad. We're breaking $14 today!

The problem with Costco is you have to be a Costco member to purchase the meal kits. That limits who they are selling to... which is a very bad move. People who like to buy in bulk and “save” money shop at Costco. Walmart and SAM’S Club would be smarter move.
Who is actually buying this stock? This company is the epitome of “should have stayed private”.
Some very large volume action around 1:48 PM ET. Interesting!
"just wait for terrible quarterly numbers, this thingy will sink to $3-$4 range"
Someone must have known something that we small investors are not privy to. This stock is about to go up big time.
Split adjusted it's trading at $0.66 per share; AND Its EASILY WORTH $2.00 min min OR $30 split adjusted DONT OVER THINK IT; it's NOT ROCKET SCIENCE
50 dollars a share here we go lol 5 year chart says it all only Prayer is a buyout or merger
I just put an order in at 229let's see what happens 
"I have been long APRN since mid-March, so my opinion will be biased toward the upside. With that said, Q1 ended on March 31st, COVID-19 emerged fully on March 11th - indicating that the bulk of increased demand from the virus wouldn't show up until Q2. Despite this, the company ADDED 25,000 NEW CUSTOMERS without fully incorporating the COVID-19 demand boost. That indicates some degree of ORGANIC GROWTH unrelated to the virus. In addition, it makes sense that the company spent more money in Q1 seeing as they had to add new employees to accommodate the expected demand. Even further, it seems the credit window has opened for Blue Apron as they have filed a shelf registration for $75 million in stock or debt. This story ain't over. Long APRN"

Should I sell? I bought for 20K at 5.67
The earning actually is not bad. The future guidance is quite good for BA to me. With it to evolve. The stock is a buy at this price range.
told you so
Last night I was attending the San Jose Sharks hockey game. The people in the suite next to us were drinking pretty heavy and as the gamde progressed they started speaking louder and louder.
Blue Apron Reaches $13 Million Settlement in Investors’ Suit (1)
"Sorry, got it wrong, I guess it's falling to back to around 6-7 tomorrow or next week"
"Customer numbers dropped to their second lowest point since 2015 while they operate in the best possible environment. After covid the average order rate und value will fade. Net loss in 2020 was 45m$, -10% margin. Dont see the touraround here, especially if the covid effect ends."
"Aprn's enterprise value to market value is 1.5 when it should be <1.2 as it was previous 2 quarters. Compare that to hello fresh, whose ev/mc is 0.9-1.0 through last six quarters. That suggests to me that as long as this company is running, the market value has to adjust up 30-50% short to mid term to be where it should be."
AMAZON should bought APRN not whole food market.
"AprnAPRNInvestors should look into the charts, the ups and downs and sides moves are totally normal !!!!If you look at the other sectors, they all have almost the same moves!!Hold on your shares, and trust your investment. The only way that shorts win is when Longs gives in and sell cheap! April $3++$8 mid year Target , over $13 this year Hold on your shares"
Looks like Mr. Wnderful may lose the contest.
"After $SNAP, $APRN, $LYFT, $UBERs IPO, I think a private or insider investors cash up the money."
"Do not expect Q1 to be a beat on revenue ($90 to $100m) or net loss (loss of $22m-$26m) as they most likely did not benefit from COVID in March. Company recognizes revenue on delivery and not when the order is put. This is what the company said on COVID on March 19.. ""Over the last week we have seen a sharp increase in consumer demand. We are increasing our capacity for future orders and expect to fulfill this increased demand by the next available weekly cycle, starting on 3/30"".. To me, the following 2 things will drive the stock up from here-1. Robustness of Q2 guidance will be the key driving force for the stock. I expect them to guide to at least $150m-$170m in revenue with EBITDA profitability in a HSD number..Company will definitely benefit from an extended covid restrictions as a 3rd of their customers are 55+ in age and 56% of their customers make $100k+....So essentially people who are at risk of covid but are affluent enough to not care about the price.2. Any positive update on strategic alternatives most importantly receving cash infusion. I DOUBT this will happen but if it does, it will be a major boost"
"""100% of our fresh eggs come from pasture-raised laying hens. By comparison, less than 1% of the eggs sold in the U.S. today are pasture-raised.""I like this company. Granted, that may not affect the stock price, but they're doing good things."
TAKE....YOUR....PROFITS...This isn't a $16.00 stock under any circumstances...
If sears is still trading....... Blue Apron going nowhere. Linda will put in her own money to keep the train rollin........
Owning this stock feels like ‘Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’ where the big cases keep getting taken out. I own the 50 cent case
News coming or what?
Everything on the earning is positive except for guidance that makes absolutely no sense.How could you be expecting net revenue to grow in Q3 but somehow also plan to lose 18 million when you made money this quarter?
Heavy volume
"dumb question. can you buy and then sell on the day of the IPO, or you can't day trade?"
If 2nd wave is a thing then we will probably go back to double digits soon.
SHORT SQUEEZE HIGH VOLUME MAY BREAK 30 TOMORROW...THEN IT DROPS LIKE A ROCK...GET YOUR EASY MONEY WHILE YOU CAN. I BOUGHT AT 7.35 SOLD AT 25. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE RISK WITH ANY MOMENTUM STOCK BUT THE PERFECT STORM OF THE LAST RISE IS FORMING GOOD LUCK TO ALL AND STAY SAFE
IPO 11 drops to 1 dollar you jump in because you think it’s an amazing price now almost 65% down
How would BYND drive subscriber growth at APRN? How will this actually impact the business in a material way? Will new people join because of this? Seems unlikely. This is a frenzy and shares are already below $10 after hours!
After lunch will be excellent for longs
Did anyone else listen to the earnings call? Is it normal for so few questions from analysts? Are there any major banks even covering APRN?
looks like one of those bull flags - nice volume
"All technicals for APRN have broken down...sell & buy when things stabilize...Hopefully, some lucky folks were able to profit when it went from .65 to 1.60"
"eheheheheh, who are the bag holders still holding?you can still cut losses and move on, do not wait for earnings, after earnings bluethingy will trade in the $3-$4 range"
The stock will POP when Hello Fresh buys it out @ $4.30/share
"Im for the company, however they need to find a stronger player of the delivery of the product. Fedex isnt the best, and yes i am a customer. I can say that blue apron has excellent customer service."
Every month or two I check in to see how APRN is doing and it just keeps going lower and lower. Every time I read comments about how it’s reached a bottom. I really do feel sorry for the longs.
this will never ever ever hit $8 again!
"Just saw this on Blue Apron Reddit page.Save Blue Apron - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is￼Blue Apron is one of those stocks (APRN) you heard about that is heavily shorted. The shorts have been playing her since this summer. Currently trading at about $10 when it should be trading at around $40 just to be on par (customers & revenue) with Marley Spoon (MMM). If they were to be on par with HelloFresh, APRN would be pricing around $80.That‘s right, this wonderful meal kit company, one of only three publicly traded meal kit companies serving the US market and the industry’s founding brand, has about 6% of the combined customer base and revenue (12% if you factor in that APRN ONLY operates in the US which represents 1/2 of the global meal kit market).Sadly shorts have been crushing Blue Apron to the point where it’s market cap is just 1% of the combined investment in these three companies. It should be 6x if you compare APRN to its global competitors. And if you focus solely on the US market as Blue Apron does, it’s value should be 12x - near its IPO price of $150 ($10 followed by a 15:1 reverse split).Word here and elsewhere is that if just a small number of retail investors each buy just a handful of shares, a short squeeze will kick in. Before the GameStop thing, APRN was around $7 and even then, heavily shorted so shorts where targeting a lot lower ($4ish). Since then, to shorts dismay, APRN has been stubbornly movingup, hovering now around $10.All Blue Apron needs is a gentle push and the shorts will do the rest. Once the stock begins to move up toward levels where it should be trading ($39, $60, $120), shorts will create their own buying frenzy simply to cover their positions.So as you plan your APRN orders this week, take a few bucks (just a weeks worth of food perhaps) and buy a few shares of Blue Apron. Not only will you be feeding your soul, you’ll likely make a handsome return.Oh and by the way, Blue Apron reports Q4 results next Thursday 2/18/21 before markets open. Q4 is an indoor quarter (in addition to the uptick in COVID) and word is that the numbers should be impressive. Then on next day - Friday, February options expire. I suggest picking up a few shares this week as historically, prices go up entering the week befpore earnings.As others note, Blue Apron is extremely undervalued. But don’t just take my word for it. Please do your own research and if inclined to, report here. I would love to hear your thoughts too."
"3 days lost 60% of value, :):):):)"
"going under, unless they raise mo cash :("
Shorties please keep shorting. This is fun to watch.
whole market is screwed up by short sellers. it's hard to invest and earn money in today's Algo based Machine trading.
"Blue Apron is sold out for the entire month of July. lol i dont know why anyone would sell this stock. Ask yourself if its really worth 2% of Hello Fresh’s market cap of 8.6B, BA so undervalued its laughable."
Not good. A green day? Something is wrong.
"Set limit orders to 20$ and lock doen your shares, this way shorts cant play games with them. Its l head games. This company is going back up."
NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS
That’s the problem is keeping up with demand right now.
25 more minutes the APRN rocket will take off. I love to see it hit 30.00 then 50.00 by noon. GLTA!
Push it back up
back to $21 target?
"Increased volume this morning, looking somewhat good."
"There is just no value here: no buildings, no factories, no tangible assets, just a subscriber list, very much debt, no path to profitability or even customer growth."

No worries here. Just keep on adding. I add more when it goes down. Accumulated a lot!
"Stocks Performance In Focus:Taking an investigate the execution of APRNstock, a financial specialist will come to realize that the week by week execution for this stock is esteemed at -17.78%, bringing about a performance for the month at -37.99%.

$APRNall the pieces are in place now.a true stroke of genius by our CEO:1. cost of capital: near zero2. non-dilutivemore than enough capital on hand and also unlimited access to more capital at near zero cost to ramp up production.and there is so much demand for their food kits this is world demand. The paradigm for companies has changed Blue Apron is in the sweet spot.our stock may just hit $20.00+ today.
this stock is still traded? Should have been an OTC awhile back.
I've been in since 210 Great ride so far I keep adding on the hippy dippy
Funny. I haven't heard any shorts or bashers talk the last 2 hours. Wonder where they may be?
Bye bye shorts!
"Loading up more guys,see 5 on Friday"
"Ok.... 150 more shares added at 3.86 Now, up to 850 shares down 678.00 I feel like in the next earnings this is is gonna move big time"

Yahoo shows the last insider sale was May 28. Can that be correct or is there a reporting delay?
"I believe institutions started buying and they won’t stop until this is back to IPO levels. They now have a strong case to squeeze shorts and make millions. I am not blaming them, money is good."

"Looks like all the scammers and pumpers are abondoning the ship and leaving bag holders to chew on the left overs. By now, please realize that there is no long term ownership for this stock. By the time linda scales up, there will be a vaccine and we have to wait for 2030 for the next pandemic."
July is the new date for isolation. Apron will be growing revenues for a while definitely past earnings date.
"This company is great, management is excellent, sales are hiAPRN , Longs , hold on your shares , $2+ next weekApril $8+"
Shorts should really really cover. It is not worth taking the risk here. APRN has a track record of doubling in a single day. This happened multiple times in the past and will likely happen with ER.
Next week $12
Market up hundred of points. Aprn negative. Short will never stop. We will see 2's very very soon. Thank you Linda! You have done a superb job for the shorts!

"When shorts start getting giddy and making jokes, you know it's time for the price to rise back up."
Wow this thing still alive and twitching?? Down 13% after earnings?? I should have waited to cover...
"Take heed of this, shorts. Not sure how much stake you have in this, but what is the point of driving this down to $3 or $2 to make a few pennies, at the risk of losing so much if any company or investor shows an interest to acquire this company at such a bargain? I would advice this would be the time to take your profits you have and move onto something more worthwhile. There are a plenty of rotting fish companies dressed in royal garments in the market for you to short."

"APRN , expect a very huge jump upside Expect over $5Longs ! Hold on your shares!!!!Time is yours ! Now !"
This was the best thing that could’ve happened for this company.
I don't understand the buy out argument. Could someone please explain. The company doesn't seem like it has the proper infrastructure to be a buyout target. If it is a buy out target why and how much?
Buyout should be at least $5 a share. That is half of the IPO price.
I know now why the 4 board members left they jumped off a sinking ship
"Only natural to have a pull back after so much green Buying some more now. This always comes back towards the end of the day. Check any of the days it has been red in the last 2 weeks and you'll see that even when finishing in the red, it finishes much higher than it's lowest point. This will continue it's march north because unfortunately Corona is here to stay for a very long time."

it's only now moved to 65 cents. It will be at 3$ end of the year. That's 39$ /share. Linda will make this happen. She did the same with ETSY.
Management dead silent as longs lose all their money. Longs should know better by now.

Has anyone ordered and or benefited from aprn being ordered from WTW? How does this exactly work? I do not see any aprn representation on the WTW site.
It's obvious that the demographics of the people who use Blue Apron are not the same as the people who are posting comments here.
"As I said yesterday, how can a company that sells out so quickly be successful? What they admitted this morning is that they missed an opportunity by not having fulfillment in line. They say they have ramped up in April and are now rolling. Hope they're right."
"the dip @ 9:45 worked like a charm, 5k shares in, 5k shares out, another $5k day trade"

"Remember when they block trade went through last week? This is how the game is played; the big money buys a shitload of shares, then they loan them out to short so they can manipulate the market. They try to #$%$ investors to sell cuz they make it look like the bottom is falling out of the stock. It's called capitulation. People who sell into the capitulate dont know how to trade. You should be buying instead of selling. Then when the stock recovers, those who sold are like scratching their head."
In 2 weeks we will all wish we had picked up another couple thousand shares in low 1’s
i really like all the negativity. sounds like a good time for me to buy.. dont let the bashers steal your shares guys. company will have a good year.
HANGING THERE TILL NEXT WEEK.HAVE FUN AGAIN.APRN$$$$
2nd leg coming. $22 will be the target.

Commodotizing market and more competitors = less margins and less share. Blue Apron stuck between a Wok and a Hard Place.https://medium.com/@easystreetfinance/blue-apron-between-a-wok-and-a-hard-place-1f05df87503f
Climbing should see 10 shortly
Talk about your V shaped recovery! Yeah! Let's go!
Cmon shorts. You can do better than this. Just a mere of 5 million shares? When we pumped this it hit 100 million volume. You will lose in the end you know that. One of the giants will acquire this at $5B and you will lose everything you own that morning.
"Cannot wait to see the numbers on 8/2, Thanks for these cheap shares!"
We go up now very easy
VERY VERY expensive. This is a 65 cent stock. Delusional foos were downvoting me when I asked them to get out. they thought this will be the next apple. LOL
This has been holding 1.33 - 1.35 for three days through market turmoil. This indicates we are at the bottom . There is gains to be made here.
Welcome BYND folksRemember this is about $1.25 split adjusted. Could easily double or triple from here
And Aprn finally joins the party! Yeah!

"That's right, new strong longs, buy, hold and place reasonable profitable sell orders expiring far from now and never change those sell orders again. Only $35 million worth of shares are available on the open market, assuming a share price of $4."
This is a Gem at these levels. Buy blind folded folks. will be at 3 plus soon
"Okay, guys, I made my usual mistake of trying to quick flip another stock after my APRN shares sold. Now I am stuck in another stock. APRN can go to the moon if you work together longs, just like APT went from $5 to $50 recently. With almost six times the tradable APRN shares traded, you have all the power longs and shorts have all the problems. To the moon, longs!"
Surprised this isn't at $2 now after Coumo just shutdown NY and Blue Apron is located there

Halted!!!
"Right now the focus is the economy, the blue tick stocks, the FAANG, I don’t trust this sudden green move from the market right now when cases keep piling up. This is just a distraction to make us feel better as people are in constant fear however numbers don’t lie and we will see that it won’t be possible to get this country running in 2-3 weeks like nothing happened.

Probably will double
Will APRN have explosive earnings and guidance? is there a buyer? Shorts should be nervous. Survey after survey says people prefer the new format of Blue than HF. Look at HF numbers. What makes them so much better? Thoughts
I’m impressed how everyone can predict the future .. can one of you give me lottery numbers ?
This is unbelievable! Are there any Longs here? This is just insane how it’s dropping. I’m not a short just not a holder yet.
C'mon shorts pile onto that grenade!!

You do realize who is potentially buying this right? A guy who has run tens of companies right into the ground. He is the ultimate charlatan and wants to make it into a “snack” company. Good thinking Tai!

"Ok ladies and gentleman, I'm out. Was short on this with $14 Jan/21 puts purchased back in July when this was trading at $14.25. I still think this company goes to $1, but what's an extra $3 given how crazy this market is. I wasn't in big, only 20 contracts, so $9k profit holding for a little over 4 months. Not Gordo Gecko money, but another smart trade paid off on an overvalued stock. Longs, don't be silly here. We all get it wrong, don't go down with the ship. Cut you losses and find something better. You just have to get it right more than you get it wrong to win. Nobody is correct 100% of the time. If you like his business model, there are better companies out there to go long on. All the best"

"I really must say Blue Apron chose the best possible CEO for the job. I spent some time today listening to her plans on turning around the company and she's right on the money. Her appearance on CNBC was just top notch. I love her confidence and love for the company. She truly believes in the company and that's what most matter in a CEO. She's the full package- talented, a visionary, caring, and just a good understanding of running a business and attracting customers. I'm fully invested in Blue Apron because of her. Anyone know if she's married? I'd put a ring on that finger anytme."

Look back at the charts of the last few days. APRN for some reason starts slow and then ends strong. I think this will be up almost 10% by the close based on the trend of the last few days.
So much negativity driving shorts to BA like sharks. There is little chance BA stock can survive this kind of a chaos.

In Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced Tuesday that he is extending Illinois stay-at-home order until April 30th.
The problem with this reverse split is the reason for it. There is a problem with the way Blue Apron is managed or the business model is flawed. Allowing a reverse split means the problem will not be addressed.
"Whole Foods, salad bar and 1 lb of ginger trail mix. total: $25.47. That's for 1 person! Blue Apron, Knick Knack kit, $8, Costco Roast Chicken $5. That fed 3 adults! Dogs got the rest of the chicken too!"
"When APRNs customer count drops below 300k at any time, than banks can cut the debt and APRN is bancrupt instantly. They lost 30k in the last 3 months and are now at 360k. How long can they survive?"

"I listened to the earnings call again and the second quarter will have more revenues fewer losses and more menu options. Retaining clients study is positive along with a marketing plan. Go ahead and sell now but it will be higher when the second quarter is completed. Patience is hard I get it. Shaw is still a stockholder of 422,000 shares. I’m with him."
"business model of aprn is this, the less it sells the less are the losses ashahahahahahahahah, hello fresh!"
"$8+It’s shaping up , Blue Apron (APRN). The meal kit company just reported quarterly revenue slid 25% from last year as fewer customers signed up. Still, Blue Apron just beat on earnings. The CEO called it a time of transition and building for the future, as they re-focus their priorities."
"During these times no one is listen to ""pumpers"" or ""bashers""...investors are looking for cover, traders are looking for quick value whether dropping or rising. APRN, WTRH and vaccine stocks like INO, CODX and MRNA will have major spikes in volume that will fluctuate back n forth. The market is now a gladiator arena. Crowds will flock to stock news and surges...no fundamentals are really being used at this point."
All time low. Someone needs to buy this or bankruptcy looms.

how many shares of APRN do you own?
can't wait to hear what lame excuses the CEO has for this quarter ...will never forget very first earnings call ...the new facility in New Jersey is way behind schedule and cost have been much more than expected BUT once its up and running and operational we are on path to profit (2017) LOL
Compare to last Q2 and last 3 quarters the company is growing just fine.
GOOD DAY 4 THE LONGS AND THE SHORTS.BUY LOW SELL HGIH.
We should be in the teens. This entire valuation is too low considering the times. All we need is one big buyer to make this right.

"@gary they wouldn’t be planning to expand Grub Hub, Jet.com and Costco to other regions if they weren’t working. Plus he indicated more retail partnerships in the works. They only missed revenue by $7M and beat earnings by $.04. They forecast profitable earnings for Q1 and all of 2019. The partnership with Weight Watchers and their millions of subscribers in Jan 2019 to sell their Freestyle meals are all good signs for growth or buyout at this price. Not sure why the articles on here don’t mention any of this but yet mention some vague Walmart/Ford partnership.....monetary bias? Patience."
Large buy orders vs small sell orders. It’s been like this for the past week and it continues. I seen this type of pattern before. Probably more good news to come at earnings.

"To be $18 or not too be $18. I admit this sucks. The company posted good earnings although they should have provided more optimistic guidance. I don't know why the projected Q3 guidance based on 2019 and not COVID19. Truly a missed opportunity to send a positive message to the markets.That said, Marley Spoon, who climbed wonderfully this past quarter shot up over 40% the day after earnings (same day as APRN). HelloFresh, who also did great this past quarter, is moving up again ahead of their earnings next week. Why APRN is lumbering backwards is a bummer.APRN did not have the upward movement of MMM and HFG this past quarter (150% and 100% respectively). It's market cap (at 2%) is well below their share of the combined revenue and customer base (10%) of these three companies combined. MMM is tracking at 5% (on par) while HFG is at 93% (above par).The stock is worth more than even $18. Unfortunately nobody seems to care yet.But yes, APRN should be an ideal COVID19 play."
"APRN have a chance to become AMZN of food delivery and not just meal kit. They have a chance to acquire grocery and food delivery service to their meal kit subscribers. They can also look into restaurant business that serve their meal kit for family to take home and warm it up. That is not all, it would be very easy to also get into catering business. And lastly can license their name and logo because its becoming a known name."
"Are you people stupid? This stock is worthless, going bankrupt soon. Absolutely worse IPO ever. Stupid idea by guys with zero restaurant experience who suckered stupid investors and their sheep. Anybody with any kind of restaurant experience will tell you its stupid and would never work. These owners think they invented a concept but in reality this wasn't ever done before because the idea of it sucks. Commit to a contract worth of food delivered to your door that you then have to cook? They burn through more cash trying to get a customer than anybody in history, THEN they can't keep them. Solid business model huh?"

the food is good but the main issue..... and I am a subscription holder and stock holder is. People be to tired to cook (like me myself) every day or even every other day! with grup hub and Postmates making it easier to just order while blue apron in fridge. I do cook my meals sometimes but the price of the box is still to high to be doing this much work. what needs to happen is we move over to fresh instant meals you can heat up!!! otherwise I don't see us lasting . only time will tell

"I commented yesterday on how this board seemed to lack pumpers and dumpers or paid posters. Apparently I didn't look deep enough. All opinions aside, here is what I see for what its worth. First, we have definitely dipped in the past week, but seemingly a bit too much. Those posting things that are little more than scare tactics about BK are just that... scare tactics. Even without any additional finding, APRN will last another 3 to 4 quarters. No one is going BK next week or down to 4 or 5 dollars anytime soon. We have been going down on low volume -- just showing that this stock doesn't take much to move it EITHER WAY. The slightest news has moved this $2 or more in a day. Someone made a respectful comment that COVID has not helped this stock. I respectfully disagree. It has increased demand for the product both in the sector and from APRN themselves. The reason APRN couldn't capitalize was simply because it was unexpected demand on the heels of closing one of their distribution plants. Directing my focus to APRN themselves as many times IR will actually look at boards to get a sense of where people stand. While I'm not one to believe in fake rumors of buyouts and all the rest, it seems getting your house in order with management and the board might be imparative. You have a fiduciaty responsibility to your shareholders -- and given your price movement, you are ripe for an activist to come along and help you attain the right value. It might be the right time to really look at customer feedback, pricing and your competition to determine why they are outperforming you. Given this pandemic and all the restaurants closing in local areas, your customer base is ever-increasing. And I would be fairly certain that your new class A shareholders don't want to see this price-point when they just paid $9.25/share.I mentioned yesterday that this stock is technically near a bottom -- but I've held stocks that went from $11 to $4 -- all while on a technical bottom. They all went back up... but technical bottoms can be little more than falling knives. I wouldn't use this as your guide. All that said, I do believe in this company long term and certainly through the fall and winter. Unfortunately I feel we are far from done with COVID.Good luck to those holding (and shorting)... we are all here to make money. I'm just on the long side of things. Be safe."
"There’s a very fundamental question that I think is being ignored by both sides here. Is APRN profitably acquiring customers today after truly factoring in all variable costs? If yes, this is 10x undervalued. If no, this company is bankrupt."
"Once this starts to gain momentum, $40 would just place APRN on par with MMM and that’s based on Q3 metrics - not APRNs strongest quarter (summer time - outdoor dining still open for a huge portion of the market). If earnings are solid, stock would move higher ($80). And if earnings are a monster, getting back in the IPO range is possible. Gonna be an interesting week for sure."
I appreciate all the bullish positive talk about this company. It definitely has an influx of new customers. The virus has given it a boost and an opportunity. However if they don’t learn from the past and keep customers then I’m afraid I’ll be short on this stock. I hope it flies to $40 a month from now. Make sure you see both sides however.
"424,863 shares to Shaw, what I don’t understand is class A common stock .0001 per value Are we now a penny stock at value?"
Still rumours floating around a buy out by a large grocery chain.
Billionaire David Shaw bought 5.2% of APRN yesterday. But hit pieces continue to come out that APRN is a short term play and after the crises they will go back to losing money. Are these writers saying that David Shaw didn’t know that??? Of course he did. If he bought 5.2% of the company he most likely spoke to management first to hear their turnaround plan and he invested in it. So any articles that come out now are speculative while David Shaw who just purchased 5.2% of the company most likely heard things form management that retail investors probably can’t hear by ourselves. I predict this stock to be up 50% by next month’s ER call.
"Let's add to this great news. The fact that Blue Apron's on-demand program in the bay area-- delivering it's meal kits on the same day ordered. And it's new market place on jet.com. Folks, with all these great news unraveling, I foresee Blue Apron being very profitable by the end of the year."
I'm still believe APRN will back up and fly up again today. With all the good news will attract lots of big investors
Yes!!!
Add more and don’t sale Great opportunity It will jump $$$$Longs >>>don’t sale

"I was positive and lost heavily for believing management spin. Brad talks well and tells a great story. But the reality is in Q2 story. their strategy with Airbnb and Costco did not work. they lost customers, topline and expanded a negative bottom line. this is unsustainable. the truth is even Costco could not save them and plug the decline. the bigger truth is customers have moved on. Brad and his team are standing on a burning bridge. they don't have time to experiment. they need to act and make bolder changes.

"written over and over that one problem with biz model is you can buy same ingredients cheaper at grocery stores. True if you have the recipe and know what to get.

I believe the premium meal kit options will have a significant impact to revenue. A perfect way to get those who love the service to spend more.

Smells like hedge fund
APRN is off O'Leary's radar. It wasn't even mentioned in his latest article about stocks that should outperform in 2019. The stock must be dead to him.
"Remarkable! Robinhood suspends buying of 3 of the 6 stocks that were listed in yesterday’s Investor Place article about companies that are heavily shorted. AMC, GME and KOSS.

Corona virus is not going to save an unprofitable business model. Who needs an expensive Blue Apron box when Fresh Direct delivers. The only reason this is staying up is that there is no borrow available to short.
"Would and should be a small 500 million BO, would make more sense for one of it's big names to buy the co then its mail kits !!!"
It’s slowly inching up everyday! Good sign something is cooking. No pun intended! Ha.

Do I dare say 12 before the weekend ?
worsse stock ever I owned took all my wealth
I'm a little bit more confident when there is so many negative sentiment around. I'm pretty sure I can sell this within a month for 30$ or more
"Video from early March (before COVID-19) but important to remember a strategic process is also being run right now. And the value of Blue Apron has never been more obvious than now. So earnings next week, and a strategic process update at some point.https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6138298754001/#sp=show-clips"
Sell now
Only question is whether she bounces at some point or heads straight back to 3 dollar range.
Now the media will fan the flames of fear. Should be good power hour.
Wow! I made some profit! Finally lol.
"I can't find the undo button, mine lost money, mulligan!"
Costco potential to buy APRN$15 and more
This business model makes zero sense. Grocery stores are still open and most than afford this ridiculously priced service have more than enough free time to go shop. The other half are basically unemployed and can’t afford this luxury.
nice! waiting for the sp to drop below 1$ and will get on board! coming soon!
I sure hope they advertise during the Bob's Burgers episode that will feature one of Blue Aprons Burger recipes 
"I am confused. Normally on a mass market red day, APRN goes UP! Today is it down 3 TIMES the SP500. A new normal for APRN?"
Just got back from grocery store no one knows who blue apron is they had carts full of food lol
"Earning time , hold on your shares This is stock market , it gets you to the point that you give up and then Surprise, $8.50+++2019 $13+You will see"
Don’t let shorts to paint the tape. Buy the dips if you have funds. This will recover back to double digits sooner than you think.
Possible drop to $4.5 before QR? Omg.
"not invested in the stock, don't think it will stand much of a chance against Amazon.BUT I find the arrogant and ignorance of some bashers laughable, the true value of Blue apron is not being lazy, but being able to try out & cook something new without going through mountains of trouble.If you're simply too lazy to shop or make food, you won't even use this since there are much cheaper and faster options out there. at least understand the value propersition of a company before you invest or trash talk it."
I think aprn should change to an instant noodle factory. it may make profit
Donde Esta Linda? Bueno News? Buyout or partnership coming....
I believe in you Blue Apron dont let me down next week

Perfect time to jump in
Great guidance and earnings will lead to short squeeze lasting three days just like before. Short if you dare. may hit 30.
Curious note... 1.1M shares traded in about 10 minutes with a company that has less than 18M shares outstanding and a price spike of about 50 cents. Interesting...
Acting much different today. If this holds 12 during the close / open. Watch out
Is the RS discussion based on something BA actually said or is it simply speculation as we stay below the $1 share price?
Our time will come. All the money from short movement will be used to help other stocks.

Debating whether to buy more. However i feel it then changes from investing to gambling with tomorrow’s ER.
"I'm increasingly less optimistic about this stock. It seems like a lose-lose situation with this stock. 1) If the economy stabilizes (which I doubt), this is a pig with lipstick. 2) If the economy continues to fall into may-aug, the unemployment numbers will be a significant headwind to APRN growth."

"Hate to be contrarian among so many optimistic people, but there's a reason this stock was near $2.00 on a downtrend.And before you get too excited about everyone staying home, people are still going to the store, and what we're seeing right now looks more like mania. Some people just have boring lives and want to feel like something is happening. It's a pandemic, it's not a type of virus wholly unfamiliar to modern science, and the public has begun to take precautions."

If you made some gains. Good. Get out now. This is going down massively. Look at CNN listing top meal kits today. No blue apron.https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/cnn-underscored/best-meal-delivery-service/index.html
outside of Thanksgiving this is the largest cooking holiday of the year and Blue Apron is obviously a food business huge Spike for business not to mention the pop-up shops the investor business and then of course Costco evaluating sales from this holiday weekend to help with their bid offerings. oh and Chrissy Teigen starting her recipes through June 4-6 weeks. get ready for a huge scale up

"who bought under $3 on Tuesday,holding all your shares,will be fun next week"
"70% chance that this will drop below 7,50$ today30% chance that this will drop below 7$ today"
"Customer numbers in 2020 (Q4 2019 to Q3 2020):Marley Spoon: 182k; 240k; 350k; 362k (+99%); Hellofresh: 2.97m, 4.1m, 4.2m, 5m (+68%)Blue Apron: 351k, 376k, 396k, 357k (+2%)+2% customers in the best possible scenario is awful. Q4 is even worse, just look at their google trends data.There is a reason why APRN is valued much lower than their market share. The pandemic gave them 1 extra year, but if 50% are vaccinated and cases drop because of higher temperatures than its game over."
"ceo news, aprn going down . great company"
wowow everyday down
Don't forget this stock went from $2 to almost $30 in a few days. That can happen again here on any positive news. Strategic process ongoing is most likely near term event. Another APRN CEO interview below.https://finance.yahoo.com/video/blue-apron-ceo-q1-earnings-214605095.html
"board and mgmt need to ensure there is cash to pey perks and salaries, china virus perfect cover, ""Separately, the company said it has filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $75 million in stock or debt"""
added on this dip
It pays off soon around $8
nothing like a fresh cup of steaming coffee in the morning and then see my position fall 30% you rock Blue Apron
"Yesss, almost all tradable APRN shares traded within the first 30 minutes. Yesterday, we had all shares traded within the first 20 minutes, but it's still an impressive amount today. Place reasonable profitable sell orders expiring far from now and never change those sell orders again."
"The challenge for Blue Apron is to overcome the Amazon's threat. The moment Amazon enter the meal kits business Blue Apron had been on the downward spiral and seemingly can't get out. However, the bright spot is Hello Fresh had shown us one can be profitable in this industry. Blue Apron needs to partner up with an upscale national supermarket chain with deep pocket. Easier said than done but that is why we pay big bucks to the CEO. Or maybe it can partner with Starbucks or any other upscale national chains. And it needs to step up its advertising budget and do more advertising. I bought a computer from HP and immediately I receive emails from Hello Fresh. Hello Fresh seems to be everywhere and Blue Apron is nowhere to be found. I get it Hello Fresh has deep pocket backer. There is merit to meals kit. I like homemade cuisine. I like the idea of enjoying my meals with a glass of red or white wine. After a hard of work, we can quickly whip up a delicious dinner with no mess and waste and couple with a glass of wine. You can't do that with fast food. So Blue Apron, please beg and sell yourself to Costco or BJ or whatever chains that are associate with upscale. Do not partner with Walmart. Whole Foods would be perfect but Amazon already bought it."
Speaking of social distancing....are people social distancing from this stock? Volume is non-existent.
Interesting....
"Eating blue apron tonight. The Food is good, it will go up. Now is the time to buy"
Two most important things is food and shelter away from coronavirus Blue Apron is the solution . Billion dollar market cap in the making 15-20x ROI return on investment from these levels in the cards. Lock your shares away we could see $20 by the end of the week.
anyone think the earnings tomorrow is already baked into the share price?
"Just to help out the confused on here, this goes to March 31. The social distancing guidelines were enacted on March 16th by trump. Today is April 29th. Thank you. The conference call will help to make others see this was a good ER. Yeah!"
Stay at home order issues by governor of California. Well guess who just ordered more blue apron :)))
why are people buying Jan calls? something cooking?
Congrats to APRN for giving startup valuation a bad reputation. Only people laughing are the 3 founders. From rags to riches even if they walk away with 10 millions for taking their lousy company IPO. They know well it was a scam from the beginning
Hey Shorts! ha.
"I spoke to a Costco employee off the record. He was hinting at nationwide roll out. This is not hard to believe considering the immense brand recognition if BA. Rolling out BA to 92 million members is huge. Even if 10% picks up 10 mealkits a quarter, that will be 92 million mealkits sold. At avg price of 20$, this will be a 1.8 billion/quarter."
"Some say there's been a short squeeze. When? The price spiked over four days of trading in mid-March. Some short-covering at that time? Perhaps. But according to Yahoo, the number of shorted shares INCREASED from the end of February to the end of March by .49 million (3.1 to 3.59 million shares). That would indicate the opposite of short-covering--the shorts dug in their heels by the end of March, betting against APRN even more vigorously because of the share-price appreciation. So where do we stand? The chart shows 1+ months of sideways price movement on declining volume, which is definitely not a sign of short-covering. But it does show that those who are long are staying long, those who are out are staying out, and the Bollinger bands continue to narrow. Short-covering will be seen when earnings and guidance are released next week. Stay tuned."
"When blue apron goes 100% vegan, their stock will hit $200 easy."
I bought some more today. Looks like it might be stabilizing. Plated was bought for 300 million. Someone could pick this up for for less.This is a quality name brand.
The stock seems to have been affected by a report casting doubts on their ability to keep up with demand. Someone has to provide them with all the different items that goes into their meals. It does not matter what the demand is if the supply cannot be met.
Who thinks this will end in green?
2nd halted 24.85 yyyyyyyyyyyy
BUY BUY BUY PEOPLE. $3 SOON
"Today and next week will be a bloodbath IMO, question is if this stock will drop as well. The fact that supermarkets are out of everything all the time is an advantage for APRN, however, will ppl choose the more expensive route of grocery shopping w APRN during these dire times??? bought @24 and crying over it everyday, wondering everyday if I should cut my loses and run"
earnings whisper predicts a huge revenue spike for Q2 and also profits. should easily double from here
"I was actually only expecting to break even today. This trades opposite the market now like some of the other Coronvirus stocks. When the market is up, they go down. Then when people read the news and see how bad it is, the Coronstocks go up and the market goes down. Thus I'm surprised this is up right now, even though I'm delighted. It just means that tomorrow, even if the market is red, and I expect it to be after 3 green days, this can still go up again tomorrow."
WTRH chart - pennant forming - $1.60's next leg up
"As of right now, a new customer will get there first order around the 10th of May. Demand high is good. I’m hoping they also recognize the opportunity of decreasing this gap between sign up and first order. This will help me decide if management has their head screwed on straight. Otherwise you are giving business to competitors"
"Check out the options contracts on this stock. It creeps up every day. Futures are more and more bullish. I think it will continue to rise with Covid case counts, and so do those buying options. Hopefully there was a wakeup call for this company to increase supply. Hang in there!"
"With the Amazon pounding APRN took, the stock is now poised well for a nice run up. Maybe we will see some unexpected positive surprises as well."

Why did it go down today
What are the rules for a stock trading this low on the nyse? Can they be delisted?
Blue Apron arrived. couldn't be any happier with this service. Also happy to be an investor. Smart Money knows this company is worth so much more. I'm holding long and will relish the next squeeze.
I love this stock
"Traders that bailed today will miss the ultimate Short Squeeze that will happen this week.There's a ton of shorts here, and if we can keep it green the margin calls are gonna force them to buy back the shares they borrowed, and we will most likely see $10.So stay strong, longs!!!"
There was a pump and dump but one fact is still holding - Blue Apron is hiring big!
WTRH solid gains... $aprn we should have sold at $28! PTI liking what I am seeing....
Wow never happened to me before but i just caught a falling knife barehand. Got in at 2.30 10k. It hurts and i just caught my breath thanks to the closed of market!
"Make it available at every transportation station,bus ,tain,subway,airport"
"Aprn would sell for minimum 6$. They still have money and depending on deal, other assets. They have time for a turn around. They believe it. Otherwise, they would have done it already."
I don't own this terrible stock but it is funny to go back 2 years and read the comments from that time. Many people had this pegged as a turd stock from the beginning!
What do you expect for the number of customers and revenue in Q4?
Patiently waiting for the breakouts and buyout
just bought at 2.87

One of my friends work for a large computer company and he got meals from Blue Apron. APRN will get many contracts from high tech companies very soon. Good luck for long hold folks!"
Anybody for a power hour Friday afternoon Squeeze. Yeah!
APRN is on the right track with new CEO. Buy more. With first profitable quarter a reality now institutions will flow in and start buying more. I see $30 easily before 3rd quarter.
I hope for those who are profitable had the opportunity to take some off understanding any stock going up at this rate would be going up faster than Bitcoin. leave thought for a correction. but plan for a future buyout
Even after weeks of not checking the convos Fer is still here writing every day. His puts must be losing value . He needs this to tank desperately

I think all weak hand have sold and all the slugishness is fully priced in. I think we now have a floor at $10 and we inch up from here. Very little time of Q1 had stay at home orders. All the strength will come in Q2 and forward. I'm adding at these prices.
i guess if earning is good it will be $2 end of week
Two major resistance levels ahead pf us. $12.50 then $15. Then I believe 52 week high will be tested pretty quickly.
"A short Squeeze is building up! Based on their sales and reasonable multiple, this should be a $3 Billion company conservatively, so 30X from here @ $180 per share!"

And with the coronavirus still raging and getting worse in many places, these are pretty safe plays."

Nobody wants to touch this stock.
good news
"Good afternoon. Looks like we have some relatively new posters that are continuing to post really good information, opinions and responses. A nice change from what I used to read --- the ""its going to be $1 by the end of the week"" and ""the world is ending!!! the world is ending!!!""To answer a couple of posters here, I do agree that this stock is a risk. I doubled down yesterday to 4K shares average price 6.55 having purchased to lots at 6.85 and now at 6.25. Earnings is coming out Thursday. I think we are well positioned for a spike as many others have suggested with Q3 being lowered to the point of not being able to miss. Yet even with that said and all this being opinion, clearly this is a risk.Looking at the recent changes including those on the board, I'd say they are making an effort to get this ship on the right path. Clearly COVID is not going anywhere anytime soon and this unfortunately provides a new market of customers for meal prep products. I would add that BOD changes and money infusions aside, Blue Apron needs to work on their reputation including product offerings and customer service. Regardless if they performed at all Q3 and have a solid plan going forward, I think it will cause a bump in the stock price. I don't see 7s as wishful thinking at this point especially when you consider the stock was almost twice this price not long ago. I do hope we can gain clarity on what dilution occurred in the last money raise as that was never clear to me.Good luck to those holding. I'd like to think this is more of a sure bet than betting football :)"

Hope next week back to 14$
"Let's not forget today is rebalancing day and the market will be flooded with big buys. Of course, Aprn should be at the top of many lists today! Already currently up over 5%. This should be interesting, to say the least. Yeah!"
"Motely Fool #2, no comment, again. PPS still should not be this low. The market is giving APRN an unfair multiple. TLRY, TSLA, BE and much more have crazy 100x(+) revenue multiple....Aprn is, what 1X estimate....valuation should be higher. If growth is sustained this quarter, I would be satisfied and so should the markets. Next quarter we should see if the brilliant minds that are employed at APRN is worth their salaries."

Will go back to 11 in no time ! It’s just a great buying opportunity
I don't really see this company ever becoming anything and after the pandemic is over the economy is going to be in a wreck less people will be buying as they get laid off their jobs. Right now remote workers are still keeping their jobs but that won't last as those business's lose customers and lay off as we head into recession. Who will have the money for high cost meal delivery that isn't even cooked.
Pandemic for 18 months is the estimation. Up we go

Just a quick one where do you guys set your stop loses when we are having a good rise but could easily have a pull back. I don’t want to be sold out for it just to be down to fluctuation/volatility. Any advice will be appreciated.
high volume
Good news for APRN investors! By now it should be apparent that you are holding the bag. It has nothing to do with shorts or stock manipulation. It is just sheer selling to save some money for this bow wow will only go down more. The good news is that Zappos has an offer for APRN longs to buy new shoes to go with their new bag. Use coupon code BLUE when checking out.

"The America i see isn""t signing up for Blue Apron ...their at there local Walmart's buying Pop-tarts and Slim Jim's for honkrin down the next few weeks...."
Massive pop coming
"All futures looking bright and green today(as I type this at least :) )! That could be what APRN needs to finally scare the short sellers and blast towards the moon. Even though APRN seems to do BETTER when all else is a sea of red. I still have my ""take profit/stop-loss"" on my short set at 9.25. (short from 12.26).Best of luck to all in the market today!"
"BTW< I recently watched Matthew B. Salzberg (previous CEO and now chairman) speak 2 years ago at the time of BA IPO. I was shocked that the strategy recently outlined by current CEM (Brad Dickerson) is the same as what Matt outlined. Basically, Brad was a puppet CEO. This is not shocking if you think Matt owns 50% of the company and is it's largest shareholder. It's unclear to me what changed! I am hoping Linda is brought in to thread a new path. Matt is dangerous to shareholders and hoping/praying Matt's strategy does not prevail."

"I would not short this stock nor attempt to chase the uptrend unless you can get in under $15. Once it soars past $15, step aside and watch. Do not chase it and do not attempt to short it. This stock is as wild as an annoyed bucking bull and you will get hurt playing around, period."
"We are going to $20.00 today., $$$$$$"
APRN is up 8.81% to 2.10
"Investing £100,000 today"
Why are people here suggesting tender offers for 700m$? Are you serious? Why would Hellofresh buy this nearly bankrupt company for 2x EV/Sales ratio? Even Hellofresh itself has a lower EV/Sales ratio.10$/share is the maximum price they can offer. Even this would be 1x EV/Sales which is quite high

"I've seen this party before on this exact same stock and the exact same thing happened. Huge spike up and then went right back down to set new lows. Guess what, it's going to happen again."
"Aprn should also ramp up in partnering with companies to include samples and ads. Physical endorsements in the box as they'd done once or twice to promote movies or new companies, products, should be one of the major sources of income as you'd only need to get these items from the partner companies and just figure out a way to plop them into the box. You have basically subscribers, not just users of your meal kits, that are targets, audiences for real, meaningful and direct advertising. I would also get serious about creating a subscription service that can sustain and grow an already solid base of loyal customers."
Let's get some company news. Work with gov't during this time of crisis!

"Few days ago, I wrote an observation on buys and sells. Large block buying, and many smaller volume on the sell side. This news with Jet, is probably not the news creating the large buying in the past week. I think Walmart will not let Costco get a one up on them. BA price at this level makes sense for WMT to shallow them whole. The risk factor to WMT at $3 is $500 mil., less BA cash and distribution facility. No brainer!Now before all you haters attack my post, just ask yourselves, how big is NYC, and don’t you think WMT can dublicate BA throughout the US over time?"
Oversold.
Mr Wonderful himself talked about how blue apron will have a massive run. GL
Back below $5 today! SELL ASAP!
Wow someone just bought 700k
"Positive free cash flowBlue Apron generated $3 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. That's a major milestone for a company that burned through $93 million in cash last year.The biggest contributor to Blue Apron's positive cash flow was its minimal capital expenditures. The company spent just $1.7 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, and it's committed to keeping that figure low throughout the year.It already spent hundreds of millions in getting its Linden facility up and running, and it's finally starting to bear fruit. Blue Apron's customer base is much smaller than the company had anticipated when it was building out its operations there, so it has plenty of capacity to fulfill orders.It's not clear Blue Apron will be able to maintain positive free cash flow throughout the full year, however, as the first quarter is seasonally strong, and the company seems to have cut costs as much as possible at this point.Healthy gross marginsBlue Apron's cost of goods sold totaled just 58.3% of revenue in the first quarter, a record low. CFO Tim Bensley pointed out that's a 20 percentage point improvement from six quarters ago when the company was struggling to fulfill orders on time and with the proper ingredients.""This is the result of continued improvements in all three of our fulfillment centers and further efficiency gains in labor, food, shipping, and packaging costs from enhanced planning and process-driven strategies,"" Bensley said during the company's first quarter earnings call.Blue Apron has room to improve its gross margin even more by expanding its product and distribution channels. In fact, Bensley announced plans to offer same-day on-demand service in the Bay Area in California for orders made directly from the Blue Apron website. Bensley said its capacity will enable the new offering to be margin neutral from the start with the potential to be margin accretive in the future.Increased orders per customerBlue Apron's 550,000 customers made an average of 4.5 orders each in the first quarter. That's up from 4.4 last year and 4.1 the year before (when it had nearly twice as many customers). That's strong evidence that Blue Apron is executing on its plan to attract only high affinity diners.Former CEO Brad Dickerson said increasing orders per customer will be one of the early indications the strategy is working. Blue Apron is a weekly service by default, so if every customer maxed out their subscription, Blue apron would see average orders per customer climb to nearly 13 per quarter (although that number is practically impossible to reach considering churn and new customers coming in mid-quarter). As such, there's still a lot of room for Blue Apron to improve the metric.Increased average order valueNot only are Blue Apron's customers coming back more often, they're spending more when they do. Average order values increased ever so slightly to $57.15. That's a 1% increase over last year and nearly flat compared with two years ago.Blue Apron can improve order values by offering cooking utensils and kitchen tools. Increased sales of those types of products should be accretive to gross margin since Blue Apron's brand strength allows it to price items like wine, skillets, and spatulas at very high markups. And the marginal shipping expense is practically nothing, since Blue Apron is sending a box to the customer anyway.An interesting trend in marketing mixBlue Apron has shifted its marketing spend to more digital advertising channels over the past year -- 78% of the company's marketing spend went to digital ads in the first quarter. That compares to just 46% in the first quarter last year.That's important, because digital ads are most capable of targeting the audiences Blue Apron finds produce the best customers. The big digital advertising services even offer lookalike targeting, which allows a company to upload a list of emails from its best users and target other users that exhibit similar characteristics.Previously, Blue Apron spent a lot of money on offline branded ads -- 43% of its budget went to offline advertising in the first quarter last year. That's down to just 9% last quarter. The shift in ad spend suits Blue Apron's goal of trying to serve everyone to only trying to serve customers it expects to keep coming back and using its products."

Ummmmm about 400M in revs this year and a 85M MC??? Looking pretty undervalued here IMO.
ok they are losing money .. but they had 800 M revenue in 2017 ..am I reading that correctly ???
"Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. 2018 Q3 - Results - Earnings Call Slides https://seekingalpha.com/article/4222224?source=ansh $APRN"
"Holding ""strong"" above $5.... well done APRN. I personally do not think that the vaccine news is something that will change anything in the near future - but stocks looks 12-18 months a head, so APRN better start performing NOW while lock downs Etc. is in force. Problem is; they already HAD their chance. This thing will go further down I fear."
"Growth initiatives. $8+Blue Apron (APR) is currently focusing on improving its product portfolio and has introduced its retail and on-demand offerings to improve its top line. In the second quarter, it hosted pop-up shops called Unboxed in locations such as New York City and Minneapolis to raise brand awareness.Building on its retail partnership with Costco, Blue Apron’s meal kits are now available in 80 Costco retail locations. Blue Apron expects that with this retail expansion, the brand could gain more visibility and possibly boost its subscription service.Blue Apron also launched a summer grilling box and special-occasion meals for consumers on its D2C (direct-to-consumer) platform. To take advantage of the back-to-school season, the company is working on recipes that aren’t time-consuming. In the fall, Blue Apron is working on launching Whole30-based recipes.Blue Apron has gained access to three recipes from the animated TV program Bob’s Burgers by inking an agreement with 20th Century Fox."
NO SELLING NO SHORTING TODAY.
Shorts have come out the woodworks! Guess they must be feeling the pain today. You can't win them all shorts. At least in my opinion. So glad I invested after I saw all my grocery stores empty in my location.
"If this is anywhere under $8 after earnings, I reckon I'll buy about 5,000 shares"
"What's next from here. That's the question a short should be asking themselves. We now have the 1Q20 results in, and they had basically no impact from COVID-19 (HelloFresh is in different geographies so not a proxy). So next up is 2Q20 and beyond. So let's see here. In 2Q20 we know that APRN guided to $130MM (analyst at $118MM), which is the first quarter of year-over-year growth since APRN went public. That's a big deal since now we have a growing consumer tech company that generates positive cash flow (run those comps on a P/S multiple!). Then there is also the wild card of a strategic review process being run by the top investment bank, Centerview Partners (look at their website of transactions). Basically as a long you are now waiting for multiple positive catalysts whereas the shorts have a minefield ahead (take your victory on 1Q20, you did well congrats... find another company now)."
Just got in at $6.75
"How can yahoo finance show the stock at down a minus 3.7 and loosing -20% when it opened at around 25 and is now at 12. Looks like a 50% loss to me. I am not a stock garu, but what am i missing."
"Big jump ,$$$, Over $8.50 buy out"
"Still, minuscule volume for a company the size of APRN, only $2 million traded today. Easy near 50% gain from here."
This is going to make a huge run after pre market gap up
This is a gem. For those who bought above $20 sit tight it will go back up. I bought at $13.89. I held it when it went down to $10. Just be patient it will be good to you
Who's taking profits so early? Didn't they see yesterday?
Another great news just came out. APRN is hiring more staffs for their demand products. This will push APRN up to 30.00-40.00 tomorrow
"APRN congrats to all that bought sub $9.75! Eyes on ACRX up 80% since March 23rd, potential SHORT squeeze in the making... Stay At Home portfolio includes $NFLX $WTRH"
Earnings are 1 1/2 months away. If the partnerships with WW are working this stock is going to $5. The partnerships are important in this space. Connecting With Fitbit and WW is connecting with people who are dedicated to getting healthy and losing weight. Bringing in Blue Apron is a perfect fit.
Ok. 400 shares at 5.14 I’m in.
"The company said during its conference call it expects third quarter revenue of $150.0 million to $160.0 million. The current consensus revenue estimate is $206.6 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2018."
That this is holding on to 98% of yesterday's gains is very encouraging.
"“Expanding its core offering “should help [Blue Apron] achieve customer and revenue growth in 2020,” SunTrust said. Analysts think Blue Apron could be a potential acquisition because of its strong brand and prior acquisitions in the meal kit space, which includes Albertson’s purchase of Plated for about $200 million and Kroger Co.’s KR, +3.01% purchase of Home Chef for about $200 million plus possible $500 million in incentives.”"
bought more at $1.12
short sellercreate a panic environment
Edith still thinks the earnings report and outlook was good hahahahaha
$1.90 is not cheap
"I don't know who hires this financial analysts and commentators. This company is its best shape ever. It achieved EBITDA of 8 million last quarter. It has started its on demand service where the customers get their meal kits the same day they're ordered with no commitment to subscription --and according to the CFO they are doing it at a profit.They are building they own market place just like Etsy and now are selling their spices and cooking essentials on Jet.com. So the company is branching out to other business opportunities. Although Matt, Tim, and Linda have not being involved with Wall Street that much, I think they are doing a phenomenal job in getting this story told to the investment community. Next up--blow up earnings on August 6, then the Investment conference on the 7th. APRN to the moon."
Go go go
Did anyone watch fox News this evening . They mentioned blue apron replacing the food stamps
What will today Bring for APRN? 
"APRN continues to lose money with every transaction, numbers on customer base would have been much worst if it wasn't for that, APRN is done!"
"APRNInvestors should look into the charts, the ups and downs and sides moves are totally normal !!!!If you look at the other sectors, they all have almost the same moves!!Hold on your shares, and trust your investment. The only way that shorts win is when Longs give in and sell cheap! April $3++$8 mid year Target , over $13 this year Hold on your shares"
"Frankly, buy while this is on a great discount. This won’t last kong."
Even a paltry one times revenue makes this a $500 million market cap.
"NEC cheerleading wont help, hes hoping to flip losses bought back in march above $20, ahahahahahaqhah"
Price target 4 dollars
"Let's wait for the call and cross fingers, maybe we have good news from analyst and an upgrade, the reality is that they are growing y/y and they are in a better position than a year ago with the same price, lockdowns are going to happen again. For me there are good news, but Q4 guidance is not taking into account COVID19 and lockdowns.Good luck guys!"
100$ by Friday .
A lot of buying today?
"Just saw Walmart meals on line. Boring same thing for 2 meals, confusing. No details like Aprn. Plus only about $10 less than Aprn for 4 full meals. Does not look appealing at all. not a threat to Aprn."

Biggest meal kit news at least for me was MMMs 30% drop yesterday after announcing a huge capital raise on top of Friday’s positive ER.
"Shorts are panic covering? That first huge bump to 9% could have been a single large player getting out of the position, and then others could be following because of momentum."
95 percent drop from IPO price. is there any light at the end of this tunnel..asking for a friend

I am going to order food today instead of going super market during current situation.Hopefully I have a great experience for the purchase and buy this stock in near future.
"Logic: 2/3 of all tradable APRN shares have now traded, increase your sale price a bit, strong longs, if you haven't placed sell orders already."
"Longs; don’t panic, hang onto your shares, Set your price for all time high, it will force the shorts not to be able to borrow! By earning will catch $7-$8 + and keeps going up to pass the all time high"
"6% in pre market, good luck to those who panicked and sold yesterday."

Halted in sell off
$10.50 please. The deal making is behind scene. How come people are not getting excited about the deals?
"a few thoughts Robinhood provides order flow (real-time customer orders) to high-frequency trader Citadel in exchange for 17 cents per 100 shares traded. As a result, Robinhood's revenue thus comes from the high-frequency trader Citadel. (Because conflicts of interest are obvious, Robinhood did not disclose this for a long time and also otherwise violated FINRA rules on the best execution principle, which led to a criminal investigation by the SEC).Citadel not only works with Robinhood, but also with Melvin Capital. Now Citadel and Point72 (a hedge fund registered on the Caribbean island of Anguilla) jumped in with a combined $2.75 billion and got non-controlling stakes in Melvin.Needless to say, it makes little sense for Citadel to support Melvin with $2 billion while paying Robinhood commissions on stock purchases that rival Melvin's efforts to reduce loss-making outsized short positions. As a result, Robinhood stopped executing buy orders on a whole range of stocks. The excuse in the media was that Robinhood put these restrictions in place in the interest of dumb customers who couldn't handle their money. It also fits that the customers who bought shares against Melvin and got this hedge fund into the biggest trouble were dismissed as incompetent beginners.Soon there will be tears. One is surprised that serious brokers - such as Degiro - did not have to issue such bans on buying.And one is amazed that the newspaper writers overlook the fact that the alleged fools only had to drive the price up so far that Melvin had to buy on a large scale and thus drive the prices themselves up further - short squeeze.(No, one is not amazed after all, because all the mistakes all boil down to the same thing: the systematic justification of short sellers).Although naked short selling is prohibited, last Friday GME's short positions still accounted for 121% of the available shares. To this, too, local media served up excuses that this was not the fault of the short sellers.And what does this have to do with Moderna mentioned at the beginning? Some time ago, one could read in the same media that Biontech and Moderna were quasi one-day flies, which would have considerable revenues in 2021, but which would dry up when the Corona pandemic subsided.The current share prices are inflated. However, the fact that the mRNA technology can be used in a much broader range of applications and that the biotech companies mentioned have the greatest opportunities to apply their technology in other areas thanks to the huge revenues was completely disregarded.The share prices of Biontech and Moderna stagnated and declined after these one-sided media reports. Then Melvin floundered. Then Citadel had to step in. Then Melvin had money again to buy stock and prices went up. Then Citadel-funded Robinhood announced that its clientele could only buy 1 Moderna share each, but sell as many as they wanted.The list of companies from which Robinhood clients are allowed to buy only a few shares is long. Moderna is also on it, and it's certainly not a company in financial trouble. The excuse with reference to GameStop proves to be what it is.#saveblueapron"
$5 mark is very important for APRN hope it will come soon.
buy out announcement at investor conference
"what everyone is missing that the multi billion dollar opportunity is to bring new customers and revenue stream, billion dollar revenue stream."
market cap 120 million. cheap here imo given the situation the country is in. worth a risk under 12 imo
"If I were a betting man, I'd say we might finish green."
"After Earning, expect $8+"
Upgrades are coming! Small cap funds here they come! Oprah! Oprah!
"Buy, don’t sell!"
LOL praying for an acquisition
here is how to save 25 million a year fire entire board and CEO and have the workers that pack the food in boxes run the company they would actually do a better job ! Tell me how any one on the board is worth more than 30k a year
Any news on why APRN is up this much today?
"Adamm,, we get it. You likely have a few shares of BApron and want the price to hedge up to cover your losses; however, one trumpet does not make a band. Just one person posting the same thing over and over won't affect the stock prices at all, especially when the posts appear to be made by someone desperate to get back even. Lighten up, take a break from the boards. A watched pot never boils.."
"Maybe I’m wrong but I don’t see why this stock wouldn’t be trading around $30. It’s a popular company, maybe to some it appeals to a more richer crowd but people are buying...I don’t see any complaints about the food itself but more about the stock being low or N/A. I figured with the 300 more employees it should get fixed."
4000 more shares today! Away we go........GLTA
"MUTE ALL SHORTS, BASHERS AND PAID TROLLS! PLACE MAX AMOUNT LIMIT SELL ORDERS TO KEEP SHORTS FROM BORROWING YOUR SHARES....then sit back, be patient and relax."
Are we halted again ????
HOLD!! Only 6.7 Million Shares After the Split AND they will come up with BIG news right after that so it will become a SHORT SELLING TRAP!! Think about it... how many times have we seen a split when EVERYONE expects a Huge drop and then BAM! news to spike it higher with soooo many fewer shares?? Guess what the stock would do then????
just to give you perspective if the share price went to 45 ( which would be a miracle akin to Red Sea Parting) so if it went to 45 it would be trading for 3 dollars still 70% of IPO price of 11
momo
This thing has had so many dead cat bounces I wouldn't be surprised if they add dead cat to their menu !
Loading up this morning
did you guys ever get in at $0.50?
closing @ very lowest of the day is not bullish sign
I am in at $6 not going anywhere
"if Buffett takes a hit with of over 19B with apple, I'm sure I will be okay with just a few couple dollars less since yesterday"

17 up in Premarket Niiiiiice
Put a sell order and lock your shares. This way investors cannot borrow them to short.
35% SHORT. OMG. Is this the next GME?
I decided to get some shares once more and will be holding. No better thing than to put the money where the mouth is and this thread could use a bit of prepping similar to the meal kits. Aprn has done this so many times and every trade with this company has been profitable for me. The price is at bargain levels and I was waiting to buy in finally did today. I will continue to collect shares as it rises back to the 9's then 10's then eventually teens again. Linda did a great interview and covered all the points in text book manor. A similar situation of shares tumbling because of dilution happened with Dennys and its now starting to rebound and these two stocks trade very similar and both are way below what the value is. Glad to be back on one of my favorite stocks. # lets go team blue !!
let's go to 10.50
"Bitcoin, APRN, beanie babies....take your pick....LOL"
heard Amazon buying blue apron gave offer $6. share
Time to Rinse Yesterday... today we will buy back in now and Blast off once more... Walmart shutting stores we will be the only ones to call..
BUYOUT OR BUST
Buy out ++++$$$$
4.17 keeping it up till 5
Looks like a nicely formed cup and handle. I am on the $4 belief group. Since Plated sold out for $300 mil I’m believing we’re not long for a buy out here
Short squeeZe...All aboard
"Most upbeat earnings call in a long time. Like I said elsewhere, this type of operation doesn’t turn on a dime. Clearly on the right track now."
"APRN share holders, expect a huge upside very soon, APRN $ 13+ $$$"
Just to confirm this is not a buy @ these low levels right?
Deal with it again today red zone like minimum .50 down today
Nice bounce! So far looks like 2.90-3.00 is support.
Drop due to amazons plan of big acquisitions and expansion being worked on for 2020. Read the news. I am waiting for this stock to drop to 30 cents then buy and wait till a possible acquisition becomes real by some player. Right now there is no good news for apron only issues being done against them. They need more capital and expansion customer base.
Squeeze em above 15$
After Hours up for Aprn! Ding Ding!
Just like to break even tomorrow so I can bail out of this dog
nice action :) enjoy the wknd!
I came real close to bailing on this POS @ $7.00 How in the world it got here has to be a massive sqeeze
NICE TRY SHORTS! Just bought another 10k shares. Thanks for the opportunity
"I believe we see $10-11's by Friday, if there isn't more to the momentum buildup behind the past two trading sessions' rallies. They seem adamant keeping it comfortably above $15 right now. It is more than remotely possible that there is a secondary offering coming, priced at the earlier mentioned numbers ($10-11), or 'leaked' news of a partnership, to further extend this euphoria, may be forthcoming."
Price target is 4 bucks
13-15 tomorrow
My guess is a year from now people will probably be back to their old ways but in the coming two quarters the numbers will be good and the stock will soar.
It will close around 18-20
Longs panicked and sold. That's why the stock went down so much today. Panicking is not a strategy. Hope some investors will come in at this cheap price.
line are down the block for markets lots of people at the market not the safest place to be APRN will double or triple from this level
BlueApron restaurants in near future? possibility?
3.60 today?
Here we go! Yeah!
"That dip yesterday was with low volume (for<1.15), not a real thing, it should bounce back easly to 1.15 and maybe to 1.5!"
Sell it when it’s 3.74
WoW ... am i seeing green ... ?
"APRN Number one meal kit in all of USA IN 2015 , 2016 , 2017 went public most executives either left or resigned all became millionaires and everyone quit working ...... now barely hanging on by thread leaving long shareholders holding the bag over 1 million subscribers at peak now to less than 400k thanks Blue Apron you are the best"

lol so they are buying a precooked veggie burger and plating it on a bun.....wow where do i sign up for that meal service
Who will want to acquires this company and move it?
"Here is the truth about APRN..and I've emailed corporate several times but no one will listen. I can make APRN turnaround if they would just listen to my business model.Reality is APRN is less expensive than eating out, yet more expensive than going out an buying groceries. APRN is trapped in between and sadly it shouldn't be. APRN needs its service to create a more personalized UNIQUE experience that will guarantee customer retention and increased profit. Steps for APRN to succeed:1. Lower prices by up to 7% 2. Loyality discount program 3. Celeb/athlete ""favorite meals"" and endoresemt (contracts to not exceed initial 50k and 4% royality). 4. Themed dinners ie ""taco Tuesday"" with higher end options.5. Offer prepackaged breakfast/lunch options. These are cheaper to produce per meal and will generate more profit because these meals are normally faster and on the go.6. Offer party/bbq/get together portions of easy to prepare meals. 7. Expandes partnerships with larger retailers (not exclusive). 8. Offer specialized specific meal for weight loss, diabetes, gluten free, vegetarian, vegan. They follow this guideline and they will surely succeed!"
NOT FOR SALE
Wow what a complete disaster. Glad I own no shares 
sell the company on e bay for 4 dollars what a disaster of a company
Did some news just drop? Welcomed second bounce!
"Low volume pull backs, completely normal, wait for the boom :)"
Not a good quarter but this is too much. Time to start nibbling at these prices.
4.00 plus today 
Tick Tock Tick Tock.Time running out. Announce a buyer please.
So I noticed the WW menu is gone.
"AMD was close to bankruptcy to once and they turned it around. Why can't APRN do the same? No one really wanted a delivery of food but now times have changed and in my opinion, delivery is what most people are looking for. This crazy health/life change has ruined some companies and changed the destiny of others. Just my opinion."
"Before Dave/Nope clog this thread, check out MMM and HFG. "
Reason #1 why APRN is down: Management needs to come on the media and support the shares. All we hear is depressing news about lower sales. How about they come out and present a story with a happy ending. They don't need to tell the truth. Just say something to get the price up.
"cannot make money during pandemic, how will aprn do it after pandemic?"
will c 8 after closing bell
At one point I thought the new CEO would save this company Nope no one can save the car wreck of a company 2 companies hello fresh / blue Apron both sell meal kits one makes money and is well run the other one projected 18 million loss I picked the wrong meal kit to invest in one company is up 100 % the other down 97% absolutely dumbfounded over how poorly this company has been run since IPO
Waiting for the drop below $1. It's coming
The traditional grocery final end pop is def evolving.
"Oh my, I have to buy 100 shares just to keep the wife happy and involved with my trading. I turned down the IPO and bought EKSO, mistake. She wanted to know that I bought some of ""Her"" favorite company. I showed her EKSO and how good it did Friday, no luck. I will be buying Monday so she can root for her home team. I guess if it helps keep her interested in the market it will be worth it. She is the reason I still hold a large % of NTDOY. She has been right on that one and always ask if I have sold any. Happy wife happy trader...lolso count me in Monday, I guess women really like this company."
"Hellofresh said today, that revenue in Q2 surged by 122%! and operating margin at 15,4%. They also raised outlook for 2020."
shorts will begin to cover soon
Easy 10 bagger
what is a good re entry price?
Read the Zack Research! $8.50 today!
"The food is good, although the range of portions they offer does not work for anyone with children, or people living alone."
3-Small Pre-Market transactions to try to prop up the price before opening and make folks think it is going up today. I would be on it making a new 52-week low today.
"What a press release. forward Guidance is a joke. "" We won't lose more than 18 million next quarter"". They should be ashamed for releasing that PR"
There are 8 Million shares 4 million short this could break the 52 week high of $18.00 today The volume and the chart says $20.00+ This week! Lock up your shares for real profits this could hit $50.00 in the next couple of months $60 million market cap that has Billion dollar plus potential
Please back to 14
This is even not $1 presplit. If pandemic hit while this was at $2 we would easily see double digits. Do your math. This will be triple digits soon.
Timberrrrrhello bagholders Im a shorty and I'm making money. target price $6
Albertsons dropping out will be good for APRN. APRN is focused on high quality meals for people who like to cook. This is a vastly different market from people shopping at grocery stores buying prepared meal kits. APRN meals include small portions of niche ingredients. I like that because I don’t want to buy 16 ounces of Mars Capone when the meal only requires 1.5. Albertsons - and other grocery chains- will not be repackaging the way APRN does.
"Algo trading and pumpers get giddy, smh"
Blue Apron is down 13.74% to 9.10
C’mon $7.
I must be the only one here that bought and sold on ipo day. I do not think this stock will survive due to number of people trying Service only to drop it later. bashing a stock gets me nowhere or pumping does nothing for me like it used to do for my ego. I like investors to be rewarded on their investments but this is not the stock at this time
I bought in this morning at .95 and now I’m enjoying the positive momentum here after lunch.

And now the more positive stories are hitting the wires from the critics... Some had negative views a few days ago that seemed to have turned in a more upbeat direction. I would think the shorts are not going to like what they are going to see over the next few months..... Day traders will probably love it...

"Markets go up, aprn goes down. Markets go down, aprn goes down. Markets recover, aprn goes down.APRN IS THE BEST SHORT!"
maybe we could do another reverse split at 1to 20 this time so CEO and Board so they can sell at a higher price it seems the only way to get stock price is reverse splits not by actually beating earnings or making a profit once in while SCAM CENTRAL
Do self a favor don’t buy the stock just buy aug options. Limited down side. This could hit 20 by earnings call. If any good news it’s worth 28. A market cap of 300 billion. A lot smaller less know company’s pull that in buy outs.
tech chart says $3s next week!
When the market opens this will be $10.00
Luv in an elevator going up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy buy buy
Good luck to Blue Apron in 2021 !! Try to finally make a profit and try to consistently beat earnings with positive guidance maybe the stock will get back to 28 of March 2020
1 month will find out if my investment will stay in the green after/during earnings report on August 2. I hope share price keep climbing on positive news/report.
"No decisive volume on this stock in either direction for the past few days. It looks like the market doesn't know what to make of it. Even if supply chain is steady and customers are satisfied throughout the pandemic, this company faces significant headwinds and risks of every flavour on an ongoing basis: immediate term deflation, medium term inflation, shutdown due to health concerns, dilution of share price, and more. Their profit margins are negative and they're short on credit. Another sell off will take the price back to below $2."
This stock has a lot of momentum going for it over the past month. Expect solid earnings
Just bumped into interview of new APRN CEO on CNBC from 7 months ago talking about how she plans on turning the company around. Investing into companies is investing into management and she exudes competence and relevant experience. Add the recent pandemic on top of the turnaround plan and this is a home run. I expect next month’s ER call to be very exciting with huge beats and raises!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq755fIZwAA
Strong buy rated by so many analysts and Zacks Year target $8+
"Shorts are afraid ,gme. So,1 this Time aprn has a fair chance"
stay there till double digit by the closing bell.
"Big volume and a good run today on no news . The short squeeze is for sure the main cause of this.I have Been short from $12.26. Covered half around $6 (it went all the way to the $4s so I did not get that perfect ). On the other half had a ""stop-loss""(take profit) cover price at $9.25, which got triggered where I covered the rest. So I earned 50%+ on the first half, and 25% on the 2nd lot. Not bad .I will now follow this stock a few days - to see if this was a one time wonder. There ARE qtrly reporting coming soon, so maybe some insiders knows some positive news, causing this run? We will see!"
Well it looks like there are no more shares to short. It goes down due to sellers??! Why would anyone sell at this level??!
Just added more
"My prediction: sideways today. Tomorrow, numbers might be a small surprise for the current Q, but guidance will be strong. Stock will try to move up but will be met by short selling pressure. It all comes down to how the market feels about the guidance. It is becoming clear that reopening is underway - but it isn't clear if that will in turn lead to additional spikes in deaths and further quarantining. Also, the food chain is under pressure with widely reported dumping of produce and stoppages of meat production. An important part of the Q&A will have to be around APRN's ability to continue to source food. My guess on that: it's a win for APRN b/c all these producers will be desperate for someone to take their product resulting in lower overall costs. APRN is a buyer right now and they're in short supply. The conviction by longs and the strength of the story will determine"
"That I’d hold this a couple days, a couple month ago, guess I’m here for the long hall"
"Holy moly, now it is down 18 cents on the day? I was OK with 6-7 cents per day. But now the downturn seems to be accelerating. Is my perception of this company wrong? My broker said APRN is a for-shyt company. Maybe he is right. Technical trading is always right so I am going to hang on for the blast off to $6.00."
Broke under support. What else is new.
"I don't understand how some people think it will go back to 8$. the reality is that there is no growth. loss in subscription, loss in revenues and the only thing doubling is loss. Costco or Amazon don't want to buy such a company. people would think Costco will buy them, should buy Costco instead. seriously!!!"
"TOday is a good example of what APRN can do due to a large short squeeze. Markets down, and no (good) news from APRN but the stock jumps well, maybe based on the pandemic worsening? Only problem is that they did NOT manage to earn money even during the worst of the FIRST wave and lockdowns. Will they do better this time around? The bad and constantly changing management and board members, running low on cash flow AND the terrible investor communication does NOT leave me bullish on this puppy. Cheers!"
Sorry for those who shorted...
All we need now is the buyout price for an epic short squeeze.
I think it goes up one day but until the better entry point I chose wtrh
No joke. Great products. Our family subscribes to 6 entrees a week - 3 for dinner and 3 lunches at work. The food is great. Plenty of good healthy food that curbs the appetite. And keeps us from buying the junk fillers at the market. If this company can boost users and continue with improved marketing results it should always be viable in the meal kit space with its superior quality.
"My estimate is that the buyer of APRN will be paying $500 per customer (over 300,000 customers) and will get who knows how much more value in potential through former customers and years of APRN marketing."
Should test all time lows once this dips into the $6s. No growth drivers. Cutting Marketing saves some cash but limits exposure to new customers which BA desperately needs. Hello Fresh has cash/credit to outlast BA. Yikes! Not looking good.
short the stock if you lost money with apron maybe you can get some back.
Y'll see that Linda sells 20-30K shares every three months? Lol. Sell them while they have some value!
don't sink the shipbuy the dip
This stock is bullish short term. Momentum is on its side. And sometimes it’s hard to go against it. Either way everything is just speculation with these meal delivery kits. Until they release sales numbers nobody actually knows what’s gonna happen. Don’t be surprise if this goes up another 100% or go down. Either way its high risk high reward. In general this company is actually doing really bad. But stocks are all about speculation and if someone is manipulating for this to go up it will go up. Remember the big players control the market. Not us small investors. Anyways happy trading. And to those who make money like us let’s just hope this ride doesn’t stop. But if it does then its been a hell of a ride.
Great buy under 1.34$ loaded up Gun with 50 thousand share Monday is very important will open 2$
"This company rise again , just need sometime long hold"
"This is how I am seeing the situation. A $75 stock trading at $10 a share. That is why I have loaded up 30K shares past year and holding. That is how you make money, that is how you get rich."
Press release coming!!!
Don’t know what say other than it better grow and grow to really believe it’s a company here to stay not just a frat idea but failed execution
What’s your thought about tomorrow’s earning call? Will it be a good q? And will the stock rise?
"hello fresh trades for 54 dollars blue apron after adjusted 1 to 15 reverse split for ,50 cent wow great job just keep the free granted shares coming for new board members and CEO"
"As more states go under lockdown APRN and WTRH will come into play in a major way. Regardless of what shorts or paid bashers say. They just show up to make amateur investors panic and sell. Notice how they cant stand longs but never mute anyone? Because they need someone to listen to them. Mute them, set max amount limit orders on your shares to keep shorts from borrowing them, be patient and relax. (shrugs)"
Has anybody heard that Amazon is looking to purchase Blue Apron?
anyone playing the short better be careful blue apron could easily eat your lunch!
"If it holds, I’ll be loading up next week."
The word is that APRN is going to explode by next earnings date-16.02.Get ready for 30+
Feeling bullish as the prospect of a buyout
"LOL how do you lose customers during stay at home Covid only Blue Apron what did all the new over paid board members do ? nada . what a joke of a company they will keep collecting huge paychecks and granted share til they go BK Matt salsberg sells 100,000 shares at 10 a week before earnings ... I was right about food kits just invested in wrong company should have a put the same money in hello fresh . APRN 2017 IPO 11 to a reverse split 1 to 15 in 1 year never been done quarter after quarter of bad earnings last quarter they missed earnings because of onion recall and couldn’t fill the orders because of labor issues it’s laughable Never should have gone public !! Disgraceful it’s just a gravy train of free granted shares for CEO board members"
Prediction. Slow down in price has plateaued. Slow melt up next 2 weeks till earnings.
Buy more. Best food and best company.
Sold off my position as it’s a dead stock now. Holding them from $4 and averaging down doesn’t really help. Did she their products at Costco where Untouched by any. GLTA
Lots of insider share purchases last week. That's a good sign. 10% of green house gas emissions are from agricultureMeal kits reduce food waste by 62%APRN meal kits have a 33% smaller carbon footprint than grocery meals.

Bounced off 7.02 today. $6 range is going to be tested this week IMO

up 15% AH...bad management gone talented new management in...this is ready for a little run up...bout time get in now....great potential
Bought some as a trade. Insiders not selling heavy. Acquiring more than disposing of. Wil sell after earnings no matter which way it goes.
Bastian don’t you have better things to do that your bearish side on yahoo message boards. We all know you don’t like APRN and want hello fresh. I think it is funny you are still here.
It's heading to 5.
"Am I the only one who realises this is trading at an enormous discount given EV/Rev of ~0.4?The company are bringing in its entire market cap in revenue almost every quarter. The companies core operation is profitable given gross margin sits at around 25%. Additionally, OPEX is relatively static. With the foresight that the business will continue to scale, I see them shortly posting a positive bottom line. This could deliver huge yield to shareholders who are sitting in this stock at a ridiculously low level. Additionally, with the amount of short interest, I’m sure the move up upon this realisation will be vertical. I would thoroughly enjoy a bear explaining the rational as to why they are short."

I've been in APRN since 4/24 and I'm slightly ahead. If they can't pop after this earnings report then I may have to say adios to Apron.

@J -- wondering if you're one of the MIB. Or are you so busy your name can only be a single letter. Seems the pendulum has swung way too far left on this one and might be coming back to center. And may I add that you only seem upset that the stock is rising -- we all have our day buddy.To everyone else -- any idea on what's driving up the price other than the fact it should have never been that low to begin with? I'm not seeing news anywhere and earnings aren't for 7-8 weeks.Also someone made mention that the 4M share offering was completed. I'm not seeing anything providing concrete numbers on how that turned out. Would love a link if anyone has it.Thanks and looking for 8s soon (fingers crossed).

"Hi everyone, if I’m not mistaken the SEC “short” rule is in effect today on APRN because yesterday APRN had more than a 10% drop. This means that shorts are restricted and can’t short APRN today. So feel free to buy away today…"

"The latest quotes from Dave - 5 days ago: Will never get above 5.70 again. (Wrong)2 days ago: Down big tomorrow for sure. (Wrong)@Dave, Can you stop filling this board with your tea-leave-reading-nonsense? Nobody cares about short term movement predictions. Try posting something of substance. Teach me something new."
What a disappointment.
"I guess Big Money has a plan to keep it as low as possible as they can maybe even at below $1 up to the earnings report next week. after that they will move it back to $4 a share.As you look at the price pressure, as soon as it goes couple of cents up, they crush it down.What you guys think?"

I haven't read the term sheet for that debt extensively, but I am skeptical that they are not able to replace the retired debt with new debt. Why do they think they'd be able to raise debt in their strategic review?With closing of TX (another $1.5mm in restructuring costs), these meals are going to become more expensive for certain customers. I'd expect to see more customer loss going forward.Disclaimer: I've had puts on this since $7 and change."
"Made one round trip from $3.70 to $16.00 and been watching Apron's moves as a customer. I'm getting the meals I ordered, with no loss of ingredient quality, on time! Back in this morning.

"APRN Call Options Pop on Beyond Meat BuzzMeal kit delivery service Blue Apron Holdings Inc (NYSE:APRN) announced that it will be rolling out a new vegetarian option in August, featuring Beyond Meat's (BYND) plant-based burgers. APRN stock is up 17% to trade at $8.97 in response -- on course for its best day since January -- and Blue Apron call options are flying off the shelves. On the charts, the equity is making a comeback after hitting a record low of $6.11 late last month. Since then, APRN has tacked on 47%, and is set to close above its 40-day moving average for the first time since early May. Nevertheless, the shares remain 40% lower on a year-to-date basis.Considering its recent behavior, it's not surprising that analysts have remained cautious on APRN, with six ""hold"" ratings across the board. This could leave the door open for some upgrades, should APRN continue its recent upward trajectory.Short interest, on the other hand, has taken a dramatic nosedive, down 87.8% in the last two reporting periods. Despite the recent exodus, the 1.77 million shares sold short still represent a solid 5.9% of the stock's available float. What's more, it would take almost seven days to cover all these pessimistic positions, at APRN's average pace of trading. As alluded to earlier, today's Blue Apron surge has call volume running hot. APRN has seen more than 2,600 calls cross the tape in the first hour of trading -- 45 times the average intraday pace. For comparison, fewer than 600 APRN puts have traded. Most active are the July 9 and 9.50 calls, where buy-to-open action is detected. By purchasing the calls to open, the buyers expect APRN shares to muscle north of the strikes by the close on Friday, when front-month options expire.https://stocksheadline.com/w8z52"

This should already be trading above $4 now if they have never taken a reverse split. Management should reveal their plans to split it back to build confidence.
"and lets not forget the 1:15 reverse split , so you cannot be at $75 a share value so quickly, unless Buffett has bought you."
idk Id say its poised for a comeback to somewhere in the 20 dollar range in a year. they seem to have stopped the bleeding and have some good deals in place and are under smarter leadership than when this hole was dug
Watch how management will come with a PR to move this above $9.25 to make offering price work.

"Anyone thats been holding shares will be screwed. With a reverse split the company takes back your shares and issues you less shares like 1 for 15. They then re-issue those shares to new investors to raise more money. The price is then inflated for a moment (smoke and mirrors).The price then drops back to where it should be before the split and investors lose more money. Vote ""NO"" to the split."

Looks like everyone is asleep  no comments
C’mon who shorted this below $10? 
"close at near day low, looks like ready to burst through the $4.17 low mark from october, when it happens look for this thing to settle in the mid $3s until shorts take it below $3"
Thank you Rick Munarriz of the Motley Fool for looking under the hood. Excellent and concise report. That will get more exposure than our banter here and perhaps a few others will pick this up too. The next few days are going to be very interesting. Below $14 is cheap (heck below $20 is likely cheap).
"For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Blue Apron Holdings insiders own 23% of the company, worth about US$30m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.23% held by insiders, and 30-40% Short!"
"Hellofresh issues securities worth 200m $ for a potential tender offer. Maybe for APRN, who knows?"
Finish above $12? Edith think so! Yeah!
I will prefer healthy world instead of money! Current fact is people who can afford will order Blue Apron or others - I believe it will go up! Let’s Stay healthy together!
So much undervalued. Should already be trading at $45.
this will go back to 8 today
"welp, sold half my position at $14. Hope this rockets after earnings tomorrow morning."
Buy out around the corner
Halted?
Great time to buy in now
"Today, let us talk a bit about Morgan Stanley and Canaccord Genuity and their many relationships with Blue Apron.1) An entity affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, who is an underwriter in this offering, is administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender under our revolving credit facility and will receive more than 5% of the proceeds of this offering upon repayment of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As a result, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will be deemed to have a “conflict of interest” within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5121.2) that a “qualified independent underwriter,” as defined in the rule, has participated in the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus and exercised the usual standards of due diligence with respect thereto. Canaccord Genuity LLC is assuming the responsibilities of acting as the “qualified independent underwriter3) In order to facilitate the offering of the Class A common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the optionThe background is pretty normal, but also implies that Morgan Stanley work with Blue Apron and Canaccord to profit from a significant short position for the last two months.Before the offering, Canaccord raised their price target to $18. Canaccord, acting as the ""qualified independent underwriter"", supposedly made sure that the offering did not break any rules.Blue Apron, knowing about this short setup, but wanting the $35 million cash infusion from the follow-on offering, torpedoed their own ""best quarter ever"" results by submitting an absurdly low Q3 guidance number.... which wasn't a lie because of how it was phrased...And today, Morgan Stanley, maintaining an equal weight guidance, lowers their price target to $5.60, when the market price is above $7, and a day before monthly options expire.Fellas, Blue Apron, Morgan Stanley, and Canaccord are all working together to manipulate the price freefall for the last couple of months..."
might see under $1 today close Vicente
Similar Web site trends are VERY encouraging. Steady uptrend reflects more than 30% more site traffic in January compared to August of last year. Maybe 2021 is indeed the breakout year for meal kit services.

Going to watch this a hour longer and see if an after hours Exploration UP is on the Menu. btw, Our Family LOVES Blue Apron products and like Buying stocks in companies we have had Good or Great experiences with, or at least see great value as in a Southwest Airlines. Not the best ride, But Great well run company compares to others. APRN will do very well over coming Months and Years. IFO In Family Opinion"
This stocks seems ridiculously cheap. Their competitor HelloFresh is valued at 2x revenue. And both are relatively close to profitablility. Sure revenue has been declining but that’s clearly going to stabilize and hopefully turn around sometime in 2020.
Amazon or Walmart? Which one is going to acquire this company?

HelloFresh boosted its full-year outlook to 30% to 35% in revenue growth. Seeing HelloFresh pull away from Blue Apron -- which itself is coming off back-to-back quarters of double-digit declines in revenue -- may not seem like good news at first.

"Guys did some digging into who purchased Aprn stock recently. Big guns to say the least, Mellon bank, insiders, and hedge funds. This stock will go to $6 with half decent news. Looks like cheap price is an apportunity for people to load up. At this point I'm long, sell point is below 2.40 if that hits perhaps I'm wrong about the $6 price."
I will be enough to admit. I bought APRN a falling knife stock.

Why did Buffet say “world had changed” and decided to dump all airliners? Do you think he would still sell if he believed things would return to normal in a year from now? APRN will go to triple digits and you will all witness this.

Now trading at .52 cent after 1/15 reverse split awesome job blue apron
$3.88 and market cap is still over $750 mil? This thing has should have a market cap of no more than $200 mill. There is much room to fall. Target price is $1.80 in 6-8 months.

This will be be the next $APRN. Buying as much as I can tomorrow!!!
More and more people are staying at home after work. Food delivery and Meal kits business are booming. We're still far from getting a vaccine. APRN market cap is low and will climb higher in the coming months. Choose your stocks wisely...

Judging from your posts, you seem to think you are the smartest investors in the World and certainly in this forum, but even if that's true, you do know that insider knowledge trumps any wits you think you have, don't you? I am really just trying to do you a favor, from my selfish point of view I'd love nothing more than have you shorting with every last dollar you own - all the more panic buying in the likely short squeeze coming sooner or later.http://openinsider.com/search?q=aprn"

2 weeks from today until the ER. It's nice that it'll include the guidance for 2020. That and it's before the bell on a Wednesday? Good combination! Yeah! Let's Go!
Patience. We are back to double digits and we know what APRN is capable of on any good news. Just patience...

"Finally some respect ;~). Nice to see the stock moving north again. ""Y"" reported a late delivery and we have experienced that. The packaging is good enough to allow for a day extra in shipping. One delivery, last fall was a couple of days late. BA reversed the charge, we threw out the proteins, bought replacements, and made the dishes. I used to go on the web site and self-select meals from the choices offered but now just take the three meals they send ... never disappointed and occasionally get OMG good meals. Yes, you can beat the price. I have friends who ran a large B&B and cooked constantly. They are both excellent chefs and have little interest in BA. I'm a software engineer, my wife is a teacher. We have full lives and enjoy the convenience and quality of BA. I'll probably sell my shares somewhere north of $6.00 but only because I enjoy finding under valued stocks with large upside potential. Scored big with Infinera and have a couple of others that I'm watching. But for me, BA was an easy buy based on the Buffett dictum ""buy what you love"" ... and we LOVE Blue Apron!"

Took my losses and got out never again!!!
Green close on good volume.
"Good point below that this is put up or shut up time for APRN. Market presented the opportunity and APRN management has to capitalize Now, having said that, I do think they are an eventual acquisition target. Simply put the track record is suspect and given the new norm both short-mid term, and longer term people preferance to eat in rather than restaurant business changes the consumer behavior. To that end, I really don’t see these guys able to pull it off themselves as don’t have the economies of scale. Cash rich companies can scoop up APRN. I mean think about AMZN and Whole Foods...Market efficiencies for production (caped, new facilities) and logistics is where optimization is needed for APRN"
Brought more :)
Earning will beat With positive A jump to $8+2019 $14+
Why the pop
Expect a partnership with BYND shortly after the split!!!! Imagine IF news like that is something they are holding onto till AFTER the split is in effect with only 6.7M shares avail??? Im holding... and buying more... this is a trick to get others to sell cheap and short with a bigger risk.
PULM is my next pick 20 million market cap most undervalued biotech not for longAPRN loading under $10.50
This company is a sell. They lost money again. Granted they lost less but revenue was down about 30%. So what's the path to profitability? It's lost money since ipo. They have some cash but a yr or 2 before bankrupt or have to sell more stock? Losting money and not growing is not conducive to stock price going up. I don't know who buys a company that never seems to make money.
"The reason it’s stuck around $3, it’s because of short squeeze! And soon after APRN will jump over $ 8.55"
It's gonna retrace back into the 7s today. Then drop a bit lower tomorrow
Expect huge volume today! This ER report and guidance looking forward triggers institutional funds to pull the trigger on the buy side! 12-15 million shares today!
Reverse split 10-1. Don’t seem like they can keep this above 1!

Guys you should really cover. They will take this to $100 a share. Don’t come crying when that happens. You are warned.
look at WTW News!!! APRN Partnership!!!! It's real....
People can’t even pay their rent and you think they are going to buy overpriced meal kits?
I'm a Blue Apron customer and long options holder. They are no longer sold out of items. The demand is there and they are now delivering. I'm expecting a good earnings report.
"I just searched the Jet website for ""blue apron"" and ""knick knacks"" and do not see any results. What am I missing?"
Price target $8+ 2019 $14
11$ coming soon. Buy more
APRN $5.50 ++ Target $8 plus
This is going to fly back up again
I’m feeling confident that earnings can reflect a much better value than $1.35. I predict a fairly decent percentage jump coming .
"One thing that drives me nuts about this company is marketing. They're spending $1.50/share per quarter on marketing and they can't produce enough to meet demand! This past quarter and until they are meeting demand fully there should be almost NO marketing. Turn an estimated .50c loss for the quarter into a $1 profit and they'd have more media exposure than they could've bought. On the plus side, I think people who expect the 'covid effect' to be temporary are completely wrong. This is a historical event that will change people's behavior for a generation, same as how old timers who survived the great depression spent a lifetime trying not to waste food afterwards (clean your plate!)."
"Amazon makes a lot of sense now! Distribution, Cash, & Better Marketing team, better management"

In as much as I never expected us to see these prices again, I don't think we are going to see 2s anytime soon -- in part because someone lent them a pile of money at $9.25/share. So eventually something will need to occur to prop up the price. While I do agree we might see $2 before seeing $12, I think us heading back up eventually to 6s and 7s is a realistic target IMO. Also it seems there are less risky stocks to short. As APRN only has about 18m shares outstanding, it wouldn't take much to create a short squeeze -- this stock tends to overreact in both directions.I would say I'm curious at this point who is actually selling. There is still about twice the average volume suggesting institutional trading. This isn't ""shorts"" forcing the stock down. There is a limited supply of shares to be shorted since they are borrowed shares. I'm back in long on 2K shares at the low 4s. I think that's a safe bet but may be a hold for a month or two. Glad the shorts here are making money in the meantime. This is one of the few boards that at least some of the shorts seem like decent people.And btw, VOTE. Whoever your choice whatever your reason - let your voice be heard. Can't complain later if you can't muster up the desire to fill out your ballot."
Just bought another 250 look for a big price jump on May 25th
2x daily avg following lunch! I see steak and lobster on the menu. the big guys have set the table
Stabilized really well. Just patience. We will be back to $4 presplit level before earnings.
buyout rumor amzn
"This will be a short lived rally. APRN meals need prep, a lot in many cases... IMHO. When faced with a choice of a prepared meal delivered or meal where I need to work to create it., Which I have done several times.. I'll take a prepared fresh meal."
Let's hope that earnings are good 
"Tapping fingers on desk, glad for those benefiting from the uptick; however, not ready ready to get back in...lol"
Maybe they got a government contract?
This business reminds me of Pot. Nothing proprietary about it and easy to enter. This is already a saturated market and will only get worse. Pot is getting cheaper by the day and businesses are going bk and consolidating. Same thing needs to happen with food in the mail.
They are on track to make money in 2026 so we are all good here.
its not over. it will swing up again did this yesterday. dropped to 12 dollars and back up to 18 at close
Green day for APRN IPO price next ... Just kidding but always something.
That is bottom buy buy strong buy
It could gap up from today’s low if they can keep up with the demand.
There’s the press release I promised. “Sharp” increase in demand for product!!!! Have a nice night longs!!!

$7 broken. If closes above $7 today I will buy 10K more shares. Currently holding 40K shares.
"Besides all the reasons why APRN won’t even be able to truly capitalize on the possible surge in orders it is facing, an article published this morning shows that it appears this “surge” is not even that huge based on their app download data as well as web traffic to their site! This is by far the best article I have seen to debunk the folly behind the recent surge in the stock. Seriously guys, sell now when you still can."

 THE REAL QUESTION IS;Who isn't BUYING. APRN after reading this article https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2019/08/02/5-positive-factors-ahead-of-blue-apron-earnings.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahooWow
"APRN needs a plan to get the share price up. It was not too long ago that the IPO was at $10 ps. Laying off workers is always a good thing and I can see them doing more in the future. Who needs lazy employees? APRN should also start buying back shares. This action alone will put fear in the minds of shorts. Also, they should start a dividend which will bolster share price. If needed, they can lay off more workers to pay for the divvy and buy back. APRN is no longer growing and is happy to retain their customer base. Their customers are loyal so continual layoffs will not lead to customer loss. All this will result in the shares going up to $1.50 then $2.00 and by the end of next years $6.00."
"My quick analysis upon ERThe good:Cost cuts have been highly efficient. I’d say with razor sharp precision.Existing customers are spending more.There appear to be more orders being placed as compared to prior quarter. YoY is irrelevant, considering we have all witnessed the fall and that has been expected. New CEONow the bad:I’m still seeing a decline in customer numbers. I expected the partnership with WTW to produce added customers but not the case. Granted the total number dropped by just 5-7 but still.The reverse split proposal will be an albatross hanging around the neck."
"will be accumulating more between 6 and 4. I think, chances of touching 6 (50%), touching 5 (25%), quick dip below 4 (2%). I am also happy if it just goes up from here on.. :)"
"Guys, look at the history of large reverse splits at these price ranges. This events almost always end up getting worse, not better.Would not be surprised to see this stock hitting 4 to 5 bucks in the not too distant future, and a buck in the long term...."
Is it possible to reverse a reverse split?
"can someone please explain to me the ""form 4"" that were processed on november 30?"
"If you want a crystal ball at where this is heading, first read this https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/01/reddit-traders-squeeze-gamestop-these-stocks-could-be-next/Then check out KOSS. Remember Koss headphones. They started the week out at $4. They went up to $40 (currently $35ish).I doubt they are worth a market cap of $240M. On the other hand, APRN revenue & customer base average around 8% of the market including HFG and MMM. Comparing market caps even at the current stock price, while APRN’s numbers are on par with MMM, MMM’s market cap 250% greater than APRN’s."
"Sold mine, moving to WTRH..., similar stock"

"I recently watched a YT video from about 8 months ago with the CEO talking on CNBC about how they are focused on obtaining the customers that will be ""great customers"" for them -- those that will stick with them for a long period of time. Can someone explain to me the characteristics of this target customer? Singles? Families? Married couple no kids?I can't fathom who would stay a customer of any meal kit delivery service for a long time. I am asking true longs here who believe in the product what about the product that you think will make Blue Apron more than just a fad product? How can Blue Apron compete with MEAL delivery service, GROCERY delivery service, and free easy access to cooking instruction on the internet? I just don't see where meal kit deliveries fit in other than a novelty purchase for a date night.I don't know enough about the markets to make an educated guess on short term stock price. But I would bet a lot long term the CURRENT product / trajectory will lead to failure. It's possible of course they exit with a sale or pivot completely to something different -- but i see CEO strategy is to double down on obtaining new ""better"" customers.Thoughts?Disclaimer: I shorted a little bit at $14.00, knowing this stock could do ANYTHING in the short term during these extraordinary times."

This stock never fails to surprise me!

Would WW think of BO of Aprn? They could use something. Yeah? Maybe partnership a test go? Yeah!
Wheeeeeeeeee! Let's go! Yeah!
Has APRN ever had an up day?
"Blue Apron will fall below 9$ today, quote me on that."
next great short will be baby flays iPo...another burger joint? seriously?

"@Green post reminder...….APRN will have power to run another 300%-350% up tomorrow. As we know, most of restaurants and places are closed for dine in. This will affect all 50 states. People will rushing in to order meal online. Only Blue Apron (APRN) can handle this type of business. The demands are so high now. Many analysis predict APRN could reach to 100.00+ per share. ……………...Still think $100 pumper?? How much did you short?"

$13 coming! Amazing this was under $11 just 2 days ago! Yeah!
It’s a crazy market. Just keep you eye on what service Apron provides.
"aprn surprised upside er was over 50% last time, expect good report"
Been in this since April with an average price of $10.77. Finally got out today at $12.17. I had high hopes for APRN but it just doesn't seem that they'll ever be a great money maker. Took my money and added to my WTRH. I feel much better about their long term potential than here. Good luck to all that continue to believe in APRN. I'm out.
I'm an APRN customer. I love Blue Apron. Every meal is gourmet and takes less than 1/2 hour to make. The Knick Knacks are special. I would gladly buy them in a supermarket were they available. All of their products are top shelf.
next earnings call ......Texas facility was not opened in time still can't keep up with demand still dealing with labor issues ...how about a cucumber recall ??
Down goes frazier....
This is the 15/1 reverse stock price! If you sold today you got tricked! This could easily go to 100 and not be close to the original IPO price. They have never had this much demand and it’s only getting worse. People will be locked in their home and sent a check.... think about it.
Hold it. Whatever moved the price today will be there for many months to come. $APRN will be back to IPO price before end of summer.
Reverse split is official now for APRN. They are planning an R/S from 1:5 to 1:15. GLTA
I think by end of week it hits 4.
"Sourcing foods to feed oneself and/or family are changing and the coronavirus is simply a catalyst for more dramatic change. Meal kits provide an alternative to do it yourself grocery shopping and will benefit from an environment in which limiting one's exposure to others is beneficial.Any vaccine, cure etc. is good news but will not likely impact meal kits for some time. Quite contrary, because so many places are now grappling with massive spikes and impending restrictions (and we are still dealing with the first wave - the second one likely to hit with flu season later this year), this is just the beginning. For the meal kit industry, the catalyst is just getting started."
Always good to finish strong. Blue apron strong!!!!!
"This is about the easiest short you can make this year. Complete no brainer.I would wait a day or two to do it, however."
The stock that never fails to disappoint never should have went public 5 year chart speaks volumes

Why the uptrend ?
It is summer time..... will pick back up in winter when people do not want to be outside.
Even at $4 short programs are in full force. Nothing will stop shorts from beating aprn to a pulp.
"If the wtw partnership works out then I can see some kind of merger with wtw. APRN need to look into serving people with diabetes, and high blood, and other issue. This would differentiate APRN with other meal kit providers and grocery store. And they can charge more for these type of meal kits."
Typical day - stay patient longs. We have all seen this action before.
should I hold my 2000 shares or should I sell the shares
"Blue Apron should start selling snack and beverages too, only food is not enough.PepsiCo is acquiring a Chinese snack company for $705 million."
and we’re red - let’s see price break $1
Answer me this riddle...The company is SOLD OUT on nearly 50% of their meals. So how are they going to fulfill orders if they don't even have the food to meet the needs of current customers.
"It's ridiculous to see the number of bashers on this board and others. Blue Apron provides an essential service that is heavily relied upon by hundreds of thousands of Americans. This coronavirus is a catalyst to driving additional demand. I still believe the company will be bought by a major corporation who will improve the ops margins, increase the offerings with lower and higher priced plans and invest to further scale the business and customer base.This stock only has 8M shares and a valuation under $200M. If this customer base scales to over 500K again, then the company is worth so much more to a Target, Starbucks or Amazon. Amazon just closed its Prime Pantry because it can't keep up with demand. It could easily drop $500M to purchase Blue Apron."

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-all-food-delivery-options-are-savory-11586431800Prepared food delivery isn’t the only business benefiting from consumers’ desire to avoid the grocery store. Some meal kit players like Blue Apron APRN -5.35% have been reborn this year. After losing nearly 60% of its market value in 2019, Blue Apron is up over 300% over the past month. Shares of international meal kit company HelloFresh HFG 0.90% have also done well, rising more than 40% year-to-date.As consumers view supermarkets like petri dishes, they should tolerate a few missing fries for the comfort of food delivered to their doorstep."
How did it rock with such low volume over 4%?
Can we make it back to double digits?
We need some communication from management about the flow of the business etc. I know they are busy but that also helps market the business.
only company I know that says earnings are going to be a beat and stock goes down 35% LOL
still cheap valuation
Ba and air bnb announced partnership stock goes down manipulation. Something tells me there will be a good profit this quarter.

Short Squeeze soon! Too cheap!
So glad I sold yesterday. I’llBuy back at 2.00 maybe
Whoever sell below 30.00 today will regret this afternoon when see APRN up to 45.00-50.00
I’m in small 3600 shares to start .
But why WMT should buy APRN? if they can cook ?
A buyer will pay 130 mil for APRN. Mcap 50 + 80 in debt. Then another 70 mil to incorporate and downscale the business. Total cost is approx. 200 mil and for this amount a buyer gets the brand name and a shrinking customer list.
"RSI 72.65 ~ Upcoming earnings will most likely be under pressure due to 1 X expenses related to closing down their Arlington, Texas facility. 3rd Q earnings is when the stock will come back and tell the story going forward."
get before friday time buy hold i add more share thanks for the depp
shorts getting burned
Hey guys! Move over to Wtrh! It’s still relatively low in comparison with APRN. Bound to make more profits there if it surges up! I think Blue Apron is done...
Thank god I got out. I’m still getting killed on everything else but this is even worse! I’m sorry for the long term holders. This is not fair that a company would drop this much in 2 years for people
Where's the new CEO?
Scam from day 1 of IPO from 11 to .55 cent reverse split 1 to 15 this whole stock offering is fishy Concorde gives an 18 price target they should be investigated by SEC
"Tomorrow we will be below $1 presplit for the last time. Then $2, $4, $8, and $20. All presplit prices."
"I don't know what to say to those who bought at high level. I can say this for sure. Blue apron is back in business! Sure, you must have lost lots of dollars. but you will thank me when it goes back to 20$'s in two weeks. Linda rocks!"
This company is losing market share and customers. It has a broken business model and will never ever make money. It is heading for bankruptcy in the n ext 6-9 months. Trade accordingly!
"I had 1500 shares, got tired of waiting gor it to spike up so I sold it at a loss yesterday prior to the spike. So mad at myself for doing that! Seems like everytime I sell something I'm always missing out."
Short squeeze
This is up because (1)A smaller competitor was bought yesterday for more money... APRN has huge distribution warehouses around America that are underutilized (2)They hired 29 year CFO of PepsiCo. (3)Signed a retail deal with Costco that brings on new recurring clients.
"I purchased this stock few years back at 150$ a share, so this is not even a tenth of it’s price and when they went on ipo there was no fear of virus, future of Restaurant’s is under pressure and this stock just having half of the ipo value should be 75$.I believe we will see that day, but for now, tomorrow I hope we break 15 $ , today is the day to buy call options."
"To the people who think this is temporary. These kind of catastrophic events are really rare however happens time to time in history. When happens, people may change well established behaviors totally. You think pandemic will end and people will start traveling and eat outside. No sir.

Cosco will Aprn for 1.5 billion the perfect match
Can this get to $1.50? Edith think so. Yeah!
10 more shares at 4.26 a share. Up to 510 shares now wow. This is either completely stupid for me to do this or a great move.
"A new article analyzing APRNs debt. The conclusion QUOTE:We have no doubt that loss making companies are, in general, riskier than profitable ones. And the fact is that over the last twelve months Blue Apron Holdings lost money at the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) line. Indeed, in that time it burnt through US$21m of cash and made a loss of US$56m. Given it only has net cash of US$15.7m, the company may need to raise more capital if it doesn't reach break-even soon. Summing up, we're a little skeptical of this one, as it seems fairly risky in the absence of free cashflow. UN-QUOTESource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/blue-apron-holdings-nyse-aprn-042831586.html"
"CNBC Stock Draft Update, its a wonderful world !"
"With Kroger buying Home Chef meal kit company, very possible Blue Apron may be bought out by other supermarket chain to level the playing field. Stay long folks. This company has a lot of room to grow."
"Wow just realized -- Short % of Float (Mar 31, 2020) 56.53%. That's extremely high. If this takes off, it will take off to a new level when these shorts cover! No wonder it shot up to $28 from $2 last month. What a promising prospect"
sad when Sears Holding has more life then this POS
"A couple of thoughts about yesterday's news release. I have come to learn that the meal kit industry cannot seem to make quick adjustments to market conditions and as such, is slow to turn and therefore harder to steer. With that in mind, yesterday's announcement is actually big news. While you may not agree with BA's strategic decision to focus on higher margin, repeat customer business, this is the direction the company mapped out prior to Corona. And these new options are a response to this focus.Given that COVID-19 is not going anywhere soon and that meal kit providers will benefit from this, Blue Apron including, rolling out a more formal focus on upscale business is likely going to produce continue positive results.It's not like they are all over the place here. Like offering a low cost competitor to Dinnerly or Everyplate. They are focused on the high end and this announcement is in line with that strategy."
"Who's Hiring Amid Coronavirus LayoffsToday 2:11 PM ET (Dow Jones)PrintBy Chip CutterIt isn't just major retailers and health-care giants hiring in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Moving companies, food makers and others say they need additional help, too.With more than three million people filing for unemployment benefits last week--a record--plenty of Americans are now looking for work. Economists say most of the job opportunities at the moment involve getting food, medicine and other essential supplies to people.Amazon.com Inc. has said it plans to hire an additional 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the U.S. to keep up with surging demand, while Walmart Inc. will hire 150,000 people to work in its stores and fulfillment centers.As more people cook at home, Blue Apron Holdings Inc. says it wants to fill 300 roles at the company's fulfillment centers in Linden, N.J., and Richmond, Calif., to meet a rise in demand for its pre-apportioned meal kits.The company hopes to hire people displaced by the restaurant or food-service industry, said Linda Findley Kozlowski, Blue Apron's chief executive."
"I haven't followed APRN but the recent price spike on no news led me to the buyout rumor on the message board which got me interested.Word of caution, I was long on a company called 8point3 energy partners (CAFD); I thought it was a good dividend paying stock but the controlling shareholders were apparently tired of running it and agreed to sell to private equity for substantially less than the open market share price (also lower than my cost basis so I took a loss on the buyout). Curiosity led me to look at the 10-Q for APRN and this stood out, ""our chairman, Matthew B. Salzberg, held approximately 68.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because Mr. Salzberg controls a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, he will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, so long as the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of the total number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including a change of control of our company, for the foreseeable future, and might affect the market price of our Class A common stock."""
"If you want my stock tip, jump down to the end of this long post but it’s nice to finally find a place to discuss the meal-kit industry.I started researching the industry on 3/20 upon returning to home in New Rochelle, NY (the epicenter for NY’s outbreak) from a trip abroad. We had to self-quarantine and at first relied on friends to do our shopping which was mildly functional. I soon began working with various grocers by emailing them a list & cc#, getting a call when my order was ready, calling them back when I was in their parking lot, waiting for them to roll out my cart, and when the clerk was at a safe distance, retrieve my groceries.Some stores could not work with me and referred us to grocery delivery services but they are ill prepared for a pandemic type of response. You couldn’t even book a delivery. They only book one week out and these slots were “sold-out”. Not that it mattered as their websites listed many items as “unavailable”. A handful of grocers chose to work with me even though they found my process odd. Fast-forward a month and everyone is doing business this way.I also began paying attention to how restaurants in this area were transitioning to take-out. In particular, high-end locations whose food you wouldn’t enjoy reheated (not for that $$$$). I quickly came to the realization that the food delivery channel would be dramatically impacted until there was a cure for the virus hence my interest.As I see it, there are three histories to this young industry: BC or Before Corona, DC or During Corona and AC After Corona. The most important metrics for me regarding the BC period is whether a company has good leadership, a market presence and a good supply/delivery channel. I think most other metrics got trashed somewhere in the latter half of Q1 2020. As for the AC period, I don’t care right now. The most important thing any of these companies needs to figure out by the time a cure is readily available is whether they and the industry can forever change the way consumers shop for groceries (their Amazon coming of age). What they do during the 4-8 quarter DC stage is essential but early signs are not as encouraging as I had thought they could be. Not a single one of them has “championed” the meal-kit!I have tried to reach out to two companies and it is impossible to get through to leadership. I thought that I would have to jump through gatekeepers but these companies don’t even have a gate. Their email and phone numbers all dump you into their general ordering ques. I was even told by a rep that the best way to get a message to corporate was by writing a letter. An Internet company where the only way to get to its leadership is via the USPS? I did get a response from one leader via LinkedIn but that was luck and the conversation ended before it began. Not a good sign but I hope that will change.Of the three publically traded companies, APRN is the only one traded on a US exchange which explains why there are only a handful of comments on the Hello Fresh (HFG.DE) & Marley Spoon (MMM.AX) Yahoo comments page. Both these German companies sell in Europe, Australia and the US. HFG is traded on the German exchange while MMM is traded on the Australian exchange.I am still doing research on Hello Fresh so I won’t comment on them. I first took positions in both APRN and MMM in the last week of March. And while there is ample discussion here about Blue Apron, I am not surprised that no one is talking about Marley Spoon. In order for me to buy shares in MMM, Schwab had to first setup a trading account for them, a 2 day process and you have to call in the trade and wait. They and apparently most of Wall Street don’t even know MMM exists. Schwab’s new symbol is MLYSF and you can thank me later.I bought a respectable number of shares at $0.43. As of close this morning at about $0.85/share (they trade in Au$), MMM is a far better ROI than APRN’s 7% nudged during the same period. I have looked at their metrics, listened to their quarterly & year-end reports and am impressed. MMM’s presentation is far more detailed than APRN and pleasingly more transparent. I see them as a company that might figure out the road to AC (After Corona). In the meantime, if they can find a way to generate some market enthusiasm beyond just the island of Australia, I wonder if they can’t become a $10 stock. Here I would love to here the thoughts of others.The few analysts that have chimed in on the industry are all about BC and are a hindrance. From a New York “ground-zero” perspective, delivery of meals you prepare yourself at home is a safe way to shop. With many of us having more time than ever, cooking is a great way to relax & pass time. Feeding the family builds self-esteem and brings the family together. If there ever was a moment for the meal-kit industry, now is their time.Looking forward to hearing your comments and sorry for the lengthy opener.Cheers,Richard"
Steady momentum with good volume. Nice mix
Tomorrow will be sell the news day the rest of the week also. It will end around $6-7.00 by Friday
A positive article from Motley Fool? Who knew it could happen? Things are definitely looking up for APRN.
On to the 13's! Yeah!
"The phone is ringing off the hook, ""send me some impossible burgers for dinner."""
My PUTS! Yeehaw!
Companies like this will need to partner up with Amazon to be able to sustain the orders. This is not over for this stock. Maybe it will be after the virus
"Starting a company, then running it and then making it profitable is not a joke. It takes time. BA is doing great. It will be profitable in near future."
6.85 divided by 15 is .45 cent CEO Linda is a rock star lol She has made zero difference in over a year
looks like massive short squeeze happening earlier.
"to put things into perspective, this thingy has never turned up a profit and will never ever ever willsee ya at $2 over the summer"
What's the price target if they show 25c profit and project for $1 profit in q3?
From seeeking alpha: Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) is off 0.8% postmarket alongside news that it will offer 15M shares for sale...shares are expected to come at $1.15-$1.20
sooner price finds its bottom $1's the sooner it takes off
"Then there's this guy @fer using Covid relief money to borrow shares to sell and drive down APRN, then insult the company like it's their fault. Just to get the price down so they can buy in cheap."
"There is no reason for this stock to be hovering around $10 this long. There are by my count only three publicly traded companies that focus on meal kits and serve the US (no Krogers, no Amazon). Both Marley Spoon (MMM Australian Exchange) and HelloFresh (German Exchange) are up over 100% since late-March. APRN not ... why? Same exact market segment. Same exact consumer demand. Same exact product/service. And about the same amount of market news (near none since the last ER).It all comes down to options as neither of those two companies trade in options. So my take is for anyone interested in going long, wait until the next ER which is just around the corner. I suspect that numbers for all three will be very impressive.After all, how could they not. Prior to this coronavirus, these firms provided a novelty product, with multiple brands reaching into niche sectors from green sourcing to special diets. But because of this pandemic, they are now an essential food provider for many households. No worrying about exposure in the supermarket, no masks, no standing in lines, no shortages of grocery items, and no risk. For those that believe the business model is broken, my answer is ""not anymore"". I have made some very good money with MMM. I didn't do HFF because I thought that at $27 (when I bought), they were closer to peaking. I was way wrong. Good luck to the shorts. I suggest that in the very near future, that won't be nearly as much fun.Happy investing and stay safe."
By how much the sales should go up for a profitable quarter? Seems 20% is enough. Do the math. I believe we will see a new 52 week high soon.
one announcement around plant based meat will send this stock flying. this is a great opportunity. management should make wise investments in categories that matter.
There will be an offering announced at end of trading session today. No way will apron let this pump go without raising cash!
"Great, now APRN decides to go up after calls expired :/"
this says it allhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/d10af32d-7e71-39b1-9fc7-6b324e1d23d0/3-stocks-i-d-avoid-at-all.html
Have we reached bottom?
"Good news! APRN is going to cut portion sizes as a means of boosting profits. Well, maybe to reduce losses. They are also going to sell more stock because of losses. All this means the stock will zoom. First $8.00 ps. Then in a month, $10. Before long we will be knocking on $15 ps."
I picked up 3 call contracts at 3.20 for 6 months
Good volume today. Likely will be a high volume day..3x-4x recent average..
"to the very stable geniuses who are waiting for a ""buyout"" why would any company buy APRN when they can buy cardboard boxes and veggies from Kroger. LOL at the level of delusion. Ive been warning since the stock was $10. This is a 50Million dollar company at MAX. That means the stock is worth 25 cents."
"People are going to regret that they sold at the bottom when this moves to $5 next year. Profitability in 2019, not bankruptcy."
Weekly box just arrived on time and exactly as ordered again! Blue Apron management and employees have literally been heroes during this pandemic.
"OK, im in... I think this thing is gonna double top. Or may tank, but risk reward looks acceptable at this point."
7 divided by 15 is .46 cent IPO 11 dollars now trading at pennies you are the best Blue Apron
lot of short trades and profit taking.
"For all the clueless out there, the secondary equity offering is complete and done. The cfo spoke to this on the can accord call (24:00 mark here http://wsw.com/webcast/canaccord42/aprn/)"
"It going up tomorrow, will reach over $4 and waiting for costco to get to $$8 plus"

Trump is gonna put the country on lock down on Sunday. So it’s gonna way up Monday.

I was right about meal kits unfortunately I invested heavily in the wrong company been thru 3 ceos at least 4 investor relations personnel seen Wall Street loves to short this company Blue Apron rewards shorts only if you bought this for 1 dollar before RS you are down 60 percent not one person who bought shares before RS is in the green
This stock is really trading under a dollar split adjusted. It's AN EASY DOUBLE HERE; BEYOND EASY 
winning!
https://www.wsj.com/articles/meal-kits-thrive-during-coronavirus-lockdown-11588428000
Loaded up on puts. Offering coming any day now . This company has no cash and covid sales didn’t go up
"If market wasn’t down, APRN would be at $3.40. There is a chance that this may go positive by the end of the day!"
Would not want to bet against Mr. Wonderful on this. He is right on almost all of his picks.
Dave this week
"Trump will have another disastrous press conference and fear will quickly return or maybe everything shutting down. All bad things, but good for Aprn."
"Edith think Aprn going back to $1. Then, 1-5 split. Then, big money comes back. Then, BO or profits come. Yeah!"
"My opinion, bad news has been leaked already based on price decline as of 10/22/18.Most of the selling pressure has been regular investors, that are very disappointed with BA. If you looked at the large purchases in since 10/22, very large blocks, I’ve seen this type of action before. BA will disappoint on ER, and my suspicion is that some kind of positive announcement will be made at earnings. Could it be AMZN or WT? Low volume and slow playing till earnings. GL to All."
Where is Edith B.
why doesn't Morgan Stanley buy the company they are the one that put nearly a 2 billion dollar evaluation on company for IPO
Was this a dead cat bounce or something else? Why is Hello Fresh so successful?
"APRN has been trading differently today, and strongly in my opinion. It has held its increased position throughout the morning, when normally it fluctuates like crazy. I think this is a good sign going into this earnings week, showing that people are investing and holding, awaiting ER on Wednesday."
down 25k have to go long
"Why are there so many haters in this conversation? We all want to make money in this distressing time. The best option is to support each other. APRN has great potential, its demand is increasing every day. Where else are people going to get their food when literally it is dangerous to go out?"
"Hellofresh reported Q1 results: https://www.hellofreshgroup.com/websites/hellofresh/English/3300/presentations-_-webcasts.html +82% revenue and 11,3% AEBITDA-margin132m operating cashflowQ2 estimated with even higher revenue increase than Q1"
"Sometimes, all you need is a jet to soar. Yeah!"
Closing BELL.WHAT A GREAT DAY FOR YOUR GUYS WHO HAS APRN. ENJOY YOUR DINNER.
huge Q1 beat coming!!
"Here is my reaction to the Q1 strappado-1) Pretend I did not warn you 2) Rationalize that this ""Q"" was weird and of no predictive value 3) Continue believing in Linda's magical powers despite pulling a dead bunny out of the quarter 4) If you liked APRN's closing price yesterday, then you gotta like today's closing price 25.26% more 5) Congratulate yourself for recognizing your special gift Blue Apron shareholders. You are the true dreamers."
"BA still a bargain to Edith. At best, they have a nice turnaround. At worst, they have a nice suitor to buy them. What's the issue here? They not doing well. We all know. So what can ER really show. Hey, that rhymed. Yeah!"
Wow what is going on ?? Should be going up before earnings what a painful stock to be long in heart ache since IPO
Not looking good today! Everyone at bell taking 40 cent profit! SELL ASAP!!
uh oh Chrissy Teigen is coming! stock will pop!
What's the news driving these gains today?
The only thing that can save APRN is if they get in an exclusive deal with Beyond Meat to ship BM products to homes.
market is green and this is 10% down what will happen if market goes down
im in at .95...LONG
"As skeptical as I have always been about APRN, maybe it’s worth stepping into with a small position.There are still some bullish analysts, and even though I don’t generally trust them, they may have some valid points about the company. Pre-Covid they seemed headed for bankruptcy, but maybe with this trend of people staying home, they can actually thrive."
"Just compare APRN with Hellofresh and Marley Spoon:Hellofresh and Marley Spoon both posted more than 100% revenue growth YOY, meanwhile APRN is at 10%. They are losing market share."
Another happy day for my short 1000 shares. 32% in profit. Should I take some profit yet?
"im out, it can go up now."
"pril 2 (Reuters) - Meal-kit service provider Blue Apron Holdings Inc said on Tuesday its chief executive officer, Brad Dickerson, would resign to pursue other opportunities.The company said Etsy Inc's former Chief Operating Officer Linda Findley Kozlowski would become the CEO, effective April 8.Blue Apron also said its co-founder Ilia Papas would be leaving the company to pursue other opportunities.

Hold on your shares $8 coming soon
Who Bought the Millions Blocks??
"congrats to all long term investors, hold it for long term."
It took a pandemic for this to be viable. This run will not last. Take profits
"volume volume volume,,,it all depends on the volume...if we get over 20 million we are in a rocket ship"
Most places do carry out tho?
"This is a trading play, not a buy and hold, pure & simple"
"Based on earnings, does this go up or down tomorrow?"
we’re doing green candy sticks today
So there is no explanation on why this up today?!?!
$8 here we come!!! 
Ready for the afternoon push up.
next week is pay day!
Hoping for an upgrade soon.
"$WTRH had a 52 week high of $15. We have so much room to grow, $APRN already hit their 52 week high. Lets get this monster to $7-10!!!"
"The only way to save this freefall is if they release some kind of positive updated guidance like Hello Fresh... some hard numbers.. but until then it's going to get bashed. I see APRN on my Instagram now, in boxes on the streets, and see the high Covid positivity rates across the nation.. I feel like a rising tide should lift all ships but it's hard to believe that with this kind of price action."
I've been saying that since $8. NEVER should have gone public. People can't seperate the product they like from a bad business model.
"Just ordered Chipotle for my family. We had worst Chipotle ever. Seems they don’t feel to meet the standards when there is no customer checking food preparation. Long story short, cook at your kitchen! Learn to feed your family."
$1.50 today
shorts are running
I am back in. Got 5000 shares at $2.01 this morning and planning to keep this for a long while.
Aprn $5.5++++
WOW ! Looks like buy out on the horizon. Thaks Mr. Wonderful.
2.60 next
POS 2 .5 years after IPO trading for .60 cents after 1 to 15 split they have screwed over every long term investor scam stock
more buyers getting in past three days.very interesting.
They are making room for a good Earnings Report on Aug 2nd fingers crossed
Don't sell and dont borrow Your shares
"We forget when Amazon started they just had books, now they sell everything far better than brick and mortar. Why couldn't Aprn do something, and offer more products."
I appreciate being tipped off about the offering I have been in this situation so many times and yes the additional stocks tend to dilute the shares especially right after the offering and when holding long it always comes at the worst time it seems. It was a hard lesson the first time and still surprises me from time to time but this stock has been low and always rose back. With covid still around and even years after we get through it companies like blue apron will be profitable. In the USA the only real competition is hello fresh but there is enough market room for both and blue was the first to do it as an innovative option for gourmet and the name blue apron is strong. I will watch the movements and buy more in on the lows holding long term.
"This one better. Other one making Edith dizzy. But, very soon, Aprn heights will be making Edith dizzy! Yeah! ha."
I've been reading the posts on this board. I'm surprised no one has mentioned that Blue Apron started the on demand service in the bay area. This is a big differentiation from other meal kits companies as BA found the logistics to deliver its meal kits on the same day customers order them. The press release is on the BA website. Another biggie is that BA now has its own market place in Jet.com selling its spices as well as other cooking essentials. All this should translate into extra revenue streams this quarter. Folks this plane is getting ready to take off on August 6.
If shorts are not careful they could lose 100% or more in a matter of just 1 trading day. CEO Linda is a rockstar. East coast demand alone is thru the roof. BULL
I'm looking at a pie chart showing APRN at $5 + by end of year
"Great great opportunity to gain Great company, managed well, meet the expectationsJust it’s matter of time Everything is down , even apple And APRN still holds onHold on your shares , no compromise selling cheap APRN reaches all the expectations $8++ value this yearHold on your shares 2019 $11++"
"Hi guys, I'm a bit worried about this stock. To be honest with you, it was a risky bet and I thought during the second wave it would increase its price again as it did during the first one. I bought it at 7.68 but since then it just goes down. Therefore, I don´t know if I should keep being patient or just accept the sell before it gets worse... what do you think about it? Do you have faith on it?"
Hammer?
Just did our first Blue Apron meals this week. Helping our my wife in the prep. All good over a couple of glasses of wine. Just different but enjoyable. The seasoning combos I highly recommend. Blue Apron is here to stay.
people are buying without seeing numbers
"mkt up apronblue down, every single time, does this mean apron @$2 when vaccine is available?"
nope makes perfect senseneed to fire the entire board and get some intelligent people to run the Company..While competitors skurocket this st plummets
I paid my two bits and got my haircut. Where's my shave?
4+ lets rally
"Blue Apron began to trend to the upside in all it's online venue this weekend, including its website, ios & android apps, and groupon sales almost doubling. Meal kits company will be big winners in this ongoing crisis as more and more people will be staying and cooking at homes."
"once they prove they have a profitable and sustainable operation with 2 consecutive qrtrs of profit, Amazon's and Walmarts will start looking at acquisition. hopefully as early as Q4 2018. if they sell for 2-3x revenues, that would represent $11/share price. they question is will they get there and can they maintain and grow revenues with competition. I still think that this type of convinience industry has room for growth."
Should be interesting with earnings posting just a day before Feb. options expiring.
ironic or corporate strategy that this get announced AFTER a 1-15 split?? thx aprn _ _I_ _
Wheeeeeeeeeee! Let's go! Yeah!
Never ever buy an IPO ever again!Never ever buy an IPO ever again!Never ever buy an IPO ever again!.....

If you are long and trade on margin (even if you are not marginal on the issue) call your customer service and tell them not to let your shares to be sold short. The thieves are out today.
"sooner price bottoms, the sooner it takes off"
Negative territory
Expecting upgrades and more institutional buys.
"The amount of speculation on this company is absurd, once the virus subsides reality of the company's fundamentals will hit hard."

Motley’s mean attention and fixation is like young teen crush. Secretly loves it!
Perfect size float and business model for this Pandemic.. Going ALL IN $$$$.
"Best I POO ever 11 to .36 cent in 1.5 years and tack on a reverse split just for kicks not a 1 to 5 , not a 1 to 10 but a whopping 1 to 15 reverse split then a year later dilute shares makes reverse split meaningless and the hits just keep coming"
We need more people over here. Please tel about APRN on every social media platform. Let them know we are part of this fight!!!
40$ coming
I always laugh when people say this or that company is a buy out target just to pump the stock. That being said I don't see any future for APRN except If somebody buys them out. The current situation is not sustainable. I have been tracking this since it's IPO and find the failure compelling.
next week $6s
This go to 50$
"Good buying volume today, stay long."
"Aprn $8 , strong at its level despite the market downHold on your shares"
aprn will end the day up.
Costco should be godd inthink
"I am long on this stock. Its customers are upper middle class and above. Those are the people who have money and can afford this. This crisis gives them a chance to try Blue Apron and Blue Apron doesn't have to spend marketing money to attract them. After the crisis is over, those people would still give Blue Apron a try. In the past APRN spend a ton of money trying to get people who don't have money. Those people would dine and dash after the promotion period is over. Blue Apron doesn't need those customers. What APRN needs to do now is to provide great customer service so the Upper Middle Class and above like the service and remain loyal customers after the crisis is over."
Best defensive stock for coronavirus. China use company like this to deliver food. ￼
Told you today would be a $15 day. $75 in 48 hours. New shorties will be logs for the fire.
Just check the 5 day chart out. Aprn is marching along quite nicely. Edith expect to end the week above $15. Who agrees?
"Almost four times all the tradable shares traded, today, nice."
Can this get back to 7-8 in 3 months?
Shorts own 1/3 of BA. Once they clear out it will be smooth sailing.
"Now this is clever marketing. BA change its online campaigned to ""Don't just eat less. Eat smarter with Blue Apron. Balanced meals for a balanced life."" At a 66 million market cap this is the opportunity of the century!blueapron.com6 Meals FreeBlue ApronGet Offer"
Boom !
We’re still best in breed!
Recently I received an email from Blue Apron advertising other items they sell. Like cooking pans etc.. Because of the large client base Aprn can figure out other ways to make money. Sell groceries perhaps or experiences on Air Bnb website. Cooking classes and so on. There is potential.
"Here is why I like meal kits. 1# uber eats is great. But eventually people will want to eat healthier. Blue apron offers that. I do think blue apron will be around in 5 years. I think there here to stay. With partnerships like weight watchers, the diabetes food and many other partnerships. I think this is a winner long term."
"is bluethiung was not sable to add new customers during pandemic lockdown, what is their plan to add more customers when normalcy returns in january?"

"APRN beat , $$$$$$$Blue Apron (APRN) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.17. This compares to loss of $0.20 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 29.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this meal-kit seller would post a loss of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.18, delivering a surprise of 18.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Blue Apron, which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $140.73 million for the quarter ended December 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.62%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $187.65 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Blue Apron shares have added about 47.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.3%.What's Next for Blue Apron?While Blue Apron has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Blue Apron was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.09 on $166.10 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.36 on $591.27 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the bottom 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"volume after cold shower, thats bluefhingy, wheres cheerleading NEC?"
"The call with Linda on fox business yesterday was a basically a capitulation. No ideas how to improve anything, just the hope that some people join Blue Apron during quarantine. The desperate call for new money goes in the same direction."
"somwething smells here, how the #$%$ lose customers during pandemic and not have enough workers when there are so many people out of work?"" meal-kit company said it lost customers during the pandemic as it struggled to find workers to meet surging demand."""
buying time $$$$
i will join blueapron
This can easily pop 50%+ out of nowhere on any positive news. Margins improving and WW and Jet.com could have a wonderful impact to APRN.
Too many stocks popping off today to gamble here.
Guys what ratio for the reverse split?? I cannot find anything. Thanks!!!
"So far this year Brad and his merrymen have opened pop up stores, hired Chrissy Teigen, partnered with Bobs Burgers, partnered with Airbnb, partnered with Costco, selling on Grubhub and now selling on Jet.comNet result stock keeps tanking. I am starting to think this company is struggling a little bit."
"Ok, let's all meet back here in 3 months and reveal the huge uptick in revenue. Break."
Breaking 1.52 today hopefully!! Abit of wishful thinking .
"They had the perfect market during covid (they deliver food!) and did not earn money and now need more cash inflow? The newly issued stocks are ending up in the market, diluting the price yet again - some of that priced into todays drop - but not all.Have you checked the actual products? Good stuff, but a family of 4 (with time pressure) can easily get a healthy meal ordered and delivered (and cooked!) for $40 (+shipping). Problem is that many families do NOT want to cook - and IF they want to, they can order (or buy in market) same ingredients online via Walmart/Amazon or where ever.It is VERY hard to see WHO their target audience is? Rich, health focused people that want to cook themselves and time to spare for same?Covid will create a financial domino effect that will affect all spending, and fluff like this is the first to go. They bring NOTHING new to the table, except maybe dosing the ingredients in exact portions at a high cost.I am not here to try to talk APRN down (they handle that fine themselves ;) ) , and you will not see a ton of negative messages from me, but the above conclusions seem obvious to me? Or am I missing something?Disclaimer: I am short APRNCheers!"
"Is this a buying opportunity, or is it going to $0?"
"BA has announced a new dish called ""Mettez votre cheville"" that will pull them out of their funk. Longs should order it up."
Earnings tomorrow. Be patient
I'm long on this stock not becuase they will destroy Q1 and Q2 estimates. That's a give in. I'm long here because this pandemic is the largest free advertising budget this company could ever have. They are bringing in masses of new customers who never used their service and a certain percentage will become long term customers. That's the long game here. Imagine investing in a company that currently has an unlimited advertising budget that they aren't paying for. Their cost to acquire a new customer must be now at record lows! Wonderful for profitability!
limit order at 3.18. Let's see if the uptrend continues and if this was just a bump.. or if we are going into a correction
Thought Kevin O'Leary was smart. Looks like he loses CNBC contest.
"Matthew B Salzberg, a major owner of Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. and a director of the company, recently acquired 100,000 shares of the company. The buys took place at $0.00 per share (and therefore, likely the result of option or restricted share grants), on February 11, 2021. Salzberg now owns 128,631 shares of the company."
Buy the dips and thank me later. We will see $20 in couple weeks.
ahahahahahahahahah https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APRN/key-statistics?p=APRN
Don’t see $4 today but perhaps this week and past
Longs Right now
I've lost more money on this than I made in an entire year 5 years ago. My life is...bleak at the moment
"3 days to earnings and too many shorts are still holding, if they earn moneo on Q3 someone will live under a bridge...Too risky bet for shorts"
Difference with Hello Fresh (i own some shares) is that Blue Apron has a way lower market cap. If the stats on my account are right Hello Fresh has a market cap of around 4 Billion. So Blue Apron with market cap of 160 million according to yahoo finance cap has a long way to go...up. I apologize if any of the stats are not correct.
"I'm a Blue Apron customer. I normally get a shipment every other week but now, in this new environment, I don't dare miss a week. Home delivery is crucial right now."
AH looking good too so far. Time to buy more? Made first purchase on Monday morning after pullback. Thinking about adding to my position.
"Based on peers price, it’s a $20+ stock, let’s see what new CEO does for this company!"
With the earnings release around the corner I feel like the big guys are dumping volume to chase all the small sell stops out of their holdings. Any thoughts on this? I'm hoping on a swift turn around
I hope you all read this article about new board members. Barry Salzburg is an accountant and owns 34% of the beneficial voting shares. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blue-apron-appoints-four-directors-200500403.html
"I have no position in Blue apron, but l feel for the shareholders. It will be extremely difficult for blue apron to survive this steep competition from Amazon ( Whole Foods ) and Walmart. Those two are big giants compared to blue apron and their cash is endless. Blue apron is just a victim of these gigantic companies. It’s very sad, but they are dead man walking. The best scenario is for Walmart to buy them out or Target to buy them and get into that space . If not they will file for bankruptcy period. It’s just sad but that’s the way it is."
"Longs should take heed from yesterday's 13% share price drop. Some would say this drop balances out a similar drop just before the reverse split. This great thinking got these investors into APRN the first place. What happened is that some investors just found out about APRN, were surprised by the split, and sold off. Fundamentally, APRN no longer has the cash to buy customers with promos. It must rely on organic growth for their brand. And this is just not happening."
"Call options are flying, up 100-500%Huge squeeze coming."
What a finish to a great day! Yeah!
"load up for weekend, this thing will fly!!"

Both APRN and WTRH skyrocketed in the USHoping for FOOD on TSX to follow suit :-)Do your own DDHappy Investing
Should be a good week 
"If you're in APRN, this is a blessing to get out. Don't miss it, good luck!"
As a 1st time...small...investor...this is one of my 1st buys. It amazes me each day. And not always in a good way.
"It's interesting to see only ~13% floats being shorted currently. For a company that has seen its share price depreciate like this, you'd expect a much higher % shorted if this trend is to continue. This suggests there will be a reversal soon, and we're already beginning to see it equilibrate upward. Expecting to quickly adjust toward $7 in a couple of weeks."
Does anyone believe this stock can go past $25 or $30 ??
pretty funny that CEO announces he resigning and SP jumps 15%. No confidence vote from investors. Slap in the face!
"If you bought in at the high, today, help yourself by placing reasonable profitable sell orders expiring far from now and never change those sell orders again."
Looks like this board is the Dave and Fer Comedy Show!
One of the worst managed business in the world someone please explain how hello fresh is up 150 % up and blue apron Is down 97% since ipo same concept same business model same boxes same delivery companies
$WTRH Has a long way to go! Join the climb to $7+ Currently at $3.10 The 52week high is $15
"While I do think there’s short term gains to be had here with all the hysteria, has anyone thought about APRN’s potential inability to source quality food amidst everything shutting down?"
"15 ROLLING IN NOW,LOAD UP MORE"
"I don't know where any of you live, but from what I have seen in both upstate and downstate NY over the weekend, people are gearing up for lockdowns. Yes, the vaccine news is welcome and promising, but the roll out of that is still quarters away. So delivery demand will likely surge. And judging by the insider buying Patrick just pointed to, I'm not the only one that sees a spike in business coming."
Add as many as you can and hold
Before Christmas will touch 1.90$
"Not to worry guys, the loss this Q will not exceed 18 mil! Buahahahhahahahaha"
Im very tempted to buy back in. I sold3 days ago and took a 18.00 loss are there any opinions on this stock as a long term investment?

I’ve got a fridge full of corona and gonna get the virus today before noon.
I'm not sure what to think of those who didn't sell at 1.60 or even better at 1.63. Greed? remember the company has no clear plan as to what they want to do there just going for a ride in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.
"as economy rebounds and people go to work, bluethingy on its way to $2"
"Not sure why this is a complex topic for some on this board but APRN already raised money at $9.25/share. Usually these deals are invested in by top funds, and now longs (can buy) and shorts (can cover) at a price even lower than the $9.25/share.https://investors.blueapron.com/press-releases/2020/08-06-2020-045053227"
I'm seriously not complaining about this going up... But why ???
"Goodyear just layed off 50,000 people. Everyone is shutting down. You can’t slow down food delivery. Food is a need not a want."

VLRX & APRN are exploding today!
"Pres & CEO, CHRO, Director, CTO, etc. have been selling some of their positions since November 19. Go to the sec.gov website and look at the form 4s for the past two months.

"this is a BUY there will be second wave of covid coming soon esp with all those protest, riots"
"May not seem like it now 7 mins in to the session, but this will be Aprn's day! Yeah! Let's go!"
A clear sign that the markets are in a huge bubble for something like this to even be IPOed. Cheap printed money chasing after investment mirages.

"Holding up about same (a bit better) as the overall market. It has been handling these days much better than before, where it crashed on most day - whether overall market was up or down. In fact: it often DID make it green on a big market down day.There COULD be a big buyer picking this up (still fairly low volumes compared to history, but ""big buyer"" is relative when a small cap like APRN).I have moved my stop/loss (take profit, as short from 12.26) from $9.25 to $9 on this ongoing strength.Good luck to all!Cheers!"
Buy out around the corner $8.50+Hold on your shares
Should be renamed Red Apron.
"Blue Apron beefs up menus with Beyond Meat burgers, shares rise 33% (Reuters) - Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) said on Tuesday it would include Beyond Meat Inc's (BYND.O) plant-based burgers on its menus next month, betting on a multi-billion-dollar meat alternative market to lure new customers."
Pumpers have left the building
APRN is the stock to own in the next couple of years imo. It will take some time before the public can feel safe again. There will be fewer people going out to eat even after we get a vaccine. APRN is one of the best play for stay at. home stocks...
"So there seems to be more articles put out by MotleyFood that are slanted somewhat negatively toward Blue Apron. Then I decide to look at the disclosures and have a better understanding. ""John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. ......... The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends AMZN."" What a shame. A reasonable person could believe that the articles written in this manner by the 'fools' or any other ""groups"" providing their views on a stock, are just a way to manipulate the stock prices, due to the high number of followers. Kind of like controlling the pump and dump of whatever stocks to get folks to act upon based on their recommendations or non-recommendations. If I have numerous members and I buy a stock at a low cost, then tell my highest paying members before any others that this stock is going to be a winner and buy time is now so they need to get in now, then I tell my lower tiered members that the stock is showing an upward trend (because the upper tier buys back that indication in the charts) so they need to get in now, and then I publish an article to the general public telling them the stock is showing strong movement (high and other tiers have already bought) so that stock is a buy, so seeing the charts, they panic and rush to get in before it tops out. Stock begins to steadily rise, then after a given time, send out info to high tiers it is time to get out and maybe short, then lower tiers to get out and maybe short, and then just post a story to the public saying the stock has run it's course and the headwins are going to be too much. However, at that time, the stock has already backed off substantially. Not saying that is taking place; however, there are appearances out there that seem to match...."

11% upside
Something big is happening next week...huge....I just feel it. just my hunch
"I've hit two home runs this past week - in APRN and WW. Upcoming within the next week are TEVA and PDD. Join me for the party, they are as oversold as APRN was."
At this point HFG could buy up APRN with petty cash. So undervalued
"remember that APRN IPO presplit at $150!!! because APRN was projecting revenue similar to present volume. the stock is at $13, anyone need me to explain the upside on this stock"
Back to 1.70 very soon
"So with HFG finally reporting Q4 figures last week (along with MMM and APRN prior ERs), here is a quick reality check (all figures converted to US$ and as of today 3/11).Total revenue for this group in Q4 was $1.53B and HFG is the group leader with 87% of that revenue, APRN at 8% and HFG at 5%. And of the groups 5.97M customers, HFG again is the group leader with 89% of the customers while MMM has 5% and APRN has 6%.But if you focus strictly on US numbers (APRN’s only market and one that represents over 50% of both MMM’s and HFG’s revenue and customers), HFG is still this group’s leader with 82% of the revenue while MMM holds 5%. But in their sole market, APRN has 13% of the group’s revenues.The same is true for customers. Of the total 3.1M total customers, HFG has 84% while MMM has 5% to APRN’s 11% (also note that means higher revenue per customer for APRN).Give or take a point here or there, these percentages have held true all year.Even with today’s APRN pop and HFG’s and MMM’s drops over the last few weeks, APRN still only has a market cap of 1%! MMM is still around 4%!That’s right, APRN is undervalued by 400% if compared to just MMM’s global operations in which APRN leads in both revenue (60%) and customers (20%).If comparing to how the others operate in the US, APRN’s valuation should be near IPO levels.Can you say “institutional short-selling”? Can you spell “short squeeze?”"
On Twitter APRN announced they are hiring temporary and permanent positions in NJ and CA
Zack just rank APRN is a buy to hold. This is a great chance to buy and hold for a big chunk of profits. Good luck for holding people!
When stagnant and trades in tenths of a cent not a good sign I see 1.38/1.30 Than id go in long tomorrow should make new weekly highs
Couple more days above $10 then come and watch the party. Let shorts lose their final hope that this will go back to $2 and watch how they react.
Hold on your shares $8.50+ this yearDon’t sellGreat opportunity
The pumpers are coming back to this stock tomorrow or next week.
"Short covering up to 7.25, now..."
Funny that the 1yr target price is $2. They may actually be right on that estimate!
30.00 is arriving soon!
"one thing Elon Musk does is always keeps investors informed even warned investors about shorting his company absolutely demolished shorts always a high % of short interest ..Blue Apron does nothing says nothing to promote stock they encourage shorts by being completely silent ...whats the game plan ? new products coming any partnerships ? New products to sell a whisk , a spatula , a mixing bowl anything ....."
"Bulls and Bears alike both agree that APRN is hitting a grand slam during this pandemic and will continue to do so until social distancing is over. Shorts will tell you people will be going back to restaurants as soon as people go back to work which may be in a few weeks. Longs will tell you that even when we go back to work social distancing requirements will be in place and that we won’t be sitting down in a restaurant with our families until a vaccine is found and distributed worldwide since you will be scared to sit next to the guy at the next table. Bears will tell you that APRN was not profitable before the pandemic and that even though the pandemic is obviously good for APRN, they will go back to being unprofitable after the pandemic. Bears will agree that APRN wasn’t profitable before the pandemic but there is nothing like getting your business put on steroids by the pandemic both with an exponential growth in new customers and revenue in order to position the company to make the necessary tweaks to bring the company to profitability after the pandemic. This is the divide between Bulls and Bears. Bulls think APRN will be able to use this pandemic to their advantage, Bears think this pandemic will not provide APRN any extra future benefit. Yesterday, billionaire David Shaw bought 5.2% of APRN. This argument was obviously in front of him as it’s in every article and post about the company. The pandemic is already priced into the stock. Future profitability is not. I’m pretty sure he did the proper due diligence on future profitability and didn’t make his decision based on articles on Yahoo Finance. Thus I’m pretty sure his decision was based on the fact that the company will turn profitable shortly after the pandemic. I believe the same which is why APRN is my largest holding. I guess Bulls and Bears will settle the fight in 3.5 weeks when ER comes out and we hear about their turn around plans. Thumbs up if you’re a Bull. Thumbs down if you’re a bear."
"still losing customers even as pandemic persists, so numbers will be horrible and cash burn steady"

"Vegetarian menu is very popular, particularly in Silicon Valley, CA."
"Only 8 million shares in float. A strong earnings report will post record EPS; which could generate a lot of attention. Either way, I hope management has the grandest earnings call of their careers ... and shorts get squeezed to oblivion. :)"
It’s over.
"~10 weeks ago, APRN guided at -0.45/share and we end up with +0.08 .... something tells me that Linda is sandbagging a bit here.Woohoo grats to the bulls, we're going to have some fun today."
Shorting any uptick always always works. Has worked perfectly since its ipo at 150. With management dead silent there is no reason to believe anything has gotten better for aprn. The short trade continues.
What a good price point to buy more shares of Blue Apron. I have tasted their food and on Costco shelf. The products is solid.
Monday $2.25 plus

"APRN CEO making a strong case below (sent to customers this evening). I got my box this morning, and am very thankful! To our community of home cooks,At Blue Apron, the safety of our customers, employees and community is always our highest priority. Like so many of you, we’re closely monitoring COVID-19, also known as coronavirus. At a time when health and safety are top of mind, I wanted to personally reach out and share information on our longstanding commitment to food safety and transparency across our supply chain. I know you have a lot to think about in times like these, and we want you to feel safe when cooking at home with Blue Apron.Transparency is fundamental to Blue Apron. The nature of our product allows us to have insight into every aspect of our supply chain, as well as knowledge of where our ingredients are coming from and going. That means our produce is fresh, our meal kits reduce food waste, and, most importantly, we take food safety seriously. Our tight supply chain also means a more direct path from producer to your doorstep, with fewer steps than typical grocery stores—and less human contact. In addition to being FDA-regulated, we also hold an additional food safety certification from the Safe Quality Food (SQF) Food Safety Code, widely considered to be one of the most rigorous and comprehensive food safety standards in the world.Safety is always paramount, for you and our employees. Our fulfillment center associates follow rigorous personal sanitation steps prior to interacting with any ingredients we send to your home. This includes frequent hand washing and wearing gloves at all times.While the FDA guidance states that there currently is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19, we feel it’s important to reinforce our end-to-end food safety measures. We’ll be diligently monitoring COVID-19 and continuing to follow the guidance provided by the FDA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health agencies in the communities in which we operate.We also want to remind our customers to always wash your hands frequently when handling, preparing and serving food to your family.We’re here for you. Thank you for your trust and for continuing to cook with us—we believe that home cooking is important now more than ever, and our intent is to continue delivering fresh, delicious meals right to your door.As always if you have any questions about your meal experience please contact us at: contact@blueapron.com.Blue ApronLinda Findley KozlowskiPresident and CEO"
maybe price falls to .50 today
"Mark my words, back to 20 today!!"
Shorts are getting scared
yet another high volume day with rising pricescountdown to flashover
This will fall like a Led Zeppelin
"If they beat earnings, APRN will get to $3 soon. It will be interesting to see how many more customers they got from WW. For management to come out and up guidance can only mean one thing!"
will 20 soon
long apron buy 100 shares sell for $10
"Perhaps a going concern issue in the near term. I asked the IR what was the cash burn in mrq, he refused 3 times to answer — always referred me to the sec filing but I’m no accountant. Do you know what was the cash burn in mrq?"
this week would be great. thx
This is just $1 presiplit. It will make to $5 in couple days so it is $75 with today’s price.
"I have been long on this train wreck for the last 3-4 years.. obviously holding a bag right now at a pretty high cost.. I wanted to remain constructive on this name but I just struggle to see how this company loses cash in a once in a lifetime environment tailor made for this industry! Market obviously expanded tremendously as evidenced by Hello Fresh which has added $500m in sales per quarter ! Yet APRN barely adds $10-$15m and manages to lose free cash flow on that performance! They come up with new excuses every quarter! With fixed costs steady at ~$35m over the last many quarters, they mathematically cannot make money till they generate revenue above $125m range! It is gut wrenching to see this company not get it right quarter after quarter! I am also shocked that equity investors forked over $40m at $9 per share only to be served this quarter? What kind of due diligence did they do? At least it makes me feel good that “professional” investors also got it wrong with this one... smh!!!!!!"
do I see reddit in the horizon? Call in the troops. buy buy buy
Nice Volume ... Volume is good. Now if all those kids on Robinhood would only chime in.
They beat EPS by 6%
I have a buy set today at 3.25 but doesn't look like it's going to get there
Holding - no AH either way
"Gravity defying stock, just goes to show, fundamentals mean nothing...until they do."
who will hold over weekend when aprn admits there were no A shares takers @$9.25?
BUY TO COVER THEN GO ALL IN LONG BUY BUY BUY USE MARGAIN GO ALL IN FOLKS NEW HIGHS COMING
Isn't it amazing that adding some veggie burgers can make this company 60% more valuable?
"The people with money, who used to eat every meal out, now can't go to restaurants and are afraid to go to grocery stores. The wait time in NY to get a grocery store delivery is weeks. the end part 2. ha."

"The Apron is torn, frayed and currently on fire. Next: delisting and litigation."
Easy $20 today
And some popcorn chicken. ha.
Who else bought more Aprn today? Yeah!
People you really don’t see huh? David Shaw is just the start. This won’t stop until APRN doubles even triples its IPO valuation. Buy and hold for a year. Won’t say anything else.
chef yamaguchi dumping his stock options? ahahahahahahahahahah
"Yessss, half all tradable APRN shares have now traded."
rumor that APRN will be $20.........after reverse split 10-1
"Now all the news wire jumping on the factual reality of meal kit delivery. Blue Apron is prime for a monster quarter. Retention on customers will not be a factor! When BA started, they were on their way to gross 1 Billion, so capacity will not be an issue! see you at $8 bucks tomorrow!"
150.00 = 10.00 APO price before 15/1 Split
"APRN entering stores is a killer move. Purple carrot (another meal kit provider) is growing double digit and they sell at whole foods. they will definitely help them acquire new customers and grow their business. just wait for couple of quarters. end of year, blue apron will be a 3-3.5$ share."
"friday 50-75, monday $100c cheers"
let it push to 15 please
Blue Apron box just delivered this morning exactly on time and with food expected!
"Just one point to think about:Has Blue Apron improved anything on their product in the last two years? Did they make some major improvements in terms of selection choice, better food quality etc?Did they improve gross margin or reduced costs massively?The answer is no. So why should anything change after the lockdown is over?"
Closing floor trading will create havoc on stocks
where is this heading ?
With DoorDash and UberEats the consumer has a panoply of food choices equal to what they can get with BA. Why then would you want to cook when you can buy good meals for cheap? I know some investors are deeply under water and are hanging on. But there is no turning the puppy around.
Did we go from 11 to 16 and then back down?
"It is a given that APRN will go BK at some time in the near future unless there is a turn around in sales. The reverse split enables APRN to maintain its listing otherwise it goes to the pink sheet soon. Financially, it makes no difference as I do not see any appetite for an APRN secondary. Remember, if sales keep going down, APRN goes BK whether or not RS is done. This is a simple concept all should understand."
"This is great, so excited right now for my position! I'm guessing, shorts are scrambling to cover probably?!!"
Very optimistic now about blue apron's change in strategy and course. I think they're setting themselves up to tap/dig deep into a potentially huge food sourcing/subscription markets that are emerging. BA and others like it could displace supermarkets in a few years and dramatically change the way how we shop and obtain food.
Back in at 6.63
"We must not only look at the company side but also at the market in which it operates. The coronavirus has changed the world and, above all, has anticipated future developments. This means that aprn is already encountering a market in 2021 that should not exist until around 2025. People will spend more time at home and eat more meals at home in the future. That's one reason why Blue Apron is on the road to success. [https://foodinstitute.com/focus/will-2021-be-the-breakout-year-for-meal-kits-and-fresh-food/](https://foodinstitute.com/focus/will-2021-be-the-breakout-year-for-meal-kits-and-fresh-food/)"
sold a few days ago at 1.47 but didn't know this was coming. just wanted to buy something else. dodged a bullet this time
Why would a recipe by beyond burger somehow save this stock. They did a reserve split to keep from being delisted - you really think 2 new recipes going to change that.... back to 7 in a couple of weeks - after earnings below 5
"Market is falling fast that's why we seeing this, but buyers will come back in by next week see this about 30s"
APRN is up 10.14% to 2.28
"no profit producing business model, never ever ever ever turn up even a meager profit"
Kroger paid over 700 million dollars for home Chef which is only doing three hundred million annually in comparison to Blue Apron 800 million annually I wonder what their buyouts going to be like. also for those who reference pleaded not being that big of a bump they were only doing about a hundred million annually. I say 350 by Monday!glad to see we are cooking just in time for Memorial weekend ! :)again ladies and gentlemen this is a 210 billion dollar industry and being the stock was at 360 just in February it's very realistic to make that the new bottom bouncing up the five. again the leading competitor to apron that has only about another two or 3% share over current stock value is still around 11 so a five $6 valuation is not far-fetched for apron matter fact very cheap
1.50 soon will come
This company could surprise with only having to get $110M gross revenue and some decent customer retention. Probably doubtful. But they are trying. Hiring. Posting adds and trying to get some new custoners for sure. Lots of capital on the sidelines looking to bust out. This is a Reddit stock. Who knows. Decent earnings and such we could have another flyer?
50% + Pop in 1 and 1/3 day. Yeah! Shorts having hangover badly. Thanks Aprn. Yeah!
Dont you worry guys. I will win the Mega Millions jackpot today and buy all shares of BA for $10 each.
nice follow thru on volume - next tgt $8
Thinking of buying 40 $3 calls for August 18th delta is like .73 What do you guys think?
"D.E. Shaw's 5.2% stake in Blue Apron could very well be the start of an ACTIVIST INVESTOR CAMPAIGN. The data around activist campaigns show mixed results, but the overall purpose is to increase shareholder value. If D.E. Shaw is in fact launching an activist campaign, they could force management to adjust the business model and overall business strategy, or even force a sale of the company."
"Was Q3 so awful, that they had to fire half of the board to announce a ""new beginning""? All-time low after earnings call!"
The board should do another reverse split that will raise the share price lol
"Well, someone agreed to buy a bunch of shares at $9.25. I am sure they want to make money on it and did their due diligence. Isn’t it a good sign of confidence in company’s future?"
Retail is retail and this new CEO clearly knows her stuff particularly when it comes to building out niche markets.
I sell my shares 35/sh.ANY TAKER? Will see 15 next week.
"Wonder what happened to my post with the ""How"" questions....."
Thoughts on what everyone think APRN is going to hit after the earnings report come out?!
"750K APRN shares traded after hours, more than the average daily volume."
"Picked up my Walmart grocery order this morning, just put the butcherbox order delivered to my doorstep in the freezer, can't wait to enjoy my misfits market fresh produce box and my Blue Apron 4 meals for 4 box being delivered next Tuesday the 31st. On one budget/retire early forum I follow the least budget friendly things others are also doing right now is ordering meal service boxes. This isn't going to end anytime soon and my husband and I are staying away from shopping for as long as we can.."
Management and founders continue to live in their bubble. While longs get slaughtered. That is criminal.
"Glad I sold if in mid 2018, they will go bankrupt eventually"
Aprn also expanding to $7! Yeah!
I still sort of don't get this business. Shopping for the ingredients is sort of the easiest part of cooking. Anybody can do that.
"APRN upside motion Prepare for nice solid jump $5++April $8++Target this year $13++Longs , keep your shares and don’t settle for less Shorts will have to cover very soon to avoid more loss"
3.67..and then 4.37 ...and sky is the limit
"Next earning, APRN will beat and goes positive Expect $ 8+2019 $14+ Great management and planing"
current market cap is at 70 M or so.. I bet we get bought at $3 share
well it was trading around 3 last earnings so hopefully it will get close to that on this earnings
Should be renamed Brown Apron for all the diarreah I’ve had watching their stock price drop drop drop and that heart attack reverse stock split. Strong Buy ??? 
Going back to $4 soon. This level of price so ridiculus for an IPO.
Market Cap of only $53M. Company is worth so much more.
Mr. Wonderful says will probably be bought out.Kevin is very smart.Probably already in the works.
slow drip < $1
"Once a shareholder and customer, and I can see the challenges in making this a profitable company. We signed up for the trial period at about $60 for a serving of 4. (We'd get 1 delivery a week with 2 meals) The selections we had were limited, but most times we got what we ordered, with a few substitutions in place. I'd say most of the the meals included a beef, fish or chicken with veggies.....however the veggies mainly consisted of potatoes and peppers. For a price of $60 I can see paying for the service, but after the trial period it doesn't make sense to pay the $90-$100 for the same product. The last order we rec'd was shipped last Wednesday, and we rec'd it on Saturday thanks to Fedex. One main meal was beef (hamburg) and the other a shrimp dish...but we were a bit leery of eating the product as the ice had melted in the packaging. I think the last straw for me was one of the last meals was basically a cheeseburger and the side was home cooked potatoes...I think most customers have been chopping an awful lot of spuds....not necessarily worth the price. So, what did we learn?.....well, we have some new recipes to work with, but most meals we had most of the items on hand, say except for a few spices. Blue Apron quickly refunded our money of the last shipment (even though we didn't ask), so unless the company can keep existing customers at the $100 plan, I don't see this model surviving."
How’s everyone feeling in regards to the ER?
"I see many investors mention APRN’s past results to explain why this valuation is too high. In this unfortunate pandemic, there will be stocks that will be winners and those that will be losers. Past results have nothing to do with future results in stocks that have been changed forever from the pandemic. (You can ask ZOOM about that ). With people stuck at home eating unhealthy food all day, and tired of ordering unhealthy fast food, APRN is a game changer. They just hired 300 new workers to help them with demand. Everyone is talking about APRN because everyone is talking about food. It’s true that this pandemic won’t last forever but it’s also true that social distancing will be with us for a very long time to come. Even when we start to go back to work in a few weeks (or months), it will be with many restrictions and I can guarantee you that going back to work doesn’t correlate to going out to dinner with your family at a restaurant. Unfortunately I don’t see the masses going back to restaurants until it’s safe to sit next to the guy at the next table and that will probably only be when there is a vaccine in 12-18 months and even then it will return very slowly. So not only does APRN have at least 12 months of mass revenue in front of them, but the cash that they will be making will allow them to make the necessary tweaks to their business model to make them a profitable company going forward after the pandemic. Always easier to make changes from a position of strength and not weakness. Furthermore, this doesn’t end when social distance ends because in the meanwhile APRN is acquiring masses of new customers for free (because of the virus) at neck breaking speed and a percentage of them will stay with them afterwards. I have written this whole speech so investors that say that their past results don’t warrant this price can understand that APRN 2.0 is a much different company then APRN 1.0 and it would be utright wrong for anyone to value them based on past results. That would be like saying that ZOOM should be valued at its past results pre the pandemic. For all these reasons I’m long and so should you be."

HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE 2 end of yr
I believe people are selling because the rise in the stock market on reputable stocks are rising. APRN is a virus helped stock. I would buy more of this stock but watching other stocks go up is hard. So I put more money elsewhere. Wait for earnings and base decisions on actual facts and not hype.
APRN+SNAP=win win.
"Hello Fresh market cap is 76,000% higher than APRN. Hello Fresh sits at $14 Billion. APRN at $155 million. APRN could climb 1,000% to $100/shr and sit at $1.5 Billion market cap. If it did it would still dwarf Hello Fresh liquid value. APRN with this tiny float can go completely parabolic north BULL APRN. I do see a possibility of a buyout from Tyson or Campbell or anyone with a brain to penetrate the Zoom, Gaming, interior design, Scot’s Miracle Grow, stay AT HOME theme"

But in my opinion, my reasoning behind being bullish in the long term and not just the long term is the fact that the comoany is acquiring a massive amount of new customers virtually for free right now and the company will be in a much better place to make the necessary changes to its business model to become more profitable in the future. nothing helps more to fix problems than having new found cash from this major surge. For that reason, I'm bullish not only in the short term but long term as well. I'm not selling till this stock is $30 And you shouldn't either."

"Blue Apron Adds Gary Hirshberg and Tracy Britt Cool to Board of DirectorsBlue Apron announced today the appointments of Gary Hirshberg, Chairman and co-founder of Stonyfield Farm, and Tracy Britt Cool, Chief Executive Officer of Pampered Chef, a Berkshire Hathaway company, to its board of directors.“Gary and Tracy both have a thorough understanding of our opportunity to build a better food system, and their counsel and oversight will be invaluable as we continue to grow,” said Matt Salzberg, co-founder and CEO of Blue Apron. “Gary is a pioneer in environmental sustainability and organic agriculture and will provide critical strategic guidance as we continue to develop our farm sourcing and innovation programs and implement initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint. Tracy has a track record advising companies on how to scale effectively and achieve their maximum potential, and her business, consumer product and e-commerce expertise will be a tremendous asset for us.In 1983, Hirshberg co-founded Stonyfield Farm, one of the world’s leading organic yogurt producers, and served as the company’s CEO for 28 years. Under Hirshberg’s leadership, Stonyfield Farm grew from a seven-cow organic farming school to a company with $370 million in annual sales. Hirshberg has received twelve honorary doctorates for corporate and environmental leadership.“After 33 years of leading and growing Stonyfield Farm, I want to dedicate my time to other exciting and emerging companies that are closing the gap between consumers and the source of their food,” Hirshberg said. “I’ve been a Blue Apron customer for some time and have been deeply impressed. Because of the company’s direct relationships with customers, I truly believe that Blue Apron has a unique opportunity to engage and educate people about the importance of how their food is grown and have a meaningful impact on today’s food system.”In 2009, Cool joined Berkshire Hathaway as the Financial Assistant to the Chairman, where she conducted investment research, analyzed acquisition opportunities, and advised Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries in various industries. In 2014, she was appointed CEO of Berkshire-owned Pampered Chef, a provider of high-quality cooking tools exclusively distributed through a network of independent cooking consultants. Cool also serves as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway companies Benjamin Moore, Larson-Juhl, and Oriental Trading Company, and is a board member of the Kraft Heinz Company.“Having grown up working on my family’s farm in Kansas, I have a deep appreciation of the positive impact Blue Apron’s business model can have on the way food is grown and distributed,” Cool stated. “I’m excited about the opportunity to help grow another business that is focused on bringing families together in the kitchen and at the dinner table.”"
"One day, you will wake up and see the headline - Blue Apron acquired, shares soar! Then you will cry for not having a stake in it. I believe Walmart or Target will acquire this company sooner or later. It's more likely that it will be Walmart. Blue light special.... Blue Apron!"
No panic... trust the charts. Upticking nicely.
My post from June 24 said the only thing that could save APRN was a partnership with BYND.￼
Even longs on this board realize Aprn is done. Even they wonder why Linda and her management have been dead quiet for months and years while aprn stock price has been in free fall. It has been obvious to people who invest based on numbers and facts and not dreams and hopes that aprn is a very flawed business. Management knows that. They have nothing to say!
"IMO, this is a broken stock and NOT a broken company. This company is extremely disciplined as apparent zero reactions to stock price from within. Just hang in there!"
"every aprn meal sale mean a loss, so it is trivial to copy such an unprofitable business model even a kid can do that."
Florida a 21M state just issued stay-at-home order.
"Based on projected numbers from other countries who are in lockdown, America will be in total lockdown soon. The entire planet will be locked down in a month. Our hospitals will be overwhelmed in 1-2 weeks. New York already reporting they are running out of ventilators. And this virus won't stop probably until August like the 1918 Flu Pandemic. And then, there's a really good chance it's coming back in the fall as a second wave."
CEO and Board getting ready for a long nice weekend where to this weekend ? Bermuda ? Nantucket ? ...they all sold free granted shares for a job well done . Congrats CEO and worthless Board ... down 98% since IPO

"Why dump it , it’s cheap at current price"
ALL IN. APRN has been beaten down for to long
"1. As of yesterday (8th April) evening, the first available day for getting a delivery is May 7 implying they are running at full capacity at CA and NJ fulfillment centers for April and likely for May as well. The highest quarterly revenue generated by the company was ~$245M back in 2017 back when they had 3 operating fulfillment centers. Now that TX center is closed (~15% of system capacity), their potential monthly run-rate capacity is higher than $70M. 2. Pre-covid the Q1 and Q2 revenue projection is for about $90-$100m each. Q1 will likely not see any impact of Covid however Q2 could be a revenue beat of nearly 100% given high capacity utilization in April and May (TBD June). They probably didn't have to spent a lot of money on marketing meaning a strong flow through to bottom line and much needed positive cash flows.3. HelloFresh at $5B+ market cap continues to be a benchmark that there is a viable/ profitable business model if you have cash to sustain a decent investment in marketing, which APRN hasn't been able to afford over the last 2 years. HelloFresh will also generate over $60M in EBITDA in Q1 (a healthy ~10% margin) due to a much better operating leverage.4. DE Shaw investment on Mar 27 (at $11+ price) is also noteworthy. If you review their 13D/G filings (https://fintel.io/i13d/d-e-shaw-co), APRN is one of only 2, 5%+ investment they made during the covid crash. (they obviously may have made other bets below 5%).In summary, covid did come as a short term lifeline for APRN which is desperately in need for some cash flows. How they execute and manage this quarter can help turn the tide for this company which unfortunately suffers from minimal research coverage (1 analyst covering now) and a no-name institutional investor base."
So read a few of the posts here and I’m all for seeing the silver lining but this is true mismanagement. A number of my clients are in manufacturing and they have no shortage of workforce. They were smart enough however to pay a little more per hour to maintain their workforce while increasing their advertising spend and are doing gangbusters. It is clear that management at this company is clueless. No idea on the input or outcome of their board review but this would have been a great time to provide some form of positive guidance on how they are digging themselves out of this hole. This pandemic has really improved some businesses including all those in this sector that can actually deliver. If you cannot fix a labor problem when untold numbers of people are looking for jobs while everyone else in your sector is growing you will never right the ship. Curious how long their cash has them lasting. Will look at the balance sheet later. The only reason I’m not bearish is that the board does have 4 new members that might infuse some new ideas in the pot. Seems like a management shake up is in order from the top down. The ceo simply needs to leave.
I just read buy the pull back this morning....
Back to double digits baby!
"Can someone who actually believes in APRN explain to me how this is more than just a gimmick? Why and how will people join the service? How would this stimulate higher sales per existing customer? This so-called partnership, as far as I can tell, won't change anything about APRN materially."
BUYOUT BUYOUT coming soon.

"Linda Findley Kozlowski is THE leading indicator for bankruptcy and liquidation. Linda's role is like the Pulp Fiction character The Wolf, who's job is to clean up brains and fix failures. APRN is doomed for several reasons. Linda is the nail in the coffin. Linda''s CNBC interview was telling - so many tells and so many evasive answers. When asked how many customers have been lost, Linda took the easy way out and answered a completely different (and unasked) question.When someone begins an answer with ""Honestly,....."" they are usually lying. When someone begins an answer with ""In reality,....."" they are usually in denial. When someone begins an answer with ""Look,....."" they are usually trying to distract you like a magician.I do not have a position in this company. If I were an employee, I would file for unemployment. If I were an investor, I would divest. If I were a customer, I would retch.

"All you people long on APRN need to do yourselves a favor: order a week from Blue Apron. Try it. When the week is over, ask yourself if you seriously think this is sustainable. Blue Apron says it's meals have 500-700 calories per serving. That means a 2 person, 3 meal package has roughly 3600 calories. For 2 people. For a week. For 60 bucks. Now go to the grocery store and see what you can do. You could get 5 lbs chicken, the big package of pre-washed veggies, spaghetti, drinks, and ice cream for dessert, and still have half your money left over. ""But people don't want to go to the grocery store!"" But remember - 1800 calories per person per week. Blue Apron doesn't provide nearly enough calories to skip the grocery store. It's not a grocery store replacement. At best it's a DIY meal kit service for people who want to have a bit of variety delivered to their door. At worst, and probably in reality, it's a fad that died a long time ago.Make your own choices, but as I said - try a kit before investing your savings in this."

"Its an underwritten offering with a price of $9.25. The drop to that price should be expected. I view this as a strong positive for the company. They ended Q2 with $45M in liquidity and will add another ~$40M with this offering giving them almost $90M of liquidity to get aggressive on marketing and product offerings. This stock has never traded on fundamentals given the threat of bankruptcy. Now that they have liquidity cushion, the valuation should start to reflect a more going concern company. As a reminder, HelloFresh trades at 4x TTM revenue and APRN trades at 0.3x! Not saying 4x valuation is the target but its definitely better than 0.3x."

"I currently have service from Blue Apron and Hello Fresh. Both are pretty good and although it isn't cheaper than just buying groceries it's much cheaper than eating out. So I'd say the meal kit delivery is great for those that want to balance out cooking at home vs. eating out. Additionally, cooking at home is a fun activity and learn new dishes that I wouldn't have thought to make before. Sure I can look up recipes online and then go to the grocery store but I like how the meal kits provide everything and in perfect portions. I did skip a lot of weeks during the summer due to summer vacation and traveling so wondering if lower revenues were seasonal and will pick back up when school starts in the fall? Q3 will be a make or break quarter if they cannot show improved revenue and subscriber growth."

Can you guys keep buying and driving this higher so that I can get more puts in?

"Blue Apron is finally advertising on cable TV! Saw their ad yesterday, but found it a tad confusing, doesn’t even make it clear it’s a meal kit. Did anyone else see the ad?"
"Currently overbought. CV does create a tailwind for APRN but net customer adds will not exceed 100k during this shutdown period. At $100 profit per net add, their enterprise value goes up by $10m. This latest run indicates an increase of $50m in enterprise value. Smart money would cash out now and wait for a good re-entrance point in the 3.5-4.25 range."

"Yes Bob, at this rate, Apron will soon offer CBD-infused ingredients and a blockchain-based ordering system. More vegan burgers too."
"$8+Blue Apron (APRN) on the way out?Customers like the simplicity of having all the ingredients and instructions delivered fresh to their homes, plus the certainty of knowing ""what's for dinner"" at a cost that is less than most restaurants.Investors eagerly anticipated Blue Apron's June 2017 initial public offering, but were soon turned off when they learned about its strategy of adding ever-higher numbers of subscribers without regard to the accelerating financial losses.It seemed to illustrate in real life the business school joke about an ill-conceived business model, ""We lose a little on every sale but we make it up in volume."" The IPO went poorly and the company's shares have now fallen over 65% from their $10 IPO price.Blue Apron is essentially a logistics operation but the founding management viewed it as a marketing company and neglected the operations. The company brought in a new CEO, Brad Dickerson, who came from a 10-year stint as finance chief at Under Armour (UAA) .He is strengthening the management team and instituting disciplined financial and operating controls, as well as developing a more sustainable overall strategy. A new CFO brings valuable experience, and Blue Apron just hired a head of supply chain with extensive operations and logistics capabilities.Management is focused on producing double-digit revenue growth and break-even operating profits by 2019, and they have hinted that this might occur sooner.Other initiatives by this new and highly-motivated management team are likely to help boost visibility and demand. For example, a new partnership with Costco (COST) is putting Blue Apron meal kits in selected West Coast stores.While competition is increasing, many smaller competitors will likely fall to the wayside. Grocery stores have no guarantee that their offerings will come to dominate the category, and Amazon's approach so far offers somewhat in-direct competition. The newness of the meal kit industry leaves plenty of room for well-run companies like Blue Apron.Blue Apron holds over $220 million in cash, more than offsetting its debt, providing a run-way for its turnaround. Given current operating losses, traditional earnings-based valuation metrics don't yet apply.Much more work needs to be done to improve the company's ability to capture and retain customers. Its turnaround won't happen over night, which is no doubt disappointing to the market.With an enterprise value/revenues multiple of only 0.7 times, it is attractively priced considering its prospects. For this unconventional stock, we think the upside potential is worth the acknowledged risks. We recommend the purchase of shares of Blue Apron up to $6.By: George Putnam, editor of The Turnaround Letter. Via MoneyShow."
"Market Makers and shorts are essentially stating that Blue Apron success is opposite economy and all coronavirus dependent. This is ridiculous. Coronavirus is definitely a catalyst that may create a paradigm shift to remind Americans the value and importance of spending more time at home with family. The success of the economy puts more money in the hands of the American household. I hope more and more can afford to have fresh quality food delivered to their doorstep. More importantly, I hope more Americans spend time at home eating dinner with their families."
Edith told you all early yesterday that 14 was coming! Yeah!
I sold my shares at $19.00. I had bought at $2.7 will go down for profit taking
I added 25000 shares on 1.22 let’s see more worse or ??
"Remember; George Putnam, editor of “The Turnaround Letter”, is going long on this. Easy double from here, sure it could take a year (probably not), this is a good buy at this price, and a good company, with a new and improved management team."
I will be happy to see 5
Something is up with this stock... Green on a day Coronavirus rocks the market... Hmmm
"APRN is over sold , not easy to borrow for shorting ...It’s heading North , over $8"
Door Dash up 90% today almost 80 points another successful IPO thats okay we are only down 90 % since IPO
Computers sold and now people buying. More shutdowns on the way. Back to $15 baby!
Aprn will come back and come back strong. Good company.Also a buyout target
Feels like we stuck at 14.50...
"Are we waking up to major moves pre market, YUP!"
"Q2 Earnings for most companies across all sectors will be horrific. APRN will beat guidance with huge growth to its customer base. It's not a question of if this stock will explode upward, it's a question of when."
Why would Nestle purchase Freshly and not Blue Apron ?? I don’t get it ?
Big run up first thing tomorrow !!!!
My Blue Apron shipment arrived today like clockwork. I am extremely satisfied with the service and there are hundreds of thousands of others just like me. I've added to my position today and continue to pull for the long term success of this company.
"Read the Yahoo article. It's obvious that APRN needs to make changes to its biz model. However, this crises has given them extra air and cash and customers to be able to make these adjustemnets in a more favorable environment. I believe social distancing will be with us for the next 1-2 years at least and so they have plenty and plenty of time to update their model. The virus is the largest advertising budget they can possibly have and it doesn't cost them any advertising. For these reasons and despite the article, I'm long APRN and believe this will be close to $20 within a month."
"I cant understand why news about BA and Airbnb partnership got shares price to drop, not vice versa. This one is positive and is definitely bring the advantage for BA"
So we are selling for 8 bucks a share but price can barely get to 1 buck? Some of the posters on here...yikes.
News story story today mentioned buyout possibility
"$150M valuation with 8M shares in float, 33 institutions, 52% short interest, Projected customer base north of 500K and a essential business service that will continue to be heavily relied upon for many quarters to come. Time is on the side of the longs. The short squeeze is imminent and it will be epic.Don't lose sight of the facts that there are a handful of companies who would pay a major premium to add the service, customer base and topline. Exec team may have other options to play. Good luck and hold your shares."
"well done! a ""bullish"" signal with close at lowest for the day"
"What a joke of a company. 28% revenue decrease yoy.Just 7% more customers than Q4 2019 (covid 19 spike in customers was in late march, so this is reflected in numbers).-9% EBITDA margin, when Hellofresh posted +10% margin this quarter.They will not survive 2021"
Tails you win Tails you lose;SAME AS Short you Lose; Puts you lose. LoL
"I thought earnings were being reported today, just looked on the IR link and it says April 30th ?"
Personally I think tax losses are driving it down.

nice dip just added @319
"Earning , expect $8+ for APRN"

green candy sticks! blue skies
I expect APRN to blow AWAY 110 mil revenue this quarter and shatter EPS. MEGA BULLISH. Buyout value is a 1 to 2 bagger IMO
nice bounce right here.
Will close 2.70 to 2.80 in between
"This company has a chance to recover by saying they are entering into ""Cannabis Infused Beverages"" Market..."

"APRN, leading company in industry, Heavy short squeeze"
hello fresh just bought a healthy meal kit company couple days ago and now Kroger you see the pattern. good thing for apron it's not a bad company nor product nor brand just bad management the new CFO can help flush that out and structure the business for a good deal obviously as the valuation continues to raise increases the urgency for deal to strike. they certainly want to get the best deal they can even though they have all the money in the world it's business. I'm saying it now though Costco will give the edge in the competition between all the mega free Giants and they know that. Costco can fix the profitability issues by providing their own food taking over the Blue Apron facilities and using the brand name and adding in a better management team and Off to the Races. I say it opens tomorrow at 330
Pump and dump will go negative today
Back $3
"Congrats to all who bought above $3, Monday, and held. You did the smart thing."
heading to 4
Hopefully can break 1.52 today .
:(. EPS (TTM) -4.67
"5 more days, going to 30+"
WAITR and APRN both spike around the same time into the green
Good conference call. Great guidance. Yes two questions with pointed positive answers for future growth
"Also on a side note, wuhan China has reopened the economy. Lots of temperature monitoring and social distancing strictly enforced. Hardly anyone is going to restaurants."
"APRN should be trading well above $10. Once you clear out the single digit shorts, you might find an appetite for a stock that should by Q2 metrics (not past history) be in the mid-twenties, which would be more inline with MMM and HFG (Revenue/Customers/Market Cap)."
Everyone loves the apron now
Well I had a trailing stop loss and my percentage was very close to my exit. This company is a dud. I was a big fan of BA as a customer until I kept getting spoiled food. At least I have two years of recipes? Screw that I’m out. I would rather spend my money on Dinnerly which is worth every cent. APRN has been my biggest looser in my portfolio that has ran faster straight up than my eyes can almost keep up with. Selling my shares today for a loss and moving on.
March 2020 28 per share oct 16 ...6.98 per share shorts quadruple investment a 4 Bagger again and again shorts and Morgan Stanley make millions and millions
"""Prediction. Slow down in price has plateaued. Slow melt up next 2 weeks till earnings."" Matt, short covering for sure. I mean these guys are really taking a risk here I mean, all the company needs is to show sequential growth in its subscribers, and all hell breaks loose, just like what happened with SNAP a few months ago. The WW and Beyond Partnerships are not factored in by Wall Street. They will once the earnings are out. I mean just go to Groupon. Blue Apron place an offer there and immediately 10,000 was sold in days. The reviews for BA, whether is on Groupon, IOS Android app, etc., are closed to 5 stars. These analysts saying Blue Apron is dead are either getting paid to do so, drunk or high on crack, or just simply brain dead. It's like they're giving a script by these (short) hedge funds to act it out in front of the media. They all sound the same. lol."
The borrowed shares are shorted heavily until a number of the stop loss orders get triggered. Thats why the PPS drops so quickly. But just watch as the big orders come in to buy.
Don’t listen to the noise !!!!It oversold and will clime up very rapidly $buy out $8+Target $14+
It seems when Analysts bash this stock it goes upanother great premarket.Happy Friday the 13th A very lucky day for me Go Blue APRON 
up up and away 
"If you want to see where this is going, check out KOS. Like APRN, they too were one of the five companies listed in the article on InvestorPlace."
"We should be trading north of $25. Hedge funds are controlling this stock and they better have a much higher SP in mind for keeping us down here so long. The cook at home paradigm shift we're seeing in the US is real and will last a very long time. If not coronavirus, then swine flu II or something else. APRN doesn't need all of America to be extremely successful, just 2 to 3% will do the trick. In addition, they're offering premium meal kits to target those who can afford it where meal price is not a consideration. Hedge funds will take this market cap north of $500M and I will be onboard to see it happen."
price action is crazy! so glad im got in this morning. I will hold for the next couple of weeks!
APRN is hold even selloff is going on stock will be end of December 1.59$

"I don't get the point of this company. I've been buying 'meal kits' for years, it's called 'shopping'."
OK- I'm out... had enough - saved the last bit of money before it all gets sucked out... :( GLTA hope it goes well.... on to better things for me -
No big surprises. Met EPS but revenue a little short. Hopefully investors believe in future growth strategy.
It looks like Costco deal is actually improving this company.
The lowest PT on a series downgrade today is $1.25. Most of anals valed at 2-3. No chance of going south going forward. The bottom is forming. Why sell now?
"Plus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if APRN stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development."
"Guys, just buy and hold. I believe this company is on the right track to full recovery with the new CEO. Just some patience you will be awarded handsomely."
"I am surprised by the apparent negative market reaction to the new marketing push announced by Blue Apron this morning. The irony is that I have been saying all along that I would love to see Blue Apron finally produce an ad for cable TV - well, here goes, that’s part of the campaign announced today. Will be interesting to see how this plays out, I consider this great news.https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/358639/blue-apron-launches-multichannel-campaign-with-si.html"
Is the ER for tomorrow released pre market?
if it hovers around 3.90 through lunch lets see what 2:30 bulls have to say...
This stock is a joke.
Wait for the mj and CBD kits to be announced...this will skyrocket!!
a million plus shares were dumped around 10:30
"Aprn gets to $2, market cap goes to $400,000,000 Yeah!"
I just added to my position in blue apron I think it's got room to run
I think you guys are missing the point. It doesn't matter that Wal-Mart is doing meal kits. What matters is any grocery chain can put a meal kit together and sell it locally. You can have a much better selection and pick up antyime you want. It makes APRN business model completely useless and therefore worth $0 in the long run.
"Patience is the key to winning in the stock market. Never buy a stock for a quick trade, buy a stock based on strategy. Stay strong longs, the shorts are taking us down on zero volume as can be expected, we will break free of them in time."

"i think they'll post an adjusted ebitda as close to -10M as possible/needed for Q3, and show a path +7.5M for Q4"

Covering short sellers
"It's not the cooking, it's the cleaning! if they added in that service, then we'd have something"
All time lows. Will plunge further to 5 bucks
There is absolutely no reason why its trading this low but to the smart investors use the opportunity to get in at these low prices anything under 11 is a steal of a deal.
"Bought this 2 days ago and it's only dropped 17% since then with no apparent bottom in sight. I am an idiot. I'll let you know when I eventually sell, it will go up 20% the next day."
Good things are coming. Lots of noise out there. Good job longs
You still have to cook and prepare the meals. These meals take 30-45 minutes. We used them for a few months but didn't really fall in love with and discontinued. Not to say this wont work for folks. Just watch the manipulation on this. Keep those hands clean folks!
"APRN , over $8 after earning"
"We closed above $12 which is very important and we are deep in the green on a red day. Good sign. The more we digest daily how long we may be stuck in our homes and even afterwards how long social distancing will continue, the more this stock will rise."
$8 coming...
APRN reached a new 52 Week Low at 1.81
"Just imagine your competitors hellofresh/marley spoon more than doubled production since last year and had no labour problems at all and you grew with 10% and claim that there are worker shortages in the market :D you cannot make this stuff up, they should sell themself to netflix as a comedy show."

"Just signed up for Blue Apron and chose the Weight Watchers Freestyle. January 14 week is showing “sold out” of all the WW selections. Got to be a good sign, right?"
Why would anyone sell now ? Buyout price should be at least 6 . IPO was 11.00.
This will be back to $3 in couple weeks. Same as usual. Rinse and repeat.

OMG..... it's on the news now. FDA's Director just announced the therapy or vaccine could get up to 6 months to year to develop. This will be a long battle people. It will not end in next month or two months. Super markets will be closing every where. APRN will be a gold company to invest. Great time to buy and hold!
Maybe APRN can deliver my new Ferrari w the Beyond meat meal???

Institutional holding increased from 19% to 45%.
"Buy the dip. Down day in all stocks, DOW down 300 points. great dip chance for APRN. Load up, this is your chance."
"BlackRock just more than doubled position (as of end of 1Q20 filing), now own 3.8% of APRN."
Anyone telling you that APRN will soar because of the coronavirus is doing you and your net worth wrong. Read my WSJ article that I wrote to critical acclaim when this company went IPO a few years ago. The business model DOES NOT WORK!
I would buy at 1.70
"Im selling all my position today, pump and dump scenario."
"There is a standing eight count taking place right now, with no being saved by the bell. Go to SEC.GOV and search for APRN ticker and review the docs, especially the form 4.

Back to IPO price in 2021. I don’t need to say anything else. Just hold and you will be rewarded handsomely.
I bet shorts must be twitching right now. This price surge has continued for 4 days in a row now.

I told you. $75
"Been thru 3 CEO , many original founders resigning , countless (over paid ) new board members , reverse splits , numerous lawsuits , closing facility in Texas right before virus hit , 5 different investor relations personnel , countless failed partnerships with WW and Costco etc....Yes you can thank Matt Salsberg for this never ending train wreck.... more free granted shares to be sold by board and CEO keep the gravy train going for another 2 or 3 quarters why they are even allowed to trade publicly is shocking"
beyond meat management wants to raise capital at a premium valuation. most investors at 200$ range will be bag holders for at least few years. sad.
"listened to the earnings call. it's horrible! They will not be EBIDTA profitable for Q3 and for the full year. growth strategy is unknown. Jet.com pilot is over. they are into new pilot. frankly, with just 95 million in cash, they don't look like a viable business."

"Blue Apron Holdings Inc. shares jumped nearly 6% in Tuesday premarket trading after the meal-kit company announced seasonal recipes that will include plant-based proteins from Beyond Meat Inc. . Beyond Meat stock inched up 0.6%.

"This brand is not going away and there's more competition entering into this space. Just saw a Gobble commercial. Hold long and wait for the next squeeze. Smart money is accumulating here on weakness. This past earnings call was setup to paint a conservative sign of improvement. Next earnings call will be much stronger and if a strategic partnership is announced this stock will be north of $30. Greedy shorts have to cover. When the stock was trading at $2.5 they said BK was right around the corner. That's not the case, Shaw invested and the company has a registered shelf. Very low risk in my opinion."

"@Bastian shared the most important new news we have had in months and if you didn't pay attention, I repeat it. Yesterday (July 13), HelloFresh, a German based and traded meal kit company, revised their guidance for both the quarter and the year, about a 30% increase on their prior forecast noting a 100%+ increase for the quarter and the year.Also something isn’t adding up for me. Between HelloFresh, Blue Apron, and Marley Spoon (the three publicly traded companies that service the US and only do meal kits), the total 2020 Q1 revenue for these three was about $1.2B. HFG $794M 65% (converted from Euro - US$)APRN $376M 30%MMM $ 49M 4% (converted from Euro - US$)Total 2020 Q1 Customers for these three is about 5.9M.HFG 4.2M 71%APRN 1.4M 24%MMM 0.3M 5%Based on this morning's numbers, the total Market Cap for these three is about $9.56B.HFG $9,131.8M 95.6% (converted from Euro - US$)APRN $ 153.9M 1.6%MMM $ 263.5M 2.8% (converted from AU$ - US$)That’s correct, the company with about a quarter of total customers and revenue has a lower market cap than the company that has about 5% of the market! And the company with about 70% of the customers and revenue has a market cap of over 95% of all three combined.Note that of all the markets that MMM and HFG serve, only the US is experiencing explosive corona expansion and this is APRN's only market. So while revenues of the others are conglomerate of Euro's, Australian $, Canadian $, Kroner, and US $, Blue Apron's market is entirely based on US sales. As such, if their percentages track their competitors on a regional basis, the numbers for APRN will likely be stronger percentage wise."
More shutdowns coming...should see a good run on this soon.

Aprn worth buying in the mist of trade war considering it’s a us domestic company.

Why hold aprn and not hello fresh?
A local food bank is providing information to the needy on how to get discounts on APRN meals. These people stay on the program until the discounts end and quit. It's a way of getting cheap food. I don't know if this practice is widespread but it must contribute to the drop out rate at APRN. This gaming of the system is underwritten by the shareholders who pay for the discounted food with no prospect of a paying customer. But it is a good thing because many who cannot afford APRN get to enjoy the meals.
"This is the easiest short ever. So badly managed. Terrible communication. Revolving door of constantly changing management and board members. I am already short but going short from here to $3 will earn a healthy 50% or so, easily. Then bankruptcy - but that could take a bit longer as they might raise some more funds yet again, from God knows what clowns.  Cheers!"
Big boom tomorrow let’s see if I’m right on that or dead wrong
This is the best thing to ever have happened to blue apron
needs another split 45/1
Any moment stock going to green today no red every day
I think it's way more realistic for Costco to buy them out considering all the big box retailers are in a race to a strong online presence and subscription-based customer and Revenue. if not Costco it would be one of the other leading competitors out of the top three which is hellofresh I think at 37% which Blue Apron is at 31 which would immediately catapult hello into the dominant share of the market. keep in mind there's about 12 other competitors other than blue so apparently plenty of room in the market for consolidation and certainly plenty of options.
Wow I see $15 coming end of day..
Google Trends gives a good clue about the interest on the Blue Apron. It doesn't look good. The down trend is still holding. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=blue%20apron
New low today maybe!
Seeking alpha posted something about Blue Apron making a 15 million share offering priced 1.20-1.24. That would explain the drop. They also had an insider unload shares at close to $1.5 a week ago.
"Good morning and happy Monday to all... unless you're long APRN. I must admit I never anticipated it seeing these prices and not sure where the shelf is at this point. Gets a bit frustrating watching it lose $1k/day on 4k shares -- but portfolios go in both directions. I watched SNAP go from 11 down to 4s -- and now it sits at 21. My only question here is who would be willing to sell at these prices. Given this stock has been around 8-14 in recent months, people selling now are taking a bath selling at these low levels. Volumes are extremely low compared to recent trading and there has been absolute silence from the company. But... with lows in the high 2s (not hoping it reaches that), just looking for a shelf allowing me to average down a bit before the next rise. Earnings are too far off at this point to be a catalyst for movement... but October should start to kick this stock in the pants assuming nothing moves it before then.As always, good luck to those holding... on either side. Would love to see some 7s and 8s in the near future."
Shelter in place coming. This is looking good.
Today it was maintained as Equal Weight by Morgan Stanley.I think that is a good thing?
When this reaches $45 will APRN consider reversing the reverse split back to $3? Thoughts?
I see alot of post from the same angry anes and believe me I been there and done that and feel your pain but if your daytrading sometimes its best to cut the loss and trade something else if its not to your liking. I am long and in the red currently but this stock eventually picks up and moves up into the teens and patience is the key. I am more long term as well when it drops thats the best time to buy in if yuo check the historical data it always jumps back up eventually. I never recommend selling your precious shares at a loss unless you really need the money right away otherwise just hold out for a better market day. it already hit a high of close to 13 today and Its showing strong support at mid 11's.
No shares to borrow. How are u guys shorting?
The fact that Blue Apron is telling the market so early when they plan to release earnings means they had a great quarter.

Don’t you ever worry longs. This is destined to go to $75 minimum in couple weeks. Just hold and forget about it for a while. Blue Apron will double its customer base and continue strong.

I added 150 k on 1.508$ any problem??
"Today was a nice bounce. But, it is still down about 31% since 24 July. Hopefully it recovers some more next week. GLTA!"
"I do enjoy posters like Charlie (now muted). Down to $1. Probably not in the near term. Unfortunately there is a ""but"" in this message...I took the time to actually look into Blue Apron and I can't say it was anything good. I looked at comparison site after comparison site and either Blue Apron wasn't on it at all OR it was near the bottom of the rankings. Customer Service was lacking at best. Getting out of meal plans seemed to rival disconnecting from AOL -- not an easy process. The food quality was all over the map from spoiled to great -- but with little satisfaction given from customer service. Ratings were on average about 2 our of 5 stars on Consumer Reports. As if that weren't enough, my bigger issue here is the absolute inability of company management and their IR department to help steer out of what appears to be a downward spiral. No announcements. No attempt at improving their reputation. No transparency regarding the additional stock raise and how that all went. And my concern now is us falling below $6 -- which is a very real possibility. I actually did jump back in at $6.70 as planned a couple days ago taking my average down to $7.67 across 4K shares... and now looking back obviously a bad move. I cut my losses on those 2000 shares today and an considering selling off the rest before this continues.While I still believe the price will rise before earnings (and when is that exactly?) I'm not seeing fundamentals of any sort of turnaround. I don't want to hang my hat on the misery of others... meaning COVID needing to continue in order for this company to survive. I believe the model, meaning food delivery service, is a good one. Unfortunately it seems APRN is not executing well either from an investment standpoint OR regarding public opinion of their product. Good luck to those holding... hopefully we will not see continued weakness. I did reach out to IR and am curious if I will get a response."
"The price needs to go higher if they want the offering to be success, and it will"
"Good news for longs! The steady and persistent share price drop of APRN has registered 52 week lows almost on a weekly basis. From a technical point of view, this pattern is a sell signal. Meaning, sentiment for APRN is waning. I searched through all the articles on TA and none address the issue of a stock listed less than 52 weeks long. What this means is that investors can ignore the selling signals as clearly APRN does not have a 52 week track record. TA is very useful: you must know when to ignore wrong data."
Guess management's strategy is hoping for a buyout.
finally
More free granted shares awarded soon to CEO and board for an outstanding job !
"The current market cap of APRN is less than half of trailing 12 month revenue. That is too cheap for the stock. Listen to the analysts and not the short sellers making money off your panic selling.Blue Apron sells more than just meal kits. They sell wine, coffee and cookware too. In the future, they will sell frozen meals and microwave lunches at grocery stores. The Blue Apron brand is going to be a household name in the food industry. If Apple had not diversified by selling more that just computers, they would be out of business. My 15,000 shares are being held in my IRA for the long run. This stock is not going to zero like some people say. Did anyone even listen to the last conference call?"

"I think investor disappointed with guidance Q2 rather than Q1.they thought the stay home cook order only help guidance Q2 increase 12 more million compared with analysts. if guidance up to 180 miles. then stock will be up to 20 miles. if so that means if stay home order not applied, than revenue just vary,less than 100 mils / q or less.! they disappointed"
APRN is now on WallStBets reddit short squeeze list... look what happened to Gamestop. APRN will keep going higher and higher than expected on savage short squeeze. APRN has 20% short with small float. Rocket fuel...
Market gain 9% APRN lost down 15.50% you figure it out.
To use valuations on stocks today doesnt work as much being that stocks are trading at 80 to 90 p/e.
Big money finally moving in. Billionaire David Shaw owns 5.2% of shares now.
This company was DOA. The only reason it went public was so that it’s founders and the VC could get their money out and pass its inevitable losses to d0pes who bought shares.the stock.
Holding on! Very painful 1600 share @ 6.25. I am at a lost for words this is bs!
"Year end target $8.502019 , over $15"
I decided to sign up for blue apron delivery food service today. I hate waiting in lines even though traffic is much better. Quality food delivered to my family seems like it would help us. They already said higher demand right now and they are working on getting all recipes done. Nice problem to have. Maybe they will turn around
"I dont get it , this is a perfect ""covid stock"" if you will and the news is still amplified by the liber8ls trying to win an election off this , we get that -fINE ....BUT IN THE MEAN TIME the situation is what it is , this is a great idea and a company never in more need then now until this monster virus is gone ... My reason for writing this is a simple question , what the h3LL happened yesterday ? One would think with all the bad news and the loving me left media that this stock would have soared , instead it inverted and sh8T the bed handsomely , honest question can anyone tell me why this occurred ? Thanks in advance ...."
"People taking gains, and shorts jumping in. It really did go too high too fast today. I'm going to hold out until the end of the week to see if they get squeezed out. Playing with free money now anyways."
wow! i got a few shares last yr @ 10.50 and was depressed for it was so down for a while but didn't sell. Now it was up i placed a limit order this morning of 15.50 because i was scared of keeping it on hold that it might turn red again soon. Didn't watch closely and i when i checked back it kicked in! Locked in profit. I'm wondering if I should ride this roller coaster again. Lol!
#ZombieCompany that's what APRN is ! (a company that can barely pay interest payments)
OVER SOLD BY SHORTS LAST WEEK.COVER UP 9
"Did some research on the info available about the new product: Knick KnacksI like the concept behind, the great convenience aspect (everything comes in a box, you just need the meat), reasonable price and the fact it applies to most millennials taste expectations and lifestyle requirements. The only isssue I have: this must be in brick and mortar ASAP. Ideally aisles or aisle cap by meat departments."
I am in. This is absolute start of recovery back to IPO. Sorry shorts.
"In my opinion! APRN should have a cash and carry store front in major cities, and should participate in federal food programs like food stamps, ebt, snap etc."
Calm is SuperPower! There she goes!
"if there were any takers for A shares, they went in with guaranteed profit, meaning price way lower than $9.25 and very favorable conversion terms for open mkt dumps"
"Actually the most interesting meal kit news of the day is MMM's Q3 ER today. Truly shows the seasonal nature of the industry (Q3 is not the best quarter). Because while they are up dramatically year over year, the numbers as compared to Q2 are more of a hold (12K more customers and about $2M less revenue). EBTDA is still positive at $.5M but not the $5.1M reported in Q2). Year over year growth is attributed to the US market. HFG who upped their guidance last week, is also shattering year over year numbers. But again compared to Q2, they note only a modest increase in revenue with lower EBTDA. My pre-APRN ER thought is that if all things are equal, Q3 should be at least on par with Q2. And Q4 & Q1 2021 should likely be very strong. COVID19 is not going anywhere anytime soon especially in the US and restaurant dining is going to be moving indoors more. We'll see."
Will be above 30 in 2 weeks...so just wait for the SHORT SQUEEZE
Never ever fails to disappoint quarter after quarter year after year how are they even allowed to be publicly traded ?? Mother of all scams
inverse head and shoulder bullish chart
Should be an interesting day really.
I told you....this stock and any other connected to the delivery of food or services will continue to surge and trend upwards! From APRN to ZM to WTRH to GRUB to WMT delivery and KR delivery....any stocks that can serve the public and keep them indoors will RIIIIIIIIISE!!!! #ExtremelyBullish!!
"All this, is Coronavirus good or bad for Blue Apron on this thread chatter. Bottom line is before the Coronavirus hit, Blue Apron at the minimum was capable of handling sales volume to get to a break even level for net income. There sales are so high right now they had to try to hire immediately 300+ people to fulfill the orders and change the meals pattern, typical week to week (probably to fit meals with food ingredients that are more available to meet demand) and added three more meal prep options per week, up from one.The sales from this are going to be large, with lots of new people signing up. That is worth, at minimum, a very positive cash flow play.Good for Blue aprons stock price"
Didn’t figure it would sub $1.25 out til next week
boom
"Trump refused to give out estimates of when life returns to normal. Aprn will be soaring into next week, after the numbers show the curve soaring up."
Not only am I still holding tight to my shares but I decided I have to come back and comment once again because I know the stock so well and it never let me down yet. It's only a matter of time before we had back up and it's times like this where it's great to buy in before it heads right back and I'm glad to have more shares. Also to anyone that is currently in the red or frustrated don't give in to your emotions and definitely do not worry or panic . The world it's still very concerned due to the pandemic but I'm positive better times are ahead and a stock like this will only do better moving forward. Blue Apron Revenue will be up more than ever and better days are definitely coming especially to the unique services that it offers. Gourmet food prep delivery is becoming more important than ever.
Spike back up to $5.40 after hours. I believe due to Albertsons breaking new ground by being the first grocery to purchase meal preparation company.
Pumpers are trying hard to justify a bad investment
"My god it's beautiful, not often do you get to scoop up a good company at it's all time low, right before the bounce. Stock was already aiming higher ($4) after it's massive sell off and it only dropped because earnings, which were already factored in before today. This is so over sold it's not funny, here comes the big money bounce. Roller coasters are scary though, I understand."
"This is going to tank this week after Trump's ""weeks not months"" statement regarding a the shelter in place suggestions (even though it's completely not true). It may rebound when people realize Trump was lying again."
7 of the last 10 reviews on trustpilot are 1-star reviews. There is no way APRN can reduce churn with such a bad product.
"the sales will be better than projected to WW and BYND, why shorts are so agressive"
"EPS 0,08$ vs (0,45) consensus, revenue also above consensus. I guess Zack will have to upgrade his rank on aprn :)"
Apron is doing a Tilray squeeze.
"Good morning. For what its worth, here are my thoughts on this. I'm currently out of the stock having exited my position at a loss of about $2500 pre-market yesterday.Comments below suggest the company has no value. I actually strongly disagree. There is the obvious customer list. There are also assets that the company owns -- any kind of prep/distribution facility has equipment. I don't know the book value of this, but its obviously something. Also -- they are in a business that can clearly thrive now and will have a steady stream of customers for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately there is a but coming...Management has clearly demonstrated no ability to manage. They are in an ""essential worker"" industry meaning they could not only continue to work, but had the opportunity to ramp up. Regarding their failing labor force -- worst case they could forge a deal with a temp agency (one or more) to supply temporary workers to pack and ship boxes. Their business of getting food out the door is not rocket science. The problem is you need to maintain key staff... those that are in the know. You are also fighting against government checks being more than what you pay people to come to work. Many people, if given the choice, will sit on a couch instead of go to work and earn a living. All that said, I work for companies that had ZERO people walk off the job to do exactly that. Paying your labor force slightly more, like many companies did during the pandemic, kept labor forces present and loyal.I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the following...1) The CEO needs to be replaced. She has demonstrated no ability to turn this ship around2) Blue Apron does not have a good reputation -- google it for yourself and have a look. Product choices, lack of consideration for allergens and horrible customer service. Its good that they are partnering up with a Chef - but you need to make easy meals for others to prep. Home ""chefs"" aren't buying food from these companies.3) The BOD needs to actually do some due diligence here and actually figure out why the business -- at a time like this -- is failing. They need to replace key positions... which to me looks like the CEO, COO, chief marketing officer, head of QA/QC, head of product development -- not really sure who remains.4) Compensation needs to become success driven -- PERIOD. Management is stealing the company and shareholders blind. There is no reason this business cannot thrive.5) Someone needs to review the books and really determine WHY the company continues to operate at a loss. They may have warehouses and plants in places where real estate is at a premium. It won't be hard to figure out where the bulk of money is going and to start putting it where it needs to be... product quality and marketing.6) I've not seen this company create any strategic alliances. Why? They would be a good partnership business for any number of industries that could help each other with promotions and expanding customer lists.7) Their social media presence is horrible. People are home right now. Get people connected -- even if they aren't immediate customers.I could go on... Companies succeed from the top down. We have gone from teens to low 4's. When will the BOD due their fiduciary duty and clean up this mess? Perhaps a shareholder lawsuit will help wake them up. Eventually the share price will become cheap enough for someone else just to absorb this company.Good luck to those holding. Not sure when I will jump back in."
I bought at $11.75 and got screwed. Hope it makes one more run tomorrow.
What’s going on with this? Did everyone sell and leave? I don’t see anymore reactions
$20 by eow
"There must be market manipulation. There is no news yet the stock is up 11%. As a stockholder, this makes me happy but I am confused. I don't know what is up with this stock anymore."
Im feeling good
UP WE GO
Volume today is mostly up and will pass yesterday volume. The price of APRN will also fly up soon!
people don't want to cook everyday at home this business model is a novelty people try it .its fun for a week or a month and then they need to find new customers.with all the competition out there it's doomed..
breaking 7 again
"Boy, this is trading 4th the price it should have been trading for weeks now. Load up. You won’t regret."
"Most important take away from NEC website post. Well, the problem isn’t the food. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so far there has been no evidence that coronavirus is transmitted from food or food packaging."
"Hey guys, I'm holding this stock since long ago at7.68... then it crashed and currently priced at around 7s. I'm a bit fed up of it and I'm afraid that the COVID will disappear and faith on it will completely disappear. Do you have any good new or reason to tell me dont accept the loss? It is not a big one but I don´t like losing money! What's your take?"
"I have to give it to management though. Very open and transparent towards the shareholders. Linda said in plain Englsih: ""Q3 will be a 18 mil loss""!! They are under no obligation whatsoever to provide guidance! Respect, Linda! Very few decent CEOs these days!"
Wow I think maybe time to rebuy apron. I thought 10.50 was good price point but $9 is better I think
They need to shut down and distribute all remaining cash to the shareholders.
just keep giving us decent news aprn thats all we want and expect.
"i'm thinking ""bankruptcy"", now. Moving the money I have left before it's gone, too."
"This is going past 11 today, strong support around 10.20"
"Good news for APRN! Walmart just announced to cut operation hours and closing many stores. This will force people to buy meal to delivery to their doors. As of now, only a handful of companies doing business as BLUE APRON. This will be big things people. The link is below for your information.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-forces-retailers-close-stores-and-reduce-hours-updated-230324533.html"
"many will try this service but not stay on, which has been the trend. solution looking for a problem. they got lucky but this will fade away in couple weeks so get out while u can"
Shorting this through the end of the month seems pretty risky. No way they pick up options tomorrow is my guess.
I will not order meals from wall mart lol
not a fan of covid but reality is:https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-makers-take-aim-at-dangerous-new-strains-11612357201
there are funds that are purposely buying up the shares a bit at a time to squeeze shorts to cover. then they dump. will do this until a certain short % left. yesterday is obvious when it dropped to $12. not sure how many times are left
"So a large investor buys a 5% stake in the company, and the price really doesn’t move today. Is everyone seeing this only as a short-term COVID play, and not a long-term investment in a growing company? If that’s the case, the pandemic surge is already priced-in as it’s up 500% in the last month or so, and there’s probably not much more upside?"
"It’s alive, it’s alive!"
"4 bucks breached, will will $3, next week?"
Just think how high APRN can go when they announce that will will also deliver CANNABIS.....to infinty n beyond.....APRN opens at $15 Monday no matter what..
Great volume today!!!
What should I do ? Long timer here should I buy more or ?
Great news- Revenue and earnings well ahead of expectations.
"ow that almostentire woldis into this,I beliee this will beecome more known.This willbe te leading stockinto this new aea of buniess."
Look at the daily chart. On May 7 and 8 you’ll see the exact same short term correction we’re seeing yesterday and today before another move higher.
We are looking at Covid + holiday season. Anyone thinking earnings will be terrible must be pipe dreaming. Short if you can dare!!!
Here come power hour! Who wouldn't want hold Aprn into the weekend? Yeah! Let's go!
"Regardless of the path of APRN , Dave and Nope absolutely have no life, or just an empty one. I can understand sharing your point of view once or even twice but to constantly pound this forum with negitivity, you both need a hobby."
"To make a profit, APRN needs to cut down the marketing budget. Sure they will lose customers since retention is only 15%. Let this dwindle down to the hardcore customers which will be about 200k. Close down a plant and layoff 60% of the workers and a profit is ensured."
"when the earnings report comes in Nov 2nd, and the shorts scramble to cover, has potential to explode upward..."
Final Rally starts now
If they offered 4 million shares at 9.25 what happened? We are 6.77
it will surely close at day lows :(
I'm in at 4 bucks long hopeing for a buy out
"Only $1 million traded so far, today. Let's put things in perspective, APRN needs only 10,000 strong longs to go to the moon."
if this goes to $1 I'm in 100 shares.
It’s time to wake up
What happened here no moving.??? How come.??
"APRN, tomorrow $5 , huge jump April $8++"
"To the person that bought at 4.31, I pray for your soul."
"Yesterday I sold all of my 10K stocks, bought at 2.15 for 2.34, when the market opened. Today I re-entered with 12K stocks at 2.12. This company has much more potential. Who cares about the Motley Fool article. The customer will not read Motley Fool. They buy, what is delicious and what has a reliable name for quality and taste. Motley Fool ""analysts"" have no idea about marketing and sales psychology. Ask yourself: you have a cheap meal with cheap ingredients from Walmart and you have one from Apron for 20% higher price with higher quality and more delicous ingredients. Both meals take 60 minutes to prepare. Which one would you choose?"
What a great buying opportunity I Just added more
These guys should change their name to Brown Apron.
Aprn left for dead. Zero interest in this stock other then the shorts.
That’s some crazy volume in the first 30 minutes. Haven’t seen that in a long time. Bear raid? Maybe. This stock is currently nothing more than a trader’s paradise. Volatility feeds the Pros
"Just finished watching this terrific interview last Friday with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business. I wish Linda spoke like this during the ER. Some interesting observations.Linda appears to be more upbeat about stable growth moving forward. She referenced COVID-19's effects on the business but sees trends being formed that I agree will prove steady, especially as the weather cools and dining outside is no longer a desirable option.Also, I missed the big announcement that Linda Freitag is a participating celebrity chef. They really need to make a bigger deal out of TV Chef collaborations. The halo effect I think is compelling. Also spent time talking about premium options - apparently duck is coming - who new that would be news? But I like the ""premium"" push concept as that's were margin lives.Most important, Linda seemed to be positive about cash flow so it wouldn't surprise me that perhaps there isn't ""no more than an $18M loss"" coming. While not a substitute to a guidance update, the interview was positive. I would love to hear what others read into this.https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6187897600001/#sp=show-clips"

"Meal-kit industry need to be consolidated. They are many brands out there and store concepts. I do not think APRN will have significant organic growth without partnering with another brand.

Who is going to deliver all those orders?
"Wait and see. APRN will fall to $2/share by end of year, if not sooner."
Back to IPO price in a week. $150. Dont sell and make shorts happy.

“Fourth quarter operating results exceeded guidance as we grew net revenue year over year by 22% to $115.5 million.”Why not a higher pop?
"they’re getting better maybe next year I will get my position here. They did cut the loss, don’t understand why sell off if it was obvious it will be negative number. They actually bit the expectation by a penny, now there is potential for me if the next qt will show the same or better. Good luck longs"
"Don’t worry fer, I’m sure the price is going to tank nine dollars in the next three days just like you said￼. Fer?, fer?"

"We know that there are a lot of short interest on this stock (me included). When the momentum down change, a load of shorts will want to lock in profits at each step and will buy the stock back (short squeeze) so the upswings are often more violent because of that and I could see another green day coming. My stop-loss (well ""take profit"" order really) have been moved to $9.50.Many people forget that the risk/reward curve is different when shorting a stock. Potential gain is max 100%(company bankrupt) while your losses are unlimited (Tesla rocket to the moon), so smart shorts put in stop-loss order much more often than a general long investor does.Best of luck to all! Cheers!"

I really want to buy some of this cause it’s so low but I’m afraid it’s going to go lower. What y’all think?
T-minus 26 days to get above $1
I subscribe to the service and love it but I own no shares... thank god!
$10 invested in APRN at public offering is worth a quarter today. nuff said?
Finally broke through $10￼
If you take the shares outstanding 7.6 million X price $8.55= 65 million market cap. Way to cheap. Amazon should buy it and incorporate it with whole foods. Basically cost the nothing for a distribution company they can grow.
Much better Edith. Wait until *after* there is a victory. Much better for all of us.
Wow the volume!!! It might just scare the shorts a bit and squeeze em for a green day today!!!

first time in the entire history of Blue Apron they report a profit at last earnings period and stock drops nearly 50 % #$%$ ...what a scam down almost 98% since IPO yes CEO deserves her 2 million dollar stock options ...LOL

"The only thing that kept me from jumping in on this emotional uptick today was the fact that I am still concerned about the verbiage used regarding the adjusted EBITDA. Their past releases have not been all that transparent. They are going to use the layoff savings to show gains, yet I really doubt the sales have gone through the roof enough to obtain sustainable profit. Have to wait until the numbers come out and review them carefully to see IF there is a shell game being played. My guess, from the past, is that something smells rotten in the food box. I do hope I am wrong, but I can wait. If it is good today, it will be just as good if the numbers are copacetic. Still, Good luck to all."
Thank you Shorts. Great time to get in on this great company managed by the best CEO.Not a time to fear sell.

I firmly believe there is a large market of suburban, well heeled, couples that will enjoy the experience as much as my wife and I do. MARKETING is the issue with APRN. If they mount a good campaign this spring then it's got an excellent chance. For the record ... both my grocery and restaurant expenditures have decreased significantly since using Blue Apron."
Just bought in today! 6.00 average! 60Shares only no commission fee
8.46 divided by 15 reverse split is .56 cent thank you blue apron what a scam of a company for 3 years rumors of buyout or acquisition even before reverse split when it was .35 reverse split was for executives who after the split could see the shares at 10 dollars instead of .55 cents Aprn
Back to 15 next weet
APRN SHOULD BE$12-$15
"soopppppo, aprn has sales of over 600/yr some cash/offset debt, marketcap at 350 mill (at 1.80 shr) only downside i see is sales are slowing down .. yet with all the current m/a this the perfect takeout target .. low is in for now.. glta.."
I see a good year for APRN the CEO is going in the right direction. Taking directions from the power of Habits

18.36 after closing.ready 4 another rocking day till 30
The company posted a good quarter. It's likely to put the bottom in at $5 level.
I think that was 2.48 bottom
"If purple carrot can get acquired, Blue Apron will be an attractive option. But Edith still have confidence in new CEO. The rev split isn't the end of the world. It'll actually give Aprn a nice boost, at first. Which is why they're doing it. Need to get over the $1 too."
good showing with a close near day lows :)

"Under the terms of the Terminated Lease, Blue Apron leased approximately 431,000 square feet of warehouse space in Fairfield, California (the “Facility”). As previously disclosed by the Company, the Company has not occupied and does not currently occupy the Facility. In connection with the Lease Termination Agreement, Blue Apron agreed to pay a termination fee in the amount of $1.5 million, which will release the Company from all further rent obligations to Landlord in the amount of approximately $33 million, which otherwise would have expired on June 30, 2028, resulting in ongoing annual cash savings of approximately $3.5 million."

"Again, people are going to want to go out less and less due to the coronavirus, I'm guessing APRN business is going to pick up."
"Bought more today.Way under valued. They took it down , now time for the buyout bids to come in. I say at least $5."
"They guide for just 112m revenue in Q3, 16% down from Q2? And a net loss of 18m. Everybody is staying at home, when will APRN be profitable if not now?"

Edith Where are you
"Edith it's great to see the magic eight ball again, lol"
"similar chart pattern as radioshack, sears, vix"
Only a pull back because others had a good day wait till tomorrow when markets deep red we will be heavy green.
Can a stock cross +100% in a day?
"APRN is trending, today, above all other stocks for a reason. Tens of millions of people are now holed up in their homes, either due to school or high paying jobs. Obviously, some will go for the convenient and quality food APRN provides, while stuck at home with responsibilities of school or work."
It’s going to be a great quarter!Expect $8+
Getting some good traction
Will this stock reach 30$?
"we may see $6-7 today, the pumpers surely will not want to hold over weekend"
APRN would I be surprised if this vaults to $20 then $35 by end of February. Not in the slightest. Market cap bargain. EBITDA this quarter should be outstanding and raise EPS and revenue next quarter and raise EPS and rev full year. BULL
Only blue apron would shut down facility in Texas right when virus hits and now unable to keep up with orders unbelievable
I am not the only one hearing that SBUX might be interested.For the record I am not in favor of a buyout from SBUX.
Reporting earnings early. Very unusual.News of buyout would be my guess.Not moving much either way.
"What did I say, once a company goes through a huge reverse split, shares will continue to go down, Blue Apron first, Pier One $PIR is next. When a company has no real competitiveness and meaningful way to make money other than to use Stock Manipulation, it is a signal the company is right before its eventual collapse. Just look at Movie pass owner HMNY."

why is it dropping like this
"Why has blue apron been unable to grow revenue while hello fresh is exploding. If they can't grow revenue, competition is growing, and customer spending is only up marginally while losses continue how is blue apron a buy. Buy hello fresh better product."
Wish I could get more short shares. Geezs with 23 competitors out there against them they'll never make any money.
Ok. Tomorrow’s the day we hit 3.40 plus and either form a new floor there (support) or fall back like we did last time. NOW - if there’s some positive news tomorrow then we could easily see 3.50 on the momentum. It’s not really about shorts covering. They are daily playing the swings just as the Bullish day traders playing the swings.
$8+ coming soon

"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are witnessing the beginnings of a short squeeze . Hold on tight to those shares and they will get squeezed way up... this stock is pretty low float and huge short interest outstanding... do not sell... if anything, buy more if u r able"
"Edith it's great to nine again, lol"
Exponential growth. Low float. Should be a $30 stock with current demand. Market cap should be $200M-$230M. IMO
"I was nervous being short before the last earnings call. That ship has sailed after they yet again failed, despite the perfect storm for them being Covid. Going short here at $4ish is STILL 50% return at $2 (soon), and if you have some guts, play it until bankruptcy, which all the numbers now imply. Best of luck to all."
too much momentum here.Volume is off the charts shares are being held by the wiseAbsolutely sensational pent up demand for this stock.Investors want in.$10+ The Institutions & hedge funds start scooping up sharesThen 52 week break of $18.00 Charts are indicating the volume is is record breaking Large short squeeze in the works when the company drops the hammer on the shorts.13 million shares under a 100 Million market cap I see 500 market cap coming for Blue Apron Holdings Book it!then the20.00+
Shouldn't the fulfillment center be 100% complete by now?
"I LOVE IT--APRN, GOING LOW, PULLING UP."
"LARGE BULL. If it did not split 1 for 15 this would be at 83 cents per shr right now. .83 x 300% move equals $3.32. $3.32 x 15 equals $49.80/share. Hence I will be buying sub $50.00/share. Do not mess with CEO Linda Kozlowski. She was a rockstar at Etsy up 500% and ran Alibaba Chiba operations before that. Stay at home demand surging. $49 for 4 meals with no tip, no tax, no liquor up sell at restaurants."
Aprn has never ever given shorts a reason to cover their positions. Certainly not since Linda has been ceo. That's is criminal.
Skyrocketing
Above 10$ for sure
SERIOUS question with this so low is this a good oppurtunity to buy???
Almost entire float traded. $5 today. Just a guess.
Must be chatter on Buyout coming. Imagine a Bid anywhere from $4 low-side to $7-$10 high side.

Braze yourselves for a major lift-off. Robin-hood crew is monitoring. Float of 7m plus earnings beat. 700% share appreciation is doable. solid American company.
580 shares at 4.97 average price.
So I’m guessing the tariffs and resignation will also affect this one...what ever
Tomorrow back at $6.00 and next week $3.00
Hold the line!!
Buy the dips. We will probably close green and above $10 today.
"It's hard to believe hello fresh ballooned from direct competitors to ~100x as big as aprn over the last two years. Aprn suffered from overmarketing and fresh direct benefited from making it easier to cook. I think aprn is adopting some of these tactics while retaining superior quality. This is a long game, so I think as more and more people get used to meal kits, unless hf drastically make their products cheaper, as long as the prices are comparable, the companies with superior products will win eventually. This has been the case for cars (european, japanese), pc (apple), software, pharmas (pfizer, genentech/roche, novartis), and ironically, even grocery (wholefoods). I believe aprn model can be disruptive and has just had a lag of a couple of years. The iron is hot right now, and I'm pretty sure someone well see it and strike it and shape it into a formidable sword of a company."

i cant believe the share price going down to be anything but manipulation . How come no one is complaining to SEC?
"this is going back to 60 cents again. weight watchers is down 30%. the pilot is dead on arrival. feels sad. but that's business for you. packaged food industry is hard business. the only way out for blue apron is to sell to a retailer at a discount. they can help. at 60 cents, the market cap is 160 million. very reasonably priced in my opinion."
Going on green side this year
Good article:https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/04/where-will-blue-apron-be-in-5-years.aspx
"Aprn and the short squeeze..I don't understand why only one side of the coin is shown: the short sellers have their justification because they point out ailing companies and clean up the market ..... .I hear nothing of the problem that arises when a company creates the turnaround. Then the short sellers are a millstone on the leg, because they have to keep these companies under water to avoid losses. Sometimes until the company drowns although it can be saved. This is what is happening with Blue Apron, through corona and restructuring the company has turned around. But the shortsellers are holding the stock down, even though it should be trading five times higher. Join us on https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6xm19/blue_apron_to_the_moon/"

"200 million revenue equals net profit for quarter 2 and positive cash flow. In 2017, when they had like 900 million in sales they where not closed to max capacity. This don’t go out thing is not going anywhere and as we go back to normal, there is still a segment of the population that won’t go out or eat takeout."

"The emperor's new clothes or the naked shortIf you follow the current debate about GME, wallstreetbets and hedge funds you will notice that the real root of the problem is not being discussed. It is shown as a war between hedge funds and small investors, it is, but that is not the cause but the result. The root cause is the SEC allowing naked short positions. That is a violation of the Constitution because it disregards property rights. Because with naked short positions hedge funds can determine the capital value of a company. But , only the shareholders' meeting of a stock corporation is allowed to do this. In this way, small successful companies can be massively depressed and then taken over at the sell-out price. The SEC's task would be to prohibit this practice and to monitor this prohibition.But in recent decades this has been deliberately neglected, with the result that thousands of companies have gone bankrupt and investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars. The war of the small investors on reddit shows the effects that such an unjust action causes. Maybe this fight will bring about a change but probably it is like in this fairy tale, everyone sees that the emperor has no clothes but only the children scream: he is naked!#saveblueapron"
Bad day? Think we will resume our upward trend tmro?

People are ordering full meals from Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (APRN), and working out Peloton Interactive, Inc. (PTON) bikes."
its time to buy APRN stock again. Left few months ago when sensing they were in a mess with CEO being totally lost. It seem they found their floor and with this earning it look like they are righting all the delays and mistake done by the founder since IPO. Customer retention is concerning but it seem most that are still there are their core customer. Now with New Jersey fulfillment center is running they should focus on growth and expanding its products. I think they can be around 1million sub by end of the year.
I think they need to show some positive/improvements on earnings before it will pop. Im accumulating on the drops
When are we going to get discovered. Are earnings 2/16? Should be 1/29. Weird delay.
SHORTS ARE COVERING
Glad I sold it yesterday
what happened to the stock the last few earnings reports?
Last year trump said he was going to use blue apron to replace food stamps. This government shut down is part of this. I believe trump going to replace it right now for food stamps
"I still have 12K of this stock, paid USD 2.12. Within 2 weeks they lost more than 30%. And responsible for that are mainly these guys from Motley fool, who started bashing the Company in a very primitive manner. So the actual Quote does not represent the Company at all. This stock has lost its attraction. And what APRN does against that bad media? Why APRN and the Banks who prepared their IPO cannot publish any actual Analysis? The target Price of 5 USD is a ridicule estimation. Common, guys, publish some real substantial News."
"the only way to make aprn jump is everyone should sell their shares, manipulated the price drop to $2, that exactly happened in March , then will attracted buyers. At this price, buying pretty much like giving money away"
Criminals at work bringing this down.
So I sold at 18. Should I get back in?
SOLID GOLD
Hey guys if today market falls and tomorrow extends the fall then Aprn will break 15$ easy!
Even if supermarkets stay open they need to reduce hours furthermore have you seen what happened in London? A supermarket had to close because customers were fighting for food. Trust me more people are ordering online
Aprn is not going anywhere guys even when covid goes away there will still be a big demand for meal kits actually maybe even a bigger demand. The economy is still very troubled and there have been no plans set for stimulus round 2 checks so many people are spending less but when the economy opens up more and does better of course Blue apron will also. This is going to be a great stock again in due time. Unfortunately the market is filled with impatient daytraders that want to see results and big rewards right away. The earnings was positive and they made the right call to introduce shares after good news and this will cause more revenue. I think now is a great time to start collecting shares when this climbs back many would be wish they were holding. Once I get some cash I want to buy in and get some again this stock always treated me right. Man the comments so many short/puts and fearful downers ... blue apron is still the best meal kit and time will prove it hello fresh is king in europe but blueapron is #1 in the usa !
I just read an article from Barrons and it says Hello Fresh is making money. This gives me hope for Blue Apron because there is a way to may money. I am now hopeful that with the right strategy and well execution Blue Apron can be profitable. I hope Linda can turn this company around. I wish she would become that superstar CEO. I want her to succeed for women around the world. I also want her to succeed because of Blue Apron. It is a win-win for all. If she succeeds women will get more chances to lead companies and Blue Apron shareholders will be rewarded.
I’m sure the management isn’t the best and this company isn’t the greatest but if I was a big chain like Walmart. Why not buy this company or do a parternship to help américains get their food without going to the store. This would lower the prices
"Anyone know why the drop?? I see no other news. Maybe too many uncertain factors? IE if States shut down, maybe delivery won't be allowed out? Or is it if 1 worker infected, company site need to shut down? Any input? Thanks."
"Hello Fresh Market Cap 5+ billionBlue Apron 165MHello Fresh Revenue per share 1q 2020 10xBlue apron Revenue per share 34xBlue Apron should be at 550 mil market cap minimum because bankruptcy is now not going to happen with new cash flow. Million dollar question is what is max amount of revenue Blue Apron could push in a quarter. If 100 million was projected with major scale backs and Non-utilized PPE already on the books, then is 300 million a quarter max crazy? What we do know is they are sold out so a max is being hit with hiring ability a role that could effect it. But still , they are at there max."
I closed out rest of my 75 shares I was holding on to made nice little profit been in from $6. If your still in waiting for some magic jump forget it. Earnings is next month maybe something happen thing it needs to break above 20 and hold for this stock to take off. If it falls back to lose 3-6 range I might buy and hold maybe if they get bought out.
NASDAQ DOWN 4%，APRN UP 4%.
More and more states will shut down restaurants again like in NJ today. Good for Apron
I’m watching action after the close?
"Shares of Blue Apron (APRN) have emerged from a nasty downtrend. After their IPO in 2017, Blue Apron went straight down, bottoming out at $0.65 from above $10.00. The stock has now advanced back to $1.60 and a bullish daily chart pattern is signaling a move to $2.00, the daily 200 moving average. Look for this move to come within weeks."
Down another 3% to $7.50 while I type this. Almost cut in half since end July. Not telling us how much money they collected for diluting the shares with that private offering? Or what they are going to use the money on to expand biz and make some profits? Maybe they all just go to salaries and bonusses for another year or so as they is how long it will last. Good luck to all!

"I now think the spike up in price yesterday was the leak of the yelp sale of 24eat to grub hub,indicating something similar with APRN."
it will go easy above 12$ before it starts retreating
Number one person to blame is Matt Salsberg first CEO then resigned to board embarrassed to be part of earnings calls
Aprn is always down when the market has a good day. Another time to accumulate me thinks
Below $1 pre-split. Positive earnings can shoot this to $2 to $4 range easily.
APRN reached an all time low at 2.83
congratulations longs

"anyone remember where to find the revolving credit agreement table, with the minimum EBITA requirements?i hope they talk about how they're solving this on the call"
Social distancing measures to continue for the next 2 to 3 years. Who was thinking this is just a temporary boost for APRN?
"12.55 AH,$$$$$$$$$$$WHAT $$$$$$$$$$$"
The probability of systemwide market calls will probably keep this down for the next day or two￼.
when will aprn announce a new recopie ?
"I'd urge all who were long to exit while this is in ""bubble"" mode. Let's not forget how unprofitable they were and losing customers quarter to quarter."

"GREAT NEWS FOR APRN NEAR AND LONG TERM FUTURE!!!Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Blue Apron was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.GREAT NEWS FOR INVESTORS AHEAD OF TODAY'S CONFERENCE CALL."

I predict that APRN will HOLD the $5s today!  I want to see more fun gifs from Edith! :)
all the public bashing of aprn by the media tells me one thing...aprn stock is going to fly much higher! get ready!
This should be $30 very soon
Shorts should panic at tgis point :)))
Red to Bright Green getting the BBQ warmed up for some Bear Burgers. $18.00 This week all the pieces are in place now.a true stroke of genius by our CEO:1. cost of capital: near zero2. non-dilutivemore than enough capital on hand and also unlimited access to more capital at near zero cost to ramp up production.
Aprn is just became profitable and also back on growth path. The offering raises additional funds to boost further growth. This is good if you are in it for the long term. Not great if you are just looking for a quick trade.
"MASSIVE MASSIVE short squeeze can happen here, strong longs. We can all use this win right now. The power for it to happen is in your hands, strong longs."
"Crazy, i Missed this idea under covid but got most of them right. We just started ordering from blue apron but the stock really lagged the rally! This stock stunk at IPO and still is dead money! Guess I missed nothing"
14 business days until earnings...don't sell your stock. this will definitely go up...
Blue apron should find a way to sell some units with the hurricane impact. Could raise brand awareness with a donation
"Now that BA has well established operations knowhow for food sourcing, design and engineering (ie recipes) and distribution, and has scaled and learned to become more efficient, I think it's ready for a massive expansion but can they execute it? As a first step, they need to eliminate fringe projects that don't work and replace them with innovative products and solutions for not just how we cook but how we acquire high quality, sustainable food for everyone, including offices and schools."
"liquidity drying up, sooner or later it will sink big time"
"the traffic to Blue Apron site was strong in Q1. Revenue should be around $126 to $127 million, as projected."
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f126da2d-311f-3bf5-a1be-d469aff2bf98/blue-apron-is-making-all-the.html
"oh boy, Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy) -33.00%"
Rejected 6s so let this test 8s next week.
expect next week to test $4sssss
"Here comes the government shut down for more fun . And a very happy Christmas and prosperous new year to all Blue Apron investors , it can’t get any worse ( can it ?)."
"Someone trying to manipulate and create fear to bring this stock down today. By the way, the investor place article states 7 stocks not 10:) It's amazing that MarketWatch can't get their story straight and odd that the other 6 stocks are either up or down by a max of 1%, enjoy picking up shares at this low price!!!https://investorplace.com/2019/01/7-bankruptcy-stocks-to-watch-in-2019-tcs-pcg-shld-gme-jcp-aprn-bks/"
"Hey pumpers. Google trends don’t lie. There is no demand for apron. See link below...https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&geo=US&q=Blue%20apron,Hello%20fresh"
So that’s clearly either 20$ or 5$ Monday morning .... good luck to all
"Over sold , it’s rated HOLD, good value , great volume , don’t panic, hold on your shares . Unwise decisions will make you lose !”$$$"
Blue Apron Upgraded to Buy; $18 PT https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3134981&headline=APRN-Blue-Apron-upgraded-to-Buy-from-Hold-at-Canaccord
"Tai Lopez, Starbucks, and now the largest meat company! $6!"
"Low volume, could mean a good thing that the current price is not real"
If this ER doesn’t move the price forward I don’t know what will. Was anyone really expecting a pristine ER. Surely it’s more about the show of progression in the company.
Is everyone holding? Selling?
"Please correct me if I am wrong. Prior to filling form S-3 shelf registration when they wanted to issue $75m in shares the market cap was around $140m with each share trading above $12. Diluting shares with another $75m which is about half of the market cap, the fair price for each current share should be about half of $12 before the filing? Therefore we should see strong support around $6?"
Att: Historians! Can anyone recall any IPO that has declined as much or more than Blue Apron in recent history?
"If Linda announced just one more recipe, I think Aprn would go the moon! Hahahaha"
Let's bust through $12 today! Yeah!
I love 2021!!
The amount of customers alone means this is too cheap . But dare I buy more ?
"because Walmart has its hands full with its latest acquisition of Flipkart with the billions invested in that that's priority number one and by the time Walmart even gets the chance to focus on this they will be long behind in the race. secondly they're not delivering those great value meals, also more of a reason for Costco to buy the company if it succeeds in the test run. finally competition is nothing new to the apron there's like 11 or 12 others in this space outside of Walmart and apron still holds more than 30% of the market. that thinking is like saying Burger King won't succeed because there's a McDonald's. not to mention the over 300 million people in America that have to eat don't forget Blue Apron partnered up with Airbnb. so as far as competitive Advantage is they are linked up with Costco Airbnb they just receive the celebrity endorsement with Chrissy Teague and of course mr. wonderful put his reputation on the line in believing in this company as well could they all be wrong? of course one more little nugget is the online food delivery business is a 210 billion dollar industry I think there's plenty of room for a few players including one that holds more than 30% of that market and is poised perfectly for ""Tastee"" buyout!"
"Stock has gained huge, and huge volume again, there's got to be some news in the pipe. I believe they can turn this around and produce profits long term, but so far don't understand this jump."

"8 CLOSING BELL BUY,BUY,BUY"
The virus is airborne who wants to go to the grocery store this is the play for people to eat healthy food delivered to your door step. We are not going anywhere for weeks or months.
"BA management is lost. But at least they admitted up front they were not savvy at running a company. It didn't take them long at proving that and they kept demonstrating that over and over. Unfortunately it was at the expense of a lot of investment money. Simply adding a WW recipe to a kit to tell buyers how to prepare the food in a healthy way does not ring of a true partnership that will garner any turn around in the company. I have seen WW commercials; however, BA was not mentioned in those commercials at all. I have never seen a BA commercial on TV, nor heard one on the radio. They need to stop putting the bandaid on their elbow when it is their knees that are scraped up. Go back and find out where the downturn started and ask why. Keep asking why and making a list of the contributing factors. Ask why over and over until they get down to the root cause of the downturn. Then find the corrective actions will be and begin to implement them. Hold the folks accountable to implement those actions. Stop playing the birdbox challenge with the investors money in trying this and that when you haven't figured out WHY the downturn in the first place. If this goes back to the 60s, the only thing they will put in their kits is toast."
This is a joke. I hope a few investors can exit on this news but it's not like this is going to drive sales. Logic is out the window on this type of hype. Beyond meat should just buy APRN use the infrastructure to move product while the fake meat story is still hot.
$5.5 very possible before friday

This will fall between 4 and 5 then a Hedge Fund will come in when its around 5 and offer 7.50 which the Board will accept. Hedge Fund will then hold it for a few years saddle it with debt then give it a new name and a fresh coat of B.S. and bring it public again making millions.
Did not hear about Costco buy but now we are completing a cup and handle. Do know they are in Costco so should be very positive
Markets going red ...this will be back up
"Why, yes it did! ha."
buy on rumors & sell on news...it's just how it works in the market..It makes sense that folks are taking profit when the Q4 earnings are released.
"Good news to cheer beleagured longs: APRN's 10K is well written as it contains many ""out"" clauses. Eg: ""We many not be profitable"" and ""Management has limited experience in operating a public company."" What this means is a low probability of shyster lawsuits as the company tumbles into BK. Management has been true to their word that they may fail."
I think it is clear. Something is brewing. I missed the news. It is coming
we need volume
can someone please explain to me how the stock is down 28% today and the puts have moved 0%???
I saw that on cnbc .. oleary lokes aprn as a buyout target .. ill play along 500 shares at 2.14
why not buy now
yeah!
They should rename this company to Red Apron! Lol!
Anybody know of a company that will drop a box of unprepared food at my front door? or maybe for the same price I could just have a restaurant deliver it.
What a disappointing opening bell.
Hello CEO Mr. Dickerson. Need some info on stock price. Stockholders deserve better. This makes no sense.
Aprn having Back to Back Double Digit Paaaaaaaaaaaarttaaaaaaay! Yeah!
Longs support will take it over $14 by 2019 It’s very strong management with great marketing
Who said this stock will fly green today?
Ithink we could see $2 after market opens.
$5.50+ Longs ! Hold on your shares
Wake me up when it's green because it won't happen today most likely tomorrow or next week. It's at a perfect price to buy now.
tremendous selling. wow
Back to green
"APRN is hot right now due to the fear and the pandemic, this stock will soar again next week as there is more news coming about a ""stay at home"" situation possibly in NY and whoever is manipulating the stock isn't done doing so when it comes to biotech stocks and food delivery stocks. As soon as this pandemic slows down and the restaurants start opening, time to move on to the vaccine stocks. Long term this company will only strive if they do a partnership.Now the haters can stop hating because be grateful we have options for food delivery. Can you imagine the whole US population counting on Amazon and takeaways for food delivery?"
Here we gooo! Afternoon rush will happen shortly
Finally
The news says that they are considering options including going private.
Earning will be good. Hold it
Morgan Stanley just filed 13G that they own a million APRN shares now. Unfortunately their fund managers are not as smart as Dave and Fer.
"Someone mentioned before “ in a bad day it’s go down and in a good day it go down too”CEO is is not publishing any good news, maybe the situation is worse then it looks..."
"I'm pretty sure this stock will end in the green today, even when eveyrthing else is crashing. Coronavirus only getting worse, more people stuck at home, Trump sending checks, people can't eat their own food for weeks or months. New ""Corona"" users will use APRN for the first time and a % of them will become long term customers. I say this sadly but the worse it gets with Corona, the higher this stock is going to go."
"When Edith pumps, the stock dumps"
Nice volume. Shorts covering?
"I think it was just a fake with no news and no real volume. I believe it’ll work it’s way up coming into the end of the quarter though. If it is a real boost due to news that￼ that will be coming out soon then congratulations to the people that already held APRN. I do not, have been waiting for concrete news."
"APRN has traded below book value for months or roughly half its life after IPO. In my mind's eye, this has got to be illegal. Is there a watchdog agency that looks for these types of illegal trading? APRN is no longer a growth company and may be quarters away from showing a profit. But this is no reason to for the illegal trading."
Strange option action suggesting a near term spike. Someone buying the $8 and $9 calls exp Dec 20.
HI anyone know why APRN has earnings from $2.50 down to $1.30 estements looking more like the spirits r working on the anolist
"Next available orders being taken for Oct 7th. Hard to believe they will lose $18m in Q3. Pretty bad luck they closed that facility right before the pandemic. Still, I think they will be profitable going forward"
This company is done
if I set an order premarket and the price goes up before open should I reset the price limit?
GOOD FRIDAY TO ME
"Jeeze this stock,is frustrating. Thank goodness my Uber went up,Friday, it would have been a bad day. Again. Hopefully next week everything will bump up"
aprn destiny has been written long ago with their weak business model.
DONT BE AFRAID TO BUY NOW! It will hit 20 by the end of this week
Just picked some at 2.05 $. I think it will be in the range of 2 - 2.6$ until next quarter results.
People on this board have to remember that thousands of people here have purchased shares before reverse split and are still way down 30 is 2 dollars we are at 7.29
What’s new today?
6.72 divided by 15 is .44 cent awesome job let’s hire more new board members that do absolutely nothing
"Longs, hold on your shares APRN stays strong , solid gains"
Are you loaded guys?
Hope this pop
This new cfo was a phenomenal move the company & stock holders. His experience and KPIs speak for themself and I’m excited to see the q2 & 3 earnings with his advisory board. He’s a step in the right direction despite all the good things this company has going for themselves. They are either prepping for a buy out or just setting up the long term like most of us.
"APRN has enough cash to last them for over a year! CEO & CFO will figure things out. Ready made , weight loss , and diabetic meals are all coming next."
it will drop to 4 good earnings will go to 6.665 be right back where we started LOL IPO disaster no one trusts this stock or company no volume
I started investing with 15k. and blue aprn alone has got me up to 57k. worse case they take it all back with a bad earnings. on the other hand if it hits 10 plus again as it has on good news....
"Barclays is among the Longs investors in APRNAt this moment Barclay is pushing the stock down to cover all their shorts , then heads for upgrades $8+"
"Over $600M in revenues, should be profitable this quarter, and $86M market cap. Why wouldn't this be a strong buy? The 2 reasons that I can think of are that revenues are going down and they won't be profitable. Or the $150M in debt is an issue. Any thoughts?"
"Just bought at $25, should I hold overnight?"
"Interesting, I’d have thought that partnering up with grub hub to offer 30 MIN delivery to their meal kits was brighter and more time efficient than their previous ordering with delivery few days after. But then again, at times market moves irrational, and it takes it awhile to reconsider, then prices just move up."
"Don’t sell your shares....there aren’t many on the market and they are more valuable than you think. Also, don’t read negative posts....they don’t know what they are talking about and just trying to scare you. Same bums said this was bad when it was $2......and now it’s $20....don’t listen, just hold!!!"
To think this was up 4% premarket
it will be $2 in January
15-1 reverse splitWell done!
Halt again. It will go down more after halt
Still really only $0.61. Long way to go.
"Blue Apron (APRN) - Shares rallied on Wednesday, up 12%, as investors likely considered the implications of Americans being indoors for potentially the next couple weeks. As a provider of delivered food to consumers at home, Blue Apron is being considered a potential beneficiary to the coronavirus outbreak.https://www.benzinga.com/pre-market-outlook/20/03/15535038/benzinga-pros-top-5-stocks-to-watch-for-thurs-mar-12-2020-ba-apt-uber-aprn-chfs"
It makes one question why all the big shots sold so many shares off last week.
also Costco could buy Blue Apron with the profits they make in a day did the number one wine distributor in the country they are massive so this test run is not only to see if they given the stores but it's an evaluation getting close or we could say now we're cooking LOL
People are ordering more online now and that’s a fact.
Why doesn't the government create a similar company or just endorses this one and makes it go way up so everyone can make money?
"Wow, did $8 dude disappear? ha. It feels like they have a run coming up."
If home chef sold for that much than think Blue Apron could go for atleast $6 comparing the size of the two.
Aprn will do its thing but you have to be patient and give it time. Stocks dont always jump up with postive news right away but things are looking great for aprn.. think long term This stock will be back up in teens soon. I dont wana see weak hands here learn to hold strong I am in the red also but its going to go up again even now its consolditing with strong support it will hit teens this week. I also have shares of Dennys and its been pretty bad if not worse but cant sell at losses. Patience is the key folks and Blue Apron is a solid Company and a solid stock investment !
Will go back to 4 bucks! 
"Jim is a pessimist, Adamm is an optimist neither mentalities make $$$"
"Look at the definition of ""short and distort"". That is exactly what is happening with APRN right now. Once ready, they will start pumping positive news and take this back to $4 again."
"Gentlemen and Ladies, Mr.Longs and Mr.Shorts. Again good day for APRN, and good day for buyers and sellers."
Squeeze them lemons!
"painful week about to begin, will visit single digits again"
"Im stuck with my old shares. Cant sale, why?"
I don't get people recommending WTRH. Its price also went up x9 over the week. Why is it more rational choice than APRN?
Yahoo Finance needs an live Auctioneer’s voice when a stock goes insane like this!
Mid day spike.... then right back down to where it been living
"Blue will meet demand, huge, by march 30th. Any upgrade will have a take off and shorts are toast. This is a short term stock but it will surpass 30 next week and fall again."
Mr. Wonderful does not seem to be so wonderful now.
$7+ eoy. Mr. Wonderful doesn’t guess wrong. Good Luck.
The selling pressure is mostly computer algorithm related-- heavy shorting with little resistance. With hellofresh market cap at over 3 billion and blue apron at 80 million. It's a no-brainer hellofresh will try to take over blueapron.
"ER sum up: -losses, as predicted or expected. Nothing new in startups.-revenue beat estimates despite a year over year decline.-now for the part that got my attention: Subscriber number went up substantially, and existent customers have been spending more. The latter part is quite substantial when it comes to blue apron getting out of the gutter. Any other thoughts?"
Good time for Hello Fresh to make an offer for APRN
"be ready for $5s this week, then engines will stop and will just glide fast to $2 by election day"
I covered my $SNAP and $APRN shorts so I can hold as much $NVDA and $FB long as possible.
15 ON FRI
Monday will 3$
"might be the news you all needed, good luck to everyone involved."
"Every monitoring service is reporting huge customer increase in Blue Apron.Last week YouGov reported 2-folds, others are seeing higher customer orders. Kind of like hand sanitizers and toilet paper demand! Wow!"
"ahahahahah, Return on Equity (ttm) -65.22%"
Sell or hold?
"Box delivered perfect again this week, but one day late. Blue Apron sent an email ahead of time would be one day late due to ""higher-than-expected-demand."" Very professional of them."
What's not to like? Continued higher highs and higher lows. Touching the 200 day. Potential for short squeeze on positive news. More Costco locations rolling out. Possible new partnerships. Let's get some news? What's up with the AirBnB trial?
Any reason about this 6.40% movement?
"Time to load $4, $6, $8+*2019 $14++"
"Today will decide the future, $1 will be a big resistance, we break that then the tide will change going into the new year."
Load up! Bottom in place!
"Here come the cheerleaders, happy to get a few crumbs before b.a burns up completely..."
APRN good friday guys
I am lucky I bought last week 95000 shares .735 cost price tomorrow will 1.5$ hahaha
"Earning time, APRN will jump over $8+"
"Edith just saw Aprn closer to $2 than $1. Yeah! That's, before the Big O, has even started. ha."
"In my honest opinion, will never be an $8 stock. $5 max, eventually will be bought out by a supermarket brand or Amazon.Still optimistic that it will break $4 soon from earnings, teaming with other companies, and brand exposure."
"I think good chance it will break todays HOD and make a stab at $2.50..With positive News maybe a spike to $4.75 plus....Anyway, within a few weeks this stock will be closer to $4 ...Double todays price. Anyone stand for 100% Gain in 3 or 4 weeks time? Or is everyone just a Day trader here. I enjoy day trading the support and resistance but I am also Longer term as I intend to stay here long time"
Can you say bankruptcy after earnings?
im short at $1.50
But the short seller basher on Yahoo said it was all going to be over in a couple weeks. Doesn't the CDC and the current administration monitor Yahoo so they know what is really happening? https://news.yahoo.com/dr-fauci-says-america-getting-000524738.html
Could reach 30 dollars today.... GLTA
"We almost got 13 yesterday, today will be the the day. Maybe 14? Fingers crossed"
Not a single peep from CEO great leadership !
"Don’t panic, listen to the earning call"
"we get both hf and aprn kits, and aprn meals are eay fresher and tastier, so it's puzzling why hf is doing so much better financially. even cafeteria food co freshly has done better. weird."
"Basically APRN got targeted by the 'everybody sheltering in place will need food delivery' narrative by retailers. Shorts were heavily in so got caught flat footed. Short squeeze ensued growing massively. Retailers interpreted this as ""going to the moon"", encouraged by day traders on boards. But once the shorts were able to get out it stopped one boost. Retailers alone couldn't keep the rocket boosting. Day traders started for the exit, causing it to drop dramatically. New, excited retailers standing there holding an empty bag while the day traders made off with the loot. Retailers and short sellers feeling sore on the backside. Day traders win again!"
"I was a customer, quality food, small portions. Decided to stop because it is relatively expensive, and not a huge fan of the variety they offer. I mean Kale is good and all, but do i need it with every meal? Too much competition for me to invest in, but overall i would say a quality product"
It is going to fly again
pop champagne!!!.. congratulations to all longs.. who held tight..
Lock in profits as this is up on no news
Blue Apron stock looks like CVNA http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=CVNA
Should I buy the blue apron 2.5 call for 25 for two months I feel like I should easy money it seems like
You could literally throw a dart and hit a better company to short but yet you short one of the only companies that actually provides an absolute essential ingredients for life. Sure don't short AMD or NVDIA we need that It live. Lets short food in the midst of a potential nationwide quarantine. GL Shorts. I can't wait for that juicy squeeze.
Got to be a buy out coming at these levels. Probably Kroger .
FINALLY! Those of us who got stuck buying stock at $13 during the beyond boom can sell at a profit! Such beautiful day!
Who sold at 9.33?
Wow!!!!
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.law360.com/amp/articles/1249571 Is this true?
APRN float is tiny. Short scramble 1 bagger in a day. APRN to decimate $110 mil revenue next quarter and EPS and guide higher again. EBITDA getting better and better BULL
Made my first million shorting aprn and ino. I’m done with aprn. Thank you so much for buying my calls and losing it all. I love you all.
This is a good buy point. $6.60 is priced for a loss of $1.40 per share. I think they will do better and covid could be making a second wave.
"Looks like someone wants cheap shares. Well, they getting their wish, just in time for the ER. What a surprise. ha."
Shorts should cover. They will get APRN to $100 a share in 48 hours!!!!
"You guys thought I was crazy for shorting this at $6, then $4, then $3. Look at you now. I’m making a fortune while you guys keep trying to look for reasons and excuses about why this company is so amazing. I love it."
"I can order groceries online from my local big chain stores, have it delivered within hours, why would I buy overpriced meals from these guys"

Dave are you still here? Still thinking this is going back to 6?
it seems no one wants to take a chance either ways. I feel the bulls will catch on...
"Bunch of fake news with terrible articles. They are distorting what the management of the company has really said during conf call. Just read the actual transcript. The management is so excited with the another new partnership starting soon. Small decline in revenue is fine and they are now focusing on profits and the 1st q of 2019 will be the first q the company will make money! As a shareholder, that’s all matters. Big return is forthcoming."
when do buyers step in?
lets all go to WTRH today ans throw money there too.
"It’s a tough market now , decrease from .25 to .17 is a tremendous improvement It’s going back up $$$ soon"
"Should be loading up on Roku too. Staying home, eating and streaming media."
"Again, don't beat down the bid and help the shorts against every long. Let the buyers chase your sell orders."
So WW partnered before with Hello Fresh. Guess that didn't work out either.....
Win win situation for both company
Guess what's in 3 days! Yeah!
Saying this since $3.. this is an extremely over values stock. A 100 million dollar company at best.. which means the stock price should be around 50 cents.More likely situation is BK.
Thanks for the running scaredy-cat cheap shares this morning
Great price to buy more. Totally undervalued
Shorts float 29% percent hooolly
does anyone really want to eat food prepared at WMT?
12 tomorrow
People are realizing that going to the supermarket is not a smart idea where hundreds of people if not more are in a close proximity plus nothing is at the market shelves are dry and waiting in long lines taking hours. Blue Apron is going to disrupt the food supply chain safe nutrient packed food delivered to your doorstep. This is a mini me Amazon
What a recovery from the days low and green overall! $11 AH! Edith can't wait for tomorrow! Yeah!
"My only advice would be not to rely on opinions on this board to buy/sell a stock. You will constantly see posters pushing other stocks only to have you buy them, so they can sell and you are holding an overpriced stock. Best to do your own diligence. Good luck"
"When costco gets in @8 , it will get to over $14+"
$8+ coming soon. 
Is it true you cannot order because everything is out of stock?
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/opinion/covid-cooking-health.html
we just started it very good food
If Dean Foods can rally in Bad Earnings Aprn should skyrocket
"What moat does Blue apron have on its business compared to its competition?( Hello Fresh, Chipotle, Walmart and others)"
Down almost 30% for the day great Job management and a special thanks to Matt Salsberg
Nothing but red almost every day High of 28 in March now heading towards 5
"Hey shorts, how's your day going? ha. Yeah!"
Shorts covering big time now.
They will get bought out now for $4
Blue Apron is renewing their web site and mobile apps right now. Should be related to high demand I bet.
BUY BUY BUY
Seems like there is a marketing niche to ad a ready to serve plate along with the “do it yourself” menu for those that appreciate the high quality meals but lack time and energy to do the prep work.
One of our neighbors in our downtown condo gets a meal kit ever week. When their out of town they give it to us. It's is much faster and healthier than the restaurants around here.
From $56 to $6 they need this partnership to survive
"NO panic selling for me, hold the course..... Good PR stuff soon, blue skies..........."
Can you hear the shorts screaming???
hort interest From 2.5M to 1.6M and going green... Q3 will be better than expected and they don’t want to be there.....Hope we can finish today in green again
"Hello Fresh is trading at more than 2 times annual revenue. If APRN can reduce cost and with some revenue loss, its valuation comparable to Hello Fresh would be around $800 million or about 20X or more current stock price which is still less than half the IPO price which was $140. So unless you think they are heading towards bankruptcy (which I don't think they are), any VC or PE firm can step in to buy them for around $60 based on above math. You decide if you want to BUY or Cover your Shorts now? Epic Short squeeze possible!"
"Trump talking about a ""quarentine"" of the tristate area. New hotspots in major metro areas, Detroit, Chicago, New Orleans. All points to higher orders. I would like APRN to come out with a revised earnings estimate for this quarter. I think if they did it would help justify a higher price point."
"Buying back in today, with restrictions for Covid intensifying we should get a positive pop forward."
I would like to see a comment from the company about filling orders getting clients etc. Someone contact the CEO! Ha
Maybe if they take it private it will be better? I don't know... I just want my money back! (I want all of us to have our money back)
"Up 34% from my 7.15 average purchase price, hopefully we’ll see another 50% added to that this week."
GOOD DAY WILL RETURN----APRN
Looks like it may cross 10 today
12 coming
Wheeeeeeeeeee! Let's go!
Be greedy when others are fearful. Be fearful when others are greedy. I’ll add a few more Monday
"Consider this. NY and CA have ordered a statewide lockdown. All non-essential business must close. Imagine if this goes nationwide. BlueApron's business could be seriously impacted by a slowdown or pause in mail operations. Secondly, if 1 worker gets Corona Virus, they will have to shut down. And where are their two main facilities? NY and CA. Buy at your risk!"
Another green day. Hopefully this continue!
"I wonder what will happen when the new facility is open again. Hello Fresh is valued at $1.5 bil and APRN only $.6 bil? Something is wrong with one of the valuations. It looks like APRN is finding support around $3. I think now is a good time to buy some, but who knows? Seems to me this is worth at least $5 even with its recent troubles. Maybe people are cashing in the stock to take advantage of the IPO or are being shaken out of their positions because they bought at the IPO. I personally,like the concept, but I don't know how loyal customers will be. I suspect there will always be a lot of turnover. That is one thing Netflix, for example, has over a stock like APRN. Netflix is cheaper and there is less incentive to stop. Now, if these meals were already cooked and just needed to be microwaved . . . maybe that will be in the future.For now, they just need to get the company's act together. The demand has been there, but the execution is failing with the new facility. If they get it straightened out, which I can't imagine they won't, this could end up being a great buy here.APRN: $3.0802"
Now dogs can get the virus too? Who is going out anymore? Food and amenities getting delivered now.
"it would be cool if they changed their name to Green Apron, only temporarily like iHop, in the spirit of these massive gainz"
"At least, ba survived the week ok. I guess."
"Not going to lie, I YOLO'd this stock prior to Q3 earnings and lost about 50% of what I earned this entire year, even after selling at $7+. Lesson learned-- sometime you need to cut your losses to not lose again in 2020 taxes. Good luck to all who are still holding...I really hope they can pull this one off."
For what it’s worth - M and A activity will be picking up according to a couple of money managers I follow. Interest rates are at zero and private equity firms are flush with money. Who knows if Apron is shopping for a buyer? I did buy some KKR.
Price target up to 1.50 from 1.47 on yahoo and over last 45 days shorts down from 15 m to 11m
Pssst.... blue apron offered 200m plus debt going to 9.00 a share.
"We did not get our Blue Apron order yesterday. It was the first time I have been disappointed with the product. My family loves it. You don't realize how much you need it until you get it. It provides variety and teaches you about new foods that you like. You do get some bloopers, but I have found the food and recipes have far outperformed my expectations. It is more expensive than eating in house, but less expensive than a restaurant meal. But why did we not get our order yesterday? Will post later when I find out what happened. Also, I wonder if after a while we will have enough new favorites that we will just make ourselves. For sure, we have been very happy with the service in the month or so we have been using it. But how long will we want to spend the extra money (but not that much extra money and the experience of the food has be excellent). Now, this company is a service company and is supposed to make us feel good and positive. They will beat back the competition by their service. Cutting jobs makes me wonder if they will be able to keep a meal per person down at $10 and still keep the quality and service level high. So far, before yesterday's failure to deliever, I would have given them a 99 out of 100 as a grade. If they miss the delivery again, however, I would be quicker to try another service. I have no position in this company.APRN: $5.30"
The market is back to red now which mean APRN will back to green and up fast
13+ by the end of today watch it
"Hope for those who are heavily invested and hurting, that this run helps. I'm just not confident it will have any staying power."
"The announcement of these four new board members is most certainly timely, just ahead of Q3 reporting. This should bode well for Blue Apron especially from an investor's standpoint. Good talent from a wide variety of disciplines.One note of interest that caught my eye. Ms. Carr-Smith is noted as having Executive Director roles at among others, ""Australia-based Woolworths Group"". Now I have not had the time this morning to dig back into their online statements, but I recall seeing Woolworths Group listed as a substantial holder of Marley Spoon. Don't know if that is still the case and will have to look later."
$15 today. Fingers crossed!!!
$16.00 in Premarket trading????? Tomorrow?
Seems we may have formed a nice bottom up from here https://slatersentinel.com/news/2020/01/24/zacks-investment-research-upgrades-blue-apron-nyseaprn-to-buy.html/amp
Oh this Short Squeeze going to be massive! They just got a lil taste. ha. Yeah!
"I just started buying back today. Too cheap right now. If it gets cheaper, I’ll buy more."
I went long yesterday at 2.14 ... this thing has $3 in it's targets easy
The price increase is a result of Hellofreshs staggering 106% revenue growth in Q1. Lets see how APRNs numbers compare to that. Meal kit sector is definetly getting traction
4.85 divided by 15 reverse split 1 to 15 is .32 cent in 2.5 SHORT years from IPO of 11 dollars to .32
under $5 very possible today :(
We are finally reaching $1 pre-split. You can see the potential?
"Don’t sell it here , expectations are already so low . After earnings it will sky-rock"
Anyone with any math skills just need to look at income statement and balance sheet. Put your hard earned money in something else. Cash flow is negative and they run at a loss every year. Next.
"APRN has formed a couple of tri-bar patterns today in the chart. That is a good signal for upside. Once volume pick up over 500K, it will fly over $10."
Buyout or not its going up from here
Seriously some of the meals are sold out.
"$SFM $APRN Sprouts needs to go higher to new 52w high, at least was hoping for $20+, but seems to have selling pressure as this moment, Blue Apron is amazing so far"
Squeeeeeeeeeeeze Yeah!
Chart says going back to $7.5. The only thing amazing about BYND is the huge stock bubble. It's all hype.
I believe I can fly! I believe APRN can touch the sky...Chorus and repeat...Till the stock rebounds.... :)
Ibotta is givi a $50 rebate for new blue apron signups- they may not be saying much but I see their ads on fb all day long and now this Ibotta one I can’t add a pic
"The uncertainty of this stock can be best explained today. Green then red, green then red. Is the earnings already priced in? Not sure. Do investors think there should be a profit this quarter. Too much risk for me. I’m already out."
"APRN , management is working hard! Despite all the downs in Market and beat ups , Aprn made it so far to stay strong Beat , $5+April $8+*"
"Nice news for a change and most important, news that will generate more buzz - a much needed thing. Shorts should be looking for easier and less risky opportunities. We could use the break.8¢ a share vs. -45¢ (over a half-buck swing) ... nice. Also, considering HFG upped their forecast without customer growth (actually noted US customer decline) , APRN showing 5% customer growth is a good. MMM reported earlier this morning and reported strong earnings. They are profitable for the first time as well.Considering all things (in particular customer count and revenue), APRN's PPS should be at least in the upper '20s to just be on par with MMM. Well above 50 to be on par with HFG."
They are halting for shorts to figure out. If drops the same way they never halt. Evil shorts and MM.
The NYSE traders will need some delivery at home now too!

"It’s unfortunate and disappointing that they are struggling with manpower at their fulfillment centers, however that’s the reason they kept advertising to a minimum this quarter, hence the lackluster number of customers. Hopefully they will get a handle on labor issues soon, resume marketing efforts and boost customers and sales.On the bright side, results are better than expected, revenues did grow 13% y/y and it looks like the shares offering 3 months ago went well at a price north of $8/share so they have adequate liquidity to continue slowly improving and growing in the next few quarter. The prolonged pandemic is a tailwind and insiders have expressed faith through they share purchases lately."
"Hardly surprising, impossible burgers are taking the country by storm!"
With 22 competitors out there this will never make money reason why previous CEO was selling at .62 . Its in the insider selling which is public information.
Looks like we are getting close to the end of year end tax selling by institutional investors. Buy out possibilities and rumors and internal new management should have a positive effect in early 2020
REDDIT-TRADING COMING?
I am trying to think why this stock will go down even more but I can't. The supermarket is cutting hours as demand for food is high. Some people don't even want the hassle of going out in the crowd to get food. Everyone is ordering online. Could be groceries or meal kits. I think that major drop was all the pump and dump people selling out of fear of losing for short gains. They will buy more at closing and pump tomorrow's pre market.
I think the flexible menu options are great news. There is finally more communication about positive changes they are bringing to the menu.
Surprised to see this in single digits during a pandemic.
Whoa
"Honestly, I can't relate to some shorter and haters out there .I'm a blue apron regular, their food is legit. I consider myself middle class, foodie, and need to save money while feeding a family of 5 without breaking the bank. This service saved me so much time, some money, and my family loves the food. my teenager daughter actually enjoys it so much, she's been helping with the cooking whilst she's learning the important lesson of following instructions and enjoying the end result."
"With OIL going down, deliveries will be cheaper...cheaper deliveries, better profits"
This was posted to their Facebook page early this morning:
After 6 months of total silence...I just saw a BA commercial on CNN a few days ago. Hmmm...
If enough of us keep buying we will see the granddaddy of all short squeezes!!!
new CEO is well known in the e-commerce world. she will turn things big time with her experience and mostly connections. I'm sure that you will see increase in sale from now on as the advertisement cost will go down per order.
"Walked into the Blue Apron pop-up store on 23rd street yesterday, it was nice. They had some cool cooking stuff for sale as well as their meal kits in a fridge. They pulled one out that you could see how it was packaged. I was impressed, I'm not a person that would use this system (at the moment) but I did like how it was presented. I may go back over there and get an apron for $10. with their logo on it. Just wanted to share with everyone here.... if you live/work in NYC- go check it out- its on the south side of the street, but I can't remember which Ave it was near... somewhere in the middle 6th or7th?I may pick up more if it goes back to $3./share."
I wonder if we’ll see the classic big buys before the bell.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipotle-q1-2020-earnings-coronavirus-covid-201429208.html
Not many days left to see if Kevin O'Leary wins the CNBC bet . Mr. Wonderful picked APRN as one of his three gainers.
break out coming
Nice Pop should be 8$ by close
"Is it just me, or does anyone else smell a short squeeze on Wednesday?"
"This is why Blue Apron stock will skyrocket in 2020. Recent customer review on IOS App:----------I am blown away with the quality of ingredients, packaging, recipes and meal options from blue apron. I never normally write reviews, but our first 2 meals haven been so amazing that I had to commend the company on a job well done. The ingredients have all been so fresh, and I was shocked to see that the steak I received was actually farm raised grass fed organic steak! This is literally the most expensive type of steak you can buy. I figured they would send the cheapest, crappiest type of steak to preserve their margins. But no they sent the best. The ingredients are perfectly measured out, the recipes are beautiful and easy to follow . I can't understand how this company does it all so well. Seriously in love with blue apron.----------Great job Linda. Keep up the good work! Blue Apron shareholders like myself are counting on you."
no wants to take over bluethingy because anyone can replicate a money losing business model :(
Wow just wanted to get out today on the positive side. Looks like we will be opening sub $10 dollars a share 
Hello will buy Blue this year! it s not coincide Hello issue security of 200 millions when Blue issue 75 millions dollars security!. hopefully this sale high of 50- 60/ share!
"Sorry, but going to buy more"
And we still have a month to go before end of quarter. Management moving in right direction. Nice to see
Buy More $$$$$
"Too bad they couldn't figure it out. The food is good, its fun to make, but the cost per meal is too much."
New vaccine passes a critical milestone. So the pandemic should be over in the beginning of next year. Is this the end for APRN?
Yeah! Ha. In only a few days too.
I don’t need a red aprn I need a green aprn
This will be triple digits in couple days.
I bought more shares the food industry is essential and Blue apron is perfect for people that will be tired of fast food and the same ol groceries. It caters ti a specific market and now with the pandemic and the new normal this company will shine I am buying more shares its going back into the teens and please quit your complaining and buy more shares with me. The offering will help the company earn cash in the long run and the next er will be better . I made a tonf of money off of blue and its still swinging after this week I think ill average down a bit more and pick up more shares if it goes lower 8-9 is bargain prices watch how soon it will climb to 10's and 11's
I have this stock but you all need to look into FOOD - they are supplying Canada with meal kits - generating a ton of sales with the covid breakout.
"Remember logically DE Shaw bought at these levels not for what happened in the past, but for what is going to happen in the future. For all of us tracking APRN for a few months now, it was trading at $12 last Summer on a Beyond Meat partnership before COVID-19. Think about that. And HelloFresh has proven the business model for meal kits can clearly be successful."
"It is so weird to go down like this without reasons! , I don't see anything on news, could that be manipulation?"
Lock your shares up
slowest stock on the market.
I expect share price to drop prior to earnings in 2weeks. That said I didn’t think they would allow it to close below $1 after the nice run it’s had above that threshold. Still believe this company is viable and useful is today’s America with a growing value on the market of convenience. $1.50+ after earning call
I'm long on this stock not becuase they will destroy Q1 and Q2 estimates. That's a give in. I'm long here because this pandemic is the largest free advertising budget this company could ever have. They are bringing in masses of new customers who never used their service and a certain percentage will become long term customers. That's the long game here. Imagine investing in a company that currently has an unlimited advertising budget that they aren't paying for. Their cost to acquire a new customer must be now at record lows! Wonderful for profitability! That's why I'm all in and so should you. Previous performance has nothing to do with future performance in this stock!
What’s your opening price guess? Mine is 18
Wow! Was this thing actually trading at $140 a share three years ago! Bet that takes BAGHOLDERS' appetites away! ROFLMAO!!!
Earnings long gone. Let’s move this back to $10.
Headed back to ipo price
Buy this dip. Down with low float. It will recover back to above $10.

"All the fizz gone. I hope y’all took profits and left. This company is doomed to fail. Unless they have some better ideas to get customers hooked. Too much competition. Instead of setting up warehouses and shipping across the country, they should change their model to that of a service company - take orders and route to a local merchant, who will deliver same day. APRN - are you listening?"
"Just bought more 110,000 more"
Where is Dave claiming this would never fo above $6 again just a month ago? I insisted double digits were coming. And now I am telling you we will be back to $4 presplit after earnings. Just keep chilling on this ticking bomb.
At current price it’s a buy
GOOD NEWS WILL BE COMING SOON
Everything sold out on Blue Apron website! Hold your stocks
Upgraded by Me to $17
my $10 puts feel good
New tailwind for both HelloFresh and Blue Apron. Unfortunate for Home Chef.https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/home-chef-data-breach/
weight watchers to buy it and rebrand it as a weight loss program this will be huge
Time to buy
Ha! you two are sadder than this stock.
last time I bought under 300 I sold the next day for 321
"vaccine kills 2 birds with one stone, covid19 and aprn, PUTs are golden....."
11.5% up from the days lows?! It's almost as if it's all just speculative lol
"Among all the meal kits company, I feel aprn has done one thing that's right and could have really meaningful value, and that is, having been around for a few years now, they've established themselves as premier providers of really good food (recipes are pretty good but does not stand out as a differentiating factor as there are so many independent and cooking online magazine businesses that it'd have to be compared against). Reputation of providing really really good ingredients, so much better than hello fresh or sun basket or other competitors (with their vegetables shredded and oozing brown liquids by second or third day after receiving, from my experience). Butcher bundle is a first step, and I really believe many subsequent steps will follow, very quickly. They must execute flawlessly and with urgency this year, and I believe they are in a perfect position now and they can do it successfully."
"I read the ""edited"" transcripts of the conference call and had to laugh. Again, just words with zero substance of ""how"" or ""what will be done"" to achieve the results. Not to mention that they are thinking they will go positive and the investors will be able to see the results as they happen along the way......BWAHAHA,,,, how insulting.... investors won't be able to see any numbers or results until they are put up somewhere and by then it will be mid year or later according to them and those results will only be based on the few target areas they are trying their experiment on. I have still yet to see or hear any marketing done by the company other than what words they are spewing that mean nothing. Never seen a TV ad or heard a radio spot, so if they are marketing, they are marketing in very, very small areas and segments. So by the time the numbers come out to the investor, the investor likely has lost a substantial amount of their investment and won't be able to recoup those losses. But, the big guys have protected their positions with the family trusts and will pad them as they go along. Afterall, that's the end game, to have funds that are protected from the minions when the whole thing go teets up."
My average per share is $22. I sold all of my shares today @12.90. Glad I did now. This will be back below $8 in the next few days.
I think BYND invested in this company
This will go up after opening
"Sold this morning at opening. Hmmmm. Looks like I left a drop on the table. However, I bought in April and caught 30 + % gain. To all you longs; I wish you well. Me selling is in no way any sort of advice just time to find another easy short term high % no brainer value play. If this goes back $12 I will be back in and long."
"Blue Apron made $15 million on this day from the bank that they sold the shares at $1.15. They bought it to put more money into #APRN. Why would you sell? Also Weight Watchers #WTW had an overreacting sell off. Happened to Nvidia #NVDA, Apple #AAPL, and even Square #SQ. Don't Panic! Buy or Hold! Making money isn't easy or everyone would be rich."
"Wow, just went into the SEC dot GOV site and looked at insider transactions for APRN. Since August 25 there were 17 insider transactions taking place. For some reason, when you go into the Form 4 and then refer back to the presentation provided at Goldman Sach's it almost could seem that they already knew their lofty words would not help them out. Do you self a favor and go check the transactions yourself and then maybe someone who is smarter than I am (would be a lot of folks here) can tell me if I am reading the tea leaves incorrectly....."
offering price will be adjusted lower to attract buyers
"My hunch is that there are two profitable trades here: 1) Naked Short 2) Far OTM calls. And, there should be a way to combine positions toncreate a risk-free profit."
$AYTU is about to drop like $APRN. Where is @Chris? Should not have bought all of those shares on margin.
Anyone Notice Analyst Estimate of Earnings and Rev on Yahoo have ticked up a bit since yesterday when I checked last ...could this have been part of the reason for todays rally? ..and tomorrows? https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APRN/analysis?p=APRN
"As an investor, this is where you see if your investment pays off. News gets announced that we are moving in a direction of getting things back to normal. Carnival of all companies who is making nothing and losing everything goes up 10%. They’ve proven they can make money. Now is the time for blue apron to prove its worth. If they capitalize on their opportunity then look out. If they don’t, this stock goes back to $2. Speculation kills the cat. This is what you are betting on here. Otherwise go to a safe haven stock like apple or intel. This is why so low volume. Big risk = big rewards. What will blue apron do?"
What caused the drop earlier this week? Offering or short interest ?
So glad I added today. This company is one of the rising stars of the new social distancing reality.
Obviously sales are higher this quarter. Obviously people are buying higher per meal kit. Obviously more customers than last year. But don’t be disappointed when they don’t show a profit. Takes time for that. All other things have been priced in for the stock. Better loss obviously. Probably not profitable yet
"VOLUME IS LOW,INSIDERS ARE BUYING."
SOME INSIDERS BUYING WHILE SOME SHORTING.

Blue Apron lost COSTCO so its game over. Their financial coverup scandal puts the nail in their Bankrupt coffin.
Come on Oprah buy this company.
Love the squeeze!
"Aprn is the absolute best short. When markets go up, aprn goes down. When markets go down, aprn falls hard. When markets recover from a sell-off, aprn goes down. Why would anyone be long such a stock!"
"Took the first rocket ride from mid 3's to 15's and got off. I'm back in again now that the dust has settled. I've been a long term customer and was worried how they'd execute with the exponential growth. I read that a new customer was told their first meals would be delayed. As an existing customer, they are nailing it. Same great recipes, quality ingredients and timely delivery. They are presently hiring and putting into place the capability to deal with there new customers, while communicating well along the way. This stock was mercilessly pounded before Covid and with the business ramp up it's valuation has got to be higher then where we are. Plus we have a whole new pile of shorts on top for kindling."
"Today is a really bad red day and a dip was expected on days like this with all 3 sectors red and even gold and crude oil red you know its a bad day but dont be fooled it would be wise to use this time to collect more shares because red days only make green days later on and things will get better. So far we are on course back to 8's and keep in mind this stock has done $20's this year and can do it again or better, just have to give it some time wait for the elevator to head back up."
$4.00 here we come
Halts slowed this down. If not halted it's pushing $13 by now.
15$ on Monday
"Small beginner trader here, bought mine at 10.50, still hoping for it to go back up or to get even at least."
"$100 here we come guys. Low float, massive shorts, low market cap = EPIC SHORT SQUEEZE to $100, probably $200+"
It is on Reddit!!! Shorts you are so doomed this time.

How will shorts cover so many shares?

"@Dave, take an action as well if you believe this will go down. I purchased 8000 more shares at 6.50 because I believe this will double in price very soon. Short if you believed APRN will sink."
Started subscribing butcher bundles. This could be very lucrative for BA.
The impossible burger is the hot new food tech fac everyone wants to try. Adding that to the menu is sure to drive subscriber growth.
"I have been saying the same thing The Street article and O leary, state. The market is NOT recognizing the ""value"" of Blue Apron and its brand and concept. PPS should be around $5-$7! The are getting the growth and operation side squared away."
I would not be happy anything below 75$ !! I mean at least halfway back to IPO price... it wasn’t making money then and there was huge uncertainty on their path which is been cleared now !!! I just I don’t get tempted to sell in hope of buying cheaper and stay with nothing when it hits that price!!!!
"Although Consolidation periods can be frustrating, it will be worth it in the end! As long as this trades range bound of $3.15-$3.30. Completly normal and completly healthy for the next leg higher. Although I don’t think APRN will be affected by any trade war, overall indecies were under A lot of pressure Monday."
Be very careful here. Lots of lies flying around. I haven’t heard anything from the CEO or the company. Be very careful.
"With new leadership slowly being built at BA, I see lot's of future growth for patient investors at this valuation."
$300 stock at $12. No brainer.
wow ......one share will buy you one small cup of house coffee and a blueberry scone at Starbucks
too expensive at 2.84.. market cap is ~500 m. I'll buy it at 1.80 which is the fair price of APRN
"Major Wall Street Journal article over the weekend on Blue Apron (see below)!! As a comp, Home Chef was acquired for $700MM in 2018 (with a fraction of current Blue Apron sales). Sun Basket just raised $30MM at close to a $600MM valuation in 2019 (private company with a fraction of Blue Apron sales). And we all know HelloFresh is trading at a $5-6 Billion valuation. In the US, HelloFresh is #1 and Blue Apron is #2 with both Home Chef and Sun Basket behind.https://www.wsj.com/articles/meal-kits-thrive-during-coronavirus-lockdown-11588428000"
it has a possibility to reach ipo price with lesser shares. hurrah
This dog is going to 1.00
Anyone has any insight on what is going on. There is no news and it is free falling everyday.
"Actually, when you look at the prices per person, the cost isn't what I would consider unreasonable. It's one stop shopping from home. No door dings or cart scrapes in the parking lot, no kids screaming at the top of their lungs because they didn't get a candy bar, no wasting time standing in lines, no pushing a cart through crowded aisles, no bagger looking at you for tips they don't deserve, etc. And the big bonus the libs will love is: if you are an old school check writer, you won't have to show an ID."
"Does Blue Apron have only 2 fulfillment centers - Linden, New Jersey and Richmond, California? Wondering how they can serve the entire continental US with just two centers in terms of the shipping costs to deliver fresh food over such large distances."
Pumpers love to spin the truth just as much as the so called shorters
Good morning today will crashed again in red zone but looks green see what happen today
Market is green what the point
why the market cap is 1.5 b . it should be around 90m
"Sue all underwriters, insiders, and the private equity firms who had owned the shares before IPO. Thy used the IPO for the exit of their shares. The underwriters are as bad as these guys because they knew everything, but defrauded the investors for the lofty fees."
$APRN parabolic short squeeze here we come!!! Woohoo
"never fails....going up like gangbusters, then Edith chimes in. Sorry for piling on, but it's so predictable."
"Edith got nervous at latest drop to under 13. But, here we are back to $15. Let's see how long it takes to hit $20 now! Plenty of strength shown."
APRN order volume must be up huge in the last few weeks! Environment is perfect for APRN. Stay cautious and safe everyone.
20$+ by friday
All we need is some kind of statement from management and this might fly.
"Wow, over a million APRN shares traded after hours. This makes the total number of shares traded, today, 17.6 million shares, which is two times the number of outstanding APRN shares. I hope the buyers are holding strong, and placing sell orders expiring far from now and never changing those sell orders again."
Going to bankruptcy soon
$30 here we come. The momentum indicators are there!
what a joke of a stock please tell me one stock that has had a successful run up after a reverses split ????only 2 that I know of Price Line and e trade thats out of thousands and thousands of companies that have had reverse splits my biggest beef is APRN Board voted for the reverse split out of GREED Went from .60 cent to 9 dollars in one day after reverse split all the CEO and board members have a different class of shares so instead of selling granted shares at .60 cent they get to sell shares at 9 dollars so I went from 42 k shares down to 2800 thank you Blue Apron don't worry its a low float then after stealing shares they announce more shares to be sold at a special offering to dilute shares .

"APPLE, TESLA, AMAZON, making people Millionaires.. blue apron making bologna sandwiches... hahahahah"
People need to eat and don't want to get sick going out to shop. This really could be a $100.00 everyone I know is ordering it there completely sold out and hiring a new people to keep up with the pent up demand. 8 million shares this is going to go way way higher.
Bankruptcy liquidation scheduled for next Tuesday.
Every IPO during APRN was an absolutely success stocks have doubled and tripled since time of IPO docu sign roku Sonos all except big blue apron they have tripled in negative value SCAM
"Well well, aprn must be green cause I see the cheerleaders are active..."
I’m buying more shares at 66 cents. This will touch 74 cents before June 13 announcement. You can decide to sell before then or hold depending on your risk tolerance.
"need to capitalize on food catering for parties, and offer items people will pay a premium to have i.e., super bowl parties baked skinless chicken wings. go after one time customers in addition to the meal plans."
"Buying, time to add much more"
Blue Apron should be well into the teens and was upgraded to 18 a few days ago. Hold long and strong it will happen soon !!
"I just heard my friends in California said many cities lock down. Soon will be applied for many other cities. By that time, people won't able to by foods. Blue apron will be live saver for many families. APRN is hot stock now and next few months. Good luck people!"
This is what a daily chart looks like when Institutions start quietly accumulating before earnings. All aboard!!!
I can see 1.18/1.29! Today
It looks to Edith like there is no stopping Aprn $3.50 by Summer? Let's hope so! Yeah!
"where is chef yamauguchi when needed, pls crank up some new recipes fast!"
Curious why the new CEO is causing the stock to go up so much after hours. She that good or the old ceo that bad?
"Even good ER, in today's stock market, stock hardly move. Hope for the best but nothing big spike can happen tomorrow. Big fish killed it so many stocks even good ER, they control this market."
"Says a lot today that BA partnered with Walmart. Along, with pushing debt back. They here to stay. Still partnered with Costco too. Remember what BA told us. Partnerships. Edith think this just the beginning. Yeah!"
"Just because shorts push the stock down doesn’t mean the company is in bad shape. In 2018 BA built out their supply chain and eliminated wasteful marketing efforts that were not effective. Revenue sank on purpose and now the build is underway. In 2019 new talent - hungry to find success- has been hired and they are working on strategic plans to grow revenue in a profitable way. Anyone who understands business strategy and operations can see a plan is in the works. There are multiple simple ways to expand revenue at BA that leverage core strengths found in their solid customer base, strong distribution system and relented employees. Day traders who don’t know how business works will find a new stock to short in the near future."
50 $ next week if not more
"Blue Apron keeps saying "" investors we will be profitable "" if you just forget how much we pay ourselves even though we are running the company into the ground Want to Know Why ?? because Blue Apron paid themselves an extra 5 million in wages quarter over quarter pretty Ironic since the stock is 99.99% since IPO . Yet they keep paying themselves more and more money"
Timber! Reverse split coming soon
will this thing reverse split?
"YTD this stock is only down 5%. Had you held for a year you would be down 15% and if you held since the start(less than 3 years), you would be down 91%. Still hope, but not pretty. Even with 3 different CEOs and constantly changing management and boards they have not been able to fix this ship. The coming earnings (within a weeks time) will be do or die as no more excuses will help them if they do NOT perform in this perfect storm for food set delivery services (as the competitors show)."

"Noobie here, is it better to cut my losses here, or to hold on for a couple weeks if not months until it becomes profitable again?"
"Some of you are forgetting that whether restaurants continue to close or not, many people are in fear of even going out to get fast food or thinking more of convenience or without transportation. You must look at many stocks differently merely based off of this virus spreading. Your approach to trading or investing must be revamped until this bs is over. This will continue to spike upward as long as they drag this virus and city shutdown thing out."
Should be close in green today
Sold at 26 and now halted. Hopefully I made the right choice
"Uhhhhhhh. that dude deleted Edith's post about how going to grocery stores are at your own peril, when you do go shelves are wiped clean for many necessities including chicken and meat and rice. Also, that it's a fun activity for the people locked up together and the ones who vid chat. But, great post dude. ha."
About to go one way or the other but I’m optimistic it’s UP!
People-it’s a new industry...keep that it mind?
"APRN will have power to run another 300%-350% up tomorrow. As we know, most of restaurants and places are closed for dine in. This will affect all 50 states. People will rushing in to order meal online. Only Blue Apron (APRN) can handle this type of business. The demands are so high now. Many analysis predict APRN could reach to 100.00+ per share. This is very powerful stock to keep for long term. Buy at lower price now and watch it growing sonic fast. GLTA!!"
I'm a Carnivorous Flexitarian ….My thoughts is that the BYND deal only adds more items to the menu selection. APRN needs to expand overall membership in order to survive not SKUs...
I'm out guys at 15$ from 8.95. It's enough for me. Good luck all who stay
Fantastic close bulls 
Embarrassed to be a long share holder . Disgraceful it was all about the IPO making all founders millionaires 90 % of all the original founders have quit resigned or walked away with millions leaving millions of investors crushed !!
"Great timing, Zacks! Who is next?! LOL...APRN have a strong campaign against them, not to succeed. All the news articles, written still fail to mention the ""V"" word! Hmmmm. Yes, they have a very good argument for the lack of growth and on the technical side of things. HOLD"
Its possibly going up further beyond 3.2 ish
Shorts are going to lose their shirts. Waiting for the announcement.
"Blue is going to do the simplest and most logical thing. They will announce a share buy back. Hopefully, of course."
Tomorrow green
I jumped ship skooter... lost 2k of gains in 5 days 
$20.00 by close or very near.
"I just can’t believe it, green :00"
"Hey guys I bought this stock @7.68 since then I have seen it continuosly going down. I'm afraid that it keeps going down since I see this company a bit dead... everyone expects a vaccine by the end of this year and this fact won´t help. Even though the vaccine might not be used yet, I don´t know how this company will make money enough to get at 7.68 level. My question is then, shoud I sell it even considering the loss? Or should I have to trust it? Which are your thoughts?"
Sad...but bad business model will go nowhere but bankrupt regardless
YOUR DAY IS COMING.
Don’t go silent when it goes back up Bob.

"APRN was trading over $7 two months ago, I call bottom and a very good buyout opportunity."
"$APRN Seriously here, raise your hand if you think there's better than a 75% chance this will hit 20 by April."
HUGE HUGE volume. New interest in tremendous. This thing will double within 60 days or less!
Here we are the day before. Earnings set to release tomorrow 830am EST. Any guesses on the stock price movement tomorrow? Had a little bit of action today. I will say opens higher by 15% and trails higher then settles back a bit followed by analysts raising expectations. Ending price 7.20 tomorrow.
APRN $5+++ at earning April expect $8+
I totally understand people that short stocks that are high. I don't understand people that short stocks that are low. Like APRN. Today shorts getting killed.
Who is Mr. wonderful?
Still undervalued!
"Good afternoon all. Just a quick post -- I'm not actually holding any APRN at the moment. As I shared last time regarding Blue Apron, you would be hard pressed to find anything positive about the food this company is making. Their average rating is about 2 out of 5 stars with most people describing lackluster food, no attention to allergens, and not so great customer service. I mentioned on my last post reaching out to IR -- no response. It is possible (although bad form) that something is going on (pure speculation on my part), which is why the company is remaining silent. I think there is a much larger possibility that the IR department simply isn't very good or responsive. That seems in line with other departments within the company.To me it seems the last few days have been quiet accumulation. Why? No idea. Technically speaking the stock is now neutral with all indicators about in the middle. Understand that indicators typically lag a day or two when looking long term. Historically speaking when the company has 3+ days of price increase in the stock price, the overall price is about 20 to 30 percent higher than where it started -- implying it has at least a dollar or more to go. I would add that historically speaking this stock has gone down 3 out of 4 earnings releases in the past year based on the chart I'm looking at. With the impending presidential debates, I feel the market in general is a bit risky right now. I'm currently trading RAD short term and have made up most of my losses on APRN. I will probably be out of the market altogether in the very near future and will sit on the sidelines until we have a clearer path. Good luck to those holding... and for those shorting, probably should have already exited, but it seems there is upside momentum on APRN for at least the near term."
Shorts should cover immediately. We may have a 100% day today.
Vote NO regarding the Reverse Split! VOTE NO!
"I looked at the google trends to have a gues about the magnitude of the corona effect right now.The numbers are compared to previous year each:Q4 2019: -48% (compared to Q4 2018)Q1 2020 (until early March): -36% Q2 2020 (until now): +20%last week: +2%So with 48% down in Q4 2019 APRN reported a decline in revenue of 34%During Corona we saw a huge spice, but now we are only 2% up which could result in a revenue increase of about 20% right now (not at peak times). But this number is declining from week to week. So from Q3 on, I dont think we will see yoy revenue increase anymore."
Keep adding to my position It will pay off huge !
CFO resigned!
pre market looking slightly good 
14 @ 7:30 am $14 @7:30am$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
"I see nothing in this business, BKC is near"
Aprn be holding it down! Yeah. Can't wait for the Big O effect to really kick in.
"Non-GAAP accounting is not Bogus, or Fraudulent. It happens all the time by many reputable companies. Netflix for one. Motley Fool knows better. Their article smells bad!! Could someone on their BOD have a vested interest in spreading half truths and false hoods??"
time for 40-60% rally came. After 4 months of dragging down and 2 months of stagnation the stock started to breath. disclosure: bought 3.33. Sell target (50%) 6.66. Then we will see -if fundamentals improve I won't sell remaining 50% shares. In a case no progress everything will be sold out.
"5 days to cover short positions, OMG"
Should see a nice uptick today
"reverse split 1/15 , stock offering , they close facility in Texas just when they needed it the most , projected 18 million dollar loss for next quarter , good news though CEO bought a new Yacht"
Just Buy and hold I promise this will break its 52 week high of $18.00 don't get shook out
"PayPal is on agenda!$8+ , just hold on your shares , don’t sell and don’t settle for"
"When Motley Fools assigns 3 journalists to cover APRN, that’s pretty pathetic. I can see them in their research meetings discussing who will bash APRN this week. 2 articles in the last 4 days. Their famous quote, “So What Now...” I remember MF bashing BABA at $97! If I listen to them at $97, I’ll be $90 still waiting for $68 like they called it! Average down your shares, Linda is way smarter than Brad! When she reveals her strategic plan, APRN will pop again, and MF’s will be the one losing customers!"
Call your broker and move your shares to cash account. Takes only a minute. Broker cannot lend your shares when they are in cash account.
Way way oversold
"Comparative data is sparse but for the three meal kit centric companies that trade publicly and service the US (half of HelloFresh's & Marley Spoon's global market and Blue Apron's only market), here are some interesting data points (from Q1 ER's and converted into $US). Total revenues for the three were 1.22B with 5.9M customers.HFG's Q1 revenues were $794M (65%) with 4.2M customers (71%). MMM's revenues were $49M (4%) with .3M customers (4%).APRN's revenues were $376M (30%) with 1.4M customers (24%).During their respected ER's, all noted that they had a COVID19 bump in the last weeks of Q1 and expect a strong Q2. HFG just upped their Q2 guidance noting a 100% increase in revenue curiously on the same number of customers.Since the last weeks of Q1:HFG has moved up near linearly from the high $20's to over $60 (150%) before pulling back in the last week or so. Their market cap is $8.2M.MMM moved up in two jolts from $0.40 to $1.40 (250%). Their market cap is about $244M.APRN has hovered around $10 not including a few spikes and drops and is now at around $13. It's market cap is 173M.The market cap for all three is about $8.5B.So riddle me this.?If HFG's portion of the market is generously noted as 70% and MMM's is 5% with APRN at 25%, how long will APRN's market cap be just 2% of HFG's and less than MMM's?I suspect that were it not for shorts, APRN would be trading higher. Perhaps HFG is overvalued and I am not suggesting that APRN is worth 25% of the market ($2B cap with a $160 share price). I am not even suggesting that APRN is worth it's $1B IPO. But today, APRN should at the very least be on par at about $25 per share ($330M cap). Since all three companies do the same thing in the exact same way, it's safe to expect that both APRN and MMM will post solid Q2 gains perhaps better than HFG's. And while MMM and HFG have already popped and may likely pop again after earnings, APRN has yet to pop once."
"So disappointed. I’m not only long, but a great fan and user of the service/products. The quality and freshness I find to be a better value when I compare to the likes of hello fresh or supermarket prepackaged meal kits. Hope APRN can find its way to success."
Earnings Report around the corner Hold on your shares $5.50+++ Target this year over $8
A pic of Edith right now! Yeah! ha.
$8+ year end 2019 $14+
APRN is up 9.52% to 2.30

"Any longs from 2018 and prior, just curious what y'alls breakeven is? I'm at $2.50"
Where do you find info about reverse splits? I missed this and I sold 2 weeks ago huge loss! Lost over 19k dollars
$8+ buy out $14+ year end
As I said - mostly sideways until earnings. Fell a little more than I figured it would but it's in the ballpark. Give the options action I think being short before earnings could be very painful.
Blue Apron box just arrived again this morning on-time and exactly as-ordered. Based on WSJ article over the weekend it seems that they are now able to handle more capacity.
I like it drop to 0
Stock price way too cheap. Buyout offer coming soon. Bank on it.
Hello Fresh stock has doubled almost tripled since IPO blue apron has tripled just backwards never should have went public ohhh wait then CEO and board wouldn’t be granted all those free shares !! SCAM
Saw a BA add on TV this afternoon. First one for me. Cool I guess.
APRN is down 14.29% to 2.40
"Sells at 30%+- of sales, how many non trial customers. What is cost of customer acquisition? Possibly an acquisition. Otherwise closer to zero."
From falling knife to recovered very well knife.

That is the good thing hold it waiting for good news may be today
sell weed Aprn
"Edith B is the Pied Piper of Hamelin, or in this case APRN. If I relieved myself on her $250 hairdo, Edith B/Linda Findley Kozlowski, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director would post that the short term forecast is raining warm yellow profits."

"I got lucky. Nobody wanted to sell in pre-market so my order expired when pre-market ended. Evidently I forgot to set it up as a good til cancelled. Finally, a token of luck in my favor. LOL...."
Thoughts on where APRN will be tomorrow?
"Can someone explain the appeal of this stock? Don't get me wrong, I want to invest in this, but they haven't turned a profit in 4 years, negative retained earnings on their books, and The only reason their cash flow was positive last year was due to the issuance of stock. Don't these usually point to bankruptcy?"
"If you read Howard Marks, one of his favorite principles is that in general an asset's price swings back and forth like a pendulum along an equilibrium. The fact that an asset's price has been so low for so long, is exactly what causes the pendulum to swing back in the opposite direction with the same amount of force. Prior to corona, Blue Apron was going into cardiac arrest, but this pandemic has been like a defibrillator bringing the patient back to life. Shorting this stock is like playing with fire. I'm not even saying investors should be long, but being short this stock is a VERY risky proposition. Long APRN"
"people!, this is the time to get in...."
go to WTRH instead. going to make big gains in upcoming weeks
GOOD OL MR WONDERFUL HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA 
BLUE APRON still way under valued.Should be at least $6.00.
I bought some Blue Apron Holdings. Will see if I lose money or gain money.
LETS GO!! 20 dollars within this week
"this is called ""Wall Street Darling"","
"ahahahahah, bluethingy in the red? what a surprise"
when is the next report earnings date ?
Ridiculous concept. Just buy your groceries Or order them on Amazon.
Aprn up over 20% just since Wednesday and still going! Yeah!
"Don’t panic , stay strong ! Don’t let Shorts take control ,hold on to your shares"

Strong and long
"Hey, no matter what happens at the bell, Aprn had a profit, bested revenue estimates, and had a good out I outlook! What a great ER! Yeah!"
I love this stock. No end in sight yet. Just up every day.

hopefully they come out with positive news with costco... may hit $3 i meant $8 is too high
I sold yesterday at 11.88 bought back in pre mkt 9.97 
Montgomery Brewster aka “fer” is back to influence your short investment with APRN. Genius! If you are looking for investment advice via Yahoo you deserve to be swindled.
Just a thought. Maybe Blue Apron should merge with Hello Fresh. They could call it Fresh Apron
"$DRI $CMG $CAKE heading to 52wk high pre-pandemic levels, $WTRH $APRN heading to 52wk low pre-pandemic levels."
9.99 what a deal
"no where but down, every transaction producing a loss, so APRN has no competition for its business model :)"
Max chart looks awesome
Dip probably around 2 and then to the moon after that
They should change their name to red apron after this blood bath.
well under $4 before next earnings
"THANKS; got another 5,000 @ $2.95. See you at $8ish"
I think people would enroll for tailored meals with PURPOSE. A health purpose like Keto or Diabetic or meat substitute even Vegan or CBD more than just not wanting to shop for ingredients for a meal.
that's a nice candle!
this thingy continues its march to $2 bucks
$APRN started the new year pretty strong. Finished week 34% up. I believe this is just the start. 2021 will be a new chapter for company.
"Oh yeah, looks like we're gonna break $6 today. I'd like to congratulate all the shorts who are riding this pony down. Patience is a virtue"
"Don't ruin it for everyone, longs, don't beat down on the bid but let the buyers chase your sell orders. Four times all the tradable shares traded, yesterday, you can't lose here, because the shorts will have to come for your shares."
Rising in Premarket. Better Cover sooner than MORE EXPENSIVE
please hold
"Keep in mind: they only had 45m in the bank after Q2. When they drop below 20m, the bank can cancel their loan and APRN is bankrupt. Their cash burn rate before covid was 10m/quarter, so if they cannot improve massively, they have 25m + the stock offering money (which is not disclosed yet) left or 3-5 quarters."
Where are all bashers claiming this was going to $2. Cover your short positions now. We are riding this to $28 in a month.
"Flight to quality and strong balance sheets, and this company doesn’t pass that test"
"Is it just me but I didn't hear anything game changing today? The meal kit delivery business was never going to get to become a game changer without a catalyst. And this pandemic is that catalyst. Management has had the better part of a quarter to come up with a strategy to present today. If they discussed one, I didn't hear it.All I heard was the ""same old"". Improve this, focus on that, tweet this. Where is the initiative that will change APRN and for that matter the industry during a time when dining out and shopping might be life-threatening? They only have until a cure is widely available to figure this out. Again, what a missed opportunity.Terribly disappointed at the lost opportunity."
"VOTE NO for the reverse split!! Especially if anyone here is a Class B holder!!""In a press release today, Blue Apron said it was proposing a reverse stock split of 1-to-5 for Class A shares and 1-to-15 for Class B shares, which would be put to approval at the annual shareholder meeting on June 13. Class A shares are the ones that trade publicly, so investors should expect the stock price to jump by five times, assuming the measure is approved. Class B stock currently has 10 votes per share while Class A shares have just one, so the measure would give even more voting power to current Class B stockholders. ""Link to the article:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-blue-apron-stock-falling-162000290.html"
popping up guys
Doesn’t matter there’s a lot of shorts in this stock check short interest will make another spike up shortly
Volume yesterday was just a bit over half of the average. Small order trying to move the price up. Today is free fall Friday or profit taking Friday. Guess what will happen!!
I don’t think a positive pr is needed to move this stock price higher. Just the fundamental will shoot this higher. Mngmts are moving this company to become more sustainable therefore the future is looking real bright.
"Hardest and Saddest week for America coming up and obviously some want Aprn even cheaper before the news starts rolling in with the numbers. This week will be very psychologically negative for most and that means green for Aprn. Wish it was the reverse, but at least, Aprn providing an essential duty to help. Be safe everyone and stay away from them grocery stores, if you in hot zone like Edith is in NY."
"Blue Apron stock seems less then half of Hello Fresh stock, if BA start operating like Chipotle then its stock might become half of CMG, omg lots of money!"
"Tic toc tic toc, Back to IPO valuation is on the horizon. Easy $5B acquisition target by Amazon or Walmart."
What happened to all the money when they laid off employees and closed facility in Texas oh I know they all got raises and more free granted shares
will trade around $4 by september
Nothing has changed. This will recover to presplit $1-$2 level really fast. Wait for upgrades and institutional buyers. Just don’t let shorts convince you to sell. This company is finally turning the corner. Hold and stay strong today.
I am a buyer again at these levels. First ride from $2 - $16 was nice.
I am happy to green for the past several days but I don't know why. There is no news. I don't know who is buying the shares. Can someone illuminate this for me?
"Running out of money again....but BOARD keeps collecting big fat paychecks, keep renting out huge office space in Downtown Manhattan , lets close facility in Texas at the worst possible time lets dilute shares with another offering . Adds ONLY 20 k additional customers during the Corona . Great Management"
"APRN , Jan $3++ April $8.50++This year target $ $13++Hold on your shares , stay strong and don’t panicIt is a great opportunity to make huge $$$$$"
Check Blue Apron search trends on Google. Stay strong longs. $150 day will come. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1584484200?hl=en-US&tz=420&date=now+7-d&geo=US&q=blue+apron&sni=3
Back to 3-4 tomorrow? Won't see $10
In on 3.5$ 2K shares. Sell on 25.3$. Now i buy back at but only with 1/6 of shares 13$ 300shares.
"Demand is surging for meal delivery kits during this pandemic, and now is a great time to buy shares of this stock (a PC Editor's Choice). They're hiring staff to meet the growing demand during a shutdown which may last months, not just weeks."
"All the restaurants in my area are innovating and offering gourmet meal kits with fresh local ingredients to make at home with recipes. Support your local businesses, not some corporate hacks. Now thats a unique business model"
Costco will buy out tomorrow.
I don't know who is selling at these prices but I think that selling now is nuts. The DoorDash IPO was a huge statement. Enough to kick Marley Spoon (MMM) up 17% overnight and HelloFresh up 15% as they near the end of their trading day. If there is a company that has uptick potential APRN is it. WOW!
FYI wall mart meal kits will be available in 2019! Lol
Has great upside. Added for long term!
"Major owner of Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. was just granted 192,723 restricted shares"
"I truly think Blue Apron game plan is BK loans will be paid off leases renegotiated debt reorganized after BK they will be a stronger company just not a public traded company which they could care less only explanation for management , no pr no statements the strangest stock offering ever witnessed offered at 9.25 stock drops to 6.50 oh it wasn’t a stock offering but a short position sold everything about this company is shady"
There is a chance today for APRN to make a new low. Right now it is sitting at .46 pre split share price.
Shorts selling at $7 (which was a peak just a few weeks ago) are quickly waking up to the reality that APRN isn’t going to fold. No doubt some chose to cover quickly. That was the smart money. It only gets more expensive now. And Feb. options expire tomorrow. Could be an interesting day.
What a ride!
"One thing that experience has told me is that, when a stock has momentum like this, you do not short. Yeah, it may be the same #$%$ company, and any rise in customer base and revenues is probably temporary, but let it go for now.Just be patient, fundamentals rule in the long run, but not always in the short, no pun intended."
FAAANG. Facebook Apple. Amazon. Aprn. Netflix. Google. Yeah! ha.
Today we had a great chance to sell in 14's right now it will go back to 9's maybe 6's again
So far I am happy with my Blue Apron investment. Has held up very well in $3 per share range last 2 weeks. I hope will go higher coming months also even higher next earnings report.
worse everyday
Should I buy in at this time and go down with the ship hoping for a buyout?
"Yesterday I sold all of my 12000 stocks of APRN with loss of 3500 USD. With another win with APRN of 1900 USD the loss is not that huge. Sorry guys, but the Game is over for this toilet company. They had years of head start and grew to fast. Without improving and solving their logistic problems. Now we have every week a new competitor, what means that market share is decreasing for APRN. The deal with airbnb is only a nice marketing action which will not turns into real profit. Take a look to that analysis on YT. It says it all about this company, led by millenial talents from elite universitites without any strong background in entrepreunership. How they can come to the idea to invest into a cow ranch? They should know, who they are and what their general purpose is: food logistic and putting ingredients together. And not to buy farms which they have no experience. Complete wrong investment. Now the new competitors, all of them are high experienced in logistic and distributing. Not a good signal.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpQkAEei08w"
Extremely undervalued. If management don’t screw up price can easily quadruple from here in a month. Things finally getting better for APRN!
"Am happy I held on to my short through this disaster of an earnings call. It as do or die, and now it will burn through remaining cash in a few months and MAYBE sell it's email contact lists as part of their final, utter failure as a company. Best of luck to all. "
Today is a bad day...... for shorts! Oops
Hanging there see 15 this week.

APRN is finally on the track to recovery. This will be a similar story to SNAP. Future is brighter than ever before my friends...
Back to $10 to consolidate before heading over $20.
Biggest volume in six months. Something has got to be up.
20 NEXT WEEK
The people working at the distribution centers or warehouses for blue apron need to organize what they throw into the boxes based on menu. If you order a variety of menu items yet they share an ingredient albeit with differing amounts the box will have everything thrown in together without seperating said ingredients thus ruining the convenience factor of buying through blue apron. Minor inconvenience but enough to steer consumers to other brands
LA tech investor eyeing Blue Apron purchasehttps://nypost.com/2020/02/27/la-tech-investor-eyeing-blue-apron-purchase/
"I figure APRN is going to be trading flat for a bit, while the buyer shakes out shares from retail investors, so he can reduce his buyout payout. It happens every time before a buyout. Only $20 million shares of APRN are trading, so it might not take too long."
Volume is restraint. They solved their biggest problem of findin/retaining customers by partnering with Weight Watchers and their price is way up since Oprah got actively involved again.
"loses money with every sell they do, what a business model ahahahah"
Kicking myself for not buying back in at $1.02...
Weight Watchers is up today. This is holding well compared to the down market this last few days.
"This is the one to get, it requires no human contact to get meal ready food"
"As a short term solution to stabilize and strengthen its position in the meal kit market, one bold idea is to acquire a smaller struggling competitor. A win-win."
You know whats really worrying? A few months ago APRN said yoy growth will return in the second half of 2020. Now even that is not a target anymore. So be prepared for another year with double digit decline in revenue. This makes it even harder to turn a profit in the forseable future.
WMT Buyout Eight Dollars
chart is showing a bulish flag
Excellent news.. can u say.. short squeeze
Zacks upgrade
Happy now .70 buy to a buck 1.20 is my goal at least
"$1.50 by June 1, according to my cherry pie chart !"
"100% ghosting gong on today. Im a day trader and all my days trading are videotaped so I can go back and review my trades just like football players review their plays. I just saw a ghosting going on in APRN, meaning that the market manipulators stop a stock from going up by blocking it with huge sell orders, then they pull those orders once enough buy orders build up pressure, then the stock jumps up. Classic manipulation and SEC violation."
just people taking some profitgood bounce up
Bill Gates was on cnn and said late May early June we may be able to move around freely. That’s 2 more months of scary times and people not wanting to get out. Apron hopefully rises to the occasion
Great volume is picking up might be 9 million today the way it's going
"great opportunity to buy very cheap, will come back next week, cheers"
I'm surprised BA does not accept packaging materials back from customers. I emailed support they said they discontinued that option. I would really like to be able to return a lot of stuff for them to reuse. Not good.
Panic sellers giving it away.
Notice how the puts didn't move today. Options traders already know this is going right back down
this volume have something to do with yesterday investor meeting?
"Still Holding. Everyone saw the earnings and don't need to say anything on it. Like my posts before, the industry needs to be consolidated and APRN need to diversify their approach to consumers. I don't think Costco will buy Blue Apron but think they can extend the partnership. Good Luck"
"when aprn was at $2 no other company wanted to touch with 20 foot pole, why would someone buy it at this bloated level? thats why there are no takers for the class A offerings..."
I think when the earnings come out in July it will be a blowout quarter. Should be large gains between now and then.
I urge all shorts to cover. This will repeat $30 move happened last year.
We have earning date... 29th
My 2.50 put wow
HelloFresh at 32 today... that’s without a 15/1 split
"""Whaaaaat uuuuuuuup""I hope it's the stock"
Let's not forget the same thing happened with Etsy when Amazon created Handmade. Etsy since rebounded and no one talks about Amazon Handmade. Not everything Amazon does is a home run. I'm not an investor of Blue Apron but anything below $5.00 and this thing might be a takeover target.
"some of you don't understand how the market works with stocks like APRN, which have failed to meet expectations several times. Are subscribers up in second quarter? almost certainly. But, the first quarter was going to be business as usual, meaning disappointment. The stock tanks, the short elements drive it down, cover before next reporting, all while funds and hedgies accumulate cheaply and then it pops. If you are long your best course of action is to average down when the carnage subsides."
They were going to reduce spending so no surprise of losing some subscribers. What surprises me is reduction in expenses by far and this is a positive for the company. Hoping it go up
Stick a fork in ba cause it's done... They are comparing this year with the corona to last year pre corona!
"Wondering if we will have a pullback tomorrow, hopefully it just keeps going up though"
get back in now....
"Thank God! I thought I was going to be stuck with this turd forever. Unloaded everything today, and happy as hell to get out.This 'news' might be enough to make APRN pop today, and might even improve their bottom line for a little while, but at the end of the day, this isn't a particularly good industry in my opinion. Anyone can make meal kits. APRN isn't special. For those of you that are long, best wishes. I'm out, and will never look back!"
APRN & WTRH
"Yep, not a bad earning report and stock price is down but they're still paying themselves the big salaries and bonuses."
"This is my first time posting, i have been watching this stock and been in and out of it since July and i have to say this has got to be one of the ABSOLUTE WORST picks of my whole life of doing this I'm down almost 50% and after today's earnings call there is not a miracle here, and to be realistic with a buy at even $2.00 a share it's still not close to what many have lost here with this stock, and a buyout would only cover some of the loses for a majority of us.... the next day we get a little pop upward I'm out and not looking back, this is a good market with soooooo many better companies to invest in, time to lick your wounds and move on and accept it's just not happening here...."
This company will be bought buy a big player either Walmart Amazon or Target. There’s no way they can survive on their own with the amount of demands they have.
"Yes, it's doing well because of Covid 19, but Covid ain't a short term thing. This could be a 3 year situation, so eventually this stock will thrive or others like it"
i'm buying more here. thank you. these substantial price dips on low volume are a a great buying opportunity.
Only 13M shares and 58 tutes onboard. This stock could double in the blink of an eye.
"Full disclosure. The people that say ""Full Disclosure"" are Full of something else entirely. ha. Present company excluded."
"Costco can easily buy out APRN at $5 pps, would be a 1 billion sale, that is nothing for Costco. Current valuation is too good to be true. Easy two bagger here. GL"
Blue Apron was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research note issued to investors on Tuesday. Too bad my limit order didn’t go through on Monday or Tuesday. This thing should have very good day today!
this thingy primed for $5s
"APRN , earning time , get ready for $8 +"
APRN has so much potential for growth.$8 buy out 2019 $14+
Does anybody have any idea what is going on here? Either this is robust manipulation or there is some bad news
Just out APRN is ripe for an acquisition. Most likely Tyson Foods or Campbells.
$WTRH is riding the same wave
Why is this stock going down when earnings are up?
"Anyone else see Aprn drop like 37% AH? Edith got really scared for a second. Then, it was back at 3.5% gain. Was it a premonition? Hope not. ha."
I bought this at $3 1500 shares when I saw an email that jack in a box was closing dining in Tuesday. If this thing goes to 100 bux cash out pay off my house loan it's crazy. If the market bounces tomorrow even jump faster.
400% up on a 1 Week investment. Cash in folks. Stay with cash and resist the temptation to get in.
Nothing says let's order an overprices box of $60 with rotten products like 3.3 unemployed. Buahahhahaahah
LOL
"quickly, get chef yamaugichi to save the day!"
is BYND buying them?
Something is brewing. Wake up and smell the coffee!
"This was a trade,not an investment folks"
Going to buy back my shares I sold @16.00 yesterday for 3.90.
APRN $8 set for this year 2019 $14+
all in on BA
Let’s get this babe to $20 today. Shorts will pay!!!
"tomorrow cements itself in the $5s, then when earnings roll in it will test $3-$4"
APRN to $25.00. BULL. Shorts fry
"Every day starts up, then drops immediately, then goes up, and then drops below the open all before 11am and without any new news. Then APRN comes back strong, usually with an early afternoon dip, and ends closing up a buck.Wash, rinse, repeat.And ... in order to stop this cycle, shorts need to be cleared out and that won't happen without a dramatic jump up. And ... that type of dramatic jump won't happen until some entities figure out that APRN is cheap. And ... that might require news or reporting. So maybe it will have to wait for the ER next week.Or maybe someone at CNBC starts doing some math. I tried to draw attention to the meal kit industry in emails to them."
Manipulating what? The partnership with Walmart? Costco? The idea is to eat healthy and have some fun doing it. They have a nice set of customers that may disagree with you. BA untwisting at the moment. Pushing debt back was good sign to Edith. That haven't given up. Yeah!
"the bad news is out and is already priced in. at 9$, it gets attractive to institutional owners. with a low float, shorts will lose their shirt. the move feels positive. looking forward to the next trade..."
finally got my price I'm out
"I bought this stock at $10 right after the IPO cuz I figured; hey a small unprofitable company with an easily replicated business model with low margins, huge upfront customer acquisition costs, and massive competition, how could you go wrong? So far I’m only down 85% in the last 17 months, so I’m wondering, when do they get back to $10 so I can sell?"
I loaded more at $1.99 
How high will this go
"Yessss, three times the number of tradable shares have now traded."
"We can’t have enough maintenance the once will always reflect the difficult, but logically stocks that have grown earnings per allowance strongly in the subsequent to are a fine bet to continue to take effect as a result.Analyst’s mean target price for the company is $4.92 very short term"
That's why He isMr.Wonderful 
20% haircut is a little extreme. Expect a bounce back during earnings call.
$8+ this year 2019 $14+
aprn ready to soar time positioning load up will sky rocket a lot good news
Eight million shares outstanding and a market cap of $162M. This stock could easily double on the first release of positive news. Don't get scared out of your shares. Hold out for the pop.
"NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS,SEE 20 NEXT WEEK.MUCH BETTER THAN TESLA"
I'm tell you guys what's go happen. with this weight watchers deal this is a gold Mine*. we going to hit $1.15 next week easy heading back to 3 dollars
its current market cap is 90 m$. it has 95 m$ in cash. this situation makes no sense. it has ebidta profitable and has a growth plan. any news will double this stock. load up. it's cheap
After lunch there will be a rally They are trying to clear people out for cheap stock.Stay Strong 
Mr. Wonderful(kevin o'lreary) picked aprn for his 2nd pick in the cnbc challenge! woohoo
Do you think selling meal kits in stores will help? I am trying to image my self choosing between buying grocery that I pick with my hands and buying a box that I cannot see through. If this news is the reason for today's price action I am out and I will try to grab more shares close to $2.00 again.
Congrats to all longs! Looks great
"Looking good, getting ready for the plunge!"
Oversold. Heavily shorted. Buy!
"Oh my gosh. I expected 20 dollars in a week, NOT IN A DAY!!"
This will burn a bunch of new shorts just like BYND. It will defy gravity and any reasonable valuation. The crazy BYND investors will drive this to $50.
"It should move at least 15% up from here. Earnings improving, new CEO ... looking good!!!"
"I couldn't understand why APRN was partnering with WW when WW was losing customers right and left because of PC folks crying ""fat shaming."" It did not seem to be the smart thing to do under the circumstances. Guess now it has come to fruition that it wasn't well thought out. They are too quick to jump from one pilot program to another and are trying gimmicks instead of concentrating of what caused them to start going downhill in the first place."
Wheeeeee! Let's go!
"I know this gets downvotes but at least read the whole comment!Why Blue Apron will still fail to compete with Hellofresh long-term:-Hellofresh is just more efficient (higher margins, better just-in-time without stock)-Hellofresh has better customer reviews and more recepie chioce-Blue Apron was on the down-path, they need to reopen FF-centers and ramp up again with huge marketing expenses when corona is overSo the question is: Is it enough to be nr. 2 or 3 in the US? Is the corona lockdown long enough to find a path to continous growth and profitablity."
"Long term bullish. buy an hold for 3-6 months, this stock will be $50-$75 range.many restaurants will not survive even after the pandemic blows overconsumer shopping habits will change. more people will cook at home, and look for higher-end cooking options. Many new home cooks will try Blue Apron for the first time. Blue Apron is well-positioned to capitalize on the new trend."
Back up over 2.00 today
"""Blue Apron"" searches on Google Trends are literally through the roof. Consumers are all in on Blue Apron. Can't seem to post google links, but just go check it out for yourself."
"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pushed back hard against the idea raised by President Donald Trump of easing restrictions from coronavirus mitigation efforts in an effort to revive the U.S. economy.“I understand what the president is saying that this is unsustainable that we close down the economy and we continue to spend money. There is no doubt about that,” Cuomo said at a press conference in New York City.“But if you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy then it’s no contest. No American is going to say ‘accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,’” Cuomo argued. —Dan Mangan"
Up up back to 20$
Surprised $8 dude isn't back. ha.
Another Green Day....I wonder what is on the horizon?
"Company rebranding, now called Red Apron"
Nice movement north now. Tomorrow should be epic
it Apron close above $3 .. we hit $4.5 before 2 weeks
When APRN pops it will be more than a buck. Marley Spoon popped near 18% today - nice. They report next week too.
"Fer, Where are you with your bashing of the APRN ""bagholders? Hiding again today? Remember, I can see you. I know you just gave another thumbs down to ""KIRK"" on his explanation of how China is the 2 nd largest economy. That was at 10:10 EST. Would you like to give a price update to Ic and Stockrobot? They are curious as to when YOU want them to sell and short with you before it goes to $2.00."
Buying the dips. Earnings positivity will eventually settle down and we will cross that $15 barrier.
"Report is good, why red??"
Even Amazon would be interested compliment its grocery business
"Hellofreshs CEO told a german newspaper that they expect to grow revenue by around 50% in the US in Q2 YOY. How is it possible for Blue Apron to loose customers and revenue in Q2, will the industry is surging?"
Very technical bounce. Going green w
https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/26/stock-draft-second-round-picks-disney-blue-apron-and-more.html
Edith glad Edith picked up more Aprn on Friday! Yeah!
Tanking hard
"Good volume, today. Do you know how many APRN shareholders there must be for all traded shares? Can we get 10,000 longs in the house."
how many ppl still holding on aprn? thumps up of you do please.
"Hellofresh reported yesterday, that their revenue in Q1 increased by 70% compared to an expected increase of 50% without corona until mid March. So the last 2 weeks of March were responsible for 20%p upshift. So the revenue must have doubled at least during corona. I think the same should be the case for Blue Apron, if Corona is a thing until May/June than 200m in Q2 is definetly possible."
"PTI moving up: PTI PTI-129 drug pending Gov't funding news for June 1, 2020, ""Proteostasis Therapeutics' PTI-129 a potential COVID-19 candidate"" also PTI August milestone on Cystic Fibrosis results.... PTI under the radar trading at CASH, NO debt, NO warrants...longs also $APRN $NFLX $PTON $BABA $IQ stay at home stocks during COVID-19"
Big short squeeze coming. Buckle up. Will surpass 30.
I call it free money!!! It’s going back up without a doubt.
"Blue Apron never seems to catch a break its been shorted since IPO and since management has no clue , no PR , no announcements where is money going the raised ?? they do a 1/15 reverse split then dilute shares comedy of errors yet new CEO receives 2 million in stock options they hire multiple new board members for what ?? most over paid CEO and Board in America . Wasting money on leasing huge office in Manhattan for what ?? of course they don't own the the building ... It was all about the IPO making founder members and early investors rich what a huge scam .....Maddoff would be so proud"
Buyers lining up
"I've been holding APRN since last April so I'm super happy today. However, does anyone know why this is up so much today?bought @24 thinking if i should cut my losses and run today"
"Sell side shares are getting scarce, shorts. You have overstayed your welcome. The shareholders left here are strong hands."
Things are going bad in stores. 40$ coming
Don’t sell Load And wait APRNSoon $5.50++++By April $8.5+++Target $13+++
"Nobody does research, thats why you lost money. Terrible concept from amateurs who had zero food experience. ZERO. They thought they were smarter than real restaurant people who could have easily done this years ago but were too smart. A bunch of phony college kids think they are smarter. No food experience, no management with food experience. Yeah, thats gonna work. Negative cash flow since day one. Can't keep customers. No leadership, just a bunch of kids who think they invented the wheel. They invented nothing, concept is stupid and was something a college know it all would think is great because they are not in the real world. Restaurant guys with experience could see this as a scam right from the get go. Apron has no value and will be bankrupt and sued by summer. I warned people on this board a year ago to get out. Now its too late."
Easily will reach $12 and some change by EOD.
Back to reality
"We dumpster dive below $1.00 again on a day the market is zooming northwards. #$%$? And as usual, we hear nothing from management. Not a peep. Methinks they don't care about the stock price. They should go on the media sites and say something positive even if they are stretching the truth. We need something to support the price."
There is almost no resistance between $8.50 and $12. It will come quick. Cover you short positions or ride the pain.
"Checked the SEC filings again. Yep, still NO shares registered for dilution. Shorts are in a big mess now, but we need strong longs to place reasonable profitable sell orders expiring far from now and never change those sell orders again. https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=aprn&owner=exclude&action=getcompany&Find=Search"
"All futures are up. Let us see if APRN can use that to head higher.I am currently short, but best of luck to all traders! I will cover my short to lock in profits (from about $13) with my trailing 5% stop loss if APRN finally wakes up..."
These popup shops could be a nice lift in customer base. I've seen other smaller companies use similar like ideas in success.
"I remember several months ago someone posted they sold all of their stock because they couldn’t take the pain. Soon after, APRN went from $1.85 to $4.00 in less than three months. Don’t panic sell."
"Grant, don’t do it. It’s not worth the gamble"
Next trick is to put menu on blockchain...let's work that angle
Nice recovery back over 1. wtw concerns ebbing and the bull story will reassert itself.
It sure seems like there isn't much downside- an acquirer would likely pay the current market cap or more. Thoughts?
"I bought 10k shares @ $7 then another 10k today @ $4.39 - company has an execution issue but one of the best products in a hot category where a $1B acquisition took place on Friday, improving on several metrics and trading at a rock bottom price. So I side with the analyst who has a $14 price target on APRN, and will consider keeping the position for much higher prices depending on how the next two quarters play out."
Facts .... just look at 5 year chart someone show me a chart that’s worse ... reverse split was kiss of death
Well the start to the week looks good
"Don’t sell , hold on your shares Huge jump , heavy loads for longs and Shorts are squeezed $8.50++"
"Fascinating to see all the negative spins on EVERYTHING today! Yes, it's disappointing that current quarter wasn't profitable just yet, and very disappointing that company is still struggling with production while blaming Covid on this. However, pretty much everything else is actually positive:1. Loss is smaller loss forecasted by company 3 months ago2. Revenues up 13% year/year (would have been higher but company reduced advertising due to stated production capacity issues)3. Financial situation much improved by having sold 4,000,000 shares 3 months ago for a net proceeds after fees of $32.9m (i.el. shares were sold at a price a little above $8.00/share) + new revolving credit4. Tailwinds still in place for at least the next few quarters given the virus resurgence 5. Increased revenue per customer (the highest it has been since 2015)All this in for a company operating in the meal kits market where the Blue Apron product is rated one of the best, with competitor Hello Fresh sporting a market cap of $11B versus Blue Apron $115m. Yes, Blue Apron must fix their production issues to regain some market share from Hello Fresh (and others) - which they are painfully aware I am sure. No question that it is taking too long and no convincing explanation has been provided by management today, but it's not unreasonable to assume fixing production - or at least improving it - is the top priority for management and board.I take note that the fact that board no longer seeking to sell the company is somehow also spun as a negative - as it's a bad thing that company has shored up liquidity, improved revenues, hired new board members and planning to continue to run the company. Note also that an acquisition offer for the company is not at all off the table just because the board is no longer actively looking for a suitor.On a personal note, I subscribed to the product a few weeks ago, having never cooked before in my life. Absolutely loving it, excellent product all around and well designed easy to use mobile application. Picking the meals we want 1,2 and 3 weeks in advance is exciting and fun. And, yes, I subscribed now because the pandemic leading to going to restaurants less and having more time at home."
costco needs blue apron
Does this stock have a chance of going to 20$?
Halted due to volatility.
This is not going any lower and frankly all the shorters and puts should be thanking this stock because there is no reason for it to be this low and before you know it us longs will be reward far more than the scraps made from shorting this. This stock never lets me down and the company is great its the future of in home foods and is such a nice break from regular grocery and the usual food deliveries it offers a nice option of gourmet dining making the food yourself and healthy while giving stay at home people something to learn and do. I am so bullish on this its one of my favorite stocks for a reason never let me down heading to 9's-10s or higher this week. For me personally blue apron is the best meal kit in the USA and I put my money where the mouth is picked up more shares and now I just chill out n wait for the gains eoy long term baby ..not saying you cant make some cash day trading or whatever but smart investments take time you have to let the stock mature and I know what this beauty is capable of doing. Its a gift at this price !!
My buy order in the mid $10s went through before that last halt :)
Really trying to Trace out a reverse head and shoulders pattern on the chart. one more day of up and sell. Then get back in for earnings.
"Some people here have great insights. Is there a way to ""subscribe"" or ""follow"" a certain person's comments?"
If this ship sinks I'm sinking with it.If we make it to the land of treasures so be it.
"we're below book, with a healthy balance sheet for at least a couple of quarters of operations... the shorts are licking frosty flagpoles at this point"
I want to see 13 today
"Market up 350 points APRN down 2% this stock is cursed since IPO it's been a shorts dream come true . SAD number one meal kit in USA 2014, 2015, 2016 the most laughable stock on Wall Street no PR no transparency no clue whatsoever on shares being offered at what price ?? how many shares were sold ? where is the Investor Relations ? As long as CEO and board are granted free stock shares who cares ?"
BUY HIGH SELL HIGHER
"Be careful with these parabolic trades because they can drop like a rock in no time. Sell by COB for a profit. Then if it is parabolic again the next day, wash... rinse... repeat."
Anybody think it will get back to $20 again. I got it at $21.50 this morning WTH :-((((
"Market cap now only 250 million. Mr Wonderful should step in and start buying. 700 million in revenue. If they could just fix the net margin problem, the stock would soar. Why not use some of those refinanced dollars to buy back some shares? At this price, they should just take the company private."
This is for Edith
"8.74 will be your lowest point right now, I don't see it getting any lower today."
after IPOO and reverse split of 1 to 15 and count more dilution of shares that were sold recently APRN is trading at a whopping .50 cent WOW Awesome worst IPOO in history of modern era stock market they should sell scuba gear nearly 90 % of all investors of APRN stock are underwater ..
"Seeing $1 by the noon time,so enjoy your lunch guys"
Wow it's green today! Or am I just color blind now? We'll see I guess haha
opening os business not good sign for bluethingy

Just so you know guys I will be shorting this today. I have 5k shares reserved to short
Dismal earnings...whatever China virus pop it got is going away shortly...how soon before this dumpster fire company is back below $4 and $3?

"Blue Apron Reopening Texas Fulfillment Center - after closing a fulfillment center in Arlington, TX back in April, BA will be reopening that facility to keep up with current demand. It will cost them approx $2 million in Q1 2021 according to filling by the New York based company with the SEC.

Seems like they would be providing insight about any number of things including how the stock raise is going and what the money will be used for. Transparency is always a good thing for shareholders. The reverse is always suspicious. I think 9+ is a very reasonable target for the next month or so. I've already been in and out of this stock about 6 times for small gains (always up, never short). Anyhow, good luck to all those holding. Technically speaking, we are WAAYY oversold. So selling right now might not be the best idea."
Got 8000 more shares at $6.50 today. Total 38000 shares long and strong 
What happened around 1:40 PM ET? Big spike.
using outside help sounds like more costs. that will help get your stock price up.

Is the rocket ship warming up? shorts buckle up you will need it
Has anyone calculated the EPS after the split assuming the trajectory of earnings which should finally go positive when Q2 results are announced?
This is the greatest moment in the history of Blue Apron!
Any day at this price someone should be making an offer . The big question is who and how much ?
Buy before earnings
"Once folks get out of the house, Blue Apron will be back down sub $2 and then tick, tick, tick to oblivion. Best to short this thing and make some $$ while it drops."
2500 more shares before earning. total investment of 9000 shares. average cost at 4.96
Why the RS is a bad thing? You will have less shares but your total value will remain the same.
Blue Apron is up 14.79% to 11.49
I hope today will touch 5.25 red zone I am watching this game shame on CEO & directors & New director
APRN with Linda K Expect over $5 easily Longs ! It’s time to get rewarded for holding your shares !!Target this year over $8

"￼HomepageBusinessDennis Golden in BusinessBlue Apron Holdings, Inc. (APRN): Value Stock To Outperform Growth￼Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:APRN) stock enjoyed an overall downtrend of -66.75% from the beginning of 2018. The closing share price quoted for October 12, 2018 was $1.34. The 3.08% rally might have been tempting for an investor to buy at this point and in fact that would prove a good idea, as sell-side analysts think there is almost 347.76% more gain yet to come for shareholders. Analysts seemed to set $6 as highest price target on its way to greater gains. The average 12-month price target they expect from the stock is $2.71. This mean price target represents 102.24% upside over its previous closing price. The median price target they presented was $2.15 for the next 12-months, which suggests a 60.45% upside from current levels. Some analysts have a lowest price target on the stock of $1.3, which would mean a -2.99% gain in value."
"Only gave back half. With all the panic, not to bad. Yeah!"
SHORT MEAT GETTING BEAT
"Marley Spoon (MMM.AX) on their first trading day after their ER (they reported after Australia's Wednesday's close) did a Kodak for me last night jumping over 43%. Thing is, while APRN moved up a few points or so over the quarter, MMM moved up 300% before going into yesterday's ER (and all on no big news reporting). HFG reports on Aug. 11 and has moved up 150% in Q2. Sooner than later, especially with all the positive reporting in just the last 24 hours, APRN will pop.And just for those who are calling for the company to shut down or predicting it's demise. News Flash. APRN showed a profit and will likely repeat that in Q3. Guidance based on 2019 Q3 seasonal data is a joke. As someone else posted, the only season we are in right now is the corona season. And this season isn't changing any time soon."
"My 1000 short APRN sold at $12.26 have now earned me $4,000. Not bad for a trade that I thought was long gone. I got (back) in on the short when I heard they needed money DESPITE covid.... That is the perfect storm for any food delivery company (like competition show). I will hold the short till they go bankrupt or stock finds a bottom around $2 or so."
Let this be a lesson to longs. Every single time a company has a vey large reverse split....RUN! !!!!
Such a good dip. Wish I could add more. This mainly down because of Weight Watchers.
Grilling some shortie Bear Burgers on the Grill Open's up APRN $8.00-$10.00 by 6:30am new 52 week highs coming then $20.00 Book it
Quarantines coming. We will need 100 Blue Apron to deliver food to people.
"I have a good feeling about APRN earnings for next week! Blue Apron has had a surge in subscribers during this crazy, home-bound time, and that will only raise investor confidence in the stock. While this may not fully stabilize their balance sheet (yet), it will absolutely make their company more profitable long run and lead to a more positive outlook in looking forward. All of my friends who have subscribed to Blue Apron have loved it and become loyal customers. I am sure many of their new subscribers feel the same way! Good luck longs, we will finally see what we have been patiently waiting for next week :)"
"The biggest problem we have is with people getting impatient, because they expect a quick win, so they sell lower to the shorts. Don't expect a quick win in APRN, buy and hold for months to come, or don't buy at all (why lose your money.) The shorts will be churning longs for a long time, and the only way we can beat them is if the longs become more and more, and stronger and stronger. Buy and hold strong and long, and let's beat the shorts."
Expect $4+ today
"Shortage of shares available, nice afternoon push."
Expansion needed for new growth. Time will tell
what would be next week? massive shorts cover? 
"7 @4pm,10 on Friday"
Super awesome company. I always believed in it. APRN will be the next Amazon!
Although I don’t hold shares in APRN anymore I can see a massive bounce today if not next week and it was such a power move into 1.06 resistance with no short term support for sellers. Classic move. I’m going to wait for confirmation to get back in for the swing trade. Good luck guys.
"Oh, look! APRN is back to Monday's price, after hours. Nice."

"APRN is down another 6 cents. After hearing all the comments on this Board, I called by broker again to get his take on the 6 cents drop. He almost laughed at me. He said six cents on a loser stock like APRN is not worth talking about. It is better to focus on stocks that are thriving. The steady drip drip drip downwards is caused by the steady exodus of investors. He wanted me to dump my APRN and use the money on another stock. I was shocked. I told him for sure APRN is going back to $6. He said nothing."
"Wow, WW downgraded from the $70s to $37. Sheesh.. Bird box memes flashing again... https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ww-downgraded-google-board-faces-152927783.html"

I hope they sell this company and end the pain now. Its a great product. but it's hard for them to scale. this company is better run by a walmart or kroger.
That and Edith see $8 dude back. ha. Go Aprn! Yeah!

"No one is going to buy anything at this time of uncertainty. Plus APRN liabilities are more than their assets. Why will someone pay to buy negative value. If someone does pay for their assists, they’ll have to pay off debt first. If they don’t wanna pay off the debt, the only way is BK. Either way common shares are 0 value."
"I am new in APRN with 10K stocks @2.15. First the customers must accept Walmart food kits. How's the quality? APRN has a very high quality standard. The only thing they have to change is the distribution way, to make APRN profitable. That means mainly co-operations with other vendors. Why not sell the APRN food kits on gas stations, 7eleven and other stores? I have confidence, that the new CEO who is in charge since last december can find a way out of this difficult situation. And one thing is good too: customers who first try meal kits from Walmart, weight watcher and whatever, will also try other brands....such as Blue Apron."
Wall street darling now
Why would anyone purchase blue aprn any supermarket chain could replicate this concept at a cost 1/10th the current price. Brand isnt worth enough to justify this.
APRN is getting a a big tailwind from BYND. Nice short term buy
Tired of it going up and down so quickly!
"8K just filed...they are reopening a Texas fulfillment center: Item 8.01 Other Events.Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) has determined to temporarily reopen its fulfillment center in Arlington, Texas beginning in January 2021. As the Company previously disclosed, it closed its Arlington fulfillment center in the second quarter of 2020. The Company decided to temporarily reopen the Arlington fulfillment center to allow it to focus on utilizing existing assets as one of its operating initiatives to help supplement labor quickly, as the Company believes that there is a more readily available labor pool in and around the Arlington fulfillment center. The Company believes that this temporary reopening initiative will enable the Company to leverage existing assets to meet forecasted demand while it continues to identify and implement other operating efficiencies.Consistent with the Company’s previously disclosed expectation of approximately $8.0 million of annual cost savings in product, technology, general and administrative expenses, the Company expects to incur costs of approximately $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 to reopen and operate the Arlington fulfillment center."
I shorted this at $14. I think we still have some more room to drop before Xmas. Q3 earnings will be a bloodbath. I think this can go to $1 by Dec. I'm going to hold my short position. Confident they file bankruptcy.
69 cents ouch. Good luck baggies
"This stock is $2.50-$3, just because Oprah is indirectly involved now....forget fundamentals or due diligence. Oprah bump is real!!!"
"My investment thesis on APRN:(1) Better new APRN- Since mid-2019, the company has- a new CEO with high pedigree (ex-Etsy, Evernote, Alibaba), stopped chasing unprofitable customers & low potential partnerships (grubhub, costco, jet.com), tightened its distribution network. Current APRN>Old Aprn(2) COVID to the rescue- APRN's core customer is 50+ in age, $100k+ in income and is at COVID risk. High capacity utilization will continue beyond the sold out April-Mid-May period and will lead to low marketing spend, better operating leverage which will lead to positive cash flows. ""Running out of cash"" fear delayed!(3) HelloFresh thrives- HF with far better financials trades at 3x revenue compared to 0.3x for APRN. APRN has solid brand recall but a constrained balance sheet. Whether that deserves a 90% discount is debatable esp during COVID."
blue thingyyyyy is so done!
BE SAFE AT HOME .ORDER YOUR MEAL FROM APRN.
"There is something going on concerning all stocks that is not good! There is becoming a blur between Company News, Fake news, opinions, analysts, hit pieces and self-serving posts designed to move a stock one way or another. The new reality is that someones Blog site passes for a news site which in turn is construed as the truth by investors when in fact, it is not, it is just someones opinion. That opinion is then re-written by numerous other people trying to crash a stock or raise it. A lot of that is going on with all the so called analyst's on Blue Apron. My advice to Blue Apron is keep their thoughts close to their chests, stay away from investor conferences in keep their nose to the grindstone on turning sentiment upward. I am a Blue Apron investor and love their meals.They have a very good idea, that should grow over time. IMO, Luck"

They probably did NOT sell much shares at the private placement (for SURE not at $9.25 as stock in the free market was in the 8s when it went down) and they could be burning cash fast.A few of us gave them 3-6 months before needing MORE liquidity (depending on how much they raked in at that private placement, diluting all other shares).Looking forward to the earnings call!"

12.50 was the realistic base. Don’t let one big seller make you lock in any losses.
set to go below $3? is the company doing so bad? looks like a good time to slowly get in.
is this company just trying to get delisted?
Not what I was expecting. Word is out. Either that or covering like crazy right now.
Wow it just bounced up 10% today. Shorts are worried?
But if workers get the Coronavirus. Who’s gonna box the goods?
I don't know if a wive tail or not but I have my shares on a $2.00 trailing stop sell to hopefully keep them from being borrowed to short.
Wait for it! Yeah!
What would you sell this company for? Still way undervalued! Hold long.
OK - the amount of bashers on this board tells me we made the right investment
"I must say from listening at the cc, it's very clever what Blue Apron is doing. You make your 2019 numbers look bad so that 2020 can look good with minimal efforts. And while they wait for this to happen, they prepare the infrastructure, marketing, new initiatives, etc. to make sure that growth happens in a sustainable fashion. This is the difference between a CEO like Linda Kozlowski vs Rich Williams at Groupon. Groupon can't get they revenue to grow 'cause they never let it fall in the year it hit a plato. When Rich Williams at Groupon took over at CEO, I wrote a letter to him telling him to let revenues drop that year and cut marketing. He did totally the opposite and double the marketing budget like he thought he was a wiz kid, a Steve Jobs of sort. And it's being like four years and Groupon is still trading under 3 bucks and this was a stock as highly regarded as Facebook when both companies filed their IPOs. That's go to show how one individual can make or break a company. The only mistake Blue Apron is making is not buying back some of its shares at these levels."
Shorts getting grilled.
Way under valued. Mr. Wonderful when is the buyout coming?Tomorrow would be good.
Market goes down EOD. APRN goes up. lolGood boy APRN. Who's a good boy? You are.
"I predict there won't be a gap up before tomorrow. But rather, we will see a drop back to 10/11. Great place to buy back in. I just can't see this doing another 70%+ gap after two days in a row."
After RS I'm in 30.00 share wow I guess tax write-off
"I got out of this stock about a month ago at $13.25. Why? For the same reason that has been stated. No confidence. I don’t want to left holding the bag when the stock dips and takes months to go back up like last earnings. I do believe covid has helped this company greatly and i order from them weekly. However, I will buy when it dips and sell when I think it has reached max potential. I can’t be long right now. So when and if it goes back under $12 I will buy. Sorry longs but that is my position as of today"
I Love this stockJust Sayin
"Will someone please tell the morons talking about a buyout to go back to fantasy land. Who in their right mind would by a company that 1. Loses customers daily 2. Can only get customers by spending every dime on marketing 3. Loses millions of dollars every quarter 4. Keeps running out of cash 5. Has no assets 6. Has not made a profit since inception 7. Business model can be duplicated by any amateur 8. Has zero value, ZERO. Should I continue or would you like to explain how a company like Wal Mart would buy this joke of a company? How do you think that board meeting goes? Hey, Joe lets buy Blue Apron, they burn through more cash than a biotech, cant keep customers, cant get customers, its a great company, lets buy it so WE can lose some money too!!!! YEAH"
Does anybody know what time the earnings release will be tomorrow.

"In case you are wondering why the stock is up so much today: an insider bought $872,712 worth of APRN stock @ $4.53/share on 10/28. This follows a purchase on 9/22 by the same insider of $693,040 @ $6.30/share so in total around $1.55m - quite a show of confidence! Adding to the upwards pressure on the stock is a likely short squeeze."
"Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. Could Grow 130.99% MoreAPRN’s mean recommendation on Reuter’s scale presents no change from 2.67 thirty days ago to 2.67 now, which indicates a hold consensus from the analyst community. They see Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (APRN) price hitting a mean target of $4.92 a share, meaning the stock still has potential that could lift the price another 130.99% . Also, the recent close suggests the stock is underpriced by 181.69% compared to the most bullish target.Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. (APRN) Returns -47.15% This YearThe company had seen its current volume reaching at 2.45 million shares in the last trade. That compares with the recent volume average of 4.49 million. At the close of regular trading, its last week’s stock price volatility was 10.09% which for the month reaches 9.78%. Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. dipped to as low as $2.09 throughout the day and has returned -47.15% in this year. At one point in the past year, the shares traded as low as $1.72 but has recovered 23.84% since then."
"Blue Apron has ace in their pocket. With all that cash on hand and a 30% short interest in it's shares, they should announce a share buy back. With this just one move they can propel the price of the price of the stock to epic proportions through a huge short squeeze."
"Seriously, on the day Trump finally issues a national lockdown, how much will Aprn rise? Edith says 200% easily. What you all think?"
• Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) is up 6.15% in morning trading to continue a week-long uptrend in share price since the company announced a new CEO and backed its prior guidance.• Shares of Blue Apron are now up 16% over the last five sessions.

Why is it going down now? Why? Why?
"I did some financial modeling on APRN. I expect them to continue to lose revenues but also to keep shedding staff. If the latter outruns the former, we have a virtuous cycle. All the savings need to go into share buy back. In a year, the reduced share count will drive the share price to $1.62 which is 40% above today's price."
5 year chart is spectacular .. Impressive Blue Apron 6.56 divided by 15 is .43733 cent so if you purchased at 3 dollars ( which was 70% below IPO price ) before the nice RS split which hundreds of thousands investors did the stock would need to get to 45 $ per share to break even
the company was at verge of collapse two months ago.
You don't want to fold down your cards in the last minute at this price.

Aprn delivers meal kit but wtw is going to sell their meal kit in store. Is wtw targeting a totally different market?!
Today will close above 30
I don’t get the drop? The Company posted a 13% increase in third-quarter net sales. And they projected fourth-quarter net revenue to grow about 15 to 19% from a year earlier￼
"This could easily be 40 dollar stock ,but unfortunately management has no vision.just sitting around and chatting"
"Aprn is doing something right, I tried to sign up for their pop up cooking class in NYC it was sold out!!!"
Onion charge off and labor problems with millions unemployed LOL ..........Hello Fresh must be dying of laughter when they heard earnings call for APRN

Great news APRN first company to lose 99 % of value in first 2 years of IPO and trading publicly
"From .25 loss down to .17, it’s a great improvement!It’s obviously indication for upside , management, marketing are doing excellent to improve !Investment in APRN is wise and will be rewarding for the Longs"
anybody think this will drop below $3 again? trying to figure out a time to buy in.
millions of people unemployed and they have labor issues doesn't get much better than that fire everyone on the board and CEO and have plant manager run the company give all workers that are packing and shipping boxes a huge raise they are the only people for Blue Apron that are actually working . the strategic review is completed ???? LOL okay great what the results ?
"Looking at the chart, seems like its going to 0"

"Very soon all those who waited , will be rewarded from APRN"
I WARNED YOU. TWICEJUST COVER & GO LONG
Upgrades came from the underwriters. Temporary pump so their big clients can exit and reduce their losses. Niche market that can be served by supermarkets and big companies that can provide this service as a loss leader. It's a cute idea but it's not a stand alone business imho.
"Bubble pop, apron has tons of competition like home chef"
Still waiting for the real intrinsic value of Blue Apron like Kevin O'Leary said on CNBC 6 to 8 dollars stock value. If they can sustain and grow the meal kit sector. Back to IPO price sure.
as long as CEO the board are granted free shares who cares ???
Breaking News Just Out.So its all trueShould close above 5 todaygood luck to alland I'm going to Disneyland......................................
I think this market segment is in its infancy and this unfortunate circumstance is the catalyst for millions to adopt the program. A major partnership can catapult this stock to unprecedented levels.
"Full disclosure that I own 12000 shares average price of 1.83 and I’m not too worried (yet). I keep adding here under 1.50 to lower my avg. the pop is coming...I’ve played a few of these APRN quick pops, plus the earnings run up is near. Good time to build a position"
"Something happening behind the wing, will buy now while in the dip., something always happenand I be ready in the lowest point to gather the exact figure. Nothing to lose ,just wait it out and you will be rewarded. They still have a good platform in place already, just move over for the next operator."
 great day .
"Snagged 2200 shares yesterday at $11.91. Sold them at $15.60. Not a bad trade. Quick $8.1K in profit. Looking to snag another 2200 shares below $8/share today. Bid is in at $7.90...subject to change. I see this heading back to $4 eventually, after all the momo players move on and margin calls kick in from overextended retail traders."
In at 1.91. Should be back to $3 before next earnings.
Never had a stock halted three times in 3 hours.No one stop it APRN
If you’re selling at these levels based of the bullishness of this stock!!! Your gonna miss out on the Continuation higher 
do not sell
"I see Hacks has upgraded, and the Sheeple pile in. They are going to “earn” ($3.59) in the next year, and that is supposedly good news.Or is that the estimate for the next quarter? ￼And no, there are not any typographical errors in my post.￼￼"
 it’s going up!
"Blue Apron Holdings, Inc. APRN offers ready-to-cook meal kits, which have witnessed strong demand in recent weeks as more Americans are homebound. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Blue Apron’s next-year earnings has moved 5% north in the past 60 days. The Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.3%. Blue Apron carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company gained 362.6% in the past one month."
"I don't get some of the people here. The earnings show a loss of customers and no amount of finagling can couch that. So what do we have here? Rumors of takeovers--a 1 in 100 shot at best. Someone has to face reality. If you go to the IRobot page or ROKU or Twitter or whatever other tech page, you will read about rumors of M/A. The only difference is those stocks are doing well. Here it's not so much but the rumors keep flying. Hmm."
I like when it’s not Boring
"If by some struck of luck, APRN is bought, what do you think would be the offer? $3.50 a share?"
Hit $13 post market trading 
APRN is up 8.44% to 3.47
wheres edith? yeh!
For those who cannot comprehend numbers. APRN IPOed at $10 a share and current SP is $0.73 even when things are turning well finally for the company. Stock market cap is not even a quarter of annual revenue of what their business generates. Compare this to companies running with market cap at 10X of their revenues.Why we are long? There is always a risk if you are investing in stock market. We are aware of that. However the upside potential greatly overwhelms the downside here. We can lose 50% if things go #$%$ but make 1000% if we are right on this. Do your DD and wish for the best.

"It’s all about the guidance. Good guidance - please read. Hold your shares. Second Quarter 2020 OutlookBased on second quarter trends to date, Blue Apron today provided an outlook for certain second quarter 2020 financial metrics, which are based on certain assumptions regarding the company’s business, trends, seasonal factors and, in particular, the impact of COVID-19 and the response of various government authorities. The below guidance is based on certain assumptions regarding the continued impact of COVID-19 on the company’s business, including as a result of changes in consumer behavior and grocery alternatives, and the magnitude and timing of the impact on the company’s business when the effects of COVID-19 and related restrictions begin to ease. Further, the following guidance assumes that the company will not experience any significant disruptions in its fulfillment operations or supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.For the second quarter, the company expects net revenue will grow year over year in the high single digits on a percentage basis to approximately $130.0 million. Notwithstanding substantial investments in its front-line fulfillment center team as volume ramps up, the company expects to deliver a net loss of no more than $6.0 million, positive adjusted EBITDA of at least $5.0 million and positive operating cash flow of at least $10.0 million."
Just some folks selling off as they expected a miracle from the earnings call and didnt read any of the financials. Your loss my gain. Ill buy your shares at 10.5

Where’s Brotie? I thought he would have bought it when it spiked up and be on the boards questioning what’s going on now that it’s dropping.
Building a nice cup-handle formation. This may throw us to $8.50 in the next couple hours. There is some resistance at $8.50 but I don't think it will be a big deal. I am hoping to see us testing the real deal at $15 soon.
@Isosceles dont sell. Think of this like your house. Will you buy/sell daily. Keep this. It will go up. CEO has nothing to share. She is not going to react to drunkards selling their assets. Wait patiently. You will be handsomely rewarded.
APRN the best stock of the day.the only one!!!
Rally is slowing down.
There is momentum and it appears to be increasing. Retail momentum. How about that.

MR WONDERFUL just picked APRN for Buyout
"I need this stock to get back to $6.00. The trading in the last month has gone in the wrong direction. I think it is all due to illegal trading so I contacted the SEC. I explained that APRN is the US leader in meal kits; how can the share price go down except for illegal price manipulation. My words meant nothing as they wanted proof. Proof of what? The price is down, which is proof enough. The SEC agent did say they track all stocks and most of the trading in recent weeks for APRN has been with private exchanges which he called dark pools. See what I mean? APRN is being traded in shady areas. For sure when they must trade in the sunshine, the price will rise."
Was wondering when this would happen. APRN is one of my stocks that are too painful to look at daily but I still hold because I think there is huge upside from these levels.
"Good afternoon. Took a break from this stock and played around with a couple of others including Rite Aid... but I do believe the time has come for APRN... at least short term. I believe mid-high 7s are an easy target pre-earnings just on speculation alone. I've not bet the farm as I do believe there is risk here given factors I've pointed out in the past. That said, it was rather aggressive to replace 4 board members at the same time -- so clearly there is a shake up going on. Might all be linked to the loan refinance and repayment -- meaning it was necessary in order to get the loan. The bank may have seen existing management as weak or without the necessary track record to secure the note repayment. Sitting only on 2K shares at $6.85 for now and not planning on adding unless there is a real opportunity. Will probably sell at mid 7s.@Dustin -- great analysis on the stock. Enjoyed the read.@Nope -- you seem to simply not be happy with this stock. Why not just move on? Life is too short for all the time you spend here posting.Good luck to those holding... and to anyone shorting -- probably best to exit that position while things are quiet."
"On green days, Aprn up. On red days Aprn up. On days that end in day, Aprn up. ha. Yeah!"
We still have many weeks to go until businesses are open again... that is... if the corona virus has been decreased!
BA would need to currently drop like 12% to get talks of delisting. Why is this even an issue?
blue skies above 200MA
Blue Apron is up 15.21% to 8.33
Still think BA is a $5 stock at least.
"Bam, right out of the chute. Sailed right past .99 into deep kimchi territory. Now kimchi, as in food, is great and good for you; however kimchi as in a state of being, is usually a bad indicator that things have slid southward and are not good."

One of the most laughable business models ever concocted.Hopefully a lot of folks have big profits here and can dump. Two or 3 quarters from now this will be back to penny stock status.
sold 4000 shares today been holding since 2017 averaged down 100 times being a soldier not selling my shares not giving in to hedge funds guess what my reward was 1 to 15 reverse split my 41000 shares became 2700 shares even bought additional shares after reverse split portfolio down 99 % since reverse split had one run up to 28 for about 5 minutes went down like an avalanche now for the last 7 or 8 months has been trading for .68 cent back in 2017 on this same board everyone was posting do not sell do not sell average down average down . I am thrilled about the 2 huge checks I received it was satisfying and rewarding that they held back pertinent info on IPO . Long since 2017 huge mistake don't make the same mistake I made nothing nut bad news and scams . If you want to know exactly why it was a 13 million dollar loss I will tell you exactly why
"Full disclosure, 50,000 shares. Adding 10,000 more shares tomorrow. Scared $$$ always lose. Pony up or go home!"
10 more days like that and I will be happy.
I’m telling you this thing isn’t stopping.
REV CUT WAS 25%.... STOCK SHOULD FALL 50 %..... APRN WILL NOT GO UP FOR A COUPLE OF Q's....
Ok. Who's up at least triple figures with Aprn? Edith will go first! Yeah!
I feel like this thing it’s going up big tomorrow
Shorts again.... just be patient it has been almost 3x since the last earnings
Earnings tomorrow before market open.
"I wonder, buyout will be announced after market or tomorrow. Will we see at least $10?"
@a.maih Just curious. Did you buy at the ipo price? .10 dip at best?
just turned green I will be utter shock if it stays green
Well......... Trump never said which Easter. ha.
Earnings call will announce partnership with Retail 3.50 today sorry shorts
Thank 15% love it
"Where are all the longs who were buying when this was at $15 the other week?Anybody? All the cheerleaders silent now?This is what happens when you base all of your investment decisions on momentum and hopium,Ultimately you get burned. Good old fundamentals never fail over time. Short at $14 with a bunch of $14 put contracts.Riding this to $1......Victory is sweet."
Just have to let it do its thing the earnings have been profitable and the demand much higher than before but when more shares are introduced it is seen as dilution and causes for sell off at first but then it will start to pick up again. The company will have even better results even though it seems low now but stay in there dont be afraid of the red embrace it and hold long we will be out the 7's eventually and inter 8-9's soon enough. The volume was low yesterday and the shorts are pushing this down but that will not last.
"Remember that the current Mcap includes debt of 120 M so the valuation is close to 160 M + another ( at least ) 40 M to redo the business model bringing the current ""future valuation"" to 200 M even if the stock price is 5 times lower. This is why the volatility in the stock can be so high even if the Mcap is low. Stay cool."
Can’t believe it’s back to where I owned it pre bynd news got out pop over 10.. maybe I’ll dip toe back in
Oh Kevin...
will buy at $0.50
oh my.

Blue Apron.................. We got the Meats! Sorry Arbys. We taking over the meats! Yeah! ha.
It will reach 11$. Strong buy when everyone says sell. That is game. In two weeks $2+. It is a great company!
15$$$$$ by Fri... Then beat earnings and away we go!! Shorts beware.......
Let's go! Hitting double digits is just Toooooooooooooo Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet! Yeah!
It's amazing what perception does to stocks. This company has had negative net income for years now...Quite possibly the most inflated stock on the market right now.
Where is the news? Who is buying us? Who are we buying? Has blue apron solved covid-19? Something please
Well - again it traded so weird. a trading spread of 10% +/- on a small stock on no news. From up to down 5% to back up 4% and more crazy swings.Risky for both long and shorts. I think some traders have found this stock and use it for swing trading.
Let’s talk the numbers. $8+
I missed my buy point I think
Anyone buying in tomorrow?
a perfect snow flake/millenial investment :)
"The current management estimates the market for meal kit is about $48 billion. If Blue Apron's share of the market is roughly a quarter or $10 billion give or take, and if they realize it then the current shareholders are going to be very wealthy. I am very encouraging. Management say they are focusing on people earning $70,000 or more per year which is what I had hoped they would do. I am going to hold onto my shares and ride with the new management and hope they are able to execute their plan. If it works we long are going to be very happy."
"Share price was at year's low 3.96 today. This looks to me like a most opportune time for fresh direct or another competitor to acquire this company that has gradually improved its offerings and operation. As its market cap is well below its true value, in my opinion, it's just waiting for a key partnership or acquisition that need only a modest infusion of money. Not sure if Linda is reaching out to potential suitors or vice versa, but something has to give at this point. Price will not languish at this level much longer, imo."
$6 Buy Out!!!
"ahahahahahahah, chef edouardo, ahahahahahahBlue Apron partners with Chef Edouardo Jordan to bring his holiday recipes to home cooks around the country"

This will be up further on Monday once the panic further subsides.
"Read between the lines , APRN will get to &8.55+"
"How it should've been managed: The $ spent on advertising is worse than a waste of $. During covid people want APRN, they'll order it. When I get spammed by their ads I'm LESS likely to want to buy product. Further, management was trying to increase demand while unable to produce enough to meet current orders, ridiculous. Instead of INCREASING advertising spend by 2m during 2q pandemic, they should've DECREASED ad spend by at least 2m. That alone would've increased profit to .40c for 2q, ($1.60 annualized) a blowout past expectations, which would've generated broad financial market coverage and free advertising. Even without expectation of growth, that'd put share price at $17.60 with a p/e of 12x. Then instead of worst case guidance for 3q, maybe a little optimism. That negative outlook #$%$ isn't being prudent n honest, it's being pessimistic and negating all that ad spend with negative press. People don't want to buy food from a broke#$%$ company, they want to buy food from a strong, healthy company. It becomes a self fullfilling prophecy. Then, THEN you make a 2m share secondary offering at $18 (or more) (instead of 4m @ $9) with emphasis on expansion and the price probably goes up even more."
Buy at 69c

I feel the stock has misses earnings but it's still a tremendous demand for its product therefore I see some upside in it so I think you can hold on and go long on this

I mean i understand that this is lawsuit (alleging that defendants made false and/or misleading misstatements etc).But what is the chances? It is from 2017. I used to have-traded with 5k or 10k. i sold it with a loss, maybe 2k..."
You better add it to your portfolio or loss out like u did bynd fake meat

"the investment banks want to dump their shares before APRN reports a disappointing quarter, then they can short the hell out of it. Seen it 100s of times before, I'm sorry to say. wait until after reporting and but it alot cheaper, if you are so desperate to own it."
Looks like going to 2 bucks!
"I think they want somebody to shop for them but they still like the idea of cooking, if it is healthy and everything was given to them to cook. The new way of doing it. Exactly what you get with Blue apron"

APRN and WTRH will be 100%+ gain!
"APRN trades like a Coronavirus stock. Many of the Coronavirus stocks are down today because the market is up on euphoria. Not sure why. But when the market drops hard tomorrow, this stock will be up. Social distancing is not going away until there is a caccine in 12-18 months and even when there is a vaccine, it's not going away until 70% of the world get the vaccine which will take months longer."

"There are so many stocks falling and having their revenue melt away like airlines, car rentals etc. So the few stocks that experience demand for their service, like Blue Apron, will get revenue. So the money flow should drive APRN hopefully further up."
Who wants a Slurpee?! Yeah!
"If aprn executes this right, they could did for food as amazon did for books in its nascent phase. amazon is so spread thin, its multiple attempts to get into food distribution business has failed repeatedly. aprn's strategy could be to automate sourcing and distribution of food, with an eye toward prime like subscription to target consumers for premium service, then expand into a wider market. hope their commercial strategy has some elements of these, and if so, having been backed into the wall and gasping for breath, it could finally emerge with a path forward and reawakened sense of urgency and real possibilities of turning this into a promising company once again."
APRN is dead to me.
"Chintzy serving sizes, outrageous prices, wilted veggies, and over-aged meat is a recipe for bankruptcy.I dare you to check out APRN's offerings:https://www.blueapron.com/pages/sample-recipesMost have been discontinued due to poor sales.https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/seared-ny-strip-steaks-chicken-with-chimichurri-quinoa-vegetable-saladOne serving is a child's-sized meal. For $76 and 55 minutes of tedious work, it would feed 2 normal hungry adults. In these hard times, a $20 pizza would taste better, feed the same family, arrive quicker, and would takes 5 minutes instead of 55.I call'em as I see'em. APRN is a sewage company, not a food company."
I ordered all my Blue Apron meals through April 18 and encountered something new. They say they're sold out of certain meals for the upcoming weeks in March and early April. Is is because they're cutting back on their budget or because demand is so high or more likely a combination?
Oh Aprn about to Pop! Yeah! Edith and Aprn will be dancing in green very soon!
On sale for 1.99 can't beat it
APRN is down -75.15% to 2.85
"apronblue has no hopes of turning up a profit, i mean ever ever ever"
article says ceo will step aside...step aside ??? I hope he steps on a land mine
WOW..
"Down over 42 cents today! Got a phone call from my broker who spoke to me on a recorded line. Using very dire and serious words, he admonished me on keeping APRN. Using sophisticated data crunching, they figured out some big stable holdings are selling out of APRN. He told me I should sell also because the direction is down. BS! He has no proof that the direction is down! My broker may know how to invest but he does not know how to trade. This downdraft is nothing more than illegal trading coupled with naked shorting to give a head fake which induces more selling. I am holding for the bounce to $6.00."
"Blue Apron box just arrived again, exactly on-time and as ordered. The Blue Apron team have been heroes during this pandemic for so many families. Shorts need to remember you are betting against heroes here, and that rarely ends well."
Seems like it will drop below $1 and then bottom and rise about $1. Pretty cyclical and not much news to go one way or another
"short squeeze coming , trades 30 when it happens"
37% short Volumen ratio
Hedge funds seem to be picking up interest. Interesting.
This is why I had to sell. Good numbers for the quarter and even a profit. Great news. Guidance was no where to be found and the stock dives down. It will more than likely hit $10 and then go up steadily over the next few months. Hopefully they will beat the guidance for quarter 3
it broke 9.48
Some good news coming tomorrow?? or fall ??
"Made 5,700 today"
APRN is up 43.97% to 9.43
$10.00+ Open $20.00 by Friday this will be the biggest short squeeze of the century have the float is short this is stock is going to skyrocket from here top food supply chain play and Covid-19 Hedge in the market. With a actual product Food the most essential thing we need. Remember groceries stores are dangerous to go to Blue Apron will become a a bluechip stock doing this crisis.
Amazon putting new customers for food delivery on waiting list. Guess those people will have to go somewhere else to buy food. Why hi there Aprn. Yeah!
2019 APRN $14+
Pay no attention to Dave and Fer. They are the same person. With the same negative spiel. Notice how they both message at the same time? He has his own agenda and it's not to help fellow investors.

"Blue apron is way undervalued, shorts will be burned when this stock sky rock"

Good luck everybody. Sure hope it’s a good ER.
"Look what happened to FTSV, today. This is what a buyout does. APRN is way under valued, it's just a matter of time. Also, my guess is that the coronavirus is going to be very good for business for APRN, just look at what is happening at Costco (just a theory at the moment.)"
"too cheap, 600m market cap with 200m cash on hand.imo"
Be nice to see Linda our CEO come out with some sort of news early tomorrow morning.
Check Google search trends. Blue Apron searches have tripled over the past week. Wow!
"I have a lot more than you. Hold Big Joe. We in same boat, LONG......."
We need some good news to move this up.
"Two days ago Zacks report that BA would provide negative numbers on earnings. We all already knew that was coming and it will be much lower than anticipated. BA tried to hold off with their results as long as they could but in the end, it is likely going to continue on it's way to ""THE END"". Down below a buck soon."
Needs to be a lot higher than this.
Remember what Edith said yesterday. On green days aprn is up. On red days aprn is up. On any day that ends in day aprn is up. Yeah!
One good new enough to see $6 .. they want to buy this stock cheap ..
"Per APRN, their recent online orders are increasing sharply. This will be a norm to most of Americans families. People will limit their trip to restaurants and supermarkets. APRN and others similar companies will benefit from this. We may be don't see the effect now but in next few weeks things will change rapidly. APRN will ride up again tomorrow. Good luck people!"
Founder sold shares at $10 just a few months ago. That was a sure sign that this company is dust. Any more recipes Linda???
"APRN- we have never made profit, unlikely that we ever will. If number of subscribers increase, our losses will increase. If we lose subscribers, we will go broke. As of now, massive trains and trucks carry produce to cities where they have an effective distribution system. Instead we are proposing we get rid of all those economies of scale and ship one meal at a time using multiple carriers. Do you want to invest with us?"
lets see 8.20 divided by 15 now trading at .54 cent IPO less then 2 years at $$ 11.00 almost a 100 % loss fire the entire board and hire the CEO of Hello Fresh
Sad news on the reverse split. That is just a wrong but legal way for the Investment Bankers to get their money back...
BLUE how many days until bankruptcy?
From my personal experiences an RS ...is a terrible chain of events. It takes years to over come should a stock be so lucky. Imho. If the stock hits 6.... then it will go to 3.... i wish aprn welll. I use the product. And i can say i am always happy with the product delivered. That is why i was a short term buyer ... then closed my position.
Is this stock going back down to 6? Its share price has been all over the place. Doesn't seem very stable.
Very smart of management to include 2Q20 guidance in earnings call in 2 weeks.
"Looks like my prediction I made 9 months ago is happening. This one. 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1My only regret is that I covered too soon..."
This company along has many niches it can serve and now has a leader who knows how to manage! I can’t wait to see her first moves...
I'm cashing out in the morning. I doubt we can justify this price even if the company does everything right. I forgot I even had these shares.
The bank didn't lend them money for stocks to see it lose. This is a growth play. Buy the dips or hold.
"but but but, I thought it can't go any lower than $2?"
I'm thinking it will only hit $28Maybe $32. Hard to say Short covering alone should nail it
What happened to the excellent overview that was just posted? It was deleted when I was replying to it. Don’t know the poster’s handle
"Did anyone see a Blue Apron ad on cable TV? I believe the company said such ads were included in the marketing push they announced recently, but I have yet to see one. Tired of only seeing Hello Fresh commercials on CNBC!"
"I am not disputing the issues many have noted regarding APRN’s management, but the fact remains that their metrics (sales, customers, average spend, and even cost structure) doesn’t warrant a market cap of only $100M. MMM, a good point of comparison has a market cap over 5x that of APRN. And compared to HFG whose marker cap is 100x that of APRN while their metrics are only about 20x (and that’s being generous). Shorts are able to strip this stock of its value because of relatively low volume and investor interest. But make no mistake APRN is cheep and they are not void of concrete assets. The street may not love them but that doesn’t mean that someone else isn’t sniffing."
Blue Apron knows they have to do something major to get stock price up.Wall street wants a buyout. I think they get it. Maybe today.
fundamentals coming into view?
"I keep hearing this talk about a buy out, but if you have two companies in a business in which there is only enough demand for one, doesn’t the strong one usually just wait it out until the weak one goes belly up?Why use your shareholders Capital to buy them out?￼"
All SMART people know that APRN can not make it as a stand alone. Mr. Wnderful would not risk his reputation on it if he thought otherwise. Wall Street will keep taking it down if they do not find a buyer.
REMEMBER THAT THIS IS OUR FIRST WEEK! MUCH MORE TO COME
let's see if my 350 order fills?
It’s the best time to buy APRNBuyout $8+Year end $14+
APRN is up 9.69% to 2.49
"I really think that this company will do good this year because there's no way, life will get back to normal anytime soon. People won't spend money at restaurants the same... It will take some time before we will go back to eat out like before. Earnings should set this stock in the 20s and up from there."
"love it----every day Sell high buy low, buy more shares.Thank$$$$$$$$$$$$"
"If the reverse split passes in the vote, don't be surprised if they issue more shares and drive the price down again :("
Shaking shorts and traders. Investors will be buying soon. Stay long!
Anyone think this will go up after they report Q2 earnings ?
The price volume trend is still up even in this midday consolidation. It seems like it's ready to pop up for a second push up.
"guys listen up! I read all this comments and I feel for everyone that lost money with apron. First of all this is not about short or longs, this is about your money! if the company has a great product but most importantly a great plan, than there is nothing the shorts can do! I'm sad to say but the shorts win this one. Apron has nothing left and very soon it will go down to a huge zero. There is just no way that the companies that own the market today are going to be okay with apron taking a fraction of a penny from their pie, just no way. My wife and I are customers and in my opinion they have a very nice box, but we all know that you have to have more than just a good product Look KO over 100 years in the industry and their stock is getting destroyed. Ask yourselves what makes you think that apron will come out of this winning? at the end money has no feelings and you will lose it all. If you are upset, take a minute and write to the CEO just like I did, let them know how disappointed you are. Good luck to all you!"
"im so jealous of those who bought yesterday, as I've only bought fully in this morning :("
Hourly graph showing closing triangle pattern. Will shoot back to $20. Get ready.
APRN is down over 10% today and there's not even one mention in the financial press. The silence is deafening.
1 minute chart clearly tells someone manipulating the price
Is this a dead #$%$ Seems to be mostly bashers here...??
"Solid results. 25,000 new customers added during 1Q20, which is the first increase in a very long time. Then in 2Q20 they see $130MM in sales (street analysts at $118)! And APRN will be generating cash again as well starting in 2Q20 with EBITDA at least +$5MM with operating cash flow of +$10MM. Shorts will try to mess around premarket, and early but end of the day this is now a new Blue Apron. And HelloFresh is a fair comp now since starting in 2Q20 Blue Apron is both growing (quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year), and is generating cash."
Mr. Wonderful We need someone to buy this company. Shareholders deserve more.
This is setting up to be the mother of all shorts. CoronaVirus will disappear then here comes the plunge.
"I can’t even read the news anymore. It’s just so bad, we are far from over with the virus. Another 3-4 weeks I would say. Which stock do you think will be interesting to watch? All the food and biotech ones."
"Just wanted to remind you that the average target price by all analysts is $1.59, which is more than 80% upside potential from current price. Their meal packages are appealing to a number of millennials and currently selling fine. Once it shows any sign of biz turnaround, the price will go skyrocketing with the big leg up. The time will be coming sooner than you think."
BYND will top 250 soon! APRN will follow BYND to top $20 soon!
Edith guess the people that sold today must not have paid attention to the people who sold yesterday. ha.
"Christ, this is getting hammered more than normal"
"Just remember there were times when iPod was not selling as well as its competitors' products that were so much inferior. I think it took at least a couple of years before it gained traction, after which of course, it has not been the same for apple ever since. Can BA pull off a similar feat and change the landscape of the meal kits and more generally, the multi-billion dollar food sourcing and distribution industry forever. It seems to me they just need some good ideas to expand into other aspects of that industry. They seem to have good people who can market this pretty well, and automation capability that could scale. As we come out of the pandemic, this might be the perfect time to take that leap. It just needs a bold investor with a vision to take what's good and turn it into something great."
My investment in Blue Apron is great for now.I hope next earnings report will be another good one with continued addition of customers for the quarter.
"Here is my reaction to the Q1 earnings call-1. I posted 2-3 times that Q1 results will be in line with company guidance as the covid benefit did not hit the numbers till the very end of March. So I wouldn't say Q1 was a miss as the headlines report. 1a. ""Consensus"" on APRN is one Cannacord analyst. Shame on her for asking the most softball question to the management and then parroting everything she heard on the call in her equity ""research"" report and maintaining her hold rating with $13 target. 2. I was underwhelmed by the Q2 guidance. I feel there is some conservatism built in there given the unknowns. Almost all of April and half of May (as of today) operated at 100% capacity without any marketing spend. 3. For those who know how it works, the $75M shelf registration means next to nothing. Doubt any new debt could be raised given all their assets are tied up with their secured revolver. What is more likely is a bought-deal or a PIPE of a small amount.. likely in the $20-$30m range. I can see an institutional investor over-exposed to restaurants sector use APRN as a hedge given the unknowns over the next 12 months. 4. I still look at Hello Fresh as a proxy for what is possible with a strong balance sheet and a good set of instiutional investors. HF is growing great and makes decent cash flows/margins. For APRN to achieve some of that growth, they definitely need cash infusion.5. Next quarter will mark the first quarter when we start seeing Y-o-Y growth in revenue. Likely will be the case for Q3 and Q4 as well now that they are lapping ""normalized"" quarters of 2019. A stock that grows in single digits and generates ~4% EBITDA margin is definitely worth more than ~0.3x that it trades at right now (90% discount to HF).In summary, I was disappointed by the earnings report/call and wish more was said to address investor concerns and update on strategic initiatives but I do feel that APRN may be grinding towards a slow path to a sustainable low-growth low-margin business not at a constant bankruptcy risk >> A $400M-$450M revenue business that generates $10-$15m EBITDA...something like 1-800-flowers (FLWS) which trades at ~1x revenue. Hope I am right!"
"At this price, someone is going to buy them. All the mistakes have been made already."

This is a bad sign?along with new competition. Why do you longs pick a #$%$ company like this, with no barriers to entry ?? Short via naked calls (too expensive to borrow stock). Even good earnings will be met with selling..."

Blue apron continues to trend down after reverse split.

This stock taught me a lesson. Never buy on the news. Because that’s when Day Traders/Shorts come to town. It’s their game. Not mine.
next week it’ll be below $1 and subject to d-listing
I got 100 shares for $1 if it splits what go happen?
"@mark ok. Mark... I took you’re advise let’s see what happens if bought back in 3.41 900 shares... 50 more shares then what I had. Same amount I pulled out now I have in, still down 900.00 but I have 50 more shares. Avg cost price is 4.40 a share. Did you buy more?"
"COVID-19 ain't going to be over until we make it through the Fall without a second wave of the virus. That is Q2, Q3, and some of Q4. That's a lot of earnings reports that will show improvements in key metrics. A lot of sentiment change can happen in that time. Not to mention, if D.E. Shaw launches an activist campaign, there is going to be a lot more eyes on this stock.Also, if you separate the stock from the actual company, you will realize that the STOCK is literally PRIMED for an explosion from a technical perspective. The 50 day moving average is about a week away from crossing the 200 day moving average. They call that a GOLDEN CROSS.I pray for those short this stock."
Carl Icahn is buying more shares of HERTZ HTZ. He owns over 40%. This stock was $20 30 days ago. Huge risky with high reward. I’m in long just like CARL ICAHN. Let’s go to $20. Time to go back to work. $UBER $JNUG $APRN $WTRH

Is this worth buying while it's so cheap?
"Wow, I haven't watched this stock in a few weeks. Why is it down today? Looks like a great buy."

Gambling time! I buy again! Let’s dance with crazy market!

I think it has something to do with BYND rumor
This is pretty bad
APRN is valued under 100 million and you say it has a management problem but businesses condition is good means someone will take over soon I see people at the grocery store running around picking up food for delivery for people to busy to shop soon more people will not what to even prepare there food
Great ER report. Bottom has been in place ! Oprah!

welcome to halloween boys. ha ha ha.
"""As we previously articulated, 2018 is a year of transition and building for the future,"" CEO Brad Dickerson said in the earnings release."
"My estimates for the profit margin in Q1 (correct me if you have other opinions):Revenue in Q1 2019 was 142m, in the last quarters the revenue decline was at round about -30%.Q1 2020 revenue (ex corona) would be around 100m. With double the revenue in second half of may it would be around 116m. COGS was 61% in Q4 2019, and Q1 is in general a quarter with higher margin, so lets assume 59% COGS (Gross profit: 48m)Lets assume marketing was cut by 50% in comparison with Q1 2019 (7m marketing costs).PTGA, D&A and other income should be the same as in Q4 2019 (44m).Profit = 48m - 7m - 44m = -3m (excl. special items like factory closing)So APRN is still not profitable but this will change in Q2."

"If we hold can hold at 1.52 today I’ll consider it a good day, yesterday’s push was on very low volume so I have faith, however I’ll be setting a tight stop loss as I just want out of this company now."
"So, quarterly revenue is greater than the market cap? Buy."
"Good afternoon everyone (except those of us long APRN). We had a good up-day followed by 2 down days. The good news is we are still above our recent lows of $6.50. I fear if we break 6, there is no support until the low 2s. While I don't believe we will go that low, where we end up is anyone's guess. Technicals are still down and all pointing at oversold. There have been other posters here commenting on transparency... or the lack of it with this management group. I would still love to know how much of the 4M shares they were able to sell and what their plans are for the cash infusion. Who knows... some guidance from the company might actually help the stock price.Have a great weekend everyone and hopefully next week will be better for us holding. Be safe and stay well."
"The new butcher bundles offering is a smart move. Need to continue to cater to the solid customer base. Anything Costco offers frozen, Blue Apron should be able to do the same. 400,000 paying customers. Let's increase the offering to include high-end Wagyu steaks, Lobster Tails and Rolls, Prime Burgers and Gourmet Hot Dogs for summer grilling! The right sourcing and offerings will go a long way to driving sustained profitability. Let's not forget the hard work is already done. We have the platform and customer-base. Now let's upsell!"

"I´m wondering why you guys are still investors in APRN. Hellofresh is now the clear market leader in the world (US: 50% market share, international: 75% market share) and is growing organically more than 40%, while having EBITDA-Margins of more than 10%. Why would you prefer APRN? Stock of Hellofresh is up 75% since IPO (2017), APRN is down more than 90%."
"And just like that....they all flock back. No fundamentals are being used in the market. Pure hope, speculation and forecast that depend solely on the Coronavirus spreading or beimg contained. People are looking for time frames that this will be stopped until then....."

Email went to customers saying firm has maxed out due to unprecedented demand.
Why should Hellofresh buy APRN with all their expensive warehouse and production center when they can easily aquire the customers themself. Hellofresh gained more subscribers in the last year than APRN has in total right now. I hold Hellofresh shares and really hope they just wait until APRN is bankrupt in late 2021 when they have to repay their 55m loan.
@Lora I completely disagree..cheaper than whole foods at least
"A few observations-1. They started taking orders for May 7 onwards delivery almost 10 days ago and May 7 is still available as a delivery date. So looks like the initial ""sold out"" phenomenon has slowed either due to lack of interest or increased capacity that they created.2. If you google meal-kits, you no longer see those $60/$80 off of your first box ads from all of the meal kit companies. The CAC will likely be much lower in the month of April helping their marketing expenses.3. The options open interest is the highest at $15 call (6600+ contracts). Call options at $11 or above exceed put options at $11 or below by a ratio of ~2.5x.Will say it again.. Q1 will largely come in line with expectations.. revenue decline of ~30% with net loss near $20M. Its the Q2 guidance that matters which I expect to be robust. Any positive update on strategic process (especially cash infusion) will also be a booster."

"Motley Fool and their anti Blue Apron agenda. Their owner or president (whatever) is on the board of the high end, fancy organic and overpriced grocery store owned by amazon (Whole Foods). So for them it’s quite the conflict of interests. -do they not realize that Whole Foods has a FAILING business model itself? Not sure what amazon was thinking buying it, but that had to be the golden parachute, since Whole Foods was in a consistent state of decline for years prior, |and even since amazon merger...it has gone nowhere. Sorry to say, but I could care less for 20 cents off a pound of chicken that’s regularly $9.99 just because I have a prime membership."
Was lucky and got in at 2.9. What is the next peak point you believe?
Reddit will eventually catch up with company. MS. K is doing a great job. We are subscribers. Superior to fresh by a long shot. Good marketing and continued user growth will pop this company upward like KOSS or AMC once the good turn around news becomes available.

"I finished listening to the cc. It was a bad 2nd quarter. No doubt. But they will be spending more $ on marketing and hopefully this will grow the subscriber base on a sequential basis for now. The CEO talked about pilot based on customers having more saying when they order. But this is common sense. They should have the most popular meals available at all times. Like McDonads with their Big Mac, or Burger King with their Whopper. When a customer craves a good recipe it should be available for then to buy. Having different recipes every week may be a turn off for customers who like consistency in their eating habits. For instance if curry chicken is a very successful recipe, it should always be readily available to customers. They will be spending more $ on building a better online platform. That's money well spent. They could try building a marketplace like they did with jet.com. jet.com is a joke. No one buys there. BA should had checked the Web traffic for jet.com before trying to sell in that platform."

Linda was in it for the green backs hired as a savior has done nothing on her watch almost zero founders are left except for Matt LOL rats jumped off a sinking sink a long time ago biggest IPO flop in modern history how much money did I lose ... a lot . I was its biggest cheerleader for a long time honestly thought Linda would save company never forget the earnings call couldn't fulfill orders due to labor issues and an Onion recall every earnings since IPO an absolute disaster ...It was all about the IPO simple as that founders walked away with millions the ONLY investors who made money were Hedge funds and retail shorts ...Millionaire maker for shorts

"Today: AMC up 280%, GME up 127%, KOSS up 560%! APRN up a nice 30%. All targets of the anti-shorters. I figure that $40+ gets APRN up to a good starting level."
"Very dangerous time for shorts. 25% short float going into earnings. I have some long options myself, as I like the technical pattern and COVID play, and even after they boosted their capacity they sell out of some things.Sure, the bears could be right, shorts have made a ton of money on this company's stock over the last few years. Some of them do some great research, and many just play the bets that have won in the past.If $APRN could ever mount a hard 180, this is the time... one full quarter of COVID lockdowns, and an extra 2 - 3 quarters before any distribution of vaccines lay ahead.The short float is so significant, that any good earnings news, combined with positive revision of 2020, will produce another spike like 16-18 March 2020. I am more than happy to take that risk/reward. Good luck Bulls."
"Just make customers happy with service and price, the stock will hit 20+"
Will pick itself up as you can see . It's adjusting and would not be surprise that this waiting will be worth it by summer.
"A complete lockdown is the ONLY solution unfortunately, whoever disregarded that is paying a heavy price (Italy), all Business As Usual stocks are booming now but will come crashing down once the situation gets out of control, India is in complete lock down and getting the situation under control, sooner we realize that, better for us . Services like APRN, WTRH will be really useful services soon, as that is the ONLY way to get out of this virus mess."
Cannacord says it will double.
whats up with liquidity? very low volume no avoiding $5s ahahahah
The entire country is essentially faced with a 30 day (minimum) lockdown. APRN is providing an essential service that's feeding hundreds of thousands of Americans while further protecting each and every customer by enabling them to stay at home. We know the company only has 8M shares in float and a short interest of 50%. We also know that the company has experienced a sharp increase in demand. All of these factors are the recipe (pun intended) for an epic short squeeze. If the longs stay strong this stock can easily see a five fold increase. Hold your shares and dry up the float. This company is worth much more than where we are now.

She said the constraints also led to a customer decline.My take: very reasonable price target adjustment, and clearly very positive for APRN."
Today was a great day for APRN. Only down (another) 12% . This is a great short. They have enough cash to last them 3-4 quarters and who in their right mind will give them more money!? So will be just an email list being sold if anything.

Except this time it's the opposite. The virus won't stop and America is going to be locked down real soon. Restaurants everywhere closed down. This is highway robbery buying at $10."
Read the motley crew article. The article talks about issues with selling at Sprout markets & how the retailer can easily make the meal kit locally (compete with BA with black label). The article is wrong on several counts. The article assumes BA has no brand value/loyalty and it assumes BA will sell at Sprout market instead of a more complimentary channel than Target or Costco. the article is right about one thing though - that sprout market can potentially prepare the meal kit at lower price than BA. The right approach for BA would be to setup a franchise outlet chain (+restaurant) of it's own and meet the customers in it's outlet. This will give them much needed cash flow
Blue Apron is up 15.50% to 9.24
"CNN Headline ""Blue Apron rebound may be on the menu as more cook at home""This company has no business being in business, its another millenial company run by people that don't understand capitalism."

"Dave ... easy now. While APRN has most certainly been boring, even after a very good ER, Blue Apron is a beauty. Here's why.Customers - Blue Apron has 396,000 customers in the United States (about 9% of HFG's global share and 20% of their US market). Market Place - Blue Apron only services the United States, the home of an uncontrolled explosion of COVID19. While other global markets might be getting this pandemic under control, that's absolutely not the case here in APRN's only market. As such, if they were able to add 200,000 customers in Q2, they will be able to add even more from Q3 to the time of a functional and widely distributed vaccine is out there. Revenue - APRN posted revenues for Q3 of $131M with earning of $1.1M while upping guidance for the year. That's about 10% of HFG's revenue guidance.Brand - Blue Apron has brand value and not just as the first meal kit company. In the cooking world, they have a recognized brand.Infrastructure - While I could not put a number on their hard and soft assets, APRN is not worthless, especially if they are able to make a profit.Market Cap - While it represents about 10% of HFG's market, APRN costs only 2% of HFG's market cap. So for those who think that another entity interested in entering or expanding their meal kit business (Amazon, Marley Spoon, HelloFresh, Krogers) wouldn't be looking at APRN, think again. Blue Apron is dirt cheap and it's single largest shareholder is its Chairman which would eliminate a lot of red tape.So what should APRN be trading at. I figure that most any suitor would find value in 10% of a market at only 5% of the cost. That would place APRN at about $25. The way I see it, eventually someone with both money and smarts will figure that out.Hang on in there Dave."
Netflix should do a documentary on Blue Apron would be either comedy or horror show they could interview all board members and original founders and ask them what happened ?? You were the number 1 meal kit in USA why did everyone jump ship ??

$8.29 is 200 MA. If broken $6.50 seems to be the next support.
"I had to make a decision about a month ago. Zoom or blue apron. I’m a little bit more risk in the market than conservative. The choice was zoom at $114 or blue apron at $9.50. Both are benefiting from covid 19. Zoom has major security breach and management immediately admits its mistake and hires the proper personnel to fix the problem. That builds confidence for me. This is why, imho, this stock is close to $170 now. 50% gain. Makes one think a little or a lot. Blue apron needs to install that confidence, for investors like me to be long. Aggressive, smart, proactive,innovative. I realize before the rebuttal comes that food and technology and market caps are different. I get it. I bought more of this stock at $11.55. As with anything in life, I sure could use some confidence that this company will seize its opportunity."

"Good afternoon all. We have had a couple of strong days in the past several weeks after touching lows of about $6.50 with all technicals signaling an oversold condition. We moved into the mid and high 7s a couple days and have once again found our way to 7. To me, this is actually good news for a couple reasons. One -- seems we found a shelf in the high 6s and low 7s -- which will be a good launching point up to double digits in anticipation of earnings for Q3. The other good note, in my opinion, is it took very little volume to cause these spikes. Any news at all... with even a hint of positive information, will cause this stock to jump. I think recent price dips have shaken out the weak hands -- including me. I cut my position in half reducing to 2000 shares but anticipate (or strongly hope) to find the high/mid 6 range again to double up. We are still in oversold territory with low daily volumes. Our new normal being defined by COVID and politics suggests we won't be going back to restaurants anytime soon the way we used to -- making companies like Blue Apron a good choice for families and for those looking for simplified meal plans or to avoid stores/crowds.Given past history I believe we will see APRN between 9-11 in coming weeks as we get closer to earnings assuming no other news is released. Looking to double up at $6.8 or less -- then potentially hold through earnings as I expect an upward surprise. JMHO. And to those shorting... seems a good time to get out as we don't seem to be headed significantly lower and you don't want to get stuck in a short squeeze. Better to get out when its quiet.Stay safe and be well."
"the morning squeeze tomorrow , hang on"
Did the party end?
"One of the worst concepts to ever come along by a bunch of degree holding nobodies with zero experience in the food industry. Why didn't REAL food veterans try this? Because they knew it was a stupid idea. All of a sudden these geniuses think they have a magic idea when REAL food veterans were laughing at them. Would you bring your car in for repairs to your dentist? Thats what your doing with your money in this stock. ZERO experience, burn thru more cash than a biotech, cant keep customers, only grow new customers by spending every last dollar on advertising, no value in any of their leased wharehouse space, no value in inventory. no value in customer base. There will never be a buyout or acquisition in this absolutely ridiculous company run by zero experience amateurs. Seriously, who gave these guys money? They should be sued. They ""invented"" a concept that can be replicated by anyone with half a brain. They suckered all of you. Next time do a little research on who started a food company with zero, I mean ZERO food experience. Its laughable."
These home delivery companies are doing so much for the community.!!! I hope NY get back on its feet soon. So sad what's happening over there.
"I forgot to mention CEO said the 4% lay offs were not factory workers but salaried (management?). Always a positive thing when a company trims this fat ($16M in this case) also shares short decreased this last month. Beat earnings last 3q. I’m not saying they will make it, but they are making moves in right direction. Listen to CC and read actual earnings release, not an article that takes things out of context."
"Not saying this is a great stock bcuz it’s not, but I have to consider that it makes a nifty run after tax-loss sellers are finished. If you buy 10k shares at these prices and it goes to 1.50 that’s a nice win. Just saying!"
its painful owning this stock

"Nice run tomorrow Over sold , market sentiment is negative for all market everywhere, don’t panic and stay strong , keep your shares ! Buy out is around the corner and expect over $8++"
"Let's hope that Blue Apron's management and BOD does not accept any offers for a secondary offering, like what happened today with Beyond Meat. That how the shorts rig the system. When they see they can't cover their short positions at attractive prices, they then approach the company (disguised as a reputable financial firm) for a secondary offering. This way they use the shares to cover their short positions. It's downhill from here for Beyond Meat. With the founders of Blue Apron so heavily invested in the company I don't think they'll let something like this happen. APRN wlll fly to uncharted territories if we don't let the shorts off the hook."
"Expect $4+ After earning, will reach over $8+"
"Maybe the trick to,APRN’s survival is just selling their receipts to ready made meals instead of cooking ingredients, do it yourself. Costco lives off that grab and go meals.APRN can also get into the weight loss meal kit space. It’s a huge market! They should also partner up with the Mayo Clinic for the diabetes and obesity patients, which would retain customers a lot longer. Just my thoughts."
"This is a stock which I always intended to short since I don't believe that people who don't cook do so because they can't figure out how to buy the ingredients. Obviously, many others feel the same way. However, my guess is that the shorts are doubling up here at 1.44 and are due for another squeeze before the close, so I bought a couple of thousand shares."
I hope to see $18 this year .. make me happy Apron :)
"Instead of recipes, aprn should address their cash crunch. But I guess real company issues have never been a concern to its founders and endless management. Criminal!"

FDA's Director just announced the therapy or vaccine could get up to 6 months to year to develop. This will be a long battle people. It will not end in next month or two months. Super markets will be closing every where. APRN will be a gold company to invest. Great time to buy and hold!

"Now with UberEat, McDonald stock is doing very well because a lot of people are ordering McDonald through UberEat. Don't they know that they are getting screw by McDonald and other fast food companies? People are falsely believe fast food restaurants cheap. I live in the East Coast. If you buy a meal from McDonald comprising a ""premium"" burger, medium fries, and medium soft drink, you are spending $11 with tax. Now if you have it delivers you are looking at roughly $16-$20 depending on how far the delivery is. If you give tips to the driver you are spending $20 plus on a meal that is unhealthy, not nutritious, and doesn't taste good. For the same price, I believe you get two meals for two persons. With Blue Apron, you get to eat nutritious, delicious, and healthy cuisine. Granted you have to prepare it yourself but you know what goes into your food. You know the ingredients are high quality. And it doesn't take the much time to prepare. Because of that I believe Blue Apron can turn this ship around. Blue Apron should target affluent young professional white consumers."

"BLUE APRON, phone is ringing off the hook, CDC announced, prepare for community OUTBREAK of CORONAVIRUS."
leap PUTs are going up faster than gold :)
"I’m expecting a nice rise today, anyone else?"
"look at the abyss ahead, wow...$3 in a matter of weeks"
Lets all stop and appreciate that Aprn will be making us bank and helping people in such a time of need! Win-Win! Well............As long as you a certain height! ha.
"Hey longs, do you have that sinking feeling in your stomach that you have been had. That the much touted reverse stock split is nothing more than a three card monty scheme? To be minted a bag holder is bad. But to have it happen in front of your eyes is too much to bear. There will always be touts that claim this stock will climb back. But you know it is over and you are holding the bag."
Nice volume
Oprah cooking no thanks. She can't get her portions right. 
I warned the short sellers last night it would gap up again and apron will eat your lunch. Where are they with that brave negativity now?
"bad sign, this should be a day blu would be up wi9th mkt tanking :("
"After so much struggle, this could very well be the key turning point for aprn. Their ability to source and ship premium food and grocery will take away a big chunk out of the wholefoods and other upscale markets. Finally aprn coming out ready to swing and battle."
"here's what I dont get, they have 355M in assets and 234 in liabilities, how is it market cap only around 52M at current price? It also looks like they are on track to finally have a quarter in the black"
The promotional deals on the APRN website have dropped in recent weeks. This is very bad news. How can people that want free food survive? The offices of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have offered to investigate this anti-social behavior.
Correct me if I’m wrong but it’s a strong performance today ?
SEEING THE GREEN MONDAY.ENJOY YOUR DINNER TONIGHT.
My bet is Costco will buy them out.
Nice little recovery already. Green today? What do you think?
Plenty of time to short this to zero.
I’ve never understood the logic behind someone selling half a million shares plus at a loss. Is it to take out stop losses?
"This stock can now go up in a healthy way. That pump was mad, once it will reach 20 again, the shorts are coming fully prepared."
