March delivery numbers might be released tomorrow
Problem has been fixed. Takes less than 20 minutes. Most planes didn't even have an issue
Someone is dumping shares to try to hold this back and the just keep getting bought up. Love it! Should pass 260 soon. Burn shorts burn!
best recovery stock this year and beyond.
"Shorts are still in denial. They don't realize TSA traveler checkpoints are over 1,500,000a day now. They don't understand the direct correlation between the air travel increases and need for more airplanes.Say hello to $350."
"Boeing Biden plane escalator, patent pending."
The Mighty Jin Dak sees nothing but GREEN highways to $500!
"i think we get it, you're short, do we need a tick by tick update about a stock in a downtrend?"
JNJ vaccine pulled
"Aviation weekNew aircraft orders and some delivery-position shuffling has helped Boeing cut the number of unsold 737 MAXs in its inventory to about 60, an Aviation Week analysis shows. The company’s March order-book tally of 185 737 MAXs included sales of 61 already-constructed commercial MAX variants"
"If you are selling BA because they need to fix some planes (Which could be a 1 day fix), then you should not have owned BA in the first place."
"No way to make money short term against these criminals. Buy and hold, or get out."
Jin and associates:
"All longs still missing the issue that increase in travel numbers, relaxing travelling conditions will not help Boeing until the latest grounding of planes ends and electrical issues fixed, which seems to have have broadened in scope and complexity, and creating a suffocating cash crunch for a beleaguered Boeing that has already suffered a lot!!!"
"Couple of highlights from the earnings report:Cash flow is still negative burning through $41M per day.Debt increased by $4BIt will take the rest of the year to fix the structural flaws in the 100 787s in storageThere are 400 737s in storage, only 200 will be delivered this yearDomestic air travel is increasing and is over 50% of pre-pandemic levels but international is only at 11% The China market is critical to Boeing$318M write off on Air Force 1 contract737 electrical fix is simple"
Boeing  crash  at noon today? I figured another one in Indonesia  $241 to $231
Back to $235 tomorrow?
Elon: I'm in charge of the Mars Operation.Boeing Airlines:
i love this forum now.
The stock up substantially in 2021 but can reach $300 with a massive orderfrom Southwest.
"say goodbye to 230's is gone for the rest of this quarter, BA has been hyped & pumped and now its over.."
Travel demand is the one element that will force Boeing as well as Airbus to shoot up this summer. Don't fight it.
"A recovery in leisure travel is ""in full swing"" and airline bookings are improving, analysts at Bank of America say, raising their expectations for share prices for a few of the U.S. air carriers such as Southwest and Delta."
"Over 250 by Wednesday, and then on to 300."
"Travel is returning quickly. We didn't have a single day above 1+ million passengers from March 2020 to October 2020....January 2021 we had 3x 1+million days, February we had 7x 1+million days, March we had 26 1+ million days, April we are at 26 consecutive 1+ million days......normal travel numbers pre-pandemic were consistently between 2.2 million and 2.5 million.International travel will take longer but as long as domestic flights are picking up in multiple countries airlines will feel more comfortable buying new planes. Not just because they want new planes, but the 737 Max is 8% more cost effective. That doesn't sound like much, but when it saves $500,000 per year per plane on fuel (calculated using estimated mileage for a commercial jet per year and fuel prices)....that adds up when margins are extremely tight and you run 100+ jets. Fuel costs are also rising again from their pandemic lows as consumption ramps up."
"Foxitis sufferers are blaming jb for inflation. Yup getting vaccines out and the economy back on track, terrible!"
Buy Now!
"For people upset about sports applying political pressure on states, it appears they’ve forgotten the only reason Atlanta even *has* a baseball team is because in 1965 the city agreed to integrate seating at Fulton County Stadium as a condition for the Milwaukee Braves to move."

The airline has received the first three while four more are due later this month."
"Update: WH and FAA not happy the way Boeing disclosed the issue:“ U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said regulators wanted to ensure ""full confidence"" in the planes forced to halt flights on Friday, before they could fly again.LATE NIGHT SCRAMBLEAlthough dozens of flights had to be canceled, Friday's fallout was tiny compared to the global outcry following two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.But Boeing's reaction to the fault underscored how much is at stake as it tries to rebuild confidence in its benchmark jet.It scrambled late Thursday to brief staff, regulators and airlines on the issue, people familiar with the matter said.It is seen as keen to demonstrate transparency after criticism for its initial defensive reaction to the cockpit safety issue that led to the 737 MAX grounding in 2019. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would ensure the issue was addressed.”"
I can't wait until this stock hits $500. It will be here sooner than you think.
Ok Volume is extremely low. Not good. Come Monday we give up today’s gain if it lasts
"Historically, Alaska Airlines is known for taking all of its options. Those will be transformative for the airline. If Alaska continues that trend with taking all of its options, it will certainly have a sizable fleet of the planes that could go toward replacing some older Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft.Alaska’s fleet planThe Boeing 737 MAX 9s are part of Alaska’s fleet modernization and simplification plan. After merging with Virgin America, Alaska Airlines operated a dual fleet of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family aircraft. The long-term goal was always for Alaska Airlines to move away from an Airbus fleet"
Boeing confirmed to Forbes that the new electrical system issue is not related to the software system problems that were partly blamed for the two deadly crashes more than two years ago that led to the 737 MAX grounding.
JB setting a 200 million dose target for first 100 days. States opening up vaccines to all adults. Way to go. Far cry from DJT promising 20 million and delivering 4 million.
"Wow, Dow near 300 point up and BA can't move above $252! Hedge funds are brutal!"
"On Sunday morning, a contract between Boeing and Teamsters Local 174 was officially ratified after a tentative agreement had been reached Saturday, avoiding a strike.According to Boeing, “We’re pleased that our employees represented by the Teamsters ratified a new four-year contract.

"""But on Monday, O’Leary said Boeing had not delivered 14 aircraft expected in April and May, accusing the US company of mishandling its relationships with safety regulators — a particularly sensitive issue following the crashes.Boeing paused deliveries of the Max in April over an electrical issue, and promised to catch up on deliveries through the rest of the year. “I think it’s disappointing and unacceptable. Certainly, if they’re treating the regulator with the same radio silence that they’re treating customers, I’d be very worried about the durability of the aircraft,” O’Leary said on a company results call on Monday.""LOL"

Federal Reserve Chair Powell said yesterday he expected to see a very strong economic recovery later this year. Wow !

"The $64,0000 question is when will BA hit $500? Travel keeps increasing. It can't be that far off?"
"Why It’s Important: On Monday, BofA Securities analyst Andrew Didora said domestic leisure air travel bookings were down just 22.4% in the most recent week compared to 2019 levels, the first time leisure bookings were down less than 30% since the beginning of the pandemic.“The combination of further progress on vaccine distribution, the re-opening of states, the relaxation of quarantines (NY domestic travel quarantine goes away April 1), and the start of peak leisure travel season should continue to drive positive travel headlines over the coming weeks,” the analyst said."
BA is very strong upward momentum. Air travel is increasing
$230 please
Did I thank the shorts again. This next run I will buy a A 63 bought and paid fir the shorts again on ba. 2 yr wait here in Canada will put a order this weekend. How awesome
"@Jin, no disrespect intended, but your obsession with unrealistic price targets lead me believe that you are one of those long term investors who got caught in the coronavirus financial meltdown and originally bought over $400, and can’t get out now. GL to you!"
Reuters needs to be shut down along with the hedge funds they cater to daily!!
"Have a good and safe weekend, everyone!"
Will comeback
I guess the market says Boeing is not a reopening stock
"Where is UrMoney today? You know, the one that has th vocabulary of a 4 year old. I expected him to be scribbling today about how BA is a bad investment. Good thing I didn't listen to him when he told me to sell at $96 because it was going to $25.He should look at himself in the mirror with his cute little hat on, and let that handsome look sink in."
The space program should add billions to profits on the military side
RED DOW JONES means BUY BOEING!
Tomorrow is another day and BA will begin to rise again like it has for the past 14 months. We are only half way to where it should be. Travel demand is increasing every day.
Makes you think insiders have better info on a day like this
"$250 tomorrow, yes I think so."
"Travel rebound and war escalated but this is still in red. It has to reach 244 to enter buy zone. Reuters is a pimp whose intention is to do as much damage as possible to Boeing . China is entering the jet market this year. This stock is stuck in a mud , moving 4 steps ahead and coming 3 steps back. There is hardly any week when there is no negative news"

My sentiment has changed from neutral to Buy.....I also see a demand not only for Commercial but Boeing Military side as global tension is Very High.

"Xiamen Airlines told the Global Times that it is modifying its Boeing 737 MAX jets after Boeing issued technical guidelines for the carrier, a necessary preparation before the planes return to service.The comment came after reports circulated online that Xiamen Airlines is preparing to return its 737 MAX fleet to service after years of being grounded.Bloomberg reported on April 1 that state-owned China Eastern is negotiating with Boeing over a potential Max order."
After March numbers come out we go straight up to $275 any minute now
"Their 737 MAX Project has been a catastrophic failure by all accounts. In the same amount of time and at fewer costs, they could have developed a new, state-of-the-art, single-aisle aircraft; instead, they cut corners to push out a ""remodel"" of a 1960's aircraft. The consequence has resulted in the death of priceless human lives, the loss of billions of dollars and of a world-class safety reputation built over +40 years. BOEING will have a long way to go to recoup what was lost in their decision to push this aircraft onto the market. All power to the innovators and ""newer"" manufacturers (largely supersonic jet) seeking to dethroned this government-subsidized legacy business!"

Coco seeing this up ......and it hurting you so much ..... really just makes everybody buy more!
As the 737 Max inventory reduces Boeing will be able to set the price higher for the 737's. Airlines have to replace their planes so what is it going to be Boeing or Airbus. I believe it will be Boeing and there is the China deal coming out within the next month. Long and strong Boeing.
It may go high due to J&J news.
$WIMI $BA $NIO I believe this stock will give an opportunity on Monday to enter at a good price. Just my speculation not recommendation or advice.
"Masks are allowed off out of nowhere? lol. What happened? This crumbling leadership is too see-through. This will be great for Boeing, the airlines, and travel though!!"
"Another downgrade by Ferry, Jorgensen and Hearn on Boeing just now!!!"
"Too much emphasis was put on the latest top management changes. You don't fire the top guy who's only been in the job a year and inherited a mess and is making progress in fixing a lot of problems with Boeing. Secondly, restoring a dividend isn't practical and anyone factoring it into future price projections is deluding themselves. Thirdly, maybe it would have been better if the CFO could have stayed another year but at least the company will have him through the transition to a new financial chief that the market can have respect for. Fourthly there are more sophisticated investors betting against the stock. There was someone today that bought 480 June 180 puts. Bottomline I love the stock and am long. I just would like to see things calm down a bit."
TRAVEL SURGE!

Why does smart money know the news well before general market
Despite the somewhat anemic response of BA to the SW news this is a huge win for Boeing since SW was considering an Airbus plane.
Wake me up when BA hits $813.77.
Markets are not independent silos anymore. When you have crpto markets lose 30 to 40 percent of their value quickly something that has tangible value must be sold or you go bust. It is no coincidence that the go to tangible value is in the tech heavy Nasdaq that has seen some of its stellar performers take a serious haircut. Unfortunately the indexes like the DOW and S&P haven't been immune either which explains in large part why Boeing won't see any sustainable rally until Bitcoin is completely washed out. This situation is no different than the VIX blowup that created mayhem in the markets and caused some big players to close their doors. At the root of that crisis were gamblers who were betting that volatility would remain low forever and rolled over their VIX contracts continously and watched the cash roll in. It was better than CDs....Until volatility spiked....I've been around 40 years and I've seen gambling and outright greed. We pay for it....

"While it did not state the variant to be introduced, the carrier had previously disclosed in its 2019 annual results that it expected to take up to 46 737 Max aircraft between 2020 and 2021, but that these had to be deferred indefinitely following the type’s global grounding.

On the contrary, Boeing stock has increased by 12%, 10%, and 4% over the twenty one-day, ten-day, and five-day period respectively. Per Boeing’s commercial market outlook, global passenger traffic and aircraft fleet are expected to grow annually by 4% and 3.2% in the next twenty years, respectively. Also, new aircraft demand will mostly be driven by older aircraft replacements, almost 56% of new deliveries, in the coming decade."

"Boeing has revealed delivery figures for its commercial and defense operations for the first quarter of 2021. The figures reflects a 54% surge in commercial shipments from the first quarter of 2020. Defense shipments rose 7.7%.Boeing reported commercial deliveries of 77 airplanes in first-quarter 2021 compared with 50 aircraft delivered in the first quarter of 2020. The rise in the year-over-year delivery figure could primarily be attributable to the return of the 737 MAX into service in November 2020, thus boosting the company’s first-quarter plane deliveries.In its defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 42 in first-quarter 2021, which witnessed a slight improvement from 39 dispatched in the prior-year period (read more: Boeing Reports Solid Q1 Commercial & Defense Deliveries)."

"Boeing was $350 to $380 per share prior to the pandemic, this was while the 737 Max had been grounded for over a year already......based on inventory levels of nearly 70 billion worth of jets already manufactured and ready for delivery. Big chunk of jet cost is paid upon delivery. So as long as our rate of deliveries outpaces production for the next 2+ years this is a solid cash flow story. Still has over 4,000 jets in their order log once Boeing ramps back up. Orders log was deeply red last year with big cancellations....that trend is already changing with net positive orders this year and 77 jets delivered in Q1"

"The stock is going to remain extremely range bound and pressured until the Max electrical problem is fixed, it's really as simple as that. No Max deliveries until that happens, and that is going to have a severely negative effect on April deliveries, Boeing already warned the market about that. And now we're 10 days into May and still no approved fix, so you're seeing 30% of May deliveries being impacted. Let this go to the end of this week and you'll be seeing half of May deliveries impacted. That's a lot of monthly revenue BA is losing. To get the stock price to accelerate upward, the market needs something tangible like resumed deliveries and resumed revenue. Until that happens, most big fund traders aren't going to speculate on BA. The Max electrical issue is dragging on long enough that it's probably going to have a measurably negative impact on 2Q earnings, especially if we get all the way to the end of May and still don't have a fix. Speculation and gambling isn't what fund managers are paid to do. Once the fix is approved, the price will head back upwards."

"Emirates could swap Boeing 777x for smaller Dreamliners, chairman saysReuters May 17, 2021 08:22:00 AM ET DUBAI, May 17 (Reuters) - Emirates could swap some of its order for 126 Boeing 777X jets for smaller 787 Dreamliners as part of a sweeping review of its future fleet requirements, its chairman said on Monday.""We are assessing our fleet requirement as we speak,"" Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum told reporters in Dubai."

Thank You Shorts!
"Baird says add to Boeing on any weakness due to 'tiny fix' needed for MAX jets 10:06 BA After Boeing announced a temporary grounding of certain 737 MAX aircraft from a small batch of production aircraft that may or may not have proper fastening on a backup power system within the flight deck, Baird analyst Peter Arment said that ""on the surface"" this appears to be ""a very minor issue"" that will require a ""tiny fix."" The analyst, who thinks the grounding could last as little as a few hours or potentially a few days, would look to add to Boeing positions on this headline risk, especially given what he sees as the progress being made on overall deliveries. Arment keeps an Outperform rating and $306 price target on Boeing shares."
BA continues to lead in technology and innovation like the OSPREY

"To meet future demand for long-haul connectivity, especially to North America and Europe, Boeing forecasts a market for 260 new wide-body airplanes such as the 787 Dreamliner. Carriers in the South Asian nation are expected to need 1,960 new single-aisle airplanes over the next 20 years."
"If you look at this from 270s and onward, there is still incredible value in BA long term. Sry I dont day trade. There is $100 to $150 upside in this stock over 2022 and beyond. BA will continue to have a great flow of MAX aircraft, defense contracts, and even exposure to air and space programs. You have Asia markets, Southwest, Airtravel returning, and other airlines taking advantage of the current market to get the fuel efficient MAX. There is a lot to look at as a long term investor FROM THIS POINT."

I changed my mind. not 330 and not 400. 430!. been holding Boeing ever since May last year~
"Boeing received the following orders in March:Southwest Airlines ordered 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.United Airlines (UAL) ordered 25 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.Alaska Airlines (ALK) ordered 32 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.777 Partners ordered 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.An unidentified customer ordered 3 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.A Business Jet/VIP customer ordered 1 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.The Australian Navy ordered 2 Boeing P-8s, the anti-submarine warfare and reconnaissance variant of the Boeing 737 Next Generation.The US Navy ordered 9 Boeing P-8s."

"If it can hold up here for an appreciable time, both shorts and the 227.50 call sellers are going to have to start thinking about covering, which will obviously put more upward pressure on the price. Let's see how it goes. Still got an hour and 40 minutes to go, and $0.50 isn't much of a ceiling. I'd say if it can break through 228.50 or 229, there's a really good chance of it holding there."

The March deliveries prove the world is preparing for travel. Boeing will boost at a faster pace from here on. Any less than $325-$350 day is totally undervalued.
Wall Street is so nice to let people buy shares under $300. This is hilarious to watch the bears out on a two hour inspection of an electrical wire that powers a back up generator. Meanwhile the delivery numbers and the resumption of air travel is here. Now. Boeing under $300 is a no brainer addition.
Add to your position of BABA Great buying opportunity On Sale !

Due you guys realize the actual battle of a few of longs went thru. I was calling 300 back in November under 150. If you go back and see when I bought . Shorts that’s 120 bucks in 5 months .

Ba now is 350 guys if not 500 so load up I did last Friday and do not panic not a time this yr have we not come off highs to lower prices to make the higher prices look like you were a genius. Congrats to all longs it’s been a honour to put my money to work to help drive the price up. We’re all a team and as a Grouo we could make a difference and we surly have

On the other hand, airlines took a lesson from the pandemic: they can do a lot more with less thus avoid having to purchase more airplanes."
"Neos, Italy’s second-largest Italian airline has received official approval from the US Department of Transportation to operate scheduled passenger flights to and from the United States.

Boeing   trivia:WHAT FALLS FASTER? Boeing planes out of the sky OR it’s stock price?
"Boeing is the 11th-largest holding in the newly launched ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT:ARKX). As the world's second-largest maker of commercial airplanes and a leading aerospace company, Boeing has a clear role to play in the burgeoning space industry. Boeing's Defense, Space, and Security segment is a prime contractor for NASA's Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket for human space exploration. Boeing also builds satellites and software systems for commercial, military, and scientific exploration."
Prediction 6 month BA will touch $300 to $325 price target
"April 1 (Reuters) - Fiji Airways said on Thursday it had received approval from its national aviation regulator to return its Boeing Co 737 MAX planes to service after a two-year grounding following two deadly crashes.The airline is the first operator in the Asia-Pacific region to confirm that its national regulator will allow flights to resume following additional crew training, including in the carrier's 737 MAX flight simulator.Australia and Japan had already approved the return of the 737 MAX and New Zealand on a case by case basis, but those countries do not have locally-based operators."

Boeing Gets Ready To Resume 737 MAX Productionhttps://simpleflying.com/boeing-737-max-production-restart/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter
"The new Alaska Air deal comes just a day after Boeing said it sold 100 new 737 MAX-7 jets to long-time customer Southwest Airlines, in its biggest order win since the safety ban was lifted.Earlier this month, the planemaker won orders for 24 of the 737-8 model from a backer of Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines.The 737-9 is expected to use 20% less fuel and reduce emissions by 20% per seat compared with airplanes it replaces, Boeing said in a statement."

"American isn't alone in rebuilding its business. Southwest Airlines said Thursday it needs all flight attendants back at work this summer, and it is recalling the 2,700 who are on voluntary leaves of absence. After temporarily furloughing crewmembers, United is back to hiring, offering jobs to 300 new pilots. And Delta is bringing back about 400 of its pilots."
"BA was heading to $300 on the resurgence of 737 Max flying and new orders for planes. Then both AAL and UAL CEO's came on CNBC to downplay the ""back to normal trade"" by saying that the future is unknown (no kidding) and that Business Travelers are still lagging.Instead of promoting travel, talking up the vaccines, exploding pent of demand...........they opt to be negative, non-committal and wet blankets.WHY? Lower expectations are easier to beat? If they are afraid to lay out plans to meet an improving COVID environment....they should stay home and stay off TV."

"A close observation of Delta Air Lines’ scheduled New York to Los Angeles reveals that the airline has upgraded the aircraft it primarily uses on the route.

However, Delta has not yet indicated if these planes are here to stay on the route, but there is a strong argument for the upgrade of plane type to stay."

The two planes come from Air Lease Corporation’s order book with Boeing and are the last of five Dreamliners the big leasing outfit will send to China Southern Airlines.beyond the short term, the Dreamliner may prove a much better fit for China Southern than its more high profile A380s. The 787-9 Dreamliner has the range to cover most if not all of China Southern’s A380 routes. And the Dreamliner can do so for far less money.The Dreamliner can land in more airports than the A380 (which require expanded apron space and modified jetbridges). The Dreamliners agility and cost efficiencies make it a compelling proposition for most airlines as they look to phase out bigger, more expensive planes."

Criminal investigation in process
"Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. will need to inspect hundreds of undelivered 737 Max jets for a potential flaw in their electrical power systems, said people familiar with the matter.About 450 Max planes built since early 2019 could potentially require repairs, a total that includes about 90 aircraft in commercial operation, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Boeing earlier Friday instructed airlines to ground dozens of recently delivered 737 Max jets to check for the manufacturing defect.The problem renews scrutiny of the upgraded 737 model, whose success is critical to helping Boeing recover from the coronavirus pandemic after burning through $20 billion in cash last year. While analysts expect the affected planes to be flying within a few days, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg underscored the heightened concerns around the Max after two fatal crashes prompted the longest jetliner grounding in U.S. history. “We need to make sure there’s full confidence before these specific aircraft return to the air,” he said at a White House briefing. The Federal Aviation Administration will closely monitor the situation, he said.The production flaw “could affect the operation of a backup power control unit,” the FAA said in a statement. The agency said it’s in contact with the airlines and Boeing “and will ensure the issue is addressed.” The temporary flying halt disrupted travel as airlines rushed to line up replacement aircraft. U.S. carriers including Southwest Airlines Co., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. parked a combined 67 of the workhorse planes Friday, about a third of all Max jets in service worldwide. The manufacturing glitch affects a subset of aircraft at 16 airlines, not the entire Max fleet, Boeing said in a statement.Most of the affected planes are still in storage and already face a lengthy check-up before they will be handed over to customers. Boeing wouldn’t disclose how many planes will need to be inspected for the manufacturing glitch.“We’re taking steps in production to correct this potential issue and ensure it has been addressed in every airplane we deliver,” said Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal. Boeing is “implementing short- and long-term corrective actions to address the issue prior to resuming aircraft deliveries,” a European Union Aviation Safety Agency spokesman said.Faded LusterWhile the problem isn’t related to the flight-control system that was at the center of the Max’s nearly two-year grounding, it takes some of the luster off the comeback of Boeing’s most important product. U.S. regulators lifted the flying ban in November, clearing Boeing to resume delivering the jets for the first time since March 2019. The 737 provided a sales lift with a bumper commitment from Southwest, which had publicly flirted with a smaller single-aisle jet made by Airbus SE.“The fix seems to be well understood and timing would depend on availability of technicians and equipment access,” Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies with a buy rating on the stock, wrote in a research note to clients. “Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption.” Boeing fell 1% to $252.36 at the close in New York, the third-largest drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The shares have gained 18% this year, nearly double the Dow’s increase.The newest disclosure is the latest in a string of quality lapses and manufacturing flaws that have damaged Boeing’s reputation and afflicted its 787 Dreamliner, KC-46 military aerial tanker and Starliner spacecraft. The aerospace titan also has fired and sued a subcontractor on another high-profile project: turning two 747 jumbo jets into the next Air Force One fleet to haul U.S. presidents.The electrical issue disclosed Friday was discovered by Boeing mechanics “on a production airplane during normal build activity,” according to a message to customers that was reviewed by Bloomberg. Operators were notified just hours after a separate email had touted the growing number of flight hours and planes in service since the grounding ended. “Boeing has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process that occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019, which means 24 of our 737 Max aircraft are not affected by this issue,” David Seymour, American’s operations chief, said in a message to employees.While Chicago-based Boeing is still working with regulators to finalize the repairs needed, it doesn’t anticipate the procedures will be lengthy. “It could take a matter of hours or a few days,” said Kowal, the Boeing spokeswoman.Airline ImpactSouthwest said it pulled 30 Max 8 jets from its schedule, adding that it is flying only 15 of its 58 Max planes daily"
"""April 12 (UPI) -- Production of Norway's first P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft is underway, manufacturer Boeing announced on Monday.Norway, which Boeing said in a press release will likely receive its first P-8A by the end of the year, plans to use the aircraft to replace its 40-year-old legacy fleet of P-3C Orion aircraft.The Royal Norwegian Air Force was approved to purchase five P-8As in a 2016 contract which included additional engines, Tactical Open Mission Software, AN/APY-10 radars, missile warning sensors and additional equipment. The deal was estimated to cost $1.75 billion.The contract was part of a $2.46 billion agreement by which Boeing will build 19 of the aircraft, with 10 assigned to the U.S. Navy, four to Britain and five to Norway.The P-8A is a military variation of the Boeing 737 Next-Generation commercial aircraft."""
next week the march over $300 begins in earnest and those fighting to drag us down will be pulling us up.
"Boeing could do well in May if it manages to break above a key level, Piper Sandler senior technical research analyst Craig Johnson said in the same “Trading Nation” interview.“This is a stock that has sold off 7% over the month of April,” he said.“It’s coming right back into a big area of support right around 300, and from our perspective, any sort of move above this ... 369 level is going to just open the door for a whole [new] leg higher,” Johnson said. “This is a stock that we think should be bought here and I think it will be a winner.”Boeing shares closed down nearly 1% at $234.31 on Friday."

"This movement also shows the importance to novice investors of patience and investing without emotion. Invest your money based on fundamentals, not on an emotional feeling of wanting to get rich quick. If that's what you're in the market for, you might just as well go to Vegas. Do your research, determine what you believe a stock is actually worth based on the underlying fundamentals of the corporation (or fund), NOT on what you ""hope"" it will be, and if there's a profit there, invest and don't worry about temporary market swings. If the company is worth a certain price, it *will* get there eventually. On a daily basis, the market seems chaotic. Over the long-term, however, the market is fundamentally rational. Take the long-term view after doing proper research and you'll make your money. But if you start freaking out over temporary market fluctuations, that's a sure way to lose a ton of money. BA is worth probably around $100+ *more* than it's trading today. The company has lots of hurdles to overcome over the next few years, so it will NOT get there overnight. There WILL be days or even weeks where it will fall and stagnate. But patience will bring you a nice, fat profit."

"big funds have been short BA for 2 months , get on board and borrow shares for the ride down to 200 or lower!!this BA is headed much lower make some nice $$$$ ........$short"
"I am so scared; market is ripe for correction. May, traditionally considered a sell month, has started. Calhoune has already got his millions in bonuses and salary and perk increases and now blaming FAA for Boeing lingering issues and ongoing investigations, US watch dog investigating Max 737 recertification. OMG, why did I buy this stock!!!!"
180 is coming.
Ba is the only green stock in my list
Electrical issues will be dealt with shortly. A PR will go out soon.
"Breaking ""Boeing's 737 Max aircraft under scrutiny again"""
"The total dollar value of the order is in excess of $10 billion over the next decade, according to analysts. Rumors of a deal helped bolster Boeing shares earlier this month."
"I am so scared, with April delivery numbers to come out soon, and market ripe for correction, cash crunch, secondary shares offer, omg, omg, omg!!!!"
If you are looking for Jin and associates (Frank/Dave/Annoymous/etc. They are at the lemonade stand selling pop corn and cold lemonade!!!
"@Anonymous, Jin has left a bucket  of lube for you and other associates! He thinks all of you might be feeling too sore after the sour margarita drink,lol!"
"FAA apparently not agreeing to Boing electrical fix bulletins which reads ""Fly at your own risk""!"
Maybe BA should start testing their planes before they sell them to unsuspecting customers?
"Congrats Longs, it is just beginning like I told you. BA is going to JUMP to new levels. $400 will come around this year. I am going to pour my wife and I a ""Jin Dak on the Rox"" tonight!"

"Market manipulation is illegal in the United States under both securities and antitrust laws. Securities laws and related SEC rules broadly prohibit fraud in the purchase and sale of securities, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 9, specifically makes it unlawful to manipulate security prices."
This stock is broken. Smart money says so.
"Too many orders, too much increased travel, too much vaccinated pent-up travel demand, too low of a stock.Way toooooooooo undervalued."
Another dip that people should be buying into. Your not going to get these opportunities later this year. Not at this price.
AIRBUS had two Airworthiness Directives issued this week. One for fuel pumps and one for oxygen systems. Noise around the Max is just that — Noise. This is a buy and hold!

"We are planning a trip to Europe this fall and are concerned about how poorly most of Europe is doing. A notable exception is the UK where Boris imposed a strict lockdown and used the socialized health system to distribute the vaccine efficiently. Checking the rest of Europe Sweden, the darling of the right wing, is in the middle of a huge spike with the highest infection rate in Europe last week. Oh well."
With the state department telling people not to travel over sea's that can't be good for Boeing in the short term Probably drop into the high 230's tomorrow. Thats when I will pick some more shares. This is long term for me I can wait it out
230 by closing today
"Watch how this plays out: if the price stays much below around 228.50 for a while, some big whale who sold a ton of 227.50 naked calls is going to use their credit line to borrow a big basket of shares and dump them all at once to try to pressure this back down below 227.50 before the close. You can read it like a book."
"Market needs a 10% correction in order to go higher. Keep buying, Boeing will lead the way when market turns and goes up."
love the pumpers cheer as they are still down 9.00 from pre-earnings 244.00...LOL!! this stock is Shiatsu!

"Uh oh, here comes BA again!"
"Nearly six months after Boeing first acknowledged it might sell its local Commercial Airplanes headquarters building in Renton, it officially listed the Longacres campus for sale Tuesday — a move sure to intensify doubts about the aerospace giant’s long-term corporate presence in Washington state.As Boeing seeks to drastically lower costs during the pandemic-driven aviation downturn, the 215-acre Longacres site joins five other Boeing properties in the Puget Sound region now up for sale — in locations from Frederickson in the south to Everett in the north, including other large office buildings in Renton and Bellevue.The company aims to shed approximately 2.5 million square feet of office space — a 7% reduction in total Boeing office space in the region — plus more than 300 acres of unused land."
"SYDNEY, April 15 (Reuters) - Virgin Australia, the country's No. 2 airline, said on Thursday that 10 leased Boeing Co 737 planes would return to its fleet as part of plans that would see it reach more than 80% of pre-pandemic domestic capacity by mid-June."

Boeing earnings release planned at a dismal time. Any earnings surprise on the downside will crush the stock price!
"Senate Committee report “ Cost-cutting… that jeopardised the safety of the flying public"", a ""culture of concealment"" over issues with the aircraft, ""troubling mismanagement misjudgements"" - just a snapshot of the stinging charges against Boeing.But the US aviation regulator, the FAA, comes off almost as badly. US representatives find it guilty of ""inherent conflicts of interest"" and ""grossly insufficient oversight"".More seriously, they say the regulator was, in effect, in Boeing's pocket and that the FAA's management ""overruled"" its own technical and safety experts ""at the behest of Boeing""."
"The drop yesterday was the best thing that could happen, 270 calls"
"BA is in BIG trouble; and will be for some time! You could likely see it test the 210 regions by the end of May and trend lower into the latter half of the year. Government contracts or not, it will be a steep road to climb to overcome the disasters that have unfolded due to corporate decisions made since the McDonald Douglas merger- we are only now seeing the scars. Their multiple(s) will suffer. Projects have decade-long life cycles; remember that- the outcomes of lousy decision-making aren't often realized right away..."
"Regarding Boeing's defense and space business, deliveries totaled 42 in first-quarter 2021, and it was 39 last year.The improved delivery figure can be attributed to the heightened geopolitical tensions involving North Korea and the Middle East. This, in turn, might have increased shipment activities within the United States as well as across borders. We now await to see the delivery numbers of other jet manufacturers like Lockheed Martin LMT and Embraer ERJ for the first quarter, which may also reflect certain improvements this time around.Think $400."
"I am in BA for the long term and took the dip last year, averaged down and now waiting for the rise above 350."

Expect to see BA over $300 by early May.
"United upgrades 4 more Hawaii routes with Boeing 767 widebodies￼ Zach Griff United Airlines is going all-in on Hawaii this summer.Over the weekend, the Chicago-based carrier made a notable schedule update on four Hawaii routes, increasing capacity and giving business-class passengers a nice surprise as well.￼Specifically, select flights from Denver (DEN) to Honolulu (HNL) and Maui (OGG), as well as the daily DEN to Kona (KOA) and Lihue (LIH) route, got upgauged from a 169-seat Boeing 757-200 to a 214-seat Boeing 767-300ER. The changes start between June 3 to June 5 and run through Oct. 30, per Cirium schedules and confirmed by the carrier.This nearly 30% boost in capacity underscores that United seems to believes that there’s no shortage of demand for Hawaii flights."
Does anyone know why hedge funds are dumping BA today???

"Hi guys .. I bought a load of shares here in March 2020 at $95 . After that, I remember people posting crazy things like Boeing is going to go down to $50 or Boeing won't exist anymore. I'm just happy that things are finally starting to look better. Does anyone think they will ever pay dividends one day?"

"BA will go up naturally, with gas price go high air travel will increase. Rental electric vehicle not started, so more and more people will fly. Also life getting normal, sooner than you think."
Anyone in here in @ $278? LOL  How about $450? Missed earnings by 0.46. I’ve never seen that before in 30 years of trading. Going to single digits by 2022. GUARANTEED

Don't get ahead of yourselves. 24 hours later after a grueling day the futures look lousy again and we could have a repeat of yesterday. I agree that BA will be better investment but I'm comfortable with what I have right now. Covered calls by themselves don't offer 90 percent risk aversion so the more 100 share lots you have the more it costs to add put insurance..
Darell and Greg are actually coco too. Lord Dak just muted them and you should too.
"Breaking “US watchdog to audit FAA recertification of Max 837”. They can’t believe that FAA took 19 months to inspect and scrutinize, and yet electrical issues were not spotted-shame on FAA!!!!"
"For all the thumbs down I got about Boeing management in Seattle. Here is a quote from the largest fastest growing Airlines in Europe ""As the management team in Seattle continues to mismanage that process I think there is a real risk we might not see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021,"" Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary of Ryanair. Does not matter what I think. It does matter what our major buyers think. Seattle workforce choices are also very weak. Need to leave Seattle and redefine management. Great company, great stock.... need great management and workplace environment."

"Reuters May 19, 2021 03:13:00 PM ET WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - United Airlines said Wednesday it had completed repairs on its 17 Boeing 737 MAX planes that were grounded early last month over an electrical problem that could have interfered with some critical systems.Boeing last Wednesday sent affected carriers service bulletins on how to address the production issue after the fixes were approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The action was a relief for American carriers, which have more than 65 of the 109 planes impacted worldwide, and were eager to get planes back into the air before the summer travel season."

Interesting price action. If its any consolation the airlines and DIS are down as well. Gotta think this new wave of Covid variants has spooked the market despite (or maybe because of) the increase in TSA numbers. Also a lot of banks took a huge hit from a hedge fund that made an epic mistake.
Ten years from now there will still be two dominant airframe manufacturers: Airbus and COMAC. Boeing will still be around but in a much diminished role propped up by the government/taxpayers.

"Focusing a bit on the Boeing 737 MAX, what I'm liking here is the involvement from lessors as well as continued orders from airlines.

The Federal Aviation Administration had signed off on the service bulletins, Reuters first reported late on Wednesday."
"The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it is investigating why Boeing missed that a minor production change involving drilled holes wound up the root of potential electrical problems, these people said.The audit is expected to delve into issues beyond those addressed by a typical agency review of such problems. Regulators plan to examine how other minor production changes were handled, people familiar with the matter said.Calhoun blamed FAA for delay.I’ve been around Production Change boards it seems to me this is 100% in the Engineering side of the Boeing House but as I see it Class 2 and Class 1 the last needing higher approvals. Not sure how the FAA was not part of the approval process."

"@Annoymous, Yeah, I agree with your approach of keep taking the discounted shares until $180 after the secondary shares offer!"
Airline stock valuations are now higher than pre pandemic levels. BA has much runway to grow we will see pre pandemic stock price in BA before the end of this year.
Usually these announcements happen on the weekend. This time it happens before the Friday selloff at the close.
"Well the bright side about Boeing’s situation —given the current market environment of rising commodity and production costs— is that at least they have plenty of Already Made, ready to go Airplanes --they will go up in value due to inflation ---: and in terms of delivery, they can just fly them straight to the airport,anywhere in the world"
ROGER WHAT SHOULD WE DO ?
"Magma Aviation is adding an extra Boeing B747 freighter aircraft to its fleet in response to growing demand.The UK-based freighter manager has partnered with Plus Logistics Solutions Limited on the B747-400F, which increases its fleet to five all-cargo aircraft.It is the second freighter that Magma has added to its fleet in the last 12 months – in August last year sister company AviaAM Leasing purchased a B747-400F for the airline to use."
will BA ever recover to 300 ?? in my life time ?
I own 700 shares of BA but I had to mute this Jin goof. This incessant cheerleading has gotten on my nerves. Nobody is listening to him.
What metric has to be reached for Boeing to bring the dividend back?
BIG drop INCOMING...!!!
"Investors waiting on key inflation report. No worries, Boeing will fly high this week."
Buy calls for may 7 267.5
"it will fall even with good earnings, like TSLA MSFT"
"I´m always overwhelmed by joy then BA does bad. In a fair and just world, such a company should not exist . Responsible for the loss of lives for hundreds of people, its greedy executives should do life sentences instead of making decisions. Any ethical investor should put fairness before money and sell their positions, investing in better companies. Any fund lead by real humans, not money sharks, should short BA to hell until it changes the course and reveals the culprits."

"For you, since BA will jump 25 points later this week."

"This BA stock keeps going up, tired of it."
Algo closing out some of short position before next leg down - company has zero positive news - I’m long and now long suffering.
"Transportation Security Administration passenger numbers increase 20-25% over the past 2 weeks. Boeing will react by going up in May, steeply."
Been adding under 230. Like every run we had the shorts are out in droves and that spells buy buy buy and watch them buy back all my shares 290 plus soon as they cover as usual. It’s almost funny . They never learn as they bet pennies but I will take everyone again as usual
Have gotten tired of waiting so reduced from oversized weight to full size weight and put the money in some also good possible rockets after the recent crushing of the market. That paid off Friday. So no doubt it will be up this week. You are all welcome. Still bullish bit see other likely areas to be invested.
"Next week we see the BA's strong Earnings Report, then you will see the beginning of a powerful race to the top."
I believe is going to $200. #$%$
"The entire wiring in the plane will ultimately have some connection to the cockpit, so when they say there is electrical issue in cockpit, it means the entire wiring in Max has to be checked. Its going to be an expensive and time consuming affair."

"Regardless of its hiccups, the 787 is an attractive model for globe-spanning airlines not only because of its range. Lufthansa pointed out in its press release heralding the new buy that the 787-9 can hold up to 20% more passengers and roughly 25% more cargo than the planes it is replacing in the company's big fleet. And importantly for a company trying to go greener, its fuel consumption and emissions are 25% lower than the aircraft it's supplanting."
Definitely going to $194 but will she stop there? Dividendless and listing. She will sail again but not until a dividend is announced in 2028 if all the stars align. The China joe market will have collapsed long before that day comes
"CHICAGO (Reuters) -U.S. budget carrier Frontier Airlines is already making money and flying more than in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic upended air travel last year, Chief Executive Barry Biffle told Reuters ahead of the company's Nasdaq debut on Thursday.The airline started generating positive cash flow at the beginning of March, a key milestone for an industry that has been burning money after drastically scaling back flights last year as demand tanked.Frontier is now benefiting from a recovery driven by domestic leisure travel, its specialty, flying more capacity this March than in the same month of 2019."

Could well be the ladt day we spend down here so buy on any weakness today is my opinion.
"What a change in 12 months. 900,000 more people flying per day.. Now MAX and 787’s flying. Two big orders in the last two months and China is getting close to MAX approval and soon international travel will pick and awaiting Chinese orders. Kind of hard to bet against BA with this background."

If you sold these contracts last week and tried to close them today at the midpoint of the bid and ask the machines adjusted the ASK up about a point above the midpoint within 10 seconds after the trade was entered. We're a week out from earnings and the daily price movements of Boeing are extreme. if you can play these options correctly it can enhance your underlying long position.
Sad how they manipulate this great company and much needed one too.

"The Boeing Company has worked in coordination with the Production and Procurement Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, as well with the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel, to train and develop 60 small and medium-sized (SME) on the path to becoming Boeing suppliers. Since 2018, Boeing has directed at least 35% of the contract value from Israeli government defense procurements to Israel-based companies and suppliers. For instance, Israel Aerospace Industries’ major structures work for Boeing’s F-15 program; avionics and spare parts for the V-22 Osprey, the T-38 Talon and T-45 Goshawk."

"Further, as part of a previously announced agreement with The Boeing Company BA in December 2020 to acquire 68 737-9 MAX aircraft between 2021 to 2024, Alaska Airlines is ordering 13 Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft. Nine aircraft will be delivered in 2023 and four in 2024.Alaska Airlines is not the only U.S. airline increasing its fleet size to prepare for the anticipated recovery in travel demand. In March, Southwest Airlines LUV had reached an agreement with Boeing for an additional 100 737 MAX aircraft, out of which the first 30 are expected to be delivered in 2022. Earlier, United Airlines UAL had placed an order for 25 additional Boeing 737 MAX planes and prescheduled delivery of some other orders in hopes of acceleration in travel-demand recovery."
Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on April 14 that the first of 210 MAX jets on order would be delivered within days but on Wednesday said that a technical team waiting to pick it up in Seattle had encountered unforeseen delays.
BA is my largest holding. Waiting patiently for the orders to start rolling in.

"California’s two Disney theme parks will reopen on April 30, CEO Bob Chapek said on CNBC’s “Squawk Alley” Wednesday.All theme parks in California have been closed due to Covid-related restrictions for the past year. While guidelines in other states, like Florida, allowed parks to reopen with limited capacity, California’s rules have kept theme parks big and small shuttered.However, new state guidance permits amusement parks to reopen beginning April 1 with 15% to 35% capacity depending on the prevalence of the virus in the community. Masks and other health precautions will be required.California is reporting just under 2,900 new Covid-19 cases per day, based on a weekly average, a near 32% decline compared with a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The rate of new Covid cases has been on the decline as more people have been getting vaccinated. With ramp ups in supply and acces, on average about 2.4 million people are getting vaccinated daily in the U.S.Orange County, where Disneyland and California Adventure are located, are seeing four new cases a day per 100,000 residents.

"It's important to remember that tomorrow closes the May options. There are thousands of contracts at play, all ranging between 220 and 230. Quite a few of these contracts were probably sold naked, both calls and puts, and these sellers are going to be engaged in a huge push-pull battle to ensure their contracts expire worthless so they don't have to cover. As I'm typing this, the buying and selling is all ranging around the 225 area. There are thousands of contracts at this strike price. The 220 strike price is probably not in play at this point as it would cost too much to wage that fight. Absent some kind of big news between today and tomorrow that drives the price up, I'm going to guess 230 is out of reach for the put sellers to bid the price up that high as well. As with last Friday, the battle royale is going to be fought between the 225 and the 227.50 contract sellers. You can expect the price for the rest of the day today and throughout the day tomorrow to range between these two levels unless some external news moves the price significantly away from where it is now."

"Seems as though the negative Nancie's on here swarm on bad days without any consideration for a longer term viewpoint. Post pandemic air travel necessitates a long term view, as it relies more heavily on macro themes. The ""quick turn"" stocks benefiting from consumer spending have already priced in a recovery, Boeing has yet to price this in, due primarily to maco impacts, and some short term execution issues. However, a bet against Boeing is a bet against vaccine efficacy, the U.S. economy, and a return to normal. Not a position I tend to favor, and history shows my stance to be a winner. The negative Nancies may win this short term battle, but the war will be won by the longer term holders."

We upgrade the stock to Buy from Neutral.”"
John the short will lose big money
"NYSE:BA has seen some dark times over the past few years, but the stock has hit full speed since the turn of the calendar to 2021. Year to date Boeing is up over 30%, and has been one of the strongest global reopening stocks to buy into. On Wednesday, as the markets pulled a slingshot and bounced back for the afternoon, Boeing added 3.28% to close the trading session at $263.59. Shares are now trading comfortably above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and are within reach of the 52-week high price of $278.57 set earlier this month.Much of the optimism surrounding Boeing has to do with several airline companies ordering new planes to boost their fleets in anticipation of both domestic and global travel reopening. In February, for the first time since late 2019, Boeing recorded more aircraft sales than cancellations, as it delivered 82 planes compared to 51 cancellations. This includes 25 Boeing 737 Max sales to United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and 19 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners to Singapore Airlines. Boeing’s total order backlog now sits at 4,041 aircrafts."

"Here we go again manipulation on wall street. News media plays into their agenda sending fear from the analysts they interview......inflation, inflation, inflation. Imo this bs game is getting old.

It's time for investors to fight back and buy the companies that are at bargain prices like Boeing. Send wall street a message we're done being manipulated. Buy!!!!"

"S. officials have asked Boeing Co. BA, -1.08% to supply additional information showing that several 737 Max subsystems would not be affected by electrical-grounding problems revealed in April,Reuters reported Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter. Boeing flagged a new problem with 737 Max jets in early April, with Wall Street believing that a fix would be easy and cause only ""minimal disruption"" for Boeing customers. The electrical problems have grounded about a quarter of the 737 Max fleet, while U.S. airlines are standing by for guidance on how to fix it. Through a spokesperson, Boeing told Reuters it continues ""to work closely with the FAA and our customers to address the ground path issue in affected 737s."" Shares of Boeing fell 1.5"

"When the first Max jets eventually arrive, Ryanair’s chief financial officer Neil Sorahan says that the initial examples will be put into “key maintenance bases for the likes of Buzz, Malta Air and Ryanair across Europe”.Thereafter, “the airlines are competing with each other” for the new aircraft, which Ryanair describes as “game-changers” for its cost base, thanks to the variant having four more seats and lower fuel burn than older-generation 737 aircraft.The group’s carriers “are all very keen to get their hands on these new, efficient aircraft”, Sorahan says.In late March, O’Leary noted that even though Ryanair’s existing fleet size of around 450 jets was more than sufficient for Covid-hit traffic levels in 2021, the operator was still “anxious to get these aircraft delivered so that we can start training our pilots and our cabin crew can get familiar with them, and our customers can enjoy flying in them”.Ryanair has orders in place for 210 737-8200 Max jets, having firmed up 75 more units in early December 2020."

Boeing lost it's way a long time ago. Over the years they have outsourced production of critical parts while lowering quality standards. They spent more on stock buybacks than in R&D for decades. Because management didn't like working closely with their engineers (they made their head hurt) they moved headquarters to Chitcago to get away from their engineers. Meanwhile they indulged themselves with outsized pay packages and bonuses. Knowing the problems of the 737 MAX Boeing actually had the temerity to charge airlines an extra fee for the work around to their own design flaw. In the wake of the 737 Max crashes management repeatedly lied and covered up their culpability in the design flaws of the 737 Max. And after all this; all they did was fire the sitting CEO. Nothing else has changed. Unfortunately given management's intransience after this Epic disaster there will likely be more tragedies in store for this company---until shareholders fire the top execs and BOD.
"Be careful, Tesla earnings, which are not expected to be great, may trigger the correction taking BA and all other with it!!!"
"It's not really ridiculous price action, it's fairly predictable. BA is going to remain under selling pressure as long as this Max electrical issue drags on. That's really the fundamental short-term thing right now that has the market more and more spooked. When the issue was first announced, it came with all kinds of reassurances from analysts and airlines that this was expected to be a short-term nothing-burger. A month has gone by without an approved fix. There will be a fix, no doubt of that, but every day this drags on gets the market more and more concerned about how much longer it will go on. Boeing can't deliver any Max aircraft until the fix is in, and that means that spigot of revenue has been shut off for a whole month now. That doesn't spell pretty things for April reporting, so what you're seeing now is the market pricing in very low delivery numbers. And now we're a week into May without a fix, so the market is pressuring BA stock into ranges that would reflect a significant hit to May deliveries as well. Once the service bulletins are out and BA can resume Max deliveries, the stock price will turn around, but until then, you're not going to see any kind of significant improvement in price. Ultimately, the situation has created a nice buying opportunity, but if you buy now, don't be surprised if the price continues to drift downward until the electrical fix is approved by the FAA."

The FAA will review Boeing’s analysis and any necessary revisions to the service bulletins before they can be sent to airlines.Boeing has proposed adding a bonding strap or cable that workers screw onto two different surfaces creating a grounding path, two people said. Boeing had initially told airlines a fix could take hours or a few days per jet."

One positive with today's action is the volume wasn't high. No panic selling.
Breaking “Cramer gone mad at Boeing management; says shareholders will suffer this quarter because Boeing management doesn’t know how to execute; they made a mess of electrical issues”
JB wore a mask in a zoom call. The only one in the panel. And you listen to this gut
United Airlines tells staff it’s hiring hundreds of pilots next month as carrier plans for a travel recovery
Can't pay you any dividends but Calhoun gets 21 million.
Can we see 320 soon?
"Did anyone notice that Cramer has suddenly gone quite on Boeing; In fact, he has shown his disappointment with the ongoing QC problems and management!"
Looking even better Cramer's negative on BA. You know what that means.He was just having to say oh but my charitable trust owns it. Lol
which commercial plane does Boeing make that doesn't have any problems? its like every month there is something new showing how many corners this company takes.
It’s so beyond fun to short stocks 1000x better than being and if you buy weekly puts you can make 500% a week every week
The deal comes after a multi-year fleet evaluation by Southwest and means that Boeing and its suppliers could build more than 600 new 737 Max jets for the airline through to 2031.
She goes green later or gets close.. Let Calhoun speak. 10:30.
Looking very healthy
will buy even more next support level $202. Hopefully upside next week.
UAL got hammered yesterday. That tells me that even with a passenger volume 'recovery' it's going to be a challenge to turn that into profitability. There are still a lot of marketplace structural issues left. One thing I've noticed is ticket prices are going up. That may hurt the recovery because airplanes need to be packed to be profitable.
Jin and associates worried over the long weekend;

They had some interesting insights about BA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Thank you may I have another... 
"Holy moly-this is landing at $220:""But the fundamental issues at Boeing remain an ongoing concern, and even as the company fixes aircraft problems as they come up, many are wondering just how deep these problems go, and whether we’ve now seen the end of them. This latest 737 MAX issue only feeds those concerns."""

Turkey’s national flag carrier Turkish Airlines (THY) Thursday put one of its Boeing 737 Max planes back into service for the first time since it was grounded around the world following two deadly crashes.Turkish Airlines flight TK2138 took off from Istanbul Airport at around 10:10 a.m. with 96 passengers onboard and landed at Esenboğa Airport in the capital Ankara just before 11:00 a.m.
"Southwest Airlines expects aircraft capex of $5.1B through 2026 associated with its 169 Boeing 737 MAX orders. Even factoring in compensation and deposits, that works out at little over $30M per aircraft, providing insight into the level of discounts that big customers are securing for the MAX, with its list price of over $100M. Southwest removed 32 MAX jets from service because of the recently-surfaced electrical issue, and like other operators says it's still waiting for guidance from Boeing and the FAA on corrective guidance."
Any ideas why $SPR starts off strong and ends up down while $BA and the rest of the market reaches new heights?

The low-cost carrier has ordered 251 Max jets as it pursues an aggressive regional expansion.

People's expectations are still too high. BA still has a lot of work in front of them to position themselves well for a true recovery. The company is still too big and despite of what the cheerleaders say the workload is stagnated at best and shrinking at worse. With all the engineering issues at hand the company has to perform non-value checks and inspections just because they've lost the trust of the regulators. All that is going to add costs and hurt profits (if and when that happens).
"It is difficult to predict precisely the future of this rivalry amid all these uncertainties. But keeping in consideration the recent order growth for Boeing’s 737 Max, Airbus will have a difficult time in regaining its number one position in 2021."

The news for BA only continues to get better. More and more Max orders are being placed. As the economy reopens the demand for long haul jets like the 787 and 777 will return....BA will return to profitability and being cash flow positive over time and the share price will go dramatically higher from the current levels.

"“ Boeing's biggest order is less impressive than it looksThe 100-unit order from Southwest Airlines was the difference-maker that allowed Boeing to expand its backlog (albeit just slightly) in March.Yet while this deal padded Boeing's order total, it won't do much for Boeing's finances -- especially in the near term. First, Boeing is selling 737 MAX 7s to Southwest at razor-thin margins. Southwest expects to spend just $5.1 billion to acquire 169 aircraft from Boeing between 2021 and 2026, an average of $30 million per plane. That appears to be near -- or even below -- breakeven.Second, Southwest Airlines has stretched out its 737 MAX order book quite dramatically. Entering 2020, it had 265 firm orders scheduled for delivery between 2020 and 2025. Now, it has just 155 firm orders over that period (including seven 737 MAX 8s delivered last December).”"

"“ Moreover, it's not clear where Boeing could turn for additional 737 MAX orders. It has already tapped most of its biggest, most loyal, and most financially stable customers for 737 MAX orders over the past few months. That could cause the backlog to start shrinking again if weaker customers continue canceling orders.In short, Boeing's commercial jet business is likely to be significantly smaller and less profitable going forward than it was a few years ago. Given that commercial jets were Boeing's biggest cash cow prior to the 737 MAX grounding, this subpar outlook makes Boeing an unattractive stock.”"

Boeing to Release First-Quarter Results on April 28

ZacksSolid Delivery Numbers to Boost Boeing's (BA) Q1 Earnings
"TSA Numbers. From March 16, 2020....it took until October 2020 to have over 1 million people fly in a day in the US. January 2021 had 3 days of 1+ million, Feb 2021 had 7 days of 1+ million....then in March 2021 it popped to 26 days of 1+ million! February 2021 so far, every single day is 1+ million. Domestic travel is returning. Business travel within the US will rebound, however, I feel international travel will take longer as there remains a lot of uncertainty about how other countries will handle covid/lockdowns/etc. Airlines will need the most fuel efficient fleet available. Considering the 737 MAX is 15% more fuel efficient than previous models....it will play an integral role in airline margins going forward."
"Dear Mr. Jim Cramer: Would you please stop telling your viewers to buy Boeing? We get it, you own it in one of your accounts, and you're a cheerleader for the markets because of ad revenue where you work. But your incessant calls are causing people to lose money."
"Boeing is presently working on a trainer aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. It’s called T-7A Red Hawk, an evolution of the Boeing T-X concept developed by Boeing together with Swedish company Saab.And by developed, we don’t only mean designed. The aircraft, expected to enter service shortly, was not only penned by the two companies but it is also being put together in different parts of the world.Using model-based engineering and 3D design, the two companies were capable of constructing two parts of the airplane with perfect precision. That allows Boeing engineers in U.S. to quickly mate the aft section of the Red Hawk, made 4,500 miles (7,200 kilometers) away in Sweden, with the front fuselage, in just 30 minutes."

Quarterly results are right around the corner and the shareholder meeting will prove interesting on how many of the current board will be shown the door.

"$BA On the recent bottom (Jan. 27), RSI (14) was 33.61. RSI (14) right now is 37. It is in the oversold territory. It could go down more for a next couple of trading days. But, the reversal soon will follow with some positive news. - Global covid cases are going down including India.- Airlines CEOs pressure lifting travel restrictions between US and UK.- Summer travel pent-up demand.- FAA will soon lift the MAX grounding --> delivery will be resumed.The difficult time soon shall pass. #duopoly, #diamondhands"
If BA is already hurting what's going to happen at the close? Investors are bailing out because the risk is way too great that these issues will mushroom into larger and larger problems. BA is under the microscope and the reality is these problems have been these all along. Remember the Johnson and Johnson vaccine got canned because of 6 blood clots in 6 million doses. The public has zero tolerance for risk these days and BA has an impossible job of meeting that.

Something I see ignored in most articles about Boeing is the company's inherent ties to the Federal reserve / US Treasury.

The response to FAA approval was lackluster to say the least. The street will see this a general weakness & a lack of interest and will unceremoniously dump the stock. Get ready to be under 200 in a week or two.

Those aircraft are reaching end-of-life and will retire in 2024.The State Department has studied and approved the military sale of the made-in-Seattle military airplanes, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said Friday, adding it has notified Congress of the possible sale because it's a major arms sale.

i remember last year a middle east prince put in $700m or so to buy BA at $150. lots of people were laughing at it. I guess he now is close to 100% gain. There is no easier way to people to put $$$ without being worried about losing. I think it could swing down to $250 at most today. it will be back to $300 before summer time.

"BA, 18% growth since January 1st."
"Boeing Co. said Tuesday it delivered 77 commercial airplanes in the first quarter, which is 54% more than the number delivered in the first quarter of 2020. Most of those delivered in the first quarter, or 63 jets, were of the narrow-bodied 737. The aerospace and defense company last week flagged a new problem with 737 Max jets, notifying some airline customers of a potential issue with a component of the electrical power system."
love to see the pumpers trying to help this train wreck....LOL!!
"We are ready to fly, are you?"
"BA is just a reflection of an overall market correction, nothing more. When the markets go back up so will BA. If there is good news on covid, travel, china, etc. it will go up more than the market. IF you overlay, the markets with BA, the curves are identical just different in vertical exaggeration. Just make sure you do not need the money that you invest into BA. There are too many unknowns with BA with the exception that the world needs jets and they will need a lot more in the future and China will want lots of jets in the future. Airbus will have crashes as well, unfortunately, planes are complicated and things happen. Furthermore, Airbus can't supply China with all the jets that they will need. them all. Hey, it is still a duopoly. If it takes until 2023 to 2025, just sit tight and you will be rewarded."

Not worth the risk in this messed up market, with China Joe about to raise taxes And the Fed going to raise interest."
"So we have 1 person posting under multiple names. I can tell Coco, Johnn, and Brian are the same guy."
How much more beating can bulls get? Why the heck Boeing is not providing any update on electrical issues that was initially thought as Nothing Burger quick fix and that resulted in the disappearance of Jin!!!

Lam what did I due when we dropped 7 ? What a steal thanks shorts . Is it tomorrow or in a week or two till we move like a freight trade again
Boeing is turning the corner. Nobody said it would happen overnight. You will get a bounce when Calhoun explains the progress being made.
You have to hand it to the administration to start a trial balloon to see how the market would react to higher capital gains taxes on wealthy Americans. So they shot first before they asked questions and true to form they got an immediate answer. Now that the session is over they realize that it will be quite difficult to get anything through a dysfunctional Senate and common sense is returning. Not that it did any of us any good today considering the stock actually rebounded above 239 before Bloomberg reported the news and the index selling set in.....You have to agree this is lunacy already.

Thank you shorts!
Important  question: What falls faster? A Boeing plane out of the sky in Bali OR Boeing stonk???
so Yahoo does not allow free speech.
Unfortunately there are a lot of stocks that have special circumstances like Boeing that make it difficult to put a toe in the water. I really believe that this company will eventually get its act together and prevail. Would you have thought of Catipillar that way several years ago when it was in the 60s.....or Home Depot when it was way under 100. They all had issues...There is nothing that Boeing can't fix including a tainted reputation....
Frank the bank made the call...... just remember that !
BA is the king now!
"Obviously if it trades with airlines tomorrow, It will be down again. Thank UAL for tomorrow’s price action."
Hi shorts just checking on you. Monthly health check.
Today's rally didn't feel good in spite of some very good news on jet orders and leasing. Option prices particularly long dated were jumping around like jumping beans as investors were trying to figure out where the stock price was going to be tomorrow let alone next week. We almost got above 255 but then we sank back below 249 just as fast. With news like we got the stock should not even have looked back today. I'm happy for any consistent gains we achieve but it feels suspect right now.
And this is where Boeing begins takeoff for good. Too much value in this stock to just sit there.
"Best stock to short in the market award goes to ""BA""! Worst management award to BA management!"
This quarter will be a LOSS too.. No deliverys for the entire month = another quarterly Loss to report in July...LOL thats gonna be 7 in a row
So why the crash - a CFO leaving gets around before official announcement so we see steady decline then crash when made public. All done now ...

Their backlog has shrunk and is 2000 aircraft less than Airbus. They have high debt. Their leadership is terrible. They enabled the previous CEO and now Calhoun takes his spot. Talk about the fox guarding the chicken coup. Every board member should have been fired with Muhlenberg (sp).

"BLOOMBERG — Boeing Co. is poised to resume delivering its 787 Dreamliners this week, ending a five-month halt while the planemaker’s mechanics searched for tiny structural flaws in the carbon-fiber aircraft, said people familiar with the matter.The initial delivery is expected as soon as Friday, with Boeing likely to hand over two or three of the wide-body jets this month, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is confidential.Shares of the aircraft manufacturer reversed early declines and rose as much as 1.7% on the news. The stock traded up 1.5% to $242.83 as of 11:52 a.m. in New York.$GE $BA"

"Update: CNN describe latest issue as a potential catastrophe “ CNN safety analyst David Soucie said he believes the issue specifically involves a backup to the main power system that powers all of the aircraft's electrical parts. The system is roughly analogous to the circuit breaker panel in a house.The fact that the planes were grounded indicates that this is potentially a ""catastrophic"" problem that could have caused a fire, Soucie said. But he noted it's a good sign for the plane — and its safety — that the potential threat was discovered before there was an incident.”"

Oversold. So undervalued in my opinion; only 141 billion market cap... starting to look like a good time to buy the dip....

Boeing, for the first time in more than two years, has toppled its archrival, Airbus SE EADSY, courtesy of higher net quarterly orders. This is the first occasion on which Boeing has overtaken Airbus with respect to quarterly orders since the 737 Max was grounded in March 2019, which made Airbus the world’s top plane maker in early 2020.

Buy as much of it as you can even from here. Long term( 18-24 months at least) you will look back and thank yourself. I think it could be back to 400 by end of 2023 maybe even higher.

"Has anyone noticed that analysts lowered their profit expectations to negative number for 2021 from $1.09. And, if you look at their projected earnings for 2022 it is only 2.2% of the current $248 price. Why would anyone buy a stock hoping to make only 2.2% nearly two years from now? It does not make any sense. The stock is way ahead of its projected earnings. It used to be a great company that paid a dividend, but it has several hurdles to overcome before it is worth $248. Airlines are sitting on inventories of unused planes they need to get flying first. Then, they have to clean up their own balances sheets before purchasing new aircraft. That will take a couple of years. I might pay $181 for it hoping it can return a decent profit and maybe start paying a dividend in 2023. It's just not worth $248 right now."

Not even gonna get 224.00 today!!..LOL!..$hort as much as you can for the ride down to 200.00 this quarter!!
After working for Boeing for 34 years my guess on this issue would be that a ground wire for this particular control box was not attached properly on the production line so Boeing did what it should do and notify the different airlines to check it out on their planes. Like Phil Lebow said its a matter of a couple of hours to fix the issue. They might pull the box and check to see if its working properly and then re-install it and ground it per speck.
It's funny people not buying BA. there's literally no bad news holding it down. yeah lets buy 1200X tsla instead. this is probably the easiest 20% in the market if you hold . MINIMUM. It'll stay around 320 for Q3/4
Have plenty of Hedges in place as insurance against Old Joe's Tax Increases .....this bull market bubble is gonna pop soonhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4419898-is-no-way-this-bull-market-doesnt-end-badly
"Dow down, BA up."
"Buoyed by a resurgence in domestic business, Virgin Australia is looking to increase its fleet size by about 15%. Last year, amid the airline’s collapse and wider travel downturn, Virgin Australia downsized its fleet. Now, confident the worst is behind it, Virgin Australia is keen to reverse that trend and start expanding.￼Virgin Australia eyes eight or nine new planesA report by Patrick Hatch in The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday says Virgin Australia is negotiating with lessors to take eight or nine aircraft. After culling the fleet last year, Virgin Australia ended up with 59 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. According to Planespotters.net, all but six of those planes are in the air."
Hedges didn't expect this strong a DOW on Vacation week!!!....will need to sell lots of shares
This will bounce back to $225 in a few days and then back to the $240 range. Too many big funds own this stock.
hahahahahaha great drop to buy buy buy
"Here is what Cramer is saying “ This pandemic has wrecked the aerospace industry, and the 737 Max debacle sure doesn’t help,” Cramer said. “Boeing ... desperately need[s] this virus to be contained. Remdesivir makes that a real possibility cause it starts the process of removing the huge and justifiable fear factor ... If Boeing does a secondary [offering] here, buy.”"
One has to wonder why Calhoun supports this liberal agenda in the US!
That is hundreds of Max orders over next 12 months if you add all the other orders they jist landed. Selling at anything less than $300 makes 0 sense

See all you short creeps over $300.
The sky is not falling Small issue with planes will be inspected and fixed if needed Add to your position
Remember this is going back over 300. Buying this last year was a gift. Holding long
Just buy before earnings and guidance while you can down here.
The funny thing is BA will be $300 in 2-3 week.
So I'm watching the action with MACD very closely. The last time we had a sustained move down it took MACD to cross its trend line up to signal that a sustained move up was in the offing. There were also similarities with point and figure with a double bottom being seriously violated and this time a triple bottom although the move down from the break has been fairly shallow. A move above 244 would make the new uptrend durable. It's a waiting game now....
$325 is comming

This thing tanks to 200 if Calhoun so much as gives a whiff of an equity offering to raise capital.
"f anyone thinks Boeing is going to be $240 in a year you should not be investing. Forget $300, forget $400, think $500!"

"There's no question that this week will be pretty ugly for the market at this point. The real turnaround for recovery stocks will begin with Memorial Day and the beginning of the summer travel season. If the FAA approves the Max service bulletins between now and then, you can expect a moderate price increase, or perhaps even just a sideways holding pattern while the rest of the market declines. If the FAA continues to withhold approval for the electrical issue fix, you can expect BA to continue to fall into the low 220s to mid 210s over the next couple weeks."

It reportedly flagged an electrical insulation problem in a back-up power control unit.The issue has so far impacted dozens of planes, with American Airlines Group (AAL) taking 17 of its 41 737 MAX aircraft out of service while United Airlines Holdings (UAL) pulling 16 of its 30 737 MAX planes.Similar issues have now been found in other parts of the model, Reuters reported."

I would be buying and taking advantage of the hugh selling that is going on in the Nasdaq that is pressuring the broad market. Fair value for Boeing is 240. The stock is also incredibly oversold technically.

"But in recent weeks, American saw demand climb with spring break, Easter and Passover travel. It saw vacationers book flights for the summer. And it saw a need for those idle planes.Each day an airplane is parked, American loses about $50,000 in potential revenue, Steele said. That figure does not include the labor hours for the maintenance work.So American began the meticulous process of putting the aircraft back into service, and it plans to have its entire remaining fleet back in the air by the end of this month."

Target for BA end of Apr $275No body said it would be a straight line up.
if you want a reason for yesterday's drop the Wall Street Journal ran an article about the FAA inspecting dreamliners that Boeing needs to deliver because it could use the cashflow now. Usually the FAA gave Boeing the ability to do the inspections but in light of all the recent issues with Boeings missteps the FAA rescinded that ability. Frankly I don't blame them as I don't want the fox in with the chickens....We've had to many issues with planes lately...

"Boeing, $350 would be undervalued today."
Go BA
"AIRBUS registered a total of 125 aircraft deliveries in Q1, BOEING reported 77 commercial aircraft deliveries in Q1."
"On Saturday it was reported that an electrical fault that grounded dozens of Boeing 737 MAX jets last week has caused fresh concern after engineers found similar issues elsewhere in the cockpit.Just days ago the aviation company told 16 of its operators that its most-sold model should not be flown until the “production issue” is addressed.It said at the time that it was working alongside the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on the issue, which does not affect its entire fleet.Boeing said it was not related to the flight-control system that suspended its planes previously.However, suspected grounding problems have since been found in two other places on the flight deck, Reuters reported citing sources close to the matter.Good grief. Another grounding is possible. Rather odd as stated not part of the fleet. A new change order or a new mechanic and QA. Wire bundles are tested long before they get to the airplane. I remember working Tridents at Bremerton Shipyard at completion somebody cut the wire running the length 960’ of the ship. Soon after Navy Seals were stationed throughout the ship."
What happens when you have 70 Billion worth of planes in inventory and sales start to pick back up? Especially when most of the plane price is paid upon delivery....a windfall of cash is starting to flow into Boeing and will continue. Earnings will show solid free cash flow
Jin...We dumped Boeing and went with AT&T and ExxonMobil..It was a great call.
"Face it, BA has more growth potential than any Wall St. stock today. You are golden!"
up 5.00 on the morning pop short...LOL!
Restrictions are still in place and they need to be lifted. The pent-up travel surge needs to be spread through a broader range. Too many people are going to book tickets this summer and find they can't get a seat.
"Seriously, Dow up almost 350 points; and Boeing??????"

"IMHO - CFO was fired. You could see the split between him and the CEO when Greg Smith announced at a meeting with Analysts that Boeing would sell stock to help with debt. Then in a week or 2, the CEO said Boeing would not sell stock. Who knows how big the divide was, but it seemed clear the CEO and CFO were not on the same sheet of music."
"I know there is lot of negativity around but I noticed with Boeing that it trade sideways for few months and then all of sudden $100 up. Buy and hold. There are many catalyst coming soon New orders ,Chinese approval , vaccination, ,opening up of summer travel , electric issue fix."
This will skyrocket once Airlines recover. Just a matter of time....................

Im not excited about todays move. We were down Friday on a big day green day. and today barely any returns on the down day and another big day. we should be sitting about 265 according to DOW index.
Tech is selling off.
"Reporting in Wall Street Journal for March 18 print edition and on website now states that FAA has taken over the final airworthiness inspection duties for four 787 aircraft prior to delivery.""The Federal Aviation Administration said its inspectors, rather than the plane makers, would perform routine pre-delivery safety checks of four Dreamliners that Boeing has been unable for months to hand over to its airline customers while it grapples with various quality lapses.""Article also states that WSJ had reviewed an FAA summary dated March 12 of its regulatory actions. And that ""the agency said it would hold on to its Dreamliner approval authority 'until it is confirmed all shimming issues are resolved and airplanes conform to the FAA-approved design.'"

"Sad, the former president apparently doesn't have anything better to do than complain about the name of the Oscars."
"Fri., April 9, 2021, 12:24 p.m.Airlines pulled dozens of Boeing Max 737s out of service for inspections after the aircraft maker told them about a possible electrical problem, the latest setback for plane.Boeing said Friday that the issue affected planes used by 16 airlines, and that it recommended inspections before the planes fly again.The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people. Regulators in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Brazil cleared the plane to resume flying in recent months after Boeing changed an automated flight-control system that played a role in the crashes.Boeing said Friday that the electrical issue was unrelated to the flight-control system. It did not say how many planes are affected or how long it will take for inspections and, if necessary, repairs.Southwest Airlines, which began flying the Max again last month, said it removed 30 of its 58 Max jets from its schedule to inspect them. Southwest spokesman Brian Parrish said the airline has not experienced any known problems related to the electrical issue.Southwest has a fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s, most of them older models than the Max. Parish said the airline will use other planes to operate flights that had been scheduled with Max jet, and it anticipates only minimal disruption to its operation.American Airlines temporarily removed 17 of its 41 Max planes from service, according to a memo to employees. Boeing traced the issue to a production change made after the worldwide fleet of Max jets was grounded in 2019, American's chief operating officer, David Seymour, said in the memo.“We will never knowingly operate an aircraft with a known or potential issue,” Seymour said.American was the first U.S. airline to resume flying the Max, in late December.United Airlines said it temporarily grounded 16 of its 30 Max planes and will try to operate all flights with its other planes. The airline said it was in contact with Boeing and federal regulators to determine what steps are needed before the planes can return to service.Alaska Airlines said it removed all four of its Max jets from service “to allow for inspections and for work to be done.”Boeing said that it is working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration on the matter.Since the Max crashes, Boeing has made internal changes in response to accusations that it short-changed safety in pursuit of profits. Lawyers suing Boeing over the crashes seized on the latest problem with the planes.“This grounding calls into question the safety of the Max and why Boeing’s claims of a ‘changed culture’ continue to ring hollow,"" said Steven Marks, one of the lawyers representing relatives of passengers who were on board an Ethiopian Airlines Max that crashed in March 2019. “We don’t know what other issues exist.”"

Don’t sell. It is a manipulation. EPS is past events. As the economy bounces and people start to travel this will go to 350s by June/July.

Business travels are also getting back. Get a diamond hands and you will be rewarded long term!

So how many of you saw the story in today's Wall Street Journal about Boeing being ejected from a contest to provide the US with a new anti missile defense. That may explain the crazy selling that happened on Thursday before people came to their senses.

Things got roughed up yesterday. It was an excellant opportunity to start to position for the next significant move up whenever the spirits move. The problem is that you don't get any warning when a 5 point move up turns into a gangbuster momentum driven rally that takes you up 40 points like history has shown in the last two significant rallies. Then you spend the next couple months trying to defend the bottomline as some news comes along that takes the air out of the tires. You get to hate puts because you have to use them if being down several thousand dollars a day bothers you. They're also expensive so you have to hedge them against the possibility of a total loss.
9 weeks down in a row!!...LOL!
headlines asusal all over the place. One says loss is smaller than expected while another syas larger. Fact is they were right where most thought they would be but the real news lies ahead as travel rebounds and fleets must be updated for fuel savings as well as safety. Bottom line...................... buy the BS dip.
What happened to the 'expert' who knew how to read the chart?
"OMG, US watchdog and FAA started new investigation: ""The FAA said it is also investigating the origin of the electrical manufacturing issue disclosed on April 7 that led to the grounding of 109 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft worldwide.

Criminally run hedge funds will continue this negative travel narrative as long as they can get away with it and steal every share they can in the process until investors stop them by buying up the shares.

Baird analyst Peter Arment said in note that the problem was “a small batch” of aircraft that “may not have proper fastening on a back-up power system within the flight deck” and appeared to be easy to fix.

Airlines won't be buying many new planes with 35% of their planes parked and the other 65% flying at half capacity. It'll be 2022 before they need more planes than they already have. BA can't make money just replacing a few old planes when airlines are teetering on bankruptcy.
Never seen so many shorts (I mean 1 with 26accounts) get this giddy over 2%. HAHAHA!!!!
All weekend I will be smiling just knowing in a hour ba could shoot 10-15 easy as it’s done time after time the last yr. hearing some plane orders will go ahead soon.

"Making a change on a production airplane takes time and involves a lot of different processes . Before you do anything you have to change the drawing which is a big process in itself. It has to go through planning, engineering and the FAA. That takes a lot of time. After everybody signs off on it then the workers can fix the problem. Fixing the plane is the easy part."
"Reuters May 19, 2021 12:43:00 PM ET SEATTLE, May 19 (Reuters) - Boeing Co resumed deliveries of its best-selling 737 MAX on Wednesday, following approval of a fix for an electrical grounding issue that sidelined dozens of jets, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters."
"Look, BA is not a rocket ship type stock. Anyone saying it will make you a millionaire is a hipster, just as most overly bearish Comments are shorts. But this is a solid pick and can be part of any moderate risk portfolio. My goals for this is only a double over the next year or two. Even that is pretty optimistic but most youngsters want far more. Good stock to ride back to the 400s and higher, but no way is it a multi-bagger over the next couple years. Have reasonable expectations and you will do well here. Mute the shorts and hypesters and you can get some solid insight here."
Jim Cramer says the $30 billion aircraft leasing deal between GE and AerCap could signal a 'roaring boom' in international travel and spark a run in Boeing shares.

"What a beautiful setup we have in Boeing (NYSE:BA). I love when a stock rips higher to upside, giving us a weekly-up and/or monthly-up rotation, just as Boeing did last week.Shares went on to scream higher, topping out near $278.57 before resetting. These resets are where bulls can look for more continuation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis nice little bull flag consolidation just tagged the 10-day moving average before bouncing on Friday. Aggressive buyers would have bought on today’s dip. More conservative traders will wait for a rotation over Friday’s high.Either way, a close below the 10-day moving average and the 61.8% retracement likely saps more momentum from the stock in the short term. If we get a rotation over Friday’s high though, this stock could be heading back to $275-plus."
They sure keep it at its low for a period of time for shorts to cover. When longs have a fun it is hard to sell at the high as it drops dooo fast.
"Boeing Could Benefit From Iran Air’s Order As US & Iran Set For TalksbyJay SinghApril 4, 2021"
"United Airlines and two other major US carriers said on Friday they will quickly repair more than 60 Boeing 737 MAX planes grounded early last month over an electrical problem that could have interfered with critical systems. Boeing Co sent all affected carriers service bulletins late on Wednesday on how to address the production issue, which had affected 109 planes worldwide. The Federal Aviation Administration had signed off on the service bulletins, Reuters first reported late on Wednesday. The action was a relief for American carriers, which had anxiously awaited the green light to get the planes back into the air before the traditional late May start to the summer travel season. US demand for air travel has risen as the COVID-19 pandemic has waned in the United States.United spokeswoman Leslie Scott said the airline expects its “Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to return to service in the coming days as we complete our inspection process and ensure those aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards.”American Airlines said it would begin making required changes and anticipates “all affected aircraft will begin safely returning to service in the upcoming days.” Southwest Airlines, which has 32 affected planes, said it estimates the work will take two to three days per aircraft. The airline said it hoped to begin work within the next several days, and estimates it will take about three weeks to complete the work."
Well the stock price has crossed its 200 day moving average so the algorithms will be triggered to buy this stock. The trend is up. Long and strong.

What is up with this share price? Boeing's management needs to step up and put out news reiterating all the positives with their company. The stock can't seem to fly even with analysts and Jim Cramer stating its time to buy buy buy.
"While these electrical problems should be relatively easy to fix this is an indication of sloppy manufacturing, testing of new materials, and engineering. Un-grounded electrical panels are a significant safety hazard that could result in arcing, electrical failures, and fires. Checking for grounding is a trivial process and I find it incomphehensible that this was skipped during fabrication."

"""Recent grounding of MAX 737 is weighing on the stock as company has not provided any update the electrical problem that was initially tagged as a quick fix, but now seems a major issue"""
%$#@ all Shorts and Demoncrats
"Given a multi-year order backlog, Airbus has said it’s more focused on delivering the planes it makes to customers during the crisis than securing new commitments. Nevertheless, this year the company has fallen behind U.S. rival Boeing Co. in order flow.That trend likely continued in March, with Boeing securing a bumper commitment for its 737 Max from Southwest Airlines Co. The U.S. airline had publicly flirted with the Airbus A220, a smaller single-aisle jet."

"Boeing is donating 10 million dollars of relief to India for Covid-19 relief. Although the thought is noble and generous and we all agree that India DEFINITELY needs some much needed help..... I must say....not for nothing; I am sitting on substantial financial losses due to Boeing Stock I own being down as well as financial losses from dividend payments from Boeing I no longer receive. Charity is great, but charity begins with the shareholders who trusted your company and now have massive financial losses due to the 737 plane problems. If Boeing is financially able to donate funds for relief efforts around the world perhaps it should consider re-implementing its dividend payment for elderly folks who survive off their dividends!!"
China is one of the last major markets to hold out on clearing the 737 MAX and an increasing headache for Boeing which relies on China for about a quarter of sales.

The MAX is very efficient and as I said before the pilots and crew like it very much.Air travel being booked in advance has caused prices to increase. Business air travel will be resuming and personal travel has already increased substantially. This is good for Boeing sales and expect revenue and operating cash to increase significantly. Employees are also expecting to go to conventions, sales trips and off sites as this pandemic ends and business will have to understand their employees requests if they want talent to stay with them. Leisure travel is rising and will only increase from now. This is all good for this company."

BA longs are going to make lots of money this year. I predict $450-$500 by end of year.
"ST. LOUIS — Boeing was awarded a $2.5 million contract by the U.S. Marine Corps to sustain the service’s Compact Laser Weapon System (CLWS) units, the company said in a March 29 release. The five-year contract includes maintenance services for the Boeing-built CLWS units defending against hostile unmanned aerial systems in theater. Each CLWS unit is equipped with a best-in-class beam director and acquisition, tracking and pointing software to deliver precision protection. “We’re honored to continue our partnership with the Marine Corps,” said Kurt Sorenson, Boeing program manager for CLWS. “This will ensure that their systems continue to operate at the highest levels in defense of our warfighters.” Boeing recently increased the maximum beam power and reliability of the CLWS units – providing enhanced protection against larger and more numerous threats at greater range, as well as enabling them to defeat threats more quickly and efficiently."
OUCH !
"My suggestion for people that own Boeing stock to just forget about it until after their next earning report This stock is not going to do much until then When it does go up ,and it will, its going to go up fast and you just might miss the rally if your not watching it. Its best to buy now and just go away until August It won't get much cheaper if at all as it is now."

"Jake Laperruque, senior counsel for the Project On Government Oversight, wrote on Twitter that the new documents show the FBI has been conducting so-called backdoor searches on people “for domestic policing” without receiving the mandated approval from the court.“Essentially this means the FBI was able to conduct warrantless domestic searches without the FISA Court approval they were supposed to get, at best because personnel were sloppy, at worst because using the default settings gave plausible deniability for abuse,” he added."

"Todays early attempt to take the stock up to around 248 failed miserably and the rally ultimately failed. One would think that after almost touching 280 last week that a drop to 240 would be an excellant entry point for buyers. Unfortunately the traditional technical measures like MACD, Stochastics, RSI aren't even close to oversold. There are other more reliable measures such as Fibonnacci analysis that show that the retracement is about 50% at 235 and 68% at 224. Unless some extraordinary game changing fundamental event were to emerge the best that can be hoped for is a decent technical rally that might get us up into the 250's before the selling would ensue again. Buy and hold folks generally look the other way as the prize is a few years from now and the stock is well north of 300. I am long 600-700 shares and if I can trade the swings with various option strategies profitably then I increase the bottom line sooner and add to my position irrespective of future price movements. I also insulate against some of these preciptitous price drops that seem to be quite frequent."

Well whisper numbers are not hazarding a guess about earnings this time. Analyst consensus is -$1.17.Given the huge loss Boeing took last quarter I'm wondering if they wrote off as much as they could to show a positive number this quarter. Just saying.
You have to set the bear traps very carefully or they might be able to escape
This is crazy. This is about Boeing not reinstating the dividend. The way it dropping you would think they had a great dividend. They don't and the best thing for them is to hold off on the dividend and build planes with the money. Big money is creating fear over nothing. Unfortunately small investors panic sell to make the big boys even richer.
"OMG, electrical issues, which were downplayed by Jafferies, now top of their concerns with Boeing’s turn around!!!"
BA's nonstop quality issues are puzzling - is this a result of cutting corners or poor supervision? It's affecting the brand name.

Boeing should hire overtime staff to fix the electrical issues fast because time is money. So we can get back to dishing out those deliveries

"Not looking very promising:“ The families of those killed in the crashes have again voiced criticism of both Boeing and the F.A.A.:“Boeing proclaims to be a changed company, but it’s clear their culture is built around cutting corners and putting profits over safety,” Yalena Lopez-Lewis, whose husband, Antoine, died in the crash in Ethiopia, said in a statement on Friday. “Since the deaths of 346 people, their sole focus has not been safety but to perform the bare minimum for regulators to allow it back in the air. This grounding illustrates that the Max is still unsafe to fly.”"

"BA bulls will say anything to try and support their outlook, except admit the 737 MAX was a cluster #$%$ of seismic proportions that has financially crippled BA into becoming a state-subsidized, zombie company, fueled solely by inflated military/government contracts. It's internationally subsidized as well; Air Canada to receive the Canadian government $4.1B grant to stay alive, they were contractually mandated to buy +50 737 MAXs; something the airline did not want to do. For BA, rather than innovate, and develop a new single-isle aircraft fit for the 21st century, they tried to retrofit a 1960's model, manipulate political bodies, and it's shown their flatfootedness. The MAXs ""order book"" is a joke with routine cancelations. It's a shame; BA was once a beacon of American safety and quality standards- it's a long way to go to recoup their lost ground- expecting to see continued downward pressure (STRONG SELL SIGNS; down 11% since I vocalized my opinion first on 04-16-2021). Better off buying Lockheed Martin (LMT)!!"

BA -2.86% passed a key milestone during an engine test on Thursday.The eight-minute ground test of the Space Launch System engines at a National Aeronautics and Space Administration facility in Mississippi followed an unsuccessful run in January that jeopardized the agency’s broader target of returning U.S astronauts to the moon by the middle of the decade.The four engines previously used in the space shuttle program ran for the planned eight minutes during the latest test, twice as long as NASA said it needed to secure enough data for a live rocket launch. During January’s run, they stayed on for little over a minute"

Boeing needs to announce the dividend returning. They should give every shareholder a one time payment who is holding shares on the day they announce the news. That way no one can just jump in for the one time payment. This strategy would get the share price moving higher and reward the shareholders who held through this difficult period with Boeing. Maybe we all should email Mr. Calhoun with that suggestion!
Up up and away for this great re-opening play!

"Boeing’s gap in its lineup has been ripe for a new product for several years. The niche that was previously filled by the 757 and 767 has no replacement, leaving a wide gap between Boeing’s largest 737 and smallest 787. A new mid market single aisle long range plane would make sense. There’s some movement in this niche, but not yet by Boeing."
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it had approved the design for the Boeing 737-8200, part of the Boeing 737 MAX series, a necessary step before the U.S. planemaker can begin delivering the higher-capacity airplanes to Ryanair.The FAA said the 737-8200 incorporates all of the design improvements that were part the 20-month review of the 737 MAX that led to the ungrounding of the MAX in November, more than a year after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.Ryanair first ordered the 737-8200 plane, which it is configuring to seat 197 passengers, in 2014. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency still must approve the aircraft, a move that could come soon after the FAA approval."

The price is supported at the current level and it is oversold. I believe the correction is almost over. A massive rally will come. Stay invested in BA and stay strong.

There will be a lot of people buying in and you know it will come back soon and out of nowhere."

"“People have an 18-month supply of events, visits and vacations to catch up on,” said Michael McCall, professor of hospitality business at Michigan State University. “There is a substantial pent-up desire to travel. Families have not hugged or spent time together.”"
I told everybody about a week ago that Boeing could drop down to between 245 and 250. This is where you want to start buying. I don't see Boeing going below 245. Remember I said it would be summer time before this stock really takes off. Once airlines see a steady rise in air travel the orders will start coming in
