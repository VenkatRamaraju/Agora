Recent headlines and conversations for VZ
"I keep wanting to buy into VZ, but my phones are with Sprint, and everytime I attempt to convert over to Verizon service I run into some tech glitch on their website, then I booked 2 different appts in Verizon stores and they told me they couldn't help me switch multiple lines over as no one in the store was trained how to do that. Called the help line and they told me to do it online. Talk about avoiding new customers wow. Makes it tough to want to buy the stock when I can see first hand how bad they are at gaining new customers."
Tuhrd yahoo continues to puke their liberally biased agenda every day.
Buying opportunity!!!
Looks like its headed back to the 200 DMA. Putting my order in around $54.25.
"VZ can reach history high in short term, because it's EARNINGS continue growth and 5G wireless network coming soon,"
"I think Mr. Trump should lift all travel bans from China and Europe, and let them visit Verizon headquarters in Philly and Yahoo Finance Offices. And once it spreads there, maybe yahoo finance will stop its ignorant comments about someone trying to save US lives."
This stock just keeps swimming in circles.
"Heres an awful story from Business Insider, a source that VZ likes to use over on the right of your screen.The article says ""patients over 80 have a 15% death rate. Based on 2 million cases. But only 25% of the 2 million cases are recovered or have resulted in death..So Business Insider is including people who still have the disease in its mortality rate. For cases where there has been a recovery or death, the death rate for those 80 or over is 4 times 15%, at 60%. Not factored in to the numbers, is how many people have died from it, but weren't tested, and aren't on the totals, and how many people had it, and didn't know, or didn't go to a doctor or hospital. The number of all cases is probably closer to 5 million or more.But a death rate isn't based on the number of people who are infected. the death rate is based on the total deaths divided by the total number of cases recovered plus total number died. Business Insider. Do they require their reporters to have a degree or GED. I guess not. https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-death-age-older-people-higher-risk-2020-2"
"Yahoo, still deletes naughty words. That's why FB and Goog are successful. They don't delete anything learn a lesson Yahoo. The mother hen Marissa M is gone free yahoo from her bible thumping logic maybe viewers would come back."
"Dead money. Don't be the last to rotate to growth...CURLF, GTBIF, CRLBF, OGI, APHA, CGC"
I would never invest in a company that promotes such hate oriented state run propaganda and promoting it as news with the likes of the huffington post. Tmus is a much etter investment option.
wutz that got to do with this VOMIT pos.................

DIVIDEND. price should be $65!
"Why does Kamala Harris smile, giggle, and laugh so much in her interviews? Is it a California (Valley Girl) thing or what (somewhat condescending)? It may be she thinks ""it's a sure thing"" she will become POTUS by default, as Biden is ""voted for"" as the Democrat figure head, Harris ""chosen"" behind doors beforehand as POTUS after election when Biden decrepits out. Is this a credible poise to take as candidate? I wouldn't doubt every trick conceivable to dupe voters is in play to get the Democratic brats in office November 3rd. It's become overly offensive the colors they show campaigning this election, just blue sham!"
"Sprint will only offer the $15 deal through Friday, June 15. All pricing requires customers to set up auto-pay, and all Sprint unlimited plans are subject to throttling during heavy traffic periods.Even as Sprint (NYSE: S) waits for federal regulators to consider its merger with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), it still has to focus on its own operations. Moving forward, it's going to continue to employ some of the strategies it currently uses to gain customers -- but amp them up.Sprint will only offer the $15 deal through Friday, June 15. The company plans to end the aggressive offer this Friday night, citing heavy demand from customers.Sprint drawing massively attention last week when it introduced a new $15 unlimited talk, text and data promotion to lure customers from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. It seems to have worked.With its $15 per month per line price Sprint's promotion unlimited plan came in well under rival plans, and even its own, unlimited pricing. At $60 for four lines, the offer is $40 cheaper a month than the $100 Sprint currently charges for four lines of its Unlimited Freedom plan. AT&T and Verizon each charge $160 for their cheapest unlimited plans. T-Mobile, which is currently in the process of merging with Sprint, also charges $160 for four lines, though that price includes the taxes and fees.How does the $15 Sprint deal work?Sprint's offer is legit, but it does have some caveats. Customers must either bring a phone that works on the Sprint network or purchase one outright. The carrier won't be offering the option to lease or finance a phone.Still, if you have a phone or are willing to purchase one, Sprint is offering significant savings. Its regular Unlimited Freedom plan charges $60 for one line and $100 for two. With the $15 ""Unlimited Kickstart"" plan consumers pay $15 for each line they purchase.In addition, anyone opting for the cheap plan won't be able to use their phone as a mobile hotspot. They will also only get standard-definition video -- not the high definition video offered in its traditional unlimited plan. Gaming and music will also be offered at slower data rates.Is this deal worth it?If you own a phone (or will buy one) and can live without using your device as a hub, the pricing makes this offer very appealing. T-Mobile, which is usually the lowest-priced carrier after Sprint, charges $70 for one line with unlimited everything. That price goes down to $40 per line when a customer gets four lines.You can get four unlimited Sprint lines for less than the price of one from T-Mobile. It's hard to argue with that deal, even if joining Sprint means accepting a slightly inferior network -- assuming you live somewhere with decent Sprint coverage."
Hans makes me want to sell my stock... he should not be doing TV interviews
"This board is full of shorts, buy and hold! Let’s squeeze the shorts like a lemon!"
"10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring Every DAY in the US. They are seeking income and income growth. VZ is a very good stock for them. The dividend yield should be around 4%......so the shares should be trading in the mid-$50s"
Sell VZ and buy T. T to $40 by year end.
"$INSG have a strong 5G footprints should be target by $CSCO or $INTC , Strong partnership with $VZ and $ERIC and $NOK"
"NO ONE in America should be doing any business with VZ because they have take away your rights as the YAHOO NATZI censor what you can see , read and post."
"I am baffled why Anderson Cooper, will not ask the POPE,for a clarification on the Church's position on Gay rights.Anderson, more interested on Stormy Daniel's fixationon president Trump. VZ is becoming the darling of large hedge funds."
delete all your comments and yahoo accounts based on the latest changes of Y finance
"Please dump your VZ, drive the price down so I can buy more. Love the dividend. Held VZ for a long time. Thanks in advance for your help."
VZ looks great here phone use is up since virus news plus 4% divy looks good when 10yr treasury at 1%
i am selling and buying t.
The news on the economy will not spare even good companies like vz and their dividend would prop the stock up. Time to take money off the table.
"For Stevie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ue5F57dZMU"
"I started buy vz in 2011, last time I added any was 2017. Bought some more this morning though, price just too low to be ignored"
"Very manipulated stock. The machines and algo's know that human tendency is to try and buy a 4% yield when the price is low. Soooooo.....the machines keep punishing the small (novice) investors every day until the desperation is too much to bare, then they sell thier stock and the algo's take it back to $60-$61. Then we repeat the process."
Bought some for my IRA and for my wife's IRA. even if it trades sideways for a while getting a fair dividend.
I guess the market has already priced in this net neutrality news. also I think vz is already trading near a perceived high range. What this news may do is stabilize vz above the 50 threshhold
"Vz doing the slow trickle to the low $50s. You don't throw a frog in boiling water, you slowly heat the water so the frog won't jump out."
"VZ the company without a future , VZ has way to much debt and can not compete with FREE inthe new world they now face LOL,LOL Sell before you lose even more money because VZ is now losing customers to T at a record pace. LOL,LOL,LOL or you be learn to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
I AM NEW HERE- MY FRIEND Coco told me about this post.EOM
The Chinese have closed their markets for the week. President Trump is talking about delisting Chinese stocks on our exchanges. Could this not start an ETF meltdown. Plus the Police are firing on Hong Kong protestors. Getting back in to this for the dividend could be costly?
Lost a lot of business accounts. Some residential accounts too...
VZ is last place for 5G. Fire the CEO!
"Sleazy Joe Bribing China Biden crack heads, what a lowlife fraud and his VP lawyer type political hack.None off them have ever worked an honest day in their life... Political frauds enrich themselves whilethey want you on bicycle in a 600 sqft room while they have 10,000 sqft per person gated community house that they scammed from tax payers... Dem Rats complete frauds."
"Me love  VZ long time.Dividend goes up every year, cost stays same. Yield improves over time, remind me of apple fritters with vanilla sauce!"
Any thoughts on strike price by December?
"SHEP. HERE............................... I don't know how many on here use T Mobil for your carrier, but my daughter is switching to it. She ordered a new Iphone from T Mobil and she was telling us how much she will save using it. (I think her carrier was ATT before but not sure). We use Verizon and we have a big bill so after she switches and we see if she is pleased with the service, we will switch, too. Also, TMobil gives you Netflix each month."
"Vertical Integration ,how did all the losers get bought while the winners like Facebook,Google and Apple stand alone and thrive?Verizon -Yahoo just another in the line of failure in tech media world.Only Verizon’s massive cash flow from cellular subscribers saved them,stick to the knitting."
Verizon will tootle up to $55
What you people don't realize is it's not that it's a slow mover there are more sellers than buyers wonder why because there's no growth no value and no money to be made unless you're shorting it
Pocket rocket
guess who is hosting superbowl. oh Verizon.
"Yahoo ""Conversations"" worst than ever. What the hell Verizon, I thought once we got rid of the dumb blond things would improve ....they have not.Filters don't work, links don't work what the hell you guys doing? Is MM still running it behind the scenes?"
"A lot of people learned why you DON'T place a ""Market SELL"" order during times of high volatility. Looks like about 2million shares dumped at the open as it dropped to nearly 49, cleaning out the standing limit buy orders before ramping right back up to 52 then 52+. I wish I would have had foresight to put in a limit buy order in at $49.50, but I had stuff to do this morning and wasn't watching. Besides I'm in long term and not a day trader... I seldom guess correcting on swing trades."
What’s up with the shares price today. News?
a company that is has lost it's way due to myopic management.
"VZ's wireline restructurings since it started to sell areas like Hawaii I believe back in 2002, then several other sizable sales of many GTE areas VZ picked up, notably to Fairpoint and Frontier. I read that Lowell McAdam pushed for those sales when he was running wireless. The result is FIOS located in the dense NE like NYC & Boston -- hit interactive and zoom in and out. It's packed in the best areas in the US. The Boston FIOS includes the 5G platforms -- some main fiber trunks are 1700 lines in one sheath to feed branches for 5G. https://broadbandnow.com/Verizon-Fios"
"I see Yahoo is now putting this message on the bottom of their articles:Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions. In order to improve our community experience, we are temporarily suspending article commenting.VZ, why is this? What is Yahoo trying to hide? Dissent to their writing? I can tell you, from reviewing upwards of a million posts, that when you strip out the vitriolic replies, what remains is a handful of rebuttal remarks that takes exception to what Yahoo wrote, and tends to be much closer to the truth than what Yahoo wrote. I, as a VZ shareholder, do not like seeing this, and do not like supporting such libelous drivel.Hans Vestberg, you have your hands full dealing with a highly competitive wireless landscape. You need to focus on it, as VZ has world class assets that need your attention. The Media Division is NOT world class, it's not even ""sophomore"" class. PLEASE for the sake of shareholders work with your board and dispose of this wasting asset. The money is better spent investing in additional spectrum and alliances with HIGH QUALITY output, like Disney +."
Without Buffet support technically this company would steadily drop to below 50 usd. Let's see if technical chart gets reverse over the long run.
"attention Verizon internet advertisers. please encourage Verizon to change their news sources, and get rid of puke companies like Business Insider, which has nothing to do with business. I'd be clicking many stories, if they weren't about the person, and 55million other people voted for. if the stories had an ounce of truth. Yes, Verizon, you should talk to your marketing people and ask them how many more clicks you would get, how many more millions of dollars in ad revenues, you are passing by, by playing puke politics. BUSINESS INSIDER IS COSTING YOU A FORTUNE."
"VZ stock close to a 52 week high, but here's the kicker......A 6 PE and 5% dividend. Pretty dang sweet spot right now. Lot of room for the stock price to go up."
"Worse and worse, now down over 1%. To think people on here believe it's going to 100, pitiful..."
Any thoughts on how the Senate race in Georgia will effect this stock?
"Sad that Yahoo has become a useless resource! Nothing but click bait. Headline, five meds that are actually are bad for you, followed by a useless paragraph with a watch the video link. Trash!"
cash is leaving due to rising yields of treasuries...utilities and value being sold. along with value stocks...
VZ and Yahoo....the biggest propagandist since Joseph Goebbles.
"the rookies on this board- what is wrong with you? So many questions on GW charge and earnings. They pre-announced the write-down in December. It is a non-cash accounting charge. Yes, it impacts earnings.However, most analysts if not all will strip out this one time charge for OATH when comparing this years QTR to last years.The bigger issue is how Verizon board and management overpaid for these POS companies, and had to take a $4.5B charge.They obviously overpaid, and big time. That is the biggest issue, and they should improve their M&A program and fire the idiots who signed off on it."
"Chart looks terrible, but support should have been around $44....looks like ABSOLUTE low could be $42.....I know there is a price war going on, but amazed that dividend shoppers are not in....even Cramer said this AM that this is overdone."
The stock is trading at 2000 level.Is it worth holding it for 20+ years?.?
"Verizon If you're listening, could you please bring back the old Yahoo Message Board and old Yahoo Finance in general. The changes are really terrible."
"I was fully expecting weak earnings and another pull back to $48 gearing up for 5g. out of all the dow companies, based on fundamentals vz is most undervalued imho. also, what other dow has such growth potential? 5g opens huge new markets. vz can become to Amazon of media. 5g, without government interference, has the potential to make cable TV obsolete."
"Cramer, said to buy when it went under $50, did I listen, NO!"
"Rotation is now on for value stocks. It's been over a decade in the making. I'm 100% value and dividend right now, and it's been paying off in spades. Tech is a wreck."
"21% gain on this since buying Dec 2017. Not bad for slow growth, huh lol"
R has no clue on VZ. Trading my CDs that yield 2%Invesring VZ. Yield 4+
Who trades this for half a percent gains?
"I seriously hate this stock, the company......not so much."
"I wonder if VZ will be buying some content soon, id think CBS would be a target"
"Anybody having trouble with their Yahoo Portfolios? Mine has been broken since yesterday morning. ""Can't load portfolio""."
Somebody knows something about the upcoming dividend or this stock would not be dropping like it has leprosy!
"Interesting movement so far today. Bouncing up and down. The whole market is red, which means the VZ finishing green would be huge."
F- Lowell
I have TMUS love their prices but cell service is bum scoot
Nice volume. Long and strong VZ!!!
Hold for 60.00
#vz VZ conf is today March 10 at&t's is on Friday March 12
end of day rally like Friday?
Divy increase today!
"Although it's somewhat old news, Verizon announced nationwide 5G (1800 cities+). So they will have two tiers of service - mmWave in large cities, mid-band everywhere else (so slower speeds)."
Yeah baby this will go up.
Wow this thing is having a very bad 5 days... ouch!
5g health risks are real
VZ wired a shipyard for 5G - up to 1 mil devices per sq kilometer - https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-lights-first-5g-shipyard-113010408.html
I have been a verizon customer for decades. They have been robbing me with bad service and high prices. Yet I never switched companies because the provider is very reliable. This is why I invested money in VZ stocks even when I dont like this company. They have super loyal customer base with people like me.
"Google anyone. Google Pixel are only ""on Verizon.” Geeks may change but likely to bring new users.I have had I phones for years but may switch. And get rid of AT&T.Could not decide today so I did bought the stock instead."
Joe dead horse in the race is not the last. Thank you for tell me off. Yes I bought POTN and VZ and both are better than your MJNA and MU.... so.....

"￼ NOTICE TO DISREGARD -- Verizon CommunicationsMay 12, 2018 03:01 ET | Source: Verizon CommunicationsHONOLULU, May 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- We are advised by Verizon Communications that journalists and other readers should disregard the news release, ""Verizon customers can donate to support Hawaii disaster relief efforts with text-to-donate campaign"" issued May 12, 2018, over GlobeNewswire."
Think $VZ will buyout $INSG partners in 5G now rolling out also have partnerships with many like $ERIC $NOK
"The main reason I don’t own VZ is Yahoo and Huffington Post. I just can’t invest in those sick puppies. Yahoo finance is OK reporting the numbers, but I don’t trust their commentary one bit."
"Forgot to comment on this a couple weeks ago. Oppenheimer conference with VZ was 8/12. Here's the link to the conference transcript, and I dare anyone to find a single mention of Media Division anywhere in it: https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/2020-08/Oppenheimer-Conf-Transcript-2020-08-12.pdf Media is becoming an afterthought to VZ."
"Were there any Telcom related announcements around 12pm?That was a healthy 2+ hours after the T downgrade... so don't think that was the cause.But at 12pm VZ, T, TMUS & Sprint all took a dive together... hence wondering if FCC said anything around then.The rest of the market pretty much continued to trade the same way it had before 12..."
Going to $55. Upgraded to $62. Made $25K in two weeks!!!
If your looking for divs this is less than 5% check out MORL MRRL AI CBL NYMT I like something above 10% and the first two are above 20%.
Can you hear me now! !
Anyone think Verizon will increase the dividend anytime soon?
CEO is anti-free speech! Belongs in Russia not USA!
"Verizon's Yahoo news site is so biased left, so dishonest, you have to wonder about management of the whole company."
"Verizon turning on 5G network for phones in Chicago, MinneapolisApr. 3, 2019 11:04 AM ET|About: Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor Verizon (VZ +0.2%) says it's lighting up its 5G network for smartphones in parts of Chicago and Minneapolis.The network only works with one phone at first: the Motorola Z3, with an added 5G Moto Mod accessory. But Samsung will launch a Galaxy S10 5G model in the year's second half that will be exclusive to Verizon for a time.The company says customers could see download speeds of up to 1 Gbps, though typical download speeds will be 450 Mbps."
"Zacks has an article out about how interest rates paid on CD(s), will likely continue in the very low range. There are an entire generation of investors that can not get interested in bonds, period. For example Warren Buffett, an old school investor if there ever was one, says he has never owned a bond. But, if you google his holdings you will see Verizon included. More scary news, not from Zack’s, but I was shocked to hear how many dividend paying etf(s) go out of business each year. Can all of us Verizon longs be that smart? Apparently we are. I always quote Albert Einstein, to as many new investors I can. The number one math man. Basically said that reinvesting, the compounding of interest rates on dividend paying stocks, was the most amazing aspect of math."
"TERRIBLE MGMT. STOCK DROPS LIKE A STONE , AND THEIR UNDER A ROCK"
This should close over $50.. added some here
"attention Verizon shareholders. Verizon is sacrificing tons of ad revenue by being far left liberal. All we see here are Business Insider (run by an analyst who had conflicts of interest), AP, and now even CNBC. At your shareholders meeting, and by voting against the entire Board of directors, you tell Verizon you are sick and tired of them violating their fiduciary duty to you, the shareholders. Tell them to run unbiased stories that many more people will read. no just far left anarchists and globalists. you shareholders are being used. I would never own Verizon. EVER. For you see, I love freedom."
"Down as usual today, just like everyday, what a dud!!"
"verizon has a huge load of debt, price going nowhere for a long time"
The crooked Verizon board deleted my recent comments about there monopoly in some rural areas where others competitors are not allowed to compete in the best interest of consumers.
i bought puts at the open for $50Will they push it below $50 today?
VZ is up 4.91% to 52.39
VZ network quality is superior to TMUS and T.Residential customers want cheap.Commercial customers might value quality more and be willing to to a premium once 5G directly affects their business through IOT.
ex-div today
"I have sold calls on my VZ shares for strike price $62.5 to hedge the ER. Either way I'll be fine with the outcome, if they get filled after the ER, I will sell VZ at $63+, otherwise I just hold the shares and pocket the premium."
NEVER EVER by any stock that takes away your First Amendment rights. You will regret it in the future FACT
Why can't VZ bring the old message board back .
"Nose bleed highs, yield under 4%. Sell here, buy back lower. At least your IRA shares."
This thing has too much debt. Knew it was too good to be true.
Verizon replaces experienced workers with cheap incompetent replacements? What a great place for workers!
Verizon can do a big dividend hike. They should go ahead and do it. Get some momentum. :-)
Any news?
merger approval..... T Mobile just announced with SprintGood for VZ---- and Coco still suks worse then ever
same old games china talks or not. Wake up people market have one way to go here. Down big its been all games by FEd as always to hold up over priced markets.
"yahoo has turned into the filth of lies and liberal left wing hacks.leader #3, behind MSDNC and CNN."
Would be a great day in America for lower income stock investors/retired people if some blue chip companies would turn into REITS and pay out massive dividends.
This is not a growth stock. This is more like a utility. If you are looking for high flying growth then you are looking in the wrong place. Once you purchase the stock your dividends are locked in and will most likely go up. If you are reinvesting the dividends and the price dips you pick up more shares at a cheaper price at a higher yield. Over time the stock will go up so when you cash out you not only make $$ on the higher share price but also on the dividends you collected along the way.
"Dump this, buy #VZ."
"VZ the making of a EU controlled company to control the American people LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
"For what it's worth, I've taken to contacting the largest Verizon shareholders and am taking a strong activist stand on its ownership of its media division. It's a drag on shareholder value. If it's worth so much, why not just spin it off, like Danaher did with its test division (Fortive)? Wow, was that ever wonderful. I owned Danaher stock, and next thing you know, a couple years later I nearly doubled my money, all because they unlocked shareholder value. So, Verizon, why not spin off Yahoo and let's see what it's worth, OK?"
Did anyone else lose the ability to give a thumbs up/down. As of yesterday mine went away.
Strong Buy at this levels https://www.cweb.com/verizon-shows-strong-strong-operational-performance-and-wireless-customer-growth/
"analysts upgrade VZ one by one, that means VZ EARNINGS of June quarter sure be very good, SO don't sell VZ, strong buy VZ, VZ sure be continue rise, VZ start roll out 5G networks in end of this year, SO it's time to buy VZ now, VZ networks signals still leading very far, others don't have enough customers to improve their networks signals, SO VZ networks signals will leading forever, SO buy VZ don't worry, VZ reasonable price is $62 per share now,"
Reliable OLD Stinky!
Is Verizon trying to see how far down the gutter they go before any management changes will be made.
"The so-called expert analyst downgrades, Tim Armstrong articles, dividend increase complaints, 5G timeline, firefighter bandwidth throttling etc., etcAll the attempts to keep it down are not working. Keeps fighting back. If we can break 55 again it's going to be an interesting fall. Long VZ!"
your app stinks. slow and doesnt work. quit messing it up.
How many millions of dollars are we going to reward management in excess of the millions of dollars we are already paying them for this 'outstanding' performance. This company and stocks performance had to have obviously 'exceeded' the goals set by the board of directors and the compensation committee?????
Down $1.79 today wow. Was there a downgrade?
"In the past, I've traded VZ, but as I've aged, I'm long for the dividend. Reading the experts BS that rising interest rates will hurt dividends is hardly true. In most instances, qualified dividends are tax free. Bank interest is not. Unless rates skyrocket, VZ paying nearly 5% is unbeatable."
TMUS and S are having merger issues. Seems TMUS doesn't want to pay what they agreed to. S is overpriced.
Unreal pop the top.
Breaking out over 61.50 we go to fresh new highs.
buffett's more than 400 million underwater on his great investment. rumor has it he paid about $58.5 average price per share for VZ.
"You get to pick which one you think is right , Just means either Warren does not care about your First Amendment Rights or Warren made a big mistake and still needs to sell. Does not matter to me What Warren does because Warren more than likely will not make it to see his choise he has made will effect your life in the future and support Companies that take away your First Amendment rights is not going to effect Warrens future , but for sure it will make a very big difference in your future and not for the good"
My question is would Warren buy the stock now? Didn't the net profit drop approximately 10% in the fourth quarter?
It's #$%$ like this https://finance.yahoo.com/news/built-girls-speck-verizon-partner-170000740.html Needless bs
VZ GOING HIGHER !! SOONER or later
"Damn, you alone could Ruin the s&p 500 clean sector earnings.... Lol no pressure Verizon"
perplexing stock in the space of about 2 weeks went from 48 to 52 now back to 47 anybody have an explanation?
Wow this is fun! See if yahoo deletes this like the other sage posts I have made!!
"Verizon globalism propaganda machine Yahoo Finance has a headline ""in a reversal of policy, Trump moves the US Embassy in Israel"". It should have said "" 3 previous presidents all promised to move it, and only Mr. Trump kept his word."""
"Hey Verizon shareholders. have another terrible thing Verizon does to people who view yahoo fiancé pages. Every time I go to get a quote, image8.pubmatic shows a pop up window, and tries to download malware. this is the only site that does it. so not only is Verizon trying to let in millions of low paid workers to man their phones, they are also attacking users with malware, who thye probably have an agreement with. these are bad people. and your shares are helping them."
shorts are savoring that resistance at 55 but forgetting there's also that 59 resistance as well.Longs should not despair....as 5G is here now and will only get bigger. VZ isn't going anywhere. Ignore the short banter.
This is a stock for people who want to invest in the past. It will slowly go away - and so will your investment.
Bottom folks............time to buy.............
Disney realistic for vz?
"bottom line is wall street is a selling game all the time, why are we all dumb to go long, look how fast they ended the bull market ,,less then 2 weeks they ended it all"
Really thinking about selling all my shares of VZ and going with TMUS. At least they seem to have something going on.
48 days ago 61.5 duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
OUch! Fed meeting rising interest rates reason behind the sudden fall?
"When is VZ going to fix the robo-call intrusion into households 4,6,8....times a day.....These calls are targeted with evil intentions to take advantage of people, obtain personal information and yet VZ lets billions of calls through every year....They could stop them, but then they would be losing alot of call volume........VZ is boycotting Facebook, but I say they should get their own house in order......Aside from a dividend what else does this stock have to offer in terms of share price gain returns?"
Long term this will become a GE
"By August 5, the stock will reach $ 60 ."
"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) disclosed a new stake in Verizon Communications (VZ) during the fourth quarter, according to a 13-F securities filing.Berkshire Hathaway now holds 147.6 million shares of Verizon, a stake valued at around $8.6 billion at the end of 2020, making it the 6th largest position in the famed stock picker's portfolio.Verizon is the parent company of Yahoo Finance. Shares of Verizon were last trading 2.95% higher in the after-hours session near $55.75."
"The blind man that can see the future LOL,LOL,LOL All by mistake or was it a plan and for sure no one will ever believe how it happened LOL,LOL Just remember to sell any move higher in your stocks now because you won't believe it if I told you what's coming next. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Sell. No catalyst for the stock to go up higher.
Time to climb. Bottom is gone.
I believe VZ will be a core holding of mine when the dust settles. Have higher debt/equity than I like but they at least are investing in their core business (unlike T) which is an essential service for humanity. They also pay me to own it. Survivor in the carnage. What other core holdings will you all be buying?
Red lol! 
just got support in Halftime report and only down mildly 0n a day market down
till how much yall think this will go up
yes!!!! closed at 51.90 be nice!
Why is VZ stock going backwards?
time to buy. the time is now
Safer to nibble at $54.
"AMZN failed heavily after its e/r today, meaning the communication services also were not good due to slow down in ecomony / slow growth...Same for VZ..."
"Verizon Bill's are so expensive, most won't pay their bill. Nflx tsla long live nation lvn"
Any good American should sell their vz because they own Yahoo fake news.
"VERIZON UNION SLIME HAVE REALLY BEEN HURT BY LOSING THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.. It's been a disaster for the roughly 39,000 East Coast Union Slime Balls who are out on Strike. Over 49 people have died after not receiving hospital care. More, are receiving inferior treatment, meds and andtherapies. The suffering has hit home. (not just with the union slime balls themselves - but, with their family members). The Children of The Verizon Union Slobs are the ones getting the shaft.Verizon Union Slime Balls - God's special creatures. They are going down the tubes. And, Americarejoices! We love it."
Bad quarter results ?

Verizon the company that use to be great. I am trying my best to defund them I only a few things left to do.
"WOW! beat 5 cents, nice :)"
Looks like Ergen with much more valuable L band bought at bargain basement prices forcing VZ and T to overpay for inferior c band. Smart cookie is who is about to be a big party crasher in the space.
now we know why the siht div increase
Sooooooooooooooo what's the issue with VZ today?
My New Years wish version goes down.
BARCHART rate VZ as a BUY. It's all here...https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/VZ
GOING BELOW 40
"Sector rotation out of Telecom and utilities. Good time to buy for income. Seems the only way to pick up cheap stocks, same as big oil a few years ago. Chevron was in the $70 to 80 range for at least 2 years, all the while paying a dividend, last I looked it was in the $120's. Not sure why the electric utilities are down, but Telecom isn't t viewed as tech anymore."
Why is 2020 EPS blank in Financial statement?
Buy VZ shares today at this crazy discount!
"this is just a long term bond with potential upside, just like T. Park cash = get dividend, pretty simple. They won't be debt laden forever, they are cash flow machines and they have no real competitition. They survived the financial apocolypse and corona, people kept paying for cell and internet service. That's not changing."
"Great technical move today,is Verizon can stop dipping on every upswing and deny the market $60 should be an easy target.Tomorrow will be a good indicator."
5G makes this a $100 stock in 2 years
VZ - Why no reporting on Mexico trade agreement. Must be too much anti trump news to report.
So. Best of luck. Yeah don't ever sell this mean one ever.!
"Sheila Behr is now a contributor for Yahoo Finance, the propaganda arm of Verizon. She didn't like the msall to medium sized banks being freed from Dodd-Franks. I used to respect this woman when she was head of the commodities trading commission, Now shes a bought and paid for political activist."

The Verizon stores are empty. everyone is tired of the harassment.
"If one owns stock in Yahoo and the sale to Verizon goes through as planned would I then own shares of Verizon? Or Altaba or Yahoo? As I understand it the Yahoo name will cease to exist. What happens to my shares? And also what about the buyback of Yahoo shares? Is that the way to go or is it better to hold onto my Yahoo shares? Lastly: If I owned Yahoo, Verizon and Alibaba (which I do) would one hold onto all 3 or sell? And if so which one?"
"In a break from the political garbage, i appreciate this steady stock with great dividends. Has been a great add to the portfolio-"
Let's downgrade to 65 so we can plummet to 58 that sure makes sense.
I have always added when Vz <=$56... fortunately for me.Rock steady w/div and when the market improves so does Vz.
"Verizon's debt us not a problem unless the competitive environment were to change to such a huge degree. However, the debt was ammassed to acquire 700 MHz and AWS mid-band spectrum and build out networks that has helped increase revenue. VZ should be paying down a significant portion of that debt. Having low interest is nice but it still must be paid off or it jeopardizes the long-term prospects."
"If Yahoo Continues To Bash Trump Each & Every Day..........I will sell my VZ stock, cancel and change my cell phone program to a less expensive provider, which I can do now!Change Yahoo or adidos......"
"I've bought and sold VZ multiple times this year already. Sold at the start of the year around $52, bought back at $46 and sold again on the spike above $50. Bought back today at $45.50 and anotehr lot at $45. The yield is abut 5.20% at those prices. Too good to pass up. Tax reform will lower their tax rate from 35% to 20%. That's an extra $1B+ in cash flow every quarter. That is huge."
"After Trump wins on Tuesday, Huffington and all the crazy left news rags will be sold or out of business.Only way they survived is past few years of Trump bashing. Say good bye once and for all."
VZ is down 4.92% to 51.64
REV Miss Causing A Selloff !
I hope there will be a dividend raise

"I believe VZ, T and other blue chips are down today not because of fundamentals (which are rock solid), but because of forced liquidations and margin calls related to GME and other poor quality stocks skyrocketing for no legitimate reasons other than a war between shorts, hedge funds and these ""fad"" trading platforms (i.e. Robin Hood). In time VZ will go back up to where it should be trading at."
HAHAHAHA
"Verizon transformation article:""Verizon investing in virtualization to save $10 billion by 2020Verizon sees network virtualization as a “robust opportunity” to cut the costs anchored to telcos by $10 billion over the course of four years, said John Stratton, EVP and president of global operations for Verizon at the Wells Fargo Securities 2017 Media & Telecom Conference.Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam originally announced in September the company intended to slash $10 billion in business costs by 2020, allowing the organization to invest in its dividend with the savings.“(CFO Matt Ellis) and I have decided that we see a real opportunity to take hard dollar cash out of the business and have set a target of taking $10 billion of cost, hard cash, out of the business over the next four years,” said McAdam said in September. “Our goal is we’d be able to fund our dividend through cash savings in 2022.”Speaking on the company’s plans for network virtualization, Stratton said Verizon will be deploying more services based on virtilization and depending more on cloud services. In particular, the company is looking for some core technologies to virtualize the backend of its network.Verizon has already taken steps toward reducing business expenses with virtualization by focusing on software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV), which are touted for their ability to reduce operational expenditure (OPEX) and capital expenditure (CAPEX). In addition, Verizon has been pushing its cloud out to the edge and rolling out new services like its Managed SD-WAN offering. This bit of technology provides a way to create and launch a wide area network (WAN) leveraging SDN to determine the best route to direct traffic to a remote location.Network virtualization isn’t the only the way the company intends to reduce business expenses, however. The service provider has been looking at ways to improve service quality for customers with the development of new channels, such as the My Verizon app. The company hopes to reduce the manpower at its call centers by enabling customers to solve problems themselves through the app."""
NEVER buy stocks hitting 52 week lows....they almost ALWAYS go lower!!!!
yall think its gonna go higher or lower after 58 since its been its max
"ok a little light on revenues, cash flow good.. 5G costs etc...Dividend safe, annuity payment for cash lovers. HOLD, and you may get a good buying chance lower...The charts technically look a bit weak- I posted 6-8 weeks ago if it took out 61, then it would make a run for 69 which is all time high. If failed, set up in the 55-57 range, tried again and failed.And despite all of this Coco still is worse then pig vomit."
Verizon should be trading in the mid 50s.
You want a GOOD dividend check out Kinder Morgan(KMI) for 7.5%.
approaching overhead resistance? 60still one of the better stocks on the board
"here comes the sick games today, going up 25 cents, down 25 cents, then repeat the process."
How about vz earning can reach estimate?
"From 2012 to 2016, Yahoo allowed 3 billion accounts to be hacked. They only had to pay 117 million, for helping to ruin the lives of many Americans. This is what they do, and still do to this very day. They work for the global elitists, promoting hate here, trying to divide and ruin the country. And you still own Verizon shares."
"If we were to sell, what's the earliest date we can sell and still collect the dividend?"
Vz is a slower way to shrink your 401k
"All about IOT, drones, cars, shipping, logistics, freight all navigating through 5G"
Looking like a nice buying opportunity today! Hoping she’ll move closer to $55 by EOD.
"Get the FACK OUT .......................going 30""sssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
What has Verizon given to their customer nothing but lies or free stuff.
"One has to wonder why Verizon has yahoo finance saying tariffs aren't the only way to bring china to the table, and agree to free trade. wonder how many shares of Verizon that china, and wealthy Chinese investors own. me, I'd like to see Verizon prosecuted for lying to customers. many of us have moved, and were promised we could keep our same Verizon email address. so after we move, and get set up, we find we have to take out a new email address, and that it was false and misleading information given to us."
Verizon is a junk company. A dinosaur left over from a past era. Unlike AT&T and T-Mobile each of which are making bold moves in different ways to progress VZ is clinging to the past. I held this junk stock for years for the dividend but now the dividend isn't worth the risk of principal to stay on the sinking ship known as Verizon.
Nice report!There are a couple of bloggers on SA who are eating crow this morning -- love it!Now onto 5G...
"LOL,LOL,LOL told you to get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes the worst of breed and the company without a future LOL,LOL,LOL Told you to sell last year when it was over $61 and change . LOL,LOL,LOL Down DOWN , DOWN VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
My VZ dividend paid last week.
This baby is going to run to $150 like microsoft did.
what does the chart say the Moving averages are for VZ
So grateful for this pullback!!!! Getting in at a great price.
We lost nearly $2 a share in about 60 minutes of mid-day trading? How does that happen without any news?
could be over 30B for c band licenses. I guess they definitely dont want to deal with Ergen. Day of reckoning will come as there will be a new sheriff in town
"American economic strong growth, people have money to travel, SO people need best signal wireless carrier for travel, SO Verizon is best choice, because Verizon's signals cover more than anyone, Verizon's GPS better than anyone too,SO Verizon will be get more customers from it's rival,"
Can I get next dividend if I buy today?
T-mobile ain’t gonna get many business from union families anytime soon.And they’ll be paying vz for cells and bandwidth!
"5G is worth a lot less in the New Normal. No one is going out, working on the road, using mobile. Everyone is at home with cable internet. Much less need for the 5G VZ bet the farm on. And with the capital VZ is #$%$ away on build-out, forget it. Dumped this pig awhile ago."
Sell All at $47.25
vs would reach $70 by may 15 ... i am vying more
"Hammer Fiber Optics (HMMR) reports Q3 numbers, and almost profitable quarter. With telecom service overseas coming online HMMR is about to go profitable and send stock higher (pre 5G fixed wireless)"
Should we be worried about the $112 billion in debt for Verizon? Can Verizon manage that? Sounds like an awful lot of debt to me. Any comments appreciated.
"Next time a player kneels, the Air Force should ground their planes, and let China, Russia or Iran do a flyover.I'd also like to see the Cops walk out, and let the players face 70,000 angry fans. I'd also like to see the Police avoid patrolling near Verizon headquarters in Philly. Verizon is pushing disrespect through yahoo finance and business insider, and the Verizon board of directors needs to learn what disrespect really means."
Up today? Interesting. I thought yesterday that it was SO IMPORTANT that we all sell our VZ at any price to make JPM look important? NOT!!!
Wrong way VZ
markets so stupid here. Just day trading games. Back and forth until the big collapse again.
It's going to break through that triple top
VZ is over extended. Time to buy ATT a at 32 percent discount to VZ.

"Dudes, as an investment, this company seems to suck recently.What happened??"
"With the structured debt this company has and continues to increase I can not see how they can maintain the high dividend they are paying - or keep the PPS above 50. / Lucky I got in below that at $49.'s during the strike.......... if it goes back up , then will be time for me to dump it."
we'll either see 55 resistance or 59 soon.....there in NO reason for this stock to go down other than bot manipulation....but that's the market we live in now. Great quarter and even better outlook.....and we drop....smh

"Look at the price your cable ISP is charging you and then look at the price and speed of Verizon Home 5G. Will $CMCSA keep their $180 billion dollar market cap when another company is offering more speed at half the price? I'm not sure if $VZ will be the winners of the 5G war, but it will be good to at least have competition in the high speed internet arena again."
what the hell is going on today??
"Not able to leave comments means not being exposed to advertising, which means loss of revenue when advertisers notice fewer respondents sourced from Yahoo, especially now when many people are home quarantining during the pandemic spending time on their computers.

This stock sucks. Had it for 4 years and hasn’t moved
"Harvard has an endowment of 39 BILLION. meaning they could pay for all their students tuition, for a long long time.So today, Yahoo Finance is ordered by Verizon to take another cheap shot at the President, when he was disappointed that a bank helped commit fraud, and a college with 39 billion, took small business money, meant for privately run companies with no access to cash. Of course Harvard has many professors on the Chinese dole, and Verizon wants to install low cost Huawei 5g even if it allows China to spy on everyone. That bank should be banned from processing any more of those loans, and anyone who signed the paperwork from the bank and college should be defendants in a court case. I don't like a filthy rich institution stealing taxpayer money, my money, for their own use."
https://t.co/vhnmWddctO Very bullish for $INSG $MIXT $PNTR $CAMP $ORBC $TRMB Tom Toms Telematics business will do approximately 135M SAAS and 35M hardware in 2018 so assuming Hardware was sold at a 1X multiple you get 6.5X for the SAAS biz. $VZ bought FLTX at an 8x multiple.

"Stay the course, slow and steady. The 5g fixed wireless will bring in cheap cash flow as VZ can compete with all cable companies across the US, anywhere they have cell service. L Mcadams says they don't want to be a TV provider, all they have to be is the pipeline. Order Netflix, hulu or anything else off the net right to your smart TV. A study just released says people would rather default on car payments than have to reduce service on their cell phones. go long and collect the divvy."
Stupidity of markets up on stupid tariff deal with china. These markets will crash and burn. We are thousands of points over priced period. ITs all smoke and mirrors greed from Wall Street wake up people. You will see thousands of points sell off coming period.Always games not reality .Same old greed. Blame Trump when we crash and burn. Hes been using this China deal back and forth to pump and dump markets for months here. ITs usual Wall Streert games to trade back and forth. Whole system is broke period. It needs to be abolished period.
is the worst provider ever and expensive. never again
I’m done comparing VZ with T.You need to own both
Chart pattern shows VZ a screaming buy. Breakout above $55 today.

Just continues to show how ""out of touch"" these l0sers really are. They bought shares in a company and regulatory environment that they did not understand, They pumped the shares in a company and regulatory environment they did not understand. And they continue to show that they fail to understand the company and regulatory environment.There is ZERO value in GSAT's C Band. ZERO. Globalstar has C Band licenses for only two specific GPS locations in the CONUS. Sebring, FL and Clifton, TX. The spectrum in question has hundreds, if not thousands of other terrestrial licensees for point to point microwave licensed to the same spectrum in the US.This is the same concept that a TV Station in Clifton, TX which has a license to use some of the same frequencies in question for an STL link between the station and Transmitter locations could somehow parlay a point to point regulatory approval into a nationwide license that would have priority over the thousands of other licensees that have used this spectrum for decades. Globalstar understands this regulatory reality. Which is why they have never pushed such a KOCKAMAMY IDEA. The fact that they have ""vaguely misrepresented"" the idea that there may be a path forward, is something for the Courts to ultimately decide.Remember.. ""They've been busy"". LOLPCSTEL"

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-says-tax-law-increase-222051456.htmlVerizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Wednesday the tax overhaul bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year will result in a one-time reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities of about $16.8 billion. The reduction will increase earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending Dec. 31, 2017, but will not have any impact on the 2017 statement of cash flows, Verizon said in a filing. Verizon estimates that the impact of the law to earnings per share for the year ended Dec. 31 is about $4.10."

Never touch a falling knife with multiple downgrades on the way.
Encouraging VZ did NOT drop so much following the missed earnings.
If this breaks thru $44.28 we could see low $42.'s again!
If you believe interest rates will remain flat and/or go down then look at VZ has a great paying bond.

it's not the dividend which convinced Buffett is the juicy broadband which VZ auctioned for and the insane growth for the next years from it; the word is that around 20bill from the 80bill auctioned is VZ the winners should be announced around March 8th
Verizon reached a 52 Week low at 50.12
Not sure I understand why VZ and T are getting hammered today unless it’s just being pulled down by the global market correction.
I am dumping my fios because of their biased Yahoo news network.

Everyone using their phone VZ is going to do just fine during this time and will have actual earnings and then we have 5G on the way. This is one of the safe plays you get paid 5% while you wait on top of it!

Starting to see propaganda articles promoting that insurrectionists who led the terror attack against our Capitol. Come on VZ. You can do better than that. You seem to have a right wing propaganda problem.
BY FAR THE MOST CORRUPT COMPANY IN THE WORLD VENGEANCE IS MINE SAYETH THE LORD!!!!
5G is now available In parts of Los Angelos. Got to be good for national exposure. Just like when FIOS first came out. When can I get it? Same with 5G.
show me the dividend
Seems like a lot of short interest in this stock. The more % short it goes the lower the price. I guess at some point if people continue to buy as it drops they will want to close their shorts and allow the price to increase back to normal?
Great entry point at today's price! buy buy buy
Well VZ has had 6 upgrades since the end of March and the stock has gone nowhere except for the day they were announced so I'm not optimistic this one is going to be any different.
A great takeover target VZ would be ERIC Ericson stock price $7.92 and they are loaded and growth is huge 5G
Disgraceful company. Every time I buy some shares it drops two percent. Absolute garbage.
What happened after the market closed? Stock up $1.54!!!

"Congress needs to call in and grill the Wall Street firms take are shorting and working together to manipulate PFE lower, Congress also needs to make the Wall Street firms show the shares they are short just like they have to for the share held long and make them update the SC 13 forms daily , because when they lend out shares to be shorted the voting power on the share they have changes daily. What you will find is the Wall Street firm are working against their own customers and using their customers 401k money to move the stock so their firms make money. It is very clear Wall Street short PFE and the firms are working together to move it lower no matter how much good news keeps coming out , FACT. Congress needs to grill Wall Street on this and it will make great TV. LOL,LOL"
why does anyone get up or down about this stock in the short term? it ranges between 42 and 55 like clockwork. vz is all about 5g and growth potential going in to 2018. if you are stressing or optimistic about what it's doing now you are in it for the wrong reasons

A solid beat and raise tells me something is blooming at this company. $VEON Going to buy it tomorrow
put a call going up to 50!!
Oh and Ted. Watch VZ turn green soon...
Fun fact. Deep Blue State Governors like Cuomo basically have come out and said they hate you and will prevent you from getting the vaccines brought about by President Trumps Warp Speed initiative. I'm guessing their line of thinking is if they deny you those vaccines they can increase the death rates so they can wrongly justify shutting down your businesses and denying your children an education. Anybody voting for these criminals need to have their heads examined and their voting privileges suspended until they get well.

This is a 8 years high right? Next level is $60
5g will kick in very soon
"I am shocked at how bad Yahoo has declined. If I owned such an asset (if you can call it an ""asset""), I would demand that its business unit manager / president account for the decline, perhaps by even resigning. I see the Nielsen and Alexa Internet #'s for Yahoo continue to drop. Am I surprised? Hardly. Media is a drag and distraction for Verizon, and like Huffington Post needs to be jettisoned. Even BuzzFeed needs to go; Verizon still indirectly owns HuffPost due to its stake in BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed, by the way, will be merging with a SPAC so it will be going public. So basically if all goes well Verizon gets out with cash at some point, which it really needs right now."
I hope Monday is a better day
"More on BlackRock and Verizon...BlackRock owns Verizon debt as well. As I peel back the onion, it's clear BlackRock is in pretty deep with Verizon. I wish they had someone on their Board of Directors. That's another topic for another day..."

What a crock of liberal #$%$ propagandaProof Yahoo prints garbage to hurt America"
"More on Yahoo and comments being disabled...did anyone know this also happened in 2016, also just in time for the presidential election? Also there were more staff at Yahoo at that time, and the number of comments being removed, or (worse yet) edited without the poster knowing it increased as well. Now with Huff Post on the chopping block at Verizon, I have to wonder what their media strategy is these days. And what happened to Triton Rocks? I liked that person's posts."
"if Fed won't rise rate before Dec, low interest rate sure be boost Verizon stock to $59 per share before Dec."
"Unless you are investing 100k+ , I just don’t see how you can make much money off this stock. It’s underperforming the Nasdaq and if the price remains flat you are only getting a 4% dividend return. That’s terrible compared to a lot of other opportunities out there."
"Is VZ ever going to see $55, IF so when ?"
"VZ the next sinking ship without a future . LOL,LOL,LOL"
Time has come!!!
Let's see if we can close on an uptick today. It should considering the DOW is up big time.
New CEO. Same ole under performing growth of share value and excessive debt.
Tim Armstrong is to walk away with $60 million dollars from Verizon for doing absolutely NOTHING!!!!
Going to $56.00 today?
How I feel about Yahoo:
A break of 26.76 could move it up to 31.42. Strong technical buying signal at 9trading.
Looks like smart shorts are covering. I’m thinking up we from here.
"I'm changing Cell Phone Providers. Now that VZ owns owning AOL, HuffPost, and Yahoo, all they do is promote their liberal, socialists, viewpoint. Verizon has become the next Anti-American Values Conglomerate Liberal POS's! Especially the CEO and BOD of VZ, who should all be replaced. I'm voting with my $ and leaving VZ for a carrier that doesn't have a political slant to promote."
nice my verizon goin up nicely on red day
"Ironically, the Democrats calling the corporate tax cut ""for the rich"" and that if corporations got extra cash they wouldn't share it with employees probably prompted some of the rank and file benefits from T, VZ and others. They probably felt they had to shake the image. I guess they made the right mistake..."
Yahoo the anti American media site. Verizon is a leader of this.
Will buy more at 44
"VZ is Buffett’s 6th largest holding. So, it is not one of those trading stocks like GOLD."
What happens when debt is merged with more debt? We may get to find out if Verizon/Charter moves forward.
"TMUS and S are ending merger talks. I have no idea why this would affect VZ (and T), but they both fell at the same time that TMUS and S fell, so I guess Mr Market thinks they are related."
As long as Yahoo is a leftest bias org with fake news this stock is not going up........
"266,000 new jobs. Many of them will enable people to buy a Verizon wireless plan, or upgrade. Couple that with a reduced corporate tax rate. And yet Verizon hates the president, and most hard working Americans, and tries to help move him out. I can't wait for 5 years, when we get a socialist Prez, and verizon gets nationalized by a socialist government led by Elizabeth Warren, and all their shares are worthless overnight. Sometimes I wish it would happen tomorrow, so those helping ruin our country would suffer now."
Fire Lowell and his cronies!
"Hey longs - did you know that VZ is now offering a new home internet service (and device)?No, I'm not talking the 5G Home product that simply isn't available in most rural areas (heck, in most larger cities). It's a box that the customer has to purchase that will provide whole house 4G LTE. A likely bridge product/service until the 5G product is more readily available.Very new, and I just ordered it two days ago. I've been DYING with home internet for the last 5.5 years (using hotspots, and phones as hotspots) and now, working from home so much, I'm never able to make it to the end of the cycle without having burned through 45GB of high speed data. After than, it's off to another site where ""real"" internet is available. We are very excited about this new service and will start it ASAP. It's $50/month where I'm at, and unlimited high speed data to boot (no caps)."
Verizon filed an 8K today noting a material impact issue to their financials. The stock went up today. Your thoughts? I am holding off buying anything.
"Opinions vary about the Yahoo! add, VZ is up premarket however which is the name of the game."
Verizon CEO removed message boards on non-financial matters. Another way liberal press is stopping freedom of speech and cramming their fake news down everyone’s throat! Ownership in media giants should be limited to 2% to save democracy in US!
Looks like it's all computer trading vz and following market moves.
Trash!!
"Look at that T up and Green like a real American company, VZ down and RED like the communist company they have become CENSORING Americans"
Hey Coco we are at that price point again- 61+ and 69 is in the cards.
"VZ going to go DOWN and RED like the communist company VZ has become LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Yes, $39 million as a retirement clause is oh so cheap. I feel so cheap even saying it."
Second ER in a row that VZ reports decent results and the stock gets robbed out of gains.
wht is thier div and stock buyback policy? do they have plans to increase payout anytime soon?
VZ is catching up with idiots from Microsoft. What a waste of shareholders money.
Yahoo Fined for DATA Breach and VZ to pay the finesMy private info is on the dark web thanks to VerizonLooking for the class action I have an issue Don't think your brand new disclaimers apply
Today's day chart looks like Aug-Oct 2018 3month chart squeezed into 6 1/2hrs.Talk about a yo-yo...
(Kpiff) VZ needs to beat the rest to buy EDGEWATER wireless REAL SOON
"Mario Gabelli says his taxes should go up. if you feel guilty, all of you who are the perfect examples of social injustice, you can easily write out a check to the US Treasury. Another form of social injustice, is when a wealthy person hires a wealthy accountant, to avoid paying taxes, that would be used to feed the poor. STop mouthing your fake empathy."
Con job on the public by VZ
Anyone think the preorders starting tomorrow will raise the sp above 60?
VZ has considerable short appeal.
"There is not much blue sky left for VZ, folks. You need to go to T if you want a higher upside and higher divvy in these turbulent market times. Just common sense."
Vz is safe and stable.
VZ - shut down your yahoo junk and put some real news on the internet
"Verizon Communications Inc gained 0.92% in the last trading day, rising from $52.01 to $52.49 , and has now gained 4 days in a row. It will be exciting to see whether it manages to continue gaining or take a minor break for the next few days. The price has been going up and down for this period, and there has been a 1.74% gain for the last 2 weeks. Volume has increased in the last day along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in total, 2.45 million more shares were traded than the day before. In total, 16.52 million shares bought and sold for approximately $867.22 million.TrendVerizon Communications Inc lies in the upper part of a weak rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good selling opportunity for the short-term trader as reaction back towards the lower part of the trend can be expected. A break-up at the top trend line at $52.56 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 9.42% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $54.42 and $57.51 at the end of this period."
"I think this is what you're going to see with all of the major carriers: https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324345/verizon-c-band-5g-unlimited-plans Can't say I blame them. They just spent the wazoo on spectrum (and with another auction looming just around the corner...), so they have to monetize it quickly. Verizon has multiple fronts to monetize its investment. High end 5G customers will be the easiest. 5G IoT will follow (go to Rockwell's website and learn more about it https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/company/news/magazines/-key-factors-for-cellular-wireless-remote-access.html).So if you are one of those ""prepaid"" customers, get ready to live in the world of ssssllllllloooooowwwwww internet. Even if you're a ""postpaid"" customer, unless you're paying for the top plans and include some form of streaming (i.e., Disney+, Discovery+, etc.) you'll also be stuck in the world of what I call ""4.5G"" where you never know what your download speed will be. This will be true if you're with Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile (although I suspect T Mobile will have an advantage for about 1-2 years).Can't wait to see what's spent on the next auction..."
Can anyone tell us what (in miles) the range of 5G will be ??(I rest my case :-)
"T has made the changes to have a very bright future with T's 5G monster. Just wait until earnings and we get the HBO MAX numbers WOW the future for T is so bright you have to wear shades. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Has anyone linked Yahoo to their brokerage accounts?
"Vz sells the Moto z4 and it is pure junk, if you buy it , you are buying trouble.The Moto Z4 has a bad hard drive which makes the phone go black as soon as you dial a number, the problem is intermittent and will drive you nuts, the cause is a bad proximity sensor. Their phone techs aren't aware of it and argued that I wasn't using it properly. I'm a 40 year user of Verizon and very disappointed in the way they treated me."
What a disappointing performance today on a market up-day.
The 2 $ gain vanished like camphor
going to change the world soon
"Stock down today because US10Y crossed 3% mark again. If T is yielding 6+ %, there's no reason why VZ should yield at 4.6%.I'd say it's BUY at $40/share NOT because VZ is poorly run, but because the Fed is beating it down and will continue to do so."
cup and handle pattern
"long-term buy Verizon got high dividend and stock rise, 5G sure be bring more business for Verizon, the monthlyfee of wireless have been bottom, because Sprint and T-Mobile don't have able to cut price, their profit margin too low, they make a little money, they don't have enough money to build 5G, Verizon will be get more customers from them., Verizon signals are lot more better than anyone, SO Verizon will be winner, this best time buy m"
Verizon is a rip off. Verizon will be out of business once Google Fi takes off and t mobile gaining traction. This garbage company needs to be shut down.
Look for a buy rating from a major brokerage house next week. Hedgies shaking the tree meanwhile......business as usual on Wall street
"Crazy Bullish Verizon, Green when market is down more than 300 PTs. Time to make a move toward $60s and test $80$90 minimum by end of 2021."
"VZ is a waste of a company stock, some much Resistance to going up and holding,, 55 is too tough for it to get through,,just like T cant hold 30"
why people say when market fall this stock rise
"1 year share price performance 2.8%, omg, pathetic. Even with 4% dividend this thing is a coma stock, does nothing...so much for 5G"
"VZ is a dangerous stock to short. It has a huge standard base of stockholders that aren't going anywhere, a great divi that is solid and even if they make a number of poor decisions this stock maybe drops to the low 40's. While 60 is definitely in the cards if the economy does not go into recession over the next 2 years. Long and lovin' VZ."
RSI in single digits today
earnings next week ?
Down due to profit taking from yesterday's run up and in sympathy with T's bad numbers.
"Usual hatchet job from YF I notice. How they twist the headline (to look negative) on a story which is actually saying Zack's considers VZ a buy. Usual nonsense, before the stock bounces the day before it goes ex, and it will. Ka-Ching!"
Verizon is to blame for the majority of YAHOO articles coming from the NY POST. A Fox News division of News Corp. A DISGUSTING RAG.
"Berkshire Hathaway just bought a big stake in Verizon !! And Chevron, just saw on cnbc"
That's the VZ we know and don't love. Little runup and then hit the brakes and go backwards.
"MAY 1ST, 2016 - VERIZON HEALTH INSURANCE EXPIRED FOR UNION SLOBS!. NO HEALTH COVERAGE FOR YOU - you lazy malingering jack offs! You're days of ripping Americaoff with your lazy work habits and insane demands are coming to a close. You can't go to the hospital now.You are worse off than a welfare medicaid recipient. Enjoy your new found status as an American loser.Verizon Union Slobs - you deserve all the economic and spiritual degradation that you can handle!"
"I'm so glad that I sold this #$%$ Yahoo is killing Verizon, and AT&T is a far superior investment opportunity."
"Smart business move for Verizon to sell the HuffPost to some billionaire who wants to personally control a progressive rag. Raises cash for Verizon, ends the expense of Huff Post losses for Verizon and keeps Verizon uninvolved with progressive witch hunts."
In reality---VZ did pretty damn good in this environment!!!!!!
"Even the market can't help VZ, finished barely up. Joke stock."
Love this stock
VZ will have to deal with Ergen at some point
ALL TIME HIGH
"Yahoo shows biden in such a lead, nothing but great news for Biden, nothing but bad news for Trump... hmm I wonder who the execs are voting for!? On another note all you have to do to make that poll lean one way or another is use a different browser each time to vote. Get a stack of laptops with browsers loaded and vote away, no need to log in or anything. And this is to influence American voters!"
this company is awful. i have been without service at my bussiness for 3 days. customer service is the worst i have ever dealt with. unacceptable verizon management.
its Wednesday do you know where Coco is?
Ka-Ching!
what the heck is going on with piece of s.. I buy in n right away it starts going down. a lot
VZ always misses the $40's and it has to come back.
buy in the mid to low 40s
Outlook for Vz Stock is weak again today
4% interest rate. Sell it for sp of 75 in 3 years. After enjoying 3 years of 4% interest
VZ does not need a bail-out. Either pay the bill or ur phone gets cut off.
absolutely over -valued
Why can’t VZ stay over $60?
Does anyone know when the Straight Path acquisition will be completed?
Comcast wants VZ for $60 a share
"It just took Yahoo less than five minutes to pull my last comment. They are working overtime to cover up the truth. My original comment was:""Most of the politically motivated articles on Yahoo are not ""news""; they are opinions that either distort or are not supported by real facts. Dropping the comments section was to prevent Yahoo from being called out for their obvious far-left agenda. Disgraceful. If I was a Yahoo employee I would be ashamed of the company's behavior. Their Ethics & Compliance Officer (if that position has not already been eliminated) is either incompetent, corrupt, or actively looking for a new job. Lets see how long this post lasts before Yahoo censors it ... which will simply reflect the validity of my comment.""Obviously, Yahoo has a clear political agenda and willingly prevents free speech not in line with that agenda. Disgraceful and corrupt."
VZ and yahoo are leftist propagandists.
"Good evening donkey breaths....it is me.....Baghdad Bob.....and once again, you Verizon shills are not dealing in reality.....your Verizon FIOS is by definition “cable”, yet you lie that it is not.....you ingrown hair on the toe of a camel......that is all....."
lower lower lower===========VOMIT
Read the wall street journal this morning for a change. Amazingly better content than anything from yahoo.
What a laugh...VZ upgraded and it a dud now
What is up with the swings today?
Verizon(VZ)https://www.eetimes.com/fcc-3-5ghz-auction-opens-new-routes-to-5g/
so much for 5g.... VZ is a dead investment
Thousands of people heading to our border already. Joe has to keep all his promises and bankrupt this country.
Momentum Money rotating into TMUS for a temp. TRADE....This is a BUYing opp. for VZ longterm.....
I think a test of $55 is coming up in the next month or two.
hello crybabies.I told you numerous times to sell Verizon and Buy AT&T. Did you listen? NO.
"Warren owning so much VZ it just means Warren made an even BIGGER Mistake , That he now has to fix as he sells any move higher"
It's a tough call....multi $Billion investor with impressive 40 yr track record with R&D team doing extensive analytics vs ....message board handle name / vman .
I hate Verizon as much as the nfl
everybody on here keeps saying the dividend the dividend. you've lost two years worth of dividends in the last month.

Back to $60

"CEO giving 155,000 employees 50 shares of restricted stock on Feb 1.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/verizon-vz-earnings-ceo-lowell-mcadam-interview.html"
"Despite putting record numbers of Latinos and Blacks to work, yahoo finance, courtesy of Verizon, makes fun of the President.Apparently putting people who had no chance of getting a job for years is not a priority for Verizon. And you still own shares of this despicable company."
ATT crushing it. Verizon being crushed. ATT rolling out HBO MAX....the true heir to Netflix. Verizonsaddled with pathetic Yahoo and AOL!
VZ heading to 50 by the end of the week
Why does anyone own this stock? It is going nowhere.
"Wow, so much for this being a defensive stock. Ouch!!!"
What's true about the rumours $VZ is gathering info on a possible $TWTR buyout?
What if VZ gets fined for Yahoo lawsuits like Google for 2.7 billion ????? for scanning emails........
Hans will be proven to have been a mistake !
"I dropped Verizon. I found them arrogant and the service inadequate. Whenever I talked to Verizon reps they all seemed condescending and dismissive of other telecom companies. Hey, look in the mirror. YOU guys have been a real pain in the rear end. I am going to where I'm needed. Goodbye Verizon."
is vz a buy hold or sell? thoughts anyone
Looks like AT&T is going out of business. That could be very good for Verizon. :-)
"Wall Street is dumping VZ as Cramer pumps it and they are buying up T shares as Cramer bashes T. LOL, LOL,LOL You just can't make this stuff up . LOL,LOL,LOL"
GS said on Monday that this was one of their top 20 picks to buy before earnings report! Any thoughts?
Verizon will be at $55 soon. Very strong.
I hope this doesn't mean bad things next week!
Vz stock is as hard as rock :)
I hope they fix the mess called yahoo
Puke vz/yahoo is nothing but biased demo-garbage hacks.
"Definitely look like VZ is heading to $40s, will not touch this falling knife until then. Outlook too Bearish with AT$T and Tmobile eating VZ's meal for lunch."
"The only actually liberal aspect of yahoo was in fact the chat boards. Now without them, yahoo is just an irrelevant commie propaganda mouthpiece."
Run to the light sheep run. Your communist daddy says he’s in the stock. Just makes me laugh every time.
Beat on top line. Beat on bottom line. Steady dividend. 5G growth acceleration.
uhh they just closed 1000s of stores according to someone who works there. he says they plan on knocking back spending in the billions?
"wow, 50 shares of stock!!! we're rich. You dumb mgrs.. you think 50 shares is going to motivate most workers beyond their current production? I interviewed at a chemical firm and the dopey VP in charge of the place said I'd get 100 shares of stock options. Whooppppie. In my last firm, I had well over 75,000 in a start up. 50 or 100 isn't squat. How about rethinking the gift and then add some zeros after the 5."
"VZ the company now without a future LOL,LOL,LOL"
This junk of a stock will be range bound for life.Ping pong between 47 and 49.
"Verizon has the financial strength to increase their payout much more than others. With 10,000 Baby Boomers retiring Every Day in the US over the next 8 years......they seek income and income growth. Verizon is perfect for them."
"Anyone that purchased shares of VZ without thinking because Taking away people First Amendment right is a major deal and you will lose money , because you never ever invest in any company that takes any over your rights away from you no matter what that company thinks they can do."
This stock is a POS. Dropping just before ex-div date
"anyone hear the conspiracy that 5G is causing these lung issues and the ""virus"" is a cover for it? Wuhan is an early 5G site, so are cruise ships."
Vote China Joe Bribing Biden.Ukraine has arrest warrants for the Biden clan that bribed kickbacks from U.S. tax payer aide money.AOC and the ISIS wives run the DNC.
"Market up almost 300 pts, this trash dares to go Red, Helpless sinking ship."
It’s now at break out over 5 year highs.
All I Can Say Is WOW....At Least ATT Is Holding Up A Lot Better..
Down again on a big up day in the market. Wow!! Guess a test of lows coming this week.
$61.00 to $55.00 ????????????????????????????????????
A TMobile-Sprint merger would be hugely positive for T & VZ. No more suicidal price wars over subs & the cable companies would continue to lose share. 5G will be the inflection point for video-capable broadband. No need for local wifi.
I strongly suggest all users cancel all VZ wireless and FiOS accounts...All they do is censor and cancel accounts...Because anyone would have the audacity to say something truthful about the DNC and Biden
"Relax, it is people just rotating from defensive names trying to make a quick buck. AEP is down as well, and T isn't up hardly at all. I think I will buy some more VZ. Didn't think it would break 50"
Many many more will telecommute. I like VZ
$CRM uses Slack$VZ uses Slack$IBM uses slack
don't worry Verizon shareholders. there is a light at the end of the tunnel. and it's a train. LOL. LOL. LOL.
"I'm not expecting much of a Santa Claus rally this year. Not with Trumpy the Clown screwing up the economy and our relations with the rest of the world. I think next year, beginning around the end of February, things really tank. Obama looks very good to me right now."
"Verizon, via yahoo news, now running a story on how hard it is to prove abuse from border agents. Verizon, whay aren't you telling us how many people are killed and robbed from people who should not be here.its supposed to be safe for us, US citizens, not for bad people wanting to come here and do harm.my only hope is, these bad guys come after Verizon management, and shareholders, the people who are helping them in."
Why do you investors stick with this company when you can buy into #VZ without constant drama?
great value at 55 and 5g king buying down will be up in no time. guess who most folks pay disney streaming through? Verizon. 
Hans fired from Erickson due to corruption. Who hired this guy with Verizon? Stock tanking since he came on board. What a clown. All he talks about is 5G.
"I am not a short but just saying guys we all know 5g causes radiation, why support a company that will cause u cancer, eventually cities will ban this after already we have many reports of school children getting radiation exposure....a city in California already banned 5g towers......please guys do me a favor and vote in shareholder meetings to stop 5g towers.......it’s about life saftey not money....."
Vz. This is where you want to be right now. Always my safety position.
Good to see the big move today.
55.47 +1.32 (2.44%)After hours: 4:14PM EST
"Going to be interesting, will VZ repeat the pattern or continue higher ????I think we go higher."
"Not to happy about VZ apparently going communist and making asinine political statements in leu of focusing on conducting their business. Person in sighting politics into this business should be immediately fired. If not, I will be moving out to more American company with values."
selling my S shared and buying VZ today
"I can hear the whiners NOW, get your order in!$55s, worth $60 blah blah blahtime to add"
Foolish to believe vz would hold 50
Let's hope its goes up !
The market is not satutated considering the near future requires all vehicles and electronis to be online.
"How about that. Verizon gives its full time employees 50 shares, worth around $2,500. That's nice. Too bad its only a one time thing, and the tax breaks last forever. Verizon employees, go look at working for Walmart, where they bend over backwards, like making your own work schedule, to make you happy."
IS IT OK TO STRIKE A VERIZON STRIKER WITH A BASEBALL BAT?. That's the question most shareholder's are asking themselves (rhetorically) this weekend.
"Yahoo is shutting down Yahoo Groups in December. Yet another failure with the media division. You couldn't figure out how to monetize it. So now it's shutting down. Once they start losing money on their finance boards, that will be the nail in the coffin. What a joke. Let it go, Verizon, let it go already..."
"LOL, LOL, LOL you are going to wish you would have sold everything once the stimulus does not pass . LOL,LOL got to love Wall Street they only short a sure thing , So for sure the Stimulus id not going to pass in the senate LOL must be bought and paid Just like when Nancy Pelosi was in 2008 LOL,LOL,LOL"
Verizon may be considering rehiring retirees to deal with installation backlogs. Positions will include hazard pay.
Yahoo Finance consumes 100% of my desktop CPU time whether using Firefox or Safari. No other webpage comes near that. Response time to every keystroke is glacial. What's going on?
"We're certainly under siege right now. But like every crisis, VZ will prevail. No other company has a more loyal shareholder core. WE WILL NEVER SELL. At the end of the day that's all that matters"
The market has been screaming and VZ keeps taking a S___T everyday.
"Did you hear Wall Street is taking a $, H, ,I , T and dumping VZ shares LOL,LOL because they are now losing customer to the great T monster LOL,LOL As Wall Street is now buying T because the future is so bright you will need to wear shades LOL,LOL you don't even need to make this stuff up LOL Cramer pinching a loaf and out falls VZ into the toilet LOL,LOL,LOL watching VZ Swirling Down The Toilet. LOL,LOL along with all your money Spartan 55 LOL,LOL,LOL"
How are you folks feeling about holding this through earnings?
"Verizon doesn't want US citizens to enjoy the tax cuts. Seriously, this is the kind of company you own stock in ? Just think if they spent that money hiring quality sales people, or quality management. Hey, if we go to socialism, look in the mirror my friend. Your investment in Verizon is helping us make that transition one step at a time."
Anyone think this stock could hit 65 next year?
"Mute anyone who come to this board, touts another stock and tells you that you're dumb for investing/trading VZ."
VZ - Please fix Yahoo. It is spreading complete junk about politics. You should maintain a neutral position on politics.
sell sell everything at these massive new highs
"every penny counts, buy and hold"
If I could only make enough money off this stock to pay my Verizon bill every month that’d be the ticket
What stupid markets . Just day trading games. We are due for one massive sell off of thousands of points here. All games greed etc.
 show it only can go up according to the data graph trend. i really hope so!!$
Vz will run up to 60 while garbage stocks dip
Since VZ bought Yahoo the Yahoo Finance site has gone to total S&(*\T. I need to go to some other site just to get a lousy balance sheet now. What a nickel and dime company the once great VZ is
U missed last weeks great sale at 53
Yahoo Finance is a liberal propaganda site. Am deleting my account. Goodbye.
"Stevie, were not your therapist find one on your own, you call call one using verizon. Good luck"
A trend like bankruptcy
Games games and more games.
"November 2018 VZ climbed to above $60 and then back down, 4% yield key.$60.25 = 4%Will be difficult to climb beyond that point and traders will get out and buy back lower."
Why does verizon allow yahoo finance to put sexist pictures for ads on their sites ?And verizon says they are progressive and honor womens rights.
VZ down T up
Verizon was smart to get involved with MoviePass(HMNY) which is the future of the entertainment field.
30/100 more value next year when verizon will lead 5 g. Will reach $80 in 2019.
@R I am a T bagger buyer at $25. Anything else you want to say bagger?
The heavy hitters use vz as a bond proxy. They trade the volatile stocks actively but find little reason to buy up what they consider $ in wait with a bond like yield and reasonable safety.
buying more at 30
"Uh oh, new price war and ad attacks coming. T-Mobile starting to eat VZ's lunch. There goes that FAT dividend before this is over.marco the super genius : - ))))) Time to grab profits, that is, if Yinz have em."
does anyone use a different app that is good then this yahoo finance? Yahoo seems to be getting worse and worse. thanks
Last Day to purchase to catch the QTR dividend. Good Luck All.
People will begin migrating to Verizon from AT&T as 5g rolls out. Verizon has a competitive advantage. :-)
At least VZ and T seem to have hit bids in the $48 & $37 marks. Q1 est is $1.11 Operating EPS from $.95 YoY which hs help from lower taxes. Revenue est is looking good at $31.25b up from $29.8 YoY. Higher revenue on a lower tax rate should be a tailwind against Fed ST rate hikes.
New high in the 61 area if taken out see you at 69 the all time high
100 shares of RAD won't break you nor will you regret.
"Verizon/Yahoo you are pukes all the way to even your horoscope garbage tailored to demo-liberal-blab. You #$%$ couldn't be a more biased ""news"" outlet."
Up up and away! Disney partnership is brilliant
Wall Street sell zone = retail buy zone
"I bought T & VZ both in March 2009 T@$24 VZ@&28 You're welcome jeh, rf and rest of your numb-skull crowd - NOW leave me the HELL alone and y'all continue spooning each other, and nibbling on each others ears .... you msg-board spamming ""perverts"" :~)"
"In UGAZ @ 9.89, good luck all!"
WHERE IS COCO--- that 61 area if taken out means new high
"nice divi, great value with increased growth."
Why is this struggling?
"Based upon the light volume, no news and the almost 500,000 share dump on the open my guess is some mutual fund had to liquidate for a margin call and VZ was their only profitable position. Anyone have a better idea i am open to suggestions."
Yahoo is now down to less than 1% of former readership. Time to get the plunger.
I was not expecting to be able to buy VZ below $60. Limited downside with a nice dividend!!!
"My dad is giving me 10k to invest for him. I like this company, and want to put a good portion into this. Is this a good time to get in? Earnings coming up predicted to beat however market down and election. Just wondering what your thoughts were for you longs when to jump into this? I will be long also once purchased. Thank you in advance."

"I keep hearing all the hype about T-Mobile but here a couple tidbits and people need to do their dd?1-VZ has 4B shares outstanding and makes $3 a share,TMUS has 830M shares outstanding and makes $1.91 a share! TMUS has a way to go to become VZ?2- TMUS CEO John Legere and Global Crossing.period,he has a dubious past and is a snake oil salesman,be careful following the hype and he will sell his mother to make a buck?jmoThat man cost everyone money years ago and a leopard doesnt change his spots?"
I cant stand it when a company crushes earnings and the stock drops....unbelievable
"Hopefully the T mess is over for now ,, until TWX announcement. Pre-Market 50.10 again. .. Good luck to all VZ longs. Or as shorts say ""bag holder heaven for me!"""
OMG - is this PIG going to finally have a day in the green - unbelievable - it only took a massive up day in the market to get a measly 1/2 % up --WOW
"Look for VZ to have to warn about earnings as the customer loses to T mount over the next 2 months LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up , go to any VZ store and they are ghost towns of no new customers LOL,LOL,LOL and even no old customers LOL why the highest cost provider LOL,LOL,LOL"
VZ needs to dump yahoo and work on their reputation in the US telcom market. 10 year ago they were considered a diamond in the rough and image has changed to a piece of charcoal in the park.
Yahoo NATZI's out in full force deleting the truth they don't want you to know with their EU run VZ and their one world order. FK VZ move your cell service to T like everyone else is doing FACT
"Poor Jennifer is now going to lose all her money investing in VZ a company that can NOT be trusted to protect your First Amendment rights and even breaks when as they CENSOR what you can see , read and post. If VZ CAN NOT be Trusted to protect your First Amendment rights then for sure VZ can NOT be TRUSTED to protect your data. FACT"
Why is VZ getting crushed today?!? They have zero exposure to China. Makes no sense.
"This one is going back up. You can't stop this train. Great Dividend...better close those short call positions, before you loose your shirt."

"5G is coming fast. Last week, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) wireless standards body agreed to accelerate some elements in the 5G new radio (NR) timeline. This means we’ll be able to launch standards-based mobile 5G services to consumers starting as early as late 2018. That’s a year ahead of the anticipated timeframe before this standards acceleration. 47 global operators and vendors have signed off on the new proposal.2018 won’t be a moment too soon. People are data hungry.About 137 petabytes of data traffic cross our network on an average business day. Data traffic on our mobile network has grown more than 250,000% since 2007. Video now makes up more than half of our mobile data traffic. In fact, video traffic grew over 75% and smartphones drove almost 75% of our data traffic in the last year alone.5G will be a critical part of staying ahead of that demand. While there are many elements to this new technology, the big news here is that you can expect to see the first standards-based mobile 5G services in 2 years or less. We’re excited to see what 5G means for augmented reality/virtual reality, video delivery, self-driving cars, healthcare and more. Read on to see how we’ll get there working with others in the industry.What does this accelerated timeline mean?The standards for 5G are complex, with many different parts. The conventional development approach has been for engineers to wait until the entire standard was complete before starting their final design work. Silicon chipset development has the longest development lead time in this field.The accelerated schedule includes a plan to complete key components of the 5G standards needed to start chipset development in December 2017. That’s 6 months ahead of the expected 3GPP full Release 15. These key components include the specifications for 5G NR along with the non-standalone option for the core network interface. The December 2017 standards milestone will unveil the first complete picture of a holistic 5G system, enabling hardware, chipset, and device manufacturers to start their development earlier. Operators, in turn, will be able to provide standards-based mobile 5G service sooner to customers, with many in the industry aiming for 2019.So is 4G LTE going away?No. The path to standards-based 5G initially uses the non-standalone option, which means 5G radios ride on the existing LTE network core. Non-standalone 5G adds new, advanced features onto an already solid set of equipment – LTE – to provide customers with faster speeds, lower latency and a better overall experience.Non-standalone vs Standalone 5G…What’s the difference?Non-standalone 5G co-exists with LTE. Standalone 5G uses a new network core that is separate from, but still interworks with, today’s LTE networks. This next-generation network core will add capabilities such as network function virtualization (NFV), software defined networking (SDN), and network slicing."
"Amazon buys TMUS + SPRINT wireless business,what is the impact to VZ and now TMUS + SPRINT are eliminated from wireless.TMUS/Sprint will be willing to spend billions to develop 5G?That just proves that VZ is doing the best thing for the future.Amazon may just want to 'give away' wireless to boost its retail business?I doubt it but they might do that.The people I know who use VZ are willing to pay more and do so for quality purposes.Amazon may start out giving wireless away like a coupon but that may change once they realize the costs associated with the wireless business.Amazon is out of their element."
Verizon 5g very successful in 4 rollouts.
Take notice...all you people being dividend Hounds....the stock has a lot of big sellers..what happened to the so called buffet effect...nothing it's finished...

SANP Bull Ride Up..
Fed Rate Hikes are now on hold. Trump has Europe reeling. All of the Baby Boomer stocks will rally big. Verizon is a Big Baby Boomer stock. You may see $60 as this unfolds.
double top
Just ask VZ how many numbers they had to port over to T this weekend WOW that was a really big number of customers VZ lost this weekend to T WOW
"I am changing my views and joining the buyers on this stock with the pullback today, it has fared well through the pandemic and still shows upside potential. The analysts seem to like it and it they are best of breed in the cell phone industry!"
Vz when every analyst hate you. I am still on your side. Don’t make me disappointed :)
Afternoon rally?
I simply cannot believe VZ would even remotely consider buying Yahoo. Yahoo is the most messed up company. What an insane mistake to make.
Back to negotiating table. Here is a 'pat on the head' to all the union Bozo`s and no-show jobs for the relatives of their elected union officials!
"Better learn to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
"if one wants to avoid a headache, look to the other stock VZ hasVZA, it's great on a dividend and doesn't move much."
I like T much more than VZ....I also like ExxonMobil much more than Chevron. Either way it's a positive for both sectors.
"Hanging on to a little green. Prior to the 2017 tax Reform Act, big telecoms paid an effective 33% in the old 35% rate regs. That's why 21% give VZ about a $4 B boost of free cash flow. Great timing to help whittle down the debt load. So whether or not you like it VZ is a Trump company -- I believe the dividend payout ratio is about 40% now. The dividend is very safe which is no doubt accounts for some and maybe close to all of the last $5 or so of appreciation. Earnings growth will hopefully keep the bid in for VZ."
This has got to be the most boring stock of all time
Predict $52.00 by next Friday
"Expect nothing less than $80 minimum by end of 2021, 5G expansion and growth just too strong and attractive for VZ."
Verizon has the most inept ignorant customer service of any company... to give them $700 a month for cell and fios... have a power surge fry your power supply to your fios and have them tell you there is a 6 day backlog for appointments is unacceptable... its a 20 minute fixThats $8400 a year from this customer they are flushing down the drain due to the worst customer service I have seen
"I sold this after holding for 6 years. It was close to its high, and after it bought yahoo, I was concerned because that was such a high priced piece of garbage. I see they wrote off 4 billion, and that was less than two years ago. Time to move on as I do not know what is buried in financials and new policy is selling anything I own on the onset of bad news...because usually more to come"
Not complaining! Just wondering
"Verizon...I notice that the vitriol in the Yahoo reporting has really picked up, coincidently with the REMOVAL of the ability to post on the Yahoo message boards. I'll tell you what, if that's what you want to do, the SHUT YAHOO DOWN and save us shareholders the expense (and liability) of that worthless division of yours. Thank you."
Why shouldn't SEC investigate this type of obvious irregularities?
"Wow, even an incredible market performance can't carry VZ beyond a mediocre gain. Talk about a BUM stock, this thing is toast. 2 yr performance will be flat as a flitter, even with 5G..."
"VZ is solid! earning hit a bump due to a focus on R&D, VZ heavily spends and pays SW companies to write codes specifically for them to support G5. This is a tech telcomm giant!"
Will close over 53
100 day MA crossing the 50 day MA.

Enough with Amazon. It is a monopoly. Didn't they break up the telecoms in the 80's because of that. Hum?
Why can’t this stock break $60???
dividends what a joke
DOWN OVER $2 !!!WOW ! What A Friggin Collapse..
it seems that the telecom market is concerned that it can't consolidate competition. but by 2018 vz will not have competition in 5g. they will be the only one with that immediate technology. so it seems to me the market is looking very short sided here
Yahoo is about to scuttle all the remaining chat boards. They are just too risky.
Look out below because FEd has played same old game like last 2008 collapse. Lowering interest below normal period. This has been the lowest rates of return ever. Wake up America the biggest scam ever. TRying to force everyone into stock market period. They need to be abolished /fired for market manipulation games for these massive below market rates. All this to take Wall Street higher to get more tax revenue etc. Europe has played same game but worse with negative rates. This is why the people need to rebel contact congressional reps etc. Put an end to these massive schemes once again.
VZ is another liberal bastion of hate and censorship. Hope this goes to zero.
The reason the stock is down is the street wants them to buy content like T is doing as the street thinks this is the right direction and not the direction Verizon is taking. Simple as that.
"There has to be another reason why yahoo finance fights the President. In addition to verizon wanting cheap labor coming across the border to staff their customer service lines, and keep the wages of low educated Blacks low, they must have been promised some deal on phones and services under socialism. Poor verizon. They think their company will remain intact after the revolution. But the planners know they can't trust the companies helping them, since they are now betraying us, the planners know they'll likely try to betray the new government as well. The planners are using the snakes like twtr, fb, and msft, t and vz, but they will not keep their agreements after the take over, thats a given."
whats everyones take why VZ is so weak today again
Quick note. Looks like Aug. options rolling over to Sept. I don’t see any hedging prior to earnings yet but I will be rolling over as well to Sept $52.50 to $55 call options. Long and strong on VZ.
c'mon 8:30!
"He, she , or it , was critical of someone’s use of to instead of too, meaning anything that person said don’t count cause of stinking GRAMMAR YET HE , she , or it misspelled Obama on purpose lol "
VZ has more to fall before it evens out. It's market cap relative to ATT's assets and future proofing make ZERO sense. The days of funds hiding here waiting on the Trade talks is gone and this will be back where it belongs in high 40s at best.
verizon looks like a good solid investment on 5g.
"CEO Hans is progressive, he loves taking ad revenue where the ads have half naked women."
"So let's take a look at the wireless market. Sprint was horrible and is now owned but T-mobile. But T-mobile was Horrible before Sprint was, so now you have two horrible companies merged together. Nice! AT&T is a joke and nobody remembers that they filed bankruptcy several years ago and cost all their investors billions of dollars, plus their cell reception is #$%$ and about the same as T-Mobile! Now you look at Verizon, with a huge network and reliable connections, the Leader in 5-G, Great Profits Year after Year and a Great dividend! By far Verizon is the elite carrier in the US and continues to provide great service.. I'm just stating the facts. So who's stock do you want to own?"
Trading range today only between 54.48 - 55.27. $.79
"Say, yellow shirt traitor, can you hear VZ now?"
Mired in mud.
what a horrible investment
"Am I the only one who thinks it's time to let Verizon know how biased, how tolerant of racists and trumtards, how unAmerican yahoo censorship is."
People have finally stopped complaining about the Airlines but complaints for VZ are UP!They don't care!
"Yep, redder as the day went on. Talk about a bum stock..."
"VZ will be $65 + before the 4th qtr.starts oct, 1st, because of yield, 5g and the ceo is too good, then ex div. in early oct., this current price won't last the week"
waste of money
"VZ EARNINGS report shows: VZ $40 /mo plan can kill TMUS, t and s , SO strong buy VZ, VZ can continue rise to $60 per share, VZ EARNINGS very good, plus 5G networks coming soon,"
"Anyone think VZ is undervalued here? 12 P/E and premier carrier for 5g tech that drives industry leading performance in the U.S.? If you are getting a new 5g iphone, you will want VZ as your carrier especially once they have their coverage all across this US (will take years to strategically prioritize and deploy that though)."
VZ is up 4.94% to 53.51

"VERIZON HAS BROKEN THE SPIRIT OF THE UNION SKUM. Americans are proud of Verizon as it took away the health insurance from the Union Skum on May 1st. Now entire families of Union Slime are at war amongst themselves. Families are literally breaking apart under the pressure from Verizon. The Union is being badly beaten. Most Verizon Union members deeply regret going on strike and don't want to even be a member of the stinkin' Union anymore. But, it's too late for them to come to their senses. Verizon has just about Blown the Union to Smithereens. It's over. The Union has lost."
Does This Mean VZ Will Fix Yahoo's Broken Web Site?VZ was ripped off on this deal. Yahoo is virtually worthless and unable to keep pace with software updates........Marisa Meyers screwed VZ good!
"wow,,, VZ down in a huge up market,, i guess VZ is not a good stock anymore , and the company could be finished after all this #$%$ of Corona,,because what reason is the selling in the big up market today"
"Quick question: Within the next year or so, 5G should be a thing in the US and as a result the telecommunication companies should be on top for a while (I hope). My question is, which of these two dividend rich companies do you all will come out on top, Verizon or AT&T? I plan on beginning my journey into the stock market sometime this year and would like to invest in either company (or maybe both, who knows) and would like some input on what you all think?Also, should I wait for earnings reports before getting into everything or should I just start ASAP?"
Why is everything green except this?
Jerry you are funny thou.
"Buffett bought big into KraftHeinz, too He made millions. He also loaned them something like $11M-$16M at 11% interest to finance the deal. Now look at Kraft. A disaster for shareholders but Buffett made bank."
when are you going to bring back the comments on yahoo? what are you afraid of the truth?
"Get into down US stocks before china deal. DOW 30,000. Then sell and buy vz (probably near $49 by then)."
huff post and yahoo are liberal trash. Once Biden is in and readers dry up they are Chap 11.
"Going digital folks!Oath to capture 11.5% of digital ad spendingIn the first half of 2018, Verizon (VZ) made several moves aimed at enabling it to lead the 5G (fifth-generation) network rollout race, boost customer trust and retention, and expand in the digital media and advertising market.In June, the company appointed Hans Vestberg as its next CEO, who will steer it in the digital world. Outgoing CEO Lowell McAdam led Verizon in purchasing AOL and Yahoo, culminating in the company launching a media and advertising division known as Oath.￼According to eMarketer, Oath is poised to capture 11.5% of US digital advertising dollars in 2018. Amazon (AMZN), Twitter (TWTR), and Snapchat (SNAP) are expected to capture 7.3%, 3.6%, and 3.7% of US digital advertising budgets in 2018, respectively.Verizon is focused on 5G and digital contentAlthough we’ve seen Verizon buy media assets, and it was said to be one of the companies that showed interest in buying 21st Century Fox’s (FOX) (FOXA) operations, the company recently said that it had no interest in becoming a traditional media company. Instead, Verizon wants to focus on building a 5G network and investing in digital content.Building customer trustBeyond investing in a stronger network and more digital content, Verizon is also investing in building customer trust in its services, which could help it in boosting customer retention. As part of its efforts to build customer trust, Verizon recently moved to stop selling its customers’ location data to third parties. Its rivals AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Sprint (S) followed suit, restricting third-party access to their customers’ data."
"Rising with good volume. Moving averages are rising, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 61.58 for a run up to 71.93."
"Verizon, you should calm your little Yahoo down when it comes to driving hate & lies against our President. Are you pushing to start a war in this country? I am tired of the leftest hatred against our President. Keep pushing it....."
Bad judgement offering to buy Yahoo. What was management thinking?

"the press is mad that the security guard at the school did nothing. yet had he killed the shooter, the AP, and left, would have been angry about that. They would have asked ""did they really have to shoot him ?"" For you see, the left will never be happy about anything. And Verizon, with yahoo news and finance, is helping to push their agenda."
I put up a post about Verizon and it was pulled within an hour. Censorship is alive and well in America.
Verizon is so oversold it’s enough to make you vomit. :-)
"i am not buying the excuse this virus is causing this mass selloff, this is all the democrats donors shorting everything they can and all they have to do is short the SPY, DOW, and the market has to drop, so they can control the next election and it could work since we have lost our retirement to these #$%$, so hold all your long positions,, its been very painful but think about the timing they used, February to smash all markets, I do not believe the BS ,, i smell a rat and Trump is a democrat, i think he wants to get out and let his buddies run the world now as he made billions"
The good times don't last long with this stock do they?
It might go high 60s today on heavy volume!
Why the AH pop ?
lets go 52 or closed at 51.90
heard that verizon will be laying off wireless employees this week. Is this correct?
If it can hold 45 today? We have a chance to reach 50 by christmas.... What do you guys think?
"Omg, talk about a bum stock. VZ is going nowhere but down. To think people really thought 5G was going to cause it to bump, hilarious."
Buffet knew what he was doing! Verizon will be the Google of the Cell and Wireless world!
"The company's shares are trading at just 13 times Verizon's forward earnings, well below the tech industry average."
where is my buddy Coco- I know he bought ATT yesterday!!!!!
Is the dividend safe?
"Ye of little faith, as well as those with a grudge against Big Red, VZ is the bond equivalent of your dreams. I'm from Chicago where there used to be a number of famous pool halls where the famous played. The common view was that it's better to own the pool hall then be a hustler. VZ is #1 in 4G and is leading the way into 5G. You know AAPL and Samsung are going to release 5G capable phones ASAP. Stay tuned...3M is cutting its forecast...VZ is going to see a bid as Q3 was no fluke."

NO HEALTH INSURANCE will help themlive shorter more brutish lives that will show them the error of their misguided ways. If you're taking advantage of other Americans (as these Union Slime Balls are) then, you deserve the degradation and humiliation that goes with it. AMERICA WILL BE VICTORIOUS OVER THE VERIZON UNION SLOBBOS!"
Here we go high of the day
Must have been some trading error. Somebody added an extra zero or two on a sell order.
Alright I’m in!! Started a small position @54.50
Vote Bernie in and finish all the deep depression
going down to 35.00
Verizon is looking nice and hot!
"Hey VZ got back the upcoming $.6150 payout back. We saw her bend way down to $49 at the big crono-dip back in March. I read some comments a while back about VZ not having any 5G pricing power that I don't believe matters. The focus on city centers is going to pay off because 5G is going to create demand for services that have never existed like Smart/Safe City tech like smart digital cameras & alarms to record and deter crime. All the big blue Democratic sanctuary cities will buy plenty, assuming the Fed subsidy payments come thru. That has to be part of any new infrastructure spending. Don't forget that's how they connected Jucy in Chgo to the big bros with the red hats. Coordinated 5G (bullet resistant) equipment will be valuable. Big new revenue streams coming from demand created by the tech and VZ's infrastructure."
"Verizon results confirm that the mobile sector is maturing with growth in subscribers being moderated by top line sales and margin pressure. The mobile segment often is in the headlines: ""Extreme competition crushing mobile operator XYZ"". That advertising hyping type of headlines is far from the relatively boring fact that the mobile business remains very strong and profitable. There is no major threat from entry by cable, satellite or other entrants and the competition from the number 3 and 4 serves to push the industry into line rather than as derailing the prevailing trends. Nothing is rocking the boat to near the degree some writers use to sell ad space.Why the big pop higher? Because expectations have been impacted by the bleak hype of those selling analyst reports and articles/advertising space. There is no question that the mobile space has become more mature so that growth is harder to come by and margins are subject to pressure. However, technology and more spectrum that has already been accounted for paves the way to achieve higher performance for less new capital commitments, resulting in margin expansion that offsets the offering of higher bandwidths/unlimited service plans and other service enhancements. And churn rates have trended lower over the years. Subscribers are 99% sticking with their current providers. Seen from that perspective, mobile service looks extremely stable as opposed to being threatened by 'extreme competition'. The pop in VZ reflects relief that the fear mongers were largely wrong."
Why did VZ buy Yahoo and stop support? Yahoo Group functions not working and there is no long support. If VZ was not going to support it why did they not let someone else buy it?
"Based in New York City, Verizon has global operations, with more than 200 data centers in 24 countries."
VZ IS DIRT CHEAP !!! 4.3% DIVIDEND YIELD __ BANK ON IT !
"Verizon still has yahoo finance pushing Trumponomics. We all know he created the best economy in the world.Yet Verizon still loathes him. He is forcing V to find a reputable 5g supplier, and he is doing his best at ridding our country of social injustice. Its companies like V, that don't want to pay many of their employees a living wage that is unjust. Perhaps we should talk about Verizon using low cost labor to lay fiber optic lines, and answer phone lines during the shareholders meeting. Social injustice starts with companies like V that exploit workers. I encourage organizations like Black Lives Matters to ask verizon why they would rather bring in low cost immigrants to work, than pay low tier workers a decent wage. BLM should set up a command postin front of every verizon building."
lots of red today...vz hanging in there
Market soars to new highs and Verizon keeps sinking. Time to examine how much the CEO et al are getting paid for lack of performance.
When will Verizon integrate Blockchain technology into the fiber and wireless network ?
"I was just shocked to learn that a great company like Verizon owns Yahoo. The way Yahoo manipulates, bullies and restricts the users I thought it had been bought by communist China. Come on Verizon do something about the control of free speech over at Yahoo, before the FCC has to step in."

"Has Yahoo/VZ turned off ALL comments? I notice nothing new on any board, even the stock boards."
This thing traded down to $52.18 on the 28th. That's over $5 in two trading days. VZ hasn't moved like that since 2008 -- VZ is down 4.5% from the $60 bogey seen as a ceiling/floor until 5G breaks(good). So far so good. Rates should be low for years. Time to refi and buy VZ...and I don't mean use any refi cash to buy VZ --- but you could...
VZ cant hold its price... whats with the drop ?
we've been flat for 2 weeks now. expect a decent move upwards or downward next week approaching earnings. We're about to see where people think earnings are heading....less than 2 weeks for earnings
Will we see $47.50? That would be a good entry point.
"5G will change everything. Cable will be obsolete. 5G is 100 times as fast as 4G. Just saw the CEO of VZ and Corning on CNBC and it is now clear, Verizon doesn't need to buy a cable company. They are way ahead of everyone else with 5G in the US. South Korea is already launching. VZ will begin 5G launch this year. With they capability you will be able to stream anything at super fast speeds anywhere there is wireless 5G. Big cities first. VZ and Corning are buys as well as Ericsson and Nokia who are making the switching equipment for 5G."

What has changed from this article from 2014?http://time.com/money/3445759/aol-yahoo-merger/
Vz is a great part of my diversify strategy. Happy day.
"Alright people, we got paid yesterday. Today is not a bond equivalent day, it is a risk-on day. The growth group of my portfolio is working today.You VZ naysayers -- see how that works?"
I find it interesting that there is little talk of the nose dive that VZ will be taking soon due to the merger.
NO NEW TARGETS ARE BEING SET FOR. VZ AND WE ARE ABOVE THE $57.00 TARGET NOW...

"VZ and their EU one world order installed by Han's and his Yahoo CENSORING NATZI's can watch the stock go lower and lower as they censor Americans and run off customers and shareholders , I would not be buying VZ unless you want to lose money , because any move higher will be only a chance to sell even more"
Got the first Pfizer shot two days ago. No problems. The governor down here in South Carolina led a truck medical convoy to my town. He apologized for the delay and cut our RE property tax by 5% for compensation. Late but acceptable.

"When does Yahoo resume with people able to comment on their articles? This is getting old when both good & bad articles can't be commented on. Yahoo's authors of these are sometimes spot-on, sometimes way-off, and need comments of people who experience whatever is said in articles, not 3rd hand depictions."
Lol to you posters to say buy T and not VZ.

"Yahoo is killing Verizon, it's like one big bias money-sucking op-ed machine. People spend hours making fun of the biased low-quality news that comes out of it. The cultural Marxist CEO and his media donkey cohort Guru Gowrappen are on a Don Quixote-like authoritarian sjw mission."
4 Analyst upgrades for Verizon in 6 weeks is beginning to sink in. Should be $55. :-)
"In the last several weeks 13 BILLION new bond money has went into the municipalities. In order to get your piddly .25%, you are putting your retirement at risk. THERE ARE MANY MUNICIPALS GETTING READY TO ISSUE MANY MORE BONDS TOO. Cities are dysfunctional under the dems due to theft and corruption. Please consider moving your money where there is great growth, and a really good, safe dividend. Currently near 5%. Sit back and watch your money grow"
Great buy here !
verizon is losing market shade hence the unlimited plans that will cut into their profits hard. sprint network made a good case. 45-50 bucks or hundreds?
"Verizon didn't make as much money as predicted. And they could care less. As they march to the liberal agenda, they could care less and less what the share price is, since when socialism takes over, Verizon will be nationalized and become part of the state owned phone company. Verizon had yahoo finance post story after story trying to make the right look bad, and shareholders couldn't care less. Big shareholders that is. yes, big shareholders don't care about vz price, they care about moving the agenda, and small vz shareholders are collateral damage.."
"Don't be surprised when the stimulus fails to pass the Senate. , Get ready for a massive slaughter, when it fails. LOL,LOL,LOL Hurry buy more VZ LOL,LOL,LOL"

Good movement today. Hoping for $56 by the end of the week. Long VZ!
"already dropping on VZ .40 drop and the night is not over,, gee whiz cant this stock get a stable up and hold day"
"T-Mobile reportedly plans to lay off hundreds of former Sprint employees, by Igor Bonifacic. Comment: That's why I don't like mergers."
Buy now before earnings. Stock is set to go up!
"remember trump and china are behind all this ,, China created the virus and now its destroyed America, TRUMP The DEMOCRAT"
Went to Verizon a week ago to get phone for my wife. as soon as we got there they started the con game. Give you a phone if you add a line no I said then they roll their eyes.
TEVA rebounding from 52wk low today. Breaking into 14’s now! Get in while you can!
y does Yhoo/vZ keep pressing users for there Mobile $ where in the fine print it says Verizon and its Partners will SPAM U. wTH made up this marketing plan??? 35% are tired of this krap@
"VZ has been full of BS, really don’t see it dropping much, but don’t see any appreciation either."
"same stupid day trading games, Look out below this whole system will crash and burn. It is so broken period. Investors have been screwed for last 11 years with Federal Reserve manipulating rates to try to keep stock markets up, Save housing with ridiculous prices. Keeping rates low screwing savers period. Total corruption of a free market system ."
Yahoo is owned by Verizon and prohibits Free Speech what a shame
$65 by the end of the month!!
coco still schucks
Verizon/ATT=overpriced service for the same reliability. Save thousands yoy with Sprint/TMobile
"Buying, I know it trended down last week but I think it will start an upward trend over the next couple of weeks. Good company, good earning, great value stock."
I like VZ here and if she drops some more then I will add again. Some negativity surrounding earnings but a solid divi player will most likely pay us off for those in it with me over the next 5 to 10 years. Sometime likely to be in the 60s and 70s then we will look back and wonder why we didn't pick up more in the 40s. Good luck longs.
"Unless Legere shows some guts and takes on the lawsuits first hand, the selling of Sprint (especially Sprint) and Tmus will continue. $T and $VZ green today."
hello crybabies. did you buy At&t yet???
Verizon should staring 5G in New York and Chicago first.
"Good luck to all, I am out until the dust settles. Retired and do not want to experience another 48% loss as I did in 2008/2009. See you on the back side of this."
"VZ will run now, with payroll being cut by voluntary force reduction plan."
strong buy here we will most likely see a second rotation from cyclicals to defensive stocks
Hey yahoo how about some stories about the New York grim reaper
Like to see a few dips today to pick up some more
VZ is expected to rise with the introduction of 5G residential internet service. this will come out even before 5G wireless mobile service in Houston and three other cities.
Sell VZ ...... Buy GE ..
"If Yahoo didn't post antagonizing headlines to their stories, half whatever problem they have would be solved. Being ""force fed"" their skew is infuriating, where Yahoo can ""dish it out"", but can't take USA opinions in return. Poor one-sided business practice we all pay for indirectly through our internet subscription if using ATT, and probably other providers."
"There's evidence Yahoo is looking at a subscription model for its message boards. The survey is strictly a ruse. Think about it - they're using Survey Monkey for it, and they have the database horsepower to take care of the data collection themselves. So why pay a second-rate survey company to get the data you already have access to, am I correct? So anyway I asked a couple of my former associates what they knew about this, and it's their view, from data and comments they've collected, that Yahoo is under the gun with VZ to get its numbers up, and one way to do that is to create a recurring revenue stream a la Amazon or some of these other ""monthly"" fee-based services. So they're going to jump into the fray, probably by year-end. If they don't turn their numbers, you will probably see VZ spin off its Media division, and if it keeps operating like it does now, I don't see how it could survive on its own.Secondarily, they cut off the message boards in tandem with two things - one of them was the thinly-veiled threat from Trump a few weeks ago to clamp down on social media ""fake"" news (a legitimate complaint for ALL sides, I might add), and the second was to sequester rebuttal speech to their excessively negative articles. I've commented on several Yahoo message boards that my former firm was following the vitriol on Yahoo, and saw a demonstrable increase in the past year, no coincidently timed with the massive increase in excessively negative Yahoo reporting on various topics.So Yahoo is backed into a corner, their corporate daddy VZ is breathing down their neck, and they have to do something, and do it very soon, else their ultra-liberal experiment will be spun off on its own to fend in the world, and that doesn't look too pretty to me."
Today is the beginning. Today will Mark the day when those that are non believers have no choice but to believe. Today is the last day big red sees mid 40s today is the start to the street stop lying that this or ATT is a Telco. Today 5g is in sight. Today is the future. Today is your future. Today is just the beginning of these companies getting what has been laid for years. Today is if you want to ride the highway you will pay a toll. Today is the day you start paying believers 
"Yahoo Finance claims that part of America is caught in a catch 22 economic situation, showing different areas of the country that are affected.Too bad they don't tell you that ALL Americans have been affected by China, from losing jobs, to losing benefits, to paying higher taxes to provide benefits to those who lost their jobs, Yes, if Yahoo finance had a chart of the country, showing where people suffered from China trade abuses, the whole chart would be deep red."
"VZ has the most debt per share of any company in the whole stock market , The King os debt per share at $233 . WOW that is for sure not something you want to beat GE at or you just might have to cut your dividend also."
Verizon makes a lot of money.
"Hey, Hans, do you think you could get your Yahoo division to stop LIBELING itself? Here's the latest headline example, posted as the LEAD STORY today, 11/9/2020, on Yahoo's home page:""If Trump still won't concede to Biden, he'll break more than a century of tradition""You mean like what Gore did with Bush in 2000? Where he said he won and fought it all the way to the Supreme Court, and LOST 34 days AFTER the election? You mean THAT tradition?Get your facts straight, you $h|+heads."
let's move on up and get that $61 range today!
"Watch as VZ goes lower and lower as the yahoo Censoring Natzi's are now running off shareholders and customers , Now you can not even trust VZ to protect your data because for sure you can not trust any company in America that does not protect your First Amendment rights . VZ not only did not protect them, but VZ even took away peoples First Amendment rights as the Censored what you can see , read and post. WOW what a down fall of a major American company. Had to because by Han's from the EU and the EU one world order. WOW"
VZ and yahoo not happy Trump won't accept the cheat.

"So here is the consensus:""The consensus EPS Estimate is $1.16 (-0.9% Y/Y) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $32.13B (+1.1% Y/Y).""I have to think the Investor Relations staff will have a beat for Vestberg. The article said in the last 8 Q's its been a beat 50% of the time for EPS and 75% for a revenue beat. That includes 2017 which was a punk revenue year -- until the tax cuts went thru...so I expect a modest beat on both -- or as they say in Chicago -- they beat on boat."
"You guys slate VZ, but for Mid-March, there was a staggering 23% decrease in short interest.32m down from 46m.Be thankful you're not in the sh!thole 'T'...there's increased 2% to 178m!"
AT&T’s fake 5g is slower than Verizon’s 4g? Now that’s just funny. :-)
"T-Mobile and Sprint build 5G networks are useless, because their signals too bad, their customers are low ranking customers, their customers don't have money to upgrade their networks (5G), SO T-Mobile and Sprint 5G networks plan sure be bankruptcy, SO only VZ can build 5G networks, because VZ customers are high ranking customers, they have money to upgrade their networks."
Market up over 200 Verizon down as usual.
Look at at the price/book ratio and compare $T with $VZ and $TMUS.
ATT (T) tanking: VZ follows sympathy?
Two inferior companies merging does not create a superior company. Verizon stock is going to jump as this realization sinks in...
"WOW is VZ losing customers now , Customers are leaving in droves man they just can't leave VZ fast enough they are all going to T to get Free HBO Max with their new cell plans LOL,LOL you don't even need to make this stuff up , because T's unlimited plan you get FREE HBO MAX LOL look at all the new customers T is now getting everyday WOW"

"The true value of certain stocks is never seen . The day traders knock them around like a ping pong ball . The stock gets to a certain level and their programs tell them to buy or sell . When they all buy the price goes up and when they all sell it goes down . It's really not unfair for them to do this but the little guy wonders a lot of times why the price is going up or going down ,but there ya have it . No need to worry . Verizon is on a straight path to the top . And to address the one post I saw on here about Verizon's debt . Especially with 5g on it's way . You would have to be stupid not to incur all that debt if you can afford to because it will pay off all of that debt 10 fold or more . People who make comments like that need to pay a little more attention to technology ."
This post is to yahoo software engineers. When I paste a chart link it fills two pages of code. Everything ok up there?
Blame the Fed once again for the plunge because of rate cuts/ Same old games trying to force savers into stocks. But so stupid because stocks are plunging. Get some smarts.
"so if corp tax rate is lowered to 15%, doesn't VZ suddenly have a ton of free cash flow? Aren't they taxed at the max or near the max?"
If you buy VZ today would you be entitled to the full dividend? Doesn't fair to those who held it for 3 months.
The old boards were better.....but needed spam controls and much better oversight. Verizon has to be better operators than Yahoo has been. Yahoo failed miserably.

11 days ago when sprint deal was news I sold @ $60.38 and today with amazon news I bought back @ $54.30 . I been killed on my stocks with my buy and hold strategy this was painful month. I think VZ will be two bucks higher by X dividend date .

can we finish above $59 today?
where is my pal COCO P????
Check your Verizon monthly bill for an erroneous charge for National Directory Assistance which I have received three times and friends and relatives have also received the charge with no one making the call to National Directory Assistance. Verizon continues to assert that the call must have been made by the home phone but I for one know that I was home and no one EVER made a call such as this. Does anyone else have this issue?
FANG will soon be in VZ's hip pocket!
VZ needs to fix its Yahoo stock conversation site-Imposter & Trolls run rampant with no controls ruining there stock sites-once muted they just set up new unlimited new accounts-no Yahoo controls-no matter how many complaints lodged-loosing forum subscribers.
It's fallen below the 50 and 200-day moving averages. Doesn't look so good at this time.
FYI.VZ just made a large offer to 4000 management people to retire or leave early.
MY ID continues to say it all. My pal Coco should be proud.
Why do yahoo portfolio price jump .10 then 1 cent they 10 cents—— that’s not what is really happening!!

All bs these markets will crash and burn/ So over priced. The virus will take everything down period. Just getting started because lack of care.The FEd as usual has tried to manipulate everything by throwing money at every thing here. Its one big joke. Same as Europe with their stupid negative rates. How can you have negative rates. What stupidity is that. Less than zero is zero ????????
"lolBought VZ this a week ago, simply for the dividends.Now, thanks to warren buffet, I can also get capital appreciation as well !!lol"
People who buy for the dividend will buy today to be settled
"I really wish Vestberg would stop using and abusing VZ for his own bizarre WOKE politics, and start doing things to raise the perennially stagnant stock price of VZ. If he wants to be a politician, leave VZ and go be one for heaven's sake!"
Triple top.
"Not quite sure what it is about telecom companies -- they do all they can to not be telecom companies and #$%$ away billions. VZ has made numerous efforts to move away from telecom and each has fallen flat on its face (the same can be said of ATT).VZ has made the right move in getting rid of the CEO who made these bad acquisitions and hiring a network guy to run the company as they prepare for 5G. They need to extend the layoffs into their business sales group as there is a ton of overlap with people tripping over themselves to get the same deals.I also think that VZ doesn't own the proper mid-band spectrum to roll out 5G. They have a lot of low band and some MM wave spectrum but not the choice stuff (like Sprint has in the 2.5 GHtz band). I'm not yet convinced that MM wave will propagate well enough to work well (but would love to have something like Verizon Home if it did). At that frequency, branches and leaves will block the signals.I forecast more pain for VZ until they go bare bones with their staffing and somehow procure some mid-band spectrum."
"Why are we using Yahoo?Yes it is still good!,,"
Break out coming ……. stay patient
When is the bounce?
VZ just busted through its 52-week high. (Very) good.
Is $45 support broken?? Are people loading up here?
I saw a presentation on the 5G Revolution. VZ was the leader of the 3 cell carriers. He referred to VZ as a no brainer. Referring to it as his bond with upside. We need to educate our friends. Those who know not of this will kick themselves in the next year or two.
Back up to $60.00
Has every one read the post by 'The Street' in which they predict that VZ is ready for a huge surge? I note that the stock is 'edging' up last three-four trading days. Hope is eternal!!

"Someone on this board (and you know exactly who YOU are) has been complaining to Yahoo about the posts I put on this board. I'm probably one of the few (if the only one) who has been putting up FACTUAL posts about 5G, the competitive landscape, and in particular where Verizon fits in with it. I've even had two analysts reach out to me (I'm on other boards) for insights into 5G from a technical perspective. It's sad one can't post HONEST information and not gain the wrath of others. I guess I will have to start posting their personal information on these boards to get them to back off."
Vz be pop very soon.
this mobile app is very poor. shut it down.
here it comes 58.40
Yahoo has corrupted VZ to it's absolute core. There is no hope of saving any of it.Dump it NOW while you still can!
"Today, Yahoo Finance quotes convicted felon about google and facebook. Considering the guy was CONVICTED of insider trading in 1998, Verizon would be wise to order its pinko commie rag to look to other more reputable news sources."

Perhaps it's time that Verizon stopped making a diverse workforce its top priority and actually started developing products and services that people want.
looks like a temporary dip -- money coming out of VZ going into higher risk depressed stocks.
"I looked at the poorly written and often outdated article on Yahoo basically to read the comments. Most are mindless and posted by nut-jobs, although some were good. Now that they're gone, so am I."
"Interesting article about the macro indicators that can predict an economic crisis https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/072818/macro-indicators-predict-economic-crisis?t=gauYF23jHere's a little excerpt: ""Although the last recession ended nearly a decade ago, many people across the world still feel the ripples of its impact. The extreme means the global central banks and governments took to prevent economic disaster left scars across the financial world. As time has passed, normalcy began to return to many parts of the economy. However, as history has shown, it’s only a matter of time before the next downturn.""Unrelated but definitely worth checking out :)"
In the last 10 days JPM put a $65 PT on VZ and Barron’s a $66 PT. Time for WF to cover its short position!
Verizon has proved itself to be a well managed company. Can you say the same about AT&T?
"VZ...great technical chart has formed IF you are a new investor getting in. That gap at 58.30 will get filled soon. Low P.E. of 10-12, good dividend , 5g coming, ...and net $17 Billion trailing 12 months."

"Yahoo Finance today found a poll that said democrats will defeat Trump in 2020. They didn't tell you the poll was taken in a Biden re-election committee meeting. Verizon wants Trump to lose so bad. They can't stand giving their service reps a decent wage. Wouldn't want to cut into Hans Vestberg 22 million a year salary. by the way, Hans said Verizon made a $5 billion dollar mistake buying AOL and Yahoo."
Why can’t this stock move HIGHER???
very strong outlook should be above 60 soon
Maybe warren buffett sold vz to buy more apple
Looks like warren buffett was a seller..stock sinks on every trade
nice loaded up a little bit
Verizon: I'm convinced I would get more accurate reporting from the North Korean Press then from your yahoo site.
Vz. Is weak in a up up up market..plus a buy rating by cowen did nothing
SO - if I look at the long term chart of VZ - I can see a LONG TERM cup and handle - dating back to mid 2016. Right now we appear to be bottoming the handle. If this holds and moves higher - Price target would be >$62.Agree??
hackers are using yahoo finance quote pages to load malicious software on our computers.I can't wait for the class action lawsuits that will occur. we're coming for you.
Up only 6cents on very good news what now?
GET ready to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL NEVER EVER invest in any company that is taking your rights away from you
"@ Triton, funny how you threaten to file a class action suit against VZ but you come to VZs defense against any criticism. Derp."
Pairs trade? Long T short VZ
"I expect another red day today. the run has been so fast, there may need to be more consolidation before it heads higher"
Hope we break out after VZ reports at the end of the month
"this stock is about to make multi-year highs... look at charts. with G% and cost savings, this is a no brainer"
"The sad reality is VZ cant go up on its own it relies on the S&P 500 to move up to help it, there is no real buyers in the markets anymore,,people had enough, so its goes up on index only"
5g Space race gaining traction. Verizon on top in America phone companies to Benefit. Government now looking to help 5g companies to compete against China.
"Bought back half ....1,000 shares at $53.30.....just got too cheap. ex-divvy in 2 weeks."
"AT&T Inc on Wednesday reported quarterly revenues and new wireless subscribers that fell short of Wall Street expectations, sending shares down nearly 3 percent, as its focus shifted to paying down debt from boosting its customer base.The second largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, which spent $85 billion to acquire media company Time Warner, has turned its focus to paying down debt, pulling back on price promotions for phone and television entertainment plans and sacrificing new customer gains in the process."
"BOTH T & VZ are down ""yuge"" today. Does anyone have (rational) ideas why?"
The ice is cracking!!
"After losing over 4 billion on aol/yahoo and a China trade deal about to be signed, I think this stock will go lower. If they miss earnings because of aol/yahoo write downs it will really drop."
market start going up a bit at the end of the day and this goes down more
"A 20% or 22% corporate tax rate will result in increased GAAP EPS, Operating EPS will have the largest boost since it approximates cash flow per share. Telecoms pay the second highest effective tax rate of 33%, behind energy at 35%. VZ will depreciate for GAAP at the category approved rate that will be much slower than than the 100% tax deduction first year. The 100% deduction would also apply for the next 4 years -- 100% deduction of any Capex investments. When I looked at telecom Capex for 2016 VZ led the pack with Capex/ last year's total depreciation expense VZ was at 105% -- T was next at 85% and FTR was last at 55%. VZ will be getting a boost in after tax income and cash flow."
Kevin OLeary said today that Verizon is one of his top 5 picks to outperform the market in 2019.
Now can we get rid of the Senior management team??!!!! Soon there cut the dividend also!!!!!
"just spent 20 trying to get a phone that i like and a phone number that I like transfered from one provider toverizon owned cricket. What a disaster. Lots of AI programs and phone trees to talk to but no humans.Here I sit with a brand new Samsung A01 phone, and older (3 months) Samsung A01 card, 2 or 3 sym cards, 2 phone numbers, possible 2 accounts, $60 dollars in monthly charges an account I cannot log into and that will not send me a password reset by email, and no service. what a company."
cramahhhh can shove his analysis where the sun doesn't shine... Typical #$%$...
"Biden to a ""Flop House"" not the White House !! ................................................................................................ellie"
That looks like a solid quarter to me.
here we are two months ago- and where is my buddy Coco?Coco has left the building
how do you like there auto system to pay your bill? I don't like it at all.
fed cut benefits companies such as VZ. they say don;t fight the fed.
tuff times
too depressing man!
VZ - and yes I am 100% CERTAIN you monitor this board - what the he|| kind of reporting is this at Yahoo? Basically saying Kamala is president? Are you kidding me? Does the Washington Post or NY Times do this (at least in their heyday)? https://news.yahoo.com/kind-second-gentleman-doug-emhoff-121841457.html
just came on to say woot 51 and heading to 52 soon by tomorrow or so!!!
"The yahoo deal puts VZ at about #3 in online search, internet visits and advertising, maybe this will push the mobile advertising to a new level."
"I’m looking to add more shares to my holding of VZ. I’m trying to determine if you think that it’s currently undervalued, fairly priced, or overvalued. I know it’s been in a really tight trading range over the past month. What are your thoughts?"
Trickle down explained: the viscose substance Lindsay Graham swallows while under the Resolute desk on a daily basis.
As to debt; if we have inflation VZ will be adding strategic value today; and later they will paying off expensive dollars with cheap dollars. Debt is an inflation strategy. Also if they borrow at long duration they hedge against rising rates.
somebody tell Verizon the updated Yahoo finance phone app sucks
"VZ's future is too bullish to not reach $100 within 2-3 Years, it will be crazy not to load up when it's cheap."
stock has gone no where in 5yrs....just watching the PE ration get smaller and smaller.....
"VZ, the best yo-yo stock money can buy.....it’s 50, now 45, now 40, now 45.....repeat process for 10 years."
"WOW look at all the sellers that want to DUMB VZ shares WOW , SHEEPLES are about to be SLAUGHTERED LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Verizon website says ex div today, but dividend.com and other sites say tomorrow. The stock quote systems do not reflect today being the day. Fidelity just told me its today, but I'm skeptical. Anyone know??"
"Barrons trashed Verizon today. Basically Verizon is all-in on 5G - either they perform or they don't. My take is that Hans does not have the creativity to find worthwhile ""value-add"" streams to complement the 5G. So this will remain a $60-ish stock for the foreseeable future..."
45 Billion on Spectrum! VZ now has more debt than AT&T. Too funny!
wake up fools FEd is playing games again. saying they might keep lowering rates. Wont happen this whole system will collapse. Another 2008 free fall. They never learn manipulating markets until they crash.
"may price, thinking in grtting in for the dividends"
I hope somebody at Verizon sees this. I have had the worst three days experience with Verizon than anyone could have. >their website doesn't work. I couldn't buy a phone online. i I couldn't upgrade a phone. there was a phone in a store but online it said I couldn't buy it and pick it up.I finally bought an S 20 + 5 G and it didn't transfer all the contacts and the speaker doesn't work. I have spent three hours with 3 different tech coaches and they cannot solve the problem. and what is amazing is you can'tspeak to a human being. they can sit there and text you but they are not allowed to talk to you. after 3 hours you would think someone would talk to you. on one of my many attempts to speak to someone I finally talked to a human being. he said yeah the website's pretty bad. take that to the next analyst call. how many other people couldn't buy something. incredible.the chat person wouldn't ask there supervisor to intervene. this is after three calls to tech coaches.snd Verizon is a tech leader. i don't think so.
Yahoo doesn't have the guts to let people respond to their news articles like they used to.
Both T and VZ are good hold's
T Mobile > Verizon
U.S. 23 trillion in debt never to be repaid. We are bankrupt because we never take in more than we spend. Wake up America this whole system will collapse by thousands of points because of this reality. Its worthless paper money.
"Thank you Big Red, now onto 70............."
"DOWN , DOWN VZ goes"
"Looming 28 million to be evicted.....almost 3x more than Great Recession. Now, these people probably use pre-paid phones, but the Landlords of these empty houses probably have #VZ or #T plans. You'll see a trickle up effect on lower sales and smaller plans. I don't think any company is going to NOT be hurt by numbers like these. Insane numbers."
Big Red gets a Big Bounce
"Yahoo is killing Verizon, it's like one big bias money-sucking op-ed machine. People spend hours making fun of the quality of news that comes out of it. The CEO and his donkey cohort Guru Gowrappen are on a Don Quixote-like authoritarian sjw mission"
Im not scared im buying much more
"today is x dividend day, last chance to catch the div."
"don't forget, VZ 5G networks coming next year (2018), 5G networks sure be bring more business for Verizon. SO buy VZ sure be make money."
"VZ's yahoo is so biased to the left, pro-riot, pro-murder of whites and cops you'd think management despises a stable business environment."
"hey hey look what time it is, time for another sihtty raise:)another 1.25 cents while you give money to all the esg/woke siht9/4/14 dividend raised .53 to .55 9/3/15 dividend raised .55 to .565 9/1/16 dividend raised .565 to .5775 9/7/17 dividend raised .5775 to .59 9/6/18 dividend raised .59 to .6025 9/5/19 dividend raised .6025 to .615"
"Hahahaha... the DemoSocialists are now feeding on themselves... wokeness going out of control...A public high school teacher in San Francisco named Ingrid Seyer-Ochi, wrote an op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle Sunday and Seyer-Ochi’s objection was to the “privilege, white privilege, male privilege and class privilege” symbolized by Bernie Sanders’s choice of a relatively casual Burton snowboarding jacket and repurposed wool mittens.Seyer-Ochi addressed the topic with her students, who she said were also upset by what they saw as the implicit message being delivered by Sanders’s choice of outerwear. (I don't doubt her feeding of Socialism to her students were behind this) “What did they see? They saw a white man in a puffy jacket and huge mittens, distant not only in his social distancing, but in his demeanor and attire,” Seyer-Ochi wrote, adding, “What did I see? What did I think my students should see? A wealthy, incredibly well-educated and -privileged white man, showing up for perhaps the most important ritual of the decade, in a puffy jacket and huge mittens.“I don’t know many poor, or working class, or female, or struggling-to-be-taken-seriously folk who would show up at the inauguration of our 46th president dressed like Bernie.”Hahahahahhahahahaaa"
always excuses for going lower...............
Market up over 200 and this stock is in the RED!!!
i wonder if they will cut the dividends????
I see this 4.5% pull back as a buying opportunity. I like the $59 support and think it could retest highs in a few weeks.
"I love the prospect of Elizabeth Warren targeted high tech. Because she will also go after big banks, and big telecoms, like Verizon. And since Verizon has been going after Trump through yahoo finance, verizon will get what it deserves."
Congrats to all those who had the balls to buy into earnings.....woohoo!
PE 12? This stock should be around $75 - $80... T and TMUS trade at around 23 multiples
$VZ eating $T’s lunch.
does vz own yahoo
Where is the warren buffett stock pump...it's all fading
"Here's another one from Verizon's Yahoo - Pelosi said ""A Brazen Invitation For This To Happen"" and basically she doesn't feel bad Trump has Covid. Lead banner on Yahoo home page right now (10/2/2020 10:50 AM PST). What kind of $h|+ is this, Verizon? Are you a leading cellular service company, or a peddler of an extreme agenda? As a shareholder, I prefer the former, and elimination of the latter."
Biggest Dump of 2021. Things only going to be worst from here.
"Verizon will be a major beneficiary of the Tax Bill. The stock should move into the $60s. Baby Boomers like the Dividend and Dividend Growth. 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring in the US every day now......Verizon is a perfect fit for them."
"VZ, always a port in the storm. Would like to see a bump up in the dividend though."
"India has launched surgical airstrikes against Pakistan. And now apparently, Verizon, through yahoo finance is telling people the President must respond. Who in the world does Verizon think they are, demanding the President take action, to help Pakistan. If you remember, Verizon is against the wall that would keep us from being over run. Verizon must be doing business in Pakistan, that they want protected. lets investigate, and discover hidden relationships, deals and affiliations. If Verizon really wants to hurt India, Verizon should set up in India, and start running a lousy corporation there, and hurt the good people of India. And your investment in Verizon may help a retaliatory strike by the US against India, and your investment might help Pakistan people get killed. You better go to your shareholders meeting and have a long talk with management, or help vote them out."
Will this stock ever find a bottom? Its supposed to be a safe dividend play. Management needs to support the stock.
"Bought 500 at $47.90 a couple of months ago. Missed the peak, but managed to bail out at $50.80 and snag the dividend. At $48.25, it's tempting, but will probably wait until it's closer to $47 a share to jump back in. The Fed is gonna raise interest rates and that is going to drive down the price of Verizon shares."
Waste of time and money owning this stock
"Omg, down AGAIN. VZ, talk about underperformance.."
"what a stupid article there on yahoo...""better than competitors,but bot immune from corona"" yeah thanks mr obvious theres like 3 companies immune from corona."
Sell all at $50
good dip buy today guidance looks better from previous forecast. i see more gains ahead
"The new normal T up and green and VZ down and RED. LOL, better learn to love it because T is going a lot higher and VZ is going a lot lower LOL.LOL,LOL"
"VZ, talk about a pointless stock to own. SERIOUS underperformer."
Time to add more VZ shares with 5G expected to grow immensely in 2021 and beyond.
"VZ the company without a future. LOL,LOL,LOL Get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
It's still $3.00 below where is was in June of last year so I'm not that excited yet. Good to get back the losses though.
"What happens when VZ drop down right passed $55 and just keeps dropping because VZ is the company without a future . Why no need to ask actions always speak volumes . The Censoring of Americans will lead to people stop doing business with VZ and it's already started . LOL,LOL,LOL, Death by their own hands of stupidity . Stupid is as Stupid does always remember action speak volumes loud and clear. Words mean nothing if not followed by your action you do and live. FACT"
"1 year price appreciation on this one is 2.06%, then throw in the dividend, not even 7%. Talk about an underperformer. Totally pointless to own this."
"4.4% dividend, extremely low PE, not at all time highs, is this a good buy for a bond like position in ones portfolio."
"Still time to capture current Dividend, company goes EX-Div this coming Friday, don't miss out!!"
Puke Verizon and puke Yahoo barf their biased liberal anti-American agenda every day while extending their COWARDLY suppression of conservative opinion.
Wow it’s even lower than 20 years ago now!
Is insg one of 5G suppliers for Verizon. Stock is acting like it is.
"Wow, on CNBC, just a few minutes ago, they had to admit that the parent company, Comcast has not been doing very well of late. Well yea, cable is a dying industry. That is why I refer to Vz, as THE CABLE KILLER! Predicting $62 could be reached later today. They also could not resist taking a swipe at Disney. Why? Cause they recognized the value of teamimg up with Vz Wireless. The best of the best."
How does merger help vz?
Finally Verizon has become an exciting stock!
Keep talking yourself into buying AT&T. Dividend and diversification including 5G. Well?
VOMIT...........
The Mandalorian on Disney + = must get me one of those bull riders. Not the greatest 1st ep however it's OK for a star wars series start. I hope it gets better and better. ... We enjoyed it. Free on verizon for a year. Makes we want to buy some #DIS stock.$dis $vz
"At 6x EBITDA and 12x earnings, VZ is about the cheapest stock on the market. They are finally going for cash flow growth and not just growth to get larger. That will pay off in dividend increases. MIC is doing the same thing but has a 10% yield. They own Atlantic Aviation the private jet servicing business."
"BITTER VERIZON UNION SLOBS ARE DUMFOUNDED AND CONFUSED. BEATEN SO BADLY BY VERIZON!. The beer guzzling, bad smelling, disgusting looking Verizon Union Slime balls are May's biggest losers.They lost their health insurance, their income and now their family members are turning on them. (rightfully so)"
When was the last time VZ increased their dividend?
"Watch as VZ drops, VZ will have to cut the dividend just to keep paying that MASSIVE debt and the Commodities VZ sells just keep dropping in price"
"Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes , LOL,LOL Why because VZ is still running off customers and investors as VZ CENSORS what you can see ,read and post , NO matter what a company thinks they can not take away your First Amendment rights like VZ is now doing , Just like VZ can NOT put up sign that says Whites only NO Black allowed for the same reason. Good luck Warren if you were SMART you would get VZ to change what they are doing or sell , but if not that's ok too NEVER EVER invest in a company that Take away your First Amendment rights. Because what they are now doing is NOT right for one but NOT even legal."

Whole market system being manipulated by Wall Street traders here.Nasdaq traders are buying other indicies at same time to take everything up higher. LIke S&P etc. THank your Federal Reserve for this manipulation of markets with these games. No fundamentals at all here.We need at least a 3 to 4 thousand Nasdaq free fall here.
Any chance of a dividend raise after this conference call?
Why disable comments on yahoo? Let people express them selves....Its called free speech.....is this some new consept?
"There is a wedge forming.56.50 -54.50.Soon we will know,breakout or breakdown."
Buy VZ now is it ok? New in the game
WHy does Yahoo Finance have countless ads for videos of Raquel Welch and scantily clad female news reporters.Someone please tell Verizon that modern liberals do not exploit women. Why would you own stock in a company that exploits and denigrates women ? .
.14 gain with x div around the corner and market up 700 pts...mmmmmmm
GO VZ! Love this stock.
"If people are going to be this stupid in AH, i am adding to my position."
I don't care news about VZ and T.
"Vios 5G Dividend 400 a month I pay for service, shouldn’t this stop be going up?"
"Verizon is the only company that can bid the amount of money needed to win the big contracts for 5G airwaves - Auction 107. When this happens, they will be huge!""Licenses to use some of of the most valuable frequencies will be assigned to the highest bidder. Whoever wins will almost certainly use them to build out a faster, more powerful 5G network, changing the competitive dynamics of the telecom industry."""
"Sold naked the $51 puts today. VZ is going to hit some very strong support around the $51 level. Not a bad price of $50.4 if I will be assigned on a safe, dividend stock."
Over four thousand of the August $52.50 bought today with no hedge!
"ICE, I see you arrested 114 people at an Ohio Landscaper. Please go easy on them, but fine the daylights out of the company. Also please look into Verizon, and Yahoo Finance, and see how many people they have, that they shouldn't. I'm sick and tired of businesses not hiring people who are citizens. And I'm sick and tired of lousy shareholders who profit from it."
"T's 5G monster is now FEEDING on it's competition LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL VZ the company without a future LOL,LOL,LOL"
"will it all drop after the ex div of .62, it could test 54 level again, thats why i said i am out...the div is not a big deal, but a drop again of 5 points is,,i would rather trade it"
VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS has hired 1712 different lobbyists over 18 years.

My buddy Coco P is going to be rewarded for his spew about 4% dividend yield blah blah.69 is all time high and we are headed to that price
"Remember don't shake hands, not because of the virus, but everyone ran out of toilet paper. Also if you lost 7 % in stocks yesterday and went to 30 year bonds , how many years will it take for you to get even ?"
looks like this stock wants to go up. should test 53 in the next week. jobs report is tamping down interest rate expectations which will benifits the stock price.
"Simple strategy for VZ — buy on dips, hold forever, collect dividends. Great long hold stock."
is 51-52 the right place to convert all of 401K into VZ stocks only
is this theCramer drop ?
Dow down 555 and VZ down $.08 -- this is an example of why VZ is the best bond equivalent going -- the 10 yr T note is at 1.6% yield -- VZ's revenue is domestic.All VZ has to do is keep its nose up with growing revenue and profits and it should gain -- the $10 bil cost reduction moves should show thru in 2020...
Wow A screaming but yes.Seems the baby was thrown out with the bath water.... huge understatement!As they say....’this too shall pass’.
"Anyone wanna tell me what is going on? They beat earnings and are growing, and are red?"
"I’ll buy VZ once it’s below $53.95; otherwise, it’s too high"
Verizon is copying what it does to its Subscrib3ers. VZ mutes subscriber criticism by muzzling them. They plan on doing the SAME to YHOO commentswatch

"Pretty Boy Hans told us that this was the year 5G was suppose to start delivering for VZ shareholders.But wait,,,now $50-60 billion more in capex is needed just to get the infrastructure up and running.When should we believe him?Hans has zero respect or consideration for shareholders.Spend,Spend,Spend,,,to The Moon!"
"Rsi at 29, crossed below the lower bollinger band, this stock is quite oversold in my opinion"
Hans has a hard time articulating the plan but the plan is real. Higher price plans being sold. Fios doing really well. 5G rollout continuing.
Verizon is dead in the water

"leasing their cellular network to their competition then not adjusting prices to compete, just painful, been with them from day one. CEO got to go, imho"
"Yes the spectrum auction cost them $45B(not insignificant), but their operating cash flow for LTM was nearly $42B and FCF for LTM was over $21B.. This is more than enough to address the $45B they spent. You may see them forgo stock repurchases for a couple of years, but that should be about it. While I agree, the debt is not insignificant, their cash flow is strong and debt is not a big issue currently. If cash flow were to fall off significantly, I might be more concerned."
You could set time based on the steadiness and consistency of the decline here.
Keep your eyes focused on SONO!
Look at all the short-side whackos coming out of the woodwork due to a short and algo-fueled selloff because ONE analyst downgraded the stock to $59. Coupled with the trade tensions (which have ZERO relation to VZ) and this is a perfect environment for this drubbing. Some nutjobs are comparing this to Kodak; utterly ridiculous. However ... this is as golden a buying opportunity as there ever was in this stock. Buying with both fists and with no hesitation.
Just think if you invested 10000$ in this stock 20 years ago you would have 21000$ now$$$
Looks like Uncle Joe is in deep do do. Pay to play Biden got caught and the house is crashing!!!!!! Hahahahaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!
soooo where is all the latest conversation? ? ? ?
Abolish Federal Reserve here and now. They have screwed the middle class out of a descent return on their money with below market interest rates for last 11 years. All of this to try to hold up stock markets etc. Make people go into stock market for a descent return on their money. Whole system is corrupt to try to hold up markets period. Need to abolish the Federal Reserve here and now. Put an end to these manipulation games screwing the average investor / citizen .Can only get maybe 2.5% return in money market here.
"strange to see so much bashing and pumping on the board of this stock, that will continue to trade in a tight 45-65 range for years and provide decent yield for holding"
"Yahoo Finance, propaganda arm of Verizon, runs a story about how David Hogg told his dozen followers to boycott Blackrock and Vanguard. I don't know If Blackrock does, but Vanguard owns a ton of Verizon. So yahoo finance is telling people to stop investing in a mutual fund that buys Verizon stock. How does that make you feel ? Maybe now you'll call for Verizon to stop their far left agenda."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5MkCAwupe0
so over bought over priced here look out below crash and burn
Why can’t this stock breakout?
"Buy the telecoms at 52week lows is a no brainer. The div yield is better than a bond, and the news always swings from bad to good. Every dog has it's day, buy when it's down."
"Verizon will be the next to get charged by the government for picking and choosing the posts they want to allow on this board, I am recording all this activity to present this to the authorities."
Cramer said buy VZ LOL. I am going with at&T. better div and they got HBO streaming...
"Enhanced IPP in the pipeline... In the mail Mid October, and offthe payroll by Early November....Verizon not kidding about COST cutting !!!Good Luck to all of those employees looking :)"
I bought some at 50.80
This is why you should never chase a stock especially if its at ATH.
I’m a buyer at $45

"I notice that Yahoo has now pulled down the survey, and now just shows this trite little message at the end of each article:""Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions. In order to improve our community experience, we are temporarily suspending article commenting.""If the popular web reporting companies are correct, Yahoo has seen a measurable drop in its hit and ""click through"" rates since pulling down their message boards. But this continues a trend that was already underway long before Yahoo made the decision to pull their boards: https://www.fastcompany.com/90462377/yahoo-and-tumblr-lost-33-of-their-web-traffic-in-the-last-several-years I am really struggling to understand why VZ continues to hold on to its Media division. From a business standpoint, it is not adding value as it was expected to when it was bought by VZ. If anything, the significant markdowns in goodwill (billions) should serve as a wakeup call to VZ executive management to shed themselves of this pig, and see if it can fend for itself. Look at what Danaher (DHR) did with its test and measurement group. It spun them off as Fortive (FTV). Fortive thrived once it was on its own, as did Danaher. VZ, do the same with Media and spin it off. Call it Yahoo User Collection (or YUC) and see if it flies on its own. What do you have to lose?Let's see how long THIS message stays up on the board."
"Why will T just keep going higher now , because T has a future and built a 5G monster to devour it's competition. Wall Street is trying to get out of VZ and pick up T shares on the cheap all with the help from Cramer. LOL,LOL you just can 't make this stuff up LOL,LOL,LOL Why because VZ with all it's debt now has no future and no money to try and make a future LOL,LOL,LOL"
Earnings/ revenue beat and VZ down. Damn.
45 here we come.
T-Mobile has to spend a lot of money to 'steal' verizon wireless customers. They want to be bought out and Verizon as tempting as it may be needs to sit it out.......The stock continues to be clobbered relentlessly.
last night Biden 1
VZ has lousy cell service. Should’ve stayed with att. Short the stock

Tiki Torch antennas for 5G?https://insidetowers.com/tiki-torches-bring-5g-downtown-raleigh/
How many people are going to the shareholders meeting ????? You can voice your opinion there and join groups that have the same views.
Verizon should be the go to stock for a wireless provider of 5G based on market share and revenue. But their balance sheet has just been awful and have had to purge a lot of its management staff to keep above its bottom line. Its possible if this gets down to under 50 and the company works at getting out of debt it might be a good buy.
What's the story?
should i drop VZ for Twitter? Twitter is reporting their earnings tomorrow
Warren Buffet's intelligence and my thoughts: It's far better to buy a wonderful company (VZ) at a fair price than a fair company (T) at a wonderful price.
We have liftoff

Yahoo owns by Verizon. Don’t delete my post.
Buffett seeking solid dividend plays..
Double bottom Only up from here!!!!!
3 month cup and handle. Get ready for breakout above $52!!!
New 2019 Price target for Verizon: $75.00
"I know this is a bit off-topic, but I've been asked a number of times why I left the US in late 2018. Here is but one reason why: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-announces-new-offshoring-tax-penalty-and-minimum-tax-on-foreign-earnings-2020-09-09?link=MW_latest_news"
$60 is the new low
Verizon needs to raise their dividend bigly.
coco be dem flamer of the boards.
CSCO beats earnings. Looking for SJM to beat tomorrow.
"Yoy 6.5% price appreciation, 4.3% last 6 months, yet these clowns still think it is going to 100....At least T outperformed, this has been a bum stock."
"T has created a 5G monster and can leverage all it's assets in a 5G world , VZ has created massive DEBT and has no assets it can leverage to compete in a new 5G world , NO one wants yahoo that censors 1/2 the populations inputs LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
I hope many good Americans boycott the anti American Verizon
I imagine this must be a very boring stock for day-traders....
Heading to 55
"study shows unlimited data plan are slowing carrier wireless speed.that means wireless network have a lot more space to grow, too busy, wireless carrier sure be rise fee, no more price war, rise fee will be boost it's sales growth and make a lot more money, SO buy Verizon sure be make money."
Now the recent buyers are jumping ship and going back to tech.
"This is a piece of S#IT. Entire market moving but this stock stuck in the mud. I own shares of VZ, I?d have better chances of making money in Vegas than in this piece of #$%$"
When was the last time Verizon Lowered or stopped their dividends??
These are the kind of dips before a nice run. Let's see it happen!
UBS downgrade
Sell before Yahoo's Bots figure out you bought.
WHEN DOES VZ TAKE HIT FROM DIV PAYOUT PREMARKET ? opening ? or after close today ? THANKS IF ANYONE KNOWS
"5G Home network, providing 5G broadband internet service, is officially live today for consumers in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento."
"2 hour wait for ""Customer DIS SERVICE...the Anti-Christ of Customer Service or the KNown as Verizon Dept of Sales Prevention....STAY away if annything goes wrong wirh SERVICE Verizon is Beyond Horrible..If have Yahoo email BEWARE of the YAHOO VERIZON MAIL PRO SCAM...if you DO not take it Verizon ILLEGALLY will Sabatoge how Yahoo Emaill Works...It you want to print a Email imvoice the DREADED Yahoo Mail PRO logo will ""BLOCK"" a 1/4 of the page!!! You may get incoming Email notice that is a VERIZON ?Mail Pro SCAM that is just a AD....had it REMOVE by the AWFULL VERIZON CLOWNS only to have it come back...We need to have CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT against Verizon...and FCC as ILLEGAL to Exort you by sabatoge email to FORCE you into MAIL PRO SCAM...BEWARE BAD management"
not really seeing why VZ is taking a hit given the fairly strong earnings. really struggling as of late.
VZ is going down hill.
"does anybody really know the where this stock could be , a year from now ? any good guesses ?"
https://www.investopedia.com/news/verizons-discounted-stock-seen-rising-10-higher/
Would love to close above $55 today!
Why is Verizon management getting so much #$%$ here? They pulled an amazing move selling their home phone service to frontier for 10 BILLION dollars lol and now they are buying a huge name brand for 5 billion.
"Is VZ Media aiding and abetting rioting in the US?If you study what Yahoo is putting up for news in recent weeks, the answer is looking more like ""yes"". Very one-sided reporting, limited to no accounting for the facts, or to what lead up to the events of a story, and now NO REBUTTAL allowed. The articles are also designed to stir up negative emotions. Is this what VZ wants to be known for, or for a high-quality communications network?VZ board of directors, please do your job. Please."
Most corrupt company on the planet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Breakout coming....... At support.
"If you buy Yahoo, fire the jerk who approved the changes to Yahoo finance but before you do make them put EVERYTHING back to where it was. I use YF all day, and have for years. NONE of the changes are good. They screwed up the message boards, graphs, layout of stock ""Summary"" page, Biggest stock gainers/losers page and more. They screwed up their Stock Screener years ago and won't fix it-they include all these foreign stocks that have no data behind them. Really, they are a bunch of idiots. Lkiely none of them is a serious investor. Get someone who is, and let them direct the Fince ""enhancements"". I volunteer."
"Wow, look at this junk. No safety with this one, that is for sure."
VZ is way too high / over-valued / over-bought and so it 'll be down anyway after its E/R no matter what .....that 's the way of stock movement ....
"The market is crashing, the CNBC talking heads are guessing at the total % dip, and I just noticed it was packed at Home Depot down here in the Atlantic SE. I was paranoid keeping a social distance of a few feet. I'm starting to think this will pass sooner rather than later. I don't think enough of us will be sick at any one time to break the bank. And warmer weather is coming. This is a buying opp in VZ and so many other stocks. Hans was just on TV and said they may spend $18 bil up from $17 bil on 5G Capex this year -- I guess some of that Capex is for FIOS. VZ may have some copper left but not much. They sold most of it."
Looking to dump the Huffington Post. https://nypost.com/2020/09/28/verizon-scrambling-to-unload-huffpost-as-losses-mount/
"Incentives for infrastructure investments will include transportation, utilities, and telecom networks. With 100% depreciation allowed T, VZ, Vodafone, BT, Reliance, etc are the trillion dollar assets. Either you buy now, or wait till analysts start explaining this to you. Everything - from IOT, Applications, Databases, Servers, Sensors, Smart Things, Cities, Transportation, PAAS, SAAS, Big Data...every word humans have created.... requires NETWORK. And that network is worth just $300B while the dot.coms are going to be worth $iTrillion.....not happening."
Why in the world does VZ still want to buy Yahoo?? The security breach was a perfect excuse to get out of the deal. Yahoo brings nothing to the table.
Powell is going to bend over big time for wall street - BUY BUY BUY
VZ is safe haven.
Has anybody done a speed test on 5G?
Wouldn't it be better to buy AT&T for the dividend since you are getting nearly twice the shares?
"Haha, got even worse as the day went on. What a loser stock Verizon is. Totally pointless."
some streaming ar/vr to your samsung headset? a new way to watch tv/movies /sports? wags....using the hd ip?
"T-Mobile and Sprint:bad signals, high p/e, no dividend, made a little money, a little bit cash, they don't have enough money to built 5G networks."
What happened to my VZ today?
Today’s big vol accumulating is for the surge on Monday!
Verizon exec Marni Walden says the $4.83B deal to buy the core of Yahoo's assets still makes sense even after the security breach $YHOO $VZ
wow what a drop at open. hold stronger as it will recover. its a rock compared to others
https://www.ariasystems.com/blog/3-ways-telecoms-will-monetize-5g/
"I see all the negative or questioning comments about Verizon's media group. I've had similar concerns about their media group for years. They wrote off a lot of it some time back. Trying to understand why they keep it. I read somewhere, I think Barrons, that William Power of Baird has questioned this as well, and he's a top rated analyst. Not sure I understand why they keep pouring dollars into it. It's a reasonable question to ask, even though I see people disagreeing and dragging politics into it. Heck, Verizon is trying to dump Huff Post which is total garbage even if you have liberal beliefs. Yahoo is not far behind. Trying to understand the value proposition those two bring to Verizon. Maybe it's me, but when I look at the financials and what their primary business is, I just don't see it."
Remember you only sell the moves higher in VZ and TMUS because they are both losing customers to T's monster new unlimited cell plans with Free HBO MAX
GG bet neutrality bye bye
Worked for GTE before becoming Verizon. FTR management has managed to gut one of the best landline infrastructures ever built. I always thought that management anywhere should be paid a modest salary with most in company stock so they have an incentive to work hard for the company and employees. They shouldn't be allowed to prop their feet up on their desks while Nero plays his music. It's a real shame. Used to be a good/managed/well disciplined company to work for. I feel bad for the regular employees who are caught up in this mess. I'm very thankful to my retirement and VZ stocks that have kept me afloat.
anybody know if the er will have vestberg or mcdams present or both?
Watch for the bounce before it goes ex-dividend...
The sheep will most likely regret selling by the close. Always buy the unnecessary panic. It is how the big boys make money. Fleecing the small investor out of their shares.
10 % pullback just over 2 months.. on no news.. just bs rate hike hype. let the FED do their job and lay off the hype
"Been holding AT&T , Bell Atlantic, Verizon stock for decades. For the 1st time I am worried about this company."
"Wow , what made VZ jump 2.00 after hours"
"40,000 job cuts announced at At&t.....wonder if VZ will soon announce job cuts to keep up with the jones'?"
This hurts.....but it will set up an upgrade in the Spring. Verizon is doing very well. :-)
The stock should be up! I paid my FIOS bill!
"if the Dems stole the election how come Collins, Graham and Mcconnell were re elected?I thought the virus would disappear after election day? Another lie added to the pile.The only sentence Trump will finish is a prison sentence."
"I love #VZ at this price. Picked up 1,000 shares at $54.09. Holding since $27 :-)"
VZ was higher five years ago. Real shareholder focused company.
Boycott Verizon and Yahoo
Omg this board is so tight
"All the wireless carriers in the US will benefit from the 5G upgrades even though it costs a fortune for them to participate. The cable to your home will no longer be necessary is you are in a 5G zone. So, the whole industry is going to change for in home communications. I live in Portugal now and all the carriers here have been using 4G hotspots for years to delivery Netflix and other wireless opitions. 5G will allow higher resolution and faster download speeds. So, who is going to be carrying the 5G signal? The wireless providers like VZ, T, and TMUS. All will have significant increase in business. The cable providers will gradually go down as this new delivery method takes over the home and also business."
"if aapl sell 5g iPhone now, vz can skyrocket to $85 ,T-Mobile and s will down 50percent."
"DOWN , DOWN , DOWN VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL from best of breed to out right disaster LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Apple up 65% in the last 52 weeks, VZ down 8.75% in the last 52 weeks, the company is not competing with the big boys anymore. The dividend is good if you have 10,000 shares like the big boys on the board. Notice they keep the dividend high because they have thousands of shares."
Market is up 700 and VZ is down in the red....and you morons think this is doing well???
Why isn't this up as much as T today ?
"If you like Verizon's dividend and would like to beat it while including a lot of other telecoms, utilities and services in your investment check out UTG. 7% dividend and 50 stocks in their holdings."
"Looks like a revenue miss with a bunch of window dressing. The press release dances around the issue. Still solid all things considered but I wonder how the Street will react? Barring a big announcement, more sideways for another quarter which is the deal with a dividend stock."
"VZ - head up - Fox News is killing it in prime timeFYI to VZ executives (yes, their investor relations team keeps an eye on various message boards, including Yahoo's). I notice that Fox News is killing it with their Nielsen book lately, leaving all the other cable networks, and even the traditional 3 (ABC, NBC, and CBS) in the dust. How does this relate to Yahoo? I lump Yahoo in with CNN as far as political leanings, and CNN's recent Nielsen book was, to put it mildly, horrible. Here, let Yahoo reporters tell you all about it: https://news.yahoo.com/boycotted-criticized-fox-news-leads-162105729.html"
VZ trading at PE of 16. AT&T trading at forward PE of 8.7. Guess this gap has to close. VZ to $50 and T to $40
same old day trading games. Look for massive down openings coming on reality. Markets so manipulated here. Massive sell-off is coming once again.
"VZ the company without a future in America LOL,LOL,LOL as Americans are now dumping them like a hot potato LOL,LOL ,LOL EU run #$%$ VZ, right HAN's"
"fellas, the problem here isn't specifically Vz it is our thinking process. people font like change, we assume guaranteed 5% dividend at guaranteed flat stock level. NOTHING IS GUARANTEED. do I like the 5% umm yeah, but stock is down roughly 20% and to be honest I dont think it's done"
Just crossed the 50 day. If it closes above it will be a good signal
"Can't stop Bleeding, $40s is next."
VZ wrote a large check for NH so did what used to be RIMM so did CELGENE as well as others ....DIG in on NH = GPS CANCER TEST and a WHOLE LOT MORE.....see 2 news releases yesterday ...and read the qtrs confrence call notes....for a start.GPS CANCER = nothing like it on the planet and its going GLOBAL as i type...See you on the NH Board
"Seasonally telecomms bottom out during this quarter and slowly recover and rally from OCTOBER. This is a known pattern. Not news driven but induced news to support the PPS. None of these telecoms have stellar growths. Hedge funds pump the dividend news and play the game. These telecoms don't lend from banks. They issue their own bonds to raise funds. Debt is the only way to run telecom business to survive. What is important is their CASH flow. Levered and operating cash flows are better measure for telecom business performance. Verizon is safe because they are on track to cut $10B cost in next 5 years. Expecting a telecom recession next year, the US Govt., will announce modernizing their network with 5G and spending 100B USD next year. That boosts the entire sector... End of the day, these telecoms are buy and hold reducing your average cost price by 2 to 2.5 USD ... Over 10 years, you will be in a much better position. However, if 5G residential services bodes well to Verizon, it will be a growth stock next year. GLTA!"
"VZW, the best I've ever seen - their OATH Brand took over my ISP, filled it full of ads, then offers me AD-FREE email service for a extra FEE .. and I've been a stockholder since 3/2009 :-("
If we have a market correction this thing is heading to the 30s
With the stock being down so much yesterday todays results are not a surprise. They send people to jail for insider trading. I guess this doesn't count.
"Technically speaking...no better time to purchase...extreme support at $54 over last 3 yrs...breakout gap...forthcoming 5g contracts/investments...and a hefty 4.5% dividend to boot. Fundamentally a cash cow ...with a debt load yes, but at an interest rate of peanuts :) !"
"you people are crazy, you'll make alot on this company. it's one of the best"
have followed this stock for 2 years and keep telling myself to buy in the $54's then it gets there on a market rally day and I can't pull the trigger with how BAD it is acting. This has got to be one frustrating stock to own.
Hire a dynamic media executive. VZ is squandering penetration.
VZ is political paying for favorable treatment
Verizon owns yahoo. Yahoo wants to censor you because of their biased opinion. They don't want to hear two sides of the story.
Never sell Verizon [vz.]
After hours ???
VZ is now 59.105 due to the 61.5 cent div. being locked in. Futures are up so it will probably start traded 30 cents higher or so.
I've been holding and growing my GTE/VERIZON stock since 1970. The dividends keep me going with nothing tapped from my retirement or SS. Love this stock.
VZ would need to drop to $39 to trade at the same Forward PE as T. And T would need to raise to About $36 to trade at the same forward VZ is trading at. Looks like VZ has a long ways to drop and T has room to move HIGHER
"vz have very strong earnings, so vz no reason down today,"
"Guess the market didn't like the much of the ""news"" about VZ today. It may be years before we see $60 again. I'm holding for the dividend. GLTA"
somebody tell Verizon the yahoo phone app is a total disaster
Here's How To Order It.....https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/hotspots/tracker-plus-safe-found.html?ensembleId=CP311ATRBLK&contractName=0-yr-ib&deviceQuantity=1
take profits !!!!. Get fack out...........................
what do you guys think? buy now before earnings or wait till after?
"On a day when most are up, this one is down... Getting no love for a company with low risk and a decent dividend, hmm"
Ameriprise Financial ask for Brian... we laugh and joke lol.
"Verizon is range bound, as typical for high dividend stocks. This is not a growth stock. Hold, if you get a good price, and make money from dividends. That being said, $54-$55 is not a bad entry point. It’s a cinch it will be $56-$57+ by beginning of next month. Buy at this level and below, sell before ex-div and make 2-3%. Or hold for income. But if this reaches $59 or above - sell! Rebuy on the following drop."
Bought back my 60 call today.
VZ has lost it competitive edge. No longer are they the only signal in the area. T Mobile and others are killing them. T is way out ahead in diversifying. VZ buy of Yahoo is a joke. It will not help them. Yahoo is a dog. VZ has too much debt from the Vodafone deal. Where do they go from here? Merge with someone in the media business that is relevant.
they screwed up when they bought high freq bandwidth for 5g. Tmus 5g will be far superior
The lower it trickles downward the more forceful it will thrust back up!
Time to go up
"VZ uses yahoo to lie about the president, and to downplay rioting and looting. Can their financial reporting also be dishonest."
This one always seems to move opposite of the market.
BUY AND ENJOY 5.3% DIVIDEND. it is more than 5 yr trailing avg dividend of VZ.
"Learning the SAY OH NO down VZ goes , just like the communist company VZ has become as VZ now CENSORS both Shareholders and customers alike on what the can see read and post , VZ is now running off customers and shareholders in droves ."
you are right. Is there a better look than Yahoo?
More spectrum coming
From red today to green tomorrow. It is the season after all.
"But wait! I thought the market was going to tank with a Biden win! lol! You repubs totally deserve to get salt rubbed into your wounds: how's it feel, schmucks?! Looooosers. That really had to be said. We dems won't dwell on it, but you deserve it for being irrational anti-fact a-wipes for 4 years. Now... let's enjoy a Real President who'll -- again, every time a dem has been elected starting with at least Clinton -- fix the destruction the repubs create and get Train USA churning again. Boom. Nice start! It'll drive tGrumpy absolutely insane -- and he'll for sure try to claim glory for the spike up somehow. Let's watch the obese turtle on his back bark out nonsense for the sole purpose of trying to link himself to this spike. Hopefully tGrumpies will #$%$ now for a few years. You won't be missed.... but, as always with dems, you will be invited to go along for the Recovery Ride, and reap the benefits as the USA becomes believable and respectable again on the Global Stage. You're welcome. Too bad you had to fight it so hard and put this idiot in the white house to destroy the country. Maybe you'll realize it this time as it plays out and realize that a vote for the repubs is a vote against America... you just cannot see it b/c your mind is clouded by irrationality. Maybe in 4 more years.... as you enjoy your riches as the dems lead us out of yet another repub mess. Yahbooomy!"
Precursor to earnings miss?
"simply starts to break out this week$63 -$67.50 by end of month ceo is just too good along with dividend, in a declining interest rate environment just buy collect and put away"
MY ID says it all
Lots of July Calls Options bought. Over seven thousand of the July $51.50 calls.
bahahaha. huge earnings. vz down. love it. buying more
why its sudden drop
just clip the 4.5% divi and ride the 5G wave

"Yahoo Finance just said Janet Yellin repeatedly made misleading statements to Congress. Yellin was appointed by Obama.I'm surprised when Yellin testified, that she didn't take the 5th , like many other liberal snakes do when asked by Congress about their actions. When is Yahoo News being called before Congress, to explain their part in the dossier ?"
Awesome. Thanks for the cheap shares you chicken little’s.
VZ should be concerned about class action lawsuits for slowing down the internet
I think VZ would do better to get rid of the morons at yahoo
VZ/yahoo want votes manufactured after election day to count.
"I'm ambivalent about #vz. I did sell out at $56 July 22 when the headlines were so abuzz with the #yhoo purchase I thought a little dip would be normal soon when the noise paused. I bought back at $54.50 today July 27. A bit silly, I know, but does capture 2+1/2 quarters of dividends.T and VZ are the big cash generators in telecom, and better #buyandhold bets than Sprint despite Sprints surprise recently.I'm half-weight in VZ, and I don't know what to think about the yahoo technologies they purchased. Will it be good, bad, or no-nevermind in the long run? I'm wondering what to do with my next bit of new money: fill out the VZ position, buy a half-weight in T instead for ""diversification"", or super-overweight LMRK which specializes in owning land under telecom towers and billboard signs, kinda like a REIT."
As a T holder I would like to thank VZ for giving T that extra 35 million that lets you spend 3 bill to buy junk !
dividend rise in less than a week - should net out around $60 by Oct 9-14
"Just curious, why do some people seem to hate the Yahoo part of VZ? Is it a political thing? I feel like I'm missing something here."
"So the sentiment on Verizon is, its gone from $47 in June to $55 (approx 17%) in August and with critical midterm elections looming and 5G still years off (2020?), this stock is going shoot into the $60s. I have made my bets, I will be buying back in after elections. Thoughts?"
"if vz price drop is for the altice announcement, its stupid, cablevision couldn't compete at lower prices, because their service sucked, both product and support. Adding additional speed still only adds to a horrible product. If VZ would offer fios to all areas the old cablevision had, Altice would loose more money."
VZ downWhy?They bought yahooThen charged it off as a stupid investment!T did the sameTelcos need to be telcos
Dayum.............Go Big Red.......................
Ex-dividend on Thurs.
"I love Ivanka. She works hard for women, having gotten better benefits for working women during the tax reform, and now for having gotten the President to sign a resolution for W-GDP. Which will help empower 50 million women in 100 countries with education and training, to help them get jobs that they have been KEPT from getting. The only downside is, with this many more workers coming to the workplace, the true benefactors will be the elites and vey rich, who will get the benefit of low wages. I hope she didn't get this idea at Davos. Please Ivanka, try to look at raising our standard of living, raising our income. Its long over due. Remember Warren wrote a book saying most couples were better off years ago, with one wage earner, and that bringing in vast numbers of women has helped profit the rich, and companies like Verizon with scores of low paid workers, more than bettering the standard of living of families."
"Bought 10,000 #VZ for End of day trade."
"Hans, Hans, Hans...my GOD the amount of BLOATWARE in Yahoo web pages. Has anyone ever looked at the script files for Yahoo web pages? It boggles the mind. More tracking and bloatware than ever. Time to toss this pig to the curb already. Lord knows you're trying to unload Huffington Post at FIRE SALE prices. Why not do the same with Yahoo? Better yet, why not just SPIN OFF Media and call it a day?"
Could we go over $60 tomorrow after knockout earnings in the morning BMO?
BY FAR THE MOST CORRUPT ENTITY IN THE NATION
Who's seeing a up trend in the next week with ex dividend date of 7/6?
"This downgrade is such transparent stock manipulation, so that the proprietary traders and big customers can buy it cheaper before the sector ETF changes later this month. The analyst said it was based on valuations - #$%$! PE of 7? Gimme a break."
Anyone else get a check from yahoo today? Mine $29.28. I believe this for when their email got hacked.

Verizon and Viacom CBS strike deal on Pluto TV https://deadline.com/2020/05/pluto-tv-verizon-streaming-distribution-deal-5g-1202925273/?src=tw

"Hillary says separating children at the border is a moral crisis. Ok Hillary, so why dint congress and Obama fix it when they controlled everything for years. The truth is you want unlimited for votes, and the Koch brothers and Verizon want millions of minimum wage workers. imagine being a Verizon board member, and doing everything you can to keep from paying your employees a decent wage."
"One of the incidents of corporate censorship that Croteau and Hoynes find to be ""the most disturbing"" in their view[7] is the news reporting in the U.S. of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which made fundamental changes to the limitations on ownership of media conglomerates within the U.S. and which was heavily lobbied for by media interests, and yet which was subject to, in Croteau and Hoynes words, ""remarkably little coverage"" by U.S. news media."
It needs nothing of the sort! Slow climb to continuous highs heading into a 5G world.
DEM COCO has left the building
"Boycott Verizon! Lowell McAdam has had VZ join the ""I'm An Immigrant"" campaign."" The truth behind this decision is that VZ is systematically replacing American workers (especially those that are white and over 50) with cheap labor of every kind, including H1B visa holders and immigrants who are less qualified than the person they are replacing. Meanwhile, Lowell pocketed a bonus of $12 million last year for destroying the lives of Americans who worked long and hard to make VZ the great company it once was. If you care at all about your fellow Americans, switch to another carrier, cable company, etc. I made the switch this week and have not experienced any change in the quality of service...and tell Lowell and his buddies at the top that if they want immigrants taking jobs in their company they should set an example and hand over their own jobs first."
When are they finalizing the acqusition of Viacom/CBS. I think this qill increase their businesses substantially
We won the Department of Energy 5G contract. We are the undisputed leader in 5G
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF VERIZON LOBOTOMIZED ALL THE VERIZON UNION SLOBS?. AMERICANS would drop all their other cellphone services and plans and join Verizon's network.
"VZ is up over a $1 a share today. What did they do, sell the Media division?"
"The Verizon ""Cloud"" service has been malfunctioning for over a month and we can't get a straight answer from support when it will ever be fixed."
"The Breakout is over.There is always a move higher in stocks that have big investor news. It's been like that forever. It's called the herd mentality.What happens next is a slow decline to the prior levels, unless there is good upword movement on the earnings front or other substantial news.You are hearing this from Elstockjock. I have been a market player for over forty years."
total dog ssssshhhhhhhtttttttttt...........only a trade....get stuck collect......VOMIT cant even hold 50.....i have made twice as much trading as collecting...............get rid of the morons hire a better staff...stock goes into the 60s.............
"listen as an investment, Coco P was 100% correct. This is just an annuity payment, a 4-5% dividend for life. never ever get above 61+. DOG MEAT"
"Going down the drain, Dump and never look back."
$T and $VZ getting big investors on board as they forge ahead with 5-G network plans. Legere remains Hamstrung.
"Someone posted earlier regarding VZ debt and if they could pay down the more expensive debt. I'm not an expert in the area of corporate bonds, but from what I know, many do not have a ""callable"" feature, meaning you can't cash them in early. Can someone chime in on this that is a debt expert; I was never much of a bond person."
Apple will buy Yahoo. $45 a share. VZ is a bad company.
$43 before April 10th please.
They would have never let Verizon buy Sprint
"Mr short seller: tax cut send huge money for Verizon, why don't you want it???????????"
"If VZ hits $60 by next ER,targets will be raised again! Choo Choo!LOL"
Feels good to bathe in this support in the lower end of its trading band. Thanks for Buffett reminding everyone of its current deep discount. Watch for the next leg up this week to $59-$60. Cheers!
"A lot of noise street of a pending correction coming. That could bode well for VZ and T as the exodus to safety occurs. Still holding long from 47 and 48. My belief is that the digital world still continue and that 5G and IOT are the places to be. When I travel the train at least 99% of everyone on board is checking their phones, watching something or doing whatever they do on the cell. VZ and T own a tone of that transmission and if not the texts and calls are going to someone on the other side who has VZ and #$%$ a data war and its best to go with the super powers."
"how is the wall street boys any different then CNBC, they are both manipulators of stocks and the VZ announcement of warren Buffet from December announced yesterday proves it was all manipulated"
VZ is definitely an underperformed today. ATT up 3.7% VZ up 1.8%. I own both.
Yikes! Verizon will be raising their dividend bigly. Sweet!

"all wireless EARNINGS report show: their sales have growth, but VZ are better than anyone, VZ won price war, the price sure be bottomed out, s , T-Mobile and t sales missed estimate, only VZ better than estimate, VZ got New customers more than them too, that means their low price plan didn't affect VZ, American economic strong growth, people have money, SO people trend to high ranking wireless network VZ, this trend sure be continue, SO VZ sales can continue growth, so strong buy VZ sure be make money, VZ can reach history high in short-term."
"Dear Verizon,Go out of business. You suck, and you are reaping what you sewed. You lie, cheat and steal from the little guys. You have tried screwing me over several times and I will never use any of your services every again. I let all my friends and family know every opportunity I get. This is why you will lose. You can't run a business like that. Tmobile and now Comcast is whopping your #$%$ and I can't wait to see you go bankrupt. Yahoo was an awesome company to buy. They suck just as much as you do. Did you even try our Yahoo Finance before buying the company? I have no clue what they did to one of the most popular financial sites on the internet in the past few years, but obviously your good ole' boy system didn't notice. Good luck idiots"
This a bargain at anything below $60. We will own the information highway for 5G. You have to pay the toll to take the trip!
The yahoo propaganda machine is in overdrive today--- posting news spew about that former Trump guy and how the economy is this and that..I just hope I can stock my foot so far up yahoo 's u know what later today
Sell Verizon. Buy At&t. More going for it.

Verizon Wireless offers false advertisement saying Unlimited is Unlimited. However the cap on the number of text messages you can send in a day per technical support is 400 to 500. After that they will Blacklist you on their network temporarily and eventually permanently. How is that Unlimited texting?
Still one of the most interesting charts. Verizon had a journey and it has a lot more to come i think.https://wallmine.com/nyse/vz/charts

"Verizon claims its not using any Huawei equipment for their 5g. Even if that is true, the number you are calling may be on a 5g system, or your call or email may have to travel over a 5g system infected with Huawei cyberware. Go ahead. Log into your bank account or broker account on your phone in 5g. See how long it takes till we start seeing massive data breeches as China will be getting millions of usernames and passwords delivered right to their monitoring equipment. That's what Huawei equipment is designed to do. The breech won't be obvious, and all the time. It will selectively and randomly transfer information, making it hard to detect. You'll be better off sending your next brokerage trade instruction by Wells Fargo Pony express."
10 X FASTER SPEED___ VZ GOING HIGHER !!
Beating earnings = Great day!
$45 is strong support. HOLD long-term for the 5G exposure and 5% dividend!
T Mobile is making these clowns look like the JV team.Need management shake up!!
"L VZ DOWN , DOWN , DOWN VZ goes , better get use to seeing lots of RED , RED, RED LOL,LOL,LOL"
THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS IS THE PRICE............MARKET DOUBLES THIS VOMIT 57 AGAIN.........
Here in today’s world Verizon is one of the media leaders in anti American views. Looking forward to seeing them go way down.

Yikes! What is happening???
Is the dividend payable today?
One important huge factor is it broke $50 today! In a huge down market.
Not one but several analysts and financial institutions Dow grade VZ but upgrade T. Also VZ rushes out it’s 5G but is not the ISO standard.
"i guess with the market on fire, a lousy 5% yield isnt worth the investment. these dividend blue chipd will look a lot mote attractive when the market corrects."
Can we please break out above 55?
Why is VZ down 2 percent today other than Cramer saying he likes the stock? T is only down fractionally so what gives?
"how is it T stock up .50 and VZ down, guess Buffet is a seller again"
Market up over 200 and this stock go’s down???
"I am looking at taking an investment in Verizon, does anybody realistically think Verizon can go higher with the amount of debt they have over 100b?"
"Generational wealth stocks, #AWK & VZ been holding strong. #VZ dividend deposited in accounts :-) thank you yahoo posters :-)"
"Can you see the future yet, T up 3% and going higher and higher , VZ down RED and dropping more and more , Why Because T's future is so bright you are going to need to wear shades, and sorry but VZ does not have a future because they did not change the business to compete in the new 5G world they now face"
"Although Verizon still benefits from a cost advantage over the smaller rivals and will still earn returns above its cost of capital, its ability to command premium pricing will decrease over time. $VZ https://www.finstead.com/bite/Verizon-Communications-VZ-earnings-preview-July-17-2018"
"vz can reach $75 per share in this winter, because vz can get a lot of customers from it's rival, 5g networks can help vz get more business too, T-Mobile and s will lose huge customers,,because their 5g networks still too far, plus and plus all wireless carriers monthly fee bottomed out, no more discount."
"Good VZ is DOWN and RED like the communist company VZ has become with their EU one world order Yahoo censoring NATZI's that are censoring what you can see ,read and post."
"I hope VZ gets hit with a multi billion dollar lawsuit for obstruction of justice after President Trump is re-elected. I will use the finance page but nothing else on yahoo Regardless of what their CEO states, they are taking the comments section off of their regular garbage based web page, so they can just cram down their Huffington Post and Daily beast hate speech against the President. Sick of this garbage."
"Joe Biden is not a perv, he only sniffs women and children because it makes him hard."

I wouldn't trade this. I'd buy and hold it. Great 5g Stock! Buy and put away for a year or two.
"Dumped Verizon wireless after over 20 years of service and switched to Xfinity Mobile. 2 phones monthly with Verizon, never the same, anywhere from $190 to $220 per month. Xfinity Mobile, same two phones, $130 per month, consistently. Good riddance."
whole system is one big joke here. Wall Street games all over the place again. We need massive collapse like December to put us back into reality. Wall Street and the rich need to be paying up to 30 to 40 % in taxes with their fast quick games. Trying to influence Federal Reserve with their manipulation games. i say crash and burn do away with Federal Reserve they have screwed savers for the last 11 years with very low savings rates.Enough already abolish Federal Reserve period. Never seen this massive manipulation to this extreme period. The rich already screwing the country with virtually paying very little taxes. Middle class getting completely screwed once again.Need to abolish Federal Reserve period.They are corrupt with these games.
VZ up for big break out. Present hold too long.
"I still believe Verizon needs to pay attention to their service. I am not only hearing bad things but I am experiencing bad things. We have 7 lines and every person on it, wants to leave Verizon. My belief now, is that all of them have bad service so why not go for the one that is least expensive? Our contract is ending at the end of the year and everyone is begging me to go to Sprint. Not because they have better service but because they also have bad service at half the price. Verizon needs to get their act together fast. I am not happy with 1G service in many areas when I should be getting 4Glte service and the phone part...don't get me started. They are the worst out of everyone. Missed calls all the time."
A quick reminder once again like you might have not heard it before === Been a long time investor of Verizon VZ. 35+ years. It never disappoints ever. My dad paid his new house off with part of VZ stock. I am over 55 and it's dividends have increased yoy. It's my largest holding. 200+k $$$ .. So it's being shorted. Who cares. It's a large income holding stock. That's it. Sorry if you didn't get in at $45 if it does I think you should.
Extreme downtrend continuing. Major selling pressure. Why?
"Rigged Game--I'm beginning to believe Bernie is right. Every time Wall St firms raise pps targets the stock(s) quickly drop 5-10%. As with VZ over the past month. I realize VZ is a ""value play"" but losing pps equal to 6 quarters of divvys in 4 weeks is not a value."
"Verizon says that 10,400 of its employees have accepted its buyout offer, representing roughly 7% of the company’s workforce.The carrier initially announced the buyout program in September as part of its effort to trim its workforce and better prepare for its launch of a high-speed 5G service nationally.It offered eligible employees and managers up to 60 weeks of salary as well and bonus and benefits, depending on how long they had been with the company. The program was offered to 44,000 employees across Verizon’s business segments. Those who chose to take the deal would have a final date at the company ranging from the end of 2018 through June 2019.The cost of its employee buyout plan will range between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion and will be recorded in the fourth quarter.Verizon Oath is essentially the creature of Frankenstein, a corporate alchemy experiment to fuse the properties of the companies formerly known as AOL and Yahoo into the larger behemoth known as Verizon. You can feel the terrible synergy emanating from the multiple firewalls it takes to get to our corporate resources. Verizon management and its cronies have an incredible penchant for making product decisions that turn users off. As a result, Verizon Oath expects to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of about $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter, which eats up most of Oath's previous goodwill balance of $4.8 billion.It's not all bad news for Verizon in the fourth quarter, however, as the company also said it expects to recognize a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of about $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter.Yahoo and Yahoo Finance expect to do a better job under Verizon transformation. Unfortunately, it is just another junk boxes."

VZ has taken some hits -- the $52.18 low and bounce back to $55 with the DOW dipping down over 2k points is a true demonstration of a defensive stock. I am very glad that a big chunk of my pile is in Big Red. Best bond equivalent you can buy...
s a shareholder here I am a little concerned with customers who have limited data useage switching from Verizon to other carriers with much lower price plans.
Is VZ a sell?
I think Buffett trimming on Apple and buying dividend stocks $VZ and $CVX might start a new rotation trend. Trim high-flying tech and move them to dividend stocks.
"Hahaha, VZ is such a bum stock, talk about an underperformer..."
VZ needs to dump Yahoo and AOL

Really good results 
I don't understand why it's down to $55+ per share...Big picture I guess the market felt the C BAN auction hit them
"it is important to point out that Verizon has a standing US Government support contract. Samsung is not an approved technology provider to the USG. They are an approved technical services provider. This means - in order to maintain its lucrative government contracts - $VZ 's pass through clauses will force Samsung to choose one of only two approved 5G technology providers: $NOK and/or $ERIC . This is a matter of law. $ERIC renewal as a tech provider was issued February 2020; $NOK renewal was June 2020. Keep an eye out for Samsung to make a subcontractor award to one of them, with the likely winner being $NOK - which has a standing large scale contact with $VZ already."

"I've told Uber how Verizon, ala yahoo, ala business insider has been attacking Uber over their drivers vomit fraud. I'm hoping as time goes by that these companies being targeted by Verizon will find a way to shut them up. I am suggesting to Uber that they change their phone service at their headquarters to a different supplier. I am suggesting to any US company that likes lower taxes, to change their phone service away from Verizon. and to have their HR department look at how they invest 401k money, and find a way to keep their employees from buying Verizon shares in their 401k. Verizon is trying to ruin all US business, as part of its globalist agenda. if they can try to ruin us business, then us business should be allowed to ruin them."
"VZ picked to stay only in the Commodities business , The major problem VZ now have is they are the highest cost producer of the Commodities LOL,LOL we all know how that turns out and for sure it's not good in the future LOL,LOL,LOL"
"As an investor in a number of mutual funds and ETF's having substantial financial investments in Verizon, I am concerned in Verizon's potential liability in its 5G roll out and its future growth based on 5G. How is Verizon addressing the potential health issues regarding EMF?There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that prolonged exposure to electromagnetic radiation has detrimental biological effects. Reported symptoms attributed to EMF exposure range from heart palpitations and disturbed sleep to headaches, fatigue, anxiety and an inability to concentrate, leading to the creation of the term ‘electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans."
"I TOLD you to sell VZ at $60.80, was an emotional run up. Now where to buy it back? 4% is a key yield, under 4% is not a buy on VZ. $60.25 = 4%$57.38 = 4.2% I want at least 4.2% yield."
"Sadly this is a good predictor that a near term Recession/Depression is at hand. All confidence in the market is GONE! D Trump will be a victim of this I fear , lucky to get 200 electoral college votes. His behavior, antics and wild management style cant be overlooked if the economy goes into a tailspin. Look for large layoff announcements and corporate bankruptcies esp from weak firms with excessive debt. So sad for us all."
selling today. it's been a good run from $44 but I'll wait for the next bottom. I thought we would see more of a bullish factor from 5g but AT&T ruined my party
Interested in your opinion. Is this a value stock or a growth stock?

SEC needs to investigate the inflated numbers that Yahoo's search bar does. When I search AAPL it shows some Yahoo finance employee.

It doesn't count the billions spent helping these people.The Emergency is not fake. And Verizon shareholders profit by a million people a year walking across, and some of them working for $10 an hour at Verizon phone centers. if I were a Verizon shareholder, I'd be sick to my stomach that Verizon, and yahoo finance are fighting against the wall, to garner a few pennies a share in earnings. Think of the extra Verizon revenues if many people stopped spending their cash on drugs, and bought higher cost phone plans from Verizon."

"Hurry buy VZ , Cramer says VZ is best of breed. The question you should be asking is how in the hell a company with way over $208 per share in debt could be best of breed at anything but debt. The Fact is VZ just spent what another $40 billion for bandwidth that will be added to the debt so what now each share of VZ has $250 in debt. WOW not the way you want debt to be going remind me of what happened at KODAK they stayed on the same path and could not see the future was changing. Say good by to VZ because if they don't start changing VZ will be one of Cramer's best of breed to out right disaster the list is very long of Cramer's disasters"

"So Verizon, your Yahoo division is at it again. Now they're saying he was ""dangerously low"" with his oxygen level. It never went below 94% saturation, which is, by itself, not a big deal.

But the way Yahoo reported it, and in fact added a second article titled ""President Pelosi"" in response to Pence campaigning, is downright disgusting.YAHOO SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN BY THE FCC FOR LYING AND FAKE NEWS."

"don't like verizons earnings ? complain at their annual meeting how they use Business insider, a liberal garbage mouthpiece as its yahoo news source, and costs Verizon tons of revenue money, when conservatives never click their links.

"I find it amazing that the novice retail investors drive a stock up based on Warren Buffet. His record is good long term and absolutely awful in the 1-3 year timeframe. Remember that this 13F filing is as of December 31, 2020. So he sold out of JPM in the $120-$125 range and now interest rates have gone up in the past 6 weeks and JPM has gained $20/share (15%) since 12/31/2020. Like I said ........I respect WB for his long term results but over the past 5 years his underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is quite a bad showing."

They aren't just targeting manual labor. They have their sites on every job. And then it wont matter if VZ marches to the agenda. Because then, all workers and management, and shareholders, will be replaced by a machine, and carbon units will be eliminated. And if anyone is working, it will be to serve a machine."

It provides wireless and wireline service to retail, enterprise and wholesale customers.The company’s wireless network serves approximately 120 million mobile connections with 115 million postpaid subscribers. Verizon’s wireline business has undergone a period of secular decline due to wireless substitution and cable competition. Verizon acquired AOL and Yahoo to create the Oath digital content platform.Verizon also provides converged communications, information and entertainment services over America’s most advanced fiber-optic network, and it delivers integrated business solutions to customers worldwide.Investors receive a 4.38% dividend.

VZ CEO on his 5G strategy
Is VZ still in business? Why VZ is starting to fall farther and farther behind to compete with T's 5G monster. Every day now VZ is losing ground to T. Why because the leaders of VZ did now have the vision or the guts to make the changes that were needed to compete in the new world they now face. Think Kodak and they took the easy path also and look where they ended up at.
52 week low going be tested soon. No projected growth for 2017. Other competitors taking away customers.
"Very Bullish outlook for VZ in 2021 with 5G Rollout nationally, should be $90-$100 at least by end of 2021."

"Unfortunately I have to tell one more bad news. The short interest of VZ has been relatively high in this stonk history, which means it will be a short squeeze tomorrow. If you are bag holders, don’t sell, congrats."
No what you do is you buy Quality stocks and stay the course. Oh and have cash.
"Survey: Yahoo should put comment boards back on ALL articles, THUMBS UP.Yahoo should NOT put any comment boards back, THUMBS DOWN."
Why does VZ screw around with Yahoo Finance views
Lots of room to raise that divy. Looks cheap
I am a newbie here: What is the difference between Verizon: VZ and VZA
Motley Fool article from Feb 17 coming true!
And yet another day begins with biased political bashing by the COWARDS at Yahoo/Verizon while not allowing conservative retort. Truly haters of America they are.
"it's time to buy VZ, because VZ 5G networks roll out next year, plus VZ price too low, VZ reasonable price is $58 per share."
Approaching 52wk high is good enough for now.
They should buy out frontier at bargain rebrand fios expand appreciate after 5 years it makes sense i mean it was their network to begin with
Look at the VZ chart for the last month and imagine where it would be without The Drumpf mania.
Why is freddie mac tanking
Trump creating inflation with the use of TARIFFS........................this country will come to a HALT soon.RECESSION made by TRUMP !
Time to squeeze the shorts like a lemon!
"Verizon Network to use GTX Corp to Enable GPS SmartSolesLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTX Corp (GTXO), an Internet of Things (IoT) solutions provider in the personal location, wearable and wandering assistive technology business, announced today that it has partnered with ORBCOMM Inc. (ORBC), a leading global provider of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and IoT solutions, to provide connectivity and distribution in the U.S. for its new Verizon GPS SmartSole product. SmartSole, which is launching this week, will be available for order on the ORBCOMM web platform, which will enable connectivity on the Verizon nationwide network as well as provide monthly billing services. GTX Corp's patented GPS SmartSoles, the world’s first wearable yet invisible tracking technology, are placed in the wearer’s shoes and contain a GPS module connected through a cellular network that sends a GPS location to a central monitoring website or app."
"TMUS acquired S for 26.5 billion and got customers as well as spectrum.VZ spent 50-60 billion and got spectrum while losing customers at the same time?Hans should focus on customer satisfaction,competitive pricing,cutting operating expenses etc.Instead of this ""One day over the rainbow,growth will be 2.5%"" #$%$He gots to go.He is another Steve Ballmer!"
Trying to do the math. A VZ share pays .615 cents dividend at 59.18/ ATT pays .52 dividend at 29.58 share price. Wouldn't you get nearly twice as many AT&T shares and payout nearly $1.00 for the 57.48 price of VZ? Giving you .39 more per two shares in the long run?
GO AHEAD BUY AMC SELL VZ AND MAKE BACK YOUR LOSES. DIAMOND HANDS BEATS WHAT VZ DONE TO YOU. BUY AMC
"These comments remind me of the bitcoin run-up. Get real. Also, if you haven't figured it out vz owns this yahoo junk."
I know once I sell this thing it will rocket to 60. Waste of time and money
"T just proved they have a future and VZ does not. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Why is VZ headquartered in New York instead of a state like Texas where there is no state income tax. AT&T and T-Mobile's headquarters are both in states where there is no state income tax.
Look out below!
"it should be about time that the Europeans start to claw for some return on their capital ... falling rates help keep a solid floor on the div payers , and the case with VZ is they are at a threshold of some growth over the next few years ... Unlike Perdue Pharma , the telecoms have everyone hooked and it's legal and it's okay with everyone hooked on their product ... garce"
T merger shouldn't affect us.... yet price drop. Well there you go.
In the short-term VZ does not seem to be like a good trade. if you guys have questions you should ask awesome-STOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
Stock is going to 65
Crashing slowly to 40’s.
closing 5 call centers. Less Union employees for the next go around.
"$60 ,a serious psychology barrier here will VZ just drift back like it always does or will other stock being out of favor finally attract enough interest for a double digit P/E ?Back to 55 or up to 75"
Didnt VZ close @ 55.4 yesterday?
@Well if things keep Going this way my House will be paid off within a year. HA!
This one will be back in the 60s soon.
Most stupid trading markets ever. These markets are due for one massive free fall here. Same old games pump and dump back and forth with thousands of point up and down Federal Reserve is at fault with their stupid manipulation games. Every time markets fall big they cut rates. Trying to screw savers once again and push them into stock market. Enough already abolish the FED period.

Would u guys say this is a good investment for mostly dividend revenue I plan to invest a set amount a year and then take the dividend revenue and reinvest it for however long is that a good decision?
If Verizon bumps up the Dividend shorts better cover...
It seems to be related to the Samsung recall. Verizon sold a lot of them and is now offering to replace them. Supposedly not a biggey.
"Spreading rumor, unfounded info anf innuendo in order to stoke the fires of distrust throughout the country..."
"inflation coming. shrinks fixed debt, supposedly."
Looks like the teams are set ATT with MSFT and VZ with Google. Certainly will be interesting to see what comes in 5 years or so.
"Over $80 BILLION spent on C-band auction, which is nearly over. From other articles I'm reading the total could be closer to $100 BILLION once you include the compensation to satellite companies for giving up spectrum in C-band. If I had to estimate, Verizon spent well north of $30 billion, probably closer to $40 billion. As I back my posts with FACTS, read on: https://www.barrons.com/articles/a-record-breaking-5g-spectrum-auction-is-nearly-done-what-it-means-for-at-t-verizon-and-t-mobile-51610476201"
too big a drop for small rate change..
it looks cheap and more rooms to go 50+good yield over 5% + coming 10% share price upat least 15%
Geez. Is Verizon going out of business soon?!? Thats how the Street is treating the stock. Totally oversold.
Maybe this stock needs to be discussed on Reddit rather than Yahoo???
"For several years now, when i try to look up a stock quote on yahoo finance, i have to wait for a long time for the symbols to load. If i do it before then it takes me to an outside yahoo search engine and never gives me a quote, or a quote for something totally different. . What i do is then type it into google and i get the link to the yahoo finance quote. What kind of company makes you use a competitor to get the information from their site? Yahoo needs to totally recode their ticker search. How much they paying google to redirect people, back to the Yahoo site that they were already on? Really no excuse for this."

About time for a pull back.
"5/11/18-- JP Morgan upgrades Verizon, (gives $58 Target Price-5% Dividend Yield) says hefty dividend and 5G plans will boost shares J.P. Morgan upgrades Verizon to overweight from neutral and holds its price target steady based on a solid dividend and upcoming 5G clarity. ""Verizon seems to be the one carrier that is heads down, executing on the business,"" analyst Philip Cusick wrote Friday. Cusick added that Verizon has no plan to establish its own video streaming platform but it plans to announce a partnership soon. Verizon Communications shares should rise this year as a healthy dividend yield lures investors ahead of clarity on its path for 5G wireless, according to J.P. Morgan.The firm raised its rating on the company's shares to overweight from neutral, foreseeing a better competitive climate over the next 12 months.""Verizon seems to be the one carrier that is heads down, executing on the business, and could see its share improve commensurately,"" analyst Philip Cusick wrote Friday. ""We have an increased level of confidence that revenue can stabilize and potentially start to grow. Given the potential issues and distractions of its wireless competitors, we are less negative on the overall wireless industry.""The J.P. Morgan team – which recently held a meeting with Verizon chief executive Lowell McAdam – said the company could introduce a number of mobile 5G handsets in 2019. The long-term goal focuses on developing industrial applications, such as smart cities, connected cars and Internet of Things.The 5 percent dividend yield on Verizon shares should also attract investors, the analyst said, despite the 10-year Treasury note yield's recent move toward 3 percent.""If rates continue higher, Verizon with a 5 percent yield could struggle. We would balance this though with the defensive nature of the business, its 66 percent payout ratio and high dividend yield, and declining leverage,"" Cusick wrote. ""We believe that from this price, when including the dividend, Verizon shares should outperform in a flat to falling market.""The analyst held his 12-month price target steady at $58, implying 22 percent upside over the next year. Verizon's stock is down 10 percent since January, though shares were up nearly 1.5 percent in premarket trading Friday."
I actually saw an news story on yahoo that used the f word in the article 2 times I guess if is from huffy puffy that is ok.
"Same old FEd games always want to prop up markets when they crash with interest rate cuts, All this does is once again screw the savers who choose money market rates etc. Stay out of free market system with these manipulation games period, I say markets crash and burn when needed like now. So over priced with these games once again."
"I have to agree that Yahoo is nothing beyond clickbait. I blame Marissa Meyer but VZ has done nothing to bring it back to something substantive in News/ & Finance. It used to be much better, now its just ads on top of ads and NO MEAT!Yesterdays news and fluff finance news! They are phoning it in. Hans needs to be Hans-On!"
Warren buffett sold it all
ZM is down too............???????????
"looks like even a huge up market and buffet in it cant move a stock up, VZ is a dog..make more playing bit coin or GME"
what do you think of #vz buying #yhoo ?
Going to take off soon! Get ready to make money! VZ upgraded today in a bad market. Looks good for shareholders.
"Yahoo Finance, propaganda arm of Verizon, says the left and right is rejecting capitalism. That's cool.When we nationalize Verizon, we will all share in its 215 billion market cap. That's what socialists do. they steal from people, and companies. Enjoy your 4% Verizon dividend, while the company you invest in promotes globalism and socialism."
Up 2% in after hours. Happy but it may or may not mean anything.
"This company needs someone who has the ability to improve the company on its own with out ""teaming"" and riding on the shoulders of others to make it appear as if your running the race !"
"I finally bought some VZ, having ignored it for many years. Why the change of heart? VZ is a core component of what allows us to function in this pandemic. Debt level is high but with cheap money, it is manageable and the dividend yield is nice. IMHO. God Bless and stay well all."
"VZ move to acquire the low-end, low-magin, budgets oriented wireless business of a Mexican company seems contrary to industry trends. Companies like VZ and AT&T want high-end, high-margin, premium oriented customers. If anything, VZ has helped its competitors by eliminating economy grade service providers."
"Looks like double bottom at $48 on charts....if it fails, then $44. I got super lucky and was able to shjort 1000 shares in AH at $50.72....woke up to earnings and a day later made $3k! I bought 1000k shares at 448.02....think it bounces, but alot may depend on T news Monday."
"Momentum turning down. Sold half of position at 53 and change. Taking a break from here and buying at lower price. Dividend not enough to offset price drop, IMO.GI"
5G ...$65 with nice divi...take it
"Maybe the sell-shorters are trying with VZ now due to their loss with GME and BBBY? Those who are long, hold the fort, we will win."
"Verizon beats by $0.05, beats on revs; raises FY18 revenue due to better-than-expected equipment revenue trends, reaffirms EPS"
"I notice a few things in the present w verizon.. 1. 5g is important... very, however, I am unsure exactly how. 2. Stock is low beta and increases dividend w a 50% payout.. which means they can incease div in anticpation of earnings catching up in future, if they so choose.. 3. the next leg up with break through its longterm 20 yr high, which is very significant.. look at microsoft over last few years since they accomplished that feat. 4. siginificant insider buying last 6 months.. 15 mill worth. 5. intrinsic value is over 100.."
vz safest stock to hold in any economy
"Yahoo Finance screen allows the fake flash virus loader to start self installing.Wonder how secure customer accounts at Verizon are, considering how little they think of peoples security."
"I’m wondering when/if the effects of 5G start to make their way into earnings. Who knows, maybe we get lucky and this is the day we find out 5G is starting to have a positive effect on earnings. Of course that is wishful thinking lol I will just be happy with meeting expectations, solid dividend, and continued upward trajectory haha We will see soon. GLTA"
"Verizon opened up a huge store front business across from where I work, I don't think they will be opened more than a month or two. We counted walk in customers for past week, customers were few and very far between. The five salaries and expensive mall rent must be at least one hundred times what the vz store can ever make there"
overvalued aging massive lump of lard
"China Joe, AOC and ISIS wives only need other peoples money, Yahoo trash anti Trump articlesstill the majority of loser left Yahoo news, which no one reads anymore."
VZ will beat and guide higher tomorrow. They have the best service.
"@giacomo I think it's just the nature of ""big News"". people get really excited and drive the price up. the emotion of excitement goes away and we are left with a decent but not stellar earnings quarter. a 1% gain is justified. I'm long on vz. I think 5g has huge growth opportunities. but I'm content with a positive quarter"
I knew VZ was going to be up today after hearing the news over the weekend that Rubio and Corker were going to vote for the tax bill.

VZ will go to 52 ? what's the story ?
Bribing Biden all be going to China soon to campaign and fill his pockets and Hunters crack pipe.
"VZ pushing mmWave. Problem, it really can't travel more than a few feet and can't penetrate walls. So, what good is it except in open environments such as stadiums and malls. Will 5G users really be stuck with just low band? If so, why buy a 5G phone?"
Hans announcing more vz give aways. shareholders get a smaller div increase every year.
"In the telecom sector, Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson LLC projects that Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ - Get Report) will gain 80 cents per share in 2018 earnings because of the bill. The analyst upped his EPS forecast more than 20% from $3.87 under the current tax rules to $4.67 per share under the new plan..........2018 looks to be a good year for VZ!"
"IOT is a generic term.VZ does not have a monopoly on plant WIFI systems.What is unique about what VZ can offer plant communications?The big growth driver of 5G will be autonomous vehicles.That infrastructure,is far into the future and by then all the hardware VZ bought will be near the end of its service life and all the software will need upgrades.Wanna cash in on IOT?Try PLTR or another company that offers security software.Hans gotta GO!"
"VZ -NEW Price TARGET-$56.00------When it comes to telecom, Goldman Sachs prefers Verizon Communications (VZ) and Charter Communications (CHTR). Analyst Brett Feldman upgraded both stocks to Buy from Neutral on Thursday, adding $5 to his Verizon price target, which now stands at $56,"
"Well if you reinvest your dividends it will eventually double, in about a hundred years."
Here wee go again the Federal Reserve screwing investors/savers to try to hold up Wall Street. THey play these games every time to force savers into stock markets. Here and now we need to abolish the Federal Reserve for market manipulation games as usual. Done always to try to hold up markets. Wake up America we need to abolish the FED today period. Make them pay for manipulation of markets.
VZ is down 5.03% to 52.29
"the 2nd worst pos i have.......%5...in a pos that never goes up ...in a market thats tripled....ORC...pays %17 ...never goes any place either............i get %1.4 per month and have been in it for a long time 20,000 shares 9s...10s...11s....(2800 per mo.)..."
Wake up America. Wall Street manipulating stock up by buying sectors /Indexes which in turn takes others up. All this for just greed. End game one massive collapse like 2008 all over again. Fed will be responsible for this manipulation of markets by lowering prime rate forcing investors into market. This will be the greatest slaughter that has ever happened.
"They better do something to ""RIGHT THIS SHIP"" competition is gonna eat their lunch."

nice pop to day...but don`t get too excited...it likes the 40 range not the 50 rangea good stradegy is to collect the dividend and now sell the 50 calls (covered) 30 dys out about .75 premie
Company is garbage
Dividend looks even better now. Thanks for the downgrade.
Come on VZ.. This should be over $50.. HOD over $51
VZ reached a 52 Week low at 51.62
One big joke markets recovering here. So much down side to go here.One big joke because of employment of 1.3 million. Look at 30 million unemployed.
"I'll educate you people just a little bit. You do know most construction aka, 5G in this case occurs in the 4th quarter bc ...

"Here, we turned to TipRanks' Analysts' Top Stocks tool to source the most recommended stocks on Wall Street. The verdict: best-performing analysts across the Street believe these investments will bolster your portfolio. This 'Strong Buy' tech stock has won the attention of five top ranked analysts, who have all recently upgraded their recommendations to Buy for Verizon."
"American economic continue growth will be bring more foreigners come to American, these people are immigrant and non immigrant, plus American population growth, SO American wireless market will be add at least 4million customers in 2018, SO buy Verizon sure be make money, because it's stock price too low, it's reasonable price is $57 per share,"
"How propaganda machine Yahoo Finance, owned by Verizon, belittling Mr. Trump for having Merry Christmas signs at a recent event. Now the story to the right of this page was from the AP, which apparently now means Associated Pagans. SO why would Verizon shareholders invest in a company that knocks and belittles Christians ? If you have any morals and values, you ought to think about the garbage that you as a shareholder are enabling."
Q2 composite est. is $1.19 up from $.98 YOY for non GAAP Operating Income which approximates cash flow. That's it in percentage terms -- cash flow up 21.4% YOY due to organic growth and the Trump tax cut. We should see this baby up nicely Q@ market willing. Even in the face of rising rates VZ is the premier bond proxy with intrinsic upside as 5G layers on revenue. Later this year we should start to see how smart cities systems can work in 5G -- digital cameras with lots of features like motion or sound detection. Illinois will give any kind of rights of way they have to get smart city tech in Chicago. And the brave techs who will install it -- in the mornings.
A truly worthless stock. It is great for the dividends but a years worth of dividends can be lost in a single day. The last two decades have seen almost no change in value.

"Hey, Hans, why not let Yahoo turn its comments back on? Why not? People would like to read about the TRUTH for once. Mixed in with all the vitriolic, hating posts from both sides of the aisle are occasional gems about the truth. Yes, they are there, and I've authored a few of them. So why not bring them back now that the election is over? What are you AFRAID of?"
I tried a congrats post to you know who but it was deleted. I assume it is a Q of buzz words -- so congrats Pres D. J. Buzzword.
"The Q is if $60 is becoming the floor instead of the ceiling?I see that the ttm Operating Margin is 24.07% - I believe that is a slight improvement from the high 23.97% prior to Q3 being booked. The big 10,400 supervisor/manager buyout ran thru the books ending Q2, VZ said. I look for that number to get a boost from the Tracfone add - new 4g volume laid on VZ's 4g being built for the IoT. Let's hope the tax man doesn't come calling too soon, I'm a low tax kinda guy.I saw that Michael J Fox said that Biff grew up to be President. That's funny even if you're a low tax guy."
"I posted this earlier as a reply on this board, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it should stand alone.Verizon needs a Microsoft-like Nadella at the helm, and then anything is possible. You think I'm crazy...look at Microsoft's stock price under Ballmer, then look at under Nadella. No comparison. Note that Nadella took over in early 2014. I'll give you a hint - the stock did basically nothing under Ballmer, and then starting in 2014 shot up 800% to roughly $230 a share today. All from a ""stodgy old company"" that couldn't grow any more. Same thing many of you are saying about Verizon.Time for Verizon's Board of Directors to WAKE UP and take action. It may really be that simple."
I sold my Verizon shares and bought T before the announcement in June. I'd rather be in T at this point.
Hmm after upgrade no movement
Whole stock market system is broken period. Its all the Feds game with rates the last 11 years .Have screwed savers with low rates the last 11 years. Now doing it again. Stay out of a supposedly free market system with their rate cut games. How about raising rates back to normal. All this to try to save a bankrupt U.S. Yes we are bankrupt look at our debt.Whole system is broke. The rich pay lower taxes etc. Middle class gets screwed with higher taxes.Poor pay no taxes. What a system its broken period.

"Yahoo Finance has 4 reasons its a bad idea to cancel student debt. Actually theres probably dozens. In a world of economic equality, why is it fair to give some students tens of thousands of dollars to cancel debt, and not give any reward to everyone who never borrowed to go to school.Why give someone who is getting a bachelors degree tens of thousands in debt relief, when over their lifetime, they will make a million more than people who didn't go to college.Only 4 in 10 adults under age 30 have student debt. That means 6 in 10 adults under age 30 will be getting taxed more to pay it off.If its reaching a crisis, why are the banks allowed to continue lending ?If banks cut back their lending, some people would not be going to college, and tuition rates would have to drop to keep enrollment up. You fix something, in this case we fix college gouging, by letting it take its natural course. Isn't it nice that Warren is demanding help. Wonder if Harvard has told her if she doesn't campaign for debt relief, of which Harvard could lose millions, or Harvard may let her application become public. Isn't she acting in a conflict of interest to her employer ???"
I hope Verizon goes BK
Verizon was only able to pay dividends in 2016 by selling of $6.1 billion assets.Verizon cannot continue to pay their dividends.

in the bag is $51Post X Day is so much funNormal is to watch decreaseThe newbies aghast at being fleeced
here we go again Wall Street trying ti pump up markets again. Never ending greed/games. Downside side far outweighs any upside here.
its indicating a strong buy!!!!
"There's always 2 VZ haters so I came up w The Sing along song: Bad Boys Bad Boys, What's cha gonna Do. What's cha gonna Do when Verizon comes after you... Bad Boys Bad Boys, 75 Million Dis+ Streaming Scripts, What's cha gonna do, what's cha gonna do if Dis+ comes after you?!? hahaahaaaa. Good luck if you weren't in..."
bye bye shorts it's China bye time and USA buy time and guess what there are few as strong as VZ.
"Say OH NO down VZ goes , Cramer's best for breed to now out right disaster"
Will be $61 tomorrow. Watch and see...
"for 3 years VZ has been beaten up by the freak CEO from germanys Tmobile. Its time for this loser to GO AWAY. mcadam is a whimp...WIth a kick #$%$ ceo, VZ could have been an 80 dollar stock today. GE got rid of #$%$ immelt, and now mcadam must go before VZ is BACK IN THE 30'S"
Yahoo and Verizon have managed to take a far left position... Just silly knowing how many people they have now alienated. Simply not good business allowing a few employees to dictate the overall narrative...
i just sold my vz in ah and bought t. Did i do the right thing?
As long as Lowell and his cronies are in Verizon this stock will come down for sure.
Dem Rats a bunch of thieving corrupt lawyers with cesspool states and cites on big government handouts thatmade them rich living in gated communities.
We are going up high today 58.00 by close
Can anyone explain to me why the CEO Lowell McAdams gets a pass all these years when he has done nothing but make bad decisions? When are people going to wake up and start calling for his head?????
"One thing I've observed with Verizon - it's a great stock if you want to write covered calls week in and week out. I was doing that for about 6 months against 1000 of my shares (10 contracts). I did this week after week. I was never called out, and after 6 months earned about another 15% on my investment. It was the one reason I was considering keeping the stock - the low beta meant you'd get a small premium, but the odds of being called out were equally low. And you knew which weeks to sit out - whenever the funds stepped in to capture dividend, you stay away (about 2 weeks per quarter). Easy money, probably get called out 1 to 2 times per year, but the amount lost will be minimal so my estimate is 20-25% premium capture per year."
"According to online survey, 10.45% people voted $T (AT&T) as their favorite wireless carrier, while 19.39% voted for $VZ (Verizon). According to Finstead website, as expected, Quarterly Revenue Growth of $VZ is higher than that of $T. So, it is better to invest $VZ?"
Dog with flees
"You don't know how a final tax bill will look, and you don't know if it will pass. Trying to pass it before the Dec 13 special election in Alabama may help with a couple of the ladies - Maine & Alaska - to vote for it so it doesn't get embroiled with Roy Moore -- they probably don't want to put the Senate in the position of needing his vote to pass it. If the house bill version holds than firms with big capital investments are going to get a tax shelter from 100% first year tax deduction. That will be great for VZ:""For the next five years, the House bill will allow businesses to immediately expense the full cost of most assets; really, anything with a life of 20 years or less. This should allow for the expansion of capital investment, and most economists are confident that the move will do as much to boost the economy as any single change in the proposal."""
Verizon yahoo is it liberty or lockdown for your shareholders
I’m not sure what drips and dips are could someone explain?

VZ now owns Yahoo & AOL.A SAD day in around the world
Earning 7 a share. Only paying out 2.36 a share in divy. Vz is cheAp
Why would Verizon Partner with something as divisive & toxic as The Clinton Foundation??!!There are plenty of other ways to to go woke without tying yourself to the Clinton slush fund.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clinton-foundation-verizon-partner-promote-152100141.html
It's a 10-15 year buy and hold foundation investment.
Hammer Fiber (HMMR) breaking through its 200-day moving average.....pre 5G telecom play launching service in Africa and Dominica right now. Check out chart of HMMR....worth gamble for any telecom traders
"now that yahoo (left of stalin) is owned by vz, some of us that are conservatives will be saying goodbye to vz."
There you go
"Apple also kissing up to Verizon because they see the value of the network for their products. They want everyone to sign up for Apple One, which will be another great value stream for Apple. $30 a month for a family plan...just think what that will bring in to Apple over the next few years? Billions. Yes, I own Apple stock (have for 15+ years)."
This will go up big next week
Think of VZ as a 30 yr. bond paying a 4% interest rate. 22 years ago the share price was $53... 8 years from now the share price will be about the same.
dont panic - verizon died
"No 5g to speak of this stock needs to wake up, shareholders deserve better."
"malone hints verizon being gateway for content holders without all the risk, option action + this news implies some big news coming out soon!"
VZ and yahoo are just mouthpieces for the dim party. What benefit does socialism have for VZ shareholders?
VZ ot T
"for all those who own Verizon Stock, do not feel bad for John Stratton for not being selected the CEO/Chairman, he received a Sep Payment of $5.5 million and is owed over $22 million in future stock payouts, but it gets better Tim Armstrong's Sep Payment was $6.3 million and is over $23 million in future stock payouts"
My crystal ball suggest that sell Verizon on Monday and buy back on Tuesday or Wednesday.
I am not sure what Buffet sees in $VZ and $KO they have been dead for years.
Great time to buy
"Ever heard of a ""small"" company called DISH?They have the spectrum, and just this week secured thousands of 5G towers, and will imminently launch a new nationwide cellular carrier.The monsters VZ and T are going to have competition from a ""startup"" ?DISH is currently only known for satellite dishes, so the stock is dirt cheap.I don't know about Buffet, but I'm accumulating."
SAFETY PLAY.......

"Verizon shareholder for 30 years, time to move on. It has been good because of the dividends but they cannot compete with the big boys anymore. When they hang around Yahoo you realize they are on the wrong side of the tracks. Just like AT&T with Time Warner. Trump don't like either company and Trump is King for now."
CTL getting 4th carrier from TMUS rumor and trading backhaul for spectrum. CTL up on news.
worse week ever so slow stock
Underperformer during bull market and doesn't hold up during bad times. No reason to own this garbage.
Up because of earnings rumors?
"Vanguard and BlackRock collectively own about 12% of VZ's shares. Probably should see what their view is on VZ stock performance and its Media group. Vanguard tends to be less activist, but BlackRock, well, they do like to get involved."
Close $60.02
I’d almost rather Verizon did away with the dividend and reinvested for more growth and stock buybacks.
"Verizon is working overtime, trying to help the globalists overthrow Trump, with Yahoo Finance having 3 more lies on these pages today. Too bad Verizon doesn't concentrate on their business, and concentrate on making money, like they promised, for their shareholders. Too bad Verizons lame attempt at stopping robo calls has failed. Too bad part of your Verizon plan cost is helping to pay for robo calls. Don't you realize if there were no robo calls, all the carries could reduce phone rates ?"
"Investors rewarded Verizon Communications stock for most of 2018, as the telecom giant grew leaner, meaner, and more focused."
"Only 140,800,000 $VZ subs that fit the 'under 4 movies a month' model of the 88% of MP subs now. Only 140 million."
"VZ is cyclical. Wait until it spikes. It inevitably does. Then, sell if you must. Sure, there are high fliers out there, but depending on your tax situation, you'll probably be taxed on the gain. The same can be said for bank interest. However, qualified dividends, once again depending on your tax status, may not be taxable. This is a dividend stock, not a stock for fast returns."
No one will be buying this stock for a while. maybe close to the next ex divy date. Too much uncertainty.
buying buying buying I'm going to keep buying VZ 
"Get ready to say OH NO Han's cut the dividend LOL,LOL,LOL They get ready to SAY OH NO DOWN VZ goes like the communist company VZ has become LOL,LOL,LOL,"
Thank You for 46.05BBBUUUUYYYYYYYY
So why has Verizon been taking a craper this week ? Losing too many customers ?
VZ stock slips in premarket as investors that don't like money flee to buy more Tesla stock.
"VZ's short term, mid term, long term charts are not very good. BUT, if you look at its VERY long (multi-decade) term chart, it's bumping up against its all-time high, which may be auspicious. I say ""may"" because VZ's new CEO, Hans Vestberg, has now done all his big cost cutting and has still managed to missed earning estimates this quarter. He didn't do a very good job at Ericsson either, where, according to Wikipedia, ""Ericsson ousted Vestberg on July 25, 2016, following poor financial results."" The question is, has he learned anything from that ousting? If he keeps missing earnings, he hasn't. Hope he has learned. We shall see."
double top at 60
"will just buy more, this thing is really undervalued IMO"
Great quarter and year Big Red............outlook for 2020 excellent.............
i will remind you all of this june news post. Shorts will cover and see 63 in June.
Could close at new 52 wk high today.
"Congrats longs! Solid results. Wireless revenue up 5.5% to $22.4 billion. Postpaid smartphone net additions were 398,000!https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/verizon-q2-2018-earnings/amp/"
"As was often said in pool halls in Chicago, ""Don't be a hustler kid, own the pool hall.""Where are the flamers today?"
"Dude, they’ve paid you near $20 in dividends per share. You can’t ignore that! Plus the $6 at today’s $56 close. That’s 50% in 8 yrs. Not 11%! As a passive investment, I will agree though. At a 10% return, you’d double in 7.2 years.Hence, why VZ is a swing trade. But in retirement I’d love the 4.5% return. Better than a bank and more staying power."
G-5 will send VZ into 60-70 range. Dividend increaseWhile interest rates are going down will also help
I was going to buy this stock for the dividend today but now I don't think I am. Market is too shaky and Trump isn't backing down on this trade thing with China. Guess I'm going to pass.
The valuation should have been cut in half given the Yahoo Message board and Finance page disaster. It use to be my main go to home for finance and messaging...now I have moved on.

Looks like buyers coming back for safety!!!
The runway looks clear -- the analyst ests. are all up in the last 30 days. VZ has subscriber growth and revenue growth back -- 2017 was a no growth yr as predicted by mgt. VZ needs to maintain sub growth -- SG&A was down YOY because of the effects of the 5 yr expense reduction plan -- should start to see bibber YOY reduction of SG&A Q4 and next yr. Hopefully in 2021 we start to see 5G revenue to break above $60.
"Better learn to say OH NO down VZ goes , because it's going a lot lower. LOL,LOL,LOL just wait until next earnings call and you get to see how many customers VZ has lost to T's monster LOL,LOL,LOL"
Let's use a sports analogy to explain the silliness of the sell-off in Verizon.Let's say that Sprint was the Cincinnati Bengals who finished 2 and 14.... And T-Mobile was the Washington Redskins who finished 3 and 13 now let's say they decided to merge.... somehow I don't think either the Kansas City Chiefs or the San Francisco 49ers would restructure and rethink their game plans based upon this merger ...that's how silly the sell-off in Verizon is
"Worst stock to bag-hold , actually top of the list among Strong Sell."
Looks like ‘loud mouth’ LeGere is going to be ceo of wework. Poor wework. Legere’s MOA is to lower prices to zero in order to increase sales!! Make it all up on volume? He knows what TMUS service is worth!
yay back up
50 DMA just crossed 200 DMA. RSI 57
Where is VZ headed?
You will never hit a homerun with Verizon. But if you want to earn 5%-10% per year and collect the juicy dividends then verizon is the place to be. Going forward I still think Verizon will acquire Comcast or CBS as AT&T did with CNN.
I am picking up some every 30-40 cent drop.
VZ going to see the same fate as t when they report losses due to cord cutting?
"If you are mad at the way things are, instead of targeting the Police, why not visit the Verizon building on Race Street in Philadelphia, and thank them for taking your jobs, and giving them to people who crossed the border."

Too bad I dont have more of this in my portfolio. Good ol trusty Verizon 
"Verizon X-Date Jan 6, 2018. Quarterly Dividend. Time to buy !"
We might need a harsh landing as the FED has to struggle and keeps falling behind with the rate hikes. I do not see why FED keeps acting like a great grandma caring and loving towards riskier assets when the markets do not care about any negative events and always go up on bad news as well as good news. FED should focus on its duty to bring the rates to normalcy as soon as possible. Now it is over a decades since unnecessary rate cuts were pushed on to people and banks.
What is a Blurrg on Starwars you ask? Disney Plus+ baba. ..
Untested 5G safety will be the end of humanity. $T $S $VZ $TMUS
does vz hand out yearly stock options and bonus stocks in Feb each year. Trying to figure out how many stocks will they have to buy and distribute among 160K employees they have.
"BOYCOTT VZ, SUPPRESSING FREE SPEECH."
"This stock is ridiculously low here. Earnings will be up year over year for the next three quarters because of tax reform and it is trading at a PE of 1/3 the market. Buy here, collect your Divs and wait for some sanity to come back to the market. I believe it will trade at $60 within 12 months."
Maybe VZ will buy Chrome
VZ should be over $60!!!
"LOL,LOL,LOL DOWN , DOWn , DOWN VZ goes , Why because VZ has no future as T's 5G monster eats VZ ALIVE LOL,LOL,LOL"
Regardless of VZ earnings. Coco P will always schuk.
"If you look at the 5 year timeline for VZ stock, its pretty much gone nowhere. Has VZ become just a dividend play like KO ?"
"weak weak weak,,, this stock has no strength in huge up days, whats the issue, lack of buying, no 401k money at all coming in, institutions are only covering the BA shares they were burned on,"
"Verizon, you seem to be publishing an abundance of doom and gloom articles from right wing conservatives in the Yahoo business section. This is of no help to serious people looking for investment information as these people have repeatedly put their conservative biases over reality. You can do better VZ."
"hey where is Coco P--- this DOG stock can never trade below that 4% dividend yield.This upgrade is a SELL signal, especially with liberal yahoo and those raggy fake news divisions."
anyone know if VZ going to buy SiRI ? to increase their bottom line
BUYER under59.00
i sold this morn and bought T.
HMNY........do your DD and make lots of $$$$$$$
65$ target price
Great balance sheet and solid dividend. Don’t stress it.
54 here we come!!!!
massive breaking news. time to load up i think. For such a cheap stock PRHL just announced some monster projections. No one has really noticed yet so it could be the perfect hidden gem.
"$62 median target , $70 high , good upside , an excellent dividend"
Is Yahoo part of Verizon now?
"I just switched from Verizon Wireless to Xfinity Mobile. My bill was cut in half. Same network. So if Comcast is making money, Verizon is just price gouging."
I mean plus $.70 cents
"I would be doing any business with VZ anymore . They are now censoring Americans and look like they have been taken over by the EU one world order, Action speak volumes , If you can not trust VZ to respect the USA First Amendment the for sure VZ can no longer be trust to protect your data, All cause by VZ own actions. You don't even need to make things up when their own action dictate what is now happening"
This moves inverse to exuberance. When thing are hot it gets overlooked but when there's profit-taking they park money here as a defense with dividends.
"VZ is in the right focus. Needs to become a strictly data pipeline company. Drop the amount of employees worldwide, dropping 50k employees generates over $5 fcf the year after it occurs, needs to stay out of content, rollout 5g, fios, isp backhauling."
VZ is a great stock even though maket undervalues it...nice balance to a porfolio with overpriced no dividend growth stocks like amazon google and netflix. ( also good but different stocks)
"Sold off most of my VZ, over 500 grand due to skyfi and investing in disruptive technologies. between Bitcoin and all the mining companies my 500 grand is now 7 figures. F VZ and be like me.

Now i'm a regular on Bezinga. Soon im starting my own Youtube channel Rick Knows. GLTA and bye VZ and your little 4% dividend #$%$ If inflation is 10% your gonna need to diversify plus we all know about EMF radiation and Brain cancer, right folks? STOP PUTTING PHONE TO YOUR HEAD GENUIS'S and F VZ and their #$%$ managers who dont have a clue about the business. Remarks of a retired VZ worker of 34 years and ive sat with the board as a union thug. Just look at those tickers and say, I wish he was my broker. For your next winners go to youtube and look up Monster stock Picks and you may be surprised that we're better than your brokers for free. Next winner id CLWD and dont laugh about a 2 cent stock, cause it will hit a dollar soon enough"
THIS STOCK SUCKS!!!!!!!!
Time for a 2:1 split?
nice article today on seekalpha talking about stocks and tax reform. A 15% rate gives VZ a one time $26B tax liability gain. VZ gets the largest gain of any Dow stock. VZ also would get ongoing lower rates and pays near the top end right now as well.Warren Buffett bought into airlines and Apple after the election due to tax reform. wonder if he will also bight on VZ
Verizon needs to jack up their dividend bigly.
Bargain
Isn't anyone concerned about the upcoming fed rate increases impact on Verizon share price?
coco gives good HD... dem truth hurts
if you buy att today or tomorrow you get huge div and will participate in all the upside. This is a no brainer!!! Sell half your vz and buy T!! You will be thanking me all year long!!
positions were started in q4 2020 and now a news article relating to it is published as the stock slips? sec should investigate
I love this stock! All for long. Oooh yeaahh! HI represent bruh!
Is Verizon going to buy Netflix?
Share your reaction
"my peoples, all telecommunication stocks are down today the sector is down. vz is a dividend play that's true. however, look at the charts history always repeats itself this stock is going up to 50 buclaroos whether u buy it or not. consider this price a gift and jump on board:)...."
"The Trump administration has moved to cut food stamps from 700,000 people. They have already told us they are doing it, to keep wealthy people from collecting through loopholes. Today, yahoo finance is carrying the story, in order to help Michael Bloomberg. In fact, the story was by Bloomberg, which said they won't do any stories about mike, just about Donald. I'd like to see an equal time violation filed against Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance/Yahoo. Esp now that Mike has announced and bought air time. It would be so easy to convict them, just using their press release about not reporting on Mike."
X dividend ?
"VZ has $200 Billion in debt, and some people claim Tesla is not a good investment......go figure"
"Did anyone see the news about us teaming up with Amazon. We will be using their AWS. They will be using our 5G mobile edge. It will equate to seamless communication where you have our 5G mobile service/5G phone, and their AWS. I would think this should move the stock Monday!"
"You know what the real difference is between VZ and T, VZ has no future and will die a very slow death, T's future is now so bright you are going to need to wear shades as T's 5G monster starts devouring the competition and growing . FACT"
"Verizon has been selected by Bayer to build a next-gen network infrastructure to support global business operations.It's a departure for Bayer, which has typically worked in-house for information technology but is moving to a cloud-first model and wanted to go with a single service provider.Verizon will deliver managed network services to more than 700 sites in 91 countries, including a managed global private IP network, a managed software-defined wide area network, and Professional Services support and governance."
Did anyone notice that you now have to pay $350 a year to look at quarterly financials on Yahoo?Just how many ways is Verizon creating to get rid of users?
hoping it stays low till February 1 dividend reinvested
58 next week
"Always amazes me how people dump dividend paying stocks while interest rates drop. Corporate debt yields have not been dropping as fast treasuries, but yields are declining. All the while you can buy VZ shares with a reasonable payout ratio of ~53% and yield around 4.4% as of today (3/5/20). There is of course the 10 YR T-Note offering an underwhelming 1.6% with considerable interest rate risk associated with it."
"Y'all just don't listen do you? Like I said, VZ is overdone at this point. There will be minimal growth from this point without a true catalyst.You will need to either hold and take paper losses or be smart and jump on the ATT train which is just now leaving the station with a much higher dividend and growth prospect. Rotating money ain't that hard people. You can always get back in the 45s on this one where it needs to be."
i really just dont understand what is holding verizon back from 49+ today
"I wonder what will come out of the investigator who looked into the rest of the missing trillions from the war budget, realizing its eerily close to the actual ""debt"", I hope Americans soon see they are the biggest scam victim ever."
They just compared 4 wireless carriers comparing download speeds in 3 different markets Atlanta Chicago and Dallas for 5G in the U.S. and South Korea. Take a look at the chart. Guess who won @ download 1.1 Gbps per second?https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/us-5g-networks-marked-by-paltry-coverage-unimpressive-speeds-independent-tests-show-/d/d-id/754857?$ftr $vz
VZ is up 4.91% to 53.71
This stock is one big anchor and is not going anywhere anytime soon. Yahoo needs to undo the deal as soon as possible and decouple from this anchor. Check out the massive debt on the VZ balance sheet. In grasping for ways to stay relevant they could pull Yahoo core down with them. YHOO needs to undo the deal as VZ can not afford the Yahoo core and will need additional loans to pay up. The decreasing value of VX stock is not helping things.
"Hypothetical Question? If Verizon did not pay out a dividend of $2.46 per share then how much would the stock price be. Remember, T-Mobil our German competitor doesn't pay their shareowners a juicy dividend!"
Buy ACB...huge returns coming..look at premarket
"Seems to be a bid in for VZ, the analyst composite est. for revenue is +1.4% for 2020. The average for EPS this year is $4.71 and for 2020 - $4.83 up $.12 for growth of 2.6%. That looks out of line - VZ is reducing expenses from the 5 yr cost plan that included a RIF of 10,400 supervisors and managers at the end of 2018. There should be downward pressure on SG&A expenses in 2020. So there should be more income leverage than 2.6% off 1.4% revenue growth -- that's $131.66 bil growing to $133.4 bil or up $1.74 bil. My guess is that 5G revenue starts to build late this year as cities implement Safe Cities cameras and alarms and start to see what speed and bandwidth can do for emergency services and crime prevention. Very few mini-marts with good camera systems get robbed - maybe 5G can make a real dent in crime. Can you make camera's bullet proof? This topic should get some attention during the election season as part of infrastructure investment planning. If revenue growth in 2021 hits 2% that's would be about $2.7 bil growth. That looks doable to this investor."
"Yahoo went bust because breaches of privacy, scanning emails etc ...than Yahoo was hit with class action...now under VZ is doing same......beware ..."
"Debt can be restructured very easily in this market, free gov money allows for share buybacks and dividend payments. Real question is, is this a capital intensive building year for 5G to allow the sell through of a new Iphone/Android line in 2022-2023 and how will the market price that now?"
I see VZ is CENSORING post again today
$T $VZ $SPY Interesting. Look at ytd chart for T and VZ. Both got hammered in March c19 plunge. VZ has recovered. T has not. T has stayed down. Why? CNN? Whadyu think?
Yield back around 4%+ which means buy time. Any capital appreciation on this is icing on the cake but I buy for the longevity of the dividend.
Back to $55
"Hammer Fiber $HMMR recently acquired spectrum licensing in the 3.5 GHz band from 3.650 GHz 3.700 GHz, and developing pre 5G wireless technology. Very small cap play under $0.50, but well worth gamble as buyout target, and stock play in 5G"
"Any move higher is only a chance to sell even more. So get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL Nothing has changed VZ is still a company that can NOT be Trusted and VZ is still losing customers and Shareholders as VZ runs them off with their Yahoo CENSORING NATZI's"
I hear VZ has a bond currently paying about 4.7%. Where can I check this out?
"question: is anyone going to hedge their vz and other blue chip securities in the event the senate denies the tax cut bill? If so, what are you doing?"
"No denying that VZ is a superior bond equivalent and defensive stock. Given VZ's concentration of US revenue it may be the very best bond equivalent. I just revisited an article about VZ's design for fiber cable in cities like Boston - 1700 strand fiber for the main trunk lines with feeder lines coming in between 150 and 300 strands per cable - feeder lines going past residential and commercial and supporting 5G throughout an area terminating on street lamp posts, traffic signals, buildings and other tall just about anything. Independent dark cable providers are laying the feeder cables. Being able to do Smart/Safe City systems is giving VZ rights of way. VZ will be layering on revenue when 5G gets subscribed by commercial. I'm not up to date on VZ's Smart City approach, does anyone know if it plans to install the cameras and other eq themselves? At any rate glad to see VZ act strong today..."
VZ is going out of business. The ultimate value trap.
This stock is turning into an annuity.
Verizon is dead money until they dispose of Yahoo.
STRP was trading at $36/share before the bidding war with T and VZ. VZ acquired STRP for 5 times its pre-bid share price. McAdams makes some of the worst deals.
Why is this down? Really confusing how the st analyzes earnings
"Verizon's yahoo finance has 5 things Biden would do differently. Surely the first thing is, he would put Hunter back on the board of directors for Burisma. And then he would send Hunter to China to start another investment fund, so that Americans could invest directly in Chinese companies that make arms for their military.Why does yahoo finance keep bringing up Biden ? For the same reason the cat keeps bringing in a dead rat.."
"Anonymous is a PAID TROLL and THOUGHT POLICE of Verizon. Crush, kill, destroy."
"VZ is now once a lifetime Strong Buy, load up and think later."

X-Date Jan 9th. Quarterly dividend! nice time to buy in and hold.
"Hmm, with the recent run of VZ pps lately, I wonder if this is brewing again?https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-google-ott-internet-5g/"
I would not be surprised if the DOJ sites the run up of T & VZ after the FCC announcement as evidence the market thinks 3 players will see higher consumer prices. But I'll enjoy the ride...I am sure VZ in and of itself is heading to higher profitability whether it's 3 or 4 players...
"If it can't breakout today, then this will be at $57 before er. Triple top."
"Was 22 cents worth the risk of losing dollars LOL,LOL,LOL VZ going lower Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL"
"I subscribe to ATT internet, with e-mail & front news page powered by Yahoo. With comments disabled, are ATT customers eligible for some kind of refund, as customer's aren't fully able to use it's platform? What move by Verizon is this to tamper with a feature of ATT services? Subscribers are not receiving what is in their contract, unless being hijacked & force fed to read controversial & antagonistic articles without the ability to comment on them is somewhere deep in the fine print."
WOW look at all the customers VZ lost to T over the weekend. Why because VZ can not compete anymore because they cost is to high and people are mow saving money to switch to T. plus they get free HBO Max so they can drop NFLX and save even more money WOW T is now getting lots of new customers from VZ and T mobile
Amazing how this stock can be controlled ( kept under $50.)
"Business Insider, frequently having a so called ""story"" here on Yahoo Finance, says someone making minimum wage, needs 2.5 full time jobs, to be able to afford a one bedroom apartment. Yet Verizon is championing unlimited immigration, so they don't have to pay their sales and service reps anything. Business Insider just stabbed Verizon in the back. And if you own Verizon stock, you should talk to management about how they are helping their lowest paid employees, that is if you have a heart."
Ton of shorts posting (negative) messages on this board - beware!
"The market can’t figure much out lately. With an additional rate cut, I’ll be buying more VZ this week."

"Verizon is laying claim to the world's first end-to-end fully virtualized 5G data session.That's a milestone that paves the way for widescale mobile edge computing and network slicing, the carrier says.Virtualizing the radio access network decouples software and hardware functionality, allowing for a network to built on general-purpose hardware rather than specialized.It will also lower the barrier to entry for new vendors, Verizon says.“Virtualizing the entire network from the core to the edge has been a massive, multi-year redesign effort of our network architecture that simplifies and modernizes our entire network,” says Verizon's Adam Koeppe."
Wake up people just 1 big scam here. Just all day trading games period. This whole system needs to collapse thousands of points. Send the FEd a message quit manipulating markets with rate cuts. All this last 3 cuts so investors will get screwed with no return in money markets. All this to try to force investors into stock markets etc. Same with Europe same game with negative returns im money markets etc. This is hy this whole sysgtem needs to collapse once again. Take out these fixed markets period.Enough od games we need a real free market not a manipulated one by FEd foreign countries governmwnts with negative interest rates.
"Yahoo/Verizon you stink. You bash away with your biased, so-called ""news"" short for liberal, demo-blather and squelch conservative opinion. This is PROOF of the INFERIORITY of your garbage and your COWARDLY means of operation."

"The 5-yr chart is rocky, but it has had a positive trajectory. Covid caused a big drop, but it has mostly recovered. I'm expecting to see this one in the range of $60-50 within a month."
"As you stand waiting for the Eagles parade to come by on Friday, consider going to the Verizon building, and telling them how don't appreciate them helping to bring millions of people here, keeping Blacks from getting jobs, and keeping wages around $10 an hour for many Verizon jobs. Some people estimate that Verizon service reps would be making $15 an hour, if not for hoards of immigrants coming to their sanctuary city."
"Verizon supports Antifa, BLM, and Marxist causes. Is this what America wants? I think not. Sell them out of existence one shareholder at a time. Remember that they own Yahoo too. Hate platform."

"The reality of the capabilities of 5G for the average person are becoming evident. mmWave is practically useless for the average user. It can't travel more than a few meters and can't penetrate walls. So, can you use it? How? The low band that TMUS launched has good range but is only marginally faster than 4G LTE. The mid band is a blend of both. It will travel a farther and is faster than low band. But so far, VZ and T have launched mmWave. Until they also launch mid wave the benefit for the average user will be minimal. I'd just keep my 4G LTE phone until 5G becomes more robust."
VZ stock price is stagnant. Fire Hans
where will VZ be by end of next week ?
To the moon Alice! I mean VZ
"Wild theory: Softbank offers buyout of Charter, that releases VZ's resale obligation, VZ and the other carriers then take any remaining customers of sprint while the TO confusion occurs."
CRIMINAL PRACTICES ?????????????? BUYING INFLUENCE AND THE MOST CORRUPT ENTITY IN THE USA
omg!!! should have sold my call for 16 when i made 40 dollars lmao! off 0.03 call share. 100. pleased go back up
"T-Mobile and Sprint EARNINGS show: they don't have enough money to build 5G networks and improve their networks signals, SO VZ New plan will kill them,"
vz will drop below 50 by 2/1
"Debt. When is VZ going to work on their debt? I understand they have a secure revenue stream, but still the debt is in the stratosphere.......and I'm a long-time holder."
no bounce back the past 2 days doesn't bode well. Too soon to add to position?
"Hey Hans, get back to work. No one cares about your political views."
Let no good earnings go unpunished!!
where's the to $100 crowd now? lol
yahoo's virus encrusted pages have become totally dysfunctional. The infection is taking over verizon too.Get out while you still can.
"With all the record employment numbers, including Latino and Blacks, yahoo finance still name calls the Trump economic policies. Attention all immigrants, when you come to the country, and you decide on a phone plan, don't get it with Verizon. Verizon liked it better when many people like you did not have jobs."
Verizon sucks. Not only does there signal suck but they seem to pulling the plug on many cell towers. Now there are more gaps in there service. What a joke.
Wow! That one month chart is quite the ski slope! That downhill is rated black!
"at&t T-Mobile and Verizon EARNINGS report SHOW: wireless market extending, because they added wireless customers more than expected, SO buy Verizon sure be make money,"
Why can’t this stock climb???
What a day! Kinda knew that we were up way too much in after hours and pre-market. Long term great stock. Wondering if traders are trying to demoralize investors and slowly get their shares. I'm staying put.
If Cramer is pumping you better be selling. Why because his Wall Street buddies will be selling.
2 competitors {Tmus + S} combine to become 1 stronger competitor.The future growth of the stock falls upon the question of can VZ execute 5G better than the competition?
Watch Biden take credit for the vaccine breakthrough. I'm glad Trump pushed these drug companies.
"I commented in Webull that I need a hug after these frustrating days, but no one cares!!! Wish everyone lots of love and lucks tomorrow!!"
"Another risk-off day when money flows to safety. So, the Q2 report moved the bid up from a $55 range to a $57 range. Could be worse folks, so I appreciate market sentiment lifting the valuation. Let's hope the corporate rate stays at a base 21% with 100% first yr tax expense on many capital items, I believe thru 2022. And you know what that means."
What is with Verizon and Disney contract issues? How will it affect the stock price after the new year?
"Europe is now burning their 5g cell towers. Fear of them killing birds, and frying human brains, people now worry about the high power energy fields they use helping spread the corona virus.

how can i buy anything during a disaster when stocks haven't even broken their 52 weeks lows off ALL TIME highs??? pass.
"Both VZ and T have become day trading stocks, if you have enough resourses."
"Well, I see Yahoo has ph%!&*<'??ed up its porfolio pages AGAIN. A question I would like to ask, is: Verizon, did YOU approve this change? Because I'm tired of customizing the layout with the information I deem to be most relevant to me, only to have you idiots put in whatever you feel like.OK Losers (aka Yahoo, NOT the people navigating thru this website), I will immediately search for another site to help keep track of my financial dealings."
Too cheap to ignore with strong growth in 5G nation wide expansion.
Why not trade the channel?
"Last Point I would like to make and as a long time holder of the stock is that I want to see what VZ is selling turn up on the bottom line.IOT?Show me returns on the earnings report.Large corporations set up there own network and software is available through the manufacturers of the devices they use,like Cisco.VZ has no monopoly on IOT.This was the year 5G was suppose to deliver now instead VZ takes on $50 billion more in debt?"
why won't this rip higher?
Company is lame. Look at a one year chart
It ended in the RED
time for the senior management team to go. this stock has gone nowhere!! att taking all verizons business!!!
"Finally MILITARY Families Get a BREAK--Starting today, (6/28/18)- active-duty military, reservists, Gold Star families and veterans can sign up for the Go Unlimited plan for $30 per month per line for four lines* - a savings of $40 per month. And now that you can mix and match unlimited plans for the whole family, military families can save even more on all Verizon Unlimited plans: get $15 off one line, $35 off two lines and $40 off three or more lines. To get the military discount, simply login to your account and choose the unlimited plans you need.Also beginning today for a limited time, military families can receive a $200 Mastercard prepaid card when activating a new 4G LTE smartphone on a new line of service**. For a family of four that switches to Verizon, that's a $40 monthly discount and $800 back."
Verizon - you need to fix Yahoo. It has turned into complete junk reporting.
What are the cellphones except made in Korea? And anybody know what are the new models of wireless hot spot capable 5G on the market?

"Verizon has the greatest, most far reaching 5g network. Hans is an excellent President."
who was MORON THAT SAID ATT WAS A BUY.see you at 22 on that POS
VZ gives another $ million donation and we get a smaller div increase every year.
"So when will yahoo finance face charges of collusion, for helping to dessimate the phoney dossier ?What I'm afraid of now, is if the President doesn't get the unredacted FISA warrants on Monday, that he call in the top 25 Justice Dept officials, starting with Sessions and if, while in his office, they don't release, or call and have the documents released immediately, that the President fire them, and bring in the next person down the line, until they find someone who is not trying to overthrow the Country. And as these guys are fired, US Marshalls should be raiding their office, and confiscating laptops, and meetings records, and US Marshalls should be escorting these traitors out of the White House, and immediately revoke their email accounts, computer access, and security clearances. Saying no is grounds for dismissal, and he could clean up a nice chunk of the Justice Dept in a couple of hours. Hes not obstructing Justice. Hes firing for willfull misconduct, and not obeying an order. Just like he did when Bates refused to follow orders. Monday, this could be real sweet."
"this uptick to dilute the DRIP investors quarterly div, will return down after div posted to accts"
Prime time for Verizon. Low pe. And good yield. With work and learn from hone craze. Unstoppable.
Leader in 5g
"well, looks like Verizon is the winner!"
Why VZ don’t recovery when the S&P going in race up VZ doesn’t move but when the S&P is down VZ is down but strong
believe
THE best strategy was to sell a bunch of calls near the close yesterday. You could see the breakdown in support towards the end of the day. It was an easy trade to make. Covered them shortly after opening today. Love these easy money wins.
has anyone seen a single 9-11 article on Yahoo?
kirk! that's one reason I'm out! but it may go somewhere. DOWN. ALONG WITH. DIVIDEND!!
Ouch.......
Hans' deal ? DIS=++++++VZ=-------- ????????
The street doesn't like VZ and unlimited Data. Hopefully Sprint and T Mobile merge and fix this cut throat pricing
Will VZ ever hit $60 again?
looks like one more attempt to scale mount 60 .....
"Three quite negative posts below from 1.long&strong, 2.Sky, 3. Stockhunter -- all 3 ID's made up to post for the first time. I don't know why -- strange that 3 new ID's post back-to-back like that. Kinda weird."
Who pumped the junk?
Mark my words. VZ will now depart from its traditional price resistance tendency .... get ready for a slow but steady climb
BAM!
VZ enters the blue jeans market! Just kidding. Verizon partners with India/Airtel for business video conference solutions in the 2nd largest internet market.
The problem with verizon apparently is 117billion debt. Comments?
Does Verizon take responsibility for the biased censorship on the Yahoo boards?
Verizon is going to save a boatload of cash.
Up up and away!
VZ purchased by Buffet. 147M shares worth $9B as of Dec 31st. Just announced on CNBC.
stimulus checks to go straight into the stock market - buy buy buy i sure as heck don't need the one i going to get times 4 kids
Comcast seems to be a new wireless customer of VZ since they will be utilizing VZ's 4G network!
"@J. How about the phrase ""dumb as they comb."" You do the same thing over on the Verizon board which will get you no where. Macy's. Really? haaaaaaaa. You are boring dude give it up! Unless you are saying what you really invest in? shut it.$VZ conversationJust hit refresh and it goes down worse and worse, pathetic stock."
"Everyone wants to be cute and find backdoor ways to invest in 5G via semiconductors, hardware, towers, etc. but at the end of the day, VZ is the one actually providing 5G itself. And they are getting no love....makes sense"

Have to know how to play this stock. Buy hold with a drip. write out of the $ calls. you pick up Div. call premium and any appreciation is a bonus
"Buffet has been in the stock since it was 60, so it needed CNBC to boost it because Buffet is their boy, but remember they were buyers at 60, and it still dropped over the alst couple of months,, Maybe Buffet needed DIVIDEND INCOME"
Verizon stops viewer posting on Yahoo because they cannot persuade the majority. Only the braindead liberal sheep by into the false narratives.
"It is fascinating to watch how much censorship is going on right now. It's downright scary. You'd swear what happened at the Capitol building last week was as bad as what happened in Kenosha, WI or Portland, OR with BLM. Wait...you mean you haven't seen ANY videos or news stories about EITHER of these events that depict the VIOLENCE and LAWLESSNESS (or should I say SEDITION) that occurred at them, to the tune of a billion dollars? No? Gee, I wonder why not? Hans, care to weigh in on this with your Yahoo Media division?"
best stock for selling covered calls!
sell at 49.99 buy back under 48 sell CC at 50 etc etc etc scoup dividend play slow and safe
"rolled over from T run up, to VZ"
And it descends further. What a bum stock.
"VZ 5G networks roll out next year, it's faster than anyone, T has no time, T-Mobile and others maybe doesn't have 5G networks forever, because they don't have enough money to build 5G networks, their cellphone don't have enough signal anywhere, SO only VZ worth to buy,"
is it gonna go down by alot?
Just $50M? So $0.25/user?
What's up? I mean what's down?!!
"LOLHow many times did I school real_dumb_matt? $60 is just too high, 4% yield is key with VZ.Now here we sit near 55s"
"Verizon (VZ) has been a steady stock for years, but a breakout is likely in the works as it bounces off a key support level. Really? Let's hope so."
https://m.nasdaq.com/symbol/vz/dividend-history
"Bought at 60 been dropping ever since, what gives?"
According to my calculations Berkshire payed 58.64 average price per share..be careful they don't unload their mistake on you
so qjick question lets say i buy at low price then again at a higher price which stock price is it gonna go by
5G getting rolled out next week. Also we go exdividend on Monday I believe. Expect a nice few weeks into earnings on the 23rd. Good luck....been a bumpy ride lately but we're about to stabilize (hopefully at 60-62) imo before going higher
New 52 week high. Sweet!
"Volume coming in. Moving averages are all go green, according to stoxline. A break of 52.05 could move it up to 60.79."
"you are not selling all the VZ you can on any move higher you will be kicking yourselves in just a little bit as the Market has a massive drop. Sell any moves higher you you can in all your stocks , LOL,LOL Get ready to say OH NO down everything goes LOL,LOL,LOL. You don't even need to make stuff up when it all so true . Inflation has been kick started by DEM wIt Joe by causing a oil spike in the future just like the 1970's and the 1970's was a decade that sucked to own stocks"
Only a couple weeks to the 4th quarter earnings report (around 1/20/18). Hopefully it's good and this stock takes another jump up.
why it is going down
"Everyone I know is now dumping VZ for service and selling their VZ stock LOL,LOL any move higher is just a chance to sell even more before they have to fire Han's and his Yahoo censoring Natzi's that day is now coming and faster than you think. LOL,LOL Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes . Because VZ has no future any more."
"WOW is a smart move. Buying already built networks for backhaul, 5g and smart city IOT products gives them instant access. The concept of buying lower priced assets (like AOL/Yahoo/Telematics) allows VZ into new markets without adding significant debt. Their wireless network is paying down their 45% takeover from Vodaphone. As other assets start adding to FCF VZ will be in good position to pay down debt faster and buy other valued assets."
What do you think?If this bill in the House does not pass the market crashes and big money returns to VZ.
Me buy53.00
I sold my VZ today and bought T- a lot more upside. HBO Max seems promising.
Please dump Yahoo
"The fact is T has made the changes to compete in the new 5G world that it faces and VZ was clueless on the fact it need to make changes , because VZ could not see the future it now faces so VZ stayed in the Commodities business the problem they now have is they are the highest cost producer and their Commodities are dropping in price faster than a speeding bullet. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Resistance at 61
"HOW many more customer did VZ lose to T today , The customer loses at VZ will make then have to cut the dividend to service their massive DEBT LOL,LOL you all know it's coming as T devours VZ LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Verizon had offered a year of Disney Plus free with ""unlimited"" wireless subscriptions at the streaming service's launch in November.Starting this week, it's offering the bundle Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus to subscribers for its Play More and Get More Unlimited plans for as long as customers stay on those plans. That programming bundle is usually $12.99/month.The new plan supersedes its previous Disney Plus offer. Existing customers on that deal can move to the new plans to get the new Disney bundle, or for $6/month they can stay in their current plan and add ESPN Plus and Hulu to fill out their bundle."
"When I am out in the middle of nowhere on fishing and hunting trip I get the best service with vz. I had at&t, and cricket, other hun ters had sprint and had all kinds of probls. they were using my phone with vz to get out on."
down .99 yesterday. up 56 today. how's that great?
VZ competing with T for worst stock in the S&P
The Verizon and MGM Sports Betting partnership is going to roll out across the United States...
"I agree, we need senior management leadership that has a game plan and also stands up to this BOZO ceo at T_MOBILE. This guy makes Verizon look like they don't know what there doing!!!!"
"I’m beginning to question Verizon’s ability to generate growth. Sure 5G will help, but they need to generate more revenue from other sources. AOL and Yahoo haven’t been sound investments."
"The Dinosaurs became extinct.5 G signals are so narrow they blow away in the wind.Soon, Dividend to be extinct."
sold my smallish position of 334 shares today. hope to buy them back at 54 in a few weeks
They need to keep Hans off of CNBC. Every time that #$%$ talks the stock goes down.
"California UPGRADE- Faster 5G!_""Verizon, Samsung Will Team Up to Bring Faster 5G to California"" at 9 a.m. ET incorrectly Kim Woo-June was a senior vice president of Samsung's Next Generation business team in the last paragraph. Mr. Kim is a senior vice president in Samsung's network business. (Jan. 3, 2018)"
"long and strong, excellent entry. very"
You get twice as many shares with T than VZ giving you more dividends. overall
"Wow, what caused the dump? surely VZ isn't being heavily shorted at this stage of the game"
"So, China has a tariff on VZ & we are down today? ;-)"
ok Verizon.. pay me some cash today! i picked up 57$ calls for 3/13 on the cheap yesterday. Give daddy some cash so i can pay my Verizon Bill!
I smell a breakthrough coming!!

"Help fight globalism. help save your job, and your neighbors. Get rid of S&P funds in your 401k, sell your Verizon shares, and dump your Verizon land line. Verizon is taking revenues and cash from you, and using it to help send jobs and wealth overseas. Why are you helping them ?"
CNN is the highest rated and most watched news channel in the world. I'm so glad VZ bought Time Warner!
All out of VZ. Thank you for Verizon. Cashed out on 100 of my contracts option calls. Big money with only a one week old. Thank you are you bears and shorts out there for giving me your money!￼￼
Back to 60$
WTH is going on? Why is everyone dumping on heavy volume?
Verizon is afraid of Americans. Wait till Trump is re-elected.
"It would not surprise me if VZ runs up at the end of the trading session, as so often happens with stocks that are downgraded. Traders prepare for the next day....."
Warren Buffet bought this
VZ only trades active on the after hours market. the gain is only shows on the after trades hours too. 2 minutes after the normal open hours the gains would evaporate. why and how???
"Coco told you, capped at 4% or 61.5"
"Verizon is best of class for 5g. I think it’s the one to own for growth. I would avoid AT&T, as I don’t think they are best of class at anything anymore.....and have other issues."
"Re: disabling comments on Yahoo news stories -- I'm now seeing a ""Start Survey"" button that opens Survey Monkey to tell Yahoo/Verizon what you think!"
"6/26/16 last year it was at $56.23. If it approaches that, I might consider selling for awhile. Otherwise I'm holding."
you bet they got problems raising prices again on equipment with earnings coming in August
coco be fruity eh?
VZ: should be trading @ 55-56$ range
60 in the mirror......70 straight ahead.........Go Big Red..........
So nice to see T go up 4% like a stock should on good quarter beat
"Reuters reports that VZ is close to a revised deal to buy Yahoo Inc's core internet business for $250 million to $350 million less than the original agreed price of $4.83 billion, according to an unnamed source"
MY ID SAYS IT ALL ON FRIDAY
What good is a 5% dividend if the underlying stock will lose almost 5% in one day? (Today)
Shorts squeeze in progress....see you at $100
"At today's price of 48.55, I just added 300 shares. Looks good to me for the dividend yield."
"Dividend increase -- I believe that last year VZ announced an increase the first week of Sept. Given the Trump tax cut, we should see an increase above the 2% or so for the last few years. A 6% bump from $2.36 to $2.50 would probably generate a bid to take VZ back up to $55 and a about a 4.55% yield compared to 4.45% today. If the market dumps in the next 3 weeks VZ could be set up for a nice trade."
"Accuweather ran a story telling us how cell phone records said many people are violating stay at home orders.Just wait till 5g comes, and the government will not only know who you spent time with, but everything else you did. And wait till Verizon installs Huawei equipment, then not only will our government know everything you do, but so will China. Verizon wants cheap equipment. They don't care how much freedom its costs us."
5g is a health hazard -- all over u tube can cause brain cancer-- there will be zombies everywhere !!
"""Wow, almost back to where it was 9/1/99."" I'm always curious about thumbs-down on a post that is a simple statement of fact. Look at the chart. VZ briefly broke $60 in the fall of '99. And now it's almost back to that price, after 9 years. So, what does a thumbs-down on a post like ""Wow, almost back to where it was 9/1/99"" actually mean? Denial of the obvious? Anger at having the price history pointed out? Just curious. Oh, and in case you missed the original: Wow, almost back to where it was 9/1/99."
"unbelievably yahoo finance is mocking Venezuela. the country that is on the edge of civil war. and we all know why, but yahoo finance will never tell people that Chavez took billions from a strong oil industry, and part of it as handouts to bribe people into liking socialism, while pocketing the rest. years later, as the oil industry failed from his taking their money, the country is battered and tattered, while yahoo finance makes fun of the situation. once again, these are bad people, working every day to hurt employees."
"Mornin' Matt Real Dumb, how does my order to sell my IRA shares at 60.80 on Nov 19th 2018 look today? LOL.You were wrong, I am right. LOL"
Ignore the day trading noise longs.I could say another up Friday 3 weeks in a row. But we know that isn't ligit with last weeks Friday close of 59.76.But overall with the dummies trying to bring it down over the tmob/att merger not bad overall.Ex-div a week from Thursday. Let's see how we do next week hopefully back over 60.Stay strong longs and enjoy the weekend of college bball and baseball!
"Verizon has Yahoo Finance posting stories about unclean, dirty homeless people being kicked out of Taco Bell and Burger King. I don't want someone with roach droppings sitting in the next booth, or head lice or bed bugs, or urine in their clothes.I think if Verizon wants to take care of the homeless, Verizon should open up their corporate headquarters to the homeless, and let the homeless sit in on the Verizon shareholders meeting. And if shareholder actually agree with management, each shareholder should take a homeless person home with them. Other wise, why not tell Verizon to cool their liberal agenda."
"VZ is determined to assassinate free speech. The scuttling of nearly all of the yahoo comment boards shows their total lack of concern with service and earnings. Be assured the exodus is on! As the traffic, earnings and sponsorship vanish, the propaganda becomes total, and the cancellations, disconnects, boycotts, and prices explode, they are counting on the ever disappearing clueless investors and 'customers' to carry them through. It will be ugly."
Verizon jacked up my bill that was locked infor $40 a month to $50 a month. Why is it the customers get charged big bucks for early cancellation but Verizon gets away with changing the contract? Let's start a class action lawsuit.
Buy Verizon they said. Best in 5G they said. What a dog. I’m going over to T. GL. SMDH
What’s up with VZ? It hasn’t been this low in years
"NEW YORK, Aug. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Verizon and Apple announced an exclusive partnership, the first step of which brings Apple Music to Verizon’s wireless customers. Beginning August 16, Verizon Unlimited customers can sign up for a special offer of six months of Apple Music free*.Nice!!!"
"""The company’s total 1.25 million postpaid net adds beat Wall Street’s consensus forecast for 1.1 million. It was Verizon’s best fourth quarter for postpaid additions since 2013.""Well that's promising, since wireless is the future...Picked up some FIOS internet adds, lost some TV sub's, but those people still keep the internet.We'll likely see a bit of an over reaction to the down side, but I doubt it stays below 59 for long."
"Until there is a flight to safety, it looks like VZ will just bounce around in this tight $56 range. And today is definitely not the start of a flight to safety."
"VZ is trying everything to get its Media Division noticed: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/02/2087778/0/en/DISH-Media-partners-with-Verizon-Media-to-automate-addressable-advertising.html Kind of like throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks. As Clint Eastwood would say, sometimes a man's got to know his limits. Time to dump this pig division."
"I know why so many investors perceive AT&T as an irredeemable dumpster fire, but why is VERIZON down this much?"
"Verizon bought AOL and Yahoo was very smart, because AOL and Yahoo total $9.5bln, it's very cheap, because Yahoo and AOL are worth at least 15bln, if Verizon buy DIS sure be perfect."

This year over year growth was primarily driven by strong performance in the business and non-recurring items and timing differences, including approximately $2.0 billion in second-quarter 2020 tax payments postponed to third-quarter 2020 due to COVID-19, the receipt of the previously disclosed $2.2 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold in fourth-quarter 2019, improvements in working capital due to lower volumes, and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program in full-year 2019 that did not repeat this year.""""...and payments to the Voluntary Separation Program in full-year 2019 that did not repeat this year.""VZ is going to have the lowest internal cost per connection going into the era of 5G.

"I've been selling my Verizon shares for over 2 years now. I hated their purchases of Yahoo and AOL. (Yahoo's purchase being particularly ridiculous). Verizon management appears to be clueless - at least when it comes to online media. I have been buyiing ATT at incredibly low prices as the market has mispriced that one to bottom basement prices - and I feel ATT is actually a superior business (superior business model now) to Verizon. Looks like ATT is following up its ""Crazy Rich Asians"" mega hit (Warner Studios) with an even bigger hit this holiday season in AQUA-MAN. I mean, the hits just keep on coming, literally! I buy low and sell high and sometimes never sell certain stocks. ""T"" seems to be a once in a lifetime buy here as most investors are missing once going on in that Company. ATT is the buy of a lifetime. I see the stock set to double from current prices in less than 24 months."
Everyone quite as a mouse when VZ is right back where they started before the Wall Street mob caused the down turn.
"I'm watching what has been happening in the US during the past few weeks. Rather than get into a left vs right argument, let me just say that I'm watching the fabric of America tear apart, all in the name of grabbing power. Throughout history, power grabs NEVER work. NEVER. Sure, you may get it for a while, but it's like grabbing a handful of water - the harder you grab the faster it squirts away. While all this is going on, the US dollar is declining worldwide, and is at risk of losing its ""reserve"" status in the not too distant future. My family is planning on this inevitability (the US going into a steady decline), and has adjusted its investments and ownerships accordingly. Sure, I think there are many great things about America and its people, but it's sad to see that 535 people are going to permanently mess up the lives of over 300 million in the name of power and greed."

Is there anything that would account for the huge ups and downs of VZ and T? I just don't get this one."

People. We are shareholders of VZ to make 40% profit in 3 months. +4% dividend can not be overlooked. It should be a long term holding and considered a cornerstone of your portfolio. Have to live through these flat periods.
$55 by Friday!
Adding here
Moffett /Nathansen just downgraded T with a price target of $30. They downgraded VZ to hold Sept 2018. VZ is not well liked by Street analysts -- by far mostly holds with one sell. But hey -- that means they can all lift their ratings if VZ starts to perform -- meaning revenue & OP EPS growth. I believe that will happen in 2021. Clipping coupons in the meantime.

"VZ was looooong overdue for a correction. It basically went up with ZERO future proofing, maintaining a status quo and creeping up on a ""no news is good news"" logic while the other Telcos made their big moves and took their short term lumps. VZ has no future proofing besides the one trick 5G pony which everyone will have (some sooner) in a saturated market. You SELL high not buy. That is why T is the BUY right now."

"Been following and trading in VZ for a few years now. My basis is well below $40, so I'm not worried. Standing pat on my shares. But for those new to join, I have notice with predictable regularly that once VZ hits $61, a sell-off soon follows. Then a predictable climb back. With ex-div coming in less than 2 weeks, I think you'll see a climb to cover half the losses of today."
VZ is a great company.
"VZ sell pipe and the cost VZ can charge for that pipe in dropping faster than a speeding bullet as they spend billions to build more pipe that just keeps dropping in price .

The thought of investing in a liberal propaganda machine does not sit well with me. Liberals are losing and it seems almost every allegation they make backfires on them, not to mention competition getting stronger. Company leaders who want to see our government fail does not generate much trust, but does make for some uncertainty. At some time, it will be VZ's turn for a giant misstep. When the dust settles from tax reform and the net neutrality thing, it may even be worth shorting in between dividend payouts."

Do your DD as this company has the potential of major growth in this AR market in sports and marketing, has former NFL quarterback Gus Frerotte to pursue NFL opportunities. Looks like an amazing entry point.Virtual reality and augmented reality experiences will continue to accelerate, with leagues needing to entice both in-person and at-home fans.

They will be able to sustain their families. I'd like to see some VZ employees, and some union leaders go to a VZ annual shareholders meeting, and ask why Verizon hates their lower paid employees so much. When I see all these VZ employees suffer, sometimes I long for socialism, where a VZ corporate salesperson makes the same as a telephone rep, who makes the same as the janitor.

"Verizon Direct sales centers are bamboozling customers across the country with their ""bait and switch"" sales tactics. Hitting the social media in full force. I was a victim of this scam here at the Centennial Verizon Wireless store in Las Vegas. Fortunately, Customer Service supervisors have been fighting it for me. Numerous complaints have been made regarding third party sales centers, deceiving customers by telling them not to worry about your charges and that well credit it back. Yea right, my $635+ bill is being diced up in small increments to where you have to go after the sales manager, David, for every dime. Now you know why Verizon is losing customers to Sprint and T-Mobile. Can't wait for my contract to end after being a long time Verizon customer. I will have to sell my $54K stock investment and find another telecom company that doesn't deceive faithful customers."

If you do a one day chart of VZ vs. STRP it certainly looks like someone swapped positions at 12 PM. Selling VZ and buying STRP would give downside protection with earnings coming up next week since STRP will convert into VZ at $184 of VZ per STRP share once deal closes. Looks like a hedge to me.

I'm long a ton of VZ -- starting in 2010 I bought VZ & T and wound up at the end of 2011 with about 1/3 VZ & 2/3 T bought averaging in. Since then I've sold 1/2 the T and then bought some back and added to VZ so now I'm about 2/3 VZ & 1/3 T. So I'm happy with VZ which is my second biggest position. I don't know where the bottom is but if it tanks to $55 I plan to add a little more. I own a few big % positions in conservative stocks -- VZ is my bond equivalent of choice. It does look like 5G revenue will layer on top of growing 4G...

I'm doing the math and trying to figure out how Verizon will be able to show a respectable NPV (net present value) for this investment, even with cheaper bonds. Their hands will be tied for years to come because of this."
I personally favor AT&T over Verizon but both companies are solid.

The street is shifting to T vs VZ. The pe ratio of T was very low compared to VZ. The gap is closing. Plus the negative articles of T have stopped and T has had a number of positive ones. The latest being that T is in a better position for 5G which everyone thinks is the real opportunity for growth in areas not even thought of yet. This will cause T to outperform VZ in the short term and possibly the long term.

Think about all the money you are making with Verizon.

Where's the going to $100 pps crowd? LOL.$60 or 4% yield is a very tough place for VZ as I have been saying for months now.
Is a small short I noticed there is a small short position could it be there running the stock up and down and paying margin interest with a dividend?
Most corrupt company in the USA record of paying off politicians
"I am happy that VZ is up today but it missed the earnings. Is it a good idea to get out or keep holding? With earnings missed, wouldn't the stock go down? Anyone please explain...."
.65 dividend would be the kick Verizon needs to attract more long term investors. It has been a while since the last dividend raise.
Got a question about 5G for VZ and companies who will offer that service. Will the efficiency be improved so much that many will use their device as a hot spot and run the household from that? I know some people do that now usually with only a couple of users in the household. I am thinking that the customer base of VZ could expand with that outcome or at least derive more income per customer when they drop cable/land lines etc.
BUY now.... Great Price

Why isn’t VZ over $60?
Been VZ for dozen years or more. Will keep holding and feeling secure like my ‘tighty whities’ make me feel.
"VZ might as well cut the dividend today , because they are going to have to very soon anyway at the rate the Commodities of pipe they sell just keeps dropping and dropping VZ will need the money just to pay all that debt LOL,LOL,LOL"
keep going way down this is fantastic fall I want to add

Verizon Fios IPTV is here in our area being installed......game changer?
Last day of month.Heavy selling finished.
Verizon customer service is sorely lacking. I was double billed for phone service for the month of march on my credit card. After spending over 4 hours on the phone with my CC company and numerous verizon employees to recieve a refund credit I was told by verizon the previous claims they made to refund my double billing was not entered correctly into their system They said the refund has not been made for this reason but will be refunded now. I asked a verizon manager what they could do about them wasting over 4 hours of my time and he said NOTHING. No offers of free service for a few months or anything. Our time is unimportant to them.
Hammer Fiber Optics (HMMR) is small cap pre 5G play under $1.00.....launching telecom service into Africa and Dominica right now.....HMMR stock breaking above 200-day resistance line as we speak......HMMR

"Trumpanzees have no real home, except at NewsMax and Confederate states - even Fox News said nope,"
"Hello Verizon service reps. I saw many of you start at 10.20 an hour. That seems like a good amount.Bet you didn't know, that in 1969, the minimum wage was 1.60 an hour, which is 11.45 this year.Yeah, your company, along with comcast, and many other companies, have done very well keeping your wages suppressed.That's why there is no wall. That's why many of you live in unsafe neighborhoods. that's why your taxes are high.Its disgusting what these companies, enabled by their shareholders, are doing to you, and many other workers.If they paid a better wage, these shareholders would still make money, and their taxes would also go down, with fewer people making a barebones living. They are being exploited, as you are. Next time you have a union contract expire, demand they stop fighting the wall. Get it in writing."
Too lowT-Mobile will spend a fortune to build out their network.Way behind also.
"Sprint has a great spectrum, which could be used in IoT in addition to Mobil communications. I do not see why AGs are trying to block this merger between $S and $TMUS Merger will strengthen both companies and will allow to really compete against $T and $VZ Only liberals would think that 3 1/2 companies is better than 3 lol"
"Here is the reason why Verizon is down today.Cuomo has just discovered that people can contract Corona virus over the fiberoptic lines, so he is about to order a total shutdown of all communication services. There will be no wireless service, no internet, and no TV.Shutting down all business in New York will pretty much bankrupt the state. Those who still have money will leave the state and those who don't will be on welfare for the rest of their lives.And if other state shut down the way New York and California are shutting down, then we will all eventually starve to death. At least we are going to die healthy, corona virus free.See? And we were all worried about global warming and New York city getting flooded."
Enjoy the opportunity to pick up more shares on the cheap ... with a juicy divi to boot.
Verizon 5G is virtually non existent!
We have been due for a recession for a long time. Used to have 7 year cycles in real estate. China growth and US reliance on it distorted the ec cycles as well as the int rates. We are due a pullback.The question is what will happen when China recovers. Where will our infrastuctures be?
"Athletes, most owners and commissioners of the NFL and NBA teams have expressed their desires to show support for those kneeling during the national anthem and displaying actions in the name of what they are now calling oppression. I suggest the un-oppressed show support for these actions by not purchasing any NFL, NBA tickets making them more available to the oppressed for purchase. In the same spirit team gear (hats, t-shirts, jerseys etc.) should not be purchased by the un-oppressed in order to ensure no shortages occur with these items creating a much-improved opportunity for the oppressed to buy these items.I would also like to suggest not consuming bandwidth by watching these sports on cable that would be selfish. Making this bandwidth more readily available to the oppressed would be very much appreciated.Many have recently displayed their support for the oppressed by not purchasing Nike gear allowing an abundance of this merchandise available to the oppressed, congratulations for your generosity. We all just need to do our part."
"DIVIDEND .... am i reading yahoo right ? the ex div date is 4/1/17 and the payment is 8/6/17 ? (sorry going from memory .. could be 4/6 and 8/1 ) , but a 4 month lag from ex to payout ??? or is that one of those yahoo moments that VZ will have to correct ?/// eh ?"
Does anybody mind that Yahoo (Verizon) censors the message boards. They seem to prefer fascist and racist posts over those critical of the corrupt status quo.
"Vz is smart to have tapped the debt markets at extraordinarily low rates, this capital will protect the dividend, and hold them over through the storm."
Nice run for VZ this week. Must be great dividend and 5G.
You guys need to come back to FB lmfaoooo
"why doesn't this Euro-trash CEO and his donkey head of media step down, yahoo news and HuffPost are not legitimate news sources. It's like Pravda the old communist rag meets the national enquirer.

"I am a decades old customer of Verizon. They have top notched coverage and customer service. But if they don't reign in the hate spewing left wing, anti Christian Yahoo website they will be loosing subscribers like me."
"Verizon orders Yahoo Finance telling the fable that Trump is no longer the best candidate for business. VZ, which only has 1 Black out of their top 13 management wants to be able to use low cost Huawei equipment for their 5g. And they don't car how many US jobs,or how many US lives are lost due to the virus, they want the easiest way to make money. And if it means helping oust the President to do it, so be it. Now if you like freedom, paying low taxes, stopping the burning of cities, and many people working and paying taxes, why do you help VZ cheap shot the President ?"

I'm working on sourcing the data from alternatives, but it'd require few more days to re-implement. In the meantime, I'd request users not to delete the widget instance as you'd lose the data associated with it.""I suggest VZ users start to think about what you are doing, when you pay your cell phone bill every month. You subsidize Yahoo News and Huff Post. Is that what you want to do?"
"Name 1 good acquisition that Verizon has made on the past decade. Yahoo, Terramark and others were huge mistakes."

Looks like the rotation out of VZ and into T has begun.
Strong results of T. VZ trailing way behind.
"Verizon spent $45 BILLION on spectrum. Wow...makes the Sprint purchase by T-Mobile brilliant by comparison. Would have been MUCH CHEAPER for Verizon as well. And don't give me the ""anti-trust"" garbage. That could have been managed."
"Well @R, @AT&T I kinda told you what was going to happen. Now your dividen[T} w a T is going to be suspended for a long time. Ours isn't. I wondered how you guys were going to pay off all that DirecTV money $58 Billion. We held it in bond s and cash. You guys don't have the upper hand. It's going to come out of your pocket, son. Now that Bitem is the new President, you'll see further erosion. We're still sitting pretty like a little kitty... bye T-monster."
David. Claw backs?? They will get bonuses. We'll see a presentation on how they beat some Low ball goal by 115%. Then will get Hugh amounts of company resources funneled to them all the while the stock price and company flounders. Watch and see.
Technically it looked as if VZ was heading towards substantially below 50 USD.Good for the shareholders here who got Warren Buffet on board.
"Berkshire has about $109 bil in cash, they only like to keep $20bil in cash. Buffet already has some VZ, be a good spot to park some money, take dividends, and wait for appreciation and dump it. IMHO"
In a few weeks when the spectrum auction winners are announced everyone will be back on the VZ bandwagon.
CNBC just said they are dumping VZ
"I just cancelled my Verizon and renewed with Comcast. I did it because Yahoowont allow postings to their articles, they think one sided propaganda can silence Americans.Bye Bye Verizon."
VZ should be doing refi's of some of its high coupon debt. I'm not sure how much of the VZW bonds are callable - I assume most are callable so it's a question of available cash to pay call premiums and fees and then have reduced future period interest expense. It's better to just pay off debt but if you have X dollars available it may be better to use those dollars to refi given the collapse of world interest rates. You can find 10 and 20 year money in Euros under 2% -- VZ has plenty of 4% - 6% debt.
new to vz board. should i buy today or tomorrow on ex div. what are the past historic trend before and after ex div. thanks all
I was actually hoping this would dip a little bit so I could load up on some more
"Who deleted the post about 5g trial runs across the world killing flocks of birds. Perhaps microwaving them. Just think what it could do to humans, once we are exposed to the drastically stronger 5g energy waves, 24/7. So you think you are green ? Think you've thought it through, and 5g is ok ? If you are, you got to look into 5g. It may be much more dangerous to migratory birds than windmills."
"Too quiet with VZ, the XO purchase is done, the Yahoo buy just about complete, wouldn't surprised if there is a major acquisition for VZ (maybe CBS) or some sort of merger with VZ. Who knows maybe google, MSFT, they have good assets and are presently cheap."
"why do you invest in a company that is trying its hardest to repeal the tax cuts, restore the stifling regulations, keep sending 50 billion a month overseas, and quite frankly may help send your job there one day. Why do you stay invested in this globalist garbage can."
This was a really perplexing sell off. People didn't stop using cellphones and if anything a lot of Sprint subscribers will abandon them now that they've merged perhaps they will go to Verizon.
Will 5G save the day for Verizon? When will 5G kick in? Is the roll-out of 5G a good reason to invest in Verizon?
The AT&T store in my town is closed today. Verizon and T-Mobile stores are open with full parking lots. Crazy.

"AMAZON IS COMING, AMAZON IS COMING! Sell at ANY price!!!!!!"
I see my latest post earlier today (12/9/2020) was pulled down by Yahoo. Maybe it's because I said something BAD about Verizon and Yahoo that is TRUE? Could it have been this GIF???
"what's problems of VZ???too low price nobody buy,"
"Hmmm, about 54 when Trump took over and now 46+. I guess this makes as much sense as someone who says their shares went up because of Trump. The market is the market and VZ has made some poor moves and is being punished."
"For many years I’ve been investing or trading in telecom. They is a periodic shift from T, VZ, and TMUS. This is done on purpose. Last year they were screaming bad mouthing T as having too much debt, dead company, yada yada yada. And how VZ was the better play, etc. Now it’s Verizon turn to get bashed. The price will be driven down and money will transfer into T because players like Cramer tell the sheep to invest. Once the price gets to a point, the tide will turn and money will flow back into VZ. Do what the big boys do - buy where others are selling. VZ will be back at $60 in 6 months. Closest thing to a sure thing you can get in this market"
Can someone tell me why I should buy more shares?
"Yahoo has gone over the top. Today's headlines state ""after Trump loss"" and so forth. Report the news, not opinions. Verizon keeps supporting this $h|+. I did reach out to one of Verizon's largest shareholders, and amazingly got a return call. The general consensus is that most larger holders are in it for the dividend, and their view is they don't care what Verizon holds as long as they maintain and increase their dividend. They did note, however, that media is grabbing the attention of more shareholders (they do read these boards, believe it or not) and they are monitoring that division. They agree it's a loser for Verizon but understand what they're trying to do (create recurring revenue streams for ads). But they also do agree it's a distraction from the core business and similar to AT&T wonder why Verizon is waiting so long to jettison underperforming assets."

"Oh Verizon, as a European I just am sad - the Germans crushed you with their head start T-Mobile US Daughter taking Sprint and run past goal in 5G ""first"" - even that bit of band is not enough for IoT.

The cheapest is the $12 for calling and 1G of data, approx. $20 per month with taxes and fees. Why so much more with Verizon? To try to keep this Titanic afloat. I dumped Verizon and saved $60 per month. That's regular rate, no special promo rate that with increase."

"I remember 1986 meeting wise old man in library while researching stocks. He explained to me about buying quality companies with PE of 12 or less....simpler times back then of course, but some things still hold true. PE of 12 or less with 4.5% safe dividend will Always be a true value buy. After our conversation I went out and bought #SLB (which he recommended at the time) and made a lot of money over the years before moving on from that stock, but his wisdom still resonates in my long term buys. Even in Market downturns, a few select stocks should be held as core holdings, while trading any extra capital for the swing trades. #VZ fits this almost to a T.....and that doesn't mean AT&T."

But other carriers have come close enough with coverage etc., to be attractive with the some great phone deals. Still have the stock, and will see if coming back is okay in 2.5 years, as then as a new customer I'll get a deal that makes sense."

"Even in a worst case ""sell-off"" scenario always remember that at the end of the day people will need food, water and will never give up their cell phones especially women. By the way, VZ shareholders get a $2.41 per year dividend, it could always be better but not a bad deal in my estimation."

The left was on track when they talked about universal love. They should go back to that, and send their paid antagonists packing. Every burnt building, every elderly person who gets attacked, every time something happens, thousands of Americans see it, and know they have to act, to save peace. Its hard to believe how ignorant and hurtful the left is, and how terrible the press is for supporting them"
Cant get the virus through the phone or computer. Hum this should be going up!
Well i hope more people like myself get rid of Verizon wireless and fios while saving money and make a anti liberal point
To help prove my point about VZ going to die a long slow death all you have to do is look at the price of put option on VZ stock for 2021 looks like the smart people on Wall Street are already pricing in the drop or they would be giving away the puts and for sure that's not the case.

"Yesterday, CNBC talked to the Vz CEO. Today (3/12/21), they have the T-Mobile (TMUS) CEO, Mike Seivert. Highlights:1) He was dressed very causally in a smiley face T-Shirt using the T-Mobile colors2) Stated that his rivals spent $80B on spectrum and fell short3) TMUS spent $10.5B on C-band auction. He felt they left the auction with the best mid-band spectrum. More than 50% ""better"" in most use cases4) Feels they are now ahead by 2 years. One million sq miles ahead of AT&T and Vz on deployment. More 5G geographical coverage than AT&T and Vz combined.6) 310M consumer postpaid & prepaid customers in US7) Massive cash flow potential8) Broadband - last week, announced their WFH. Later this month, will announce consumer launch plans along a wide stretch of the country9) Sprint: Expect total NPV of merger synergies of +$70B.10) Expects to cover 300M people with low-band by end of the year.11) $160B market value12) Revenue growth of 4%? Didn't really answer the question directly. Just said the TMUS is usually very conservative in their guidance and they have beat the guidance the last 8 years.13) THEN CAME THE VZ QUESTION re. building out the spectrum: ""Vz has chosen not to densify, which means they won't have a competitive product ...or they can spend $10's of billions of dollars to densify and then they will have a competitive product""14) How long will it take Americans to adapt 5G? It's happening fast because every device you buy today is 5G compatible. 15) 5G can be dedicated to the home office worker. Does not need to be shared with the kids.5) Launching in-home broadband later this month"
I expect some volatility in the short term since Monday the telecommunication sector is getting reclassified as communications sector. This could explain the drop today and possibly Monday as well.

TIME TO BUY! THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND WILL BE COMING SOON! GREAT TIME TO BUY!
How long will the shareholders put up wit Lowell. Market up over 1% Verizon still going down. Need new management. The decision to let copper rot was a bad decision if fiber was not going to replace all copper. Wireless is saturated no new growth. Lowell only knows wireless he is very shortsighted. Bring back Ivan
5G will be VZ's savior but not this year. Hold and win.

Good news is working against us today! This drop is interesting...
"VZ will be smacked with pension loss in Q4. Should be over $1B or more and will reduce eps. This is due to stock market drop in Q4""18. Good news it will flow back if stock market stays up in Q1""19"
"Learn to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL That is what happens when VZ could not see the future that was coming and make the changes they need to do for that future . You end up dying a slow death just like a KODAK"
VZ sleeping giant is ready to wake up w 5G....
"i'll add again if you give me 49.85, tiny bit more"
Heading to $40’s.
"They beat the street's eps number; yet, it continues downward. What is wrong?"
"This had basically went nowhere the last year. Keep giving me thumbsdowns all you want, it won't change the facts. The opportunity cost of holding this is huge."
"It appears the fund(s) that was dumping may be done. Maybe, haha."
"IS THE MGMT. TEAM THAT BAD!!!!, GOSH THE STOCK ACTS TERRIBLE, NO ANNOUNCEMENTS, PLUS WHY AREN'T THEY BUYUNG SHARES BACK????"
The Union Has Been Beaten by Verizon. Score One For America.. With the Verizon Union Slobs losing their health insurance coverage at Midnight tonight. Many will be losingtheir life savings in the coming weeks. Their personal well-being will be ruined. Score one for Verizon andAmerica. The Union Slobs are being beaten to a pulp. We love it!
OK. So they know what they are doing. ... Kinda knew that.
"I switched and reduced my cell phone bill 50% - I was a VZ customer for 20+ years. Regardless, the Fed's dog-n-pony show will continue. Looking at the BOD, VZ is a consumer driven conglomerate guided by marketing more than technology, but the company sure made a mess of the Yahoo finance pages, and destroyed Tumblr, so I can't help wondering what else is really messed up. 5G maybe? And is anyone listening to customers? As long as the stock price is up all is good. meh."

"Look out below .We are so over priced on nothing. Big deal jobs report.Whole system over priced. These jobs pay nothing fools. Whole system is and has been manipulated with below market rates, All this by world governments etc to prop up and make markets go up. All this was done with ridiculous well below market interest rates to force savers/investors into stock markets. This is why the whole system will collapse on this reality. Wake up america. Biggest scam by FED continues."

"I wish CEO Lowell McAdam would stop focusing on promoting his white male privilege ultra-liberal ideology in favor of DACA/Dreamers and promoting women and minorities (but not ousting him from his job of course) and focus instead on stock appreciation. Ugh. (Over)time for him to go please. We need stock appreciation, not another liberal hypocrite CEO."
Don’t jinx it!
Verizon's Future with 5G nationwide rollout is too bullish to not reach $100 within 2-3 years.

"Verizon is a typical utilities stock,buying Disney at say a 15% premium would be almost a merger of equals (actually DIS would be bigger at $120 or so) ,then Verizon would be doing a Time-Warner suicide.Watch CNN for 5 minutes,Disney's future,old content creator.More interesting stuff made by PewDiePie on YouTube for free.Verizon stick to being a utility!"
worst stock
Keep going Verizon. VZ and CVS have been doing well for me.
"Some really volatile moves here recently, mostly downwards.. Higher interest rates scaring people?"
VZ looks like catching dropping knife with its blade. It will comes down more.It seems there is no bottom for VZ except 0 ZERO NADA.
Bad earnings?
Lets go $50 or below by Q1 Earnings. Very Bearish outlook ahead.
close $60+ today
See the trend. ..The top management is hiding some where!
Verizon is starting to look like a nice big. I don't have any position but I was bearish before and now I'm not. There might be a little more pullback but I think the market is overly bearish on the yahoo acquisition and undervaluing them because of it. They might drop to 40-45 short term but I see 60s in a year or so.
"I wonder if Warren is being greedy right now when everyone is fearful and gobbling this up.Or you know, maybe he and all his team did tons of research, accessed info that peons like us don’t have access to, invested billions in December, then you know, just decided to sell and exit a couple months later "

Verizon: 2Q Earnings Snapshothttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-2q-earnings-snapshot-113327586.html
the anti-market. this will lose Monday as the market will be Green.
AT&T and Verizon continues to lose more customers toward the end of 2017. Customers are moving on to Sprint and T-Mobile.
Hans need to go ! $50.00 is unacceptable !
I’ve decided to short vz in the rips... it’s a shorts dream I’ve realized
T is a much better buy. Dramatically higher dividend yield and the stock is super undervalued due to the ongoing DOJ dispute over CNN.
Almost back to COVID meltdown low of March 2020
"Verizon owns yahoo small business service, I have ERROR 14 on my business email that you transitioned to your new platform. This has gone on for over 5 days now, and emails sent to my business bounce back to sender!!! I call for support ticket and thick accented Indian voice people come on and tell me they have it escalated... BUT that I am starting to realize is bull #$%$. Just think about being closed down on your business for 5 days and not being able to communicate with anyone via email. Serriously flawed operation. VERY BAD. How long should I wait before I pull domain and point to another service elsewhere?"
48.00 next stop
"Exclusive: AT&T considers cellphone plans subsidized by ads?????????????????? just what i want , more advertising ... this sounds like a lead balloon to me .... if you deliver what a customer needs you can charge appropriately and don't need tricks ... do they think that people actually like ads ??????????????????????????? why not allow robo callers full access to your system ???"
"Going to skyrocket past $80+ minimum with 5G Domination for VZ, Load up and think later, Period."

"T-Mobile p/e too high and it doesn't have enough money to build 5G networks, at&t have too much problems, SO don't buy this two companies, buy Verizon,"
"How about yahoo finance using ghost names for content to our right. They realize half thee people here wont read their propaganda, so they create fake news sources. omg. By the way, I am telling amazon how verizons yahoo finance is making fun of their tax increase protests. It will be nice when Bezos and his newspaper did up dirt on Verizon, and scare away customers and investors. One day Verizon shareholders will wake up and demand an end to yahoo finance. its already hurt them with fewer clicks on yahoo stories and less revenue. or maybe Verizon shareholders are globalists, and they don't care about Verizon profits, just fall in line with the agenda."
"After all the censuring Yahoo has done, who in their right mind would link all their brokerage accounts through Yahoo? I sure as hell don’t trust Yahoo to keep ANYTHING confidential."
Bottom has been hit and up from here................
Can not believe that Vz is still going up. Not close to getting a dividend. Predict it will fall early next week. Chip stocks and google on fire. Along with other tech stocks. Though we are head and shoulders better run than T
"Verizon and AT&T are NO 1 stock, high dividend, stable business, NO1 services too, my Verizon cellphone never dropped call, GPS and 4G network very good."
Concerning that a CEO would have so little concern over a changing industry. It seems odd that his emphasis is not on advancing with the industry even if he doesn't see it as right away. Those who fail to adapt fall behind.
Verizon will be reporting an additional $4.00 per share to the previously exprected $3.97 per share for year ending 2017 by saving 17Blb in deferred taxes. Expect a huge jump on earnings day.
wrong way down not up
"The CEO of Verizon should be on Undercover Boss, and see how thousands of low paying Verizon Customer Service reps are falling behind on their car payments, their house payments, their cancer treatment payments, and their legal payments."
HEY - this POS only has another 80 cents or so to fill the gap - what a POS stock.
"I haven't followed that, but anything Warren does is bad for the usa.I will continue to invest in VZ. You are somewhat blind if you expect ALL investments you make to agree with ALL of your political views. You are no doubt unaware of many conflicts. GL"

Buys coming in. Don't wait too long!
VZ needs to start chipping away at its debt
Remember down and RED like the communist company VZ has now become only sell any moves higher in VZ

"Anyone elses ""My Yahoo"" page down with RSS feeds not working? been like that all day"
"Just a sampling of the headlines on Verizon's Yahoo page:* As virus rages, some say it's too late to stop it* FBI steps in after Trump supports attack Biden busand my personal favorite:* AOC shows what a hypocrite Marco Rubio is for criticizing democratic socialismLet that last statement sink in for a while. And it's worse over on Huffington Post. Wait until Verizon has an annual meeting in person again. I plan on being there and disrupting it."
"Good VZ is DOWN and RED like the communist company VZ has now become LOL,LOL"
Next inflection point is 55$ for VZ. If we break through that it will be smooth sailing to 60.
I'm already getting my comments pulled for today. FYI - I dumped all of my VZ shares (several thousand) as I do NOT believe in this company's viewpoints. The stock can climb all it wants. I want NOTHING to do with it any longer. NOTHING.
I hope VZ does better than S&P500!
Yay! Finally back up to 1999 price!!!!!!!!
Everyone forgot the last time I called their foul ball with the TEVO 2.5 billion dollar fine. Pennies for this corporation when it’s coming out of their workers pockets and share holders who eat their lies up and now we going to 40’s folks
Anyone think this stock will see $65?
Yahoo news is stale when they repost it. It’s like the day old bread  bin!
Yahoo Lets The Media Post News Rather It Be True Or FALSE. Mostly being Fake News. BUT THEY WONT LET YOU RESPOND!!! Why Is That Verizon???? Will it arise again after the Elections?? I would rather Verizon just shut Yahoo Down as there are other sites gaining traction....................ace

"VZ down again in a huge market rally. Why isnt VZ CEO's responding to T-Mobile's strategy today to buy VZ customers?? Say something, for god-sake, to control the narrative. He should have had something prepared. Very poor leadership."
"To the idiot making all the new bear accounts. At least make it believable, by changing the way you post. What a sad life you must have."
Warren Buffett always said “ I would rather buy a good company at a fair value than a good value on a fair company” and I think that is completely true with VZ over T. Looking to add as this should be a strong late cycle play going forward. Long VZ!
"Buffett,Buffett sat on a muffett.I have owned VZ for a decade and I like the dividend and the fact that telecommunications is recession proof.5G growth is coming the question is how soon?"
"At this price, (I use this as my bond), quite a bargain. Folks are buying gold, and bonds. The T-mobile/Sprint, is being held up in Cali. A new foreign player, (the aforementioned merger, has some concerned). But, Vz is ahead of them with 5G. And Vz has the best network. 5G is being held up due to AAPL supply problems. As usual we are a safe port in a storm. Dividend increase on the way too."
"LOL,LOLLOL Get ready to SAY OH NO DOWN VZ goes , LOL,LOL Down and RED like the Communist company VZ Has become under Han's and his EU one world order CENSORING Natzi's DOWN and RED told you to only Sell any moves higher in all your stocks"
Almost time to buy. Should drop to $43-44 to purchase. This stock has been flowing like this for years. Drop drop drop until just before earnings. Then a steady rise up to ex date. Easy money
my last post was because you can't talk to someone at Verizonmaybe someone in PR will see this.
6 month chart tells it all......good luck!
Don’t fight the cyclicality of this. What a game. This is a high barrier of entry industry top brand that has invested heavily in its success in the coming years. It has plenty of predictable cash flow and liquidity for the foreseeable future and can now further take stamp of approval by having BH take a major stake in it.Investor Day is March 10th. It’ll run up until then.

"Big money knows something. Apparently, going to be a bid for a content company. Always amazed that Netflix can trade up 22 points just on subscriber growth and trades a large multiple. Also amazed that legacy companies pay for all the infrastructure build out and can’t make the freeloaders pay. Net neutrality is just a big giveaway placed on the backs of VZ and ATT of the world. Yet VZ gets hardly any love."

"You've got to love the supporters of free speech at Yahoo/VZ. We have to stop free speech in order to have free speech. I'm sure that the comments section will open up on November 4th...yeah right. They will just continue the work of shutting down opposition the way that Twitter and Fakebook does. One more thing...if you believe that it isn't Hunters laptop, why is there an email in the inbox from Hunter's attorney requesting the laptop back? Maybe the ""press"" needs to ask and get an answer from ""Pop"" other than asking about which flavor of milkshake he ordered? Just saying. Trump 2020"
too much debt
stock keeps tanking daily and you never here from the Lowell!!! Please get rid of this guy!!!!!!
Buy at 45 
SAw a post on here which said the two day sell off was due to the amount of debt VZ carried. Guess it does not matter today.

Wait, she didn't say she didn't like them, just that they are all psychopaths.In 2014, Buffet owned 11 million shares of Verizon. If everyone who was attacked by Yahoo Finance would sell their verizon shares they own, the world would be a better place, and maybe then Yahoo Finance would report, instead of marching to the agenda. The net worth of Lowell C McAdam is 59 million. One day, sooner than you think, AOC will start targeting millionaires."

VZ is a dead growth company. They only thing you buy it for is the dividend. 5 year chart is horrible. Will trade between $45-48? Yield almost at 5% again. If your happy with just the dividend collection its a good stock to own.
In Verizon we trust.
crazy iam buying great deal thankyou
"back to reality at least a thousand point sell/off. We are so over priced. Just Federal reserve games with rates, Have pumped up markets again like last 11 years. Wake up people. Yep screwed savers last 11 years playing/ manipulating markets/rates."
Go Go Go!!!!
I keep getting new offers from Verizon now that I have cancelled almost everything. For the last few years they stuck it to me. Let’s hope there wonderful stock goes straight down
WHERE IS COCO- question is will this get above that 61 4% yield price?MY ID SAYS IT ALL OVER AND OVER EVERY DAY
why would any company buy a fake news network

"VZ hopefully going to break out head back above $60, Warren Buffett has the scope on this one!!"
If I buy tomorrow do i get the dividend or the seller ?
new format sucks
"VZ doesn't need YHOO. Not a good fit, declining asset. Will require huge amount of Cash & Time to Fix and Integrate. A wasted 4.8 Billion by VZ. They might not even try to Fix it."

"I wonder if Verizon will keep these yahoo message boards.I hope Verizon stops the anti American worker rants that yahoo ran, and then later used Business Insider for.Can you imagine subscribing to Business Insider, and find out its just an anti Trump, anti American propaganda rag."

"Morgan Stanley downgrades Verizon (NYSE:VZ) from Overweight to Equal-Weight saying the firm has hit the $58 price target while ""already priced at a premium.""Great- you believe Morgan Stanley?

"The Fed just raised rates again. And expect to do so once more by year end. WHY ????They are expecting the economy to cool off in 2019, and again in 2020.For the first time in decades, wages in the US are rising. Why can't the FED let people get a decent wage. Oh, that's right, cause Verizon and comcast and hundreds of other companies might make 1% less profit, and cost management billions in bonuses. Think about it. Are you better off having Verizon stock go up a bit, or making 10% more in salary for the rest of your career. The FED is killing your wage potential."

TMUS & S merger would be good news for T & VZ. TMUS & S would no longer have to resort to suicidal price competition to survive. 3 companies on fairly equal footing would mean bigger profits available for all 3.
Shoulda Coulda Woulda have stayed on the T-rain like I told you guys. The Halo Effect of T's growth spurt will only carry VZ so far now. This is not a knock against VZ. It is just that they are right where they need to be priced. T is not. By a lot. And has bigger fish in the pot for the future.

"Added 50 shares to get in at 50.09, I’m in for the long haul now! Can’t wait for Verizon 5G Home technology"
Verizon leadership needs to step up their game & be more vocal. Their brand is getting trounced in the media every day. Buying also-rans Yahoo & AOL while losing subs is just very bad optics. 1 year performance relative to the market has been abysmal. The reason I bought VZ over T was the leadership team. I am very disappointed. Couldn't have made a worse decision.
people a have to be mor$## not to buy this stock.
I tried to post something that disagrees with OBLAMER And it keeps getting deleted HMM
Is this worth holing long term for the income from dividends or is there something fundamentally wrong here?
"""With All Eyes On The Presidential Race, Nobody Is Talking About This Troubling Republican Victory""This is the headline story ran by Verizon/Yahoo. Why t-f is it ""troubling""? Verizon is nothing but a support platform of biased demo-puke."
"Verizons yahoo finance now running a story about the market being one or two events from a major melt down. The truth is, a melt down could happen on any given day. So why post it now ? Simple.We can see how they chose now as the time to post it, in order to undermine the Presidents efforts to stop China from stealing 50 billion a month, and technology.So how many shares of Verizon does China own ? Did China tell Verizon they won't ship any phones to Verizon customers if they didn't try to help China ? Did they tell Verizon their Chinese phones would stop working if they didn't help ?50 billion a month, plus technology goes to China. If US citizens had 50 billion extra per month to spend, a nice part of that would be spent on phones and wireless plans. Why does Verizon work hard to keep its customers from prospering ?You should ask Verizon at a shareholder meeting. better yet, sell out, like they sold you out."
Yahoo finance up for sale earlier by VZ??? Say it ain't so !!! ;-)
I am waiting for this to dip under $53 and I’m dropping another 1K on it
So everyone is saying don't bet against the Fed. The Fed has said for the past week through every regional president that even everything we throw at it will be a long recovery.
What the heck happened to VZ yesterday ? Couldn't have been a hangover from the Vestberg announcement or was it related to ATT getting the go head on the merger ?
"So what's this $h|+ being posted on Yahoo? Yahoo implying the president is at ""serious risk"" with Covid, and now that his positive test is ""destabilizing"" to the DC area. Neither statement is true, but here we are with Verizon supporting this libel. As a shareholder I am angered by this."
"Sold all my position, I might return in case of 15% correction."
"AT&T gross profit = 97B, VZ = 77B and you can get more shares of T for same price as VZ..Am I right?"
"Great quarter, great dividend. Just hang on and collect the money"
just wanted to write happy properous new years with investments I just wanted to say this since I do have investments with this company thank you Daddy.for your wisdom.
54.30 was the strike price VZ issued 50 restricted shares to employees Feb 1 25 of those will be paid out per employee. was does this do to the stock? 80k times 25??? sold Asking cause not sure.
Is Dr. Jill as guilty as her son.
split screen demo on right of the screen for yahoo page..just send it for the samsung vr..wag.
"#$%$ move to the downside today, T made a big mistake on the merger and VZ is still the best of breed in telecom and has gotten an unwarranted beatdown after a great quarter. Will easily go back up to 50"
VZ Should sell off Yahoo while it’s still worth something!
I see VZ hitting new highs in the next couple of weeks. Great dividend is a bonus here. So under priced here.
So. ... Where's that @R guy telling us again how ATT is so great and VZ sks. ha! Over 120K dollars here I'm not going anywhere. ... Bill taught me well. + Dividends! I guess Steven put him in line this time. ..
Some big jumps in the final few min... I wounder how many days it will hold up this time.
"5G is coming!!! can sprint and t-mobile say THAT!!!NO, only VERIZON. VZ , BABY!!!!"
"Cramer is now pumping T mobile , LOOKs like VZ best of breed is now going to out right disaster"
It appears that Hans is just as good as Lowell at talking VZ stock DOWN.
This stock is junk
great earnings...I fear with the market declining we won't have sustaining power. Tariff issues killing the market. President going to give another 10% cut to taxes? Where's the money coming from?
Amazing spectrum positioning just unveiled by Hans in C band along with mmWave
vz best buy in telecom
ATT. TMUS both up over 1%.... VZ going red..

I get my unlimited 4G LTD for about $15 a month now. Forget VZ. Forget mmWave 5G. Not helping.
Up and down and up and down and up and down.
Only stock going up lol
Maybe this is just about filling the gap...
HAHAHA so much for amazon getting into wireless when govt is going after them....
The stock is trading ex dividend but it is taking a beating beyond that. That shows the stock is treading water. All the 5G talk is not is not panning out
How this stayed green on a day like today show just how oversold it is.
At the moment VZ is the only green DOW component. We'll see what happens later...https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/components?p=%5EDJI
Does anyone knows why this is down almost 2% pre market?
"Bought my first 25 shares for my IRA account on 04-17-13 @ $50.00 Share price appreciation of only +11.28% in just under 8 years, most of which was extremely bullish, simply isn't acceptable.

What can you say about Verizons' Yahoo propaganda machine? They have a full time reporter Little Ricky Newman that was selected by management to spend 99% of his time slinging dirt on President Trump. They turned off comments so there would be no conservative feedback to their lies. This allowed them to freely spread their website with only pro-Biden stories. Dirty politics and business is a bad mix. I will no longer use Verizon or Yahoo & I encourage others who care about the spreading of fake news to do the same.
"Are you ready for VZ to drop under $35 , LOL,LOL,LOL . I bet you would never believe that can happen will you better get ready , because VZ is going to have a MASSIVE drop LOL,LOL,LOL"
A 350 million dollar cut in the price for YHOO just isn't enough. These guys are basically throwing 4.8 billion dollars out the door.
FEd one big joke. Same old games to say they will keep low rates to force savers into stock markets. I say enough already time to get out while way ahead. Has come back so much. Before the next wave of new lows coming.
Bottom going to fall out today.. Downtrend confirmed.. Wouldn't buy over $46

yahoo is a communist organization.
@MT....legging back into #VZ....just fyi...may go lower but feel good entry point. Been trading it for years and holding core for many of them. Dividend is safer than any bank or #T.
"Slow steady growth, reliable juicy dividend, safe..... and they pay their ""union"" employees very well. Verizon is truly America's Company."
fed rate cut wont help. Markets so over priced here already. They have played these games already and any one who got in late will get slaughtered here. All this lowering rates like 2008 era. So to make investors chase for yield. Money markets paid 1% then.Wake up people whole system is corrupt for the rich Yet they pay less taxes then the rest of us. They get all their write offs etc.
"VZ and T are directly comparable even though they are following different strategies. The idea that VZ is somehow inferior to T is not based on facts -- on this board some who try and talk their own books have numerous opinions, some of which are baloney.As to debt, here's how both looked at 6/30/19:Debt to Equity VZ 2.38:1 -- T 1.04Debt to EBITDA VZ 3.2:1 -- T 3.12Interest Coverage VZ 5.9 -- T 3.34The acid test is Debt to EBITDA which measures how fast debt can be paid off if EBITDA remains constant."
where that Coco guy?
I overheard on CNBC last night that VZ is not subjected to any trade tariffs .... can anyone confirm?
TRUMP made RECESSION !
"BREAKING: Dow set to drop nearly 150 points as trade tumult continues to rattle investors ×Goldman Sachs upgrades stumbling Verizon and Charter shares: 'The pipes are not broken'John Melloy | @johnmelloyPublished 8:15 AM ET Thu, 21 June 2018Updated 11:41 AM ET Thu, 21 June 2018CNBC.com￼Getty ImagesPedestrians walk by a Verizon Wireless store on January 22, 2015 in San Francisco, California.Goldman Sachs upgraded Verizon and Charter Communications to buy from neutral, believing the broadband providers have been unfairly punished as other telecommunications giants pursue costly acquisitions.""We believe that broad underperformance across the sector has been driven by a few key factors, including concerns about fundamental headwinds, M&A uncertainty and rising interest rates,"" the Goldman note stated. ""At a higher level, we believe the pursuit of vertically integrated business models (via levered M&A) by some operators has caused investors to question whether large cap stocks in the telecom and cable sector can outperform while the industry is undergoing such significant transformation.""Verizon and Charter are down 9 percent and 14 percent respectively this year amid a judge's approval of AT&T's blockbuster deal for Time Warner and a bidding war for certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets between Disney and Comcast.Comcast and AT&T stocks are both down 17 percent this year.""The pipes are not broken,"" the Goldman note goes on to say. The two companies ""are positioned as long-term leaders in broadband and 5G. Put another way, we believe that both operators can drive attractive long-term shareholder returns by sustaining their core focus on connectivity (i.e. building strong pipes).""Goldman increased its Verizon 12-month price target to $56 from $51 and its Charter target to $361 from $315. Verizon closed Wednesday at $48.09, and Charter ended the day at $290.34.Verizon rose 1.3 percent in premarket trading Thursday, while Charter gained 1.9 percent."
Walmart down exact same % we know where they went and they will be back.
"Hope the earnings are ok tomorrow, otherwise “LOOK OUT BELOW”. Could be a very bad quarter, I’m hoping I’m wrong."
"Each time I get into VZ, I lose money by a few dollars for awhile. Very unpleasant."
Wouldn't a slowing economy eventually hit Verizon shares. We may be able to hide in VZ for so long. GLTA.
Thank you for discounting the V- I was looking for a good entry point
Let me make sure I'm straight on this; Verizon - are you really going to buy this piece of junk called Yeh Hoo
bought more this will recover to 58-59 soon
Time for Verizon/Yahoo to allow Americans to state their opinions. Only coward pukes squelch opinion. That currently fits the bill for these bozos.
#VZ screaming buy here. Nobody giving up cell phone and debt being serviced at close to Zero percent.
"What does this company do again? I thought there were a telecommunications company, then they got involved in retailing hardware now they are a search engine company?"
Tomorrow VZ will do better than other companies watch
whats Verizon issues these last few days
VZ is going to explode and be over 75.00Cant wait for tomorrows news VZ and Berkshire and Buffet are all involved and backing VZ!
hold your shares sit and watch loss and u get a dividend stupid is stupid dose
I dumped my VZ shares when Yahoo turned off article comments. Plus 5G infrastructure build is slow.
I think Warren bought this to keep his understanding on gigantic stake in AAPL.
With near Zero interest rates for years. VZ solid income stock for decades. Sleep well.
"The Dow is up 40% since Trump was elected, VZ, which is a Dow stock, is still in negative territory during that same time period, go figure, probably the worst performing stock in the Dow during that period."
WTH does S/TMUS have to do with VZ? Good grief.
Great Company and buying opportunity.
"The incredible shrinking dividend is coming .............. no need to fret , just reinvest it ... garce"
"The only thing good about Warren buying is it gives you a chance to sell even more VZ at a little higher price before it drops even more . Nothing has chanced VZ still has NO Future and VZ is both losing customers and running off customers and Shareholders , because VZ does not protect Americans First Amendment Rights and even breaks your First Amendment rights that makes VZ a Company that can NOT be TRUSTED and Warren buying shares makes no difference, Just Tells you how billionaire think they could careless about your right."
It's going back to 55 again. Acting like a bum stock.
"Downgrade day before exdividend, why not wait 1 more day?"
Spectacular BUY opportunity.
Looks like Verizon belatedly realizes how bad a Biden would be. Verizon has finally ordered yahoo finance to tell people how bad Biden would be for the market and verizon stock. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/joe-bidens-tax-plan-may-wallop-the-stock-market-heres-one-disturbing-estimate-173751982.html
"Verizon top management, should should fire Yahoo top management of socialists for deleting opposite view....... Yahoo is not contributing properly to Verizon PL."
"Over woke = broke, Selling- VZ violating Buffet rule -keep your politics out of your business- u are running a business not a social venue !!!!"
VZ stock was @61.74 on 12/3 - The day they announced the upcoming dividend.
this stock is going down a lot more. Yahoo move is desperate and a bad idea.
"So Op EPS is supposed to be $1.14 - last Q was only .8 over but the going back Q2 & Q1 it was over about 2,6% so that could make it $1.17. Always a question of revenue growth. VZ has had strong wireless so it could fair better with net sub growth. VZ seems to be more price competitive than a couple of yrs ago. It can be since it has the best operating and profit margins by a mile -- which means it's the low cost provider."
How about a 2 for 1 Stock Split. That would be good.
Will the stock automatically open at $59++ tomorrow with ex div?? Will my $60 weeklys be crushed if I hold them after today??
the more it drops the more I buy
Two words.... Five Gee! Be patient my peeps.
YAHOO and Verizon are in a big mess
VZ much better play than att
I’m surprised VZ is down today. Possibly due to going ex dividend recently??
"Is VZ still buying Lionsgate? Would love to see them slap Amazon out of the party, since they were interested in it too."
Seems like after every weekend another City or area are lit up for 5G wide band.
Earnings were solid and they raised estimates.....patience people. 5G is here is what they're saying in conference....big things coming. Let the weak hands sell the news.
Past few days are a strong reminder as why not to day trade and ignore the noise. Might take some time but once 5G devices come on line to the masses this stock will reward. In the meantime stay long and keep collecting the dividends.
Back up to $60
FIOS sucks. Got new bill and rental box fees increased even if your locked into a plan. And I am a Verizon stockholder but this is BS
VZ = Zzzzzzzzzzz...
I added a little before x-div Wed. or Thur.
"You didn't screw up. You bought stock in a great company with a reliable dividend that goes up every year.Think of it as an income investment, not a trade."
anyone experienced in options please explain to me why VZ call options are down so much and T are all up. percentage wise the stocks are at same gain today
"Solid quarter,, and good guidance."
Lol to those that don’t believe VZ is a great dividend stock.
"So AT&T is going to the well to the tune of $14 BILLION. Wasn't that what Verizon was supposed to spend IN TOTAL on this C-Band auction? Once again, I bring FACTS: https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/at-t-looks-to-borrow-14b-for-5g-spectrum-reportCowen is reporting LAST WEEK that Verizon had spent $35 billion (Cowen estimate); so what that's suggesting is it will be north of $40 BILLION, plus their share of the satellite relocation costs (maybe another $4-6 BILLION). I just can't imagine a nearly $50 BILLION spend for spectrum. It's really making the Sprint purchase look like one he|| of a bargain for T-Mobile. Anti-trust aside, it would have been WELL WORTH Verizon to have looked at Sprint, probably spin off some of it to massage the anti-trust people. What do you say, Hans???"
"I have verizon. I surf Yahoo. I use less than 0.5GB a month. since VZ has,taken over Yahoo, I used 4GB IN July and am on track for 4GB after 3 days in August for the month. I think VZ is screwing customers who use yhoo. I rarely use data and now I'm through the roof."
$VZ is a scam. Their services are overpriced. Huge chunks of their services are be taken out by cheaper competitors with just as reliable service. BK in 5 years or less.
Verizon is ripping off the consumers. I live in countryside and I pay $75 just for DSL internet bc there's no body in my area who provides internet. I am their customer for 30 years. DSL internet service requires to have landline telephone which we hardly use but we are paying for it . It appears no body care in Verizon except profit motivation.
How is less competition bad for VZ? cuz its not..buy buy buy.
hi
"I hold this for a year hope to return 15% that enough for me , best the than put in CD account."
Strong Buy. https://cweb.com/2018/03/23/is-verizon-undervalued-at-its-current-price-cweb-com/

"from the look of the pps, Hans spoke again."
good candidate for short. 35-40$ ideal valuation
should rally to around 46 by next week
Down Again

"CMCSA wireless didn't hurt Verizon, charter wireless too, but Verizon 5G networks sure be get a lot of customers from cable company, because 5G networks (wireless) better than cable ,So CMCSA and charter maybe bankruptcy, VZ is #1,T is #2,forget others."
Can anyone tell me why i would pay more for 5G.

sold yesterday and bought T. I will be back after I become rich!
What is with this stock?? Companies not even making money and no dividend trade much higher than this company. A 300 point gain and this stock can't hold onto any gains?? This is absurd.
going back to 58======VOMIT AT LEAST I SOLD 300 LAST NITE @61.01
I hope it tanks stock has done nothing with Lowell send him on with the rest that was laid off in April

They offer a similar enhanced buyout deal to union wrkrs as well---- same DAY Soooooo--- They settled ANY possible Union strifes They streamlined payroll by millions They are on the cusp of rolling out 5G Could they possibly be MORE attractive for a BUYOUT ?The only question, and it's a BIG ONE----- WHO ??? Hmmmm"
"A comparison of Operating Margin and Profit Margin of the big 4 during the last 12 months shows:1. VZ Op margin 27% Profit Margin 12.2%2.T Op margin 18.4% Profit Margin 10.6%3. TMUS Op Margin 12.9% Profit Margin 7.1%4. S Op Margin 11.5% Profit Margin 0.9%I own VZ & T -- mainly VZ and it looks like VZ's margins are headed up given the $10 B expense reduction plan underway. A key component was the 10,400 employees who took the buyout last yr. What the above tells me is that VZ will be the low cost per wireless provider. It will be difficult for TMUS or S or both combined to continue to compete on price with VZ. The Op margin is interesting - TMUS is not that far ahead of S -- although S has a big debt load. Hopefully we will see VZ shoot past the 30% Op Margin level and 15% Profit Margin next yr. VZ of course needs to pay down & refi debt to see the Profit Margin head to the 20% level."
Defund VZ!!!
52wk high soon.................................
"what the hell is wrong with Verizon, market goes up like crazy and Verizon sinks. what the hell.???????"
what will happen next week?? going to 52? i really hope so but i think the rally slowly coming back to neutral before taking off again? any strong graphs analyse on the board that can give us some insight??????
Time to buy T. After all the dividend and FCF is better than VZ

"Global propaganda arm of Verizon, yahoo finance, tells us how congress is limiting consumers right to sue, when companies are negligent. What yahoo finance doesn't tell you, is that hardly anyone signed any agreements with Equifax. Your credit history was sent to them, without your knowledge, or approval. Most consumers never signed an arbitration agreement with any of the credit companies. As usual, another globalist spreading outright lies. If globalism is so great, why must THEY lie about everything ?"
"Verizon got a real dog when it got Yahoo. I have been a Yahoo Merchant for over a decade and service continues to plummet. I have had a case number (616170) open for over a month, regarding emails kicking back due to suspect spam and it is still an issue cost me $$$. Customer Service and the technical team is useless. Yahoo, Aabaco, Luminate, Verizon or whatever they call themselves today continue to re-arrange the deck chairs on the Titanic but it is sinking faster than ever. Both investors and customers need to cut their loses and abandon ship. I strong suggest that customers flee to WIX. All of my acquaintances with WIX sites and services are extremely satisfied. Run Forest, run!"
The market keeps going up. VZ is essentially where it was 5 years ago. #$%$

where is that Coco fruitty guy
Verizon deserves to lose customers. I always thought they were the best. The service over the past year has been horrible. Phone service is pitiful. 3G...yep...that's what we get. I call someone. It rings on my end and not the person I am calling. Both on Verizon. This has been going on for over a year. missing so many phone calls. Everyone is better off going with someone like Sprint. #$%$ service at half the price. Verizon. #$%$ service at double the price. Your choice. It's all based on price now. Verizon doesn't have the service it once had and they will not put the money that is needed into. I guarantee it.
Vz upside is small.prpo will be 10 times.watch after earnings
For millions of Americans our nightmare has begun
"The Nasdaq has doubled over the last 5 years, and Verizon has only managed 15% ."
Verizon due to move UP! Time to buy more.

WOW you just can not make this stuff up when it's OH SO true. LOL,LOL,LOL Better lern to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
Doesanyone have a clue what just happened? Opened down seventy cents ..no news?
VZ = every day red
"is this market really a market and for investors anymore,,seems its more a shorters game and day traders flip,,not a long term view anymore,, anyone see it that way"
"no worries folks. This really is a scenario where the weak hands jumped ship. This allowed me to buy more on the dip. Oversold, seriously.Have patience and it'll go back up in a few days, perhaps even tomorrow."
"I think that in 5yrs people will be saying, ""I wish I bought Verizon stock back then!"", after the realization of how 5G has changed the world we live. At the very least, as an investor, it's smart to own the network, the power source and the companies who innovate around the network."
Is this a good time to start building a position?
Got to send thanks to the idiot who started Disney merger rumor picked up another 200 @$44 a few months ago!
"“Sprint is the only US carrier to currently offer 5G on what is known as midband spectrum. This frequency that allows for faster data connections than the low-band 5G network T-Mobile turned on for 200 million people on Friday, but with significantly more range than the higher frequency millimeter-wave 5G currently favored by Verizon.” CnetFor 5 bucks and change, and Duopoly/cableopoly’s last hope via Judge Marerro at the SDNY to kill a Fed approved merger commencing now courtesy of the tax payers of VZ’s home state New York and their somehow elected AG Letitia James, not to mention country staying on top of China, or Dish, or anything, share if Sprint anyone?"
"Did you know T Mobile was founded by the EU's one world order to collect data. I would not be doing any business with T mobile or now even VZ sense Han's from the EU has taken over and you can tell by their action of the EU one world order censoring Yahoo NATZI's that VZ is now not an American company by their own actions of censoring Americans even their own customers and shareholders. The Government has taken notice and given the first responders to T , next I would not be surprised to see all the military bases only have T service. The last thing you want is all your data going to the EU and they sell it to China"
sheeps suddenly buying
I've read many of the comments/discussion here. Is VZ buying Yahoo ? WHY would they do that? Yahoo is irrelevant. Is this a done deal ?The stock is TANKING !! #$%$ !!
"Puzzled about Yahoo Finance message board performance. What a mess. Seems broken by saturation maybe. Came here because you guys own it. Any plans? I guess it makes money on advertising as long as liability is limited. My investments are elsewhere, mostly utilities for the dividends, but yield here looks attractive also. No appreciation over 20 years must be a concern while all the averages have at least tripled in that time. Hope nobody planned their retirement around this."
"I keep getting blocked / deleted when I post anything about Y-hoo. So now they're putting up sister publication Huff Post article that Trump said to vote twice. Yes, I kid you not. That's not what he said, but that's what they're reporting. VZ Board of Directors - PLEASE DO YOUR JOB"
When will acquisition of Straight Path Communications by Verizon be completed?
It's all about who controls the last mile and tomorrow VZ wins!
"imagine....the S and P.....on a selloff.......this VOMIT will go into the 30s...............go ahead and denie, SCHMUCKS...as it hits another multy year low............."
I tried to sell covered calls on my 2000 shares at the close yesterday and missed by a penny. Would have cost me $6000. Lesson learned. Shorts are having to cover which will drive the price higher through tomorrows close. Until yesterday shorting Vz before earnings was a sure thing!
"Wow, almost back to where it was 9/1/99."
What nonsense!!!!! What does Verizon have to do with China?............Nothing. Recent earnings reported were good; dividend is good; and company rolling out 5G. This stock is a buy all day long. Whatever manipulation is going on is just foolishness. Buy; buy; buy!
"Yahoo Finance, the Mein Kempf of Verizon, says the tax cuts are flopping. If that is so, I encourage Verizon to pay the old tax rates. And their shareholders."
I saw this below:Danny23 hours agoHuffington Post up for sale. Good riddance to that liberal bias rag. Another Lowell waste of money. Notice how VZ stock price improved with him gone? Just saying.Hold on -- Lowell did some very good deals -- Yahoo & AOL was not one of them -- but it was Lowell who pushed to sell wireline starting in 2005 selling Hawaii thru the last sale to FTR in 2016. He dropped a $5 bil bundle but overall he cashed out of wireline avoiding much bigger losses holding on to wireline. And Ivan picked him so that's good enough for me.
Starting my position in $VZ today. Not calling a bottom by any means but making 10-15% moves/investments to build a long-term position. The fear based market will calm eventually! The strong stocks/companies will survive.
Volare oh oh!
Why is this freaking down???????
"Apparently it's over for Verizon. Poor leadership has ruined this company. I have owned the stock for 12 years, and it has consistently underperformed the market. Dead money"
CTL backhaul for TMUS wireless spectrum is what saves Merger. Read the issues before.https://www.wraltechwire.com/2011/05/16/would-centurylink-buy-sprint-if-att-merger-wins-ok/
"Yahoo Finance says Mark Cuban is tired of the rich benefiting from every cataclysm. Ok, sounds good. SO lets also stop giving billions in tax benefits and credits to the rich, like Mark, who has the govenrment build them arenas and football and baseball stadiums. Hey Mark, how about paying off the arena your team plays in without government help, with your own money."
"What a day, T down to nothing, VZ down to nothing, FTR down to nothing, Win up, why I don't know, CTL who knows."
what is date the dividend gets PAID?
What up ? Great day to buy more
"Yahoo Finance, the propaganda arm of Verizon, is quoting Susan Rice's thoughts about the corona virus.Like anyone cares. She lied on all the Sunday morning talk shows about Benghazi. She authorized spying on private citizens during the last general election. She shouldn't be out and around now. She should be talking to her prison guards, serving a 10 year sentence for abusing FISA. The question is, why does Verizon so hate American workers and the American way of life. Those of you thinking they are profiting from owning this stock are sadly wrong. Your pennies you make now will not mean anything when we go to socialism. And Verizon is helping to divide the country, and tear it down. open your eyes, how ignorant and greedy can you be."
"Verizon is poised to make a move above $80 this year, Get in while it's still insanely cheap !"
"Yahoo Finance laughably talks about Biden using the tax code to go after China.Biden will do nothing of significance against China.Why change after 47 years of helping China. Its all talk. He will say anything to get a vote.They plan on naming Tiananmen Square, Biden Boulevard after the election, honoring Joe for the billions of dollars, and millions of jobs he helped give them."
"Retired, own bothVZ and T . Collect the dividends. Own both for 8 plus years."
verizon probably be 62 end of the next week
"Just hours ago, I saw an amazing concurrence of events. We all know that 5G news is just about everywhere. It is like the flu. But tonight on CNBC, Jim Cramer’s Mad Money Show, they interviewed the CEO of Qualcomm. His name is Steve Mollenkopf, in the opening moments he talked about companies that are on the forefront of every revolution. He spoke first of Verizon, no mention of AT&T at all. Then mentioned previous revolutions like blackberry, Motorola, and of course his company Qualcomm. He strongly hinted that they were very close to settling with Apple. Back to 5G, he estimated there are thirty industries that will be disrupted by this new spectrum. He mentioned auto (self driving cars), and healthcare (surgical procedures done remotely). But then, I HOPE CRAMER STILL HAS A JOB, Jim asked about cable tv. His employer is Comcast, or Crimecast, as Vz workers sometimes referred to them as. Mr. Mollenkopf replied that in a lot of places in the world you will no longer see that service. Then he educated us all by saying that the cost of providing these incredibly fast speeds, will be 1/30th of the older, antiquated equipment. So, I say we are spot on by accumulating these shares. The Qualcomm CEO also said that this is the most exciting thing he has seen in his 25 year career. I watched it twice to make sure I got all this right. Please Google for your friends."
If I was the CEO of VZ I would look very hard at Ericsson ERIC this company is moving up and has all the tools 5G a sleeping Giant

"SO THE ANALYST THINKS ""t"" IS UNDERVALUED COMPARED TO VERIZON.That was the thesis for the downgrade. T has a higher debt to equity, trying to digest a big acquisition and has cash flow no where near VZ.This is wall street at its best- downgrade to get your friends in. Watch as VZ recovers after a few days and makes a new high."
does anyone know when will be the divided date for this quarter..
When 5G comes out and the telecoms eat up all broadband business Verizon is going to come out as king
The scam of the century CNBC reported on false news story by STAT that said there was cure by GILD and some whale was selling in after hours. They got a bunch of people. Ouch
"Looking at 57.90 now premarket - VZ held up amazingly during pandemic even with index sell offs. What a great a stock to hold for dividends long term. I started a position after pandemic started, got in below 52"
"Hello Verizon. Just want to let you know that your Yahoo news page is nothing but Trump-bashing, America-hating, conservative opinion-squelching, liberal-loving, dishonest, biased demo-blather. Have a nice day."
Serious overreaction to what was only a slight revenue & subs miss. Let the weak hands get out so stronger ones can move in and scoop up the discounted shares.
Put these 2 on your list today . (NIO) (CJJD) both 100 percent buy on barcharts website. With the China trade deal a no brainer.
where did the VZ to $100 crowd go?
Go Big Red............
Terms not released.....probably didn’t get enough selling this turd to pick up the lunch tab
Is Verizon has the advantage as far as G5 technology goes ?

Communist communications should be investigated for colluding with a foreign power to influence the election.
"this is unreal, Is this corona going to put all companies out of business, or is VZ just not going to make it,, what gives, What does Corona virus have to do with VZ, NOTHING so this is shorters game now,"
My father always told me to buy stock that threats customers with respect. Had Verizon stock while up and down. But had nothing but trouble with Verizon under the aspecess
Ok Verizon.
where is Coco these days?
"VZ upgraded yesterday, on value"
"In case any of you are wondering what IoT looks like, here is a very simple example:https://www.therobotreport.com/white-castle-miso-robotics-test-flippy-roar-frying-robot-fast-food-trials/I've programmed Fanuc robots (the 200i series are wonderful and very flexible). They are great robotic arms. Imagine a factory filled with hundreds (thousands?) of them. You need a CLEAN COMMUNICATION NETWORK to carry all that packet data. This stuff is still in its infancy. We will eventually see it everywhere in the next 10-20 years. Guess who will be at the front of the line for this? Verizon. AT&T is carving out entertainment. T-Mobile is more consumer. Verizon will be the hybrid, and will use its networks to support IoT initiatives, which will be much higher value than pre-pay consumer phones."
"Sprint and T-Mobile don't merger is very good news for Verizon, because Sprint and T-Mobile profit margin too low, they can't make more discount, plus they don't have enough money to build 5G networks, SO Verizon's front view very good, SO Verizon stock sure be back to New high, price war has been bottom out, PC Metro, cricket and boost mobile price have no more discount long time and something price rise,"
Put a pitchfork in it. VZ is done. No vertical... No media.... No Nothing but talk and text.
I say crash and burn time. Markets playing same old games. Pump and dump time. Blame the FEd once again for screwing savers to pump markets with rate cuts period. Now the whole system will nose dive on bad news coming.
Vz is far better company than T-Mobile Vz stock price should be more or at least the same as T-Mobile.Hopefully soon Thanks
The price can go down. Warren is probably averaging in on another $8 bil.
Got to watch those fakeouts!
Sell
hopefully VZ does better than heinz
bagholders on this board--- what is VZ total return for past 10 years??? I could have picked the worst growth fund with high expense ratio and earned more money!!!!!what happened to 5G??? ask Hans---- the management team should be able to answer.. How is that debt doing???
"VZ wireless customers increase and fios customers increase, that means wireless monthly fee have been bottomed out, plus 5G networks, VZ sales can keeping continue growth ,SO VZ can continue rise to $80 per share next year."
This looks very promising.http://www.nasdaq.com/article/verizon-vz-inoks-extended-carriage-deal-with-ae-networks-cm900816
Buffet aint the same guy he used to be. Seems like he only buys these days to stay relevant.
"It's lunchtime. The stock will rise again before the day is out. Steal at this price, with the dividend just around the corner."
"I come to the yahoo message boards for the sharing of ideas, and having informative news stories along the right side.For some reason, Verizon seems to think that Business Insider is somehow in the business of giving us valuable information. They are not. Verizon, everyone thinks your news sources are a joke. Its too bad you didn't improve that after buying yahoo."
Nice gain today. Now all the profit takers will take it down tomorrow of course.
"VZ SHEEPLES to the SLAUGHTER the next GE LOL,LOL,LOL That could not see the future they faced"
"investors realized there is no real 5G, except fake 5G"
Huge news today with WeWork. This is just the beginning guys....$$

Watch for a late day rise today....
"ATT is the better BUY right now. By a mile. Both are two sides of the same coin but VZ has not been impacted by negative press to artificially deflate stock price.Also. ATT has a LOT more future proofing than just a one trick 5G pony which all carriers will have. Do not fool yourself thinking that adding content (NFL Ticket, HBO, Movie passes to Blockbusters, DTV Now subs) in a Data Free streaming option for its customers is a small thing. It has a potential to create a lot of sticky customers for T. 5G, First Net, Tax breaks etc are just icing on the cake. I hope both Blue and Red do well but Red is priced where it needs to be if not over priced the moment. It should be 45 and holding for what it offers in the industry and the limited subscriber base it is aiming for down the road without content."
this is a great postBurnt3 days agoremember-- when election is over all of the liberal rags will be extinct.yahoo being one of them--- Shame on you Verizon. socialist pig companyReply105
"The FACT is any move higher in VZ is only a chance to sell even more shares before it goes lower and lower LOL,LOL,LOL"
VZ+5G=$
$VZ $TMUS $SThe 5G death towers everywhere will be the end of us all.
"What a great move. Tracfone uses the Verizon network anyway so why not? It will increase the subscriber base 3x. Pre-paid has always been a thorn , however to pick up those subs too and offer them something more? You look in the long run with Verizon not in the short run. nd this Daniel guy, why why so negative. Back to your bat cave. What part of 3x +++ subscribers don't you understand?"
VZ Should be atleast $80.00 pps
vz holding the ship steady!! Beter than most stocks!!
has bob mudge retired?
vz said 5g will not make profit till 2021 ..so neutral on vz after earnings
$WIFI NO TIME FRAME FOR 5G LAUNCH!!!!! $VZ and $WIFI said they are WORKING to build a hyper-dense indoor network of DAS and small cells and could NOT PROVIDE TIMELINE for launch. This is a press release and will not increase revenue or boost bottom line. Short play. Will go down as fast as it went up.
So the J team is gone then fir now. Also the Neil guy? Wow the vomet team #$%$?
"VZ's outlook has toppled AT&T's outlook going forward with these numbers and will be improving throughout 2018,income investers weighing their options VZ vs.AT&T now will be looking at VZ!"
Boom! Verizon’s making money. Sweet!
Time to sell VZ it has become the worst of breed with over $208 worth of debt per share and that before the $30-40 billion they are spending on bandwidth Cramer's next best of breed to out right disaster. WOW is VZ in trouble and the debt just keeps going up not down
Why did this pop so much? Had to be something. This is normally one of the slowest moving stocks out there.
Can someone tell me why this stock has lost about 40% of its value in the last 2 years? I'm a long time hold on VOD.
I find yahoo's news so liberal to the point of being ridiculous that I just had to find out who owned them. It turns out to be VZ. VZ is a company that I have long thought of as being unethical so the fact that Yahoo should be run as unethically as it is does not surprise me.I will make it a point to short this stock in the future. VZ's got to have a bad future based on what I see them doing with Yahoo (I see they already run it all but totally into the ground based on their huge write-off a couple years ago).VZ: $ 57.47 (can you hear me now) VZ: $
This baby is heading to $100.00
I didn't know Harriet tubman was a US president
Great day after an awesome agreement with the VA
"If VZ is losing money on AOL and Yahoo would they consider closing it down? Would seem strange not to have Yahoo, as they still have many users of the site. I guess they would try finding another buyer (?)"
"Money flowing into the high growth, get rich quick stocks. VZ is a slow growth, get rich slow stock."
"tax cut will be help Verizon get more customers, because people have enough money to upgrade signals, Verizon's signals are lot more better than anyone, especially GPS, T-MOBILE and Sprint maybe bankruptcy, because their signals too bad, profit margin too low,, make a little money, they don't have enough money to upgrade signals.,in some areas they don't have signals, especially countries side."
Barrons has a buy recommendation on VZ with a $66 PT.
whole system is broke here. We need a massive 2 to 3 thousand point sell off to correct this stupidity by FED.
"Interesting observation, one for Hans to take notice of, and quickly. Yahoo put out one of their ""manufactured"" polls earlier today and has been steadily reporting that Biden is leading Trump by some amazing amount (11%, or more???). They have put this up as their banner story for a good part of the day. It's been picked up by CNN and others. Guess what? It sent the Dow into a tailspin. Also notice that Verizon stock took another hit today. Hans, when are you going to WAKE UP and understand that there are enough STUPID PEOPLE out there that believe these stories at face value? While the Yahoo poll isn't the only thing that caused stocks to drop today (Pelosi also put a hard deadline on when the stimulus needed to be completed), it was a significant part of it."
"VZ at midway between ex-divs, best time to buy/ add shares before run-up to coming ex-dividend. Buy at 54, sell at 56 - make $2 a share. Wait in cash till next dip and avoid risk of sudden price drop. Dry powder will be available to seize any drop in price. Write this down!"
"Even if rates were to go back to normal, at the current PE, one of the few stocks that should be purchased. Hope we get the chance to load up at 39."

Look out below another dot com bust here. ITs all been stupid manipulation games by all world banks FED central banks because they are all broke. Using these games trying to manipulate markets up world wide. Yep get them all together for the massive scheme that will take down whole world financial system period. COMPLETE IDIOTS FOOLS ALL CENTRAL BANKS think they can play this stupid game forever at any level.Blame the federal Reserve here with starting this massive pyramid scheme and extending it for so long. Tep the new dot com like bust is coming.Look out below everyone will be scrambling to get out. Janet Yellen will be responsible for these stupid games being extended for way too many years period.All fools think they can play this game forever. Reality is all countries are bankrupt period.Massive debt far exceeds their reserves period. ONe big joke.
i exited a couple of weeks ago with a significant loss. i will not buy back so theres that. i suspect theres another downer out of this support level. i dont look at bollinger bands anymore but they gotta b tight. break up or down?

"In an interview today the Euro trash SJW CEO, stated he was very pleased with Yahoo? News flash, Yahoo is a place where news goes to die. People spend hours poking fun at its op-ed-like left-biased news. Readers were making so much fun of its content they had to disable the comments. This is a big problem for the parent company VZ, they continue to meddle where they don't belong and lack execution on where they are supposed to be.. its why this stock barely moves."

"Buy. buy.buy$$$Verizon (VZ) – Verizon beat estimates by 3 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of $1.25 per share. Revenue was essentially in line with forecasts. Verizon also increased the bottom end of its full-year earnings guidance, and added more phone subscribers than analysts had anticipated. Shares were slightly higher in premarket trading as of 7:45 a.m. ET."
"Hey Verizon, your propaganda arm, Yahoo Finance, just informed us the CBO said a 15 dollar minimum wage would increase wages for 17 million workers. It will be great when thousands of Verizon, comcast, and other companies who use low cost labor, finally start paying a living wage. Technology cannot replace these people. Also, when 17 million workers get a living wage, almost all of them will no longer be eligible for govt hand outs, and will actually start paying taxes. Low cost workers, courtesy an open border, are great for business costs, But hurt your taxes, and hurt your social security. Don't give me that about SS being defined. If SS wasn't bleeding to people being enticed to come here, the SS formulas would be giving a higher benefit to all people who worked. If everything you buy cost more with a min wage over 11 an hour, so what. Your taxes will be thousands of dollars a year less, for the rest of your life. And the SS formulas might go up also."
"Wow, back below 57."
"So someone tell me why Verizon still has its Media Division? It just doesn't make sense. Look at what AT&T is going through with their media properties? Yahoo looks like such a drag on its earnings. Didn't Verizon write down a bunch of goodwill on its Media Division a couple years ago, like to the tune of a few billion dollars?"

Does not have enough cash to pay dividend. It's borrowing money to pay part of the dividend.
"Trump just tore congress and the media a big new excremental port today. While he hardly expects a constitutional battle, this was his brilliant way of showing America just how corrupt and craven BOTH the D and R 'sides' of the truly bipartisan SWAMP really are. It will be a delight to see the wrath of the voters emptied out on these slime in November.If you have $ in VZ, you DESERVE to LOSE it all!"

VZ is a good old stock that consistently performs well.
VZ looks like it's walking down stairs and T looks like it's walking up... ridiculous. T is garbage. What the heck
Stupidity markets here. Next day or so they will free fall once again. So over extended here.Blame the Nasdaq for all of this stupidity.Its September usual massive sell offs here. I expect more coming. Just trying to get some back here markets.Whole system is broken here. Blame the FED period.
Collapsing ! ATT is better bet
vz one of the few stocks holding up
WOW like at all the debt each shareholder owes in VZ. WOW each share owes over $208 in debt WOW that is over twice as bad as T and T's debt just keeps going lower and lower . WOW
Can we Break and hold $60 today please
Sieg Heil Han's and the EU one world order. How are the Yahoo censoring NATZI's doing to today I see they are hard at work CENSOR real Americans and the stock keeps going lower and lower
As both a Verizon shareholder and customer I would urge management to make a serious effort to do something about the ridiculous number of nuisance robocalls its subscribers are getting. They know solutions such as nomorobo exist. DO SOMETHING!!! The unwanted calls are driving me nuts.

Great company! I'm buying more on any dip at this point. We should see $62 in the next few weeks!
"Just sold all of my Verizon. They own Yahoo. Yahoo is a constant source of poor information both politically and financially. They are too closely allied with CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg, AP, GQ, and other liberal media. They have no balance and are a negative force in our country. I advised all of my clients to sell too. Let's all send a strong message to Verizon by selling."
Resilient isn’t she?
Well i hope everyone cuts Verizon like i have I have saved my way of costing their liberal positions.
Let me say it again and spell it out for you eggheads. Sell Verizon. BUY AT&T. Nuff said.
"IMHO, just a thought. So ATT takes onTW becomes a media behemouth, Comcast takes out FOX. VZ says alone and completes their tech build out (IOT,FIOS,5G). With their network and internet capabilities (especially if they take over ROKU) they become incredible valuable to FB, Google or MSFT. Again Just some pie in the sky stuff, but VZ gets taken out for their network capabiliites."
Based on News on T all day VZ should go up on speculation of another Social activist hedge fundFACIng facts Activists move a stock
Why would t mobile sprint acquisition cause this to pop?
Took a position 5-9 46.55
"Verizon added 650,000 subscribers in Q4. That’s almost 2x the number expected. First to launch 5g with Samsung in a few months? This stock is headed to $75 per share."
"Almost below the lower Bollinger Band. 06 Nov Volume highest in 3 Months losing 4%. 07 Nov coming out of the gate substantively losing on above average volume. I’m waiting for total speculator’s capitulation then will re-evaluate, assess, analyze and proceed rationally."
Profit taking ?
I hope they improve the piece of #$%$ called yahoo
The fact with VZ now CENORING Americans they can not longer be trusted to handle America's data. FACT if VZ is now being governed by the EU's one world order and no longer support Americans first amendment rights they should no longer be aloud to have access to American's data at all. My and I am sure the Governments opinion sense the Government supports Americans first amendment rights and give the first responders to T because T can be trusted to help protect the American people.
Awesome Opportunity for Verizon to Re-Negotiate the Yahoo Deal (Using Trump to do it) or Walk away from it altogether. JMHO
"Could you possibly find or dig up more anti-Trump material? ...or negative coverage of every single member of the Trump family. Just count them. Try and find ANYTHING positive. Numerous pieces have already been proven blatantly false but no retraction. Regardless of your opinions about the new Prez, there has never been such one-sided, vicious coverage of anyone. This mostly/partially false #$%$ belongs in your editorial section...since it's obviously the official position of Yahoo and VZ. Just report the facts please. As a reliable news site Yahoo is a complete propaganda machine...a joke."
"CEO Hans know the telecommunications business. NOK and ERIC are both way undervalued 5G plays. Would it make sense for VZ to take an equity stake into one or both of them, per AG recommendation? God Bless and stay well."

What do you recommend? VZ or T
"Verizon, through yahoo finance, is telling people that Bidens health care plan is a potent weapon against Trump.It can't be. We all know universal medicine won't work. Its too expensive, and doesn't cover anything.The reason Verizon thinks its great, is because Verizon, Comcast, and other US companies are all hoping the govt takes over all workers healthcare, so the companies don't have to pay it. Verizon doesn't think its good for us. Its good for them. So the government will not only pay supplemental benefits to employees making 11 an hour and less, but all of their healthcare too."
Verizon playing the T-Mobile/Sprint game vs Comcast and Direct TV with their Fios service by offering up to $500 early termination fees to switch as they build out the Fios network........Proves that with VZ wireless dominant network doesn't have to give away the farm for customers!
"Seismic Sector Shift To “SHAKE-UP” 30 ETFsNovember 20, 2017Lara CriggerOn Nov. 15, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI announced a dramatic change to its Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), which underpins the indexes backing hundreds of ETFs.The changes, which GO INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR (2018) will reorganize several high-profile technology stocks and realign sector definitions such that the so-called FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stocks would likely move into a single sector.###The revisions, announced as part of their annual review of the GICS, will involve renaming the“telecommunication services sector” to the “communications services sector” and broadening its scope considerably.The renamed sector will still include telecom companies, but now it will also include internet media companies, mobile gaming app makers, online streaming services, search engines, social media platforms and more.The ETF ImpactAs much as $62 billion in ETF assets could be impacted by the change."
"Told you any move higher in VZ is now only a chance to sell even more of you shares , Why because VZ does not have a future any more because they are now losing customers to T's new unlimited plans that you save money with and you even get FREE HBO MAX so you can drop NFLX and save even more money . VZ major problem they have on assets they can leverage and give you in the new world VZ now faces. So VZ just has massive debt and losing customers , Just the way it is and I don't even need to make this stuff up when it all so true LOL,LOL so you beeter learn to say OH NO down VZ goes because it's going to."
Verizon can by AT & T cheap after few days and can turn around that company?
"TODAY; It costs a fortune to deploy fiber from the street to a home; 5G eliminates much of the installation cost. ONGOING: 5G is not a ""cell phone technology"" its an ""edge"" technology and an industrial technology. T got distracted with content (losing game) while the other players in the space are nowhere near where VZ will be strategically."
"Verizon: You need to fix Yhoo. I can't imagine your company would allow the biased, left liberal garbage they are broadcasting."
ATT- a boy VZ!

"Dear Valued Shareholder, When you bought stock in Verizon, you became a co-owner of one of the world’s leading technology companies. Whether you own hundreds of shares or just a handful, we want you to know that we immensely appreciate your investment in our future – and in the future of high-speed networks, cutting edge technology and innovative services built for tomorrow. I want to tell you personally that this future is bright indeed, both for our company and for the innovations that are synonymous with the Verizon brand. For several years now, our signature offering has been the 4G LTE wireless network, which now reaches about 98 percent of the U.S. population. We take great pride in the speed, quality, and reliability of this network, and in the many awards and recognitions that our 4G LTE service has earned from respected third-party evaluators like J.D. Power and RootMetrics. But at Verizon, we recognize that in today’s fast-changing tech marketplace, past accolades are no substitute for continuous innovation. That’s why we’ve seized the undisputed lead in 5G networks. This isn’t just a next-generation sequel to 4G LTE – it’s a whole new category of speed and connectivity. Our 5G systems will allow 10 to 100 times better throughput, 10 times longer battery life, and 1,000 times larger data volumes than current networks. Verizon is already offering 5G in four major metro areas – Sacramento, Los Angeles, Houston, and Indianapolis – and we are rapidly expanding our coverage. Why are we moving forward so aggressively? It’s simple: We see 5G as the key that will unlock an enormous range of exciting business and consumer services, from virtual reality to immersive gaming to the Internet of Things. Some are calling this new era of highly connective technologies a Fourth Industrial Revolution. Whatever you want to call it, we fully intend to be in the vanguard – and we want you right there with us. I’ll close by giving you an update on some changes at our company. Actually, I’m one of them. In August I became Verizon’s chief executive officer upon the retirement of Lowell McAdam. We’re deeply grateful to Lowell for all he has done to further strengthen Verizon’s leadership in the tech sector, and I am honored to build upon his accomplishments. To help us do that, and to ensure our continued leadership in the 5G era, I’ve just announced a new operating structure based on three customer-facing areas – Consumer, Business, and Verizon Media Group. This change will take effect January 1, 2019, and we expect to shift to financial reporting under the new structure in the second quarter of the new year. I look forward to keeping you posted on this and other changes in the months to come. In the meantime, thank you again for your investment in Verizon. We are honored to have you on our team. Hans Vestberg"
Seems the same old media lies now being pushed through Verizon by Yahoo. 1/2 this nation is sick of what the other have is doing to our President. Our duly legal elected President that has a right to govern without fake news. Due to the constant barrage I have now decided to remove all Verizon accounts from my business and home. I hope other will do likewise. All one has to do is read the news article and see the ongoing effort to unseat our President with Fake News... I hope other will follow..
WHAT IS WRONG with VZ ?? trades at 7 PE
"On a potential merger with Charter to Comcrap,I do not see it being a cash purchase, but a 100% stock swap, else too much debt.I am not saying I trust Lowell, but we will have to wait and see"
Verizon acquires up to 22% of HMNY who owns 82% of Moviepass. A brilliant move.Maybe as shareholders we also should buy shares of HMNY and/ or subscribe to MoviePass.
"Buy $vz or $mo, Companies that are actually decent. AT&T is already regretting the Time Warner buy."
VZ has made themselves into an un American company by their own actions and actions speak the truth by volumes You don't even need to try and make stuff up when it's all so true as VZ CENSORS their own customers and shareholders and now driving them away in droves
VZ % of float shorted is less 1%. One of the lowest shorted stocks on the Dow. Lol against the ones to say to short it.https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/vz
Buffet buy VZ only one reason! ?
"CEO OF VZ is one of the best, 5 G moving into a few big cities, Paying down debt, maybe making a dividend increase consideration,4.55% yield, plus tons of money around for this type stock,,no wonder CNBC Josh Brown calls for $breakout into the 60's"
"NO ONE in America should be doing any business with companies like VZ that has taken away your rights to see , read and post the truth. Han's with his EU one world order censoring Yahoo NATZI's are censoring what you can see, read and post a truly one sided view of the world that only the EU wants you to see. VZ down and RED like the communist company VZ has now become."
Down almost $5 bucks a share since 10/20. I don't get it. The recent earnings and subscriber growth were good. This TMobile- Sprint breakup is worth $5 down?
"When is 5G not?Implicit in the names given for each big step forward in wireless communications networks, each numbered Generation provides a new, broader, bolder promise for the content, applications and universality consumers can expect.The technology that each G makes use does not necessarily have to be entirely new. It does have to pack a punch that busts down former barriers for the market to spend more or shift to the new devices.Does Verizon's announcement to be the first with 5G measure up? Let's look at the basics:1) Verizon' ""5G Home"" claims to be the first US operator to provide 5G.b) Chief Network Engineer Nicki Palmer, says that ""we are doing it right"". He extols that VZ has installed fiber optic and is installing smallcells. Verizon has a reputation for building good networks. However, fiber-optic, smallcells and use of mmWave spectrum is not new.b) Palmer says VZ is doing 5G the right way. But this 'roll out' is in only 5 locations, far from the national footprint that Verizon's advertising is targeted. What is the benefit to the 95% of the US population that is being saturated with the ads but won't be able to get the service? Obviously, it is to feel good that the largest operator remains a leader and competitors won't get to 5G before them.2) What can you do with VZ's 5G that you can't do with existing cable and wireless services? Does it step up to earn the title of being the next generation of wireless?a) The 5G Home service uses mmWave spectra to deliver claimed speed of 300 Mbps and 1 Gbps peak rates. There are no network surveys to test that claim. Let's take it as valid. Although companies have been offering 'gigabit wireless' for years, this is a first for a home/consumer level service. AT&T, Sprint, and many Wireless Internet Service Providers, WISPs, have offered WBA, Wireless Broadband Access, starting over a 15 years ago, however, they were limited to well under 100 Mbps and the economics have not worked. So, from a perspective of offering something new, VZ's launch partially qualifies.b) 5G Home, however, is not an extension of the mobile network. It is being deployed using 5G technology and smallcell methods, but it is aimed at delivering a subset of the 'broadband everywhere' mobile network-based service. Therefore, calling VZ's mmWave service 5G is false. It is a part of 5G in a similar way that the fixed version of WiMAX could claim to have ushered in 4G: it used the same OFDM-based technologies that have evolved of the past decade but only became available to a few and never become a mainstream mobile service until it was overtaken by LTE.In the same way that WiMAX was 'too little, too early' to make financial sense. Verizon's 5G Home is too limited in coverage and narrow in its capabilities that it is doomed to be overtaken by the real 5G broadband when it is offered as an extension to mobile networks. 5G broadens the field of applications for wireless to include billions of IoT connections and also the replacement for cable home broadband. The only way 5G can provide the range of service to the broad population is by first using lower frequency bands. The more natural way to evolve 5G into the market is to provide 'cable equivalency' broadband speed of 100+ Mbps sustained rate over the 1/2 to 2/3rds of the population that represents a 'nationwide coverage network'. Verizon's 5G Home is really just a market testbed, not a rollout. It is not 5G because it fails to be an extension of mobile networks. While Verizon claims they will grow the network and use it to provide seamless integration with mobile, that remains something that is a paper pipe-dream, no more real than WiMAX's claim to have been 4G. In fact, the mobile version of WiMAX reached about 14 million consumers at its peak... so it earned the claim of having become a mobile service. But even that failed to qualify as a ""mainstream service offering""."
I'm going to check records on VZ what does anyone know if they have any convertible bonds outstanding?
To see a div increase too would show some strength.
Someone knew yesterday . Must be nice to know ahead of time for every stock that reports
"Is TMobile starting to crush Verizon? Once Tmob takes over Sprint, lookout. ATT will be the first to drop then Verizon will be hit hard."
"Verizon's Yahoo virus infested pages now spew over 8 GB per hour of useless garbage files into your browser. More crud than any site I have seen, even google or facebook. Disgusting.. My 2.2 GH x 2GB ram laptop can only function on yahoo for about 10 minutes tops before freezing up. Then I have to shut it down and run my powerful cleaning and disinfecting programs. No other site on the web is as filthy as yahoo. Nice job Verizon!"
Warren Buffet has a new stake in VZ and there is something huge brewing they are giving a new target of 75.00
shorting this monday
"More bad news over at AT&T. Their top man in charge of their 5G rollout just resigned. I am sure his first question to his CEO. Why did we have to force the Union out on strike? How can we build a 5G Network with old burnt out management workers, and untrained replacement workers? I would never in vest in T, (until their CEO Stephson resigns), or is fired."
bargain
$65 coming on this week 
look out below now that we have hit the highs.Yep I see one massive sell off coming. So over due just same old games by fed.Trump is a fool trying to get the FEd to take rates to 0. They have already screwed savers enough over last 11 years.
"Yahoo Finance, owned by Verizon, now showing a handful of people that will not benefit directly from the tax cuts. But even if you pay more, you'll still benefit from millions taken off the welfare rolls. Verizon shareholders should be shamed of the company they invested in, for trying to keep millions of their friends , relatives, and neighbors, and fellow citizens from getting jobs. I am also ashamed. Ashamed of the stockholders that put up with Verizon managements garbage."
Due for another massive sell off here. THis upside was so over blown. Nasdaq needs thousands of points sell off easy here. At least 5 thousand to start.
I would think FIOS 1gig service would be selling like hot cakes. Households can acces everything plus from home not have to go to movies etc.
Let the stocks and cryptocurrencies bounce back.
Would you buy ATT at 29.58 ?7% dividend is nice if the price will hold up.
"VZ the next self created disaster, WHY because of the EU's one world ordered installed by Han's . As VZ now CENSOR's Americans and CENSOR's what you can see , read and post. VZ has proven they CAN NOT be TRUSTED to protect your First Amendment rights, VZ for a FACT will break your First Amendment rights and they have by their own actions. The last thing you want is to give VZ any business or data because VZ has proven VZ CAN NOT be TRUSTED anymore to protect anything. FACT by their own actions. NEVER EVER do BUSINESS with any Company that does not protect your First Amendment rights. If you are going to Change your CELL service , T Mobile is a Foreign company set up by the EU to collect data on the USA and use that data to farther the EU's one world order agenda . I guess that only leaves T as the last big Cell provider you can still trust to protect your data. That is why the Government moved the First Responders to T's network , because the Government could TRUST T to help protect the American people ."
Up to $59 AND down to $56 IS THE pattern that's been going on for some time. who ever thinks $100 needs their head examined
Why would anyone use Verizon when T-Mobile and Sprint are basically half the cost? I dumped this horrid company a while back and went from paying $225 for 3 lines monthly to $138 and actually get more.
The only reason I go to YehHoo is to rebut the liberal news garbage.

Down a $1 is not exactly “getting crushed) :)

"For the majority of VZ investors - As long as DIVIDEND is safe who cares what range VZ trades in?Have a few extra bucks - buy on a dip. Otherwise hold for the next 2,5,10, 20 or 50 years."
I'm thinking VZ is in the best situation to announce share buybacks.

"Sprint and T-Mobile merger or no merger won't affect Verizon, because their customers are different, Verizon customers are high ranking customers, T-MOBILE mid ranking, Sprint low ranking, their monthly fee are different, SO ifT-Mobile and Sprint merger, T-MOBILE and Sprint sure be hurt each other, because their monthly fee are different, if Sprint and T-Mobile don't merger, this two companies maybe bankruptcy, because their profit margin too low, they don't have enough money to build 5G networks, they can't cut monthly fee again, anyway it won't affect Verizon. because Verizon make money a lot more than them, Verizon's monthly fee of now sure be kill them,"
People will never go back to 4g.Verizon giving 5g free for 3 months.
If verizon buys yahoo and doesn't change back to the old finance I WILL DROP VERIZON FOR ANOTHER PROVIDER.
"Wonder will Verizon's Yahoo writers mention anything about Dem Rats ( Pelosi and Schumer ) trying to holdvirus stimulus hostage by adding $1 trillion to fund their bankrupt cesspool city and state pension funds.

"How about Yahoo finance, part of Verizon, following marching orders, and going after Jack Ma. They've already targeted a number of billionaires, apparently marching to the orders of AOC. Jack Ma says his staff should have sex 6 times in 7 days.So why tell us, except to embarrass the guy. Personally, it sounds like a good idea.So Jack, try to sign with a different communications company other than Verizon, and get the companies you work with here in the US to do the same. Verizon is a hack company, as its landlines dwindle in number. Why reward a company that promotes the idea of you being a psychopath."
Union Buyout Offer in the works ?

It would appear that yahoo has decided to engage in all out war on the president. That shouldn't be a corporations role on a general news? site.

"I get a kick out of reading all the rhetoric on this board. My only beef with Verizon is their ownership of the Media division. It's a hot mess, which I've written about ad nauseum already on this board. Other than that, they have better cash flow than T-Mobile (roughly 2:1 better) and AT&T, will be roughly at par with T-Mobile in about 2 years with 5G (AT&T will be less), and has more programs in place or planned to take advantage of their 5G.Hans is not the best communicator, but I do see some very profitable areas for Verizon up and beyond the postpaid world (which is what everyone seems to be focused on). They will offer 5G home internet both FIOS and wireless, with the latter generating the most growth. I see them displacing cable in several markets, especially those dominated by Spectrum and Comcast (Xfinity). Everyone is trashing their mmWave but I see where it will work in high density zones as a disrupter for cable. IoT is another growth area. I see what Rockwell, Siemens and others are working on with their automation solutions, and all of them are hanging their hat on secure 5G. Then there are the infrastructure $$$ that will be spent with the latest $1.9 trillion legislation with some of those $$$ chasing 5G.For those hawking T-Mobile, keep in mind that their operating margin is less than half of Verizon's. Even AT&T is almost half of Verizon's operating margin. That's why Verizon can afford its dividend. I do note Verizon will be suspending their buyback due to the $53 billion invested in C band (no surprise there; I already wrote about it).The best strategy with this stock? Buy the shares, sell covered calls and collect roughly 10-15% per year with some upside potential starting in about 2 years."

"Snoops , puff get on board the Green Kalifornia Dreaming High Speed 5G train before we base in the $60's some time later this year. You've got time boyz, she's doing the bond equivy jog. Should get a second wind when period expenses sans all the bought out staff ratchet down. What has always separated VZ from the pack is profitability. Going back to 2010 VZ was way ahead of #$%$ the old story, quality matters. Hurry boyz before the 5G revenue starts to layer on. All cities towns and villages are going to want 5G camera tech so they can catch the Nigerian Bros too. Hear me now and believe me later -- 5G layering on a great network that should be by far the most efficient , meaning low operating cost per sub which should make it tuff to compete with VZ on price."
"SMART PHONE ADDICTION; CHIP Tracks Citizens (Surveillance GPS,) Bank, Trade Stocks, Watch News, Payments, Book Tickets, TEXT, Social Media, List Is Ongoing, (SO, Common Sense BUY VZ) Pays YOU Own It Dividend Above Banks Low Rates, DEMAND Is GENUINE"
"Whats left of Yahoo slapped with 35 million dollar fine ? Well why in the world isn't Verizon paying for it. Verizon bought the part of the company that allowed the breach. I can't wait for socialism, and the end of companies like Verizon."
"Is it not surprising that Verizon's stock is declining? The stock was doing better when the strike was in force. Now that the unions had taken hold of many industries advertising to many how much havoc and disarray can be engendered by a bellicose and recalcitrant union system; hence, undermining the economy even further. Verizon was under pressure to pay these bloated salaries to members not deserved of this. Even the lowest rung-of-the-ladder clerks will make 60,000 thousand dollars per year not including the abundance of overtime coming their way."
back to insanity buyers on nothing. Same old games back and forth to trade. Whole system needs to implode it is broke.Blame the Fed for all this #$%$. Also daily tweets from Trump to try to pump and dump markets daily.
Get ready for dividend soon! Nice time to buy!
all my posts are gone.....and that knt..........gets 187 million....................
Seems to be a nice bid in for VZ. Dollars are being traded for Euro as VZ is looking good to foreign investment -- 4% is super + dollar strength. Articles like attached below which show VZ blasting past the world pack with 5G speed can't hurt VZ's profile:https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/us-5g-networks-marked-by-paltry-coverage-unimpressive-speeds-independent-tests-show-/d/d-id/754857?
"My contract is OVER with VZ, going to T."
common why so slow
Why can’t VZ go over $60.DOW up 300 and only up pennies
"Lets place bets how soon VZ will have to file for bankruptcy. You all know now it's coming just like KODAK , VZ did not have the vision or the guts to make the changes it needed to compete in the new world that has been created by the smartest people in the room over at T. VZ would not even be around if it was not for T. VZ is just one of the baby bells and has never had the vision to create new worlds. FACT."
"The yahoo finance team tells us on the right, what their 2019 financial resolutions are. Well number 1 will be to keep fighting against jobs for americans, and to help keep large numbers of people entering the country, so that many fellow Verizon employees will never see a decent raise again. These are bad people. I feel sorry for those people who have their office near them, as they laugh and giggle while they are hurting not only fellow Verizon employees, but ppl all across the country."
"I am so glad the DOJ is led by Barr. It will have a big impact, for example they are investigating ballot harvesting by Omar in 2016 so that might cut down on Minneapolis vote totals. Hillary won with about a 40k margin out of about 2.8 mil votes cast - very thin. You know the Trump people will be out and based on the destruction of a big part of Minneapolis Trump has no doubt picked up support in Minneapolis. I see Michigan and Wisconsin getting more red. Assuming the Man of Orange emerges from C-19 the picture of health. Got gold?"
GOAT Investor = Goofiest of All Time Investor
All over the calls at 57...stock belongs at 59-60
"VZ, here is what happens when you put a political agenda ahead of the product you're selling; in this case, the NFL putting BLM ahead of football: https://deadline.com/2020/09/rams-nfl-sunday-night-football-ratings-down-cowboys-nbc-60-minutes-1234576202 Oh, and I saw the revised #'s - still horrible. That was the case for the majority of the games aired this past weekend. And if ""eyeball"" data is any indication, most people watched to see how the players would protest and then tuned out. And Nielsen spend a LOT of time at NFL HQ on Friday (wonder why???). So just like Goodell needs to ""grow"" a set, Hans Vestberg needs to do the same, show some leadership, and shed VZ of its Media Division pig. PS - noticed how the stock price went UP today with the acquisition of Tracfone? Amazing what happens when you focus on your core market..."

This stock is selling at 1999 prices. Top management does not seem to care. Seem to be trading stock for day traders
VZ owns the POS YAHOO helping to tank this thing.
This is going to be red by the end of the day. (right now 2:38 pm central)
This is great news for Verizon. The California courts ruled that when they bought YahHoo they also bought the legal liability associated with the yahoo data breach. What a deal!
"Don't worry if you own VZ you are about to lose even more money. Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes as they lose 1000's of customers everyday to T. LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Great. VZ wants to be another T?? So, they are basically admitting their content strategy was wrong.."
Verizon should Trade in the high $50s.
Always remember to only Sell any move higher in both TMUS and VZ as they are now both losing customers to T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO Max.

"Upgrades for stocks are scary, especially if they come from Goldman Sachs. Typically they're made to help get their penta clients out of large positions. There was a study out of Harvard Business School some time back that looked into this. They found a correlation between the ""heavy hitter"" firms like Goldman and stock upgrades being used to dump stock. The reverse is true as well. I have actually followed GS upgrades and downgrades, and note there is a strong negative correlation between their upgrade or downgrade and the price action of the stock. Especially for high alpha stocks. So if Goldman is saying ""sell"" you should be buying."
"Verizon up sharply today, with the knowledge that the Fed is bent on killing the economy, so companies like Verizon wont have to give out many wage increases to their employees. Over a recent 10 year period, middle class workers got 2% wage increase, while management got 46%. I can only hope that heartless shareholders smiling at the price upswing, will also not be getting any salary increases any time soon."
"#VZ Volume is good. MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI are turning up, according to stoxline. A break of 49.31 could move it up to 57.59."
Hello winners self made millionaire in a month with 20 grand on CLWD all because I was sick of making a 4% divided and it was the smartest move ever. You all need to bail from this sinking ship just like the Boaes of directors selling off shares at all time highs and stuff like that. Hell yeah I’d sell off especially cause it’s your money their robbing. But guys I tossed you all a life preserver with my previous picks and CLWD MAKES 100% Daily
is it too soon to add position for long?
"Get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes, Why easy VZ did not change the business to compete in the new 5 G world they now face. The real fact is no one company can compete with the 5G monster that T has built. T's 5G monsters future is shining so bright you will need to wear shades."
Same old games back and forth. i see it start again keep going down period. Virus not ending anytime soon. Will crash these markets again.
So has VZ ended the nonworking tablet scam it was running?
whole stock market manipulated daily for price swings wake up america.
"VZ is Cramer's next best of breed to out right disaster. LOL,LOL,LOL every share of VZ comes with over $208 of Debt LOL and VZ debt will be going even alot higher with all the billions they just spent LOL,LOL,LOL"
Only green 5G communications company today out of the big 4. My guess is shorts lost a lot of money today which is why they’re out in full force on here.
Not sure I understand why afternoon dump. Anybody have ideas?
VZ has been hammered by Trump's tweets ... WHY?
"Earnings is pretty bad compared to previous years, and huge amount of Debts are expected to increase plus Post-paid subscribers are disappointing. Should fall significantly from here."
Why ??? We're losing long time Verizon cell phone customers each quarter due to poor reception and shady sales tactics at their stores. This has to be a fake pump before the quarterly report which will show the decline customer base. Then the profit taking begins !
India no virus? Is it because they eat curry?
"will VZ defend itself against this relentless, month long attack?"
"With all the mergers between content and telecom/cable,do you think anyone could or would make a tender offer for VZ? A lot long at $55."
whole system the FEd with rate cuts. Yep lets screw savers once again to 0 return on savings rate. See how corrupt this system is. This does nothing for average citizen but screw them out of any rate. of return. Just like last 11 years to bring markets/ Housing back. Screwed the middle class working people. Al this to make richer rich. Its time congress abolish the FEd period. Not needed period.Whole system is so corrupt with these games.
Hope Verizon can straighten out Yahoo Finance - return it to the great site it once was.
This thing has $45 or lower written all over it. VOD is junky too.
Will need to look at all the numbers but so far looks good. Slow but steady growth is good in this market. Might be short term sellers but LONG TERM expect new highs...
"T & VZ are both down today (possibly along with other Telecoms, I haven't looked). Is this a reaction to the Hurricane damage?"
Get ready to see a bounce in the premarket. Here come the dividend hunters...
VZ Selling off some from PM Highs...
New to this stock in at $59. Nothing but down I see 
"I don't know what's wrong with this stock. Countless buy recommendations and yet it is down over 8% ytd. Meanwhile T-Mobile is up 34%, figure that out."
"Comcast as a company is now valued higher than Verizon. The stock price blew by Verizon, split and is catching up again. Growth AND dividend. Why stay here?"
Told you break our cup and handle

"Very notably, Biden & Harris both out blink Trump & Pence in debates.Biden's voice timbre less influential than Trump's.Biden ""slow on the go"", indecisive response pauses with time factor.Harris overly smiling, smug brat demeanor.Vitality, reality, and lesser wrong of both candidates, Trump wins 2020. (Democrats should have ran Andrew Yang instead of blinking #$%$ up a flagpole)"
I will add at $47-48. That seems to be good support going back 2 years
"FIOS internet connections. Just an observation, not based on any research or deep dives. In the last week I have had at least 5 people ask me about my FIOS internet connection (the 1 gig service). Apparently, they have their local cable companies, and with the recent storm and the amount of people using the internet, they are not happy. If this is a trend (and not by chance), hopefully VZ can capitalize on this.I would love to see how they are doing on their fIxed wireless internet service they just rolled out in Georgia. If is successful this is the solution for rural internet connections."
I think Yahoo and Verizon are both awesome.
"Rumors around WPP (ad company) looking for Tim Armstrong to be their CEO. Instead, can VZ decide. To purchase WPP itself to funnel its OATH ad network? WPP is just $ 22B"
"Love the Full Blown Wall Street pump VZ and dump it on the suckers, Watch and learn , Why because VZ is WAY , WAY over priced and more than likely will be filing for Bankruptcy in the next 3-5 years. Only way Wall Street can get out . Stay clear"
so is this a good news or what????
Option expiration
"Its Friday,, everyone has puts so it must all come down on this friday"
Is $VZ the beat 5G play? Or is it doomed because of the liberal virus?
JPM says Japan’s stock market is foreshadowing a sector rotation in the US from Tech into Utilities and Telecoms. Read the article......Verizon is headed higher.
I'm out at $55.30 with profit $1.45/share in 1 day. Pull back is imminent & RSI value is getting high.
"Did you see the latest $h|+ posted by Huffington Post? Verizon, really? No wonder you're trying to unload that pig. Title of the lead article on Yahoo (for HuffPost): Mary Trump's Grim Analysis Of The Campaign: He's Going To Go To Jail"". Meanwhile, in ""reality"" land, I go to Real Clear Politics and just happen to notice ALL of the battleground states are now very tight races, with Republicans outregistering Democrats by a sizeable margin in most states. Also, don't forget Quinnipiac's interesting poll they did a few months ago. They asked voters a simple yes/no question - don't tell us, but if we asked, would you tell us who you are voting for president? Then they went and checked how each respondent was registered - democrat or republican. Turns out many more democrats would tell who they would vote for than republicans by about a 10-12% marging. THAT is why the polls can't be trusted this year, and why you're noticing ALL the races have suddenly tightened up. People are voting, and the numbers are VERY interesting. Then there's the army of ""angry white men"" who have kept their mouths shut during BLM and all the other garbage thrown at them. They are the LARGEST voting cohort that shows up in BIG NUMBERS. Watch what happens by November 3rd. People will be more than mildly surprised.But either way, that's OK. I spoke with BlackRock last week. I now understand their view on Verizon. They obviously can't say much, but it wasn't hard to read between the lines. I suspect other large shareholders are feeling the same way. My take - there will be a move by large shareholders to capture more seats on Verizon's board. They want media OUT."
Join the crowd happens to me too.
"IS 5 G really 5 G at VZ? Seems to imply NATIONWIDE in their ads and what you hear from user anecdotes, this is hardly the truth? Anyone have anything to add to this topic? Also, how about the freeeeking robo calls today, election day. VZ is the enabler of Robo calls that invade our homes and cell phones every day......Can't invest in this. Plenty of dividends out their that have a chance to grow share price....."
T now caught up in the downgrades as VZ was days ago. Then the article that Comcast is the one to invest in. Analyst see the same reports we do and then take an educated guess. Problem is their opinions move the stock which is aggravating as hel......and tends to be bullsh..........
"Wow $NOK worldwide sales rocketing 45 contracts so far including China Mobile , 5G is here for the next 10 years $VZ with $INZG $TMUS and $S with $NOK ,"
"LOL,LOL,LOL SAY OH NO down VZ goes , LOL,LOL you can thank Cramer for not telling you to sell , because He knew Wall Street was dumping VZ and won't tell you to sell until VZ is down 50% LOL,LOL"
Vz selling off too? Market is a mess
common go to moon
This is hilariously oversold
"good products, paying down debt,maybe a divy increase. Looking at the valuations of some other companies VZ is a great bargain,"
"Going from Cramer's best of breed to out right disaster LOL,LOL,LOL as Cramer now pumps over priced T mobile LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Fed Ex is giving employees wage increase (not one time bonuses like Verizon), and they are also bolstering their pension plans. Does Verizon even have pension plans for their customer sales associates. I can't wait till they control the border, and Verizon one day will start to treat their employees with dignity and respect. Happy employees do better work, and that would help put money in shareholder pockets. unfortunately many shareholders are ignorant louses who don't care about anything but their brokerage account value."
"If you have $ into VZ, you DESERVE to LOSE every cent!"
Sell sell sell!!! No growth.

"Obamy economy turn full time jobs into part time jobs, huge welfare 8 million more on it and food stamps,illegal gangs and drug dealers have their families supported by tax payers while the sell drugs and sendmoney back to their own countries......"
This is one of the safer stocks to put your money into as the year ends. It doesn’t go up or down to much and holds steady when the rest of the market is a roller coaster. And it pays a very nice dividend.
Does this mean a bad quarter heading into next week?
"So now Yahoo Finance, a propaganda unit of Verizon, found a survey (probably paid people to take it), that says a Lebron James backed Pizza is Americas best. So why would they say that ? James is worth 480 million. he doesn't need the money. he's the poster boy for social/wealth injustice. Why should he have half a billion, and most of us have less than half a million. is that fair ? Is that just ? Unless he's paying his employees 15 dollars a hour, yahoo finance isn't helping the poor in the country, they are helping enrich the rich."
Do the adds include Comcast’s adds?
"Yahoo Finance says Obamacare was revolutionary for womens health. Well yeah, when we pay 18,000 a year in premiums, things will happen. And of course when we have trillions in debt, and the left wants to add 32 trillion more in 1 payer healthcare, and a total green usa in 20 years, hey, we'll be green, and bankrupt, and subserviant to our debtors. By the way, apparently Verizon thinks that the lowering of the average lifespan of a person in the US isn't worth mentioning, as had happened during the obamacare years."
Another Boeing? VZ has outsourced all of its IT to and India and the Infosys sweatshop. Telecom is a core strategic asset to the United States. How long before we see a major disaster resulting from errors of sweatshop coders under slave time pressure.
What is wrong with this stock Not holding at 61$
"On my gut instinct that Apple might be partnering with a top telecom company like Verizon or AT&T for its new line of 5G iPhones, I've just bought CALL options on both stocks. Verizon has a very fast network, and if Apple were to announce a partnership with Verizon for its 5G devices, VZ could quickly soar to $70."
VZ is RED like China
Look to buy at $32.
"I’m buying VZ today, I’m not earning any interest in my deposit account so I might as well get something for my money."
"Yahoo, quit with the lousy pop up ads. You shut them down and the screen refreshes 10 times. I don't care about your lousy ads. just want the finance home page. Who's running this company?? the brain dead????"
WHERE IS MY PAL coco?????
"Nobody uses Yahoo and AOL, they use Facebook, Google and Amazon,This was a stupid purchase, since this deal, the dividend and profit have both dropped. The biggest Bull Market in history and VZ is down 15%. Good Luck."
"VZ and yahoo are big time leftists. Stupid, too."
That free cash flow increase is insane!
It appears Verizon was so caught up in the moment with their purchase of Yahoo that they ignored their core business. I think it is called complacency.
Next week will be even higher with Ex date in view.
"This thing is like a yo yo. Generally, when the market goes up, vz goes down. Market goes down vz goes up. I have made a ton buying on dips and selling on ups."
It's time that Hans Vestberg and his sidekick that he brought over from Ericson head back home with their old stoggie ideas of partnering up with companies with no benefit to VZ. that hasn't worked since GTE and NYNEX
How much cash does vz hold outside U.S.?
Hard to believe this stock was higher 18 years ago than it is now Two decades of wasted investment.
Anyone else see 4.5M shares purchased right before close
"Stir/Not Shaken due to be rolled out this year, if not already. Its supposed to help carriers see if a robo-caller is disguising their identity. IMO Verizon, and everyone else knows how to stop robo calls, but doesn't want to lose that revenue stream. Perhaps humongous fines, like 10 cents for every robo call enabled by Verizon, would also help put a stop to it. Currently, Verizon is getting revenues from robo callers, and probably making money. That revenue should also be forfeited. Theres a lot that can be done, but as usual, we all have to suffer so Verizon can keep their profit margins. How about listing the major carriers, by number of robo calls, and embarrassing these people. Or how about if a carrier has too high a percent of robo calls, they have to pay more for their FCC license, or maybe even lose it. That would stop robo calls tomorrow."
Buy at&t
"For all you whippersnappers:Patience is a virtue. If you are looking for fast growth try Amazon.I bought VZ in 2009, reinvested the divs, and added a few times during dips.Cap Gain presently about 70% since then and started taking the divs in 2017.Yield to cost = 7.5%VZ is not a volatile stock, so I slept sound at night."

"Sprint NO INCOME! ! from ppl they take from VZ.Not to smart on S part short yes, Long term DUMB!!!"

"to me, this article shows a why that AT&T could or should buy Synacor, it shows Verizon is really a rival to AT&T in entertainment content distribution as well as the older industries. the article describes services Verizon will provide which are very similar to both what AT&T does, and as well how ut reaches out to clients like Synacor has in it's own portfolio of clients, the cable companies, distributors of entertainment content...Verizon Digital Media Services debuts 4k, multi-CDN and QOS capabilities at NAB Show 2019 https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17460546?source=ansh $VZ"

VZ to $65 in late 2018
looks like the DIV chasers are out today
Yahoo is the anvil chained to the foot of VZ that will drag the entire company to the bottom and bury it in the virus encrusted sewage muck forever. Their putrid influence has already infected the entire management of VZ. VZ is rotted clear through. Zero chance of any recovery. The cancer has grown too deep. Enjoy the ride as you circle the bowl.

What happened to all the hype of 5G rollout. Stuck with the stock that only goes down. Should have known better when I wasted an hour at a nearby store a year ago to check on switching - nobody helped and left handed. What does these highly paid execs actually do?
"Yahoo Finance, owned by Verizon, continues to undermine the President. They talk of Bolton becoming a threat to the President, while the truth is, he is one of the best supporters. Shame on Verizon for marching to the agenda, instead of trying to make money for its shareholders. I guess maybe verizon is rewarding certain shareholders by marching. perhaps they reward the shareholders who also want a weak country, including countries who steal from us daily, and other countries who chant ""death to America."" The question remains, why would a US citizen stay invested, and help bad people and bad countries divide us ? Your small gains in the stock will pale when the country goes socialist and the government confiscates every major business, and not only will your small gain be wiped out, but your entire investment."
Did you ever meet some really hard up desperate people that ask You for a spare quarter?That is the same exact way Verizon treats all their valuable customers.They cut off Bloombergs TV to save a penny.
"Dear Verizon , Why is Buffett splattered all over your yahoo business site? Yahoo business writers are so creative --- copy buffett-copy buffett-copybuffett-copybuffett."
Could have a cup and handle pattern developing. Need the handle to drop. Might be a compelling buying opportunity.
"Don't immediately jump to ""this is a safety stock"" until you look at their debt. It may be manageable......but it's high. Chasing yield has not worked in this market. All losing buys become......""I am an investor for the long term not a trader"". Even if that is true. My recommendation is buy at $50."
"Don't worry Han's will have to cut the dividend in VZ this year and VZ will tank , because VZ is losing customers to T's monster new cell plans with FREE HBO MAX"
DOWN and RED like the Communist Company VZ has become under Han's and the one world order EU run Yahoo Natzi's That CENSOR their own Shareholders and customers on what they can see read and post.
"Dead Money, $40s is coming next. Very Bearish outlook ahead."
where is my friend Coco----- its about that time he shows up
Dividend increase. I hope this is a catapult for the stock price.
Verizon's trading over the last few days is like owning the one house on the block that the tornado picked out
Better buy now or lose out like loseR
$VZ has been showing support at 57.65 and resistance at 59.72. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI.
BUY now
Buy at $54s and sell at $58s. Rinse and repeat.
sell vz and buy AT&T.
"Feeling bad for all of the retirees investing in Pacific Gas & Electric, symbol PCG. It is down 20% today. I have never invested in these type of utilities. Please consider Vz. It is worth a few bucks of your hard earned retirement fund. Growth in the 5G business, and a great stable dividend too"
"The sale is over, a tax issue loss will cause a loss, hang on til 1/6 x d day—- then sell and watch the circus til the next pre d day and perhaps buy back in."
"VZ will bounce up into the 70 range before the US economy goes into recession. Gotta be in it, to win it."
I think someone breached Yahoo. They make one post and it's showing up on multiple message boards.. Russians?
"Verizon always pays too much. Look at the AOL acquisition, in December they admitted it was a mistake. Did the experts at Verizon forget when Time Warner chiseled AOL, off the building?"
Strong momentum it’s going to keep going up for awhile
"Whats wrong with this stock, especially as rates keep dropping? Markets near all-time highs and this stock is flat at best after correcting. Even lowly T is outperforming it."
"VZ didn’t buy yahoo for their news/ opinions. They bought it for their Ad revenues. Like Christ provided the crowd with loaves and fishes, VZ is filling seats. They don’t care about your opinion of yahoo’s opinion. Nor does FB. And btw, no one else cares about your opinions either. U r just angry  they took away your trolling platform.Try to develop a human relationship with someone who is not in a cult."
"fairly valued, it can give returns of about 8% . Not a buy for me"
"VZ will declare the 11/01 dividend in the first week of September and the new payment will be $0.60 per Q, imo."
Tim Armstrong is getting $60 million dollars as a going away present. Where do we shareholders sign up to suit Verizon???
This bear is running hard. Unreal.
Thank goodness the dividends stay the same.
"Get in VZ for the 5G rollout over the next 5 years. Hold VZ for 5 years, you'll be happy you did."
"Ted Williams was baseball's greatest hitter, Verizon is greatest long term growth company."
VZ and AAPL must OWN ... dont trade it.
due for massive sell off. Markets so over priced period.
b
Most corrupt company in the USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All agree!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just look at VZ Charts and those steps are going to be pulled from underneath your feet. Do yourself a favor and sell
Another great strategic partnership. This time sought out by $VZ. Excellent partner. Onward.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d925029d-fb4e-33a6-83aa-d4e03c737bbb/snap-teams-with-verizon-on-5g.html
HANS HANS... my bonds are falling through the air!!!!
"KeepinItReal Warren B is the biggest lair on Wall Street, nice on the outside, but he would cut anyone throat in trading, he controls some computer models that buy and sell, he is a short player, believe me on this, yes he buy long term, however, his people have to make money buying and selling to pay the overhead, This makes me sick every time he opens his mouth."
WHERE IS cOCO?
Opened a position. Sp and div seems very attractive. I admit it was difficult pulling the trigger after reading many of your posts. GL
VZ can buy back HMNY and get the whole movie creation / distribution package!
"When you can not trust VZ to protect your First Amendment rights and they censor what you can see , read and post . Then for sure VZ can no longer be trusted to protect your data"
"You invest in bad companies like VZ, T, GM , and Ford you get a 4% dividends and pray they don't stop paying.But if you select good companies like Amazon , Tesla, Apple these companies attract a lot more investors thus the stock appreciate and you end up making 5-10 times your money.Do Not fall for "" capital preservation "" or "" Value companies "" . To me, a company's value is how much it return to the shareholders."
Ever notice that Ivanka's kid looks just like Trump? Has his walk too.
"Hasn't it already been established that this company knows what they are doing? == Point in check, AT&T said they were going the media route. Verizon said we're going the Transport route. Comments anyone, I've been w VZ stock approx 30 years now. Truth be told, Never have they failed ,,, dividend or otherwise. Now over 100G. Comments?"
"No Powell, Trump does not want to fire you. He wants you to stop braking the economy, so that millions of workers can look forward to higher pay, and a better way of life. Maybe one day Verizon will pay a living wage to its service call center employees."
The Fed is about to start walking back all of this Interest Rate Hikes nonsense. This will be a shot in the arm for Telcos.
"68k loss on the cell side, is very misleading. They forget that our cell service is rebranded frequently. For example we provide cell service for Comcast. Others too!"
"Another day, another down trend, just can’t win with stock. How depressing and disappointing. Oh well I’ll just direct deposit my $1300.00 in dividends."
yhoo mobile app doesnt work. fix it lazy.
Will we see 62 before years end?
"This stock won't stop selling until the Straight Path thing is over, since Verizon is paying such a premium for it. Once that deal is a lock, I'm buying into Verizon."
5G will be the end of humanity. $S $TMUS $T
Every conference in the country has been cancelled and we are trying to get back to our highs. Suckers Rally.
"Stay focused!!! 5G coming, IOT, seems like higher speed FIOS selling, looks like the cord cutting will slow. With all the streaming services around, it pays just to get your content from your internet carrier via cable. Too many options on streaming is reducing profits for those companies. VZ being just the carrier of everything will pay off IMHO"
This is one 'dog' of a stock......
"Great to see a little rebound in VZ. We will see better margins in Q4 from on-going operations. The Q4 #'s will be without the Tx, Ca & Fla lines sold to FTR effective 3/31/16. The 3/31/17 VZ earnings results should show reduced revenue but higher Operating EPS from the line sale to FTR and the regional wireless operating facilities reduced from 20 to 6. I believe this will result in 3k - 4k employee reductions. That's unfortunate, due in part to centralized cloud computing. VZ & T will see big IT operating cost savings from cloud computing.These dips used to draw posts from a harry ID. He doesn't seem to have made the transition which is a silver lining to the new Yahoo message board format."
Verizon wins bidding war with AT&T for Straight Path. Hopefully starts moving the stock back up!
I bailed my VZ in early trading this am. I don’t like what’s going on with China right now. Could get ugly. Good luck
It’s time to get in and get the dividend
Think I'll still get my chance to buy @$50
sports site schedule is worst since Verizon took over
"Do we have a Double Top here? That's a bearish formation. If you look a little further out, it's a Triple top which is even more bearish."
"yahoo finance running a story about Netflix smoking a peace pipe. an obvious dig at Native Americans. Yahoo finance, part of Verizon. full of bigotry. from the top down."
Try to force savers into stocks. Sure then they plunge?????? Wake up.??
VZ has to cut the dividend soon as many customers that VZ is now losing and the massive debt VZ took on
wow yahoo is deleting posts left and right good bye Verizon
"Verizon's general counsel commented there is a ""reasonable basis"" to believe Yahoo email data breach had a material impact on deal $VZ $YHOO"
"Yahoo Finance discusses the Trade Negotiations in terms of it being a WAR. So much like the left, to use harsh, demeaning, and inaccurate terms, in order to prove their worthless point of view. How many shares of Verizon does China own. Why else would Verizon continue to oppose the person who is putting people to work, and enabling people to buy more expensive phone and internet services."
"VZ/Yahoo lie of the day headline: ""Trumpworld 'worried' amid debate performance fallout""."
What happened?
I defy anyone to find a slower less responsive web site than Yahoo Finance. It takes over a minute to load the advertisements before you can type a request. Much worst than Marissa's time and I hate to say that.
"Yahoo/Verizon continues their disgusting America-hating actions by squelching conservative disagreements and opinion while promoting a totally, utterly biased liberal agenda and calling it ""news"". Abject dishonesty and pathetic COWARDICE is all it is. COWARDS silence the truth."
"Go ahead sell your VZ shares on downgrade, I dare you. Going up."
Time to sell everything . Take the FEd out of this market manipulation of rates. Screwing savers just like 2008 era crash. Lower rates to force investors/savers into stock markets. Same joke as before. This is market manipulation period.Time to abolish them. Same with other countries playing same ridiculous games to try to force markets up. I say crash and burn.

tomorrow it will be drop to 55
This is it all. When Big Red looks like this I hate to say it but sale everything sucks cause I enjoyed the ride but time to take the winnings and wait for a year. Good luck all.
I can't help but feel that this might be an excuse to bring VZ's stock price down to the same value as T. Since VZ has been trading a much higher evaluation for a couple of weeks now.
"TMF who likes VZ, thinks it's ""absurdly cheap"":https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ac826c07-aa2e-3f5b-8de1-f702bad9fb28/3-stocks-that-are-absurdly.html"
"Just had two more posts removed from this board by Yahoo, namely those that call Yahoo and VZ out for what they are doing. Also had another one of my accounts put into permanent ""Yahoo Jail"", which has happened to me more times than I can count. Means I have to get another TracMobile phone and set up new accounts. Normal."
"Nice div, same share price as 21 years ago."
You have to LOVE the divy!!

"what does Verizon have to make it climb higher, all reports are they are losing in every move they make, is there a new type of phone coming out or a new IOT device, I dont see it, 5G is still a dream, Verizon needs to show me something innovative to convince me to buy this pig."
I like where vz I heading and where they have been. just lowered my bill and got unlimited. looking forward to 5g
"Hmmm, Doesnt look too bad to me. Beat net adds. Killed operating cash flow again. What's all the doom and gloom, forward guidance?"

Omyernet in NYC as bad as the city's leaders
"Today Monday, is the last day, before it goes ex-dividend. The stock will rise as we get to close!"
The first thing they should do is reverse the changes to the Yahoo! website. I certainly hope they didn't tell them to cuff it up as a requirement for the deal.
Warren buffett better get buying because shorts have devalued the stock a great deal
Seriously? What was that all about?
No just cause Buffett buys dont mean nothing cause we the day trading boys are taking those dollars AND SHORTING VZ. EASY MONEY
"With the realization that any phone, and Alexa type device, (manufactured in China), allows the Chinese Military legions to listen in on every word you utter, look for Verizon to be a Port in the storm. Apple, and Google, and Amazon, have these spy chips embedded in their mother boards. I hold Amazon. Hoping the holiday gets their stock price up so I can unload it, and break even. Before anyone else, besides us hiding out on the Vz"
bought yesterday. was feeling the vibe
I think VZ has already gotten the peak for the day. This may start retreating again as usual and then red at the close.
VZ train keeps chugging.....choo choo!
I'm confused Verizon is the communications company of the USA. With the virus lurking that might be the only way of communicating without being communicable.
"When a company like Verizon is at its 52 week low don't be stupid, double down and hold for a year. Collect the dividend and roll with it."
"Our pivot point stands at 57.9. Our preference: the downside prevails as long as 57.9 is resistance. Alternative scenario: above 57.9, look for 60.1 and 61.4. Comment: the RSI is below its neutrality area at 50. The MACD is below its signal line and negative. The configuration is negative. Moreover, the share stands below its 20 and 50 day MA (respectively at 56.91 and 57.47). Finally, Verizon Communications is trading below its lower daily Bollinger band (standing at 55.09)."
"Back over 60 soon. Going to happen, after the dog days of summer."
VZ the company without a future in America as VZ Censor Americans this EURO trash company . American's are now dumping VZ in record numbers. Why because they are the high cost producer and they can't drop their prices fast enough and lower their cost low enough to compete in the new 5G world they now face. VZ will die a very slow death.
Yahoo is a joke. I own a stock that pays a monthly divided. After 3 years Yahoo changes it not paying a dividend. They will remove this post because they are never wrong
108$ vz valuehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-verizon-communications-inc-143959458.html
Stock price is still lower than what it was in Sep 1999 over 20 years ago. What kind of investment is that? Opportunity costs greatly outweigh divy. Why would one own this stock?
"Verizon says it's become the first U.S. operator to successfully complete 5G global roaming trials, allowing those traveling from the U.S. to South Korea to enjoy international service."
"My sentiment is it'll hit $62, then the next crash comes."
Road to $40s continues. Dead money.
"Summary Verizon disappointed on Q3 results with a $100 million revenue miss. The wireless giant just launched a 5G nationwide network that only promises to offer 4G LTE speeds. Consumers continue to use more data, but wireless service providers are unable to change higher rates. The stock remains capped with limited upside as the dividend yield touches 4%.While COVID-19 has impacted results, the quarterly results of Verizon Communications (VZ) continue to highlight how the promises of 5G aren't going to push the business higher. Most companies with exciting new technologies were able to power through the virus shutdown due to the need for more work-from-home solutions, but the wireless market only saw lower revenues despite higher demand. For these reasons, my investment thesis remains Neutral on Verizon."
"Hammer Fiber (HMMR) is a pre 5G wireless broadband provider for like TV, Phone, and Internet...like your own cable company. They can broadcast into more rural areas at near 5G bandwidth, and this could make them buyout target for larger telecom play looking to acquire up that market....mad cheap under $0.50"
Profit taking is all. Look for new highs after the dividend adjustment...
short this sucker geting paid today short short
must be buffet selling at 56.40 quickly
"Shorts are going to lose their shorts, boxers, trunks, briefs and long underwear."
Thank you for ruining my wife's birthday. Our order #5061071 was not delivered two days ago as promised and it is impossible to get in contact with a human customer service agent. It is sad to see how far Verizon has fallen!
"Amy NEWS of Lawsuit against ""Verizons ""Yahoo Mail PRO"" for disabling and altering Yahoo Email ? Altering ABILTY to print without part of copy blocked by Yahoo Mail Pro? The ""FAKE"" notice of incoming emails that are nothing but Yahoo Mail Pro ADS?? is the FCC action coming ??? Rumors about ""Class Action Lawsuit"" against Verizon for the ""Yahoo Mail Pro "" Stunt...Horrible LOW CLASS move from Verizon Management"
I would like to post that VZ can #�%�! themselves for pulling comments section from yahoo. They should change their news section to editorial section. when you control a 1 sided bias statement you never get challenged on your lib #$%$ so !#%� you VZ I'll go with a different phone carrier.
will the layoffs take out some of the liberal wacos who monitor this board?
VZ and Google. Interesting.
One word “5G”. This stock is one of a kind. T-Mobile is better than $VZ. ER have better room to run. Stock is under current avg. this is bullish 
so... what's the likelihood my October $70 calls will hit. lolololol
"what a terrible mgmt. team, the company needs a ACTIVIST INVESTOR"
"So many delusional people thinking this is going to fly up. Look at the graph, it goes nowhere."
"Unreal how much Marissa gets from this deal when she absolutely ruined Yahoo. The finance page/conversation/ messenger, chat, games, etc. I can hardly find one improvement since she took over. Stupid is being rewarded with 187 million."
Hans Vestberg to become CEO on August 1st. Carly Fiorina to be the new Chief Technology Officer. William Shatner to be the company's new spokesperson. IOT = Internet of Trek. Congrats to all !!!
"vz will go down until the dividen is 5%, then shoots back up."
"The quality of the two news media publications under Guru Gowrappan at Verizon are really bad, they are losing subscribers by the millions. The two publications (yahoo and huffpost) are basically leftist op-eds, they lack any real research or diversity of opinion on any subject matter. Verizon needs to get out of the news business they are underperforming."
4000+ shares = 10K qualified dividends/annum :-)
"Haha, on green days VZ underperforms, on red days, it's down worse than the market. I told you it was a BUM stock. Will go nowhere..."
"Sell VZ and Buy T, why because of T's 5G monster and T can leverage the assets it owns , VZ can only censor you from saying bad this about VZ as it dies a very slow death LOL,LOL,LOL"
"I will say this also, in this slow growth environment that the world economy is in, expect a stock like VZ to bought up in droves after delivering on their earnings. This is a SOLID defensive name for any portfolio. Predicting price is always luck but I can see this going to $65 EOY. With enough enthusiasm then of course even higher."
Poised to break ATHs too $80s this year minimum with 5G expansion and growth.
This rally has been a head fake. Lows will be retested as they always are. We are in no way near the end of this horrible disaster. VZ will bottom at about $45.
Sorry everyone. I started a position in VZ last week. Should have warned everyone.
absolute siht raise0.02 9/4/14 dividend raised .53 to .55 3.774%0.015 9/3/15 dividend raised .55 to .565 2.727%0.0125 9/1/16 dividend raised .565 to .5775 2.212%0.0125 9/7/17 dividend raised .5775 to .59 2.165%0.0125 9/6/18 dividend raised .59 to .6025 2.119%
"Basically just unloaded 80%+ of my portfolio. Kept my VZ stock for the dividend. Shockingly bad debate last night by BOTH candidates, points to chaos in November which was bad for stocks in 2000 (Bush/Gore debacle). Don't want to be in front of that train wreck when it happens."
Should spike .50 - .80 today
What is going on with VZ?
Anyone else having issues with their yahoo finance apps? Please fix it since you own it if I read the news right.
"cellular sub growth has decreased T mobile is eating their lunch,, more debt then At&T , being propped up by govt contracts,,, that is actually a plus point,, as long as uncle sam supports VZ will be ok.."
Verizon has a PE of 7.
Verizon expects to use the net proceeds of the $1 billion offering primarily for long-term renewable energy purchase agreements which support the construction of solar and wind facilities that will bring new renewable energy to the grids that power its networks. The offering is expected to close on September 18th.
corruption scandal brewing at VZ from the insiders this info was gleaned
Jim Cramer said about 10 minutes ago that he’d recommend only 2 stocks right now. Verizon and Pfizer. Then he added Coca Cola just after circuit breakers.
Republican woman
Just looked at the 1day chart above...Someone was buying a bunch around 3:55pm on the way up to $54So much for the dreams of those on here claiming it was going straight to $33 or $20's
Legging back into #VZ 1000 shares at $53.68.
"VZ, announces phone service is a commodity business."
"What's This??!!?? No comments at all on VZ purchasing Fleetmatic? It will make VZ taller, longer and stronger!"
"VZ has a unbelievable future, the tunnel concentration on 5G and their being the world leader ,will propel this stock over a $100, simply buy all you can every month"
"Yea lmao China, South Korea, Iran and Italy shutting down and quarantining entire cities, closing schools and industries, cutting off global travel are all part of the Democrats big plan to get Trump out of office. They are all on on it."
ABC news Verizon and other carriers SIM swapping scandal on the rise
We should see better performance and comparisons Q2 & 2H. Last year VZ sold off wireline to FTR and that reduced head count by about 11k mostly union jobs. The regional wireless centers were reduced from I believe 20 to 6 which reduced staff by about 4k. Last year VZ reduced overall headcount by about 17k -- biggest drop since 2010 when the first FTR sale went thru. Since 4G is becoming commoditized it's critical to be the low cqst provider.https://www.statista.com/statistics/257304/number-of-employees-at-verizon/
"It has been a week, today is Friday and my ID continues to say it all."
Over 30 mil shares short could have covered at $54. As we near $60 they will be hoping to get your shares.
"T-Mobile is owned by a German corporation, Deutsche Telecom. How is it that we Americans allow this. Could Verizon or AT&T buy a German telecom company???"
"Vestberg as new CEO - not a good idea. You know when you see something new, you find it exciting but soon it loses it luster because it is fake/hollow. Same thing hold true for Vestberg - sounds funny and cool and he is able to pick low hanging fruits of network optimization but thats where it ends. This will end badly - give it 2 years; writing is on the wall.."
This is a very good move for Verizon. The stock should move to the mid $60s. :-)
"As I keep learning about who owns what in C band, it's clear to me Verizon really laid an egg not buying Sprint. This article does a great job explaining the current C band situation: https://www.lightreading.com/5g/verizon-wont-catch-t-mobile-with-c-band---analysts/d/d-id/767264C band is critical for the ""meat in the middle"" transmissions, which it turns out will be the vast majority of the deployment throughout the US (speaking for US transmissions only). T-Mobile will have a large lead in C band, with roughly 50% of the band (quick ""back of the napkin calculation - I may be off a little).Here's a crazy idea...AT&T should spin off its pieces, and then Verizon step in and acquire its cellular business. Sounds crazy, until you realize it will put Verizon at parity with T-Mobile. So those of you p|s$|ng and moaning about Verizon being shot down for anti-trust reasons, just look at what T-Mobile has now in bandwidth. Verizon will do a better job deploying, and has other business verticals to utilize it in, but T-Mobile has the most toys at its disposal."
CEO needs to stop acting as a Socialist and start looking out for VZ shareholders. Very disappointing leadership performance.
"it's a moral imperative to get people connected to the internet so these phone companies and google can sell more products.. (it's not about money, )"
time to take profits??
VZ needs to walk away from TW and mandate improved quality of yahoo and huffpost.
"Sinky,sinky, sinky!!!!"
"Omg, it's slipping even further. Complete underperformer here with VZ. 5G, it's going to 100, what a bunch of nonsense."
They call VZ a value stock and capital preservation hahaha.....VZ is far from value
This sell off is amazing. Thanks for the cheap shares nerds!
Getting close to home. Amazon restricts all United States non-essential Travel.
need some cheese to go with all this whining... sheesh 5% dividend low p/ei am buying your stocks.. please sell moretia...
VZ better clean up yahoo or the purchase will damage the company image. yahoo is nothing more than a cesspool of left wing waste anymore
BAM
Its funny to me how the bell stocks just go sideways !
Yes the Government should be very worried about VZ and TMUS and the EU's one world order as they have access to so much data. They can tap anyone phone all by themselves and know one even knows had do you think so many stores that are held behind closed doors make the media by some magic leak .
"$5B - GW they overpaid. BUT- its based on discounted cash flow analysis, impairment will wipe the GW off books that's good for future earnings. Wall street looks forward- so no possibility of any GW impairments. They overpaid- morons but thats over and done."
"All, VZ is a $75/share stock. With central banks buying indexes VZ will be $75/share next year. The Federal Reserve will be doing $10s of trillions of QE to big up stocks."
people won't buy more apple watches or smartphones for x-mas
"Finally.MM gone. A travesty. I don't know what VZ thinks it boughtm butm Yahoo Finance has been sabotaged for you. PLEASE put it back to where it was 6 months ago--before YHOO ""enhanced"" it. It really stinks now."
"vzw still paying good dividend. long hold, should take off after Sprint- Tmob merger"
This company could create a cure for cancer and still go down
VZA reached a new 52 Week Low at 25.40
"Ouch!, why the drop today?"
Verizon had way too much debt. Cancel the Yahoo deal and save money. Make shareholders of both companies happy.
Verizon is the anti American outlet that should go DOWN DOWN AND DOWN.
This company started a new policy of sending refunds to customers via a prepaid mastercard. You think it's ethica? The company forces EFT on customers so they save $5 or $10 on their bill. They basically borrow $ for free by forward billing and taking money from your bank account and then when they owe you a refund they no make it difficult to get your money back. Accounting gimmick.
Look out below markets so over priced here period. Insanity big time here. I still see thousands of points sell off here.We have come too far too fast with markets.
"VZ is under pressure from the c - band auction and rising rates being pushed up by governments across the globe issuing debt. The US will probably be leading the market rates higher in the wake of Treasury securities issued for the upcoming new c-19 relief payments and big new stuff like infrastructure. The value of the buck will be headed south. I'm holding on for the income thru this upcoming debt cycle. I look for cap appreciation from my growth/dividend stocks like SKY & MDT to balance my dividend stocks like VZ. I would not be holding bonds right about now, and cash will be trash. Like they used to say in Chicago, you been told."
Boycott Verizon. Too many other good phone carriers
"nly has it's YAHOO NATZI's to delete post and drive customers away and lots of debt as VZ is now losing customers in droves to T's new unlimited plans that cost less and you get FREE HBO MAX so you can drop NFLX and even save more money , Just the truth VZ now has nothing to compete in the new world they now face. FACT you are now watch the death of a company by EU run HAN's"
riding this one out and waiting for the bounce!!!!
well I'd have to say you all got it wrong lol It's Green and Growth!! Bahahaha
Closing in on a $2 drop from $53.53 a week ago.
"Get that dividend, will they increase it though. Real chance of a dividend suspension T AT&T"
I think VZ might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. Not sure how awesome-STOCKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
"Two articles, one in 2014, the other in 2016, presented the logic of Alphabet (Google) buying Verizon: Why Aphabet Buying Verizon Makes Sense, and 10 Reasons Google Should Own Verizon By 2017. I still think that Alphabet will eventually own Verizon."
Just research Hans and his history with ericsson. Then tell me where verizon is headed.
"Because Verizon owns yahoo, does this mean that I’m talking directly to the company? If so, can you please get rid of the millions of BS auto posts on these boards? You know, the ones that go:“Blah blah blah - meanwhile blah blah blah”Replies:Blah blah KEYWORDYea! KEYWORD KEYWORD KEYWORD... KEYWORD.For *#rist sake police your forums."
"Joe American citizen's voice can't be heard through Yahoo comments. And here we have a ""communications"" company with Verizon (which owns Yahoo). VERIZON, stop monkeying around with Joe American."
I smell desperation from Trump supporters posting on a stock platform.
Conservative
We need an activist to promote VZ on Reddit tonight. Buffet is leading the way. Shorts will get burned.
Verizon=Stability in investments..............Go Big Red.........
Here's how VZ compares to ATT and T-Mobile: VZ - EV/Revs 2.85x; EV/ EBITDA 8.64X; Debt/EBITDA 2.9x; T-Mobile - EV/Revs 4.25x; EV/EBITDA 14.48x; Debt/EBITDA 5.1x; ATT - EV/Revs 2.18x; EV/EBITDA 7.2x; Debt/EBITDA3.4x. Looks good to me.
Over sold and will recover some.
wut a piece of shhhhhhhhhhhhttttttttt...........market triples ...VOMIT GOES FROM 62 TO 47............
"cp3, julian.....dumped #AMZN this am. Ostrich can even see 2 weeks out that this communist supply chain has just collapsed. Market will crash here in next few weeks if this virus isn't reigned in and from what I'm researching, it won't be. Going to cash besides 400 shares of #RGLD and few thousand #VZ. .....and I'm on fence with rest of #RGLD even."
"VZ regains footing? On what? Cow dung? T and daughter VZ are customer scalpers, wont stop to our pockets are empty."
Verizon is greasing the rails for 2019......Run to $80. :-)
nothing is safe folks. VZ may be a great company but its going down in this market. Take some profits
Fritzsche rates the vz at outperform 65$ price target on market watch please read
"I Verizon will clean up the #$%$ work of Yahoo - with web pages not loading, the mail frequently screwed and the sports section not loading correctly here in the height of college basketball season. Why does all that #$%$ happen? Do they have a staff of five or are the tech people that slack?"
why it is going down?
"Dead money Verizon is taking on an additional $63 Billions of Debt for the bids and building out structures for the C-Band spectrum. That's on top of $18 Billions of Capex of the the year. To couple with the $150+ Billions of Debt on the book, that's $230+ Billions of Debt going in effect before 2022. That's worse than AT&T. Outlook is turning extremely bearish with projected very low growth for the coming years around 3% YoY only on average."
"T & VZ are money-making machines in an oligopoly. T-Mobile was the ""disruptor"", but it doesn't have the scale nor superior product to compete. S is on life support, thus the cash infusion needed from a Comcast.Trying to take share based solely on price will only get them so far. Free lunch is over for them. Expect T & VZ to break recent highs by end-of-year. New iPhone, 5G, and acquired content will be a ""positive narrative"" for the next 12 months."
Would be nice if this thing drops to around $44-43 right before April 10th and we all buy and get the dividend at a nice price. Still over a month away so I'm hoping.
"Maglan Capital @MaglanCapital$GSAT wireless carriers, cable and techies as buyers. Techies is where we get paid $10++$MSFT $GOOG $AMZN $AAPL $FB $NFLX $T $VZ $S $TMUS"
"VZ 5G networks only $50 per month, that's very cheap, I think it can get a lot of customers, SO it's time to buy VZ, $60 per share soon,"
Testing 50 day. Time to buy. It has been holding well.
"7 reason buy Verizon: 1)monthly fee bottomed out, 2)earning better than expected, 3)wireless market extending, 4) added wireless customers more than expected, 5)5G networks coming next year, 6) stock price too low,, 7)high dividend Verizon added 0.67million customers, at&t added 3million customers, T-Mobile added 0.59million customers, SO wireless market extending, SO this time is buy time,"
"Consider: I made almost a week's working pay waking up this morning. T and VZ payed the dividend. Divs and their turbo-compounding into increasing value shares that pay increasing dividends x time, will allow me to retire early. I will be payed despite not working for the man...."
AT&T(T)https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-launch-mobile-5g-2018-050100729.html
All aboard! Last call!!!
"Very disappointed with leadership. They've botched their strategy for the past 2 years. Yahoo? AOL? merger with Cable company? Reaction to T-Mobile scorched earth tactics? Mgt. used to be a strength, but ATT seems to be the company with a coherent strategy."
I couldn't resist and had to buy some shares of this stock today. Keeping cash on the side to buy more. Total value play along with IBM & Intel.
I’m glad that VZ is 7% of my portfolio
"WOW you get HBO MAX for FREE with T's new unlimited plan at a lower price than VZ , You don't even need to make this stuff up when it all true LOL,LOL,LOL Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes as they lose more and more customers to T everyday LOL,LOL,LOL"
Why no updated news on crooked Huawei suing for $1 billion in patent payments in Texas court?....Hopefully they're shut down by Texas. Still...I think that lawsuit plus 2nd one filed weeks ago are what's capping any positive price movements :-(
"Han's is now running off very long term shareholders. They are now dumping VZ LOL,LOL, just said on CNBC"
https://bit.ly/2DX7MZJ
Corrupt system the FEd . Lowering rates to zero every time markets get into trouble. All this to try to force savers into markets period. How about corruption when credit card companies get ridiculous interest rate returns from 20 to 30%.Tell me how ethical that is. I say abolish the Fed period. Savers cant get more than 1.7% return on savings. So all this #$%$ by FEd to force savers into markets period. See how the system screws savers period.
Got my shares under 44 those candle sticks are me whoop whoop
Verizon is rolling out LTE Advanced to 461 cities. It promises 50% faster speeds with no extra charge $VZ
Why is so difficult for Verizon to get into 60. Keeps in 58 for weeks. So stressful.
"when does the #$%$ end,, it can never hold a value when the SPY is always being shorted,, creates selling across the board"
Phone on lock down ? VZ should be up Maybe subs can’t pay their bills ??
"Solid Q - wireline is a drag -- better results on the way -- expenses should be lower in 2020 because of the 5 yr plan -- benefits of the 10,400 mgr & supervisor buyout coming in future earnings releases. If 5G gets revenue growth YOY to 3% then VZ should trade for a yield of 3%...2022?"
"Not sure why the recent drop but with the Div paying 4.5%, it's a no brainer.Anyone know when the Yahoo deal is going through if at all?"
Why are we down?
"Verizon has yahoo fiancé run an AP story, about how Mr. Trump is wrong to take credit for the historic turnaround. But the fact is, under Obama we had the highest Black unemployment rate in history. And that did not go down until stifling regulations were repealed, and businesses were given tax cuts. So apparently Verizon doesn't like Blacks being gainfully employed. And you own their stock ? what kind of person are you ?"
Has Yahoo changed the format of their message boards?
VZ = quality ATT = Next GE
"Still a bit away, but 64 is 20 year resistance. By that I mean, 64 is the high set back 20 years ago. Let's hope VZ tests that level. Will be interesting."
"U wish to ""capture"" Next Dividend??? Time is running out on you folks......."
VZ is tired of being pushed down. Now getting ready to rocket up. Short covering starts tomorrow.
"Hans, your customer service rep told me the unlocked Oneplus 8T would be compatible with Verizon low band 5g, so I purchased it. He was wrong. Don’t worry, the FCC and CFPB will help me sort it out with you guys."
$60 by the end of the year easy! 5G and divy coming. The climate has changed. We'll see.
It is always about the news. VZ and T may be selling location data on customers and legislation may stop this.
Money from all over the world will be coming into this late in the day. An almost 5% dividend. Negative rates in Europe
I am Joe blow Biden- liar corrupt politician:
Credit Suisse down grades VZ today to neutral with 65 PT
A lot of investors don’t seem to understand debt in relation to cash flow.
Say what you will but the news corp has its job to spread fear and anguish among the people
And I see the post I put up about Yahoo's reporting on yesterday's (1/6/2021) events in the nation's capital have already been pulled from this board. Survived about 20 minutes. Think we're being censored???
"I have owned shares of VZ for many years, glad to see the upgrade. However using this as a Yahoo complaint area. There is absolutely no way to provide feedback to Yahoo about #$%$ webpages not loading. After 15 minutes of shuffling thru the help section and ""community posts"" I found that ""they are aware of the problem "" [after 4 weeks + malfunctioning] with My front page not loading the financial sections correctly - but there is no way to post on the ""community"" section now. I hope VZ is going to clear this up [I pay for yahoo email] it seems Yahoo is incapable of doing so."
"T-Mobile and Sprint make a little money, it can't discount monthly fee, it maybe bankruptcy."
"Will Rogers: ""Buy Bandwidth; they ain't making anymore of it!"""
"Just bought some more, perfect clip to buy"
People will be back to work sooner than they think of the dead’s for down This stock should go over 60 when that happens
"The market is having a long overdue down day. And Verizon has ordered yahoo finance to proclaim the market is crumbling. By the way, VZ is down all of 16 cents so far. If you think the market is crumbling, bail out on your verizon shares. don't help the left . start investing for your long term future, and your kids and grandkids. verizon obviously doesnt care one iota about any of them. why help them march to the agenda ?"
So now tomorrow we have T ER and then Thursday is Comcast. Wonder how those will or could effect VZ this week.
People will buy a lot of apple watches this holiday season. That means more devices on the network and more data use.
"Div? .61, .62 ? Within 2 weeks we should know."
"VZ is cheapest in the world, it has 50percent rise."
"AOLYahoo will be merged into AOL, will Yahoo be now AOL or will it be AOL/Yahoo? I saw the CEO of AOL talking where he sees Yahoo will be on CNBC."
I'm pretty sure VZ won the race to 5G in the US yesterday. Major nwtwork upgrades take lots of cash. Remember Sprint's 4G LTE struggles after they put all of their eggs in the Clear Wimax basket? Seems T may have just made a similar mistake with the TWX deal. Seems like a good time to start buying VZ on dips to me since T won't have the cash on hand to keep up let alone win this race to 5G.
I think it would be best for VZ if the TMUS+S merger does NOT happen.I dont think S will ever be a 5G competitor and their only chance is if they merge with TMUS.
never goes any place 61 back to 50s i cant and dont live on %4 buy here sell over 60
"Buy now or regret later!! Do your due diligence research and buy only if you know it. Otherwise, will see you at $100 per share!!"
"Today, Yahoo Finance (owned by Verizon) runs a Bloomberg story about most voters not having a 401k. While that might be true, it is a fact that more than twice as many people have 401k's than have pensions. Verizon, why does it have to twist the truth, and lie ? I hope after the tax bill goes through, that Verizon pays the old tax rates, since it didn't want it for itself, or us.And if you own Verizon shares, you should be asking Verizon at its shareholders meeting, why they are against the US, and not honoring their fiduciary duty with the money (shares of stock) that you lent them."
Today is Thursday- market in sell-off again- and MY ID always says it all.
"what happened to the verizon service in the north hills communities of Pittsburgh. can't get connections, calls dropping,calls taking forever to go through?"
"Slaughter time for VZ why WAY to much debt and way over priced . LOL,LOL DOWN ,DOWN VZ goes LOLOL"
The Yahoo site really is garbage and needs to be addressed in its content and functionality. Very buggy today.
New high!!!!!!!!! Will it stay????
"Ever since colluding with Hillary, and her russian spy friend Steele, yahoo finance has been on a crusade against the President, who all he wants, is to bring jobs back to America, and stop other, rich countries from stealing our wealth and jobs. Wonder why YF is like that ? Does China own shares of Verizon ? Does China say to Verizon, continue the anti Trump stories or we will sell our Verizon shares, and send your stock tumbling ? Yes, there is a battle between corporate America, and Trump. But he is not at war with all business. Just the ones that are helping to bring millions of people a year into the country, so they can take advantage of them, pay them little, and those few countries who benefit from limited China trade, while the rest of corporate America, the majority of it, doesn't export a single item there, and can't. Yahoo finance chose sides. And they aren't on our side."
Triple t0p but In this low interest rate environment not much if any downside as long as no dividend cut SIT back collect hefty dividend and wait for 5G
This one is going up!
at this point (after the commitment to reduce debt load etc.) it is clearly better to start building into T. (30.15 w/div. of 6%) rather then VZ (55.5 w/div. of 4%) may be a great time to write calls on VZ( out of money) just to juice the return.
VZ has too many Chiefs and not enough indians. VZ is top heavy not only with $six figure saleries and HUGE bonuses not based off of the business performance BUT personal preformance...this goes for ALL VZ employees...VZ needs to cut back on unnecessary call center positions that are NOT customer facing out....so much BS and WASTE are in VZ call centers and Upper Mgt in NJ!!!
"There is no better mix of Growth and Value in the market today than VZ, Time to back up the truck and Add is Today. Very bullish outlook ahead."
I can't wait for Verizon to kick At&t off the Yahoo net. Half the messages I try and read direct me to At&t. I can't think of a company I dislike more than At&t. Does anyone else have this issue?
Back up in 2 weeks.
Get in now
It's time Hans Vestberg and his sidekick from Ericsson ride off into the sunset !
It hit new low
"Verizon, your stock history spreadsheet is missing 2/20/19"
I’ve exited today. VZ has good points but somehow it’s a “Nobody Loves Me” kind of stock! Affects prices more than the business numbers.
i just started stocks n even ik vz is gonna go up by atleast 3 dollars got out of weed stocks smh to risky
Whatever I say do the opposite this is like an equity drive by shooting this is a very perplexing stock
I predict new 52 week high today!
"And, back to the reality that 5g revenue is years away. Good stock long-term, sell when near 52 week high."
"Don't worry soon VZ will have to cut the dividend, Matter of fact VZ is more likely now to have to cut the dividend than a KHC. Matter of fact KHC with higher revenue will more than likely have to rise it's dividend over time and WOW look at rates dropping like a rock MAN that's really going to help KHC"
"a downgrade just before a div increase, nice timing."

Look out below one massive sell off coming. We are so over priced big time here.
A few months back I sold March 65 calls against my shares. Looks like I am safe.
"All Thursdays, so guess what happens 9-3-2020 unless Hans gave it all to blm or some other left winged siht organization0.02 9/4/14 dividend raised .53 to .55 3.774%0.015 9/3/15 dividend raised .55 to .565 2.727%0.0125 9/1/16 dividend raised .565 to .5775 2.212%0.0125 9/7/17 dividend raised .5775 to .59 2.165%0.0125 9/6/18 dividend raised .59 to .6025 2.119%0.0125 9/5/19 dividend raised .6025 to .615 2.075%"
"Just remember to sell any move higher in VZ before the next earnings report show how many customers VZ is now losing to T 's Monster they have built. Was not bad enough that T was taking customers away , but VZ had to start running off both Customers and shareholder with Han's EU one world order agenda. As VZ Censor anyone on the right side of America"
$VZ...you do understand that with Yahoo deleting comments on Yahoo Finance that it makes
Look out below whole system will collapse. The FED will be at fault for manipulating rates below normal. All these games to force investors into over priced stocks. Same as 2008 era same game. Fed needs to be abolished period here. Not needed period. Same games as Europe manipulating rates lower but negative. Stupidity how can you have a negative rate. whats below zero. LIKe they have - .o3 percent etc. How stupid period. All these games also so they arent paying any interest period. Governments etc.SEE corruption there.
"How is Verizon going to reimburse customers for the massive yahoo data breach, that continues to grow.They should have severe penalties for companies, their management, and board of directors for not keeping info secure. lets also talk about jail time for these scoundrels who think so little of us, and put money that could be used for security, and put it into their own pockets."

VZ is the liberal sewer getting like CNN and MSNBC. Give verison the boot.switch to Altice
"I wish VZ would stop playing ""coy"" visa-vi YHOO. They know already if they are going to buy it or not. Only question is what kind of discount they might seek, and they already know that as well. There is no reason this deal has to close Q2. It could close tomorrow if they pull very hard on their hand so that the thumb pops out. Some kind of stupid game being played right now and it is a big waste of time. I guess the lawyers, at $350 per hour, are not interested in a quick resolution."

"So there are many wholesale and retail money managers repositioning now given the shut downs. Given VZ's performance I doubt it is on many sell lists, just the opposite. VZ will see some effects of C-19 in receivables and new biz but Hans doesn't look worried. VZ is plowing ahead with equipment and they have probably faced new work rules that slow things down but on the other hand there is very little traffic of any kind to deal with...https://www.pcmag.com/news/covid-19-isnt-stopping-verizons-5g-rollout"
Was today's action due to CEO stating 2.5% of customers are not paying bills? This stock usually rallies hard on up days.
VZ should buy TikTok. Better suited than MSFT and would finally get this stock moving.
Why the stock drop today?
"Yep, yet another LAME day for Verizon but tell yourselves it's going to 100..."
"Hey everyone, this is my first post on this message board. Searching to pick peoples brain to form my own opinion. I started teaching myself stocks for about 2-3 years now. All my stocks at the moment seem to be growth stocks. I’d like to add some dividend stocks in. I was thinking Verizon may be a good place to start. Any suggestions with $2,000?"
"Well I just got through my morning glance at Yeh Hoo news.

Thanks VZ for the great morning briefing. I wouldn't expect more,"
change back to old format
"My posts keep getting pulled from this board. All were directly related to Yahoo and Verizon, based on factual information. Censorship? You tell me. Let's see how long this post lasts."
"Verizon and AT&T should ban Huawei and Kaspersky for good. These 2 companies are notorious for terrible business pratices and spying for Communist Chinese and Russian government.Kaspersky had been used by Russian spies to gain access to U.S. National Security Agency files and was banned for use by US federal bodies amid Russian spying scandal. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) order designating the Kaspersky's software as an “information security risk” and banning its use on federal systems. Kaspersky Lab, which makes software used by millions, is controlled by Russian intelligence and has accessed the confidential files of at least one UK company, according to a whistleblower.US, UK and western countries and security experts called for a blanket ban on the Russian antivirus software, which is installed in computers in sensitive sectors including energy and finance and at least four police forces."
Hey Coco P so why don't we have Fios in Peabody Ma. I have a DSL as slow as molasses are we gonna get 5g here shortly.

"yahoo finance has a story about how to avoid the covid 19 mess, showing a photo of people standing in line.So if you are healthy enough to stand in a line, for hours, why in the world are you getting a #$%$ ?Its obvious that yahoo finance, under orders from verizon, is trying to instill fear. all because VZ wants to use low cost Huawei equipment. VZ doesnt realize Huawei will change the terms of their deal, like they reneged with Hong Kong. How ignorant can US executives be ?"
"Verizon Stock Is Rising as Subscriber Growth Widely Exceeds ExpectationsBy Nicholas JasinskiAug. 1, 2019 8:57 am ET"
$10M to Harvey victims (!!) - I've only seen $1M on average by the big corps like Walmart. VZ better come thru with a dividend increase if they're giving this much away.
I entered at 46.4 extremely happy it went that low. What’s the danger? Sprint and T-Mobile combine to eat their lunch? More likely is that the three major carriers left raise prices collectively.

"""youlong"", you asked what the last day is for an investor to buy VZ and receive the upcoming dividend. You must buy on October 5th, which is the day before the ex-dividend date, to get in on the last possible day to capture the dividend. ""A Yahoo User"" gave you bad information when stating that the date was the 6th. That is the ex-dividend date. For some reason, many investors get confused on this issue. Just remember that if you want to commit your money on the latest possible day to get the dividend, it is always the business day before the ex-dividend date. Good luck."
from a charting perspective I really like that Verizon is making higher lows and trending upwards. I think in the 5g game we are going to see at&t is a lot of talk and Verizon will walk the walk
VZ is going to be the next great company to die a long slow death just like Kodak did . Unless VZ starts making changes to compete in the new world T has now created. But I am now sure VZ management has the vision or the guts to make the changes that will be needed to compete in the new world VZ now face. Kodak did not and they took the path of a long and slow death. VZ is now falling farther and farther behind T's 5G monster and it is going to be a monster that devours all of it's competition one by one .
"VZ is not enough to brag it drops by big many dollars its up $1 big deal, we should be up 5"

Look what happened to sears roebuck. If Verizon keeps on heading in the direction it's going  it's time for a new robust direction
VERIZON -- Yahoo doesn'teven make sense. Yahoo supports internet service to customers around the world. Is Verizon going to continue that or just pay money to shut it down?att.yahoo.com -- For Americans that have AT&amp;T /SBC (Formerly Prodogy DLS) and opt to Subscribe to AT&amp;T Yahoo!roger.yahoo.com -- For Canadians that Subscribe to Rogers Yahoo!verizon.yahoo.com -- For Americans that have Verizon and opt to Subscribe to Verizon Yahoo!bt.yahoo.com -- For Brits that subscribe to British Telecom Yahoo!Would Verizon continue to maintain the internet service in these markets? Or will they basically just close down this Yahoo revenue stream?
Good day for VZ.
VZ WILL hit $60+ in the near term !!!
Under $58 today.
VZ loves giving money away just not to its shareholders
Can I still pump the stock lol
Owning telecoms lately has felt like being repeatedly sucker punched.
IN a few years They will take market share from cable and satellite as 5G is much cheaper and just as fast as fiber. No wonder ATT will spin off DTV.
"Always a good dividend, it’s a great one to own and hold on to, until you need the money for food."
Anyone who hasn't cashed out of VZ at these super high inflated levels and is not on the ATT train with a higher dividend and much higher ceiling in these uncertain times is just plain sillyATT 35 / VZ 45 is where the levels need to be in order to be a toss up for either one for investing. (Still think ATT is better longterm due to better future proofing than just riding the 5G pony)
Does this stock ever move ........so sluggish
"Now, what does the VZ business office reps really know in handling customer complaints on strange cell phone anomaly's ??So when you get a 'missed call' message tone, you look to see who it was - but it indicates NOTHING, as in 'no missed calls' are logged - except 'you do' have a 'new message' !!You dial to retrieve the 'new message', it's Mark, he wants to loan me $1000 towards refinancing my Federal Student loan at a lower rate (I don't have, nor have I ever had a Fed. student loan) - but he leaves me a 5054475315 to call, only to have some #$%$ trying to get my info!!Well everyone knows 'that part' of the game huh.So after the 3rd such anonymous 'missed message' tone, and 3rd 'call back' to the broken english speaking towel-heads, we concluded the call with a BIG a cussing contest. That's when I started my own 'call-back harassment campaign' with them .. well, they finally blocked my calls .. yet the 'missed call' tones still continued w/out a number being displayed on my call-log - but with the usual ""this is Mark"" message, telling me to call the (now) blocked phone # .. Long story short .. so exactly what MAGIC does a VZW Customer service rep. have, to find out exactly WHAT number 'Mark is calling me from', other than ""signing me up"" for a NEW VZW Plan, for $5 a month, (free for 30 days) to display my multiple 'missed calls', if I'm not able to capture them on my own (wireless) ""call-log"" display ????....... A complete waste of my time, so a Cust Ser. Rep can stick a feather in her cap, by selling me a bogus VZW Plan, that won't work under my circumstance ~ YEP, good ole VZW still SUCKS :-(......... and I'm a Stockholder too (sigh)......."
"Best chance to add today for massive gains in 2021, crazy Value and growth combined."
"I am a proud owner of Verizon. Do they service well? Most of the time. Does the company try to do well in a disruptive world and make the best decisions? Yes. Do they return capital to their customers? Yes. I get frustrated and have owned since 2001. I am long term and glad to own Verizon. Hoping for the best but expecting headwinds just like I have dealt with for almost 30 years. Go VZ. If not, we’ll then buying at a lower drip price."

"Moron Coco spewing his non-sense about VZ. Coco- stock is only off $4 from its high, while the DOW is down 2000 + points!!!!!your analysis suks"
Verizon is just like all the other anti American news outlets they love being on their knees for the left and taking the long one. I have gotten rid of just about everything Verizon hope others follow suit.
keeping pace with the selloff .....portfolio rotation down because the markets are selling off nothing fundamental Still alot of volume big money rotating out
"I used to be a verizon customer. They milk you for everything they can. Month after month I was on the phone trying to get a better deal. Every so often, they ""found"" something that would lower my bill by a buck or two. I stayed with them for so long cause they had great phone service. Well, I got sick of calling them.. Switched to TMUS. Very happy. Cut my bill at least in half too."
"AMERICANS WANT VERIZON UNION STOOGES TO HAVE THEIR PAY CUT.......not increased.. Verizon's union workers are not very good. In fact, they are lazy, and don't do their jobs well or in a timelyfashion. We recommend that their pay is cut by 40% at least. Let them only get paid for performance and they should have to work on Saturday's. If any one of them is late their pay should be docked for the day. Time we told our worst workers that we don't appreciate the lousy job they are doing!"
"Business Insider, the political news arm of Verizon, which costs verizon shareholders millions in lost revenue, pushed the story about people hating Mr. Trump. Yet not once did they mention how millions of Americans hated the previous worthless president Obama. Turns out that not only did racists hate Obama, but everyone who loves our country."
"This has held up well in this market meltdown. This stock just has such a great future ahead with 5G. Hide here if you can, dividend not far away. Is there going to be a Santa Claus Rally this year? We need it to get Amazon back up too."
VZ and AAPL just own itDont trade it.
"I see Yahoo is pulling out all the stops again, saying that 1 million ballots are going to be invalidated in 5 key states, and that militia groups will run rampant in those states as well. Now we're trying to ""scare"" the voters into NOT going to the polls! Seems that CNN's observation that ""angry white males"" will show up as an ARMY on November 3rd has them worried! Oh, and I personally know people in the Dane County Board of Elections (Madison, WI) who tell me all is in order there, and they are seeing the normal number of bad ballots (less than 0.1%) arriving right now. So what we're being told in the media is a crock of $h|+."
Buying more more more
Doubled my money on the Aug $52.50 calls in two weeks. More to come!
Why is this stock down today???
"Henry Blodget , an anti semitic according to the Observer.Conflicts of interest galore as a stock analyst.now working hard to destroy the country, like many liberals, and being paid by Verizon, a company that thrives thanks to corporate welfare, and Philadelphia tax relief.Do you own Verizon ? Thanks for helping them."
Verizon getting T bagged by Tmobile
Get ready to buy under $56
Got back almost the entire dividend !!!!! Impressive !!!Today should be interesting. Lets hope we keep it UP.
"hope this drops to a low. I'll buy more, this will be a monster in the coming years"
"Reading the variety of news articles on Verizon's Yahoo home page are highly suggestive, and even encouraging of, there being unrest in DC and at state capitals around the US. So to me, under Section 230 Yahoo is contributing to the unrest in this country, via their reporting. Hans, looks like you have some work to do over at Media Division."
Gun to your headIf u had to put all your money in one stock which stock would it be.$bac $amzn $ms $gs $vz $t
"What I like about Verizon going forward is the growth potential is has from 5G technology. Not only will smartphones upgrade to faster 5G connections, the ultra-fast speeds will allow Verizon to bring 5G into the home, enable self-driving cars, and even allow for streaming virtual reality. According to Yahoo! Finance, Verizon's P/E ratio is just 6.7 and its dividend yield is currently 4.7%. Both are great values for investors, especially if the company turns 5G wireless into a growth business over the next few years."
Southeastern Asset Buyout of CTL is coming. Major pop on large volume. They were looking for buyout partners. VZ could be one
Glad to see vz getting hammered today .More shares for my money from the upcoming dividend .
Anyone know anything about this Incubed IT deal? I wasn’t able to find a price tag on it anywhere. Is this going to do anything for stock price tomorrow or is it irrelevant?
Nice run into earnings VZ.
wf.. the whole market is up except vz
Everyone start boycotting Verizon $FB $VZ $AAPL
Why did they buy AOL? I don't understand that. No one uses AOL...
You still have time to capture that next juicy Dividend......I did.
"Verizon still has yahoo finance fighting hard against your way of life. Today they report the IRS is saying refunds are down nearly 17% on average. That's not because you are paying more tax. Its because you are having less tax withheld. I've done my taxes, and I made more money in 2018 than in 2017, and paid less in taxes. Don't pay attention to the lies. unless you are soaking the rest of us with your phoney deductions and writeoffs, you too are probably paying less in 2018. By the way, I don't see Verizon paying their old corporate tax rates. if they hate the lower rates, they should pay the higher older rates. You should ask yourself why you invest in a company that' wants to pay more taxes, and have less profit for shareholders."
Please VZ after spending/getting suckered into buying Marissa's mess called Yahoo fix it
"Today's market performance is an example of how a good, if not the best, defensive income stock behaves on many down days. VZ's yield is hard to resist when the 10 yr T yield dips. VZ has been a much better choice compared to holding or trading T securities since 2008 and the Great Recession beat down. Seems to me 5G says $60 is a floor until 5G revenue starts rolling, probably starting with commercial. I can see VZ or its contractors or 3rd party contractors installing Safe Cities equipment. We'll see how it looks in 2021."
Bear hunting season has officially begun.
"If things are so good at Media Division, why close the Yahoo main office in San Jose? https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/04/verizon-media-yahoo-cafeteria-protest.html"
"only VZ worth to buy, because VZ can eat out 5G networks, so VZ can reach $75 in end of this year , plus VZ high dividend, make a lot of money,"
Yahoo duh
Its time for Hans Vestberg and his sidekick to ride off into the sunset !
Ya that statement regarding S going to a Verizon price is a fair estimate.
"I must be touching a nerve at VZ. (Note to VZ - I did sell almost all my stock, but kept a small amount so that I could legally say I'm a shareholder.) As a shareholder, I am entitled to speak out and challenge executive management, in a professional way, what they're doing to improve shareholder value. I put them to task on their Media division, and what happens? I have my posts pulled down on a regular basis, and I get warnings from Yahoo that my messages violate their T&C's (which they do not). I'm awaiting the ""discovery"" letter from an attorney to uncover me and hit me up for who knows what. That I will put in front of their investor relations group and ask ""why""?So if you want to be a ""dumb"" shareholder and just take what VZ gives you, fine. You get what you get; often nothing. If you want to be a well-compensated shareholder, and demand the most out of your executive team, then all the better. And you get rewarded for that. Just ask Icahn, Perlman and others who have shaken the trees to get more value out of them. I am no different, just not at their scale."
stocks up this week and my call options are down ... never buying this stock again
"Thursday the market share comes out, so we will see what happens people, hopefully t mobile didn’t steal as much 5G market as everyone suspects and this goes way up."
"""Buy on the news, sell on the rumor."""
"Hurry Wall Street needs buyers of VZ so they can sell more on any move higher LOL,LOL you don't even need to make this stuff up LOL,LOL"
"Mr. President, please write an Executive Order, requiring mail in ballots have their Signature Notarized.That would solve part of the problem.You could also order that all mail in ballots be sent with Delivery Confirmation, so we needn't worry about post office workers doing what their union leaders order them to and dumping conservative votes in the trash."
Love  Verizon dividend payout days
Cutting the with verizon because of Yahoo news will spend 300 a month somewhere else.
I didn't know Verizon sells avocados
Verizon- yahoo not allowing comments to liberal lying spew.They should be classified as a publisher. Didn't VZ take a huge write down for their purchase of yahoo???lets review their 10K's for accuracy... is that true?
Is anyone out there offering 1G to the house like Verizon Fios.......Looks like its back to the fight for the last mile like 15 years ago with the direction of video streaming and cutting the cord soon to be par for the course!
Get ready next two weeks buyers are going to load up shares before the ex-dividend date.
"Nice move getting 40,000 employees to take buyouts. Trump may not be very happy out sourcing the IT to get cheaper labor."
"Can't wait to see what Media Division revenue and earnings look like next month. Last report they were down 25% (YOY) due to Covid-19 (VZ reason). My take - this is somewhat misleading. Covid-19 drove everyone INSIDE so what could they do? Eat, sleep, sex, or online/video. With the high # of people online, wouldn't you think Media would be UP rather than DOWN? From what I'm seeing with the web metrics, this should have been the case, and I call out VZ executives to explain to us shareholders WHY the VZ Media Division is becoming a bigger loser by the day? Oh, here's the link to the July 2020 article: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/verizon-loses-81000-pay-tv-subscribers-pandemic-hits-media-revenue-1304271"
Fundamentals haven't change. Competition landscape still with big 3. Price history indicates that this is typical.
Dow up over 500 and this stock is only up .47 cents???
sold 40% of Vz..buying it back at 56
Look for sell off. So over priced here big time. Over valued everything here.
"SMH........Up Huge PM.......Down Huge Now.....Hope ATT Tomorrow Does Not Greatly Dissapoint Like VZ>T Pays a Much Better Dividend Tho Than VZ.. I'm Collecting a Big Fat Sloppy $21,500 Divy 5/1 Baby !"
$12B in bonds. Looks like they are going to market in the December Spectrum auction.
"Yahoo, a part of Verizon has made the Yahoo Finance page into a joke. I will have to switch over to another site. Too bad."
5G gonna be HUGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
instead of thumbs up can someone please explain this to me. I feel as though Schwab adds into the closing price of the day the dividend. and I feel they are taking the money out of my account for the dividend only to pay it back to me as a dividends and get taxed on my money a second time????
"Verizon has been made a fool of. Verizon executives came up with AOL and YAHOO. Laughable! Two Clown Companies.Meanwhile, ATT got all the good stuff. (even the government contract to provide exclusive service to first responders nationwide. Clearly, ATT has got Verizon outclassed. ATT is the new and permanent king of Telecom. FACT."
If close today above 52.01 it’s can be up 53 this week
VZ reached a new 52 Week High at 54.31
Added today down $2. Thanks for the shares. Will add more if we should see $48
I see 50 and soon...
Technical indicators are looking bullish at stoxline. Looking for breakout at 55.90 for a run up to 65.29.
"WOW look at VZ going higher , Wall Street just might even get it over $100"
Its like a dependable bond with 4% yield
"Going Back above $62, and testing new highs, watch this space..."
Go Big Red.......
Buys should start coming in in the next 5 minutes
need to load up on verizon here. great dividend for income and growth stock
The updated Yahoo Finance mobile app is very beautiful but extremely slow and prone to locking up.
A_
TO: Stevie yes yahoo was formed by hackers their investment advice from the empty suits is flawedprobably Yahoo will erase this
I see yahoo can’t have enough reporting about yesterday but what about all those peaceful riots over the summer with burning of buildings.
Why would you hold a stock that you know is going down. You will just lose your money for years. The crazy bull is the only way to solve the problem. What you do is Monday morning at open is all the bulls sell. You then buy back the same dollar amount when it hit the true value. This way you take your profits with extra shares. With this stock you will have to do this over and over. When the stock does a dead cat bounce sell and repeat crazy bull.
market due for more massive sell offs here.
"VZ shouldn't be up today. Look at ATT, it's going higher and higher"
ATT added 1 million post paid? did I read that correctly
"Screw JPM, load the boat at these prices."
.....NOT to make a 40% profit....
I just cancelled my VZ service. How's that for a boycott?
I see the Democrats want to investigate security at the capital now. So for the last 9 months those peaceful riots were ok with them but now that they feel they were going to be confronted they want something done. The media and Verizon are the major problem along with the Democrats
"I wish VZ would offer customers the same discount SPECTRUM does to there customers. $45 a month cell service unlimited text, data if you bundle there TV, Internet and landline.Many customers would switch back to VZ, don’t need free Disney for a year."
why are the funds shifting to T??
"Now that Dish ( wireless) is demonstrating willingness to compete against $T and $VZ, Ergen/Dish and Son/Sprint should partner up. Leave Tmus as a stand-alone."
"Huge declined surprise for VZ tomorrow , just like AMZN 's surprise today in AH...."
nice 2% spike. Any reason?
Well. .. That's how you get it Done. ROF. hee hee. . ..
"For those of you who still read: https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffetts-mystery-investment-is-verizon-and-chevron-51613515554?siteid=yhoof2The funny thing is...there were signs of a major investor accumulating stock way back in Oct-Nov. Someone on this board (Triton? what happened to that poster???) commented on this, if I recall. Several block trades in the same daily time frames. So Buffett owns close to 4% of the company. That's interesting. Probably in it for the dividend, plus the longer term kicker of growth with IoT. May also see value getting involved with the company, or seeking a board seat. Would like to see BH on Verizon's board."
CBS is smoke and mirrors held together with chewing gum... VZ should bid only to get the competition to overpay for it.
We need more up grades so the stock can drop more often
This stock suck
Go figure?
What in the flying ‘ ‘ is going on now. Over 3%. Really? Sometimes I truly hate traders.
"The tone of this conversation is totally unprofessional. I came here to get some ideas on Verizon's viability and I am greeted with emotional children for the most part.Yahoo, if you're looking, you really need to monitor the site and clean out the unprofessional comments. Your reputation depends on it."
Waiting just a while for the dust to settle on the downgrade. Hard to beat VZ for the long term dividend interested investor...me. Look at the long term history of the stock and it has trended net up over the years not counting the great dividend. Better than a bond...
VERIZON owns HuffPost.....JUST SELL THIS AND DON'T LOOK Back.
Cramer says hot buy wonder how his action alerts are working for him
"NFL deal is expensive. Cash drain up front. It might pay off, but is not a big time winner."
Is it possible that the Yahoo boards are worst since Verizon took over?
"Before reading this, let me preface this by saying I take EVERYTHING Jim Cramer says with a grain of salt. However, if you watch last night's episode of Mad Money, he gave a compelling argument for 3 dividend stocks, Verizon being one of them, that are ready to break out. It's at least worth a watch. I opened a small position today, and will see where it goes from here."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvV3nn_de2k
day after drip payment the stock goes down...HMMM
"Unlike when on Mad Money, hans is on CNBC now and he's saying serious positive thingsCAPEX up by choiceVZ network working fine under larger load"
T...much better stock!
"I see VZ's Yahoo is still doing the ""surveys"". How many millions of surveys do they need to get the following information: * Yahoo message boards have become a cesspool of garbage * Many messages are in response to the low quality liberal vitriol put up by Yahoo * The majority of people will not care if the boards go away * Most importantly - most people will not care if Yahoo goes awayFrom my perch, the only two things of value on Yahoo are their finance boards (minus the liberal articles) and their email. So charge for those two services and call it a day with everything else. As for me, I have moved to other media sources to troll for information, and I'm finding them to be much more fertile than Yahoo is today. So RIP Yahoo; everything has a shelf life, and Yahoo is beyond ripe..."
"The VZ leftist propaganda arm, yahoo, is so dishonest, you have to question VZ's other communications, like quarterly and annual reports."
"Who has done a ""deep dive"" on VZ stock? I'm trying to learn more about the Verizon Media division, namely what are they doing with it? It's a small part of the company and I see it as more of a drag on earnings."
CEO needs to be compensated by the stocks performance.Period.
VZ should be REMOVED FROM THE DOW. Even BA's with all it's problems is doing better.
"I had the weekend to do some digging on Berkshire's $8 billion acquisition of Verizon shares. Really it just comes down to Warren using Verizon as a CD for his money. He's getting a nearly 5% return on his cash, which he can't get anywhere else. It's a vote of confidence on Verizon's cash flow and future cash flow streams. If Verizon could find an ancillary business that bolts onto its network, it could really increase its cash flow. That's the issue facing this company...they lack a visionary management team to discover such an avenue to increase future growth. It's not in Yahoo, that's for sure."
"Yahoo Finance is running an ad, with a woman without anything covering her breast.Its sad when so called liberals, who have worked so hard for equality, get the boot from yahoo finance, who, like most modern liberals, don't care about women, Blacks, children, and union workers. They mouth empty words."
VZ issues subscriber numbers ahead of earnings and ex dividend date. Interesting to see what is in store for the stock price tomorrow. It may take a double dive with this.
"""Hysterical"" story for all you shareholders.I'll try to keep this brief, but lost about an hour of my life the other night trying to give VZ more money.I wanted to switch from Comcast internet service to Verizon. Verizon spent God-only-knows-how-much-money running fiber up my 300 foot driveway earlier this year in support of my landline. (Copper service is going by the wayside, so they had to.) Keep in mind I spend about $30/month for the landline, and have been a customer with them for that purpose since 2000 when Verizon was formed from Bell and GTE.Guess what prevented me from being able to place my order with them for the additional service after about an hour online with a chat agent trying to assist? A credit check! It was a total fiasco on their end. At first, online credit check was failing because of a credit freeze I've had with my Experian account for about 15 years. The chat agent told me to call an 855 number and talk to their credity department. At their instruction, I unfroze the Experian account and the credit check worked when I tried again. Then when I tried to continue with the order using another link at the instruction of the chat agent, the online credit check failed again, and the second call to the Verizon credit check person then told me my social security number was invalid I'd have to send them a photo copy of my SSN card to prove it was valid! WTH?The chat agent apologized profusely and said another option would be to give Verizon a $125 deposit that would be refunded in 6 to 12 months (assumedly if I was worthy). LOL!I've been a customer of theirs for 19 years, have never been late on a single payment (I have autopayment set up), and they put me through this??? Needless to say, I re-upped with Comcast for another two years and Verizon is dead to me. What a cluster."
Why is unlimited data a bad thing this morning?
Pretty good day considering the market. Slow march to $60's.
"And Hans, you really need to get a handle on your ying yangs over at Yahoo. Now they worship Bill Gates like he's some demi-god with his ""sage advice"" on vaccinations, fiscal stimulus and other such matters. Bill Gates is one of the biggest -$noles in the world (I met him). He's autistic and a savant. You don't want to listen to that."
Disney crushes earnings. Disney+’s partnership with Verizon will guide VZ up a few percentage point to close the week
Hey Comcast just called. They said they want no part of this dog of a company..
"This format stinks, they tried this several months ago and received a lot of complaints and moved it back"
"Road back to $60s Begins, Time for VZ to climb the ladder to test $80s in later part of 2021."
"Vz stock is a great, dependable bond. Plus there is 5G coming. Every portion of the roadway will need a connection in order to make self driving cars a reality. It really is a no brainier."
Yahoo finance owner VZ should be shorted. All liberal all the time. Give no voice to conservative or anit-liberals. Shut off comments to all yahoo finance articles - what a bunch of #$%$ #$%$ #$%$ you VZ and #$%$ you yahoo finance.
Buy T now on sale and yield near 7% ....
"Get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL the next batch of sell VZ should start soon , VZ up SELL, SELL, SELL"
"Heard an analyst on TV last week that was discussing cable bills and cord cutting, make a very good point. The panel was mentioning that people are starting to wake up to the fact that the fragmentation of streaming services are starting to make them choose which ones to keep. As predicted by a very few... the cost of cord cutting is starting to exceed what people previously had when everything was bundled together. It was one thing to cut the cord, pay $75-100 for high speed internet, and then get Netflix & Hulu subscriptions and call it a day. But now with all the various studio's pulling content back to their own streaming service (Disney, CBS and others)... plus all the original content on Amazon Prime, Epix, FX Hulu, Netflix etc... To get all of the content you may want, it's now starting to cost more to cut the cord and sign up for 10+ streaming services than to keep what you have. They mentioned at some point, likely in the next 2 years the streaming market will be so saturated, they will start to lose pricing power and may have to start cutting subscription prices instead of raising them. In this scenario they said the underlying ""Internet Transport Companies"" are likely to be the true winners. As their costs will be confined to building/improving their networks, which they would be doing anyway... But they will not have to worry about spending billions producing ""content"" which may or may not produce a hit show, or even a positive return on investment. Even ATT which has a transport network, is now straddled with producing content for it's TW/HBO wing. Verizon meanwhile can continue to provide the pipe that the all streaming services will still need to arrive at a customer’s device. I didn't necessarily agree with that strategy originally (I was thinking they needed a CBS or Disney merger).... but I’m starting to come around to the “provide the pipe & nothing put the pipe” way of thinking. Let the streaming companies have price wars & run each other into the ground. Even if they were only $2/month each...(and they’re not) people will never want to sign into 10-15 different services just to get everything they used to get in one bundle, with internet... It's just too much of a pita, and not worth the few original content shows on each. So build the pipe… and they will come."
AT&T is just taking so many customers away from Verizon! I never should have listened to Cramer!!!!!
hey it's just past 3pm I knowbecause I live in NYC and that's when my internet cuts out
Buy on the dip
Remember when it's time to vote ! this is tiresome
"To the person knocking dividend paying stocks. Look, dividends keep people invested in a company long-term. That's a very good thing. That is the mark of an aristocrat stock. If you don't like dividends, then go to a stock where there are none. Those things are just volatile stocks worthy only of trading and at the mercy of the DT's. If you want an income from your investments you buy Dow stocks. You buy stocks like VZ. Some of us are responsible Investors, not simply Day Traders trying to grab a dollar from everyone else."
"Any VZ employees still linger around out here ?IF SO---- 2 serious issues recently developing..... 1. Why the eagerness on company behalf to settle a contract a year before deadline ? Could this possibly be a Trojan Horse ploy ?2. With interest rates rising exponentially, so is the ever so important GATT rate, which is affecting future retirees lump some payouts HARD in the pocket---- ur thoughts ?"
"Verizon lost 24,000 customers. While most companies are gaining millions at a time. I can't wait till Verizon, along with yahoo finance, go down to ZERO. Verizon is up thanks to the TAX CUTS. Yahoo Finance, reporting to Verizon, didn't want them.If you love freedom, and your country, and your way of life, sell Verizon now. don't be left holding the bag."
VZ is a great asset to have though it always messes my covered calls :(
When did warren buffet buy into this and how big is his position
Dream of the day when they merge with Comcast!
"5G, the network of the future, is still slow"
Guys!! Why is this stock up 1.70%??
"Really good ROCE number released today concerning Big Red. ROCE, the return on capital employed. It is a clear indication how well run this company is. The normal ROCE number for telecom is 5.3%. Verizon’s ROCE is almost triple at 13%. When compared to it’s competition. Despite all the good news out on Vz, it is still got plenty of room to run. But what I like the best about it, if bad news hits the street, it is widely regarded to be a defensive stock too."
Volume is so low just the the panic sellers.
dr a fauci and the deerhunters daddy.....same age....same resume.....forever in government.....didnt want a real job so they both coasted thru govt jobs............have to say that at least fauci can carry a conversation
"I would think people would be doing a lot of buying right now, since the last day to qualify for the next dividend is on January 1st.Doesn't that seem reasonable?"
"Time to sell any move higher in all your stocks , The decade of inflation is now coming and stocks will be the last place you are going to want to be"

Amazing they could'nt get enough of this stock at 49 and now they cant sell it fast enough at 44 what has changed so drastically in the last month nothing nada nothing !!!!
"""Jamie DimonJamie Dimon Jeenah Moon/ReutersJamie Dimon on ‘an extraordinary crisis’The JPMorgan C.E.O.’s latest letter to shareholders was just published.The letter is widely read on Wall Street, where Mr. Dimon often expounds, at length, on topics like the bank’s performance, taxes and America’s role in the world. This year’s edition was especially anticipated because it will be the first time Mr. Dimon has communicated publicly since undergoing emergency heart surgery a month ago. He returned to work — remotely — last week.Mr. Dimon expects “a bad recession,” he wrote, “combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008.” JPMorgan’s “huge and powerful earnings stream” enables it to absorb losses, he wrote.• Halting stock buybacks was “a very prudent action,” but a decision to suspend dividends would be made only “out of extreme prudence” under the bank’s most pessimistic economic scenario. “This scenario is quite severe and, we hope, unlikely,” he wrote.Mr. Dimon wrote of a need for a “disciplined” return to work once the rate of infection slows and the health care system is under less strain. He cites the need for antibody testing that shows who is likely not to get sick again or infect anyone. That makes Mr. Dimon one of the few corporate leaders to speak publicly, if gently, about restarting the economy and “minimize the time, extent and suffering caused by the economic downturn.”He also wrote that JPMorgan won’t ask for “regulatory relief” — but criticized what he views as poor financial regulations. Now isn’t the time to debate any wider overhaul, he wrote.• Generally speaking, “The current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country,” he wrote. “As we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we — at all levels of society, government, business, health care systems, and civic and humanitarian organizations — could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale.”"
Oversold
"I been watching Verizon for 2 weeks, and literally has had no change. Will this stock be good for the next 5 years? I'm worried to invest because of their large amount of long term debt."
Lots of long term support around 45
It was way overbought in relation to its peers. You cheerleaders were warned many many times.
"Yahoo's utter mental depravity, unopposed in any way, reflects so badly on the entire conglomerate of Verizon that it's very existence is expected to end before May 2021."
look out below markets due for 30% correction at least so over priced all games by markets/Federal Reserve games. FFed. Enough already quit screwing savers. screw Wall Street manipulators. They can afford the losses period.ed needs to raise rates period. Reward savers not Wall Street manipulators. Trying to hold up markets by cutting interest rates.
Maybe after a great earnings report this week VZ might go back up
Vz < $56 buy. Lower still...buy buy buy.. I wish I could buy more....out of 'powder' as they say. I'm feeling quite fine about it all. Vz.
this stock has too much resistance... won't make it to the $61s this pass...
Analysts are shills and idiots! Great dividend & making money!
VZ owns Yahoo. Yahoo can't get my name right. What would I expect from Verizon anyway. Look at thier chart. Down 
Iam out until I see stabilized chart. not losing 4 dollars to get .59 cents

Is THIS the kind of company you think will earn your shareholders money? If you think so, you need to STEP DOWN as CEO because you clearly lack vision.

"If you are going to buy T shares make sure you have your shades to put on because T's 5G monsters future is so bright and it's starting to shining you going to need your shades and a lot sooner than you think. LOL,LOL,LOL Remember it's your hard earned money by sell it does not matter to me , Just telling what future I can see for T and that the company is working very , very hard to make it a much better company in the future. If you can not see the changes don't buy become one of the bashers. But remember I told you to sell at $39.50 and now the new up cycle has started and any pull backs is a great time to pick up even more shares before earnings ."
Crash coming soon.
AT&T will be facing a class action over their late fee billing. The bills are not arriving in time for the required five business days return mail. So it can be physically impossible to pay on time. AT&T's legal geniuses are place the burden on the customer to correct the 'late payment charges' that are created by the company's mailings. That is playing dirty. Some smart class action law firm may file and force them to pay the collected late fees that have been paid by customers who were not late at all. Wonder how many other companies are playing this game with the UPSP slow delivery and automatic charges? And failure to notify customers of their lack of culpability? What a racket.
"double bottom at the 200 day,new highs in the near future."
"Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has lost about 12.5% of its value since the beginning of the year. Last week’s dip of 4.67% didn’t help, but Verizon did manage to avoid setting a new annual low during the week. The company’s 5% dividend yield helps keep investors in the fold, and some encouraging words about Verizon’s 5G technology also helped moderate losses last week. The stock is still underperforming for the past 12 months, however, down 6.75%."
"VZ the EU run company without a future any more LOL,LOL Get use to saying OH NO down VZ goes"
Temporary pullback. Expect srong steady climb for 2020.
VZ reached a new 52 Week High at $56.47
Why Verizon doesn't criminally sue the entire former executive board of Yahoo for failing to disclose much more pervasive hacks that date back much further than originally revealed is beyond me. The actual worth of Yahoo with all these hacks is worth far less and comes with much greater liability. Marissa Mayer should be personally liable for failing to disclose this and knowingly sell a much more severely damaged company to Verizon.
fizzle
"Yahoo Finance has an excellent Video Title saying ""by the time next election rolls around, everyone will be p'eed off.""And its like, well yeah. Everyone around the world, who is taking advantage of us, exploiting us, plotting our demise, plotting our destruction, they'll all be mad. Hey Verizon, Americans are sick and tired of having their dreams squashed, and you should stop working for everyone who has been squashing them. After all, hard working Americans MADE YOUR COMPANY."
"Who needs 5G, or even wireless, when we're all sitting home in lockdown? Cut way back on our wireless plans."
"COMPARE Dow nasda and SxP, VZ price too low, the reasonable price is $57 per share"
This is fun watching this drop
3 month cup and handle just formed.
"“It seems to me that if you can speak, you’re at a liability in the democratic party,” said Biden."
can someone please explain to me why my Schwab account shows VZ closed down 1.33 yesterday when Yahoo shows it closed down .73? thank you
"Love the new article slapping at&t, lol it's good."
Heading south again at close. Just sold all my shares and go find other stocks. This stock have too much liabilities.
Ole Stinky is on its way to 1999 PPS. But it pays a decent dividend
OMG...VZ please for the love of business....DO NOT BUY YAHOO!!!! It is a dinosaur. Or more like a horse with a broken leg that needs to be put out of its misery.
Did anyone see any articles on yahoo about the large scale looting in Philadelphia?
Ok so how many T-mobile users switch to Verizon. How many Verizon users switch to ATT and T-mobile. It’s all commoditized.
Low volume. This will drop EOD
"WOW is VZ now in trouble and it shows. Sell why you can still get a good price for your shares , because soon you will not. Why because VZ does not have all the pieces to compete in the new world they now face that has been created by T's smartest people in the room. T made a plan to take it all back from the baby bells and the government could not stop them. T is now executing on that plan and soon the baby bells will start losing all their customers to T.. Only time now"
"This will be a $100 stock by the end of 2018. They are the best carrier by transmission speeds, coverage, pricing on domestic data (because their unlimited data is actually at a useable speed), and will expand their lead with the implementation of 5G in the next 2-3 years. They exited the cable business at just the right moment before cord cutting picked up momentum and have an excellent balance sheet to invest in the next wave of high latency video and smart monitoring technologies. They're going to win back significant marketshare from TMobile, who banked on lowest price without envisioning a world where people want to stream everything."
"Just got the ""cease and desist"" email from Yahoo regarding Verizon. FINALLY got the attention of Verizon corporate. Finally. And I'm a shareholder. Will be sending them a copy of my shares statement shortly. That will end that issue. They can't handle the truth..."
in the parallel universe of Verizon...Verizon Digital Media Services cements partnerships with THEO Technologies and IRIS.TV https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17468943?source=ansh $VZ
"#VZ, one of my generational wealth stocks up more than most mining stocks today. FED cutting 5 basis points and miners are where they were middle of last year."
Selling is OVERDONE !
TMUS and S merger will go through and a 4th carrier is going to be started. TMUS merger backout is that S can use it network where it does not have coverage. The DOJ and FCC know this and all the cries of S failing when they know that have a golden parachute means nothing. TMUS has a poison pill. S debt is so large that TMUS wont make any moves in a long time.
"AT&T numbers were very impressive. HBO Max knocked it out of the park. AT&T subscribers for wireless was another positive. Regardless, I am a Dividend investor now. Yet I can't believe how well AT&T did. It's all good."
"Buying lots of $INSG as 5G tools out continues partnership with $ERIC. $NOK and $VZ , Huge Upside ahead, very"
hedge fund are pushing it down big time.
"I don't trust Verizon at all. They are worse than new or used car dealers. Same story as others on here. I go in to lower the bill and they try to sell me something without any regard to what I said to up the bill. 2 weeks ago I went in to see if they sold covers to my phone that was a replacement phone for the one I had, which is an older model and they said NO we do not carry that anymore. So the Salesperson's suggestion was to buy a new phone then I could get a cover. Unbelievable!! I laughed and said good try!"
#VZ screaming buy right here folks. NO ONE giving up cell phone services and debt servicing just fell to almost zero percent.
More shares for my div reinvest!
Nice bounce back.
I think it's time to take profit and leave VZ and its Yahoo albatross.
"T to the moon , VZ OH NO down it goes , Why because T has a future and VZ does not The next big drop in VZ is coming"
$58 by the end of the day.
did they pay The divident yet.
Funny how they downgrade vz due to price appreciation but keep quiet on amazon and apple lol! The fcn analysts play so many games
"POLL: 84% OF ALL AMERICANS FAVOR VERIZON OVER THE UNION SLOBS. Americans back Verizon all the way. The Verizon Union skum have now lost their health insurance. And, a few have already been turned away from the hospital. Americans are rejoicing!"

Wish all you losers would find a different message board
5g is going to be huge
After listening to slow Joe I can't figure what planet he is from he must be a Verizon investor.
Those with dry powder should be buying stocks like crazy!!! And not this crash. I’m talking about high quality stocks like $BA $MSFT $VZ etc that are trading at huge discounts
VZ is/has been the 5G leader ..... TMUS/S to be coming in at a strong 2nd ....... ATT is JUNK
"Telecom is turning into the next airline industry, only worse. Nothing but price wars & ""free"" service plans, all to a race to the bottom. The only hope is consolidation, but now we have outside players like Comcast who wants a piece of the action so they can bundle. If its not Comcast, its a Google. They could care less about wireless profits, since wireless helps the bundle. This is getting really nasty & I am debating selling everything and moving to safer dividend plays."
I love the big dividend Verizon has . This is a great company ! Att does not have a great dividend !
stock buybacks anyone?
"Yahoo finance has no comment on Joe Bidens position on the Hyde Ammendment. It has now evolved. No, not over a million years, no, not over 30 years, but overnight. This is how the left operates. If you don't stay in line, you get run over by there bus. The problem is, we don't know who is making all their decisions. That person probably isn't a US citizen. No problem. The left doesn't want any US citizens. They want world citizens. and you wont like the new world order. and Verizon and yahoo finance are enabling the new world order. yet you stay invested."
Fed outlook of sustained financial repression and rates thru 2023 says VZ is a safe place to park money for 4%. Odds aree good you get your bait back + rather than a small cap loss that lowers your 4% to 3% while the 10 year T note is about .7%. So there will be a good bid for the stock. The 50% equity for Tracfone and a continuing bid for the stock says the market expects Tracfone to be cash flow positive. No doubt a change of control will allow VZ to replace the T & TMUS MVNO deals. More load for 4g which will be laid on a network with fixed costs already covered to produce a 24% trailing 12 month Operating Margin which is way past T & TMUS in that order. Tracfone revenue will be high gross margin and drop VZ's average internal cost per connection. And they can be future Tracfone 5g customers or postpaid 4g. VZ is building 4g for the internet of things. It's an obvious winner.
"60 here we come....but wait maybe Phones will become absolete, with protestors and crowds only bullhorns work"
I'm thinking buy on the dip...
Is it too late to cancel the deal since Verizon thinks it paid too much? Will Verizon be on the hook for a cancellation fee?
I hope Verizon goes BK for their disingenuous liberal reporting with no posting allowed to counter their fake news
FIFTY DOLLARS A SHAREiS A LOT BETTER THAN $44'S.VZ is going to be the low cost wireless provider. It will be able to do big wireless deals. It could do another VZW type deal and Comcast can do the majority funding and VZ developes it so it could be sold as a separate sub (with adjustments) and managed by VZ just like VZW -- another 55% - 45% ownership arrangement. A deal like that could attract an investor who would put in an initial cash investment with a future Capex commitment of $billions per year to build out the 4G/5G network. VZ has lots of options. 5G better work!
Verizon is going to $65. :-)
"Much much much better than AT&T. Balance sheet is a lot better on paper but a hell of a lot better when you realize how bad the Time Warner deal was. Verizon is much more focused and is winning big with 5G and will likely be competing with T-Mobile to be one of the best 5G providers. If 5G is the revolution many expect this could possibly double. 5G is supposed too significantly increase our reliance on technology and access to information. Not a buyer cause i like smaller cap stocks but solid dividend stock, at the very least staying in this range and increasing dividends."
...so clicking on a notification in Yahoo links you to a blank page. Almost as good as when Marissa Meyer ran the show ... no improvement.
It’s time for Lowell and Stratton to go. Shareholder value continues to get destroyed via half thought out plans and strategy. Shareholders should be outraged.
"yahoo finance says covd is swamping the US. Yet only 283 people per state are in serious condtion.The left is in overload, like a backed up, we,t gaseous excretement.Only the let stinks more, way more. With treatment, its like a flu."

Verizon is a great short. no brainer to go down.
Verizon needs to dump Yahoo.
VZ CITED BY CONGESS FOR RAMPANT CORRUPTION AND TO BE INVESTIGATED
You're only cheating yourself by taking a loss. $VZ made a big move that's about to rally their debt.
CEO Runs Mouth....UP $1.00 PM....Huge SELLOFF Now !
bear's rule for now
"Where is verizons 5g network wheres the promotions. I'm getting really worried that they blew 5g by not having enough mid band spectrum. The only thing i,m hearing is it is only good as a hot spot areas such as staduims or crowded areas. i,m really worried about verizon."
Have VZ stock and just got their iPhone 12s and service. What a mess it has been getting all the things the sales people promised and the bill straightened out. How does this company even survive?
"Verizon keeps Business Insider as its ""news"" source. Costing Verizon millions in lost ad revenues. now, business insider has mark Cuban information, as though Cuban actually made any money without government subsides, or tax credits. what do you think his tax rate is."

Guys...this will drop to 54 but shoot right back to 62. But and hold at 54 and collect the dividends
Verizon is a double this time next year @ $120/sh

"Yahoo / VZ tinkering with news posts as one-way output ""spew"" to brainwash sheep readers to be as insane as the writers behind their articles.

Massive sell off until Verizon shutters Yahoo for policing thought.
"Btw, so far this earnings season my holdings are undefeated. $WFC $BA $GM $VZ all doing good. Could I end this earnings season perfect? I will update at later time...."
Adding to my position.Increasing my position in GPK.
"will close below $59, imo"
I posted the CNET article that said ATT smashed Verizon's 5G speeds and Yahoo immediately deleted it. Yahoo is Verizon's lacky.

"Verizon Media, what a dog. Looks to me like a dog with flea's."
"Don't you feel sorry for thousands of Verizon employees ? Many of them came to this country to work, and get away from socialism and poverty. In its desire to pay people as little as possible, Verizon is helping to make the US socialist, like the poor country they came from. Every immigrant that verizon has should walk off their job until verizon stops taking advantage of workers, and stops funding the left."

"Sprint and T-Mobile merger is a purely horizontal merger of 2 companies in the same business which by current law would violate antitrust regulations unlike the at&t time Warner merger which was a vertical merger of 2 companies that have no common businesses therefore, it did not violate antitrust laws. In fact the at&t time Warner merger will create a competitor to Netflix and Amazon for streaming services."
"Look at the wall around David Koch's mansion in Palm Beach. They and companies like Verizon profit handsomely from lots of cheap labor coming here without a southern wall.

Does anybody think this stock is overvalued?
Boo hoo on the YHOO comments section. Boo hoo. Maybe start your own server RACK of a bunch of worthless comments anyway!?! My gosh it's kind of pathetic anyway. We're better off focusing on the stock.
Warren buffet buying sure doesn’t hurt Lol
Added more to my long position. Dividends coming
"I'd like to add more to my position, current price is under my basis, but I can't find out why it's down roughly 1.5%. Is it cause earnings are next week? I know this stock trades downward after ER if the subs growth numbers are stagnant. anyone have some insight? Looks like it broke support so I'm hesitant to buy here if its going to be cheaper shortly."
"I notice that Verizon's Yahoo is really pulling out all the stops to ""influence"" the election. Not really working, because if you go to Real Clear Politics, you see that all the battle state races have tightened up, with Trump now leading in 4 of them (FL, GA, OH, and TX). This wasn't supposed to happen. IA, PA and NC are within a point now; it was 4 or more points for Biden last week. I'm curious to see how early voting will affect this. Also interesting to note is CNN's concern about the ""angry white male"" who they feel will turn out 90%+ for their demographic. I found that very interesting and hadn't considered it. Once I dug into the details it was clear this is who you will see at the polling stations next Tuesday - in droves."
"Terrible ""New"" format. What were ""you"" thinking?????"
"Verizon must be jumpojg for joy, now that funding for a wall has been pushed back yet again. Verizon, with their tens of thousands of service reps, can pay low wages with all those workers coming across the border. Comcast, Verizon. the Koch brothers, and anyone else who profits from all these low cost workers, should use their profits to pay for emergency trips to the hospitals, and overdoses, and gang shootings and all the other expenses society pays I would never invest in a company that profits by keeping wages low, and helps bring in drugs and violence, by fighting the wall. Can someone file a class action lawsuit against a company, that helps let bad people and drugs in the country. Know anyone addicted to opiods ? Your investment in Verizon may have helped them get the drugs in the first place. Think about that you greedy s. o. bee."

"It is great to get the nod from the folks over at MSNBC. They are in agreement with all employees, and investors like myself. Vz heads the pack when it comes to a high, but secure dividend. Whereas, the average investor has yet to realize that AT$T’s dividend is a ticking time bomb. At least till they get rid of Direct TV! Number two secure, but high dividend stock, Southern, symbol SO. Vz commercials are now all about the Samsung Phone and 5G. So much so that one of the Wall Street firms has cut their price on AAPL down to $165?. Ouch, I believe that that giving away streaming for basically free, $10. Is a brilliant move. Glad I do not own Netflix"

@bigbadwolfe Verizon sold Moviefone to Moviepass.
"yahoo finance now says Desperately needed supplies are landing in the US. The truth is they have been landing now for over a week. Sounds like the IG who said yesterday that many hospitals can't get tests. Yet that was from data 3 weeks ago, before the tests were mass produced. WHy is fake news telling us about the past. They sued to stretch the truth, then they told outright lies, now they are acting like weeks old data just happened. They can't, and don't want to get anything right. because they hate us. Imagine being a Verizon help center employee, knowing your company doesn't care if you live or die, or live in poverty."
"why does verizon allow yahoo finance to show ads of scantily clad women all over their summary pages ?they have several here today.Isn't verizon inclusive ? Doesn't verizon respect women ?Hey verizon, why don't you just have a miss america bikini contest ? i'm calling Helen Reddy."

Think of the thousands of families who do not make a living wage, and how Verizon stoops so low to keep them impoverished. Yes, the White House will get an earful about Verizon"

VZ is dressed in sheep's clothing; it is one of the few remaining value stocks that have attractive valuations; in reality VZ is THE growth and technology stock of the 5G future. Wolf in sheep's clothing it is.
look for another massive sell off here Same old back and forth day trading games. See massive thousands points sell off coming again
"Really, who is this representative ? ""“We’re pausing our advertising until Facebook can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable,” a Verizon representative said."""
"Lowering the target down to $65, ( by an institution that no one has ever heard from), is the street trying to pick up cheap shares.

AT&T is still behind us in 5G, and they can find no one willing to buy Direct TV from them."
Green opening.
Big short squeeze coming up!
$5 more bucks down and we all start buying.
many downgrades new tax law is not friendly to div paying dinosaur VZ
Overdone reaction
Three questions. 1 - why is VZ down now? 2- when do we get paid for the divend declared just a couple of weeks ago. 3 - is VZ in thw DOW index or the SPY index?
VZ crushing it
Buy T... You know why.
Verizon could you please fix Yahoo finance so it isn't so damn buggy all of the time???Is this site not compatible with Microsoft Edge browser??????
"look out below downside here far outweighs anymore upside. All markets so over priced. All games by countries paying no to low interest forcing investors into stock markets, Now that is so over priced. P.E.s sky high here."
All you #FB whiners complaining about #VZ.....wait until the State(s) and Fed Attorney Generals come after you with the Anti-trust suits.....should be soon.....maybe you can use your t-mobile to try and reach your broker.
Trying to do the math. A VZ share pays .615 cents dividend at 57.48/ ATT pays .52 dividend at 29.58 share price. Wouldn't you get nearly twice as many AT&T shares and payout nearly $1.00 for the 57.48 price of VZ?
"Ha! VZ down, T up! Especially laughable given that market was up so much!"
Verizon is down 4.98% to 54.04
Back to the $50s......Then $60s. :-)

"So VZ is close to a 5% yield. The composite estimate for revenue for Q1 is $31.25b up slightly from $29.81 YoY. The big jump is Operating EPS from $.95 last yr to $1.11 for Q1 - up about 17%. The big jump is due to tax overhaul. That took pressure off VZ's Capex rate. As a % of prior year depreciation expense VZ came in at 105% and T came in next at 85%. So the biggest benefit is going to VZ -- thanks Mr Trump:""New York, March 05, 2018 -- The recent overhaul of US tax laws will substantially boost cash flows for telecommunications companies AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., Moody's Investors Service says in a new report. The resulting improvement in the companies' credit metrics will move their financials back in line with those of similarly rated peers in the Baa category. ""Recent US tax law changes will result in an increase in operating cash flow by about $3 billion for AT&T and by up to $4 billion for Verizon,"" says Mark Stodden, Senior Vice President at Moody's. ""The extra cash will increase both companies' flexibility to continue investing in capex and modestly reduce leverage, while sustaining high dividends."" Higher cash flows aren't likely to affect the pace of M&A in the telecommunications industry or materially change AT&T's or Verizon's level of capital investment, which is more likely to be driven by industry dynamics than tax policy, adds Stodden. The extra operating cash will materially strengthen AT&T's and Verizon's dividend-payout ratios, however, which could help pacify equity investors focused on the sustainability of dividends. While Moody's does not expect to change its leverage limits for AT&T and Verizon in light of their improved free cash flows, it will consider the companies' additional flexibility in terms of the time frame over which a company's credit metrics may exceed set thresholds after a strategic transaction. The credit quality of US speculative-grade telecom companies will generally not be materially affected by tax policy changes, says Moody's. Companies including CenturyLink, T-Mobile, Sprint, Frontier and Windstream do not incur significant federal income tax, so their cash flows will remain largely unchanged."""
"I see VZ owned yahoo! is dutifully running state & DNC approved propaganda in an attempt to drag the cognitive nightmare, ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden over the finish line. Fortunately it isn't going to work for the demdonkeys..........again!"
why is there so much call buying going on with a 4 days to expiration time line. there has to be news tomorrow
The Stock Market is sending a message to POWELL !!!!YOU BETTER LISTEN POWELL with your rate increases !
Looks like I have debt problems now. Stock isn't for weak hands. 56$ by Ex div date!
Stock has plunged 30%. It would be nice if the CEO became a bit more vocal and supported the stock price.
"NEW YORK, Sept. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today declared a quarterly dividend of 60.25 cents per outstanding share, an increase of 1.25 cents per share, or 2.1 percent, from the previous quarter.The quarterly dividend is payable on Nov. 1, 2018, to Verizon shareowners of record at the close of business on Oct. 10, 2018."
"go look at ROKU, how is that suddenly a winner,, they rely on advertising, so if everyone is shutting down, then no need to advertise"
Overvalued
Yahoo..........Worst Acquisition Ever MadeTheir website doesn't work.
Is VZ stock price starting to react to 3rd quarter earnings which will be announced tomorrow? Down 1% in up market.
Verizon should regret it everyday that they bought sick yhoo
"Market keeps climbing and recovering, this thing keeps getting beat back down. Makes sense."
SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLGet FACK OUTTRUMP causing another RECESSION.
Elizabeth Warren is as SICK as you can get :(
"One thing I see coming in VZ future is a class action lawsuit as VZ is now censor and taking away peoples right to speak. EVEN when it's the truth. Everyone has an opinion just like dASS holes and they should be aloud to speak , but you just don't have to read them or agree with them , That is what has made America so great giving the right for every dASS hole to speak their own opinion no matter if you agree or not , That is what so many in America has fought for and died for is for you to have the right for everyone to have the right to say their opinion. FACT. Now we have the YAHOO NATZI that are run by Han's and the EU that are taking your right to speak as they censor and only post the ones they agree with. FACT"
I thought the news of free streaming from Disney would have a stronger effect on the stock price. Was I wrong?
Verizon fios for 7 yearspaying $125 per month. Never again. Comcast xfinity for $35 with my own modem and Roku box. Way way way much better with a ton of free movies and channels. Why did I ever stick with #$%$ Verizon programming??? Ditch your Verizon folks and get internet only then buy Roku box for $25!
There is already talk about what companies will likely cut their dividend. So glad we won’t be doing that. AT&T? They have the direct TV boat anchor around their neck. And a not to swift CEO to boot.
Share Price will be $65 soon.. $70s next year for sure..
Coming back slightly today
Yahoo will soon be gone forever. VZ not far behind.
Does VZ support censorship on the Yahoo boards? Is it part of the overall corporate-fascist agenda?
"Below is a link to the first of three acquisitions of telematics businesses that VZ has folded in starting in 2012 with Hughes Telematics followed in 2017 with the acquisitions of Telogis and Fleetmatics in 2016, followed by heavy investment in 2017.Where are we now? Stay tuned for updates...in the meantime search for articles about VX telematics so you're prepared.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/verizon-to-acquire-hughes-telematics-inc-156261925.html"
"Is VZ in any soon to be obsolete technologies ? Are there any disruptive technologies on the horizon which would disrupt Verizon's business plan? I hear cable boxes are going away. Will cell phone service become widely available for a lot less money? Just asking, as I don't want to get hurt like Blockbuster or Kodak investors."
"Well, I'm out this morning. Was a nice profitable run of 6 bucks a share plus one .59 dividend for me. Moved that money to T which is very underpriced and has higher dividend. Will buy back here if VZ drops back to low 51's."
Does VZ seem to be taking a dip before a rally back to the 60s?
Verizon is a dinosaur Dead and Dry going forward. Should head lower to $40s rest of 2021 if not lower.

carly fiorina....love hearing her talk...she is very bright..he and the deeer hunters dad are alikethey both like to send american jobs across the pacific......didnt help HP though
CEO--want to create value?? Revert Yahoo Finance to the format it had before Meyer screwed it up and introduce a low cost brokerage option that permits trading off of it!
"why is it VZ is not bought as a safe heaven, its stuck, i would have thought it would be near 60 next month..but i am long and hoping and get the dividend"
Has everyone forgotten how to run a G D business? Good lord.
Doing the limbo.
better learn to say OH NO down VZ goes as T's monster takes more and more customers from VZ everyday.
what us going on with this stock ? i am getting sea sick from all the ups and downs
Just $3.00 more dollars down and I'm back in. Hopefully before the ex-dividend date which is April 9th.
"Same ole, same ole -- excerpt from history of MCI - too funny...""After the opening of the long distance market in 1984, companies such as MCI and Sprint were able to compete for customers with AT&T. One of MCI's early advertising success stories was to hire the same actors used in a previous AT&T commercial. As in the AT&T commercial, the woman actor was crying. In the AT&T version, when the husband asked why, the wife replied ""he said he loved me"" referring to the conversation just ended with a son who was in a distant part of the country. It was part of AT&T's very effective ""Reach Out"" ad strategy. In the MCI version, when the husband asked the wife why she was crying, she replied ""I just received my phone bill""... after which an announcer's voice stated ""You're not talking too much, you're just paying too much. MCI: The Nation's New Long Distance Telephone Company."" The ads were created by Ally & Gargano."""
Target increased !
Poor Jennifer thinks money is more important than your First Amendment rights . I would even bet Warren is trying to find away out of the BIG MISTAKE Warren has made
I purchased a few ... but I am small peanuts...its a start
Looking forward to dumping fios and will almost be free of Verizon
Somebody knows something!!! SELL AT ANY PRICE!!!
simply a BUY at these prices
"All this carnage started when the Fed released its minutes. The rate hikes, designed to cool off demand for jobs.Even though there is low unemployment, the labor participation rate is still off. So the Fed, for the likes of the Koch Brothers, Verizon, and Comcast, choke off growth, and the need to increase wages. And your stock price is collateral damage. I like it. You shouldn't prosper when you, as a shareholder, and your company, helped keep wages for low paying workers low."
"VERIZON, jow the self proclaimed suppressors of free speech. They like THEIR 1st Amendment rights, just not YOURS. Disgusting. Boycott Verizon."
Looking back two years to November 2017 -- VZ bottomed at about $44.50. VZ had warned that 2017 would see about flat revenue & EPS. Obviously a brighter outlook for the next two years as revenue and Op EPS are growing. I'm not looking for 16 pts in the next two yrs. But I can see $70 by 11/21 if revenue picks up from 5G. I expect to make 10% - 15% a yr for the next two yrs.
"VZ the true disaster LOL,LOL,LOL WOW look at all the debt you get with every share you purchase of VZ more than double the debt of T WOW What VZ debt now over $250 a share. WOW TIMBER VZ"

"Did Obama Interfere with Election by Telling Illegals to Vote? Obama will not answer the question. But says Russia did hack the US but never told public that US hacks other countries daily.by Michael Becker on in NewsThe following excerpt is from an article that originally appeared on Joe For AmericaDemocrats are all in a lather accusing “the Russians” of interfering with the election by helping Donald Trump. There’s a number of things wrong with that theory.No matter who hacked into the DNC or got John Podesta to give them his email password, the issue isn’t who did the hacking, the issue is the emails that highly placed officials in both the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign wrote.It wasn’t “the Russians” who convinced Donna Brazile to turn over questions that were going to be asked of Hillary in the CNN debate. It wasn’t “the Russians” who work to stack the deck against Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. And it wasn’t “the Russians” who collaborated with the mainstream media to do everything possible to paint Donald Trump in a bad light and ignore the disaster that is Hillary Clinton.On the other hand, there were people who were… I wonder if the liberal press will look into it. I doubt it. Who cares Trump won anyway."
"DOWN and RED VZ goes LOL,LOL that will teach them to censor people as millions of customers are now dumping VZ , LOL,LOL,LOL VZ a company run by the EU right HAN's"
added to position at close
Why VZ struggling to break out ?
"Told you guys, you needed to sell VZ and jump on the higher dividend and higher ceiling T-rain. It is nothing personal, just good old market timing. I have both in my portfolio and hope they both do well."
Markets will crash because the whole system is broke with bail outs . ITs all paper money its worthless.Cant back it up period.
5G is the next secular global technology and will enable the telecoms to eat up broadband market share for internet connectivity. Buy the telecoms especially market leader Verizon.
VZ is going to layer on 5G revenue. It's largely staffed by white collar employees. Couple the big revenue growth ahead with the Trump Tax Cut and it's what we call on the street a golden double whammy.
"t bought twx is very good news for VZ, because VZ 5G wireless network can replace cable, t bought twx sure be lose huge money, twx worth $85bln, SO VZ worth $300bln, strong buy VZ can make a lot of money, VZ 5G wireless network sure bring more business for Verizon,"
sprint-T-mobile will not affect Vz lead interest rate freeze should help debt payments
R is a short and losing big R nobody is selling we are all buying
internet down then sluggish for over an hourwhat vz gets away with in Manhattan is terrible
I'll double down @ $49
"Tim Armstrong is leaving finally,nothing but mistake after mistake in the vertical acquisitions.At least they didn’t spend the kinda of money that AT&T is planning on."
"Don't complicate things.Keep it simple: do you accept and like a 4.2% yield? It is a good yield. I don't see anything wrong with that, buy if you like that. Don't expect a run of $10 points though. oh make that a little more than 4.2% as she sinking as I type.real dumb matt sure misled some of you, did he even apologize?"
This will pop back to57.5 in the next week or so. Then to$60.00
Finally up
"Its really hard to watch Biden and Pelosi talk. Or rather try to talk. Can anyone imagine people, who don't have the mental capacity to carry on a normal conversation, are making decisions affecting your life, and your family ? But they are good at raising money. And on the left, while they TALK about the poor, they are really all about extracting power and enriching themselves. if they were all about the poor, they would be thanking the President every day, for creating millions of jobs."
"Verizon stock really really lagging in this run-up. Crazy,.....Perhaps someone knows some bad news coming out."
Can the new CEO deliver to Wall Street?? We'll find out in a few hours. I havent been impressed so far. He's too quiet & modest and is getting lost in today's age of outspoken CEOs and leaders.
Unload while you can. This is another s__t stock.
Clobbered! still..Vz is the stock to hold...my DIV keeps rolling in...
Good revenue growth. Good earnings. Wireless subscribers better than expected. Good news...
WFT is wrong with Yahoo finance ? That area and the sports section have been goofy for 2 days with nothing loading and broken links. The only 2 areas of Yahoo that actually get a lot of action I bet.
Ridiculous.
"I know one thing, I wouldn't short VZ stock now. I predict 20% upside from here."
how is Marc Reed still active?
"Verizon is Buffett's 5th largest position. That was disclosed in Berkshire Hathaway's annual report released on Saturday. Warren doesn't put on large positions unless he's really looked under the hood. My take is he was very aware of what Verizon spent on spectrum (egads - over $40 BILLION - why didn't they buy Sprint; there were ways they could have negated the anti-trust issues). I think he also sees what I see with the Media division. It needs work. It also has hidden value. Get rid of the politics, and keep the good parts (finance, sports, email, etc.) and you've got something. Otherwise, it's a waste."
"Ganbadei Verizon, The Best and Biggest Telecommunication company in the US, Bar None. We will see $100 within 2-3 years max."
under 59 end of week
At $60 per share the stock still pays over a 3.5% yield
49 lets go
Well. .. That didn't last long == Make me a millionaire on one stock gotta love it.!?!
Sell the close major pump dump
Green or red tomorrow?
"Yahoo Finance has a story on Erin Burnetts wife. Thats right. There are millions of hetero couples, but VZ, and YF want to help destroy the American Family, its morals and values, and push gays. They both hate religion. After they wreck Christians, they will target Muslims, and already have. it was called Arab Spring."
"FACT is any move Higher you better sell before Warren starts selling for the VERY big mistake Warren has made for investing in a company that does not protect your First Amendment right and VZ is now even breaking your First Amendment rights for CENSORING what you can see, read and post."
"Pleases,somebodytake the credit card away from CEO Hans, ""Verizon will be the first wireless carrier,,,,on Mars"".Cut cost,lower debt and firm up the balance sheet!!!!!"
Is congress considering stopping companies from paying dividends?
Sitting on only $9B in cash but $138Bin debt. DEAD MONEY
Listen folks for you professional tradersRSI 6050 DMA crosses the 200 DMAMACD goin up along with trading volumeAnalyst Upgrades to BuyEx Dividend date 7/9If you don’t know what all this means then you shouldn’t be trading!
Financials for VZ are EXCEPTIONALLY better than ATT
"Good time to use sideline cash. The trump trade is dead, now the trump pain is in. For Corporations holding overseas cash this is a great time to repat and use cash to buy their own stocks. Presently leaning more towards T than VZ until quarterly report is in."
I’m buying on pullbacks
"Yep, VZ is a HAS BEEN. Totally pointless to own this one."
$45-46 coming
"Any company that can afford to produce more and spend more in a recession, is a company worth buying. The next couple of earnings will likely be low considering they are lifting late fees and not canceling unpaid contracts. BUT, this company flat out makes money and seems to be ethical. Plus the dividend looks mighty attractive too ;) BUY BUY BUY"
I’m buying more tomorrow after the ex dividend
It is nice. Just keep buy a little more as it drops.
Finally started to get wide-spread advertising for HBO Max. Go T!
VZ. IQST
VZ 5g is PATHETIC. VZ CEO is a failure!
What a disaster. Worse stock in my portfolio . Little chance of meaningful growth.
"Analysts agree that VZ is doomed. The only part of their business making any profit is wireless. With T-Mobile having the best 5g network, the wireless operating margins will go from 36% to 0% for VZ, essentially making this company a going concern."
Verizon is down 5.51% to 51.81
I read recently that the 5g spectrum is equivalent to airport scanners. Does this raise any health dangers?
why this was up so much today?
"Verizon is an annuity payment, as long as they continue with dividend and raising dividend, this is a long-term keeper. you can only get 2% in money market, so a 4% yield is nice. trade it if you want, add on any big dips to low 40's."
Buy at 42 it is range bound

Hello longs. If you buy by Tuesday the 6th will you get the dividend.? Taking 3 days to settle always confuses me.
"Seems like a lot of people in this conversation are confused about the #vz offer. The 4.8 billion is just for the core business. That's this yahoo finance property, yahoo sports, yahoo news and a few other things. $yhoo shares include assets such as 15% of alibaba worth ~$32billion, 35% of yahoo Japan worth ~$9billion, $7+ billion in cash and short term They are not paying $4.8 billion (~$5/share) for you $39 $yhoo shares"
From what I read..... The selloff of VZ today is temporary. They still have the majority of subs in the market and are coming out with 5G phones this month. Any thoughts?
"Is this the time for a shareholder class action lawsuit against VZ? Yahoo, part of VZ's Media Division, has gone off the rails with its libelous reporting (yes, libelous) since they muted comments. Some of the articles I'm saving have no verifiable sources, or do not align in any way with the known verified knowledge of the subject matter. Yahoo's reporting on the coronavirus, in particular, borders on inciting panic.I don't know what goes on in the executive halls of VZ over in Basking Ridge, NJ. Hans Vestberg, on the very remote outside chance this post makes it way to you, can you please ""man up"" and take charge of what's going on over at your Media Division? Shareholders see what your company is doing with Media, and some like me are starting to get riled. It's fine to have an opinion and express it, it's another thing to make it a corporate agenda that negatively impacts your operating results.Perhaps it's time for a phone call to Jones Day???"
No it;s Funny. Like I said my ONE Financial advisor. I said make me some money or else you're gone. He said etf etf ... So I signed papers and I compared it to Edward Jones my dad. -400$ my Net + 4000. With Ameriprise Financial. Like I've always said I manage my own w/Fidelity however my gosh this guy is pretty good.
"Yes Yahoo c/o Verizon continues their COWARDLY stifling of opinion as they CONTINUALLY place story after story bashing the President and promoting their blatantly biased anti-conservative, anti-American agenda. Such cowardly pukes. Their actions PROVE the inferiority of their purpose."
When the next election comes you all need to vote these incompetents out and put new leadership in its place. I have owned this stock for over 4 yeas and since buying the balance of Verizon wireless they have made error after error. Very shortsighted and exceptionally slow to move when competition from Sprint and T-Mobile heated up. Lost tremendous market share in deciding not to immediately meet the growing competition for new and increased Data Plans.
Good grief!! Dow [up over 200] and S&P 500 up over 1% and VZ down - sucks
"I'll POST this again.My Dad, my uncle, my relatives have all PAID their houses off w this stock. It's an INCOME stock not a day trader. If you don't know the difference you should look it up. It worked for my parents and it just WORKS. 5G will be the kicker and drive it to $75. IMO. .."
"yahoo finance has a black lives matters ad. You'd think blm would not give any money to verizon, since verizon is still fighting the wall, and wants cheap labor coming across the border. That cheap labor helps keep Black unemployment high. yes, verizon, comcast, they all want cheap labor. and they will hurt anyone who gets in their way. If VZ and yahoo finance and comcast had their way, there wouldn't be a labor day. only forced labor."
"What I like about Verizon:Modest steady growthVery reliable & juicy dividendCutting edge innovationProbability that Disney, Comcast or CBS would love to merge with usVZ shareowners can sleep at night after making sure their cell phones are on their chargers (lol)"
"TMUS and s don't have enough customers to increase their networks signals, SO their networks signals very bad, SO they will lose customers, their monthly fee too low , SO they don't have enough money to build 5G networks, SO only VZ worth to buy,"
"5yrs ago, VZ was $54.08, so in 5yrs it’s gone up $0.42,Hahahahahaha!!!!"
"With all this voter fraud in the news, voter recounts, etc. I feel that it is likely the overall market will be down next week. Glad to say it, but VZ is a place to put money when overall things go south. But with 5G, it looks good for a nice tech upside too. A stock for all seasons"
i sold vz and bought t.
people are idi$@! if they don't buy at this price
"Typo in the previous post, time was 1 minute 6 seconds not 3 minutes"
"POS stock,,not a safe heaven when in 3 hours drops 2 points,"

is VZ a good value investment right now? for long term buy and hold.

Communication is the key to success. Telecom companies are more important than ever. If your quarantined at least you have the internet. Go Big Red!
"Vestberg was ousted from Ericsson for repeatedly missing quarterly financial targets. He's also on ""climate change"" boards, like every European (all liberal). Does not bode well for VZ, sorry."
"Earlier today, I wrote about VZ debt of $200 Billion and got attacked by many so called "" investors "". Here is what I want you to know guys: Last 3 years VZ paid me 4-5% dividends while TSLA went up 13 times. If you don't see the difference then you have no business being in the stock market"
BYE BYE Net Neutrality.......Go VZ!
I'm buyingggggggggg
"Vz and T ,,,, T has made some large acquisitions using debt good news is debt is almostcoming at no cost ( interest rates are so low) but T has to make these purchasers work for the bottom lineand that is in ??????? Vz is better balance sheet , and their investment in ""build out"" for data , tv and internet , and digital signaling seems to be a good bet right now so these strange down drafts on days when Vz is the only stock down make little sense , except when a big playerlike Fidelity or Blackrock or American funds is repositioning ,clearly it is not the small retail trader who is moving this stock"
Verizon is the nations biggest SCAM company. Completely unethical company
"With the new corporate tax rates OF 20% and the end of Net Neutrality, this stock can easily be 10 points higher."
Once sell in May kicks in coupled with higher interest rates this will go down much more
"How are we feeling about VZ? Its looking skeptical. I took a recent position, might add more."
"verizons'5G networks sure be boost it's sales growth next year,"
why it is falling 3 days in a row
"Biden says he will only increase taxes on those who make over 400,000 per year. NOT TRUE.When he raises corporate taxes, we will ALL pay more money. And, Verizons earnings will plummet.Why does Verizon want its earnings to tank ? Don't they serve their shareholders, the people who own the company ?"
"January 50 Calls PLUMMETED 45% in last 10 minutes of trading I'll take THAT as a NEGATIVE---- HmmmWith earnings release tmrw a.m., YIKES !"
"Basically ever since Warren bought in, it's went down. Man has he lost the touch."
You will see under 50 before this settles down. Then the slow climb up before 2021 Q1 earnings.
Just in.... Snapchat is in talks to acquire Verizon!
Verizon selling unlimited data and voice for $40 a month. What this really means is that US companies have been gouging US consumers for years. it also means lower profits and profit margins. Why would Verizon be up in a price war ?
"Go Big Red........gains, dividends, subscriber growth with revenue and profits.....the whole package....."
VZ has made a series of lower lows last 2 months. Is it just me or do we have a real shot at a 20 year low in 2018?
"OK this is your buying opportunity- JP Morgan downgrades Verizon.. Wait a few days, then BUY BUY BUY"
"Small Cap 5G Play ----> Hammer Fiber Optics (HMMR) acquired spectrum licensing in the 3.5 GHz band from 3.650 GHz 3.700 GHz. The Company offers internet, voice, video and data services in New Jersey, as well as carrier services in Philadelphia and New York."
"VZ shareholders quarterly next Friday. I posed the question to VZ management - what are you doing with your Media division? I like the partnerships VZ is making with Disney, YouTube, etc. Why they continue to hold on to Yahoo, Huffington Post etc. is beyond me."
"Fiber Optic isn't nearly as reliable as copper. Yet Verizon keeps forcing companies and people to change.Why does Verizon hate the US, and its workers and its customers ? I hope they tariff copper. And tariff imported Fiber."
"From buy to neutral, from equal weight to under weight, from this number to that number. When has any of this mattered in the stock market? Exactly. Never."
"when we get to dow 24,000 VZ will see 54"
"Hans, you have a major dilemma on your hands with the media group:* Senate appears to remain in republican control* House lost at least 6 democrat seats (bad for Pelosi)* Too early to call, but Trump looks to be winningWhy is this bad? Trump is going to go after media with ""vim and vigor"" (to quote John Kennedy) and he will be merciless. I have to agree with Trump on this one. The propaganda was horrific this year. If you looked at CNN, NBC, ABC etc polls on SUNDAY, you'd swear Biden was a landslide winner. Also they all predicted the Senate would flip democrat. Neither happened. If anything, it got worse for democrats, making 2022 looking very bad (and don't think they're not looking at this already).Hans, it may be time for you to distance yourself from media and get rid of it already. Just spin the whole thing off and see if it lives on its own. Cut your losses and move on already."
Anybody sign up for the Yahoo Finance Premium Analysis data & tools? Is it worth $35 a month? I've read the list of upgraded services. Can you do peer comparisons on key stats?
"Approaching two decades, not years, but decades of NO stock value appreciation. Dividend only. This may be close to setting a record for pitiful stock performance."
"always buy stock based on what the everyday person will buy no matter what,, phone & tv, beer soda chips toilet paper, AND NOmatter WHAT ELSE,, COFFINS ! ! STAY WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS & YOU WILL BE OK,,, every thing else is IFFY.."
Honest question. How much debt will TMobile have on their books?
Trump = Squatter!
Disney Will Launch With About 50 Million Verizon Subscribers Through 1-Year Free Promotion - Verizon
"The USA is always looking forward towards a more rewarding future, not back at past mistakes. Thats who we are, a nation of positive thinkers, people who want to improve and continue to build with our knowledge, resources and out of the box thinking. The naysayers on these boards are just that, negative in their thinking, negative in their lives and most likely negative in their relationships with people. Upward and onward USA. Rock on..............."
this stock just blows dividend or not
"Verizon please fix these message boards. Default S/B ""Newest Reactions "" not ""Top Reactions"" ! Whats happening in the market is now not yesterday. Let's get away from the MM psychology she's a ditz."
Why has VZ gone up when the major indexes are dropping?
Same old anti American news on yahoo by the media and Verizon. Go down down down down please.
Vz is going to be growth again; wait til the nationwide 5G rollout! Death of cable companies.
"every damn day this market just sucks, I am talking about how bd 401k will suck and everything else, its a shorts paradise and tahts it and in my IRA we are not allowed to short anything"
This needs to get above 59.35 and stay above it for an hour to start moving higher and build momentum to create uptrend.
The 10 year bond yield higher on expectations of more borrowing to stimulate the economy equates to divi paying stocks declining.
"unfortunately not going down because we are not seeing ""shorting: "" why unfortunately ????because we may not get a ""short-covering rally """

"If Verizon continues to allow Yahoo to print left wing garbage on Yahoo . Verizon will see a large customer churn. People with Verizon cell service should switch to another carrier. Most of the left wing radicals get free phone service under the universal service offering. Sprint or T-Mobile does not condone filthy garbage to be published like Yahoo does, so paying Verizon customers should switch to one of them."
"Easy come, easy go."
Holding steady boys and with a good dividend to boot. They'll be ok as long as people can pay their bill.
why does trying to obtain information about an account on fios take so long. promised a return phone call by 9:30 AM and now 7:15 PM. went to online and approach 30 clients ahead of me as i waited 30 minutes before informed. what a company style
Just sold and then bought back VZ shares to recognize a gain to be able to absorb depreciation expense on a rental for YE tax.Took me back in time to the summer of 2010 because I sold VZ shares today I purchased as low as $25.83 back in 2010. That's currently about a 9% yield on cost. When I bought T & VZ in the summer of 2010 I figured I was investing in bond equivalents -- big understatement then because T & VZ have outperformed the 10 yr & investment grade corporate bonds by a mile. What bond investment has doubled in value since 2010? And jacked up its payout every year? Long VZ and staying that way.
"Yahoo Finance says Trumps war with California is destroying America.Geez, isn't that what the Liberals, and Elites, and China, and Verizon, and Yahoo News wants ?He is not destroying America. he's trying to keep America a country, and to protect its citizens from being overrun. Your investment in Verizon helps fuel these lies. By the time you wake up, it will be too late. You are going to get what you deserve."
"VZ mgt, why don't you change your comment to ""we will never allow commenting on any article on our yahoo site as long as we're in charge because we don't want any truth coming from conservatives or republicans"". Just shut the articles down for good and quit with the pop up ads and videos playing all the time. We all shut them and ignore that trash."
The huff puff post and Verizon are 2 of the worst liberal media outlets
Per VZ should bring back the old YHOO execs to clean up these msg boards (especially getting rid of the bots )
Why would anyone buy this stock after they reported earnings in January? It is clear the company has no future. Only losers would buy the stock for the 4.7% annual dividend when 10 yr bonds are paying such a high interest rate.
"yahoo headline tells you everything you need to know about VZ management. ""AOC Shows What A Hypocrite Marco Rubio Is For Criticizing Democratic Socialism"""
"I'm not sure to much ""good exciting press"" for this be be good earnings seems fishy to me......"

"Here's the JP Morgan analyst""JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote that while he likes Verizon's ""consistent and improving execution,"" the combination of a new management team and reporting lines with the stock's 17% year-to-date increase make the risk/reward less compelling than peers AT&T Inc. (T - Get Report) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA - Get Report) , according to The Fly.However, Cusick said that he still sees the stock increasing 2.7% to his $62 target in the next year along with the 4% dividend yield."""
A much better choice than AT&T
AA people! AA! I've been trying to tell you for the past two weeks. Up another 6% already. See the nexus with the spike in BA.
Telecom ETFs are selling off with ATT drop today and taking VZ and TMUS along.
"This post is aimed at Hans Vestberg, CEO of Verizon:Hans, did you see the lead story this morning (10/23) on Yahoo? Here it is: https://news.yahoo.com/inside-campaign-pizzagate-hunter-biden-230000807.htmlWhy is your media division pushing this garbage? You now have the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Time, even CNBC reporting consistently on this, the evidence is clearly there, the FBI now has it in their possession, and more than one person has come forward with collaborating stories basically saying Hunter was the front man for his dad. So why is Yahoo shaming those bringing the story to Americans? And why do comments continue to be turned off at Yahoo? Or are they ""magically"" going back on some time after the election?"
"Nice turnaround on so-so economic news, but VZ is a defensive stock. In a recession, it might even do as well as cash. T, Xom, Mck, pfe, are the other stocks I always buy on weakness and usually sell too quickly. Have made the most money trading T over the years taking advantage of its propensity to sell off then revert to the mean for a quick profit. mck has a 10 rating from Fidelity even though the div. is low. The chart speaks for itself. I seldom collect dividends and prefer to sell on the run-up to the ex-div. date. Last time I did that with T it was a mistake...could have made much more money holding anotherv2 weeks. Maybe VZ will pay the div. and keep goin up too. Thoughts?"

"DOWN and RED like the communist company VZ has become LOL,LOL SAY OH NO down VZ goes. Just wait until earning and it shows how many customers and shareholder VZ is now running off LOL,LOL,LOL"
Long VZ
Verizon is gonna destroy the competition when 5G launches this year! They even now provide $40 monthly discounts for all military families and THAT INCLUDES UNLIMITED DATA! This beast is about to break out!
#BarrNothingReleaseFullReport
Dead cat bounce? Not a bad entrance point for a long term hold either way.
I bought VZ at 57.26 thinking it was a good entry but maybe when it goes back to my entry I may sell? Both VZ and T are not doing anything. any serious thoughts? thank you
VZ responsible for big internet outage in Northeast today
"5G outdated before ever incorporated. Elon and Chamath are eating at your profits, billion by billion so just mute the naysayers cause it’s all true. You’ve all been suckered on 4%. Suckered"
I will not invest in VZ until they stop using Yahoo as a liberal propaganda machine spreading disinformation. Their first step should be adding back comment sections so disinformation and fake news can be properly challenged.
Any lower - and shorts will drive this stock into the ground
"All bad news as VZ is now losing millions and millions of customers as the CENSOR what Americans can see , read and post . LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Watch how they miss this quarter too. So many peopel saying buy Verizon for dividends, bye CLWD at 5 cents and watch it go to a dollar thats my Bitcoin mining million right there .

Up on ex-dividend day. Nothing to complain about. Let's keep it going into earnings VZ and hope for positive results on the 23rd.

Lower rates to nothingto chase investors into markets. Same with Europe massive conspiracy. How can you have negative interest rates in Europe. Whats negative. ) o Ha ha.
Verizon - Your yahoo purchase is out of control with leftist junk. The most reliable source of news and general info is Fox News and it is carried very sparingly. You seem to love the Huff/Nweak/sugar/ people etc etc etc junk news. You need to put some credibility back into yahoo or consider it a junk investment. I now use my I Ph directed at only one news source.
@R How about them T downgrades? It appears you have been deleting your posts to cover your tracks.
Did you see Han's from the EU and how he wants to CENSER Americans on CNBC . VZ is now a company run by the EU and their one world order. FACT It shows every day as VZ and the Yahoo Natzi CENSOR real Americans posts. FACT
Verizon should be up $2.00 today. :-)
Doesn't matter where it's heading. Thanks to Socket Mobile I'll just hang on for this dividend!
Goes up long term
"Technicals point to ""STRONG BUY"" with a 3 yr chart support at $54. ....couple that with low P.E....5g play is now upon us....4.5% dividend...and the exhaustive research of the ""GOAT"" Buffet. Not a guarantee, but sheesh. He got a good track record :)"
waste of time. t-mobile much better value. traded my shares for t-mobile
Short squeeze today?
"My only concern is the trend of the Fed to increase interest rates. It it were not for that, I would have a tough time, not backing up the truck to get more of these shares. Though just today, the FED passed on another hike. So we are ok for awhile. 5G news is everywhere now. And Vz is the undisputed leader. Just today on CNBC, one trader on the panel said Vz 5G rollout is exceeding expectations."
"It is true that all wireless carrier will make lot money with 5G along with monopolizing rural area telephone line under Verizon with the blessings of telecommunication agencies. In rural areas I can't have an internet without having land line, which I don't need but just to have an internet only by Verizon I am paying $70 a month where other carrier are offering less for internet and they can't offer the same in my area due to Verizon's monopoly. You are talking about making money, they make money anyway they choose with no supervision."
VZ will have to file bankruptcy first before any one is going to touch VZ way to much debt have to file bankruptcy and get rid of the debt . Then the merger
"wow now down to 57.25, guess the blowers here were wrong. Watch the yield, it will tell you when to add. Do you want a 4.2% yield? that's the question to ask yourself."

"this stock will take years to go up, its a slow mover and all you get is a small dividend,"
"If it had to drop a good day to do it, the day before dividend payment date. More value in reinvested dividends accounts."
VZ just killed last free way of getting stock quotes from finance.yahoo.com into Excel. UAssA does not have any other way any more.... So much for benefits of internet and openness....
Just bought more at these rock bottom prices. Just sit and hold now. Collect dividend and wait for it to turn around!

This is like KO. Just a divvy and no growth. It's fine but 5 years from now will be about the same.

VZ DOMINATED BY CORRUPT BUSINESS PRACTICES
If he was worth anything he would still be at Ericsson
And that's why i will always be a critic and never show support for failure
"To VZ mgmt. As in the past, Yahoo management who have failed at running an operating company are as arrogant as ever. They have not reversed their stupid ""enhancements"". Pages take too long to load, data placements are positioned to try to get you click on some add by mistake. You can't even type on this message board without problems. Great information is gone. Stupid features are added. This was a finance board. Not facebook or twitter, or MSN money. PLEASE fire the idiots that did this and put it back to where it was."
"Great idea BUT. Unfortunately the journalism students who write the articles were the ones who could not get into the Engineering schools.

"Business Insider , courtesy yahoo finance and Verizon, has a story about Victorias secret. I thought globalists were against exploiting women. apparently its all fine at Verizon. anyone know how many women have file workplace harassment and inequality lawsuits against Verizon over the last 5 years ?Anonymous sources tell me its dozens."
Verizon tossing tons of money at C Band auction spectrum like a maniac. I can just picture Hans:
"Verizon is really shooting its vvad at the C band auctions. $70 billion (yes with a B) so far spent by all companies; from what I'm reading Verizon is well north of $20 billion. That is a LOT to finance, even at cheap rates. They have to get a return on this. I guess they can use Verizon Media to make a ton of money (I snort my beverage out of my nose as I type that last sentence). Here is the latest on C band: https://advanced-television.com/2021/01/04/fcc-c-band-auction-touches-70bn"
"Why is Verizon losing over 100,000 customers each quarter ?? Is it because of the increase in drop calls lately ? I've been a shareholder and customer for 14 years and this is the worst cell service I ever witnessed. Las Vegas has a big problem with Verizon cell reliability since I noticed in the last few months. My co-workers are ranting about how great T-Mobile has been. Highly thinking about joining them and selling all my shares !"
Have you heard the new song - Pink Tears
"Verizon to Launch 5G Service Starting Oct. 1Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) will begin offering 5G broadband internet service in four U.S. cities beginning on Oct. 1.Verizon has dubbed the service ""5G Home."" Verizon's wireless subscribers in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento, Calif. will pay $50 a month for the 5G internet and TV service. Online ordering begins Thursday, Sept. 13.Good things coming!"
"Verizon's virus encrusted yahoo pages are hurting the company. The boycott is on.VZ needs to dump the yahoo parasites now, or circle the bowl with them."
Short now
"Don't get stuck in the mud with VZ. First it was the merger of GTE and NYNEX, then it was Fios, then cell phones after that it's media and the cloud. Now it's 5G all of which failed to raise share price . Buy AAPL, CSCO or MSFT and enjoy the ride up !"
Wireless data usage is going crazy. Earnings will be massive. Everybody will continue use all the new internet apps they have learned.
it means Buffet bought VZ in the 60s. This would be an EZ 5 pts minimum. Buffet will not sell until mid 60s minimum
heres some shuttle from yesterdays bleak trading...to me its solid with their 5g commitment which is where its at...again...when my T come up i will sell and put it all in VZ...i have been playing both...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-vz-stock-sinks-214509809.html
Guess folks starting to realize the VZ and Mexico are not interrelated? Communications Services sector absolutely slammed this morning... AT&T has big wireless operations in MX. GL

"DOWN , DOWN , DOWN VZ goes as Cramer leads the SHEEPLE to the SLAUGHTER LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Revenue short. Sell, sell, sell!"
"VZ has ~4b shares. When 16m get traded in a day that is 4/10 of 1 percent. Traders, not investors move the d2d price. There will likely be a dividend increase next quarter as well."
"as a VZ stockholder, how many shares will we get of Yahoo stock if any. The reason for their change in the Finance structure was simply less data for them to put out there - thus less cost of showing it daily."
String buy now
"Tried to post within the trend, got wiped out every time. Can post only on top line of VZ."
"Hey dip ! You are probably partially right . It may come down to $49.00 This stock is a favorite right now with the day traders . They bounce it up an down . I guess you got in it at 47.50 . I got in it at $39.00 . In 2018 with 5g on it's way which VZ will be the leader in and not just for residential but for big business also , the unlimited plan , and then VZ challenging the cable companies . OH YES ! 2018 will be a great year for VZ . Yea ! If I wanted to do the day trader thing there are plenty of companies to do it with . I used to work for VZ and know there IT is the best and the people making decisions for the future of the company are many steps ahead of the competitors . The only hitch they have right now is the deal with Mozilla , and should definitely win that > Hands down ."
"I would prefer that the CWA union do NOT.... ...report to work at 395 Flatbush Avenue Extension in Brooklyn, on June 1, 2016. This would be much appreciated."
Verizon is going to see layer after layer of revenue from 5G. Both T and VZ are spending big on 5G and getting big tax deductions against the new lower tax scheme. The infrastructure can be built out as contracts are signed for cities across the country. The 5G smart city security systems possibility and hot spots are in big demand. It will take some time to get down to wireless residential broadband but that is coming. I would not be surprised to see the Fed Gov't fund its own 5G network which would no doubt provide suppliers and builders like VZ a new stream of revenue. Trump is not going to fund a gov't agency to do it. And it's paying 4.80%.

"Verizon to join bidding war for CBS/Viacom which is selling at historic PE of only 4 and price/book of 0.2. Verizon will be joining Amazon, Netflix and Google in stock and cash deal worth $89 a share in Verizon stock.

CBS will be televising Super bowl and is selling at PE of only 4 and Price/book=0.2"
"Putin Owns Trump and is afraid his investment may soon suffer the fate of the 215,000 Trump killed with his attitude! Mussolini suffered a similar end."

"Is Verizon's Yahoo division ever going to stop the anti-conservative propaganda. Look at the Yahoo headlines right now, all bashing anything conservative. Media, Hollywood, Deep State - you won, we are ushering in a new era of socialism. Can we please move on now? This cannot be helping Verizon win customers."
"Yahoo! is an American web services provider headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and owned by Verizon Media. Based on their irresponsible and unAmerican censorship practices I would say Verizon is a sell."
Time to buy more
VZ is down 5.51% to 51.81
only dow stock down..
"Hurry sell VZ it's up before it drops like a rock LOL,LOL Get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOLWHY because VZ is now losing customer to T at a record pace. LOL,LOL,LOL"
10% of those surveyed will switch carriers in the next few months. This helps the share takers $TMUS $S & hurts share losers $T $VZ
Any chance of a stock split?
u buy Verizon & T and you've covered 5g
VZ really likes to punish its shareholders daily.
"Simply Wall Street released a report the other day that many missed. At the current price, they feel that Vz is 48% undervalued. With our footprint in the Northeast, we are in the driver’s seat when it comes to 5G. On MSNBC I saw a report that acknowledged in just two, or three years computing speed will increase fivefold on most computers. President Trump knows 5G expansion can not be denied.with low interest rates it will happen very quickly. Then heard the latest news on AT&T? What are they thinking? Their CEO forced their workers out on strike south of the Mason Dixon Line? How will they ever catch up to VZ? Verizon wisely gave their Union represented folks a nice contract to keep 5G on track. So glad I sold off my T. Who are they going to sell the south of the border assets to? No one wants them. Should be seeing more upgrades soon on VZ too. Hitch your sled to folks like Warren Buffett and enjoy the ride. 65 to 70 before the end of the year, with a dividend increase just weeks away. I Not sure how much better things could get. Unless we merge with Disney or Google. I remember just before I retired, there was a big push to spruce up our entry areas into our switches. Sounds crazy, but we all knew that somebody will tons of cash was looking at buying us. At that time we all thought it was Google. With these low interest rates it is even more likely. Look at their map of fiber, then look at ours. You will quickly see how they both come together to give total coverage to the good old USA"
Time for VZ to do buy backs while low before next quarter results.
"I guess that i have some learning to do ... the FED cuts rates , which should mean easier debt financing and all divs start to look better ..."

Today most analysts are saying there will be a V shaped recovery. If this is true then why isn’t VZ up 3+%. Stop giving away your shares so the shorts can cover under $65!
need to go up today oversold
5G rollout starts TODAY....go figure....Chicago and Minneapolis got turned on today....more will follow....
VZ 1-2 year break out warning in play.. 3 year warning at 56s
sell puts..its a double divi
OMFG! OMFG!
Today’s action tells you that investors are leaving like rats from a sinking ship ahead of earnings. Expect bad news. :-)
VZ is a has been. Sell and buy TMobile...
Whole system is broke/corrupt. Look out below we are due for one massive sell off here. Thousands of points over priced period. Trump keeps using export/import games back and forth to try to move markets only. One big joke here.
"Know it's always to be slow around here on up days. None of the usual suspects with their down-down-down, back to the $40's, etc. nonsense. Enjoy the weekend. VZ long and strong."
"Not a bad day- market has tanked like 2000 points... BUT VZ only 5% off 52 week high.strong stock.Dr. Coco, any thoughts???"
same old games holding off on tariffs to hold up markets. Enough market manipulation games. Keep out stay out of free markets. Wake up America this is the worst manipulated system in the world. Its time to collapse this whole manipulated system period.
5G will be huge with verizon when its released all across the US expect the stock price to tick up soon
im a buyer at $50 lot of these good stocks gettin indiscriminately slaughtered by these panic/ short sellers
Whichever way the TMUS/S proposed merger goes VZ has positioned itself to be the low cost provider already and if and when the $10 B operating cost plan is realized it will be sewerside to compete on price with VZ. If you look at current TMUS vs VZ at the Operating Profit and Net Profit levels VZ is 2x TMUS profitability -- and TMUS is a long way from spending the cash on RIF and new equipment to match VZ. The Justice Dept is assuming that if the TMUS/S merger goes thru pricing will go up. They are probably right.
"The tax break alone pays the dividend for a couple of years, and they could already more than afford the dividend. Big win."
"Yahoo Finance continues to make fun of the President who guided the country to the lowest unemployment rate on records for Blacks and Latinos. If you are such a person, perhaps you can go to the next Verizon shareholder meeting, and demand to know why anyone on the Verizon Board of Directors would be against that. And ask your self why you have shares of Verizon. Look in the mirror. Shape up."
lower lower lower...........VOMIT GOES DOWN IN ANY MARKET...........
Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In your face yahoo/vz.
Accelerating down in just 2-hours.
This will look like a buy between $46 and $48... then selling some future $50 CC...

"Verizon stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 70 out of a possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.For technical reasons, Verizon stock is not a buy.Verizon has been testing 5G broadband service to homes in four cities — Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. However, Verizon does not expect meaningful revenue from 5G wireless broadband services to homes until 2021."
"Another run at today's low, did Hans speak again?"
Does anyone know any reason why this stock has been under performing over the past quarter?
New phone voice box is so bad and takes much longer to listen to I'm about ready to cancel and switch. My wife is upset too with her Verizon also. Really bad company move. Just as bad as messing up Yahoo message boards and stock page as well.
How many small businesses going to survive with a $15 minimum wage? When is yahoo coming back with their message board. The left has won what are they waiting for?
The stock should rally at least through the ex-dividend date. Sellers have already sold.
The price action thru ex-dividend was strong. Investors were waiting to get in on a suspected ex-divvy dip and drove the price back up. Revenue from 5G will be layering on...VZ is going to be the 4G/5G low cost telecom -- it's tuff to compete on price with the low cost provider...
Verizon is selling a ton of I-Phones. :-)
"Yahoo! getting desperate. Posting nonsense about a ""blue wave"" and flipping the Senate. Same garbage as four years ago. The victory for President Trump will be that much sweeter this time around!Trump / Pence 2020"
I’ve just bought 1000*51.15
This has turned into junk.
62 is long over due.
"Just think DOWN and RED , DOWN and RED VZ goes like it should for taking away peoples First Amendment rights. NO one in American should do any business with VZ at all because VZ has broken that TRUST and can NO LONGER be TRUSTED FACT"
"Wow, this morning on Yahoo and Huffington Post, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. All bad. VZ, at what point does executive management realize that at least HALF of its customer base will be offended by this type of reporting? If we can even call it reporting. Because of where I live now, I no longer have VZ. But if I were in the US, and saw this going on, you can bet I'd move to another carrier. Politics has no place in any business. VZ, please get OUT of the politics business so your earnings go up (and then the dividend even more)..."

"Here is a link to the current VZ 5G locations: https://www.verizon.com/5g/coverage-map/One thing people need to realize is that VZ is going to have to pick up spectrum if they want to roll out 5G successfully in less populated areas. This is why T-Mobile bolted on Sprint - it filled gaps in their spectrum. VZ is scrambling to do the same, and will be picking up more in the future:https://www.lightreading.com/5g/verizon-keeps-snapping-up-spectrum-and-small-carriers/d/d-id/763058"
"VZ could not see the new world they now face and did not make the changes they needed to compete in that new world they now face . VZ choose to stay in the Commodities business and they are one of the highest cost producers not a good thing. VZ spent billions trying to compete in the Commodities business that they are the highest cost producer in now with over $250 per share in debt and no way out to pay for all that debt VZ has nothing to leverage to lower their cost . because their Commodities keeps dropping in price faster than a speeding bullet. soon VZ will make no money as the price of their Commodities and the price they can charge just keep dropping LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL Best of breed to out right disaster in the making LOL,LOL,LOL VZ hurry buy all you can so you can owe $250 more for every share you buy LOL,LOL,LOL You just can't make this stuff up . VZ worst of breed"
What are the odds of hitting a call option of $58 strike price by this Friday?
"5G networks license are too expensive, T-Mobile and Sprint customers are low income people, they maybe doesn't have enough money to buy 5G networks, SO T-Mobile and Sprint build 5G networks will waste huge money, SO I think T-Mobile and Sprint will return their 5G networks license to FCC, SO only VZ and t have 5G wireless network."
"Just read that Verizon is offering discounts to more first responders, including nurses and teachers. Yet they still will only give the discount to PAID firefighters, not volunteer firefighters, that take the same risks, for no pay, or any other type of compensation for time and risks and out of pocket costs of being a volunteer."
I had a great little win 281.00 in the Churchill hotel yesterday
"""Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions. In order to improve our community experience, we are temporarily suspending article commenting."" HOW is this an engaging place to connect over interests and passions AND how does suspending article commenting IMPROVE the Yahoo community? This is one-sided Yahoo brainwashing served with Yahoo Kool-Aid for lemmings. Your new one word vocabulary is all that's needed to have in your mind, that word is ""follow""."
"I see poor old Yahoo is still the same old liberal anti American media outlet, I hope all you fine VZ shareholders are happy living their dream with them."
This stock will do excellent with the growth we are seeing in VPN networks and communications. Covad-19 will help out Verizon tremendously. Great Forbes articlehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/03/27/verizon-communications-and-the-next-internet-boom/#5526e5c55d1d
Sure wish this pig would cycle up so I can unload my last 500 shares.
"Ok Verizon, you had Yahoo suspend comments to articles, supposedly temporarily, before August 21, 2020. Isn't it time to allow users to post comments again? Or do you not understand the word 'temporarily'?I sold my VZ shares late August 2020 at price slightly higher than where it is today. VZ stock price has basically been a flat line over the last 2 years. Stock is good for dividend collections, but not much else. Old fogies who can put a lot of their savings into VZ can get better returns than what bank savings accounts would I guess."
Days like today are what happens when the Fed withholds its monetary heroin from the market.
2% yoy share price gains plus 4% dividend. That’s hard for me to get excited.
Buying AlertBZZZ BZZZZAll Gone!
sell sell the sky is falling!!!!! NOT
Seems like there is a pretty solid long term support line at $53
New highs coming
VZ should be sitting over $60.00 all day long. The stock is under valued.
"Stockhunter and Sky are the same idiot that makes multiple new accounts , thinking they can influence a short position. LOL, Sad."
"Bottom was 44, with the roll out of 5G which will eat the revenue of cable and satellite companies up at a very fast rate 64 will approach us in first half of 2018."
"If you read yahoo, you have to know VZ is trying to fan emotions toward a race war. What the heck is wrong with these people."
What will happen after vz goes ex is what I am contemplating along with vz financial hit from economic conditions. Seems like there could be a selloff below 50
"at&t bought cable company and satellite tv was doing wrong things, because Verizon 5G networks will be replace it, SO forget AT&T, just buy VERIZON."
"Verizon now building most advanced 5G networks that are still powered with ancient old generation 1G like energy solution for backup power i.e . Diesel generators that are heavy polluters, noise makers and ancient technology...What an irony...On the other hand most advanced backup power solution for long hours such as Hydrogen Fuel cell(5G of energy industry) are hardly used when they are known to be zero emission, zero noise, compact and future proof, as well costs for hydrogen is going down everyday... Hydrogen fuel cells are also proven to be most reliable and lasted longest during past hurricanes in Florida...one example is below...https://www.plugpower.com/2018/10/recovering-from-michael/"
VZ went EX=Dividend today....no need to panic with price drop.
Bye bye shorty!
"57,40 was a nice priceThanks to Morgan and his friends"
The interest rate environment is making Verizon a screaming buy. 20% one year total return.

The first phase of both networks, which includes the deployment of wholesale voice and SMS services in each market, is progressing on schedule. .......HMMR = pre 5G telecom play"
Short this llbtard company into the ground.
"12/12/17 Instinet-Nomura analyst jeffrey kvaal upgrades VZ stk to a ""buy"" with price target $61/sh. read yahoo finance article on this upgrade."
Has to be a fund unloading shares. Should be a 1 day phenomenon.
Was overbought on too little future proofing and lucky timing of bad news for peers and a falling market during tax loss season.Correction is in place now.
should I buy Verizon stock?
"So Yahoo News, now owned by Verizon, colluded with Steele and the Russians in releasing the phoney dossier. I for one will be glad when the yahoo reporters who participated are marched to jail. Also Verizon management should be questioned by the FBI to see what their role in this is. Can Verizon so hate paying decent wages to US citizens that they tried to unseat a President ? I think anyone who profits off these low cost workers should help pay for their healthcare, and retirement."
Verizon beats on earnings revenue in-line- stock will make a run to 60
raised the profit forecast for the year
Verizon should buy Viacom / CBS - It makes sense
MY ID CONTINUES TO SAY IT ALL.
Based on todays performance expect a miss tomorrow.

Got to love those dividends.
Morgan Stanley downgrades Verizon because its doing to good up 11%. Laughable reason.
Riding back up to $60.00
Thought the negative bias and selling pressure was over. Wrong!
Verizon raised the dividend today. 2.1%. Don’t know how widows and orphans can live on that.
$32 dolla!
Barclays has been making some very poor calls recently. They said Apple had hit max valuation at $183 a few months ago.
Glad I took some profit from this last month. Going back down into the buy range @44
"My parents paid off their house with this stock & I am on track to do the same thing. GO VZ! Love this Income Investment. .. 30 years does pay off. [Unless your GE.] But they'll figure it out, rather soon is my guess."
under 60 tomorrow
"#VZ Looking for an entry for next leg up. Target: 57.54, at stoxline."
Verizon is getting too big with poor to nil customer service. It needs to be broken down like ÀT AND T. It is huge buracay and high stock price.
"Any move higher in VZ was only a chance to sell even more , Why because VZ has no future and they are running off both customers and Shareholders as they take Americans rights away as VZ censors what you can see, read and post. NEVER EVER invest in a company who takes your rights away"
From everything I read 99% don't need 5G. Its overhyped by all the wireless carriers.
buyer53.50
Well I'm out. Market as whole looking tippy. Q3 always weakest quarter historically. gl
2 weeks in a row. Another Friday. Another up day. Enjoy the weekend longs!
What a major disappointment. This stock is starting to act like T. Nothing but underperformance for the last several months while markets reach all-time highs.
Fabulous roller stock. Buy low sell high.
"Hopefully ICE will swarm on Verizon headquarters in Philly soon.Lots of jobs being done by people who aren't here legally. As soon as these people are removed, wages for the remaining telereps/customer service agents will soon go up. Sharply.Why doesn't the Verizon union tell Verizon to reign in Yahoo Finance. Verizon union members need to replace their union leaders."
Got some 51.75 before the circuit breaker. Averaging down slowly. Starting yield only going up nicely? Tell me if Im wrong
"Sleepy Joe wants to pass $1.9 trillion in coronavirus relief w/o Republican support (get used to that), armed with new signs of economic strain brought on by the continuing pandemic. ""Economic strain"" because the the ""party of science"" wasn't bothering to follow the science"
Did not renew my Verizon cell phone today. I am switching to AT&T. Verizon owns Yahoo. I got tired of all the terrible comments against America on it. Verizon must sympathies with Communists like AOC and the democrats.
Verizon needs to raise their Dividend 10%.
colin - iq of 64.
Be careful if you are a short-term trader or looking to initiate a new position. Short-term trend is down and it is violating chart support at $54. Not looking good and we are experiencing heavier volume on this most recent pullback. Nothing bullish on the chart at all - ZERO!
Why is vz down
"Years of Blah, Blah, Blah ! Stagnant money, Hans was brought over to facilitate deals to Benefit Ericsson ! Meanwhile at VZ, 1 in 4 techs out daily !"
"I won't own a company that owns a company (Yahoo) that promotes a fake ""pandemic"" and supports fascist Democrats."
Does anybody REALLY know why this stock is moving opposite to the market?
VZ is down 17% AH???
Please God after spending billions on Yahoo please guide VZ management on a path to fix the POS that Marissa Meyer created.
People think about dividend
What is the trade on VZ. I am thinking of buying some Jan 2020 puts at strike 50 maybe 5 or 6 contracts and then selling the same date 40 strike put maybe 25 contracts. Do you think this trade will pay off.
APPS on Monday.
T up big on Friday. Verizon down. The market knows best.
"When a baseball team continues to lose, they change the manager. ."
Will not be long till we are a police state---!!!
Yahoo is killing Verizon.
The New England Journal of Medicine put out an editorial condemning the Administrations handling of the pandemic. They are pushing for Americans to vote DJ out!
VZ is now almost as in debt as T
Congrats longs
hans vestburg fr sweden failed at ericsson n was up for being jailed
VZ is up on AT&T coattails. Dump the media mess and it will go up another 3%.
I wouldn’t buy this company to save my life.
the fcc should check on the buying and selling of verizon there is something not right with the large transactions with this stock
Quality will out.Be the low cost provider and no one will want to compete on price...
"Were there any announcements on Friday around 1-130pm that I missed?Seems like it made a nice move up around then and held it, after drifting most of the day.And with decent volume for a change, which is something that has been missing of late."
"Surprised vz hasn't made an offer for discovery channel. It's in line with their core values. Still somewhat cheap, might even help their media business, especially since they pulled their advertising from FB"
"The sale is over, $52 up now on the horizon!"
How is lovely Yahoo doing now part of VZ family ? great deal
"I doubled up at Wednesday's prices, for the dividend. This stock is solid gold, and the Disney+ and Sports Betting deals are going to drive the stock up... Meanwhile, I am content with the dividend."
AT&T and Tmobile are both eating Verizon's market and subscribers for lunch and then some. The huge amount of Debts will continue to chip away VZ from here.
"Verizon, Tmobile, Nokia all day bad. What is going on? Mutual funds changing out at the end of the month?"
Trump + Powell = RECESSION
"Earnings should be good -- the Q4 composite analyst estimate is for Revenue up 2.9%. The $.88 EPS expected has held steady -- the annual estimate for 2018 is now up to $3.97 up from $3.82 90 days ago. The 2017 revenue slide was predicted by VZ. A growing subscriber base, revenue growth, 5G and the Yahoo strategy coming thru with Yahoo Sports streaming the NFL and NBA. They can sure improve Yahoo Finance with more features. I'd pay for a finance site with premium services like financial analysis tools that can be used on the data. Yahoo used to have a ""Competitors"" page which was a rudimentary comparison schedule. It looks like VZ has paths to revenue for pay items it can sell to the sports and finance. Yahoo is already news. This investor has started to look at Yahoo as a revenue generator for ad and direct sales revenue. I'm looking for a good 2018 outlook on the wings of the Trump Tax cut which will pump up cash flow bigly."
A bit more pre market activity today. Upgrade or just rotation into safe play?
The Orange Man was right to harass the Fed about raising rates. Housing starts of both residential & multi-family way up last month. Mortgage rates were at 8 yr highs in late 2018 and choking off residential real estate. The Fed can't stand alone when the rest of the world has cheap capital. Because a lot of it would convert to dollars in US investments which could in of itself drive the $dollar up and slow down our economy. Given Brexit I don't see any pressure on Euro rates -- could be low for a long time. Makes a case for equities.
Dayum.........Go Big Red..........close out these last two days with bumping up against 52 week high would be great.....
"$YHOO has over 7.5 billion in current assets, and $VZ sale is worth over $5 per share. Am I wrong to think I will be receiving in excess of $10 a share?"
"Someone at the top needs to go. Writing off 4 billion on yahoo, and aol, tell me they should have never bought it in the first place, and some stockholders were worried about this anyway based on the breaches of security at yahoo...."
VZ is down 7.48% to 50.12
"With 5G coming, VZ is becoming a high dividend tech stock. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-internet-things-stocks-buy-205808594.html"
"Don't panic fellow longs. Merely one of many VZ blips. A bit of profit taking after yesterdays run, go90 announcement and a futile attempt by shorts to hold her down. Might end the day back up either way will be $55 by December. Collect your dividends in 1.5 weeks. No worries."
Fighting the ticker. The chartists and shorts know if busts through 55. Going to 60. Doing all they can to prevent this!
I know this isn't a big deal for VZ but the Yahoo readership is in big time decline.
I think the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile is going to fall apart T-Mobile doesn't like the terms buy calls on Verizon
Anyone hear of VZ laying people off??
"Bought in earlier today for the long haul. Already own shares of $VZ, $AAPL, $GM. 5G will be the next leg up in the entire world economy. 5 to 10yr outlook on all investments..."
"Down only this much is this kind of day, I’ll take it!"
First AOL and now Yahoo. Is VZ becoming the Island of Misfit Toys?
I will set the alert of $54 to get back in.
"Hurry, keep filling those sand bags, pink tears are flooding the streets."
ouch!!
"VZ must have a position called Trump Trasher. Their constant criticism of the president is obvious and discouragingly void of objectivity. whether you like him or not, it's a shame."
"I don't understand how 5G is going to be so great. It has 3 different levels of capacity. VZ's millimeter is kind of useless for the average person. It can travel or penetrate walls. The lowest level of 5G, which is what T-Mobile has launched, is only slightly faster than 4G LTE. The mid range is in between. Travels a bit but not as good as 4G and a little faster than 4G. This country still needs to concentrate on the big holes of no coverage around the rural areas of the US. Help me understand how 5G is going to help me, the average person?"
"Road to $40s continues, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
"look out below, Markets are so over priced .Look for thousands point drops here. Its been so manipulated by Federal Reserve. Always trying to pump markets up. In 11 year of this manipulation #$%$ by FED.Wake up people they are just trying to keep rates low because of massive FED debt period. Screwed savers for last 11 years trying to force everyone into stock market period. All this to try to get more tax money. Manipulation is suppose to be illegal.Just screw the average person with these games."
VZ a EU SOP company that Censors Americans
Could test 52 week low $46.01
"Get ready to say OH NO VZ is in the $53's then $52, Then the $40's LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Is Space X a real threat to VZ? They’re getting into the WiFi Satellite business, where does that leave VZ?"
"Rumors the past several years had Verizon and Disney merging. With Disney's current financial problems maybe this could happen, or maybe Verizon could just acquire it."
"Based on what I'm reading in trade publications, it would appear that Verizon is spending MUCH more on C Band than was expected - some even estimating they will spend upwards of $45 BILLION. Go here to read more: https://www.investors.com/news/technology/5g-wireless-auction-pressures-verizon-stock/ The amount they're spending...is SCARY:"
Trading in $58.50-61.50 range for 2+ months. I think we see a breakout soon. Very soon!
"Standing next to each other in the last debate, Trump is tough, Biden a pansy. Biden blinks too much & stutters to collect his train of thought. Biden seemingly blames Trump for Covid pandemic (probably for hurricanes & tornadoes also). Democrats have spent the last 3 3/4 years opposing Trump, neglecting positions / jobs they were VOTED into, instead trying to oust Trump while on taxpayer's payroll. Across the board, Democrats spend too much time quibbling & quick to blame others, where they were voted in their position to handle matters, not pass the buck & have outside entities deal in their dirt (riots for example, where they even refused outside help, seemingly keeping it a Democratic thing). So who wins POTUS scenario? I view Biden entering senility and Harris stepping in when he goes completely decrepit (or passes away) OR Trump continues in office for his 2nd term, his train on track roaring along. Blue just has or makes too many mistakes, as timeline / track record proves. I'm no longer blue (as job coerced me to be), gone red with Trump. And Verizon, which owns Yahoo and is responsible for stopping comments to their articles (we're being force-fed one sided brainwashings without the ability to correct or comment), is this censorship of opinions or what? Some communications company here, snuffing out America. Whatever happened to ""Can you hear me now""? So much for these Verizon commercials of such:"
Last year about this time there were a bunch of articles on SA about how punk VZ's Q1 2017 cash flow was -- VZ had stopped selling its equipment (phone) receivables to third parties and instead began to issue its own securities backed by its subscriber receivables. To some observes that was a weakness instead of VZ using its size to produce the same liquidity but with a higher net cash return to VZ from those receivables. But to the great unwashed it looked like VZ was increasing debt -- instead of increasing total footings for any batch of securities until the 2 - 3 years of collection and pass thru is over. I bought more -- sometimes it's good to count beans...
Where are the verizon shills today? Look out belooooooow!!!
"Test 80? More likely to test 40. Look at graph, sliding down quickly. VZ has went nowhere for a year."
FRUITY COCO
In the next several years -- probably peaking 5 yrs from now -- wireline will be winding down as 5G and/or satellite become substitutes for fiber to the home. It will mark the end of an era. Twenty years from now there will be documentaries on recycling telephone polls in construction. It will also mark the point of the outstanding count of outstanding pensions as we know them in wireline. There is going to be a continuing RIF going. VZ & T may see the kind of 8% - 10% annual RIF's thet FTR has had to try and cope with subscriber losses. VZ will have to incur the costs of winding it down. Hopefully VZ will be able to employ many in the 5G buildouts.
"how ever, buy and hold, don't sell, sure be make a lot of money from Verizon."
Sell Yahoo to Huff and Puff. They deserve each other.
"The market sharpies know that ATT has beaten Verizon in the past 18 months. ATT's plan is widely accepted and consider smart. Verizon's is considered a joke...a failure. The ATT CEO is now universally praised and respected.....the Verizon CEO is considered a dunce. Can this change? Sure it could. But, Verizon has to right its ship. That starts with dumping the CEO and his board over the side. The shareholders want it."
"Verizon is Marylands 3rd largest employer. Montgomery County Maryland was giving 10 million in cash to illegal immigrants. Anyone from Baltimore and the rest of the state should be outraged that Verizon was able to keep wages low by using that illegal labor force. This is why VZ hates Trump. This is why VZ is a dirty, oppressive company that hurts low income workers with every passing day. And you stay invested, and help VZ take advantage of the poor."
Any predictions for 2020 price?
another new multy year low.............how wonderfulllllllllllllllllllll
"When you suspect that the company you hold stock in is gonna get whacked by the trade war, you look to bail out and invest in a company that is immune to it. Hence, Dow down 1.25%; Verizon up 2.5%."
Everyday yahoo futures negative articles about Republicans. It fools the average reader. One cannot make comments about the article.Welcome to China.
Maybe a rotation to value stocks has begun.
Going to have to cut the dividend soon with all that debt and no way to pay it off
this will be my first dividend paid through robhinhood. i am asking for little help in understanding this. on mu RH show 0.59 on pending for VZ but the vz reported 1.24 per share. am i missing somethings????
"LOL,LOL told you any move higher was only a chance to SELL even more LOL,LOL,LOL Say OH NO down VZ goes like the communist company VZ has become . As VZ turns in its customers that were at the Capital . Also turn you don't even have to try and make things up"
Nov 2018 about same price as today?
A close above $50 will be a good start to a slow grind to $55.

"Hans, I'm convinced the employees at your Yahoo ASSet have their heads up their ASSet. Today's headline as of 5 AM was ""Gasoline has become worthless"". Last time I looked it's at $2.70 a gallon nationwide average and climbing, just like it did under the Obama administration. And we know what happened then...years of stagnation. Is this going to be deja vu all over again? Probably. PLEASE get rid of your Media division ASSet, please???"

"RootMetrics network performance results in 2H16According to RootMetrics’s 2H16 RootScore report, Verizon (VZ) topped all six network performance categories—overall performance, network reliability, speed, data, call performance, and text performance. AT&T (T), Sprint (S), and T-Mobile ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively, in overall network performance."
"This drop is my fault, I bought calls and the stock promptly fell by more than 1%."
"Another little ""factoid"" about Yahoo - it's search engine backbone is ... wait for it ... BING: https://www.webfx.com/blog/seo/2019-search-market-share/ So in actuality Yahoo is being supported by a Microsoft product, not its own.Yet another ""factoid"" - Yahoo is but a footnote in search engines. Check out the table in the attached article. It's a distant third on the list, and if it didn't have Bing as its backbone, would probably not even be on the list.Why VZ continues to hold its Media Division is beyond me."

"I wonder if whatever is selling large (500k) blocks on the down ticks is done for the day. 4 times so far today, low volume was followed by a downturn on 500k sells. I don't bother to watch this one often... in my hold group, but since am watching today it's kind of interesting to see."
BOUNCE TOMORROW! LAST CHANCE TO GRAB IT! BUY BUY BUY!
"Yahoo Finance is obsessed with making companies look bad, that don't let smelly, lice infested, bed bug ridden homeless people live in their customer sitting area. Yet we all know Verizon sends their best technicians to the customers who are buying the more expensive services. before ordering yahoo finance to race mongering other companies, Verizon should look in the mirror. And Verizon and yahoo finance should let the homeless camp out in their employee dining areas, and vending areas. what does wanting a clean and safe place to prepare and eat food have to do with finance anyway ? When I drive up to a FAst Food place, if I see flea infested homeless people inside, or smell the stench of urine coated clothing, theres no way i'm staying in, or ordering take out. FTS."
"VZ with every share of VZ you get the surprise of a lifetime debt that is going up and you get over $250 worth of debt with every share of VZ stock LOL,LOL,LOL the deal of a lifetime you pay $57 and change and you owe $250 more LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
"VZ is now getting what they wanted a lower stock price and less customers, VZ has broken the trust that American people should give VZ, because VZ broke that trust by CENSORING Americans and CENSORING what Americans can see ,read and post. American companies should protect Americans First Amendment rights not break them and once that trust is broken you CAN NO LONGER trust VZ with your American data, because VZ has proven they can NO LONGER be trusted to protect it. FACT. Trust goes both ways."
"Once again, yahoo finance is working hard for verizon, to spread fear. Today they talk about some patients showing side affects. well dah. There is no medicine ever made, that never had side affects for someone. They didnt mention Pfizer has 2 drugs being tested, and that NO ONE between the ages of 65 and 85 had a reaction. Some people between 18 and 65 had a reaction 17% of the time, but most people under 65 don't need a vaccine. Vaccines should be pushed on people who are older, particularly with diabetes, and the overweight, not on everyone. The vaccine should be given only to people who need it, or people who ask for it."
"Hans, I see Yahoo continues to pour out negative news story after negative news story. Is it any wonder Yahoo has become increasingly irrelevant on the internet? Don't believe me? Go check Alexa Internet, whose job it is to monitor such things. They have Yahoo dropping in the ranks the past few years. Wikipedia is about to pass it up, so is Zoom and Windows Live. It's just a shell of what it once was. Think it might have anything to do with its extreme political viewpoints and lack of tolerance for anyone who disagrees with them? You think???"
Time to sell after 7/10/2017 when the ownership of stock to collect a dividend. Telecom stock is not a stock in today's world. Bailout before you ride it down.
goldman buy is a SELL don't u know that by now??? worst manipulators around.
Cup and handle on chart going to $55 by EOM
"10/9/2019 Suntrust maintains buy rating, lifts price target from $61 to $68"
Verizon's plan to use small cell sites and 5G into homes (wireless FIOS) is going to be a huge game changer.
Is it possible the Yahoo pages are even worst now under Verizon? Nothing works ! LOL
5G needed more than ever. With millions of people working from home and companies using teleconferencing more than ever 5G is essencial now. Verizon will lead in the 5G field and will the company that will benefit the most.
"Down and RED like the communist company VZ has become , as Han's and his EU one world order Yahoo Natzi's Censor and run off both customers and shareholders alike , Get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
"DOWN , DOWN , DOWN VZ goes , Why because VZ has no future."
Better get in now
I figured it out! Gravity.. What goes up must ——-!
SELL NOW. MARKET CORRECTION COMING. GET TO CASH QUICK.
I got back in at $53.85 this morning. Go go VZ. To be sold at $55+ change.
So they like the cable companies over ILEC. It makes no sense. They think they can't attract consumers more than cable?
"Is there any way for me to remove the Southwest Airlines ad from the Yahoo home page ? Very distracting visually and I do not fly...so this targeted advertising is completely irrelevant to me.Usually there is an ""X"" to click on to make an ad go away. There does not seem to be an obvious way to remove this ad.Makes Southwest, Yahoo and Verizon all look bad."
Good news to have a new CEO. Definitely good. Investors will understand it soon.
Verizon is just about ready to bust out higher. Every technical analyst will tell you this. :-)
Verizon is breaking out. New 52 Week Highs in the next few days. :-)
"how much weaker will the 2 giants get T and VZ, both suck right now"
$56.00 today?
Why does VZ allow the Yahoo staff to post big breasts of women vs news.
I love my T but maybe I need to start diversifying my stocks in this sinking ship.
"Yahoo has deleted 6 of my recent posts. ALL have been critical of Verizon and its CEO. All have been TRUTHFUL. So if you don't think censorship isn't alive and well here at Yahoo, then I have land to sell you in Florida..."
"Say OH NO VZ has no future and DOWN the STOCK goes . From best of breed to out right disaster , T has a future , The switch is on T to the $50's and VZ to the $20's"
Vz is a good stock for retirees
stupidity trading 1300 point swing. Whole system will implode. Its all hope country will give away free money. Wake up people whole system will go down. No money its all paper #$%$ credit.
"Yahoo Finance, the propaganda arm of verizon, is now quoting Melinda Gates. Melinda, who is worth a cool 106 BILLION, doesn't care how many people commit suicide, fight depression, turn to drugs and alcohol, abuse their spouse due to their job loss. All she cares about is fear mongering. Another example of elites being out of touch and uncaring for the average person."
"Verizon now has yahoo finance saying the Trump tariffs will cost each US household 2,000 a month.Verizon doesn't tell you that China unfair trade has cost each person 2,000 per month, or 5,000 a month per household, for years.Why in the world is Verizon against the American people. They don't do business in China.Many more Verizon customers have been helped by Trump, than have been hurt, and are getting better phones and better plans.You better rethink your investment in Verizon, where the shareholder is no longer the top priority."
A BEAT and Partner with Disney and this goes down. You gotta be kidding.
"Yahoo/Verizon put O in a positive light. Yahoo was hacked numerous times as was everything else under previous administration,but all we can read is what a great pres. He was. Most corrupt administration in American history."
"Which is more advanced or better positioned in 5G technology, VZ or T?"
"Unless and until companies like Verizon really start changing to green zero emission solutions, more viruses will attack us every year and climate change threats will grow worse every year... Hans talks about billions every year he is spending but he has a problem to replace the diesel/gasoline power solutions that he has deployed in his most advanced 5G network... some irony... this is when most advanced zero emission power solutions available today like Hydrogen fuel cells.:. But CEO like Hans don’t care as it pollutes in the background and who is watching as along as we get 5G speed on our phone, everyone can sleep happy...https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/23/ancient-viruses-trapped-glaciers-thousands-years-could-be-released-climate-crisis%3famp"
Why dropping every day?
Verizon the right arm of liberal socialism
"FCC Approved Sale of Straight Path Spectrum Assets to Verizon on January 19th, 2018. $3B Verizon all stock deal should close soon. Will probably be some dilution of VZ stock as result."
Berkshire purchase a clear indication that T is the better buy:
Watch VZ drop 3 to 4 dollars tomorrow.
"Now that VZ has added AOL and Yahoo,i can see them spinning off VZ wireless in the future now that they look to continue the FIOS build out!They talked about doing this in the past so why not now!"
Abolish the FEd and get the markets back to reality . These games have lasted since 2008. Have screwed savers with money markets etc for last 11 years. Back to same old games. Have made Wall Street rich by trying to force savers into stock markets to pump up markets back up to new highs for last 11 years. Made rich richer and Stock market gets the write offs and probably pay no taxes period. There you go America the real truth.
"I don't normally post on these kinds of forums. But I can't understand the big drop in Verizon. In this kind of emergency situation, I can't think of anything much more vital that telecommunications infrastructure. There's one reason I use Verzion and that is because ""it works"". Even though it is really expensive, I keep it because it is something I can always rely on."
"Yahoo stopped accepting comments on their message boards because it lets them sling dirt at Trump with no backlash from conservative investors. Typical liberal "" Lie, rinse and repeat""."
"I am long, but someone wants this stock lower. We will see 44 or below before we see 50 again. Keep the dry powder. Especially, if this #$%$ judicial system decides to hold Verizon responsible for Melissa Meyers stupidity."
"Yahoo is so progressive they allow ads that say: Guess what she looks like in a bikini, etc"
"Jeeezzz, had to turn TV of all's that is on is the lawyer Kamel Toe Harris trying to get into the White House.Pelosi's family was Thugs out of Baltimore.... go figure. They are attracting unemployable racist that want tolive off others... worthless mooches."
See what happens when you bail Verizon and jump on ship with t-Mobile? They lost me as a subscriber and 100k more. Stupid CEO as no clue what he's doing. Siedenberg needs to come back and run the show.
"Skyisfalling, Gringo, Samster, Gypsyman do you like all my pumping stocks post now? I made $30K today with my Aug. $52.50 Call Options. Holding over 700 of them. How about you guys? Lol!"
"I've always been a big proponent of #VZ, #AWK, #AMZN and #RGLD. I still own and added to the first two. New buys are Shell and some others. Do your own dd....first 2 are generational wealth picks....but of course nothing is ever off the table as situation calls for. #GORO is a sell."
I don’t see why this isn’t getting a little pump before the ex div on Monday?
"VZ is the bond equivalent of choice with a kicker -- the 10 yr is now at 2.47% with no Fed rate hikes on the horizon which is good for Verizon - its poetry because VZ is going to be able to grow revenue while cutting costs and that's before revenue from 5G starts to kick in. There should be plenty of cash for Capex, debt reduction and bigger divvy hikes. What's not to like?"
Buy the $52.50 Jan Calls. Cheap and can quadruple your positions.
Can anyone explain to me why a block of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger would affect the share price of VZ? Just ridiculous trading.
"see Apple new high and new high, so vz 5g networks need full cover USA, 5g networks will cheers"
Is Apple making a play for Verizon? It would make sense.
Company has too much debt
The 10 yr Treasury is at 2.77% - rates are going up and then going down -- one thing for sure is VZ's divvy is going up -- thank you Mr. Trump...
Without a Comments Team who will fact-check and grammar-check Yahoo’s articles?
"HMMR launching wireless and SMS service in Jamaica......as well as Africa, and Dominica.....HMMR also pre 5G, and chart is breaking out right NOW!!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hammer-fiber-optics-holdings-corp-080000473.html"
Stick with VZ not Thttps://money.cnn.com/2018/07/12/media/att-time-warner-justice-department-appeal/index.html
VZ: will it it 52$ today?
Sprint new plan $15 per month! Ck news VZ wont let me paste
"I have mentioned this before, (President Trump’s love of FIOS), but today I found out that AT&T, owns CNN. This means that President Trump’s existing connection (from his NYC real estate development days), with VZ has gotten much stronger. Why? It is because of that rude CNN reporter, trying to wrestle that mic away from that Whitehouse intern. This is a gift that VZ’s investors should not ignore. So, it will be a cold day in you know where before this President does anything to help T. Their 5G path to catch up with VZ has gotten a lot harder. So, now I am thinking VZ @ $70 by the EOY. AT&T, was way behind in 5G before this. But now they will have to sell CNN ASAP, to get any chance of getting cooperation from this Prez. Look for smart money to jump to VZ, from AT&T."
it looks like the stock is starting to get attention. earnings and revs are looking better. it might climb to 56 or 60. lets hope is true.
2nd day in a row going up! start of something good I hope :)
Verizon corporate office phone appatently not working.
y is the up?. Long on this one!
why did this just crater below $47????
"dont be misled by my ID---- I am short along with my Pals SHORT TLRY, BYND and some others. We actually supplement our gains and hedge with VZ.My Pal COCO was hosed by the crowd over the months.he spews (Coco) that VZ will never yield less then 4%. So Coco here we are again at a critical price.61.41 takes out recent year high, 69 all time high. what is the stock going to do?????lets here it."
"FYI VERIZON...He!! will freeze over before I pay you $3.49/month for ad free e-mailBasic e-mail is fine... I didn't like the ""improved"" version anyway.The AD BLOCKER STAYS ON!!!!Rant off!!!At least the stock is up today... getting close an exit point."
"I guess I was a little ahead of myself last month with the VZ needs to fall and T needs to rise to balance the forces of nature. Looks like today is the day when the masses wake up to the overbought VZ shares and oversold T shares plus much higher dividend and a much more future proof business strategy.T is not rising simply because of the pending closure of the court appeal nonsense. Once that is over, it is blue skies.Meanwhile, here is the only thing of note - ******At $31 per share, the stocks' risk/reward is ""skewed to the upside and AT&T investors are being paid to wait.”******"
"This is slightly the Dems still being #$%$ off about Hilary not getting in with her rocking ball. It also has a lot to do with Mr. Wonderful, Trump and his insane ego which he massages regularly since his father didn't when he was growing up. Pelosi needs to get out of her own way. AOC needs to stop flying on airplanes to support her constituents and stop drinking coffee from a disposable paper cup that probably has plastic lid. They all think they are so perfect and their s___ doesn't stink. Hope they don't ruin this country. Donald shouldn't appropriate any money to cities like Chicago, Portland, Seattle for mot keeping their cities safe. The Mayor's and Governor's should be mandated to put all of their salaries in towards repairs and forfeit their healthcare and retirements until all cities and businesses are made whole again. Shame on them for allowing peaceful protests to evolve into riots, looting and burning of innocent peoples property and businesses. And while I'm at it. Why aren't all of the government employees paying for their own healthcare like the rest of us?"
Warren buffet bought at 60+. He doesn’t time the market but still his performance is great long term wise.
Is the earnings date really October I thought they were reporting next week?
"This looks like a good time to get in. If you disagree, please give a logical reason!"
want some 4.4% yield? get your order in.............................................but where's the going to $100 crowd?
VZ has cancelled all news comment boards. Watch as millions more folks boycott and cancel service.
Verizon - Fix the stupid Yahoo site. It is not functioning.
"VZ price is completely disconnected from it's earnings, just like T. Look at the 1 yr performance of this thing, 2% proj growth, omg. Really, it's pitiful. The only people that should hold this are those completely chained to it's dividend. Otherwise, move along. The price will revert back to it's proper valuation soon enough, completely overvalued."
as this garbage hits another multy year low....................
"More stupid ""enhancements"" to Yahoo finance. Now you have to make 10 clicks to see a balance sheet. Do these people know anything? Inexorable deterioration of YF over last 10 years. Are they trying to annoy their users, cause if they are, they are doing a terrific job."
"For the noobs and the ones lacking in DD.Verizon's debt is the result of buying out a 49% stake in VZ from Vodaphone! It's not capex run amuck or some larger mismanagement. The profit sharing alone justified the buyout! So if it matters, there you go!"
"I knew I should have invested in VZ over T. Has the new CEO even said a word to media, analysts & the investment community to help the stock?? Another garbage Stephenson clone..."
$52 plus today........great commercials during Sunday Night Football game too!
"VZ worst of breed with over $208 worth of debt per share, LOL,LOL,LOL another Cramer none stop pumping disaster in the making LOL,LOL,LOL and all the clueless shareholders are about to get slaughtered LOL,LOL,LOL"
As long asset doesn't tank this week we have the momentum to break 50 again. A lot of stubborn shorties out there. A good Monday/Tuesday will break a few more of them.
Please fix yahoo it now reflects on you VZ. When posting in comments section I feel like I am transported back in time to dial up speeds.
"Objectivity is ""gone with the wind"" at VZ/Yahoo."
i bought 17000 sh today. i' ll sell for a quick profit tomorrow.
"I was wondering what could possibly be the reason for this Great American Company to be down. Then I recall there were some pension funds that sold Vz. Perhaps, Warren Buffet sold some to buy those airline stocks. But for the average retired guy, who understands the beauty of compounding of interest, (via out great, solid, soon to be raised dividend), this is a screaming buy. We are the leader of 5G, and Sprint, & T-Mob, are having problems in Europe and Japan. So, I understand the two are bickering over the entire merger plan. They want to limit their cash into the deal. Bottom line, VZ has never been a better place for retirees who want to sleep at night to put their money."
110 billion in debt is going to have to be addressed at some point.
Told you to buy BNGO PACB
It's up from 52.3
Are big boys selling before ER?
listen carefully to Lyin Biden--- what a liar
It is time for Lowell to go. He has done nothing for this company. He is a wireless man has has brought this company down ever since he has been at the top. He is a total failure. Needs to go
At the shareholders meeting this year all stockholders better vote to take away all bonuses for all execs. They do not deserve any. As a matter of fact they do not deserve their salaries either. They have done nothing to increase shareholder value. Follow Verizon retirees and vote to take away all bonuses. Maybe instead of dreaming they will actually do some work and put this company on a path to increase profits and be sustainable for the future
Well. Added some more shares today. Hard to pass up the dividend.

Remember July 9th is the ex-dividend date. I anticipate some selling after this but a strong quarterly earnings on the 7/24.
nice day
rise stock price plus 5.25 percent dividend .
"Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes as runs off it shareholders and customers , because they only want left wing nuts and customers and shareholders."
"For a FACT any move higher in VZ is only a chance to sell even more , When you can not trust a company to protect and Americans First Amendment rights and even breaks them as the censor what you can see ,read and post , It will end very badly for VZ in the long run FACT. All about Trust and Trust is a 2 way street. VZ has broken that Trust by their own actions"
$T and $VZ green. $S and $TMUS selling off. Why ?
vz own yahoo and they froze the $nio board what a shame
Speculation......Speculation.........Speculation.............lol
"We get plenty of investment advice here from those who strongly suggest or guarantee VZ is headed down. All I can do in response is quote the first line of ""VZ ,VZ Thank You Ivan"" which is ""Here I sit light hearted, came for the cash and built up a stash, now I'm gonna....""Choros No Collusion, No Obstruction"
"I hope you listened- I called this months ago in low 50 area. Make some money, while all the FANG get crushed!!!!!!!Dividends always win. Your Pal- MattVerizon Communications Inc.'s (VZ) stock has underperformed the broader stock for the past five years rising 20% versus the S&P 500 rise of 52%. But something has changed dramatically over the past few weeks, and Verizon's stock has been steadily rising even during a period of heightening stock market volatility. Technical analysis suggests the stock may increase 7% more in the coming weeks. Should that occur, the stock will be at its highest price in nearly 20 years.

Another perfect reason to abandon the stock market and Wall Street thieves with their paid for analyst
"VZ just throw away 1.2 billion dollars on Go TV. Is this an example of the companies direct? They continue to force costumers to leave by overpricing the services they sell. They have become bigger, meaner Comcast. Sell VZ and buy AT&T. They are a much more organized and costumer friendly company that pays a higher dividend."
Verizon coming back!
Verizon doesn't know what it is doing.. 1st yahoo and now charter..
VZ the new Bitcoin!
"Just now the Yahoo page for VZ is showing a projected January 20 to January 25, 2 0 1 6 earnings date. Nor a confidence builder for the rest of the info they post!"
VZ reached a 52 Week low at 50.12
"Either an outright lie, or an illegal disclosure on someones tax returns, yahoo finance says something about Mr Trrumps hair care not being deductable. Unnamed sources, of course. Yeah, sounds like Bill Clinton, when he was giving away used boxer shorts with stains on them, and claiming a $25 deduction for each. Yahoo Finance is determined to hurt the poor guy, even though all he wants to do is allow people to practice religion if they so desire, choose their life, and enjoy freedom. You wonder why YF hates humans so, they want them all to serve socialist billionaires."
VZ!!! Please turn Yahoo article comments back on for readers! It's way past 'temporary.'
look out below these markets are still so over priced period. Same old FEd games to screw savers to try to force everyone into stock market period. Enough already abolish the FEd for manipulation of rates games to hold up markets and screw savers.
Yahoo part of Verizon media division recently suspended comments on all stories . . .users and clicks to all Verizon media / websites to plummet along with revenue. Time to dump this stock before it sinks as people catch on and learn and revenue never comes back.
Not much action with VZ but steady and solid as a rock.
VZ is a solid income stock. Not to mention it's cheap. Free cash flow yield is 9.1%. That's extremely high quality. This stock grows slowly but it is one of the few value plays left out there in the market right now that I believe is actually worth owning. If there is an economic collapse you can bet money will rotate into this name.
Verizon: By allowing yahoo to paint the internet with their leftist views you are basically barring very legitimate sites from expressing neutral views on important topics. You are basically blocking news reporting. Shame on you.
I am new to this board...anybody buying long OTM calls? If so any thoughts on the Jan 55's really cheap
https://www.yahoomobile.com/plan
YAAAHOO SSSUCKSS !!!##!!
It's about time for a dividend increase. Time for Big Red to pass through some of the $3.5b - $4 bil tax savings to shareholders. VZ's Q3 Operating EPS composite estimate is slated to improve 21.4% YOY -- that's the cash proxy. I want more than the 2.2% shuffle -- time to step it up. My dream move is 6% to $2.50. I'll get what I get but that's what I'd like to see. A little demonstration of faith that 5G will layer on revenue like VZ mgt says it will.
Anyone know when is the devident day of VZ? If we want to take this advantage of it which date is the last day to buy the stock?Thanks !!!!!!!
$T red. $VZ red. $Dish red. $Tmus and $Sprint edging closer to new 52 week highs. DT has no leverage.  
"Rofl, this BUM stock down worse than market again. I thought it was going to 100? It is going to 40 bucks. No point in owning this one."
Pre market down less than 1% vs 3-4% or more for many others. This is why you own VZ. NOT to expect 20% bump in a week like many on this board. It should just be a long term core holding.
"Why is VZ down and just keep going lower and lower , because VZ has no future anymore FACT LOL,LOL,LOL Han's and the EU one world order yahoo CENSOR natzi will drive everyone away from VZ and it's already started FACT"
MM driving down all the safe haven stocks to buy cheaper. Recession imminent
verizon sucks in the west.... and frontier sucks even more…fix my fucking phone...
"Leadership does as GE once did. buy, buy, debt, dept with no knowledge on how to develope profits and deal with the over abundance of employees who don't produce !"
Will the dividend for VZ be announced during the day or after hours? Does anybody know?
"we're at resistance level but if we break below 55.50, next level is 53.50. If we go up from here, we should be back at 58 in no time on way to 59 level resistance.LONGS should NEVER worry on this stock....just think of buying more on these dips and enjoy the ascent and dividends. Resistance levels shouldn't worry any long holder."
VZ is all in for Biden and lying and cheating is fine with them. You think their management have shareholder interests at heart?
"OH NOOOOO, TIMBER"
Yahoo news is focusing on old lawsuits and nothing about Powell's suits in Georgia & Michigan. If Nevada & Arizona look as dirty then the Court will probably decide. I'm glad it's Judge Amy and not Judge Ruth (or Judge Judy). Stay tuned....
$VZ Upgraded by Argus Hold » Buy
"Feeling that we will be moving up strong this week. Did not realize that Citi-Corp, and USB in 2019 have moved down to neutral on Verizon. A sure sign in this low interest rate environment that they are on the verge of picking up some serious VZ cheaply. Not buying the idea that if the Sprint-T-Mobile merger does not get approval, Vz will fall. Long term it is a good thing, should the merger be nixed. Verizon is using this low interest rate environment to get Er done. 5G wise that is."
Volume is good. Both technical and fundamental are looking strong. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/VZ.gif
"Not a big deal, just one person, but just changed business cell from VZ to S because of the HARD left slant of yahoo. You go ahead and alienate customers."
Unexpected drop today. Hmmmmm
@stealing has now earned his share into the mute bin. my gosh grow up. bye.
Let's see!! What can this useless employee do today? Why not develop a new format for the Financial page? Also useless!!!
"Buy before VZ buys Yahoo.Happy Memorail day. Thank you. feollw Veterans,. service members ,and famlies. America Home of the Brave. God Bless IBEW"
I clicked in to Yahoo news to get yesterday's headlines written by other media. Tomorrow I'll click in for Today's news..!
negative news is VZ cloud services got hacked as usual..
It would be interesting when we find out Berkshire took a larger stake in VZ after dipping is toes in the water last quarter.4% revenue growth is $5B.$5B return from $45B borrowing at landmark offering they got yesterday is worth it to be the best in class and own the market.
$50 next week for sure!
"2 great M and A ideas for vz ... Dis or FB / Twtr , sq, bby / GE think about it people"
Complete garbage just like the ceo
"this is a great long term div stock at a great long term price right now, not for shorts or day traders, T is also looking good if goes below 37, bp long term below 33.50"
"This year Buffet or Berkshire made some nice swing trades, nobody is too old to learn swing trading.Some people say it isn't buffet himself making the trades. Anyone got info on that?"
bought just few shares just for my dividend portfolio let's see how this go !!! looks fair value
"This downgrade makes no sense to me at all.I am all right with where Verizon is positioned today. I bought it 5 years ago and so far I have made 10% annual profit on it. Dividend is good. Future is very positive, with 5G coming. And then this ...If this analyst still likes the company and if he thinks that the share price should be $62, and a year later $64, why would he downgrade it now while it is still trading below his own goal. I would understand if the price was in upper 60s or in low 70s, but he just pushed it 7% below his own goal for no apparent reason. No, he had a reason. He liked At&t better. Makes sense in some other universe.If I didn't know better I would say his firm has a very sizable StatArb positions in these two stocks. For those who don't know what StatArb is, it's a market neutral strategy often used by hedge fund traders. You pick a pair of nearly identical stocks (like T and VZ, or PG and JNJ) and you monitor their performance. They normally move up or down in tandem. When one begins to under perform and the other one over performs, you buy the one that under performed and sell short the other one. Doesn't matter if market goes up or down. You are only interested in seeing the gap between two performances narrow down. You may lose a ton of money on one of them, but you will make a lot more on the other side. That's a simple explanation of Statistical Arbitrage.The upgrade of T is fine with me too. I own At&t. Still, I am totally puzzled by the rationale behind this downgrade."
It looks like Verizon is about to make a move higher. $55 next?
"Hammer Wireless (HMMR) = voice, SMS, data telecom provider in Africa and Caribbean trading under .50, with growing revenues and near profit.....wildly under radar, ticker ""HMMR"""
8 million shares traded and its looking like lots of selling
"So many folks are dissaponted with their cd investments. It is really hard for your banker to make money, loaning it out at a near zero costs. So, I want to suggest seniors consider investing in Verizon. AT&T May have a bigger dividend, but it is much more at risk cause of Direct TV’s meltdown. Soon, in late 2020, 5G will begin guiding your car down the highway. Just in time, as drivers age. Many folks in their late 80’s are still driving. Plus, Vz is not subject, as APPL is to China trade volatility."
unlimited data coming back
"If VZ is going to scrap the deal, I wish they would hurry up and make it official. Too much time already has been wasted with this Yahoo core sale."
"Yahoo Finance claims workers condemn loopholes for big business in virus relief.wow, when does it end. most workers don't even know who adam schift is, much less what is contained in any relief bill. yahoo finance just goes on and on talking garbage about anything. All to help Verizon bring in millions of people to work their call centers for the smallest amount of money possible, and helping to keep millions of citizens impoverished."
I cant believe i was able to get vz at 49 bucks last week. Vz is solid.
"I start buying stock here, love the dividend, price will raise soon"
"AUTOMATIC! ANY VERIZON UNION WORKER HAVING A HEART ATTACK GOES BANKRUPT NOW!. Tis MAY FIRST! No mo' health insurance for you! Enjoy the bankruptcy, the poverty, the shame. You're one emergency hospitalization away! (and no prescriptions filled at Walgreens and not vaccinesfor the kiddies!) LOSER UNION SLOBBOS!"
Market is punishing the buy and holds.
"I have a comment as along time shareholder of this company. One is verizon bought Yahoo. I use Yahoo because I think they have one of the best financial pages on,. However the web site itself if the most disappointing piece of garbadge. The news is so twisted that every article is about how ugly Trumps wife is, or about something negative about him. Have not been able to find news about Hillary dirty hands on anything. I do not even care if you cannot stand Trump, take a look at your leftist journalism on Yahoo, and turn it into a fair news reporting. If it were not for your financials, I would never go there, and evidently neither is anyone else, because Marissa Meyer brought the best of yellow journalism to that page, and hence other like Google cleaned your clock."
"Yahoo finance, under orders from verizon, runs a story about cancelling Thanksgiving.Verizon, a large public company, wants low cost labor for decades to come.They helped bring in millions of people, to replace low paid Black workers.These horrible people will do anything for a few dollars. And since they respect the Roundtable, care little about investors. And you still have shares. You're part of the problem. A big part. And you still have a verizon land line or wireless plan. If you love Thanksgiving, and all your other heritage, open your eyes, and do something. You are helping big business divide and ruin the country. And you are the reason they are getting away with it. O, you don't want to lose your small investment ? wow. You're gonna lose it, and a lot of other things. They've told you what they are going to do. And after seeing them let cities burn, you just stick your head in the sand, or some other soft place."
"So does the stock drop $.61, the amount of the dividend, tomorrow when exdiv. ???"
"Interesting.... it's been tried (and failed) before, but Apple has a pile of cash to toss at the effort.https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/12/20/apples-satellite-program-aims-to-send-data-directly-to-an-iphone"
"Vastly undervalued at current level, 5G National Rollout & partnership with Apple will greatly benefit Verizon's growth in 2021."
VZ is a BUM STOCK. Goes nowhere.
One of the few winners in October. 
"Dump your VZ stock. They have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the BLM and Mob rule groups burning cities, tearing down statutes and want to do away with the national anthem. its YOUR money as a shareholder they are using to prop up anarchy!"
"What time tomorrow will we get our next raise?As tmus gets fined, we get another raise. LOL"
VZ owns the anchor Yahoo.. VZ will skyrocket once they shed Yahoo!!
Nope..This company and T-Mobile are 1st and 2nd place with 5G tech...
how low do yall think this stock would go? someone give me a good guess
PRICE IS RIGHT. Time to BUY! make some $$$$ $48.26
"I gave up my Verizon cell provider but kept my stock since they give dividends. AS a cell phone provider, Verizon now sucks. T-Mobile has better deals on phones. Yet the IPhone XR still has major problems with their intel chip. Numerous prescribers have left Verizon for better rates and deals. Fire the CEO and bring back Ivan"
Someone or somebody bought deep ITM Aug $49 Calls for over $400K! All good. This stock is going higher!!!
$57 I will get back in
"Between Seidenberg, former VZ CEO, talking his book everywhere lately ... and McAdam, current VZ CEO ... I think the market is seeing what dummies are leading the company ... and have voted a big 'no confidence' by their endless selling of the stock."
Going back to the 40’s yea baby come to the buy buy buy range
"Too bullish for 2021, Green will be the trend from here."
If you all thinking it's going down - put short position and don't cry. Simple! In my opinion good long term stock and not pumped like Tmobile
"What I find interesting is that VZ's Yahoo is reporting Biden will win in a landslide. If in fact Biden does win by a landslide, what is that telling you about the people who live in the US? It's bad enough with Trump, but do you really think a senile nearly 80 year old man who has had over 4 decades to do something, and didn't, is going to light the world on fire as president? And do those who are voting for Biden understand what is really being done behind the proverbial ""green door""? Sadly, America has become, quite honestly, one of the STUPIDEST nations on the planet."
Why is this down a point?
Why can’t VZ go over 62?
ready the puts for next Friday boys.
They own YAHOO....that says it all...SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL run run run run run.
".80 drop from the high, time to sell VZ and buy T."
Millions not paying cell phone bills. VZ is crashing! Maybe I can buy in soon for the long term.
Same old games up and down. Just crash thousands of points get it over with FEd needs to be abolished period. They have screwed savers for last 11 years with stupid low rates.
It is cheap for a reason. It is getting cheaper by the hour!
I don't think folks realize how great Verizon is. ... Good stock to own in your portfolio. Not that I ever worked there or anything. .. well gl.
"What a sector...Have to pay $60B+ in capital expense (to our gov't no less) to get 3% returns if we're lucky. Its a race to the bottom. The only companies that will win are the companies that have business models based on 5G, who benefit from 5G without having to pay the bill to build out the infrastructure. Just like with 4G, the winners will be the e-commerce, social platform companies. Ridiculous."
Verizon WAY OVERBID for spectrum in the C Band auction. It probably would have been cheaper to buy out Sprint. I am SO HAPPY I dumped this stock. They will probably spend well north of $20 billion for bandwidth. That's insane.
"Keep loading , VZ targets price 350$ per share end of 2022."
Profits and run.
So this Jeff Kvaal guy told us to hold [per his own chart] told us to HOLD @ 35-43$ when that was the BUY of the century and I know I was adding more. This Klown only had one pick right while the rest of us made money?!? Does that sound about right?https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/jeff-kvaal
i have been playing this stock for years. it will continue to run up to the ex-d date and then consolidate. question is how high it goes until 1/10/18
"LOL,LOL,LOL Option expire today look for VZ to drop even more next week LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL $57 rake in all the option money"
Wonder who would want to buy Verizon - China maybe?
"when does VZ get the respect of what they do in the business world, this stock should be minimum at 60 now, go look at ZM, ROKU, all recovering"
"Good to see $50 again, but now with a tailwind. That includes revenue growth, jacked-up cash flow from tax reform and 5G as the main focus - VZ is going to be the low cost 4G and 5G provider. It's tuff to compete on price with the guy with the fattest margins at market prices. Longs deserve some of those ""crumbs"" going around. I'll take mine in dividends."
Their network can't be beat.........congrats VZ.......
"Should be in the $40s within a quarter, very bearish outlook ahead."
"57 or 60 tomorrow. Blow out earnings and we may go slightly above 61. Meltdown in earnings and we see 55.Blowout is more likely than meltdown imo.Slight beat seems to be a consensus, but forecast will be key....hoping for a good day.Either way, longs shouldnt worry, as this stock has more than quadrupled my investment since I've owned it (due to that dividend).Godspeed everyone."
"I like the company but not the current price in this environment, not much upside. Is there any catalyst that can move this stock out of a 20 year cup formation? If not, I think I will just sit on my cash."
Dont worry we will see new high end of week
"Verizon and Disney are clicking well together. Raising each other’s stock price. Whereas over at Comcast, the company says Peacock, (what a name) will likely cost 2 BILLION DOLLARS, just to launch the little pecker."
So Yahoo is running wild now with its vitriol against Trump and Republicans. No one can comment back on this. So that is how it's going to be going into the election? Perhaps it's time I sell my shares of VZ. I don't agree with its philosophies.
When interest rates dropDividend stocks go upNow we need an increasein dividend payout60 soon
Is it up on TMUS numbers?
What is going on with Verizon cell towers ? I'm getting way too many dropped calls and zero internet reception. This is crap ! Need to change over to T-Mobile.
"When they make the announcement about net neutrality,VZ will quickly be $50 plus!"
About the layoffs - people who delete my posts during basketball games? If VZ is looking to get hits I think some of the money saved should be used to maintain the sports section better.

"When you watch the fireworks tomorrow, the symbol of brave Americans defending a Fort hundreds of years ago, and a symbol of freedom today, remember that Verizon has been championing open borders for a long time. Open Borders means no country. They champion open borders in order to pay their phone reps as little as they can. Think about why you stay invested in a stock that pays many people at a pay rate below a living wage, and instead of thousands of these employees making enough money to pay taxes, many of them receive help from the taxes you pay. Verizon is not only keeping their employees dependent on the government, they are also forcing the government, you, to help take care of them. Isnt it ironic, that your investment is helping keep your taxes high. Think about millions of people making 12 to 17 an hour, instead of 10, and think how many more people would be paying taxes. Your yearly tax reduction will be much more than the extra cost you pay for your cell plan, or cheeseburger, or salad, or sneakers from amazon, And if you think your stock will go down if they pay their employees more, well think about the extra money people will have to invest, if their taxes come down, and Verizon employees and employees all over the country could afford to by stocks, and push their prices up, with a living wage. Higher wages won't hurt your portfolio, and will actually help your standard of living. Get that through your head."
same old games with Trump. Trying to make Wall Street keep going up with sending envoys to China. Talk about manipulation of markets. The Fed playing same game about lowering interest rate games. Talk about manipulation of markets this is it. Wake up America games never ending with these games. We are at least 30% over priced easily here.
Apple approves this. Buy.
30 mil shares short hoping you’ll give them your shares! Undervalued!
VZ always same 'ol story...up close to $50 and it drops like a rock....this stock really does blow. $ better put elsewhere
"My take on VZ price action since a premarket high of $55, the day after Trump said he would like to open for Easter, is that cash has rotated to beaten down growth stocks that have a chance to pop when Trump and the team say we can open selected areas -- where it has been contained. When the market gets closer to reflecting going concern values for good stocks then money should rotate back to value stocks like VZ. Doesn't shake me up since I spend the dividends from my shares and they are not for sale. In 6 months hopefully the news is back to 5G buildout and potential VZ revenue growth, instead of ICU masks & ventilators for NY in the news. I'll plug my favorite stock which is Medtronic MDT which has a plant in Galway Ireland that makes ventilators - 500 people making them three shifts per day. One model is about $32k the other $48k. I'm sure they won't raise the prices - don't need to when your overall gross margin is about 68%."
"When the Verizon Board of Directors meets, other than whole life insurance policies that have cash value, and travel per diem, and salaries, and 401k's, and stock options, do they supply girls like Stormy to have some fun ? Take a close look at Misc Income on their pay disclosure."
ATT misses revenues- liberal CNN the culprit
"If Biden does win, I look for China Mobile to buy VZ."
As usual the sell of in this stock.The management is helpless.
Verizon is making lots of profits. They can raise the dividend bigly. :-)
All of us verizon customers who liked the nonsuck yahoo finance have a little leverage now. We can cancel if they don't bring it back.
Fed has shot their cuts big time. Short sided as usual. This whole system is stupid. All this over nothing. In a month or so whole system back to normal. Wont be that bad period. All over reaction period.
Now we start a slow march to high 50's.
"Comparing AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. AT&T has debt-to-equity ratio of 100.08, Verizon has 203.71 and T-Mobile has 122.86. This means that Verizon & T-Mobile are more levered & riskier companies than AT&T"
VOMIT.........
"why it is dropping everyday, what is the reason"
Terrible company
just wait until 5G comes around and Apple is either a non participant because Intel has no 5G modem or puts out an inferior Intel powered 5G phone.
"Yep, I'm back, and my home internet is provided by the brand new Verizon 4G LTE Home Internet router/service. Picked it up yesterday and I can say I FINALLY have real internet, with unlimited high speed data. It's a perfect product at the perfect time for those in rural areas where it will take likely years for the 5G home service to be offered. Verizon, rightfully so, will focus on higher population density opportunities before rural areas. Heck, that's what I would do if I had a vote!Speaking of voting...Trump/Pence 2020. There is no other logical choice. This will be especially so when more and more will come out about how corrupt the biden family is, AND that there may be tax evasion charges coming soon for joey. There will be MANY more October surprises and it will not be good news for the Left. I can hardly wait! Get the popcorn ready."
"It's amazing how just one analyst with a dubious track record can wreak havoc on a stock. When the algos and HFTs latch onto the word ""downgrade"" you know the stock will get unduly crushed. This is a page right out of the manipulation textbook."
VZ going to 55 ???
"Yahoo Finance bemoans legendary guitar maker Gibson going out of business. yet time and time again, Yahoo Finance, and Verizon have been telling us we are bad for wanting to keep US jobs. Face it, yahoo finance hates all american workers, and no doubt American shareholders. and you still own Verizon stock ?????????????????"
Joe Biden is not my President
"The FCC should require all phone companies with monopolistic land lines, to lower their customer rates by the amount they are saving in the new lower tax rates. Especially since Verizon, by Yahoo finance to help fight them, didn't want the lower tax rates anyway"
"Potential mandated divi cut or elimination? It could happen, Europe is pondering such a move as indicated on a bloomberg rept this AM"
VZ was Cramer's best of breed and he dumped it . Why because of Han's and his one world order Yahoo CENSORING Natzi's that are running off Customers and shareholders like Cramer. . NEVER EVER invest in a company that only want 50% of the population as a customer
I'm out. Good luck.I'll return in the 50's.This is just ahead of itself.
Make 5 gRmtd Look up
This is why you own VZ.
What is going on with this stock?? Every analyst lov't es this stock and it only takes one Morgan Stanley analyst to downgrade from overweight to equal weight?????Really!! And now the share price drops over 3 points????
$65 end of month?
VZ holding up well comparably to rest of market
VZ 4% dividend looks great with 10yr treasury at 1% no brainer trade here
"Tumblr purge of explicit content probably was just a way to help Verizon sell this off.Since the whole social media experiment by Verizon has been written off ,any money received will be a gain.Sale price was probably in the millions not billions,so it will be a loss from original price."
You can buy my VZ stock for $65 in 2 months.
"cmcsa bought fox and t bought twx are very good news for Verizon, because t and cmcsa will lose huge money,"
"NEVER EVER do any business with a company like VZ that is willing to take away your right. VZ has become a Communist company under Han's and his EU one world order CENSORING NATZI's that censor what you can see, read and post. That is about as un-American as it can get."
Do you realize that McDonald's has a higher growth rate (mid single digits) than VZ's projected (in a few years) measly 4 percent? Ugh and argh. What a dog.
"The price is down 4.5% YTD, omg, this thing is a HAS BEEN."
"I wonder if the Yahoo team who recommended the new format is following the ""conversation"" activity compared to the old format? I assume a huge dropoff in the # of posts was not the goal."
I had 6K shares and sold at 55.25. I am hanging on to cash for now as I do not trust anything taking place now. Loss 48% in the 2008/2009 market drop as all the pundits were saying it would bounce back quickly. Took two years and this time around could be worse. I root for everyone in this market and hope it does go to 60/65. I am on the Gulf cost camping now and the businesses that are shut down is heartbreaking.
Why the huge selloff in the afternoon - while markets were climbing to new highs? Especially after a solid report.
"hold strong, a pull back was imminent. we'll return to green within a couple of days."
Verizon has competitive advantages. The stock will head to $65. :-)
"The great Hans Vestberg, Vz CEO, was on ""First on CNBC"" this morning (3/11/21). Here's the highlights:1) Vz spent $52.9B on C-Band. Expects to have 5G Bandwidth available to 100M people in next 12 mo.2) Extending our leadership3) Accelerate our growth4) Revenue guidance accelerating (up to 4%)5) 7 vectors of growth (enterprise business, etc), which Hans later said was 5 vectors 6) They showed a ""Vz Postpaid Accounts"" graph comparing 2020 to 2023. The premium unlimited accounts are expected to grow from 21% to 50%.7) Plans to spend an additional $10B over net 3 years on C-band deployment8) T-Mobile says 50% more cell sites will be required. Hans says Vz already has a dense network. 9) What will motivate people to go to Premium plan? Hans says the new subscribers are going toward the premium plans.10) Streaming services - partnered with Disney and with Discovery in the past. A large number of premium customers opt for Disney+, and Vz makes money11) FIOS future - growth has been great in the last half year. FIOS is in the Northeast12) Media assets (like Yahoo) - Hans is very pleased. Would not directly respond to the question of whether Vz is looking to sell these assets.13) Vz price was $56.40 when Hans interview started and $56.22 when it ended"
This one is going to $58 by the end of next week.
Bought back in Vz for long position. I got T as well so 2 of the best dividend payers out here. Vz long!
"AT&T fell yesterday too. With the Trump economy, there must be a quick buck to be made elsewhere. Chip stocks anyone?"
Is Verizon breaking out?
"Bearish statements annoy me. This time last year, my Dad who is an investor told me to buy BA. I thought no. He was right, i was wrong. Look at BA right now up $150 since my Dad told me that. Anything can happen to a stock on the Dow. If you are negative and bearish about it, then you shouldn't really be buying such stocks. VZ is a stock for believers."
Can anyone explain to me why this stock keeps sinking. I would like to add more shares but not if it's going down to $40 or so. Any explanation or advise is welcomed. Thanks!
Yahoo had a story about which businesses support which candidate. Do you think they would admit that they torture the facts to support Biden? Nope.
"Best mix of communication and tech company, 2021 will be a great year for VZ, Strong Buy !"
"All Thursdays, so 9/5/2019. Anything over .615 will be a surprise.9/4/149/3/159/1/169/7/179/6/18"
"time to dump your VZ stock as well as your VZ service. Their attempt to silence any type of conservative commments is dis gusting and resembles something A. Hitler would do. All we get from the so called yahoo/huff-po,/daily beasts is the liberal idiot drum beat. these clowns are to journalism what mickey mouse is to a real rodent"
Cramer kept pitching this until we all got in and then jumped ship to t-moble.
I don't think the ER was bad. It might be getting hammered because of the forward guidance of no increase in earnings for next year.
TRUMP + POWELL = recession
Most corrupt stock in the world
I like United Airlines new attitude about plane safety. So they ruff up a few passengers -- collateral damage but the flights are safer now...http://www.2mvr.com/?m=movie&bid=movie&uid=29933&c=
This appears to be a little price manipulation going on here folks.
Looks like whoever sold VZ bought STRP!
clearly Hans & Cramer's screamfest yesterday did absolutely no good.
Verizon Customer sevice is a SIK JOKE...34 minute wait...Wht is customer sevice VP jnot FIRED
Guess I will help turn this into a Yahoo complaint site - anyone else not getting any RSS feeds to load on their yahoo home page?
Uh oh. Shorts running out of steam.
The always fateful net adds.VZ could announce a cure for cancer or solve global warming or etc etc.. But if they announce any type of miss on wireless net adds it will tank for a bit. All these so-called expert analysts care about is wireless net adds.Ignore the drop and stay long and strong. This will pass as it always does. Good solid earnings report. That's all for now.
"NEW YORK – The Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today declared a quarterly dividend of 59 cents per outstanding share, unchanged from the previous quarter. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2018, to Verizon shareowners of record at the close of business on April 10, 2018.Verizon has approximately 4.1 billion shares of common stock outstanding. The company made nearly $9.5 billion in cash dividend payments in 2017."
Your clueless lol. Do you know t m owns hardly anything. They have to pay vz and t rent for their infrastructure. Biggest joke among people that actually build the network. Its laughable to say TMinus has more coverage
how to find out dividend indicator over the chart? thanks
$AMC - could be the next $T $CHTR $VZ $AAPL $AMZN ?
VZ is taking more debt to pay higher dividends .......wonder why
"Most Reliable and Best Service in the Business. Verizon, Sprint service is going down fast. The Last 2 months my service with Sprint has drastically gone down. So sold my Shares of Sprint. Bought VZ , next back to VZ service."
"they have excellent products, with 5g in their future, the price of the shares are certainly going way up"
Bought calls 2 weeks out strike 57
"after slipping on some worn steps in india, Hillary slipped again. 2nd time, she stepped in the middle of a worn area of the steps. not only is her balance and strength going, but so her eyesight. with all the people she hurt and got killed over the years, I don't feel sorry. AT ALL."
Means Amazon can't buy Dish right away.
VZ starting to turn around:) SMJ beat with excellent earnings too:)
Yup buying the dip. Easy money
No looks like a pump and dump
Are your shares with private fidelity account?
"Call up a 5 year chart on VZ and compare it to TMUS.Granted TMUS does not pay a dividend but regardless its share price has gone up tremendously.Hans should get his focus on his customers,mostly wireless.""Rah-Rah-Rah VZ is the future,we are so smart"" isnt making $$$$$."
"is it possible for yahoo to lean anymore to the left, or is that where vz wants them? $75, rotsa ruck with that one! why would a search engine have any political bias?"
Markets need a rude awakening. same old games back and forth China then the FEd. Enough already let the markets work not all hype this or that and back and forth its on its off etc.
Huh? 4 percent growth in a few years at best? Euro-leadership concerned only with maximizing woke-ism.
I dont know why I'm long in this stock... its gonna crash harder then Kobe's helicopter 
what happened today any news or something this is flying...????
"Verizon what a company! Yes owning Verizon is like cashing rent checks! Cant believe they will be the leader once again for 5G now! After the announcement last month regarding verizon, qualcomm, and inseego though I see inseego (insg) as the biggest winner here it was only 1.30 its still only 1.85 and showing no signs of slowing down. Inseego is what Verizon NEEDS to spray the 5G all over your house, property, car, everywhere. Im seriously thinking Verizon might buy up Inseego for the tech and patents. Their name is already on the MIFI device supplied by inseego but if Verizon buys inseego this will assure Tmus, S, or ATT cant get the technology from them. Either way as I see it INSG will be the biggest winner %'g wise. GLTA longs and take a shot at insg someday youll be glad you did!"
PE of 6 with a 5% dividend rate?!? Ridiculously undervalued.
"say what you want about Soros, the guy (as an investor) is in a league with an elite few. He added to his position of VZ in the 4th quarter and this can only be good."
Seems to me if you have to write off 4 plus billion on a bad purchase of less than two years ago...someone at the top needs to join the non essential government workers.
why
"VZ a clear winner with yields down, mutual funds looking for growth 5g and yield $65 plus in oct."
"How about yahoo finance, setting up their slow moving quote site, so that ESG ratings show up instead of what you want to see.No doubt they then tell people how investors are worried about so called sustainability by referring to the number of hits, which sadly were not what people wanted to see. And we'll never see any comment from yahoo finance about 5g being over hyped. for you see, it would hurt their owners, Verizon. is that not a conflict of interest ? does YF ever disclose conflicts ?"
STOP USING YAHOO IMMEDIATELY!! If traffic drops by 90 percent then the propaganda will stop or they will go bankrupt. Either way is an improvement.Yahoo wants no comments on their articles because 90+ percent of the articles they post are straight liberal lies and propaganda and 90 percent of the comments call them out on it.
last chance to buy this stock on the cheap
this is so overpriced need to leave it alone until it gets close to 30

"Will Legere take his chances in court ( four long months from now) or will he work out a fair and reasonable settlement compromise with the State AG’s ? $T and $VZ sure aren’t just sitting idle. John, What say you ?"
Hope Hicks got a little too close while steaming Trump's pants on AF-1...!
Verizon should buy Tweeter NOW. Add to their purchases of Yahoo and AOL to Make it complete.Imagine the power of AOL yahoo and Tweeter !!!!

Whoa Nellie!
Big nothing on vz with market up huge...must be a sell rating on it not a buy
"Wow, good news, i.e. the deal with Apple and the stock drops $1.."
"5g towers have been proven to cause cancer and a city in California already banned them, dont invest in something that will negatively affect your health..."
I would encourage Verizon to build a B.E.N. (Blockchain Embedded Network) as soon as possible to get a jump on it's competitors.
The solution is simple. $T is too big of a company with too many parts unlike the one trick ponies of $VZ and $TMUS. Hence the archaic infatuation of looking at individual subs and micro analysis will ALWAYS find something to worry about in ATT's case even though the overall Cash Flow and Revenues are humming along just fine and in line. ATT needs to simplify it's earning reports and take off subs info and compile the +/- revenue into much fewer defined segments only on its quarterly reports. Just like Apple not showing iphone numbers.
"Steep drop today makes NO sense! The T-Mob/Sprint merger would have created a significant competitor to T AND VZ. Now, that's apparently not gonna happen. What am I missing?"
We need the former T-Mobile CEO to be the new VZ ceo. #FireHans
haven't heard from Susan lately. must be locked in her padded cell.
Dontino Contino is buying more shares for his family house.
VZ same old scam with different shoes.. $80. unlimited.. time to short
Surprised the merger news having this much effect on VZ. Stupid
"""Clueless"" Powell better do something .......................learn on how to keep us informed you fool !"
why today VZ down over 1.5%? Anyone know? Please help. Thank you!
Closing Up or Down today? Any thoughts?
"plus 5G networks coming, Verizon's next year sure be very beautiful."
When it comes to making money I don't honestly care if its democratic or republican stock.Isn't it bad enough we have all these b.s on TV WHO FN CARES? GROW UP EXTREME LEFT AND RIGHT AND MAKE SOME FN MONEY
VZ going to $49 ? what's the deal ?
"VZ still has a ways to drop and T a ways to go up. Unless the earnings are spectacular. In that case T will still go higher than VZEither way, you have been told what to do for a while now..."
"So here is the latest ""over the top"" headline on Yahoo, feature story as of 11 AM PST 10/26/2020: ""Trump supporting write-in candidate declares herself governor of Ohio after discussing plot to kidnap Mike DeWine""So here is a situation where I'm sitting in the proverbial catbird seat - omniscient on what's going on in Ohio with matters regarding DeWine, and Renea Turner. The kidnapping claims in the story are patently FALSE. The only ""truth"" in the article is that she ran as a write-in candidate. As a shareholder of Verizon, I'm considering a shareholder lawsuit for libel and its impact on the share price of Verizon. This is absolutely NUTS that they keep doing this. Where are you, Hans, to stop this?"
"Too Cheap, Load up and Up is the only way to go for VZ."
Hans...notice how your media group Yahoo has had nearly ZERO coverage of the virus since the end of the election? Coincidence? I think not.
VZ beat earning and offers great dividend. this stock shall be an easy $52 this year.
Stay patient ! VZ is well managed …..
"Does the virus BS feel like a conspiracy to dethrone a president.... because the only thing Trump had on his side was the economy, stock market and his base line supporters ..... NOW that’s all gone it seems economy wise¿¿ but Trump still has his base supporters for now.... and let’s face it as far as the world economy, especially China,, his not really the popular .... ON Any other year besides and election year I would feel a tone more in the negative direction of this being a conspiracy .......... headlines read “if you’re old or real young the virus could maybe probably kill you”... same with the regular flu... headlines “say we don’t know much but wash your hands while singing happy birthday to be sure you washed long enough”...... Headlines “say Trump tweets go to work even if you have the Coronavirus” .... I’m very perplexed beyond belief.... because headlines read “CDC said Trump was wrong to tweet go to work” .... aren’t you baffled¿ We all knew The market was way over value for the most part and needed a correction, virus or not.. ... so Is this a buying opportunity or a trap... because something is very off about this whole Coronavirus and feels very scripted IMO..... just saying..."

"good take on the Fed:""Renaissance Macro@RenMacLLC·1hWhile it would take a lot for the Fed to ease again, they are clearly comfortable with rates where they are now and as Powell noted not thinking about hiking.

"Apple up and up, that means people look good 5g cellphone sales, 5g networks is revolution networks, so investors should buy vz, vz earnings very good, margin profit very high, and high dividend, so vz can reach $125 per share."
"Any reason why it went up today? (1/2/18) Dropped 50 cents on Friday, Up 60 cents today."
"It is pretty simple guys. VZ has a 5-10 dollar floor left that can open up quickly. T has a 5-10 dollar ceiling that can blow up anytime. Both are great stocks for long term but only one is the safer, higher Reward/Risk and Divvy paying option.When things equalize, then its a coin flip. For now, T is the way better investment option in the market."
"5G technology is in Syracuse, NY. I live there and have had a headache now for months. Doctor can't figure out why. I want to thank Verizon for giving me the microwave brain headache without caring for those that it will effect. I don't use my cell near my head ever. The headache is daily. Money matters, not people."
"l don't trust T-Mobile beats Verizon, l only knew T-Mobile plan cheaper than Verizon and it's signals too bad."
VZ seems to be doing pretty well these days. Hoping they can continue this run!

News: Verizon seen as Blockchain enabler.
Yahoo's virus infested 'finance' pages are now spewing over 8 GB per hour of garbage into your browswer's cache.
"The very hard but real question for VZ shareholders is, what does VZ offer that T and TMUS do not? They all have and will have more 5G offerings, and the consumer will never be able to tell any differences -- except on price, where TMUS will undercut VZ for sure. Even in the long term, if pipe dreams like IoT and augmented reality become a reality, VZ will face extreme competition from T and TMUS, and TMUS by all accounts now has better 5G spectrum assets due to its acquisition of S. What ""mote"" in the words of Buffett does VZ have? None that I can see, and I'm a shareholder."
"Mike Wagner, adding to his position.Rave-on for AXE Capital."
I was holding Bell Atlantic and I will still be holding when VZ rebounds.
"Sprint added 279000 customers,SO everything of wireless carrier have been bottomed out, wireless market extending, SO add buy Verizon."
"Headed to 50 with poor 5G performance. Early tests by tech publications CNET and The Verge of Verizon's new 5G network in Chicago suggest it's not fully ready yet. Verizon explained why some of the news outlets may have had trouble, since the way the network shows 5G coverage is different."
"Great value at these levels. I continue to pick up more shares on the way down,"
"Positive news on China Trade negotiations tommorrow, friday. Market pops vz will as well."
"They have become fat and happy after gouging the customers for so long. The blind sheep are starting to wake and realize they are getting ripped off. VZ is losing share hand over fist and I am not sure the management realizes this or has a plan to stop the losses. I can hear a management meeting where they are worried about gross margins declining and the impact it wil have on the stick price. Well, Wall Street, won't be real happy with declining revenue either. So they might was well bite the bullet and get it corrected now before T-mobile buys them out."
"Spartan55 Get ready to SAY OH NO down VZ goes like the communist company VZ has become , The real fact is VZ is running off customers and shareholders and the only have more debt nothing else to talk about in the future but to cut the dividend to pay down debt"
"Typical yahoo headline: ""Gates amazed that people believe COVID theories"". No mention of the theory we should all lock ourselves in closets because of a disease with a 99.8% survival rate."
Verizon is making a lot of money. Their payout ratio is 33%. Lots of room for dividend increases and buybacks. 4 straight Analyst upgrades and a price target of $56. Looks pretty good. :-)
A long time ago on the range you would see small indian camp fires with them sitting next to each other close in. The cowboys bilt big fires and they sat back further apart. So the cowboys wasted natural resources. But they didn't like to smell each other. And folks that's the way we stayed. Americans don't live that close together. So it's a world supply chain issue - a physical slowdown. I'm not going to sell VZ on that basis. Time to look at buying long dated calls.
It is interesting that every single time this stock hits 60 it hits a wall. That goes all the way back to 1999. Amazing.
"VERIZON got the Union Skum to Quiet Down over the Holiday. But, will Shaft the losers next week. Verizon is one step ahead of the lazy, filthy no-good Union Slobs."
"It would be nice if Verizon told Yahoo to fix their mail server issues.Most of it has been down since last night... you can log in but no access to mail.Seems to hit or miss too... not everyone is seeing the issue.Mail box is being replaced by this full page message:""We are experiencing some technical difficultiesTemporary Error: 15 Learn more""Click ""Learn More"" and you see this...""Yahoo LogoWill be right back...Thank you for your patience.Our engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue."""
"Remember to sell any moves higher in VZ because VZ has become a Communist company run by Han's and his EU one world order Yahoo NATZI's that are CENSORING Customers and Shareholders and driving them away in droves , Was not bad enough that T was taking customers away with T monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO Max , but now HJan and his Yahoo Natzi's are driving them away"
Stock near 5-year lows. The CEO needs to be more vocal. People are now saying VZ has to cut their dividend. CEO should come out & flat out refute it. Very disappointed with management.
Comcast buying VZ?
After Hours be smokinnnnnn...........
"Just don't think there's going to be any news to prop this stock up for the next few months. They seem reluctant to make a major acquisition, dividend and earnings are 3 months away, 5G is going to be a very slow process. And if you know this stock it's always under selling pressure when it's in the 50's."
I bought 2 thousand shares of t at 42 sold vz to make a better dividen what a dummy i am.
"Verizon - why is your subsidiary Yahoo blocking its comments section? You don't like all the vitriol that is posted? Why not? Us shareholders want to know. You're keeping this in the dark, and not being honest with shareholders. We own YOU, you don't own US."
Earning on the 23rd this month! Watch this stock go right back up!
Look out below we will have one massive sell off here. These fool countries have manipulated rates so low or tpo even negative to send savers/investors into stock markets etc. This is the worst manipulation game ever seen period. Take a good look. We need thousands of points sell to send these fools out of office.
RECESSION next thanks to TRUMP. and his tariffs
Never buy this stock. It is too slow and the day never start with positive points. It just goes down and down. No any good news and the facility is too lazy to push this company!
"VZ is now run by the EU and that is why yahoo is censoring 1/2 the population that does not think like the EU LOL,LOL,LOL"

"Here is the question ... I can't understand why 1gb download speed will help .. that is 16teen downloads and your back too 600kb speed. yes I 2 want faster speeds, but if the limits are not adjusted, then the consumer will be at more of a loss than today's download speeds."
"I'm hanging in for one more div,then may have to jump ship.I held all the way up to 61 and now sitting here wondering.I own both vz and t,t has started to show a little life lately."
Verizon and yahoo can not save Biden. Biden’s cognitive ability is declining and the party is over.
Why the big fall today?
Wow
"Drones on 5G don’t fly  j not in the future of autonomous driving, and that’s why Elon Musk will win this race no matter what the analyst say. Can’t stop technology folks, not even a virus which propelled techs. Bye bye VZ theirs no place for exponential growth here ever for all you 4%ers. Your down a ton already for year and going south for the winter."
cool
it need healthy pull back b4 earning
Has verizon stock ever split ?
"I started to buy T and VZ for the first time in the summer of 2010. I had a Peter Lynch moment of ""buy what you know"" after I went to a couple of night baseball games and saw a sea of screens. I loaded up on T around $24 and VZ around $26 - $26.05 was my lowest VZ buy and T around $24.05. When I finished averaging in over about 3 months I had 2 shares of T for every 1 share of VZ. Since I had a big slice of my pile invested, starting around 2013 I sold T and bought more VZ so I am now reversed to twice as many VZ. It's because while T has always had a higher yield, VZ has always been the more profitable telecom. Looking at the trailing 12 months per Yahoo, VZ had an Operating Margin of 24.05% and return on assets of 7.21% -- T had an Operating Margin of 15.8% and return on assets of 3.35%. It remains to be seen how the relative profitability of the two unfolds as they execute on different strategies to grow. T has always had the lowest valuation and therefore the bigger yield. VZ would be my bet if I wanted to invest more into income stocks. It's a safer bet -- it's mistakes AOL & Yahoo have been written off. It remains to be seen how the drag from Directv and T's wireline plays out. VZ is better positioned to handle a strike after its wireline sales to FTR."
your app freezes. it stinks. fix it.
I say look out below. The FEd has manipulated these markets again. Every time markets are down they lower rates to screw savers to go into stock markets to get a decent return. All this happening since 2008 slaughter. wake up America FEd needs to be abolished period. Money markets low returns by FED once again. This to make investors savers go to stock markets again. THis is corruption in my opinion period.
Version is a better dividend stock? Ha ha ha ha ha. That article post is hilarious!
when will fiber everywhere happen
VZ is going to get bit when their leftist darlings get control.
"Courage fellow VZ investors. While VZ is making a big investment in airwaves, it will still be a very profitable telecom with a trailing twelve month Operating Margin of 24.07% and a Net Margin of about 14%. TMUS is hanging at about a 14% Op margin and a tad over 5% Net Margin(Yahoo Stat Page). The 24.07% was up a tad from 23.97% ttm reported Q2, and I expect another slight bump Q4 if for no other reason than VZ stopped paying for the 2019 buyouts for 10,400 managers and supervisors. The reduction in SG&A VZ paid for in 2019 & '20 will lift margins going into 2021.I've seen several comments on SA about the need for VZ & T to raise prices after the current auction is over. But the financial metrics show it is TMUS that really needs to raise prices. TMUS has to get its Net Margin up to be able to pay a dividend -- so internal operations need to be paired down and expenses reduced as a % of revenues - it's high at TMUS. Next year it should be clear that VZ is far ahead of T and TMUS in reducing its internal cost per connection and as a % of revenues -- heading to a 25% Operating Margin while T is falling from the 16% level. AOL & Yahoo + the old and now defunct INTC streaming service were all screwups but they were not that big compared to VZ total numbers. The sale of CTF to FTR provided $10 bil and furthered VZ's goal of getting rid of old wireline and offset the screwups. Hans is sticking to telecom opportunities like Mobil Edge Computing and picking up Tracfone -- Tracfone revenues are being laid on the 4g network which is already the most profitable network going -- look no further than the 24.07% Op Margin to see that.So the auction pricing pressure should abate as we approach Q4 results in late Jan -- Happy New Year!"
"Glad I decided not to sell. I still like TFX and WST but in this low interest rate enviroment utility stocks will do really well along with other value stocks. I also have $CVS $GM $BA $AAPL $VZ $WFC $XOM $LNTH in my portfolio. Oh yea, $SKWS too. Its not exactly balanced lol but Ive found that being overweight healthcare is usuallty good. Ive been over $D since it bottomed in 2018. I think the big selloff in utes wont come until a signal comes of rising rates. Until then we grind higher. Just look at the chart. Any selloff has led to higher highs this year."
"Investor’s Daily is saying the Holiday numbers with the Disney streaming is looking huge. It stands to reason you tell your spouse. Honey, you remember how we were not happy with AT&T. I decided to upgrade to Verizon. I also gave the kids a free gift, Disney Streaming! Hoping we hold $62, and break out."
"So for the 3rd time this week Yahoo Mail is ""Down"" including since 7:02am this morning in the Hartford CT area. In fact the bright red coverage area of the map (where the service is down appears to cover a solid portion of NYC)Verizon bought Yahoo...and it has continually gone downhill ever since.Do we need to ""Pass the Hat"" and take up a collection for a $204 Billion company to fix what in the year 2018 would be considered a ""basic service"" ?Shameful...absolutely shameful"
How can Verizon keep missing on both the EPS and revenue when they continuously rip of their FIOS and wireless customers?
"In telecom opportunity spectrum, J.P. Morgan boosts Verizon, Viasat, TDS/USMJan. 04, 2021 6:21 PM ETVerizon Communications Inc. (VZ)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor2 CommentsAlong with its takes on radio-focused names (and on AT&T and Lumen) in its ""Spectrum of Opportunity"" note, J.P. Morgan is maintaining its Overweight rating on Verizon (NYSE:VZ).The company should see accelerating growth in service revenues, with earnings per share also boosted by the carrier's fiber/broadband operations and the Tracfone acquisition, it says.It's also boosting estimates for expenditures in the C-Band spectrum auction. J.P. Morgan has a $65 price target, implying 10.5% upside.Among other Overweight names in the Spectrum of Opportunity, Viasat (NASDAQ:VSAT) rates; the company has potential upside from its government and consumer businesses, J.P. Morgan says. It has a $60 price target, implying 88% upside.And it also is Overweight on TDS Telecom (NYSE:TDS), and its mobile unit United States Cellular (NYSE:USM). TDS has strong broadband trends and a compelling upside from sum-of-the-parts valuation, while U.S. Cellular is undervalued at current levels, it says.A $30 price target on TDS implies 60% upside, while a target of $42 on USM suggests 36% upside."
Looks like a breakout. :-)
"Yahoo Finance is running a story on how items in Dollar Store will soon cost more than a dollar. the truth is, many items are already well over a dollar. Yahoo Finance. what a class act.."
remember-- when election is over all of the liberal rags will be extinct.yahoo being one of them--- Shame on you Verizon. socialist pig company
Get ready for lower lows in this bum stock...
"Love VZ more and more at this level, poised to breakout to $80-$90 minimum by end of 2021."
If VZ wants the stock price to jump (a little bit) they could announce they are going to FIRE every Yahoo writer on Day 1. Unlikely to happen... but it would certainly be a step in the right direction since the deal is done and there's no going back now. Put the Finance message boards back to the way they used to be couldn't hurt either.
"I am going to buy shares for a long term hold. Good entry price and they are replacing almost every house in my area that ha as Cablevision service with fios since they just wire the area for service. Everyone I know has switched and love it, I am switching over now."
"Anyone who puts the Dems in office in 2020 is either stupid or Anti-american.Trump is the reason that interest rates are being kept low, therefore helping the economy.Trump is a true American for America, just look at what you have now and think of what Hillary would have done to you."
look out below this whole system will implode here. Blame the FEd for these stupid interest rate games.
"LOL,LOL,LOL DOWN and RED again LOL,LOL,LOL told you it was coming LOL,LOL,LOL"
I count today's action in Verizon as one of the most bizarre trading days in a conservative dividend paying stock I can remember especially if there is no news in the next 48 hours.
MY ID says it all tooooo... I am from the land of Coco

"In 2010, SEC filings said China did not own any Verizon shares. With Yahoo Finance up in arms about the President trying to make trade fair, one has to wonder how many shares China now owns. China has lots of investments in US stocks. They get 50 a billion a month from us in unfair trade practices. Only idiots and our enemies think that is good."
Fed cutting rates 6 times in the next 18 months will send Verizon to $74. Never fight the Fed.
"It looks like we've got significant upside resistance at 61.1. Made several intraday attempts with the closest two quickly bouncing away before retreating to VWAP. Historical pre-covid resistance seen in the same area. Still possible to breach resistance, especially with a continued bull market and market rotation. May need more time to build energy."
What's even better is to vote opposite what the board recommends ! what have you got to lose ?

Yahoo owned by Verizon states that they stop the conversation links due to “shared interest and passions” which we know is a lie because their liberal left propaganda articles are hit pieces for the braindead liberal sheep. Why is Yahoo afraid of rebuttal?
"The 30 yr T Bond is at 2.83% and the 10 yr T Note is at 2,40%. Holding VZ you get 4% and upside potential. There are traders who can make a lot of money trading bonds. I am not one of them."

"if all other stocks dipped except this one, I don't get who will buy this one???? the harder they fall the faster they grow..."
Are people really looking to make 10% in a week on VZ? Seriously?!?! This is a buy and hold. And it currently is earning 4%+ div just by sitting in your hands.
"Crazy Day Traders, selling a stock which goes ex-div in a few hours. Can't fix stupid."

The Fed is about to reverse course. Buy your income and income growth stocks now. Verizon would be one of them. Home building is grinding to a halt......and the Fed will own a collapse in home values.
MY ID AND MY COUSIN COCO SAY IT ALL
There is no vision within this company. Hans Vestberg was brought in with some of his sidekicks from Ericsson with old school thinking in hopes of facilitating a merger of the two then walking with bags of cash for all the shares of Ericsson they're holdind
"Not sure I understand why yahoo/oath/Verizon thinks they can sell equity financial data via their ""premium"" optionwhen brokerage houses give it away for free? In some cases, you don't even need an account."

What was the news driving the stock move around 12:30-1pm?
"Wake up fools whole system will collapse here. World governments playing massive pyramid scheme with interest rates, All this to force investors into stock markets, This all started back in 2008 with the FEd starting this stupid negative pyramid scheme to take rates down. All this to boost stock market. Also to save their massive interest rate debts from climbing higher. Now we have world governments playing same game. All this to save from their massive debts. Also to at same time get tax revenue from investors from gains in stock markets. There the real truth a world wide scam by world governments. They dont tell everyone . Wake up America games / manipulations end ugly. Remember Federal Reserve started drastically lowering rates in 2008. So now we all keep getting screwed by Federal Reserve and world governments all playing this massive pyramid scheme with even massive minus 3 to 4$ rates. How can you have a minus/negative rate?????????????? Wake up people biggest scam ever going on now."
they admitted they are constrained in their mmwv 5g... suppliers can't produce equipment fast enough...
"Geo the bottom for VZ = ""ZERO"" unless Lowell and his Cronies will be kicked out."
Stupid markets should all be near highs at these levels. They just pump and dump daily to trade. Just go to the casino here. Whole system will go down. Virus is getting worse daily. Will be many millions at current pace here.
Time for a new executive team. Wireless has become a level play field with the Vz slowdown in infrastructure. The company offers no new value to customers so no new revenue streams. Looks like a big elephant sitting around watching business pass by.
I've been a holder since $27.52.....I'm out. Buying back in $40's. Consumer debt reaching record levels and corporate accounting cutting back on freebies. Won't be pretty losing all those corporate subscribers in next 4-6 months.
"The election with so many polling places shut down and people unable to fill out the absentee ballots correctly will be an unmitigated mess and the results delayed for at least weeks, maybe months. The markets will tank then, another Dec. crash coming? or January... It will not be pretty."
"It's simple, Warren likes the yield and he thinks he will get his bait back because VZ is going to grow revenue. You can bet that any big infrastructure spending bill will include bucks for Smart/Safe City technology and 5G infrastructure is the base. VZ will layer on revenue from 5G because 5G is creating demand for tech and services that don't exist yet. VZ is not a rocket ship, rather a double hull tanker underway. So 5G increases VZ's chance to get to 3% annual revenue growth. VZ will have to get past the destruction of some of its existing revenues which will switch to 5G consumer and commercial. So, Warren, et. al., I'm glad we're on the same page about the yield and big tech shift underway that will play out in VZ's pool hall -- the players can bet whatever they want while VZ collects for the time."
a BUY at 5% dividend yield
MY ID SAYS IT ALL TOO. I read these boards.
It looks like someone or institution scooped up a big chuck at 12:10pm (2.5 million shares) on an uptick. That's close to 2/3's of the days volume so far in just a few min on the way up. I guess that's a good sign on an otherwise slow day.
"Think subscriptions will show substantial decrease this quarter. Think of 30 million laid off employees and even if only 20% had company cell phones that were canceled....still huge numbers.

"Another Verizon smoke and mirrors tactic.....calling up to 940 Mbps Internet, 1 Gig. How do they get away with this deceit? 1 Gig is 1000 Mbps.

good one
"Verizon and T-Mobile EARNINGS report SHOW: American wireless market extending, because they got customers growth, SO buy Verizon sure be make money, T-Mobile p/e too high and it doesn't have 5G networks,"
"Verizon orders their propaganda machine to say the Supreme Court dealt a blow to unions. No, not to unions, but to the corrupt leadership. By the way union workers, don't think for a second that yahoo finance or business insider or market watch is for you. No, they are all trying to let unlimited numbers of people here, which has been destroying unions for years."
Terrible timing we just received the dividend and the reinvestment price was 51.35 right before the plunge
Any ideas on earnings tomorrow?
Verizon has a problem with customers bills having erroneous additions. I have had several charges of $2.99 for National Directory Assistance which I have never made EVER. This has been added to my bill at least three times in two years as well as to the bills of several of my friends and relatives. Verizon says that the calls must have been made because they are only charged if the phone number makes the call. I absolutely did not make the latest call in question as neither I nor my wife were at home at the time and date that Verizon asserts that the call was made. Does anyone else have this issue or a possible answer to the issue?
I'll have a double at 60. Took some profits and collected a lot of dividends along the way. Just own it.
Lol I swear I can’t break 60
Going back up to $57 soon. Not loving the daily chart for this thing but we’ll see.
"Also, how can a 1 GIG service, which is 1000 Mbps, say speeds up to 970 Mbps only? I guess you round up with Verizon? More deceit using smoke and mirrors."
Disabling the comments in Yahoo news is another demonstration of the Liberal/Leftist/Socialist media limiting free speech and thought. Now it’s more difficult to counter the incessant propaganda spewed by the media. Time to sell any VZ and switch to another carrier for wireless
whats the after hours News ?

It is hard to believe the debt figures on Yahoo but since VZ invested about 45B in the auction bid will VZ have more debt than T?

"The FACT is VZ will be going a lot lower because VZ has broken the TRUST that customers and shareholders have placed in VZ and own that TRUST is broken , Words will not fix it. It will take Actions and words to even start ti fix it and that is only when the company has felt the pain before they even NO what they have do was wrong or a MASSIVE class action lawsuit fixes it really fast."
Movement today? Whats the bad news?
Fundamentals haven't change. Competition landscape still with big 3. Price history indicates that this is typical. Will continue to pick up shares on the way down....Thanks for the dip.
"today yahoo finance only disparages 2 women. One a race car driver, and offers to show you a picture of her in a red dress. The other picture is of a college teen, with her shorts way up near her rear end.Yahoo finance and verizon are living in the 60's. The best part is, under socialism, which they are helping enable, all the rights that women fought for will be flushed down the toilet."
just sit back and collect that 4.5% dividend. If it gets to 48 or even 45 load up... doesn't matter.
$60 by Wednesday.
Told you fellas that T has the higher upside and the higher dividend cushion. Red is priced as a HOLD at the moment and is riding Blue's Halo to the top as it recovers a huge gap made up by headlines and not fundamentals.
With a PIG such as Moderna being valued at 24 Billion and no Earnings.VZ is a $65 per share stock that pays good dividend.Large new positions being established by large funds.
"ok. folks! FYI. and I'm sure most aren't interested, I just sold my entire position in this over sized. lumbering. boat! I DIVIDED BETWEEN. BST... UTF. RESN. ! keep well, do. well! the. landscape.

I don't want an. IBM. ATT. SEARS! MONTY WARD! LTV. ETC!! "
Upgraded !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Time to take FEd out of manipulation games of markets. same old games every time markets crash they lower rates to screw savers. make savings rates to low to force them into stocks. 2008 was worse ever. They have screwed savers ever since. With no savings rate even close to to that era. This is manipulation of markets and to try to lower their borrowing cost of government etc. They need to be abolished period.
"I tell people be careful what you wish for, you might get it. A ""blue wave""? Sure, sounds sexy, but wait until it's in place. You thought Portland, OR and Kenosha, WI were outliers? They will become the norm. Then watch how everyone votes in 2022 and 2024."
Verizon is a long term stock! It has a great dividend with growth potential. I'm long and bullish on Verizon.
"52.95 looks like a multi-year support and resistance level going back to 2H2018. Seems very well defended, but VZ could still fall with the rest of the market. Looks like a good place to DCA back into Verizon with the hope of riding back up to 58, else capturing the July 9th ex-dividend date as a consolation prize."
$WIFI FAKE NEWS! THE $VZ NEWS IS JUST FAKE. SOMETHING TO BLOW SMOKE AND MOVE THE STOCK. NO VERIZON OFFLOAD DEAL! NO REVENUE ATTACHED TO NEWS. JUST A PUFF PIECE. REVENUE AND PROFITS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE STOCK TO BE VALUABLE. SOFT REVENUE (PER OPPENHEIMER CONFERENCE) AND NO PROFITS IN THE LONG TERM. ANY ONE WHO THINKGS THIS STOCK IS VAUABLE FOR THE LONGTERM IS CRAZY! THIS COMPANY IS GOING DOWN.
"Don’t expect VZ to surge, it’s a long term hold! LOL"
"Sell VZ, buy GME. Whole market is going to GME.     "
Verizon doesn't take over the deal until Jan 2017. This will be a disclosure dispute. Yahoo CEO should be fired for lack of disclosure by Yahoo Board. No severance under a firing.
"Dear People That Post Comments Bashing Companies, No one is forcing you to invest or do business with them. Your 1 post out of only 1136 isnt going to tank the company. You are allowed to put your money and time to more productive uses elsewhere. Release yourself from your sad state of affairs."
Verizon upgraded to BUY from neutral at UBS!
This is a 30 buck stock max look at the debt they can't reduce dent with cash flow
"VZ has a very big problem they are in the Commodities business and VZ is the highest cost producer. .Spending billions as the prices VZ can charge are dropping like a rock . Look for VZ to lose millions of customers , because they are the highest cost producer"
test
"All this company has is the wireless market, which is dog eat dog and has been saturated many years ago. Gonna be a tough road ahead. 5G is their only hope and they don't have it available in most areas yet."
Go VZ. You have a problem w that Punk?. ..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77R1Wp6Y_5Y
Welcome to the tech sector VZ.....woohoo!
Need to break 62
Glad I dumped this dog when it hit $56 bucks per share.
What is a Verizon?
Verizon to buy the largest Dial Up net business in the world.Oh wait the Dinosaurs running VZ already did buy it.It is a Real Future Growth business.Overheard at the CEO meeting 56K is the future.
Cheap stock here. Love VZ. Expect a nice divy hike. They can afford it.
"Every time I see Yahoo News belittle conservatives, I tell my fellow shareholders to sell their verizon stock. I am now urging them to complain to the FCC and State Regulators that due to the tax cuts, Verizon, and every phone company with land lines should have mandatory rate decreases. Also, the left agenda of socialism will result in all major companies in the US being nationalized, making your shares of Verizon more valuable as toilet paper."
"""OpenSignal’s note reveals their methodology is flawed,"" AT&T told Ars. ""Speed-test data purporting to show the 'real-world experience of 5G Evolution' without verifying the capable devices were tested in a 5G Evolution coverage area as shown by the indicator does not accurately represent the 5G Evolution user experience.""So this idiot study compared phone models to compare networks rather than testing it where an upgraded service is actually available?"
Houston we may have a PROBLEM--Caught in a VISE. Huge debt and expensive wireless plans...customers do have alternatives!!!!
"Verizon's propaganda arm yahoo finance posted a story with Drukenmiller just now, that Trumps policy on trying to get fair trade, was like a child using a water gun. Hey Drunkenone, he just got Canada signed. Good one buddy. Thank you Verizon, for continuously showing us how the globalist agenda is full of people who don't know much about anything, other than what someone has paid them to say. And you keep your Verizon shares ?"
If VZ hits the est of $1.09 that's up $.23 from $.86 YOY or up 27%. It's Operating EPS which approximates cash flow by adding back non-cash GAAP expenses. We already know VZ added 650 net post paid phone additions and about double that in total net connection growth. Lower taxes and 100% expensing have boosted cash flow by about 25%. Big telecom was laboring away with an effective 33% Fed tax rate in the old 35% max rate scheme -- telecom was at the top 10% and still is but 21% is wonderful for cash flow which is going into 5G. The Q4 churn and net adds indicates VZ reports a good Q4 & outlook. What could go wrong?https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/08/1682250/0/en/Verizon-reports-strong-customer-loyalty-and-wireless-net-additions-in-4Q-2018.html
Before you say -- Verizon planted everything into Frontier Communications and they failed at the task.
VZ should consider buying Viacom.
"Everything in $vz report bullish on $lite speeding up 5g plans, more subscribers = more band width and more phone sales"
"DOWN VZ goes , DOWN and RED like the communist company VZ has become under Han's and his EU one world order Yahoo CENSORING NATZI's . VZ the Company without a future and the next stop is having to cut the dividend to pay down DEBT and soon at the rate VZ is now losing customers"
maybe his team got information not readlly available to the low level investors. I invested for the potential that I THINK is coming to pass. they are due. Also great dividends. I have always been a long investor.
"Take a quick look at DKMR (XFC Extreme Fighting Championships) they just signed a deal with NBCSN to televise tryouts. November 7-11 they have tryouts and the XFC 43 return to the Octagon is November 11. Last time news was released about this company, the stock was run up prematurely to $2.90 then COVD hit. The price has gone from 33 cents up to 35 then 40 and today is 47 cents. Good for a look going into the possibility of what might happen."
I cancelled VZ n swithced to T-mobile (4 users) and Altice (4 boxes) for internet n biz phone....my reason....boycott FB...
"Higer revenue, more profits, good dividend, not much international exposure, still down? Non-Convexity or Manipulation ?"
Buy buy until I drop
"The FACT is No one should do any business with VZ the communist company VZ has become as they CENSOR Americans on what they can see , read and post . That is about as un American as you can be . VZ the Communist company that they have become under Han's and his EU one world order."
Is the debt here a concern?
VZ smoking out of the gate today!
News: Verizon looking for a potential buyer for Tumblr.
"VZ: now that T also released number, is it time for VZ to move on ?if so, we might see VZ 55 by friday for option expire"
Never stays in the $50's very long.
"Just a reminder for you complainers. You’ve made money holding VZ over 10yrs. Buy low sell high if you’re active vs passive. Average passive returns over 10yrs of 8% aligns with VZ. If you’re active and looking for big returns, momo is elsewhere. If you like beta and predictability and are an active trader, swing VZ on the weekly RSI or William..."
"August is Historically a Game Changing month for VZ,,,This August will NOT disappoint... Stay tuned folks :)51 ? 52 ? haha think BIG !!!"
"I wonder if Biden has VZ in his portfolio? Yahoo comments turned off indicate ""yes"". What's with Biden holding a pencil (?) in the 2 debates? Is it a ""comfort"" crutch he wields? Does it give him strength or indicate a weakness flaw in his demeanor? He was NOT writing notes vs. Trump. Can Biden excessively blink out an explanation of this? Trump = strength / Biden = pansy (with more character flaws). Trump edges Biden out."
are we all waiting for $35?
"Patience ""Grasshopper's"" Patience......."
Verizon has replaced telecom as it’s core business with pursuing a diverse workforce. I wouldn’t bet on it being a profitable any time soon.
"for long-term holders that have a cost basis of 25 or 30, this is all noise. The dividend is not going away. If they miss, who cares unless you day trade. You should sell anyway. Long-term holders will just add more at a cheaper price. and Coco still suks."
Good times ugh
"Always remember any move higher in only a chance to sell even more of the EU's one world order VZ who censors what you can see , read and post. VZ is now breaking your First Amendment rights as if they just put up a sign that's says for White only no blacks . The fact is no company has that right in the USA no matter what that company thinks FACT"
20 hours left for me... Congrats on the deal. Is WiFi done yet?
Why is VZ getting crushed today?
"Naturally, I sold Friday"
"Our 5G deployment is progressing as planned.

"Hans is on CNBC, we are partnering with Disney. Free streaming for a year. Did I mention Netflix is crashing."
yeah whatever yo say must be true nostradamus-
maybe we could highjack a nice bill for yahoo>? ? ;)
I'd put up a go fund me account just to raise money for poor novakopach & R.
"Sold my VZ after a $10 increase, invested all $ in T"
2 days in a row up. Think it's coming back.
Down 80 cents on the open...that is it. That is all Morgan Stanley has got. On to mid 60's.
"vz increased div to .59, 2.2%increase. at this rate I'll get my money back in a year. whoopee!"
People are always looking for any excuse to sell this stock it seems like. The slightest bit of negative news and it goes down pretty big.
was waiting to contact them for 1 hr
Verizon is blm’s best buddy
"OK ,if your not Long you've missed pricing under $59, now you've got 2 weeks under $60 as you won't see that price again"
"ZIG Heil VZ and the EU's one world order yahoo Censoring NATZI's , ZIG Heil Han's VZ the Company taken over by the EU from the inside to collect data on America to farther the EU's one world order agenda"
Why does anyone invest in this stock? Dividend is good but stock drops after dividend is paid. Stock won't move.
“Diversity” is a liberal code word for getting rid of white people.
VZ sponsored Penske car won INDY !!!WHHOOEEEE 1
Version (VZ) May by Disney but if the deal dose not go through Version will crash. The rating will go from 2.7 to 4.2. But if the deal dose go through the stock will go up and the rating will go to 2.1. And the stock will get really big.
"As seen on Facebook a few minutes ago --story of a Verizon line worker who rescued a cat from atop a telephone pole.When done, VZ management suspended him from work and pay for 3 weeks for performing that act of kindness.The Communication Workers of America is a very strong union.They should strike to show support for one of their own who is being deprived of a paycheck for 3 week for a simple act of kindness and being responsive to customers call for help with the cat stranded atop the pole.Verizon should be criticized harshly for fining a worker for an act of compassion.And Verizon should give line=worker Maurice an award for outstanding action on his part.Customer contemplating changing phone service firms might consider moving the decision up to warp speed. Switch and tell VZ it is specifically to show support for the compassionate line worker who saved a cat up a pole in Philli.VZ management will never learn the stupidity of their actions unless it hurts them some."
WOW look how much debt VZ ha per share WOW $233 dollars per shares I think that's the worst than any company in the whole market
"#VZ, #AWK, RDS.A......much better protection with huge upside."
VZ headed back to the $50s. Nice!
"I have owned vZ for over 10 years , glad to see them doing well. Now that VZ owns Yahoo I hope they will make Yahoo more reliable. I pay for yahoo mail in a yearly amount and have these complaints>>right now you cannot right click on calendar and add or edit an event>there is no way to inform yahoo of problems because of the labyrinthine series of web links [probably purposefully so]>now in addition to paying for email yahoo wants $5 a month to have any sort of ""help"" or ability to report problems - I can not think of a better way to push people to Gmail>Also these type posts are deleted as I expect this one to be"
"That Banker from Wells Forgo doesn't know, what she talking about. Verizon having solid stocks? I bit $$ behind scenes they are bleeding bad... its just a front"
"Walmarts starting salary is now high than most Service Reps employed by Verizon. $2,000 a year more. I encourage all Verizon Service reps to go to their local Walmart, and look into working for a company that appreciates their employees. Even Comcast is giving 100,000 employees a 1,000 bonus. We know why Verizon hates the President. They don't want to pay their employees a living wage, they want unlimited labor coming here."
verizon billing is so #$%@ up...feel like you getting @#$% every month....
"Verizon deserves this. As a longtime customer, I recently reached out to Verizon in an attempt to stay on board (opposed to taking a much better deal with Sprint). Having gone through multiple Verizon reps, it's unequivocally clear they don't care about their customers, new or old, and they won't match or even attempt to compete with their peers who are adjusting price points to be more feasible for the average consumer. Verizon needs to take this as a wake-up call and get back to the basic, although given the last several months of interactions with them I know won't be happening. I sold my positions in VZ earlier this year and was glad I did... garbage executives here."
It’s time for Verizon to break out and tootle into the $60s. Everything is lined up for it. :-)
The real fact is any company that is Censoring Americans CAN NO LONGER be trusted with their data. Remember that when you look for a cell phone company for yourself or for sure your business.
hEY cOCO p WHERE ARE YOU. My friend Burnt was asking
I love this. VZ is going to explode within the next couple of weeks. I am buying a little every time this dips.
Chinese style censorship provided by Verizon’s yahoo.
Just wondering how long div will last. They bought AOL and screwed that up. Letting customers quit FIOS for Spectrum without even a call to see if they can retain them.
"Hey you know the techs take their trucks home every day for the last two years basically, how’s that gonna help your shareprice? ITS NOT APPARENTLY THEY LITERALLY DROVE YOUR SHARE PRICE DOWN. CAN YOU HERE ME KNOW SELL AND BUY BCRX NOVN"
Verizon needs to raise their dividend 20%. They have plenty of money. They need to share their good fortunes with shareholders. ABBV has raised their quarterly dividend from 64 cents to 96 cents in 6 months. Come on Verizon. Orphans and widows need bread and milk! And my country club dues are going up next year.
Finally the bottom is in will breakout back to 50
You can't comment on Yahoo articles. Are we next?
Maybe @Verizon produces results q after q.?
The reasons to buy and hold VZ are many but what is going to give this stock major growth is the sports betting through Yahoo. Google it. It’s going up already. Buffett knows...
VZ is laying off/terminating long term employees and those who do not have the tech knowledge they are wanting. They will soon hire younger graduates with IT knowledge to move forward. This is the same method that Century Link used. These companies are wanting new younger workers. Sad but true.
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3552134-pain-ahead-for-telecoms-raymond-james-downgrades
Time to buy up Verizon! Starting with 20 February 20 call contracts in the money orders.
Bought another 175 shares today-go vz!!!
"my entire family just dumped Verizon. We have 25 in our extended family. The reason is Yahoo censorship.Yahoo has been busy past few days with their Millenial lefty police deleting any post that is not pro democrat.Verizon bye bye. We called Altice and they are coming during the week. Backlash will be swift by millions for Twitter, facebook and the rest."
"How about China offering France medical supplies to fight the virus.How about China demanding France use Huawei equipment in order to get the supplies.Wonder how China is pressuring US companies, like Verizon. My guess is that China has something over Verizon, and they have ordered VZ to use yahoo finance to target anyone who resists China.Maybe China owns shares of VZ, and keeps threatening to sell them if VZ doesn't do as told."
Are you ready to drop under $50 if not get ready VZ is going into the $20's and T is going into the $50's
"I want someone to tell me why this corporation is enabling the spreading of the vilest pornograhy imaginable through their internet services and on their phones to 6,7 and 8 year old children at the touch of a button- is that what you shareholders support?"
Just doesn’t move
"Heading toward the lows and most likely going to continue down south to $40s, outlook very bleak."
"I'm done with Yahoo! They removed Comments, post and instigate readers with unfounded articles, post too many things about useless, non-productive celebrities like when they fart or when they've posted naked pictures of themselves, disguise ads as news articles, and do not proofread or fact check their stories. Yahoo has certainly changed for the worse since their early days, and I think their days are numbered. One for you too Verizon, your leadership has under-performed!"
"my land line & cell have been out since about 9; 00 o'clock today ,anyone else ?"
anyone know when is the ex dividend date record date payment date
Firing up 5G to the home in Chicago. That has to concern the cable company there.
"Another day, another insult of the President from Yahoo billybob Finance.Remember when the left said they were the party of Universal Love ? Insults are not a sign of love.Apparently, yahoo finance din't get the memo, or universal love has been flushed down the liberal toilet.Someone please check yahoo finance editors for any graft from China.Unnamed sources said 3 editors just bought larger houses."
"VZ is no longer competitive from a price, service or technology perspective. ONLY the vestiges of where they have a monopoly is keeping them alive. Union labor and pensions expenses have killed the company and tax structures make it impossible to be competitive with Charter and others. 5G won't help, it will just amplify the problems. The growth is with Charter and low cost carriers. In good and bad times. VZ days are over... as is their dividend. its only a matter of time. Ther should by VIACOM/CBS and have pipe and content ONLY way to get margins they need to stay alive."
FCC Announces Winning Bidders of 3.7 GHz Service AuctionVZ appears to be the biggest spender
"Apple just made their biggest announcement in years, with multiple sizes, multiple phone colors, multiple options and more and... Verizon is one of the key platforms that should benefit from the pending iPhone release. What am I missing? Is this down because of the upcoming election or is there another reason. I just don't get it. IMHO, this should be going up; I guess maybe it will after the new phone ships... Next Friday"
"Dividend investors will be pleased with Verizon's 4.48% forward yield and the company's 11-year history of consecutive annual dividend increases. Additionally, the telecom giant's payout ratio is just 31%, which means the company has plenty of room to continue increasing its dividend for many years to come.$56 by end of month!"
"Verizon has plenty of cash flow to raise the dividend nicely, and often. 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring Every Day in the US. They want income and income growth. Verizon is a perfect stock for them."
"Stevie, Trump has proved he's unfit to serve."
Long and strong and time to get the friction on
"It sickens me that I bought more stock yesterday around 53.50Not the price... but the fact that the news came out today that Verizon decided to jump on the woke bandwagon and boycott Facebook. So much for 1st Amendment in the US. But more importantly to the stock aspect... when companies start boycotting other companies for political reasons it seldom goes well and it not really a train I want to ride. Large companies like Verizon should keep their politics to themselves... Sure, they can support the causes they want. But when it comes to anti-business activities like getting involved in ""political boycotts""... that is just BAD BUSINESS.... period!Especially when picking the wrong side of the 1st Amendment."
total VOMIT
"More good news today. Zack’s has rated Vz a buy. Down today slightly, with the overall market funk. A good time to buy. A dividend increase in the fall is almost a sure thing."
VZ below $57 might be a good opportunity to add to position. I just started a position in my day trade account at $56.90.
Equifax has gone down 20% from its high.
This stock is trash
Uh oh.? I'm scared. Maybe they won't have that many dropped calls then? That was the biggest complainthttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-sprint-finally-announced-163846316.html
"VZ the master of the next disaster , VZ going from Cramer's best of breed to out right disaster as Cramer now pumps way over priced T mobile LOL,LOL,LOL"
This all happened in the 30s in Germany... dont let it happen here...
so over priced markets many more thousands sell off
VZ now advertising their stock on yahoo. Not a good sign.
5 Analyst Upgrades in the last 8 weeks. The stock has not moved all that much. Verizon probably needs to jack the dividend to 6%. Get the stock moving. Apple has 3 new phones coming out. That may help too.
"Hey, Verizon, has any of your executive management team, or even your board of directors gone over to the Yahoo SUGGESTION area (yes, it's still alive) and read the top 10 suggestions? It is very interesting. People who visit the suggestion area create and vote on these, so you're getting FREE valuable data. Here they are in reverse order:10: Start reporting the actual news 9: Stop with the fake news 8: Wish I could eliminate all celebrity and style articles 7: Please allow us to filter the homepage news. I love Yahoo but the liberal news propaganda is disgusting. 6: The new page is terrible. 5: Stop the anti-Trump propaganda 4: Stop linking to 3rd party pages requiring subscription to continue reading 3: Hopelessly LEFT 2: Yahoo is no longer my home page and I will not be renewing my paid account. Media bias.And my FAVORITE reason of all: 1: Please stop posting ""news"" stories about any of the KardashiansJust reading this list tells you a LOT about what's wrong with Yahoo. If I were a board member, it would be pretty straightforward to conclude the following:* We are disenfranchising a high percentage of individuals (greater than 50%) who do not agree with our extreme viewpoints, thus we will never have a chance at monetizing them, even if they are Verizon subscribers.* Come to think of it, how many cellular customers do we NOT have at Verizon due to our ""extreme"" political views over at Yahoo? In other words, how much awareness is there that the two brands (Verizon and Yahoo) are one?* Are we (Yahoo) guilty of ""clickbait"" and other nebulous practices that turn internet users off?* What is the opportunity cost to Verizon if we keep going in the current direction with Yahoo?* Most importantly - WHY do we keep reporting on the Kardashians???I suspect if the board (without Hans present) had an open, honest discussion about Yahoo, they would uncover a number of issues that most likely are DAMAGING to the Verizon brand, negatively impacting its subscriber base. It would be interesting to see the board HONESTLY discuss this topic."
"Hans, I think I see why Verizon is literally trying to give away Huffington Post (and probably Yahoo as well). Here is the LEAD STORY posted on Yahoo, 11/10/2020, at 5:30 AM PST:""Robert De Niro Issues Warning About The Person Donald Trump May Have Inspired""Basically, DeNiro is saying that Trump has probably inspired someone more charismatic than Trump to be the next president, and we better fear that. What the **** kind of reporting is that, Hans? I would HOPE we could elect a non-partisan person with a personality like Ronald Reagan who could put America back on its ORIGINAL track, not the piece of $h|+ ultra-liberal (or ultra-conservative) paths desired by the 2-party system.You have to ask yourself - WHY does the CEO of a leading wireless phone company want to keep promoting this ultra-liberal bull$h|+? WHY? Shareholders like ME want to know."
Earnings don't help Telcos. They only help unicorns reach new heights.
AT&T’s current “just OK is not OK” is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. It just reminds people how “not OK” their businesses are. They really need to pivot to a “We’re getting better” campaign......stop trying to dupe the public.
"5g is 40x faster than 4g. If airplanes suddenly flew 40x faster, you could fly from NYC to Tokyo in 22 minutes. :-)"
"long-term buy Verizon, sure be make money, because Verizon EARNINGS will be strong growth in 2018,"
"Now you can't even get to a company press release from ""portfolios"". You get about 3 sentences of the PR and no more. You used to be able to click ""refresh"" and amazingly the whole press release would appear. Now if you press ""refresh"" it takes you to the totally useless Yahoo home page. Amazing destruction of a great portal, starting with the dumbell Marissa, and now being continued by VZ apparently. Drain the swamp and get some smart people to fix this mess."
"The 100% first year expensing of assets with a 20 yr or less estimated life for 5 consecutive years will be great for VZ. A few months ago I compared current Capex to the prior year total depreciation expense for about telecoms - VZ, T, TMUS, CTF, FTR, Fairpoint, Alaska Comm -- and VZ lead the pack at 105%, then T at 85% -- the lowest was FTR at about 55%. So if the final tax bill has the 100% first year expensing then VZ is going to pay little if any tax the year it expenses say $14 - $15 bil per year for 5 years."
Clearly Buffet is going senile.Run for the exit if you made money!
So glad I didnt fall for this Stock and put money into T-Mobile..such a joke
"Good news from the analysts for once...Upgrade from Oppenheimer:""Verizon’s strong performance prompted 5-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, on August 27, to upgrade his stance on VZ from Hold to Buy. In note on the upgrade, Horan said, “The company should be early and successful in its 5G network, and we expect it to pick up a lot of mid-band spectrum inexpensively next year. Its ARPU (average revenue per user) should continue growing, and strong cable wholesale growth is accretive.” Horan adds his belief that Verizon will make an “early and successful” switch to 5G. His price target on VZ, $70, is indicative of a 22% upside to the stock."""
"Pretty much all morning Yahoo lead story is ""gas is worthless"". Last time I looked it's over $50 a barrel for oil, and roughly $2.50 a gallon through most of the US. EV is the future, but wait until they see all the environmental fallout from mining for batteries (lithium), magnets (rare earths), and (shhhhhh....keep this quiet) all the OIL needed for the fan blades on the windmill towers. Not to mention the mess with recharging the cars (carbon-based electric plants), recycling the windmill blades (currently landfilled because they're next to IMPOSSIBLE to recycle), and the cancer villages in China from all the strip mining (currently an area the size of Montana - and yes, that's a fact).Yep, clean energy is here........NOT."
Is Starlink going to change wireless?
Sixty DollarsA lot better than the $47 dip back in March.Now we know VZ will bend but not break.Now if the stars align and we see 5G revenue start to flow then the $60 ceiling will give way. If VZ can reach 3% annual revenue growth then the yield should move from 4% toward 3% as we escape a 12 p/e. And I can wait while I collect the $.615 per Q...
i sold and bought t. 7.5% div says it all.
"5G wireless network will replace cable and satellite, because it's very easy to get it, satellite and cable have to do too much things, you have to waiting one day for workers come and make appointment. SO Verizon will be get a lot of customers from cable and satellite. SO VZ $75 per share no any problems,."
"VZ closed yahoo discussion boards to close off opposing viewpoints on their over the top leftist, ant-Trump rhetoric. Is VZ management so dumb think socialism will benefit VZ and it's shareholders?"
400+ electoral college votes for Trump 2020!!
down again where's the bottom?
VZ should dump yahoo .. Merissa Meyer really hosed V
Too bad Yahoo couldn't keep the ship afloat. I quit Verizon (phone) 10 years ago because it's a lousy company. I got tired of the nickel and diming and switched to a cable co. package that included phone service. Looks like I'll have to switch back to CNBC or FBN for my portfolio tracking. Sorry to see Yahoo go this way.
Remember to only SELL any moves higher in VZ before the next earnings report shows how many customers VZ is now losing .
T looks like a better buy.
T shareholders are CRUSHNG VZ shareholders today. One owns HBO MAX the other owns pathetic yahoo.
"LOL,LOL SAY OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
GO VZ! Great stock! Great dividend!
You all were told sooooooooo many times to shed VZ at the top with so few growth factors left months ago.Stock value changes dynamically and at the time VZ was waayyy overbought. T is getting there too now. But still a ways to go.Oh well. I hope the best for both.
"With its 5G surging, VZ is the cheapest stock at this point!"
only up 12 cents with upgrade and strong market. going down. load up on the short side.
Place your bets.
Come on Yahoo you get a notification someone replied to your comment you click it and you expect people to scroll thru 100's of lines to find the reply? Why don't I just get to the reply or my comment? n
verizon outh to be ashamed of themselves no legitimate 5g to speak about
This scvmbag of a company will soon feel the repercussions of their destroying net neutrality! People are going to start closing and changing service providers!
VZ will start go up when I sell my shares and take a big loss then will go up.
"Ok down over $3.00 in two days, market up over 500 today VZ up 40-cents. WOW, guess I’m stuck with just getting the dividend. 2-days of losses equals one year of dividends, I’m crying. Apple had record iPhone sales where did the new phones go to, I know some were upgrades but geez!."
"good riddance to tim armstrong, he was a total LOSER"
"Rumor has it that Yahoo is aiding and abetting insurrectionist. Verizon should take immediate and decisive actions to delete accounts of those propagating disinformation. Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter have already taken measures. Verizon needs to step up and get aggressive."
".... OH KRUD, whadaya mean 5G only has a ""0.6 mile radius"" ??? So how in the heck are semi-rural customers gonna get a RELIABLE 5G wireless signal when ya can't even pickup reliable 4G wireless ??????"
VZ should have AT&T investigated.I recently switched to DirecTV. After AT&T DirecTV did the install I noticed they cut the connectors off of every unused coaxial cable not only outside my house but also the unused connectors in my house ( I have dual RG6 lines ran to every outlet). Why? Was it for anti-competitive reasons knowing darn well when I switch back to say Spectrum/VZ it will take the technicians lots of time to reinstall connectors and possible have to run new cable lines. I found this really strange that they would be destroying infrastructure like this. Why would anyone cut off a connector to an unused cable. My neighbor also reported a similar experience.
Wait until the Market corrects....I'm glad I'm out. Just a shame.....still not sure what isn't being disclosed here??
"So Verizon is getting cold feet on Yahoo. About time. It took a major security breach, scanning of E-mails for NSA, and CEO purging male employees to finally get their attention. This is all on top of a platform of very poor Web performance."
VZ gives more to social welfare and less to shareholders. Need a more aggressive leader.
"Very Long Line at all the Verizon stores todayWaiting to return their remotes, router and Cable TV BoxOut with the OLD dinosaur, in with the NEW modern tech!"
"All right VZ down and RED like the communist company VZ has become NO one in America should do any business with a company like VZ that takes away your rights to see, read and post the truth, VZ is being destroyed by Han's and his EU one world order censoring NATZI's that censor what you can see read and post all part of the EU's one world order and the total destruction of America"
"you see these stupid liberal Millenials celebrating on the city's (e.g. NYC)? Its all overt the news.Just wait until the Biden reality sets in. These morons will be back in Mommies basement, unemployed after corporations fire them after receiving a tax hike. I hope they celebrate good--- when reality sets in I will say told you so... I give it 2 years or shorter. Watch it happen. So you wont have to look at King Trump and hear his #$%$-- you will have 10% unemployment and stock market crash."
Can someone tell me simply how to set up and use an alias on the yahoo finance boards?Or point me to a link. I've searched the web and can't figure it out. I also have ATT/Yahoo mail and only want the alias for finance. Thanks.
"Helicopter Money $$$$....#VZ a component of DOW and FED is saving the Market. No lose situation, collect the 4% Divvy and have FED buying stocks outright. Sad, but true."
just wonder how could Mr. Pai use FTC's position to do favor of his previous employer!
"The big switch to LTE about 13 years ago. Ivan knew the phone biz from wire nuts to Chairman of the Board. McAdams messed up with Yahoo/AOL but he did buy the 45% of wireless (VZW) that VOD owned. It was also McAdams who pushed wireline divestment starting back in 2002 when Hawaii was sold -- thru to the 2016 sale of California, Texas & Florida to FTR...I believe McAdams was running wireless in 2007...https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-switches-standards-gears-for-next-generation-network/"
So now communication doesn't seem important?
"Come on VZ, a little bump would be welcome"
Sprint merger imho will be good for Verizon
"Omg, I told you VZ was a BUM STOCK. It will never do anything."
"My guess is buyers return within three days of going ex div. That's what I have seen in the past. Of course, if you're in for the div it doesn't matter."
"just missed on earnings, top line beat"

Giving up all of Friday's gains (and then some) on no news ... aside from the TMUS / S merger (redux).
I’m a buyer at 45 
Verizon and Comcast both dividends paying stocks are very undervalued stocks compare to so called growth stocks which pay nothing in dividends and PEs are way high.

"yahoo fake news has a story about how the US secretly shipped plutonium from South Carolina to Nevada. probably to keep bad people from trying to damage train track and cause a 3,000 year problem somewhere. yet yahoo never says anything about the hundreds of pounds of radioactive white pancake material that has disappeared from the Russian company that bought some of our uranium mines."
"Vz losing revenue from cord cutters, losing revenue on wireless to T-Mobile, really advertising from Yahoo and AOL? go90? really? IOT? fleetmatics? really? they REALLY need to do is buy Disney and a company producing revenue. no question about it. Really."

"RESEARCH FROM MERRILL LYNCH “5G technology is poised to change the worldCellular networks are synonymous with everyday life thanks to their rapid progression over the past 45 years, from voice to text, web browsing, to now high-definition video streaming. The 5G evolution brings another decade-long technological evolution. With high download speeds, massive connectivity capabilities, ultra-low latency, and 99.999% reliability, 5G will enable new applications, address new markets, and transform how consumers and enterprises interact with the network. In this report, we examine the cellular network requirements, new architectures, the standardization efforts, spectrum issues, and discuss software-defined services and enabling technologies. We lay out the different network topologies, antenna technologies, and the rise of Edge cloud. We finish our report with an overview of legacy wireless technologies, from first to fourth generation networks.”"
the hype seems to be slowing down
With 30 mil shares short and ex divi approaching; how many are hoping to get your shares?
Got my dividend
Verizon: Huff Post and Yahoo. Two reasons I will never use Verizon.
If you want a trading stock get out of this. The stock is only for the dividend.
"JIm Cramer, reiterates Strong Buy rating for VZ!"
"If you think real dumb matt's call here on VZ was bad, check him out on GE, LOL!!!!!!!this guy is as dumb as a brick and I apologize to bricks for saying thattoo funny"
"Stinky, smelly, fetid, rotten Yahoo/Verizon continues the daily bashing of the President. Yet they are such COWARDS they do not allow conservative opinion to respond to their America-hating biased blather. What pathetic losers they are."
"And yet a third Verizon Yahoo slam that borders on threatening the president. Yahoo went out of its way to post a tweet by Kathy Griffin that said the following (and I quote): ""Ok fine. I’ll pray for him and the wife on one condition. NOT mild symptoms. And they each go on a ventilator, for at least 5 days. That’s my best and final.""I'm a shareholder. And I'm SICK AND TIRED of Verizon supporting this $h|+ from Yahoo and Huffington Post."
"As I said yesterday, wait for the big dilutive purchase. The stock, VZ, will get crushed on the announcement."
"I was wondering why Verizon stock wasn't moving in concert with all this latest 5G information and increased revenue? So, I examined how many shares were outstanding -- over 4 billion! I guess the next question is: how long before the stock price catches-up with all this noble expectation?"
"I don't know where COCO is, but MY ID says it all again and again.LOOK FOR A TEST OF THE 52 WEEK HIGH ."
The Verizon Delema - it is hard to be decisive about buying new things when you owe a lot of money. Check out the debt on the VZ balance sheet and you will understand why they are dragging their feet on the Yahoo deal.
"buy, buy , buy"
Does $1.09 eps for q4 include the $4.5 billion write-off for Yahoo/AOL?
Remember when Hillary thought the stars were in perfect alignment for the blue Democratic Party to win by a landslide because of the blue wall? She forgot to tell Trump.
5Ggoing to be EXPLOSIVE for VZ
"$1.9 trillion buys a lot of low income internet access. $1.9 trillion lets users escape terrible services like rush lyingball cell services and T-mobile joke of a network....it also will spike cell phone sales, which benefits #VZ bottom line. Yahoo cost have been written down for years, and I personally don't know one single person picking a cell phone provider on political grounds. I have seen people come back to Verizon after experiencing middling to poor connectivity on other networks though. gl"
"As far as who is saying YHOO was a bad investment. You apparently don't know Verizon. They have a 188B market cap for a reason. They bought Bell Atlantic and GTE at a price. .. They now have yhoo which everyone checks their phones 10 times a day and see ads. Maybe they like them, maybe they don't. .. Good?!?!"
where is my pal Coco

How can vol. go in reverse.
Does POTUS not attack any business by using his bully pulpit or FCC or DOJ. At least we know the chair of the FCC used to be at VZ so hopefully this is safe. But the rest of my portfolio not so much.
Why does VZ own leftist media? I don’t think they are making money on them. A lot of conservatives do not support VZ because of it.
VZ take over target?????
what media is v going to buy? VIAC
"As revenues continue to implode, with the company itself describing that revenues and profitability have plateaued, with the foolish acquisition of Yahoo, with competition taking market share from VZ............well, VZ looks like a sub $40 stock.Tons of debt with an enterprise value 20X the liquidity......I think the VZ house of cards is about to fall.And the chart told everyone that it was going to happen in advance, and the chart is telling everyone that more share price erosion is coming your way."
FANG stocks money out - Telecom Money in...next...
same old games with FED. Try to make everything look great with all money thrown at everything. Its one big joke. This whole system will implode.
Anyone know when Ms Mayer the CEO of #Yahoo will be leaving?oh!Does anyone know when she was appointed to the #Walmart Board of Directors?Does anyone know 1975 was the last year America had a trade surplus..oh!and #Walmart Global Procurement Offices are in China..So..Why did #Verizon purchase #Yahoo?
"LOL, LOL,LOL Get ready to say OH NO VZ is now the worst of breed with over double the debt per share that T has . WOW talk about debt and VZ in trouble with no way to get out of it. WOW Timber VZ worst of breed. LOL,LOL,LOL $208 dollars of debt for every share WOW is VZ in big trouble LOL,LOL,LOL"
My ID says it all
"So many old butthurt Trumptards on the Yahoo VZ page, hahaha!!!! Get a #$%$ life and go back to 4 chan and complain with your idiot kind. This is a stock forum, apes."
"So when Elon , who is sending up satellites like cuomo trying to get a date( every minute), figures out how to pass a gig through them to every inch of this planet.........game over."

"Stay clear VZ is way over valued and could drop to under $35 easy and they will start losing millions of customers , Why because they have not made the moves to compete in the new world that has been created by the smartest Guys and Gals in the room over at T. Wall Street pump so they can Dump FACT look out and stay clearhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-verizon-communications-inc-143959458.html"
"I hate the NFL deal but it is not that bad of a move.The details state that they can stream on internet connections on all devices while the prior deal was phones only.I used to think it was stupid when I saw people watching the games on their Verizon phones but now it will help with cord cutters on Fios.People can stream the service on their TVs now,this has to be bad for the old media networks but kinda worthwhile for Internet providers like Verizon."
I just switched from Verizon to tracfone mY monthly plan of 25$ verses 60$ what will happen to it>?
tariffs still coming sept. 1st just not as big. I say look out below this whole trade war is just a sham once again. On again off again. Maybe more maybe less. Enough already with stupid games to try to move markets.
"Got in at $55.49, last 4 minutes of trade. Will sell it higher or hold for divvy. Either way, I’m green."
"Love Verizon more and more at this crazy cheap level, will be crazy not to back up the truck for massive gains ahead in 2021 !"
"VZ is definitely one of my ""sleep good at night"" stocks."
"Vz-Yahoo had serious TDS again this weekend, must of been 50+ anti Trump rederick articles, more like agrocery tabloid fake media for far to long. The agenda is nothing more than a smear tactic and not news."

sold 1/2 at $50.30. bought $5 lower 3 weeks ago
"Ive had vz on my watch list forever. Whoever thinks this is staying down or tanking is clueless... and even if it did, its a clear and obvious buying opp"
Two super cycles on horizon. 1. Release of the next generation Apple phones this fall. 2. System upgrade to 5G. The system will begin to be upgraded in 2018 and run through 2020. 5G operates at up to 40X faster than 4G. In areas where there is a good signal cable will begin to die even faster. Why have cable when you can stream everything and anything using your wireless carrier. This will be good for VZ with the huge turnover expected in new phones and selling bigger data packs. VZ is a good long term investment opportunity.
"Ouch! in premarket. Now if it stays below $49 till the dividend distribution that might be ok. I can never understand analyst's, seems to me if they put a high expectation on a stock for the quarter and the stock does well, but not to the analysts perceived number, the stock gets hammered. I wonder how many investment firms provide high expectations on stocks, wait till the stock drops and pick up shares cheap, only to sell on recovery. Sounds like a Trumpism, ""the system must be rigged."""
"VZ never disappoints, Ever. I Just Like it. .. Don't let us Down. .. dit."
I think every time it give dividends it goes down.....
VZ still scamming customers on ch 4 news ny
"Their all selling, go to level 3 trading and youll see cause 5G is OUTDATED already before it ever got started. watch your share price go to 40 soon"
"As I type this, Geraldo Rivera is interviewing Trump live on WTAM (Cleveland news/talk station). Trump is flying into Ohio to visit a couple manufacturing plants, then attend a fundraiser in the Cleveland area. In response to a Geraldo question, Trump called out social media again as a cancer on the internet. Is this a reference to Facebook / Twitter / Yahoo-VZ? I don't know. Heads up VZ Media. I wish Trump wasn't such a narcissist. He would have been so much more effective."
Why are we down today???
Sell 50's. Buy low 40's. This is how you work Verizon stock.
"Yahoo Finance is talking about chaos in Portland.its not chaos. Its anarchy, its violence, its burning, its breaking people jaws who rescue a woman being assaulted, its dumping paint on a 70 year old woman in a wheelchair. The left says nothing about it. They cultured it, they encouraged it, Biden's aides bailed out people who did bad things there, and now, it will cost him the election. The left isn't very smart. And their ideas stink. Mainstream America is getting mad. But not at the country. they are getting mad at the vile people on the far left, promoting hatred , race mongering and violence. Remember when hundreds of pinkerton employees were treated badly, during union trouble at a plant. When they lost the battle, they were treated like dirt, and the unions lost much of their support. much like is happening to the good people in Portland. The left may have brainwashed millineals into hating their parents. But there are millions and millions of people who respect others and are sick of the violence. The left didn't like the country fighting in Vietnam. but they apparently love fighting and hurting US citizens."
"Only things going up are Oil, Vix, and 10 yr note."
@Bill mddb steak or fish? Planning on a rally. The only LED Umbrella July 2020.
Buy back 40.0-42.00. lets wait........................
"Why does Verizon hate hard working Americans ? They keep letting Yahoo Finance keep posting anti tax cuts and anti tax simplification here. Verizon, don't your shareholders do better when the economy does better ? You are violating your fiduciary duty to the people who own your company. If you love your country, sell Verizon."
VZ is down 4.98% to 54.04
Going to new high 5G.Far ahead.
How ya feelin about Hans now ?
"Just bought T, VZ. Close computer, hang around with my friends and drink beer. These companies are the king of network service and have high dividend. You will get profit any way. Long term invest stocks."
Bageezzzz.. Looks like T is Rallying......Maybe VZ Isn't going to Drag Ma Bell Down ~
"Definitely Heading toward $40s, will not touch this falling knife, outlook not looking good."
time to jump from this lifeboat to T.
"Double bottom at the 200 day,macd has crossed over strong,rsi above 50,I dont think I have to go any further.See you at 70."
"Why does every major corporation feel they need be so political? 1984 anyone? Truly do you appreciate the propaganda from Yahoo every day? I don't ""like"" Trump but I believe in freedom of thought. Why so much censorship of any view that does not fit the deep state liberal narrative? Why did Yahoo turn off comments on their ""news"" articles? The mob will win in November, no doubt, but I cannot invest in a company that decides its going to actively promote one candidate or view over another, its anti-American. Sell this dog, vote with your wallet"
Daily trading games back and forth to make a buck. Whole system is broke all greed. Just day trading games.Wake up america.
Just opened a long position in VZ. I think the $42 price we saw was the bottom. Nice dividend and a good outlook ahead thanks to being the first to roll out 5G.
VZ is pushing for a Biden victory.They do anything to silence a different view
"VZ dividend not showing up on Ameritrade yet, anyone else?"
"There's a hole in the bucket, we need some duct tape on this thing. Drip drip drip every day down a little bit"
"Down and RED like the communist company VZ has become , VZ CAN NOT even be trusted to protect Americans data any more and they have proved it by not even protect Americans First Amendment rights as they started censoring what Americans can see, read and post. What a change in VZ and I guess it has to do with Han's from the EU' and the EU's one world order. But for sure your data is NO LONGER safe in VZ hands and VZ has proved it by VZ own actions."
"I like a little padding against today's kind of market hit. My growth stocks are down, but my main income stocks like VZ are ok. It's called a safe dividend stock by almost everyone. It's growing, slowly. The kicker is 5G. I have no doubt it will be a commercial hit first with residential following as coverage increases, VZ just spent $17.9 bil of Capex. No flamers today...yet. If they dump Trump nothing will be safe."
"The Dow and VZ have historically traded lower after the 24th, 25TH and 26th of October 2018. The daily trade volumes were 150% higher in October 2018 in comparison to recent daily trade volumes in October 2019.25 million shares traded daily versus 11 million shares traded daily on the 24TH of October.Unless VZ announces blowout earnings and guidance, otherwise I expect minor profit taking of one to two points per share after the earnings announcement.From the current AH price of 60.91, down to 60 and even 59. Unfilled quotes at 60.41 and 60 will likely get filled tomorrow.I don’t believe we will see 55 like other shorts loved to claim. Unless, earnings and guidance are both horrible that would prompt a major sell off.GLTA"
"Biden's chances of winning improve overnight. Because they ""found"" 140,000 votes for Biden, and not a single vote for Trump. They must be using VZ accountants to count."
"Look in the right of this screen. Once again, yahoo finance denigrates the wealthy with their slur that 3 wealthy families have more wealth than 4 million families. Yet Verizon CEO McAdam makes more money than hundreds of millions of people. This is what Yahoo Finance does. Throw stones at others. yet their won house is not in order. Get rid of your Verizon landline. sell their stock. tell them you are sick and tired of their feckless mongering."
Morgan Stanley traders selling off in premarket to justify the equal rating given to VZ and price target of 58. VZ will quickly resume it's march to mid 60's as buyers from other firms absorb MS volume. if anything competing firms will step up the buying to make MS look bad.
there should be a thank you for reply
Het Tim -- time to replace Issikof with Limbaugh.
VZ needs Viagra. It cannot make it to 60 without a giant boost.
wow the buy and sell war kept it down!! i think it should have been up to 50!!! it will be 50 by friday!
"K so T got Wonder Woman bounce, but, many will cancel HBO max after 1-month."
hum NOT LOOKING GOOD! AT&T Would never to that to its employees. Good luck with your overpriced stock!
is this a good time to buy VZ?
"ATTN Eric: ""The reality is that Verizon is too well established in many households has the best coverage""If you're someone who 'successfully trades' Verizon, that's one thing, but if you click on chart above, choose 5 years, & compare it to the S&P 500, the horrific reality, is that the S&P 500 has gained 99.00%, vs Verizon's 16.00% Charts have no emotions, & don't lie."

"People are not seeing the power of 5G. 5G home internet will take significant fiber based broad band internet owned by the likes of spectrum, Cox And at&t."

"Just thinking of all the holiday buying going on. Between black friday, cybermonday, amazon this, walmart that. The gifts such as gaming equipement, peletons, mirrors, online streaming, Tv's etc etc. One thing definately is needed for all this great stuff,....an high speed internet connection. from Verizon's FIOS to the new 5G roleout, it certainly looks like Verizon is in a great position going forward."
VZ is searching hard for revenue. I traded Iphones two week ago the sales rep said my new bill would be less than present bill. I received the new bill today and it's double the previous monthly charges. Now I have to study this 5 page bill and spend a afternoon with customer disservice to straighten it out. They added a insurance policy I was unaware of and a upgraded unlimited plan that I did not need or want. Not interested in any telecom or cable stock.
Headed to 38 for sure.
"I am the greatest LOL, LOL,LOL VZ is going to tank and for sure they are going to have to cut the dividend LOL LOL LOL the next Kodak , VZ is over $233 dollars per share in DEBT over twice the debt per share as T LOL, LOL ,LOL"
Seriously this thing has been straight down since December No bounces at all A true tees that makes a lot of money but without a story nobody cares
How much revenue will Verizon generate with the new pricing for Yahoo mail? Any idea? Have they discussed it with any analysts? From from $19 to $39?
I sold all my VZ the day I chatted with AI and it claimed it’s human. Any company training its AI to lie to its customers on that will go down.
"Fauci missed a couple of Task Force briefings. No big deal. He's been to dozens. But Verizon directed Yahoo Finance to continue putting doubt into people minds. See, Verizon wants low cost workers to come across the border in great numbers, and Verizon wants to install low cost Huawei 5G, regardless that all information will be monitored by China. Verizon is trying to distract some important people who are trying to save lives. American Lives.Its pretty disgusting of Verizon to do something like that. Your investment in Verizon is enabling them to thwart a cure for the virus. You should be proud of yourself. Maybe someone you know is suffering or died, or might suffer, or die, because Verizon wants the president to fail at every thing he does. Think it through. Maybe it will be you."
Anytime VZ touches $55 sell!
"march 9 it was 57,,now it struggles at 50"

"The fact is NO ONE in America should be doing any business with VZ , Why Because VZ has proven they can not be trusted to protect your rights , The real fact is VZ is now taking away your rights as they censor what you can see, read and post. Han's and his EU one world order NATZI's are trying to destroy America by not letting you see the real truth about a lot of things"
Block out all the noise. VZ has just filled the $44.40 gap. Next Gap to fill $47.24. Retirements are buying and divy reinvesting.
"Verizon customer service and policies are the worst ever. We moved, had a grandfathered package with free HBO and some other stuff. When I moved literally 10 minutes away, they then told me I couldn't transfer my old package. They also said I has to cancel, my old account, and open a new account. Their mess up cost me $$$$ and they dont apologize. I even said that a local competitor harasses me every day, and I stay with FIOS since 1997 due to my loyalty. I asked them what can you do??? They did nothing. This blowhard company has the worst customer service ever. They can do anything, they choose not to. So, as sooon as I find time I will be DUMPING THIS KRAP and going with a competitor. bye bye Hans."

"Ex-VZ employee here. I got hit in one of the layoffs early this year. I switched to T-Mo shortly after getting the shaft from this disaster of a company and I encourage all the other people who were laid off to do the same. I not only saved about $30/month on the bill for my entire family...and got a better data plan, I'm actively working to do to this place what it did to me. If throwing workers out because of the leadership's mismanagement isn't enough, Lowell has now endorsed the ""I'm an Immigrant Campaign,"" simply because it will allow him to replace loyal American employees with cheaper foreign labor so that he can get a bonus bigger than the $12 million bonus he got this year.Join in and help sink the Titanic. If you don't want to use T-Mo, any other carrier will do. VZ lost almost 1/2 million customers last quarter...let's make this one even better."

"With rates dropping and the rapid changes in the traditional dividend payers that have a future, VZ looks golden. Ford, Macy's any oil related company ... its getting harder to find a diverse income protfolio beyond utilities - that look really overvalued given they have infrastructure expense that will catch up with them. It's a bit scary really when retirees struggle to find ways to get income without the risk of losing too much capital."
Verizon X-Date Tomorrow! ! 5% quaterly dividend. Buy now!
Remind me again Verizon - Why did you buy Yahoo?
Sold my 1000 shares of VZ at 53.10 this morning. Made a killing. Next comes the dividend. Stick it where the sun doesn't shine RF.
"Can someone explain to me why people are so negative on this company? I understand that 130 billion in debt is quite high for any company. With a positive current ratio, forward P/E of 11, strong cash flow, over a 4% dividend, and the beginning of the 5G boom, why is this blue chip company not a buy? The overall market is getting very frothy, with the nasdaq and S/P reaching all time highs. Can the investors on this page elaborate for me?"
Now the final yahoo. They had too screw up earnings digest. You have to keep hitting next and previous.
So why does VZ give up gains after a stellar earnings announcement? Up $1.05 now down$0.50?
Stock will soon be $65 per 5G growth.Jim Cramer loves VZ.Paul Dorrance feels TXN is a Buying Opportunity.

"It was this price all the way back in 2018, wow, talk about a pointless stock to own...."
What is your basis for this prediction? The 2018 tax cuts and FULL employment are both inflationary situations. Why do you think the Fed won't continue raising rates?
"To buy or not to buy and at what price? Maybe $55.00, that would be the current half-way 52 week h/l. Their dividend is $.62."
"When you double your personal exemption, when you raise the amount needed before you pay a dime in taxes, taxes will go down for the poor. And yet Yahoo Finance, owned by Verizon, continue to mislead the ignorant, and poor, and try to make the tax change look likes its only for the rich. If Verizon so hates the new plan, maybe Verizon should pay the old rates when they file. Why in the world, is Verizon against Americans becoming employed. Why would Verizon not want millions of new better paid people, who will buy higher priced Verizon plans. Better yet, why in the world would you invest in Verizon ?"
"For VZ shareholders, the pain is endless."
is Verizon interested in Siri.
I defy anyone to find a slower web site than Yahoo Finance. Marisa Myer screwed Yahoo up so bad Verizon can't fix it.

You need to change your bong water more often son...As Verizon, Zayo and other providers look to satisfy an array of 5G wireless, consumer and business broadband services, there will be a requirement to raise the number of dark fiber strands. Take Verizon as an example. As part of its “One Fiber” initiative, the service provider is installing high strand count fiber in markets like Boston and Chicago.This fiber build is designed to satisfy multiple needs: current and upcoming 4G and 5G wireless deployments, Fios FTTH and business services.FREE DAILY NEWSLETTERLike this story?

Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference 2017 last May the telco is putting in 1,700 strand cables in the main feeder routes.RELATED: Verizon’s McAdam: Our multiuse fiber approach offers more cost efficiencies“The architecture we’re building in Boston and in other cities is multiuse,” McAdam said. “It turns out building fiber requirements for wireless in a 4G with a dense small cell deployment is the best architecture for everything because you’re going run right by the enterprise, run by the small business, and it sets you up for delivering things like smart cities.”Barclays said Verizon’s strategy, which will likely be targeted according to specific market needs, enables the telco to future-proof its network.“While the company doesn’t plan to use that quantity of strands in all parts of its network, it believes the requirements of 5G will require feeder pipes with many strands that connect to pipes with lower strand counts running to light poles, for example,” Barclays said. “Though 1,700 strands may not be necessary for today’s demand, given projections for exponential data growth and the latency requirements of nascent applications (autonomous cars, VR/AR), building additional lines should allow the company to avoid continuously dissecting and reengineering its network.”But Verizon’s own internal fiber build is just one part of its strategy. The service provider will continue to work with third-party dark fiber suppliers like Zayo and Crown Castle.Demands from carriers like Verizon and other top wireless carriers have driven these providers to enhance their fiber strand count. According to numbers gathered by Barclays, Crown Castle generally deploys between 150 to 300 strands, while Zayo’s metro market fiber has an average of 150 strands. Barclays noted that “if we look forward we could see a material increase from these levels as network densification takes hold.” Zayo, for one, was selected in October by an unnamed wireless operator to deploy over 500 small cell sites in two large metro areas. Under the terms of that multimillion-dollar agreement, Zayo will provide its set of turnkey mobile solutions, including small cell citing, placement and installation."

I do not like to invest in telephones. My sister in law worked here. She did not have that much in her 401k so she picked the monthly payout which was 3k a month plus health insurance. I have Boeing health insurance as a retiree. I pay $371 a month 200 deductible. This is the old Traditional Plan so the premo. If this is premo I wonder what the others who took the bait to take lesser plans. But VZ is like wow all the way around. My pension is far less the 3k. I did max out my 401k but now I have to play the market the rest of my life. My pensions and rental income all adds up to 3k. So I am good but she was just an operator no skills. So what are the other VZ retirees getting.

"#$YHOOI am pretty sure that VZ has enough to void the Yahoo deal if they choose to do so, but why would they announce their intentions now? They have a team at Yahoo performing due diligence, learning everything about a business that has very successfully competed with AOL in the past. Even if there is no deal, the knowledge gained from total access may be invaluable to AOL. The Verizon CEO, claiming that he was not seeking a $1 billion discount, followed immediately by the chief legal officer claiming that the data breach may be a material adverse change, was surprising – but the net result was to prolong uncertainty. I don’t know what happens next but one has to believe that the deal will change. An indemnification for data breach related liabilities would seem to be a difficult negotiation, since total liability is difficult to quantify. It appears to me that Yahoo’s product has significantly deteriorated, but I don’t know what VZ cares about. I also don’t know if there are other suitors for Yahoo who would still offer a competitive price under current circumstances. In short, I don’t think we’ve learned anything about the probability of this deal closing."

"Just did a friend's tax return, Her return/refund fell 25% from last year, if .it's the same across the country then there will less money to buy goods and services this year."
Simply disappointing.... Many so called experts continue to position this as a great stock. The censoring on Yahoo and the extreme left narrative is silly. Many have and are giving up on VZ and moving money to much better options and avoiding the angry political tilt......
"Not sure about the oils but two dividend oriented stocks for which China has less impact than most are Verizon and Store Capital (STOR). There will be some negative impact because how can there not be. But after a few more down days, their relatively safe dividends look better and better. Thing is, both stocks have held up better than most (as they should) through this so the new entry points will probably only be slightly better. If they get a lot lower they will be well worth a buy."

"So Verizon, your Yahoo division is at it again. Now they're saying he was ""dangerously low"" with his oxygen level. It never went below 94% saturation, which is, by itself, not a big deal. Had it kept dropping, then yes it's an issue. But it didn't. But the way Yahoo reported it, and in fact added a second article titled ""President Pelosi"" in response to Pence campaigning, is downright irresponsible. I would rather Verizon tell me how they're going to improve their mid-frequency capacity which is still sub-par to its competitors. I like mmWave but Verizon's focus on it is at the expense of longer range in suburban and rural areas. Nah, I have to hear about how Trump is ""near death"" by its (unprofitable) media division instead."

Due to the technology, its estimated they will need to put a mini cell station every 2 to 8 houses. The best part is, you think they are doing this for you. No. In the future, this will be used to track and control you, if it doesn't kill you first."

Seems like some folks have some inside knowledge of tomorrows numbers the way VZ has been trading down the last few days. Where is the SEC

"Lower highs and lower lows seems to be the trend that's setting in, over the past few days"
Dividend! Lovely!
"So, Verizon was $55.84 in Jun 2016th and yet there are people on here bragging about how great it is. Three years and it has went up barely anything at all. Not to mention, It hit $53.91 all the way back in 2013 (12% share price appreciation in six years, omg). I guess my idea of great return is a bit different...and yeah I know you got the dividend but still, bragging about this or T is plain silly."
If not $59 next week.
Whatever caused the dump on the open it is spreading. Guess cell phone have been replaced by a new technology.The workings of Wall Street.
Does anyone know about the dividends being paid out? I thought somebody said it was supposed to be paid on February 3. ￼￼
MY ID SAYS IT ALL. Coco in hiding
FIX YAHOO
"POWELL please SPEAK UP !Markets have been telling you something all along, but you DONT LISTEN."
This is great news for Verizon. Change is good! Mariana Agathoklis has been named vice president of corporate communications at Verizon Communications Inc. She will lead strategy and implementation of external communications and be a key part of the leadership team on issues and initiatives affecting the company.
why is it falling
"Obviously VZ got ahead of itself and T is trading way too low. I welcome this pull back, in fact, the lower VZ goes, the more I will buy."
Things have gotten so bad at yahoo 'finance' that the remaining pinheads working there are stealing the pencils and bottled water before the election.
Vz loves being on their knees for Biden and taking the long one
"Governor Mario Cuomo (D-NY), aka the Nursing Home Grim Reaper, will be receiving an Emmy for his tireless work during the Wuhan Virus crisis. Rumor has it he will be accepting the prestigious award outside of one of the nursing homes he mandated take in CoVid sick patients which put him and his administration on a glide path to the most CoVid related nursing home deaths in the nation followed by that idiot governor Phil Murphy of NJ."
Don't worry be happy. VZ will get back to 60 soon IMO
What are we thinking for earnings in the morning
dear leader is not happy. dear leader may lose his asc on this stock
Vz is the top 5G service in the world.
"Non-Stop Falling knife, Definitely heading to $40s next."
Today I sold 5000 shares of my yahoo/Verizon media/Verizon comm.Stock. The way they go about controlling/manipulating content on these boards is criminal!￼￼
"Verizons Yahoo Finance continues to allow hackers to attack our computers. Hopefully no Verizon customers will get mad if someone targets Verizon computers, and #$%$ down their phones lines ?"
buying more today for those juicy dividends
This comment is great!http://fromwhereistand.info/2017/04/verizon-gets-a-lesson-in-remedial-business-management-101/
"Verizon has yahoo finance scaring people that the SCOTUS pick will expand gun rights.That doesnt scare me, It pleases me. and if you like owning a gun, to protect your family, and your house, you should sell your Verizon stock, since they are trying to take it away from you."
THE SHEEP THAT IS vERIZON AND YAHOO
NFL deal will be huge as the start selling digital ads on every game including the Super Bowl!
"VZ could see the mid 60’s before years end. An associate retirement incentive before years end, off payroll before new year, rumor has it."
"Look at this hunk of junk, down bad when the market is up, again and again. To think people still believe 5G is going to save it, nothing will save VZ, it's a has been..."
what does Corona or Oil have to do with VZ
"Here's the latest on the C Band auction: https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/cowen-estimates-verizon-s-c-band-spend-at-35bVerizon estimated at $35 billion and climbing. The article goes on to say dividend will be maintained but suspect share buybacks could be pushed out a few years. I take it one further to say that T Mobile appears to have hit on a strategy that hurts Verizon and AT&T - make them spend more money than they thought they would. T Mobile is doing that with the C Band auction; who's to say they won't do it with modestly cutting rates for 5G service that AT&T and Verizon will have to follow? The analysts aren't considering that in their calculations, and it is worth considering. I say the dividend (for now) is safe, but that could change in 3-4 years with higher interest rates, lower post-paid per subscriber income, higher implementation fees, etc. 5G is turning out to be very expensive for ALL the participants."
Wonder why VZ is down a half buck -- did China threaten to put a tariff on VZ calls?They call it domestic revenue.
"index investing has ruined stock investing,,this is why we have selloffs and its a shame the scam destroys any of us who own a stock"
whoever gave me thumbs down can you please elaborate? thank you
propaganda stock.WHEN TRUMP WINS THEY ARE ALL FIRED
New 52 week high coming soon. buy.buy.buy
The market views Verizon as being the clear winner in 5g. Market share gains. :-)
"Verizon stock is one that hasn’t lost half of its value, so if investors need to raise cash for the recovery vz is as good as cash in the bank. Thats why its being sold. Div safe as the sun rising every morning."
VZ back to 1999 levels. Congrats.20 years of dividends.
"One of the things I am concerned about is the smaller dividend increases. Really concerned that T, rebounded so quickly from yesterday’s meltdown. Whereas, it looks like we could fall back below $60 this coming week? Any thoughts?"
"the drop already has started,,"
Burner Phone Alert -- AT&T said they will help Hurricane Victims . .. Got that on my SIM . ..I think VZ should help as well. I know it's a lot to take in but come'on. .
"VZ is a powerhouse...inside runs quite well however everyones sallery/hrly are above average including corporate security, however...a well oiled machine that rolls with the customer and has that famous sought after UNLIMITED DATA ACCESS...why do you think BRK-A IS LONG VZ?? and the dividends alone will be my supplement...etc etc etc.... long vz!!"
As soon as I sell my shares and take a big loss VZ will start go up.
"Dear Verizon,You realize that 40% - 50% the yahoo audience is Republican, right? How about making 1/2 the stories pro-Republican then? You know, talk about the market going up, less regulations, ISIS losing ground everywhere. No one is going to read your articles if 100% of them are Left Wing trash. Maybe you should sell of HufPo before it loses all value."
There's just nothing happening to move this stock higher right now.
CALPERS bought VZ in first quarter:https://www.barrons.com/articles/biggest-u-s-pension-sold-facebook-bank-of-america-disney-stock-verizon-51589376715?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo

Love the dividendLove writing call 1 buc above st priceCollect collect money every week
"How about creepy Verizon, selling your personal information to a 3rd party. And that 3rd party isn't just selling it to bounty hunters.Yeah, you got to wonder about Verizon. They have yahoo finance do stories to further the agenda, but as soon as there is money, they follow no one, and would probably sell their mother if they could. They did disclose where she has been. Maybe I'll buy the list, and find out where you've been, and where you go. would you like that ? and maybe some one will buy info so they can see where your daughter is. still think its funny ?????"
Sold out 30days ago. That was a good thing.
Two weeks from div payout. VZ fell as big investors pulled out in order to buy the beaten down news affected stocks with much more upside . VZ is considered a reliable but boring retired persons stock to own.It will take off when big investors return for the safety. Just sit tight and collect the dividends.
short it now get oaid quick money time matters
"6/21. DB to Buy, Goldman Sachs to Buy, VZ pops 6/22. What more do you guys want?"
"funny all the recession proof stocks have been terrible with earnings . it’s a set up . MM want in cheaper for the coming recession . buy T, VZ , MO, BGS. ABBV, JNJ, MRK,etc. high yield will be your friend soon ."
see whole market plunge. Al because FEd keeps pumping/ holding up markets with money infusions into banks. All artificial stimulus. Unrealistic.
For those that said to sell VZ and buy T. You guys have it backwards. Lol. Long and strong on VZ. Patience is a virtue.
I wonder what all that action was right at the open...Over a million shares traded in just the 1st min... over $61After that it went right back to the usual low volume trades of late.Looks like someone placed a big market order and cleaned out all the standing limit orders.Automatic DIV reinvestment order related maybe??
"Yahoo keeps putting up ads to sign up for their ""secure"" Password ManagerYeah, that's not gonna happen... Who puts passwords onto a platform that allowed millions of their own accounts to be hacked at least TWICE? If you wanted a reliable car, would you buy a Yugo?"
Version 5G at the Superbowl! Sweet. That's why they are the best in the nation! No to mention that they have a great dividend!
Verizon's Yahoo. Disappointed to see the manure spreader is up and running today. Doesn't it run on windmill power?
Now the sky is the limit.
Where is that 20% hazard pay that Verizon should give that AT&T is giving there employees
I expect VZ to lay back on service termination for delinquent payments. Goodwill and the right thing to do. Won't hurt the bottom line.
"Verizon now telling Yahoo Finance to demean the President for wanting some inflation. Inflation, you know, it helps retired people make money on the cash in their bank. It also helps raise wages. How can Verizon so hate the American people that made their company. How can Verizon shareholders be so heartless and help hurt millions of Americans."
"Yahoo Finance has recently offered us an app, to help clear our computer or unwanted clutter. Probably some of it downloaded my Microsoft, for yahoo. and before , they offered us a way to link all our accounts. like I trust a company, that pushes the global agenda, hates American workers, and our country. I wouldn't trust yahoo with my urine. they'd send it to a lab, and get a dna test, and use it against us, somehow. Verizon, you don't know how much business your agenda is costing you. well management does, but the smaller shareholders don't. they are being used, by the elites."
What if you’re one of the poor saps who got in at $54 last year? Haven’t you seen this movie before?
Will the Buffet news make this stock skyrocket???
didn't think id get VZ down 3% real quick like/.

"As mentioned last night, VZ did traded down to 60 and then 59.21 few minutes ago."
I left verizon years ago and boy am I glad. Why would anyone use their services? So many better options.
Lets see that golden cross
Beat and raise told you all.New 52 week high today.
"Whoa, VZ, doing the $60, look at you. Your duo-papi-poly going to sell the Dtv, and join the $60 club with you? How much does the Duopoly feed the likes of NY AG Letitia James to get her protection, and have her frivolously waste precious State resources on stalling the inevitable Fed approved merger? At the least, giving the Duo a 6-month head start (if not much more) on the 5G, And, further draining the enemy with needless litigation time/expense, while inflicting harm to the consumer, contractors & country as well. Crooked politics is so sad.Meanwhile, people dying from drugs (either misuse or can't afford), massive homelessness, mental health issues, crime, law, order, education, criminal justice, airport/national security, immigration, transportation, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, 1st Amendment, 2nd Amendment, tobacco/vaping, human/sex trafficing, gangs, murder, rape, armed robbery, felonies and 1000 more. Didn't know this Fed approved pro consumer/country merger is life & death State AG rescue the peon.Yet somehow a State AG after a grueling soon to be 2 year Fed approval process (instead of using her time/budget on the 1000+ life/death real stuff), wants to protect the Duo, and foolishly go to court verse a righteous telcom merger and say with no merit at all and with futility to try and supercede the FCC and Department of Justice? Imagine that, staring us all right in the face?Enjoy your success VZ while you can. Once New TM has the ""treasure trove"" and scale/synergies, and continues to run as successful /customer friendly as they have, with $oftbank, your reign's days are numbered. There's spectrum for distance and spectrum for penetration, and the engineering of deploying it all is key, and Sprint themselves alone now on that indisputably beats everyone as far as portfolio holdings. Only S with TMUS will the Duo's reign be in jeopardy, not to mention the side Dish."
"cellphone customers growth just beginning, this time is buy time,"
Buffet cost bases is $59ish. He was buying more today & will continue to next week to $59. For he knows the Divy is Premo!! Soon as his mega increased position are public. You'll NEVER see $58. again!!
It's nice having R on mute. Just like a tree falling in the woods and not hearing a sound.
MY ID SAYS IT ALL DESPITE A 40 PENNIES DROP.
Verizon is up 4.91% to 53.71
"It is true. I was forced to sell off Vz to raise cash to buy Moderna. Symbol MRNA. I WAS UP $75k. But, only escaped with $39k. I am not a chart expert, but with 5G unleashed, I expect us to be heading to $60 very soon."
I was hoping for an up day in VZ so I can sell even more.
Does anyone have meaningful commentary on VZ's current loss in valuation?
"Just a couple of weeks left to capture ""next dividend"""
"what joke this stock has become, a year ago it was 60 now its a struggle to hold on to 54,, tahts a big amount of share price loss of $6 , the reasons are,, I ahve no idea, maybe its worthless like Gamestop since hedge funds are shorting it and winning large"
Time to buy AT&T.
"I have been a holder of VZ for two years. I preface my question with this so people do not think I am advocating selling VZ,. However, it seems VZ consistently falls back to the $48-$49 range after hitting the $54 resistence. Does it finally break through that barrier or should we look at taking some profits here?"
Is this a better AT&T
It's $60 and I just got paid. Could be worse -- tell your congressman that Safe City 5G tech should get a big allocation of infrastructure funding. I have to assume that is going to be a big topic going into the election. Talk your book -- it's ok if it's good for the country too because that's good quid pro quo if it's in your interest and in the interest of the country. Just like the investigation into bragging by Joe about with holding the $1 bil until a guy was fired. You see how that works?
"Verizon liquidated their ground ownership for offices, cell sites, data centers, resulting in unfavorable lease payments only adding to their current decline in operating marginsetc. which has only added to their"
entire telecom space is a mess right now... for no good reason.. SMH..
Maybe Franz Hans will speak and get us back into the 56s soon

"Now we have Verizon ordering yahoo finance, to lecture Joe Biden about taxes..Perhaps verizon is worried Joe might win.Joe doesn't have any ideas. Nor Warren, not Sanders. All they do is listen and obey those who fund them. Anyway, we've been hearing that if Biden does win, there will be an event, Biden will be evaluated, and a pre selected physician will tell us he is not qualified to serve, and the VP will take over. Whether Joe is fit to serve or not really doesnt matter. Its someone elses ideas that will be implemented. And we will all suffer immensely."
poor vz
I don't see doom and gloom here. Pull back necessary since VZ is chasing after yesterday#$%$ Yahoo instead of tomorrow's opportunity such as a content play. They will smarten up or die. Right now I'm wanting to believe that they are trying to turn this big boat in a different direction but pay attention cause if this ship goes down the capt will have a GOLDEN life jacket.
"Verizon admits 5G not a monumentous occasion very few will ever see the 5G Network. Millimeter-wave 5G isn’t for widespread coverage, Verizon admitsVerizon and T-Mobile confirm 5G's highest speeds will only be for select areas."
"VerizonThis is a top telecommunications pick at Merrill Lynch for 2017. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) is a global leader in delivering the digital world. Verizon Wireless operates America’s self-described most reliable wireless network, with 109.5 million retail connections nationwide. Verizon also provides converged communications, information and entertainment services over America’s most advanced fiber-optic network, and it delivers integrated business solutions to customers worldwide.Verizon also recently announced the purchase of Yahoo’s core operating business for $4.8 billion in cash. The analysts feel it plays into Verizon’s strategic drive to expand into advertising and content, and they also think the transaction is largely immaterial from a financial perspective. This deal could be renegotiated as Yahoo disclosed another massive security breach last week.Investors are paid a 4.42% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price objective is $59, and the consensus target is $54.05. Shares closed Friday at $51.81."
"Check out this Yahoo headline from this morning. I wish I could say I'm making this $h|+ up, I'm not:Biden urged not to debate Trump so president doesn't have another platform to 'lie'And VZ keeps supporting this garbage???"
"Wow, signing a deal with Amazon. More winning. Vz is a bargain. Whereas AMZN is a little overpriced, and very frothy. But when you invest in Vz, you get AMZN in a sense. Does T have a marketing department? 5G signup of NBA, NFL, and hockey too. Now a AMZN 5G partnership. Thank You Hans"
"With 5G implementation coming, VZ is actually now in the catbird seat with the T-M/Sprint merger off. The horizon for Verizon (bit of poetry there) is as good as it has been in a long time. Between the robust dividend, strong balance sheet and exiting cable, it is no time to be selling."

"I,like most reading this,am an investor in VZ.I bought shares in anticipation of a monetary gain.Too much futuristic,fundamental,hypothetical outcomes,taking on debt,etc.I dont really care who is more knowledgeable about bits,bytes,ack,nak.The bottom line is financial not fundamental.I am a long term investor and VZ has underperformed the market.Hans has got to go.Nice guy but too farsighted."
BEAT!
Verizon. Because someone has to be last place in 5G.
sell all over $52
Verizon can go to YAHOO...because the Pope says there is no Hell.
"Stock getting crushed on heavy volume. Gee, I'm sure the Investor Day must have had some really good news to spur confidence...sigh. Worst investment of my career."
"I dont know why your all saying this stock and company sucks. It's not a growth stock and it never has been. You only buy it for the dividend period. If you buy 100 shares today.... In 20 years you will make $4,640 just in dividends, and that's not including dividend raises. That's not too shabby is it."
"business insider, a hack unit used by yahoo news, and posting on these pages, paints another conservative, Bob Dole, in a good light, by complimenting him for standing up from his wheelchair.isn't it nice how the left will respect you when you get old and tired. but until then, they hate your guts, if you don't step along."
"gee, stock getting pounded because they are buying two anti-capitalism liberal mouth pieces. apparently VZ thinks profits are evil so they will forego them in the future."
Why is Verizon down so much today
nice earnings report. why the drop?
"Another virus scare from yahoo finance. All they do is try to make people feel uncomfortable.Yes, they only seem to do bad things. Like let themselves be hacked. yahoo finance shouldn't be here misinforming investors. It should be shut down, and give restitution to everyone they harmed.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches"
this should be under 59 end of day
Why has my e-mail switched from Yahoo to AT&T. It appears I lost all my existing mail and the address.
Wait forCAPITULATION .save your $$$$$$$$$$$thenBBBUUUUUUYYYYYYYY
how does this vz stock go from one of the best performing stocks of the year in the dow to where it is now based on one analysts downgrade to neutral.
So Ajit Pai is a conflict of interests??
VZ is a lousy service provider! They claimed Fios is fast my speed test shows range 87 - 92 Mbps only! Technicians came here like 4 times...but can't get more than 100Mbps inspite I paid for 150Mbps! VZ has 1 router only...my Wi-Fi signal in deck/bathroom/garage are dead....it gets disconnected or no bar!I fired VZ ans used Altice One each box serves as Wi-Fi in each part of my house! Speed Test 210Mbps in all locations including my deck/porch/bathroom/garage areas where I use my laptop on streaming...and I sold my stocks n bought ATUS....
"buying at $54, i can wait a week"
You need to invest to go forward to the future
"While Hans is busy extolling the virtues of nationwide 5G with Apple, its red-headed stepchild media division brat Yahoo is busy telling everyone how dangerous a Christian gathering is in Nashville, ignoring the fact that we have had MONTHS of BLM rallies all over the US without a peep from the media about how dangerous THOSE are (as blacks are 3X more likely, per capita, to have coronavirus than whites). So THIS is SAFE?????:"
"DOWN and RED VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
I see massive sell-offs here big time. Blame Federal Reserve for these usual games with rates. Has been going on for at least last 10 years here. I say enough already . Crash and burn into free fall make Federal Reserve pay for their manipulation of rates games here. Savers get screwed period. Wake up america look out below.
Why is VZ going down before earnings ???
"Verizon the Dinosaur lays off 1,000 workers in India and shuts down AOL Instant Messenger. I predict no one answers the phone after 6 PM. This company is run by cavemen living in the prehistoric ages."
"Amazon has more failures than successes ,they already had a Fire Phoneand it went down in flames,then they sold phones with Amazon installed apps and eventually dropped that and unlocked those phones."
"instead of 500 million ,take mayers 260 million and only pay 240 million saving us shareholders money and get this stock moving again.Take Mcadams 18 million as well pay even less,since this was his brainchild."
tmobile customers with 2 or more lines will get free sub to netflix. t and. vz tank as a result.
No news is bad news for this stock.
"So I see Section 230 has raised its ugly head again. This is important for Verizon shareholders due to Verizon providing ISP, as well as their ownership of Verizon Media division (and indirect ownership of other internet-based publications as a result of its holdings in Buzzfeed). I suggest taking the time to learn more about Section 230 and the risks it poses to ISP's and those providing content on the internet."
"It really brightens my day to see VZ at $55. The tax reform gave VZ a 20%+ boost in free cash flow and I believe from memory 100% tax expencing for 5 years 2017 - 2021 just as VZ starts the 5G buildout. You can see what camera technology can do in the Chicago case of the fake MAGA stuff. Towns, villages, cities and states are going to vie for 5G to come their way because the camera/sound tech will be much better than Chicago's system installed by IBM several years ago. Now is the time to continue to stay the course. VZ's share price growth is not going to be linear and signs are pointing to much higher profitability after the RIF costs are booked. VZ will be able to divest a lot of real estate after the staff are gone. Let's hope Hans is a big divvy guy."
Verizon - you need to dump Yah Hoo.
Even updated yahoo finance app and still less information given than a week ago. I loved the company description of what they did and where located. Plus the earnings beat and miss were awesome. Please do better
Verizon/Yahoo pukes continue to squelch conservative opinion as they spew their agenda of liberal garbage. COWARDS by any measure...and PROOF their agenda is inferior.
there goes all the earnings gainz
If we can get rid of all the atheist right wing #$%$ we can make some money in this company.
I expect a slight pull back today considering our recent run but strong into the close prepping for tomorrow and hoping for a nice spike the next 2 days!jmo
"there are lot of things need 5g wireless networks to do, SO 5G networks can make huge business, only VZ can build 5G wireless networks, because only VZ have enough wireless network cover, others drop call too many areas, SO they can't build 5G networks, their 5G networks sure be useless for business, SO strong buy VZ sure be make money and get high dividend, VZ worth $62 per share now."
When did they pay dividends? Thanks
Verizon is down 7.48% to 50.12
"Road to $40s Begins, Time to Run before your precious lifesavings gets dumped."
Dividend is $2.31 year divide by 4 = .58 cents qtr.
VZ is bending -- impossible not to lose ground when the market dislocates. Investors have to be getting the message that VZ is a store of value defensive equity that can behave like an AAA bond. I am very glad I have a chunk of change in VZ...sadly no cash to buy more...
Want more but not at this inflated price !!
The next GE? Verizon is a dinosaur. over priced in a market with competitors who have better and cheaper solutions. Need new management or they are toast
"wireless fee bottomed out, so vz worth $75 per share,"
When is VZ dividend date ?
"l think no more price war, because Sprint T mobile PC Metro and cricket signals too bad."

"5% dividend is pretty impressivewhat about competition, the revenue seems to be going down hillwhat about straight talk, seems a lot cheaper, uses vz towersstock chart is really screwy looking but 5% should create a floor. On the long term chart, it looks like it might fall to 45why, was 43, then 44, then 45 maybebut 5% is a nice dividend, so I'm sort of surprised it fell at all from the 52 week highbut, I don't know anything about it, so, tell me what you thinkthanks in advancethe market might fall still and take vz with it?"
"Verizon, corporate overlords of this Yahoo site, sponsor censorship of political speech. There is no ""free speech"" in their corporate amusement park. It's just a playpen for fools."
Stil a great investment and it's not to late
Is this the bottom yet? It could go up before market closing
"Say OH NO down VZ goes has to much debt and no future , VZ is now a communist company run by Han's and tthe EU one world order CENSORING yahoo Natzi's that are now running off both customers and shareholders as fast as they can. IF it was not bad enough VZ has been losing customers to T's monster new cell plans with FREE HBO MAX"
"$vz is worse. They bought yahoo only to write it off, just like yahoo buying tumblr and writing it off. There should be a competition: Which CEO has destroyed the most shareholder value?"
"A 59 year old woman was brutally murdered by a man ICE tried to deport 9 times. But LA authorities would not turn the guy over, and let him out of jail. The main reason for sanctuary cities is to help bring in high numbers of people, so companies like the Koch Brothers, Verizon and Comcast have lots of cheap labor. As a Verizon shareholder, think about this woman, and think about your investment. this stuff happens every day. and your investment, and your demand for profits at any cost, enable it."
SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING BOUGHT ANOTHER 1000
"finally bought in a while back at 48 and watched it drop since. I am a buy and hold investor but I thought I had a good entry point. I will have some patience and enjoy the 5% div but lets go Verizon. My bottom feeding with VZ, GE, and IBM has not paid off yet."
Verizon - Your Yahoo internet site has turned into a complete leftist fake news editorial site. It is not a news site.
"There was Fed Speak today on interest rates. That's what caused the drop in all utility stocks today. Fed not lowering rates but, not raising either. All is ok with this sector as long as rates remain low. imho"

It’s highest in recent monthsLet’s see the squeeze tomorrow morning, maybe tonight already. Large buy ~150k shares to cover per minute."
"How would the tax break savings of 16+ billion in savings from Q4 going to affect things, something like $4.11 per share?"
"Lead story on Verizon's Yahoo this morning, 12/3/2020 at 5:10 AM PST: ""Trump supporters evoke threat of 'shooting civil war'"". Hans, what the he|| is this $h|+? Yahoo is basically suggesting there should be a shooting civil war. I'm not hearing this on ANY other media outlet - CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox News, even (GASP!) CNN. So why are you ""manufacturing"" a problem? And yes, that's what this is. This shareholder is #$%$ OFF seeing this type of $h|+. Maybe this is why Verizon stock is mired at $60 a share, meanwhile TMUS is full speed ahead (and NOT burdened with a pile of Media $h|+ like Verizon)."
"LOL,LOL,LOL OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL Told you to only sell any move higher LOL,LOL,LOL"

"Yahoo Finance, here thanks to Verizon, today has a story, on the summary page, from Fidelity. The heading says stocks have high valuations, and may be ready for a pull back. If Fidelity is handling your funds, you should pull out of them, as this article is 2 months late. But then, why would you expect companies that are pushing globalism, to be looking out for your best interest."
Verizon's poor performance is very simple. it's supply and demand. Verizon has a business model on better service and higher premiums. but lately many other companies have an equal service for less premium. so of course with less demand and more supply stock is losing. but VZ is a long play. look 1-2 years out to 5g. it will increase market demand.
Or it might finally break out!
I own VZ and T. Debt is the major problem. They shouldn't be buying back stock. Pay off the debt and maintain the dividend will help support the price. If we get into an inflation spiral debt ridden companies will pay when its time to refinance.

Yahoo is owned by Verizon so any article they write for Vz is filled with _________ (fill in the blank)
"I wonder how much of a hit Yahoo! ad revenue is taking now that they've disabled chats and comments on their articles? I used to check out the comments frequently, somehow the comments often cut to the core more quickly and truthfully than the articles themselves. Also often quite entertaining seeing the two sides bash each other on political stuff. I've barely been on Yahoo! as much as I used to now that comments are gone. I only check the finance section now."
"Hey VZ shareholders and employees. Can you ensure VZ does a heavy marketing campaign next week alongside Apple Iphone 12 announcement event next week which will be its first 5g phone? This will be the first 5g exposure for many consumers given some 40-50% of phones are Iphones.VZ can then go on a marketing spree to ensure those people in places where their 5g is live, that they are going to have wayyyyy better performance under them then AT&T and TMUS. https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/06/usa/mobile-network-experience-5gThe 5g exposure from Apple + confirmation of superiority by VZ in markets served should cause a healthy transition of clients over to VZ. Those geographies that don't have 5g from VZ yet shouldn't see any material changes up/down in terms of subscribers until VZ 5g is there. This is a net positive event for VZ. Don't blow your opportunity VZ team."
VZ Buy Hand  over !
"Buy low, sell lower? Avoid VZ at all cost...."

"VZ now has to cut the dividend to try and pay down debt , because VZ is losing millions and millions of customers now"
"LOL,LOL SAY OH NO down VZ goes , Why because VZ was not smart enough to know they need to change the company for the new 5 G world they now face . VZ has no future in that world as the high cost producer LOL,LOL,LOL"

Now the so called professional analysts are spreading more rumors than the message boards?
Stock getting crushed since the merger news. Why doesnt the CEO speak up and say something??
"Verizon's Yahoo is reporting in their top banner story this morning (10/5/2020 5:12 AM PST) that ""Trump's Medical Condition is a Guessing Game Right Now"". No, it's not. The WSJ just reported he may be released as early as today. Same with the NY Times, the LA Times, and several other top tier news sources. Bottom line...Yahoo employees are prone to ""wishful thinking"" and blindly following an extreme left agenda. That has no place for a company who needs to focus their resources on their WIRELESS NETWORK and the services that go with it. Hans, time to WAKE UP and dump the Yahoo piece of $h|+ and the whole media group."
CWA beats company to a pulp. Congratulations!
Great reviews and feedback
"Carry on the Yahoo tradition of dumbing down the site. Now ""InPlay"" no longer works. % gainers and losers broke a couple of weeks ago. I go to WSJ for that info now. Unbelievable."

As a customer I have had really bad experiences with this company. And I don’t think it’s a company with any intelligence. Stupid decisions one followed by another. It won’t last long because it’s not fair to other excellent players
"@Spartan55 you will learn to say OH NO DOWN VZ goes , LOL,LOL and you will also learn that today was the dawning of a new day as Corporation like McDonalds started paying bonuses to be racist and discriminate against white , Whites have had the only law on the books that was a racist law and it was against them Affirmative Action , but today is a new day for Affirmative Action where Corporations like McDonalds started paying bonuses to be RACIST and Discriminate against White people , So yes it's the dawning of a new day . How do you think that is going to help or hurt race relations in the future? I have already seen the future so I know what happens next. What do you think is going to happen in the future?"

What I don't understand about this company is that it needs lot of Capex that makes me thinking .I am interested in the company but may be I need more time to think about it. Another thing I am not sure who will be the players in Broadband and cell because even big tech is some how into broadband infrastructure and don't know future of cellphones services.
"Not surprised VZ ""leadership"" didn't do proper due diligence."
Does anyone know if they have cut the dividends or suspended them?
From +$1.50 in after hours to -.20 now. Nobody but VZ could pull this off.

Starting to look like an attractive entry point. Any thoughts?
"Sold short 23000 share at 58.44.Guys, if you haven’t identified the patterns by now, you shouldn’t be trading any stock at all.1. Saw the flash dip today? This bubbly stock market is looking for any reason and catalyst to sell and take some profit.2. Saw what happened to INTC and all other big names that have reported their earnings recently, they all experienced post ER sell off.INTC had superb earnings report, but still sold off like crazy.The only one to the exception was NFLX.Do whatever you want with your money!"
"Wow, I got a message on my recorder today. It was the folks that handle Vz’s 401k. She was top management, and even the wife said she was quite nasty. She wanted to know what I wanted to do with this inactive account? The brokerage houses are cutting fees across the board. Big competition to get folks out of their 401k, and into the higher commission accounts. VZ 401k fees are on the lower end. Last time when she called, she wanted me to consider bonds. No thanks, told her Warren Buffett has never held a bond. And in a sense, I did consider Vz my bond. Non callable, and a great rate too. This is definitely a port in a storm."

"Verizon Communications Inc. said it expects to book a nearly $17 billion gain in its fourth-quarter profit due to the new tax law.

Verizon will record the reduction as a one-time gain boosting earnings."
"White House announcement regarding 5G today. Apparently going to auction more spectrum, but the big news is the issue of deployment throughout the US. Might bump the predominant players if they come up with a federal plan to help the rollout, to prevent local governments from gouging on the roll out. Again IMHO"
Welcome to our club Mr. Buffet!
"Why buy this stock - Debt is out of control, Do we really need 5G and is it safe, continued heavy involvement is woke causes and liberal propaganda, cheaper competition with very little service differential. This stock is a CLASSIC value trap. IMHO"
why are we Not hearing in the news about Verizon special cell phone service drone plane providing cell phone service to the hurricane victims. probably because it was a lie
Who thought that VZ beat Earning?
"That was ugly. 2.5X normal daily volume, large # of blocks, several call options covered (mine included). Just ugly. Long term Verizon is fine, but the short term looks, well, rough. Hans, you better be spot-on with your 5G investments, IoT and similar value-add strategy, plus continue to monetize Media division (I'm betting it goes down next quarter because the election is over and thus less eyeballs on Yahoo)."

"Alright VZ up is a great chance to sell even more of this communist company that takes away Americans First Amendment right. VZ can no longer be trusted to protect your First Amendment rights and they can no longer be trusted to protect you data , By the Companies own actions of CENSORING Americans and CENSORING what Americans can see , read and post. NEVER EVER do Business with VZ again . Find a company that protects your First Amendment rights and protects your data . You can not trust T Mobile either they are a foreign company and only looking out for the EU's one world order and will use any data they can to farther the EU one world order agenda even if that means destroying the USA."
"With more and more people cocooning at home instead of going out, and companies asking their employees to work from home from all the virus fears, companies like VZ that provide the network infrastructure to allow that are going to be huge beneficiaries. Even with the expensive 5G rollout this stock is now STUNNINGLY CHEAP."

Please look into verizon, and T. I believe they are both corrupt, wiling to gamble with our information, and looking for short term profits at any expense."

"Hammer Fiber Optics' (OTCQB: HMMR) patented AIR System was designed around and is based on ultra-high-frequency MMDS (multichannel multipoint distribution system), utilizing frequency division duplexing for upstream and downstream (200 MHz spacing). This enables a single transmission to be shared by multiple independent signals. With such efficient use of the spectrum, Hammer's AIR System can handle two separate signals at once across a wide range of frequencies (from 3 GHz to 39 GHz), meaning spectrum in different frequencies and channels can be processed by one transceiver. This pre-5G platform is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant and is scalable to DOCSIS 3.1, allowing for speeds of 1 Gb/s and up."
"Love VZ long term, but they better make some moves. Non-telecom moves."
"VZ has not made the moves to compete in the future, Why because their management did not have the vision or the guts to make the changes that are needed to compete in the future. They took the easy and safe way out and will have a long slow death like Kodak did. Just my opinion . Just some old nut that has watch to many great companies die over the years ,because the managements never had the vision or the guts to do what's need done until it was always to late. Good luck if your still a VZ shareholder, Why because T's has built a MONSTER that is getting ready to feed on anything in it's path. Just remember what I have said about waiting until it's to late to compete in the future as VZ starts losing more and more customers"
"Did a little more digging on the Berkshire Hathaway purchase. It's clear it's Warren looking for CD/bond returns with stable stocks. I don't expect BH to do anything with Verizon other than to monitor the quality of the cash flow. I do know, however, that Warren has a habit of reaching out to the CEO's of the companies where he has strategic investments (and the billions invested in Verizon would qualify), and I would expect him to have had such a conversation with Hans by now. In that regard, Warren (hopefully) will pass along some of his sage advice about not ticking off your customers and in fact finding ways to ""wow"" them. Yahoo, no matter what your political leanings are, is basically p|$$|ng off half of Americans. Many have figured out that Verizon owns Yahoo, so guess what? They're going to go to AT&T or T-Mobile instead. Just think if Verizon jettisoned Yahoo? I wonder what the opportunity cost is to Verizon? Let's explore it for a moment:Right now AT&T has 175 million postpaids. T-Mobile has 100 million and Verizon 95 million. For the sake of argument, let's assume that 10 million each at AT&T and T-Mobile are there because they don't like the political views of Verizon. The average postpaid cell bill is $100 per month (CNBC, 10/25/2019 report). So that's $1200 per year. Multiply that by 20 million, and you get $24 BILLION dollars in revenue.Let's see ... Verizon currently at roughly $132 billion, add another $24 billion, you're at $156 billion, or an increase of 18%. The cash flow on that would be phenomenal, because you're likely above all fixed costs, so it's all variable at this point.So how about it, Verizon board of directors? Have you TRULY looked at the OPPORTUNITY COST of holding a STRONG POLITICAL VIEWPOINT with your Media division holdings? Is it REALLY WORTH IT? I submit to you, probably not. So why not spend $50-100K and do a thorough study to FIND OUT? Seems like money well spent to this shareholder..."
VZ the company without a future and has no way to compete in the new world they now face as VZ now loses customers more and more everyday to T's 5G monster they have built. FACTS are FACTS and action speak volumes So get ready to say OH NO down VZ goes

Hammer Fiber Optics (HMMR) is pre 5G telecom player that can get into more rural areas other telecoms cant. They have spectrum in 3 to 3.5 Ghz they recently acquired and could easily become buyout target from larger player
"I call Verizon bull on 20 million trees. They cut down trees for a better 5G signal in cities, so are they feeling guilty? I think not and their 5G has not been tested by newer standards.FCC guidelines have not changed since 1996, but our exposure to EMF’s are tenfold"
"Another open letter to Hans...It's fascinating to look at the effective ground game Trump is running right now. Quinnipiac over the weekend acknowledged this, as they did another survey in ""swing"" states like FL and OH. What they found is NOT being reported by Verizon's lovely darlings Yahoo or Huffington Post, which is there is a very angry ""white"" crowd (mostly males from 30 to 59) who are fed up with all of the garbage that has been going on this year, and are going to fight back with their vote. I expect to see very long lines at the voting polls, with a higher percentage voting Trump rather than ""not Trump"" (Biden really isn't a candidate, he represents ""not Trump""). Even Real Clear Politics is weighing in on this one, saying the Democrat ground game is weak:https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/29/miami-voter-turnout-democrats-433643This is playing out in numerous ""swing"" states right now. What does this mean for Verizon? If ""not Trump"" loses tomorrow, expect properties like Yahoo, Huffington Post, and similar ""extreme left"" entities to lose a lot of value."

"The composite analyst est for 2018 is $4.54 Operating EPS so VZ is trading at 10.7x this years operating cash flow. Given growing revenue VZ is the conservative income equity I want to own.

I’m back and I gave you ACTC yesterday and it’s up 100%. I have you CKWD and it’s up 100%. F BZ AND BE LIKE ME. RETIRED CWA SOLD ALL VZ AND QUADRUPLED SINCE DECEMBER 1St. THE CEO AND BOARD ARE LAZY FAT SLOTHS AND REFUSE TO LISTTTO COMMON SENSE. 5G IS DEAD BEFORE IT EVER STARTED. LOOK UP SKY-PHONE. APPLE HAS PATENT CAUSE THEY KNOW VERIZON GOING TO 40’s and LOWER FAST. HURRY BEFORE YOR RETIRES LOSE YOUR SHIRTS AND BUY SIRC CLWD and you made you losses back
"Pension fund managers should be buying VZ heavily.This band of elitists, who typically avoid Military Service,are wrong more than they are right."
Is the 115B debt owed by VZ holding back the stock price? I don't see any other explanation. Please advise.
"all wireless carriers monthly fee looks very strong support, no more discount, so their stock going up are not 5g networks, it's good earnings, I think their earnings better than expected, all wireless carriers can up 15percent after earnings report."
"I wonder what statistical evidence VZ has for how forcing the closure of the yahoo $NIO board Will actually impact the direction of the stock. Kind of impressive that they've placed so much importance on it. $VZ should be broken up, btw."
PE is very low buy buy
What will $Sprint numbers actually be? Below Per @WaltBTIG on 4-30-19. Q1 Post-paid phone net additions $TMUS +656k $CHTR +176k$CMCSA +170k $VZ -44k $T -55k$S no report date set
"The analyst who downgraded is a moron, terrible track record, it’s amazing he’s still employed.....double down...."
YAHOO = Dishonesty.
"Spartan55 both you and Jennifer are going to lose lots of money So GET ready to SAY OH NO DOWN VZ goes , just like it should as they loses even more customers and shareholder from their own action. Just the way it will be. VZ can NO LONGER be TRUSTED and that is more powerful than all of Warrens money"
Tomorrow blowout earnings before market open
Business model is breaking down for the market. It likes revenue options other than 5G.
Why the big reversal? What happened?
PRHL looks poised to move higher again. This company is in the deregulated energy space and has been dropping tons of press recently. PRHL could be huge
All the talk on 5 G and my connection has slowed down considerably? Any one else have this occuring?
Letssss goooio
where is my buddy COCO??????
"Herman Cain to Trump, ""Come on down."""
bring back are old portfolio this is terrible .
If you buy VZ on Jan. 8th and sell it on the 11th. will you still get the dividend?
VZ reached a 52 Week low at 53.65
wdve thought telecomm stocks would be immune to sell off. Any reasons why it isnt?
"Verizon shareholders, look to the right. See the Yahoo Finance story where Elizabeth Warren is angering Blacks. Trying to divide the country. This is what liberals do. This is what Verizon is doing. My high cheek bones are saddened that any conservative would own Verizon stock, and help push this anger mongering."
Lost $.62 on paper Friday but received $.615 in cash. It's not an offset to me. But the cash is a good thing. I do expect VZ's share price to sail forward in the future as we shake off C-19. This June will mark the 10th anniversary of my owning VZ. I bought a chunk at $26.05. I believe I've collected about $22 of cash dividends on those shares. If VZ hits $61.55 in June at that price the $35.50 cap gain will represent an annual return of 9% compounded. VZ has to rank very high on the list of investment grade buy and hold bond equivalents coming out of the Great Recession. It's probably #1 when you add in the annual cash return -- call it 4% - 5%. Some bond managers may have super track records with net investor returns at VZ's buy and hold level but it's much easier to have a part of your income portfolio in VZ. Looking out over the next 10 years I expect it to be the same or better than the last 10 years as wireless revenues grow and the wireline drag disappears. Happy Saturday from the sunny southern vanguard breaking free of C-19. Wish us luck...
anyone else having trouble with the yahoo finance app after vz shut down oath? my stock search feature is broke over several devices.
Back to back and forth trading games. Just tank and catch them all about a thousand points.
Orderly liquidation continues. Grrrr!
"VZ never fails to disappoint on earnings. That's been Hans WOKE Vestberg's history unfortunately. He's too concerned with bizarre European (he's Swedish after all) leftist politics to do things that elevate the stock price. What does he care, he has hundreds of millions already."
"Losing patience. I first bought Verizon shares for my IRA in mid April 2013. The cost basis per share just happened to be exactly $50.00 Over six years later the share price is only $55.87. I realize Verizon pays a substantial dividend, and that certainly improves one's returns, but still, in a period that should've been a perfect environment for stocks, (solid economy, low interest rates, etc) the share price only appreciates by around $6.00 ?Considering selling & investing the proceeds in VIG. A 5-year shows VIG +57% - VZ +12%I don't think yahoo charts take dividend reinvestment into account, & VZ's -year-old is much higher, which would tighten things up a bit, but still nothing to brag about."
"5% and 12pe, I'll hold til 5g."
"VZ floats $12b and nobody bats an eye -- timing looks very nice. There is going to be some paydown of maturing debt. Any way you slice it VZ is adding valuable spectrum. Supported by VZ results -- about a 24% trailing 12 month operating margin which is way out in front of T & TMUS...""Caleb Mutua and Scott MoritzTue, November 10, 2020, 5:18 PM EST(Bloomberg) -- Verizon Communications Inc. sold $12 billion of bonds in the fifth largest transaction of the year as blue-chip companies rushed to squeeze in debt sales following optimistic news Monday regarding a potential Covid-19 vaccine.The telecommunications giant sold the debt in five parts, with proceeds earmarked for spectrum costs and repayment of outstanding obligations, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the offering, a $2 billion 40-year security, yields 1.3 percentage points above Treasuries, after initial discussions of around 1.5 percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.The largest U.S. wireless carrier needs more airwaves in order to keep up with the growing demand for network capacity. The company is pouring billions of dollars into 5G network expansion. This next generation of wireless technology promises dramatically higher speeds and instant response times to facilitate breakthroughs in fields such as robotic surgery and autonomous cars.Verizon spent nearly $2 billion on 5G spectrum lease rights at a federal auction in September, and the company is expected to spend a lot more in the C-band auction which begins Dec. 8.“The C-band spectrum is a ‘must-have’ for Verizon, so investors should consider the possibility that Verizon spends $20 billion or more,” CreditSights analysts led by Davis Hebert wrote in a note Tuesday.Verizon led five borrowers tapping the investment-grade market Tuesday to take advantage of Monday’s broad rally after President-elect Joe Biden’s victory and better than expected news from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE on the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Nine borrowers priced $18.9 billion Monday, the largest single-day volume total since Sept. 23.Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the Verizon bond sale, the person said."""
"Dang... I already allocated my $$$. Otherwise, I'd buy more Vz. Cell phone usage, data usage, is not slowing at all."

"Paid bashing, quiet interesting"
VZ ended GREEN. By a big one cent -- beats a 7% drop!Now everybody knows -- best bond equivalent going.
someone tells yahoo and aol.....i already give them 2emails to prevent lock-out.....i do NOT have anymore email to give.
Yahoo is killing Verizon. It must be shuttered. VZ will go nowhere until then.
Somewhere over the rainbow verizon flies away.
verizon sucks
Any predictions at what price this stock will end at this year?Any chance of a dividend increase?
Vz has a huge opportunity to refi debt here... should improve cash flow long term!
"Yahoo/Verizon pukes continue to block conservative opinion at every turn because they are COWARDS. Yet they run utterly and completely biased leftist news at every turn. What anti-American losers. Next will come some twerp ""anonymous"" to attempt an insult of some kind. What pathetic losers they are."
VZ is cheap at 6.52PE why the slide backwards?
Is there any silver lining?
"I'am a combat vet....Korea..53/54...7th Div,31 reg G co. I used to be a DEM,however, though-out my life,I have seen many changes including the demise of the democratic party. They are no longer the the democratic party but the socialist party and the next step is to be communist.My time is on the downhill side now so I ask you not for me but for the future of our country to vote Republican."
I wonder how many people Verizon will layoff so that it can both pay Yahoo's $750 million fine to Mozilla AND allow Lowell to get his $15 million bonus for another unsuccessful year.
"Why is Verizon (VZ) down on the day plans for Samsung-Verizon 5G phone was announced? I don't know except that it did not excite investors. Verizon has increased plans to roll out 5G in more places. However, the comp0any will initially use the 39 GHz spectrum. It is 'more than just that' but the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) spectra limits the coverage and building penetration. While Verizon can claim to have 'mobile 5G' once the handset is available, that is a figurative statement designed to position the marketing image. In truth 5G, a very fungible word these days (the word truth), nobody will have 5G until about half of people can use it where they live, work and visit. By that measure, Verizon will not have mobile 5G until the end of 2020 or later."
What a pitiful performance.
Rolled over my $52.50 August call options to Sept $55 Call Options.
Costumers base increased and ready for the big leap in 5g in 2020.
"When I saw Verizon post the Manafort story of how he spent several million dollars to fix his home, I looked up info about Verizon management. We all know how US companies take advantage of their workers, lets see how they take advantage of their poor customers, to earn their big salaries. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/are-the-salaries-of-veriz_b_9815496.html"
Can we close green?
"Hey Hans, here's the latest ""wonderful"" headline on your Yahoo asset:""A scary number' of retail companies are facing bankruptcy amid the coronavirus pandemic""Of course they are! Heck, Yahoo (and related media companies) have scared the bejesus out of everyone with the virus, to the point where they're afraid to even look out the window, let alone venture out of their homes. What did you think would happen? Idiots..."
"Wake up folks! Save thousands with the best service an price Sprint, no games,"
sold my 17500 #$%$ 59.88. including the div. I made $18400 profit. Now I'll wait for the next screaming buy.
"As King Trump controls the FDA, CDC and the Post Office where is your anger?"
Sell TSLA buy VZ that is smart idea!
I think the wheels are coming off the T-Mobile Sprint deal. T-Mobile is figuring out Sprint is not worth the debt load.
Q3 Pre-paid net adds $T +588k $TMUS +35k$S -14k $VZ -96k
Their 5G is a failure..
Big boys selling the run-up on VZ to raise cash for lift IPO.
This stock seems to move without any rhyme or reason.
"Yahoo Finance, the globalist arm of Verizon, finally tells a true story. That many people purposely turned off NFL games this season. Yes, its true. I watched about 12 hours this season, and usually watch 2 full games a week. The best part is Kapaernick says neither side has the answers. Yet Mr. Trump already put over 120,000 Blacks to work since Nov 2016., more than Obama did in 8 years. Yes, Kapaernick doesn't have any ideas, other than to show disrespect. Now take the guy from the Oakland Raiders, who hired a chef, and goes to a bridge, and makes meals for the homeless living there. Kapaernick was brought up in ignorance. Probably brought up in a family that didn't show him any love or respect. But others are doing things to help. Showing disrespect tells me I'd be a fool to follow NFL players, and root for them. When I see players kneel, I sometimes hope an ISIS truck driver drives his truck on the field, and we see Kapernick go run and hide behind a Police Officer."
VZ CEO stops free speech on Yahoo. Way to go do you belong to that former WW II German political party?
can't believe this stock. having a hard time deciding which is worst VZ or T
Time has come for the RNC to sue VZ and Yahoo for censoring and removing post that favored Trump. It was really bad this morning you could tell that some employee at Yahoo was trying to control and remove all the post that favored Trump. Yahoo is now trying to control the outcome of the election by removing posts.
fb amzn alphabet all doing great today. this makes no sense. they all had a run up into earnings they are the ones that should be selling the news. there was no run up here and we are the ones in the red. I'm so tired of this. just buy the opposite of me you will be rich. I cant catch a break 
"I thought about buying AT&T untill I heard they have a ton of debt. They are looking to sell Direct TV to raise cash. If VZ get near $55.00 I will place a limit order for that. Also VZ has not declared a dividend yet! It does have a decent dividend, its just not a growth stock."
Big boysaccumulating here
Wonder why Verizon is down this morning after a good report ?
"I recommend Verizon to buy Vonage, which now owns Nexmo intergrate the technologies and gain ""A set of cloud-based communication APIs designed to remove the pain of integrating with multiple carriers – and take you global in the blink of an eye.' which will address the adoption they must make going forward."
It's no longer funny..every day we drop in this market...is there send r when we All die by 1000 a day drops
"Up $,80?Tomorrow is ex-dividend day.A vote of confidence?Or is it just that the market is in rally mode?I'll take the bounce anyway you look at it."
Ready for the climb back up to $60+
Immediate investor day announcement for tomorrow shows great confidence in the plan moving forward.
Sold #VZ morning buy. Holding #DUST for eod.
Verizon is slowly creeping back upwards! Don't miss the boat!!
Verizon signals its Yahoo and AOL divisions are almost worthless.Couldnt be pizz poor reporting???
TMUS and S getting together? good for VZ
"Just hit refresh and it goes down worse and worse, pathetic stock."
I think the analysts are wrong. I think Verizon has tremendous growth potential. analysts only see current numbers. they aren't taking into account being the first and only provider in the 5g game come 2018. imagine what partnerships would emerge. imagine the increased market share
Cable firm? Frontier and not Charter??? Just speculating because of FTR's attractive valuation.
"Keep in mind that we have a new CEO (August) and he is getting rid of the non profit junk and is laser focused on 5g.Many are calling 5g the fourth industrial revolution.Great new stuff.....IOT,vituual reality and so much more possibilities are in the pipeline for VZ.not to even mention the good dividend.Short term dips are buying opportunities."
"Hey VZ CEO, this is what a real leader looks like!"
what became of VZ preferred?
Buy Visl !!!
Time to make serious $$$$ Better drop big money on RCAR
"I know it's becoming the norm, but down 5% two days? , wow."
Anyone think we see 60 next week?
"Verizon Communications Drops EBILLS service with Banks AFTER they get you to go Paperless NoW they wantt to INCREASE PRICES WITH NO EXPLANATION and you have 30 days to Appeal WTH?Have Glaucoma Cant see computer Billing unless it is ENLARGED or I now MUST GO BACK TO PAPER BILLING, CANT SEE LED TYPE in order to Log in (legally Blinmd) They do this all of a Sudden to their customers???They tell me to Donload a FIOS App I liove in RURAL AREA where U wont give me FIOS u MFrs.."

Huge 0.07% gains from earnings beat
"Go ""Big Red"".....5G is the future and VZ will be the leader. Their unlimited plan just saved me $160.00 on three lines. They are the real deal........."
"Any thoughts on the barrons article? I believe it was barrons this morning talking about the telecom landscape. A twist I never thought, is a comment about Verizon being taken over by the cable companies. Seems Comcast, altice, or charter could be players. After thinking about it, it makes sense, VZ stock in the toilet even though they have great assets. Section off the wireless and combine the wireline with other dominant companies in the region. If regulatory is ok, Verizon gets chopped up. Weird I thought it the other way around, I geuss theres always a bigger fish out there."

"Satellite operators believe 5G will be a huge opportunity, but for wireless players the opportunity will undoubtedly be even bigger. Ericsson, a major player in the 5G arena, publishes a regular mobility report, which looks at the state of the market. Joakim Sorelius, head of 5G and Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture at Ericsson, told Via Satellite that even he found some of the findings of its latest research “quite astonishing.”“Firstly, there will be more than half a billion 5G subscriptions by 2022. In only a few years, we expect 5G to take off quite quickly. Twenty-five percent of all subscriptions will be 5G in North America in 2022, representing the highest market penetration in the world. Then you will have Asia-Pacific, with 10 percent of all subscriptions taken out in 2022 expected to be 5G, and especially the northern part of Asia. The whole of Asia will see 10 percent penetration but in the north and northeast, it will be more in the range of the U.S. numbers. That is markets like South Korea, Japan and China,” he added.Satellite operators believe 5G will be a huge opportunity, but for wireless players the opportunity will undoubtedly be even bigger.

"YEP- after we broke 23,300 the floor has opened.LL EVERYTHING YOU HAVE OR LOSE BADLY ANOTHER 10-15%.thats what the ""experts say"". I will gladly take your stock soon- I have many years left and these prices are very good after a 25% tank. Enjoy the seafood and have some hard liquor because its going to get worse before better."
Have you seen what Yahoo did with earnings date and divided yield. Check around at some other stocks .
Here's a fascinating read!http://www.nasdaq.com/article/will-verizons-vz-acquisition-of-niddel-be-a-major-boon-cm901568
VZ completes acquisition of Straight Path Communications.
"Verizon's problem is that the U.S. wireless market is saturated. Most consumers have unlimited data plans. They're upgrading smartphones at a slow rate. Plus, data-gobbling mobile video hasn't panned out as a big moneymaker."
Decided to cut my losses on VZ and bought TQQQ instead.
"Thank you Verizon, your support for the Oscars helped make it a lift off last night."
#RDS.A ended green....bought @$43.30.....anybody jump onboard? #DUST trade? #VZ flip?......everyone just in shock?.....buying penny miners....that's the extent of your brain power?
"For disclosure, I own small amounts of VZ stock in two different accounts. My first question to this board is does Verizon own Yahoo? If so, my second question is why doesn't Yahoo allow for comments on its articles anymore. I have been critical of Ricky (TDS) Newman and others with their biased and untruthful reporting. Have I been blocked from commenting? Another attempt to silence all opposing free speech."
Can you believe Seeking Alpha still negative with VZ? They now are #$%$ that they paid too much for the NFL package and gave up on not being able to finance the dividend!
I’m coming in heavy at this price
whole market system broke here.
"If you are a DEM wit without and brain and can not see the writing on the Wall , you will need to be out of VZ before the next earnings report . Because the next earning report is going to crush the stock price because it will show just how many customers VZ is now losing everyday and with 3 months of all loses that number of customers that have left VZ is going to be a very BIG number. Just the way it is and you don't even need to make stuff up when no one company can now compete with the MONSTER T has built. FACT"
Well another day Verizon up and AT&T down. Nothing new really.
thats a lot of debt
Verizon should sever merger with yahoo or massively lower merger offer in light of repeated hacking.
If Verizon was a pen-is it wouldn't be a grower or a shower. just an old wrinkly one that can't maintain an erection
"I spent some time last night looking at the source code for a variety of Yahoo web pages. I'm really beginning to appreciate the complaints people make regarding how slow their machines run. Yahoo pages are, at least in my humble view, bloated with code. Contrast that to Google who, even with all their tracking, keeps it to a minimum. Same goes for a number of other social media websites. So my view is Yahoo is more of a social engineering website than a social media website. Maybe if they cut down on the ""bloatware"" and moderate their views it could improve the overall experience and drive more traffic to its website? ....... NAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH......"
Drop seems rather harsh to me considering the facts - I thought the recent drop would have included any negative news. Hoping for a bounce later in the week
Hope you got in on this morning dip. Only going higher from here.
"VZ the company without a future. Say OH NO down VZ goes . LOL,LOL,LOL"
Where is the bottom?
"Just because this 91 year old Has been bought this doesn't mean #$%$...second just because you don't like a stock to go long doesn't mean it's a candidate for a short position. Why are some ppl so stupid ? VZ missed their earnings, TMO with the Sprint tower infrastructure and low prices and better 5G strategy is better positioned. VZ i see trading in a range 5 years from now $45 to $56"
Hans Vestburg on CNBC he is a B ESER....Talking around the 5 G coverage. Ultra Wide Band < 1% nationwide coverage.....Their commercials make it sound like meaningful coverage nationwide. Hans is full of SHt.....Watch his interview.

"Well, this sell off is a little excessive"
Took my profit.
It's going to be: Yahoo! the Place for Sports!I assume some of the 1 bil Yahoo users will notice NFL games. The next steps should include developing premium services. I'm on Yahoo! all the time and I would pay for custom finance features. A next step could be Yahoo! TV to compete with T's DirecTV-Now which I subscribe to...
Go Verizon
"“The wheels on Verizon spin round and round, round and round, round and round”........how long has this donkey hovered in the 40s and low 50s with all the shills touting how high it will go. SPIN ON VERIZON, SPIN ON!!!"
Why so much politics here. Posters should be muted.
"VZ has become a Communist Company with Han's in charge and he has installed the EU's one world order as the Yahoo Natzi's Censor Americans and take away your First Amendment right , Just like restaurants put up signs No Black Allowed . Same No different what VZ is now doing and what Restaurants did in the past."
"VZ and their CENSORSHIP over Yahoo is trying to destroy America , Why because VZ is now controlled by the EU right HAN's and their one world order."
Phone sales going to suffer from a shortage?
VZ has the best cell service hands down. Buying more at $53. I own T as well.
"SOLID, SOLID as a rock......VZ"
"Finally bought a bit of this ""Cramer Fave"" @ 44.60. I'm now a fellow bagholder."
VZ broke and closed over 52 which was above the resistance of $51.60. This’ll be back over 52 this week. Bought some Aug 10 52 calls this afternoon.

VZ needs to get rid of AOL & Yahoo. Both are albatrosses that will continue to erode VZ's base.
Roller coaster today.
"How about globalist company Verizon, which uses yahoo finance and business insider to help thwart the dreams of 62 million American patriots, who voted for the President. Yet Verizon lied to pennsylvania when they promised to build a fiber optic network in the state in 1993, and instead rolled out DSL on existing copper lines. Yet under a one world government, Verizon management would be sent to hard labor prison camps, instead of being allowed to run the companies that helped them steal hundreds of millions from state ratepayers."
"VZ getting as incompetent as ATT,impossible to do business with and highly confusing. The ball always falls on their side. Every little .65 cent charge they purposely and often wrongly push on customers will soon destroy what was a profitable company."
The new Tax Bill will benefit VZ bigly. :-)
Fed has no clue once again. They did the same thing last time. Whole system will collapse with these stupid rate cuts.
This might sell off as economy gets goingagain after vaccines. Wouldn’t mind adding 70 shares
"Now that the market is tanking 500 points a day, it's moved from Obama's to Trump's. It's Biden's only on up days."
Now everyone wants VZ and T. Silly how the tune changes. I thought their whole business models were in jeopardy two weeks ago?
VZ is so undervalued.......should be trading in the mid 60s.
"Verizon needs to advertise that we are an American Company who employ thousands with many of them Union jobs that pay decent wages unlike our ""German"" owned competitor. Somehow this always seems to be forgotten. Go BIG RED."
"How can you be bullish on a stock that missed the train on 5g networking. There lucky to have a jjob after this major screw-up. I'm reconsideriing my holdings with these clowns, high ghz. wireless spectrum with a range of 600 feet, and can't penetrate windows or walls really really really, unbelievable."
LOVE VZ!!!
"Why is the PE ratio so low? Less than 7, for a super stable company with a high dividend. It looks like the growth is relatively flat, but still."
AACQ is making BIODEGRADABLE BOTTLES FOR PEPSI and NESTLE WATERS. BETTER THAN VZ
"FB, Apple, Google and the basket of tech is purging...THAT money, is moving into Telecom and others - hence the 3 dollar uptick in about as many days."
cooocoo is in love with his left hand
"VZ= ""W"" pattern forming , although short... right shoulder forming, if it takes out 61.59 see u at 69take a look- could happen"
same old games just trading. Will FEderal Reserve raise or lower rates. I think leave them where they are. Whole system has been manipulated for last 11 years. All this keeping rates low to make investors chase higher return in stock markets. Enough of this they have screwed savers for last 11 years period. All games back and forth will they or wont they. i say sell off and crash this whole manipulated system with the Fed.
"Very Bearish outlook ahead in 2021, should test $50 or below within next few weeks."
"Oh I see what's happening, every one of you slimy leeches jumping on for the upcoming dividends yeah?!!I don't blame you it's one hell of a dividend!!"
"Don't matter, it is and always will be a BUM STOCK. Totally pointless to own VZ."

Why do you think the stock is dropping? They are losing video subscribers.
The Yahoo deal is turning into a PR disaster for VZ. I thought VZ had good management but this whole deal makes me question my investment thesis.
"I sold my shares 18 months ago. Of the stocks I have owned, this was one of my favorites."
"2 yr chart says $54 is great support area...and $62 is resistance. A 4.5% divy, ..with a reasonable P.E. ...and the 5g story is good enough a position here."
"I had Comcast, what a rip off, good luck with what is going to happen to you later Harry, how long did you have to sign up for?"

At&t Just Stole the Spectrum Licenses from FCC from Fibertower .. .I wonder if Verizon know this...
"CLNE Clean energy fuels is one of the leading provider of CNG and LNG fuels. It’s partners with chevron, Total and now BP. Clean Energy is contracted by the New York MTA, New York Sanitation, UPS, FedX and other companies in the United States and Canada."

"rich young USDOJ Antitrust division is aware that Verizon, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner are involved in fraud, collusion, Racketeering complaint they are trying to keep secret from all employees, shareholders, state and federal regulators they know can cost into the tens of billions or more. News of this and USDOJ will cause the merger of AT&T/Time Warner not to be approved. Contact Rich Young USDOJ to confirm along with SEC."
"Jennifer the problem you really don't understand is VZ has picked a side and started CENSORING the over side , The problem is 1/2 the population voted for the other guy , more than likely not a good thing to do is go out and start CENSORING your customers and shareholders that is 1/2 your customer base if you wanted to try and keep them as customers and shareholders. So many are leaving just as soon as they can and some are now selling any move higher in the stock . VZ will have a major problem with their debt when 1/2 the customers base leaves . VZ is now drive away customer in droves FACT all caused by VZ own actions of CENSORING what their customers can see, read or post. You will lose lots of money . Just the FACT I have no need to try and even make stuff up when what is really happening is all so true."
Whole system is broken here. DOw had 543 point swing today. Its all about day trading stupidity here only. Pump and dump on bad news etc. At end of day not much change one big joke . Thank the FEd for no commitment here in markets for long term period. Just daily day trading games period.
Numbers look fine to me. Tough Crowd!
"Okay,okay I get it. Covid-19 could dent the economy. It could push 5G scale further out. That said, the medical uses of 5G such as digital diagnoses and other remote medical applications will be seen worth investing in along with safe cities. So I can't see VZ being hurt. Americans don't live that close together so I can't see a big population with Covid-19 at one time. It will be worse in general in cities. Where it could really break out is in tent cities in CA. The virus can be inhaled or transferred to the eye or mouth and is supposed to last 6 hrs on hard objects that could be touched. Sounds nasty. All you VZ longs stay safe. You have some of your pile covered with a Big Red check mark. It will pass and rates will be low for a long time. The US could see some inflation due to shortages but if that happens it will boost production which will be good. I expect to see the US back on track by Q3 if not sooner. That's 24 weeks for Covid - 19 to spread and pass thru the US. Could be less by weeks. Just my guess."
"MAKES NO SENSE ,AT THIS PRICE ,$65 BEFORE END OF YEAR"
"COSTELLO: I want to talk about the unemployment rate in America.ABBOTT: Good subject. Terrible times. It's 5.6%.COSTELLO: That many people are out of work?ABBOTT: No, that's 23%. COSTELLO: You just said 5.6%.ABBOTT: 5.6% unemployed.COSTELLO: Right, 5.6% out of work. ABBOTT: No, that's 23%.COSTELLO: Okay, so it's 23% unemployed.ABBOTT: No, that's 5.6%. COSTELLO: WAIT A MINUTE. Is it 5.6% or 23%? ABBOTT: 5.6% are unemployed. 23% are out of work. COSTELLO: If you are out of work you are unemployed. ABBOTT: No, Obama said you can't count the ""Out of Work"" as the unemployed. You have to look for work to be unemployed.COSTELLO: BUT THEY ARE OUT OF WORK!!! ABBOTT: No, you miss his point.COSTELLO: What point?ABBOTT: Someone who doesn't look for work can't be counted with those who look for work. It wouldn't be fair.COSTELLO: To whom?ABBOTT: The unemployed. COSTELLO: But ALL of them are out of work. ABBOTT: No, the unemployed are actively looking for work. Those who are out of work gave up looking and if you give up, you are no longer in the ranks of the unemployed.COSTELLO: So if you're off the unemployment roles that would count as less unemployment?ABBOTT: Unemployment would go down. Absolutely!COSTELLO: The unemployment just goes down because you don't look for work?ABBOTT: Absolutely it goes down. That's how it gets to 5.6%. Otherwise it would be 23%. COSTELLO: Wait, I got a question for you. That means there are two ways to bring down the unemployment number?ABBOTT: Two ways is correct.COSTELLO: Unemployment can go down if someone gets a job?ABBOTT: Correct.COSTELLO: And unemployment can also go down if you stop looking for a job?ABBOTT: Bingo. COSTELLO: So there are two ways to bring unemployment down, and the easier of the two is to have people stop looking for work.ABBOTT: Now you're thinking like a Democrat. COSTELLO: I don't even know what the hell I just said! ABBOTT: Now you're thinking like Hillary."
Just keep raising that dividend. Baby boomers need income.
Doubled up! Bounce tomorrow!
Glad this is tanking daily. T-Mobile doubled the price. Better customer service. Better prices.
so much for volatility
No wonder Verizon was playing games with its unions just a few short weeks ago.
"Everyone speaks of Hans and his crew, with so little confidence he just has to move on. Thanks and watch out for the door behind you !"

"so where are all the cheer leaders that are pumping VZ now, the stock has been sliding everyday since the warren Buffet so called was reported on cnbc, so was Warren a seller that day and needed you all to support price so he could sell it all"
"looks like the shorts have VZ pinned down for good, every stock ran yesterday except 2 dogs VZ and T"
Why down???
Is the COMCAST acquisition of VZ possible?
"Remember to only sell any moves higher in VZ and Buy all the dips you can in T LOL,LOL Remeber VZ is now a communist company that take away your rights as the YAHOO NaTZI's censor what you can see ,read and post . LOL,LOL VZ going DOWN and RED like the communist company they have become"
FAA changes to open the door for widespread commercial drones. All piloted through 5G

Hedge funds selling VZ...and rightfully so..
Just noticed the doj has an antitrust investigation into Verizon let there be light
Have you heard if VZ will use Insg as the supplier for 5g mzobile puk?
"When Uncle Bernies plan to relieve all student debt has to be funded, it will increase your taxes, and every US company, including Verizons, significantly. That's lower profits , and a lower PE. I'm thinking of taking my money, and burning it. that way people like Bernie can never steal it."
Buyer at 45!
Curious as to why this is not responding positively...
"Over 68% of stock holders are institutions. With employee 401k taking much of the remainder, I doubled the number of shares I own today. We could be heading for a choppy market. This dividend is solid. Not like AT&T. Plus, just about everyone is in agreement, we are #1 in 5G."
will we see this at 45????i will keep buying going down.
Dead Money and will fall to $40s Next.
"Interest rates are dropping. A sign the economy is slowing. There is a glut of housing. Yet until a few weeks ago, Powel wanted to raise interest rates several times this year. HE KNEW THIS SLOW DOWN WAS COMING. This proves the Fed isn't worried about anything, except killing job growth, in order to keep wages low, and to help billionaires make even more billions. They keep saying ""where will all the workers come from"", as they saw huge numbers of people who gave up on jobs, return to the workforce. As the elites control and hurt us more with each passing day, I almost hope for a wave of socialism, and the elimination of elites. Because under a worldwide socialism, there won't be anymore Permitted Billionaires, like in Russia and China. it will be pure socialism, with all pay being equal and everyone require to toil. And few will like it, but it might be better than being bled by the elites, like we are now."
"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-military-response-migrant-caravan-120010102.htmlHuffPost is the source, Yahoo is the distribution channel. REMEMBER, every month you pay your Verizon bill, you support Yahoo. Verizon owns Yahoo."
"I'm glad Mr. Trump is attacking Obamacare. I voted for him to do that. The man in a genius. He's forcing Congress to do their free king job. Dreamers and Americans will all be better off, if Congress did their free king job. Just like 52 Americans would be alive today had Obama outlawed bump stocks. Its so nice to have a President who is helping us, instead of helping kill us."
When will 5G kick in? Will 5G save the day for VZ?
look out below massive sell off once again coming.
Beat tomorrow. 5g rolling out faster than expected.Will raise 2020 guidance
My best performing stock today. Great company and love the divvy. Anyone here taking advantage of Disney+ offer? I already preordered as a D23 member.
"Market Watch, a source used by TD Ameritrade and yahoo finance, ran a story about how China should give up its wet markets. Welcome to the one world agenda. Every country will give up its autonomy and customs. The US will give up Football, and the 4th, and have to speak Chinese. We will all give up our customs and freedoms in a dreary new world, to serve the worlds elites. and Verizon, through Yahoo finance, is helping that happen every time they print a story."
If I bought yesterday the 7th..Do I get the dividend today please someone???
"VZ 5g network might as well not exist. They are so far behind the curve, the ceo should resign effective immediately!"
Thank you Big Red........now on to 70................
stocks so over priced here see total collapse of at least 30% look out below
Revenue missed and a couple write downs (know it makes unadjusted earnings look lousy) causes investors to shy away from making further commitments even though the subscriber situation looks very good. I like the company but I would like it more as an investment if we pulled back a little below $50.....
"Omg, just when you think it can't be worse. Down almost 3%. VZ is a serious flaming pile of JUNK."
guidance on growth will be the focus on earnings and debt obligations. going forward with a new CEO may also pose a challenge for the street
Every headline article on Yahoo seems to be from the NYT. And every article is negative about Trump. I have not seen much on the latest Hunter Biden fiasco.
How can a 100 percent fiber network uses coax in the home? Using coax is NOT 100 percent fiber. Can you say “smoke and mirrors”?
"VZ gap up difference compared to T is still too high. Either T will shoot up or VZ will slide down to close that gap to 10-15 points at best. T has a much better future proofing at this point with media plays to buffer sub losses as was evident in the results. If VZ tries anything fancy now, it will get hit the same way for debt load like T was and any waiting games for approvals etc. Both are great stocks but only one is a better Buy as of Today."
Below is a story about VZ's 4 yr $10 B cost reduction plan which includes a big buyout. VZ did about 2x that # back in 2003 as it shook off old tech. It's going to cost a lot to get to a lower operating cost run rate but once there the $10 B compares favorably with VZ's current annual dividend nut of about $9.85 B. VZ's dividend will be the safest in the USA.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-10/verizon-to-give-buyouts-to-10-400-employees-in-restructuring
one year ago 56.32.....now 43.. and droping.............dow was 17000 ....now 21000.............DUHHHHHHHHH........
Good bump up today!
"My income portfolio, pretty much VZ & T, is hunkered down waiting for Q3 results. I expect good results at VZ and good cash flow -- upward momentum on margins at VZ from the cost reduction 5 yr plan up next yr -- I'm guessing overall okay results from T with good cash flow. I'm waiting for results and then my cash 11/1. VZ & T are my bond equivalents. You would have had a bond portfolio managed by Jeffery Gunlocks -- if I'm spelling the new bond king's name right -- to match T & VZ since the 2008 crash. You would have had short term cap gains all the way from 2008 with a bond fund - compared to qualified dividends and starting prices of about $24 for T and $26 for VZ back in 2010. You could have bought 10 yr T Notes around 2.75% or a little better I believe in 2010 and you would be soon getting your bait back and no cap nothing. I did stuff like that when I was first starting out in the market except a 10 yr T was 7.75% back then. I could have done better with the cap gains but I spend the dividends. Waiting for 5G to layer on some revenue - and unrealized cap gaina."
"Verizon propaganda arm yahoo finance is once again scaring people, trying to make them worry about a recession.That's what people on the left do. They lie, they name call, they race bait, they sex bait, and they keep trying to hurt the country.They love instilling fear. We have recessions every so many years. Usually its created by the Fed, to keep pressure of wages, so the worlds rich can become even richer. Things have slowed a bit. But that means its not growing as fast as it was. It doesn't mean anything is negative. There was one industry slowing, RV sales. But people don't travel much in the winter, and many people now are renting vs buying. Its not saying people are afraid to buy because they might lose their job. Why does yahoo finance hate American workers. if YF hates the country so much, why don't they go to a country that is better."
"Don't just complain about the new message boards here. Go to the Contact Us section and complain there, too. I also called up Yahoo corporate headquarters to register a complaint."
"Verizon 's $45 per month family plan sure be get a lot of customers from sprint T-Mobile PC Metro and cricket, because these companies signals too bad,"
"What a difference a week makes, if you research see what happened at IPNFF"
Why Would Verizon even think about buying Yahoo. Management is horrible and they have completely ruined Yahoo Finance with the recent changes. Bloomberg will get more of my attention. Too Bad.
Brick wall here to $54....SHORT at will!!! NO WAY this overvalued turd goes higher after Jan. 1!!!!!!!!

"Gift to sell before afternoon dump. Go long #VZ, might get back into #DUST."
"Can't get to my Yahoo portfolios. That's OK, Google still works......"
Why is such a bull market are so many quality stocks declining day after day?
Sheeple are DEM wits without a brain and can't think for themselves they need to be told what to do . That makes them the birth defects of mankind .
No matter what question Faber asked Hans... not once did he give a technical or financial response... all he could say was Verizon has the best network... I just don't get it...
A great time to buy into 5G technology is when everybody else is buying into electronic vehicle did you 5G is going to takeoff like crazy and Verizon is going to be close to $100 by the summertime
"Don't blame Yahoo, blame Marissa Mayer, she sold the soul of a once great portal then sold to VZ. VZ just purchased it for the valuable parts and will discard the chaff. That's the way it works.As far as the 'infringement of speech', you're on the wrong forum. Try parlr!"
"Lots of shorts just showed up....but look at that PERFECT green hammer end of day....though not exactly on a down graph, definitely complements the red hammer from last Friday. VZ wants to go up.....earnings in 2 weeks...69 five year high.....er will meet that this summer imo."
"For all you T haters that own VZ better get ready and learn to say OH no down VZ goes , LOL,LOL,LOLYou just can not make this stuff up , VZ Cramer 's best of breed to an out right disaster LOL,LOL,LOL"
"I switched to T-Mobile n Altice One for cell phones, TV, internet n biz lines...I cancelled VZ....reason...boycott FB...."
"Yahoo Finance has a story about Buffet. Says he's a card carrying capitalist. Says socialism is embraced by the US.No Yahoo, socialism isn't embraced by the US.Its only embraced by media, and those who want to deceive people into thinking they will get a free ride under socialism. The only people who do well under socialism are a small number of elites. Everyone else will be worse off. Everyone will have to work harder, with less reward. The State will decide what you do, and how many hours you work.If Mr. Buffet was smart, he'd stop donating to the left. The left is his enemy, yet he politics with Hillary, and funds them. He's not as smart as he thinks he is. Under socialism, all the worlds billionaires will lose their fortunes. ALL OF THEM. When it first happens, they'll think they are protected, and have made deals. But when it happens, those deals will be thrown out, and millions of people will storm their fenced estates and mansions and plunder and burn everything. We will all be worse off, but their will be fun to see their empires fall. Especially since they are helping it happen."

Stupid markets ever here. Buying at these ridiculous highs. Look out below. I see thousands of points free fall here.
Wonder why Yahoo hasn't stopped the comments on the financial section like the news section?
literally no reason to be in this Stock anymore.
"Well my Feb 12 57 calls are about worthless now. Did not see this coming. Was up 1,800 next day and didn’t sell. Totally regret that ! Average down time and hike for the best!"
Shorts get ready to be axed!
"BlackRock, Wellington, Vanguard, Geode Capital, SSgA, Norges Bank, Northern Trust, and so on. All are being contacted. I am tired of the poor performance of media and it needs to be sold off."

Just bought bluejeans nice!
why it's up when market down
WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THIS STOCK - WILL IT EVER HAVE A DAY IN THE GREEN???????
"VZ has been showing support at 58.93 and resistance at 61.00. Bullish technical indication in MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
"Damn bunch of negative nancies on this board. Company brings in 128 billion a year in Revenue, 41 billion in free cash flow, but proclaim the sky is falling because they have a over a hundred billion in long term debt. Im sorry Verizon is spending so much to accompany the 5g Phase for the next 10+ years. it pays out just over half its EPS in dividends, and its still the best network coverage out there in America. Buy the dip and lock in the 4-5% div yield."
well i bailed today with a huge loss. avg price was 58ish. this thing is stuck. took my lumps. god even MO performs better than this. good luck longs.
Someone playing around with me. It’s too much things going on. No idea what the he’ll going on.
and it went down after hour...
"amazing how it stops running at 55, cant go through and hold"
Time to Buy! It should start to climb back up again.
Why can’t this stock go over 61?
sell Verizon.buy At&t....
I honestly hate these panic stricken sheep. Go ahead and give away your shares morons.
Probably gonna bring everybody on the 5g up as the topic going to be the main focus next week hope gets to 62. =D
Pre-Market Up! Good Sign!
"Interesting IBD article on VZ. Stating the need for 5g for VZ and maybe even a merger of equals with DIS. Not sure where that will go, but if VZ can utilize the existing infrastructure across the country for 5G, (like going from 3g to 4g) it's a slam dunk. They could compete with everything across the country, every cable carrier would be in trouble. Not likely that could be developed but it it were VZ would be the stock to own."
VZ will be among the top providers of the new 5G technology.
"If all one did was read Yahoo lead news stories on their home page, within a week you'll be reaching for the paring knife to slit your wrists. The reporting by Yahoo is absolutely so depressing that I'm amazed that anyone looks at their home page. Hans, if you're wondering HOW to improve the earnings outlook at your Media division, consider brightening things up a bit over at Yahoo."
"Hans is doing a great job, someone gag him"
"if VZ spent as much time responding to customer complaints-- as they do trashing the President on Yahoo--they might do better. they must be part of Nancy Pelosi's hate group. Doesn't matter really. Long term, cable cutters are making them history."
It would appear that no one on this board has read the recent (5 hours) article by Investopedia..! I would suggest you do so! Best write up on VZ I've seen recently.
Is the sale over?
What's the difference in Value between a Verizion Union Slob and an ISIS sleaze Terrorist?. You'd rather have the ISIS terrorist as your neighbor next door.

Let's mute political postings here.
Verizon blm’s anti American news site
"7/7 is when i sell after taking the dividend. Though, i like this company,there are better stocks to invest."
I hope that there are more people like myself who are dumping their Verizon products
50 day didn’t hold. Not good
Positive results from technical analysis at 9trading. On watch for clear above 54.53.
Who he FK trades this for 1% gains
"over 1% today. Expect another 1 to 2 % tuesday since the dividen payment for a lot if ppl is to buy more shares, hence will cause the stock price to increase. This will be over 50 soon."
"I can't believe how far off the deep end Yahoo is going now with their reporting. Verizon, you realize you're liable for this, right? Kamala caught Barrett ""off guard?"" Hardly. Soon after that Barrett was asked by one of the senators to show the notes she was taking, and the pad was BLANK. She is one smart woman with a great memory, and is fully qualified for the court. I wish Verizon would dump this pig already."
one overview Vz is guilty of is Yahoo purchase should have included Baba
"The FACT is the more VZ and the Yahoo NATZI's censor Americans and their own opinions the lower and lower VZ stock will go as VZ runs off more and more customers. Not bad enough VZ is now losing customers to T's new unlimited cell plan with FREE HBO MAX , The Last thing VZ should be doing is trying to run off the rest of the customers and shareholders by censoring them , Earnings are going to be fun to see just how many customers VZ is now losing daily to T's monster and how many more VZ is now just running off."
Verizon is make money machine
"If you are Young and want to Invest ,,, yes buy some Verizon. ..IMO. I turned 20K intro 100G, It didn't happen overnight. Income stock versus slap happy. ..ROF."
When the stock breaks above $59 it'll stay above
"The analyst who downgraded VZ forgot to mention the user addition will be difficult for every carrier due to the fact that smart phone ownership in the US is approaching saturation! The main focus for VZ will be businesses and 4 levels of government entities who will grow VZ’s businesses in the IOT! VZ is paying down debt,while T and TMUS are taking on more debt which will affect their balance sheets. Analyst is synonymous with “birdbrain”!"
Guess your not buying then
VZ why don’t you focus on rolling out 5G instead of trying to impose your liberal beliefs on your customers. VZ CEO is pathetic just like your 5G network!!!!!
Yahoo has turned into a pile of dung ever scene Verizon took over.................
"Way to Go ""Big Red"".......$60.00 here we come..........."
Will people pay $80 per month per line for unlimited 5g?........Yes they will. :-)
Verizon $46 Helios. $1
Take some profits...nobudy knows when things will turn around but the possibility a ongoing decline should not be ignored
SELLING EVERYTHING!! This is going to be the crash everyone was talking about. See you in November
You would think it’d regain the ground it’s lost lately and then some. Don’t think anyone expected wireless growth.
I sold all my shares in VZ last year for one reason. They own Yahoo which pumps out more fake news every day than CNN and MSNBC combined. Company leadership that condones this behavior can not have good judgment in any aspects of the business.
"i happened to be at my dr office and cnbc was on and all they talk about is how great every stock is rising, this market is so over valued on many stocks, so why is it VZ is down big from its high when every stock rises becaus ethe govt has gioven the big players free cash"
Getting close to that 52 week high.
look out below massive sell-off Sucked everyone in no send them down. Same old games FED /Wall street games. Screw savers make rich richer.Enough already crash and burn
I look for long term things companies have done to make it better or bone head moves that will destroy their company and Han's and his Yahoo's NATZI censoring and their one world EU order is now driving customers away in droves and Han's now has nothing to compete with T's monster they have built because Han's did not change the company to compete in the new world they now face FACT Better get ready long term to say OH NO down VZ goes . Any moves higher in VZ is only a chance to sell even more before the next earnings show the massive customer losses
Anyone notice U can post too boards with your cell phones but not a computer. which triggers the survey. what's up with that?
https://investorplace.com/2018/07/what-the-second-half-of-2018-has-in-store-for-investors/
The fact is PFE has and lower PE and pays you over 4% and they have a future . VZ has no future
Mute Ted people. He's a troll who posts on Rite Aid with many id's. Sorry he followed me here today.
surprised at the constant drop
Buying Yahoo was stupid. That one move ensured that tens of millions of Americans would NEVER switch to Verizon - and millions more will cancel Verizon once they figure out the disinformation campaign they wage on their site. Beyond dishonest.
"JUST LOOKED AT YAHOO CONVERSATION ON DUPONT STOCK THAT HAS BEEN GOING UP AND IS UP TODAY OVER A DOLLAR, AND THE LAST POST ON YAHOO IS SEVEN DAYS AGO, VZ NEEDS TO CLEAN HOUSE WITH SOME PEOPLE AT YAHOO"
Is VZ aware how much Yahoo fked up these message boards
New high before year end?
-10% for the past 3 months....
Volume on this stock waay down and problems making new highs b4 earnings report. What does that spell???
"Well VZ you own Yahoo, but the morons at yahoo delete my posts defending VZ on this goofy down grade!!Proof that yahoo has workers that are low IQ people working for them!!"
HMMR a pre 5G telecom play under $1.00......Hammer Fiber (HMMR) launching wireless fiber into Jamaica and Africa this month! This will not be below $1.00 for long.....check em out!
I do suggest that VZ performance during this market crisis reflects the true state of the economy. Down with slight improvement.
"VZ is in my portfolio, because it is not going anywhere. cell phones are here to stay. they are debt heavy so interest rate hikes cause dips. this stock and AT$T are dividend honey holes. stay long and buy the pull backs. Watch the 200 day moving average, and rake in . great DRIP stock."
I have blocked Verizon from sending me any info on starting my services
"Looking back we all are experts. Sell all nifty fifty stocks before the dot come bust and buy Amazon, Priceline, chipotle, Apple , AutozoneNetflex. Now Sell and buy drugies"
"I was hoping this would sell down to the 45$ range to buy more, so see what you can do for me.Nice stock to own in a roth, tax free."
"Jerry,VZ and Google are partners in bed and T-Mobile is run by a #$%$........Global Crossing!"
Tech sector up over 4% this one 1/10 of 1%
Sprint (S) down 13% today. The holiday is coming. I would consider S at this time. just bought 1000 shares
I question the the shorts are rushing to cover their positions or someone thinks good new is coming in quarterly report.
"By Far the worst customer service on the planet, the attrition rates will be huge. not to mention the most expensive carrier! VZ is doomed till the executives pull their hearts out of their #$%$!"
I just got out of a meeting. can someone please explain why this is down over $1. thank you
Biggest Loser = Trump and family!
The market is still volatile with upcoming midterm elections. I think holding here is wise.
"Thank you VZ you just raised my bill another 6 plus $. Time to search for a new provider,, in my opinion Your FiOS TV is over rated"
VZ closed at $59.71 on the 8th before ex-divvy day on the 9th and closed at $60.13 today so about flat with cash flow of $.61 to pay some bills.
Pay day today right? Or is that T?

Cramer likes TMUS; that's why we're up. Go VZ!
the analyst who downgraded must be embarrassed. Very light selling volume on his opinion.
vz debt less than T debt. payout ratio for vz less than 60 vs over 100 for T.

"SAY OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
Soon VZ will go full melt down as Wall Street brain dead Analyst come to see that VZ no longer has a future and only a very slow death.
Boycott Verizon
AT&T is sitting at the level it reached in 1997. They own Direct Tv in South America. They are trying to sell it since all their customers are coming across our Southern Border. Not just to watch their favorite shows here. But to get every freebie we can muster. Verizon is free of this inferior tech. A secure dividend. Whereas The T dividend is in serious danger!
$29 should be a point to buy!
So much for telecom being a safe haven.
Excellent..........Go Big Red.................
Yahoo Marxists cannot handle the truth! Trump 2020 MAGA
"Colleges, germ incubators to begin with, will be forced to install teleconferencing for their classes. This equipment can be turned up very quickly. Businesses that do not normally use this technology will start. They will not risk flying people around the country. More importantly 5G is an unstoppable force. Buying here is a really smart thing to do. Plus a great dividend."
Best value play for 5G and Awesome dividends to pair with. 2021 will be a great year for VZ.
"The difference between the media plans of $T and $VZ can be looked simply as renting vs. owning. Verizon is leasing content from other owners and paying them large fees for bundling while avoiding the instant sticker stock of a large property purchase. ATT on the hand bought a very large, well maintained property that it not only uses for its own bundling but also rents it out and collects fees to pay down its very large mortgage. I am still betting on the latter strategy for the future. Just like housing and the fact you ""have to live somewhere"", the adage of ""you are always gonna be watching TV, sports and shows"" also applies."

"look out below Federal Reserve games, Manipulating rates keeping them down or lowering to keep markets up. wake up America this whole system is going to collapse here They have let these games go for years. They have kept rates low to screw savers. They have kept these games up for 10 years at least/ Now e everything like housing ./stocl market etc is way over priced period. All games make the rich/richer. Screwed savers with maybe 2.5% return. Need to fire all of them. Get non bias market board period. Whole system corrupt from top to bottom. Tax wealthy with additional tax rate of 10%. This would take care of national debt going forward.These same billionaires have gotten rich with their tax breaks. We need a massive revolt to put an end to these games. Just simply put Federal Reserve corrupt in playing these games."
Verizon is out in front on 5G. I understand 5G will be rolled out this year. I wonder why investors aren't more optimistic about VZ in light of the prospects for 5G? Any comments appreciated.
Nice pop.
PS IF YOU BELIEVE VZ CAN OUTPERFORM THE SMALL PORTFOLIO I FREELY GIVEN AND I AM LONG ON EVERYTHING I OWN AND HAVE YOU A FEW I DONT OWN BUT IT DOESNT MATTER BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE BUYING SIRC IDEX AT THE MONEY

"Verizons sick little puppy yahoo finance gleefully reports the 7th bankruptcy unfolding for Trump.We all thought the left was all about Universal Love. Only liberals can cheer people about to lose their job.But 7 out of 500 companies ? Is it even worth mentioning ? Lets remember that vindictive Pelosi would not allow any of his properties to receive covid aid, while Billionaire Justice received millions. Did Pelosi give her billionaire buddy Steyer any covid money ?"

Shouldn't we boycott things made in China? They were not honest about this virus and now the whole world is in jeopardy. Are the people who started it still alive or have they succumbed to it? China should be responsible for the financial support to families who have lost loved ones due to this virus and their dishonesty. China should not be a tourist destination either. They need to get a very bloody nose from this one.
"From the ""5G"" site/blogAs promised, Verizon today began offering an overhauled version of its 5G Home fixed wireless service by expanding it into Chicago and using the 5G NR transmission standard and equipment that customers can install by themselves.The action shows last year's initial launch of Verizon 5G Home in parts of four cities was indeed more of a commercial test than an actual business offering. With its refreshed approach, Verizon appears to be preparing for a major, widespread commercial rollout of the service.However, Verizon's ultimate ambitions for the service remain unclear. Earlier this year, the company appeared to walk back from an initial goal of rolling out fixed wireless service to 30 million households over an unspecified amount of time. In its announcement today, Verizon reiterated plans to launch mobile 5G in a total of 30 US cities, but did not provide any further details on its fixed wireless deployment plans. Fixed wireless Internet services are intended for home and office locations, wherein customers access the Internet through that stationary WiFi router backhauled through a cellular network. A number of companies, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Starry also are embarking on fixed wireless Internet rollouts.Mobile services, on the other hand, are intended for smartphones and other portable devices.Here are the new elements of Verizon's revised 5G Home service:Self installationWhen Verizon initially launched 5G Home late last year, it boasted of ""white glove"" installations by professional technicians. The company now is moving to a model where customers install their own equipment using directions from a Verizon app. More than 80% of new customers will be able to install their own equipment, Verizon executives have indicated. The operator is offering equipment users can install on the outside of their window in order to receive its 5G signals, thereby sidestepping the problem of getting 5G transmissions in millimeter-wave spectrum bands to go through glass, an approach Verizon hinted at in 2017, Verizon executives told CNET.Verizon will dispatch technicians to customers who cannot install the equipment themselves or those who need a receiver installed on the outside of their home in order to properly receive a signal, the CNET report said.As Verizon executives have previously said, the move from professional installations to a do-it-yourself (DIY) model will significantly boost profits from the service by eliminating the potentially expensive need to send a technician to a customer's location to install equipment.5G NRLast year, when Verizon first launched its 5G Home service, the operator used equipment running its own proprietary 5GTF standard. The operator is now shifting to the official 3GPP-approved 5G NR transmission standard.That will allow Verizon to use the same equipment for both fixed and mobile services, thus eliminating the cost of maintaining two separate systems.ChicagoWhen Verizon introduced its 5G Home service last year, the operator launched service in parts of four different cities: Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. Today, Verizon said it will expand its fixed wireless service into Chicago. That doesn't come as much of a surprise -- Chicago was one of the first two markets selected by Verizon for mobile 5G earlier this year.Verizon hasn't yet published coverage maps for its 5G Home service, but it's reasonable to expect the operator now will cover broader swathes of territory with its refreshed fixed wireless offering. Verizon's initial 5G Home deployment in Sacramento, for example, was lambasted for its relatively paltry coverage area.The role of 4GVerizon executives told CNET the operator would continue to use its existing 4G network for upload connections on its 5G Home service, but would begin to support uploads on its 5G network next year.Verizon also continues to promise 5G Home download speeds of at least 300 Mbit/s, with possible speeds up to 1 Gbit/s. But the operator's 4G network continues to act as a fallback.Built-in AlexaVerizon is offering WiFi 6-capable routers and extenders for the service which provides Internet coverage inside customers' homes or offices. And the operator said its gadgets will now feature Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition service.TV servicesAs CNET noted, Verizon is taking aim at cable providers by offering three months of free 5G Home service alongside a free Amazon Fire TV Cube or Fire TV Stick 4K, or its own Android-powered Stream TV 4K streaming box. Verizon also offers a free month of YouTube TV.Those freebies will help position 5G Home as a suitable replacement for TV and Internet from cable companies. Indeed, they essentially stand as a competitive block to new mobile offerings from cable companies like Comcast (Xfinity Mobile), Charter Communications (Spectrum Mobile) and Altice USA (Altice Mobile) that bundle inexpensive mobile service with cable Internet and TV."

"Pimps know how to make money guess I am one with VZ I sell calls (covered which most of the time expire worthless)which means I keep the stock which pays me a nice dividend..plus the premie on the sold call been working for mefor decades,,when I do get the stock taken away, which is at a profit, I just buy back on dipsexample last buy in at 58.02 sold calls at 58,5 usually 1 week before expire date premie=300$"
I see Yahoo (Verizon) is backpeddling and covering their behinds by now reporting on the Hunter Biden story. Guess they can't sweep it under the rug any longer. Talking with a friend from the Ukraine it turns out the story has more teeth to it than people realize.
"TRB, Triton, you don't have to use Yahoo. Go to CNBC for the articles you can agree with."
"VZ is DOWN and RED like the communist company VZ has become , NO ONE in America should be doing any business with a company like VZ that is CENSORING it's customers and shareholders on what you can see read and post ."
Earnings on MLK day.
"5% divi, PE of 6. what else do you want?"
Verizon can’t be too liberal if they sold off the huff post.
"I'm happy VZ is trading at $60. I've been in VZ for 9 years and I have no plans to sell. So VZ could be at $55 where I would feel less rich but no change to my share holdings. When I look at 2020 I see more of the same with continued green shoots from the cost reduction efforts, 5G and telematics. I see 2021 as the year, market willing, that VZ could take on some market cap. The 10,400 supervisors and managers who took the buyout last year will will have worked thru to a point where VZ has started to cut overhead associated with all those bodies - like real estate. VZ's cloud and virtualization efforts have paved the way to reorganize wireless with considerable headcount reductions in the last few years. There should be more staff reductions this year from the shift in focus to 5G. I hope people within VZ who wanted to make the shift to 5G have been able to do so. It's been a good time to shift from wireline to 5G deployment which will be going on for years.I sure hope operations people from FTR have been able to make the jump back to the future. At any rate, As VZ starts to grow revenue past a crawl I can visualize a point where VZ is growing revenue 3% and likewise yielding 3% for an $80 share price. No question about it -- if revenue growth hits 3% - 4% the stock will get a bid."
4.3% DIVIDEND YIELD !!! VZ IS WAY OVERSOLD !!! BUY BUY BUY
VZ whisper numbers is a beat for earnings due out tomorrow!
looking to buy in in the mid-40s
Weak hands being flushed out; looks like some new hands starting to come in.
"For what it's worth, I did a little homework on the topic of shareholder lawsuits. I have never done one, but it appears that VZ does qualify as a legitimate candidate. The general criteria to determine the merit of a shareholder lawsuit falls under the business judgement rule. In other words, can the board of directors reasonably handle such a matter? In reality, shareholder suits are ""last resort"" measures. That said, one of the criteria is best described as abdication of duty, which is what the VZ board is currently doing regarding the Verizon Media division. So in that instance, a lawsuit is possible. Would it be successful? Hard to say. Only a discovery would determine that, and to do a discovery you have to file a lawsuit.I also spoke with a business attorney who has experience with this, to get his opinion. He said based on the current facts in front of him, there may be merit. He asked if I spoke with the board. I have not. He suggested filing a formal complaint with the board first, and if they ignore it, it provides evidence to file a suit against VZ. What stood out to him was the amount of the goodwill writedown for the Media division. He said that by itself puts it on the bubble, but the fact that VZ continues down a similar path since the writedown could demonstrate bad business judgement which would allow such a suit to move forward. He did laugh and say ""wow, what a stupid business decision they made"" with Media. He even wondered why they haven't spun it off or shut it down.Stay tuned..."
"VZ... when are you going to grow a set of cojones and start allowing comments on Yahoo to be made so the America public can refute or dispute the lies, fake and slanted news you provide everyday with impunity?"
There goes the dividend
$61rotation from insane run of a few techs is nice
"Several states are raising their minimum wage, and of course Pennsylvania is not. Verizon has sales associates making $10.10,consultants making 10.40 and inside sales reps making 10.86. This is why Verizon hates limiting immigration. They don't want to pay their people a decent wage. How do you feel as a shareholder, investing in a US based sweat shop. Can you sleep at night ?"
Government was worried about servers from China when they should also been worried about the cell companies like T mobile that was set up by the EU to collect data and now even VZ with Han's from the EU and now run by the EU one world order censor yahoo NATZI that are now Censoring Americans and even their own customers and shareholders can you just think what they are now doing with all that data they collect from military bases and companies as all that data now goes to the EU one world order and gets sold to China . WOW just think
I hope all you wonderful Verizon investors will be happy now with your your new taxes
VZ: what out for market start sell the news on TRUMP's Tariff
A lot of down pressure last couple of months. Decent stock but this isn't the moneymaker people are hoping for.
The Yahoo mobile app is terrible since the update. It moves slow and can't review or edit holdings. fix it Verizon.
Verizon billing is high and all the info is wrong. I added 4 lines and in the bill they show 3 lines and I did Auto pay that should reduce my bill by $40 dollars. The first bill is $270 dollars which is very high. T-Mobile I paid one $144 for 4 lines and netflix is free. I made wrong choice to changing to Verizon. I will cancel my service ASAP. Going back to T-Mobile.
Remember to only sell any moves higher in VZ before you lose all your money
Heavy volume.....Go Big Red.......
Huffington Post up for sale. Good riddance to that liberal bias rag. Another Lowell waste of money. Notice how VZ stock price improved with him gone? Just saying.
I get it....why can't everybody else see the opportunity here...i'd also check out CVS too if I were you!
and T has made another 52 week low.
"Verizon has yahoo finance showing highlights of the anti Latino, anti Christian town of Hollywood. Wonder if Verizon management hates Christians and Latinos the way that Hollywood does. Wonder if Verizon shareholders feel the same way too. Yea, I'm gonna like socialism, where companies that promote hateful ideals and goals get nationalized."
"leaky ship all VZ is, she can't hold water for long"
Oh how I love VZ. Go baby go.
Market may need to digest this news overnight cause it sure aint acting right or the market really thinks its insignificant? This place sho gone crazy!
"Any move higher is now only a chance to sell even more VZ before the next earning report shows how many customers VZ is now losing to T everyday now. VZ is now porting over cell numbers to T lots and lots of number every day as VZ loses more and more customers to T's new unlimited cell plan and you get HBO MAX for FREE , VZ has nothing to compete with T and it will only get worse in the future"
"Hahaha. VZ is a bum stock, goes nowhere."
Anyone else Cutting their Cord? Does Verizon lose millions of Subscribers a Month?
TRUMP LIES ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. WHY DO YOU GUYS WANT POLITICS INSTEAD OF INVESTING....
"My guess, the sellers today are the guys that held us to a 15% drop versus a 30% drop like the rest of the market. Fun part, they're chasing and I pray this is it.. The bottom!"
"T will become Cramer's best of breed before the year is over. Why easy T's debt is going lower and lower plus T's 5G monster is about to grow and start taking share from it's competition . HBO is going to MAX the competition to death LOL,LOL,LOL"
VZ should be at 60 here . Pays dividend plus great stock. Very stable period.
Verizon is dragging it’s anchor. They should cut some costs and jack up the dividend bigly.
"Yahoos home page says it all. Yahoo fully supports BLM, fully supports Hillary, fully supports LGBT, fully supports all things pro muslim. Is anti christian, anti white, anti pretty much everything that is moral. One propaganda piece after another. I think the shareholders need to have concern for what will happen to their stock when they buy up Yahoo. I would never use a Verizon phone on principle. How many 10s of millions of people like me are there? Buy up Yahoo, cut your phone business in half. A huge net loss. Yahoo walks away with your money and all you got was a hate web site."
"Gee a whole penny today, WOW."
Mr Wonderful ALSO touts Blue Apron as aback up the truck type of investment position.All as it nears a Buck---so don't be so quickto smother him with KUDOS... lol
"The GOP tax bill is going to change Big Red into Big Green.Given first year 100% expensing for five consecutive years, VZ's cash flow is going to get a big boost. Telecoms payed an effective 33% under the current 35% scheme -- the highest was energy. Thank you Mr. Trump."
Some more consolidation for a Business Center. Nice looking building though. in ma.https://www.bing.com/search?q=verizon+connect+to+cut+49+jobs&pc=MOZI&form=MOZSBR
Looks like more gains today! Up in pre-market trading!
A 2% ten year bond yield sends Verizon to $70. :-)
they just missed out on twenty century fox. no one wants a land line or TV monthly bill. done.
I used my dividend payments to add more shares
10% off the highs....fair value for buying again. Probably will get swept up in the 10% correction coming here....so maybe dribble in.
So this is an upstanding example of America per Verizon / Yahoo?
"LOL,LOL you get to SAY again OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL that is what happens when you choose to be in the Commodities business and VZ is the highest cost producer and the price for their Commodities are dropping like a rock"
Sad--One Million children will not have a Merry Christmas this year because of Planned Parenthood...and you people who support abortion can look at yourself in the mirror...!!!
"VZ needs to SELL Yahoo!!!While checking mail Yahoo is now asking me to turn off my ""ad blocker""Ha!!! That will never happen! I'll stop using it altogether, before I ever do that."
"Ok, so the downward trend continues, no Catalyst’s to upside the price, 10yr rates up, look out for bond proxies. Could be on a precipice of a long downward trend. T-mobile really hurt this company."
"Verizon likes to show Business Insider articles on its yahoo finance pages. and why not. business insider is owned by Axel Springer, a publisher in Europe. So if Europe is taking billions a year from us in unfair trade, of course they would be mad if we wanted a level playing field. DO you understand now what Verizon is doing. and if so, why do you still own their stock ?"
when does the next dividend come around chas
VZ/YAHOO is so far left they think CNN is a right wing news source. CNN isn't right wing and isn't a news source.
Cash per share! VZ's cash per share is only 47 cents. That makes me wonder the truth about the earnings.
Verizon will only go up if Yahoo's pps goes up.Just like Yahoo will go up if Alibaba goes up.Only the smart ones know what I am talking about.
Just allows me to buy more shares on div reinvest!
You would be buying about a 4% dividend. Absolutely no price appreciation. Look at a chart. Stock was above 60 in 1999.
