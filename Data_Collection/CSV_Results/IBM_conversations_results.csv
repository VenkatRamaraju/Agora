Recent headlines and conversations for IBM
this was such an easy call to make .... and they got the right ceo for the job with biggest piece of revenue pie coming from cloud. buy and hold ...
IBM Spinoff KYNDRYL name sound so much like KYNDRIT Nail fungus treatment!JMHO......Tex
how can this stock be up a 1.00 if it closed at 143.22 the price should be 144.22 not 142.43 If they do not fix this huge manipulation problem I am never buying stocks the rest of my life Can anyone explain this
"IBM Cloud is using AMD's EPYC Rome 2nd generation. $ibm isn't using $intc anymore. AMD's GPUs replacing $nvda for tight integration.""Satinder Sethi, GM of IBM Cloud infrastructure, joined me to discuss how IBM Cloud views performance and works to deliver it to its customers. Enterprises moving to cloud want higher levels of performance to support compute-intensive workloads for AI and big data, without jeopardizing security. Security is a critical component of IBM’s hybrid cloud strategy, and technologies like 2nd Gen EPYC with SEV-ES help drive new levels of security in the hybrid cloud era. IBM Cloud customers are also asking for better memory bandwidth for big data and analytics workloads. With 45% greater memory bandwidth in its class,[iii] 2nd Gen EPYC provides fantastic memory bandwidth scaling for big data and analytics workloads. Finally, the core scaling and breakthrough performance of 2nd Gen EPYC provides a superior quality of service and a higher level of performance for container workloads. IBM plans to have more to share in 2020 about its new performance offerings for clients.,https://community.amd.com/community/amd-business/blog/2019/09/18/2nd-gen-amd-epyc-continues-market-momentum-with-new-customers-and-new-performance-milestones"
The usual hopium has set in. The #$%$ Kavanaugh will blubber the same platitudes and clich�s around 'higher value' and 'hybrid cloud' while revenue continues to shrink. He'll boast about 'double digit cloud growth' while the top dogs are growing at 50% +. IBM has no sales presence outside their ever shrinking enterprise pool of clients.
"Rometty represents the I in IBM, the I as in Incompetent."
My PT on IBM is still 230 Warren Buffet was RIGHT went with airlines. All good IBM is a good company with GROWTH again FINALLY.
Whenever someone says gaps don’t fill show them a 5 day chart of this stock.
"IM LONG IBM since 1993 I have been a shareholder. Now having said that...The only reason to remain in IBM stock is the dividend. The stock will never get back to where it should be in the 200-250 dollar range while the BOD plays pocket pool and allows Rometty to remain as CEO. There have been too many strategic blunders and failed market penetrations like Watson,AI, health care...the weather channel(never understood that one)... the list goes on and have cost the company and shareholders dearly. IBM lost a major cloud contract with the DOD to Amazon....Amazon( a core online shopping and entertainment services), now taking share in cloud computing. What a slap in the face to a company which used to be a technology leader far and way better than any competition. Rometty and her management team are driving the bus off a cliff and you can only hide your failures using off short cheaper labor for so long until its over. Then its to late, Rometty walks away will millions in the her pocket and leaves behind a hollowed out company, like Imelt did to ge) Every one of her management team should be FIRED and middle managers put back into the tech ranks or laid off(like they have done to so many) so the management levels get flattened."
"IBM would soar 20 pts if the BOD announced that they fired Gin soaked CEO Rommetty and replaced her with some who can run a major tech company. Under Rometty, it is estimated IBM has lost over 30 BILLION in market value. BOD do your duty to the shareholders and find someone who can run this company as it should be or resign your seat!"
"Grease up, longs.Earnings will be ok but El #$%$ (kavanaugh) will dumbfound the analysts yet again with endless business platitudes and blather."
Definitely going over 120 today
Cramer did this
GOOD DAY I think he should be the CEO
"How to boost IBM PPS? IBM CEO threatens to pull Anthem business unless Anthem outsources to IBM Softlayer and.call it a "" cloud"" deal to show Wall Street they are ""gaining"" on AWS and Azure. Oldest trick in book."
"former IBM CEO is on CNBC at 8:15 am Eastern time.P.S. I bought IBM back in April knowing that the changing company would expand faster. It has and will continue to do so. It’s Cloud business is growing 34%, to competitors who’s Cloud is growing on average 20% this year.."
"A quick non-scientific calculation shows IBM has bought back about 20 million shares a year over the past 10 years, and there are about 2/3 of the shares outstanding now. Roughly 80,000 shares per day being bought back by the co. Annual div. increases and stock yielding over 4%. This co. is not going away and worth a buy."
"Is $145 a reasonable entry price? Serious replies only, please. Thank you."
this is ugly
IBM was yesterday at an 11 year low... the stock market rebounding President Trump spoke with China’s President Xi and they might come to an agreement soon on trade. What is there not to like about IBM at these low prices ?? This one is an easy buy. It’s already creeping up. By the next week Friday it will be at $120 or more.
"5% drop tomorrow, at least"
IBM is the future
"""IBM unveils 2-nanometer chip technology for faster computing""I guess IBM's great number of patents means something after all..."
Value and dividend investors will enjoy picking up more shares at a discount tomorrow.
"Soon, Ginny will announce retirement, IBM stock will soar"
Rhat CEO should lead IBM to the next decade.
"So IBM buys RHT for $34B, they take on $20B debt to finance it. To service the debt at 3.5% or so, they pay $700M on interest. RHT made $433M in profit in 2019. Even if they make $500M, there's still $200M short. Every year. How is that gonna work?"
"IBM is the most likely strategic buyer.Shares of Cloudera (CLDR) - Get Report shot up 18% on Tuesday to $12 after Bloomberg reported that the enterprise software firm is fielding takeover bids, although no deal has yet been reached. Trading was briefly halted in the stock after the news was reported. D.A. Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote on Tuesday that IBM (IBM) - Get Report ""is the most likely strategic buyer, especially given the partnership between Cloudera and IBM."" The two firms teamed up starting last year on data and AI programs within Apache Hadoop."
IBM with Rometty is becoming a silly joke. Some IBM dude told me yesterday that with the RHT acquisition IBM will be a dominant player in the cloud market. I think they all swallowed a few too many magic corporate propaganda pills. It is as if a large tire manufacturer would claim that they are the biggest player in the automobile market because for every car sold there are at least 4 tires that go with it. IBM became delusional to the core.
Welcome to the new GE.
"What does this mean? ""Systems (includes systems hardware and operating systems software) -- revenues of $1.8 billion,down 19.5 percent (down 18.0 percent adjusting for currency), with growth in Power, more thanoffset by the impact of product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and Storage."" So the mainframe biz is not coming back until the next generation (product cycle). But its revenue is far less than half of (each of) Cloud, GBS, and GTS revenues. And Red Hat numbers will arrive August 2, they are not consolidated into the announced results."
"History shows us that the market will go up regardless of who wins, so load up some IBM while it’s still under $120! I don’t believe it will be this low for much longer. Good luck all!"
Cain you see it investors trying to get out of the Market
"I don't get it. SNOW is more valuable cloud company than Redhat? Can anyone tell me why IBM is undervalued than SNOW? Redhat has more customers, more revenue, and well-known in the industry for years."
"After all these years’ downbeat report, IBM has finally appears to be on the course to stop the revenue decline. May be this can be the start of its turnaround.up over $6 with this surprise report. Red hat purchase must be showing its positive effect now. So far so good."
"Ibm to hit 180...totally, I think Buffett is missing out on ibm. Ai will be huge, and ibm is investing heavily on it, record number of patents, not to mention blockchain wich is the future, and ibm is at the center of it. I can see $200 sometime in the near future."
excuse my naivety but how are dividends payed out? i bought some shares today so will the payment go direct to my brokerage account or will physical check go to my address on file? Thanks glta
wow...up two days in a row......now only 268 more up days before and IBM can be considered a real investment
stock will rise 10% when Rometty is gone.
Is 139.70 the next support?
if you bought yesterday for the dividend you lost 1 year of dividend in less than 24 hours
Down to levels first seen 20 YEARS AGO! Way to go BIG BLUES!
Any PT updates? This seems like a nice dividend paying stock.
Rometty is overpaid CEO. She has to be replaced. But BOD has no will to do it. Why? Because they also financially benefit. Only shareholders have not been rewarded. ROMETTY HAS TO GO!!!!
"Long here, waiting (far too patiently) for a good exit point. Past and current management has gutted the company, laying off critical talent in a downward spiral of shortsighted cost-cutting moves to try to boost quarterly numbers while sacrificing long-term development initiatives. Any hints of weakness in the report tomorrow could test the 134 support. However, it probably won't slip much lower since it becomes much more attractive at as a dividend play at lower numbers. Before buying this, make sure you do your research and consider this primarily as a dividend stock, not a growth option. Until the current management is replaced, expect to be perpetually disappointed."
"so looking at past trends IBM has been selling off after earnings I do have some puts because of this, but after the sell off in earnings it usually recovers.... and that's when ill buy"
I am still betting long on the new IBM and the current moves with ATT and RedHat. All good. Nice div. Even Ginny has me sold...which is a change from my previous thoughts on her as CEO!!!! We shall see.
Down it goes again ...
Rometty has done a good job. She should retire and give someone else a chance to lead the company from here on. A new vision is needed.
Why does it not buy it shares back like intel has! Show some support for the shareholders if you believe what your doing is right Mr. CEO and board
There is only so far u can go by trolling your antiquated patents..The only dept that is growing within IBM is the legal department raising & fighting law suits..
Wealth Destruction 101: Lesson 1 - Buy IBM stock. Lesson 2 - Hold long term.Lesson 3 - Buy more as price drops.
"i think IBM will be around for a long time but, as a much smaller company. No longer a machine company. imho"
DO NOT STEP ON THIS PUMPED UP LAND-MINE EITHER UP OR DOWN TODAY - WAIT UNTIL WEDNESDAY.
"IBM is not Sustainable - Ginni Rometty needs to go! For those buying for the dividend, note your share loss.https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2018/04/18/dont-buy-ibm-it-lacks-sustainable-competitive-advantage/#5eaa84b8e408"
"??split?? Not likely. IBM casts a wide product net and pays a dividend to boot. A spin-off of pertinent subsets to,on say, CERN or VEEV for example. My short term target (From 121) is 155, by Jun."
George Harrison would have been proud.
"Why is IBM still giving Ginny Rometty bonuses of $4.25M a year when she literally destroyed thousands of employees' livelihood and made major strategic blunders for her entire tenure? Stop this nonsense and remove her from the Executive Chairman role. Give her bonus money to the legal team that has to fight her age discrimination layoff practices that she pushed while CEO.Mrs. Rometty’s bonus for 2020 was $4.25M, which represents 85% of her target bonus for the year and is in line with the Company incentive score. The Committee considered Mrs. Rometty’s efforts in ensuring a successful transition to Mr. Krishna throughout 2020 in recommending this bonus. Key accomplishments included: • Mentored CEO on Board matters and transitioned key government, client and investor relationships. • Led the Board, including continued Board refreshment with the naming of one new director. Average Board tenure is now 6 years (below S&P 500 average of 8 years). • Continued to represent IBM as a leading voice on policy matters and in forums such as the Business Round Table, Business Council, China Development Forum, Singapore Advisory Board, Business Executives for National Security, and France Tech for Good.As disclosed by the Company in December 2020, the Board approved certain arrangements in connection with Mrs. Rometty’s retirement from the Company effective December 31, 2020. The arrangements approved by the Board included a post-retirement consulting arrangement for a three-year period following her retirement for services that the Company may ask her to provide from time to time, as an independent contractor. The fee for such services would be $20,000 per day for each day she provides 4 or more hours of services, and $10,000 for each day that she provides less than four hours. To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three-year consulting arrangement."
Does purchase tomorrow 11/6 get you the divi in December?
The sleeping giant has awakened
Just bought some more. Looking good.. thanks for the dip!
Falling today..2+ points already... How many more people will get the axe to make next quarters number?
"Even Nvda js now 3 times the size of IBM. Nvda was a mere graphic cards players, a small niche market, as recent #$%$ years ago."
"All I want for Christmas is to hear an announcement from IBM that Rometty will be gone effective January 1, 2020.I can't wait for that announcement to be made."
"This is a great deal for RH shareholders, but terrible for everyone else. RH employees will want to start polishing up their resumes because they will practically be volunteers after IBM's beancounters start looking at their compensation."
Glad I got a small profit out on this Friday. I have a feeling this is going to be a really bad week for the market.
"Buffet buying over 24,000,000 shares in about 3,2,1..."
Yahoo filtering........ beware
"Without question, IBM will pick up market share of the cloud from AMZN and MSFT with better data storage and processing and with better security.IBM is introducig two new mainframe systems, the z14 Model ZR1 and the LinuxONE Rockhopper II. Both systems come in a 19-inch single-frame design, so they can be placed into any cloud data center or private cloud environment with ease. These smaller mainframe systems, what IBM calls a ""data center in a box,"" could help breathe new life into this decades-old technology."
"- All three brands in Systems – IBM Z, Power and Storage – grew in 4Q, up 32%- IBMcloud revenue was up 27% in 4Q with an exit run rate of $10.3B- Each of the 10 largest global banks, 9 of the top 10 retailers and 8 of the top 10 airlines are IBMCloud-as-a-Service clients-$IBM continues to make progress in emerging areas like #blockchain, engaging in projects with 100s of clients & collaborating on 35 active networks w/ clients including CLS, Everledger, London Stock Exchange"
shorts: sayonara. welcome to the mid 21st century. IBM and Nvidia run it.
Until IBM changes it's CEO and Sr. Mgt. IBM will continue to fade into history.
Thinking of buying some IBM shares I like there dividend. Is the dividend solid and how low do you think this stock will go?
thank god for trump
"The market was super green, IBM was red all day and Ginni Rometty tried really buying few shares back to push it 3 cents in green with the rest of the market otherwise it looks very awkward. Wait for the market turn red, you will see IBM has nowhere to go but the rabbit hole."
I see IBM at $140+++++ nextweek
Massive news with palantir!
IBM holds the key of blockchain with its blockchain database that allows reporting of information and detect discrepancy and tempering. So simple and yet crtical piece of the building block to allow increase throughput in a distributed environment
If you are a IBM shareholder vote 'NO' on all Board of Directors on the bsllot. Vote them out!!We almost got them last year...53%-47%
IBM down almost 6 in after market. The currency market gave IBM a 3% boost earning wise..Now down 7
Why are you guys investing in this stock? This thing hasn't moved in 5+ years and has virtually no upside moving forward. You may want to consider dumping it and buying a stock that can actually net you a profit.
"Big partnership with IBM on AI datacenters and enterprise clients not just cloud!IBM's own Power processors is at the core of $ibm artificial intelligence initiative called Watson. BUT...nVidia is charging A LOT for their GPUs. Basically it means that nVidia forces IBM to give them a lot of profits plus they charging way more for their GPUs making everything way more expensive than otherwise could allow selling way more for more use cases!Attached is how department IBM is now on nVidia and using nVidia NVLink. This is coming to an end. IBM moving into BIG AI partnership using AMD's future datacenters GPUs, 7nm+ Arcturus. This is why suddenly a Power processors lead architect was hired at AMD to work on tight integration between CPUs and GPUs! Not just AMD's CPUs. IBM's future Power too cutting nVidia out. Drivers already released to allow AMD's GPUs use with IBM's Power processors but it's the beginning. Such news alone if out will considerably jump AMD's PPS as IBM IS the corporate king of IT!https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/power/nvidia"
IBM should be first to recover because of increasing income and very low P/E ratio.
Just bought some. Nice divy!
"IBM is a value stock with double digit growth just starting in 2018 !! Growing divisions in AI, Cloud, Quantum, Blockchain and high end servers (i.e. Z14) ! PE is so low and valuations are so low that expectations are minimum. ANY good news and stock will pop $10 and continue to $200 price target."
"IBMI'm well aware that IBM (NYSE:IBM) is viewed as a tech dinosaur on Wall Street, but you're going to struggle to find a more profitable tech stock valued at less than 10 times forward earnings.The downside of IBM is that the company waited far too long to switch from legacy hardware and software to the cloud. It's been paying for this lack of vision for much of the past decade, with sales declining on a fairly persistent year-over-year basis since 2012.But there's good news. Slowly but surely, IBM's cloud-based revenue as a percentage of total sales is climbing. Legacy software and services remain challenged, but total cloud revenue jumped 10% to $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. This works out to 37% of the company's total revenue during the quarter. The company's cloud and cognitive software profit margins nearly hit 80% in Q4 2020. That's light-years ahead of every other IBM operating segment. As cloud continues to grow into a larger percentage of IBM's sales, its operating cash flow will expand much more quickly. What's more, IBM hasn't been shy about making accretive purchases. Last year, it bought seven companies that specialize in the hybrid cloud or artificial intelligence. Look for IBM to continue leaning on inorganic growth to bolster its highest-margin operating segment."
"IBM is back,going forward there the company u want"
Maybe change needs to start with the STOCKHOLDERS voting out the old BOD and replacing them with ones that will force changes at IBM.
"IBM $180, AAPL $150, enjoy WB..."
Congrats to all the longs. Sorry for your loss shorts. Ray Charles could see the writing on the wall. Buy at will!
Several block chain companies are soaring double digits while IBM sinks. Block chain technology isnt going to save IBM just like Watson failed to do so...
"seems that nobody here love money, everybody just like to work…If you work more for the same money, that’s better…but how much your $100 really worth when you invest in some of the stocks like this down there…? prices taken today in the middle trade session…AMD, EPS $0,30, price $57,75, return on $100 = $0,52NFLX, EPS $4,13, price $442, return on $100 = $0,93AMZN, EPS $23,01 price: $2417, return on $100 = $0,95MSFT, EPS $5,74, price $178, return on $100 = $3,22AAPL, EPS $12,6, price $281, return on $100 = $4,48IBM, EPS $10,57, price $120, return on $100 = $8,80this IBM definite earn too much for his revenue…down with him…burn him before he sets ladder inevitably too high…!"
"Cleveland Clinic just the first to partner with IBM on quantum computing. While the street continues to chew on the news, buy as much as you can below$150. The sky is now the limit."
"Never seen this stock do well, the ousting of that witch outweighs anything negative that could happen to this company."
Where is the bull market in ibm
Sold my IBM for a 20% loss. Don't trust management. They had a deal to work with RED HAT. Why pay a 50% premium for the company.
"where are all these analyst who claimed this was a 150+ stock, this stock is a struggle at 134 now with 14 million shares,, this is sad the scam they ran on the longs out here,,I think i am the only one long.. then today a few come out and reiterate their BUY,, well at 142 it was a buy till earnings came out then it drops 10 points,, this is a scam"
IBM stock has done nothing but lose money over the last 4 to 5 years.
the only thing ibm excels at is creative accounting
Two words for IBMs Board: 1) Awake; 2) Immelt
"We will be back to new highs within 2 weeks. Sell off is without merit. Mostly related to one time charge. What is important is acceleration of sales into cloud, AI, Blockchain which will be GROWTH DRIVERS."
"It is not just Wall Street now. Notice the falling revenue even in the midst of what is supposed to be the golden era of high tech, the revenue is falling? That means even the customers are losing faith. That said I do not think it is fair to blame the current CEO, the Titanic was already sinking half way when he took control."
"IBM is way oversold,by biying redhat,ibm gets thounds of more customers,so does redhat,its a super marriage"
So now it looks like ibm is giving up on blockchain. This company seems to be a shell game. I’ve been sitting on mine forever and as everyone here knows it’s lost money for the last nine years. What a disaster.
Great IBM result is coming!
If your trading account looks anything like mine months ago you should do something about it. Since I joined (http://Multistockalerts.com) my account has been sizzling. Join them today…

"The move is great and every cloud user is a customer of IBM including microsoft, amazon and google."
"IBM is partnering with UBS and ZF autonomous car sharing payment platform with blockchain, another example of IBM is leading with so many partners."
she sure looked desperate
"When Red Hat kicks in, IBM will sky-rocket out of the stratosphere."
"If the board of directors fails to take the actions needed to stop IBM from becoming a GE valued stock. VOTE THEM OUT when you vote your shares. If the BOD refuses to take action, the shareholders must!"
"Lets see if my teachers theory holds true. I remember arguing with him in class about this. Per his ideology, IBM share price should not experience any loss from the cash being let go for the deal because in turn they are essentially acquiring an asset that is supposedly equivalent value. I firmly disagree. I think he’s also a big proponent of the efficient market theory. This is a bad move on IBMs part, and a fantastic win for RedHat shareholders. This stock will see sub 100’s because of this deal."
Everyone knows this giant does not have feet of clay. It will be back to the top of the 5 day chart very quickly.
New Ceo very confident in the cc for the future of IBM.

"After years of failed management, a purchase at the top of he market...is management capableof anything besides destroying shareholder value?"
"On the surface returning the company's cockpit to an engineer sounds good. The engineer being a 30 years insider is not so interesting because the IBM way is all he knows (unless he is way past his prime years). Focusing on the cloud at this juncture might sound good but the pony left the barn a long way back on that one and making it the new focus is gearing up to fight the last war. I would like to see main focus on new endeavors such as AI, Quantum computing, Biotech/healthcare before investing in IBM. Hoping to hear more about it from the new lead dog before investing in the company.Irrespective, dumping Ginny was long overdue and hopefully it's not too late. She's arguably the worst leader ever for this Enterprise and she is leaving old big blue severely bruised and now looking more like black and blue."
I have been a tech M&A advisor for over 30 years and this is by far the most ridiculous price I have ever seen. This deal will finally cost Ginni her job which is about 5 years too late for IBM shareholders.

Wondering why anybody would sell IBM at the current level? future looking better. Mr. Krishna imo is doing a great job! and like the Ceo of Microsoft has a background in engineering. Difference is according to Yahoo Finance MSFT is trading at 31 times forward earnings and IBM under 10.
Marked improvement now that the skirt is no longer ruining things at IBM. This country and IBM are both in better hands now that Ginni and Fat Donnie are gone. Go play golf!
"Interesting, IBM up and BOX CEO right now and others playing up the deal with Red Hat and how great this will be for IBM. I am long this stock and will remain that way for years to come. Also interesting to see the CNBC folks bail on the stock (Jim L) and it goes up???? Some say do the opposite of what the talking heads say. I say, do your own homework and chose wisely. However, IBM has been a thorn in my side lately. Next big move, new leadership perhaps. #1 hybrid cloud player going forward per CEO Ginny R?? Not sure about that statement, but willing to eat my words !!!! Good luck LONGS!!!!"
"Groundhog Day...market up, IBM down. Wait 24 hours, repeat."
BOOM!
The management structure is WAY over past bloated with do nothing middle managers who drive people like slaves so they get their stock awards.
Shipping company ##### next qtr=== I THINK it will be good. add to that news PLEASE main Frame Z is a winner
HFTs trying desperately pre-market to keep us contained. It will fail. IBM is moving swiftly into the lead on quantum computing -- the holy grail of big data. Buy the lights out below $150 imo.
If ROMETTY walked out the door up 6-8 on that alone.
When is EX-dividend date?
Just shorted at 148.90 !! Met lowered REVENUE guidance which keeps going lower and lower? NO WAY IT CONTNIUES UPWARD CLIMB. EASY SHORT
"IBM releases new Power 10 CPU. Perhaps some customer upgrades rolling out in the next few quaters, this and the Coke contact are good signs for IBM."
"I have owned IBM stock sine 1996 so I am in the green, but I am in only one more Q and if the CEO cannot show growth in the restructured initiatives I am out. There is no reason on God's green earth IBM should not be a dominant provider for Cloud services, for one. AI is still years away from becoming a real profit center. Quantum computing will be a home run, but again, they aren't there yet. SAS is there but laggardly. I need to see quantum computing very near roll out and solid increases in SAS, Cloud and blockchain to stick around. Just my two cents."
BULLISH on IBM. Good day to be long.
"IBM will be at $200 by end of 2018. IBM is doing all the right things now and focusing on the cloud, AI, Quantum servers, and blockchain methodology. Its a winner at a P/E of 10 !"
"No worries lot of kick backs in that 34 billions, that is what happens in all take overs, buy outs etc etc etc and etc.There is lot of, lot of and lot of money in this world."
IBM JUST PUT UP FEW QUARTERS OF GROWTH THEN $200 IN NO TIME
IBM will not see a daylight anymore. Learn from Warren Buffet to act accordingly.
"Is there any chance IBM will beat, or are we in for yet another $4 to $10 drop?"
I need a confirmation that this is not just a dream
maybe we can get more then DIVIDENDS going forward
"Nice beat. Still, selling part at 140"
"Given thrump fued with Amazon, IBM has an excellent chance to win pantagon cloud bit. however this can not be the reason for the spike. perhaps mm knows something pushing it up!"

"If you invested IBM in 2000, you gained nothing. Upper and mid management should be replaced by young and innovative people."
Heading back to $140 soon
IBM hits a new low in corporate responsibility. In a clear sign of desperation they have halted all matching grants for employee/retiree donations to arts and educational charitable organizations among others.Pinching every penny while their execs and BoD continue to rape the stockholders.
Overreacting. Not horrible earnings. I think everyone was just hoping for a blowout.
Its a buy under 120...I buy on these dips and just collect a nice dividend while you wait....Stephanie Link likes it and she is sharp as a tack.....
Its funny IBM is not a chip company.and they came out with a golden nugget
IBM said they are not buying back stock and they prioritize to reduce debt instead. At times where rates are at the lowest ever and cost of debt is abt 1% buying back stock is like investing money at 1% return while the shares are returning 10% profit!!! something is wrong there..
"Stock up $4 on the news that Buffet reduced IBM holdings by 94% and only has 2 million shared left. Daily volume near 6 million, so the 2 million left can no longer be pressure on the stock.Thank you Jesus.stochttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-buys-teva-bites-more-220536130.html"
"Go ask the best investor of century Warren Buffet to see if he dare to touch this disgusting IBM stock again. Go... if he does then you should hold or buy, if not, leave it as soon as possible."
IBM is very cheap undervalued company in contrast to MSFT/ intc / Uber

Ok I will chuckle at this lawsuit filed...IMB has been around for more years than three whipper snappers combined!!! Good luck with saying they did not start it first if your know anything about IBM is they came before MSFT!!! Close to the time of the creation of the Abacus and Pascal...
Why can't IBM ove up like the general market? Is this company going bankrupt soon like Sears and the likes ?
"Even with the dividend, IBM isn't worth it. Consider that even with dividends reinvested, IBM still lags in returns vs the S&P. Over the past 11 years, IBM has lagged the S&P in all but 3 of those years. Meaning that if you were to instead invest in SPY or VTI, you would earn more money and experience less draw-downs. If we back the clock up to 1990, the S&P returns around 10% per year while IBM returns around 7% (with dividends reinvested). Without reinvesting dividends, this stock barely moves. There doesn't seem to be a path forward for IBM. Use caution if you invest in this for the long-term."
"THIS DISASTER IS A RESULT OF THE CEO, VOTE HER OUT WHEN WE GET OUR PROXIES"
If IBM didn’t do well in this bull run they never will. I’m so disgusted with the CEO.
"For those who continue to point out the bad, that was all factored into the price before the news/numbers came out after market close. The NEW information blew away expectations (current price at close today) and show the new CEO had them on right track to return to growth and apparently explosive growth in the future. I don’t know where this will settle out tomorrow, the next day, week or months, but it is clear the turnaround is underway"
They keep losing money. This is very concerning problem with IBM.
The Old Bag CEO took over with the stock at $200/share and it's been ugly ever since
"I will soon be adding a little more to my IBM investment. But it will be one to take advantage od the regular October season rut. Thia coming report in a couple of weeks time will be the second one by new ceo AK. There will be no post covid bump , no vacinne boost for IBM, we are supposes to have seen our revenue skyrocketted in 2020 as IBM is supposed to be an IT company. It clearly did not . But hopefully this time, IBM cloud division cam continue to deliver growth enoigh revenue decline. Once that happen , the price will stop declining and makes the dividend worth it."
"why is it allowed that BMO brokerage can yell to the world they have a $152 price target on IBM, they dont tell us what they do behind the scenes so why are they allowed to tell a target number.should be illegal,,"
Ibm authorizes an additional 4 billion repurchase
Careful here folks. The IBM dividend is about as safe as a 55 year old employee at IBM.
Rommety made out with a nice paycheck. A hire within this failing company to replace her is just as bad. Whitehurst seems to not have earned $IBM trust yet even though cloud is clearly the way to go.
"Who's up for a shareholder revolt to STOP the acquisition? Yeah we'll have to pay a near-billion dollar breakup fee, but it's better than being on the hook for 33 Billion. Thumbs up if yes, thumbs down if no."
"The future of IBM is hybrid cloud, said Ian Campbell, chief executive officer of Nucleus Research. “But the biggest challenge is they are very late to the cloud party,” he said. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have dominated the public cloud space for years and IBM, once a tech titan, is considered small-fry in comparison. “Cloud is the make or break for IBM, but nobody even knows they’re there,"" Campbell said.On Tuesday, IBM announced that AT&T Inc. would be shifting its internal software applications to the IBM cloud in a multi-year agreement. This is mutually beneficial for both companies, Campbell said. “But it feels like two B-list celebrities announcing an engagement in the hopes of becoming an A-lister,” he added. “This is not going to move the needle."""
So glad I sold this turd back when it was $183/share.
"Earnings $ 17 per share in 2018, combination of lower tax return so 15% of in income to shareholders + recovery of mainframe business + acceleration on services side."
IBM and Block-chain are the future of the world economy.
"It wasn't so long ago that everyone was acting like MSFT was dead and gone. Then, miraculously, new management and a shift in emphasis. Ka-Boom. I don't know whether anyone can match what Nadella did, but IBM has a lot of tools that it can leverage if you put the right people in charge. I'm betting that - finally - IBM has the right people in charge."
I do not think China can come up with IBM quantum computer Q anytime should. US govt invest in quantum computing in IBM in digital infrastructure spending is almost certain.
"IBM is going nowhere......The company has been an internal disaster for 10 years and anyone watching its stock knows exactly where its going......it paid out 34 billion dollars to purchase RED HAT, trying to land something in tech which this once great american company had lost in its ten years of having you know whom running the company.....she basically had no idea of hi tech.....The interest on buying red hat alone is equal to almost 40% of its common dividend.....in time, IBM may not be able to support that wonderful 5.6% payout.....Once , as janet yellen said, the economy strenghtens later this year, the rise in govt interest rates to as high as 3% will wipe out any last advantage IBM has had......At the most, IBM will float around this number for a few months and then head down because other companies, especially microsoft, will advance faster than anything big blue can match.....this stock is a loser ahead......the economy is expected to move up quite fast this year as covid cases decline but IBM will not join the herd....its too dependent on its dividend and even that may not be as secure as most people think.....Check to see monthly how many hedge funds are still involved......The company has far too many employees who are producing tons of paper but nothing to truly show tech advantage.....that's all lost in its once wonderful reputation, something which has long since died....Its simply moving on a dividend today as seen by most people on this site......"
pays out 5% and goes NOWHERE. if you want a 5% bond in tech then ibm is your choice.
I don't have to pump anything on IBM stock really. It is too much undervalued. Sensible will buy no matter what.
I just run numbers. IMO should imo touch 200 in a few years.Enjoy in the meantime the current 5.5% dividend which will be raised soon imo.
Any thoughts what the dividend increase will be.
"As Linus said, ""What's that?? What's that?? ..."" Could we possibly have two positive trading days in a roll????"
I'm out. There's just not enough upside here. Moving my $$ into a few pre-IPO SPACs for a quick gain.
IBM - the gift that keeps on taking.
"What a sad commentary!!!! IBM continues to disappoint. I'm beginning to wonder if Krishna just isn't another Rometty. I'm an IBM retiree with more than 30 years service knowing first-hand what the company was and what it appears to be now. I've now finally lost faith in the management/BOD's ability to fix the problems. SAD,SAD,SAD."
"Not trying to be a Downer, but how can we compete with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon in the Cloud business? Isn't that a little scary? Aren't our competitors too muscular? That is why Warren Buffet turned tail and ran out. He hasn't been seen since. Or will Red Hat change everything? Hey - do I even know what I'm talking about?"
$NTNX surge is definitely $IBM related. They talked about M&A in the course of the spin-off - could see a decent fit there.
IBM is a steal at this price. Not bad to enter get in at this level and will get 1.50/share dividend next week. This baby should be flirting 200 at the coming earnings report due to the good news on the reverse of revenue decline and showing good grows in its cloud and security business and its outlook. IBM's intellectual right alone is worth much much than its current price. I have been accumulating and will add more next week. happy trading and good luck to all.
is it really down 15% in after hours. what happened?
Got a feeling Ginny's tenure will be over by year end. Buy.
Watson is the King. Watson will change the world.
"I am a current shareholder and want ro add mire shares, and wondering if it would be a good time to purchase some more shares before earnings call after earnings call, or after the split, I believe a good buying opportunity is around $125 any thoughts,"
"ACTIVIST INVESTOR come save us, we'll all vote your wishes"
"Friends,FYI, IBM dividend record date is 2/8/2019.PAY Date is 3/9/2019. @ $ 1.57 per shareGO IBM!!jg"
Crossing $140 resistance and heading to $150 before the next earnings!
"at this point, I think no one will leave the ship for Monday, really want to see a 3% push before next Tuesday"
Fairly big miss on an already very low expectations top line. Their business is drying up faster than anyone was expecting. At least they managed to massage the numbers so they got to the low bar bottom line.
"so now it will take 3 to 6 months for IBM to get back to maybe 134 again,, Dividends next month so you might get a chase up, but tahts it"
less then 6 months ago trading $158 as Ginny failed to sell Buffett which proved to be correct. The new CEO immediately into Cloud. Only problem 10 year behind MSFT. Lots of hype but the fact is the 1 yr target is $127. A real mgmt failure
Is it really that bad?
My feeling is Tesla will replace IBM in dow 30 in no time. Still IBM splitting is the best decision for IBM moving forward. RHAT and the best of IBM will combine to do what they can to compete against supergiants but the rest of IBM would be jettisonned off
"I'm feeling good, Boys. I'm feeling good about IBM. Block-chain is gonna be huge. We don't need Warren Buffet one bit. Good riddance."
"post earnings bounce has evaporated...shorts are back in control for the foreseeable future, or until the board steps up and does whats necessary....not likely...major shareholders, instead of trying to force their hand, are justbailing. WB will most likely announce he's almost totally out..."
"no comment... just for the record...cloud revenue in 2019...1. Microsoft - 44,70B2. Amazon - 35,03B3. IBM - 21,20B4 Google - 8,92Bwill look at the numbers again at the end of 2020..."
and netflix rallys with .75 eps and a share price worth almost double. this market makes no sence right now. but it will soon. IBM remains a much safer investment then FANG and related stocks.
Now she’s out; this company might be worth investing in
Will go back to $130 soon
"As a happy long time Red Hat investor to a new, not so happy ""small stake"" IBM investor I can only say that I hope the leadership of Red Hat will find a way to take control of the mother ship.... IBM's Phoenix payroll system for the gov't of Canada has been a complete disaster...the contract has been lost! Proof to me that the legacy leadership of IBM needs an overhaul."
I start to see IBM recruiting jobs increasing. It implies business are picking up
IBM and HON are still working and developing quantum computers. If you got a 20 year time horizon with your portfolio these companies are a must have for a nice profitable future and nice dividends. Build those positions!
IBM new CEO runs a war room on sealing deal every week. And that’s what the sales forces are incented to go get done. This is why deals are ramming up. Job well done.
To much debt.
I've held for most of this century and am about to unload it... losing patience.On the other hand sometimes when a stock drops like this its time to add to holdings....I just don't know.
how can a company with around -90 bucks net tangible assets be called undervalued. they are milking legacy systems from the 60's and living off the government.
It will never get back to 170 while KOO KOO Ginny is in the ceo chair! It took another kick in the groin today! DO YOUR JOB BOD and find someone who can run this company!
IBM will release earnings after hour today. The market doesn’t look too excited about it. Hopefully it will go up a few dollars. Brought it at 130. Can l even break even?
ibm rip to the upside starts at 5
WOW Intel CEO has resigned citing improper relations with another Intel employee. This is nonsense an excuse for the bad shape Intel is on many fronts products fab lack of leadership... in addition to him selling all his shares he could admitting 20% loss of market to AMD etc. Intel cannot site real reason of course as it will doom their future but.. its doomed...So why Ginni is still holding to the CEO position at 61 years of age.. after all past CEOs ibm had left at 60? Was ginni si great the past 6 years? Just hyped and excuses while ibm goes down.. layoffs to fix losses of sales and profits won't help. Why ibm doesn't take actions to replace all their leadership that has failed? Still bad times ahead for sure...
"Where's the new CEO? He seems to be the rather quiet type. Maybe he has nothing to say for himself or maybe mama Ginny doesn't let him, or both."
wow IBM is up 13cents after hours. AMZN only up $100+
What’s not to love about IBM at these prices? Downside risk into earnings is very low...and any good news will send this stock +7%. We will be back to $130 in no time. Enjoy your weekend and make some money next week.
"It is mind boggling why IBM is lagging behind other tech companies, when it makes more money than all those high flyers! It may be purely an issue of lack of confidence in the management to grow the business and/or capitalise on the technologies it possess. Hope it does not end up like Kodak, which has not monetized the digital technology and simply became irrelevant. That should be a lesson for IBM. Good heavens, somebody need to kick the IBM management to wake up and move faster! Let us pray that Arvind is the guy, like Nadella for Microsoft..."
"The dividend yield is fantastic and the absolute amount is nothing to sneeze at. Now what we need is REAL growth both top and bottom line WITH guidance from management that will get the stock up and running. INSTEAD we have a PC BOD and CEO who are 100% clueless and with absolutely no foresight!! Spinning off the legacy business is meaningless, as stockholders we're going to have two poorly mismanaged companies to watch painfully erode over time. First step is revamp the entire BOD as NONE of them has any real experience in the IT, Cloud, open source, even legacy business; we need people who know what to do AND NOT people who cater the PC idiocy. Second, get Rometty out of IBM totally; replacing her and putting her on the BOD is meaningless. Third, get rid of the ""Nadella"" wannabe; this guy's a total snoozer with ZERO foresight. And finally, put Jim Whitehurst as CEO and Chairman of the Board. IBM bought (and probably over paid) Red Hat for a reason and the rest of the IT world was a bit envious; but again, due to really lousy management, the Red Hat acquisition hasn't lived up to its potential."
Enjoy your 4-5% dividend while IBM doubles over the next 3 years. All is good.
Cramer high on IBM Red Hat deal. IBM is a Buy. Buy Buy Buy. Technicals good.
I’ll really be surprised if IBM price goes up after earnings. They typically disappoint. This is what I’m expecting on the price.
"What is the outlook for IBM's block-chain technology business? Is it defunct? I don't know. It was once touted as the ""second coming."" Is it still a promising source of revenue for IBM? Or a dud? Serious question for anyone knowledgeable on the topic. Thanks in advance."
Bought on weaknesses this morning! Blockchain is hot like AI
"Ate up shares between 109 and 110. This is a nice recovery. Was waiting for the double digits to crank up the loader, but it never happened"
Typical pattern - sharply up in the morning followed by slow afternoon fade. This stock is possessed!
"AMZN shares have risen $400 since the beginning of the year. 2.7 times the value of the IBM shares. Can somebody maybe wake someone up at IBM, I think they overslept."
Time for a pull back
"Dear God, as a 30 year veteran of IBM, I wish this incompetent CEO would resign and take the clueless BOD and senior management along with her out the door. Enough already! What a sad commentary on what this company has become."
"Can we expect IBM increase dividend again as in April, 2017? It is a dividend aristocrat ? only 50 stocks have achieved Dividend Aristocrat status by increasing their dividend payments annually for at least 25 consecutive years. IBM is one of the rare gem that is showing its moat"
"Merry Christmas from IBM...here is your layoff notice and BTW, if your thinking about finding a job elsewhere in IBM, good luck but if your on the layoff list, you wont get hired by another department because they have been told NOT to take anyone on the layoff list( senior management direction)."
"Oh ye of little faith, we told you this was coming. Next qtr will be a bigger surprise, Oh ye of little faith!!"
"I understand many are disappointed for their recent losses but this stock ticker is definitely a buy. IBM fair value now is $134 and we have great dividends. If someone ignore hedge stock which has good dividends and is undervalued, then it is huge miss."
i guess IBM will and shiuld break itself up for faster growth
What happened to Watson? Shouldn’t Watson have figured out coronavirus treatment already?
"Awe come on. Red Hat was a Hail Mary by a poorly performing CEO. By the time this deal closes, new technology will have overtaken. Buying a company like Red Hat at a whopping premium is not hard, particularly after other companies turned it down. Running a tech company and making it prosper IS hard. The CEO Rometty is not talented enough to do this. SHE HAS GOT TO GO NOW, before IBM becomes GE. SHE MUST GO NOW!!!! Or it will be too late."
ibm business is picking jp.
IBM is the Sears of tech..too reliant on old outbased model
Couldn't understand the overreaction. Bought more AH
IBM dying gradually ... no future as I can see (Redhat is also dead under them)
"looks like IBM is finally turning the corner, and moving this monster dinasor to a solid software company that takes advantage of latest technology and provide solutions as they always done as a core business. looks we are going in the right direction"
What's up with IBM today? Unusual activity.
"No Ginny is revealing a lot of upside underneath the hood. Buy, buy, buy!"
sell IBM buy Apple.
Well they listened
"Overvalued - Undervalued , NVDA $243.00......, AMD $11.82, MSFT $92.00, IBM $156.18, AAPL $172.43. Buy, buy, buy the undervalued."
"Just a quick poll please Thumbs up - move to Reddit for better user interface less soam, politics, ads botsThumbs down - stay here Yes Yahoo has quites integrated but we don't look at that all the time. ..I hope! If enough people wants to move, I'll move there assuming $xlnx too, perhaps even $ibm ?"
"New CEO, additionally Gary Cohn, improving margins, reconfigured business model all point to a better outlook for IBM. Buy the dips."
smart contract king. Massive opp
"While no one is looking, IBM is moving up. Now that Buffett is out I expect to see IBM move back to 200. Afterall they are in right industry with a huge ROE of around 70%"
"Red Hat people should be taking IBM to the next level, younger aggressive blood needed,stock will reach $175 this year"
This is the market telling IBM that Ginny and her cronies must go.....
Warren Buffet has enough cash to offer in buying out IBM. His thesis on IBM is still valid. He could use the gain in APPLE to buy out IBM. Investment bankers should knock on his door.
bears go to the hairdresser today... xo
ibm raised a dividend from 1.5 to 1.57 gold shares
is Ginny leaving? Stock will up at least 10% if she is leaving.
150.00 soon.
Management change + Gary Cohn + Hybrid Cloud = $200 per share. Buy the lights out at the current quote.
rometty to step down.
"Financial specific cloud is an brilliant idea! It is because that I believe that banks cannot trust Amazon cause it may become a competitor to the banks, and smart CEO knows that. Microsoft platform is too small and not suitable for banks. WHo is left. IBM with dominant in banking clients and global supports. Banks and govt. love to outsourced to IBM that can supports multi clouds with excellent enterprise service. You cannot even see a Microsoft consultant when you are on Azure and Amazon probably, let alone they understand the business of banking , insurance, asset management, utility etc. IBM suites still have a broad reach to the executives with moat."
Red Hat
I got out an made a cup of coffee thanks ibm for the coffee
"One years worth of dividend, gone, poof in AH trading."
$127 target should woulda listened to Buffet at 160 two three years a decade late to the Cloud
"buying a washington crony insider so this is good for a few dollar pop, but not sure how this helps them innovate and grow."
"https://www.investopedia.com/news/ibm-traders-see-stock-rising-10-despite-weak-outlook/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahooInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM) stock has fallen 20% in 2018, most of it in the October sell-off. The stock's decline reflects the company's weak third-quarter results followed by its $34 billion acquisition Red Hat Inc. ( RHT). Now, IBM investors may get a bit of good news."
IBM paying $34 bil for a company that was on track for roughly $300 mil in net income. What an amazing valuation!
In the 60’s IBM put men in space and on the moon.... Now we can build a better battery than EverReady... how￼￼ far they have come.IBM = International Battery Manufacturer
IBM better know something the shareholders don't know.....paying 11 times REVENUE (RH rev= $3B) is a very big premium.
$ibm new cloud using AMD's EPYC Rome has launched ALL OVER THE WORLD! This is full service available at all locations IBM has cloud computing. Are you surprised why we're deep green and $nvda $intc red?
"former CFO as NewCo CEO, hahahahaha, the whole spinoff was just another financial engineering that IBM has been playing for years and now it seems like they overplayed it. Someone will bust IBM soon enough, I can foresee under $50 a share within 2 years."

Abandon ship!
"SHAREHOLDERS Start the Call for ACTIVIST INVESTORS to rescue us, we'll all join in for new direction and new CEO NOW,new ceo worth $50 point jump proxy vote coming"
I'm going down with the ship. but wow this is painful
Re evaluating going on
"Another $52 week low today! Ginny needs to exit the door or be kicked out by the end of the year, hopefully! :-("
Will close just above $150 today
"It seems like the end of one of the longest bull market in history! Too bad IBM longs never got a break, thanks to Gianni! Now IBM may continue to collapse along with the bear market and I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock price gets closer $100! JMHO...Tex"
So warren Buffoon sold his ibm to buy apple and ibm soars while apple falls...Maybe Charlie munger should take over ?
"big day monday, forward statements will give stock a $5 point jump, plus eps will surprise, great day ahead"
we need it to open $150. If I'm not asking too much.
insiders looked like they are buying always a good sign..
"Today Ginny signed on to a letter with outer tech companies wanting to stop the effort in Washington to limit H4 and H1-B visas. if these tech companies get their way, more Americans will loose their jobs. IBM has no loyalty to its hard working American team. Its all about money!"
"IBM debt 46.46B, cashflow 12B. Google debt: 3.3B, cashflow 120B. Go figure!"
I said long ago: GINI should step down if IBM wants to change!Now IBM shares can move higher!
About sums it uphttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3fdZWbIsrFk&fbclid=IwAR1O9ub1pkXLx2afzf7ZF21w5QLnKU557NGcCIg0ttN0jf8oOavrSjHYjFQ
Increasing gross margins are the key to success.
The price of political correctness...
Is it time to remove IBM from the DJI? 10yrs of decline s/b enough to remove and replace.
"IBM will get a 30+ multiple within 18 months! Earning were AMAZING! Red Hat growth is the stuff dreams are made of, hybrid cloud opportunity is mind boggling! Paying down debt like a sailor spends money on leave. Cloud SAAS, model will throw off so much cash, IBM will be able to pay off debt, double dividend and Continue to buy more SAAS companies as well as make huge investments in R&D and talent. $300 in 12 months"
"Compare to SNOW, this stock is way too undervalued. Redhat is established company with revenue at billions"
"AMZN reports next week... IBM cloud not growing, if AMZN cloud services are growing we could see a second punch down."
vote your proxy shared. time for the shareholders to take action. the bod wont
I'm thoroughly amazed that IBM didn't get kicked out of the Dow like the others....
IBM for 5g equipment Big Blue A USA team member
added more at 137.50
"And in continuation to my $ibm insiders buying shares - 3 directors - this play was done before. In 2018 IBM's CEO bought $3m worth of shares... wasn't smart... imagine if she would have bought AMD lol she is losing still now LolJust shows you how you must do you own research! Rometty is chairman of the Board. ..maybe her friends on the board agree to buy to suggest it's going well just as in 2018?Search ""IBM CEO Rometty buys $3 million in company stock"""
"The sad reality is this stock is going to be mired down for some time. The ceo won't leave and the board of eunuchs won't toss her out. Pathetic situation to endure. With a new ceo - Whitehurst, investors would have so much more confidence and it would immediately be reflected in a much higher stock price. So much for Sarbanes Oxley allowing packing of BoDs- useless law."
"I invest in companies that pay dividends not because of the dividends, I invest in them because they can afford to pay dividends.Call me old fashioned but isn’t the goal of a company to make money and share it with investors??"
Full on value breakout. Buy!
New CEO needs couple quarters to prove that he is heading in the right direction. IBM WILL BE FINE!
"I've had IBM at a higher price, unfortunately before the crash. Bought a bunch to bring down my cost, now 119. I do like the new heads he brought in and think longer term it will bear fruit. I expect this year to be basically flat as the new focus and vision begins to take shape. I have nowhere better to put cash than IBM with over a %5 div while I wait. I owned MS at 29.50 when many said it was ""dead money"" Yeah it took 6-8 years but look at MS now! I still own that. The cloud business is the right space with plenty of cash for all players. I think IBM only has market share to gain, it's so small now anything would help."
what we really need here is one nice short squeeze like in GameStop...
"That means FUND sells the POP, it is under distribution, Sell more than Buy causeprice drop.I'd look for 149$ support which is 200DMA long term trend support"
Won’t be long before the 3% short positions scare. Better sales/ earnings next qtr will set off a new investment appraisal ... & 5.3% dividend absolutely secured!
Congrats to everyone at IBM for the new cloud deal with Juniper Networks and Vodafone ! That’s great news and we need more of it...
Jumped in. Looking forward to the years ahead.
"please notice that Vanguard holds nine BILLION dollars worth of IBM stock and that Blackrock holds $7.3BILLION in shares. you wont see any of these huge holders selling, they love the high div. this is a $400 stock two yeArs out."
"IBM geared to upside movement! So many reasons to buy now and continue to deposit a nice dividend. A solid company, great investment for future growth!"
the future belongs to the machine!!!
Who was lucky enough to pick up shares @ 95? Sorry I missed it!
"Remember the IBM Roadmap, which touted a $20 EPS target for 2015? It's now 2019 and IBM's annual EPS forecast is $13.90."
Good numbers. Great earnings. Turnaround story is intact. Cannot wait for Red Hat.
"ginny gone is very very good news. IBM is flying up 8 from its low today.She was awful -- overpaid, given too many options, incompetent."
IBM's top line is in steady decline over the years. It will inevitably lose its status as a Dow component eventually. This company needs help to survive.
I guess this is the future with IBM and very soon producing cheaper hydrogen from natural gas using this unique collaboration : https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-ibm-red-hat-announce-162200523.html
Best way for IBM to get net zero emissions would be to lay off half the non-technical MBA VPs
I will buy at $115 or better
IBM reported revenue decline of 3.5% and beat earnings estimates by a nickle. Means that they cut CAPEX to create more earnings. No growth. imho
Why is IBM down so much today? Did they form a blood clot?
"1 Month : MACD +, OBV +, Money Flow +"
CEO talks today
Think Beamer gonna reclaim lost glory 200 a share soon!
"Leadership by the numbers:Ginny (2013 to 2020) PPS $214 to $136 (-36% decline over seven years or -5% per year)During the same time:Dow 30: 14,500 to 30,491 (+110% or 16% per year)Nasdaq: 3,300 to 12,895 (+291% or 42% per year)The new team:Jan 30 before the announcement: $136Feb 6th after announcement $156 (apparently there were people happy with GR leaving - see above)Dec 30th $124 (-21% from after the news)While AI is certainly the future, their unrealistic expectation that they could garner an unsubstantiated premium like other players in the space, is not resonating. ""Meet the new boss....same as the old boss...""(The Who)When Wall St. believes in the future of the company, they will tank the PPS and load up.Looking for a sub $99 entry point."
Ginny was possibly the worst CEO in the last decade. Arvind will break up the company to confuse investors and clients to a valuation point that even trading rubles may receive fractional percentages of value... If IBM didn't buy Red hat what would the valuation be? The bigger question is how did IBM improve the value proposition for clients leveraging Red hat???... IBM has a long and very strong history of destroying valuation of acquisitions all the way back to ROHM and Lotus.. BTW what ever happened to those 2 acquisitions???
This stock will rise 10 points the day Ginny resigns...she will never get fired....
"Free cash flow starts to increase again. Thanks to the New CEO in enacting the Redhat acquisition. Surprisingly, it left even extra cash to continue stock buyback that was supposed to be stopped for 2 years. The growth must be very good with Redhat which reward with a CEO position."
How IBM's board stays so pat on Ginny is beyond reason. Fire her and the stock jumps $10 immediately.
"Biden just announced his tax plan which will raise the tax brackets for personal income and investments including capital gains. Corporate taxes will go back to the Obama days when we had 8% real unemployment. The money WONT go to paying down the deficit, it is earmarked for democrat social programs to pay people NOT to work, sign up more of us on to the govt dole so control can be setup over YOUR LIFE!"
"Buffet is not comfortable with tech stks. Apple is not a tech stk but a consumer discretionary stk. Therefore, with ibm being outside his comfort zone Buffet has reduced or possibly eliminated his ibm position.. However, this may prove to be in error."
"This is how they are making the balance sheet look better. REPORTED IN MARCH by Ruters: IBM plans to cut roughly 10,000 Global Technology Services (GTS) jobs as part of a plan to redeploy about 30 percent of the group’s 100,000 employees, according to The Register. An IBM spokesman declined comment about the report, according to Ruters. March 29, 2018, Update: IBM layoffs apparently include cloud, Watson & sales employees"
"Big Blue is back. 4% yield, accelerating ""new imperatives "" businesses, restructure of Global Services driving margins higher and Blockchain momentum.....Look for a big move up after earnings with many reallocating funds..."
Scooped up shares at 110.15. Too cheap to pass up
It is set for and up swing to $145.00 by end of November 2020. Now is the time to buy. All news is positive and we will pass $150.00 before thanksgiving.
"Disappointing. With no positive follow thru to Friday's nice jump, it's beginning to look like a ""nothing burger""."
IBM is a solid company. Players are going to play.
Ibm is a sinking ship being propped up by the morons holding onto it for dividend why do you think they pay so much cause otherwise no one would touch this dinosaur. They are banking on red hat to save them in the hybrid cloud but are late to the party dell and VMware already have relationships with aws azure and google good luck bag holders you already lost dividend for the year and then some today!
"Different people are good at doing different things. Ginni Rometty was good at restructuring IBM, now Arvind Krishna will take IBM into the new high growth phase."
"Would IBM need China's approval for this deal to go though? If so, it ain't gonna happen. So, there is a chance, IBM shareholders can be saved from disaster wreaked by evil Rometty..."
I cannot believe how much waste in this company in terms of so many management layer. CEO please compact the thing and remove a bit from the highly paid management exec layer. Really unnecessary and goes to waste big time. Big money spent on those many many exec layers. Please we are all stakeholders in this. Do something to help.
"Bad time for IBM. This stock should be at least $140 by January. AMZA, AAPL , etc are all way down now due to the latest downward trend. Once settled down, I still believe IBM will take off."
Imagine if IBM didn't kick Bill Gates to the curb... Has to be to biggest corporate blunder in history.
IBM's quantum-safe cloud impressed institutions
dividend raised. I'll take it
When is the peroxide CEO going to get a golden parachute?
Guys be very careful here! IBM just had massive sales layoffs worldwide - not a good sign!
if IBM beats today by a decent margin than it will set the market on fire
"Major companies is in cloud business are as follows;Amazon, microsoft , google , alibaba, vmware , opentext and many more in cloud business .Ibm is going to have lot of competition in getting new business."
"Why is IBM not a competitor to Huawei, Ericson, NokiaA USA company that learned how to dance with elephantsBut let meaningful opportunities slip awaySurely there is somebody at big blue now....or in the past that saw the future more clearly than the present procedure oriented bureaucratic managementHELLO"
"IBM down 26 percent in 2018, we need a CEO change ....."
"I'm seriously looking to buying into IBM. Obviously the economy is deep in the toilet and the market can be expected to retest and, likely, descend into new lows before the economy recovers. What are you guys expectations for IBM stock price lows given such expectation of another pullback?"
Redhat CEO suceeding Ginni will be the positive move like replacing Ballmer at Microsoft
Need see 140 this week
"The BOD may be having difficulties in replacing Rometty despite her record of failure only matched by thehistoricall outstandingly worst CEOs ...and she is past normal retirement age for IBM executives...these difficulties may in part be due to her being a woman, and thus perhaps not subject to the same standards as male CEOs. As hasbeen remarked repeatedly, Dr. Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, and an actual technologist, would as CEO solve thediversity issue. Her choice would elevate IBM stock by likely more than 10% on announcement."
"If IBM were aquired by a SPAQ, it would be $1,000 today. IBM is LOADED future tech. Buying today is like stealing!"
"Looks like Buffett is finished selling, he was the one blocking the stock. Q4 is supposed to be 1st quarter of sales growth in 22 quarters, so something to celebrate and hopefully the start of a new bull market for IBM. On the tax cut alone, IBM earnings will spike an additional 15% so earnings are not $ 14 in 2018 but rather $ 16 to $ 17 per share, with some growth. That means we trade at about 9 times earnings which is very low."
i like the six buck div
"gee whiz, is there ever going to be a day IBM can see 130, the dow has peaked for life and IBM is the biggest failure in the markets"
$115-112 is a fair value
"IBM is flooding the US Open with ads, They are not afraid to spend money to promote their name and products,"
"it might have been a dog of the dow, but today er shows this dog can hunt. off to the woodshed for the shorts"
CEO...please leave...this is another GE
"IBM Cloud and outsourcing was once a very lean quality organization that drove IBM's earnings over hardware/software sales. The Organization was flat with only 2-3 layer of management. Now its BLOATED with middle managers who could not manage a rest room properly. layoffs coming in June, it will hit the ranks hard while middle managers get their bonuses. TIME for action BOD!"
"Another IBM PC promotion: Kathryn Guarini, a 20-plus year IBM veteran named as new CIO replacing previous CIO leaving to ""pursue other activities."" In other news, former Watson leaders join Marketplacer prior to Marketplacer's IPO!!! What does that tell you??!!! HINT: the real IBM talent are leaving and IBM management continues to flounder BUT PC-wise IBM is doing a ""fine"" job!!!"
"People should check out the exciting Products from Redhat. It is amazing that it has command many popular software products. I thought it was just OS, it is more than that now. I know OpenStack is popular based on some job ads. Jboss is another, It has the Anisibke automation and management tools which is badly needed in the Cloud environment. The best alignment and differentiation is that it aligns with IBM on the Hybrid Cloud which is the reality for Enterprise. The best kickers are that there are lots of providers are certified on these platform. IBM has gained a tremendous eco systems which it is needing. Again, let the Redhat CEO run IBM. I think he will do a great job. I hope the board is listening."
"165 by Memorial Day, !!!"
Starting to approach very attractive levels as I expect IBM to be trading in the $180-$190 range in 2 years. For those with patience time to think about accumulating.
"WOW IBM really lives in the past, just read what happens when ""Queen "" Rometty visits, thtas a Joke, the CEos whatever live on another planet, https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/28/ibm_chief_rometty_texas_staff/ So good i am,out of here, Ibms doomed"
"You know IBM is heading back into the $130s in the next month or so. Could be higher, could be sooner. Good chance here to make a few dollars......."
hope ibm uses some of that 3billion in their stock buy back money to buy shares today. they can buy back 19m shares at this price. plus good for us as thats less owners to pay a dividend to when they announce dividends on april 24th. good job on cloud revenue and transitioning to future growth
140 after earnings........guaranteed
with that kind of earning Div cut is coming
Watson says call SEC in morning and sell sell sell
Market seems to like new acquisition. Sounds like a nice fit.
"Beat on earning, great dividend. Who cares it misses a bit on rev as long as its cloud growth accelerate faster"
"I love the Execs here, this is a value Stock, only one left. hara krishna runs this well"
"BASHERS, your opinions expired at 3:59pm today"
lift off!
merger with Google makes sense. It will expand both companies markets.
Time to buy this stock :)
"Ok let's settle the ""dividend saves me argument"" The Total dividend over the past 5 years is approximately $23/share. IBM closed at $131 on February 1 2016 (5 years ago). Let's add the $23 to today's closing price so $118 + $23 = $131. Lo and behold you are at the 2016 close of February 1. Even with the dividend you made NOTHING in 5 years and cash returned more, not to mention what the FAANG stocks did in 5 years."
I Hope some good news also on the way to boost the move
It’s amazing that dividend is still being paid. Real operating earnings don’t cover the dividend anymore.
Best new innovative cloud company
"Since announcing Redhat 'deal', IBM stock went DOWN signiificantly while the SECTOR went UP!Hey Ginnie the accountant, the market iteling you that you are OVERPAYING for that stock!"
Ginni will earn $20 million in total compensation this year and cost shareholders billions.
Typical won’t hold gains
Good day! Crossing $140
BOD allowing company demise to accommodate CEO’s gender. We need a Gertsner type to shake up co. before it’s too late-she has had more than enough time and all we’ve gotten is excuses “we’ll do better next quarter.” Enough is enough!!!
Why we down so mush?
"Just checking in on this frustrating stock. Have owned it at 150 for what seems like, ever. One more quarter. If this thing doesn’t start moving and hold, time to move on in Q2 2021."
More evidence how an failed affirmative action women CEO ruins another company like iBM while she banks millions into her bank account and with get millions for a golden parachute when IBM drops below 100. Wave the flag and get you chills Karl Marx was right- Capitalistic pigs!!
"You gotta believe IBM will get the 'DJIA boot' pretty soon, as it becomes 'little blue' at an alarming rate.."
Cloudera CLDR just partners with Red Hat Openshift. Moving up through expansion in cloud. Excellent
2023 150 call options have been looking nice for me :) big buyer swooped and bought 400 of em a couple days ago.. long term looking good. 
"This is the Microsoft 5 years ago. Super growth stage is upon it. I have seen a lot of IBM cloud services job ads and calls as Enterprise is embracing its new offerings that is secure, with assisted migration plan, and with choices both on prem , hybrid and on the cloud."
"Rometty took over in 2011 and the downward trend started right then and there. I have heard every excuse from the ""mess"" that Sam Palimasano left to ""transforming IBM"". Whatever. The bottom line is that this company needs to FIRE ROMETTY!! But they won't. She has stacked the board of directors and the 'optics' from firing a 'woman' is what they are afraid of. So IBM will continue to tumble down the tubes until the board members are forced by the shareholders to do what is necessary. FIRE ROMETTY and take her first two tiers of ""leadership"" with her!! It may not be as bad as the problems in the early 1990's but it is rapidly getting there! I would not buy this stock even if it was $50 per share!"
"Wasn't someone on the board lamenting that he had to pay $125 a share? Hope he feels better, now."
"Buffet misses IBM. He has regrets. Why do you think he bought Red Hat? It's because he was too proud to come crawling back to IBM, hat in hand."
"Moving averages are rising, bullish indication in MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
What will happen to our dividends?
what a screw ball name for a company!
Zachs project 6% growth for IBM for 2021That is my opinion why the stock poped through its 152 prior top
"buffett is out, no drop in after hours"
At some point IBM becomes a takeover target. AAPL would be an interesting suitor.
"While I concede that IBM is struggling, I don't believe this is simply down to management. The reason why IBM is struggling is because the competition is ferocious."
Is very interesting article... https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-07-18/ibm-beats-thanks-near-record-low-tax-rate-revenue-barely-grows
I love IBM waiting for Google and Amazon get hit with anti trust
"even after the $12 wack job IBM still wants to head lower, looks like institutions are dumping until major change. IBM could slowly drift to $130's"
"OK, Warren. You win. Apple's a better stock than IBM. I give up"
"for all those that wanted the CEO fired,,,, what do you say today stock up 6 points"
"Can we hope for an announcement for the retirement of Ginny today? Isn’t she close to the mandatory age? Stuck around IBM for couple years, they need to announce the Red Hat CEO as the future leader soon."
Don’t own a nickel of IBM but i suddenly feeling interested especially if we see an initial drop in stock price on this news. Long term this could be an awesome buy.
"If you want to own IBM for income, go right ahead. But if capital gains is what you're looking for this stock will make you miserable. IBM will reliably help your portfolio outperform the S&P the way a junk car will reliably not break down. I know I'm going to get lots of thumbs down but the simple fact is MSFT and AAPL spin circles around this company. I see a very narrow probability that IBM will find a way to scale Watson and also return to its glory days. If capital returns are what you're after this is not the stock for you."
"Quantum computing. (BTW, this board can't move the stock.)"
IBM is the leading company in Block-Chain and Machine Learning. 2021 is the year for IBM
"our ceo is way below in knowledge our needs, mgmt. at RED HAT should be running the combined mgmt. team including for sure the CEO job"
$165 this week.
This falls below 120 all I can say is Honey im betting the house
Multi week runner here to catch up. 5% yield folks come on
"IBM plunges tomorrow as ex div takes place then with zero buyers its all down hill,,"
Next stop $125 / share. All aboard !
"Adios Ginni. This departure was long overdue. But IBM is so far behind ""new tech""that IBM will be likely never ever catch up. Ginni was sound asleep and had absolutelyno idea what was happening -- the cloud was literally way over her head.I will be watching to see if IBM hires some young ""new tech"" hotshot."
when is the CEO leaving
The only reason why they have a dividend is to keep you invested while you lose your principal. The payout ratio is almost 100%. Too much cash is going to pay that dividend. This company needs to find a new market. imho
"IBM should have gone into making Robots, using their skill set in AI etc., Cloud is already saturated with Amazon, Microsoft, Google etc., Why not get into Robotic hardware that FANG cannot compete?"
What happened to “Watson”?
"more women work at IBM then men I might be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, don't think so. ,,,,,,,,,"

How does she not get fired???
"Shareholders must still approve this reckless purchase. If we are to judge this decision on Ginni's past performance, my vote will be 'NO'. Her visions for success at IBM are anything BUT visionary"
"Main frame, main frame, and main frame === enough said RELAX"
"when is the next buy time for IBM, i am out at 124.60 waiting for a good point again,,"
"Again, IBM continues the cascade of incompetent CEO's is similar to instructing it's leadership to rearrange the chairs on the deck of the Titanic. IBM has lost all sense of market dynamics. IBM should take the lead and dismiss it's leadership and let Watson make the leadership decisions."
"IBM might be the Blackberry of tech. Always a little behind, trapped by its own size and lack of innovation. Short to $70."
"SCO v. Novell: An SCO v. Novell juror posted this in Groklaw on April 19, 2010:What the Judge Still Has to Decide in SCO v. NovellBy AnonymousApril 19 2010>>That leaves unspoken the answer to whether that means the jury thought it was not the intention of the APA that the copyrights transfer, but I believe that is what they meant. If they thought the copyrights were supposed to transfer, they would have answered that question with a yes. But does Judge Stewart agree?I was on the jury. In deliberations we agreed that the APA could have transferred some of the copyright rights without necessarily transferring ownership. We agreed that the written contract was the best indicator of the parties intent.It seemed clear that the intent of the deal was for Santa Cruz to develop UNIXWare, and that they would own any copyrights associated with the new development.It was also clear that Novell intended to reserve some of the copyright rights to itself, which is how it could expect direct Santa Cruz/SCO how to act with regards to the licenses that produced the revenue stream.A number of confusing points remained: Frankenburg's testimony that (C) transferred; The board minutes stating they did not; the written contract being the best indicator of the parties intent at the time of the deal; Tor's testimony that (C) were withheld; no testimony from Santa Cruz's lawyers from the APA negotiation; Santa Cruz/SCO doing business until 2003 without the (C) being an issue; Sabbath vs. Amadia in negotiation of A2 (Sabbaths' clerical error vs. Amadia not being authorized to change APA); Why A2 changed only schedule 1.1b and not 1.1a if the intent was to include copyrights; why A2 was so vague as to which rights were required for Santa Cruz to operate; why no one noticed during the review period that (C) were excluded in 1.1b.The evidence seemed to work out to a tie, and per the instructions we had to find in favor of Novell. We did agree that it was possible for Novell to assign all of the rights of copyright without transferring ownership.01:11 PM EDTIt seems SCO v. Novell was decided by stealth jurors."
"IBM, need to be more agile to adopt new technology, in 2 hours we will find out has fast they are moving."
Scary I know. After Buffett dumped Valueline Dividend portfolio dumped it but at the bottom Valueline added it to the Income and appreciation portfolio but now Valueline is out of it. I am thinking more and more has been revealed probably not good. A miss I think is likely. IBM been good for a long time.
Folks why is ibm resurging ?
"IBM runs are long winded. Its going to run for about 2 weeks, Maybe a bit less but its going to $160"
low for IBM may be around $80 between now and early may some scary stuff still ahead
How long are investors and the board going to tolerate the failure of Ginny....
Remember 30 percent of the sales force in the US was laid off in January. The other 70 percent was shuffled around to new accounts. Do you really think these sellers are going to turn in growth in Q1?
Fantastic numbers Big Blue. Fantastic!
This is not the follow through I anticipated.
I took in more at 127.50 to lower my cost basis. I think I need a tranquilizer. !!!! Long term hold for me...... we shall see....brutal performance but can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I will start buying on $60..
Indian Americans have an excellent track record as CEO's right from Sundar Pichai to Satya Nadella. Wish everyone the best.
"Had a conversation with a friend who works in IBM. Many good people left the company, the mood is gloomy and everyone are checking the job options"
IBM will soon be like Kodak Company.
Price action definitely reflecting IBM reassessing its dividend model to a more appropriate level given current situation = definite cut or suspension likely to be announced at the next ER.
What people get wrong is that Buffett sold the reported 17 million shares last quarter. The remainder was probably all sold this quarter and is what pummeled the stock back down to pre-earnings report levels from the 162 level. I believe Buffett is completely out of IBM at this point. Good riddance!
"Shocking how Intel fell behind in the chip process, progress.It is big news from IBM."
So what's happened since Buffett starting selling -- that the world discovered it still needs mainframes? IBM should be near $200 on the last earnings report.
Why the big drop today?
"Would have been a higher close today, probably over $140 if it hadn’t been for a general market sell off."
For every share IBM buys saves over 10 yrs 60 bucks and they have 4.5 bill in buy back=== do the math. O Warren is still a major holder just taking some profits we all did RIGHT. Today time to start buying back NO stock goes straight up or down AMEN and I am still ahead BUT not even close to wait I was a month ago.
"Pudding at last! The plans are working. Yes, other companies are growing revenues faster than IBM. They also are more expensive than IBM. Amateurs keep posting as price isn't a factor. IBM's PEG ratio on Yahooo is 3.58 . Google's is 1.64 . MSFT is at 2.19 . I have a feeling most of the negative posters have no clue what that means."
"Big Blue is rising again. Bash, spam, nay-say - it cannot be stopped!"
"IBM cloud losing steam, meaning price wil settle in the $110-115 by year end"
"The IBM stock price movement over the past month is telling ! Recovering from the pandemic lows, IBM rose in tandem with all other IT sectors. However, in early June, something happened. While many other IT companies have surged ahead further with the likes of msft as IBM competitor in clouds or Nvda as IBM competitor in AI, IBM share prices reversed and collapsed."
Everyone should read this. https://www.cringely.com/2018/10/29/red-hat-takes-over-ibm/
in 45 days IBM has gone from 148 to 113. bod has failed the shareholders . vote them OUT. ..use your proxy !!!
This company has all it needs for success. It just needs the stock to tank around 60 for all the worthless managers to take a hike. Then it may start generating some value in 2-3 years time. Reinvent should have been about changing attitudes but it was all about changing suits.
"150??? Can we break 150 today??? Come on Honey, bust that nut!!!"
short @161 ... target $120
115USD/116 USD could be an entry if you're bullish 105 USD ~ 110 USD could be an entry with a bigger margin of safety.Next year the new server can be interesting.
did Warren sell???
A sign of desperation!
"""Last week, the market panicked over proposed increases to the capital gains tax rate. But that only made dividend stocks that much more valuable, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Tuesday night.Cramer reviewed his top 10 high-yielding dividend stocks which included IBM (IBM) , which is breaking itself up to spur growth. Let's pay a visit to the charts of Big Blue.We looked at IBM on April 20 and wrote that ""Aggressive traders could go long IBM at current levels risking to $131. The $156-$161 area is our price target for now."""
Shouldn’t have sold 150 covered calls.
"IBM is closer to the 52 low than to the 52 high , hope they do something about it , all tech is at the top"
"Seriouse question and not bashing IBM here, but expectations are quite hight, i really want to buy more b4 ER, but you guys think IBM can manage to Beat?"
30 MILLION SHARES WERE SOLD OFF TODAY.....IBM is a joke in the tech world.....MSFT went up as usual......the paltry dividend is not worth holding onto this stock.....The company allowed Ginny to run the company for 8 years without knowing a thing about tech......IBM should have been worth over 500 bucks by now if compared to the other major techs.....Red Hat won't save it once all the other divisions are sold off and income falls......The immense competition in the cloud is not going to give IBM a simple go to the head of the class either......
Explain folks............ WHY do RedHat shareholders get to VOTE on the merger (who are making out like bandits). While IBM shareholders don't get to VOTE to approve/disprove this?? This is absolute tyranny.
Will IBM even have enough to buy Redhat? The acquisition is 1/3 of their market cap now.
"The gap with their so called competitors is increasing, IBM's revenue is dropping, technology signings are dropping 20% YoY, barely 5% cloud growth, $70+ billion in debt, outdated offerings, clueless CEO, RHT won't even be able to compensate for the topline drop, without buybacks the EPS will erode fast. Sooner rather than later the floor will drop out from under this. As someone described it, a zombie, only surviving for now because their old legacy customers."
Soon everyone will realize that the great Ginny show is just all smoke and mirrors.
IBM looks poised to stay at 110-120 for the next 18 months.
"Discussion: Why not IBM try to take over TikTok instead of letting Microsoft doing so? IBM needs a good social platform to compete with likes such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and expand business, TikTok fits perfectly well !"
Acquisition of Red Hat was not a wise decision.
"IBM finally starting to move. Lets hope it continues. The stock market will take a MAJOR hit of democrats win the white house. Agree or disagree with me, thats OK. Look at the facts and speeches Biden and others are giving. Taxing people more who make over 400K is a lie and its been tried before only to end up with the middle class takes the hit. If Biden wins the white house, the economy will be a car on two wheels making a hard left turn... VERY BAD results! Im not pro trump, but I AM, ANTI sanders,cortez and Pelosi!"
stock just keeps spinning its wheel year after year!
Eps beats revenue fall .Sell.
Paper dividend arrived early! Yoohoo. Still waiting for the direct to brokerage to hit the account though. $1.63/share is respectable.
"Stock that should going higher is very profitable and still leader in tech with low valuation like $INTC, $CSCO, $IBM, $ORCL, $SAP.They aren't losing out. Sure they not capturing market way they should but they are still 800 pound gorilla."
"Triple bottoms pattern has occured and a break out signal at 132. I am very bullish on IBM . Fundamentally, the Trailing Twelve months Free Cash Flow has increased with an impressive number"
"RHT has a market cap of 30 billion dollars. IBM in reality only paid 9 billion for the company. rht has about 3 billion in cash and all assets will now belong to IBM including property,patents and cash. this is a winning deal. IBM is now the # 1 cloud company."
IMB stock is breaking out. There is no supply prior to $171.29 and also a little higher at $179.82Good news is expected for the 4Q - the sales of the X server will be huuuuuge!
did you hear the INTC in CNBC mentioned the IBM Modelthey copied IBM!
Careful here folks. This is setting up for a bad fall going into earnings. Only the DOW is keeping it afloat right now. Major layoffs still in the works for July.
"Amazingly hideous name for the spinoff! This combined with most likely another disappointing earning statement could cause IBM stock to gap down to near $120 all over again! JMHO, Tex"
When’s the split?
Glad to have loaded up during March April may and June ..
Fire Ginny and the stock will recover the $10 lost today
Any guesses as to how it opens tomorrow w/ this news and considering it's up almost 4.7% AH ?
"Ibm, a break out !! Shorts will self destruct"
"Interesting, that which is happening to tech stocks. Yes, they are up, but all companies use tech: Computer aided design, some robotic manufacturing, chips in cars TV's smart phones,..... checkouts and tracking inventory +++ at stores,..... This isn't history in reverse (reversing Industrial Revolution). Software for nearly everything. 5G, AI, Data Centers..... The vaccines for Covid came from computer researching and testing by humans......"
I am disgusted how the new breed of management in this company all they do is appraise each other. Hello private club any accountability or only the hard working worker bee is accountable ?
"Oh Jenny, jenny did a number on this company. My friend used to work their and the dirty little secret is all other nimble tech companies are taking their business. It is like a pack of hiennias attacking them from all angles."
"WOW.....really impressive. We got macromolecules, we got cloud, we got AI, we got Redhat.......we got everything. Market's answer .......so what, you have declining revenues."
I'm taking out my Kyndle to read mindless matter so I don't have to think about today's losses.
Ummm yup I told you so. IBM gives up $6 gain
Zacks changed his IBM rank for the third time this month.... xDI don't know if that's funny or sorrowful...?it's certainly more amateur than professional...
"IBM got the red hat bump on poor revenue and so so earnings...now its on the way back to 140. I was hopeful but after hearing Gin soaked Ginny talk the other day,,,im VERY concerned for the future if she doesn't step down."
"IBM is for Enterprise , Amazon is for consumer cloud. That is the differientator. Hardware and software alone will not solve enterprise challenges. IBM has the deep industrial expertise."
"IBM cant hold 140 for any length of time. Until either Ginny or the board or both are replaced, The stock will continue to languish. We should all hope there is no down turn economy wise, because IBM will feel the pain falling back to its 52 week low. Why didnt the shareholders get to vote on the Red hat merger?."
Tech companies up huge but I guess ibm not considered tech !!
aapl 1 day gain > IBM market capNobody will believe this 20 years ago.
"The only reason Warren Buffett ever bought IBM was that he wanted to be in some type of ""tech"" company and chose the oldest, most conventional one he could think of. International Business Machines, founded 1911. Seemed a good idea..."
This company falling is 100% on the shoulders of rometty she has not adapted ibm at all
why is Ginny still the CEO???
"once again - I say what the heck are all of you talking about??? not one mention that IBM is breaking into two completely separate companies here... They have already cut all of the staff in half with offer letters letting employees which company they will work for. LOTS OF STRESS and MORALE problems happening... staff is basically being aligned into a ""Shirt and Skins"" game of ""kill the guy with the ball"" ( the school yard game we used to call ""Smear the Que..."" -but that's inappropriate ) internally they are already writing TWO contracts for new customers, and clients are looking at all of this very dubiously to say the least. Peer and competetor companies are circling like sharks in the water just waiting to strike. Your IBM shares will be split and totally devalued as you will now hold shares of what amounts to being TWO COMPLETELY NEW COMPANIES... please read up. All of your other arguments below about leadership and history and ""to the moon"" and fundamentals - ARE COMPLETELY STUPID - This is a ""throw the baby out with the wash water"" moment for IBM... dividends will be split - a loss of dividend aristocrat status.... STOP ALL OTHER STUPID COMMENTS AND GET WITH THE CURRENT NEWS. We all need to to see and parse relevant comments here as we determine how to play this....- all this other noise is total garbage. I seriously cant believe that NONE OF YOU are talking about this.... I am muting anyone who doesn't mentions this issue as they are prolly 16 year olds with one share in a RobinHood account."
Pitiful performance for a once world class leader in tech. Sales go up BUT actual booked revenue is lower than its competitors. There is a massive negative pushing down the final profit. The overhead added to each deal to support all the accountants and do nothing middle managers. They add nothing to the product and just add cost. Not to mention the heavy debt laden on top that Gin bottle Rometty committed the company to. Yet the board plays pocket poll and does NOTHING. VOTE YOUR SHARES!!!
"Buy and hold? Sure...this has only been dead money for 20 years, what’s another 20."

"IBM Revenue Grows First Time in 23 Quarters . IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share, a penny ahead of the analyst consensus while revenue was $22.5 billion, better than Wall Street expectations of $22.0 billion."
"i'm an old time computer programmer.To me ibm has a good start in the cloud, a good place in AI and it has something most other companies miss, which is first in class mainframes.For the uninformed don't sell the importance of those machines short.These are machines on a scale of computation which dwarf your pc, even in a network.Here is the thing - do you really want all your personal information up in the cloud.there are advantages to having everything on an inhouse mainframe. They are far less vulnerable to attack then cloud based machines. And just as importantly far easier to program, because you don't have to go to the extremes of security needed on the cloud.hvSo it is far easier to achieve development, less costly.Now ibm is the #1 with these machines in development and that gives them a big edge in attracting new customers and it also gives them a great corporate base to transfer to cloud WHEN and WHERE it is appropriate.So i am good with IBM --- this is a market that is only growing and ibm certainly has a place in it."
Dr Lisa Su dispelled the rumour that she's leaving AMD for IBM.

"I think that value companies like IBM will win in 2018. Investors will appreciate steady company that is cheap to the broader market , with earning growth, paying dividend, buying back shares, low payout ratio, share holders friendly management, moat in the sector with great balance sheet and low debt. IBM is the top choice with breakthrough technology such as quatum computer and leading in blockchain. On the consumer side, I like GameStop with the same attributes that will take off with gaming industry, game characters collectibles, video games market is growing, Xbox and Nintedo game console sales increased 33 percent. Growing gamers and consumer spending will favor unique source for gaming buffs with staff knows the stuff. ."
"IBM is not a tech stock...It is a dinosaur, belongs in a museum."
same story - IBM is floundering - and fast talking dunderhead Rometty is still there and killing IBM - sad
I think 2019 is going to be a good year for $PEER Its not known to wall street. Would like to see the Backchannel and PSP tech bought out by a bigger company. $IBM $JPM $MSFT 
6 years after new CEO analysts are dissing the position. Valueline added to their div portfolio days later when Buffet got out. I bought on the Valueline buy but as we see a software picking program gets it wrong. Probably because of the faulty data. Target now $150 or below its trading price. 6 years...ceo should be replaced. msft had a great recovery after new ceo
Revenue Declining YOY
I believe that thanks to her IBM is still here today. Her work is done and now a new CEO will guide the co. through the next stage. Hopefully this new CEO will do even better; fingers crossed.
Got the limit sell order set for $130 again to pinch off more shares...I'm not going to watch another infamous IBM drop...
will blockchain technology revive IBM? IBM is very good at infrastructure software and could get a lot of contracts from companies wanting to develop a blockchain based app for their industry. thoughts? looking into msft too. ibm's float is under a billion too so maybe their buybacks plus pivot to blockchain will be a winning combination
"How about ""Global Business Infrastructure Technologies (GBIT)"" as the name for the IBM spinoff?Just my humble suggestion...........Tex"
"IBM market cap 105 b now.Zoom market cap 75 b and rising fastYes , by end of year IBM with 350000 employee AI , quantum , all the systems is going to be smaller than a company with a single video conference product.We are now sized sinilarly with Shop and Zoom. How does it feel ?"
"Selling pressure from Buffet is off, time to take off."
PUUULLLEASE break $150 soon. Been holding this thing for what seems like forever. Hope this rally is real.
"IBM earns $8.60 per share. That's fairly hefty, Boys."
Keep buying until Oct 19th. There is only one way this is going from now.... Up a few dollars every day. After earnings it will reach 150.
very frustrating stock performance. I know we all sound like broken records but when will the board make the changes needed? This lack luster performance is unacceptable. I have a ton of this stock and will hold it long but I expect better performance. One can only stay patient for so long....
This stock is two weeks away from an epic collapse. $34 Billion dollars for $4 Billion annual revenue. Hail Mary.
Thanks for the great dividend
One of the reasons the Z will have huge demandhttps://www.csoonline.com/article/3043030/security/12-top-cloud-security-threats-for-2018.html
"Rometty showed up for the breakup announcement...so she is still running the show after politicallycorrect management changes. IBM's survival is hanging on the declining relevance of mainframe related sales, and thoroughly pedestrian other technologies. With Rometty hanging on, I would not besurprised to see a $60 quote on the stock."
Desperate companies have to make desperate decisions and hope they pay-off.
"After some false starts, Big Blue is about to explode upward!"
Judgement day tomorrow
"Folks, after reading complaints on this wall for months (not naming anyone), I've decided to time to time update this with actual information. I'm also eager to see whether(WHEN) this will resurrect as the gains of other tech sectors outpaced this old moloch, still I don't really see much info which can give adequate insight.Starting with IBM recent named a leader for MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)https://reprints.forrester.com/#/assets/2/73/RES157492/reports"
"Great dividend, and now pltr as a catalyst to the analytics business growth. We can only go up from here."
Perfect fit for government contract
"Same ole pattern - market up, IBM down. This stock is a slow motion train wreck."
"What is being overlooked is IBM's research in quantum computing. When this technological advance emerges, IBM could be among the industry leaders. This will be the rebirth of many big tech firms. The stock is probably worth a shot for this alone."
"Rometty collects $8 Million in stock options every 6 months, of course, she will try her best to stay at the job.. Mutual funds bosses have to wake up....."
"Anybody playing for a Rometty-firing bounce? Remember, nobody saw the GE change coming. The Board just acted. I hope Dave Faber is watching carefully for any news on IBM Board unscheduled meetings or conference calls. How long can she possibly have left?"
3 hours to go!
"Free cash flow about $11 billion, debt about $66 billion. Effectively IBM could pay its entire debt within 6 quarters at that rate if it chose to do so. This is an incredibly friggin cheap cash flow machine, and that’s during a global pandemic. Meanwhile, cloud based revenue continues to grow very impressively. This is a gift! Bullish"
Wow...bashers are out today...Looks good
Picked up some calls 
Guys be careful here. IBM makes most of their money in Q4 - lots of sales people laid off in early January - that could mean a fail for closing the quarter. If I were a CIO I’d be spending money on WFM and moving it out of data center budgets. Services might do ok and of course 3 year or long term contracts will get counted. It’s way too risky to hold this through earnings. Buy on the other side if you like it long term and wait for signs of life in revenue growth. I hate to say it but even the dividend could be at risk in 2021. Way too many MBA VPs at this company doing busy work.
"For the quarter, IBM (ticker: IBM) reported revenue of $20.4 billion, down 6% (or 8% adjusted for currency and divested businesses) and below the Wall Street analyst consensus forecast of $20.6 billion. Non-GAAP profits were $2.07 a share, nicely ahead of the Street consensus view at $1.79 a share. On a GAAP basis, the company earned $1.41 a share, .......IBM is great/the best at ""non-GAAP"" accounting gimics.......even on a GAAP basis IBM's ""1.41"" is probably = 1.21 at best ....IBM's greatest asset is it's accountants"
"Too bad the BOD can't be sued for gross negligence...once technical competence/competitive positions are gone, it isvery hard to recover....IBM can no longer afford to pay market wages....this makes any recovery a long shot. And the disgrace of a CEO is totally entronched. A sad outcome for a once great company."
"Overreaction coming. $110; then churning for 5 years, or until new CEO is named."
"Same old story every day. Market up, IBM down."
Now that Buffet sold to buy apple and bank of america maybe he will stop selling to let this thing rise. All companies have competition especially Apple...but it is pretty odd to see a stock with $180-$200 price targets and a $4 per year dividend trade so low. Why did it jump to $162 after earnings and hold for a couple weeks if it didnt have something to hang it#$%$ on? Buffett has made mistakes before could he be buying high and selling low on IBM? Apple price targets are close to the same and trades $25 higher... some price targets are $125 - $150 for $AAPL...
Grow by acquisitions strategy and scale up the revenue & profit are gaining traction.
No serious supply of stock until it gets to the $182 level
"Let's see, I invest in real estate like Downtown Pensacola Florida and surrounding areas such as Sanders Beach which Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett recommend or I gamble on IBM? I think I'll buy real estate in Downtown Pensacola Florida"

"All hail the old geiser ,Warren buffet. He got out while we hold and wait for a spark. I'm beyond speechless at how wrong I am"
Do I hear 129?
"No one likes IBM.....Stephanie Link likes it, and so do I.....buy more on all dips....average cost right at 119 a share....collect 5% dividend and wait."
Now IBM gets 1 chance to make the RHAT integration go smoothly. If it doesn't the company is toast.
"Congrats longs. I still have major doubts about IBM's future, but replacing Ginni with a vagrant found under an overpass would have been an improvement."
"IBM is to TOP HEAVY with high paying management (FIRE THEM). IBM bought Red Hat for $34 billion and Red Hat Net GAAP Income is around $400 million per year. What a poor ROI and poor decision by the IBM Board of Directors, vote them out, they are obviously not confident to the job."
"IBM down almost 6 in after market. The currency market gave IBM a 3% boost earning wise, which made results look rosy, when in fact they were not. We will see tomorrow on how the stock does, but I firmly believe the stock wont go much higher while Koo Koo Ginny is ceo. Hold if you have it , if for nothing else the nice dividend."
"pulling back a little bit, still rated Outperform. hold"
What huge things are you referring to
IBM needs to broaden from there name no more business machines they need to look to satisfy the consumer the world is not so compartmentalized any more Adapt or die
At this pace the stock will be worth nothing in 2 months..Were is the rebound.
this stock just can't sustain a gain
How many got layoff notices effective in sept?
"IBM beats nicely on the bottom line, but misses by a rounding error on the top, and drops 10% lol? Thank you for the shares again!"
"Be patience and you will be rewarded, in the meann while paying a very good dividend, this is not your day trading stock, 6 months to a year will be back around $150."
ease remember that whatever ills forced this stock to be a dog all these years isn't going to disappear because there's a new President of the company. It's going to take hard work and imagination. Hopefully the ship hasn't sailed.
looking good

Big Blue is rising again. IBM is making a HUGE comeback!
"Same old story, so gets pumped 5 days before ER, then falls back to the same level after her.. ibm always fudges the eps tol beat earnings but unable to do that with revenues .Gini will give some cok & bull story about strategic imperatives etc or will make up some new cliche talking points to keep her going for a few more wtrs.. The board is totally complicit in the dysfunction of this co & had to her fired.."
I feel sorry for IBM and IBMers. It’s a great tech company but without leadership. And that leadership problem is deepening. Very worrisome
"Watch at the 47 second mark. I'm pretty sure this was recorded yesterday. She mentions the big announcement with Vodafone, but says that there is another big announcement with a French bank coming...... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-ceo-rometty-could-topple-185800876.html"
If yield increases what will happen to dividend stocks?
Virginia M. Rometty out IBM share up at least 20% for sure !!!!
133 Lets Ride !
IBM was valued at about $190 per share when Rometty became CEO. It has steadily dropped ever since. It's been 7 years. What is the board waiting for?
"Lol looks like my $ibm post on 3 directors buying disappeared lolSearch this:""IBM CEO Rometty buys $3 million in company stock""See the pattern? Rometty buying in 2018...wasn't good was it? Lol don't be fooled always do your own research !"

Is this POS company still in business. Another quarter of declining sales. Their cloud numbers are just shifting things around it's sales that counts.
I don't invest in IBM nor short it. My interest here is Power processor and IBM's cloud because I invest long in AMD. I've watched IBM's attempts with power and openpower JV in China from processors to cloud experiments. All failed to takeoff. As HP had to dump Itanium so IBM has to now. 4% YoY on Power9 is just from DOE supercomputer milestone but no white elephant can save power. A classic on disruptive innovation companies fail to move protecting their legacy products. AMD has become the Intel alternative in China and the world. A leadership that focus on finance in a tech rich corporate business will fail. See past Apple and Microsoft not to mention Kodak. IBM lost its way. The innovation first encapsulated by sales got replaced by hype and pr. Ginny Romety was obviously a bad choice and IBM still keeps her. Even Bill gates failed to see the internet and cloud. Satya has embraced innovation again movingvall in. Apple had to get jobs back. Intel needs a new CEO to change them. IBM is limping around crippled by its current leadership. I feel for you longs but yiu need seriously look outside as IBM will face major bubble bursting in my view soon.
The more Y posts the higher IBM rises... Buy at Will. Analyst upgrades and $180 are imminent
"I have a feeling when this reaches 200, Warren Buffet would say he had started accumilating IBM at around 140.."

I have IBM for years. Been under water for years. I keep it because of the dividend. Should I sell at a loss and buy Microsoft? Opinions and suggestions of other stocks are welcome.
"IBM is showing its moat regardless of market, it has long term contracts that keep the money rolling in."
Just post some good numbers and growth for couple quarters then $175 to $200 in early 2021
why is it dropping?
150 by end of the month
"IBM was a great company. Not the same as before. If Warren Buffett lost interest by selling all shares, this cannot be good investment."
Turnaround is here!
"Revenue dropped and the book value dropped by $30 billion, anyone know why?"
"As Cohen from Goldman Sachs would say, it is a tanker and it doesn't turn on a dime. But it looks like it has changed course and it will gain momentum. Soon it ill be touted as a major turnaround story and everyone will pile on and it will be difficult to get in. With the dividend which is is not in danger and earnings power, mark my words. IBM will resurrect and those that have waited to get in will be sorry."
After constantly missing qtr after qtr I actually expecting an IBM surprise with significant beat. IBM needs a significant catch-up trade.
"Thoughts on IBMI understand the frustration of IBM investors. The market has gone up and IBM is flat. It has taken a long time for the strategic imperatives to kick in. If you are long, like I have been, it is extremely frustrating. We watch Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and others soar on a daily basis. We are frustrated.The good news; IBM has 97% of the world's largest banks as clients, and 92% of every credit card transaction is processed on an IBM mainframe. Blockchain will be big and having those banks is clients should be a huge advantage.IBM also leads the world in annual patents for basically the last 20 years...............the concern is to how to monetize them properly although the Groupon lawsuit win was good.IBM is the clear leader in Quantum computing, although years away, and most of us can not even grasp what it means, it has some potential.So my net is, IBM has many things going on presently that are good, but my concern is that the management team does not effectively articulate the opportunity and thus the low multiple(also of course the slow revenue climb).Due to the incredible client base, the patent portfolio, the leader in Blockchain and Quantum computing, my dream would be for Apple to take out IBM and a mere 200M and let Apple management figure out how to turn IBM around."
steady rise into earnings continues
C'mon IBM! Let's see 120 this week!
More of the same.. IBM goes up and Apple goes down.. Oracle is past his prime
we need to break $125 lower level resistance level this week. Going forward to $130 plus. Slowly but surely with a nice dividend paying out monthly.
"Goodbye, awesome. Don't come back"
"My word exactly PLTR effect, new ceo as well, Ginni Bop out."
4.35% yield at this price with a stable revenue and growth is a pretty good thing. FAANG stocks are way over priced and I suspect with the MSFT news and the stable base of IBM cashflow tomorrow you will see another 3/4 $ upside.Gl!
"Alright people slow down the purchasing I need to get another entry point soon, in at $138.20 but didn’t expect my next tranche to be upon me so soon. Great dividend. Under new leadership. Getting into the right future markets. Retiring old outdated products. The future is bright for Big Blue."
"I still do have hope in IBM, and this may seem to be at odds with what I opinioned elsewhere, but that is not the case. As a long, I just hope that IBM makes the right decision and make IBM great again . But what it has to do, and it has to do so urgently is to realise that there is such a thing as becoming too small and becoming irrelevant. There js such a thing as Wang computers and Kodak. Msft once almost became irrelevant too. Same goes for Nokia. Msft had a change of CEO at 2012, so did Nokia. But look at what happened 8 years later.? Msft managed to steer itself cleared of Kodak fate., but not Nokia. The reason is when SN took over msft, there was a sense of urgency. So when msft says it is going all in for cloud, it really went all in. Now is IBM doing the same? Every single analyst already commented what js wrong here, we all know too. IBM shareholders has suffered long enough, even Warren Buffet left. If IBM do not quickily take bold decision, the industry will leave IBM behind. Look forget about Msft , aapl, and other trillion or multi trillion dollar companies, just imagine, even nvda, CRM are now several times bigger than than IBM. Even super tiny and forever struggling AMD which grew 50 times in 4 years , is now equal in size to IBM. Something has to be done quickly or IBM will stopped being mentioned at all. Remember there is such a thing as Kodak, yahoo, Nokia , wang ."
they are putting out fake news bf a huge move to the upside.....let the short squeeze begin
Plain and simple oversold but just holding. Dutch

i love to accumulate IBM cause it is gaining ground and targeting the right growth area. Marriot data leak is a classic example of security is a specialized area that IBM can excel with end to end solution. IBM should grow its digitize and consulting practices.where most competitors lack. IBM just need to focus on using its quantum computer to crack all types of 256 bit encryption in a sec.
IBM is a broken stock. It will go much lower than most can imagine as this bear is hungry.
She's gotta leave someday...so we got that going for us.
This is good for IBM..... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-canada-teams-igm-financial-130000286.html
"Learning from $ibm trouble in cloud and datacenters vs Amazon and Microsoft Azure because of not being efficient, high prices and complexity. This applies to $intc and $nvda exactly. IBM faces closure of cloud datacenters. Intel and nVidia will see revenues and market share declines, reduced prices leading to lower margins etc. ""He added: ""The situation is serious in terms of IBM's position in the market, our overhead, complexity and cost that many or most of our competitors do not carry. This is negatively impacting our ability to compete successfully in the market.""https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/18/ibm_puts_nearly_1300_frontline_techies_at_risk_of_redundo_warns_of_data_centre_closures/"
"I absolutely like the upcoming motto of IBM. Cloud , AI, quantum is no longer about the health of your organization. It is about your survival. 100 % true. You just simple need the best and smartest minds , natural and artificial , not just combined but integrated , to help you find whatever few paths you have left , to live !"
Not bad AH action...should mean 140 tommorow with volume exceeding average. Solid divvy supporting.
Intc and $ibm should merge. They belong together. Maybe that will give their stocks a mirage spike for a day since it seems financial engineering is the only thing they are good at.
"Same old garbage with this company. Palmisano, Rometty and now Krishna. All losers including the clueless BOD. As a retiree with 30 plus years of service, I shake my head in disgust what has happened to this once great company. With the current management I fear there is no hope for IBM. I can only hope it gets bought out by some other organization like an Apple, Microsoft, etc. Then maybe we'll see some results."
this will hit 220 in late may or before
"Technically this stock is on the brink of going much higher, or much lower...The fact it's trending higher on this down day is a great sign that we'll trend to 160 by years end...Of course, that could change tomorrow."
"Thu Jul 25 2019 1345 - BUY @150.30This is especially for those with large accouts, but of course anyone can get something out of it, large price not withstanding. I've been reading and hearing a lot of negative sentiment about this stock based on the past 3 years of subpar returns. I think the earnings report may be a confirmation that the RHAT acquisition is making a material difference. IBM got was into cloud a long time ago. Same applies to AI, Watson is so old that it he can't sleep with Alexa or Cortana without going to jail. It can't be that hard to put some extra effort and turn this company around the way management did with MSFT. The RHAT combo may do for this company what Jet.com did for Walmart. BUY, go long for a long time. Big Blue skies for everyone."
IBM will never get to what it can - all due to a bad corporate culture. Buffett made a huge mistake with this one.
I jumped on IBM at $161. I have been waiting for it to get back near that amount and I would sell. That's not going to happen. Now I have to make a decision to take the greater loss or to sit a little while longer. It's a difficult decision since I don't see any reason for this stock to increase in value. The leadership does not appear to have the support of many on this board. Hope does not help the bottom line. See you.
"Warren knew what he was doing when he bailed out of IBM stock a while ago. Warren said ""enough is enough""."
"Until IBM streamlines the management structure and flattens the do nothing layers, which are many, they will continue to struggle with VERY high overhead and costs that get passed along in contracts That IBM will lose due to the competition. Years ago, when IBm was gettin ginto services big, there were 2 levels of management between the tech teams and the VP running the business unit. Many of these middle managers dont deserve their positions and move from job to job just before the are found out to be poor performers who protect their friends and attack those they deem a threat. Until these lip lock'rs are gone, and tech talent hired that can produce product..IBM is dead money. Its been dead money for years."
Ginni gone! Horray
Yahoo new format sucks!
After hours show big changes in positions...
Take the money and run! Clearly IBM management don't know what they're doing!
The Band plays on.
why own this stock at this point?
So ibm is in a break even for 5 years. Valueline said buy as Buffett said SELL. Why so different
"Wow! 66 Billion in debt, is that correct?"
"Its hard for me to take bearish statements. A patient investor will do well with IBM. Andif things work out well, you won't have to be too patient."
"During its successful years, IBM was a hardware company with a great reputation and a first rate sales force. Its fall from the ranks of top tier, like many other companies in this type situation (see Xerox), was and is there managements inability to understand the market and understand where it was going before it got there and is now trying to recover with an uncertain future."
Come on back
"IBM earnings decline, it's never rebound, it's worth $100 per share,"
Microsoft might buy IBM for $250 a share and have control of the cloud.
Question: How does redhat propel IBM into the Cloud space? IMO the acquisition will only tangentially pull IBM to the cloud...am i wrong????
IBM is solid value play with a great history of dividends and future growth ahead. Hold and continue to accumulate on any market dips.
"IBM should be UP and NOT down. Finally turned the corner, future is bright and investments made in right places where there is tremendous GROWTH: Cloud, AI, Blockchain and tax cuts saving America $$$ which results in more mainframes. Upgrade to $ 200 stock."
Does anyone at IBM have any new ideas that could help grow the company? It seems not.....just one idea would be nice.
Market not happy with proposed split. Who would want to own NewCo? The agony continues for IBM stockholders. Seven years and counting! And now who knows what will happen to the dividend which is the only thing keeping many investors holding on?
"From the silicon valley biz journal "" International Business Machines Corp. was similarly eliminated from the govt cloud contract , while Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. advanced"" Microsoft is developing AI with the Chinese military, yet they beat IBM? WOW! Why would the govt hire a firm developing AI with the Chinese Military. Who is running govt procurement on this...Jimmy wong?"
"My Christmas list, Ginny retires, they make James Whitehurst, the RedHat Ceo the new CEO and they break up the company and get rid of the existing Board and replace them all. Gosh, you have companies trading at 200 with 1/10th of the free cash flow of IBM."
"The last few posts from levin, Simon, Manniel and Mario I believe to be all the same person. They want everyone to know we are in a bubble."
"IBM is secretly growing without you notice. It has acquired excellent companies Instana, Nordcloud and 7summit. Each will add to the growing power of its line up in the true Enterprise grade cloud support. Pratik Gupta is good great."
"Not sure why IBM is touting this new Australia government deal. If they want to make something like $50 Billion from their strategic imperatives or whatever they are called now, they need a deal like this every week. The fact IBM only announced this one is a very worrying sign. My guess, they are very worried about the new 52 week lows and the upcoming Q2 results and because of that are trying to pump whatever they have before earning release."
"I don't really get the optimism here. They posted more or less flat for the year. A year in which HW, driven by the mainframe cycle especially in first half posted significant growth yoy. So to be flat the rest much have declined equally. Q4 is a better prediction for the future, declining 3% yoy, their ( non-existent) growth in their strategic stuff and services is not enough to compensate for the drop in HW revenues. But one has to admit, they dressed the pig well."
I bought in today. Buying Opportunity.
"Same old IBM. If you can't beat 'em, buy 'em. IBM does not create anything anymore. It simply acquires and cannibalizes the acquisition's assets. I know because I was an employee of an acquired company that was ""bluewashed"" into oblivion. Quite sad. We went from a thriving corporate complex of 5 buildings to a sparsely occupied single building euphemistically called an ""innovation center."" It was more depressing that the home and garden department of a Sears Department store on the brink of closure."
"IBM, I'm afraid it's an end of a era, the company is static caught in limbo not going anywhere and the bears are going to have a field day.. This is going below $100 by end of 2018. Needs swift change or acquire something.. Do something, AWS, CISCO, MSFT, ORACLE are so far ahead its not even funny. Need a new board of management clean sweep and even with that it's too little too late. Who in their right mind would buy IBM if not to break it up. Smacks of GE."
IBM is up 22.5% YTD and pays a dividend of 4.6%. That is not too shabby.
"I'm mystified........ Maybe you smart people out there can answer this question.How come after 7 miserable lackluster years, Ginny hasn't been fired?"
"With this split the IBM name will loose it's value. Many IT decision makers today are still impressed by the IBM name. That will be gone with the split and will cost them billions in sales. And who will buy from them in the year to come, knowing that contracts will have to be split between the entities and so on. This is going to be a massive mess."
Looks like some changes will be coming. IBM is just caught in a world that's changing too fast. ACN also chipped away at its IT professional services.

Income is drying. These guys can only buy companys to fix big problems. Google and others will beat am up. I expect divvy reduction. Ouch.
"long Ibm, looks really good here"
"I would think law firms, media outlets, and political parties would make good use of the debate AI platform. Start marketing that! I see a lot of potential with their block chain software. Love the dividend! IBM is a bargain here."
"Hi Ginny, how about approach the Trump Family & cutting a deal to get some Defense contracts? Perhaps starting with the contract from which Google walked away."

Why does Rometty still have her job? VOTE OUT the BOD! They have NOT done their fiduciary duty to the shareholders!
I added 250 more from today's bottom so I ended up 149.5 average cost.
looks like blockchain is getting some momentum again. very unusual ibm is green and all others are red
"LOL. IBM can't go up two days in a row. I sold 1/4 of my position at 192. Another 1/4 at 153, then another at about 140. Still mad at myself for not dumping all of it about 4 years ago. Terrible company. And to think I was an IBM computer salesman for 7 years (ending in 1981)!!"
"$135 by lunch, $139 at market open tomorrow"
"Remember Apple, Microsoft etc they had some bad quarterly earnings and they turned things around, these things don't happen over night, once the split of companies occurs then they can focus on the cloud and the Newco will focus on infrastructure."
"The board needs to fire Ginny and it needs to be done now. She has led the company for 7 years and had produced nothing but loses. Unfortunately David Kinney, who was CEO of the Weather Comapny when IBM bought them would have been a good choice but alas he left when he knew GInny was never going to leave."
I have owned IBM forever! They have now put Gary Cohn from Goldman Sachs in as Vice Chairman! The very Gary who says he will make a donation to charity rather than give back the clawback for corrupt activities while at Goldman. He is obviously not worried about Goldman stockholders and I am sure he is not worried about IBM stockholders either. Time to dump IBM!
"ibm is a machine, dont mess with the machine, 200 by February of next year"
This company seemingly wants to be a loser. It's obvious due to the fact that the board is letting a 60 year old (who isn't the founder) run what's essentially a tech company. Why on earth is someone's grandmother running a $100+ billion tech company?
need a new ceo
The Ceo said that both companies would be able to raise their dividends. Since IBM will be growing faster my take is their dividend will have bigger increases going forward.
"Traders have a simple way to make money in IBM...buy at the close of market, and sell it into the afternoon after a morning run up. It's been following same pattern now for months. Whenever you think IBM has some some positive momentum...POOF, it's sold off."
"rapidly approaching a new 52-week low. Continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results is...well, you know.."
"MarketBeat stats...average PT $164.47 (33.5% upside), PE 8.92, Beta 1.18."
This stock will go back to $140 in 2 months!
$IBM did the same strategic partnership with $BOX a few years ago. Nice pop ultimately followed by a $4B acquisition (but that was just a dream).
Who shorted this yesterday.
"Sadly, I just continue to watch my IBM shares go down, down, down!"
ibm is still on my watch list
IBM shows sign of life
Time to get a CEO that actually earns that BIG pay and thinks of shareholders value!
"IBM did'nt buy Red Hat for the fun of it. Red Hat is highly active and profitable. This combination is a sure winner. Watch it take off in the next quarter. Even now, it moves up sure and steady."
I'm a little worried about the dividend. The payout ratio is 98%. a lot of cash Is going towards that dividend. This company also has pension obligations and other expenses as well. The PEG ratio is over 11. They say never invest in a stock that's trading over 2 times the growth rate. very expensive compared to other companies in the same industry. imho
Aravind and Satya are going to make beautiful Indian music together!
"Great earning and it dropping. I guess only momentum stock, when they beat earning go up. Solid company like IBM where 50% of business growing 20% rate. Remaining only going slowly down but increasingly become less impactful, Investor still don't think it's good investment.Can't believe current market mentality. Well I am keep getting good dividend that material more than anything else. Eventually this turn out winner."
Parler is looking for a cloud hosting company. IBM account manager should have called Parler two weeks ago.
Reminds me of when western digital bought San disk for nearly $20B back in 2015 and now WDC has a market cap of less than $15B
How is she still CEO?
Is today still able for dividend?
Ginny Ruined this company with her massive mistakes and political correct attitude. Get someone who can get this company moving again. Its been stuck in the Rometty ditch for YEARS! Like Carly and Meg ruined HP and Yahoo... Another loser like Ginny has taken IBM from 200 to 113. Time to revamp the board and middle management.
"ibm is silently gaining traction,,, 200 march-may,, 225 sept,, 235 next dec,, I guessing up 50% in the 2018 year ,, without much trouble,, in the world of crypto that may not seem like a lot, but it is less risky, and dam near a sure bet,, up 50% and more in 2018"
Thanks for the shares below $120. Now puffing up because of the hybrid cloud is now showing its advantage in a Solarwinds world.
Losing a third of its value so far. Ginney knew these numbers were coming out she ran a failure. Women being promoted for political convenience. The India CEO pushed IBM to the Cloud 15 years too late. Ballmer at Microsoft another CEO failure but only 10 years late to the Cloud
I don't understand why lots of people use IBM as an example of a company that disappeared when it's worth over a $100 Billion.
"IBM turnaround plan: Dissolve ceremonial BOD, Dismiss current CEO hand picked by Previous CEO( Responsible for IBM falling behind competition in Cloud computing domain, Hire a new CEO with proven skill in turning around an underperforming tech company, stop Spin off of IBM services. Downsize IBM."
"IBM earnings beat: $3.08 per share, vs. $3.04 expected EPS."
Careful folks ... revenue declined if you take out the one time US dollar currency gains. Not as pretty under the covers - and the analysts will be asking tough questions - like which legacy software products go with which division. Also status of Watson Health sake etc...
Warren Buffett is all for stock buybacks. Reduces share count and raises eps. Warren was not even against a buyback at ko when trading at 40 times earnings. IBM imo can still grow their business and buyback stock.
"Delta airlines taps IBM for cloud expertise, BP tie up with IBM quantum network.. These are new business deals.. And we'll see more of such headline. Keep on eye"
IBM got no emerging high profit technology apart from RED HAT. This means slow growth but IBM got high dividends. Invest here for dividends only ? Am I missing something ??
"IBM filed the most patents last year, almost led every year. They are making changes, I think it will take time"
What’s today’s bad news
"Its another smoke & mirrors show, IBM has always done this and is probably the best at it,, ""Financial Engineering"".. Thats the reason they always report Non Gaap earnings.."
"Thank you Democrats for raising gas prices 50 cents at the pump. More taxes, higher commodity prices = green new deal screw job"
"layoffs on the horizon.. IBM's favourite strategy before earnings release ,,"
The cheapest blockchain leader except Qiwi
Red Hat going to morph us into a $200 stock. Buy.
what is IBM doing in the Cloud market? Are they letting everyone else get this business?
Rise of the machine
This ship is turning around. You just gotta be patient and collect a nice dividend while you wait. Doomsayers are ever present with any stock.
GR doesn’t deserve to be CEO.. time to change management..
Today’s Call Option activity from 125 to 140 for this Friday’s expiration seemed to predict the AWESOME results today after the close
"I cant remember the last time IBM announced a 'major' contract win ($1B or more) that they have won, or any major technologyadvance that puts them on the map again. What happened to this once-great company that they cannot stand out anymore?I suspect they have stripped away so much talent that they have demoralized their staff into complacency.."
"Spammers, nay-sayers, bashers get the finger while Big Blue rises from the ashes."
changing CFO a week before numbers not a good sign
Wow! After hours!!!
Don’t worry everyone I’m using all of my strength to hold this up 
"Same $%$#, different year."
Holding well considering all the BLOOD non the street.
"Good that cacklehead Rometty is gone, however they got the wrong guy to be CEO. Catching up with AWS, MSFT and GCP will be very very difficult. Remember this guy was leading their cloud, under his leadership IBM couldn't even keep up, and now that he's CEO he will turn it around. Not going to happen in my opinion."
I’m hoping for $156.00 tomorrow.
"As investors, we need to determine in our minds when the transformation will come. It’s been 8 years of revenue declines. Maybe the bigger picture is as long as IBM delivers those growing dividends each year, wealthy investors don’t care about anything else...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-cut-1-700-jobs-175636934.html"
"Well, Rometty was voted the worst CEO in the S&P 500 for 2017...even ahead of GE's CEO. Her stellarperformance continued in 2018, with a real likelyhood of bankruptcy for IBM in a few years due to the huge assumed dept for Red Hat...with little expected on the bottom line. For sure the BOD will give hera huge bonus.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-worst-ceos-america-2017-223551305.html"
Wish I still had my paper IBM certificates - I just ran out of toilet paper.
The CEO reminds me of Marissa Mayer and few others. I wouldn’t buy this stock personally. It looks like a great deal but...
It will trade 130-135 until next report-new funds will buy in time.
"ARMONK, N.Y., March 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a series of new and updated capabilities for developers designed to deliver intelligent application analysis throughout the DevOps pipeline, generally available on March 19.According to an IBM internal assessment, a bank with $1B in IT spend undergoing a hybrid transformation with integrating mainframe reported 2.5x the value of a single vendor cloud approach1. However, to fully realize that potential value with low risk and high ROI, clients will need DevOps tools that can assist them to help understand application complexity – a key step when planning their cloud transformation journey.To help clients unlock the value of DevOps across the enterprise, and help reduce risk around application modernization, today IBM is announcing new IBM Wazi Analyze capabilities to help bring IBM Z into the DevOps pipeline, unlocking uniform, enterprise-wide agile delivery processes and standards with transferable skills for non-Z developers.These new capabilities are included in:IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI) for IBM Z V6which allows developers to accelerate application development and modernization by enabling them to efficiently gain granular insight into their business-critical application estate. With the new version of Wazi Analyze, you can get updated analysis immediately after the code change is made. ADDI v6 has been engineered to improve the Assembler support by helping developers analyze the multi-level of dynamic assembler macro calls. A set of APIs are also made available to enable integration between the analysis and CI/CD pipeline.New Analyze capability in IBM Wazi Developer V1.2, a subset of ADDI, helps enable developers to discover and analyze the relationships between components of their z/OS applications and understand the impact of a potential change. Wazi Analyze runs in a containerized environment to give developers the flexibility to run it in any environment.In addition, IBM is also announcing we have completed a licensing agreement with ITP Software Systeme GmbH, Munich (ITP) to enhance DevOps for IBM Z Hybrid Cloud capabilities. This includes IBM's offerings IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI) for IBM Z V6 and IBM Wazi Developer V1.2 and is expected to provide a strong foundation for our clients' application modernization and cloud transformation initiatives, accelerating their journey to hybrid cloud. By working with ITP, IBM will introduce advanced application analysis on IBM Z and Red Hat OpenShift, as well as be able to provide on-demand project level analysis as part of a modern DevOps pipeline when and where developers need it.""We look forward to using the new IBM Wazi Analyze web user interface as part of IBM Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence, said Armin Kramer, Software Engineer at DATEV eG. ""With these new capabilities, our developers will gain deeper access to z/OS application analysis - a critical component to enhance productivity when maintaining and developing code in a hybrid cloud environment."" interesting by Bim more interested in how a d when this turn into revenue.

"IBM is a double, triple and at least a quadruple from these levels. We finally have a CEO that lives and breathes tech and will invest in R&D instead of foolish stock buybacks. Arvind Krishna, now CEO, led IBM's strategic purchase of Red Hat, and Jim Whitehurst, former Red Hat CEO is now the President (second in charge) of IBM. Trust me, this is not your IBM of the past 30 years. This is a transformed IBM, with technology and innovation at the forefront."
back to 150.00 soon.buy now
Well it will be interesting to see whether this bump up will fade over the next week like the earnings bump faded.
IBM is the leader in blockchain tech. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are the future powerhouse in technologies
Insiders keep buying cause they know what are coming - i guess big deals.
"Fishy story with the RHT CFO, there's obviously more to it than that they are willing to say. Maybe they were blaming him for having overvalued the RHT business. It wouldn't surprise me they have come to the conclusion that RHT is nowhere near worth the $34b IBM paid for it."
BLOK - New blockchain ETF. IBM listed in holdings.
"IBM decision to raise its quarterly dividend from $1.62/share to $1.63/share this year could be symbolic of its increased Free Cash Flow even during COVID. With this tiny boost, the tech giant joined the list of dividend aristocrats, S&P 500 companies that have increased cash dividends to shareholders for 25 straight years."
"IBM is at turning point, it will bottom today or tomorrow."
"This is how a real stock should be. TSLA, APPL are all good if you got in a couple years ago. IBM is just a great comfy stock. I think the new CEO is adjusting and doing great, especially for getting on right during Covid. Give him a year and things will all shake out and you will see IBM flourish again. I personally am a huge IBM fan. IBM isn’t gambling like many of the other stocks who have cult followings. It’s a true long term investment in a great company who happens to pay us a great dividend."
"1Q2020 Revenue of $17.6 billion, down 3.4 percent (up 0.1 percent adjusting for divested businesses andcurrency). In the Investor call they stated NO share buybacks for now but the dividend will continue. As an investor I have to face the reality that IBM is managing to a downward revenue cycle."
So there is a GOD after all !! Thank You Lord 
"congrats to the longs. I hope ibm turns around for you this coming year, they are off to a good start"
"If the board wont act...you must when voting, vote OUT the BOD! 20+ consecutive quarters of losses tells the story and cant be propped up with financial engineering. You KNOW Rommetty got a golden parachute deal from her friends on the board!"
What is the impact on AMD's PPS if a big AI collaboration is revealed? IBM provides its corporate IT connections and services including new EPYC Rome cloud datacenters and specialized Power processors. AMD provides GPUs to IBM Power processors and future EPYC Milan and 7nm+ Arcturus. Is it going for $100? You don't think so? Read my posts below. Of course AMD is the best investment even for current $ibm shares holders.
"Can someone check the numbers? It seems that at the present rate of profit, it will take about 30 years to pay back the price they paid for Red Hat."
this stock is the same price as sept 2000 so you made no money since then look at the chart has been company
Still underpriced
VOTE your shares and oust the board. They do NOT do their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders
"Hope I won’t bashed on this one, consider this a gift from one investor to the community hoping karma will end up doing the same to me: I was thinking to buy IBM recently (disclaimer- I belong to a generation in which ibm employees were considered sons of gods and people were standing in lines to work for it, that was before Apple, Facebook, google and even Microsoft, there were only ibm, Motorola and hp) and I called some friends who work for ibm and ask for their opinion- they all, no exception, said they would not recommend it. They say the company is selling its technical and sales employees to third parties like delloute , raise was 1% at most, the good people are leaving and the moral is quite low. The company is mostly worked in offices in India and not United States. Most of them blamed the CEO and wish she’ll resign. I have no position on ibm. Good luck!"
"why IBM has a good earning, yet stock is not up?"
"great, finally!!!"
Warren Buffet buying Redhat is basically getting back in to IBM.
Rocketing fire post earnings
"Did they finally get rid of Gin Soaked Ginny? if IBM cuts the dividend, the stock will be below 100 in no time. I dont think they will but its a possibility. The country needs to get back on its feet and with a new CEO, IBM should move up quick."
"all the growth is in the cloud area. the other side of the business, which will be a separate company, is shrinking right along with the mainframe usage at companies. i am sure the consulting arm will survive, they will no longer be restricted to ibm hardware/software to consult on. so i see the logic. however, it is hard to be excited about owning shares in a consulting company."
"On CNBC's ""Closing Bell,"" Stephanie Link said she's not worried about declining software revenue in IBM (NYSE: IBM) because she thinks a lot of bad news is already priced in. She says the company is very early in its transition from legacy business and toward faster-growing segments like cloud, AI, blockchain and data analytics.The company has a new CEO, who is an expert in the faster-growing segments. In October, IBM announced a spin-off of the managed infrastructure services division. This will result in a much simpler and faster-growing company. Over time, Link expects IBM to become a higher-multiple stock.Link believes investors have to give the management time. She was very encouraged by the gross margin expansion and $11 to $12 billion of free cash flow that management announced. Link thinks 11 times earnings with a 5.70% yield is very attractive."
Rometty is still in charge...looks like IBM has finally started its circling of the drain.Might get a buyout at $40 a share.
I am loving today. Thank God the elections are over. Maybe we can get back to life as usual. 
Wow what a terrible stock. Everyone should be fired on the board and the ceo. Terribly mismanaged company..
IBM being recognized as the go-to quantum computing company? Huge upside if so. Buy.
IBM is just warming up...
"Thank you again to those that sold me shares under $120. I said then and I'll say it now, IBM will soar like BA did from $100 to $300 a few years back. They are now aligned and in sync with where technology is going, quantum computing, 2 nm, Linux, etc."
"If you value your investments reading the posts on this board is not the way to research your stock. All the posts by armatures and short sellers are so inaccurate its not even funny. Go to trusted sources like {Michael Saylor}Google him or Kathy Wood. I'm long COIN and sleep very well at night. Profits should start reflecting on this stock when the next quarter reports, big time jump coming. Coin base will profit whether the market goes up or down, great inflation hedge. COIN isn't over priced like everything else in the market these days. I'm also long $GME, $TSLA, $LUV, $BA, $AAPL, $IBM, $AMZN, $GOOG but cautious on these stocks. Just may take."
"Red Hat people will be signing up more and more deals, same way they grew Red Hat, easy price to make $$money with the stock, we'll see $175 quickly"
Ginny is a progressive woman......................................
"wait,,,it could happen by year end IBM might see 135"
"today, Increasing my holdings on AMD and IBM."
Guess yesterday's nose bleed rise of 73 cents was too much for this flee bitten dog.
So many news on IBM partnering with so many... you would expect by now some serious traction to result in substantial higher revenues not trading water and hovering around 0 growth constant currency or not...
"NEW CEO IS NEEDED. ROMETTY PROMISES ARE OVER. SHE HAS BEEN PROMISING 7 YEARS, 7 LONG YEARS.HER ARROGANCE IS KEEPING IBM TO PROGRESS."
thanks kramer. i have to go find a job at 62.
$155 target looks pretty weak from here. MSFT WAS 10 years late to the Cloud IBM 15 20 years
When $MSFT got rid of nut job Ballmer and his Nokia debacle the stock soared and continues to this day. Hope IBM will follow $MSFT's path to success.
we should have a better day tomorrow with the EC.
"AITX With Minimum wage incrising to $15/hour and talks of the corporate tax being raised, companies like robotic assistance devices might be an overnight trend on walstreet"

OK. Back to my purchase price now. Looking for $140 before the month end!!
I just listened to IBM's CFO... Maybe he should join GR on the way out.
Waiting for sub-100.
"this is so sad. really thought this last move up was the one that would create new trading level, but nope, this dog comes tumbling back down for apparently no reason"
"IBm stock sinking ? no worries as per IBM ads on TV we can at least be safe with the IBM blockchain technology...Can you imagine what a disaster it would be if we did not know where are tomatoes and coffee beans come from.. Thanks u Watson, U have saved the day..."
Upgrades galore this morning. We're going a lot higher. Buy.
"tahts it,,no run for Dividends,, means i will hold for the small dividend,, thought we would have run,,but looking at last 3 months,,its the same spot ,, no gains"
Looks like the dog days of IBM PPS is over
Good on IBM for partnering with Palantir.
"IBM is the MSFT 3 years ago starting the joueney on cloud, but at 1/3 of atoxk price with much bigger and larger enterprise contracts. Gold nugget starting to be hatched"
rsi is over 70 - expect at least a short term pull back in near future - as part of retrenchment before moving on
5.5% yield ! Im in!
Warren Buffet today said on CNBC he is now totally divested of his IBM Stock. Berkshire held over 10% of the stock last year and his withdrawal is the ultimate vote of disapproval of IBM direction this CEO and board has taken IBM. Board and CEO needs to go NOW.
"I have bought into IBM in extended trading hours. My price is $135.35. I don't see today's reported earnings to be as bad as the market seems to think, so for now they are right and I am wrong. Time will tell."
Anyone notice a significant increase in the absurd pumper posts recently?
another revenue miss....bod do your job and replaceel rommety. down 7 after hours
"I’ve own this stock since the 60’s, I should be a multi-millionaire by now. If this were Apple, Google, or Microsoft I would be, but unfortunately IBM employees think like old school dinosaurs that can’t think out of the box. The CEO needs to go! I miss you Gertsner and Palmisano."
"When Ginny finally resigns and if there is anything left to work with, then and only then will IBM return to investment grade."
"IBM still good buy with RHT coming on board soon, also $6.28 annual div still provides almost 4.5% rtn on $140 stk price with future stk appreciation as a bonus. Cashflow stills supports div payments. IBM still a good holding for me."
She's gone!
And a 5.26% dividend nice
FINALLY!
Think they will cut the dividend?
IBM is displaying all indication of continued upside movement! Get onboard $$$.jg
The BOD members should be reminded of the difference a ceo with vision can make. For example AMD!!
"Remember longs... the moment $ibm explain the amd's partnership not just for vanilla cloud but AI Machine learning chips made by amd tied into EPYC and GPUs and ibm using them for smart business insights and actions, then you'll see both companies run! Ibm needs amd because its power processors isn't a wide platform for many things like x86 and Z is a niche."
baffled by IBM each time ...
Great earnings. Great dividend. Nice!
Drop drop baby.
Astradia is partnership with GOOGL cloud and IBM mainframes.
"Let us know when the CEO, President or chairman decide to retire or even better asked to step down"
The existing shareholders have to become the activists. Write to the investor relations and demand a major change. Ms. Rometty and BOD have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders. This is what we have to insist on. I WROTE A LETTER TO INVESTOR RELATIONS TODAY. DO THE SAME. WE HAVE TO BOMBARD THEM WITH OUR LETTERS.
"Management should completely turn-off the ""Dividend Bilge Pump"" in this old boathttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4381243-ibms-dividend-is-sinking-ship"
The new CEO is completely different from the earlier IBM CEO's.
i am waiting for the split - then i will look at the cloud/red hat side of the business. not interested in the other part.
ibm is a screeming buy but i think there may be one or two more down days for the whole mkt
By not replacing this CEO after over 6 years of falling revenue they are not doing their fiduciary duty to the shareholders.
great day for IBM but I think I'm even more excited about the Esports announcement
Contract scheduled for award in September. The just released final RFP
"I have owned IBM stock for a long time and at a lot higher price and I am very concerned. Ginny has to go & I looked up who the largest shareholders are and they are Vanguard, Blackrock, StateStreet. I called McNabb at Vanguard as I have an account there and he did not reply. Guess, his philosophy is the same as Bogle: BUY & HOLD, but that does not work today. Also, Ginny made a comment on Mad Money with JC that shareholders can choose to buy & sell what they want. This just shows me she is out of touch. You should make the company something people want & have to have & say your going to make IBM the world's best. I think IBM needs a big shake up with somebody who cares & knows tech. The potential is unreal in health care, the cloud. If we could just use the cloud to store all the police monitoring & arrest. Healthcare is wide open for improvement. I mean we would not need Infection Control Dept. if we could monitor what infections each hospital habors & save on drug cost. I am frustrated!!!! Somebody somewhere has to help before they go under. I believe IBM may go broke! HELP this American Company. PLEASE!!!"
I bought IBM 5 years ago and haven’t made any gains holding it for 5 years. Sold my entire position this morning and bought ARKK.
Replace the CEO if you want to see new results.
"Hey awesome, 125 today. Now you could sell and move it to something else. Hopefully we don't have to hear your complaining anymore"
"IBM moves again in a very predictable pattern, sold half my position on the big pop on the news yesterday and will buy it back when it retraces to 125 in a couple of days"
Two very important quarter end numbers I think I heard were a $10B reduction in debt and $9B cash on hand. Cash flow was apparently excellent. (But top line growth continues to be less than great).
"STATE STREET CORP NOW HOLDS $7.43 BILLION WORTH OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM)one door closes (WB) another one (SSBC) opens, link to follow"
Do not forget IBM had a great earning. Warren Buffett was simply taking off some profit off the table. What Buffett's hedge fund company did was already factored into the stock price last Quarter even before the earning release. This is an after-the-fact event. The stock should pick up from this level. Strong Buy!
"@Pipay: Could this be the foundation on which a split can ultimately take place under Whitehouse leadership and management control? Could result in some dismantling of some of the bureaucracy? I like this move. it's necessary, but wish it wouldn't take a year to close. Thoughts?"
Even if IBM goes to $1 a share I will buy and hold. Huge things for this company will be unveiled very soon.
Groupon paying IBM shows IBM's massive patents and moat yet to be unleashed

All the negativism is in. Time to get in!
IBM starts to outperforming DOW
IBM is really cheap compared with other techs and current market indexes as Pete and Stephanie mentioned on CNBC. Upside should be safe and huge!
"kramer said to buy, buy, buy!"
"Msft up, ibm down! Again"
IBM Lost the JEDI contract for two reasons. 1. Cost. I was told IBM had a lot of overhead in their bid to cover all the managers salaries and the baggage they bring without adding value. 2. Security clearances would be difficult to obtain when the support staff is in eastern Europe and south America. I expect there were more reason why as well.
"IBM paid way too much for RHT. I don't know how they came up with $34 billion price. RHT book value per share is $7.33. Shares outstanding is 176 million, so 176M X 7.33 = about $1.3 billion. Therefore, to me, the fair price should have been around $2 billion. Can someone convince me that I'm wrong?"
"Overall market up 166 pts..Ibm stock down 2.5 points while its competitors are all UP! Tells you something... if the earning numbers dont come in as expected,, the floor will drop out. This stock will never soar again until KOO KOO Ginny is GONE or the board is replaced."
"Anything below 115 is a serious buying opportunity. Let's see 9.5 eps stock trading at 120 or 1,600 PE Tsla, I wonder which is overvalued?"
"I thought I read somewhere that IBM had some interest in Bitcoin (or some similar tech), but I see nothing in this site's attached profile of Big Blue. Neither is there any mention of B C in Cray's profile. Not sure if there is a question there; maybe observation."
"Mrs. Rommetti has according to various insiders shown little interest ininteracting with top technologists in the company. This is perhapsone of the many reasons why she has failed so badly in her stewardshipof such an iconic American company.High time to replace this woman with a CEO that has a track record ofsuccessful management, and who has a strategic sense of where thebusiness needs to go.."
When is Ginni stepping down?
"Buffet is King. If we can persuade Buffet to come back to IBM, our shares will skyrocket out of the stratosphere. Ginni should wine & dine Warren Buffet. She should do what-ever he wants, if U get my drift. We've gotta get Buffet back."
$140 glass ceiling now broken. Boom!
Good week for Beamer coming up 150- 155 end of week
IBM is very week and has been headed lower for weeks. IBM is in a bear market and not worth the risk.
"IBM's total revenue fell 3.4% to $17.57 billion in the reported quarter, slightly below analysts' estimates of $17.62 billion,"
She was like a bad piece of furniture that desperately needed replacing.
just think if people here really new what they were talking about
Buy at $140 and below
IBM will announce agreement with APPLE
"Time for her to step down , bring red hat CEO in"
Jan 21 will answer a lot of questions-It could move it 130S.
Up over 3% today on no news. Imagine how much higher it will go when they announce Ginny is being replaced.
"After months and months,,IBM back above 150. Lets hope it can hold it."
"BOX is worth 2X today's price but it won't happen organically for years. With half the employees under water on options, acquisition is a must. $IBM $MSFT $GOOG $CRM $NOW $ORCL or a private takeover e.g. Softbank"
"Is to too late to buy? It went up 3% AH, expecting a pull back when market opens tomorrow."
171 to 115 is not the RIGHT MOVES.. EPS then we will find out but not til then
BOOM 3.0
"If you still hold IBM stock and you believe in the current CEO, pull up a long-term stock chart on IBM. You'll see see huge growth for decades (with a few short lapses) Until January of 2012. It has been down hill ever since then (with a few short-term spikes). January 2012 is when she took over as CEO. At this point, it has to be obvious that after almost seven years of continual decline she is not going to get the job done. If you still hold the stock I strongly suggest you think about ripping the band aid off before it gets even worse. The board should have acted years ago so there is little reason to think they will act now. The only person that can save you is you. Don't you think it's time to act?"
RBC pointed out the blockchain is a trillion dollar market.. IBM is the trusted partner for many fortune 500 shops in their expertise and security
"IBM is a dividend play only, similar to T, VZ, investment grade corp bonds, etc. Look at the charts the trend is still down. In 7 years the stock continues to decline when the market opportunity IBM competes in has more than doubled. Continued bloated bureaucracy and marginal top leadership will continue to plague IBM. The new CEO is doing the same as the previous failed Rometty, just more lay offs. Expect little to negative growth from IBM."
The high & seemingly-sustainable dividend yield (~6%) should provide a floor.
"Will the strong security practices win the US Jadi project. Trump is against Amazon, i hope he will trump the card and aware to IBM. IBM quantum computer could crack current encryption."
"let's see how this works out .... as mentioned previous in my post, IBM has been writing their enterprise software to support AAPL for awhile now ..."
nice move ...keep the divy payments coming
"Prediction IBM will hit 180 by July 1, 2018"
"If you believe the future of the world is going to be in Hybrid Cloud and Artificial Intelligence, then you need to buy IBM, put it away and don’t look back. Krishna, the new CEO is and will be shedding old school low margin businesses and focusing the future of IBM in these existentially essential sectors. This is hot. This is huge. This is happening now so get it."
Buy it under 140.00...new mgt is coming....this cannot continue.
looking very good from its oversold position this TuesdayThe premise for this is that the revenue and net income growth rates will be higher than projected. And a dividend increase is likely
"Is IBM going to rise again in 2020? In since August, initially had a nice little gain and now the pull back basically has me where i bought it at. Hoping to get back in the $140's at least."
stop complaining and act!. . vote to send rometty packing and vote out the bod who have violated their feduciary responsibility to the shareholders. Vote your shares !!!
How low does stock price need to fall before the Board does something about the CEO and her 'Vision'?
"not a good sign replacing CFO a week before the numbers...and the new CFO is espousing ""Blockchain"" when everyone is talking Blockchain...Rommety has to go..."
Heading to $130
Lots of selling today. Entire Portfolio down 1/2 % ... ibm is still rock solid. Long
IBM will be $200 in 2 years. Picking up momentum in its cloud business.
Revenue declined to $18.03 billion from $18.76 billion in the year-ago quarter with lower-than-expected revenue coming in from the company's global technology services segment. This marks the fifth quarter in a row that IBM’s year-over-year revenue has declined.
I owned this stock for 5 years and so disappointed. It is the time to make a change. Ginny was too old and we need new blood. Look at business opportunities and focus.
Arvind Krishna
Name one other tech growth stock that's breaking out to new highs and pays a divy north of 4%
IBM will hit 200 in 2020.
wow
what is your CEO thinking paying 63% premium??? I can see 30% but 62%???
"I recall the days when IBM was golden....a colossus of computing....everything they touched turnedgreen...but there were trouble spots...bad decisions re telephones, local networks, SNA etc. Thencame the disasters of the antitrust case, followed by the catastrophe of the PC years, as IBM spenthundreds of millions ultimately benefitting Microsoft and Intel, both companies now dwarfing thesickly IBM....these events clearly signalled that the company had severe management problems....despite the fact that in many cases, the technology was there. There was no good reason togo witht the Intel architecture....especially because the 360 instruction set was inherently superior(but of course the leaders at Armonk did not want to disturb the mainframe cash cow). Likewise,IBM could easily have marketted its own PC operating system...the reasons behind using Microsoftare controversial, and I hesistate to describe the rumors. Now for years we have seen a series of divestituresto raise cash, as various businesses declined under IBM management but thrived once removed (e.g.Lenovo). The one thing that Rometty appears to be succeeding with is diversity...appropos this,we have the statement: ""a drive for diversity is a drive for mediocrity."" IBM seems to an excellentillustration. The big question is...will the BOD remove Rometty before bankruptcy is inevitable? ."
even after a dividend increase...it can't hold 140 for more than 2 days. patgetic. it will stay like this till the bod resigns or they replace rometty
IBM reminds me of what GE was five years ago.
So far it appears that IBM has mastered the events to be the candidate for the worst corporate leadership award of this century.
This is actually up today?Time for a male ceo?
EPS WILL LAUNCH STOCK ABOVE $140
"On October 30th, 2018 IBM added $4 billion to its buyback program... I bet you they will be buying all the way to at least $135. The stock is super cheap now."
"What you see now as jump of AMD's PPS isn't, YET, tye full reaction to the $ibm news. It's just a rotation back to Nasdaq as expected, as seen with ibm's PPS reddish. .. the big jump on the news requires to digest their meaning and connect with many other things. That takes time. But will happen!"
"Buy during this market correction, and be rewarded if you hold for a while. Anything under around $115 - $120 is a bargain, as this will rebound soon in my opinion. This company is HUGE! And they have a ton of money, and some very smart people working there. They can turn this around, I'm sure. Good luck all!"
"When a company starts shouting ""BlockChain"" it is a last ditch effort to bolster the stock price. I am out mid day today. It usually drops in the afternoon after a rise. Good luck to all"
"What is causing the run-up? I own IBM stock from RHAT acquisition and I wished I sold at 130+ before, I would have sold all at high 150's after Ginni's announcement, but at that time I wasn't fully vested.."
Dividend announced 1.57 per share. No increase. IBM down on a 300 pt up day...not too encouraging
Will hit before end of week $150. or over- Upgrade coming and buy beak? will run
"Does anyone know why IBM spent $3.508Bn on Salaries and Wages in 2020, versus around $1 - $1.5Bn in previous years?Thanks."
i will go buy more tomorrow.thank you seller.
Underperformance when the market goes up and on its way down. Don't worry about suing a HR professional- worry about your shareholders first
Finally Ginni is out... looks like Redhat ceo will become ibm's ceo now he's the president. ..first step.Congratulations longs... ibm partners with $amd...!
it is great to know IBM insiders start buying shares
4.85% dividend yield at $133.50 and a good chance the stock will double in 2 years. Sweet..!
"Eight years ago today, IBM was $207.45. Ahh, the good ole days..."
up 3 dollars just a start for after hours
"Microsoft is now exactly 10X the market cap of IBM...and it all happened during Ginni's tenure as CEO. She didn't just miss the boat, she never even got to the dock!"
The BOD is failing to do its fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders. ALL stock grants and bonus money should be halted TODAY! No more free options and bonuses for poor performance and loss of market share. IBM has a bloated bureaucracy with more middle managers than people who actually get work done and produce product. Failure after failure after failure from the business units. The 8 year failure of strategy by Rometty and the BOD will bring the stock to another 52 week low. BOD DO YOUR JOB OR RESIGN!
"IBM CEO and BOD performance:01/01/2012 - Ginni Rometty becomes IBM CEO01/03/2012 - IBM stock price is 186.7301/03/2012 - Dow closed around 1236012/20/2018 - IBM stock price is trading around 114.80, a drop of around $72 a share12/20/2018 - Dow is around 23130While the Dow almost doubled, IBM stock dropped over 38%. A regular employee, with a performance similar to that at IBM, would get a 4 appraisal and be fired.IBM CEO and BOD are definitely not doing their job."
Sold software to India for 1.8 billion. Nice timing. Stock closed at high of day. Nice timing. Nice divvy.
"Coca-Cola European Partners accelerates its strategic transformation with IBM cloud, gaining traction...."
"If $IBM were to be made an acquisition offer, how much would they be valued at? Does anyone think it’ll get a 20% premium to the current market price?"
RBC analyst said blockchain market could read 1 trillion in 15 years. They forget that quantum computer will disrupt all security systems that worth likely more than a trillion. IBM should dominate quantum computer. It is the hardware that took 30 years of research.
"if you own shares, you received notification via email of the annual meeting, and your materials to vote on shareholder issues. I voted AGAINST every single board member."
"Picked up 2,000 shares... they make a good retirement yearly income of $12,560 as qualified dividends... while the stock appreciates through the years and I will sell when it gets to $250. Why not look  at NVDA, NFLX, etc. IBM has the capability, Financials and Expertise to continue to capitalize on the blockchain technology and cloud services. I do not see IBM staying this low for long, it was at $155 a month ago !! It’s crazy to short IBM at these low levels (11 year lows) while earnings per share continue to be over $12 per share and dividends grow. Good Luck to all Longs !!"
Anything down here below $120 is greenbacks for longs in my opinion. Dividends plus new growth factors starting to evolve.
Well...as a long term holder...i am screwed for a long time....shorts win again.....guess i can look forward to only a dividend
"IBM - the ""Rodney Dangerfield"" of tech stocks..."
Beamer showing Muscle lately poised for breakout?
"What is it with all these cloud copycat companies. Get it through your thick skull Arvind Krishna, IBM won't be able to defeat AWS and Azure. Focus on other technologies that you can compete easily and forget cloud."
"Congratulations to Arvind Krishna. I do not know much about him but I wish him well. I implore him to have the courage to make bold moves. They are needed if IBM is to survive and thrive. He cannot follow the path of his predecessor Ginni Rometty and have any chance of success.Rometty had a chance to be bold on day one by discarding the $20 EPS goal of her predecessor and instead focusing resources on the company's future. Instead of bold leadership, she chose to follow. That was a true crossroads moment. Spending the next few years pursuing that financial goal instead of investing in IBM's future led to dubious decisions that sealed IBM's fate over the next eight years. Instead of investing in the world-class workforce she inherited, she laid them off and hired overseas replacements with less education, experience, knowledge and loyalty (but, they were cheaper). It must have seemed the only way to get to the $20 EPS goal. By the time she finally gave up on the EPS goal it was no surprise to anyone. It had long been obvious the goal was unobtainable. Unfortunately by that time much damage had been done. To make matters worse, the ill-advised scorched-earth HR policies used to chase that goal had become ingrained and were considered best practices. The IBM of today is in many was a mere shell of what it once was. Even the best of employees that remain fear for their jobs.Enough about Rometty. Today is about Arvind Krishna. What I have read about him is impressive. I really hope he makes bold moves and saves this once great company. It is true that much has been lost over the last eight years but IBM is at another crossroad today. It was just a few years ago Steve Ballmer stepped down from Microsoft and was replaced by Satya Nadella. In just a few years, Nadella has done much to put Microsoft back on track. Look where they are today. I hope Arvind makes the bold moves at IBM that will deliver a similar turnaround.I know there are some who think IBM was on the right track. They like to say it takes a long time to turn around a big ship. Here are some hard numbers for them to consider. If you had invested $1,000 each in IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple at the market close on 1/3/12, the day Ginni Rometty became CEO of IBM, here are the results each of those investments would have achieved over the last eight years in a huge tech bull market:IBM: $1,000 -> $967 (Down 3.3%)Microsoft: $1,000 -> $7825 (Up 682.5%)Amazon: $10,449 (Up 944.9%)Apple: $1,000 -> $6,335 (Up 533.5%)These figures include adjustment for dividends paid and are as of the market close 1/30/20.Over the last eight years, IBM has lost $96 Billion in market capitalization.Clearly, IBM has not been on the right track.Again, congratulations go to Arvind Krishna. You have a huge challenge in front of you but it is also a great opportunity. Have the courage to make bold moves. This is a huge crossroads moment for IBM. Choose wisely and be an inspirational leader for your team. I wish you well."

Buy today. Put it away for a year. Don't look at it until next year.
"The big blue trying to be cutting edge again. Entering the more attractive sectors, but not as a leader! But as a follower. Jim Canos has a short position, well respected smart guy. Dividend looks attractive, restructuring a year out.........you have to be neutral at best,"
Wow. above 148. Now I'm wondering if we could hit 149.
"If you part of the tech staff servicing these products and the support that goes along with them, start looking for a job as IM SURE, this HCL wont be taking people for the long term, just transition, just products then you will be let go."
"Does anyone know how far IBM has come in terms of Quantum Computing? ,,, IMO as big as 5G is ,,I think QC will be the next block buster ,,, thanks in advance"
Best to break it up into 3 or 4 smaller companies! Hard to turn around a big ship! Past 10 yrs were poorly managed still has lots of patents not utilized.
"The problem with IBM is not their products, services or tech expertise. Its the management structure is WAY over past bloated with do nothing middle managers who drive people like slaves so they get their stock awards. Too many technical layoffs, an army of accountants, not enough sales, marketing, and with a BOD with dimwhit rometty syndrome, IBM May become the next GE."
"IBM, should stop ASAP making their own chip to cut cost, let undervalued AMD make the real superior chip for HPC & super computers."

another great pete najarian call from CNBC evrytime he tells you to buy it sells off I wish he wouldnt comment on IBM at ALL !!!!
IBM needs to buy Cloudera yesterday. AI and Hybrid Cloud is right in their wheelhouse. IBM better hurry before someone else gobbles them up.
"Don't be fooled, $intc had a terrible outlook being flat. That's while the datacenter grows at 50% and more y2y, PCs growth prediction including laptops. Intel’s mixing different products to hide it's future decline. Remember Micron and Samsung doing great on SSD/NANDFlash. Intel makes thes3 products and it's growing. But net is 2%? Horrible. Look at another hyped sucsess. $ibm. Beat by 0.1% and its pps jumping yesterday. But its cloud and new cycle of mainframe just out drove that plus additional revenues from redhat bought for $34B. No ibm isn't doing well at all though cloud did ok. Look at IBM's pps today. See? Intel is exactly this case will sink deep. When amd ER reveals huge growth this year, game over for Intel. See how institutions offload shares to retail investors. Same Wallstreet game."
OK. Now pulled back and settled around $134 for the take off! Will reach $150 by the end of the year!
"Probably a lot of people are doing end of year tax-loss selling of IBM to offset gains made in their other investments. See, IBM does have a place in your portfolio after all!!"

"Acquisition of Red Hat will be the fall of IBM. Not because of technology challenges, nor for financial hurdles. It will be because of a clash of cultures. The IBM machine will no doubt work to fold Red Hat into the blue fabric of programmatic processes, rules, uncertainty and anxiety. Eventually, little red will show the big blue wolf the power of culture in today’s society. IBM will learn the hard lesson that culture is at the heart of today’s digital transformation. How I long too see IBM’s old furniture replaced (10 yrs at IBM)."
"I can only imagine the board meeting with IBM's B.O.D. sitting there with the chart of IBM's stock price hidden behind Ginni while she rambles on how the new direction the company has taken has been so successful. This is as close to the 'wizard of Oz' as a company can get. Can anyone unseat her, shame her, point out the obvious failures...??For God's sake...ENOUGH!"
We will see...everyone had rainbow eyes when it hit 150. Hope earnings are good and they announce Ginny is leaving...stock to 180
"IBM was one of the greatest companies on earth. In the present, IBM continues to manage to a downward revenue cycle. With most companies across the globe putting capital expenses on hold, the second and third quarters in 2020 could be a real challenge for IBM revenue. IBM accountants will need to spend cash wisely and preserve as much as possible, this downturn from the virus and liberal governor shutdowns could go longer than expected."

Great results
"A closer look at the numbers shows that The growth in Red Hat’s cloud revenue has been largely at the expense of IBM’s other cloud offerings. I read that if you include figures for Red Hat, IBM’s YoY cloud growth was less this quarter than it was in the same quarter last year. Since we are told Red Hat revenues are increasing much faster than that, it appears that much of the growth has come from cannibalism of IBM’s prior cloud offerings. Those sales must have fallen off a cliff. The increase in Red Hat sales appear to be having a far greater impact on IBM’s legacy cloud sales than the sales of its cloud competitors who continue to grow faster in the cloud than IBM (even with Red Hat). So much for the synergy IBM claimed buying Red Hat would bring. Celebrating a small earnings beat under these circumstances seems ill advised."
"would love to see the last 20 minutes today back up the rest of the day and finish strong. need investors, not day trade scalpers"
Question for yahoo...when will you adjust P/E and EPS on your site...?
IBM will benefit hugely from lower rates with their debt from buying Red Hat.
IBM is #$%$ stock....always moving down.
Sell if 155?
Little reprieve before we go up some more. Buy.
Company X has a PE of 1400+ and earns $0.39/share (ttm)Company Y has a PE of 14 and earns $8.80/share (ttm)Which company is the better investment?
"I saw someone talk about Rometty's CEO pay, pulling the belt tight, etc. Trust me when I tell you that the belt is tight. The employees have not seen a raise this year and the bonus was under 1% for most. Clearly Rometty is being paid handsomely to destroy the company. The more she is paid, the more market and money IBM looses.. Next stop, a buyout from Google or Microsoft? Wouldn't that be a rub!"
The overall downward trend will continue until upper management is replaced.
Is it finally time for the rise of the machines? I've held for so long that I don't know if this is the real deal or not
monday it will repair all these red numbers :-)
Going to 115
Great visionary tech company. First IBM buys and then they split. The stock went from $180/s 3 years ago to $126/y today. I think that sums it up. Almost forgot: Ginni made all the money.
Just lost 2 years of dividends in one day. What a piece of $!-!I+
Record low stock price indicates wall st is not happy with this Hail Mary acquisition..
"Do your own math, IBM's business excluding cloud has declined 11%. There is of course a portion of that which has been cannibalized out of their legacy and reported as cloud. But still it's a huge number given this Qs revenue mostly comes from backlog and recurring streams."
"I am starting to think all IBM will be is a DIVIDEND bank account,,,collect Dividends and thats it since it can not get back up at all, what year will we see the run back over 150"
"Well, that was fun while it lasted. Happiness is fleeting with this stock."
"It looks like even if they get rid of Ginny, the stock will trade between $100 - $120 range for years to come! If IBM elects to cut the dividend or the expected market collapse comes after the mid-term election, then the stock could collapse significantly below $100 price!! JMHO, Tex"
Let's hope that IBM's business strategy will now be something other than stock buybacks at inflated prices.
Up up and away!
"It's called International Business Machines. The business machines are gone. what's left. Consulting services, Blockchain, Cloud services. Do you think revenue and earning will increase or decrease with the new services ?"
IBM is a _____managed company. Fill in blank with adjective.
Ginni is out and stock will move up now.
hedge funds want to oust Ginni b/c she didn't kowtow to them and appear on CNBC clown show. They did that to Elon/Tesla for a long time until elon won the last laugh. IBM will also win against those ego mania clowns in the end

"Ginny needs to go before it is too late, if not already."
"extremely bullish looking out at the next 5-10 years. Cloud, Quantum Computing and AI will lead IBM back to innovation and growth. However the spinoff IMO will not add any fundemental value to IBM shares unless they load new co with debt. I do not see a substantial uptrend in stock price until a year or 2 after the spinoff."
investors suffer while pin head ceo collects her check and options. the only reason to remain in the stock is the dividend and the fact most investors are under water. low growth and heavy debt will kill the stock
"Manniel,Sorry, 2019 will prove to be great for US stocks with GE as one those “debated”stocks that will join many others UPWARD!"
The sad demise of a once great company. Lets stay tuned to see how much of a bonus the BOD awards Ginny for the fine performance this past year.
IBM can't even grow revenue in its analytics/Watson division.
Good cc. Strong second half pipeline. FCF over 14 billion. 5g Edge. Strong growth in cloud. Red hat 34%. Also worth noting that under the new Ceo IBM is entering new markets! Telecom as an example. i will add to my position on any weakness.Hybrid cloud market alone is HUGE.
"2016-08-31 SCO vs. IBM: SCO brief, oral argument request In 1998, SCO and IBM entered into a Joint Development Agreement todevelop and license a UNIX-based operating system for an anticipated 64-bitprocessor that Intel had announced. This joint venture was called ProjectMonterey. At that time, SCO dominated the market for businesses seeking UNIXbasedoperating systems to run on Intel processor-based hardware, a market IBMestimated to be worth $3 billion in 1998.IBM abandoned the partnership, however, and never released a generallyavailable operating system. Knowing that its decision to abandon the projectwould mean not getting a license to SCO’s valuable code, IBM pretended toproceed with Project Monterey to induce SCO to contribute its code to theproject’s development. IBM then took SCO’s code and used it in its own AIX forPower operating system – despite failing to meet the condition for obtaining alicense to that code.IBM’s misappropriation of code, threats, and advertisement ofimprovements in Linux grievously harmed SCO, which had offered to join forceswith IBM to share specialized technological code and expertise toward what SCOhad hoped would be a fruitful and fair partnership.See SCO brief, oral argument request at https://www.scribd.com/document/374812929/SCO-brief-oral-argument-request"
big drop this month. is this an old dog going down or just a stumble leading to a quick run?
WOW IBM revenue rising thats new
Serious opinions...is this a good time to buy IBM since it dropped? Thinking about it. Thanks
Stock is usually pumped up before earnings and then crash. Maybe these downgrades are a good sign?
Under $100 in 2 weeks
Finally break 130
I think the geezers on IBM board are afraid to replace a woman CEO with a qualified man. They are afraid of lawsuits and the fake news media! JMHO.Tex
Red hat purchase will show in time to have been a waste of shareholder value. Give it one year.
A bunch of Red Hat news this morning. Not sure why it doesn’t show under IBM news within Yahoo Finance.
"Big Blue is going higher and will be here riding high long after I am under the sod. It's a safe place and I prefer it that way. There is no doubt in my mind they have now, and will continue to have, the best and brightest in their R&D campus."
Earnings are up. Fantastic. IBM’s turnaround is going nicely. Even in times like these. We even get a fat dividend.
"I'll tell you what the real existential threats are to most people and its not climate change. It's cancer and heart problems. Why spend so much resources on climate change which is at best speculative and controversy that man has a role in it and concentrate on the real ""existential"" treats to every human alive? Didn't Sleepy Joe say he was going to cure cancer??"

IBM is so 80's.
Its amazing that everyone is getting happy about the stock move of 10 bucks in the last 10 days after it fell almost 70 in less than 1 month! A rising market lifts most all securities.
"The ultimate comparison EPYC Rome vs top IBM's Power9 processors, top ARM and Intel's Xeon server processors. CLEAR winner - AMD by big margins. $intc and $ibm should understand why big IBM Cloud with AMD EPYC Rome is launching this quarter. $nvda losing ibm's Power processors as connection to their GPUs with NVLink. ARM isn't in the same league. Zen3 7nm+ EPYC Milan coming at Computex June 2nd with big integrated designed Arcturus 7nm+ GPUs. This IS the ULTIMATE datacenter. Amd's pps? Lol $100 easy!https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=rome-power9-arm&num=1"

"It was pounded so hard, like a Kartrashian, of course at that stage a beat is not out of the question. The strong downtrend is still in place."
IBM was one of the greatest American companies.
Totally agree with you Ray... Sam rode Lou Gerstner’s coat tails and just bought back stock and sold off businesses but never invested for the future. Ginni tried to right the ship and Krishna should hopefully take this to be a cloud giant soon ... They are big on AI and Quantum Computing and should hopefully be ready for the next wave in those areas
Looks like $ibm offering of bare metal cloud using AMD EPYC Rome is just the begining. It will expand to VMs and containers latter. Bare metal is first in ibm's hybrid cloud strategy. So enterprises may install new epyc rome setvers at their private cloud datacenters to work with tgese public cloud servers in hybrid mode. Expanding revenues for amd and ibm providing the management to create such work gaining revenues too. Win win. Wait for the artificial intelligence Watson running on these... best!https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/amd-on-ibm-cloud-bare-metal-servers
Don't know if this is good or bad news but IBM & Google are partnering where Google will be a vendor of IBM Power Systems.News came out today at TechCrunch.com

IBM is up 5.63% to 131.06
"IBM biggest stumbling block at present is their corp leadership. Mr. Buffet has known this, which is why Berkshire has scaled back their IBM holdings significantly. Buffet invests in well-run companies, not just companies with potential growth prospects. The fact that IBM stock has gone nowhere during the biggest bull market in the last 50 years is simple proof how the market sizes up IBM's prospects. The plain truth is that IBM needs new corp leadership. IBM NEEDS a new CEO .... a fully competent CEO, and the BOD needs to ACT on this. IBM needs to do more than just shuffle around one or two existing executives into new posts. This will do nothing to cure their leadership problem. A successful company is led by competent executives who know how to LEAD, not REACT, to global opportunities, and make it happen."
"IBM was traditionally a company led by sales people...the success of 360 was such thatthe company could and did hire the best technologists...so there were successes such asdisk drives, Selectric typewriters and fundamental advances in compilers and operating systems.The current company combines a low paid (compared to the competition) technical staff witha clueless management focused on affirmative action and gender equality. The old IBM isgone, and the company will enter terminal decline unless top management is shown the door.GE board could do the job...why not IBM's BOD?"
Buying some ibm now way imo to cheap. new management imo will turn us around. Buffett once loved this company. Only sold in imo because he did not believe in Ginny who was in over her head.
I love the dividend BUT Rommetty is IBM's IMMELT who ran GE into the ground!
This stock remembers me oil/gas stocks. Trading sideways for 6 months and ultimately crashing hard near March lows. I would buy IBM after a big washout in the chart. I think IBM at $90-$99 is a screaming buy
"Hi All, I always knew that ibm is a strong company and i started to buy the stocks right after it dropped below 200 MA. I was expecting it will jump and i will be good. But nooo... it kept going down it pierced through all major supports. My average is 148 and i want to hear from people who know ibm better than me. If it break 143 if goes down to 140. I am out of funds to lower the cost."
THIS STOCK WILL RALLY 100 POINTS WHEN THEY FIRE THIS CEO
Chief Executive Ginni Rometty needs to get out for sure !!!!
"Red Hat was $175 just a few months ago, so an 8.5% premium to that price. The buyout price is not out of line. Go IBM."
"If we can get Buffet back on board with IBM, this stock will sky-rocket to 250+. Let's get some of our Yahoo Message Board colleagues out to Omaha, Nebraska to ""press the flesh"" with Buffet and to ""jaw-bone"" him and persuade him to get back in IBM in a big way. Let's send some of our colleagues out to Omaha to ""meet & greet"" with Buffet. Is everyone on board?"
"if IBM stock is of your interest, try google ""2 Value Stocks That Can Outperform FANG Stocks Sooner Than You Think"" because Yahoo deletes every post with a link to the article and even on its web pages...I guess in this shift moderators are on the short side and short side is on the crystal legs..."
Smart strategic move IBM.
"International Business Machines Corporation share price is down 23% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 48%. That's just the last 3 years. Extrapolating that out to 5, 7, and 10 years and its VERY ugly."

"today's news: Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley this morning reiterated her Overweight rating, and $198 price target, writing that IBM is positioned to lead in a “new computing cycle” dominated by things such as A.I.

Insiders are buying its own shares and new 5G cloud for telecom companies and partnership with others plus great dividend making IBM an attractive investment
"Average volume is 5M shares/day. On 9/21 volume was 20M shares and price went to 152. Let's assume 12.5M of these shares were buybacks so IBM could report and EPS 'Beat' for Q3. Lets assume they bought back 12.5M shares today at $128 vs. $152 on 9/21, they could have helped put a bottom under this POS and saved $24/share or $300,000,000. Buybacks should be used when stock undervalued, not to prop up earnings to protect executives."
so far it has held up pretty good. guidance will be the main thing.
"hey IBM I never question how great of a company you are, im always long...Im long the AR sector now as well, NEXCF and IPNFF are the only two companies selling AR as a product, the potential is huge for people who understand, GLTA and check out the apple event from last week which has been a catalyst for augmented reality"
rh is not going to save the business. it is a small portion of the overall business. IBM lost the Jedi contract on price and it's workforce primarily off shore poses security concerns. so msft walks away with a huge contract that should have been a slam dunk for ibm. too many managers add cost to contract numbers and put Ibm at a disadvantage
"IBM Watson Genomics . CEO Rometty is not kidding, Watson will be bigger than the rest of the company, long term. Meanwhile, the transition to cloud and high-margin products is almost complete. Today is a lucky move down, I am buying with both hands for the long-term."

"About one and a half months ago, I started mentioned how ridiculous it is that mighty IBM has been taken over by a relative unknown Zoom. at 100b.Well in a mere 5 weeks, Zoom is now worth 140b , and mighty IBM with top AI, cloud , quantum and all the bombastic terms is still stuck at 100b. So now even 3 rd tier companies are leaving IBM in the dust.So what should we compare IBM with next , fastly teledoc ?"
I STILL IMHO EXPECT BY YEARS END A SLIGHT DIVIDEND INCREASE FOR THE 25YR MARK.
Oct report coming soon-lets hope RED HAT delivers.
great dividend pay more than bank interest rate for CDs.
Maybe finally time to buy? Could be the next Microsoft. When Ballmer finally left.

"IBM will break $130 today, and $135 after tomorrows earnings call. If we can get a lower resistance level of $130, then $135 will be the next level. If that is reached, we will test the $140 level. Great dividend for such a good value Stock price."

This new format is terrible
Any recent comments on splitting up the company? It was a big positive when first announced. Not sure of the timing.
I know no one wants to hear the word SPLIT but I would like to see it so I can buy it lower and watch it grow.
I was always told - be careful what you wish for. Hope this is positive news.
Best stock buy in the market. IBM has re-invented itself and is poised to accelerate its growth in hybrid cloud. Red Hat acquisition was a brilliant move. Plus the 5% dividend is an added plum as it growth its stock price. The ultimate long term thinking company.
"IBM is a company that prides itself on performance measurements for all of it's employees, and over the last few decades has been ruthless in slashing any/all employees who do not measure up (and, sadly, many that do). It's pretty sad that after almost 6 years of the most pitiful leadership in the company's history, not only does Ginny Rometti keep her job, but she is awarded massive bonuses on top of it. This is beyond hypocrisy, this is borderline insanity. And this is why the stock is where it is, with little hope of recovery under the current leadership."
Ginni is amazing!

ibm going to 200
Stock price is lower today then September of 2001. That sums it up.
i think the news will be good enough to boost the stock price after the bell. even if the stock price stays the same you get a big fat dividend for holding it. better than a 30 year treasury paying 1%.
What IBM really needs is an Asian/middle Eastern male CEO. Like a Satya nadella from Microsoft or a Jensen Huang from Nvidia. White CEO's demand way too much compensation for not doing much of anything (example Jeff Immelt)

Finally- liberation day for the languished stock price. BoD should have done this years ago but thankfully it's done. Up 10 tomorrow on the relief rally and upgrades as the future is finally bright and company now driven by someone who knows how to get it done - an experienced technician.
Is it possible for a stock to be up after ex dividend date?
"I won’t pretend to know more than Jim Chanos except I do recall him saying, some time ago, that Tesla was a good short. We all know what happen to that short for Jim! I get the sense, from that article, that he is suggesting some accounting “trickery” with IBM to make their EPS look legit. If IBM gets near $120.00, I’m considering a limit order on 100 shares. They have been faithful with their dividend!"
"IBM will continue to lose contract bids because of inflated costs added to each contract for 4 layers of management who add no value to the end product. when IBM was successful and winning in the market, there was 2 layers of mgmt."

Still think IBM will hit 400.00 a share within two years buying all I can!
This is what happens when you run a company hyper-MBA style for decades and then hire a couple technical people after it's already too late.

"Just buy IBM and add as it drops. Five years from now, you will be glad you did. Too much good news priced in on other tech stocks."
So much for doom and gloom. Bang on the eps report. Big blue looks like it has turned the corner finally.
Wonder how many people were let go to make those numbers. That was a big leap from 3rd qtr numbers... And with billions going for the merger of red hat..makes me think something or someone paid the price.
"I bought on 2/5 @152.79 saw it go up on 2/6 on the news about the CEO swap to 158 and change now it's down -5.1% in six trading sessions, I don't know I thought it was a good trade at the time I wish the new CEO all the best."
10 pe for 2019! I’ll take some more tomorrow
Buffet is out
Arvind please flatten the IBM organization. It is bloated with way too many VP’s and too many MBA’ that add little value to IBM’s bottom line. Half it the VP’s at IBM could be let go with no negative impact on revenue! Do it today! That will signal real change to Walk Street!

With a forward PE of 10 and a dividend of 4.5% and EPS growth (driven by higher margin cloud investments) you accumulate IBM here. In 3 years will be $190. Good luck!
Bank of Thailand Launches World's First Government Savings Bond on IBM Blockchain Technology
WOW!! You downgrade it here UBS? Brilliant!!
"Never been much of a believer in IBM, but when it dropped to $95, I loaded up on the promise of Watson and Blockchain initiatives. It was sitting at around $130 and then heard all the bad news about failed blockchain and started to drop fast and I sold around $119 taking my profits.. the minute I sold it turned round and was back up to $145 in less than a 60 days... :( I want to be long in this segment... I am very diversified including a good mix of real estate, industrials, retail but I like to hand pick my winners in the high growth tech space already having nice position in MSFT, Google, Amazon and NVIDIA.. I see IBM as too big, slow, old and carrying all the bones of it's ancestors.. when they do win it seems to be through size and position and not nimble ingenuity .. Anyways, not owning IBM really bugs me.. almost like a dark horse bet. waiting for spot to get back in and trying to forget I sold at $119."

Great way to unlock shareholder value. Nice going IBM management. Nice going. Big Blue and “NewCo” shall rise again.
did ibm announce dividend date and amount for november yet? just another variable to worry.
Back down to $130 next week. Buckle up folks we are late cycle and anything goes here. Risky days ahead
Hard to understand why anyone would be surprised by this. The last quarter was bad too. The stock only went up because it wasn’t quite as bad as expected. It was obvious the mainframe sales helped drive the slight yearly revenue increase and additionally obvious they wouldn’t save the day this time. Stop expecting the CEO to be even adequate. She has failed consistently for 7 years. Why would you expect her to magically succeed now or at any time in the future? She talks a good show but never delivers. How much more of your money do you want her to destroy?
"Call Warren Buffet, the genius stock investor, to ask him what to do with IBM, he'll tell you."
IBM Slated to earn 12.41 next year. Historic pe is 15 times earnings put a 13.3 handle on that 165 per share. Numbers never lie. Ibm also reducing its debt. New Ceo made a politically correct move with face recognition imho Besides was not making much if any money on it.Amzn is also doing the same now.Llastly Fidelity top tech fund holds a top ten position in IBM. Always do your own dd but i am holding all of my Ibm shares. Good luck.
"Great Intel news re selling Chip division for about $9 Billion, IBM also has different hidden assets it could sell to surface value. This INTC news bodes well for incredibly cheap IBM. Market is insane now, ZOOM worth more than IBM with only a small fraction of revenue and no profits. Ultimately, many of these growth at ANY price investments will crash and burn (as they always do). Solid free cash flow generating companies (dividend aristocrat as well) will do just fine. Short term thinking and investing is a recipe for very poor investing over the long run. Bullish"
days to manipulate earnings figures aka financial engineering for cos like IBM r finally over..I.e borrowing cheap money to buy back stocks or pay dividends is gone.. its okay back time now.. short or buy puts

Moving in the right direction. $117 to $136 pretty good. Looking for $150
Still undervalued
IBM is a totally new company since the past 3 years. I have seen the changes firsthand. More amazing things have happened in the past 3 years than in the previous 20 combined. This should be a $200 stock. It's brightest days are still ahead.
Ginni Rometty turns 61 today. Why is she still running this company?
I dont understand why the market hates ibm so much. it's not that bad and financials improving every day. yet it is constantly beat up
Insiders are buying big time. This should move up to $125.00 by end of week and then $135.00 bu end of month.
"the run from 117 to 140 back to 125 then the plunge to 117 is a complete cycle and seems rigged, they used earnings to drop it like a lead balloon"
6.00 dividend....
at least were not Facebook! LMAO
The only difference between this stock and the Titanic is the Titanic had a band.
IBM continues stock buy back and will increase earning per share as capital spending will increase for business for this year and next
IBM the rock in my portfolio.
Not good today but it can go back to $150 before end of the year!
i like ibm a d i like the 6 buck div
Anyone know any cheap stocks with good future? I’m new to stocks
They should have kept Redhat as is and should have expanded its business .IBM cloud have merge with REDHAT as well .
So far the new Ceo is doing a fine job imho. Clear vision. Any stock can be manipulated look at the Wolf of Wall st. TGT was 48 a share a couple of years ago and people sold at the bottom. Over time earnings and pps must converge. So when we earn over 13 dollars a share again apply a conservative 13.3 multiple and we get 173 a share. Once IBM imho shows sustained growth again new highs will follow. Long term investors should not check the pps everyday and avoid these message boards if you have a weak stomach. Me i buy every chance i can at these levels.
"I used to work at IBM in the licensing group: you could see this coming. The company is a ""dead man walking"", and puts diversity above business. Expect that the dividend will be cut + no more share buybacks, and there will be a write down of goodwill for the Redhat acquisition. The financial engineering will only provide a smokescreen for so long - in fact, the bright light of truth is beginning to show it for what it is, borderline fraud!"
vote your proxy to vote out bod and rommety before IBM becomes the next ge
LOL JUST SAYING WITH LITTLE GROWTH IN 2019 I WOULD SEE 140 B4 180 IMO! IF CISCO RECENT CLOUD GROWTH SLOWED WON'T THAT ALSO B THE CASE FOR IBM'S? BUFFETT GOT OUT 4 A REASON.

The IBM bull is ready to gore its way to the SP500 chart from dog of the Dow to Bull of the Dow for 2021. Welcomes to join IBM’s bull run!
Getting real tired of the lack of performance. New management - maybe via AAPL buyout.
"IBM needs to build things that people need. An affordable hybrid or electric car, an IBM Phone, Washer and dryer ( lol ) and a really good services business to support these devices. lets call it IBD = international business devices."
"Individually, we cant do much as the execs and big money people hold a LOT of IBM stock. Unless we all vote our small amount of shares to stop the BOD from being re-elected, they will get re-elected and the pain will continue. Watch closely. If the BOD does not act, VOTE YOUR SHARES to get THEM OUT."
"Apparently, IBM is still appealing to retirees who are too distracted by quarterly dividend payments to realize their principal is constantly declining. They would be better off in CDs."

"Bought IBM in the early 90's. Two splits later and dollar cost averaging every month since then I now own 10,500 shares. Ten years ago I was up $1 million. Now my profit is only half that although my stake is higher. The Rometty years have been a disaster and the BOD have contributed nothing. One poster claims the stock will hit $175 quickly. This is a pipe dream. I will settle for that if it takes 5 years. More likely to decline I am sorry to say. I am holding for the dividend since my yield on my average cost per share is around 9%. Let's hope there is something in future that brings up the share price but right now I don't see it."

Time for IBM to have a run like VIAC
How are Ginny’s “strategic imperatives” working out? Has the turn around happened yet? I know it’s only been 5+ years since the “transformation” started. But thought I would check in and see how it’s doing?
30% growth in cloud? Can't say this is good for IBM's competitors.
"The market has spoken...Rometty cost to shareholders this last couple of weeks: about $40 a share. One recallsFiorina and her purchase of Compaq, which almost deep-sixed HP...sheer arrogance...After multiple times being named the worst CEO in the S&P, she could have retired quietly (at 61 she is over the traditional age of IBM retirementfor executives, which is 60). Instead, she decide on a ""brilliant"" move...putting the company and hundreds of thousands of employees and retirees at risk."
This is so painful. Why does Ginni still have a job???
$200 a share by xmas. Ya baby
1 % growth ??????....wow...what a powerhouse......that's a rounding error anywhere else
You better all prepare yourself for IBM to be removed from the DOW. IBM no longer is a fair representation of an IT company. They would better put MSFT instead.
Bit uneasy about the aug monthly 150 calls I am holding. Should I buy put to hedge it or should I sell it tomorrow morning at whatever price? Any advice is highly appreciated
"This thing could turnaround in time it's been a mean machine before, great dividend too."
This dog has the potential to drop well below 130 before the day is over.
"MY BUY TARGET WAS 118, but since they paid 15 billion more for red hat than market, I have now lowered the entry point to 103.I hate when companies overpay for acquisitions. 10-15% may be justified but 50-100 is not.Good Luckcontinue to wait."
"stock is absolutely oversold, 122-128 is fair range. that said, azure 50% you growth is a slap in IBM execs' faces. IBM cloud saw 10% you growth with all kinds of financial engineering, reorg magics. Growth driven name Redhat grew only 19%. Hybrid cloud my f. as. Even if the market is big, IBM wouldn't be able to be the one who grabs it."
"IBM could be a leader in block chain tech, which is the future of all transactions."
"Companies that bought these products are in a bad place. First they will now have to deal with a curry house directly and secondly and more importantly, they can be sure there will be no more updates. What they have is now end of life. HCL is not a SW developer, they can't maintain nor update the software."
I bought in at 90
I agree with the Ceo that cutting the work force. IBM has way to many employees and that would help their bottom line. Now is the time for once to put the shareholders first.
This purchase marks the start of RedHat losing its supposed independence.

"The wh prediction made by Morgan Stanley's Katie Huberty that she sees the stock going to 198 is modest PE ratio of 14.29. A 14 PE of a giant like IBM is low for a company in the lead on AI, blockchain, security, quantum computing and other new technologies and services. IBM will show a lot of cloud growth because the offer more integrated services for the cloud.Assuming IRS delivers on revenue and net income progress on their high growth sectors, the 14 PE would be far too low.I personally think, that good revenue and net income progress for 1Q2018 will justify a PE of 18 - that would bring the stock up to $250. I am merely making the point that Huberty's forward 14 PE in justifying $198 is low. We shall see the progress they are making in their next report in mid-April. These is also some speculation that IBM will increase its dividend in April. The bottom line: the stock is a strong buy at current levels. We can all agree that if IBM delivers, as expected on its current advanced and cutting edge technologies, the IBM PE can go much higher. Assuming a forward PE of something like 18 (reasonable when compared to similar growth companies), the stock can ride up easily to $250. My point here is only that $198 can"

"What’s the chances that several of IBM’s R&D and offerings have been hard to monetize until recently?When you look at AI, block chain, automation and the addition, although a little late to the party, cloud and hybrid cloud, it seems IBM is poised to capitalize heavily for the next 5-10 years.The growth in fintech, crypto, e-commerce and the push to automate assembly lines with smart AI, and big data analysis needs, leads me to believe that the next 10 years could be IBM’s return to a leader in technology"

IBM dropped below its resistance level of 130. BAD NEWS! Ginny needs to step down or the BOD replaced!

I’m not in this stock but congrats to everyone that played bullish on earnings
"IBM did not have good numbers, earninbgs are the most manipulated figures & even a dying co can show good earnings by cutting costs layoffs etc.. IBM has had YOY declining revenues and lacklustre forecast,, I am surprised it is still at this price point. Maybe its getting a gift fro uncle SAM. The 10year 10 billion Pentagon contract is to be awarded to a single vendor."
the short are encouraging each other... give them some support... it's too early for them to start running away from us...
Watson is the best product by far IBM fails to see the value in getting Watson into houses before businesses and this is why amazon will ultimately win

"Rometty, while making over $32 million annual compensation, and a member of the highly prestigious Augusta National Golf Club, and serving on numerous Boards, just doesn't have the talent to compete in the high-tech world and win. This has been demonstrated by IBM's over-leveraged balance sheet and dismal, failed performance during this historic bull market.The old non-tech oriented Board will protect her. In effect, our company is held hostage by Rometty and the Board. They are failing, they are intransigent. And they should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, having hurt so many people, and continuing to wreck their damage."

Buy for the dividend and some growth potential. IBM is listed as a 2021 Dividend Aristocrat.
Misprint? 3.4 Billion more like it!!!
Warren Buffett liked Ibm IT and services firm. In part because of its wide moat. Clients are reluctant to change IT providers he said. Think he sold because of Ginny. He liked share buybacks and the dividend increases of IBM.
IBM needs to be leaner. So many highly paid directors and VPs sitting and collecting big checks. What for? I don’t know. True that IBM worker employees are paid low but execs paid way high than they deserve. IBM how can you make your worker employees feel strong if you keep negelecting them. Lots of high exec checks should be discontued and instead added to worker employee incentives.

"Unless the people in charge change, this stock isn't going up anytime soon."

My next dividend reinvestment will net more shares. Woo hoo!
I don’t think a male CEO will make a difference. I think the larger issue is they can’t sell into China because of the Chinese theft of intellectual property. Until that gets resolved IBM and other high tech companies won’t see the high growth consumer based companies have who have access to that market.
IBM on sale likely due to month end selling. Buy.
I really don't understand this company. Quarters after quarters they keep disappointing and yet the stock is trading around $140 all the time. Hello? What are people investing in IBM for?Will someone please explain to me? Am I missing something here?
"Down again today. Support at 140 is essential. If it drops below that, watch out. IBM is BLOATED with middle managers who are more interested in their bonus that the business. Rumors are swirling about layoffs in September AGAIN."

Warren buffet once again was absolutely right to leave this dog and run for the hills.

Very nice pop..... Hope they can build off of this

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-managers-discussed-ways-thin-191017816.htmlThis has been going on for years. Why were the same criteria not used to eliminate IBM's CEO?
enough is enough. Ginny R has had her chance to execute the plan and she has failed. She talks a great game but the results are what matters. The board needs to take action and give Jim/RedHat a shot at moving this company forward. I know I am not alone in my thoughts and frustration. Ginny is a great sales person but has fallen way short in executing and running this great company as CEO. I will stay long but frustrated with the lack of performance. It looks like the div is safe from what I see.
Wait for it....
I’m selling at $130.
Morgan Stanley said that 145-180 is doable next year for IBM with the coming split! both businesses will be stronger and cloud and AI will grow. I trust Morgan Stanley above all other firms. CEO will turn the co around imho just like the new Ceo at Microsoft did years ago! Red hat is the game changer.

"Let me repeat, companies should avoid flaw processors with patches that will damage their brands if there're better options. Yahoo don't delete my posting......"
Hello IBM longs. I don't own ibm's shares but i wanted to post here about a possible big play for ibm in hybrid cloud at both enterprise and shared cloud infrastructure. Leveraging unique ibm's position in the enterprise that actually runs IT operation for big enterprises. It's nothing integrated as anyone else has with Microsoft and Amazon clouds. Ibm's $34B Redhat buy play well into this as well as AI Watson Cognitive analytics deap learning etc.This has to do with $amd GPUs and CPUs integrated in a way $nvda and $intc cannot achieve. Ibm's Power processors aren't going to make it because nvidia wasn't a good partner for ibm ripping off the price. Hence ibm has not won the supercomputer bid with Pathfinder DOE initiative. Cray has with AMD Frontier win. Intel won by default because 1. They were late in previous phase cancelling Knights GPUs and 2. DOE needs 2 wins of which ibm could make it. So I've posted a number of posts related to ibm and amd. Including ibm's general manager of cloud infrastructure saying in a video last Sep in Rome the advantages of using amd's EPYC processors including for AI and machine learning. Also recent moves of key ibm's Power processors technical and executive leadership to AMD putting in charge of amd's GPUs re to machine learning and tight CPUs and GPUs integration. Cannot happen without ibm's agreement as these people have ibm's confidential info on processors and AI related to ibm's IP. So ibm said in Sep they will reveal details of cloud computing with AMD EPYC this Q. If so i think big impact to push ibm and amd higher shares price! Please do comment if you're familiar with ibm's plans etc! Thanks.
The days of the men in blue suits running around your company like they owned the place is long gone...
These are the times that hype will lose and real merits will prevail. Big hype operations with lousy products and services all surviving on hyped marketing will crush. $ibm $tsla $intc $mu $nvda are examples. But AMD has real products and merits at fair prices. This will trigger buying AMD accross the board. From datacenters to PCs to laptops and embedded solutions.
Congratulations to all of us that are currently buying when prices have dropped. We will be rewarded. I'm an IBM believer
"This is what happens to a company when you go all in on gender! Ginny, never had what it took and put more emphasis on “inclusion” than basic business judgement.Board never grew a pair to challenge her and now we pick up the pieces. I feel sorry for the current employees."

Definitely something different about IBM this time going up. Might take a month or 2 but it'll break 140. Might break 150 by the end of the year. Best of luck to us loooooooooongs

Fake premarket red for AMD as usual. More and more will realize AMD is golden as $ibm has pulled 2020 outlook and no Q2 guidance while $intc and $nvda previously guided flat or small decline in 2020 vs 30% gain guidance by AMD. Now Intel and nVidia will have to guide revenues down by 20-30% as AMD emerging as the absolute leader especially with the corona living!

"Gee, that whopping dividend is really holding the stock price up. NOT! Guess there's growing suspicion that the dividend is not safe. And why would it be at this point? No growth, mounting debt with interest rates climbing, splitting the company in 2, failed leadership - it's the perfect storm."

anyone else buying today? I said I would if it got to the high 140s
The way that IBM lost ground on Cloud to Amazon and Microsoft is a clear indication of how incompetent Ginni Rometty really is... Previous not-so-competent IBM CEO's were fired in a very expedient manner.. What is the story here?

the only think that IBM is better than everyone else is financial reporting jerrymandering

ibm going to 200 easy peasy
Hopium is addicting.Wears off quick.Will finish in the red today
"IBM, a once quasi monopoly is reduced to a nonentity, pursuing the fadsdeveloped by successful companies....and the latest price action shows it hasfinally started circling the drain. True, much of its debt is from financing itscustomers, but with falling revenues, bankruptcy is a sign on the horizon. This will be an example in business schools re how, at least in technology, a CEOshould understand the business, and politically correct hiring and promotion needs be kept under check."
IBM is the place to be as the Democrats use their final desperate scheme to defeat Trump. AMZN is largely opened by Bezos who bought the New York Post to try to defeat Frump and is now using the stock market in a final desperate effort to do what they did in 1929 to Hoover. I expect it to fail and IBM with its' low P/E ratio will be a winner along with Trump.

"I been adding ibm as it came lower, I know it’s been under pressure, It’s a $150 stock masquerading @ the low $120s"
The only sector IBM is dominate in is Financial Services. One hiccup in that sector will tank IBM's revenue and stock value.
"The new CEO for IBM is indeed great news. With a trailing PE of 13.6, and a price to sales ratio of only 1.6, and a 4.74% current dividend yield well supported by real profit , with some decent management at the CEO level hopefully soon evidenced by a quarter or two of respectable growth revenue and earnings growth, should IMHO justify at least a doubling in the share price of IBM."
Are there any other tech companies without a single tech guy on the board of directors other than IBM? Asking for a friend

Think about it. .. $ibm paid $34B for Redhat cash talking lots of debt. AMD gives shares to Xilinx no debt.Do you really think ibm will do more out of Redhat than AzmD with Xilinx? Lol not even comparable!
"Holding IBM now a little over a year, down from my $134 purchase price, a little more time to see if it comes back up."
Up to almost new high for no good reasons “IBM stock falls after earnings miss“
Have the analysts looked at revenue in constant currency? Have they also seen a slowing in growth of RedHat sales. IBM is not out of the woods here by any means.
Something went wrong here
IBM Had a bad Ceo for many years. Now we have a good one imo. In a couple of years when IBM earnings are over imo 13 a share. We get close to 200 a share. Small dividend raises along the way. All about getting the virus under control. 60 percent of revenue reoccurring.Management is honest and answers all questions.
Ibm has dropped around 8% after hours! I don't think it will drop any further! I don't think ibm has dropped more than 8% in a day!
$121 IBM looks like dead money :) hello $130+ bagholders
"Does anyone know if IBM Security gets folded into Cloud? What about Maximo, Tririga and ALM? There are still lots of on premise software products at IBM. Are they staying with IBM - going to Kyndryl or being divested?"
Holding above $140 like a TANK.
Reminds me of Carly Fiorina buying Compaq before she ran HP into the ground.
"I was seriously contemplating getting rid of my investment in $IBM after it reported dismal earnings (Cloud and Cognitive reported a decline in revenues of 4.5%) couple of weeks ago.Last night, I read an article heading “IBM CEO Arvind Krishna Appoints New Ecosystems Chief To Accelerate Hybrid Cloud-AI Sales Offensive”. The article has laid out many positive changes being implemented at IBM, for instance, “IBM set to invest $1 billion to “rapidly” expand its cloud ecosystem.” There’s a lot more information. Check it out yourself.As a long term investor, I don’t expect any miracles and am of the view that it might take a few quarters for IBM to discard the old culture. I believe that the spin off of “NewCo” will catalyze that.Taking a long term outlook over 2-3 years, I don’t see why IBM’s stock wouldn’t be valued at 35-40 times the earnings. However, I will be closely watching the next few quarters to see if they’re on the right track."
CEO MUST GO.
Again thx for the cheap shares. IBM's margin improvement is key to better days ahead.
I’m out at 160
"IBM 6 month chart show, fill gap to 121 range. Never Chase a stock"
"If you are an IBM long, this coming earnings call is going to be very important. Having more than half a year into the new management, by now the so called new management effectiveness and trend should show itself in the revenue . As an IBM shareholder , I want to see net revenue growth , It is not just the cloud, but overall when added up."
Correction...45%
"IBM math is simple on Redhat. RHT makes almost 4 billions a year with its limited distribution channels plus cash on balance sheet. IBM can scale it globally and close 5 times the deals a year easily with its army of salesman/online govt, banks, insurance distribution channels. That is 20 billions already. Using before tax dollars of 30 billions to buy RHT, after tax, RHT sales can be paid for in 1 year by itself. Not to mentioned that IBM has issued hit"
the end of the world is here! IBM is leading the market.
IBM is bloated with middle management that adds little value to any products IBM develops IBM strength is in its technical organizations Witcher being neutered in favor of more middle management IBM needs to flatten the management structure to no more than three levels and put those managers either back to work in the technical ranks or leave them off instead of the people who actually produce product
3 times average volume traded today and IBM was flat. This is what accumulation looks like. Standard Wall Street games. Big Blue is going up.
The market is bubbling. All these favorable posts on big blue? One decent report out of 23.
"IBM has become a non-factor, like a rudderless ship adrift in the middle of the ocean, Their competitors aren't scared about what IBM is doing or might do in the future, and they can easily outmaneuver whatever IBM does. The only people that should be scared are its stockholders, its employees, and any employees of future acquisitions since one of the few ways IBM manages to stay afloat by continually downsizing itself."
Buying more at close 115. Long term hold. Lets give the new CEO some time to turn the mess around.
Chart readers should LOVE IBM today. Charts don't lie RIGHT???
In the past 30 days IBM has announced numerous working agreements with other companies and a couple of takeovers of other smaller companies. I think this shows they are on the right track for the future. They are planting the seeds for future success.
"Democrats are proposing massive tax hikes. ALL of them will impact you, your family and your future. Read up on what they propose. here are a few. 1. TAX on corporations 35 to 40% TWICE what it is now. 2. Tax on trading. So each time YOU trade a stock your TAXED on the transaction. 3. Capital gains raise to 25% min to 37% max. so at a minimum 25% of your gain goes to democrat scams. 4 Payroll tax increase so you will take home less so democrats can pay people NOT TO WORK! SEER INSANITY! 5. Proposed national sales tax or a vat tax on goods produced. So bottom line is... It doenst pay any longer to work hard, be successful because what you earn will be taken by the GOVT. They know better than you HOW it needs to be redistributed. Dont they? A ahnd up for people is one thing, a hand OUT is another. Socialism doesn't work!!!"
IBM system z encrypted is the winner than any other companies. it will up trend in next 3 to 4years
this will be 200 by jan 2019
Perhaps this after hours sell off is a clear message to IBM’s CEO that mere words expressing confidence aren’t sufficient and that IBM will have to demonstrate performance if it is to be taken seriously. No excuses. Time to deliver.
I guess ATT didn’t get the memo that IBM’s going out of business.
All of the crystal ball prognosticators disparaging IBM as an investment need to #$%$. Big Blue ain't going nowhere but higher. It'll never be a GOOG or AMZN or AAPL. What it will be is a safe place for cash with a great dividend. Their B2B footprint is awesome and growth will come.
In 1 year will be trading at $145.
Board just declared a dividend of 1.63 per share payable 9.10. Its the only reason to hold this dog. VOTE BOD OUT at the next election.
Sell short now
"Flatten the middle management structure. Lay them off like they did to so many others. These do nothings dont add any value, just cost to products. In fact they hurt . Use those slots for tech talent IBM threw away under Gin Bottle Ginny!"
IBM reached a 52 Week high at 154.48
Insiders are loading up on IBM.
When is the dividend date? Would like to buy another 1000 before that to capitalize on the dividend. Already holding 3000 shares now.
I’m sorry to give you the real
Sell and buy MSFT tonight. It’s everything IBM isn’t and it pure profit and growth.Poor leadership and no vision at IBM
What’s going on today?
UPWARD ACTION ...
"No, no, not today. Up we go again! Buy."
"Why is IBM making such an issue out of this diversity officer going to MSFT, the IBM diversity algorithm is very well known, not really a big secret1. If woman then promote2: If woman and belonging to minority then double promote3. If man belonging to minority then tolerate4. If man not belonging to minority then ignore5. If white man over 40 then fire"
Stock anticipating another disappointing earnings. Same #$%$ different quarter. Some things NEVER change.And the name of the new company is laughable. How many millions did they waste coming up with that!!?
"So they will split, and then what? Drop in price today is the disappointment from the CC, no guidance, no vision, all questions were evaded with fluffy answers. They really don't have a clue anymore. And don't forget the new CEO is the same person that led the IBM cloud to great heights in his previous job. In 10 years time newco or whatever it will be called will be a small company selling power and mainframe products to enthusiasts and hobbyists."
what happened here?? I thought this finally was going to fly
"140-155 was ,indeed, a gift."
58% held by INSTITUTIONS. Very low number
IBM is the new Sears. Can't figure out what to sell.
Looks like IBM on right track!
Bullrun resume! Let's gooooooooooo!
amazon is eating their lunch. soon they will have nothing left.
nothing changes with only Gini leaving.. the entire C suite has to go
Whats the case for IBM over MSFT over next 5 years ?
"PAYDAY! IBM growing again! Red Hat revenue, up 24 percent IBM will DOUBLE form here! BOOM!"
"We have a government that is waging war on energy. This will not only hurt the energy industry but all those that use a lot of energy to produce goods for all of us. Gas prices are going way up from here. Industries like Steel, Aluminium, rubber, glass, plastics and others will see costs go way up. Not good folk, not good at all."
One more mess up and IBM will be worth $25. A generous evaluation for companies that see no growth. Even telecom has seen more growth than IBM. The only thing keeping this up is its credit. A credit downgrade will make sure that the dividend is meaningless.
News release on new management and the whole thing goes up. This is dragging the whole market today due to its weighting on the DOW and S&P.
I think Warren Buffet may come back and buy out IBM as it is gaining traction
Strange how the BOD has seen the SP drop from $196.00 in 2012 to a present SP of $132.00 and no one has been held accountable. CEO needs to go as well as the present BOD.
Great she's gone but they should have selected an outsider. IBM needs new outside vision.
The downside here is limited but probably so is the upside until the next few quarters... I would say $145- $160 trading range so if it gets to the lower end its probably a buy and for someone whose in just hold it and wait for fruition
"Yay finally. ..lol $ibm ER set a 1% revenues increase vs the quarter a year ago! Ha! That's while all true cloud companies show revenues increasing through the roof high under corona life at home. And... ibm's shares jump on this blip citing a comeback. Please. ..that's noise. Want to see revenues growth? AMD guided 37% revenues growth this year while analysts see it going to 50%+ .. that's growth. 1% squeezing out as ""growth"" is a failure a blind squirrel happened to find a nut. LOL"
will fast talking dunderhead Rometty still be ceo in 1 year?
Anyone think Apple can buy IBM for the cloud business
It’s a real sign of the irrationality of markets when a company beats EPS by 28 cents/share and the stock plummets.
"Fellow bagholders, let's hope 2021 our loss on IBM shares is less than 15% ."
"A few colleagues used to work with were let go sept 1st. I didnt ask how many were let go but given the state of the 23% annual losses IBM has had, I expect their jobs went to cheaper labor markets or eliminated."
At least the new CEO's performance is consistent. He failed when he was leading their cloud division and he's failing again as CEO. All who thought he would suddenly see the light by making him a CEO have by this been proven dead wrong.
CEO sure has a lot of suggestions on how other companies should hire and run their business....been an investor for 2 years now and totally frustrated....leadership very much like Lucent Technologies and GE...I experienced both - not a good sign
"IBM is a company that stifles innovation in the private sector, especially when it threatens its monopoly position in the lucrative mainframe business (a declining market, but an extremely important one). Take a look at IBM's strategy of capture-and-kill when someone built an emulator that runs z/OS mainframe software: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/26/ibm_turbohercules_response/"
It’s that a short bus I see off in the distance
Maybe the play here is XLM (stellar lumens ) for blockchain.
"IS anyone in IBM in the range of 124 to 131 level,,, besides me,,"
The BOD got it half right by firing their PC hire but not promoting Whitehurst to CEO will prove to be a huge mistake! Just because JW hasn't been with IBM long enough doesn't mean he's not the right person for the job. In fact fresh blood with a new perspective is what IBM needs to grow. Learn from MSFT! Vote out the IBM BOD!!!
I did my part. I voted against ALL board directors. This is how you get them out. Do your part. Way too old and clubby.
"Ginny should have a 'PINK' parachute, instead of a 'GOLDEN' Parachute, to share the color she has given to many of her US based employees!"
Coming up on the inside rail it's IBM
IBM - NVIDIA have collaborated and delivered the supercomputer to take over #1 spot.This is going back to $160 in short order.
AMD is the new ibm...
"I have seen for the last year many posters calling for ginny to be fired, I didn't exactly understand why. now having a large position for the last 6 months in high 140s I understand why. after 6 years, to do nothing to grow the stock or company in any way how does she still have a job?"
How often does Buffett unload a LARGE position? Maybe he knew something we didn't.
"I got my dividends today from IBM, xom, and CVX. I'm happy"
finally at just above breakeven
"I cannot believe that IBM is only worth 2 Workday shares. If IBM just single out 5 products, let them fly like Workday, or any other high flying software, the values of anyone of them will scale quickly and be reflected. IBM is too too undervalued. Let build a share model, and let each unit sell and scale, it will be at least 400 billions company. Buy more shares for now."
@Jack - Just please go check the 52 weeks highs and current pps and you'll see percentage wise AMD is leading today over all these techs in some cases by a lot! $mu $tsla $nvda $ibm $intc even $huya which is deep red today though it's a different segment.
"Why isn't it OBVIOUS that Krishna, another long time IBMer, LACKS any vision. The board first hires Rometty and the PC hire killed IBM for 10 years plus; now the BOD hires yet ANOTHER PC hire thinking this guys is gonna turn IBM around like Nadella did for MSFT ... it ain't gonna happen. The CEO that the IBM bod needs to put in place is Jim Whitehurst, period, end of story!!! Spinning off the legacy business isn't gonna do a thing but give shareholders TWO poorly managed companies!!!"
"The BOD's job is not to indulge top management in their hopefully sincere but obviously incompetent efforts to managethis company, but to do their fiduciary duty to stockholders...this plainly and far past due (Palmisano, Rometty) is to do a though housecleaning of the top three or more layers of management."
Next few quarters will show how much damage Rometty really has done.
Nice IBM. My calls are soaring.
IBM should join intel in the big old Megacorps with crusted management layers as value traps of the Dow. They die a slow death. New highs are later becoming new lows.
I like ibm now since the shake up. I may buy more .you cannot beat the div
SHOULD CLOSE AT $124 TODAY WATCH NEWS
Palantir ... isn’t that the company that post 1b losses over 0.3b revenue !!!
Alen would do good on the $mnkd board
"This is not a growth company , take the dividend and wait for a good time to cash out"
"Stock will jump 10 points when Ginny is replaces or the board is. Since she is still in the CEO seat, I suppose most people voted to keep her and the BOD in place. If you didnt vote your proxy, thats on you."
Don't even SPEAK-BREATH seldom-when it gets to 130S OPEN WINDOWS AND SCREAM.
Selling ahead of earnings next week - not a good sign.
"If they stop paying the dividend they free up almost $5 billion per year in cash. They can accelerate the restructure, retire out the managers that don't fit the company's future, and complete the spinoff. The window to succeed is small. Either become a modern company or die."
Go
"After acquiring CA, Broadcom can acquire IBM next.... same reasoning Ho Tang cited before in acquiring CA - the pretiable cash, security expertise, software base. Once IBM splits, it will be even more attractive to diverse sets of acquirers."
"The pencil neck accountants in IBM convinced the board to offshore support structures and development which on the surface looks good because of the reduced labor costs. However any REAL savings are unrealized because of all the rework, missed time lines and arrogance of the board that laid off a competent US workforce that got their heads cutoff to save pennies. Now IBM mismanagement at the middle manager level, which do nothing except worry about their bonus, is the root of market share losses."
ibm the sears of tech stocks same price as it was in feb 0f 2010
A quiet move from $IBM; replaces CFO ! http://alph.st/b6c9bda0
Has anyone heard that IBM might be buying namaste technology well shares in the company ??
$185 soon:IBM is the only of a few chip stocks undervalued in this market condition.
120’s?? Wow.
"IBM business is staled, accounting methods are utilized to sure up profits."
BOD DO YOUR JOB! OR resign from the board.
Warren Buffet was right about IBM. He sees no organic growth as this company will continue to search for other companies to buy and markets to get into. imho
"Until some huge name announces that they believe in the management story and have built a considerable position in IBM, it’s gonna continue to be ugly. I have to give this a couple more quarters, especially considering how the pandemic threw everything into chaos. Ginny was the most destructive CEO in history. Her legacy is still keeping investors away. Hey, maybe it’s time to make the RedHat CEO, IBM CEO and get rid of the IBM lifer running it now."
IBM is the Tech leader. #1 in technology.

"When Imelt took over at GE 10 years ago, the stock went from 103 to less than 5 a share. Now trades at a rate so low, A lot of mutual funds wont buy it. Massive debt and Imelt left GE with a golden parachute after the BOD FINALLY took action to remove him. It has yet to recover and hold 10 a share. Rometty is IBM's Imelt! BOD TAKE ACTION OR RESIGN!"
I had posted a message on this board about 7 years ago where I said that IBM is better off buying up new promising technologies instead of buying its own stock. Turns out that would have been the right move.
"Another non-tech exec. Remember how Lou Gerstner, Sam, Ginny destroyed IBM innovations. If you are a tech company, get a tech exec. IBM is digging its hole. As an old company which pays a lot of dividends and huge debt, IBM stakeholders are people who are getting older and poorer. No new blood, no fresh money, no growth."
i don't think jesus himself would have the patience to hold this stock anymore
IBM is up 4.92% to 139.67
$1.84 per share versus estimate of $1.79. Looking forward to tuning into the webinar in an hour.
when is dividend??
great volume for this time of day. Might get a new 52 week high today 
IBM is a great company and has a very successful performance in the market place. Is this company perfect? No but it’s well respected and will survive this temporary small blip in its long history.Traders are moving the stock price around right now however with some smart management changes and positive moves in the business plan we will move into the future with great results
Started from the bottom now we're here
"THE NEW CONTRACT, PLUS EPS WILL MAKE THIS STOCK A GREAT STARTING TOMORROW"
"We need a Gertsner tough as nails type CEO to replace Ginny, who is not technical enough and thinks social justice inclusion in the workplace is the panacea for profit and growth. That 7 year experiment has failed and the board is complicit! I’m tired of the mañana syndrome!!!!"
Is BIG BLUE ready to POP I say long and strong!
23 million shares buy back NOT bad.
Red Hat was acquired July 9. This is half way through their third quarter. IBM did not receive all the revenue from Red Hat in their just released earnings report. How was this divided? Does this affect the increase in IBM revenue/earnings?
I got in about a month ago thinking this was a good company. up a little today but I have lost $$. dividend doesn't mean much if stock goes down. should I cut and run?

maybe we can see green tomorrow..
"Dear BOD,If you want to see change in IBM then fire Ginny."
Five years ago IBM was $191.67 a share. I could have put $191.60 in a box five years ago. Every year I could pull the 5% dividend out of the box. Today there would still be $148.26 in the box. So I could have put my money in a box on the shelf and beat IBM by $13 per share! Enjoying the high tech ride?
"IBM is range bound (with negative bias) just waiting for earnings/PR. The only think keeping stock up is that both Dow 30 and S&P 500 Index funds have to buy it. At $111, they will fall below $100M market cap which happened briefly in March and at the end of 2019.. No action here for the foreseeable future as short interest is 2.5%. Lots of smart peeps work there but waiting to buy after the market absorbs the next stimulus and cracks this summer.At lease GR has been moved aside.Good luck to all."
"Great progress being made on the hybrid cloud, quantum computer and block chain. Stock potential is strong once cloud growth has accelerated some more. The big revenue for all comes from the cloud."
"Important after IBM's ER today, AMD jumping as IBM will announce historic partnership with AMD for cloud and using EPYC-Powered datacenter and AMD's GPUs for Azi. This dumps $nvda and $intc. I believe that $ibm will jump if they announce that. No other way to answer this article's concerns and other such. It's guidance for 2020 and vision. Cannot stay with Intel and nVidia as I've explained. Power processors gain too from AMD's new GPUs. Remember hedge your portfolio. IBM must show restless investors that its cloud strategy is workinghttps://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/investing/ibm-earnings-preview/index.html"
When was the last time IBM had a visionary in the CEO office?
This should be an 80 dollar stock. It should be trading at 1x sales max until it has a growth story to tell.
"Investors patience runs out With ibm soon under 100 per share imo.,"
the right moves were those who bought at 117. I predict IBM will surpass 128 before March 2019.jg
Lets watch $ibm mainly their ER call at 5.30pm for amd's hints. Results aren't great if i have to guess revenues down. Pps may sink. New CEO doesn’t matter.
Do shareholder has an option to vote?
IBM is a buy. This is becoming a very good cloud company with price competitiveness
Added today. In a few years 180 imo.
I sold my entire IBM shares at $200 few years ago and glad I made the right decision..
"we shareholders need REDHAT CEO NOW, NOW NOW, stock would jump $75 if REDHAT mgmt. steppe into the ceo office"
Stay calm. IBM will regain $$ and move forward and upward in short term.jg
"Arvind needs to show he is not beholden to the past policies of Ginny Rometty if he truly seeks change at IBM. As an IBM shareholder and employee I call on IBM to completely remove Ginny from IBM activity. I will share a personal story about Ginny that makes it clear she needs to go. Ginny gave her last broadcast to IBM via ""Zoom"" meeting from the family room/library of her personal home. Even her spouse made a brief appearance which validated it was her home. The background of the zoom call was broadcast from a walnut paneled library and above thee fireplace mantel was an original Audubon oil painting framed by two large antique Chinese urns like one would see in a museum. It was shocking to me that Ginny would flaunt her wealth after nearly a decade of layoffs on the backs of HER poor management decisions (Spending billions on Watson Health, Ignoring applications in the cloud when acquisitions of SaaS companies would have mattered, screwing customers by selling off software assets instead of evolving some of them into cloud based solutions and an evolutionary path for customers etc...). Ginny was indifferent to the remaining workers by flaunting her wealth to employees who had not seem a decent raise for years under her tenure. She was essentially laughing at all of us all the way to the bank! She needs to go! The culture at IBM of Queen Bees with VP and SVP titles is Ginny's legacy at IBM. The Queen Bees remain in this top heavy management structure. It is time to remove Ginny completely to break from this terrible past and cut the management bloat - start with VP and SVP MBAs with no technical degrees or experience outside IBM itself. Maybe Ginny gets to live like a queen but she should receive no further trappings from IBM as a spokesperson or otherwise. That would show Wall Street IBM has truly changed. But it has not."
IBM should ask WATSON how to make more money.
"IBM was once a colossus...the dominant force in computing. As such, it could attract the very besttech talent. No more...the pay and security is higher at various places in the Valley. Unfortunately,it now appears to have started a death spiral, or in other words circling the drain..Top managementis well compensated, and the diversity goals are as fashionable as required...but the company maynot be around in a few years...perhaps swallowed by the likes of Apple or Microsoft...mainframes andthe Z operating system are still highly important for business transactions."
"It is my opinion that the combined revenue of $MSFT and $IBM will exceed that of AMZN and GOOG in 3-4 years or less. MSFT will be likely be the revenue leader and IBM will likely have unparalleled operating margins from its niche of Hybrid cloud, Quantum computing and Cybersecurity."
Looking good will continue to add at any dips currently holding only 400 shares
This stock by end of week will be $138.00 or more. By the end of June it will be $144.00 or more. Today it’s taking a break before heading towards $145.00
"Ii had to jump in at 139.50. Dividend and future was too good to pass. BUT, it will take patience. I have a 3-5 year windows. For now, I'll take the 4.4% dividend.. better than .5% at the bank and that will probably go lower with rate cuts.."
"They always beat on earnings, that is the most manipulative figure & IBM is the master in financial engineering.question is how did they do on revenue"
Rometty should be a professor not CEO. She loves to talk but does not accomplish anything. Perfect professor.
Perfect buying opportunity wait another day to see how it goes
After earning release you will see a $10 point pop upward
you have to remember that the recent earnings are a product of ibm's greatest asset and biggest cheaters on planet earth......ibm's accountants.....any other company would have probably reported a loss
"Biden vs Trump = GE vs IBM.Too old for me to really care about, yet they keep on fighting like the world depends on them"
The sleeping giant will awaken when ceo goes
"THE IBM dividend is about equal to the stock decline this year......this poor company just doesnt know what to spin off, how to make money with its overbloated staff and with most employees now in china,isn't even an american company other than in name.....Amazon just was said to be superior in cloud computing and IBM is planning to spend a ton of money just to catch up........ I dumpted IBM and put my money into Microsoft and have been rewarded .....Anyone hoping that the 5% dividend is a plus should just check each years price for the past 15 years, the era of Gina R........down the road, IBM is a has been, a Lucent type company which also had a woman destroy it over her time as head......i can only think of Occidental oil which also put a woman in charge and just follow what happened when she pushed for the purchase of anadarko oil......The stock plunged far more than the other oils and has lost its once cherished dividend, almost completely.......the company is a shell of what it once was, similar to IBM......."
What were they thinking ? I mean the only way I can think of it is that they wanted to be heard so they paid to make it on the news other than that it’s waste of money for such a company of that size

"IBM Awarded Patent for Secure System Based on Blockchain2423Total views219Total sharesListen to article1:50￼NEWSTech conglomerate IBM has recently been awarded a patent for a blockchain-based secure system. The patent filing was published on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website Tuesday, October 2.As IMB explains in a document first filed in September 2017, the technology enables the detection of security breaches within a network by connecting all the monitors to a chain configuration, which registers all events in the network. This, in turn, might help to prevent different sorts of hacks.According to a detailed explanation provided by IBM, a monitor can be easily intruded upon in a regular system as ""none of the devices know about each other,"" and hackers can “clean up” past events to gain control.However, within a blockchain security system, a hacked monitor can be found immediately, as in such a case synchronised monitors won't have consensus. ""If the information received for a specific event or transaction differs, then one monitor may have been compromised,"" the filing explains.The use of blockchain technology in monitor systems will therefore help create “a less vulnerable” network and provide more security, IMB states.IBM shares first place globally with Chinese e-commerce corporation Alibaba in terms of blockchain-related patents filed. As a per recent report by intellectual property outlet iPR Daily, Alibaba has registered 90 patents, while IBM follows behind with as many as 89 patents. For instance, in mid-September, IBM filed another blockchain patent in the security area. As Cointelegraph wrote, the patent application was related to privacy rules for drones in case of high risks.Later in September, IBM was awarded a patent for the autonomous self-servicing of networked devices that form part of its Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry (ADEPT) environment."

"#IBM Volume is good. P/E: 8.62, Dividend 5.429."
The two companies. One is IT and the other is cloud company that worth about 100B with PE of 15. The PE for cloud company should be adjusted to its competitor like MSFT that has PE of 36. On this basis IBM should be traded north of 200.
Apple trailing pretax inc lower than 2015 peak (though higher on per share basis thanks to $100+ billion share buyback). My view: long term health of company impaired by focus on financial engineering (aka returning cash to shareholders). $IBM bought a ton of its stock in 90s..
IBM Filed Patent for a Blockchain Database Management System may provide the needed foundational piece for blockchain to take off
"Ibm will drop tomorrow, just like every company that buys another one which is normal. It will go up again soon after. The Company might know something we don’t and I mean none of us know IBM like the company knows itself. There is a reason we all have invested in this company because we trust it. If you don’t know anything about ibm and invested in it then you are just dumb. Ibm is one of the companies that if there is recession tmw I wouldn’t be worried."
IBM is a 56% BUY. Check it out on Barchart...https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/IBM/opinion
IBM stock is down over $100 since Giiny took over yet she has made hundreds of millions.How can she keep the CEO job?Maybe we should launch a class action suit against her and the board. The have cost shareholders $100 Billion during the period.Enough is enough!
Dividend 1.63 just posted
when do we vote to approve or disapprove rht deal?
"On CNBC, Weiss hates IBM, which makes this stock a ""screaming buy""!!!! That guy has been a very accurate reverse barometer for my stock trades over the last two years. I love this guy!!!!! Whoo hooo!!!!"
Rolling over! Will pause at 115 until the next leg lower. IBM can't buy its own stock for support.
DnB Norway bank LOST a lot last July investing in IBam. Actually it sold Intel lol didn't buy AMD. Now they keep making bad moves. I wonder if it's a manipulation of its private banking customers? Yes in Norway too. Read their past credentials - would you trust them with your money to handle $amd $intc $nvda and $mu or $ibm? Me not thinking so...https://www.barrons.com/articles/big-stock-buys-in-ibm-lilly-by-norways-biggest-bank-1531308601
Gentlemen......I saw glory days of IBM....1980 thru @1985..annual revenue growth exceeded the entire gross sales of #2 computer co (Digital Equip Co)……...then the president retired and a sales exec put in charge......that was the start of progressive disaster...…..till now......if you are smart ...do some research.....see the light.....get out now......
The services this company provides cost a lot to maintain. It's eating at their share price.
"has fast talking dunderhead Rometty had anything to say on tv today/recently????...as in ""just wait for red hat profit contribution !!!!!!""....."
Buy the lights out below$120. Margin improvement equals sound mgmt now in charge.
thinking 5 to 7 years out do I buy here and hold?
"Showed increase in revenue, missed full year expectations, muddied the statement with tax charges - no talk of mainframe sales and future guidance.. if the CC does not go well - time for Ginny Rometty to go. 7 years of same old"
"NVDA's p/e of 93 and their revenue & earnings still a fraction of IBM's is just another example of ""momo stocks gone wild"". AAPL at a $2.1T valuation, adding $1T of valuation in 4 months? AAPL gaining the entire valuation of IBM in just one day (Friday)? Are you kidding me?! This insanity ends badly. One can only hope that IBM's depressed valuation attracts the right kind of attention during the coming market beatdown."
just read IBM has developed a new batter. Great news for stock.
Too tantalizing. I had to sell out on some of my holdings to scoop ups some shares at these prices
"down to $100 in no time. Split up wont be done until late 2021, revenue won't be backed up until mid 2022 at the very best. Redhat employees will start to cash out and move at that point. IBM is in a very difficult situation. the recent acquisitions are all about consulting and that is disappointing, they just try to milk redhat instead of developing it further."
"ibm got way oversold,it has growth in its clowd and it business where all tech companies want to be but ibm is leading,every quarter going forward it will be better"
IBM will go to $200 in 2021 before the spin-off. You will see.
VOTE your shares at the next meeting to remove the BOD. They have failed in their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders while lining their pockets and retaining Rometty and her millions in salary and stock.
News Friday
"Ah ha, Market downed yesterday, IBM downed that understandable, today Market ups like crazy, IBM still down. So the question is when IBM will be up? NEVER!"
"01/21/2021, IBM shares, after all the rosy comments (placing a price target of $140-$145 per share) from the ""professionals"" during normal trading hours, take a tumble to $123.75 in after hours trading. Nothing new. Nothing to see here. Move on folks."
"I am watching Ginny speaking at Davos and I am laughing my #$%$ off. She said IBM is a company of the future. Weeeellll. This wonderful company was trading at 120 in 2009 and at 137 in 1999.Maybe she is right. Maybe IBM is a company of the future. Maybe they are doing great things in their laboratories. But for an investor this is one of the worst companies to own. Dead money. Zero growth. They do pay good dividend, but there are plenty of other companies out there that offer both good dividend and growth."
"On Wednesday, Argus upgraded IBM stock from hold to buy and gave it a $155 price target. Argus analyst Jim Kelleher sees IBM's hybrid cloud business accelerating, driven by the $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat.

IBM recently gutted Blockchain efforts and now selling off Watson Health. How can this be good news and good for the stock?
To the moon!
IBM has a fine Dividend Yield. But can you imagine that you have stocks at NYSE with a Dividend Yield of 15%? Thanks to Corona: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XIN?p=XIN
New CEO and Cloud/growth and away from legacy will power IBM higher...stay the course
Well shorts you win ...we longs are toast for good
IBM playing catch-up fast.
"If you are short, stand aside, there is a technology train coming you're way. Blockchain and cloud services will power this train, so you can get on and take the ride, you can stand aside and watch it power . but please don't stand in front of it with short positions, because you will get run over.............. who else will CEO's go to for blockchain help? IBM is well positioned to capture the wave and power forward"

"Red Hat will save the day over time-7-20 will see the growth in cloud and guidance,"
IBM to 200
Good time to buy- stock going to 150 in 6 months. plus a great d yield.
This will return back to the mid 130's again. I have seen this many times with $IBM. This isn't going anywhere.
"IBM way up when Jenny announced her long-overdue departure; IBM way up today on the 1st Q results after her departure. A lost decade for investors under her mis-management. The storm has passed, finally! Her and Trump together will soon have plenty of golf-time."
I'll pay IBM $500 to upgrade my PowerMac G5 processor to this year's model. You need the business. You arren't competitive with new x86 processors. Your service is expensive but bad. Here is something you can do.
WOW $NVDA IN FREE FALL! This soon will be under $100. Remember how analysts pumped it as high as $350-370 just couple months ago? Micron $mu isn't far behind. .. $intc on the way too... not talking about $tsla silver gold bitcoins. .. AMD will emerge from all this as a new leader. Old tech like $ibm may shrink significantly.
Just closed my short position in IBM up 32%. I am now joining the longs and hoping for the stock to be pumped up post-ER later this month to create an entry point for a new short position.
Is Ginni on the bubble yet? I thought she was doing a good job but the results speak otherwise. I have a long and pull put strategy in the stock and owned it for decades. We need a kicker to get it going again. They need to monetize their technologies better. They have a lot of IP.
this is a great buy once the dust settles
"IBM cloud business, is worth 300 billion! going higher!"
Sold my IBM at 180 last time. Like Buffett did. Just saying a 62% Premium for red hat. Are you kidding me!....lol
IBM has CEO problem. She talks like a book but nobody listens. Only a new CEO could shake up this great company.
ER aside. IBM is the most rationally valued tech company...by far.
IBM has all the advantages to be #1 in cloud services.
"""IBM secured $20 billion through the sale of bonds to fund the Red Hat acquisition. The bond sale raised IBM’s total debt to over $60 billion. The company has decided to slow the pace of its share buybacks in the next two years to pay off its debt."""
Sold more portfolio to buy more IBM. Dividend announcement next week. I'll take 5% yield
CEO PLS leave
Plunge tomorrow. Ibm still not considered a tech company !
Ouch. Even I didn't see $114 coming.
"Long term owner. Only 150 shares. Played golf Thursday, had a few beers, got home and bought another 200. Friday was fun (my timing is rarely this good).

"IBM top heavy with management at the expense of technical expertise. Middle management ranks are bloated with Barnacles hanging on to a ship slowing it down in the water. A LOT of accountants telling managers to move stuff off shore, US to expensive. BAD MOVE!"
"Like I said, up we go!"
"Mr. Krishna the best thing you can do is to FLATTEN the org structure. IBM is BLOATED with middle managers who do nothing but add cost and produce little. Lay them off and hire tech talent back so that IBM can push into the future and compete with Amazon, MSFT and Google."
IBM today announced it received the corporate “Most Woke” ex CEO award - given to the company run by a female CEO with the worst revenue decline over a 10 year period. The award in the form of a $4.2M bonus comes with a middle finger pointed at all ex employees who received no bonuses during her tenure.
Congrats. Dividend does NOT cover stock loss
Imagine what will happen to IBM's share price when the market tanks again.
"IBM's core business has posted declining sales in nine of the past 10 quarters. During an investor call in January, Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said that he was confident in the company’s focus on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. Echos of the rometty rose colored glasses."
Is IBM the next GE?
IBM never fell below $110 because anyone doubted their Free Cash Flow and such.It fell so far because the CEO is paying way too much for Red Hat. WAY TOO MUCH!Has that changed?
no more selling of buffet holding thank god !!! And no more control from that hypocite
Definitely different this time around
This morning's bounce is quickly dissipating. The excitement over earnings was very short lived.
"Well $ibm longs . . Congratulations! Partnering with AMD in a very deep way, will win the ""hybrid cloud""... well done!"
"When its comes to adopt new disruptive technologies, MSFT, CRAY, GOOG, AMZN, TWTR and others move like a gazelle faster while IBM move like a snail with the wrong partners (El Capitan) perfect example of leadership failrule...……."
"this is getting old,, the only thing IBM has is a Dividend, no one wants to buy this stock anymore, this stock should have seen 160 with the DOW run , just based on the DOW run"
"They pre-announced earnings when they split off data company !! Please stop talking about surprises, really hard to surprise when you reconfirm only 3 weeks ago, that said the color they give on this split off asset is of huge interest to investors"
This stock is just sad. Sad.
"What IBM really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for IBM (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if IBM just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

I am guessing it gives back all yesterday's gains in a week.
Im told there is another june force reduction is going on....can anyone validate ?
OCT 16 - NOV 2nd is when Buffet was selling 17 million shares. OK he is WRONG but still has 37 million shares
"Good trading range. 120 looks clear, with all the news, i.e Moderna. IBM is gonna keep buying up others."
Earnings are going to be over $3.00 a share for the quarter reporting tomorrow. IBM shares will rise to $150 near term.
"All IBM Share Holders, I offer you tickets for the Titanic. IBM is listing now, unrecoverable, sinking faster now, oh my so many people hurt and dying. What a horrific sight... I can see share holders trying to hold on to a 4% dividend, but IBM is sinking faster and faster share value declining sharply, oh no, please help SOS"
"If the earnings are as bad as some expect (along with more decline in revenue), a silver lining may be that the BOD finally and at last boots rometty. A new CEO might actually revive the company, and for sure her leaving would boostthe shares. This would increase the value of her stock options. Perhaps taking this into account would make the BOD feel better about the move they should have taken years ago."
"What a #$%$ stock this is. Nasdaq is up more than 2%, yet this #$%$ is down negative"
"Missed Opportunity? CTFN reported earlier this month that Carbon Black hired Morgan Stanley to explore opportunities to sell itself. CTFN also reported that Cisco and IBM had expressed interest, according to Bloomberg.VMware today announced that it is acquiring Carbon Black, for about $2.1 billion. In addition, VMware also confirmed the acquisition of Pivotal, for about $2.7 billion. Both Pivotal and VMware are majority-owned subsidiaries of Dell."
37M shares today...that is not retail...
Lol what if IBM finishes up today?
Typical IBM. Investors have no faith with good reason. Cannot even hold up for more than one day.

Great day for IBM!!! Up a whole .07%!
Ouch!
"Have we breached 150, yet? Why not. "
Buffet hasn’t made any money from IBM. He’s been at a loss. Here is the history of his buying vs stock price: Warren Buffett Nearly Exits Entire IBM Stakehttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/warren-buffett-nearly-exits-entire-010626885.html
IBM has been really volatile for several weeks. Anyone understand or have a theory why? I have bought IBM initially at $140 and then again at $160. have been patient. But my patience is beginning to run thin. Next qtr needs to show continued improvement for sure.
It might be advisable to consider taking some off the table in the near future while/until the market figures out that IBM Cloud is a bigger disaster than WATSON
When does the talk of booting IBM from the DOW begin?
"Be patient, guys, if you have keeping track of IBM shares, you know your money and share of IBM is growing. 0.9395 in May 1st, 2017 0.93194 in Jul 20, 2017 0.92579 in Dec, 2017 0.91791 on May, 2018 EPS keep increase, dividend of 2 dollars increased to 6.xx in 10 years. Now transformation is completed, the revenue and earnings will increase in the next few quarters."
Maybe IBM will retest the 105+ low.
"IBM P/E is only 15 with S&P around 24, With new leadership and current dividend, when growth starts to increase, P/N could go to 20 easily be a 200+ P/S and still be cheaper than the S&P. I'ts a matter of time before more investors will realize its value. IMO."
The company is shrinking. The PE is too high. Price target is $100.
"I know it is frustrating that stock price is not moving up but let us do math , IBM forward PE is 10.42. IBM will be trading with lot high PE next year at least 15-16. Example with PE 16 next year stock price will be $224. It is certainly a buy opportunity for long term"
"Hail Mary full grace, pray for our investors now at the hour of certain demise"
"Bought IBM in the early 1990s, just after it went thru a protracted fall like the one it has suffered for the past few years. Split adjusted, I got it at $16/share ($62 back then). Dividends rose each year, so add that to the return. I think this dip is an opportunity."
IBM = GE IBM will be under 100 and removed from the dow soon imo..The days when no one got fired for choosing ibm are long over Now you might be fired for choosing ibmI do remember the good old days when smug looking men in blue suits would wander my companies halls telling my IT manager what he was going to purchase !
"Big Blue shall rise again! $200+ before the IBM / ""NewCo"" split in 2021."
trump administration could be reviewing IBM for cloud business! wow!
"If the stock closes about 146.08, it has taken out the 1st and 2nd Level Resistance points (according to the Cheat Sheet on Barchart). Nothing holding it down, if the resistance points are taken out. 150's are assured!"
Looks like heading to $150 before end of year!!
i am contractor for IBM and getting 95$ per hour. After 7 months passed my manager called me asked what is my name and said sorry it been long time as he said he was little busy ..
IBM can't rise in this mega market .it's a old irrelevant company. Microsoft takes over from here. IBM won't exist in 20 years from now.
In 2015 they were using Watson to identify older workers with more than 20 years with IBM and made over 90K per year. I expect they are still using it to thin the ranks of technical support here. That list was used to determine the thousands that were let go.
Held well.
IBM holds the key of cloud as all other vendors are using red hat. They will have to align to IBM and sales of Redhat will scale up. The sales of related products will position IBM as the leader in the pack. IBM is flexing its financial muscle as existing long term contract can fuel growth
"Question... does any feel as though this $IBM EPS beat will have a big impact on $AMD, tomorrow...$TSM had great EPS recently too... and $SNX as well...Instills a feeling of even more confidence going into $AMD’s EPS."
Next target is $130
"What IBM needs to do is buy nvidia, fire Ginny, and put Jensen Huang in charge. I own both nvidia and IBM, but nvidia seems to keep on hitting higher highs and higher lows, while IBM fluctuates within the price range"
Get ready for the pre-dividend rally
"Are the BOD doing their fiduciary duty to stockholders ? I'm sure they will give Rometty a big increase in compensation.She is well past IBM's traditional retirement age for executives, and still doing great damage to what was once the premiertech company."
Heading towards $140 +++ ??? .... every thing possible in corona Rally !!
"it's called inorganic growth. They have to look for other sources of revenue because, their existing business model is declining. imho"
"I shorted 143 put expiring next week. While premium is low, I would not regret to buy at this level.Cloud make more than 50% of revenue now and growing much faster. They are technology leader in many of cloud technology and while small/medium business move to AWS and AZURE, Big Corp unlikely moving large scale over public cloud(Unless they are technology company like Netflix where their main product already on Internet) IBM will do well for years to come even while I think public cloud will slowdown significantly soon."
"1 of the many problems with ibm is they sponsor the NFL and these other major sports companies. Sports companies don't care about IBM's technologies. They just need IBM's money. Stop sponsoring these major sports affiliates and take care of your house, IBM! Let's see if Amazon or Apple is willing to sponsor these pampered sports athletes"
Back to 140 on Monday. .hahahha
The unfortunate thing about this stock is the RedHat was a great company growing at a respectable rate. As its own unit RH could have easily lifted IBM out of it's doldrums all by itself by continuing to grow to trend and and providing cross selling solutions with other IBM units. All IBM had to not was not ruin RH with the acquisition.It might be the case that IBM is doing just that. But the post acquisition structuring of the company makes it impossible to know whether IBM has managed to keep the RH flywheel going during this critical period of transition. The balance sheet going forward will be totally opaque in that respect. That's a mistake and as a consequence it makes the stock much less attractive.
Vote the entire BOD out so we can get the CEO replaced
"pre mkt. tells the whole story, wake-up fellow shareholders we are in need of getting her out"
"IBM was $80 Billion in Revenues when I joined the company. Problem is that was 1981! I left in 1987 and glad I did. I know of no one looking to buy anything from IBM in the newer generation and or mid-range environment. Younger CIO's have never even met an IBMer. No reps are found anywhere in any accounts in my state, thus when cloud comes up younger CIOs call Amazon, Tierpoint etc. Maybe in another 37 years IBM will be at $80 billion again. Agree with all posts- Rommetty is time to go."
NO BETTER TIME THAN NOW....To BUY the DIPS........IBM....and AABB.
"Now even cloud is declining, Ginny is done with the fake cloud growth by reorg. Only redhat can help her ""grow"" cloud, but not for two long. Blue-wash takes like 2 years, everyone starts to forget Redhat, customers start to use other OS, and the name RedHat will be history.I'd short IBM now, and until Ginny leaves."
No support for IBM stock?What's the real problem with this once great great company?Any news anyone?
115 USD - 116 USD is maybe a good posible entry if you are looking to enter.The main thing that IBM got me attracted to look at their business is the Power 10.Currently IBM is on a decline.

IBM to the moon
I do not care how many patents IBM has and neither did Mr. Buffet. They are not developing and growing in this growing economy. Shame on the board and CEO.
"How many more heads will get ""chopped"" off at IBM so they make the wall street estimates? You can have all the revenue you want, but if your not making a profit, the numbers need to be boosted by something else."
"IBM Cloud was preparing since last year to reveal using AMD's EPYC Rome as disclosed last Sep by IBM. The details will be revealed in 1Q2020 said ibm. This will help both $ibm and $amd. The move of many key ibm's leaders to amd suggests a deep partnership. The positons of these are all around the datacenters, cognitive, GPUs and integration of CPUs for AI. It cannot be a coincidence it's deep partnership. Losa Su was executive assistant to ibm's lou garstner former ceo. Mark Papermaster comes from ibm's too. So revealing such partnership will end $intc and $nvda foothold at corporate datacenters and cloud and promote amd. Ibm's big event in May San Francisco will have demo etc but ibm said they reveal the amd's basef datacenters and cloud or hybrid cloud this Q! I've posted about such incli6a video. Check the posts history. https://www.ibm.com/events/think/"
Just picked up 200 shares! Rocketship!!
Wow. I can’t believe I will be green again on IBM.
This ex IBMer says Thank You God..
"Talk about getting old and losing it! Buffet's timing these days is terrible. He should be selling apple and buying ibm, just as before he should have been selling ibm and buying apple. Poor guy. Doesn't know when to quit while he's ahead! Don't professional atheletes know when to retire gracefully? Age is not an enhancer of cognitive ability. IBM is obviously going back up to $200 near term."
Does anybody look at PE's and dividends anymore? This stock should never pull back.
IBM is the leader in block chain technology.
"I'm totally amazed why this stock isn't plummeting. Considering all the employee cuts and product changes IBM has made in the last 4-5 year what CIO, COO, etc. would bet their job on IBM's promises that the proper staff and resources are mapped to what they're selling. Look, even their Strategic Imperatives have been affected by cuts. The only thing keeping this pooch afloat is the stock is institutionalized within 100's of funds ... and the fact that they're still cutting dividend checks ... at least for now. I agree with Angela and David B. A new CIO and revised direction is needed badly."
Above $140 tomorrow.
Broker 50 and 200 day averages....$104 is next support.
Last 30 mins to buy at 151.7 before it jumps back to 155 in premarket tomorrow.
"IBM is entering civil engineering, doing maintenance on bridges and roads with AI. How confused are these folks actually. They should provide the tools and other specialized firms the application side of things."
Very possitive CC going on. It is way undervalued. IBM should be trading @ $200. Too cheap to pass on.
dividend had done nothing but increase since 2002
Did Watson Predict this ?
"Somebody has a ""Crystal Ball"". I'm jumping on the bandwagon! This bodes well that IBM will beat expectations"
"I just pray it can go up a little so I can get out. No confidence in new ceo. Even with a half decent quarter, just tanks. When they made announcement a few weeks back, stock went up, and within 24 hours dropped $12.They can't even hold their own for 12 hours with good news. No wonder there is a sell-off. Nothing to do with stimulus or anything else. Just a bad company."
"Ibm has joined the other left leaning corporations out there, they should just stick to their business and stay out of politics. Why offend any of your customers?"
Gapfill at 140 coming
"The last couple of days, I was looking at my shares of IBM. It's usually just a quick trade for a few hundred bucks, but this time it's trading differently. I think I'm gonna hold my shares a little extra longer this time around"
"I guess the markets got this wrong too?IBM hits 10-month high after announcing IBM software products are now cloud-native for public and private clouds via its Red Hat acquisition11:32 AM ET, 08/01/2019 - Briefing.comCo announced that it has transformed its software portfolio to be cloud-native and optimized it to run on Red Hat OpenShift. Enterprises can now build mission-critical applications once and run them on all leading public clouds, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba and IBM Cloud and on private clouds. The IBM-certified and containerized software will provide a common operating model and common set of services -- including identity management, security, monitoring and logging -- and are designed to improve visibility and control across clouds together with a unified and intuitive dashboard. The software and services announced today, which include more than 100 products from across IBM's expansive software portfolio optimized to run on Red Hat OpenShift, will be delivered on IBM's hybrid multicloud platform.Morgan Stanley also initiated coverage with an Overweight rating at $170 tgt this morning."
Nobody sells at IBM. They just scan their BRs snd lobby for credit. 8 people get paid on sn average transaction. Layers and layers of overlays.
"Maybe we need another “ Cookie Man” like ,Lou G. Last splits 1997 and 1999 .Should have followed Warren Buffett out the door to Apple , I guess?"
Looks as if the worst is over and we can slowly climb back to a reasonable price of 150
get 800 share at $148.23
Recent erratic behavior of IBM stock price seems to indicate that perhaps another most disappointing quarterly report is on its way! Once again the gutsy shorts will make lots of money and the longs will be down in the dumps. JMHO............ Tex
Does anyone know why the EPS estimates (from Yahoo Finance) are as follows: ???Last quarter reported - $2.68/shareThis quarter (est) - $4.68/shareMarch 2020 quarter - $2.16/shareWhy the $2.00/share extra for this next reporting quarter??Thanks

This is why the stock is stable for now....Buybacks Set 4th Consecutive Quarterly Record at $223 Billion; 2018 Sets Record $806 Billion..look it up....
The revenue increased by a huge amt 0.1%
Chance to cross $125 soon !
Earnings beat by $0.02. Reported $2.68 vs $2.66 estimated. Revenue came in a little light. $18 billion vs $18.2 estimated. Forward guidance confirmed and debt down $6.7 billion.
"i'm a computer professional. did some consulting work for ibm years ago. because of that i might be overly impressed by their presentations, as having worked with their products i always found them to be good and the company well run.that said, i like what i am hearing ... has a positive feel.they have their fingers in all the areas where there will be huge growth in the coming years AI and cloud,plus they have a huge base to work in together sorry i didn't sell this afternoon to buy back in after hours, but no reason for this over extended sell off.at the end of the day, the insiders are buying that works for me."
IBM will shine through 2018. Its an IBM year !! As the high flyers come crashing back to their intrinsic values IBM will start growing revenues and analysts are targeting $180-$225 by end of 2018. Meanwhile I will get my $1.5 per share.
Anyone know if any payback from IBM quantum computing r&d soon? Talking about it for yrs now.
"So, how much does a lousy brand name cost a blue chip icon? About 3 bucks and some change in share price...."
why is the media posting all these Warren Buffet selling and the negative news just on the last day before the ex dividend date. to shake off more buyers??? so as to keep more dividend money for the insiders??
"Nice job President Trump. Stocks reversed losses amid new data that consumer confidence rose to a 15-year high in April, suggesting consumers maintained a positive outlook on the direction of the economy prior to recent trade tension escalations. MAGA $CSCO $F $GM $GE $C $APPL $MMM $FB $JPM $GAB$IBM $FB $BAC"
Buy tomorrow on the selloff. Buffett continuing to unload shares anytime IBM gains ground is one of the biggest reasons for lack of momentum. With him out of the way it should run its natural upward course
I had no idea IBM was still a thing. Not being funny. It popped up on the most views. I’ve not seen any IBM ads or computers etc in years. Will look up. Guessing behind the scenes stuff now?
"read that Jim Chanos, the famous investor that focues on short selling companies due to flakey accounting, is highlighting IBM as a stock to short. Apparently he feels that their earnings are buffeted by accounting shenanigans, and the split of the two companies will enable more of same."
"That Red Hat, looking good, feeling good! IBM, now knows what to spend cash flow on. MORE, SAAS, cloud companies!"
Did I tell you to short IBM at any pop? You will never lose if you short it at any pop. Believe it!
Does anyone think IBM will increase dividend or cut it
"Today is the day of truth, after the announcement it will reach the threshold of 140."
IBM is a financial engineering company. The best in the business. But the question is whether they can financially engineer their way back to growth?
IBM is a safe growing block chain bet. Warren probably has regretted he reduced his position. Luckily he is still keeping an equal weight postition of around 5 billions. He has great common seense but not expert to see through quantum computer and block chain excellent growth though.
"this is starting to look good and I believe earnings will pick up, we have a new CEO on board and shaking out the dead hands is on the menu I hope its one of the specials, come on turn-a-round."
"With rising tide even the garbage floats but not IBM!! The longest bull market in history hasn't helped. It seems like the stock wants to join the likes of GE, Sears, and Kodak et al. It is ironic, but maybe, this time the Sun has set on this company for eternity!"
"we will easily return to $130 today, or by the end of the week. Never lose faith in the old company "
This time last year in 4/8/2020 IBM issued an earnings warning. Be careful here folks - we could see another one from IBM any day.
"Barclays upgrade moving the stock - expecting revenue growth and good contributions from the server.. Technically, there is no serious resistance under $182 and the stock is undervalues because current projections were based on declining revenue.The stock will be over $170 when the stock opens on Friday. FWIW"
Analyst turns positive. One more has added it to the buy list
"IBM market cap 104 bAdobe market cap 214 b Ever wonder why markets all analysts and experts are worried for IBM and why IBM had better heed their advice seriously with urgency ? Well lets talk about Adobe. In 2012. Adobe , small software company has market cap of less than 19b . IBM was then worth 200b. Today, this still small adobe (compared to MSFT anyway) is now 212b and rising , that is 2 times that of IBM. Remember Adobe is not a AI prince or Cloud prince or quantum prince or whatever prince wanting to be next king, just an old humble niche software maker. Yet its market is already 2 times that of IBM !"
let's hope IBM bod announces rometty is being replaced at the next earnings announcement which according to some analysts won't be a good report
Shorts are straight up mad! LOL
This is the company that stands to gain significantly from blockchain. Will the railroads look to IBM to modernize their supply chain or work it out themselves?
it's not about what they make or what they do. it's about what they sell. They need to reinvent themselves.
IBM is my only new purchase. I think current levels are a gift.
IBM is going up without any news ?? Caution: Danger signboard ahead.
IBM has a great Q4 report and goes down along with just about all today.. ...which is all due to the Davos meetings.--after hours is on fire though
it is yahoo reading wrong
$125 hit today and still stuck at $126
"IBM's problem is - it does not have a Consumer oriented offering. They have great technologies like AI, but do not know how to exploit that! For example Zoom does not have IP anywhere near IBM, but found a way to create a great product for Consumers and beating IBM in growth! In other words IBM has building blocks BUT companies like Zoom have the building! IBM needs some smart Marketing folks to create consumer-centric products using AI..."
"The last time IBM dropped this low was July 9th, after which is quickly rose to over $128 by July 22nd. I think a lot of people will be buying in here at this discounted price. Real good value here."
"Are once great IBM will probably continue to shrink very likely to under $70 billion/year in the near future, that is still a lot of revenue! No CEO can save this sinking ship, hey, even if it drops to under $50 billion per year, IBM will still be in the game!"
"Need another outsider like Gerstner to take the reins here..... great IP and market reach, but they are lost, and no one is leading"
Hey @Mack. I’m here waiting for you. Or do you only bash lowly stocks. I’m ready to hear about the Watson technology now
Happy dividend pay day.
The stock has languished in a range and never breaks out. Im long the stock and I love the dividend but the board needs to take action and replace the CEO with someone who can drive the company to compete with its rivals who late comers but take a big chunk of IBM's customers. IBM has become too bloated with middle management to react to customer needs quickly and the technical ranks are overworked. Flatten the management ranks and use that to fund technical resources.
"The problem for IBM is that as demand for the cloud increases, more players get into the market. There is major competition, and smaller companies are showing up on the landscape. Also, inflation is eating into companies earnings. At some point, the music is going to stop, and companies will adjust to a reasonable value based on their business model, not just that Wall St. doesn't have anywhere else to put their money."
Dow is up some 280 points but IBM is down. Why? Because of this Indian’s cunning plan to split. Analysts don’t like either and call it a gimmick. Party only lasted a day. Vote against this split!!!
"got up and open my account, the only red stock is IBM, what a joke.....I'm just holding for the dividend, then I'm done with it....."
3 trading day rule after these earnings & then might be worth a short term rebound trade!
expect 5 % jump on stock price with increase earnings
from215 8 yrs ago to this VOMIT have 300 @ 95 thought would get 150 haha...at least i make %9 on my investment (your yield is what you own it at not todays price....brown says thats not so ....... because he knows everything)
Was IBM awarded the Pentagon contract or are these just rumors?
Cyber attack targeting SolarWinds Corp. customers (not the least apparently). Perhaps an opportunity for IBM to step forward and help out?
Adobe's market cap is approaching IBM's. Can you believe it??
"Look, investors dont like 8 qtrs of lower revenue until this last report. Wall street has zero faith in Rometty. Until she is gone, the stock will remain range bound. The BOD is remiss in its Fiduciary responsibility to the shareholder with the refusal to replace her. IBM seesaws, rises then back down again while Its peers continue to move up. Wall street needs a CEO they can believe in, and rometty is not it!"
I'm selling at 132.... Moving on.
"Seems like IBM management is fixated only on issues like diversity, equal rights, social injustice, equal pay, etc, and hoping to earn enough browny points and get a great National corporate citizenship award! They have totally forgotten that the goal of any business entity is to make innovative products, compete, make money, and show concern for their stockholders!"
6 directors bought IBM stock this week! Bingo!
im a buyer at 130
"Start to see some IBM cloud pack job ads, and making inroads in complex global organizations ."
IBM CFO giving them hell on CNBC right now! Big Blue is back..!!!
Another $2 gain evaporates... This stock is hopeless.
"Why do I suspect that IBM is once again stuffing the ballot box. That is counting anything that moves as ""Cloud Revenue"". The insiders know of which I speak. Any revenue in the old world of outsourcing that gets close to the line of Cloud gets pushed over the line. Someday this will get reviewed by some enterprising reporter. The forest for the trees.........dropping overall revenue. Someday no more forest."
IBM is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.I don't agree!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-ibm-stock-sinks-market-224510168.html
"Another day, another 52 week low. Way to Go!"
Why dont IBM shareholder get to vote on the acquisition or red hat?
Buy MSFT and make up the risky IBM dividend in a week.
"No hurry to buy, will fall sharply in the afternoon!Always fall big after earnings"
I have just about given up. Should I sell my remaining shares or hold off until January with the hope GR will retire?
"OK IBM, you are self proclaimed #1 in AI and you say it is exploding in 2020....can we assume we will see that in your 2020 revenue and EPS projections or do you not really mean it?"
Back to business trade galore. Up we go!
it's about Dividend and Growth. Not just the dividend. imho
"I talked to a friend I went to engineering school who works at Microsoft. He said that IBM's purchase of RedHat wasa game changer and that already at meetings the managers are talking about IBM/RedHat as a major competitor with unique value propositions. I couldn't believe my ears at first but, my buddy (a real smart guy) said, ""Absolutely true!"""
"AI, Blockchain, Quantum, and Cloud....."
"Message to the new CEO! I have faith in you. The dividend is nice and should be raised every year even if small. However long term us investors in IBM, want growth and total appreciation and you as a shareholder should want the same. Do that sir and the pps will follow. God Bless."
New CEO and this goes to 160
"who are all these people posting gloom and doom, cutting and pasting and posting all over the web. are they investors or shirt sellers or did they simply lose a lot by selling short?"
What if Ginni is leaving because she sees no future in the company and she rather pass the blame to someone else. It's also a possibility.
WILL BOUNCE AND THEN TAKE OUT THE OLD LOW OF 90................
Big beat
Looks like a massive deal to me guys a double in a year
i just bought 300 more at 137.65
mute button comes in handy
What does IBM do?
the Blue giant wakes up...!
"In an up market, how can you lose money? The answer - invest in IBM and hold."
"At least we know where all our tomatoes & coffee comes from thanks to IBM block chain & watson. What will our world be without this crucial information.Still no idea how IBM is monetizing these block chains & watson ,,Doubt if anyone in IBM also know.. Just talking points to looki good for the ads."
Those who still think that IBM will keep the dividend in this market and with interest rates going to zero are delusional.
"IBM stock will explode if the spinoff is accelerated. The sooner IBM is a pure cloud play the better.I think that a large part of the dividends paid not will be allocated to NewcoI will keep the Newco stock for the dividend income plus the obvious fact that as IBM, the cloud company grows (as a pure cloud play), Newco will grow accordingly to service IBM. In short, Newco will also increase its growth rate.I have a question: will this Russia cyberattack trigger new security business for IBM? To put the question in a different way, IBM has super encription technology - will this get IBM new government business? If not, why not?"
Wonder if IBM bought back a lot of shares ? how many
Remember what Warren Buffett says about IBM
"How's this IBM stock holding a 20 P/E, should be closer to 14-15 tops."
"Consider this, nearly EVERY SINGLE SHARE bought back by IBM since 2009, which represents tens of billions of dollars, was purchased at a higher price then Friday's close, a ton of shares at much, much higher prices. That is stunning."
"IBM, just showed us that digital transformation is lifting all boats. Only suckers selling SAAS stocks today."
"In your dreams, I do not know how you reach these conclusions. The company is profitable. With a low multiplier.Increased its revenue forecast and profit for the next quarter. I do not understand you."
Soon $160 
Strong team at the top. Watch the market cap double.
So undervalued!
Big Blue shall rise again. $200+ in 2021. I can wait. I get a fat dividend while i wait.
Remember $huya is a tiny player attempting to make streaming cloud games for esports titles. The most difficult in terms of bandwidth and latency as fast action and responses are key. Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud can do this because of multi 10s of billions of dollars infrastructure used in other ways such as youtube games etc including ads revenues. No way $huya can create that. Many small companies tried and failed. Sony bought such a Japanese based company and could not do much niw going to Microsoft Azure for help. Net is I'm expecting $huya crushing especially as new consoles from Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo coming plus Samsung releasing new smartphones and tablets with amd's GPUs rDNA design inside. This obviously affects $nvda and $intc in addition to my posts re to datacenters $ibm partnership etc. Big chance to sell huya buy amd ahead of Tue ER. Same goes for others.This is another nees on the ecosystem needed for streaming games. See what it takes? Never listen to @Jack...https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/activision-blizzard-and-google-enter-into-multi-year-strategic-relationship-to-power-new-player-experiences-300993016.html
we desperately need Activist investor
"I find the corporate intransigence at IBM disgusting and horrifying -- what is Rometty doing there? The Board is old, stultified -- Taurel (69) been on Board since 2001; Farr(63) been on Board since 2012; Eskew (68) been on Board since 2005; Chenault (66) been on Board since 1998; McNerney (68) been on Board since 2009 -- on and on"
How many more in N/A were released in june? Anyone have the numbers?
"I like the fact that the CEO is very near her retirement age which I believe is a very positive catalyst for the stock. In the meantime, the dividend is just great."
More information about IBM current price level https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202994-ibms-unreasonable-price
"In a raging bull market with practically all tech stocks hitting all time high, we have this one stays down. The CEO has no shame and won’t step down. She didn’t even bother to attend earnings conferences either to avoid embarrassment by being questioned. We have no use for her and the Board is just too feeble to act. Hope one day an activist investor gets involved like the one with T. Then change will take place for us small investors."
i cringe every time i see fast talking dunderhead rometty on tv.
Thank you for your service and best of luck. Also I hear a Dairy Queen and Taco Bell need managers. Thanks again
"The first headline on Jan 2 better be ""Rometty out as CEO"" and the second better be ""IBM Board resigns due to complete incompetency"""
Did IBM announce the September dividend today?
"Before you listen IBM will be the first to market quantum personal commuters that is correct whiting next 2 years. There is a spinoff later this year that will allow the company to focus on services only (web services etc. security, etc.) Not to mention high div while you wait strong cashflows. IBM will be at the top once more"
Big blue on the right track
I will be buying more tomorrow. The upside is massive.

I own too many shares of IBM. I needed to shed a little. Today might be the day.
"we need a run back to 130 ,,"
IBM closes the year on a strong note. '21 promises to be interesting.
Another 52 week low reached... BOD DO YOUR JOB!
"IBM competitive edge should be its understanding of the business and consulting, marrying technology to platform, and finding solutions to client with its consulting services."
How is this excuse of a CEO still in office??
"When Obama was president, I witnessed the biggest growth in my portfolio. Now that Trump is president, the growth in my portfolio has slowed to a crawl pace"
I’ll buy in the 90’s
"As government shuts down into this afternoon, the market will tank at the close. No trader would hold over the weekend so expect IBM below $160."
"I'm a numbers guy. 900 billion divided by 350 million= 2571$ per american resident. So if each person receives 600$, where's the other 1971$ going to?"
Jeannie now out of the bottle. trading at roughly 10x next year's earnings means the upside is double from here. Buy.
"I don't like the new financial data format either. And it looks like the charts only go back 1 year. They used to go back 5, 10 or MAX years. I don't see those options on the new charts. Am I doing something wrong or is that the way it is now? If so, I'll need to look for something else. They really messed everything up."
Love the new leadership n the Red Hat acquisition is starting to pay off. IBM is changing for the better n is in the perfect space to get back to all time highs.
IBM reminds me now of GE
I can't believe your mainframes are so outdated and we bought your Gold plated SS7 Network here in telecom for back up in the 80's. Too long to get to the cloud is what we have been reading. Good luck though. A major Dow component dragging all of us down $IBM $FTR.
I just run numbers. i expect IBM will take off once it starts to grow again. First no dividend cuts 25yrs of increases.This stock normally trades at a historic pe of 15 so we imho are undervalued. Slated to earn 12.40 in 2021. So put a conservative 13.3 p e handle on it and that is around 165 a share.
All tech stocks amd market down and IBM up slightly
"IBM lost the battle ground on public cloud. They lost to AWS, they lost to Azure, they lost to GCP. Their last bet is hybrid cloud and this is nothing new as it is still traditional on premise solution."
"IBM has been squandering money on wasted dividends and share buy-backs. If they would have used all that money to invest in cloud infrastructure, the IBM stock would by now be probably worth 1000. But there is no vision from the CEO, nor the BOD, nor any of the executive team. Rometty was the wrong CEO, she gathered a club of wrong leadership who have in turn gathered a club of utterly useless, but politically correct and affirmative action based executives. A new CEO needs to come in who fires the thousands of executives and restarts the company, technology focused. Or maybe they show hire Gordon Ramsey to clean up the kitchen."
The previous three CEOs spent too much on share buybacks and did not spend enough on R&D.
Stock market is exploding and IBM can't even make it back to $120. LOL.
IBM 2.0! Solid dividend and long term growth play. Hybrid cloud and AI leader.
IBM: the lion start MOVING could hit 165 tomorrow for option expire
9x Next years earnings.. hmm
The only reason to hold the stock now is for the bounce when they announce Ginny is leaving....
Whats the short interest in IBM? I would think it already covered. Hey Robinhood take a look at IBM short interest.
"I think the argument that Redhat will help IBM get more share in the cloud is flawed. I think the most relevant impact will be simply worsening the financials for IBM, which already look terrible with little hope for a change. Kind of like FB buying a security company will fix their data leak problems. Company value keeps shrinking, but the leadership stays, and is allowed to spend even more. Maybe instead of taking Redhat in, someone should leave."
"Don't worry everyone Ginny will have some ""strategic Imperative"" talk to soothe you. I have a different stock where the CEO talks like that. Don't expect the BOD to do anything. Your only recourse is to sell the stock......take your loss and move on."
"IBM was just added to the S&P Dividend Aristocrats yesterday, does that affect share price?"
If you want to invest in long term tech IBM is the company to own. Forget the high flyers all the money in those companies has already been made. 5% div and tripling of stock price in 5 years with IBM. Buy hold and don't worry about it.
Thank you Ginny
"New to iBM..great Dividend...Stock has done nothing, nothing since 2013 ..last split was 1999. But...But, It looks to me like it is forming a Bullish Flag Pattern on the long term chart..so this explains why it has done nothing since 2013. This thing could break out in a strong up move fairly soon...Just an observation."
"I have decided to keep the stock of both companies after the spinofff. Newco will have the higher dividend payout. But I will buy additional IBM stock after the dividend. Remember that Newco is providing infrastructure services to IBM - so as the PE for IBM grows, as it will, similarly, Newco will also get a higher PE ratio. I see it as a win/win for both companies. I would like feedback on the IBM hybrid cloud - it is my understanding that the IBM hybrid cloud is better than the hybrid clouds of competitors. Is there anyone who can quantify that for me?"
"the only thing worse than fast talking dunderhead rometty is the BOD who fell for it hook, line, and sinker"
this is a 200 dollar stock again once the board fires gin soaked ceo. get to it or be voted off the board
Time to split the stock! May be that will help the stock price!
"I don't think the BOD or upper management have dealt with the reality that IBM is now a struggling mid-cap companyin the tech space, not the dominant behemoth it was when they took over. The Red Hat acquisition is a case in point...IBM simply cannot afford it...the 32 or so billion dollars could be better spent on internal development and smaller acquisitions..but this would require a CEO and staff that is actually clued in, unlike the people now in charge. Complicating the issueis a mostly ceremonial BOD that has abdicated its responsibilities."
Up 12% in a month
Hanging in Jan report and guidance move it 130s
Vote your proxy shares to remove the board and the ceo! The CEO is driving the company into the ground and the BOD has violated its fiduciary responsibilities to the shareholders!
"When times are tough, the weak are the first to be abandoned. IBM is down $20 per share in less than 2 weeks. Ginny also has the distinction of being one of the few people in the history of earth to preside over the loss of $100 Billion in market cap. I wonder what kind of bonus that will get her."
"i wrote the 144 calls for next week, received 3.40 a contract,,will take the premium for the week, i am happy with that weekly,, hope they dont get called and then ride it till dividend day again"
"WHITEHURST needs to step in today, while BOD REPLACED Stock jumps $50 points"
Ark funds may be buying IBM. Cathie Wood tweeted that K$IBM is making bold moves as it runs away from legacy tech. Open source #blockchain smart contracts could be big!
"Suddenly someone likes IBM or the shorts cant drop it any further so they are starting to cover,, IBM back to 150+ in time,,sit tight collect DIV and wait for the runs,"
$163.90 after hour . What part of earning wasn’t good enough ?
Looks like those who shorted the stocks are now desperate and posting bad news. It’s ok. Let them post their frustrations to ease it.
"Hold on let me pick myself off the floor!!! Ok, I caught my breath!! IBM FINALLY broke thru the psychological 130 barrier, now let's see it hold above 130 for several days. Resistance is the 135.50 mark it hit on Oct 8th when it announced the split into two companies; if it can break through 135.50 then I think us IBM holders may finally be rewarded with some decent capital appreciation. Near term, it's over bought so it's critical IBM closes above 130 for a few days. Congrats to all the long term holders (myself included, YEARS of waiting and waiting may be paying off ... and that's a BIG MAYBE!)."
I am retired and I want IBM for the dividend what say you
IBM has huge upside. The Redhat acquisition has worked out beautifully. All systems go with AI.The Company is a double in three years.
This is the first day drop and it will continue for at least 3 days before the stock becmes stable.
Don’t wake the beast
Buy #RXT or #IBM? Who will rule the cloud transition?
This baby is making a nice base to pop from-can't wait for Jan report.
Easy to manipulate stocks after hours means nothing. The next couple of days will tell the real story. Personally I believe the stock closes higher as soon as tomorrow. The ship has turned.
"Ouch, this thing is sinking (again). What happens when all the Redhat people move on to places like Google or Microsoft or Amazon? IBM will be left with nothing but a pile of free software that they have no idea how to maintain or sell the value on. I don’t think IBM has a clue what to do with Redhat."
Lots of shorts pushing fear.
"typical IBM, markets up again big and now IBM slowl sinks, wait on buying people, in a week we will see 125 level"
"With some of the new purchases, especially Red Hat, IBM will see a huge turnaround. We should see $200 within 6 months."
OK here we go again with yet ANOTHER unimaginative idea from the visionless PC CEO and BOD ...
"$ZM market cap is higher than $IBM, Yet every single video call made with this app is from a free account. Where do they get their revenue from? It's a total scam and will end in $5 in a couple of months"
How does it feel to be a bagholder?
IBM on CNBC now discussing the awesome quarter and redhat love
"take notice,,,option expiration,, they dont want IBM past 141,,"
"The market is irrational. IBM beats on earnings and maintains full year guidance, however misses on analyst sales estimates which are random at best. $11B of market cap lost because it missed sales by $400M. Weed stocks in Canada have a combine market cap that assumes Canadians will overdose on cannabis. makes no sense. IBM trades at 9.5 times forward earnings whiles weed stocks fly higher than humanly possible."
Buying more tomorrow!
We will have many faces join the board and that's GOOD.
Understand this is NOT AMD! Selling Nasdaq 100 index funds is a mux including AND and the group is sold. Don't listen to trolls self praising giving good info pretending to not understand why everyone isn't their fans just like @cdn and @Jack. Look at $ibm at $105 down from $146 a month ago or so. It's indexes nothing else. AMD will come back way higher than indexes.
Oracle new AMD EPYC Rome powered cloud launching today has BOTH BARE METAL AND VIRTUAL CLOUD INSTANCES! Way more advanced than $ibm because $orcl was first to adopt AMD in cloud as early as 2018. Imagine IBM is behind Oracle too because they failed to work with AMD earlier! But... all other cloud prociders are accelerating AMD use not $intc not $nvda !https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/29/2024245/0/en/2nd-Gen-AMD-EPYC-Processors-Power-New-Oracle-Cloud-Infrastructure-Compute-E3-Platform.html
"IBM will surge past 150, then 175, then 200 and beyond. IBM is solid. New IBM CEO and Red Hat past CEO are working diligently to bring this company to the forefront of modern technology and innovation. IBM 2.O."
IBM going a lot higher! Finally at inflection point where cloud and service growth is out pacing segments with declining revs.
171 to 112 did I leave anything out?
Anyone short?153+ eow
IBM will be risk to be taken over by much smaller startups at this valuation. A leverage buyout is extremely possible.
Is their any way the Board can justify their guidance of this company!What metrics do they use to grade their performance?Share price?!!!
"I own nine stocks in four different market sectors: all down. IBM is my biggest holding and is down by the largest percentage. The down trend scene Q1 results has made me numb. I once thought I was a prudent investor; feeling fairly unwise right now. I'm going to hold until the end of the year because I beleive if I take a different course, it will make my pain even worse. Anybody taking any action in light of this downtrend?"
"Seriously, you guys do not feel awkward your IBM down while the whole market up? No talented people work for IBM at all, they all left for all good companies like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, AVGO... Only a few stupidos left because they know they have no skills to find a job outside IBM. IBM is now running by loser Indian and you all know Indians are only good at politics. He will surround him with all clueless Indians to protect his chair, do nothing good for the company. Absolute no innovation. Slowly IBM will deteriorate to the level of Sun Microsystem and has to file chapter 7 bankruptcy and will be sold out for other companies like Oracle bought Sun MicroSystem. If I were you, I would sell off IBM and put in any tech company out there to double your money in one year. Mark my note. IBM will NEVER EVER reach $170 like it used to be and it could be down from here to bankruptcy. Believe it!"
im a buyer at $10
Good time to take some profits guys. The earnings are temporary and driven by currency gains on the dollar rise this quarter. If you listened to the call they only meet their target if the dollar does not decline from here. Long term the dollar is starting a downtrend which is a headwind for IBM as most revenue comes from overseas.
"Did you all think thata 5.5% dividend rate, increasing every year, just grows on trees? Or that IBM would stay at a 52- week low forever?"
So they are a patent company now or what exactly is the type of business model are they going for?
"Is IBM up today because of overall market forces, or did all of a sudden the company figure out what they are doing?"
Shorts still trying to cover from pre earnings. Losing their shirts
"Buffett didn't understand ibm then, and he doesn't understand ibm now."
Morgan Stanley and it is a matter of record said that next year with the split coming IBM could be in the 145-180 range. bottom line is that both new businesses will be stronger and that the cloud and AI business will grow earnings going forward.
This company is worth 200$ per share. Still undervalued in my opinion. High quality business yielding 5%+ and with P/E ~ 15. Is just out of the hype wave atm.
Say what you want about IBM but showing some strength here
"please return to former format. This is terrible, not a change for the better."
"Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp's (IBM.N) quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates as growth slowed in its higher-margin businesses that include cloud and artificial intelligence services, while demand for its legacy technology services fell....GINNY""S GOTTA GO! The BOARD NEEDS A SHAKEUP!"
a small victory to finish in the green
"Trust old NYSE when he writes, the price is down, but it's yet to be inexpensive."
"The year end tax selling and large funds moving out for YE window dressing will keep a lid on the price and rangebound until the new year. Should start a move up in early January and once we get more clarification on the spinoff, should be the boost to sustained upward move. Also, Arvind becomes the Chairman of the Board next month."
IBM leading in Blockchian will be the golden nugget. I expect surge in security revenue with Euro new personal security protection act. A lot of companies are under prepared and the fine is too high to not ask IBM to help in security.
"""revenue from Redhat grew by 20%"" this is it pals, time to go all in!"
"WANdisco has over a hundred customers and significant go-to-market partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Oracle, and others as well as OEM relationships with IBM and Alibaba."
Cloud and untact. That is the way to go. This stock should be around 150~160 range as every other cloud biz
Hmm... This is moving up way faster than I thought. Definitely will be $140 in 2 months!
Times like these is when people will be thinking about dividend plays. IBM is more of a utility type company
"When is next share's holder meeting ?No new CEO, there will more new lows!!!"
"No doubt that IBM will fall a bit from these levels - if not a lot right now, then for sure with everyone's horrible Q2's. All that said, I am still long on this with large recent purchases all below 100 made last march. My current average is at $101.50.. Below, I again repost my comments from back then as to why I am long.. and I will continue to look to acquire more as this dips back to that range and or lower … honestly, if I were really bold I would short it back down to 100 and flip long. but I am just going to be patient on this and average it down to whatever bottom happens - (REPOSTING THE FOLLOWING)IBM may be a slow pig - but a couple of facts are relevant here.1. IBM is only months away from becoming a dividend aristocrat. 25 years of straight dividend increases2. Even if free cash flow drops THERE IS NO WAY that the BOD will break this streak3. Thus the dividend is safe... and its currently yielding more than 6%4. IBM does not make (much) stuff … thus it has no supply chain and factory problems5. 80% of IBM's staff already, / or is fully capable of working from remote so there are no ""closures""6. The whole world is learning from corona that moving ""online"" and ""Remote"" is functional7. as such (with all the new working REMOTE companies) the whole ""cloud"" IT landscape will grow dramatically as this corona issue is resolved8. IBM will resultantly capture a portion of this post corona business - as its deeply supported INSTITUTIONAL sized clients up their game and their needs for support from IBM. 9. with all the millennials, and GIG economy, and service industry employees, - circling the unemployment offices like buzzards.... they will not be buying their ""fashionable"" new Iphones - and APPLE will fall hard as it hugely misses earnings for several quarters straight..- those investors will be looking for other post corona economy safer stocks - and historically IBM has been one of those companies that seems to get ""held"" during rough times. 10. Ginny is gone - ..nuff said AS SUCH, THERE IS NO REASON to think that IBM will at least recover rapidly( when the virus dies) to pre coronal levels of ~$150 -- that and the juicy dividend will pull in buyer support (especially at levels below 100) . Also as Aristocrat status is achieved IBM will get added to funds and computer trading algorithms that trade in aristocrat stocks - that will boost volume."
"You hear a lot of what IBM is doing except getting revenue. Supposedly 2000 AI customers....1700 trials, 150 FOAKs, 100 academic instances, 35 'partnerships', and 15 paying."
Way too cheap
Can anyone explain why IBM CEO is not fired? No company in history has suffered 27 quarters (over 5.5 years) of revenue decline. IBM is on the brink - so sad to see a once great company dying.
What happened to Watson?
"Love Buffet, but glad he’s out. The daily slow drain of his selling had to bring price down. Hopefully a steady rise is in the cards."
Only IBM can spin firing people and closing projects after massive advertising them as good for business. Smooth sailing ahead into a massive iceberg today.
I'm bearish hear but want to see the gap to 126 filled and take it from there. But on a fundamental perspective I keep asking my self what does IBM do that is special or unique? and I struggle for an answer.
"IBM must reinvest for future earnings growth, was buying Red Hat the wise choice?"
"JPM expects IBM to meet expectations on revenue... I dont think it will gain much above 160 while koo koo Ginney is in the CEO seat. Buyer beware. If they miss, the stock will be 139 a few days after"
"IBM has underperformed the S&P 500 in seven out of the past eight years, and in most years it has underperformed by more than 10%. Coincidentally, those eight years comprise the entirety of Ginni's tenure."
"IBM at a 5yr low,people are starting to panick"
"Company was moving lower when the market was making new highs. Now the company will loose even more market share than before in the weak year ahead. I see no upside in the stock only high risk. The high dividend is a trap. Why do you think it is there in the first place? IBM is a legacy company. No new products or innovations, just living on old patents, and super thin margins. You can now conclude they overpaid for Redhat. If they had an economist on staff they would have waited for this pull back to buy RHT, pay 40% less."
"i like the IBM serverless Function as a service. IBM is the only vendor to offer managed OpenWhisk services as a function. I start to see service differentiation from IBM Cloud. Good job. IBM Cloud is for the enterprise, it should make great inroads to enterprise. Coming quarter is the defining moment for batches of contract signing. Time to add more shares"
"Also 1.57 a share dividend has a record date of around August 10, payable in Sept."
I guess Wednesday was the dead cat bounce. And now the downtrend continues. Finishing near worst levels of the day. Way to go BIG BLUES!
"I said a while ago, if IBM could retire Ginny rommety, steal Jensen Huang from Nvidia and place him as CEO of IBM, this company and stock would grow. He seems to do all the right things with Nvidia AI. Autonomous cars are loaded with Nvidia chips. The man never stops working."
"What is management doing right now? Seriously. So from what I am seeing, management continues to put all their eggs in one basket on AI and Hybrid Cloud services all while neglecting the opportunities to expand AI with industries like EVs or 3D printing. How hard is it for the CEO to see that they can partner with GM, Ford or any up and coming electric automotive company to implement their AI technology? It is really not that hard to execute a licensing agreement to sell software for selfless driving cars.. Really annoying watching this company fall off a cliff quarter after quarter because management can't seem to figure out what they can do with their colossal technology portfolio. WAKE UP MANAGEMENT!!! "
Break 114 support?
Buffet had 54 million shares than sold a third of it and now still owns 37 million so he's not out
"Beyond depressing... Nasdaq up over 1.5%. IBM down .31% The more things change at IBM, the more they stay the same."
"The purchase of RH signals the BOD'S acceptance of the reality that Rometty's turnaround plan is afailure, and that in effect she is not competent to lead what was once the preeminent US corporation.. But then they alsol let her put what's left of IBM at risk by making this purchase at the very top of the market. This is why the stock keeps declining. I think we will see $100 before $150, if in fact we ever get that high again. An incompetent, risk-taking CEO, with a BOD who ignore their fiduciary responsibility."
"SHAREHOLDERS listen up THE BOD of this mess has to replace CEO GINNY Gal, then insert the RHT ceo, stock jumps $50-$75 points hire GOLDMAN SACHS and buy into the Future of 5G with inflated stock price or bring in ACTIVIST INVESTOR and we all vote our proxy's with his demand yes start talking about this on any media source"
proves Ginny was lying to Buffet
2.18 to 2.28 yoy estimate
"What to expect from Lisa Su CES keynote in January? Well, big things! Remember Lisa has presented the 2019 keynote at CES on high performance computing. Why 2 years later give her such important event to keynote AGAIN vs Intel or nVidia's doing it this time?Well.. it has to be BIG news! In 2019 Lisa Su presented EPYC Rome, with TWO PARTNERS on stage, Google and Twitter using it - see attached article covering that keynote, video available too.In January I'm expecting way more insight. ..yes, EPYC Milan and a bunch of other chips including Zen 3 mobile Ryzen. ..but also we could hear big new products our of already ongoing Xilinx development. ..and.. GOOGLE ASIC CHIP MENTIONED BY MARK PAPERMASTER WEBINAR IN JULY! We could see $ibm on stage showing joint datacenters development for cloud as recently announced, vision. We could see Apple's Macbooks powered by Zen3 Ryzen mobile CPUs or Google new powerful chromebooks using them!On thing for sure it cannot be a repetition of the 2019 keynote! You don’t invite the same speaker to give another keynote 2 years later for nothing. ..Think about it. ..CES is a huge event. ...it has to be the best is yet to come. .!Check this 2019 past keynote to get an idea what needs to be surpass in Jan ...!https://www.anandtech.com/show/15333/amd-keynote-presentation-press-event-at-ces-2020-the-anandtech-live-blog"
I LOVE IT-
"""TIME TO SAY GOODBYE VIRGINIA"""
"I'm supposed to buy high and sell low, right?"
Opening price tomorrow??
This stock will never soar again until KOO KOO Ginny is GONE or the board is replaced.
"Wait until next earnings when IBM misses both on top and bottom line, they will drop through the basement."
plus u get 6 buck div
why anyone would invest in a company that has negative earnings growth is beyond me.
This should help IBM with the Pentagon JEDI contract.
"I was drinking in an Irish Bar last night near Penn Station NY. One Fella at the Bar said that when Red Hat kicks in, IBM will sky-rocket out of the stratosphere."
"I am holding my modest investment in IBM with the hope that it hits ~$160 at which point I plan to sell. I am concerned at the ridiculous price IBM paid for Redhat as a temporary fix to IBM's dismal (really criminally negligent) performance in the critical cloud computing area. In the intermediate term Redhat will help IBM keep its head above water in the hybrid cloud area but that is a losing bet over the long term as most companies are steadily moving to the public cloud environment. Once again, IBM management missed the boat and are playing catch up at a huge cost."
"To me, this stock is a screaming buy. IBM has their hands in just about everything technology related and is well positioned for the future. Internet security? check. Cloud? check. Government contracts? check. Large business contracts? check. Profitable? check.BUY BUY BUY"
buy buy buy IBM will be up to $300 in two years with greatest dividend in the world..
"This great company has turned the corner, is keeping its head down and beginning to accelerate across all of their strategic initiatives. No company in the world has the depth and is as firmly entrenched in the business world than IBM. Ginny Rometti is a visionary who has led the company to where it is today. Time to get on board."
Now $135 just around the corner as new lower resistance level NICE!
And I’m done with this market for now
Our stock will pop. One of our salesmen has signed up Schlumberger as a new account.
"Very stable company, cloud presence growing, over 6% annual dividend, what's not to like. Great anchor in a retirement portfolio."
Cloud revenue grew more than 60%
What happened to $20 EPS by 2020? I don't think IBM has increased it's earnings in 20 years.
"$SQ $VERI $IBM $PYPL With SQ's new payment terminal with luxurious, innovative features, can now easily compete with Verifone, Ingenico, etc"
It looks like IBM is gonna make it after all.
"""More than 100 IBM executives are going to Washington this week with one mission: to convince Congress NOT to adopt Europe’s privacy laws.""Is this true? First of all, 100 execs, don't they really have nothing better to do? Secondly, and more importantly, why? What's the problem with consumers having the right to know who has their data and what is being done with it? Do they have something to hide? I don't think IBM has much consumer data first hand. Is it because in every bank, insurance company, airline that has IBM services running they have indirect access from India and other places.And thirdly, why IBM, FB and Google have way more consumer data in their hands, why are they not doing the same? I really don't understand this."
"I am buying here...over reaction. Slower growth in Cloud is not a problem...no growth or decline in growth is a problem...AI, blockchain, all moving forward not backwards.We all know that this beast moves slowly, but it is going in the right direction...under 150 is a buy collect dividend and wait."
Free CASH flow is unreal WARREN???
"Until IBM reorgs and flattens the management ranks and cost structure to compete with others in the space, IBM will continue to to be range bound. Not long ago, IBM was touting blockchain, Watson health and AI. Whats going on now,, selling watson, Others are eating IBM market share in blockchain and AI. IBM has ALWAYS, come up with new and better ideas, pour billions into development only to abandon them like a red headed step child(remember OS/2). IBM is BLOATED with management layers, accountants and political cronies who ""wet their beaks"" on each contract and add thousands of dollars in cost making IBM the most expensive of the bidders(ie. The DOD contract). Weed out the management ranks and use those high salaries to bring on tech help(the opposite of what they have been doing in the last 10 years). Thousands of IBM techs with experience and talent were either laid off and hired on with other tech co's making room for more layers of do nothing management. VOTE OUT THE BOD!"
"JULY 5, 1999 IBM at $137... July 21, 2020 IBM at $126... 20 YEARS OF LONG INVESTOR LOOOOOOOOOOOOOSERS......."
"Have not seen any comments posted after today’s closing, down 2.8%. This is exactly what I expected.. splitting into two companies does not magically make one grow faster or worth more. Just see what had happened to HP.. it is just a hunch that IBM management decided to come out with this ‘exciting’ news 10 days before the quarterly results because they know the results will be neither good nor exciting.. we will see if the hunch is right in 10 days.."
"AMD WILL recover by closing maybe in green today or tomorrow. As Nasdaq 100 index funds sell, investors will buy back individual leading stocks instead of the mix. $ibm as low as $104.5 now recovering too. Longs is the only way with AMD."
Cloud grew by 12% which is nice! Strategic Imperatives at almost 40 billion for the year which is SMOKING! Nice job Ginny!
"Trim fat, cloud is growing strong, management is strong with great directions. Beating Analysts expectations on all metrics. Can’t complain. Go IBM REDISCOVER YOUR OLD GLORY."
"After reading IBM annual report, I am very bullish on its growth. It has actually declared that their transformation and transition to the new tech is COMPLETED. This is certain a bullish bold statement forward comparing to previous several years annual reports."
"break out! cycling into value dividend stocks? could it be, I've been waiting patiently for 3 years"
Buffet 100% out of IBM
"Somebody needs to give granny Ginni a wake up call urgently.Look at the CNBC interview. The dude asks her what IBM's answer is to the AWS blockchain framework. Her answer, oh oh, IBM's blockchain runs on the public cloud. Where does she think the AWS blockchain framework runs then? On a treadmill?She should retire and go join the UN or something, there she can talk the whole day about inclusion, empowerment, affirmative action, whatever."
Ginni has made some bold moves to try and make IBM relevant. It seems relevance is going to take a while. Cloud recurring revenue can be quite powerful. IBM should become more like a telecom / infrastructure company offering background services backed by exceptional security instead of a product/services company to industry.
"Who thought of this name...Kyndryl, sounds like a cough syrup. Whoever thought this was a good name should be fired.... Its the epitome of what is wrong with IBM at its core...did the person/company who thought of this say ""Nanu Nanu"" when the laughing all finished?"
"IBM stock currently is in such spot, it is good for both longs and shorts to buy .. I am also trying in other Hedge stocks too.. I will not think twice getting into IBM for now."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out http://tradenow.xyz. They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Oh and the current situation in China will severely affect IBM's revenues as their key hope of growth was China. Very near term impact and further deterioration of IBM's business. Under $100 pps is the writing on the wall. No shares buy back manipulation will fix it. Major business decline expected.
All of the dividend worshipers should be excited to see the yield continue to increase as the stock price drops.
"herecomescaryscary crashcrashback below $85 this oldoldoldgeezercompany had it , it is longlongin the tooth poor numbers in a.i and andcloud ifthey cannot evenget their act togetheron this then thennothingcanhelp thiscompany scarycrashbackbelow $85 in coming months"
"unreal UBS suddenly down grades IBM,, this stock market is such a scam,, these analayst are not analyst they are puppets for someone who wants the stock down or up, Does not take a genius to make a call after earnings,, takes a genius to know what the call is before its announced,, So long term holders like me just hold..collect dividends and wait"
"Trump might look into Pentagon's cloud contractJul. 18, 2019 2:20 PM ET|About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)|By: Brandy Betz, SA News EditorPresident Trump says he's considering looking into the Pentagon's $10B, winner-takes-all JEDI cloud contract.Trump, during a press event for his meeting with the prime minister of The Netherlands: ""We're getting tremendous complaints from other companies. Some of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it.""Trump then named Microsoft (MSFT -0.5%), Oracle (ORCL), and IBM (IBM +4.6%).The Pentagon previously confirmed that Amazon (AMZN -1%) and Microsoft are the finalists for the contract. A formal decision is expected next month.In April 2018, Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz criticized the JEDI bidding process in a private dinner with Trump, saying the structure was designed for Amazon to win.Last week, Oracle lost its court case against the Department of Defense. The judge said ORCL hadn't met certain criteria when the JEDI bids were due.See all stocks on the move »"
7-20 Shall answer all questions-betting on RED HAT.
"IBM has no shot of organically turning this around. Glaring lack of any actual growth or even a convincing growth narrative outweighs stock buy backs and dividends - everyone can see this. Acquisitions and new leadership with modern tech mindsets are the only way out of this death spiral but CEO likely doesn't have a pulse on the market, conviction to do anything bold, and is likely too focused on self-preservation to pull the trigger. So this will continue to be a slow bleed. IBM should be taking a long look at a major cyber security acquisition like PANW, data/platform/AI like CLDR/HDP or even cloud services like a WDAY or NOW."
"IBM , reports at 5pm today."
This stock is going down unfortunately
"before 2 years IBM revenue was 79,14B and earnings was 5,75B, last year revenue was 79,59B and earnings was 8,73B, this year earnings will be more then 10B, at same level which AMZN have last year with revenue over 232B and in the same time IBM just start grooving...what is so bad in that...?"
"It looks like IBM will act like Constellation Software, keep acquiring the best of breed smaller vendors and integrate to their global distribution network at scale. Cloud should increase their own internal efficiency as well. Lots of growth ahead.... as the recent acquisition makes a lot of sense, trim the overhead afterwards with increased margin. It is quality of the profits than quantity it was focusing. Quantity will improve as quality improves in the Cloud offering with Enterprise scale and focus"
this is finally the stock to play long
Did you know that Arvind only makes .70 cents on the dollar for every dollar Ginny Rometty makes! Come on IBM let’s see equal pay for equal non work! Seriously folks why is this BOD paying Ginny more than Arvind! Her bonus was twice Arvind’s and she isn’t doing any work! Fire her!
"IBM could help itself greatly by laying off 3 layers of middle management, flattening the structure so teams can react faster with less red tape."
"Ross Perot talked about IBM not being nimble.And frankly he was on target.\GPK, is a Buying Opportunity."
Looks like IBM will go to 150 very soon.
"Fantastic earnings report from $sbhgf. Stock +4% in Japan to 3,045 yen. Earnings for first quarter were up 94% from same quarter last year with asset management profit up more than 220%. Diluted eps of 71 yen for the first quarter or 64 cents per share for one quarter. If earnings are just stable the rest of the year (no growth at all from q1) then the stock is selling at a pe of 10 for the largest blockchain investor in the world. $sbhgf $ibm $googl $riot $mgti $ostk"
Absolute overreaction. Eps better. Revenue 99% met target. What’s the big deal? Cloud incl.redhat grew as well....yes it’s not a growth company but doesn’t have to be plunged 10% on such a results.
Tomorrow and Thursday will be huge as stock climbs into Thursday's earnings. Expect and top and bottom line beat with a $10 pop by Friday morning.
"IBM is outpacing Tesla, NVDA, and Apple. is this a sign of the apocalypse?"
IBM will be two companies. 1- a failing legacy business and 2- a cloud business that has 1000's of competitors. Do you really believe this company is going to grow ? imho
"For a stock that has a very low PE and pays a high dividend, there is just no reason why this stock should be this volitile. inho"
when did dunderhead Rometty say red hat's contribution to profit and share price would materialize ?????
"Markets are well up and this is down, why ?"

"I find it interesting that people consider this company an old tech stock. Understanding prior management really missed the boat, I and I am one of the few that blames Sam more than Ginny, as Sam was just a buy back guy with zero leadership. IBM has led the world in patents for nearly 30 years. IBM mainframes process 87% of all credit card transactions(8 trillion per year). Blockchain will eventually be a big deal, quantam computing is in the near future, a 5 % dividend and hybrid cloud.To me it is a safe entry point. This is a classic case of a stock that is simply out of favor for years for lack of sales growth and then you see others trading higher that have earnings at 1 percent of what IBM makes.IBM may have overpaid for Redhat, but I think this is a 200 dollar stock at some point."
What did I miss?c(+2.11%)
"IBM's strategy is looking more and more like: Buy Red Hat, sell everything except Red Hat. It's hard to understand what the point of this process is. Red Hat already existed. I don't see much integration or synergy from this acquisition. They should have just sold their name to Red Hat and liquidated everything. That seems to be the net effect of what is going on."
"IBM selling Watson health and spinning off services unit. The new CEO should get credit for consistency. He is following exactly on Rometty’s foot steps. She got ride of intel server division, cpu manufacturing and other units. Justification has always been that these units can not be run profitably. With all these divestment IBM revenue has declined year to year for 9 years. It also worth noting that during same period there has been significant number of companies that has been purchased at great deal of costs to share holders. Revenue from new companies has not filled the gap in revenue shortfalls. There are two points that has become clear. IBM senior executives inability to run existing business units effectively and their first inclination is to say let us get out of this business. The second point is the failure of senior management to effectively integrate technology from new companies with existing IBM technologies to develop market winning customer solutions. AI is promising new IT filed. Better approach would be to find out where is the technical deficiencies and hire new expertise or buy technology to address the problem. Most of blame for failure of Watson can be attributed to Rometty’s management: talk big and deliver little. Now IBM current CEO resorts to standard IBM practice and wants to sell it off. It is not hard to see in a few years after failing to capture significant market share in cloud, he will declare IBM needs to get out of the cloud business and focus on quantum computing. IBM BOD bears the blame for allowing incompetent COE to stay on the job and destroy shareholders value for long term IBM investors. I hope IBM board with encouragement from major shareholders to hire a new CEO that has proven track record to turn around IBM. All the resources exists at IBM for skilled leader to set IBM in a growth path. A few years for now this option will not be available."
"Factory downtime using AR tools has been reduced by 50 per cent and direct investment returns are 1,717 per cent of the initial investment."
I wonder with earnings of at least $13.90 and cash flow of $12 billion if IBM will bump the dividend.
Upgrades coming
The CEO is the absolute worst! How I miss Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano.
yahoo is censoring my posts
Congrats bulls!
If tax reform is the big issue for IBM going forward ......then I'm going in again! It seems to me they have reconfigured their business for future growth.
"Let's see what they say at the Conf. call. Bottom line it is all about the cloud and if there is growth there, it will bounce back."
Too many unproductive bureaucrats still working at IBM. They need a massive purge that cuts the employee count by 50 percent.Also need to attract top talent with new tech ventures.Very bleak future until all these things happen.
Bashing? Short? Bad idea!! “Stock futures opened higher Tuesday evening after newly published data from Moderna (MRNA) fueled hopes that a vaccine providing protection against Covid-19 would be developed in the relative near-term.”Big Blue shall rise again!
So it looks like this stock will be a dividend pick which will have range bound trading until it proves the hybrid cloud working.
"At some point the dividend, which for now is extremely safe based on the payout ratio, should save whatever the bottom is. The market absolutely hates this stock and I do think it was overpunished based on q3 results. Beat on eps and a small miss on revenue and it just gets pounded. The company is still a cash flow machine. I suggest anybody who is long, write the BODs and plead for a ceo change. It has to be somebody from the outside. If Ginny had any compassion for her shareholders, she would do the right thing and announce her retirement immediately."
in at 148.56. was just to attractive
"Feb 1, 2017 this stock was $180. Just a friendly reminder. Pull up a 5 year chart. GLTA"
"This is a new day for IBM and IBM stock!Let’s be clear the employees at IBM could not be happier. A happy employee is much more productive. Employees finally have a management team they believe in. Wall Street will be much more supportive of IBM going forward. They all new Ginny was over her head and should of been gone years ago. Wall Street had no respect for her, Going forward we are in a great place. Stop any negativity on the Red Hat purchase. We would pay more for it now then we did last year. Good times ahead but it won’t occur overnight."
Our conversation on Yahoo has to meaning. Go to Twitter.com and write your opinion on IBM directly. The companies are paying an attention what is said on Twitter.
Remember when IBM was over 150 and pumpers were claiming 200 was right around the corner?
Some knows about the positive numbers ahead of the pack
IBM announces closing of Cornwallis facility. 300 + people will get lay off notices. I suppose there will be more shortly because they need to get cash for romettys folly
"It's very simple to understand. $intc stated it too, huge demand for DATACENTERS EXPANSION as cloud gets used by more companies moving their operations to online under the corona life which is still not over. Even the BLIND SQUIRREL $ibm got to expand its cloud finding a nut last quarter helping it to get higher revenues by1% - remember it's a blind squirrel. So amid all this unprecedented demand for chips, shortages, sold out ALL AMD's products, what are the Intel's results saying? Their DATACENTERS REVENUES DECLINE BY 20%! Their PC revenues were HIGHER! It's because AMD sold that market share - 20% of Intel’s daracenter segment revenues is huge for AMD's revenues. PCs sold more because AMD's chips were sold out. Remember cannot get Zen3 Ryzen everywhere sold out so consumers buying the second best ...Intel.But TSMC's fab capacity was raised by 80% for AMD. EPYC Milan now fully available. You can imagine the revenues and Q2 guidance AMD's ER will report next week. In addition to yearly outlook RAISE from 37% to 50%+. Let's see. The contrast between AMD and Intel will move the PPS easily to $100+. ""The best is yet to come. .."" Dr. Su."
thank you ginney for moving out
Crossed 150. GO Big Blue!
"This is totally weird. Just keeps punching higher. I was going to cut it loose after the dividend payout, but like, it keeps legging higher. I would say I like their vision for the company, and they set high expectations for a return to growth in the second half."
well today was nearly as disappointing as my first performance with my high school girlfriend.
"FINALLY!! Now we can rally,......"
"IBM is not in the business of making machines, it is nota leader in any of the technology growth areas... I am looking to start a position strictly as a dividend play... hoping it drops to $105 area, so I can open a position"
"i don't get the selling over the past two days leading into the release of earnings tomorrow. I understand hedging, but this is acting like more than that (even a leak?). Anyway, I remain mildly confident IBM will ring in their third consecutive growth number with respectable earning growth as well. One more day......but I'm more worried than I have been."
This is one of the few stocks in this bubble market that missed and warned and did not go higher !they must have missed big !
we are gonna see many companies even if they are unrelated will interact each other because oof enormous amount of transaction datas eventually many mergers ladies and gentlement. IBM is top winner imo and 200 $ target is firs stop imo.
BOD 's playing pocket pool while the stock price sinks and Ginni is able to run the company into the ground like Immelt did to GE. Now GE under 11 dollars a share and no dividend consultant would
"Hey all. Still long $AMD via OTM Long Calls/Leaps I must say esp the OTM / Long Calls /Leaps remain quite resilient. But, I always wonder about SU joining the $CSCO BOARD...Esp with $CSCO ‘s recent announcement about the enormous growth n use on its WebX Platform- video conferencing Also NICE  on the $AMD Supply Agreement with $IBM"
"Double digits?  keep dreaming street urchins. If anything, I should thank you for pushing it under 110 so I could bring out the loader"
I expect imo IBM to raise their coming dividend.
"time for the RED HAT people too stand up and be counted,this stock will go quickly to $162.50 when these people start news briefs and go in front of wall street conferences"
Clue to where this is going tomorrow will be where it ends when AH trading is over. The premarket tomorrow will be even more exciting. I expect to see 150's in the first few minutes of trading tomorrow.
"must be ginny lost her Augusta golf membership ,for pretending she's a ceo"
IBM is mismanaged great deal. Still lot of overhead too many redundant workers and directors doing paper work to mandate work on others and bean counters over bean counters
i believe the target will continue to fall a dollar at a time.
"Looks like IBM moving in the right direction with Hybrid Cloud, AI, and SAP support!"
The only reason why IBM beats is because IBM fired their US/EU/CA employees last year to cut costs. Bad bad company that can only buy other companies rather then innovate.
"IBM biggest growth in India, where engineers cost 1/10 as much.h1b visas, has been boon for IBMh1 visa, allows IBM to bring in s/w engineer for $65k, undercutting most Americans.$65k h1 salary not changed in 20 yrs, classic arbitrage, corporate welfarism.if IBM replace American workers with aliens who work for 1/2, they're unlikely to recommend IBM equipment."
IBM will miss wall street targets when they report. stock expected to loose 4% in first qtr 2018..per JPM
"According to yahoo MSFT has 163K full time employees. Apple has 147K full time employees and IBM 352,600. Is this a joke or what? cut out the fat!"
IBM good ER should lift cloud software companies tomorrow. Let's see tomorrow which ones goes up with IBM. God Bless and stay well all.
Stock's under pressure again this morning. Thoughts? Still a good long term investment?
"Linus is open source , how IBM cloud will be competitive ? my humble question ."
"When IBM change their name to MBI, MBI currently green.Chapter 11 opportunity knock on IBM doors. As long as IBM is corrupted by all Indian managers, chapter 11 will come t knock on its door sooner than it expected."
125 in near term
"Now that IBM bought Red Hat, they should buy GE, JCP, and Sears and be an ETF of failed companies. After all, ETF stands for Exit, Terminate, Fail. It is sad because IBM was the best company I ever worked for back in 1963; except for the fact that it was in downtown Los Angeles."
how soon till double digits??....meanwhile fast talking dunderhead rometty is on tv again and the BOD all have their golden parachutes ready...it's incredible to watch....ibm is the next GE...INCREDIBLE

"The upgrade I read by RBC focused mainly on the new mainframe. Duh! All large businesses, globally, have mainfrmes and the new Z is better, faster, holds more dat, and CANNOT BE HACKED. Everyone will put in orders for that new $500,000 mainframe. The blockchain synergy is a door buster and that are #1 on AI. Wigth just ""outperform"" RBC targets $180.Based on fundamentals the current PE of 12 or so can easily go to 24, I am with those seeing the 2018 price at the $260 to $280 area, IBM has added some blockchain patents. If they announcd new blockchain applications, then there will be no top for this stock.My congratulations to all of patient IBM owners who have understood the potential of this turnaround."
"So, Who's holding for tomorrow's gap down?"
look at any chart. IBM stock is on a break-out.
buy buy
"As long as Ginny Rometty is on the IBM board this stock will continue to decline! Fire her from the board. Oh and don't forget to take away her 401K match just like she did for 300,000 IBM employees!"
"A haircut of 7.53% seems like an unwarranted overreaction to results that were disappointing but hardly disastrous. The turnaround is happening more slowly than investors would like, but IBM IS turning around. I agree with RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani who maintained a rating of outperform on the company and price target of 180 and wrote:""The stock is fairly attractive as we see the framework for a turnaround taking shape."""
Will settle around $142 soon. Glad I reduced my investment from 55% to 20 % few days back
"It's not a bad idea to buy some shares here, as the stock can skyrocket if they deliver solid results next month."
There are so many things wrong with this deal I dont even know where to start.
"IBM best stock, IBM BP and my GOLD!!!!!!"
Ginny can increase the stock by 10% tomorrow by just announcing her resignation. Hope springs eternal.
Bought additional stock yesterday. In for the long term and the great dividend
I added 1000 more from that level!
Last month was a good time to get in...
bottom line will be future revenue and earnings. another miss and expect further downside. imho
Will they increase dividend
"Have to admit IBM has been rock solid for the past month, over bought but no sellers.... short and at a loss......"
"Oh come on folks, stop loosing hearts. It is IBM man, it will never die. Haven’t you heard about quantum computing? Didn’t you know that most of the banks, especially the huge banks, use IBM complex solutions? Check the price history, this is the bottom!"
do my eyes deceive me or did IBM just break through 144. thank God for small favors
"Open source is the future. Always was, actually. The cloud, though, blew the door wide open."
"Too much debt and there are so many competitors in cloud business already also they are moving away from their known hardwares. I see share price ~$140 this quarter, may be lower."
50% illegals crossing the border have COVID per local Sheriff
IBM looks undervalued at this point. Had a hiccup on last quarter but it will get on track.
Big Blue taking it in the panties today! Reality setting in.
HANA upgrade is imminent and forced by SAP. Huge upgrade cycle - that alone will accelerate IBM moat into the Enterprise. AWS and MSFT just not in the Enterprise Space for the deep Process and vertical industry expertise.
"Pretty New Position For Me ($122) but I must say I never expected to look at my screen and say : IBM is my biggest 1 day gainer (+ %4) ... Ha, NICE !!"
Who would have thought Target would outperform IBM?!
WATCH $ibm using AMD's EPYC Rome in Cloud hybrid offering including AI so GPUs too. Just watch at 2hours 9 minutes time mark. This is hybrid $ibm strategy using epyc and GPUs. Not $intc nor $nvda. Security too. Coming in Q1 this year IBM said. IBM's results show cloud lifted the legacy business growing 23% with record $6.8 revenues in Q4. Guidance for 2020 cites cloud growth as major driver. This video shows how ibm will build its cloud with amd. Hybrid means at clients datacenters using VMWare together with ibm cloud for efficiency. Ibm isn't a leading cloud but super conservation hence certifying amd to all. Security especially but AI too using amd's GPUs. Bye intel and nVidia. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w-4S77RI7LE
another 16k+ coming soon on my dividends so I am not going anywhere. 64k a year on dividends is good enough for me. Bash all you want but I will still be here.
At a $1.57 dividend per share people should be lining up to buy this stock
Time for a BOD change
An honest poor person's opinion. I thought I needed to find a foundation in a good dividend stock. I chose IBM last week due to solid financials and good fundamentals and a fairly good PE compared to the tech stocks that I have been experimenting with over the years with all of my very little life savings. I am so glad that I chose IBM. Their partnership with AMD and Google on key projects and representation deals the long-term deal for me! Go IBM Go and thank you for the excellent dividend! Now if I could only one day pay off these student loans Haha!
Look at msft Azure cloud Q ER. Before Wal-Mart partnership. Look at their last Qs vs IBM. See?
Great time to add for those who are long-term investors. IBM is making some encouraging moves.
"RemoteMyApp adopts IBM Cloud to scale multi-platform gaming service1:28 PM ET, 03/21/2019 - PR NewswireIBM Cloud provides Vortex platform with scalability and strong performance for online gamers around the world on almost any deviceARMONK, N.Y., March 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Polish startup RemoteMyApp will adopt IBM Cloud for increasing global reach and scaling of its Vortex gaming platform.Vortex allows users to play games anywhere in the world on almost any device - smartphone, tablet, or smart TV –via the application, without downloading the game. As the platform has grown in usage and expanded to new markets such as Latin America and South East Asia, Vortex needed to scale its services, updates, and functionality to meet growing demand from players. Vortex turned to IBM Cloud to provide the global scale needed to provide a low latency gaming experience no matter where players are or what device they are using.IBM Cloud positions the Vortex platform to provide high performance computing service with GPU graphics cards. Using powerful servers hosted in several of the nearly 60 IBM Data Centers around the world, Vortex can handle an infinite number of players from all continents without any loss in efficiency or quality of services and with the lowest possible latency. With a game library available in the cloud, gamers will even play games on older devices because all of the processing, including graphics, has been transferred to the cloud.The growth of online gaming platforms turning to cloud is the result of two factors –a constant growth in the number of players and the increasing popularity of mobile devices. The Vortex deployment is just one of a handful of gaming industry clients like EA's Firemonkeys, Exit Games, and LiquidSky that recently adopted the IBM Cloud to deliver a gaming experience that is globally scalable and allows for quick product updates in a competitive market.""The gaming market is currently the fastest growing entertainment sector, and the sale of video games alone generates almost three times more revenue than the global film industry,"" said Andreas Hestbeck, CEO at RemoteMyApp. ""Our users live almost everywhere in the world and the subscriptions are growing every day - which is why we need IBM Cloud for reliable, global scalability.""""RemoteMyApp chose IBM Cloud as a collaborator in their digital transformation because we are dedicated to meeting customers where they are on their cloud journey whether they're a startup or have decades of legacy systems and need a hybrid cloud solution,"" said Przemyslaw Galinski, IBM Cloud Platform Sales Leader Poland and Baltics. ""We look forward to providing RemoteMyApp with the scale they need as they mature in this competitive, growing market.""Since its launch in 2017, Vortex has gained in popularity among cloud gaming platforms with more than 6 million users. With a monthly subscription model, players are granted 100 hours of gameplay and access to more than 100 games, including new releases. Unlike many other streaming platforms, Vortex does not require installing anything other than the application to access the library and choose a game.About RemoteMyAppVortex platform is a flagship service in the RemoteMyApp portfolio. Another service, Remotr, allows users to stream games installed on home PCs to any other device with Android and iOS, such as a smartphone, tablet or smart TV.

"Lots of people in here bashing IBM. Is it just lots of long term investors who are trying to break even here or people shorting this stock? Appears to me the future looks bright, you know they’re putting their best foot forward here. Good mix of growth and value. I got in at $122 and don’t see a lot to complain about yet."
This is good for my puts :)
With a forward PE of 10 and a Dividend of 4.8% and now RedHat driving revenue growth this is a good entry point. In 24 month IBM is conservatively at $185.
IBM capitalizing on BLOCKCHAIN around the world as companies approach them. Huge field - new growth.
Arvind Krishna will transform IBM like Satya Nadella transformed Microsoft. It is already happening...
"can't believe I'm saying this, but big blue starting to look real strong"
Why pulling back who know?
Can IBM compete with Amazon and Microsoft in the Cloud?
I love the dividend BUT Rommetty is IBM's IMMELT who almost bankrupted GE. It took the board years to see this. Ge now struggling to stay above 14 per share. IBM down again today. The BOD has become the companies worst enemy by its inaction
Big Blue with the Earnings Beat
"Absolutely love when you have a CEO that is failing and should be fired, and they go out and make a huge acquisition, always works great. Think of how it went for Hewlett Packard. #failedco"
Why didn't she announce this when they announce earnings....Probably would've rallied into the 150's
It seems BoD everywhere are failing in their governance. Tesla's BoD let's Elon walk the company off the plank. IBM's BoD lets Ginny rob the bank.
"It's painfully obvious what's wrong with IBM right now....Ginni is overdue for another performance bonus. Can we find another $30 million to say ""thanks""!"
"ibm needs to come up with what they do best, bs smoke & mirrors with catchy jargon like "" strategic imperatives "" & their signature moves in financial engineering where the create fictitious earnings figures on non gaap reporting.."
"IBM sales will sink to the bottom in the next year. The uncertainty around the split will kill them. IBM's traditional customers are large institutions who buy as part of a multi-year strategy, and buying from a company that will not exist anymore in a year's time is not going to be on the agenda."
"doubled here, i belive theres much upside potential, more than downward jmoh. Will not be getting much cheaper again anytime soon. As discussed earlier, the expectations are not 2 high, whats certainly in favour here."
"Wow. Huge buying opportunity here now. If you’re not buying IBM now, you just don’t like making money! Good luck all!"
"IBM, the originators of the IBM PC was based on many things that they invented. To name one, architecture. I think that if the development tools are still there, I would build a fast Arm chip and new PC system architecture. Combine that with the new software and I won't bother with HP, MS Windows, or Apple. IBM is a great new company!"
Never ever count out Big Blue. Fantastic things in IBM’s future. Fantastic things.
Can someone explain why IBM is a company worth investing in? Is it primarily because of the dividend yield?
In 14 months IBM will be a $158 stock. Accumulate at these valuations and take the 4% yield while you can.
"It would be delightful to see IBM return to the fray....By the time I started college, IBM was considered to be a has-been - I'd love to see it make a go of it..."
How many will get laid off in June?
"Woo hoo! Another down day. Frustrating in the beginning, but now it's a new norm for us bagholders"
I told you that Ginny would be replaced. This is the moment of the beginning of New Microsoft .
next week will be big jump
"If you are weak then by all means sell IBM. No guts, no glory."
Massive 6% div payout confirmed. Funds will load up for that yield. Back to $136
"For so many reasons this stock fits very well to invest. ""Undervalued, Hedge stock, new CEO, great dividends"". Everything is good about IBM."
Other runners already took off in the cloud race and IBM is now only starting to lace up those running shoes...
"in last 12 months, IBM cloud business generated $18.5 billion vs. ADBE $9billion; While ADBE market cap almost same as ADBE...This will be recognized by market players soon!"
"Ginni was in white house twice before. She will be interviewed side by side with Ivanka Trump from Davos by Maria Bartiromo tomorrow morning. Business & politics always BFF of each other. Expect IBM dominate business cloud market internationally in the years to come. Every cloud player except IBM moved up hugely, time to normalize"
NOT LONG OR SHORT IBM MIGHT NIMBLE IF DIVIDEND YIELD HITS 5%. BUT WITH THE CURRENT CEO IMO THIS IS DEAD MONEY. SURE MAKE A 4+ YIELD BUT VASTLY UNDERRF MARKET LONGTERM. LOOKING FOR YIELD? T AS AN EXAMPLE IS A BETTER PLAY IMO.
"I figure I'd go along with the six directors who bought between 100,000 and one million dollars stock to buy the post earnings dip... Reloaded a bit today"
"I heard HPQ is IBM biggest competitor in data security. NEW mainframe Z, I think is better."
"AMD's mkt cap. moments away from surpassing IBM's. Right is left, left is right."
IBM pays a 4.5% safe dividend. That alone will keep the stock price afloat.
"I can't believe that everyone is asking ""what is wrong with IBM""? If you haven't listened to the news, all companies have taken a hit due to the CORONA VIRUS that has invaded our county. Even the big boys are down. Pricing in the downturn is occurring because all businesses are being affected. Now's the time to buy. MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, IBM, among many others. I'm not a day trader. I buy low, reinvest their dividends and stay the course for the long run. Do that, and you will be a winner!"
"I can't believe that after 7 full years of consistent loss of revenue, marketshare and profit, Virginia Rometty is still the CEO. They need to FIRE HER!!! Let the RedHat CEO run the company!!!"
"On the way to 165 target. My target is 200 for the year. A bit more, but I like this move."
"IBM is good for a balanced portfolio - does an excellent job of offsetting gains of better performing assets, leaving you with zero cap gains!"
So Disney announces reorganizing and wall street loves it. Yet they are losing money in everything they do now with no end in sight as they go all in on streaming which they predict will lose money for next 2 years. And now they may cut dividend altogether. So who would rather own Disney instead of IBM? I will stick with IBM.

"IBM should be at $185 by now. It's now stabilized and starting to grow again, and the dividend is sweet at 4% and will keep going up. It was even recommended on Power Lunch again today. As the market goes up so will IBM. The only difference is that IBM is unvalued while the market is trading at record highs. As Cramer would say...Buy, Buy, Buy."
Buffett was right
Next stop $160 in the next 6 weeks.
"Growing 16% in cloud is not bad. CEO expects doubling Red Hat sales in 3 years. I am happy to wait while collecting dividend. It exhibits the same pattern as when MSFT CEO took over. The execution is on the right path and big improvement in communicating their offerings in their web site. More video, less text."
"### UP Over 1,100 % in 3 Months....AABB stock for AABBG Cryptocurrency...""-- newschain asia broadband ""--"
6 days ago I made a call of $166 year end target. I continue to stand by it. Cloud is gaining traction.
when is earnings?
"It would be difficult to vote the board and CEO out without the help of institutional investors, which I assume are as unhappy with IBM as retail investors. As retail investors we own a small amount compared to how the Board and CEO and the upper managers gobble up stock awards for ruining value and doing nothing. Until the big guys start screaming, IBM with just ignore the ""lil people""(I borrowed that quote from nancy pelosi). BUT if we ALL vote to remove the board, CEO and their boot lickers, MAYBE someone will pay attention and DO SOMETHING"
analysts sold investors bad advice
"Seriously, the entire IBM BOD AND CEO need to have their collective heads examined!!! What kind of idiotic name is that for the spinoff. Instead wasting their time coming up with some esoteric PC name for the spinoff, the talking heads need to figure out how to better their services/products to increase both top and bottom line. KYNDRYL will in time just die on the vine while the BOD continue to enrich themselves at employee and shareholder expense!!! Sooner or later IBM will ""surprise"" but in the long run, this is dead, dead money. Glad I got out last week ..."
Consolidation. Run to $132 right around the corner
"If IBM revenue was 1B instead of 75B, its share price would be around 300."
"It is shocking that Rometty is still at the helm, despite a record of failures rivaled only by GE..revenues, down profits down,debt up massively, and of course stock down. But great job on diversity...Long term holders of this former icon of US technology will hoist glasses of champagne when Rometty finally bites the dust as CEO."

This will be a 300 billion cloud computing behemoth in the next few years under Krishna leadership.
Time to sell IBM?
Eastman Kodac IOC and Global Blockchain companyBoth stocks are up large percentages.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BLOC.V/
"how many are losing on IBM,,, dont lie,,, i am in at 124, 1000 shares"
I’m losing faith in IBM
"Will touch 125 by Tuesday. Book it, remember this post"
"years from now people will be wishing that they could have purchased IBM stock for 153. the problem isn't IBM the problem is society. IBM is currently too advanced. quantum computing, blockchain (not cryptocurrency) , cognitive artificial intelligence, cloud etc. once the world catches up this stock will go to $300 a share or more very quickly and easily ."
"One thing that IBM having advantage over Amazon is that it will not compete with its customer. It is foolish for CEOs to use Amazon web services cause Amazon may get into banking, retail, medial, food , real estate, you named it. It may use its analytics and compete with customers of its own. Case in point is if a product is selling great by supplies, you is likely to see a prime porduct. Customers are shooting their own foot and IBM can win over Amazon web services with CEOs with foresight not to feed the enemy"
Did you short IBM? IBM is a stock you can short at any pop. Nice!
"Quantum Computing is a big thing in the future and IBM is a big player (and Google, Microsoft & Intel, I chose IBM). Be patient and you'll be paid back."
Taking my profits in AH
IBM is going to Kentucky fried chicken business
ER today?
Patient !
Why is it going up today after months...
"No matter if the stock is up 5, 10 or 20% IBM is finally making a huge comeback. Big Blue is the turn-around story of 2019."
100 shares gets you over 6 bucks in dividend imo it's a good deal
"""Intel may slash CPU prices in late 2020 to counter AMD’s Zen 3 chips""Not going to help against 7nm+ Zen3. It's showing desperate attempts but too big difference to use price cuts on. $intc going down and big navi doing same to $nvda. Plus $ibm cloud datacenters using EPYC and AMD's GPUs. .what more do you need? Just sell everything else buy AMD. https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-cpu-price-cut-2020/"
So much mygonistic comments here. I doubt being a woman helps her not being fired. Sad to see men’s unvaluable comments here. Expose arguments please instead of pure hate. You guys are better than this.
I realy like the 5 percent dividend
IBM has no resistance to $165...see you there soon.
i don't trust anything gin mill ginney had a hand in.
I think IBM cloud Pak is well designed and position well with large enterprises and controls and processes.
"IBM threw a curve ball. I am retired and needed some income so I increased my shares in T and added IBM. IBM is no longer the company it used to be. The business model is changing (not going into details as most know this already). I thought this is a good stock as the dividend is relatively high and IBM looks like it would continue to provide me a steady income with a growth potential. Honestly, when the stock goes up, it just makes me feel good but it really does not matter. As long as I need to hold the stock to get the dividend, these are paper gain only. This news on the 2nm chip is a game changer. The current most advance chip in the market is 5 nm. This is a leapfrog advance. The benefit is huge. The smaller wiring inside a chip would yield faster speed as the distance for the electrons to move is shorter. The wiring is smaller and it draws less power. The mobile device would last longer between charges. Chips are made from Crystal wafers. The yield on smaller chips would increase from the same size wafer. IBM’s new 2nm chip would beat all existing chips and the next chips that are schedule to be released by other manufactures. IBM could either contract manufactures to make this new 2 nm chip or licensed this technology. Either way you cut it, this is going to be a new revenue stream. I am lucky that I added IBM to my portfolio. I am not selling even with this gain as there is no other stock that has a good potential and pays me a decent dividend. Good Luck to All the Longs."
IBM chief digital officer seems like the man who understands the big picture and the pragmatic way. I think his ex global CEO background can help IBM growing the eco. system.
IBM has another ex-dividend date coming during first week of February which will be at $1.50 per share. Looking forward to a great quarter with earnings blow out and the upcoming ex-divvy date.
Does the news that IBM is partnering with Mercedes to develop this new battery excite anyone?
I figure that IBM gives it all back on earnings date. Has happened time and time again because the Street always seems to find something about the numbers they don't like. Plus management does not give guidance.
ibm should get a loan to make ingredients for covid like kodak
New CEO? Ginnie has not done a good job at this company. When was the last time IBM went up after earnings? I think once in the last 5 years. Ok board now is the time for a replacement.
IBM will be turned red by jim whitehurst (former Red Hat CEO)! Means deep company transformation.
I don't imho see why anyone would sell IBM at the current pps. Because imo the company is close to turning around and growing again. Best of luck.
Glad ceo enjoys his first amendment right....I used my right to sell all my shares..good luck
"You can take measure of a firm by the way it treats its employees. IBM's transformation is failing. When you rid yourself of experienced delivery resources with the spin that you are ""transforming"", by definition you are saying to the market that you're unable to close business. This is a vicious circle. The more that IBM pushes to pivot through lay offs vice re-training resources, the less palatable the firm is in the eye of the employee...the less loyalty to the firm...resulting in inability to compete. Sad."
"IBM is the of defensive stock that can grow and yet continue to earn money from long term contracts even eco. is lagging. On a risk adjusted basis, it should be valued a lot higher because of its moat. The turn around is on the mark and ready to sprint forward."
"If it stays above 140 for the rest of this week, it'll never see 120s for the rest of this year"
"Didn't 15 cloud cacklehead Rometty say that RHT would add 200 basis points to their bottom line? Doesn't look like this is going to happen anytime soon. Or maybe she wants to stay on for another 10 years, until the stock price is in single digits."
"Can we make IFANG a thing... IBM, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google. This will really help out my IBM position."
"Call in the cleaners to remove Ginny, her low life executive staff and a lot of the do nothing middle managers."
We finally turn corner with Beamer? I like 175
$140 target price
expect a better fight around 132... short are still strong...
As far as blockchain goes..there are already companies exploiting it..not just IBM. So if you think this is going to save the company like they claimed Watson would...you really need to read up on it. Im not short IBM.
"Classic example of a company that chose PC criteria over ability. She was in over her head from the beginning and was promoted based on gender and not ABILITY.

IBM on breakout watch. 180s in a week
Hopefully in the morning we can flip institutional shorts that have been holding this down
i will buy ibm in the next few wks its on my list
I think I'll add a few shares @5% div yield..
im a buyer at $149 after earnings miss!
just heard the talking head on cnbc say...shrinking to grow. 
IBM's promise of net zero emissions ties in nicely with its net zero growth. More political correctness destroying the company.
"Total herd mentality here...stampeding back and forth between AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA...buy at any price.On the other side of the coin...IBM. Stuck at one of the lowest PE's in recent memory and unable to grow revenue or earnings.Lesson learned the hard way...paying back shareholders with buybacks and dividends does not really work!"
"This is a fake rally, nobody wants to buy IBM. Short IBM back to $120 then $70. Nice!"
"Great couple of days for IBM so far, hope the upward trend continues."

Earnings out July 31 (Tuesday) well before us market open. Will be interesting to hear if they discuss how vctrade is doing so far (didn’t open until this month so no numbers from last quarter) and overall business lines.

"who in their right mind would own shares of IBM? 1 year return is -12%, and 5 year return in -1 percent. What in God's name are you longs doing?"
Please sell ibm if you don’t have the patience to wait. Ibm will be $145 or higher at end of year.
Nice move up!!! Lets hope it continues.
IBM has the supremacy both in Blockchain and Quantum computing. they are basically the future of banking and smart contracts
"Need a CEO based on merit, not political correctness."
Does a corporate tax rate of 20% help IBM bottom line? Added $3B to its buyback program does not sound like a company in trouble but a company with its stock price too low. Just seems shorts got freaked out and had to push this below $150 to settle. I see $180-$200 price targets on this stock... Warren Buffett said at this price he may add to his position but $180 is a sell point last time he analyzed the stock. But if tax breaks get pushed even 1 year out with this dividend over 10 years you should make out like a bandit!
Whole system stock market needs massive thousands of points sell off here. We are that over priced. Blame the FEd/Europe both playing games with below market /negative rates to chase investors into stock market to hold them up. THey are extremely over priced period here. I see 2 to 3 thousand points sell off here easily. Send that message no more manipulation of markets with lowering rates period.
"Jump in, last chance, earnings on 10/16, don’t delay"
it's time to buy
Wow the trolls are more SOUR then usual today. Jealous much?
if your short..ya better cover
"Anyone else concerned that MSFT and Amazon are investing in blockchain tech? Just got in at 142.9 here, hope they get their act together."
I don't understand why IBM couldn't have built a Red Hat from scratch for way less than $34B.
"Nothing like being ""over exuberant"" and then reality check smacking you head on ... typical IBM, just can't handle those ""nose bleed"" levels ... yet here I am, still holding and hoping ..."
"I’m curious guys. I’m not overly familiar with IBM, but i believe palantir was given some credit for good earnings??? Any insight into that?"
"The rommetty strategy formed by former CEO of GE, Imelt, who took GE to the edge of bankruptcy before the BOD got rid of him.. ACT NOW BOD before IBM ends up like GE. The BOD wont act until many of the BIG players start to get on them about getting IBM back on track."
like I stated 3 months ago on this board when IBM was 141...it would not stick and fall into the low 130s. ..which it has. the dividend is the only thing keeping people from leaving the stock in droves. the argument that you can hold and collect the dividend only makes sense if 1. your cost basis is low and 2. they don't cut the dividend
IBM still exists!
Buffet was wrong about IBM. Check Buffet's results. He is making about 5% less than S&P500.
took a cold bath today with IBM ...Internally Broken Mess
alright with adding at 112.05 at close. Long hold for income and growth.
Spinning off a division into a new company where exist shareholders get equity. Nice!
"When the market rallies, IBM goes down or does not rally as much. When the market tanks- it tanks harder. Need fundamental change at the leadership level like MSFT a few years back"
Hopefully they increased the results without the ole balance sheet gimmicks of past years.
IBM stock price target cut to $144 from $165 at CFRA
Fast Money fails to recognize that IBM is now a leader rather than a laggard.
"Donnie Pugatch, is adding to his IBMposition."
"since 2013 (8 years) this stock has been in a steady downward trend. that is a very long downtrend for such an old established company. its fortunes are statistically bound to change soon. i see this as a long term buy from this point on. it may never get back to 170, but it could very easily see 145 again in the near future. good divvy while you wait. just my opinion"
I'm wondering who just bought $61MM worth of IBM?
This stock will find strong support at 145-150. Fundamentally its becoming very attractive. Going from a year with YoY Revenue declines to growing revenue neglecting currency headwinds. This will drift to $170 by next ER.
"Market realizes this will be a failure and probably the end of it:- in cloud, IBM is too late and has become irrelevant, the gap with MSFT, AWS, GCP and even AliCloud is too wide to bridge unless they come with an entirely new model and I don't see them doing it.- They resulting companies will be too small to stay on the DOW, maybe the cloud one can go on NASDAQ, maybe, but they will loose a lot of institutional investors. The unwinding will soon start.- This services company has no chance to survive, today they are not profitable and I have the feeling they other part will want to dump all the old corporate dinosaurs in there. - What are they going to do with their HW division, they have a significant storage, power and mainframe business, if they dump it in the services company it will die if they keep it in the cloud company they will continue to compete internally. This whole thing is a desperate move to nowhere."
One could make higher returns owning Tesla for a few days than IBM for 10 years.
"Palantir partners with IBM - “There's no question that this is the largest partnership that we've done,” Palantir’s COO Shyam Shankar told Yahoo Finance Live.The partnership will dramatically expand the reach of Palantir’s sales force while giving the data analysis software company access to IBM’s commercial customers in 180 countries. As part of the partnership, Palantir is adopting IBM’s RedHat OpenShift, allowing it to run anywhere in the hybrid cloud."
"If you didnt vote your shares to get rid of this board,,,dont complain about them."
getting closer to recovering where we were a year ago. More lean and better positioned. 
If someone outbids for RHT wouldn't IBM make something off the deal? That would be hilarious to see $IBM be end up becoming the middle man and make money from making a deal like this.
Oxford Club says buy IBM for trading portfolio. Nice write up for IBM by Alexander Green.
IBM's turnaround will begin 1Q2018. Earnings will beat and revenues will increase for the 1st time in 22 quarters. This will gap the price ip $20.
"Use your voting power and get rid of Ginny and her board before its too late. She has had 6 years and all we have seen is BLOATED incompetent managers, lower revenue, stock prices and layoffs. TIME FOR A CHANGE! If the board takes no action, VOTE THEM OUT at proxy time!"
"Holding 400 shares since ‘96, time to start trimming position? Hurts to see it next to my other tech picks"
I'm close to the end of my ropes with this company. It just legs down with every bull run. From 200s to 160s to 120s. Is this the next leg lower to 90s?
"IBM going to $ 200 per share. Sustainable software side is accelerating so means bigger margins and increasing sales (1st time in 22 quarters) and, Buffett going to finish selling his shares soon which is holding down the stock, otherwise we would already have been at $ 190 per share, since earnings growth was very good in Q3. Also money going to switch from high valuation tech stocks to cheaper tech stocks like IBM."

IBM has dropped from $153 to $124 in less than a month. That is almost five years worth of your precious dividends right there.
Fire Ginni! Way overpaid for RHT. Should've used the money to shore up its existing cloud and AI business and reduce debt!
IBM $93 by mid Dec....Jim Rogers

"California dreamin, the Techs will suffer sooner or later from thsi deprssion $AMD $NVDA $IBM"
IBM pays a great dividend. I rather buy this than most of the overvalued stuff out there that is ready to crash and pays no dividend. Value will be appreciated again.
Is it possible to see somewhere how many IBM shares (at least in %) Buffet still owns?
"IBM acquisition of RH means it will be #1 in the hybrid cloud market, and, as Ginny says, 80% of the potential market is not on the cloud. This will jump IBM far ahead of AMZN and add substantial synergy to IBM products and services. RH has had accelerating revenue. The stock market does look ahead 12 months when the RH becomes strongly additive to IBM revenue and net income.The stock should move quickly back to the $150+ area."
"Sentiment remains poor here, as IBM, like CSCO, is just seen as outdated tech. Will the new CEO be able to bring back growth here, led by aggressive pushes into the cloud and AI? That’s the question. If they can get the top and bottom lines to start growing again, positive sentiment for the stock will return, and the shares will trade much higher. Will this happen? Will the new CEO orchestrate a turnaround like MSFT did? What do y’all think?"
"IBM split themselves in another company. The company still haven’t a name defined and is so called as NewCo. NewCo will compete with TaTa Consulting and others companies for support services. NewCo is set to be the major company in the industry in terms of valuation. IBM will focus in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. IBM CEO Arvin wrote a letter to Biden this week and the flavor of subjects were in the order of Quantum Computing, Diversity, 5G and Cloud, and technology. ...However, IBM is a big white elephant that move slowly"
"The BOD is failing to do its fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders. ALL stock grants and bonus money should be halted TODAY until IBM starts showing growth again. ALL senior C suite managers should have their pay take a quarterly % haircut, just like the shareholders have have had to each quarter. No more free options and bonuses for poor performance and loss of market share. IBM has a bloated bureaucracy with more middle managers that do nothing but add cost than people who actually get work done and produce product."
I'd laugh my ___ off if the doom and gloomers expected a decline and instead IBM popped 
"IBM earning call was very upbeat. CFO repeatedly said ""the best in years""."
250 shrs but trying to add along the way.
Buffett guessed right
Anyone who is short after a day like today deserves to lose money.

"There's NO WAY ibm allows these guys with confidential info about ibm to move unless a tight partnership with AMD is coming! Read who Brad McGredie was at ibm. Cognitive systems! I.e. the AI stuff $ibm promoted with Watson. They used $nvda and $intc before but no more! Remember this is coming this quarter. Amd's pps jumping very high when such revealed! How is it ibm leaves an entry of Brad in its web if it wasn't a mutual planned move? We must take advantage of the shorts and manipulation ahead of the ER and buy AMD. Buy shares or leaps calls options or sell puts even. All win. Remember Apr 2018 I've posted here.. bought myself. Now this is it! Don't be like @Renee missing it and she won't forgive herself ever. Now here's another chance. Remember this post. Ignore shorts, charts TA etc as they have acted in Apr 2018.https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/author/brad-mccredie/"
"not to over simplify, but they will get it right. Give it more time. They said the same ""give up"" talk about Microsoft and other old tech names. I am a buyer at these levels and adding to my position. I am not opposed to a change in management. Perhaps I am overly optimistic, but even GE finally showing some life today after earnings. I was not a Jeff I. fan. He was a very misleading CEO. Ginny??????"
Still printing money. Overreaction to a one time tax hit. Great time to get in cheap
They have more block chain patents than any other company in the world. Buffet doesn't understand the value of BC so he bailed. In 2 years you will be glad you ignored him.
"Volume is normal, no news and still a good dividend. As someone noted below, this is probably the move down that didn't happen yesterday. Need to give new CEO another year to see if the hybrid cloud is the savior of this company. I have been in it for a couple of years now and written calls against while collecting the dividend. Seem like a solid quarter could return this easily into the $140's. String together several solid quarters and $160's seems achievable. Just my opinion and the dividend and call writing provides enough return to wait this out several more quarters before throwing in the towel....IMHO"
is better buy now or waiting a correction?
Pattern is up inch by inch then big pull back.....time for the pull back
what caused ibm to jump today?
Cramer will manipulate this stock and say it's a buy. It's done hold onto that nice dividend for the rest of your life. Better dividend stocks out there.
"THE BOD is not performing their responsibilities by removing a inept CEO who 's tenure has proven itself a reckless strategy. IF earning fall short again this qtr..look for IBM to fall below 130. Im not a short, nor do I want IBM to do bad BUT 8 straight qtrs of declining revenue says a lot about the direction and CEO competency."
This will become dominant players in blockchain solutions in few years. red hat has all open source blockchain projects going on.
Anybody what do you think the future holds for IBM if Joe Biden gets elected?
Going long!
"tomorrow it will go to 125 ..... excellent report , just read the bottom line !!"
I see only one positive Valueline maintains it in its Dividend Portfolio. But even Valueline is losing chl a strong buy at $50 4 others a failure. They also kept Boeing until it hit $90 then said we were selling it as it fell. They just didn’t tell investigators. IBM I think will be in the same boat. Bad mgmt decisions
"where are all these nut cases coming from? swapping the board with trash, can't carry on a decent conversation"
look for IBM to break $130 next few days
"wow, finally a green day, it reaches 121....do you want to bet what's the close price for next Monday"
"Did people really expect revenue to go up in the 2020 COVID 3rd Quarter? It met expectations. It didn't miss and it drops 6%. They have tons of EPS. Pay a great dividend, low PE. Nope, I'm going to by some overinflated company that is priced 10 years into the future."
"If you want to be in Blockchain, IBM is the best and safest stock to hold. Their technology is real and they have patents out. If you believe like some that Blockchain is the biggest thing since the Internet, IBM is currently a steal. The current cryptocurrency mess is simply a pyramid scheme. You are risking losing all your money on them. Blockchain is not just about cryptocurrencies, it's much more and if you do your research you'll see that IBM will probably be one of the biggest winners."
Will be in the green in A/H. Cloud is shining!! I won't sell my shares not below $200!!
Yikes ibm is taking off... hate to be short...
Morgan Stanley said that the best 12 month pps target for IBM is 180. I respect them so i believe that we fall somewhere in the middle 155 or so. Management has a good plan they just need time to execute it. Value stocks imo will make a comeback in time. Adding to my position on dips.
What? No new 52 week lows today? What's going on here
And the sharp V back up started... Remember AMD's huge ecosystems in gaming and cloud too! $ibm is VERY motivated to work with AMD not $intc nor $nvda ! IBM already has offered exclusively bare metal cloud using new high clock frequency EPYC Rome chips! Look at ibm's new CEO talking about Cloud.. ! AI etc ... it's all with AMD!
"xerox, lucent, kodak, GE, and IBM is next"
"IBM may be a slow pig - but a couple of facts are relevant here.1. IBM is only months away from becoming a dividend aristocrat. 25 years straight dividend increases2. Even if free cash flow drops THERE IS NO WAY that the BOD will break this streak3. Thus the dividend is safe... and its currently yielding more than 6%4. IBM does not make (much) stuff … thus it has no supply chain and factory problems5. 80% of IBM's staff already, / or is fully capable of working from remote so there are no ""closures""6. The whole world is learning from corona that moving ""online"" and ""Remote"" is functional7. as such the whole ""cloud"" IT landscape will grow dramatically as this corona issue is resolved8. IBM will resultantly capture a portion of this post corona business - as its deeply supported INSTITUTIONAL sized clients up their game and their needs for support from IBM. 9. with all the millennials, and GIG economy, and service industry employees, - circling the unemployment offices like buzzards.... they will not be buying their ""fashionable"" new Iphones - and APPLE will fall hard as it hugly misses earnings for several quarters straight..- those investors will be looking for other post corona economy safer stocks.10. Ginny is gone - ..nuff said AS SUCH, THERE IS NO REASON to think that IBM will at least recover rapidly( when the virus dies) to pre coronal levels of ~$150 -- that and the juicy dividend will pull support. Also as Aristocrat status is achieved IBM will get added to funds and computer trading algorithms that trade in aristocrat stocks - that will boost volume.Strong Buy and hold at this time - continue to buy the dips till corona passes"
Remember when everyone was celebrating after it exceeded 150?
Does anyone know how much revenue RHT got from IBM? I would assume there is a fair bit of overlap where IBM is having RHT included in it's contracts. This double booked revenue will disappear now going forward.
"IBM may go to 1,000."
$50 point jump in stock when Ginny given walking papers
I think this company and stock is going to follow in the footsteps of GE. And keep shrinking year after year.
Which smart private equity will buyout IBM and break it apart?
next election .vote your shares to remove the bod. none of us have enough votes but collectively we can send a message and hope those who are the big money players pay attention and are as frustrated with the bod and this horrible ceo to join us.

"GE was run into the ground after 9 years with Immelt. he RUINED the company and the board allowed him to do it. Now GE is 18 per share. IBM will follow the same road unless the BOD replaced Rommety SOON! JPM was correct ..the stock has now sunk to under 150 and per their guidance, IBM will touch a 52 week low before years end. Thats troubling!"

"Old Warren does not understand blockchain and that is why he is out of IBM. Bitcoin is not the future of blockchain, as a matter of fact blockchain's future is not currency centric. Bitcoin is like the AOL, Napster, Myspace, or Lycos of today, names that became completely irrelevant where they once where the innovator and leader of their space. IBM is one of the best longterm blockchain investments."
So WEC you say there are thousands of better places to put your money. Can you give me a few suggestions. Thanks.
Over $140 tomorrow. Easy.
Anybody have any clue why IBM is down with the market up over 500.

Looks like IBM lost the race to quantum supremacy also. Another feather on Ginny#$%$.
Ibm job cuts means the company is cutting the fat. Aggressive determination to win.
"Well done Ginny and IBM executives, another successful day. A new 52 week low on a day that the markets are jumping forwards, congratulations. It's clear now for everyone that your strategy is working."
While IBM is issuing fluff PRs about collaborations and partnerships that have no financial value Mayo clinic signs a contract with Google to use GCP as their cloud and their AI. Shows who is the leader and who is the talker.
People scoffed at the idea that IBM paid 10x revenues for Red Hat. Look at the multiples that people are paying for software stocks now. It doesn't seem like such a bad deal anymore. The biggest thing IBM got in the transaction was a change of culture. I think the new CEO is the right man at the right time to get the job done for the future.
"Let's face it. This is a $160-170 stock. I would not be surprised to see it back at $155 before the week is out. A steal at any price under $150. I estimated the stock to be worth about $162 back in November 2016, and have never changed my opinion. That shows that this stock could experience an improvement of 10% from these prices."
div 
4.5% dividend on a money making stock with a P/E of 14 is really hard to resist. IBM seems to be heading into all the right markets. Today looks like a great opportunity.
Initiated position last week $117-$118. She could go up $5 or down $7-$10. My best guess
IBM needs to focus on AI tech and the hybrid cloud industry. If they can do this we will be better off!
Yahoo managed to make these message boards useless. I'm gone.
Well I wrote more NAKED CALLS today because I can't see Ibm going through 121 by friday
"When I question some of my investments, once in a while it pays off. Although the market is down pretty good today, I'm not hurting very much. Diversifying really is key"
The BOD has breached its fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders of IBM by allowing Rometty to endanger the companies future by her latest gamble paying a HUGE premium to acquire red hat which may or may not fit into the IBM culture of over bearing middle management and red tape. IBM has NOT been very successful int he past integrating companies. This merger/acquisition is truly high risk since IBM's OS adventures in the past have failed outside the mainframe. The Board must go! Vote your shares during the next proxy to unseat this board!
Did they even bother to run this acquisition by Watson?I seriously doubt he would have approved.Sad...……..
IBM longs taken to the cleaners again !
It's been over a year since IBM acquired Red Hat and it's beginning to look like IBM is doing what is does with all it's acquisitions....letting is die while red hat goes thru the extreme and lengthily bureaucratic nightmare IBM is notorious for.
"The problem with the push into value stocks is that they aren't values. The P/Es and debt levels are too high given reasonable growth rates, not the pie in the sky predictions Wall St. is engaged in at the moment. The entire market is tweaking on speed. I, mostly, trade covered calls and puts, and have a feeling this will be a traders market for the next two years as it trades in a narrow range, held down with the tremendous corporate and government debt. Congress should have been more targeted in its stimulus bill, and shouldn't have dropped money out of the sky, and should have put it towards projects that create jobs and improve infrastructure. The low inflation info. that came out doesn't match my experience as a shopper. The grocery store near me, has away fewer sales and coupons on items, and gas has almost doubled in So. Cal.. Wall St., also, is not factoring in rolling Covid outbreaks, going forward. Covid is not over. It will be less pernicious, but will keep impacting the economy for years."
reliable dividend 5.6% attractive entry price levelprice appreciation 20% a year that should be around 26% price appreciation.
Ginni is the greatest technical mind of our time.
"Bold move will have bold implications. IBM waited till RHT plunged with market to make its move at a small premium to previous RHT high. Strong dependable cash flows will rapidly decrease debt and ultimately lead to dividend increases down the road. IBM investing for long term investment success, not for myopic short term speculators. Buying IBM in $120 range is a superb opportunity. When market turns, IBM will regain $150 in short order."
Will IBM sell its 2nm technology to TSM? Save TSM researchers a lot of trouble to find by themselves.
"what is going on that IBM cant go up, ROKU up another 20 and IBM is dead, i have no explanation what is going on, even Bitcoin now $23,000 insane or is it the new norm and IBM is finished because the new generation has taken over and the Dow stocks are now dead or should i say IBM is dead"
IBM is a growth stock now. It has a story and its going to $200. Never mind revenue and earnings and all that stuff. It doesn't matter for growth stocks.
"I will be happy how to see how the companies that the haters inside here see how the revenue fall x10 more than this -1%, I think IBM is a well company, position on AI, clouding and the PE ratio is 14.2, much lower than hippe Trend companies. Anyway good for me I add some stocks on the deep :)"
"its still strange to me THAT NOBODY is talking about IBM divesting itself into TWO separately traded companies - nor speculating on what this will do to their investment or their position,,,, READ UP and please post some relevant thoughts --- talking about SAM and GINNY (although they sucked rocks) - is not the current issue for today ---- seriously do you all know this is going to happen??? and soon !!!!"
"Nice bump for the shareholders here, it was about time. I'm not a holder, but I think next year's server will be something to look forward to."
Like IBM and buying ACM rocket
There's a reason why the dividend yield is high. The stock is like a bond. You lose money with bonds.
"what do you think of IBM stock tomorrow, at open and close ?"
Down again and again
"I like this for a long hold, dividend has always increased every year for decades now. Back to 200$ slowly"

"I hope IBM is next to follow Exxon and exit DJI and also get away from the current MM's, Hedge funds and Institutional crooks who for some reasons are going out of their ways to whitewash all of IBM achievements and holding their share price as low as possible in order to deny IBM capacity to raise capital by issuing new shares to either reduce the corporate debt load and or to buy complementary technology companies to increase their competitiveness. I hope sooner or later IBM and SEC investigate this matter and take some action. Maybe it will be a blessing in disguise just to exit the DJI and may be NYSE! JMHO..........Tex"

Fire the CEO!
"Even though we all agree it’s for the better ,, its still kind of sad to see Ginni go,, she should at least be given credit for some of the new business direction . Ginni was the big believer in Cloud and data analytics , unfortunately other companies beat her to the punch.. "
Buffett sold all his IBM Shares... that's sad because Buffett never sell stocks unless he thinks the company is heading the wrong direction.

IBM should be bought at this price level aggressively!
"bought a boatload for my IRA ... buy here and forget it ... before you know it, it is back at 120s and you get the nice dividend. RedHat alone is worth at least half of IBM's market cap."
More downgrades coming?
Time to buy is NOW not after the big rebound! WHAT to buy? Not $nvda not $intc not $mu not $ibm not $tsla ... ONLY AMD! Do it ahead of the ER today for max gains as tomorrow you'll pay more if you buy with the herd...

Wonder who will be targeted, and how they will do it (hide it).

Mass murder."
"Best hope is for an activist to shake things up.....Rometty is past normal IBM retirement age, but young enough soshe will be hard to remove."

"Everyone needs to balance the profits by yearned , IBM is the best candidate for it"
XL C and IBM Java on every machine? Oh it's going to get monopolistic.
It is really sad to watch a once great company die by a thousand cuts.
"Any ideas what happens to the dividend when IBM divests the 19 billion dollar GTS business into ""NewCo"" - expected to happen before the end of this year (tick tick ticking).. Keep in mind that anyone still holding here will then magically have shares of both companies. - will the dividend be split between the two publicly traded entities - with each paying what they believe to be appropriate??- will NewCo even have a dividend ?? - most new age tech companies don't pay one.-Will IBM then just cut its dividend - as the remains of IBM will be only half of the cash machine it was before the split ??- will IBM automatically then loose it Dividend Aristocrat status ?? (A status which is also driving the current price)There is NO DOUBT that the current dividend and ratios are a part of what is holding up the current share price... So what happens if the dividend goes away or is decreased (across both OldCo & NewCo) and then all of the funds and holders that hold IBM for ""income"" bail out.. in search of safer and better yield dividends.Setting aside corporate profits, strategy, management, directions of BOTH future companies..... I seriously believe the Dividend is in some sort of serious jeopardy here..... and this factor ALONE can drive a major change in ownership/volume/price.thoughts???"
I think the OCT report will put IBM in the 130S-Red Hat and new team will get big BLUE or should I say big RED moving.
"Remember this is all about fully understanding the TECHNOLOGY and how competition is like in this area. Complex yes. Not just TSMC and Global Foundries or even Samsung fabs vs Intel. It's about the ecosystem of software, applications, developers partners and even the ability of the CEO to form personal relationships with customers and partners and Wallstreet outside and employees inside. Yes not easy at all. But reviewing $intc $nvda $mu and giants like $msft $ibm $goog $fb etc, the focused highly growing technological advanced and trusted CEO is AMD only in my view. Do your own due diligence. If you don’t understand the technology you're investing blindly sorry. Not about analysts or posts here or articles on Seekonk Alpha or CNBC or Cramer. You must be deeply in the know personally to be long in AMD. Good luck all!"
bought Aug 130 call last friday. it is going to be fun tomorrow
I still think IBM will go under ... $0
How do you feel about IBM splitting company into two? Is that good for the stock owning a share in each?
"Pretty in line, 1.3% earnings beat, 1.5% revenue miss, on track to see what the Red Hat acquisition will do for them. To me doesn’t mean that this innovating, cutting edge company is worth any less. So they have a shrinking legacy business, we knew that already."
This is going to 200. Undervalued stock.
Warren Buffet might come back to buy IBM. AAPL is dropping

You might expect this reckless kind of money spending on a risky acquisition from a small cap bio-pharma stock. But a mega cap IBM? Risk controls anyone?
Coffee delivering drones??? This must be a major business opportunity for IBM. Congratulations IBM on being the first technology company to seize upon this outstanding business opportunity overlooked by all the other technology companies. I wonder who will be named the VP of Coffee Delivery Service. Could GR also assume this role??Good God what has happened to this once leading edge company.
Just a simple question please. Why CEO doesn't retire? Ginni is 61 breaking a long tradition of changing at IBM's top position at 61. She had 6 years and no sign of big revenues rise compared with competition during the time. Actually business got smaller and now major cuts in the workforce even the Watson health crown jewel. Not only Ginni has to go but all her sr exec team mismanagement IBM's strategy. How long she plans to hold on to her position for? I sold all my shares at $146. Took lose from $195 but there are way better investments out there.
I think good quarter with red hat! Sticking around another month
"wow,,,nice pop,, i think Morgan Stanley should be investigated for the so called down grade, they had no business with a down grade besides they wanted it down for someone, so its a scam they pulled, GO IBM"
It’s going red. Market and IBM stock is up too much. It was bound to correct no matter what the earnings were.
"IBM will be in great position of they would be good at execution. this is no longer about what need to be planned rather they have all the tools to on board application and private clouds into theirs and become another platform similar to what Amazon or google offers, and red hat should provide them the reach"
at least the bid/ask is close today means there is some support at this price level I believe for IBM
Come on IBM you're ruining my covered call strategy. You're supposed to go sideways - not up.

"IBM is becoming the next AT&T, stagnant, no vision, complacent and no growth. Hopefully the break up will move this ship."
Today was a disaster except for the last half hour. If that trend continues we should open well above $120 in the morning. The volume today looked like a bit of panic selling. Maybe that will turn to panic buying tomorrow. It should at this low price. The Bollinger bands are wide apart with the lower one being at $115 so there is only a 10% chance it will go much lower.
How $ibm is up 2.5% and ibm needs amd partnership for their new ceo strategy in cloud...? Think about it! Other semis should be red but amd is different will be deep green as the markets.
"Employees should be nervous, the only way IBM can recover is by cutting OH..

They are making decisions based on desperation and buying projects to try and keep the staff busy."
big blue shall rise from the ashes
IBM has debt of $71B and cash $10B. Anything exciting for leadership products or simply a dividend play stock.
When will the CEO be fired?
"Buffet has sold a large chunk of stock which accounts for the weakness. Maybe he has sold the balance of his position and it will be in the next report. Frankly, this is good news. No more stock to sell. Now, EPS reports are increasing."
"Interesting that one does not see the BUNCH companies much anymore: Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data and Honeywell in the technology space. Unisys (Burroughs + Sperry) are still in the mainframe space and have technologies that far surpass the IBM mainframe platforms, but the big-iron market does not exist anymore. It is sad because companies are paying a lot more for the ""new technology"" than they old mainframes, but nobody knows that. lol. It is called progress. All the banks and insurance companies and airlines and govt departments have IBM mainframes and to get off them will cost a fortune. So IBM will always be around, but like Unisys, they will be facing declining revenues."

We are seeing some hope after a very long time!
Doesn't matter if it drops. Invest long term and collect dividends for years to come

I've done very well with IBM the past 12 months selling covered calls and collecting nice dividends. I hope there's a much needed and healthy correction soon for the whole market of 10 to 20%. I think IBM will fall 1.5 times the averages and I will buy a lot more! But I think it's too risky before then to put new money in.
"The new IBM CEO is a real genius, he thinks he will cut a rotten apple in 2 and the result will be 2 good apples."

"IBM is my favourite stock, will start buying under 115 and buy more every time it drops 2 dollar in price until 100."
WOW $tsla lost over half its recent top value. $intc $nvda $mu $ibm all lost a third of their recent highs! But only amd has better fundamentals and reconfirmed outlook last FAD confirming no much impact from corona seen and actually higher demand than forcast for datacenters that more than balance the consumers side. So actually a beat for Q1 and same outlook or beat for this year! Remember amd has disclosed yesterday its mobile processors 7nm APUs specs including desktop level performance in a laptop flagship 4900H and 4900HS! Microsoft gave the specs of the xBox X especially the raytracing rDNA 2 GPUs! More products coming. . Big Navi and 7nm+ datacenters Arcturus GPUs and Zen3 7nm+ EPYC Milan and Ryzen 4000 ! Yes even threadripper 4! Are you kidding me? AMD is the ONLY semi to own!
It's up on solid volume-KEY.
I was hoping IBM would stay under the 150 mark until I get my money for selling my house. I only got 190 shares
"Wow, this has moved up nicely recently. Looking forward to next earnings so it get's knocked down its usual peg or two."
"ok, I have owned IBM for a couple years at a cost basis of 159. Obviously have not been happy with the performance. My thought is that this old tech ship has made the turn in the right direction. Hence planning on adding to my position down here. Dont want to regret after earnings, but looks like a beat projected coming up again. Any constructive thoughts or analysis on this ? Good luck all longs !!!!"
Nobody is interested in IBM even THE Warren Buffet the smartest investor of the century also selloff IBM. Get out before it goes down under $100 and chap11 filed.

The true price of this stock is somewhere around 60.
"From Zacks today: IBM (IBM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."
"After IBM hits 250, it will make a beeline to 500 and beyond. This is IBM 2.0. Investing in the future. Arvind Krishna and Jim Whitehurst leading the way in AI and hybrid cloud technology."
According to FactSet IBM’s free cash flow came in at $2.3 billion which declined to 2001 levels. A business model with a multi year record of declining revenues is a losing proposition not to mention the chart looks horrible. I guess the dividend looks appealing but so do bank stocks - another dead end investment. As the old saying goes never fall in love with a stock. Time to move on from IBM ...

IBM going to $155. There's a gap on the 1 year chart that needs to be filled at $155 and that's where the 50 day moving average is. I'm a buyer at $155.
imagine if the company declared not paying dividends ?
"Even if RHT revenue is up by 20%, and I don't really believe this, I think it has more to do with accounting rather than real growth, but even if ... it still only covers 15% of the hole created by the drop in IBM's legacy business. IBM is loosing $4b topline per year, 20% of RHT roughly $600M. They would need 7 RedHats to drive growth. Not going to happen. And as said, I would not be surprised if part of the growth is accounting driven."

Stop drinking the marketing bluff that keeps changing every 2 years without any proof of real product deliveries (it was IOT, Analytics, cloud, then AI, now blockchain is being deprioritized). Failures in all of these."
The ‘bet the company’ comes down to success through RedHat. Similar to the Price Waterhouse Cooper services acquisition which did pan out well. A lot of synergy in the Raleigh area with IBM/Red Hat

"After buying, holding and selling IBM stock many times over the past 4 years and reading each quarter that success is just around the corner I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that this company is only a cash cow for the select few individuals who manage the company. I read about the the billions of dollars of company revenue spent each year buying back stock only to see it presented at no cost to these select managers who in turn then sell it back into the market and bank millions upon millions of dollars. None of these managers, from a financial standpoint, need these zero cost stock grants and would do better at this point to take that company equity and put it into something that might actually grow the company. IBM is world renowned for the thousands of patents that emanate from its research facilities around the world each year, yet when was the last time an IBM patent has truly shaken the industry and grown the company. Perhaps taking some of the millions of dollars in zero cost stock grants going to the managers of this under performing company and using those millions to do a more critical evaluation of the thousands of yearly patents grants might identify a patent likely to evolve into that one blockbuster patent IBM so sorely needs to grow the company and even reward poor stockholders like myself who have kept the faith and kept IBM shares in their portfolio."
"Smart, unlocking over 200 billion of value in cloud computing growth!! IBM should be an easy double!!"
Cramer just gave IBM an upgrade. Very positive comments about the company's expansion into cloud and other hi tech areas. Profits were very strong and the dividend is amazing.
Back to even by open. The results speak for themselves.
Like a two or three year recovery after Buffett bailed. He was so right. Valueline is not playing it for its dividend exclusively but equity growth. At 125 for 9 months hope they are right

Hmm. Why people are posting negative news under various names without valid evidence? Looks like they don’t have any other job or shorted the stocks early.
"I agree with many of you on here, the past few years, IBM has missed out on one of the biggest market booms in history. But I also know that they are currently positioned to be a leader for a very long time in Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Block Chain, Quantum Computing, etc. anyone selling IBM at this time may be missing out... there will likely be a major correction between 2019/2020 and I think IBM will be one of the best places to put money, will see more than double digit growth during that period."
We need help here from red hat and then up to $145. But it will take awhile
can everybody say: thank you dunderhead fast talking rometty and the BOD.....we the shareholders are ignorant bagholders and we dont care about our stock performance....
IBM should be a classic Harvard Business case study on how a once tremendous company was brought to ruin by Palmisano and the current inept CEO. The study should also include a scathing rebuke of the clueless BOD. I don't think there is any more hope for IBM in that it is beyond repair.
"well, i can expect to buy this under 120 again LOL"
"Q3 results crucial, not just for IBM but for entire market to see which direction are we headed. IBM’s cloud entry through Newco is a slow endeavor with many big companies already making great headway. IBMs P/E is just 14.

"Same old story on this board...""time to load up the truck"". Although Im a LT holder, I wont buy more. Will keep what I have and enjoy the dividend. every time I hear someone say, ""it time to load the truck up"", I envision a truck getting loaded and then the axle breaks and the truck goes into the Rometty ditch...AGAIN. Everyone has a risk tolerance that is their own. Flushing once and watch your money go down a drain, doesn't excite me to do it again. VOTE YOUR SHARES and get rid of the BOD!"
What is IBM good for today?
There is a declining argument to retain IBM in the DJI.
IBM will drop through 100 when it is announced they are dropped from the Dow.
The buyer usually falls in mergers though in this bubble market the buyer sometimes rises if the deal is considered a good one but in this case I think they overpaid a desperation move...
Ginnifer came to IBM from PWC buyout years ago. another BAD audition to expand consulting and devices that failed. a lot of folks in the end of the business were let go
"IBM resisting the tech selloff better than AAPL, unbelievable."
stock can't hold 125..which is bad. IBM should at a minimum be 150. rometty need to go and the board as well if they fail to do their fuducary responsibilities.
Good ol' pre-earnings trading computer power mind games... If tech is doing well... $IBM should be doing great. Back to $140's easy as under $120 is the insiders buy level.
"The difference with MSFT under Balmer and IBM under Rometty is that MSFT had 2 anchor products, Office and Windows for which they basically had no competition. When Balmer finally saw the light and started with Azure and now with the current CEO, they had a solid base to build from. With IBM, other than the mainframe they have nothing left in which they are relevant."
hopefully it pulls back to $120 -$125 for options expiration manipulation so i can get some more shares.
"This will be very short lived, 0.1% YoY, last year was w/o RHT revenue, barely making up for the loss in legacy. Look at how much their earnings dropped excluding the 1.9b one time tax provision from last year."
"Gross negligence by the BOD...only hope is an activist investor who would force Rometty's departure. Enough already.She is past normal IBM retirement age, and has an unmatched record of failure and BS promises."
It's time IBM uses some of its Cash reserves and look into acquiring smart companies like NTNX who can help it tremendously in it's Cloud strategy.
And the split bump is completely gone
Time to replace the IBM CEO. 5 years is enough time for mediocre performance.
"It is long past due for a CEO change. Since Ginny took over in 2012 IBM has gone from $188 to $139, down 26%. During the same period the S&P went from 1999 to 2809 up 40%. During her tenure IBM has under preformed the S&P by 66%. Why are she and the BOD still in place?"

The fact that it didn't habitually tumble 10% after earnings is a win.
"How is it that ibm was the biggest company in the world in the ‘80’s and now can’t seem to do anything right ? It’s market cap is like 6% of Apple or Microsoft’s, thanks Ginny. What a great “progressive” hire she was."

Ok great. Company looks to have deducted interest in stock price.. I got confused for minute why less $1.60 price after hrs. This week $143 back. Next quarter April is going to be awesome quarter FYI.
IBM should go ahead and pre-announce earnings just to get them out of the way and reduce the volatility over the next week… And get the stock back $200 where belongs and where is fairly value today!
I cant help feeling that buying IBM today is like buying Sears 30 years ago
"4 years ago, a relative unknown CEO took over a company on a verge of Chapter 11. Since its founding decades ago, a monster company destroyed every single conpetitor along the way. And yes this soon to be chapter 11 company , around for decades, is the monster pastry. No CEOs , No company ever took on this giant and survived. None . Zero.4 years afer Ginny took over IBM that was a 200b company then, Lisa Su took over a soon to be bankrupt AMD worth 2b. Yes 2b.In 4 years, AMD brought Intel to its knees (yes Intel jis in very serious trouble because AMD leapfrog so far Intc do not have any idea how to catch up). More imoirtantly AMD market cap went from 2b to 100 b !.Yes meanwhile IBM went from 140b to about 100b Who could have thought during Rio Oylumpic in 2016, that in 2020 , there would be no Tokyo Oylumpic, and that AMD = IBM.Yes AMD = IBM"
"The pundits want to talk about sequential revenue decline— which, on the surface is absolutely true— but they don’t recognize the circumstantial complexion of their revenue mix. Yes, cloud is growing at a remarkable clip but IT/ infrastructure is down more because of Covid capex cuts. Pundits want to point to the sequential decline in it/inf and pronounce a greater rate of “secular decline”, but that’s simply not true. Don’t get me wrong, the segment appears to be in secular decline, its just not eroding as fast as the FY20 data will have you believe. In fact, I expect the segment to outperform in FY21-22 as enterprise spend and CAPEX budgets return— perfect time to spinoff. I’m a buyer of this algo-driven sell-off."

IBM oversold and undervalued. IBM is a deal now. you won't see this price again. 130.00 next week.
"Here's the $nvda $ibm partnership from 2018... failed to win a supercomputer bid, now replaced by AMD multi years partnership. Ask yourself, isn't IBM seeing the ""glory"" to come of nVidia's ""superior"" roadmap? Well, they've seen both AMD’S and nVidia's as the DOE had chosen, and dumped nVidia's. If you're an nVidia's long, shouldn't you realize what this means?

"Stock is sinking again. It cant hold 140 now lost another 5 dollars per share in the last week. VOTE YOUR SHARES to get new leadership of this company before it becomes the next GE , Kraft Heinz and loses 50% of its value. Stock should be at 180."
In the red til 12:30. Then it turned green and volumes started creeping up? Wallstreet so shady. They know what was up
"Seeing how well MSFT, AMZN, FB, AMD, GOOGL are performing really puts the IBM results in their right perspective. IBM is loosing ground very rapidly now. Economies are obviously growing, spending is there. MSFT, AWS, GOOGL will now take such a lead on cloud that it's game over, there is no come back. Sad to see what has become of a once great and proud company."

"It is intriguing that Mr. Krishna should stress the need to encourage a ""growth mindset"" among the employees. Clearly, his comments put the spotlight on one of IBM's core problems: a sluggish, bureaucratically ossified management that looks at its spreadsheet metrics and little else. How indeed can the company revitalize its people to think as entrepreneurs? Certainly the company must go beyond giving the ""employee of the month"" a little trinket. The culture needs to be more ""Red Hat"" and less ""IBM,"" in my opinion. More lateral communication and less vertical, and fewer number crunchers. Added to that, the most innovative work, in R&D especially, has less and less money to work with each year. I wish these guys luck, and there are many great people working for IBM, but I'm beginning to wonder if the rocket will ever leave the pad."
"Watson, Blockchain, and cloud computing are the new segments of IBM. It's their last chance to turn this company around. Problem is that cloud computing is very competitive. imho"

"I view Mr. Warren Buffet having to once again take a major position in IBM. IBM does look a major beneficiary of a very big 2018 based on the transition in over 75% of every sector into blockchain. The discussion has been and will change to the true winner of the paradigm shift blockchain, FB, Amazon, Autonomous vehicles, retail, mobile payment, healthcare and the financial sector ects. soley domestically will drive IBM to $225, with the international revenue over $325+. IBM will retake it place back in Wall Street as a darling in the tech sector..."
"When zoom like share is trading more than IBM, Cisco, Intel, almost near to Microsoft price, then there is something wrong in market. Careful."
IBM is at an inflection point and I expect the company and the stock to begin a long rise in value.
Good evening folks. I’m new to this board and I see a lot of not so happy shareholders here and wanted to hear where you all think IBM is heading. I don’t care or interested in any bogus info as only serious investors please respond. We took a position in IBM today and wanted to say hey.
IBM: Breaking OUT in the face of market correction with the NEW CEONext target price would be 159$

$RHT Market Cap was over $30B in June.... $IBM paid 10% over that... IBM has cash flow to do this and buyback $5.4B in shares until 2020/2021 and then pay off not long after RHT. Margins improving IBM now trading where it was trading 3 years ago and made over $40 a share since for shareholders. $150-$200 price targets set recently. From what I read this is what I get from it all. And on top of that Watson can now create new perfume fragrances for the CEO.
What’s going on
IBM Selected for Department of Defense Award to Support Advancing the United States Microelectronics Technology Design Capabilities
I can’t believe that ride in the last 15 mins!
I am considering investing in IBM. Why do you guys think Krishna is a good CEO?
It was announced yesterday IBM and Oracle have been eliminated from the 10 BILLION Govt cloud contract
"""Management didn't reveal exactly how it will allocate IBM's total debt of $64.7 billion at the end of Q2 between both entities, but it indicated that it was aiming for an investment-grade rating for NewCo while maintaining a better ""single A"" credit rating for IBM. That suggests NewCo will get a pretty heavy debt burden.""Slow or no growth and a pile of debt. NewCo is sounding more and more appealing lol. On the upside, it can merge with or buy some other service / consulting companies out there. For me as an investor, it has little appeal though. Once they split, i will dump the shares. Maybe not right away, but within the first year."
Watson knew this was going to happen....
Just bought......They've been merciless the past year. Another case of investors not believing what they hear inspite of positive comments by management...
Ginni had driven the company into the ground. She has to go!!! Much lower and IBM will get acquired.
Companies generally have a life cycle. Look at the top companies from 1960 and most don’t exist anymore or are a shell of themselves. IBM was king in the 1980s but its time is over and this company will continue to die a slow death.
IBM lost it when they outsourced all their software to India and renamed the company India Business Machines.
IBM: could hit 160$ for Option Expire today
I wish I would have buy ibm yesterday
Not sure how Ginny can show her face in IBM after seeing the market reaction the last three days. Reality has to be setting in as to how she was viewed
"$IBM now has over a 5% dividend, with share buybacks and a plan to be #1 cloud services provider, https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm/price-target = $160 avergage price targets IBM has a lot of assets and cash flow. some PTs as high as $200,,,couple weeks... we are long ways away from home oversold"
keep the divy checks coming !
Stock rallying and I'm collecting the nice div
"SERIOUS THOUGHTS - what is common between $ibm $intc and $nvda vs AMD's future ?This is not intended to bash any of the respective long investors in those companies. Just hopefully to start an open mind thought provoking process in a hope all will do whatever is best for them, with my best wishes for such!Let's start with IBM, recent move to spinoff a third of itself into a new company so to focus better on cloud. What happened? Well they have failed growing cloud in past year and realized that they need transform their business completely. Obviously they couldn't find a buyer to take such segment of their revenues which is substential so they split it. I'll not discuss the difficulties and prospects of such it's beyond the scope of this post. But ibm bought Redhat for $34B, and place it at the center of its future of cloud. Obviously cannot beat cloud kings Amazon and Microsoft not even Google. So they're talking about hybrid using OpenShift from Redhat. To me it means they hope Redhat business can scale to replace all future revenues of IBM. All legacy will be sold or spinoff. So more is coming possibly but...can that really happen ? I doubt it but they have no choice failing to gain cloud traction years ago, so now they need think about smaller operation. It's like HP split into HPE and Compaq based consumers HP.If you understand that you can see both Intel and nVidia looking for a different business. We already know Intel clearly stated they don't want to be mostly CPUs focused. They try buying all kind of companies to do something else. Why? They realized after their delays they cannot beat AMD. Too late. Trying GPUs. .won't work. .trying Altera FPGAs. ..trying Mobileye etc. Just like ibm focus on Redhat expansion intel tries to find alternatives. It's yet to be seen what business will emerge but no CPUs which could lead to selling all fabs, just like ibm has done as it moves to other business. Now the best is last. What is nVidia doing? I know you cannot agree all with me. But as I've posted in another post, both gaming and datacenters GPUs are in danger. Not winning any supercomputers in the US and abroad is a clear red flag for once dominant company. So nVidia trying to find completely different businesses. Mellanox isn't enough as the network gets integrated into the chips. See Cray own network and infinity fabric possible expansion with other emerging standards like Gen-Z etc. ARM licensing business is to be nVidia's Redhat. They can shift to it all, adding better GPUs IP but no longer make discrete GPUs as AMD taking over this market as I've explained. There you have it. My thinking. It's clear where AMD is going. What isn't clear is if Intel and nVidia and IBM can find their new niche or a major new revenues segment. HPE bought Cray - expanding HPC as a mainstream product to also help its datacenters offering. AMD is to gain the whole market from Intel and nVidia in GPU's and CPUs. That's my thinking with the obvious impact to come.Good luck all!"
IBM's lead on quantum computing has solidified and makes IBM a STEM stock in one or two years. Nearly all data will be funneled through IBM's quantum computers. Look for much larger investments in IBM stock by institutions and stock funds. IBM investors can add and enjoy the dividend while you wait for exponential stock appreciation. The quantum computer leadership is a big win.
This message board really sucks. Yahoo must have gotten a lot of feedback about how lousy this new message board is but apparentlydoesn't care about fixing it. The hell with the users must be Yahoo's position.
"C'mon wake up; until IBM fires the current PC hire, gets rid of Rometty AND the entire BOD, IBM will flounder and go no where. This ""kind of news"" has been coming out for over a decade and what has there been to show for it??? Absolutely nothing but a continued deceleration of revenues and profits. How much longer will IBM be able to keep increasing and paying their dividend??? Whitehurst should be the CEO instead the of ""wannabee Nadela!"" Watson sale??? That's a joke, nothing will come of it. Spinning off the legacy business will give stockholders two dogs instead of one to moan about. Just wanting to break even and get the heck out of dodge before IBM implodes because of its own lack of vision and PC hires!!!"
"Biggest problem is the extreme low morale in the company. Management, especially the CEO, takes huge bonus while laying off workers with huge reduction in separation benefits. I wonder how these people can sleep at night."
Everyone Say sell at this level ! I am going to do the opposite! The dividend is coming up again and people will buy forThat reason ! My opinion only
Read the Oct 17 2019 article on why Warren Buffett is bullish on IBM. Talks about IBM wide moat and all. I think he only sold because of Ginny. I think he may imho buyback in because he understood IBM inside and out.
What do you guys think. IBM is like AMZN?.. Even though IBM made over $5 bucks a share and Amazon made NOTHING.I think they made 50 cents for some reason. Yet the ANALyst were looking for 3 cents. It will drop back(Holidays are done). GUYS . You gotta be like AMZN and make ZERO money or a 1 trick pony like Motorola.. oops . I mean CRAPPLE.... Sorry
I hope they get media math and do something spectacular.
"Ibm is a very good dividend play now. If your game is retirement income. You can mix bp, t, f, khc, and ibm and smile. Note the mixture of products and services and these companies make money and all are extra committed to dividends. Your kids can worry about share price."
"MSFT Market Cap is 1.539T, IBM is only 111B. IBM eps is about $10, MSFT is only $6. At this point, IBM is a much better buy for me. And that's not even counting for the much higher IBM dividend."
Premarket is going to be fascinating tomorrow. I'm getting up early to watch it.
"Simply stated, the problem with IBM is the CEO and the senior management people. With all the dis-grunted people and shareholders, what does it take to make the necessary changes? The BOD either doesn't care or is incapable of making the tough decisions. Meanwhile the market marches on and IBM languishes. SAD,SAD,SAD."
"“Phytel was a really good company, it was really strong,” says the second, who also asked for anonymity to preserve his severance package. “Many people who got laid off are disappointed because they helped build this company and they really thought IBM would take it to the next level—not destroy it within three years.”Phytel had more than 150 clients when it was acquired by IBM, the engineers say. Today it has about 80. “Smaller companies are eating us alive,” says the first engineer. “They’re better, faster, cheaper. They’re winning our contracts, taking our customers, doing better at AI.”"
This stock makes utilities look like growth stocks!!

How can this company prosper when it has many many layers of high paying positions of management and execs and way way less necessary positions of people doing real work. Corruption by the new breed of ethnically skewed and well connected culture is the transformation currently hijacking this what used to be a great American icon into the ditches of history.
https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM/dividends/dividend-safety
IBM is very solid today. I say is bottom is in. BUY
Bought more IBM today. I’m a huge fan of this stock right now and long term. I think there are positives everywhere you look.Great dividend.Good value Slow growth is starting to accelerate with red hat and converting to cloud business. CEO and President are both focused on cloud growth. As the economy reopens their equipment sales business will pick back up and not be a drag on their balance sheet like this last quarter.Heck....I’m buying more tomorrow!
"does everyone see the issues,, VANGUARD owns way too much stock and no one else owns it so its too easy to short because they know if Vanguard has to sell for redemption then IBM falls fast"
How is she still employed?
"look out below, lots of room to drop"
This is the big news I/we were waiting for. Since 2012 a negative -22% under her leadership was disgraceful and should have been addressed sooner. She can now join Jeff Imelt of GE on the wall of corporate shame. These are harsh comments but truthful.
this up due to pltr partnership
Why is it that we didnt get to vote on the red hat acquisition?
"All we get from this management team is BS...""strategic imperatives"",,,""market driven quality""...etc.etc. As thebusiness fails, more slogans..."
"Years ago, IBM could've owned Microsoft for next to nothing. They didn't wanna make a risky bet on windows and they paid the price. Today, they are making an acquisition for open source red hat. I, for one, am glad they're finally coming out of their shell and taking a big risk."
"Whats the actual ""product"" IBM earns money with? Dumpeing their foundry and computer business, and only have some mainframe business left, whats the deal? No consumer products, nor any chips or hardware? Programming software? Havent seen any software written by IBM so far, so my honest question, whats the product IBM is selling? Dont tell me Watson, since i cant buy Watson anywhere, even its a cool idea. I am really starting to be concened, as stock price is falling , even on a low Pe and the first quarter with gained revenue."
IBM now is ready to challenge microsoft for the cloud.
One of the weakest - content free strategy presentations I’ve seen in a long time.
You have to be patient with a stock like this. It's a value stock trading at twice the multiple it should. You buy it for the dividend but not at this price. This stock should be 70.00 but a good entry point is about 110-115. Ignore this move. It's based on nothing and the multiple is not justified even if IBM returned to it's pre pandemic growth which was still putrid. This is the high end of the range where the weak losers get in because they missed it and become bag holders and those who bought much lower take profit. If it drops two or three dollars don't buy it for a long hold. Mark my words this will be back at 120.00 in a few weeks to a month.
If you were lousy at your job you would get canned. Period. If Romnety gets canned she gets a huge buyout or golden parachute. Must be great to be a screw up and get compensated handsomely.
"IBM sales are mostly in fourth quarter, salesman want to get the bonus . Third quarter is always slower. Let see and clip the coupon."
Remember when Softlayer (acquired in 2013) was going to transform IBM's cloud business and save the company. Now IBM is saying the same about Red Hat. How did the Softlayer acquisition work out?
"IBM is gradually turning around but only slowly. With so many niche areas in its command, I can patiently wait for the completion of the turnaround and receive the over 4% dividend in the process. Holding its shares at this level really has very little risk."
Reported better than estimate
Let's get Ocasio-Cortez out of politics and on the Board of Directors for IBM. Her uncanny instincts will be a boon to this technology corporation.

"The erosion continues. Meanwhile, all major indices are in the green. Deja Vu all over again."
"IBM is adopting MSFT strategy with an Enterpriese focus. Cloud for Enterprise first, I guess it could leave the small business market segment to the competitors. This reminds me what happened after Ballmers left IBM."
How come IBM never goes up on days when tech stocks go up a lot? I know IBM is on the NYSE but tech heavy Nasdaq up big today and IBM flat.

"IBM will kill redhat just like they did to DOS, OS/2, AIX. Many IT orgs dont like IBM and run redhat now because its pretty much free. I dont see IBM giving it away which will have people looking for alternatives."
I don't quite understand why IBM is going to bifurcate their business when they are fusing the intelligence of Watson AI in hybrid cloud environments. Anybody?
when Buffet left we should have all left
IBM makes good money and generates free cash that should be used primarily to repurchase shares. That would reward eventually the share holders who are willing to remain with the company.
"So, quarterly cloud and cognitive revenue is only up 3.2% ($5.47B to $5.65B) against a year ago? For the year, cloud growth was 5% to $19.5B. That is minuscule growth. The overall cloud segment is growing much faster than that so these numbers mean IBM is continuing to lose significant market share in the cloud. The per share figures are skewed by the fact that there appear to be roughly 30 million fewer shares than a year ago (buybacks strike again). Revenue is down from a year ago again. It's pretty easy to see why this is dropping in after hours trading after the initial pop... people are actually reading the details."
34 billion for Cloud storage. Desperate measures for Desperate times. I just don't see it helping.
"IBM is ready to launch offence. I went to their web site searching on blockchain and Hyler Ledger, it looks like bug blue is ready and has leveraged the new eco system to dominate blockchain. No wonder short ratio is drastically reduced from 7 to less than 2. Warran Buffet ignorance on technology just does not know the 4th industrial revolution with block chain is here and has arrived. He will miss the boat."
IBM: may close 145$ today for option expire
Get rid of the boated middle management which do nothing but add cost to contracts. Streamline the processes and make managers actually work for a change. Use the money saved to bring on TECH talent not PC managers!
I don't see any reason to ever buy IBM; old company will be close to impossible to turnover; five years from now the stock will still be 150
So now Ginny sits on a board position- what a travesty to record 7 year failure that way!
I JUST RUN NUMBERS. IBM SHOULD EARN ABOUT 14.20 IN 2021. I PUT A LOW 13 PE HANDLE ON THAT AND GET 184 PER SHARE. WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND WOULD SELL THIS STOCK.
"So is the headline that revenue went down for another quarter or that it was inline with analysts expectations and the EPS beat expectations. This shouldn't be down, but TSLA shouldn't be trading with a PE ratio of 1100 either. The market is broken."
FIRE Rometty!
any reason this is still below 150 ?

"What is IBM competitiveness advantage? I think that it is focusing on ""Tech Plus Industry Expertise"". Working with Bank of America on complex regulation controls on the cloud is its strength with its past acquisitions of compliance firm."

"When the dividend goes poof - so will the share price.. Be sure to do ALL of your analysis on IBM WITHOUT the dividend....... What happens to the dividend when IBM divests the 19 billion dollar GTS business into ""NewCo"" - expected to happen before the end of this year (its tick tick tick ticking soon).. Keep in mind that anyone still holding here will then magically have shares of both companies.- will the current dividend be split between the two publicly traded entities - with each paying what they believe to be appropriate??- will NewCo even have a dividend ?? - most new age tech companies don't pay one.- although ""NewCo"" will effectively be the old portion of IBM - (the side without Redhat and basically the ""cancer"" side that IBM is attempting to excise like a gangrenous limb )-Will ( the remaining half of ) IBM then just cut its dividend - as the remains of IBM will be only half of the cash machine it was before the split ??-Will (the remaining half of) IBM (-which will basically be RedHat) eliminate the dividend - as RedHat did not have one- will IBM automatically then lose its Dividend Aristocrat status ?? (A status which is also driving the current price). It would be a great time for the company (but not for the investors) to simply use this opportunity to get out from under paying billions in dividends. There is NO DOUBT that the current dividend and ratios are a part of what is holding up the current share price... A historic Dividend just south of 6%, is a big deal, and there are a TON of people and funds that hold IBM for that ratio. So what happens if the dividend goes away or is decreased (across both OldCo & NewCo) and then all of the funds and holders that hold IBM for ""income"" bail out?? .. in search of safer and better yield dividends. No doubt once the initial dust settles - the overall dividend(s) will be less and thus the volume will be less. Setting aside corporate profits, strategy, management, directions of BOTH future companies..... I seriously believe the Dividend is in serious jeopardy here..... I am holding a fistful of shares until the split hoping that for one or the other company that there will be a run up on the excitement.... but I will not hold both (or either) of these companies for very long after the split - as the sum of the two parts then at that bleeding point in time will be less than the current whole - And we all know that the current ""whole"" has been a disgrace for the entire Ginny time frame."
"Here is an excerpt from an article from Seeking Alpha from earlier today. Speaks volumes about the two problems driving the stagnation. Won't end well.""The paradox with IBM is that all investors know what the problem is. IBM suffers from bad leadership. Ginni Rometty, who has been at the helm for 7 years. During her tenure, the stock has declined by 27% while she has pocketed more than $100 million in salary. A look at Glassdoor shows that only 73% of her staff approved of her job. The CEOs of Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Cisco, and Intel have an approval rating of 97%, 96%, 92%, 93%, and 88% respectively. This tells you that all is not well with her.Ginni is not the only problem. The board of directors is made up of a team that has very little background in technology. It is made up of people from companies like UPS, Emerson Electric, Johnson & Johnson, and Dow. At a time when the computing industry is seeing rapid change, an underperforming company like IBM should at least have veteran tech executives on the board."""
"IBM's P/E is 11 cheapest DOW stock with HUGE potential from its cloud, AI, Blockchain and Quantum computers. It should be a $185 stock and will still be undervalued. Q1 revenues will rise !! Stock will gap up $10 minimum. Target price $175 by earnings mid Jan."
"First Walgreens, now Exxon Mobil ! Lost cloud business to Microsoft. For IBM to lose these two companies is inexcusable, the CEO needs to go !"
"I think IBM is back , It has made many people rich in the past. ,It. won't make me rich but I'm hoping to make enough for a new Ford truck"
I’m short into earnings just too much unbridled optimism
Don't mind it at this level for next couple weeks when ex-dividend kicks in then skyrocket to $180 afterward. Called it!
"Not a buy at the charts but IBM is WW. Tech giant IBM cemented its patent leadership in the United States, with over 9,000 received patents, including in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, in 2019. ... Of the 9,626 patents, IBM secured over 1,800 patents in AI, more than 2,500 patents in cloud technology and led in blockchain patents received"
Wow still tanking on a huge up day.. looks like this will go to 110
Gin Bottle Ginny Ruined this company with her massive mistakes and political correct attitude. Its been stuck in the Rometty ditch for YEARS! Like Carly and Meg ruined HP and Yahoo.
"They should make the CEO of Redhead, the CEO of IBM ."
Congrats to IBM on a new 52 week high! Go IBM 
"Now Rometty has an opinion on how end user data should be handled. Doesn't she have a company to run? IBM doesn't have a lot of credibility when it comes to what today's IT business is, they still live in the previous century. However, she might be onto something, I think there should be a regulation that systems that hold sensitive US data, like bank data, airlines, insurances ... are managed from within the US, by US personel, not e.g. from India or by cheap labor brought in with H1B visas."
"I think nasdaq rally is now beyond dot com valuation for hot stock like $AMZN, $NFLX, $NVDA,$MSFT and other. Problem with this rally is still there are reasonable valued stock like $FB, $GOOGL,$INTC,$CSCO,$ORCL.. And there are many undervalued companies like $IBM,. Yet Everyone buying very hot stock only. Very dangerous. No analyst making valuation call because they scared. Market will make them look fool. All insanity end some point when no one know."
"Ask yourself a simple question. Why $nvda and $ibm couldn't win any of the 3 major US DOE supercomputers bids? Especially troubling since IBM has a history of holding the most powerful supercomputers record for years. Is it because of the Power processors? Well, most heavily computing lifting including AI is done by the GPUs. Simply nVidia's not delivered competitive roadmap to win probably by a large margin. Why large margin? Because if it was comparable, remember the existing software stack including propiatery nVidia's CUDA and TensorCores AI libraries as well as IBM's currently in use by supercomputers, will keep them at least winning one bid. Not allowing TWO to go to AMD with all new software right?On top of this, IBM cutting out nVidia's AI and accelerators, going with AMD shos clear picture about the future products from nVidia vs AMD. IBM as tge DOE, had confidential information on future products and roadmap and simply nVidia's totally off...that's the only logical conclusion after the DOE and IBM have invested a lot in nVidia's based software and hardware designs! NVidia's attempt to buy ARM is clearly in preparation to move to a new business, ARM centric knowing its GPUs revenues both consumers and datacenters are numbered. Think about this deeply. I hope nVidia's longs don't suffer major losses that's why I post this and take it to heart!Good luck!"
"Wow! This is a great buy here. This should be back to $120 plus pretty soon. And in the meantime, you get to collect a nice dividend from owning IBM! Win-win! Good luck all!"
How do you IBM shorts like todays canadian-baby-seal-like-treatment? Huh? IBM will double from here before the spin-off. Double! Giddy up.

The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day!

"folks, relax. IBM has been around for a long time and making money every year! This is not a house of cards like the new arrivals on the scene with metrics beyond belief! Yes, value investing has lost its lustre, but it will never disappear! There will be a reversion soon if history of the markets is to be believed!"
"Perfect storm forming over IBM: Massive debt (result of Redhat acquisition), Incompetent CEO, Loosing market share, Ceremonial board of directors, Demoralized workforce (Because of frequent layoffs). God bless IBM and save it."
I'm optimistic about IBM stock price going up -- it has to make up for the 8 years that it has been going down. There is lots of room for an upside!
"My investment in IBM:On 3/11/2013 IBM stock closed at $214.92.Today (3/01/2021) IBM stock is trading around $121.67.I've been waiting for almost 8 years for the share price to get back to $214, but it hasn't happened yet. Will it ever happen? How many more years do I have to wait?"

Keep rocking the free world ibm
I told you today not to underestimate this stock. Ibm will fly quietly from now on.
That green is a good sign!
The stock has languished for years in a range and never breaks out. Im long the stock for many years and I love the dividend but the board needs to take action and replace the CEO with someone who can drive the company to compete with its rivals who seem to always be late comers but take market share from IBM which has become too bloated with middle management to act to customer needs quickly.
Not too bad at all and dividend still intact. Cloud is the future and they did well on that area. Every companies withdraw guidance and everyone understands the situation that we are in right now only God can tell the future for the next nine months. Hold on to your shares and collect 5.5% dividend while share will climb higher.
How can it be that investors are just now privy to news that $TEUM on 3 separate occasions did a private cloud offering for BIG LEAGUE player $IBM ?! $IBM as you may know is quickly transitioning to the cloud as it's core business focus. What is going on here?!

"IBM needs a good layoff. 380,000 employees is way too many people collecting a check. This company has more employees than Microsoft, apple, and Oracle combined!!!! You might even be able to throw in Hewlett-Packard"
"IBM reports earings in about 2 weeks from now. If today is any indication, you want to own more stock before the announcement. Without question, IBM will exceed its projections. RBC thinks revenue growth will be 3% - the mainframe projections are understated - it is reasonable to expect a positive surprise. The current 13 PE should move up an 18 to 20 PE before midyear. IBM ""growth"" is not factored into the IRS current stock price. All of the other analysts are taking a 2nd look at the stock. I expect additional upgrades after the 4Q report. Getting an upgrade now before the report is a positive surprise.The Street must respect the RBC analyst. His one negative was the size of the IBM debt. How much debt will be eliminated with new repatriated untaxed income? That could be a home run for the stock"
I said long ago: IBM should have new CEO if its price can move up;;

"If people noticed, IBM commercials were being played all throughout the football games yesterday. The fact that IBM is early in blockchain and making it clear is amazing news. I am going to purchase a lot of IBM stock along with the crypto coin Stellar Lumens. IBM is opening up a fiat based exchange using the stellar lumens network called FairX. FairX.io if anyone is interested. The reason I'm interested in the stock and extremely bullish because people want to shoo off IBM as non players anymore. I think they got something big up their sleeves. If you do some digging you'll notice that this exchange is going to be coming within the next week or so. IBMs name will be all over this. Once this becomes a success other major tech companies will follow suit. $162 is still very cheap for what's about to begin this year. Times are changing and so are companies. Good luck, see you all above $200."

"Can anyone tell me something this company has done right or lead in technology for say the last 40years. Didn’t think so. Got spanked on desk/laptops got crushed by MSFT and the dumd os 2 software, got crushed in everything. Always 10 years to late to the game. Always. Have the CEO talk to Bezos on cloud computing, whoops , they are out in left field with block chain, once again talk to Bezos."
I knew the Redhat acquisition would eventually bear some fruit..... Some of my Redhat gains found it's way into IBM.... They bought a new beginning when they bought Redhat!!!
this going to the moon and back
Its trading today adjusted for the $1.57 a share dividend.
Technologics are at the top but not IBM. It is a good bet but patience is important. Should follow.
Nevertheless this company did a lot for the human not in Ginni's time.
"IBM as usual, continue to increase dividend for the 23 some odd years. Buying back shares have done the track to improve share holders value. It is a defensive stock , and yet still can grow. Their Hybrid cloud offering seems to getting traction"
"Am starting to get back into IBM, bot some on weakness yesterday after being out of the stock for about 7 years. Think stock can go lower in here and will wait to build position. Some of my decision to buy was based on the CS research. Hope they are right on this one."
BREAKING NEWS:::::::::::: IBM IS UP .06 after hours.
"Before I retired from IBM in 2000, the ranks of management in the previous 10 years started to fill executive manager slots with bean counters as the Engineers called them. First was Gerstner, After that, the manager slots started to fill with non engineer backgrounds. Not all but quite a few. Also they started to be filled with women Engineers. That was also the beginning of IBM's downfall. Other similar competing corporations went the other way. One more thing that hurt IBM and other corporations as well they started this remote work from your home. You can't develop talent working from you house remotely. Now you know the rest of the story.IBM has a long road to become number one again. One thing IBM has. they do have some very intelligent people, but they need to harness their capabilities, develop new skills, and aggresively compete to be number one."

After IBM fails... this will be the reason... why they will write books about this
will buy at 115 today
A couple more years to get back what I got in this thanks to Ginny. Buffett sure knows a failure when he sees it. More then patient with her. Collecting dividends until then but in this case even Valuelines Dividend portfolio was fooled.
Today's volume up more than 25% above normalFirst time in a very long whileIncreased volume worth folllowing

$3.17 eps actual to $2.06 estimate eps 2nd qtr. The revenue is crashing my guess will not hold $100. This is how bad Ginny really was 15 years late to the Cloud. Not an Innovator. I would think divy cut

The first exercise started with them asking: ""If this company was a bird, what bird would it be?"" Exercises like that are how you get names like KYNDRIL."
ginny got to be fired. ...IBM will not recover while she is ceo. block chain isn't going to save IBM. just like Watson didn't and the other bone headed money loses she has led IBM into. IBM should focus on product not social engineering ..her IBM performance rating is a 4. she should be layer off like she has done to many
Well at least this massive bag I'm holding pays a dividend.
IBM's firing to look cool has 100000 senior IT professionals out there that hate this company. Many of them are now likely with either potential customers or competitors. None of them will do IBM any favors. There's an explanation why the IBM technology signings are down 20%.

"why people think this is a good ""long term"" investment is beyond me. It is the same price as it was 7 years ago, meanwhile the Dow has doubled and Nasdaq is up 2.5 times. That is writing on the wall. The company has a dismal 2.5% expected earnings growth rate."

"MF's 'Better Buy: IBM vs. Alphabet': Not so fast. IBM's mkt cap is a fraction of GOOG's mkt cap (about 10%). As it relates to growth (where MF favored GOOG), in theory, IBM should have a much easier time of it growing their market cap. IBM's stock price/market cap could easily double and still be a fraction of GOOG's. All of this dependent on the belief that IBM has hit rock bottom and has nowhere to go but up. Also don't forget, IBM has decreased its outstanding shares by some 45%. If/when IBM turns things around, the stock price, by means of those fewer shares, should outpace to the upside."
I think hidden value in IBM is Red hat when cloud companies are surging .
A downgrade this morning. Somebody has to go
Really it fell because IBM isn't hiring enough BLM types...Harris will fix that.

All this dead talk but it’s up in the last 90 days and about to surpass price from 6 months ago.. the rebound is in motion
"With everything from cars, to trucks, to even airplanes going electric, the demand for batteries is going to continue to skyrocket in the coming years—but the availability of the materials currently used to make them is limited. So scientists at IBM Research have developed a new battery whose unique ingredients can be extracted from seawater instead of mining.The problems with the design of current battery technologies like lithium-ion are well known, we just tend to turn a blind eye when it means our smartphones can run for a full day without a charge. In addition to lithium, they require heavy metals like cobalt, manganese, and nickel which come from giant mines that present hazards to the environment, and often to those doing the actual mining. These metals are also a finite resource, and as more and more devices and vehicles switch to battery power, their availability is going to decrease at a staggering pace.As a potential solution, scientists at IBM Research’s Battery Lab came up with a new design that replaces the need for cobalt and nickel in the cathode, and also uses a new liquid electrolyte (the material in a battery that helps ions move from one end to the other) with a high flash point. The combination of the new cathode and the electrolyte materials was also found to limit the creation of lithium dendrites which are spiky structures that often develop in lithium-ion batteries that can lead to short circuits. So not only would this new battery have less of an impact on the environment to manufacture, but it would also be considerably safer to use, with a drastically reduced risk of fire or explosions.This Is Why You Should Take Lithium-Ion Battery Fires Very, Very SeriouslyBack in June, after installing a new lithium-ion battery into its ape-inspired RoboSimian and…Read moreBut the benefits of IBM Research’s design don’t stop there. The researchers believe the new battery would have a larger capacity than existing lithium-ion batteries, could potentially charge to about 80 percent of its full capacity in just five minutes, would be more energy-efficient, and, on top of it all, it would be cheaper to manufacture which in turn means they could help reduce the cost of gadgets and electric vehicles. These results are estimations based on how the battery has performed in the lab so far, but IBM Research is teaming up with companies like Mercedes-Benz Research and Development to further explore this technology, so it will be quite a few years before you’re able to feel a little less guilty about your smartphone addiction."
Sadly IBMs problem was going all in on a 7 year failed gender experiment focusing on inclusion rather than results. Shame on the board and hats off to Warren Buffet for seeing it for what it was. Hoping for a tough as nails Gertsner mentality in the new CEO. Take no prisoners!
Get rid of the CEO. A ‘regular’ employee would have been fired a long time ago.

"What IBM really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for IBM (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if IBM just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

That is right IBM. we are just walking about Watson here and haven't started with cloud.

What lots of folks don’t understand about WB is that he’s in a very different business than us yahoo msg plebes He has opportunities that don’t exist for small investors so the opportunity cost to him of waiting out a painful stretch in Big Blue is very high. If shares get cheap enough he will pile back in and double that investment right quick. And it would be months before we found outI was in AAPL years before WB and 5x my initial investment later I bought a small amount of Big Blue and diverted my retirement accounts to other dividend stocks. Point is - don’t worry about what WB or anyone else is doing. Figure out the rules of your game and play your game to the hilt.

"I like IBM stock, but Jim Chanos being short is a flashing red light."
the dividend is safe. that won't be cut but the staff will get cut harder than planned
"what i see is big robinhood traders are shorting IBM, they can move the price down on very small trading, 500 shares drops it and then teh buyers runa nd then the shorts keep hitting every small bid, so it could take a very long time to see 140 again without any real buyers"
"115 next week, mark my words, way overpriced at these levels, IBM is a no future company."
Big Blue on pad ready to LIFT OFF!!!!
I wonder what would happen if IBM announced stop paying dividend ?
"“During her (‘Ginni” Rometty’s) tenure as CEO IBM’s stock has fallen about 26%, while the S&P 500 has grown 160%. In 2018 Rometty’s total compensation exceeded $17.5 million, according to the company’s most recent proxy statement.”"
Hope buffet is buying back in
"I think US retail and whole sales companies will flock to IBM or Microsoft for the Cloud platform. If I were CEO of retail, book store, grocery, I would forbidden the staff to procure anything from Amazon, the competitor. This type of declaration will come soon in the Enterprise space. IBM will be the net beneficiary with the Enterprise knowledge and know how.as US IT spending is increasing. The ransomeware is another case in point that IBM shines with the breadth and depth of knowledge to fight against the vulnerability ."
if the bod doesn't act....shareholders must act by voting against bod candidates
"Tomorrow IBM will test the 52-week low of $137.45/share. Gini Rometty needs to be fired. No excuses, given the way companies are spending on IT."
"As long as IBM stays above $110 I’ll continue to hold and enjoy reinvesting that lovely dividend! Great long term hold, great acquisition by getting RedHat. IBM kicking butt in the cloud!"
"any time when it comes near to the earning, IBM plays some PR tricks to offset the fall after earning. this time it was MongoDB, Australian Gov contract...They are master of marketing, most innovative financial engineering company on the planet. Technical-wise, it's game over to IBM. Thanks to Sam and Ginny."
I bought INTC when the street was down on it. Great purchase.IBM is next.
Question: is ex dividend a absolute bad thing? Just trying to gain clarity since I mostly day trade. Appreciate all responses. Thx
"The blockchain channels are technically mature, saving money and creating efficiencies for businesses. Blochain innovations by IBM will become a major source of revenue and growth. And IBM is, by far, the leader in the business efficiencies with this technology in its early stages https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/07/my-interview-ibms-vice-president-of-blockchain.aspx?&utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&referring_guid=e49d9804-e684-11e7-8ec3-0050569d4be0&utm_source=yahoo-host-n"
good thing I didn't Buy. it always dunks after earnings.
"maybe the chip news will be the spark needed! Lets go Big Blue, you have been crushing our investment souls for to long!!!!"
The Activists Investors should request leadership and strategy changes asap. IBM is a great company but got stuck due to lack of leadership. IBM stock is worth at least $300. This company needs the right leaders in order to move share price up.
today is Ginni's last day!
Sounds like a good move AvrInd Krishna has the right education and experience to make some good moves for the company. It was time for a change. The market likes the change. Hopefully the revenue and earnings will increase next quarter and in the long term. It’s time for some new innovative products to take advantage of the Red Hat software and Watson in the cloud and AI products. The medical field needs help.
IBM may not be growing but Red Hat could be the Catalyst here and the stock is cheap. We should see 175 by early spring.
There doesn’t seem to be much confidence in IBM.
how much is Watson worth from a spin-off or outright sale?
"Next vote, vote AGAINST every BOD'r unless they take action! EARN YOUR MONEY BOD!"
Not to #$%$ on this parade but IBM revenue shrank 2% at common currency so I'm not convinced.
"Excellent opportunity to buy IBM at these low levels. Good earnings, high yield dividends, 11 year low, Great balance sheet. The Red Hat  purchase is accretive and cloud  computing group little by little. I don’t see how we can go wrong with this one. The Red Hat acquisition was a very good thing. !!!!"
I had to take a position in pre market This am 115.02 if it goes lower I’ll double down
"Notably, despite the expected earnings and outsized market drop... basically all analysts within past 24 hours maintaining price targets at $140 +"
"IBM 2.0!! Headed to 250 and beyond! Leader in AI and hybrid cloud! Arvind Krishna and Jim Whitehurst on the right track! Buy, buy, buy!!!!"
Dang it..the stock cant even hold 150 when it should be at 200. BOD! DO YOUR JOB
Incredible how process heavy this company is. Not only that but so much redundancies in processes that are very heavy in all aspects. What does that translates to ? Answer: huge unnecessary costs and overheads that in NO WAY adding value. Incredible ! If this company were to be rightly nimbleAnd eliminate these unnecessary costs it would be going to the roof with profits. It’s all the heavy redundant bureaucratic processes coupled with layers and layers of line management and execs so many of execs getting paid tome of money redundantly counting those processes and same beans ! Unbelievable that execs at the top of this company DO NOT SEE this!! HOW CAN THAT HAPPEN. TELLS ME THOSE EXECS at the top unfortunately may not have this company in their hearts or they are out of touch. It’s sad
way better than INTEL!!!! Glad I bought this morning :)
"Well, another year of IBM on the prestigious 'Dogs of the Dow' list. Is there another company that has made the list this many times in the last 10 years? I certainly doubt it!"
#1 supercomputer is a big deal. IBM is on the top again.
"was it my imagination, or did I see someone post something about IBM losing its chip manufacturing facility, and then the post disappeared?"
The second quarter is looking very scary for GDP in the USA. IBM will be impacted.
"Expectations were set low to meet ,and they do layoffs to meet.Sales down year after year minus 2 quarters."
This stock needs a Rommectomy - stat.
And this is the outfit that I should hire to show me how to improve the profitability of my business???
IBM earnings only going down year after year. Not good
"$nvda longs don't understand the writing on the wall that will cause them massive losses next week after the ER. Consider $ibm was a very close tight nVidia's partner. So close that IBM has included nVidia's propiatery NVLink in its Power processors! They got to win past supercomputers bid, from the DOE. But none recently. ..Not only that but IBM has just launched a massive multi year joint development with AMD in AI and accelerators. No nVidia's! This is a clear sign that nVidia's future is bleak and nVidia's longs risk their PPS bubble bursting! I'm just trying to connect the news for you. Don't be fooled because ss nVidia's bursts AMD's jumps. .."
IBM will warn before April 6th on Ginni's watch. The reason is foul. The new CEO's options are set on the price of the stock on April 7th. Warning will result in a big drop in stock price. Bad form.
Finally some signs of life!!!!!
"$ibm has placed its new hybrid cloud future on AMD! They've recognized they no longer need develop processors, tgeir Power10 will only be a niche play. All their enterprise customers will move to AMD's CPUs, GPUs and AI and other ACCELERATORS which $xlnx has. Those cloud datacenters can be on premises at enterprises IBM manages their IT, or off premise in public cloud, including IBM's own but also IBM's cloud ""competition"" like Amazon and Microsoft! IBM's cloud may be transformed into corporate only super secure cloud not like Amazon, Microsoft and Google that are open to anyone, hackers including. ..and IBM's own mainframe, System Z, will be available as cloud resources only in IBM cloud with super security! Big win for IBM and AMD as well as other cloud computing providers through Redhat support!"
Literally the only tech stock i wanna own
"When I joined IBM in late 2009, the stock was $120 per share. Now, nine years later, it is $130 per share. Thankfully, I left IBM after several years and moved on to better things, but investors in IBM clearly have not."
"I did an analysis of this stock, the bear flag was already at 115. I am very confident in these stocks. After announcing the gains, this stock will explode with great chances to rise in the future to the threshold of 170-180."
"i""m hopeing for a .10 quarterly dividend increase."
"Reminds me of Carly Fiora at HP......acquiring Compac.Strutting around the stage like it was the deal of the Century.It was, for Compac shareholders, that's about it.Same scenerio here."
"this like are tech stocks are long term 2-3 years and you get a dividend of over 5%, a slight pull back is ok, DOW is up 1% so is IBM, so no need to panic folks, get on the train and sit down and relax for the long haul...."
"Just an educated guess based on past companies like IBM..... It might get bought out in a mega merger. IBM's worth on market cap at just a little over a hundred billion. It's not a far stretch to think maybe 1 of those trillion dollar companies might take them out. After all, this company holds alot of patents (including blockchain technology). Just a wild thought while working today"
I wish some smart fund will buyout IBM and break it into 5 smaller companies. Each will commend a multiple of 20 to 20 times.
"After many years with IBM stock I believe I'm finally even when avg. my prices, yay!"
Warren Buffet Dropped IBM stock for a good reason...……..
Bottomed and has tons ofBlockchain ip
Do people really read these comments and make decisions based on them lol
Shorts are the only ones making the money...longs get a dividend and lose forever
OK Beamer its time to Rock N Roll! 150
"Does Ginni still mention the SCAMS (security, cloud, analytics, mobile, and social) anymore, or is just all cloud all the time now?"
A question for IBM:-What do you know today that you did not know 2 years ago when thecost of RHT would have been less than $15B?
"Whenever the market is down, IBM is down more. Whenever the market is up, IBM is up less. Doesn't that mean it's a SELL?"

$150 is right around the corner.
"Have a good weekend everybody, we'll continue ascending next week. Volume was 50% above daily average. Compare with $IBM at 7x daily average with a 10% drop - very significant and catastrophic to go lower next week, or $intc at 2X daily average volume, 10% down - has more downturn to go next week too, as volume is meaningful, AMD goes up nice and steady to break $100 after the ER next week. Imagine the analysts upgrades in contrast to IBM, Intel and other semis outlook for the year. ... !"
finally going to break 150 again. hopefully this time it sustains it
"Company making $10B+ profit consider bad investment at $110B. Company making $2B-$3B revenue consider cheap at $110B+ valuation. What a world we live.those $2B/$3B growing 30%-40% rate, It would take 10 year to reach $25B revenue and may be $2.5B in profit. At same time company like IBM can return your investment."
What is Going On Today??
170 by the end of the year. Similar to MSFT 3 years ago.
Hey guys. If someone sells on the X dividend date of Nov 9th they will not get the dividend.
If it drops below 100 tomorrow we have a clear path to drop into double digits before month end.
got a good feelin'
Make the red hat ceo the ibm ceo
"So how many shares of Kyndryl to each IBM shareholder receive after the spinoff? Just curious. Stupid name by the way, but whatever."
If IBM Changed it's name to Red Hat this stock would be worth triple!
IBM 2.0. Big Blue shall rise again.
"everyone selling now must be ticked off since thats a 2 point loss from last night,, Morgan Stanley again to poor negativity suddenly on IBM after it started to go up"
"I don't own any IBM but I will say this: For MS to come out just a few days away from the ER and downgrade the stock, then they should come out after the ER and either talk about why they were right OR offer a HUGE ME CULPA about how and why they were wrong and lost investors a lot of $$$$."
Intel and $IBM both treated like old technology obsolete technology when both are leading in most of new technogy in their space. Amazing how story line matter more than hard fact.
You don't say?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibms-board-needs-take-hard-look-ceo-ginni-rometty-191306423.html
Would not be surprised for this to gain 10% per year for the next 5 years. Finally starting to get it together and focus on core business opportunities
"how much can it go down from 14 multiple and 5% dividend? IBM makes more money than the combined profits of NVDA, AMD, TSLA, DKNG, TWLO, CMG, LULU, OSTK, ZM, DOCU, CMG, PTON"
Well....I loved the tanking...bought 10 puts for 2.20 yesterday for the 130...wow old them all for $11.... Wow...great profit and then bought 1000 shares of the stock at 118 and 120. So average 119...now let's run back to 130 and do it again
"Ginni's leadership has cost long term IBM shareholders $100 billion in value while she has become fabulously wealthy. But she had a lot of help from IBM's so called executives and board of directors.. The biggest investing mistke I have ever made was not selling my IBM stock the day she took over. Her reign of terror cost me, a former IBM employee, $250,000. During that same period the tech industry had its greatest growth rate in history."
"Rometty needs to go - with everything stacked (weaker $, new mainframe) is this the best IBM can do??"
upgrade from JPM and new chip still it is going down.If it was AMD it could have 15 to 20% up.
IBM : could hit 160$ by Friday option expire
Possible turn a round
"if it can break through 141 today, I'd call it a recovery... big if"
"IBM would improve financial performance by laying off all staff, selling all assets, buying government bonds and continuing to pay a 5% dividend."
"Aren't IBM's competitors, MSFT & AMZN - too big and muscular for IBM to compete with? How can a 100 billion $ company compete with 2 trillion $ companies?"
This new management is very shady!!! First they announced a spin off!!! Then on the quarter conference call they suspended their guidance!!! Can you thrust them????
"If anyone knows how to invest on here, you have to realize that this a great opportunity to buy more IBM. Of course I am looking for a 2 year window for $200/share. Dividends help immensely also. Most long term investors usually make money."
Red Hat employee stock options all going to vest in full when the transaction is completed. Employees are going to stay with Red Hat till the deal closes and move on.
"every stock is a short,, this is a game where shorts always take their cash,, then they let the market run then hit it hard again,, IBM has no strength ,, no real buyers"
"IBM’s EPS is down 21.64% from $3.42 in the third quarter of 2018.Its revenue comes in 3.89% lower than the $18.76 reported in the same period of the year prior.Operating income for the company comes in at $1.67 billion, which is 37.92% worse than the $2.69 billion reported during the same time last year.The IBM earnings report also has net income coming in at $1.67 billion.This is also a 37.92% from the company’s net income of $2.69 billion from the third quarter of the previous year."
If it drops below $100 I’ll buy nobody knows on the recovery from bad mgmt. $137 target absurd
"IBM is now a CRYPTO $ play, I see this going to $400+ with a 3-1 stock split by 2024 and along the way collect a hefty dividend By hosting workloads on IBM Cloud – the industry's most secure and open public cloud for business – clients will be able to use IBM Cloud's confidential computing capabilities delivered with IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services and backed by the highest level of security certification commercially available."
"If IBM's stock price continues to go down to below $100 and stays there until the company splits in two by the year-end, each of the split companies will become an easy target for the corporate raiders! If they do manage to get their hands on this once iconic company, IBM will become unrecognizable and die slowly. It will eventually join the ranks of Xerox, Sears, and Eastman Kodak et al. sooner than anticipated! Just my humble opinion. ……………Tex"
Locked in my dividends. Easy money
"Watch for Ginni to step down in the near to mid term and a subsequent 10% pop in PPS. RHT was expensive, but should create a lot of value moving forward. Think about opening a position."
"Apple, Amazon and all these companies are making huge strides in healthcare and Ginny is doing nothing. Every hospital in the world needs records in the cloud. Healthcare is very untapped in technology and wide open opportunities. We never had any of these resources when I became a RN. You had a reference book that weighed 5 lbs and your knowledge that is all.I just may have to give up on IBM. I have lost confidence. If they could get a new CEO maybe, but that woman does not want to move on from her gravy train.I"
IBM is no longer International Business Machines given as to where most of its developers are situated. It is Indian Business Machines.
Ibm by 2029 should have 700m or less shares out standing n eps of 40 to 50 isnt out of the question with 160b in top line
does lead me to believe IBM might not see these levels if ever again. 158 to 148 do I take my loss here
we shareholders are in shock with this pre mkt. I wonder if this terrible ceo is playing golf at Augusta
"To my fellow suffering longs: Moffett Nathanson analyst Lisa Ellis, who had a sell rating going into earnings, valued IBM at $140 per share. My point here is that if you hold IBM, it doesn't make sense to sell it at $134 or $133 per share. Obviously, I'm not suggesting buying more of IBM. But coupled with some smart option positions, it makes more sense to sell IBM when it goes over $140 / share."
Feel bad for those who bought call options in IBM in the last few days. This company just can’t stop fisting its shareholders
"The deal reeks of desperation at a flailing firm that is quickly being made irrelevant. Management might also be telegraphing a steep dividend cut to help ""pay for growth initiatives at newly acquired Red Hat""."
Selling IBM shares at $139 is short-sighted. They are in the right space and the Red Hat acquisition changes the formula and the revenue trajectory. The company has transformed and positioned itself well for the next 10 years. Will make about $14.20 a share in 2020 and trade at $175-$195 in 18 months. $140 is a good accumulation point.
Remove the IBM Immelt who has proven records of incompetency. IBM will go up to 135 right away.
Remember when longs were relentlessly taunting suspected shorts after earnings?
"Red Hat is a game changer for IBM. Red Hat was/is the world's leading provider of enterprise open source solutions and will add business, but much much much more importantly, Red Hat they will change IBM’s attitudes and behaviors of the combined company and its employees. IBM’s entire company culture will change from within - and this is exactly what the doctor (dr. Watson?) ordered. IBM 2.0. Big Blue shall rise again!"
"What does US Steel, IBM and Sears have in common? Poor management, lackluster boards and failing earnings. IBM at one time invented new products and made new markets. Those managers are long gone. The new MBA’s don’t want to risk (invest); rather follow at best. They will buy into it later."
WARREN BUFFET IS JUST ANOTHER RUN OF THE MILL STOCK MARKET #$%$.DO NOT LISTEN TO HIS #$%$.LOOK AT THE CHARTS - & DO YOUR HOMEWORK.IBM IS PRESENTLY IN THE SELL ZONE - PERIOD.
dark side is still very strong...this trading doesnt have anything with IBM revenue or earnings...
I can’t believe it hit $133. Likely $160 in 1 year.
Buffet knows bs when he hears it
I know there lot of names for successful companies that don’t make sense. But this kyndryl spells misery on top of misery. This company execs are rushing to bring it to the ground as fast as they could. Way to go ... and hélas an American icon is looking like the worst of high tech companies. Ask yourself why ?
Think about it. IBM wouldn't made this decision if it wasn't fully enthusiastic about its cloud effort. Just the beginning imo. Buy.
IBM will dominate cloud and its shares are a gift under $250.00.
Huge huge HUGE volume today. Almost 3x average volume already. Going up.
what happened to the rally?
Who know why ibm dow after the bell?
"IF you feel as I do, the board has abdicated its responsibility and violated its shareholder fiduciary role, VOTE YOUR PROXY to REMOVE THEM! This needs to be done before IBM ends up like GE and the CEO that ran that company into the ground while the board played pocket pool."
If the board wont act to right the ship...VOTE your proxy to get rid of ALL of them!
"If Buffet is gone, what are we doing here?"
"Even if rometty quits or gets fired, who will take over? It would be like replacing the captain of the titanic after it hit the iceberg. It's over, down into the depths she goes. While the executive orchestra of incompetence is still playing."
our company dropping a lot of IBM hardware and going for Amazon AWS.
dropped to 19 in the Valueline Div Portfolio plan to add as it rises.
IBM best days are in the past. There is no reason to buy. They have yet to reinvent themselves. Unlike Microsoft. If it wasn't for the stock buybacks this PPS would be near 100
"Buybacks are short term ""fixes"" to goose the stock but EARNINGS, results drive the price in the market. IBM used to drive the technology bus. Now its in the last row by the toilets."
Red Hat partnering up with Nvidia can only be a win-win!
IBM Financial Engineering will surely not disappoint and will come up with some smoke & mirrors figures for the bulls to lap up...
"The best question to ask yourself when trading or investing in an individual stock is ""if you didn't own the shares today , would you buy them""? The answer is usually a pretty good indication of what you should do. Foe me ....on IBM....I don't own them and wouldn't buy them."
Why is this stock going down big today when the DOJ is flying high ?Incredible how this company is being led into the ditch. One American icon falling ... due to being outsourced
Wondering if I ought to switch to $AMZN or $IBM. Thoughts?
Why did Buffet buy Red-hat? To make a few quick bucks? That doesn't sound like Buffet. Can someone explain what Buffet is doing investing in a company that is in contract for sale?
Gonna be more of the same on Thursday. Massive earnings beat on both lines resulting in a 10% jump. Just like last quarter
160 after earning
the best thing that I B M could do right now is get a new CEO. Clean house upper management. IBM might then have a chance. Us shareholders have waited way too long.
would be nice if we can touch $130 today and maybe new resistance level going forward!
"According to registered IBM users on LinkedIn there are nearly 12,000 people at IBM with VP in their title. Assume 20 percent are retired or former IBM employees and you have one VP managing just 30 people in IBM on average. A VP gets all kind of perks at IBM. If IBM ever expects to re-emerge as a player it would make sense to let half of those VP titles go. You can’t keep laying off worker bees every year and let your VP’s manage less and less revenue and staff."
Please tell me if I am missing something here. I can buy an old established company that is now one of the leaders in cloud technology and receive a well covered dividend of over 5 1/2%?￼
It's nice to see a second day up in a row. This rarely happens these days with IBM - even when the market has a good day.
Posted at the $ibm MB ... nice new revenue in critical needed 10x cloud capacity with corona! https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/community?p=IBM&messageId=ab34192a-3269-413d-8cc3-668d90020a84&bcmt=1
"IBM isn't even factoring in all the revenue from Red Hat while accounting for all of Red Hat's expenses.""However, IBM has said that it would report only a portion of Red Hat's actual revenue for some quarters, while recording all its expenses as required by U.S. accounting standards.""Good opportunity to buy a growing cash flow positive company with a great dividend and over 100 billion dollars in backlog revenue."
Big Blue shall rise again!

RGNX will be receiving royalties also on Sarepta DMD drug EXONDY57= ETEPLIRSEN that could amount to 10%= 100 million next year in 1 Billion in sales. there is an arrangement that Sarepta is using a vector of RGNX that has a 98.9-99.5 % identicalality to RGNX vector and which RGNX owns. RGNX brought the litigation against Sarepta with expectation of friendly conclusion as both companies are sharing same gene therapy programs vectors involved are AAVrh74 and AAVrh10. very good news for RGNX which controls the 100 AAV gene therapy platform vector delivery system and has a $6 billion Private market value which is 3.1 x current market cap of RGNX
"For those who really want dividends there are better plays such as Xerox. Their PE was like 5 or below . IBM is bought by investors because it was akin to buyijg Msft or Aapl or something like that. Now it cannot even be an Nvda or Tesla, and we are now comparing IBM to Zoom. Can you believe that ?"
"Could this FINALLY be the breakout we've been waiting for??? With earnings coming up in a few weeks, c'mon IBM DON'T disappoint all the loyal holders as you have the past decade!!"

IBM boils... a matter of time before it explodes...
IBM paid too much ... ibm does not know how to negotiate.. moreover rhat. Is more heavy on Linux
My greatest fear as a long is IBM may well lose its spot in Dow 30. Few high tech is now trading in May 2020 price. Wall Street has valued us only equally only to Zoom one third the size of Nvda or Tesla.
Great day for IBM stock. I bought it at $115. It’s headed to $125. Taking my dividend today and waiting for the next leg up. A lot of Director’s are finally buying.
whoa!
Usually Female Tech CEOs never have happy endings.
Must be in Bizarro World - All markets in the red and IBM in the green!
How many shares in the new company will be givin to existing IBM share holders ?
"Until God's chosen people/Investment Funds develop a love and invest in this company, IBM stock is destined to stay in the basement. JMHO ............. Tex"
"The SNOW stock is at a huge PE and its cloud data managment/storage is not equal to what IBM has in this area.This point is made confirm IBM is vastly undervalued. After the spin-off, expect the IBM cloud stock to generate huge valuation - . That can be expected using SNOW as an example of where the IBM stock can go.I will assume IBM will allocate most of its dividend income to Newco - the spun-off stock. I will hold Newco because IBM growth will support Newco growth, and I like the dividend income."
Ibm should merge with cisco and compete against the big guys
Heading to $100? Any thoughts?
Ya want a collapse of markets and mob rule in the streets of the major cities? VOTE DEMOCRAT! The IBM board has become WAY too over the top playing pandering politics. NOT YOUR JOB BOD! Focus on getting IBM moving forward again or resign for seat!!!
IBM was down for a while but obviously not for the count as they are looking like there not just back up but standing taller than ever. Still flying under the radar with their innovations and high number of new partners signing in so many cutting edge technologies as witness last week it's time new upgrades on the stock with aggressive new higher price targets.
IBM has topped out in the short term. PUT VOLUME high today and will now fall down 5-10%
The NEW spin off company will have 60 billion dollars in backlog orders according to Bloomberg.
"Warren Buffet better Man Up! He better cough up some dough, and come back to IBM! We need to get this tech stock cranking! Warren Buffet is just the Man who can get this tech stock to soar! Warren Buffet - U are hereby drafted!"
"FIRE Ginni and make Whitehurst the new CEO ... should this occur, I have visions of IBM reacting positively and see the stock price going up dramatically over time, just as MSFT did when Balmer the bozo left and Nadella came in!!! BTW, the entire IBM BOD needs to be fired since their PC hire was in office for so long and they were desperately trying to save face!!!"
Time to start piling into IBM for next quarter earnings! $200 in 2021!
Come on Big Blue! Your ER and CC thereafter will drive the market mañana.
"god, i am saved. was planing to buy this last friday. monday will be big drop"
I needed this news yesterday :(
"Awesome buying opportunity here now! We are below our 50 day simple moving average, with an RSI level of 35 indicating this is oversold. Time to get in now to ride the wave back up. Good luck all!"
One has to hit the ask to play poker. Up we go!

"We made progress in 2020 growing our hybrid cloud platform as the foundation for our clients digital transformations while dealing with the broader uncertainty of the macro environment,"" said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman and chief executive officer. ""The actions we are taking to focus on hybrid cloud and AI will take hold, giving us confidence we can achieve revenue growth in 2021."""
i like the 6buck div
"I wonder what the percentage of you guys on this board are missing a chromosome.. IBM will never keep up. IBM hasn’t done anything in almost a decade, move on.."
Ex dividend coming in 2 weeks !! Now is the time to buy !! Great 2018 coming and PE <12. Great buying opportunity now for upside growth.

"IBM is selling for 10 times earnings and pays a 4% div,and its starting to grow revenue,whats not to like,"
"Lets hope she is wrong....No Bueno it appears. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty lowered her rating for IBM shares to Equal-weight from Overweight. “Our CIO survey published this week highlights risk of core IBM revenue declines,” she wrote. “We expect 4Q results in-line with our estimates and see risk to CY20 EPS guidance.”"
same price as may of 08..this us the sears of tech stocks..can't believe buffet still owns it
"ibm was 150 a year ago now 118, guess the hedge funds are the winners since they shorted it big"
"IBM used to be a colossus. IBM and Bell Labs together did much of the digital transformation. ATT got split...Wall Streetmade much money but the US no longer has a company capable of making 5G infrastructure. IBM also go attacked bythe antiturtrust boys...that and grossly incompetent management that callled every tech turn wrong means that IBMis now a midsized, shrinking company....pretty much lagging in every product category. Hard to see how it could turn around. There may be one last hurrah as Romety is let go at long last...an opportunity to cash out. A recovery wouldbe dependent on some technical advance, or perhaps evern good routine management. Hard to see how that couldhappen unless a neww CEO comes in to effect massive layoffs of middle and upper management."
"A friend of mine works for IBM; she says IBM is a dead horse, with little future, and the spin off was to hide losses. I would rather own MSFT."
Market telling IBM it better start turning it around and give future guidance
#FIREGINNIROMETTY - SHE HAS UNDERPERFORMED THE S&P 500 BY 100% OVER LAST 3 YEARS!!!!
Not an investor - but why is it tanking when it beat analyst expectations?
"If we follow the playbook after past earnings, up for next 5 days....all is fair in t he game"
My Nvidia shares lit....... Then there's my IBM shares. Time to grab me a 12 pack of old Milwaukee's best
In order to prosper the corporation must foster and maintain a culture of loyalty and win- win atmosphere. IBM has destroyed itself from within... most engineers working for the company will leave at the drop of a dime l... why? Because the company treats its employees poorly as though it is obliging them with work. There is no one in charge ... the management is filled with incompetent individuals who are obsolete and don’t unleash the talents they have at their hands... primarily because the talents have either left or are about to leave... Spinning into 2 companies is just a laughable musical chair game ... and believe me I know what I am talking about... now the one tiny hope IBM has is its AI intellectual properties accumulated over the years... whether the talent can be kept to even having the wild thought and imagination of being able to compete with the likes of Google and amazon and Microsoft is something yet to see...Otherwise as far as cloud computing goes... they have lost the war on that badly with no point of recovery...just as they lost the PC battle...It truly breaks my heart to see once a great company to work for with so much innovation is in a dying path... titanic in the making...
The research shows IBM a strong company and it's all the negative coverage that holds the stock back.
I see a recovery to $150 soon.
bitcoin collapsing yet ibm blockchain is their highest priority ???????.....can it get any worse ?????
IBM book value (true value after they sell EVERYTHING in IBM including building ....) is only $7.13/share and its earning per share is only $9.52/share. Why do you pay $132.95? WHY you pay for a company will be bankruptcy soon?
I worked for IBM back in the early 2000’s. They only cared about the mainframe computer. There was no ingenuity whatsoever. They couldn’t move past the mainframe mentality. The upper management needs young new blood that can think outside the box. First thing is to fire that incompetent CEO!
"Another day of big market gains, and another day of IBM going RED! The trend in inescapable with current CEO, yet the board isincapable or unwilling to act. What a great company this used to be, and yet, with all it's patents, technology and skilled workforce, they're incapable of selling! Someone please explain how this turns around...I'm all ears.."
IBM will go nowhere until Management totally gets rid of Ginny Rometty who is still Chairperson for the remainder of the year..Why they kept her on after she totally dismantled this company during her tenure is mind boggling...
IBM share price is at a pivotal turning point. 2020 will see the benefits of the Red Hat merger. End of 2020 this will be a $165 stock.
bullish 2 job stock
Interesting $ibm is green too... today is their ER after hours. Do you think we'll hear partnership with AMD for new cloud datacenters with AI GPUs and EPYC Milan? That should do it getting us over $60?
IBM is going to be a lot of dead fried chickens in the smart planet
Paltry trade volume relative to IBM's newfound interest will take us to $160 in short order. Buy.
"I sold at 137 a couple weeks ago. As soon as these two get on the conference call and open their traps, the earnings bump fades. I was hoping it would go the other way to get back in, what a great dividend stock that can play big offense."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-comcast-ventures-back-fund-160000318.html
"Very short supply of IBM shares, most analyst bullish and Buffett it out of the way."

The CEO just bought more shares at the $110.31 price so he knows something we don’t. Hang in there and we will see this move up quickly.
can anyone tell me how red hat makes ibm a player in cloud or hybrid cloud?
"IBM has a lot of interesting tech. Looks like the new CEO may be better positioned to monetize them. For instance, IBM blockchain may not provide much revenue now, but will drive customer cloud spending. Seems like a good entry point to buy IBM now. The risk reward ration is too good to pass. IBM may be a turn around story like MSFT a few years back."
"IBM quarter highlights along with revs/earnings beats are substantial Cloud growth, increasing margins and paid $5B in debt. What's not to like? GLTA!"
"way oversold,less than 10 times earnings and a dividend way north of 4%"
"IBM: need to catch up with the market RISE 146 147 tomorrowTriangle has been resolved on the UP SIDEStock market continues to RISE 150 easy when SHORT rush to cover, start tomorrow OPEN 145"
It may go test the resistance at 153.
I think you're wrong about IBM. It's a blockchain player and won't come up short. The whole market is red right now.
IBM=Future of Blockchain
Down $4 from yesterday's high. WTH happened?!!
"Instead of thinning out the tech ranks then back filling with more middle managers who essentially couldn't manage a restroom properly, IBM would be up there with Amazon. There was once 250 thousand technical people in America who did excellent work and got the job done, now its less than 20 thousand and layoffs are coming again. Morale is flat. Off shore workers do not have the same drive American workers do to get the job done. Convinced by accountants to off shore to lower labor markets to see better results on the bottom line. All to save a dollar or two. Rommetty is IBM's Jeff Imilt who ran GE almost into bankruptcy before the board took action."
"Based on the EPS and PE, IBM is a $150 stock easy."
Another bad earnings expectations on the horizon.
"With GAAP earnings at $1.87, there is no way they can keep the dividend at current levels going forward."
AWS and MS laugh at IBM.....Rometty must take huge blame but those who preceded her are also guilty
Are you ready for IBM's bad earnings tomorrow?
"This CNBC interview is hilarious, cackling cuckoo Rometty going on and on and on. But has she said anything strategically? If the 2 companies will coexist next to each other, what is the value then. Why spend 34 billion dollars when a partnership will do the exact same. I really don't see what value this brings, either to RHT nor IBM. Except of course for the $$$ in the RHT shareholders."
hahahahahhaaha. IBM is a value trap for investors
what happened here. It was up over $136 before close and I open it upi this am and it says it closed down by $.80 what in the world is going on?
Why up ah
I'm grateful to be an IBM shareholder right now.
"IBM continuing to trend upward with positive news . A SOLID buy and hold for long term investors.!!Great dividend! Looking at 130.00 by December 31, 2020. jg"
The passive dividend investors should have been buying at these prices for their Roth's.
"The way is shaping up after Red Hat, plus cloud and cognitive software growth is silently positioning for the present days. I've read posts referring to an old company, as if the company was judged from its desktops. A matter of time it rebounds."
Have 60 call contracts Jan 26 call; How to trade it before/after earnings?
$200 target. Simple the DOW must keep going up and IBM lags but not for long.
Praise the Lord! There is a God! Buy.
Get ready... earnings beat then a series of analyst upgrades based on the RHT deal closing...
will age dicrimination suit take bite out of future earningd?p
"In the past couple of weeks, I have read posters on this board promoting their prices targets between $220 and $400. What is the time frame for reaching these targets? Will any of us still be alive?"

What will it take to get rid of this CEO?
I bought this on the Valueline dividend portfolio a week later Buffett dumped it. Later Valueline did too after hanging on for a big loss. Then justified by say decreasing holdings. Then it came back in the Appreciation and Income for awhile today it’s gone.
It had no where to go but up hopefully it will move back to the $136.00 price. Longs it hurts but hang in there.
Forward PE 9.5. Think about that. Accumulate here.
$130 is just around the corner as the new lower level resistance....NICE!
"See below. Can someone explain what Chanos is saying in yesterday's article on Yahoo's Summary Board:Chanos said that 'they still like Tesla' but there are so many better stocks for them to trade now. ""Probably my highest conviction is an idea that will surprise the viewers. It's a company that nobody's heard of called IBM (NYSE:IBM)."" He said that IBM is a 'value trap' and they had a lot of success through the years in companies that looked cheap but have had structural fundamental problems. ""The company (IBM) we think, is still engaging in basically accounting high jinx. And it's hiding all in plain sight if you take a look at their numbers."" Jim added that IBM was supposed to earn $9 pro forma in 2020 but the actual number was just $6. He thinks that it's going to be only $5 dollars this year and $4 in 2022. ""IBM increasingly has engaged in lots of games to do this and the latest one is they're going to do a spin-off and now take a lot of charges, that they're going to ask you to add back as part of the adjusted earnings so that the actual gap earnings don't look so bad"". Jim Chanos said that IBM tried to do this thing about 5 years ago and they can only do this sort of 'illusion' for a short period of time. For him, we're in a period where IBM will sooner or later announce that ""we're not really earning $9, $12 or $13. We're actually earning $6, $5 and $4. And it's going to be the next reset."""
"Great interview Ginny conducted with PM May. I think, from a number of things we're seeing at IBM, that Ginny is hitting her stride. Over the next couple of years, look for IBM to reestablish its total leadership in high end business leadership."
"IBM sinking fast, my previous price point $120, lowering to $115."
"I am waiting to buy this at $140 or lower. 67% of the capital structure is debt. These guys have racked up lots of debt to try and effect this turn around. I mean, they had no option, but the stock has become a trading stub. Take years to pay down the debt."
Nothing innovative here. They're a 100 year old company playing catch-up with companies that are 1/10th of their age.
You people just want to believe there's something happening when in reality the only thing is the dividend and that is dwindling for new investors as it goes higher along with a stretched multiple. The believers will hang themselves again on another false pop in this stock. Just line up the next round of bag holders who will get a dividend but see it lost to a falling stock price.
"AMD scored 'huge' win for El Capitan supercomputer, says Rosenblatt Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann noted that AMD (AMD) announced yesterday that it would be supplying both EPYC CPUs and Radeon GPUs in the DOE's 2 exaflop capable El Capitan supercomputer, which is a win that he called ""huge."" The El Capitan win ""has immense implications for HPC/supercomputing markets"" because next generation supercomputing architectures are leading indicators for where hyperscale and PC compute platforms are headed, argues Mosesmann. He also suspects the Street is not registering is that these contracts were expected to go to the pair of IBM (IBM) and Nvidia (NVDA) and/or to Intel (INTC), the analyst contends. The El Capitan win is an important element of the AMD story being much more than a market share gain one, contends Mosesmann, who keeps a Buy rating and $65 price target on AMD shares. AMD $HPE $IBM $NVDA $INTC"
adios ginny
"This is a stock you own for the dividend, not for those investors expecting aggressive growth."
Volume is HUGE today. The smart people know. August 2nd is the BIG Blue and Red day!
IBM needs people who understand technology at the helm and not MBAs who only know accounting.
The CEO must go.
Bonafide clamor for IBM shares continuing. Buy.
Not that bad of a report. Pretty in line in fact. Red Hat will transform IBM's future to one that will be significantly more upbeat. Buy the dip.
picked up some this morning to start position here and collect that 5% dividend. Will be tremendous impact from the Redhat acquisition in the quarters going forward imo
Ginny needs to go to the Bunny Ranch where she can serve as a comfort woman. I don't think she's suitableto be a CEO.
WOW looks like 2 years worth of dividends going to be wiped out in 2 days but everyone don’t worry the forward 3 or 4 year dividend might pay off still so stick with the stock
Sell while you can still profit. This company will be in the rearview mirrors of every major tech company.
Buyer beware
"GR still needs to go, but I'm dipping in at this level"
BUYING TODAY. I EXPECT THINGS TO MPROVE NEXT WEEK AND A RATE CUT COMING SOON. THIS STOCK IMO SHOULD TRADE IN THE 170-180 AREA NOW THAT WE HAVE A NEW CEO AND ARE GROWING EARNINGS AGAIN
Snowflake which has very little revenue with no tech know how worth almost the same as IBM. This is an insult to the market
I am bullish on IBD now fo the first time over last 5 years!Target $180 in one year!
still great dividend. not to be cut. better than GE dividend cut in half leg
"Market's down but when the big boys (DnB) think this stock is a bargain,.....and TRIPLE their investment at these rock bottom prices.....what happens to the stock?"
"IBM , I believe this is the only the beginning....."
What a great shorting opportunity. Selling the 150 calls in the August monthly chain is a great choice.
"Despite decent earnings and guidance, IBM just couldn't handle those ""nose bleed"" levels!!! Failed miserably at the 200 day SMA which was NOT a good indication!!!"
One big advantage that American companies in digital economy of crisscross ecommerce World is they are much more secure than other competitors. I think we are going to see huge dominance in criss-cross e-commerce arena if invested accordingly. IBM and crisscross ecommerce platforms are winners in future.
Just tripled down at 152.. let’s gooooo

"IBM poured billions into watson...failing,,Poured billions into blockchain and a recent survey indicated 84% of companies dont know how they can put it in their business,,,may fail...The cloud business is loosing market share to HP, Microsoft, Oracle and others,,,How long has it been since a visionary, competent CEO was in charge? Long in the stock but Im loosing faith it will ever get back to 200. Too many layers of do nothing management, incompetent off shore resources and a #$%$ off client base."
Jims interview with IBM and Redhat CEOs was proof for me. IBM will be making new highs in 3 months.
Going lower 132
"When does this selling exhaust itself? Earnings were good, new CEO on the way. It's like everyone who has held IBM for decades is selling the news."

I’m still a bull on ibm. It will finish July at $127 or higher. Stay long and be happy.
I’m supposing the purchase of Turbonomics can only improve their Cloud offering. Bit pricey though.
Looks like this stock is headed to around 120! The recent price movements suggest a very poor upcoming 2018 1st qtr results.Hope I am wrong. JMHO!Tex
"This so what good old Ginny Rometty did to this company in her 5 years as CEO. The Board ought to be fired for allowing this to happen while they were paying her $30 million a year, really sad as she is finally retired and laughing all the way to the bank.."
Blockchain tech will boost IBM.
Narrow trading range but breakout coming soon 175!
"IBM is building a long and solid base of support for its next leg up.It appears to me that Buffet has been still unloading IBM stock - I cannot think of any other reason why IBM is still selling at a modest (low) PE when it has a relatively high yield and is a leader in all of the game/changing new technologies.IBM should continue to show income and revenue growth. It did not make that point in the 4Q17 report, but I believe it will prove that point when it reports 1Q18 in April."
"They buy Redhat and name it IBM, and jettison the old IBM into a ""new""co. Of course the stock price will give up all the ""deal"" announcement gains. It's only a great deal for the lawyers and c-suite."
IBM should buy FSSN cloud base for much cheaper than red hat.
ibm going to rally after the bell ...that is my bet ..
Holding 1000 calls at the moment hahahahaha
"IBM service division will be re-rated as Wipro, Cognizant and Accenture, and can growth beyond IBM boundary."
Not time to panic nearing buy time
IBM may wrap around 167 or 170 for Option Expire today
Great write-up in Forbes today. IBM has much more to offer in cloud services and security over Amazon and Microsoft.Quality of services on the cloud will give IBM far more cloud market share.
Insiders buying 114-115 GIN bought 3 million of IBM.Love it.
Feels Like earnings day.
Anyone else think that Blockchain is going to turn into something big?

"they may for the moment not be the leader in the cloud or in AI, but they have solid positions and can certainly tackle the job. What they have that no other company has is the dominant position in mainframe computers. those computers have a role to play, i would not want to be a DP manager where everything is dependent on the cloud. Mainframe local is priceless and will be for a long time to come.But more than that it also provides a customer base to expand upon.People may complain about IBm's software and their personnel, but as someone who has programmed mainframes and pcs and the web, ibm mainframes seem way safer to me and easier to program and manage. Microsoft is spooky creaky and got that way right from the beginning with Gates as its founder.Not sure why that guy came to be viewed as some sort of angel. Anything but.you have the same people doing the work at all these companies, they jump about.its an intense field, where an individuals knowledge can become obsolete overnight.and people are coming and going all the time.we are becoming more dependent on Indian programmers because it is not a particularly good field to be in for americans for previously stated reasons. but all that said ibm has fantastic intellectual capital and good materials in place."
"Played golf in HI with a couple of software guys, they loved IBM's Redhat deal. Says in gives IBM a great position in the ever expanding cloud. They think it was a great hail mary pass."
to all Dividend Investors. Valueline added IBM to its div portfolio however the stock was selling off. Buffet and Ginny's plan for the future did not work now we know why. Thank god I only bought 100 shares.
"What a name!!! Barf, barf, barf."
"According to the chart, it seems the buyers and sellers are confused. The sellers are winning at this moment."
Here we go again!!!! I guess last week's runup was just a tease and now we revert to blah performance again.
"shorts increased their share in relation to last month for about 600K shares but without success in lowering prices, and now they start panicking..."
Don't IBM dare to slip down like the rest of high tech on their technical correction . It never reward its shareholders anything throughout the entire massive bull run.
"With Amazon AWS cloud showing amazing growth more than microsoft Azure, it's clear amd provides for this growth. Not $intc not $nvda. Plus $ibm for enterprise hybrid cloud is a super win. Tomorrow crossing $50!"
"The stock market today reflects how irrelevant IBM has become. IBM tanks heavy, stock markets go up. Shows that this is purely an IBM problem, and that IBM has fully missed the market. The answers to the next questions will be very telling. Will IBM management recognize there is a problem? Who or what will they blame for it? And what will be the action?"
"Interesting talking by Rometty again, she's claiming that age and gender do not play a role, yet in the industry IBM is known as one of the biggest, if not the biggest age and gender discriminator. If you're over 45 and male, you're on the list to be pushed out."
"The market has spoken...no confidence in this deal, no confidence in Rometty, and no confidence in the Board of Directors. Too bad these people can't be sued for malfeasance and lack of fiduciary oversight."
"* IBM teams up with Fraunhofer Gesellschaft on research effort* To host Q System One quantum computer in Germany* Focuses include complex chemistry, artificial intelligence* German government keen to close gap on cutting-edge researchBy Douglas BusvineFRANKFURT, Sept 10 (Reuters) - IBM is joining forces with a German research institute to explore the potential of quantum computing in a project that the government in Berlin will back to the tune of 650 million euros ($717 million) over two years.The German government's backing, sealed at a meeting on Tuesday between Chancellor Angela Merkel and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, comes as Europe's largest economy seeks to catch up to the United States and China in a global technology race.IBM said it would install a Q System One quantum computer at one of its facilities in Germany, partnering with the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft - an applied research institute - to build a research effort and community around it.Quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers.The technology is based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be 'superposed' on each other, exponentially increasing the amount of information that can be processed. IBM's current Q System One machine has 20 qubits.""This effort is poised to be a major catalyst for Europe's innovation landscape and research capabilities,"" Martin Jetter, senior vice president and chairman of IBM Europe, said in a statement.Developing viable quantum computers has proved to be hugely challenging because they rely on superconductivity that can only be achieved in a controlled environment in which temperatures are held close to absolute zero.Any instability in the qubits can lead to ""noise"" that disrupts computing.The IBM Q System One, launched in January, has so far been deployed primarily in a research setting but the company - which has branched into cloud computing and artificial intelligence - hopes to turn it into a commercial proposition.Researchers will be able to access the quantum computer via the IBM cloud, with potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to making artificial intelligence more powerful.""This partnership is a landmark quantum computing initiative and a crucial step forward for German research institutions as well as businesses of all sizes in our country,"" said Professor Reimund Neugebauer, President of Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.Merkel's government last year said it would make available 3 billion euros to sponsor the research and development of artificial intelligence by 2025 as it seeks to regain ground in cutting-edge research"
"What a major disappointment GR is! I hope she leaves soon and takes the BOD and senior people along with her as goes out the door.If she is around much longer, I wonder if IBM will be around much longer. With all the hoopla about acquisitions and product announcements, nothing seems to help the financials. Competition is running circles around her and her execs. There seems to be a real problem with execution. Get rid of the Immelt of IBM ASAP."
good time to buy
Servers came about because of company computers became networks that expanded to meet growing data demands. Network Servers became server rooms became server farms... If you are doing everything in the cloud IBM mainframes are much more secure capable of real-time encryption. That is on reason banks use them and a pretty good reason for a lot of upside for IBM. Unless of course you don't think security is going to be a big deal in the future. For 5% I can park some money are wait until people figure that out.
Article IBMs poor performance under Rometty Reads to me like “USA’s poor economic performance in Obama’s first year”. Or Pumpkin taking credit for the economy he inherited then goosed with untenable tax cuts. I love the RH buy and I’m happy to reinvest dividends at bargain rates.

$IBM Morgan Stanley raises target to $150www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/morgan-stanley-raised-the-target-on-ibmibmnye-to-150/
"Most CEO have about 500,000 shares Ginny has what 15,000 shares WHY she knows something."
"How is it a company 1/5th the market cap size of Apple has 3 times more employees? Not only does the CEO must go, but at least a good 150k employees must go as well. Restructure everything."
Wait for the markets rebound tomorrow. $ibm news on AMD datacenters will get us a big jump.https://siliconangle.com/2020/04/01/amds-2nd-gen-epyc-cpus-power-ibms-bare-metal-cloud-servers/
IBM will be 1/10 of its current size in 5 years from now.
IBM will be the mega corporation of the future if ur willing to take a haircut for a few years
"I predicted their demise in '02 but they rebound. they are not dead because they have an enormous base of mainframes and they are sucking up money in the mainframe accounts. but note that they have totally messed up many projects worldwide: Australia, Canada, Usa, etc. Long-term, I see no upside. IBM has never been able to make a consistent range of compatible products that customers can purchase and grow into. Red Hat is just another place to drop money and is not consistent with any significant strategy to make money long-term."
Institutions are now clamoring to up their undersized IBM exposure. It will take us to at least $160 short term. Mark this post.
"Why does Ginny get paid a higher salary than Tim Cook, when all she’s done is oversee the decline of revenues in IBM during her time as CEO?"
IBM needs a growth strategy with some risk in it.
I would fire this management ASAP; unless the board does that five years from now this stock will be in the 80s
BOD...DO YOUR JOB AND REPLACE THE TRAIN WRECK CEO
Can't use KY as a symbol taken already.
"What is it going to take for the BOD to do their job - to get new blood and new ideas at the helm in order to optimize shareholder value. I don't care if GR is actually making progress. It's healthy for a company to shake things up, especially after 6 years and when the perception surrounding senior management is so profoundly negative."
Alert! Cloud growth accelerating! 23% vs. 16% growth! IBM going to all time high coming out of this pandemic!!!!
Looks like dead money for awhile
I see shorts are back and I'm glad to see you...welcome...we will need you latter...any help to pull stock higher at next wave is welcome... ;)enjoy till we need you...
"Once a great company...no more. IBM reached its peak in or around the mid 1980s. Like Hewlett Packard which was also once a fantastic company, poor leadership has ruined it."
Who is really at the helm of this company. Grover? Cookie Monster ? Maybe snaglepus
can this close over 148 today?
Open source software is the way of the future. Good move for IBM.
IBM needs a NEW CEO! she has been destroying the big blue!
I hold this stock and have a feeling company will not announce good results. How long this will go on for? Been years already ...
"I guess that broadcom AVGO could gobble up IBM as it is building a software & hardware chip companyif Ho Tang strike again. The split up of IBM can boost the IBM multiples from 10 to about 15 to 20 times for the growth pure play part. A total of 200 dollars per aggregate share value could be near for the bidders = VM ware, Dell, ACN, etc...."
Pioneers of yesterday's technology --
"Just stopping in to say hi. Been out of Big Blue since around 2016 if memory serves me - sold at $185 -- and that gave me about a $50k loss on closing that long trade of a few months. I had been in and out of IBM since 1998 before the last 2:1 split. So I did well at the beginning of my IBM long trades. Still can't believe how much revenue has been lost - remember the server business? I got caught like a lobster in a cold pot brought to boil. I grew up in money center banks when IBM was KING and I kept buying IBM into the late 80's for corporate upgrades. The technology shifts blue past my focus and understanding. I finally had enough and have not looked back very often. A 5.4% forward yield is compensation, I hope it's safe..."
"Possibly Ginni and Marissa could create a new startup. Could name it""SureToFail"". IBM needs to get an activist investor on the board to possibly split up the company. In all fairness Ginni was tasked with turning around the problems Sam Palmisano created. She is trying to re-establish confidence and loyalty in the customer base vs rewarding shareholders at their expense. I worked at IBM for 30+ years and then was tasked with training in my replacement from India. I was given 45 days to do this. How's that working out IBM?"
We’re paying the price of an inept CEO 7-year experiment who was focused on making an array of victim classes feel good. International Virtue Signaling would be a good new name. Way too many people.
"IBM’s legacy businesses will be spun off into a new company called NewCo.I just wonder why i would want to maintain an investment in legacy businesses? Once it splits, maybe someone will come along and buy it? Who though? And why call is NewCo. When it should be called OldCo.First thing i will do when i get shares in legacy business is to dump it ... that is what i am thinking. Unless there appears to be interest from some buyer."
What is the news/reason for the spike?
"So did I get lied to? Everyone on this message board was saying double digits coming about 3 weeks ago. Since then, it's done nothing but gone up"
"Anyone here aware of IBM's heavy involvement in the areas of Blockchain Tec? If you investigate that world, IBM's name pops up everywhere. Just a thought that no one here mentions at all. I don't own any IBM by the way."
Ginny's plan is not working. Will there be anything left to develop a new plan if and when Ginny retires/resigns.
Who would buy a company that drops more than 8% in one day ? It might recover then again not.
In todays fed induced bubble market all stocks rise even those like alcoa for example and netflix who report bad news and warn rise..The drop of ibm in this context is a testament to the MAGNITUDE of the problems Ibm has imo...
earnings miss comin up.
Look on the bright side. This could be American Airlines with a $2B loss.
"xspa is where money will be made very soon, heavily shorted and ftds galore."
"The stock, NLLSF, is better than the stock IBM. Its price is only over $3 and has potential to go to 10 times of current price in the next 1-2 years. It delivers various solutions to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen from renewable energy worldwide. It operates through three segments: Nel Hydrogen Fueling, Nel Hydrogen Solutions, and Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser. The company produces H2Station hydrogen fueling stations that provide fuel cell electric vehicles with the fast fueling and long range as conventional vehicles, including cars, buses, trucks, forklifts, and other applications. It also provides hydrogen plants based on water electrolysis technology for use in various industries. It will set up new hydrogen fuel station for Toyota in California. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iwatani-corporation-america-toyota-collaborate-060000318.html). It received the order from Nikola a few months ago. https://nelhydrogen.com/press-releases/"
This is just sad!
"Argus comments last week. nternational Business Machines Corp.(NYSE: IBM)IBM is a leading U.S.-based provider of enterprise IT hard- ware, software and services, with a massive installed base of business. In October, IBM announced plans to spin off its managed infrastructure business and focus on the $1 trillion hybrid cloud market. Post-spinoff, a revamped IBM will po- sition itself for mid-single-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. The spinoff should enable a higher level of in- vestment and a simplified operating model; we look for IBM to become more acquisitive as it fills out its AI-driven hybrid cloud strategy. IBM stock has long traded at discounts to historical valuation multiples and its peer group. We believe those discounts represent opportunity."
I can't wait for Ginni to come on TV tomorrow and talk about all those exciting things IBM is doing.I bought 100 shares at 190. Then another 100 shares at 170. I finally gave up and sold at 168. Best decision I've ever made.
What is the date the restructuring is expected to be completed?

This stock will be in good shape soon
Only number that’s up is net promoter score - everything that makes money was down Q4 to Q4 - we will see $115 before we see $125 again
"I'm worried what will happen when the wind blows and all the ""cloud"" storage dissipates. On a cloudy day everything is great, but what about on a clear day? Do we lose everything?"
Will be back over $170 by 1/26. IBM reacts to good news by selling off for a couple of days and then comes back up by about day 4 or 5.
Fire Ginny.
I bought today. LONG IBM!
Time to add to IBM with its pretty good result in my view.
"""If you are more fortunate than others ... build a longer table, not a higher fence."""
Hello People...Is everyone sleep on IBMs involvement in Block chain Tec? These prices are called stealing. And the div? Grand larceny
"It will be a surprise earning/ revenue upward, it will catch most with their pants down. All expecting the worst, all what it takes a taste of good news or turn around. It will soar to 150 Plus. good luck, see you after hours ~Smile"
imho ibm is a real great buy
"It's time to buy back IBM, looks like they have finally right the ship, and the turnaround is taking hold. JMHO"
When will the board wake up and hire a competent CEO?
"ibm survived on huge contracts doled out by USGovt They originally had a good hw stack but a very resource hungry sw stack. all that is now evaporated with the advent of cloud..many posts here on ibm monetizing in cloud,AI etc. ibm again has been a laggard in these technologies withno new innovative offering. next step will be a dividend cut"
Paying by cash or stocks?
"NEW CEO just cooked the book, it will come down after investigation. Sell when you can and appreciate this new ceo as he risked his jail time to help you."
does anyone know where to find a good finance board??? as this creature has ruined this one!!!!!
"I have a 3-5 year horizon. IBM will be way north by then. until then enjoy the 4.8% dividend while you get .0025 on you checking account. I am bullish long term, don't care about the next year which will not be exciting."
"so much for Friday's 'hype'...back to it's normal dismal performance...nothings changing, and that's the problem..Ginny...leave gracefully...PLEASE!"
I would be a buyer at the current level imo. Morgan Stanley said that with the coming split in 2021 145-180 is doable.
Present CEO is at IBM overtime. It is time to make a change. BOD has to start looking for a new CEO.
Reposting thanks Good Ace!!!Significant new cloud capacity just as it's needed from $ibm on new EPYC Rome cloud offering all over the world! Talking about timing.. new stay at home life desperately needs extra cloud capacity. I bet ibm's cloud selling out quickly as Azure already reported shortages. I'm sure expanded capacity was ordered as ibm had promised availability in Q1. But April 1st extra time because of corona requires more capacity so they got more from amd and made sure all is available in place to prevent shortages! Azure and Amazon surely working to add EPYC Rome cloud servers too.. good for IBM and AMD revenues! We'll hear good numbers at the ER this month! Remember all shipped chips in Q1 even before used in cloud are added to revenues per accounting rules. BEAT!!https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/01/2010000/0/en/2nd-Gen-AMD-EPYC-Processors-Power-New-IBM-Cloud-Bare-Metal-Servers.html
Clearly longs aren't selling a single share. Not til we at least hit $200.
"IBM prior and current advertisement are actually spelling out where the growth is coming from. IBM I see gaining massive growth and the current share price is perfect for stocking. I am still of the thinking that Warren Buffet sold to soon and will possibly either come back and load up or may live to regret not coming back in. Eventually, I believe IBM is a much better investment today than Apple for the near and long term."
IBM red again... getting old
"Rometty told CNBC that the deal should not be interpreted as part of any plan for her to transition out of her position as CEO at IBM. “I’m still young and I’m not going anywhere,” she told CNBC.That ALONE will fuel the selling of IBM stock. She actually thinks she's doing the job successfully. She and Trump are 2 of a kind!"
"wow!! gross over payment for redhat, who was the genius that sold it to ibm?"
Why the weakness today?
"IBM unveils cloud for 5G telcos, gets Nokia and Samsung as partners"
"Been doing some chart reading this morning and found an unfilled gap just below $100. Should the general market correct, I would not be surprised to see it filled. Given that, there does seem to be support in the $110 to $112 area. I do not believe IBM is inexpensive at this price."
"IBM’s service business has a lot of very smart people, I’ve worked with them. I would not discount that business"
We will see when earning are released.
"IBM continues to grow with the block chain market. Bullish indeed, finally IBM is leading in a sector."
"IBM is the one stock I always add to when buying stock. Just a matter of time for HUGE Payday! IBM has a portfolio of dozens software services that is positioned to own the next 100 years! Tick tock tock tock, IBM's time is coming!"
Is an amazing how stocks can never hold up every time they want to sell a little bit it takes everything
The Mainframe is dead..Long live the Mainframe...
"All gaps are filled! From tomorrow, IBM will jump to at least $125+!!! Both valuation and technics warrant it!!!"
"it's Sunday morning in the SW with coffee brewing and a thought pop up after hearing the news WB sold out IBM and brought 75 million shares of AAPL, what if this was uncle Warren's master plan of ultimately helping AAPL to buyout IBM? each time he announced he's selling IBM, big blue shares drops, APPL buys, now, Tim Cook is no stranger to IBM, he used to work there, there are many other factors that could make this happen but I'll just this thought, oh, and for those on this board who's been calling for the BOD and the CEO to gone, this buyout is the stone that kills the two birds, wishful thinking on a sunny Sunday morning, GLTA."
Buying opportunity here.
"Credit Swiss asked specifically about cloud GPUs NEW announcements that aren't gaming:""Is it fair to say some of the GPU data center announcements this year go beyond just the cloud gaming market?""Lisa Su answered on the ER call:""Yes. I think you should expect that we will have additional sort of customer announcements outside of cloud gaming.""This is more than just Amazon and Microsoft cloud instances offerering as such aren't NRE already offered!It must be $ibm cloud using datacenters amd's new 7nm+ GPUs for machine learning and AI analytics as ibm's general manager of cloud infrastructure has revealed last Sep in Rome using epyc for such. IBM is to announce in Q1. This is more than just instances. It's hybrid cloud with enterprises. This explains why ibm's key technical leadership on such moved to AMD and are in charge of stuff related to the GPUs! Impact to $nvda and $intc is clear. Because of the tight integration between CPUs and GPUs amd is creating, enterprise customers will move to amd for both. Just like why cray Frontier supercomputer uses both GPUs and CPUs as I've posted Lisa Su explained because of such integration. This could benefit ibm too of course as ibm runs a lot of IT at big enterprises, it's at a position to replace legacy intel and nVidia servers with new amd's design in addition to the ibm's cloud side! It's a huge play where the $34B Redhat purchase can clearly help with developing the Linux operating system for clients of ibm's hybrid cloud and smooth transition. Intel's is behind servers CPUs per their own guidance this year. Tight GPUs integration with epyc is key and ibm's will facilitate a huge play here for both companies!"
IBM might close 150$ today :-) MMs play to cover those options expired today
IBM will be up tomorrow as Money Managers are buying on this earnings DIP which is actually a buying opportunity. Growth in all areas its just down because the run up had already occurred. If you can see through this and buy now you WILL make money in 2018. Dividends will only grow and in 2 weeks another ex divvy gets announced with $1.50 per share. GLTA
IBM needs to remove CEO ! She has no clue what she is doing ! 63 years old and time to retire and give a youngster a try
"I read the pumper bots predicting $120/share by the close of trading today. At this point, $110 is more likely."
"IBM downgraded , Looks like someone was on the wrong side of a trade and needs some time to recover LOL"
"at current price of 149,its only 10.5 times earnings, it should expand to at least 13,which pots it at 176"
"Everybodys wrong - ...or at least missing the main problem with IBM. 1. IBM is now very hard to do business with... very complex sales org, purchase path, contracts, licensing etc.2. IBM's product portfolio is overly complex 3. IBM's individual products and services are overly complex.IBM is still focused on selling flour and eggs and then adding the labor services to beat the batter. EVERY ONE ELSE in technology is selling fully formed cupcakes with beautiful frosting. I jest, but just barely. (office 365 look like a cupcake? yes, yes it does) True IBM has become a complex bureaucracy of management, but their biggest problem is that all of their offerings and products are confusing and complex and ""tuned"" for the IT geeks..... The way of the new world is not with old school complexities it is with selling Milk and not trying to sell cows and grass."
"Warren Buffet is missing out on IBM dominance on Blockchain.It must be from a trusted vendor instead of startup without the depth of security experts and industrial moat on business and regulatory processes. long IBM. for the price of likely 10 what's apps, it is cheap by many metrics"
"Under new leadership, IBM will turn the tide! It was smart by the new CEO, to not issue guidance the last two earnings calls. With the pandemic, there were too many unknowns, and a miss would have lead to even worse Wall Street sentiment.A few more quarters and issued guidance, this is a $150 stock within 6 months.With new leadership, I think IBM will be one of the most innovative companies on the planet within 3-5 years. The new industrial revolution is upon us and IBM has long played in these fields before there was a big market for them. That has and is continuing to change in IBM’s favor. One could even say that IBM was ahead of its time in a lot of technology (missed cloud out of the gates but closing in) Great price for a long term hold. Great dividend, catalyst plentiful for new mgmt to capitalize on!"
"Looks like the dollar drop earlier is big holders starting to unload with a stop. They so much said that there is no future, nothing new, they will continue to do the same and will have the same bad results. IBM must be the closest thing to shorter's paradise."
IBM has a bright future. Great company. Warren Buffet is a Ding-a-ling.
"For those of you who believe IBM is on the right track and think it's a great place to invest your money, here is a little analysis that may make you rethink your position. The following is a comparison of the market capitalization of IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple since IBM's current CEO took over at the start of 2012. I chose market cap because it takes out some of the distortion caused by the financial engineering of buybacks. (The raw data behind the figures were obtained from stockrow.com. Please feel free to check my numbers and report any errors you find here).When Ginni Rometty took over as CEO, Microsoft was about 10% bigger than IBM in terms of market cap. Microsoft is now more than 500% bigger.Amazon was more than 60% smaller than IBM in Market cap (only about 38% of IBM's size). It's now more than 550% bigger than IBM.Apple was a little more than 80% bigger. It's now over 600% bigger.Most of you reading this have jobs where your where your performance is rated against expectations. What do you think would happen to you if you were responsible for performance like what is described above? IBM's market cap has dropped from about $219B at the start of 2012 to roughly $134B today. That is a loss of $85 billion dollars. That's a lot of money and it happened during a period where the overall market went up substantially.Many of you probably think I'm anti-IBM. I'm not. I'm actually a fan of the company and I am aware of its long history. That is why I am critical of leadership that has delivered the results described above while executing a transition that as far as I can tell they have never committed to an end date for. As stockholders of IBM, this is what you're getting for your money. Are you really happy with this performance?"
market is up 600 and IBM is down as usual......Who is running this company?????
One of the worst CEOs in corporate history with no upside until she goes away.
Down $5 in pre-market...more bad news coming in this endless cycle..
Red Hat/IBM + Nvidiahttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/red-hat-nvidia-team-bring-224050666.html
I will also be buying IBM tomorrow classic shake of weak hands after earnings
"For you fellow option players.....Those $120 call contracts expiring Jan 15 2021 are looking mighty tempting at $345 per contract. I may add that to my long shares. This should easily be over $120 here in the next month or less I bet. Or, if you prefer the cheaper contracts with a shorter expiration date, the Nov 20th $120 calls are just $128 right now. Good luck all!"
"Look at the track record of the UBS analyst that upgraded IBM. https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-roy32% success rate, average 24.4% loss, in a booming market, you really got to trust this guy's opinion.His rankings : Ranked #4,780 out of 4,883 Analysts on TipRanks (#11,326 out of 11,508 overall experts)If you bought into this, good luck bagholders."
too bad IBM doesn't influence the markets so much...
"I worked for one of IBM's largest business partners for almost 10 years. IBM has some great products and services but their organization is a giant cluster foxtrot. Their biggest mistake actually is using partners so much that they barely have a dedicated sales force now. Partners are just not loyal to IBM. They need to get back to their own direct sales force like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and the the like. Partners are OK to supplement, but you have to have your own salesforce to really grab market share."
Anyone notice the Argus Analyst Jim Kelleher upgraded this to a strong buy with $155 target at the exact 6 month high and now were WAY down from there. Anyone else feel that Jim Kelleher may be abusing his five star tipranks rating to sell upgrades to companies looking for a boost in short term share price.He just gave $snap a street high price target at the all time high. He is by far the most bullish analyst. Just like he is in IBM and $pton What is this guy smoking?
"Why does so many people beat up IBM? I do agree that the CEO should have been gone years ago. The fact is this is a company that will be around for a long time, it will most likely be smaller, but still around. Even if the annual revenue drops below $70 billion, that is still a lot of revenue!"
"Reading Biden tax plan is a joke. he will raise Corp taxes and companies will raise prices to the consumer to offset the increase. so companies wont really pay more because YOU will be making it up in the form of higher prices. Capital gains will go from 24 to 42 pct. not good and sound policy, average joe...bend over."
lots of upgrades and stock goes down. gotta love the wall street crowd. never happy even with over a 5% Dividend. they'd rather buy companies with no earnings at absurd prices.
IBM Vote against every director who supported Ginney in a sinking ship. 0 compensation for failure to see the shrinking inginuity of the IBM PRODUCTS. 10 years late to the cloud
IBM showing resilience in the turbulent market. That’s a good sign!
"IBM CEO feels no risk of being removed by board, because of board's indifference to her dismal track record. However, there was a possibility of IBM becoming a target for takeover because of low stock price. So she took preventative action and loaded IBM with massive debt (redhat deal = poison pill). This explains the steep prices for redhat. Now she can continue to milk IBM for several more years while board looks the other way."

Strong past month for big blue
Compare IBM's market cap to other big tech companies and it's a no brainer. IBM is a value here.
"1/2 year past, and IBM is already underperforming the DOW by 23%. Over 5 years..over 100%. Think of that. Your investment is worth less than 1/2 what it should be, and Ginny just got a 60% raise. Where is the logic? Do you really think this is the best management opportunity we have? With IBMs technology and patent portfolio, there's NO payback! Laughable.."
"IBM the GE of 2019.... If the dividend is cut,, I'll be selling. Good luck to the longs but this stock should be north of 160 and it isnt. The BOD needs to be replaced, Middle management flattened and laid off. How many were laid off in sept?"
"I worked for IBM for a number of years. IBM is a risk-aversed company. Top management is generally clueless how and where to steer the boat. Middle management are nothing but bobble-heads. The workers (who are left) are just ""shoveling coal into the boilers"". Whenever the great ship gets into trouble, the captain (Upper management) blames the workers, and middle management just goes along. It's a very sad state of affairs!"
IBM's outlook for 2020 is key for AMD too re datacenters. If $ibm doesn't have a cloud outlook for 2020 that's different it will die. CEO under fire. Dumping $intc and $nvda and embracing AMD is key. Let's see if they say something though IBM isn't a big player.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ibm-earnings-outlook-for-2020-amid-soft-software-market-is-key-2020-01-15
You lost you dividend gains and more and soon ibm may be forced to cut dividend..l
Why too many so called offering mangers. They run around in meetings all day long. All they do is talk bla bla. They don’t even drive markets or create opportunities. I have no idea what they do. Add yo that project managers that even act as hindrance and slow development. Plus the so many highly paid directors. Why?

"The numbers in their growing businesses were great. AI, Cloud, Blockchain, services/consulting etc. They should spin off their mainframe legacy business and the stock would double with a PE probably three times higher. That’s what I would do."
News article is ibm undervalued...the analst has a 146 target....guess what he owns nothing....so no skin in the game...so now ibm is max worth today 120....i hope for 130 but seems shorts say below 120..
"Did I tell you to short IBM on the day it pops on cooked earning? I never lose to short IBM at any pop, it's easy money tho."
Parting out the business.
ibm will appear to be shot out of a cannon after earnings. 170 here we come
"It will be sad to this once Iconic Company join the ranks of Kodak, Sears, Xerox, and GE! The next financial report t may tell the story."
I expect IBM will announce some big contract before the year end.
Stock prices fall faster than they rise. When the sellers are done. IBM will be a better buy. IBM isn’t going to tank. Just will have a better buying opportunity.
"Larry Page steps down as CEO of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai to take over.When Ginni Rometty steps down as CEO of IBM and IBM shares will go up at least $20 for sure."
I will await till the next earnings. Hopefully it gives further signs of improvement. IBM did not participate in the late bull run at all. Fortunately the price also did not correct like Apple and msft.
"Scream all you want. I bought more at $133.45 today. What a deal. 4.85% dividend yield and a very very possible turnaround case. Apple did it, Microsoft did it. Even little AMD is doing a turnaround. IBM is next."
Dividend in my account. Just waiting to see if IBM drops some before reinvesting.
"If IBM’s strategy is what I think it is, they are doing the right things now. Blockchain tech is useless unless you have an infrastructure (and clients) behind it. If IBM invests in that structure, they will be ahead of the competition from banks and other tech companies."
Yahoo boards are a disgrace. The amount of irrelevant garbage permitted to infiltrate the boards is a disgrace.
"can someone explain how Monday the stock is at 135.75 and Wednesday we are at 129.55 on no news,, seems buying long will guarantee a lose if you hold,, I sold by luck at 135. 30 ,,just bought back in at 131 leve;l"
"WOW ... $mu $35 while amd $40 in premarket! Who would have thought amd pps will be $5 higher than micron a few weeks ago ?! Next don't be surprised to see $intc pps dropping bellow amd's! Finally don't be SHOCKED to see that with $nvda too latter this year! Remember technology leadership, ecosystem, good value, high margins, partnerships, honest conduct by the CEO and exec team including with partners and retail customers and investors, all and more are emerging especially during financial crisis when hyped marketing and financial engineering ala $ibm cloud ""growth"" which is just bean counting reclassification of legacy revenues, are scrutinized and eliminated!"
$7.67 Up in A/H. It should have gone up $76.7. I will NEVER sell my shares below $200. Period. I don't care how long it will take for IBM to reach $200. I will collect dividends whilw waiting for $200.
loosing faith in this company i was expecting an epic comeback
New to trading here. Ex dividend date is nov 9th. When date does dividend payout start again if I decide to buy this stock?
Buffet is out we should be out
145 after earnings on Monday. 10% up move
Great interview. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ2HLKzkE4A
"here is a good question, how did so many get it wrong for a stock to drop from 130 to 117 in a day, what was missed by big people for a collapse on earnings day, I had puts so i did very well, But i gambled on a down turn, Now i am long averaged just under 120, but how is it that some saw it going to drop whle others were convinced it was running past 130, help to understand it all"
IBM is a DJI DUD. It should be removed from the DJI.
"I hope this is for real although I am afraid it is way too early to even think of an uptrend. For one in June IBM did go up to 137 before turning back. For those of us who had invested in msft and and earlier would be able to attest iBM can even go to $1000. Heck I would even say it should have been there to begin with. It long time past that the longs of IBM should deserve something. Msft has grown 8 times and AMD has grown 50 times the last couple of years. To grow us simple, focus on growing IBM, not social matters, meaningless R and D only for it to be un monetized and outdated. All we longs are asking now is for IBM to get back to where in was in 2012, ie $200. It is not too much to ask ."
"Futures really up !! Little by little IBM moving up... it’s possible that we see $118.75 tomorrow.IBM is the leader in secure open-source blockchain solutions built for the enterprise. ... IBM has worked with over 400 clients across financial services, supply chains, IoT, risk management, digital rights management, and healthcare to implement blockchain applications delivered via the IBM Cloud.The Red Hat  deal though very expensive... is a plus. If we simply have Red Hat’s CEO as IBM’s CEO, this stock would fly !!!"
"The BOD is sending holders a signal they dont care what we think. Until Rometty is gone and wall street regains faith in IBM, the stock will be range bound."
"after many years of financial engineering, now all executives graduated with a big purchase and a big spin-off. Basically Redhat acquired IBM, but still old management team...so no hope."
"Congrats IBM you set a record for most quarters with revenue declines! At least your cloud services rose but the stock will continue to set new records with lower highs and lower lows until you are forced to cut your dividend and use it for R&D. Unfortunately, your stock will bt under $50 by then."
It's beginning to appear that IBM will not survive Ginny. Even financial engineering cannot conceal declining revenues. Watch the free cash flow as it dwindles. More layoffs coming to save this extremely bureaucratic dinosaur.
"If Buffett does not like it, there is a reason."
"Dividend is not safe, and a cut will be used to pay off the massive debt."
"i like IBM IIAS. server that they have annouced , top MPP intelligence machine with load and go design with on premise and hybrid cloud option, with docker containee and loaded with spark cluster. Their engineering effort is paying off."
Perspective. Several weeks ago I bought at 152 with lots of sideways action. Fast forward to now where the floor seems to be 166. Not too shabby
"So spending $35B for Redhat wasn't enough for their cloud strategy?? Now they have to purchase NordCloud too to give them more expertise !!?? For how much??? If they still have to acquire more companies to help them out, it implies that they still don't have a clue after spending all of this money."
Payday today?
Big day today. Can IBM hold the 115-116 support level ? If not the next stop is brutal at 106
Who is really at the helm of this company. Grover? Cookie Monster ? Maybe they are playing “jacks” when they meet and use Rock Paper Scissors to make decisions....vote your shares to remove this bod!!
"The virtue signaling is nauseating. Can’t wait for this insanity to stop. Stop trying to sound altruistic getting out of the facial recognition business, when you will still do business w the Chinese Communists. You know, the ones who use slave labor and run concentration camps for religious minorities."
best deal IBM could have done.
"new management, new direction , new companies. a gem if a value stock paying a healthy dividend. Buffet was right to sell off his shares and buy AAPL. it's time to take another look at IBM"
Is the stock market rigged? Check it out search it
50% of hybrid cloud runs on Linux. 80% of that runs on RedHat. Whitehurst WILL be the new CEO of IBM.
a lot of DEBT!!!
Sell of in morning
It's nice to see IBM finally rebounding while the tech stocks take a beating. GLTA
IBM's ER today after closing. Remember IBM said their cloud going with AMD's EPYC Rome and details of this to be revealed in 1Q2020. Maybe today at the call? Also if IBM is to do bigger AI for corporate business clients for their Hybrid Cloud strategy which they bought RedHat for a record $34B they NEED the GPUs to accelerate such Watson AI workloads. But nVidia's is charging a huge price for every datacenter GPU IBM is forced to buy. If it's using Power processors it was using propiatery nVidia's NVLink unfortunately embedded in Power processors. For x86 they use PCIe gen 3. But it kills competitive pricing as Power cannot be priced higher than an Intel x86 and now a way cheaper EPYC Rome kills it. No choice but to dump nVidia and partner with AMD in my view. $ibm shareholders will be smart to hedge buying AMD shares and sell $nvda ahead of IBM's ER today.https://www.barrons.com/articles/ibm-reports-earnings-tuesday-heres-what-you-need-to-know-51579467600
"Ironically,. Two former blue chips giants $INTC and $IBM are going from kingdoms to skims, and dead dog $AMD, went from slum to kingdom. Good leaders is what counts. $AAPL deprives intel of its lunch."
Might shareholders reject this deal and fire BOD?
$110 at the close
winner or loser after earnings thoughts. I've held this for just over a year as I'm believer long term. in this year I've witnessed ibm get smoked on 4 earnings in a row only to claw it's way back to get smoked again. will this time be different or will history repeat itself?
IBM is better GE first of all
"My experience of stocks like this, is when it crosses +5%, a lot more money suddenly appears. I think that's going to happen."
The only reason to hold the stock is for the pop when Ginny is fired.....
The stock is up nearly $20 since Ginny's departure announcement. I can't believe IBM waited this long to give her the boot.
Is IBM competitive in anything?
"For those who think today is a good buying opportunity, wait, Q4 is going to be a lot worse.-- IBM's services signing was down 21% YoY in Q3, that's a $2B gap in backlog build-- The overall services backlog is down 5%, inevitably this will result in a 5% services revenue drop in Q4.-- The storage revenue is down, while the competition is up, loosing a lot of market share here.-- Mainframe will be down significantly YoY in Q4, it's the first Q that was fully in the new cycle. -- Their cognitive is down YoY already, loosing significant market share.-- The cloud growth in MSFT, AMZN alibaba will be a multiple of the IBM cloud growth.Against all this I don't see anything that will fill these gaps in the short run, blockchain is still far, and quantum even further.Unless they do something drastic, I don't see how IBM will recover.And doing something drastic will need investment, meaning, cutting the buy-back and cutting the dividends.For now shorting IBM is the surest way to make money."
Hey IBM Investor Relations: listen to Pipay and me (and many others) break up this company and focus each NEWCO on their particular specialities. SEE GSK!! P.S. which is my other major holding and their female CEO now 'gets to'.
has the board approved it?
IBM should crack the lost bitcoin password to show its expertise in security.
Who on the BOD is protecting CEO at the expenses of share holders?
spend $63B on red hat??..what i don't get is how does this elevate the ibm cloud position? A: it doesn't....kill this deal or become GE.. A better play would have been VMWare...but it's too late now
"Once again, I and my family thank you for the cheap shares. Yahoo!!!"
NEED A MIRACLE FOR - 200-
IBM WILL BE INSOLVANT WITHIN 10 YEARS
It's different this time around. Not like the past moving up and crashing back to the 118-119 level
She bet the farm.....
This used to be a great company 20 yrs ago. Now they are nothing.
The announcement of 1700 folks being layed-off will make the stock go up.
Was that a new low I saw Ginny? Ginny?Still a great move?You’re the only person that thinks so!
Any complainers today? Feeling pretty good.
revenue up is the directional indication that IBM is indeed turning around
"IBM introduces networked computers to the world 20 years too late. It's a revolution.I like IBM and I think they still have deep inside this company some truly excellent engineers and technical people, but I get the feeling they are getting old and worrying about the 401k's and the dogs vet shots.Time to dump the geezers and bring in true innovators. Of course that requires courage."
How can she still be CEO? Even Buffet bailed in early May.
Sell it and sell it all! You will see IBM 20 percent lower in 1 yr!
Named the company after a dogs name lol ! Well it fits I guess
This is a $300 stock in next 6 months!
Year end IBM will be $166. End of 2021 will be a $190 stock. Red Hat acquisition is helping gain traction in cloud.
Couldn't they just wait until the end of the tech crash instead of doing this bid at the start of it?
"I'm a long time IBM stockholder. I've been left at the altar way too many times. Nevertheless, I live in HOPE. I HOPE that the FCF is enough to justify restarting stock buy back plan as well as continuation of chipping away at debt.THAT would kick big blue back into the green.Also, they have a super deep bench of patents, smart people and a new CEO. Remember how Microsoft floundered forever under Ballmer. Well, I HOPE that was same situation under Ginny and with CEO onward and upward. She is gone and I HOPE this is beginning of new and upward chapter$"
"1700 is an unbelievable low number, looking at how their overall business is declining and how their services are drying up, the number should be closer to 50000 even 75000. Maybe there is another massive round coming after the mid year results."
"I am going to put this idea out there to see what investors think. Idea comes to me from the experience of defense companies when Soviet Union collapsed. Defense companies faced with shrinking revenue but still reliable base revenue. If we look at LMT, GD, NOC their stock price had huge gains. They shrunk number of shares and EPS dramatically increased. I can see some similarities and how IBM could have followed their example. IBM generates about $13B free cash with market cap of about $120B. Argument can be made that shares price is significantly under valued. With only 900 million shares outstanding. Taking shares down to below 500 million would not be difficult. Some of the revenue decline is due to strengthening value of dollar and divestment of pc business. Core IBM business is capable of generating sustainable revenue and profit for foreseeable future. So financially strong company with high stock price would have happy stock holders and ability to grow the business from this base. We can never expect anything like this from this CEO and BOD."
28% growth in cloud. What’s not to like?
Stock may not become too Stable till mid November.......Usually when year end tax loss selling begins to dry up.
"“As for the outgoing exec, she [Ginny Rometty] was awarded a total of $21.062m: $1.6m salary, $12.728m in stock options, $4.25m in non-equity incentive plan, $100,604 for a change of pension retention plan value, $1.5m for change in value, and $883,314 for all other compensation.

To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three year consulting arrangement.”IBM's CEO and outgoing exec chairman take home $38m in total for 2020 despite revenue shrinking by billionsPaul Kunert Wed 17 Mar 2021 // 10:15 UTCFinancial goals missed but Big Blue's execs were all winners anywayIBM CEO Arvind Krishna and ex-exec-chairwoman Ginny Rometty were collectively awarded more than $38m in compensation for their services in fiscal 2020, a year in which Big Blue's revenues shrank and operating profit more than halved.According to the 2021 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement, Krishna, who was elevated to top dog in April last year, made $17.009m. This included $1.353m in salary, $13.159m in stock awards, $2.181m in a non-equity incentive plan, $42,806 in pension and $274,146 in other compensation. He was confirmed as chairman months ago from 1 January when Rometty retired.As for the outgoing exec, she [Ginny Rometty] was awarded a total of $21.062m: $1.6m salary, $12.728m in stock options, $4.25m in non-equity incentive plan, $100,604 for a change of pension retention plan value, $1.5m for change in value, and $883,314 for all other compensation.

To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three year consulting arrangement.IBM's payouts for execs have various scoring metrics: 80 per cent of the award was based on meeting non-GAAP metrics including operating income and operating cash flow; and 20 per cent of the weighting was based on group revenues.The company itself reported a 4.5 per cent decline in turnover to $73.620bn for its fiscal 2020, which ran from January to December. The target had been $80bn. Similarly, the non-GAAP net profit target was $10.7bn but it came in at $7.8bn. The operating cash flow metric of $14.8bn also came up short at $13.8bn.Others in the senior management team also had a prosperous year: CFO and senior veep Jim Kavanaugh was awarded $9.746m, up from $7.14m; exec veep John Kelly got $8.456m versus $7.724m in 2019; and senior veep and general counsel Michelle Browdy was awarded $6.274m, up from $5.588m. The person given the biggest pay award was Jim Whitehurst, who ran Red Hat prior to its purchase by IBM for $34bn. He was subsequently appointed to the role of IBM president in 2020. His compensation package came in at $27.178m. This included $1.173m in salary; $22.4m in stock awards; $1.455m in a non-equity incentive plan; and $130,562 for all other compensation.Whitehurst will be paid up to $6m in a cash retention payment, the first of which landed in July 2020 – the first anniversary of IBM's buy of Red Hat. The second and third payments are due in July this year and next respectively, dependent on meeting criteria, including hitting financial targets.In 2018 IBM was criticised by some on Wall Street for its execs not being financially rewarded to drive the top line. Rather it incentivised leaders to generate top-line growth with Strategic Imperatives (which include cloud, social, security and data).Total revenues at IBM peaked in 2011 at $106.93bn in Rometty's first year at the top and have fallen ever since.Last year IBM reintroduced a total revenue component to comprise 20 per cent of execs' pay metrics. For 2021 it has been increased further to account for 50 per cent of the scoring that determines leaders' annual incentive pay and 40 per cent for the performance share unit. Also new is the Diversity Modifier, intended to motivate execs to ensure diversity in the workforce.It may come as no surprise to cynics that IBM is changing the compensation plan as it prepares to spin off the Global Technology Services division into a separately traded public company. GTS has been one of IBM's areas that has shrunk dramatica"
two 500k+ blocks on sell side today. Someone is giving up on IBM.
"IBM has this PC board that needs to be voted out. They keep this Ginnie nightmare as CEO. She should have been out years ago. Even PC Buffet has sold his shares. I unfortunately learned that Buffett makes stock picking blunders and lost some money last year in it, but I was out before Buffett. I can't believe anyone believes this CEO or this company anymore."
160$ coming to IBM by friday
What could be announced today and the resultus of last quarter earnings is that finalky thie company has turned the corner and profits are going to skyrocket and so will the stock price. $200 at the end of this year.
Warren Buffett considered IBM'S IT consulting and service firm a Wide Moat.
Big blue kaka
"When I was young, IBM was THE company in technology (1975-2015). They could never make a line of computers that would allow a company to grow into the IBM platform--each computer platform (mainframe) was incompatible. They had different lines of business competing with each other. Their mainframes prevailed--the wretched z/OS product. Every big company bought them. The executives of those companies played golf and dined on IBM's dime at the IBM Golf and Country Club. Today is different. Their mainframe is a cash cow and they eat any company who tries to compete in this market. Mainframes are their strength. Unfortunately, the ""mainframe"" is an important component of many big companies but those companies are FAILING to invest in that asset! The outlook for IBM is not positive."
"This is what happens to a tech company that is run by MBA's not engineers. They solve problems with money not innovation. The previous CEO was basically a useless 'consensus' builder, not a tech CEO. IBM can correct this trend, but only if they focus on being a technology company, not a business. Seen it many times before. Nothing worse than a team of MBA's running tech. Worse than worthless."
Why is everyone so excited about Red Hat? They are certainly not leaders in the cloud and their Linux is not a favorite. It seems to me that IBM way overpaid for a company that was headed downhill.
Anyone good on technical analysis please give us your thoughts.
"No matter what the bottom line announcement, the stock most likely will drop at least by $10! JMHO"
mercy buying today. i think someone feels sorry that i am long.
Why is this not going up
"Earnings sell-off marked the lows on IBM. Up from here on new management optimism and Microsoft's tarnished reputation aka SolarWinds, etc. Buy."
Rometty should retire. Both MSFT and CSCO shares have gone up substantially when Ballmer and Chambers retired and replaced by more competent CEOs. IBM is a great company but is poorly managed. Rometty needs to go.
Did anyone see dividend paid yet?
Ginni only bought $3 million in IBM stock today? she pays herself 9 figure bonuses every year...
"How far will this fall come Q3 earnings? Any guesses? More importantly, will the drop be enough to replace Rometty? With nearly every other tech company reaching new highs, I don’t know how the BOD can sit by and do nothing? Is this the same BOD running Sears and GE?"
They were supposed to buy Cloudera which would make there cloud svs top notch... I hope deal gets done
IBM's strategy is making Ginny rich..
"Let's face facts. IBM is more infrastructure oriented than consumer. As such, 2020 was an awful year to operate in. They did a pretty good job at it all things considered. I agree with the CEO that 2021 will be better. Buy the dipper."
i love the div if i can buy this cheap once i free up some cash i certainly will
Widespread hacking of MSFT can only mean good news for IBM. Mark this post.
Not wanting to scare anyone... But does anyone see this going back down to the 115-105 range? (if only for an intra day low)....
"I use to sell IBM servers and storage along with their management platform. Today, only 5 years later, I have no idea what IBM does, what it sells, etc. All I know is Watson?!? I don't know his last name, just Watson"
Pre-market HFTs sure to lose again. Buy.
can everybody just imagine how successful rometty would be as a used car sales person ?????.....world's greatest
"IBM has all kinds of technologies, yet what surprises is IBM doesn't seem to try to use them to compete and expand on market. The big blue just likes to sit there and do nothing."
"all stock markets and stocks are down on average about 8-10%, some sell offs, it may run for a few days, but long term it will go back up... this is just a correction..."
CEO needs to go!
quantum-safe approach to securing data available today and to help enterprises protect existing data and help protect against future threats - imagine quantum computer is used to crack the keys for cloud computing. IBM will be called to help
"The shares wont appreciate beyond 160 until Rometty is gone. Raising the dividend will ease some calls for her to step down BUT, the stock has been stuck for many years. One earning slip[p could see IBM fall into the 120's. Romety is to IBM what Imelt was to GE...Big talker that destroyed the company."
"Rommety popping off on Bloomberg about hiring the uneducated and ignoring qualifications, experience, job performance and ability. She needs to stop talking about how she was hired as CEO! iBM performance shows its now a social charity not a high flying machine that hires the best and brightest!"
"Big Blue is rising again. IBM is making a HUGE comeback. Fantastic..!!!Bashers, nay-sayers, wannabe suicide-shorts get the middle finger! Hah!"
Going to 150 after hours
"Some big money managers should start a new campaign to replace the CEO and her supporters. After all, share holders are the owner and we are hurting and will continue to suffer under an CEO that has a one of the very top salary in the country and did not increase owners of the co. after 6 years."
BOA today raises target from $153 to $175
More like international Bowel Movement
"Did you see Michael, call me Mike during the campaign, Bloomberg talking to the people in Virginia ?He sat there in the booth, talking to someone, and looked like he'd rather be anywhere but there.He also had his arms crossed, telling the person he was talking to, and the world, he wasn't listening, and didn't care.I hope IBM isn't giving any campaign money to him, or anyone who wants socialism. They do that as insurance. But they are only increasing the odds that they'll need it. Not too smart. Every company donating left is violating their fiduciary duty, like they have been for years now. And you stay invested."
Another step in the restructure! Remember how the stock reacted when the decision was announced?
"I don’t understand this dip from a high of around $228 yesterday to around $211 today.Other than Teams, what other WFH products does $MSFT have in its portfolio?OTOH, $IBM posted gains yesterday and today and so, I really don’t understand the “rotation out of tech’ theory either.Anyone help me make sense of all this?"
"IBM ticker is still a ""dawg that can't hunt"" worth beans... dragging a 60 month low... Their so-called engineers build websites so overloaded with overhead we called them Mardi Gras floats... ""fat"" & garish... but without imagination..."
"After this amount of time as CEO, through all the excuses and explanations and promises of better days to come, Ginni must beheld accountable now. She's had more than enough time, and it's blatantly obvious...she can't do it, and the longer she fails, theweaker the co. becomes. Every day she holds that title, IBM's competition grows stronger. This is not about gender, it's about ability!"
IBM will jump tomorrow from both technics and valuation. Going right direction with decent $1.63 dividend coming!!! IBM is way undervalued!!!
The bod has violated its fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders by allowing this Imelt clone to run IBM into the ground
I hope Lucy doesn’t pull the football away from us again on this quiet rise of IBM. Held this dog since 150.
IBM saves the day : )
"I'm new to this. Just got in today for the first time. Lookin at everything as a package, this seems like a steal at the current price + upcoming dividend.Good luck to everyone."
"HEY  ALLWhat does everyone think about $IBM , which acquired RED HAT, $RHT in 2019, now announcing IBM’s further expansion into the CLOUD ...IMO, this is only positive for $AMD , considering IBM announced a deal to use $AMD, for server & etc expansion...Interesting too ... about 2.5 years ago an article stated by an analyst made the case that it would create more efficient efficacy , $ cost reduction, and generally beneficial for $IBM to purchase a Semi /Chip Co., like $AMD...Trying to find the article"

Amazing how many news articles about Red Hat you can find with little or no reference to IBM.
I look at IBM as BA a few years back @ $100 before tripling. Buy all you want below $150 imo.
"I sold all my IBM years ago. When you're an employee for 10+ years, you get so see first-hand lots of things that cause concern and you get a good feel for how leadership thinks and acts (or fails to act)."
Watch IBM using AMD's EPYC Rome in Cloud hybrid offering including AI so GPUs too. Just watch at 2hours 9 minutes. This is hybrid $ibm strategy using epyc and GPUs. Not $intc nor $nvda. Security too. Coming in Q1 this year IBM said.m.youtube.com/watch?v=w-4S77RI7LE
Looking at the long term charts this appears to be a critical inflection point for the share price. If we expect to end this multi-year downtrend it needs to continue higher from here.
"Seen the articles posted here and questioned the quotes of talking heads used. IBM is very unloved and quite frankly maybe deservedly, but that is until one looks a bit into the future of where technology is headed and suddenly that opinion could change dramatically. Purchases of this stock of late have not been just insiders, but private investors who have been around the block a few times and quite savvy. They're not buying small blocks but million dollar blocks. You don't throw down million dollar bets unless you see something others don't. What they see is quantum computing, AI and where others are asleep IBM has invested billions for the future that is already here. This is an incredible buyout target, that is if government doesn't step on it. Buyout - really - think about it. Do you really know what IBM has been up to technically - probably not. I wouldn't bet the farm here, but I would careful not to invest something - I think by 2025 you will be beyond elated with your decision and you collect a nice dividend while you wait, but don't wait to long."
"DEC layoffs coming. That is all this mgmt team knows. layoff workers here..ship those jobs to lower wage places. You get what you pay for.. Middle mgmt needs to be flattened. many of them could not track an elephant through the snow and are concerned with their bonus and threat the working team like dogs. If the BOD doesn't fire Rommety, VOTE THEM OUT IN THE NEXT CYCLE!"
Would be a buyer here risk reward imho very good! their 4 quarter will be there best! plus commited to raising the dividend. Morgan Stanley who is great said best case sceniro is 180 after spin off but likely closer to 155. Good luck!
Has the CEO addressed what is going to happen to the dividend once the company splits?
"$ibm longs, don't be fooled! The partnership with AMD is fundamental and will create unique offering for IBM. Now I understand ibm's future strategy! That of course will be copied by others w.r.t using AMD and $xlnx for the cloud.. BUT. Remember IBM has the top 100 big corporations they serve. Microsoft, Google, Amazon has no foothold at big corporations ! IBM is unique having this and will go further leveraging their current ecosystem of corporate engagement to sell new features for tge future functionality out of AMD's partnership. Xilinx is a must here and finally gets to be in mainstream they cannot do on their own. Intel and nVidia don't have such enterprise firepower through IBM not to mention getting joint development in a tight way through IBM!So IBM's longs, while the separation of GTS with managed infrastructure is a concern for the foothold going forward, I believe a new cloud hybrid cloud will emerge from this, getting the ""new"" ibm to big growth!"
"crazy to think $aapl has enough cash on hand to buyout ibm and pay all debts, still have cash left over"
7-20 Red Hat should be BIG.
Finally smart money see the growth in the value
ibm is like the model t; its time has come and gone; it will soon be a double digit stock; just my opinion
"Lower Rev's, Lower Profit's, few share, and good accounting helps the earnings but it doesn't change a shrinking economy. Look at Global Income - OUCH. We are in an easy money environment and they are asking for more easing.Is this a healthy market or a rigged market? https://www.ibm.com/investor/att/pdf/IBM-2Q19-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf"
My favorite tech stock right now
start reducing the middle mgmt layers that stunt growth.. can't make a decisions and slow the customer response. there should only be 2 layers of mgmt between the working teams and senior execs. these managers add nothing g to the product but red tape and squat.
IBM again fails to stay up in a positive huge market
are they making a bid for ge?
IBM may go up tomorrow like BAC .
Jesus - they are counting their installed base in MIPS now! Only way they can say that it grew - since the number of customers also declined!
"Ginny should be nominated to the business HOF, just like GE's Welch and Immelt. Haha"
what's Watson doing
we need someone who can lead this great company and Ginny is not the ONE.
"This is a great deal for IBM! This message for IBM longs only, as you appreciate value. I have a 2009 Saturn, with just 120,000 on odometer. Yours for $42K."
"Yep Ginny is gone, smart leadership in place aka Gary Cohn. Class dismissed."
Big blue might make a comeback but for now it’s a sell at least until rometty and the board are gone
So she goes shopping and buys a red hat. Immelt in a dress!
"Nice job, Ginni! How much longer before we see a shareholder revolt. Ginni and the BOD must go. All of them."
"Alvin, I certainly hope you are correct that IBM earnings improve and the stock price goes upl I am very concerned about the CEO and her request for Pres Trump to provide training for personnel for IBM. In my opinion, she needs to give up some of her bonus and get employees who are hardworking and dedicated. They are there, but companies have to put out to get the best and I do not think IBM has."
Barclays just upgraded IBM price target to $190.00.. That means that Barclays will be shorting IBM for sure..
Dividend increase may be coming. a tradition to announce it in April
"Too good of a price here to pass up, so I just got aboard the IBM train. Good luck to all!"
The same VPs who drove The IBM Rational division into the ground under Ginny Rometty are now in charge of IBM’s Cloud division. Hmmm... I wonder how that will end?
what is wrong with the new ceo? stock now is worse than with the old ceo.
WOW! IBM outperforming the market for once. Savor this moment!
Cap gains + Div = Sweet
i like the div
Sell off is over done....it will be higher sooner than later. I like the new CEO and will wait for the spin off to be completed while collecting 5% dividend.
"I work for an IT company, we used to be a IBM shop, but they are costing an arm and a leg, now with Amazon AWS, we saved a bunch moving with Amazon, soon we will be 0% IBM shop."
Pre-market HFTs will lose again. Up we go!

Still waiting for IBM to announce a dividend increase for June.
I have some expensive shares of IBM so I'm averaging down.Bought 200 at 127+something.
Good news IBM begins trading on the Moscow exchange Dec 1
"Big Blue. A company that makes money, pays a dividend, with a respectable PE."
"The 4Q report will show revenue and net income growth that will put IBM valuation on a par with companies like CSCO or MSFT.Using CSCO's PE of 20.59, that would give IBM a valuation of $246.87. Using MSFT PE of 31.17, IBM will have a valuation of $373.73. I am certain the stock will exceed the $246.87 valuation of only 20.59. I do not think it will match the MSFT PE, but it should get to a PE of at least 25 and that puts the IBM target to $300. With the ""sex appeal"" of blockchain, I think we can see the potential of IBM at least matching the MSFT PE. I think it is reasable to see the IBM stock at $325 because of IBMs blockchain leadership. The quantum computers are a few years away - but that is worth a hold of IBM stock once the stock gets over the $300 valuation. IBM has a record of stock splits. I see the stock splitting within the next 2 years."
aren't the IBM dividends being dispersed today?
"Every now and then, we get shown why this is BIG BLUE. They get close to a Billion contract and business continues as usual. No biggie.We are close to a 5 year low. Do your DD but IBM has NEVER stayed down for long. This is a tremendous buying opportunity and a 4.5% div"
"ReutersIBM unveils cloud for 5G telcos, gets Nokia and Samsung as partners"
Could we see it crossing 148 this evening?
"IBM may have a shot at the DOD contract after Google caved under the weight of the snow flake melt, SO they are no longer bidding"
Very impressed with the earnings report. Cheap stock!
cloud strategies will accelerate with large companies as this combined offering from IBM and RHT will be leading edge. low tax rates allow for more cash flow so companies can now invest in cloud technologies and not just share buybacks. watch out for increased spending on cloud in next few quarters.
"IBM Canada and Celero sign 7-year, multi-million dollar agreement for Hybrid Cloud and data centre modernization is an example that entrenched customers need IBM for secure serious enterprise mission cirtical apps."
"I pinched off some shares with a limit sell order @130. The div is great, but it always backslides with any multi-day gain..this time I wasn't going to watch it again. Bought other stocks with better/similar yield.. works for me %^ )"
"When you make a guy who failed the hardest the CEO of your company you know where you're going. Current CEO was head of cloud and couldn't keep up with the likes of AWS, Azure, GCP and even AliCloud."
So glad I’ve been buying since last summer when the yield was near 6%. Just couldn’t pass up the yield and figured their investments in cloud and AI would bear fruit in 2021-22. Hoping this keeps going into the 160-170 by YE.
a buy at 144 according cnbc but they also hyped it at 160 2 months ago
IBM makes an excellent move! Redhat is the live blood of cloud
"IBM used to make computers, printers, and peripheral equipment that had a high demand. That's now a thing of the past. The internet and competition has ruined its market share and revenues. IBM has to make things that is needed. They have to reinvent themselves."
Today is quite a historic day for IBM. It just broke a 10 YEAR monthly RSI wedge to the upside... This seems ultra bullish and puts IBM in a situation similar to Oct-Nov of 2006. We may very well see this rip far higher and break out of the bear / consolidation trend it has been in. Its PE ratio is way undervalued compared to other tech stocks. Lots of room to run imo.
https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4365256-ibm-5-yield-blue-chip-regret-not-buying-in-5-years
King blue now in the lead with 2 nm? You bet! Buy the lights out below $150.
The upcoming div increase will take the sp back to yesterday’s close with ease.
"When you got in recently at $116 and got a nice dividend, can't complain. Lot better than .5 in a moneymarket and less downside risk than a bond."
"I never thought I would say this, but this CEO has got to go. I've now watched her speak on numerous topics, not only does she lack conviction and confidence but also seems to lack a fundamental understanding of the topics she speaks on. blockchain, ai b to b infrastructure, she just speaks gibberish and repeats herself over and over without saying anything"
Why not Big Blue instead of MSFT ORCL to challenge Huawei
"IBM's shares slipped by 1.4% yesterday as the quarterly earnings fell by over 3%. Moreover, the company announced that it would be laying off a few thousand employees as it restructures itself for a ""growth"" period according to its CEO. Is this just speculator hype, or will this be one stock to watch in the coming months?https://youth-investment-group.com/2020/05/22/ibm-announces-company-wide-job-cuts-is-there-still-potential/"
this is fun 10 points in 2 days
Waaaay over reaction. Good? time to buy mañana. Thank you lemmings as always.
Better than the last earnings beat
Ginny Rometty needs to walk out the door now or be kicked out!

This is good for IBM.... https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-cloud/ibm-unveils-cloud-for-5g-telcos-gets-nokia-and-samsung-as-partners-idUSKBN27L1QK
i just saw meg whitman brag about her greatest accomplishment at HP - downsizing...unbelievable; soon fast talking dunderhead rometty will be saying the same thing...every tv appearance is cringeworthy
IBM's current debt is $47B. This will add another $34B taking the total to $81B. IBM's market capitalization is $110B as I am writing this. That's just plain scary... especially with IBM's declining revenues.
"How long can this disastrous regime under Ginni continue?In the greatest period of U.S. technology growth, IBM under Ginni has dropped from $220 to $133.The entire IBM board and senior executive staff need to be replaced."
Remember when people were claiming IBM was the buy of the century at $120?
IBM growth is due to using Palantir
What does IBM make these days? I don’t see any product made by IBM.
"As great as the 2nm announcement is, who actually has the fab capabilities to produce it? Oh, that's right, no one at the moment. If I were Musk or Bezos I am using some of my billions to start building that fab yesterday and leapfrog $TSMC."
New 52 week LOW to be 'accomplished' today!
"Look out, deal is going to go through. Here comes IBM. $150 by Dec 1"
The support here at 140 is tremendous and IBM just landed over 1.2 Billion worth of new contracts. Huge Industries and governments want to deal with the big boys and they don't come bigger than Big Blue. Redhat and Oracle actually did well on quarterly #s but their outlook was slightly weak......I think IBM may be the opposite.....and the market always tends to look ahead.Ready to light a match under that rocket.
"ibm raised the div because the company is growing in the future starting now,the mgmt. has a lot of confidence in the company,its a bargain"
Market optimistic about a company with declining revenues wow.
"Price is truth....these guys are in the ""SHOW ME state.......would not touch."
Does CEO sense any guilt he is getting paid? Not every Indian people are smart.
ibm may have another quater of growth ibm .ay become a sleeper stock you may want to own
Dividend increase of penny a share per quarter a major disappointment. Plenty of cash flow for a bigger increase. Debt reduction is important but there is FCF for both.
The question comes into play...what created the mass selling like turning off the lights today...seems very strange and manipulated by billionaire's and vanguard funds
Took a small first position today.
"major upset, cloud was down 6% even with Redhat, it is going down faster than we thought. It's almost game over, writting on the wall literally."
The dividend is not currently threatened with their solid free cash flow. 5% dividend and forward PE of 9.5. What would happen if they beat revenue projections in Q4 as they did in Q2? The question is do you believe the most recent quarter or the 3 quarters prior to that to establish a trend in this transformation? They have transformed just slower than expected and have certainly paid the price.

This will have be a at least a double from the current multiple."
IBM WILL OUTPERFORM THE MARKET THIS YEAR. IBM WILL MAKE NOISE. They have many future technologies but management is kinda slow to put things together. I believe some activists will see opportunities in IBM and pushed hard for changes. Amazing they reduced $13 billion in debts and still pay 5.5% dividends. Great company needs great mind to unlock its huge potential

The CFO is claiming on CNBC that IBM will make up the Q3 shortfall in the 4th quarter. The market doesn't believe him !
Sold BABA last week. Buying IBM today.
"Hybrid Cloud is the future of IBM, large Fortune 500 customer base. Huge market opportunity. 'Krishna sees this acquisition (Red Hat) as a key part of the transition strategy to capture what he estimates is a trillion dollar opportunity in the hybrid cloud management market,' Long on IBM. Great value stock ""right now"" and incredible dividend for a tech/cloud stock."
What does the spinoff mean for IBM shareholders?
"Calling it, it’s gonna be 25% down after hours. I am wrong a lot so there’s that."
"Big Blue is setting up as a big short. Read the earnings report. All their growth businesses ( Cloud, AI ) declined in revenue. They are banking their future on the Red Hat acquisition. The Street gave them a pass."
Guys I have held this for about a year down about 15 % should I hold on or bail any suggestions appreciated
"Once again, the market is voting with it's feet. No confidence! In the company, in it's leadership, in it's products.Shorts still reign.. Ginny..retire and find a hobby. Let someone with a real plan lead this once great company into the future.."
This will be $150 level soon
"Old tech now in vogue aka IBM, INTC, and CSCO. Likely the preferred destination for money exiting FANG. Buy."
vote your shares at the next shareholder meeting to remove ROMMETY and the bod
"For IBM the consensus price target held steady at US$137, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic International Business Machines analyst has a price target of US$160 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$117. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."
"Please, help us owners of IBM. I tried to get Blackrock and Vanguard the largest owners to do something to help improve IBM. I got nowhere. In fact, Fink ??, sent my email to GR. I think we are doomed. My husband is furious and wants me to pay him back the money I have lost and I have been in it since Buffet owned it. I have definitely shown poor judgement to own it."
This makes the investment in AMD even more appealing! Chips are needed no question about it and amd has value not like hype bubble $nvda and $intc not to mention $ibm and $tsla. ..
"Restructure IBM as follows: (1) replace CEO with someone more tech-oriented, less interested I golf memberships at Augusta, etc.; (2) replace old board members with no pertinent background who've been on the Board for years, like Chennault, etc. -- they serve no purpose and obviously the Board and C-suite are more social circles than business oriented; and (3) split the company into two three separate public companies: legacy, consulting and AI/cloud/future or legacy, consulting-cloud AI. Why doesn't CEO face stockholders and analysts and participate in conference call?"
Whether it happens tomorrow or a month from today IBM has $115 per share written all over it.
"In general following news prices drop. IBM has had a steep rise past week.I hope it drops a few dollars for personal gain over the next week on so so financial news.The market is still in knots over covid, and for a while that has to be a drag on all big technical companies.I see it doing well but not in the immediate months ahead.There AI (I watch jepoardy) is unbeleivable and as that ties into cloud more and more they should do well."

"IBM beat profit estimates on the back of strong growth in its cloud business, and said it is confident of returning to sales growth in 2021"
Still a buyer at 150. Sold all my ALLY and this is at the top of the watch list
Insiders are not selling after stock awards!
Waiting for the deal to be finalized. Will be buying as it sells off.The debt and shareholder dilution will be a short term pain for IBM. The Arb trade will hit soon.
"The IBM executive suite is either a daycare for kindergartners or a home for the mentally challenged. not sure which. IBM has more managers and accountants than technical people still working for them in the US. Until they flatten those two hierarchies and hire tech talent to produce product..IBM might as well call it a day. I was hopeful after Rommety was replaced, the company would start a reorg to refocus their efforts on building product and growth as opposed to politically correct policies that do NOT benefit the company or its shareholders. VOTE THE BOD OUT!"
ibm has recently had a nice run on some good news; but not likely to move up from here very much if at all while the recasting continues - probably see it playing out in the bollinger band for a while; right now it is at the high of the band

The profit margins of IBM is rising is indicative of the positive trend."
Short win again.
"This stock will languish until the BOD takes action to get someone in that can run a company the size of IBM, reduce the bloated MGMT structure and develop new future strategies that will WORK!"
Shorts have been obliterated

"IBM CEO at CNBC. I just saw her babbling away at CNBC show. I can not believe with her terrible job performance, she shows her face in public. She speaks like anything but a CEO for a major IT company. She opens her mouth and stock looses %3. Actually credit for all the shame goes to IBM board of directors. I read sometime ago in an article published in a major newspaper that task of replacing the CEO would fall on one particular IBM outside director. But since his son being taken care of by CEO ( promoted from a trainee to VP in a few years). Shareholders should expect no action from IBM board. What IBM CEO lacks in being an effective leader for IBM, makes up more than enough in playing board politics. It is a sad affair that IBM an icon of American technology being systematically reduced to irrelevance. A dim hopes lies on IBM major shareholders voting this board out. For now bleeding at IBM continues."

Message to fast talking dunderhead Rometty and the BOD....shareholders demand that redhat's contribution to revenue and earnings be delineated in all future earnings releases
"STOCK action feels like improving value and maybe CEO changes, stock will easily jump to the $175 area, for now just buy and put away, $140 plus in sept."
Time for Rommetty to go! all lip service and no follow through. Reorganize this company !!!!!
"Today marks the day when IBM went beyond the point of no return. Red Hat employees will now ""rest & vest"" and then abandon IBM. 90% of the acquisition value will be written off within 3 years. And IBM will grind down to $70 per share. I sold when the stock broke below $130 per share. And I'm glad I did. Anyone who understands the history of major multi-billion tech takeovers knows that it's the beginning of the end for the acquiring company."
"Best gig on the planet...IBM board member. Huge salary for zero effort. Just rubber stamp anything Ginni wants, and you'll be recommended for re-election, while she drives the company bankrupt. Kinda mimics our national agenda."
"I just bought control of 63,000 shares above $150 strike for 6k, so that's like $8,638,560.00 mil stock value, I think Big Blue is a Grand Slam in the works and we are up to bat with bases loaded."
and we haven't even drawn our left shoulder yet ...
"as long as we get the dividend the stock will be ok, look out 2 years, the stock will see 160 in that time frame and the dividend will pay 1.70 a quarter"
165 after earning
Why this company is going down when most of similar IT companies are doing well? Answer may lay in it’s line of execs. From the out of touch to the new breed that all they care is filling their pockets. Interestingly They seem to recycle execs. They mess it it in IBM first then they leave the company then when other companies determined they’re the wrong ones they head back to IBM for recycling. Did the world run out of exec leaders ?
Why Ginny and insiders are buying IBM stocks?
OOPS that's 155 TGT by Argus.
IBM is the recognized leader in the block chain technology. Easy to find fault with its past performance but looking forward Ibm has a great opportunity to redeem itself and grow again in sales and profits. Look to the future and not to the past.
"Let's me say this, close your eyes and short IBM and you will be a big winner the next day. Yes, just easy as that. Just like I shorted IBM $133.60 yesterday, I am making money now."
"Now that the PC hire is gone, maybe, just maybe IBM will break out ... Rometty was the worst IBM CEO for years and the BOD finally listened to the stockholders ... now we need to be patient as Rometty really screwed things up and it will take time to right this behemoth"
"As we approach Thanksgiving, let's not forget how thankful IBM investors should be for the great leadership the CEO has provided over the last 8 years"
"Investors seem quite pleased with the departure of Rometty. Hopefully, she didn't leave any landmines for Krishna to navigate in the next few years. If she did, I hope the board has some claw back provisions in her final payment package."
Perhaps IBM had aquired a sizeable position in RHT prior to this announcement.
"agreed. Over last 10 years i been comparing IBM to other high tech names giving an argument hey are going to recover... look at the market cap, so low ,,, low for a reason since IBM is declining company with too much reliance on legacy systems / services business. While others spent they research allocated funds on technology, consumer related products etc, IBM been supporting their price with buybacks and dividend increases yty which very shortly might no longer supported. The company sucks. Hope new CEO will shed some light on how he expect again to turn around this elephant. because investor's patience is running out and to the drain."
10 years from now iBM will be in the single digits; reminds me of sears holdings
Dividend is safe
I thought SoftLayer was going to be IBM's cloud solution? How did that acquisition turn out?
"IBM unveils cloud for 5G telcos, gets Nokia and Samsung as partnersNow we will take on Alibaba and rule the world..."
"There is no harm in being cautiously optimistic, but as a long-term investor and observer, I can't see IBM building a base much over 140 this year. Too many unknowns, uncertainties, and too much inertia. Plus, the company still has a lot of debt to work off. Next year, however, the stock may break strongly to the upside. I'm talking about the new IBM without ""NewCo."" IBM has a lot of creative and entrepreneurial talent that it has only now begun to tap into."
Kiss of death. It hit a 5% yield this morning so I bought some IBM. LOL. Look out below!
maybe this article need to be here...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2nd-gen-amd-epyc-processors-130010045.html
Blockchain and cryptocurrency stocks I'm watching: $AMD $INTC $NVDA $BKPPF $HIVE.V $KASH.V $MU $IBM
How will this impact IBM in China: https://www.thelayoff.com/t/12zOy4fT
Turnaround is going to be faster than expected.
time seems right to invest
"earnings due TOMORROW WEDNESDAY no idea if tahts before or after the bell, anyone,,its not today"
"It is not difficult to see what is the new IBM's dream team is doing. Their focus is to use the covid to restructure to focus rebuilding around cloud as the new core. IBM is trading at value multiples rather than growth multiples enjoyed by the likes of MSFT . Once restructured, IBM will switch to trading at growth multiples"
"Can't even get a dead cat bounce out of this POS. This company either will continue it's death spiral or get rid of their CEO plus the majority of board. I thought 120's was going to be the bounce territory, now It looks like the trend will continue till the end. Sad ending to a storied company. Just think if it were a bad economy, it would already be over for IBM."
"IBM shows its business is growing again the second quarter, it has passed the inflection point and the results are very good. The trend is the friend, keep up growth momentum. first quarter typically is the smallest and slowest.. , 9% growth is growth. Directionally , it is pointing upward. Continue to collect increasing dividend 23 years in a row."
Salesforce and other cloud leaders are eating then alive.
So glad I’m buying the dip amazing dividend let’s go baby 
"A best guess, IBM will have to drop below 100 before Ginny is removed or otherwise no longer the CEO"
$150 not far away!
IBM And Event Investing $IBMhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4198770
How many chances or quarters do we give big blue? My patience is running out owning this in two accounts at 146 and another at 133. Thank God for the dividend to wait but this lack of progress is brutal. I would have thought Redhat acquisition would have helped by now and new CEO. I will hold it but looking for some performance ASAP!!!! My long theory was a turnaround story like Microsoft. They/IBM execs talk a good game but we need to see results now. Make it happen BLUE or become another GE.
Let's go IBM.. Show the world the quantum computing!!
"IBM merges with? We are entering the economic cycle where the really big mergers are starting to take place, today it is Glaxo with Pfizer. Tomorrow, it could be IBM with Amazon? Apple? Google? Microsoft? It will be with one of those four at around $200+ a share. Stay tuned."
"IBM is a long term buy and hold at these levels. May go a little lower, but not much."
I think the future of IBM is only spinoff of cloud business .
I will buy more tomorrow if the price is below $125
I'm not an owner but this looks like a great buying opportunity.
"well...we're now down 15% since earnings 2 weeks ago!! How's that 4% dividend feeling now??Ginny, fate just called and said ""you've failed"". FIND A REPLACEMENT!!"
ibm had a foundry which was sold to globalfoundries in 2014 who still makeserver chips for ibm . so it's not like this is ibm's 1st rodeo in chip market.besides both samsung and intc have collobration with ibm. my take is ibm will license out 2nm techology to these two.globalfoundries is thinking of IPO. That's worth watching. ibm kept r@d going in chip tech thru some rough times and nowit's big time payback coming.
"IBM has make itself too comfortable as a business of service instead of an IT company that is why I think Warren Buffet has invested into it but as we can see is that as an IT company if you can't lead the market, then you will soon be forgotten by it. A good example would be Microsoft was lagging behind Amazon from Cloud service before but the new CEO has completely changed the direction of the company and re-focus the company to cloud service. And now , things are picking up for them."
When Ginni is replaced how will the stock price react?$3....$5....$10....or no change...
Both CEOs looked quite jittery when asked what the value add of this deal is. They clearly had trouble articulating it. And I'm still very intrigued what 15 clouds Rometty keeps referring to. I think she is confusing clouds with clouds based applications. Anyways I'm sure the IBM supporters will know what these 15 are. Enlighten us. Please.
Alibaba and IBM were the top two blockchain patent filing contenders in 2020.
Ibm = ge of the tech world...
Slowly bleeding off Wednesday's gain. I knew it was too good to be true!
Isn't it time to break out? It is way better than Snow
"Nothing ever goes straight up! Healthy pullback. No volume to it compared to the up days. Sit back and collect your dividends this year. You have been through the worse. Revenue to rise, earnings to rise, debt will be paid down and in two years buybacks will start back. Don’t be impatient. Good times on the horizon but will not happen overnight."
"45 minutes in. 1 million traded and through and appears to be holding 126, do my eyes deceive me or is this significant buying. personally I believe ibm is grossly undervalued but in the past 3 years the market hasn't agreed"
"No reaction to red hat earnings? Looks pretty good to me, been out of IBM for awhile but thinking about jumping back in."
What is IBM's main business strength?
Ginny and her leadership team are and have been the problem. The board needs to take their duties seriously and replace the CEO. She has a few direct reports that need to be moved out as well.
I'm of the opinion that IBM will be testing a new high this week.
"i am throwing my hands up,, i give up on 2020 for IBM, all i can do is put it away and hope the dividends help from the losses we will see all year, No stock growth at all, probably never will see it get to 150"
Shorts love playing IBM. They will let it get to $140 and then bring it down. They'll do this over and over again. We need a short squeeze.
Get rid of the CEO and void the deal.
"im coming to collect, shorty. i warned you last night, which leg would you like broken?"
IBM wearing the trumpie red hats now .
Beamer will pop some this week
Dow & Nasdaq up 1% IBM only half of that. I guess we should be thankful that it held on to the measliest of the measly.
Block chain
Remember that Anonymous guy who had a $220 price target on IBM earlier this year. What happened to him?
I'm probably the only one that has some confidence in Ginny
Fun fact: Guess who has the oldest Board of Directors in the Fortune 500? Yep! you guessed it!! IBM has the oldest BoD in the Fortune 500 at 68.2 years of age!Another fun fact: The only board member who has left in the last 14 years was due to death!! Clubby you say? You bet it is.It is little wonder this dinosaur is doing so poorly when its board was around when they walked the earth.Led by fossils in a young man's game. They should take a lesson from their field operations who fire everyone over 50.
"If Crammer says buy, good reason to sell. The guy has been wrong 80% of the time. The big money analysts dont like KOO KOO Ginny for sure."
"Great Q. Great guidance. Turnaround is doing just fine. I'm buying.But sell oh weak one, just sell."
"An EPYC surge! ""The Redwood City, Calif., tech company plans to deploy Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to help Zoom Video deal with an epic surge of interest in its videoconferencing services.""Epic for EPYC not $intc not $nvda lol not even late $ibm ... $zm got the best with $orcl not with Google Azure and Amazon!"
"Hey shorts, I'm still waiting for that double digit prediction you mentioned a couple weeks ago"
Lol TANK IBM TANK
Let's see if IBM can close above its 200 day for at least several days then I'll be optimistic that it'll break out into the 130s or higher
Investing in individual stocks is risky business !!! It's a new era now. IBM was the go to stock in the 1980's and 1990's. Not anymore. Don't get married to a stock.
Buying at $145
Not bad Big Blue. Not bad at all. Now we just need to get to $180-$200 before the IBM-Kyndryl spin-off!
"time to sell, i have enought of IBM, Who need business anyway? Ppl want games, ill go to buy MSFT, they got X Box! Watson? Yes i belived this may be a big hit, but now we have Alexa, so what? Mainframe? In fact IBM wants to abondon the only profitable business they got left, hardware, Cell etc...I dont get it. Why get out of hardware, hardware can be sold...."
IBM will monetize Watson. Soon see 200.
I more analyst upgrade with Redhat acquisition. Look at Analysts section
IBM needs to invest a portion of their cash into BTC! As a tech / cloud / blockchain company this would be quite reasonable + rocket the share price like MSTR.

"If the BOD refuses to fire her after the results, which are expected to be a disappointment per ZACKS, then we as shareholder must vote them out during the next election! everyone must vote because they gave themselves MILLIONS of shares at little or no cost. So we need everyone!"
Beamer is BACK!
"Trump indirectly fired Boeing CEO. Next, he will fire the IBM CEO."
me buy ibm... me like
Is the dividend safe??? I lost on Ford. Said dividend safe and then suspended. IBM seems to be following what happened to Ford. It was for the good of company and share holders—-we were told. - almost cut in half overnight. If dividend dropped what will the stock drop to?
Does today's action reflect Zack analysis of IBM versus Apple?
Did you guys short IBM this morning? Always win guarantee!
"If Ginny feels the heat, she'll go to her usual playbook and increase stock buybacks. Though given the buybacks that have already taken place, she may not have much more wiggle room."
This is next GE in making. Won't be able to pay down debt for life.
I just lost 20% of my entire portfolio because of this
Whatever you might think about the fundamentals...Technically this thing is running on all cylinders.

"Any news on whether or not they’ll purchase Cloudera? IBM is dominating the private weather industry, which is highly undervalued imo. Grabbing cloudera would be icing on the cake for us longs."
going to run up strait to $125+++++today
IBM is considering changing its name to International Blockchain Management.
"CNBC interview with Lisa Su has revealed important insight on NEW INITIATIVES and INVESTMENT! Now that amd can afford to pay $1B debt earlier, Lisa was asked shouldn't amd expand to new areas and invest. Answer was amd is doing that.. so need stay tuned. Especially was discussing AI and machine learning. That's what $ibm partnership could be about and amd investment is in that hence key ibm's people moved to AMD related to cognitive AI and learning and a tight GPUs and CPUs integration. Lisa Su has explained on CNBC this special integration won the exascale supercomputer Frontier and other HPC supercomputers. Now she said you'll see this for learning and GPUs! HUGE! A partnership like that will send amd's pps to the roof!"
"Big blue had Watson years before Amazons Alexa or google ai, they could’ve cornered cloud but failed because they never try to lower there prices and go after consumers sad"
"Buy IBM, not Apple. IBM has a good future."
Average annual return over past 20 years is about 3.2%
IBM now 6.3% the Mkt Cap of MSFT. Not even 15 IBMs equals the value of MSFT. Unthinkable. Activists Wanted!
beat
is fast talking dunderhead rometty still there????...or is she on tv again???...oh yeah it's both
"Ms. Rometty needs to go. She massacred the old tech guard, a repository of tech competence, and did massive PC promotions. IBM is now largely a hollow shell compared to its glory days. Not clear whether dumping incompetentupper management (including Rometty) would be enough, but it would give a spike to the stock."
Too many naysayers on this board which equals up we go! Buy.
Almost all stocks are doing good except this one. This should be trading above $200.
"IBM has made the right moves! Don't listen to the negative ""short"" people who are getting clobbered. IBM is heading upward!jg"
This message board is becoming useless with all of the $$$$ sign postings being made by one individual. The $$$$ rants go on and on. Can't Yahoo delete this poster??? Why can't I designate these postings as spam and never have to see them?
"Couldn't handle those nose bleed levels (150+) ... lol. But once it does, the sky's the limit!!!"
Rock star! Today was not the expectation.... but the new sheriff and team may be that wake up we all anticipate. The sleeping giant will insert itself back into the conversation. Should be an interesting year for investors. Traders..... whatev.
The street is ignoring the significance of the quantum tie-up with the Cleveland Clinic. Buy.
IPwe and IBM Seek to Transform Corporate Patents With Next Generation NFTs Using IBM Blockchain
Morgan Stanley said best case is 180 in 2021. have a position and adding on dips. With the corona virus it will take time. Buyers at the current level imho will do well. But the key is long term which to me is 3-5 yrs out.
IBM was added to Valuelines Income and appreciation portfolio II. I HOPE They are right
Earnings in afternoon or morning
I think I liked Trumps economy better
"Do you think the Biden tax plan to tax corporations at a 40%+ rate is a good idea? Maybe if your on the GOVT dole, again, but if that happens and Biden is elected and he raises the taxes to what he has proposed. we will all be unemployed."
When this split /new company comes about what happens to IBM share price? Does it go down because 19 billion is split from the company? Does the share price go down and we make it up with new shares from the new company? I guess its a time will tell.
"At a forward PE below 10, IBM can easily see a 20% short term rally given the recent cloud growth numbers. This news gives the emotional boost to reset the stock price to a more fair value. I see $166 year end target. Good luck!"
"My hand got cut many times while trying to catch the falling knife, but I finally caught it."
Wow. Look at the way AAPL is heading to $500. I still believe IBM also can double the current value in near future. Hybrid cloud and red hat can make this happen!
Another day's gains turned into a loss. Way to go IBM!
"Im long $AMD... Congrats to $INTC... IMO, investors going into $INTC’s EPS , may have been expecting less... therefore , with a beat I can see the run up....Also in tandem with their CEO on CNBC earlier... it was good enough... akin to $IBM’s EPS... Trepidation gping into EPS... & b/c it was ‘good enough’ $IBM went up after EPS..."
Looks good for run up to 150 by mid February.
"Watch Krishna, IBM CEO tomorrow at Squawk box. Should be interesting."
Just got my dividend drip today! Yea! Keep increasing that dividend and all is well!
"i've seen this movie before. CEO makes bad acquisition. gets fired few years later and goes to another tech company.meanwhile, employees and shareholders suffer from past CEOS mistakes. new CEO has nice pay package and screws up the next company."
buy buy buy buy today aftermarket hours.
I have had major losses with IBM but I am still here. Is there any hope it will get back too or near my purchase price of $160 or do I sit and be content with the dividends?
IBM closing in on its 52 week low down another 4+ today. Someone wake up the BOD!
"Rometty is doing a good job to right the ship, the outlook seems very promising right now."
"I'd buy more, but I'm out of ammo. Not gonna sell my MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, NVDA etc. to buy more IBM. Only thing I could do is wait for my dividends and hope IBM hovers around this price for me to scoop up more"
"IBM is an empty shell of a company that outsourced most of its it department to India. Rometty damaged IBM beyond repair...if you want a company that does good buy msft. They just strengthend their gameing business, sth that IBM will never understand. They got stuck in the 80 ths...W Buffet had a reason to sell..."
IBM will continue to trade in a tight range. If earnings are bad it will slide to 139. The stock will never get above 165 while KOO KOO Ginny is in the CEO chair.
"I'm an IBM retiree with 30+ years of service. With the 1stQ results, we get the same words and music as the last 19 Quarters.With all the PR announcements on mergers,partnerships,alliances, etc.,etc. we get zero revenue growth! 20 Quarters of smoke and no fire. There has to be a management shakeup or the company will continue to go down the drain.I wonder if management is being made aware of these and similar postings and the real concerns people are articulating"
"Someone packed the exchange of 1,7M shares around 112.90 this morning at 9:33, that's a lot of money!"
I once sold IBM AT 180. Call me very lucky. CEO has got to go. Want income. I like M at the current pps imo. Do your own dd.
Should we be concerned that IBM (in classic IBM style) is gutting another major business after heavy investment and advertising? Talking about Blockchain.
Layoffs in Watson Health division. Shocking.
this dog finally showed life--still underwater
$ibm is the golden standard for SECURITY on any IT and cloud. Very conservative as big ibm's enterprises care about security first. Ibm has launched cloud computing with amd's epyc rome straight all over the world! No beta no preview no limited availability! They sure had to invest multu $billions and had to test EPYC Rome for security before that. It's not $intc it's not $nvda it's all AMD. PPS moves up accordingly while other semis killed!
"CSCO planning aggressive buyback if tax reform passesBackground on companies with high tax reform repatriation potential https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/26/goldman-these-companies-are-headed-for-a-big-tax-break-on-overseas-cash.html Related info from Cisco earnings call on 15 Nov 2017 James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a question on capital structure. Can you give us an idea of what your preferences and priorities will be in capital structure in terms of buybacks and acquisitions, etc. if the proposed new tax changes pass versus if that change in tax law gets derailed? I'm particularly curious as to how you're thinking about the pacing of acquisitions versus buybacks, etc. Thank you. Kelly Kramer -- Chief Financial Officer I'll take that one. What I'd say is in terms of acquisitions, the tax policy isn't impacting us either way because we are lucky to have a great cash flow and access to capital. So, it hasn't been stopping us from anything from an acquisition perspective and it won't. So, that will continue. I would say we're definitely encouraged by the progress that's going on, on the tax reform. So, like we said in the past, when that happens and if we get a repatriation which both plans currently have, we're going to continue like we have, growing or dividend with our earnings growth and where we have opportunity is really to get much more aggressive than we have been on the share buyback and of course we want to make sure we continue to have enough firepower to continue to be able to do the right acquisitions to help position Cisco right for the long term. https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2017/11/16/cisco-systems-csco-q1-2018-earnings-conference-cal.aspx"
"So undervalued, a steal at this price in my opinion"
"They must be thinking the next years will be great because they are paying through the nose for Redhat, Raising dividend and issuing $20 billion of senior unsecured bonds to help fund its acquisition of Red Hat Inc. I dont see it given the last few quarters but Im not in the board room while they play with the companies future."
"I have confidence in IBM. I didn’t hear the conference call, but does anyone know if they gave an explanation for the poor performance of the cloud segment on a yoy basis? I can understand the big sell off if no explanation was given. While the words of the CEO are comforting, they don’t mean much at this point. Perhaps IBM will have to consistently perform for at least 2-3 quarters to give investors the confidence that it is on the right track. The silver lining is that the margins appear to be improving. I really hope that the CEO is not letting his team and the workers be distracted by the “newco’ spinoff. I won’t be averaging my investments just yet."
"Is dividend safe? Seems like IBM will benefit from the new ""work at home"" business model."
and tsmc will announce that their 2nm chip will be out a year before IBMs....oh weird
"IBM sports an excellent dividend and has an excellent growth opportunity ahead due to Blockchain, AI, cloud, open source, serverless, you name it."
When will the board say enough is enough!!!
kramer says buy! buy! buy!!!!
Vote your shares to FIRE the BOD. THEY HAVE FAILED in their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders.
THIS COMPANY WILL STAY SEMI DEAD UNTILL THE TIME COMES FOR THIS WOMAN TO GO TO OLD AGE HOME.. UNTILL THAT TIME KEEP WAITING
How high this will go guys
have REDHAT CEO RUN IBM please!!!
I think we bottom out at 120. We shall see.
i like IBM here at this price ...good things will come out of its acquisition of Red Hat. Will really help them position for more business in the data center. give it time. new management. .. the dividend is nice and fat too.
IBM was going to use the full power of Watson and harness it's AI to find therapeutics to fight COVID. This was part of the Smarter Planet agenda. How is that working out?
"what is going on here, I was happy with dividend, but this is going up while appl struggling...."
"Just as in April 2018 ER (look it up), AMD's PPS was pushed down to $9 with shorts attacking and many bashing including the trolls posting here. Scares such as it's going down to $2 or chaets TA it's pulling back to $2-$4 or Lisa Su is leaving etc were used. We know the PPS has never seen $9 again since and the rest is history. Today after market closing the AMD's Financial Analyst Day will start in CA. Contrary to the name, it's not just about dry accounting numbers. It's about a future products vision, leadership and goals both technology and financial modeling wise to last 3 years, into 2023.To see the last such event and its products significance read attached. The author is a technology guy, former AMD's employee. Vast vision and products roadmap, margins, growth and earnings modeling too. This is the ""best is yet to come"" Lisa Su has promised. I implore you to think about it and consider your position in AMD...!Yesterday's news on AMD winning the El Captain supercomputer was just the begining. Not only $nvda and $intc didn't win. The curious news lack mentioning that $ibm lost this too as IBM were working with nVidia and Power processors used NVLink what AMD will have with Infinity Fabric connection between CPUs and GPUs. The loss of IBM pretty much seals AMD's position as the leader not just for supercomputing one of, but Datacenters and Cloud and Enterprise IT!We've seen IBM's technical leadership suddenly hired by AMD. We have heard IBM last September endorsement of EPYC Rome for cloud computing citing Artificial Intelligence computations. We've just seen HPE / Cray will work with AMD for AI computations for the El Captain. These aren't just random signs. It's the future and the best is yet to come future! Displacing IBM and nVidia out of supercomputing win at the DOE is huge. El Capitan is stated to work as a cloud. Yes HPC computations but cloud management that ports to datacenters cloud. There's $100m additional investment to develop AMD's open source software for AI. This is huge but just a hint to much more to be announced today!Consider your AMD's position carefully. ..you may not have another chance after today....Read the 2017 Financial Analyst Day article. It's not an yearly eventm it's VERY significant way more than an ER...Good luck to all!https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2017/05/20/amds-financial-analyst-day-2017-on-the-cusp-of-greatness-again/amp/"
IBM down 10+ pts after bad earnings. Time to vote your shares in march and FIRE the BOD!!!
"IBM's blockchain is like everything else IBM these days. All talk no substance. Even Ginny herself so much as admitted it two weeks back. They have no answer, nothing whatsoever on the AWS Blockhain. Same with cloud, IBM is barely in the top 10 cloud providers. Same with AI lightyears behind Google. Same with quantum, Google is far more advanced in building quantum chips. There is nothing left in IBM these days that I would consider worth buying, probably with the exception of their Power machines, those are still best of breed. But their whole services and what they called the strategic imperatives are far behind their competitors, and very expensive still. I doubt if in any areas they are still a top 5 provider, except mainframe maintenance, I guess."
Snowflake (SNOW) same value as IBM OMG. Red Hat alone has 5 times the sales of SNOW. unreal.
Where are the guys who kept saying this was headed for 200?
"I was just wondering, where is Whitehurst? In all the fluff announcements that came out last week, why haven't we seen or heard from him. It's supposed to be all about RedHat and openshift, he would have been the perfect person to discuss this. Anyway much better than the one that came on yahoo which obviously did not know what it was all about, after fast talking through a rehearsed paragraph it fell apart in buzzwords, mumbling and stuttering. So anyone knows where Whitehurst is and why he is not being pushed forward."
"Here's why one needs do independent deep technology understanding and not trust anything. Latest example $ibm 3 directors buy shares in coordination or coincidence at the same time? So latest trick to wave at innocent investors to suggest that the emperor's new clothes are amazing but the directors see them better than you. Don't be fooled. IBM's board of directors was preceding for years of decline. Do you think they now ""see"" those new clothes to as of by magic 3 of them deciding to huy shares...?Don't be fooled. ..! Think for yourself about AMD...no one else can do it for you. Search :""3 Different IBM Insiders Just Bought (A Lot of) Stock: Should You Follow?"""
"IBM may beat estimates because they have been lowered 50% since the last report. Last quarter estimate was 4.80 per share, this quarter analyst have IBM expectation at 2.20 a share. Dont believe it? Check the earnings for yourself."
"if i had to guess, it looks like some hedge funds are lowering the amount of share they own. There is not a great deal of volume. All it takes is a slight imbalance between those wishing to sell and those wishing to buy for the price to go down. the reverse is true as well. IBm has a fantastic assortment of products, and is well positioned. I like there AI (Watson, etc.) products."
"Putin endorsement of blockchain and soon will announce supporting policy. “The Stone Age has not ended due to lack of stones, but because new technologies have appeared. And now new technologies appear in the world.” Putin said that those who are “late in the race” would be dependent on leaders who adopted blockchain early"
"Other than Watson, AI, this company is going nowhere longer term."
"If U want to be taxed on every stock trade, vote for Joe Biden. It's called a Financial Transaction Tax. Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and AOC all in favor of an FTT."
"IBM has better cloud data management/storage than SNOW and they are focusing on BLOCKCHAIN, which is also what forbes startup TSNP, soon to be HUMBL PAY, is working on with their PayPal Blockchain model."
"IBM Cloud is #3 behind AWS and Azure ... there is a huge gap between the top 3 and the next two, Google Cloud and Oracle. IBM Cloud is comfortable safe at 16% market share in the #3 spot, made formidable with RedHat"
Too much focus by management on divs. Bring back Lou Gerstner
"IBM is now a SAAS Cloud Company! Red Hat revenue, up 24 percent!! Multiple Expansion Coming!!! BOOM!!!!"
"Why IBM does not create consumer products to raise its visibility in the technology of AI, IOT and Watson space? It seems to too passive to wait for others to create killer apps when it has amass thousands of patents. It is making great free cash flow but needs to aggressively produce usable applications than a platform itself. You start wth a business problem and find technology solution to solve and provide value. It seems that it is creating platform that find a business problem to fit in. Is it not wrong in execution? I hope that the new CEO will break it up into 5 subsidiaries so that they are not bound by the constraints of a large company. .Perhaps the CEO is too old to have the kind of energy. But I do impressed with its moat to ble able to have lunch with French President, the top executives of JPM, and the likes. Hopefully, she either find a capable left and right hand man, or quit just to infuse new blood and change the market perception. . At current price, it is definitely undervalued, it just need the billion dollars deal and ability to solve client's problem, Perhpas they should poach some Google executives.."
IBM could and should get involved in Finance Tech (FinTech) area and would do very well. No vision and no leadership!
Will be 125 in days. Big tech wins even bigger withBiden and if trump wins people will be happy as well

James Cramer likes new IBM strategy and so do I. Remember Microsoft is a dud with Balmer for many years then came Satya and the stock doing great for last few years.
"Technical, IBM may drop to 139$ by friday"
"Do we expect IBM to drop further so that we can back the truck up and ride it toward 1,000?"
Investors have zero faith in Rometty. She should already be gone long time ago. I agree the article with below link:https://www.barrons.com/articles/ibm-stock-gain-earnings-51579733460?mod=BarronsTechNewsletter&mod=djem_b_Weekly%20BarronsTechNewsletter?mod=article_signInButton&ns=prod/accounts-barrons
"This co is stuck in 1975 very dangerous to own at these levels. I'm not short but think we could see this sub-100 this year. Need a new CEO to reinvent strategic direction of company. Failing board and failing leadership, very dangerous to own here."
IBM needs to sack their ceo put red hat mgmt in
"IBM is still selling at less than 10X (non-GAAP) EPS and less than 11X forward free cash flow - all while converting to a subscription model for its software. So is it a ""Value"" or is it a ""Value Trap""? (I'm long so you know where I stand).BTW - sorry to the shorts. The ""short on the earnings announcement"" strategy worked very well for the last few years, but not this time."
switch to Apple and Disney. they have more fans and get pumped on TV repeatedly. don't look at P/E. it's irrelevant these days. money flow is most important. new products get people excited.
"IBM has managers reporting to managers who report to managers and so on. 6 layers of management between those who actually do the work and senior management. If they got rid of three layers of managers, who do nothing but add cost to each service or product that gets sold, thousands of jobs could be opened to fill the technical expertise loss that is badly needed to keep IBM on top of the tech heap. Instead...IBM C-Suite keeps these people on the payroll because they all want their boot licking lackeys."
Today a holiday? Volume is in a rut.
If your putting all your money into IBM. You'll be living in a trailer down by the river.
Are we going to get dividend today?
fire Ginny -- the gal is getting rich [ selling stock options ] while shareholder is holding the bag. She never puts her own moneyinto purchases -- a fraud ! Is she out golfing at Augusta today ?
Adding right here a gift. buying low is how you get rich.
With the new changes taking place at this company expect an exodus of talent
First quarter results are going to have to be stellar for IBM
Has anyone listened to the $ibm earnings call? Any details on ibm's cloud offering using AMD CPUs and GPUs for hybrid with clients including security VMWare AI analytics etc? Thanks. ..
"It is time to get a new CEO. Present CEO cannot move this huge ship. She talks and talks, but ..........?"
"Some massive buying at the close today, but down after hours? Hard to figure this one. I think you buy and hold."
Barrons cover story: Blockchain/IBM.
IBM is still generating a fair amount of free cash flow and profit. I bought a good deal of Microsoft in 2010 and 2011 when many thought they had become a dinosaur and were not cool Glad I did that. I'll take cash flow thank you very much. It takes a long time to turn a aircraft carrier but once they come into the wind they can deliver a pretty good punch.
"ibm was destroyed by ginni rometty, who had no business running a tech company.at least now they have an engineer running the show, could be a similar story to amd."
"Once again, another fail at the 200 day SMA and now, trading below its 5 day SMA!! More short term pain ahead ..."

Approaching a 10 year low. Not a good sign.
Dem's & fake news medium should craw back under there Rock's.
"Lock-up period is 6 months, wait for exact 6 months when Redhat employees, execs sell their equity. At least 10% dropping opportunity to the shorters here."
cannot believe that the IBM BOD is agreeing to buffoon rometty's hail mary pass with the company riding on it.
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-is-a-zombie-company-analyst-122944734.html""Yes, IBM’s cloud business is growing, but it pales in comparison to the competition. Its second-quarter cloud revenue climbed 5%. Microsoft’s Azure enjoyed revenue growth of 73% in its fiscal third quarter, while AWS jumped more than 41% in its first quarter."""
Change at the top at IBM is long overdue.Board of Directors need to grow a spine and find a competent CEO.
I'll get sum at 5% div yield- and not a fraction lower..
"Nice to see IBM stock turn around, should have kept my shares instead of flipping them."
"wow... after listening to the earnings call, can tell a lot of people posting figures and information here are spreading FUD. not going in blindly, but to say that the tax rate in 2017 is 6% and could be almost 20% in 2018 is not only a lie, it is irresponsible."
big blue is now big red
"Holding 1000 shares of IBM. long term. Dividend of 6.52 has blown out any losses in original share price. a conondrum: we hold 1500 shares of NVDA. ie $750,000. the question: ditch the NVDA shares put the $$ into 6000+ shares of IBM= $40,000 in dividend money, plus IBM shares are headed from here to around $400 a share in two years, or simply stay in the NVDA shares 1500 and watch these move from $550 to $1000 or $2000. tough call. I am leaning toward making the move to put all of this NVDA $$ into IBM. Doubt IBM? Vanguard holds $9 billion in shares. BlackRock holds. $7.3 billion in IBM shares. you dont see any of these huge $management companies selling...it is a lovely problem to have but it is still a tough call. I am leaning toward putting all the NVDA $$ at $600 into IBM..."
"Ginny and the CFO trying to use buzzwords i.e. ""hybrid cloud"" to conceal continued top line decline. Buzzwords don't sell...... product and solutions do. One question, how much of IBM will be left after the Ginny failure?"
When will this be back at 200?
This is a very tempting entry point to open a new short position. Eventually this will drop anyway.
Are we going to see a run up before ex div anticipating IBM increasing the div amount?
In at the bell
I believe that until the opening it looks green
like being at a casino
"I think its very difficult to comeback on cloud business even thought Red hat is strong on customer base, with such high debt and competition with leader like Amazon, Microsoft , google and more."
didn't see that on ibm for a long time... nice... :)
Diamond in teh rough
$120 looks good today as a breaker point
"Every-time Rommety opens her trap, flies come flying out and the stock drops. 138, next stop. BOD do your fiduciary responsibility and fire this CEO!"
2 nm...can't keep from thinking about. Could IBM own chip-making in the not so distant future?
The good news is that I am only down $35/share vs the $40 I was down!
Keeping an eye out. I can’t see a scenario where this falls before 150 without any bad news but if it does I’ll be adding more
Attractive earnings and dividend in boom or buat time. Many companies have trust in IBM and services with it. IBM is trying to help client to solve problems.
"Given price action, people obviously selling into the strength.. This will probably close lower sadly!"
"Sorry to say, but I'm leaving the IBM conversations blog. I'll be back when I read the words in the headlines, ""She's Gone."""
IBM will be OK in the future. Dividend is great.
As exciting as watch paint dry. IBM lost its mojo....
"IBM's performance is a sad commentary on the CEO Rometty and the BOD ! It is sad that mismanagement is destroying an icon of the US that supported many with jobs and pensions! Will the big shareholders wake up and act soon, before it is too late!"
going higher
"What is IBM these days? They are advertising they save human lives, water buffalo, studying impact of deserts, not sure there are a lot of customers that need those services or products."
"For 2018 IBM is changing its name to ""International Blockchain Machine""."
I listened to everything that the New Ceo said and i have total confidence in him i also like his hires. he said that good things to come for IBM. Believe that the virus gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy this stock and a few select others.
Down 27 points (17%) in the last three weeks. Down 45 points (26%) from the yearly high. And tomorrow looks no better. At what point does the BoD grow a pair?
Did the BOD do anything yet except play pocket pool?
"IBM spin-off can merge with Dell , HP, Accenture etc. A lot of potential."
"Some buys are a given. At 106, IBM was a screaming screaming buy. I just can't believe people were selling at that price. Especially with the dividend announcement"
"Almost 20% revenue increase in both Cloud and Red Hat, impressive work."
"As far as AI is concerned, the difference between IBM and the rest is that IBM talks about it while the others are making progress. When it comes to AI, IBM is nowhere, unless they still count on Watson to play a jeopardy game."
IBM still can't hold 1:40 and if you're in the stock for Price appreciation good luck if you're in for a dividend play you couldn't hold for a while ivms going no place
Never should have gone down after last earnings report was so solid. Continue to print money and return a lot of it to shareholders. The upward correction will continue
"Just look at that Premarket action, already this morning."
"Bought at 118usd. I’m not worry, i’m feel very confident. Looking forward to the split of the company."
IBM is not out and will capture sentiment. Stable moving forward and a nice yield.
"Forward Pes are already a analyst trickery to make crazy expensice stocks look cheap, i would even less see them as a source of reliable info right now $NVDA $TSLA $IBM $MSFT"
I don't the aggregate of two companies consultancy and cloud company will be more than the sum of IBM right now .
IBM has become a great defensive play. Market tank while this stock is down slightly to up slightly
IBM - biggest turkey in tech.
"just have to break that 148 barrier. it will definitely happen after earnings but if it can happen before, 170 here we come with the quickness"
Pay day today! Enjoyed the gains. Still hold core position.
New support is 145.....soon to be 150 perhaps?
This stock fly
"Pump and Dump at it's finest. below opening and has dropped more than 2.5. you have to love this stock, not. Selling, good luck longs."
"I agree with the $180 value per share this year. That is the MS projection by their ace analyst.That would give IBM a 13 PE based on 2018 projections of income of $13.85 per share ($13.85 x 13). But that projection is quite low given the breakout of the IBM high growth sections, including the new main frame computer. These are fast growth sectors, and for that reason I think a 15 PE can be justified. For that reason I expect the stock price to reach $207 within the next 12 months.I add IBM stock regularly and the dividend we will receive tomorrow will be used to buy additional IBM stock"
If IBM was smart they would try to aggressively pursue AMD. Offer $60 a share. Not only do you get a great and growing company but you get Dr Su to run IBM.
Thinking about selling my position in Microsoft to load up more on IBM. Thoughts?
Mkt's way up IBM down and the trend continues. This has been and will continue to be a short.
There needs to be a CEO Pay pullback clause.
ceo needs to go
"Interesting that it looks like Apple is putting their new campus at the same place that IBM has their largest US presence, Research Triangle Park in N.C. I still say that Apple buys IBM using cash and treasury stock and this is the reason Ginni Rometty hasn't retired or been fired because it's all a moot point when they get acquired."
"all clouds seem to grow drastically, including IBM cloud...clouds and pharmacists are probably the only thing that will positively undergo a corona crisis...well...maybe alcohol and drugs too...at least on Wall Street...I expect surprisingly good financial report on April 20..."
"Criss-cross e commerce,fineancial all kinds of transaxion gonna hit 1 trillion$ in 2020 from 260 billlion$. This is a so huge arena almost no one talks about it . I think any company with necessary platform like IBM with block chain sys gonna make some real dough in his field."
"@brennis, why bearish?"
This stock is now closer to $50 than $150. But at least you have your precious dividend.
"IBM (NYSE:IBM) rose 1.8% after getting a Street-high price target on expected growth ahead.BofA Securities set the price target for IBM at $175 from $153, forecasting sustaining growth after it spins off its infrastructure services business later this year, StreetInsider reported. Analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a buy rating on the company after hosting an investor call with Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna.""IBM is seeing the majority of clients adopting a hybrid cloud approach given regulations, latency concerns and data sovereignty,"" Mohan said. ""Red Hat enables customers to deploy workloads seamlessly between private/public clouds and on-prem. Since acquiring Red Hat in 2019, IBM has improved growth rates into the high teens sustainably."" The IT services business spinoff will help simplify the company's structure, Mohan said. IBM's had a bumpy 12 months but shares have risen more than 20% in the past two months, in part thanks to earnings for the quarter ended in March that trounced estimates. Investing: IBM Rises on Street-High Price Target"
"MSFT is teaching IBM a lesson in how to run a cloud business. 59% growth on an already much larger base. Kinda proves that the whole IBM hybrid cloud story is very questionable. If IBM really would have anything to offer in could services and what they call hybrid cloud, their technology services division which I assume is running with this would be growing significantly also, yet they are declining at a fairly rapid pace. Today we'll see what AMZN will be posting, more of the same I would guess."
If I had to guess.....I’d say they miss shares fall 5-7 percent.
A PE ratio of 13 and a steady dividend is considered bad ?
"IBM will go up becall the junk companies that have NO P/E , lose money every week,month,year - just like WEWORK -- want some insight ""WEWORK"" doesnt work - Just like Tesla ,BITJUNK,CRM, and BABA (the great China backed PONZI that won't let anyone look at thier books and are really just a worthless Island holding company you own NOTHING. The Government is in on it by forcing Americans to ""invest in the Junk"" The Banks can't help themselves , And the Owners of Facebook YADAYADA YADA - pay you nothing forowning the non voting shares you ""own"" . Yes short term the Governments will back these junk piles they let go ""public"" But when ZERO interest rates no longer look good ? Its over."
This is great news! We could see $150 this week and have a new 52 week high!
Market up...IBM down.
with $ 86B in debt this company is not going anyplace but down for decades to come.
IBM may follow ADBE after switching its core business to cloud!I can double in 2-3 years!

Are we FINALLY breaking out on this one?
"A decent quarter but, I'm just going to take my 5 point profit and split."
Finally a CEO doing HIS job!!!! Would've never seen Ginni do this!!!
"down almost 6% in AH. maybe a buy soon, at like $145"
Raise the dividend? I expect that news today.
what exactly does ibm do?
I am here because of the IBM AMD and IBM GOOGLE partnerships. Those fundamentals will skyrocket IBM
This stock first crossed $130 in 1999!! Way to go IBM!
What will happen to IBM if a new CEO is announced Q2 ER when Ginni turns 61? Will pps go up or down? Will new CEO continue Ginni agenda or do something different? How pps be affected in the long run?
"That's better, green after hours."
No news on a big drip like this? What is cause of this severe drop?
"unreal after the dividend day this has been selling and shorted down everyday,, what is going on with this stock, its as bad as owning VZ, T, PFE, KR"
"With IBM asserting itself with 2 nm and quantum computing aka Cleveland Clinic, sellers here are way too early. Buy."
Relax people - blockchain and cloud services are up and coming. Rome wasn’t built in a day. It wasn’t even that bad of a miss. Buy some and hold for a year or two.
At least IBM isn't letting me down today. All sadness over on the CVS board. So quiet over here....
"What will everyone be thinking when US GDP hits 4-5%+ next year? RHT is in a growth in both revenues and EPS, if IBM builds it's company and clients around this model it should do the same. RHT CEO should take over IBM or at least be a good part of advising along with RHT""s board members... this is a super strong team if you believe investing in cloud computing is the way to go IBM should finally be able to unlock some of the enterprise potential Watson has.... I think anyone selling PUTS is happy to buy those shares back and probably would like to see it fall just a bit below the expire price so they can snag all the shares they can. If you dont want to alarm the open market to buying I think this is the alternative way to score shares that you feel will double down the road."
it doesn't matter who's in charge. This is not Big Blue anymore. it's a different company looking for a market. This is not a good investment.
"Same thing happened to ORCL last quarter. They had great results, but gave guarded guidance going forward. Everyone blamed Safra Catz for pooring cold water on a great quarter. Whatever the short term results, it looks like IBM's moving in the right direction. I'm pulling for them."
"IBM is a utility tech stock much like Duke energy, nextera, southern energy, Entergy etc. I'm ok with the stock paying me well as I wait. It could be worse. You could hold and receive nothing. Over 6 bucks a year. Multiply that by the 5 years I've been holding and I could say I got over 30 bucks shaved off my buy. Could it be better? Of course! But it could be worse"
Keep Buffet away from IBM. Buffet will wreck IBM and make us a stodgy out-dated company. We need to be hip and innovative. We are the new IBM.
"IBM launches cloud for 5G telecommunications with Nokia, Samsung among partners https://seekingalpha.com/news/3632311-ibm-launches-cloud-for-5g-telecommunications-nokia-samsung-among-partners"
"IBM wont go bankrupt yet. Their market share is being chipped way with lower cost providers like service now, Amazon, Microsoft and others..As IBM shrinks so will the dividends because it cant be sustained on missed revenue and opportunities lost. IBM Bids are over burdened with 5 layers of management costs from first line to third line managers all charging time to contracts but add NOTHING of value to the end product. Then there is the rework costs that cause missed milestones hidden in the contingency costs from foreign labor that produces a lower quality product than US personnel do but a cheaper on paper to bean counters."
"IBM down another 2 bucks today..121 and change. BOD DO YOUR JOB! Your fiduciary responsibility is to the Shareholders, not Ginny and her boy toys! Four layers of middle managers that add nothing to the productcycle other than confusion, red tape and layoffs. Time to flatten that structure by 50%. Layoff the managers , not the tech support! Its time for a NEW CEO before its too late like GE!"
dunderhead rometty leads ibm to mediocrity and the BOD have got their golden parachutes ready....it's incredible to watch...can anyone tell me how red hat enhances ibm's cloud stature?...A:no...because it doesn't
"Good news all over the place for IBM and down? This isnt fair, just this week many positive news...down"
Sales keep falling and debt growing..put your money elsewhere.
"meanwhile fast talking dunderhead rometty is on cnbc talking about how redhat increases ibm's cloud stature.....and the BOD has their golden parachutes ready.....it's incredible to watch...ibm is the next GE....just sit back, grab your popcorn, and watch this titanic sink"
Big Blue has turned the corner as usual retail Investors ahead of the game. Need some upgrades!
Timber.....glad I was lucky to sell my 200 small amount at 140 yesterday In premarket
"Any other employee with a record of such gross incompetance would have been fired years ago. The Board of Directors should all be removed for the damage they inflicted on the shareholders, employees and customers by retaining this woman. She was absolutely unprepared to run a large company. A perfect example of PC at its worst."
"Is IBM the next Radio shack, we all know what happened there"
Market down 300 ibm up 6
Problem with IBM is for cloud they need entire hardware dedicated for cloud but msft and Amzn they can package it with other services they offers.I really want IBM to do well but they are late for the party.
"what is creating the IBM run from 120 to 135 in a small time frame,,"
"If Pentagon does award the $10 billion contract to AMAZON, that could be a most damaging move for the security of this country. Along with the $600 million CIA contract that AMAZON already has, they will have America's most sensitive data under one roof! Like they say, it is never good to put all the eggs in one basket. AMAZON will have more power than the US government and with all the secret CIA and military data, they could blackmail anyone at will! This could happen because the US government is full of low life politicians. .................... JMHOTex"
A guest on CNBC today said that IBM leads their industry in diversity. Food for thought.
"Anybody see Ginny creating shareholder value?By any measure she has underperformed!Why not bring in new blood?What are they scared of, new ideas that would shake up old blue!It’s time, numerous other tech firms have made changes at the top with Very positive results."
CHANGE WILL TAKE PLACE ONLY WHEN SHE LEAVES FOR OLD AGE NURSING HOME
I want to know if anyone has a theory about why Ms Rometty retains her position as the board chairman.
"AAPL, PLEASE BUY OUT IBM!!!"
Let’s rock
going no where
"@Ed honestly, you have your right to voice. But repeating, “the bubble, the debt, no revs/sales of product(s) to justify... and etc”Yes you’re right. But that could be from ....The FASTEST , ‘most sold & searched for’ via Amazon for GPU / CPU processors are $AMD.Also there’s the GAMING CONSOLE LAUNCH $MSFT’s XBOX & $PSE’ SONY PS - BOTH consoles’ chips ARE/ WILL be $AMD.Too many things to list ...Not to Justify a 260+ PE... but to justify EPS and announcements during EPS ED... what’s your current stock positions? All things you have posted / fact / fiction/ misdirection can be verified on the NET....You do realize $IBM used to supply the chips for XBOX 360 n PS3...???Are you certain that $IBM has ZERO relation with $AMD... ??Did you know that the idea that $IBM should’ve bought $AMD, at 1 point???"
"""Rometty may have left Big Blue, but she is being retained, as we've covered before, as a contractor to provide consultancy. The document confirmed:The fee for such services would be $20,000 per day for each day she provides 4 or more hours of services, and $10,000 for each day that she provides less than four hours. To help facilitate these services, the Board also agreed to provide continued use of IBM office space and an IBM assistant during this three year consulting arrangement."""
Apple had a blow out quarter with services up over 22%...IBM Posts 21 consecutive revenue losses.. IBM BOD... IT isnt working. Time for a change. Give Layoff Ginny and her lieutenants their 30 day notice like that have done to some many others!
Bye bye $125
what were the final layoff numbers? anyone know? IBM seems to lay folks off twice a year on a regular basis. will the last US employee turn off the lights? I'd be willing to bet..the middle mgmt but lock lips didn't get any layoff notices
Is the $6.52 annual dividend safe and reliable for the next year? TIA
"Well, looks like Rometty will go out with a bang...possibly a Chapter 11...the company that produced various operatingsystems is now supposedly dependent on a tiny company providing maintenance and guidance for an open sourceOS derived from Unix....Unix a success because antitrust prevented IBM from donating VM to universities. Well done, Madame CEO...the shorts are celebrating."
"I'm willing to give IBM a chance of 5-6 years to turn this beast around. If MSFT can do it once Balmer got kicked out the door, don't see why IBM can't...earning good dividend while I wait."
"Margin improvement not impressive? You do know that this needs to happen before growing revenues, right? Buy for the coming up move!"
It is sad to see a (once) great company struggle because of incompetent BOD and CEO ! Where are the so-called Hedge Funds and major Institutions ... why are they not clamoring for a change? I hope they read this Board and gauge the frustration of the investors and react and demand changes to the management!
This price is very attractive with that dividend and P/E ratio. The RH crowd can continue to pump pre-revenue companies and overpriced tech that doesnt pay a dividend all they want. IBM aint going anywhere and their recent pivots are certainly in the correct direction for the future
"We have some life finally. I have been getting grayer and grayer holding this stock in 2 accounts for many years. The nice div always helped. Lets see how this panes out down the road. I have always looked for Microsoft old to new type results under the new leadership, but that might be a bit ambitious for now."
"Unlike yesterday, it would be nice if IBM could break through its 200 day SMA and close above it today. C'mon IBM, Ginni's gone (let's hope the ghost of Christmas Past won't be haunting the future!!)"
"I looked once more at the q3 results and the call. No guidance on how they will change course, nothing. Except the EPS which they'll continue to manipulate through buy-backs. This company has completely lost it. Fired all the older experienced workforce."
"The truth hurts but, opening the economy or finding a new drug is not going fix the damage done by Vivid-19"
The stock price is where it was in 2009. Nice job Ginny. She's destroyed this company.
"IBM is a hasbeen story, sad but true, no creativity at all, just playing follow the leader, I was hoping that they would do something with the quantum tech, but Google and China are so far ahead that again its follow the leader"
Plot twist selling at open makes it tank 
I re-established a position near today's low after selling my last position IBM earlier this week at a handsome profit and collecting my dividend. It will be back to 117 by Monday morning.
the saddest thing with IBM is that it doesn't have any technology advantages any more. Basically a a best buy. buy and sell. tech retails.
"My analyst believes IBM has hit a low and sees a bump over the next couple weeks. It isn'ta Zoom, but it is a better dividend play than the oils, utilities, bonds or CD's. He says to buyin on dips."
"They just don't like IBM the lady ruined it and Red Hat will slowly turn it around.Need 12 months when they show what they got. Patience, Patience."
"IBM widens its AI lead""Whether they are aware of it or not, every company is on a journey to AI as the ultimate driver of business transformation,"" said Rob Thomas, General Manager, IBM Analytics. ""But for them to get there, they need to put in place an information architecture for collecting, managing and analyzing their data. With today's announcements, we are planning to bring the AI destination closer and give access to powerful machine learning and data science technologies that can turn data into game-changing insight.""Launching on the IBM Cloud Private platform, Cloud Private for Data is an application layer deployed on the Kubernetes open-source container software and can be deployed in minutes. Using microservices, it forms a truly integrated environment for data science and application development. In the future, the Cloud Private for Data will run on all clouds, as well as be available in industry-specific solutions, for financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and more.Commenting on the news, Christian Rodatus, CEO of IBM business partner Datameer, said that ""two of the biggest challenges for Data scientists is cleansing and shaping data, and operationalizing their insights to deliver value to business. The direction IBM is headed with IBM Cloud Private for Data is aligned with Datameer's strategy and can enable companies to more quickly prepare data for machine learning and AI projects and operationalize these across their organizations.""The Cloud Private Data solution also includes key capabilities from IBM's Data Science Experience, Information Analyzer, Information Governance Catalogue, Data Stage, Db2 and Db2 Warehouse. The cohesive set of capabilities is designed to help Cloud Private clients quickly discover insights from their core business data, while keeping that data in a protected, controlled environment. In other words, the new solution is designed to provide a data infrastructure layer for AI behind the firewall.Separately, IBM announced the formation of the Data Science Elite Team – a new no-charge consultancy dedicated to solving clients' real-world data science problems and to assisting them in their journey to AI."
"Hybrid cloud will be the future, which will be great for shareholders of $NTNX and $IBM!"
Idk what is going on. They normally tank every year during earnings. How could this be.....
$CRM uses Slack$VZ uses Slack$IBM uses slack
"tried so many times, final got one right...lol"
Looks like someone forgot to deliver the timber this morning.
Impressive image of their new Q and I love the technological push on computing. This is what the cliche “innovation” looks like. Sun filled days ahead for IBM
"So correct me if I am wrong. IBM is putting everything in one basket and it is the cloud business. Outside of that , all other sectors of IBM are on a serious decline. Given the fact that other big companies are way ahead of IBM in the cloud business that it’s not a sure thing for IBM anymore. How can IBM convince the investors that they can take the market share from amazon, msft, dell.. just to name a few.....?"
"wow, thats a big drop too get your dividend on IBM, 1.62 for a 3 point loss in a day to get a small div...DIV are not worth it"
Looks like the resistance is at $120 and staying close with the main indexes. Hope this will ride once market pick up!
ibm disappoints again - soon to be double digits....on a different note - fast talking dunderhead rometty is on tv again
The stock cant get out of its own way...should be 160+. CEO needs to go. VOTE YOUR SHARES TO GET THE BOD OUT!
"wsb should take action to squeeze out Jim Chanos (famous for his failed Tesla short), who called IBM his favorite short on Bloomberg in December."
"With a beta of 1.25, and over 100% of their earnings paid out in dividend...this is NOT a buy. Its a sell. Come back at 75-95. Get INTC instead. look at their numbers."
"ORCL is another example of the old has beens that can't keep up anymore. Same as with IBM, top line eroding, bottom line kept through financial gymnastics. Negative growth companies that have no future."
Doesn't Amazon have enough to do? Time for this program to be awarded to another company.....like IBM.\https://finance.yahoo.com/m/def84235-9f1b-3853-969d-68dff0965f64/ss_pentagon-issues-final-rfp-for.html
1% were shorting. 1% are now screwed. Even guidance was slightly higher than expected....we're soon heading back to 160 where we came from.....then beyond
"IBM and the low price of their shares become a natural buy as people leave the FANG stocks for lower p/e and dividends, so for a trade or long term IBM will move to $175 $200 before end of year, hedge funds will be loading up on margin as rates are low and %%% returns pay the cost of margin. easy easy math"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-maersk-creating-blockchain-company-121516983.html
"IBM is back to the long term rising trend on the chart. The longer the consolidation, the bigger the break out like MSFT for IBM. Look forward to that when it breaks out. Hope the re rating is coming"
"@BobMcLovin who is IBM? Market is up all over the place, Buffett is in Apple , amazon is at cloud , google is having fun with Ai and Elon Musk was the richest in the world thanks to TSLA . And yet who is IBM?"
"Ross Perot, thought back in 1960 IBM, slow moving,dull company. He was right. Break up this fossil,distribute the funds to share holders."
"IBM is gradually picking up more new business contract on migration to their private and public cloud enterprise. it seems Redhead is laying the foundations to sent IBM on stellar growth path. New contract with At&t and shipping companies,etc."
Short IBM to $90. I will sell short IBM at market open. Easy money!
IBM on new fresh lease of life with Redhat.
"Big Blue will be fine going forward. Give it some more time.......remember what they said about Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, etc...how are they doing now???? I am in it for the long run. This big beast will get going."
Needs march lows and even then it's to expensive for negative growth.
Hanging on hybrid cloud & AI...hope these delivered.
ceo should worry more about business than politics
"Perspective: The markets are higher today than they were mid-December pre-wuhan-virus (4 months ago!).. Back when businesses were open, and earnings were not collapsing. None of this makes anyone nervous?$NVDA $INTC $MSFT $IBM $MU $FB"
"IBM now has a market capitilization 1/10 the size of Apple!! IBM, one of the greatest technology companies of all time reduced to a market cap of just over $100B. How did this happen, who dropped the ball, and are they still sitting on the CEO throne?"
Ibm was up to over $127 today and by close tomorrow it will be $131 or higher
"AMD and AI , machine learning $ibm cloud partnership. If you read Lisa Su answer at the ER and see what IBM's cloud infrastructure general manager said last Sep on using epyc rome for AI and machine learning, coupled with recent AMD's hiring of key ibm's cognitive and Power processors people all as I've posted, you can confirm that ibm's said to announce its EPYC’s cloud this Q and will have such GPUs and CPUs design partnership disclosed. This will be key to ibm too now relying on $nvda that charge them huge prices that make less use cases feasible. That's why ibm has lost the DOE bid for exascale supercomputer to amd and cray's Frontier! Here is a quote from Lisa Su: ""We think that there are additional opportunities like that as well as machine learning and AI opportunities. Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers to optimize the machine learning frameworks. And we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond.""It's very clear to me that announcement of such will jump amd's and ibm's pps and sink nVidia's."
Why doesn’t Ginny offer long suffering shareholders $190 per share! IBM shares may be worth less then the acquisition price paid for RHT...Are the BOD paying any attention to its shareholders?
"Ok, if IBM is focusing on blockchain, why aren't they participating in this rally of BTC???? Just get the stock price up to $135 so I can bail out at breakeven!!!"
"ok, steep descend has begun, be ready for $100-110 by 12/31"
I doubt IBM is the only company that discriminates against older workers. The aerospace industry has been doing it for decades. Who is the targeted audience for early buyouts? What about those targeted who are grandfathered in under defined benefit pension plans?
So how much would Buffett have made in dividends if he had as much IBM stock as he has Apple?
good first step. I hope she got the same Package she gave the 50 thousnd people she laid off in her tenure. 6 weeks pay and no Healthcare. next step for the ceo...clean house and flatten the management structure getting rid of all the bloated middle mgmt ranks and replenish the tech talent
IBM Q4 is there biggest of the year - I expect a major miss - given that they are laying off like crazy right now. $5-$7 per share drop coming very soon. They just laid off thousands of sales people across all geographies. Watch out here.
Big Blue shall rise again. You ain't seen nothing yet.
"With failure of IBM strategic imperatives, IBM CEO will soon announce Impressive Imperatives Initiative (full of wonderful promises, target of 50$ EPS by 2050). Ceremonial IBM Board Of Directors will temporarily wake up from deep hibernation to rubber stamp the plan and grant IBM CEO lavish stock options."
Fingers Crossed. hoping the Pentagon chooses IBM for cloud. Amazon will be cheaper... but IBM provides value as well as blockchain. also in 2016 they needed to use Watson. hoping they recognize the value of working with IBM and I can double my half share.
"Those of you that hold IBM for the dividend need to realize you lost 1.4 years of dividend in the first 10 minutes of trading today. Pull up the IBM stock chart chose the max period so you can see the stock price over the long-term. The highest peak in price corresponds roughly with when the current CEO took over. Look at the results since then. They are consistently dismal. A popular definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing and expecting different results. Holding IBM stock with the current CEO has consistently resulted in losses far exceeding he dividends paid. It would be insane to expect different results holding IBM stock going forward with the same CEO. Don't be insane. If you can't find a better place to put your money, hire someone who can. Stop doubling down because you want to prove you were right before. Accept that you were wrong and move on. Your retirement is likely to be much better if you do."
Looks like Gartner news helping IBM
Nothing is heard from Jim Chanos...Is he still among us or has he covered his position...?
How does a shrinking company increase its share value? Is this an example of a rigged market?
buy buy opportunity today
buffet knew she had to go and get a real ceo
Amazon owns 50% of the cloud (est). Where's IBM's increased share coming from?
"I paid $134 back in August 2019, can't say IBM has been one of my better picks. Just sharing that."
Replace Ginny with Redhat CEO probably will breath fresh air to IBM. I see that is a possibility. She has passed the 60 year of age and may not keep in touch with the quck pace of advancement in tech. She should have known Watson and AI works on probabilistic output that is good for certain Use cases for retailers but not prescribe medicine.
Had to buy some today. I'll take the 1.62 dividends and wait for the run back over 125-130 range. Glta
"IBM will be the case study in MBA schools for corporate failure - for years to come, maybe centuries"
Now gonna wait for ibm to drop in price to buy some shares baby!!!!
Surging on a doom day
"In the next few weeks institutions will start to unload their positions, by Q4 results this will be well below 100."
"Sold my 500 IBM shares and bought Amazon, Google, Netflix, Blue Apron, and Twitter."
They need a new dot. This one is Ginni 2.0
"well i sold on the news. ibm is a good company, but the market right now is in a tough situation and we have elections coming up. So many things can drive it up or down. I am hoping to buy back on what i expect to be a drop in pps in the coming weeks. As someone pointed out the earnings beat were not a big deal, especially considering the layoffs and reduced gross revenue. May be on the right track, but premature price rise. I like there AI."
Forward PE 10 and spin off coming up. IBM finds support here and starts a gradual recovery. $160 in 1 year.
It’s a deception pattern a year in. Recovery recovery then drop the failures long discovered by the likes of Buffett and others but don’t feel to bad even Valueline was reluctant to drop it.
It's getting interesting...
IBM is riding the wave of google and Microsoft. But it will be along side google and Microsoft sooner than we think.. and we will be there to.
IBM is a $300 stock in 2022
IBM is getting very close to buy territory. I’m a buyer at $100. This company is gonna soar over the next three years. Redhat is gonna clean house and whip this company into a great tech force again
Dividend confirmed for the 11th.
Stock up 8+ pts since Rometty resigns. I think 150+ is in the offing and the shorts will pay!
"$IBM shares lost 10%+ at the opening after it's become clear no growth vs last year's results to happen. Yesterday's ER guidance for Q1 showing a decline in revenues vs a year ago. Even as ibm has increased the dividend it doesn't help. Looks like big money getting out and no support. This should tell us Intel's story increasing dividends too but having again lower revenues vs past year, to get lower even more. Wait for AMD's ER next week to see the huge gains and yearly outlook in contrast."
VOTE and get the entire BOD out along with the wannabe Nadella!!!!
"Paid a lot for the Red Hat. Will likely take a year or two to find out if we overpaid or not, but the insider buying today appears to be a good sign. Sure would like to see big blue beat the market over the next 10 years because I am not selling."

Amazing value right here in these uncertain times. 100+ year old company that is transitioning into cloud and AI...along with a dividend. This will be one of the best success stories this year...stay long and strong

So many call options April 20 calls on IBM over put . Shares should go up after earning
Earnings report is on Monday 7-20-20. Still time to get out. Big miss is likely.
Big blue is awake. See you at 175
"What a disaster! I'm glad that I took my profits today and bought some puts. I still have a few calls that will lose money tomorrow, but my puts should pay off handsomely, compensating for most, if not all of my losses on the call side. Long-run, I'm still incredibly bullish on IBM—but more and more, it's looking like the long-run is maybe a two- or three-year horizon."
"IBM cranks up alliance and strategic partnership. This is strategic management 101, many more companies to follow with IBM help to scale globally and across sector. IBM does not have to do much, just leverage its brand and support, collection the money and reward share holders. This is even a better strategy than build everything on your own. There are so many startup loves to form alliance with IBM."
Limited target adj downward
"wow,,,am i the only one who has been beat this bad holding this POS company stock now, 133 its at,,"
Have you checked the yield on a 3 year bank CD lately? It’s below 2%. (and unlikely to ever go significantly higher). Think of IBM as a bond on steroids and try not to obsess over its daily stock price
6.00 dividend.
im a buyer at 145
People always wait until the last minute to capture the dividend.You need to own shares at market close so we’ll get usual div bump prior to ex-date.Then we’ll be down on Tuesday
This stock has gained 15% since last Thursday close. Impressive!

One of the names posted below was “International Business Infrastructure” which is so much better than Kyndryl. I am speechless and the CEO should be fired for this just because it is soooo boneheaded!"
Buy puts I don’t see catalyst for any organic growth and RH costs a lot to maintain for 4b yearly revs
Finally!!
You can blame Janet yellen for the next recession. IBM is going to $120's
I hope start its move towards $160. I'm holding some calls
Just noted that IBM pays $1.63 per share. The mid-way point on the 52 week range is $124.65. Would $125.00 be a wise entry point?
Sold off because they stopped buybacks to pay for RedHat.
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/13/tech/ibm-hybrid-cloud-investment/index.html
Really nice entry point IMO
This stock is going to rocket tomorrow! Back to the kind of prices we are used to seeing.
"Walgreens announced today they are going to the Microsoft cloud, very bad news for IBM, which we should have won. Ginny should have been in Deerfield, Il working on getting this account instead of on CNBC. This kind of loss reflects very poorly on IBM management...."
Forward PE of 9.8. Buy and hold. Will be trading at over $145 in a year.
Quarter reports come with Quarter layoffs.
"If you do not respect Rometti's judgement in running IBM, then there is no reason to respect her judgement on making insider purchases."
"So disappointed at the stock price and direction. This was supposed to be the ""safe"" part of my portfolio."

BELOW $100B market cap! this CEO is going to get it below $80B
They need to improve on their consultancy business than dreaming on cloud business in near future.
buy buy buy buy JMP raise to $148 from $135
Think about the past supercomputer leader $ibm using Power processors. Highly hyped and premium priced for enterprises. Ibm lost the El Capitan 2 exaflops crown jewel to little AMD Zen4 5nm processors! Including past GPUs king $nvda ibm's partner couldn't match AMD! This is not just HPC. It's all datacenters processing cloud and enterprises. Ibm can no longer justify expensive dinosaur tech at high prices. So just this crack in ibm's innovations and business is significant. We've seen ibm's power processors tech leaders moving to AMD suggesting ibm to discontinue Power processors! But more importantly is amd key winner over $intc and $nvda . Top that with Intel's security recently flaws and nVidia's Amper only using 10nm no samsung 7nm. Result is obvious.
Time for a leadership change.... massively across the top of the company and the board should be put on notice that they are not doing their job agreeing to what Ginni wants so they can get a pay check.... more than most employees for doing NOTHING.
Still a good buy for low to moderate growth and fat dividend..
High yield dividend stock at rock bottom price. Buy Buy Buy
$127 told u
"Beat and Raise!! Red Hat revenue, up 24 percent"
When will Watson be appointed CEO?
"FYI, Redhar revenue grew 21% in 2018, 15% in 2019. So even with IBM, grew only 16% in 2020 is unacceptable, given all if IBM financial engineering magics. They will stop reporting redhat rev really soon."
The Cloud Leader spoke....the World is Listening
When will IBM sky-rocket like other tech stocks?
"This split is going to cost IBM billions of $, imagine what it will be like splitting their finance system which probably has still large chunks of software written in the 60's and 70's and are running on old mainframes. Neither the newco nor the oldco will survive this split."
"Oil has ""recovered"" from minus $40 ... it's now 1 cent a barrel lol May contracts expire at 2.30pm today so after that we'll see June contracts but will be low not negative though.Other commodities down too. Silver at $14 now. It shows you how AMD is golden these days! When major disruption forces rethinking and absolute efficiency, as $goog is reviewing its datacenters design from $intc and $nvda to absolutely efficient price performance leader AMD, so everything else will be reviewed and changed at a very fast pace.$ibm will suffer loses of contracts as their customers will be FORCED to go try lower cost solutions IBM's competition offer instead of blindly continue with IBM!Same goes for investing in treasuries and gov bonds. It doesn't pay now almost 0 so it's LOOSING value due to PRINTING MORE $$ to fund the trillions needed. Oil silver gold and such including bitcoins have no meaning when the economy is down and people sell such holdings to survive.Bloated expensive era of nVidia and Intel dominance in times of plenty is crushed! Efficient high performance fair priced AMD will substentially accelerate market share taking from its competitors even if the total addressable market doesn't grow!Remember Intel's CEO was counting on bigger total market to counter losing market share to AMD. Not happening now!Lisa Su explained that AMD""s growth is by taking market share as it's way smaller than competition. This is perfectly true now.AMD is in a very unique position given the situation AND THIS YEAR having products coming leading performance and costing way less than competition. Unique time to take over that WILL NOT be lost after the corona impact is over!Think about this carefully."
Good morning BAGholders
"looks like everyone that bashed IBM is correct,, good thing i am a long term holder and will just collect my dividend, because the sellers and shorts are too powerful compared to the buyers which seem to be every few now a days"
"Their reported growth in cloud is even less than just adding RHT on top of what they had. Looks like the IBM cloud in itself lost even further market share. Which would be logical given their technology services division, which is a major contributor to these cloud projects is tanking."
Short Squeeze can't come soon enough. Well done longs! Up we go!
IBM has just begun the completion of the 2nd major transformation in 20 years.....
Boldest move by IBM even more than Red Hat. Buy.
"IBM is not MSFT...…. slow to adapt to new to changes in the market - technologies. The culture of slow moving dinosaurs executives, why wait until Q1 2020, when you can adopt new technologies in Q4...…….. I think I waste my time , excuses, excuses, excuses I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger to buy...…."
So basically the companies future growth was supposed to be Watson and now that division is cutting jobs. This company is a mess and in a slow spiral down if things don't change.
"IBM 2.0. Outstanding dividend. will march to 150, 175, 200 and beyond. long"
Google is the GOLD STANDARD SETTING FOR BIG DATACENTERS OPERATORS. But IBM is the gold standard setting for ENTERPRISES with its Hybrid Cloud and having services of IT provided to top companies. $ibm stated last September in Rome they are launching an WMD based EPYC Rome Hybrid Cloud in 1Q2020. This should be soon revealed giving AMD entry to enterprises where $intc and $nvda are now. Expect a bigger jump once this is announced.
IBM is a great buy today because the price is very low and on top of that you will get the dividend check in December!!
IBM can increase sales with Redhat Linux
"In a filing, IBM (NYSE:IBM) announces plans to redeem $2.9B of notes due 2021.• The breakdown includes $500M of 2.9% notes, $1.5B of 2.8%, and $900M of 2.25%.• The redemption date for the notes will be March 6."
"Is there a bull story here in its infancy? I am not a big fan of hope or even turnarounds really, i tend to think the winners keep winning. But here is what i am thinking, despite all the layoffs:-- IBM is investing heavily into blockchain, cloud, AI, perhaps more than many other companies.-- New CEO Arvind Krishna was the driving force behind Red Hat deal which was expensive yes but probably also a smart acquisition as time will show. He has also been a driving force behind the other aforementioned growth areas. He has an engineer (problem solver) background, not just a ""manager""-- IBM makes its own hardware and software, always a good thing that even Steve Jobs believed you have to do if you are really serious about software-- Although the layoffs will likely continue, IBM could end up a leaner and younger workforce going forward. What do you guys think? Am i high on hopium, is it the same old IBM past its prime or is there something here?"
"Yahoo, please don't delete my postings."
"The short squeeze fiasco in GameStop stock highlighted the fact that the company’s financial conditions have no bearing on the stock price because the Hedge funds and Market makers with the help of Media have a major influence on a company’s stock price trends. IBM is one of the unfortunate companies is in their cross-hair and seems like they are determined to keep this company’s stock in the basement until the company meets the fate of companies like Sears, Eastman Kodak, Xerox et. al. Just my humble opinion…………Tex"
"IBM is going from stagnation and decline to possible bankruptcy with the Red Hat acquisition...letting a demonstrablyincompetent CEO bet the company on a Hail Mary acquisition is a shocking breach of fiduciary responsibility by the BOD. The consequences for the hundreds of thousand of employees, pensioners and investors will be dire.Of course the BOD and top management will not be hurt...as can be seen from their lack of investment in IBM shares,they have little skin in the game, aside from their compensation and bonuses."
"This dog keeps bummin me out. Fleeced by McKinsey on this new company name?? Who did they pay for that?? Shoulda crowd sourced a new name online and offered a million dollar prize. Will I ever be back to even on this pig? Yeah, by the time the fed prints about another 10 trillion."
IBm needs a life alert necklace..its fallen and cant get up...VOTE OUT the BOD!
"Gets increasingly hard to understand why the BOD does not do its job and brings in new, competent management."
Why would anyone consider growing 22% in cloud revenue for IBM in TTM is bad? It is just starting....

This article compares Ginni's IBM performance with CEO of MSFT:https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/microsoft-soars-to-new-heights-as-ibm-goes-sideways-a-tale-of-two-ceos-14939666?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
"Remember when IBM investors were boasting about how much IBM had outperformed the market this year? Well, here are the current returns YTD, including the precious dividends that IBM investors crave:IBM: 22.5%S&P 500: 26%How many years has it been since IBM performed a simple index fund?"
It's a good time to sell some IBM put options today and make some easy money.
"It's Alive!The technical condition of IBM is improving. Some of the indicators have turned positive suggesting that a bottom in the stock price has likely occurred. The stock is underperforming the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. The MACD-LT, is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bullish at this time. IBM's chart formation suggests an upward trend is beginning/ stock is in the early stages of a rising trend. A close above $146.050003051758 is a number to watch to confirm a trend reversal. Momentum as measured by the 9-day RSI is gaining in strength. The stock is in a short-term overbought condition based on a Slow % K stochastic reading of 80 or higher. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that IBM is still under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average. A close above this moving average would be supportive of the improving conditions."
Ginny annoucing retirment soon. IBM will pop 20 percent.
"Collect dividend, waiting for another quarter. Every dog has its days, 2021 will be iBM year just like GM triple its shares."
My god - fire HER already!!!!
So why is the after market plummeting after better than expected earnings?
IBM stocks surges as the board oysters Ginny from CEO position.her tenure was 40 years too long.
IBM was more of a manufacturing business than a services business. their main competition was amdahl and tandem Corp. that are now defunct due to technology. IBM has been having a growth problems since the 90s. it has tried inorganic growth by buying other companies to no avail. IBM has to increase its services business. They need to come up with something that people and businesses needs.
"How many managers did IBM let go in the lates round of layoffs? None Id expect. While talented people are let go and getting scooped up by IBM competitors. 4 layers of do nothing management costs could be removed from contract if the C suite had the will to do it, which they dont. All want to keep their lil fiefdoms at the expense of the company."
"Guidance is key here along with their Red Hat plans ... if there's any kind of positive news regarding how they'll move forward with Red Hat, IBM may finally break out of their trading range!"
New IBM going higher. Buy.
"About time, Forbes is calling for a new CEO. Time to remove the old guard from the board and wind down the financial engineering and smoke screens.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6a4a8f95-4423-3783-9933-771fdfbfb9fc/don%27t-buy-ibm-it-lacks.html"
"Short squeeze from the lows in December has occured. New shorts went into earning and are covering in AH. IBM numbers were mediocure at best. Financial engineering and still missed revenue. Huge costs associated with premium for Red Hat, the Indian consulting firms are taking market share and Oracle and Amazon are the major players in cloud. Looking at the charts, you can expect the top with this covering in AH."
BOD...Do your job...fire this ceo. 8 qtrs of revenue misses is enough!!!'' what does it take to get this BOD to do anythimg? no action vote them out!!!
"Five years from now, they'll be mulling the sale of RED HAT."
I believe in this company. Holding strong.
"Told you on Friday, the gain was only from IBM buying back their own shares. They were probably fearing the abyss below 140, but it's only a delay. This company has no vision, and completely ran out of ideas. Q3 will be bad, the mainframe upgrade cycle clocked a full year, there will be no more growth, and their services backlog was already down by the end of Q2. Not surprising, who would enter a long term services agreement with a company that can't delivery locally, they will remotely support you from India so they say."
"QQQ PE may look reasonable due to few selected very high profitable very low PE stock like $INTC, $CSCO, $IBM, $MU. Rest trading 25+ PE and majority trade even 50+ PE.Funny part is just 20 year ago this name consider same way as current high flyer but never reach peak even when they are leader in their area even today. Back then their valuation only half of what many cloud player getting today."
"Are we going to get another typical ""Ginni"" like ""earnings"" or something giving stock holders guidance of a hopeful future for IBM ... IMO, the spinoff means holders will get two lousy companies with no future at all ... maybe the BOD will compensate with a HUGE dividend increase or a special dividend from the split instead of another #$%$ IBM spinoff!!!"
Surprised it took people this long to sell off after the dividend ex date. It should have been this price on Monday.
IBM BEAT ON REVENUE AND EPS!! YES! YES! YES!
short squeeze...
"here we go again IBM reaches 123.80 the other day and now is struggling at 121.40, unreal"
"this is the year IBM will see 150, maybe by june 2020"
Four upgrades on the pps target today. The last from Credit Suisse from 150 to 155. Ceo imho is doing a good job.
"wait do not be hasty and sell, Analyst upgrade to follow"
ibm just bought the brooklyn bridge
"Yahoo is terrible, anyway to get changed back?"
"Finally, https://www.ibm.com/investor/att/pdf/IBM-1Q18-Earnings-Press-Release.pdfAlmost 1 Billion more in Rev but flat in profitsIncome downGross margins lowerEarnings downMore shares being bought back to help support numbers (declining numbers)Fewer assets as wellAll in all, bad numbers in what is supposed to be a growing economy"
Get rid of this kosher affirmative action CEO hiree and you'll see shares soar. Keep her and IBM will be $70 in 3 years.
Hopefully getting rid of the last CEO will have the same affect on the stock that getting rid of Balmer did for MSFT... There hope!
I saw my first pair of bewbs on an IBM think pad. This company will always have a special place in my heart
Q2 2021/Q3 2021 could be a nice entry into IBM (that is what I am thinking of doing): In Q4 2021 they Power10 units will be delivered to clients.
They should change the name to Red Hat Systems. Then people will get over the fact that this company is not your parents big blue.
Anyone invested in this company is very smart lol
Big Blue doing it again!
Maybe I'm Old Fashioned but doesn't anyone care about actual earnings anymore or is it just about revenue and seeing how many dollar bills you can sell for 95 cents. Most of the new tech companies haven't yet earned what people are projecting out for at least 10 years. That's a long time.
"all these ups and downs in the market is computerized trading. The bottom line for individual stocks is Revenue, Earnings, and cash flow. Although this company is going through many changes, if they can pull the numbers they will be ok. Otherwise expect further losses."
IBM slated to earn 12.41 in 2021. put a 13.3 handle on it 165 per share. i will give the new Ceo a couple of years. he inherited a virus riots etc. I think by focusing on the cloud IBM will imho turn to growing again. Perhaps one of two bad quarters but going forward is what counts. Good buy at the current level imho. As for the awesome fellow he is either a paid basher or a nut. best of luck i am holding all of my IBM shares. The dividend is very good and will be raised again next year.
"IBM started today higher, went lower and finished a little in the green... trading where it found support 3 years ago on a weekly chart RSI 17, 4308 Jun 19 125 Calls bought today, shorts have been feeding the RSI we are ready for a snap back to reality!"

"It's finally over, glad!"
this thing will go under $100 in nov
"Apple dividend isn't near IBM dividend. 2,000,000 shares of stock still owned by BuffettIBM : $1.50 per share per quarter = $3,000,000. Apple: $0.63 per share per quarter = $1,260,000. What does he see?"
Consider 110....no support until then.
Buffet owns zero shares now from 80 mln he had in the beginning of 2017.I think he might nibble some soon. 4.5% and a stable enterprise Gl!
"IBM is a contrarian play. Thanks, stock market, for providing entry points in recent months."
this is a tech revolution and it all starts wit ibmm like always
"IBM executives appear to only know how to manage the business downward, however, even if IBM revenue drops to U.S. $70 billion annualized in the near future, that is still a large revenue source. Businesses in general will most likely be lowering their CapEx on computer hardware, software, and services for most of 2020. It appears to be a bumpy ride for IBM in 2020. I will not be surprised if IBM cuts the dividend amount in 2020, I do not think they will get rid of it, just reduce the amount paid."
"The wealth destruction continues... Upper management keeps holding the proverbial carrot in front of the donkey (investors). The carrot has worked for 7 years and counting, as the donkey has obediently kept following the stock into the ground. What a horrible investment for longs."
"Rometty has been an abject failure! One can validate this assertion by simply reviewing IBM's annual reports for the period she has led the company. She has been instrumental in driving revenues downward during her entire tenure as CEO. She is a cancer on the company and desperately needs to be tossed out of there as she continues to make a myriad of strategic and tactical mistakes. More importantly, her inner-circle is equally unqualified to propel the IBM Corporation into anything resembling a 21st-century technology company. It is unconscionable that the IBM Board has not sought a new leader who will surgically dismantle the company in an effort to rid the company of the technology stacks and services where IBM has failed to perform competitively. The problems at IBM are glaring, they simply need a new technically astute and vibrant leader!"
"Fact is IBM should not even pull back because it totally did not participate in the bull run at all. Anyway lets hope for a better 2021. I expected Cloud to keep growing. But hopefully we could find more ways to monetized AI (see what is happening at nvda?) as well. So that sr can have two growing wings. 2021 will be the year if AI . I hope IBM having spent so much on it , can find ways to monetized it too."
The numbers IBM posted are an absolute farce. There is no possible way they could have provided profitable numbers without some serious accounting shenanigans.
IBM and REDHAT as a SAAS cloud company is worth North of $300!
"IBM bought Redhat last year , then now announced the break-up. Since IBM is keeping the cloud business , the rest of the “old IBM” is really a dying company (reason to break it up). Am I correct to suggest that we can only go down from here, due to the huge debt we took from buying Red Hat? Anyone please educate me. Thanks"
When will IBM be removed from the Dow?
Buffett paid 159 a share for IBM and thought it was way undervalued! what a bargain basement pps i am getting now. Thank you MR Market.
Loaded up 117.4-118.5. All of my buys today are now in the green. My overall average is 116.91.
"When IBM stock was around its low last fall, I was able to buy it at $114. The share price and dividend were too good to pass up. Now it's around $138 and I'm also getting around 5.7% dividend rate on the money invested. That's a lot better return than what any bank account would have given me. I'm in IBM for the very long term because it's still a good value stock."
moved to Valueline #19 but it sure is taking off today.
I've been closely following IBM since 2012. IBM has been moving more into the cloud. IBM is turning around. They're getting more into profitable ventures. This is a good time to accumulate. Should be much higher in a year or two.
Up 2.58 pre mkt
I’m totally disgusted with IBM
Shorts are screaming ..... ticking 131 goodbye puts
The heads cutting finally managed to bring the cost down .. this is not a sustainable model.
"To get a $500 price target, IBM, just needs to build a plug for an EV, call it a Quantum Charging Station!"
ibm showing strength
"To all those concerned about Chapter 11 (or Chapter 7) - this company has over $12B of free cash flow even as they shift to a subscription based software sales model that pushes most of the revenue into future periods. The balance sheet is rock solid with most of the debt in the financing arm and secured by equipment. So, on the ""bankruptcy"" front - relax."
"Rometty looks like she will ride this outfit into bankruptcy....just about anyuthing (real estate, art, product lines) that could be sold is gone. There was even talk of sellling the mainframe business. Disgraceful....Perhaps an activit will show up and finally put some pressure on the BOD. Otherwise the outcome may be worse than GE."
"Dear Aravind, Jim,Congratulations to both of you. Here is a quick 2020 priority list for you. 1. R&D - Review the IBM patents portfolio and hire a team to capitalize them one by one. Not one patent should be wasted and sitting in some digital documents. This is easy money, annuity. 2. Hybrid Cloud - Integrate every product of IBM with AWS and Azure. Remember that customers will switch to IBM if they see a clear path and flexibility. Set an objective of growing at 25% per year. There is truly no competition and no workforce in the world can integrate as well as IBM’s. Develop a strong link between Mainframe and RedHat portfolio so that the vertical power of mainframe can be leveraged with the horizontal power of RedHat. You will be making the most powerful Cloud in the world. 3. AI and Quantum Computing - Please invest with startups in mind. Develop a culture of partnering with the VCs and private equity rather than potential customers. Your sales force is not smart and driven as well as the entrepreneurs of the world.4. The world is flat - Develop SVPs in Asia Middle East and Latin America directly reporting to you. You must pay highest salaries and acquire the highest technological or managerial talents. Please fire executives who are not performing immediately. 5. Government business - Can’t you see that the US government is printing trillions along with all other countries. How come you are not the number one technology provider across every government in the world. There is no way Amazon or Microsoft can even place their foot in the door if you put your focus in every mission critical program. 6. Elon Musk - Please beg him or people like him to join the Board. They can teach you about the future more than the current old school board members. Just one joint venture with him will give you a moonshot program you never imagined. 7. Healthcare - Easy money and the highest margins. Please partner with them on every mission critical R&D programs. Commercialize the mainframe technology and the cloud foot print to enable faster and productive research.You will make Billions in working with them. Hope this helps! I will be buying an IBM stock going forward."
"New Technologies is what's killing this company. Too much competition causing lower revenues and earnings. IBM will still be around for a long time but, I believe market capitalization will erode as time goes. imho"
"I worked for IBM doing consulting work about 20 years ago, primarily mainframe work which would be legacy work today. At that time much of the work involved interfacing the emerging PC's to tap into the data held on the mainframes, as well as allowing the mainframes to access data which was more and more being picked up by PC's.I was impressed with the reliability of the mainframes and the excellent documentation.Somebody at some time inthe past had laid out a methodology for testing and implementing which was excellent. However, that was at a time where with foresight you could map out where you were and where you wanted to get to.Today things move so fast that mapping out process doesn't work out so well, and in the computer field they use what is called AGILE planning, where you have a much looser goal and continually monitor and adapt your strategies. At the time there products were first rate. At this point i am not an insider, but remain extremely impressed by their AI and Watson.there are 2 basic kinds of AI, one uses simulated neural networks that learn in the same way the brain does, and one uses a more programmed way of understanding. Of course they can be combined to some degree.the thing is I have seen Watson perform on Jeopardy. AS ken Jennings said 'i for one welcome our new overllords'.I have not been as impressed by either Microsofts AI software or Googles. They may be out there doing fantastic things, but i personally haven't seen it. Amazons software as used with their Alexa box kind of sucks by comparison to Watson.I've worked with Microsoft products and from a programmers point of view, they are kind of chaotic and by compelling updates all the time make it very difficult for American programmers to make a decent go of it as professionals.it is a field where you are constantly scrambling to keep up. it is more practical for 3rd world countries where there is a reasonably educated and able population to fill the programming needs. Americans if smart would go into some other line of work. While i used to resent the way IBM prevented innovation on mainframes so as to maintain a monopoly, there was some value in continuity.On balance i think ibm has an advantage in the AI field, and would like to learn more about the distinguishing features of the different AI competitors.Combining those tools with genes, green revolution is where the future lies."
Thank you for the shares at $119. Up we go!

1Q2018 will be reported near April 18th. That should be a great improvement over the 4Q17 report.
Anyone notice the strong buying into the close? Love this high tight flag --- breakout imminent!
"So, Ginny sitting on Trump's ""Business Advisory Council"" and brown-nosing the President didn't work out too well."
Netflix down 12% plus on earnings miss. That's what happens when you miss. Monday can easily bring this below 115.00 or more.
Look at the difference between Microsoft and IBM from 1 year ago to today
"IBM outpacing the market again...in reverse. Ginny ""pop"" over."
When will Ginny step down? She’s been a disaster since she took over IBM.
Why the bod hasn’t fired Ginny is unbelievable!What is her measure of performance?
Nice work IBM. The hybrid cloud strategy is starting to bear fruit.
"IBM and their current business model is doomed. They make promises they can't keep and ultimately most of their customer wind up very unhappy. They strip intelligent American workers of their jobs and ship them to people who can't handle anything above menial task related duties. Typically, 6 months into the contract the customer figures out they have been ripped off, customer service plummets, quality plummets, lawsuits start, and then IBM moves on like a swarm of locusts to RIP off another customer. Turnover of stateside workers is tremendous and those that stay are marginalized and lost. I ask, who in their right mind would be stock in a company like this?"
Wealth Destruction 101:Lesson 1 - Buy IBM stock.Lesson 2 - Hold long term.Lesson 3 - Buy more as price drops.
This company is a long term play and the current market is playing the market on a short term basis. Companies have been complaining for a while about providing forecasts. They met expectations this quarter and yet there are those that just want to be negative. Their PE is very reasonable and they are focused on growth in the cloud. Good luck to all.
Omg! Moon shot reaction. That’s unreal up 6.00 after hours on the news
"I've read that at Amazon, a quest for diversity is viewed as a quest for mediocrity. Indeed promotionsshould be based on capabilities and results, not gender and skin color...or you will get the likes of Rometty to destroy your company."
short IBM now. Down trend just start.Cannot break 144
I need a reason to put this divi in my portfolio. come on IBM do something.
Pull up the 5-year chart..........that's all I'm saying.
You cannot get in the bank in interest in what IBM pays. If they can keep this up in the next two years?
will be green tmrw
Red again how surprising!!!
"IBM has not had a good history of OS's outside of the almost monopoly in Mainframes. IBM DOS, OS2 and their own version of Linux that didnt sell, were MASSIVE failures costing the company Billions over 10 years until the finally withdrew them from the market. Im not sure what value Rometty thinks Red hat has but the premium they are paying is staggering!"
"LET""S CLOSE THESE TOP Tech STOCKS GREEN WED....IBM and AABB....BUY The DIPS Now and AFTER HOURS."
"IBM is a good solid company its been around for decades, and the hiring of Arvind will turn things around. They may have a couple of bad quarters, like most companies due to covid, but always going long, I recall the years back in 2000, they were far more advanced than any other IT organization I have ever seen. Time will tell, price target is $134, but I believe this can go higher $140"
Even the options are betting this will rise.
Finally a honest analyst ( Moffatson)out there with a SELL rating for IBM..
"Remember you hipsters, companies need to make money, not headlines. They need to have good margins not good VC debt. THey need to eventually not cost 1,750 PE. When the bubble bursts, IBM will be there to pick up the gutted and ruined technologists and give them safe jobs they will be thankful to have. Seen it so many times."
Moving in the right direction!
IBM CEO and management should be ashamed for being in the payroll. They need to pay the company for wasting valuable time of investors
CEO is a brilliant man ! Let’s be honest things are Better then we expected ! This virus has killed many businesses ! Ibm kept dividend in tact ! I hope this goes up sharply
"To all Liberal cry babies here is a Real good reason why the constitution calls for an electoral college.There are 3,141 counties in the United States. Trump won 3,084, and Clinton won 57. There are 62 counties in New York State. Trump won 46 and Clinton won 16. Clinton won the popular vote by approx. 2.5 million votes. In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2.5 million more votes than Trump. Therefore these 5 counties alone accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country.These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles.The United States is comprised of 3, 797,000 square miles. When you have a country that encompasses almost 4 million square miles of territory, it would be ludicrous to even suggest that the vote of those who inhabit a mere 319 square miles should dictate the outcome of a national election. God Bless America."
how is IBM paying for redhat? currently has 46.92B in debt :)
"International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ), bullish, rising"
Rommety IBM should hire unqualified low educated people. People that usually are offered free college but can’t still get it done. IBM a social charity no longer a for profit hiring the best and brightest talent. That’s how she became CEO a gender PC choice.
"what a travesty? A company making close to $11.00 per share and a dividend of almost $6 per share, is struggling with stock price! To top it off, it has almost 80 B in Sales.... Well, we think the Street and the Analysts want only growth, whether a company makes money or not! Some day soon Value stocks like IBM will come back! Meanwhile, the Management needs to do a better job of communications and if things don't change soon, get a new CEO to bring an outsider to the slot! That change might revitalize the company!"
upgrade?
Adding more on this dip ! Earnings will beat estimates with a revenue increase ! Way too low at this point and ex dividend coming in 2 weeks !!
Up 35 % in a Week.... SEGI.... Sycamore Entertainment.... Up 5 % Today...IQST...Iqstel.Up 16 % Today...TTCM....Tautachrome..... Up 45 % in a Month....XDSL...mPhase Tech.
with the bod we have now it would be our luck they would get rid of Rometty and hire Jeff imelt.
"Only hope for IBM is that an activist arrives to shake up the BOD, who are simply ignoring theirfiduciary duties."
IBM seems to be going down in sympathy of Cisco situation. IBM has already had its price adjustment. Getting close to another buy.
don't know why I kid myself thinking this will ever go up. it misses every earnings
WOW!! $3.11 EPS and 4% revenue growth!!
Buying more today. $107 is a gift. Collect divvy for two years and sell for $200
"The choice is clear, bankruptcy or get rid of Ginny"
"If it weren't politically incorrect, I would love to see an academic study analyzing the performance of tech companies with a female CEO. I think women do well in other industries (PEP, RGA, etc.) but it seems like there are a lot of examples where their performance at tech companies is not impressive."
"You should sell off IBM before earning. You all know it will be bad earnings, right? So why going down with the ship, except you are the captain."
we all get the 1.63 div if you held tonight
IBM block chain leadership with ecosystem builds around it will be accelerated. It is on the top of the heap. Let crank out more patents while others are sleeping.
The dividend can't even hold this #$%$ Probably because there is no confidence that the dividend will stay intact after the split. Thank you new management for accelerating IBM's demise. You truly are worth every dollar you're paid!

Will this dog ever hunt?????All these announcements and the stock goes nowhere except down. Something is really wrong.
Argus has just recommenced IBM and their research has been right on. Just got in Friday at sale price.
