"NIO bagholders, let me let you in a little secret, you don't make money investing in NIO or even Crypto, that's a gamble, you have to be lucky in timing and most of you aren't and are not privy to inside info, The way you make money is to by the S&P500 and hold it for decades, that the sure way to make money, not because you are smart, it is because it has to go up, Wall Street Sharks need constant flow of investors to keep making money and stealing their doe, hence bias of S&P500 over time to go up, that's how I made my money and that how am early retiring and have time to trade this NIO sucker up/down without worries about my financial future"

"NIO used to move 2-3 dollars a day now it is consolidating at around $34 (the previous strongest support) and it barely moves 1 dollar intraday, just trading side way. I think there might be uncertainty in the market right now. Why do people trading this side way ? both the long and the short are afraid?"

NIO’s entry into the European market, which represents 42% of global EV sales, with their first store to open in Oslo in Q3 2021 is expected to further bolster their sales and earnings performance. Forecasts predict deliveries of more than 84,000 vehicles in both China & Norway by the EOY, generating total revenues of more than RMB 34 billion which represents growth of more than double of 2020’sNo need to scoreboard watch, just have patience"

"Interesting how few postings there are and very few people reading this Board.I think that most investors are comfortable with the way things are evolving and are just sitting back and riding out this market that is do for a strong comeback in the next few months.The world will right itself because it knows it has to and people are finding themselves motivated to move forward.And yes, the rich world will help the poor one simply because we know it is in our best interest to do so.The worst is behind us. All this from a person who is generally pessimistic about people in general, but the need to come back from the economic and political abyss is so strong that I can no longer feel anything but optimistic.Don’t listen to the extremists from either side.

"Is China's push for universal battery swap standard going to hurt NIO?I am concerned with the push by the China to create a universal battery swap standard. It will surely be modeled after NIO's system and as such could/would cut in on NIO's profits as they are the only supplier now.NIO has patents on it, but lets all remember this is China and that could be disregarded for the ""Peoples Good"""

"Article released about chip shortage being resolved by Q3and Q4, I tried posting link multiple times , keeps getting deleted."
"Goldman’s report has revealed that Hedge Funds had shorted Tech stocks in 9 days of the last 10. This opens the door for the Nasdaq 100 to squeeze higher.The report released yesterday detailed that whist overall, clients had been net buyers of equities, they had sold tech names in heavy volume. Institutions were not just closing longs but also going short.This suggests that the market is rotating out of high-priced growth stocks and back into value stocks. Sector rotations are not uncommon in equity markets. Growth (tech) stocks have done particularly over the last year. Shuttered economies and uber-easy monetary policy have contributed to the Nasdaq 100 share price outperforming the Dow Jones by a huge margin since the start of the pandemic. They should burn along with their families... in hell"

"BARRONS Last week, NIO management sat down with Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung. The analyst says NIO expects the situation to ease in the June-July time frame. That’s a brighter outlook from late April, when NIO said on its first-quarter earnings conference call that the chip shortage was getting more severe.That means investors should be hearing better news on second-quarter conference calls. Chung rates NIO shares Hold and has a $57.60 price target for shares.This is good news for high-growth EV stocks such as NIO, which is down about 30% year to date. Higher interest rates and more EV competition in China have played a role in the decline of EV stocks, but the chip shortage has constrained exactly what investors want to see: growth."
How many shorties burn during the pre market . Hope i can trade during pre-market... during the $30 lol.

"NIO is a stock for the long run. It doesn't matter if you bought at 35 or 45, eventually this stock will explode. The battery swap technology is something no other company has to offer, that's what makes NIO unique for the EV market. The collaboration with Sinopec also shows that NIO is so much more than just a car manufacturer. Sinopec is the second biggest in China and choses a partnership with NIO.Chinese economy has grown 18,3% last year, the 5y agreement with Beijing to put battery-swap stations along the Capital Ring, the partnership with Sinopec, expansion to Europe etc..Former OPPO hardware director and head of Xiaomi's chip business has also joined NIO as hardware VP. Maybe they're working on developing its own chip?Once the chip shortage is resolved (maybe Q3), NIO might go to 50 $ by the end of this year.2022 will be the year NIO breaks 100 $.Fasten your seatbelts and hold your positions."

"NIO is a MONEY MACHINEHigher NIO deliveries and ASPs combined to push vehicle margin to 21.2%, up 400 bp q/q, the highest that NIO has seen and the highest between peers Li (LI) and XPeng (XPEV). Gross margin rose to 19.5%, a 230 bp increase from Q4, giving increased leverage down the line: gross profit rose 36.2%, operating loss shrunk 68.2%, and adjusted net loss shrunk 73.3%."
"What is happening is that Wall St. hates Cathie Wood, so they are shorting her ETF's to pieces which means all the individual stocks within her ETF's are headed south. Tesla will take all EV's down lower, and Musk's crypto plays aren't helping. Wall St./GS and hedge funds are in control. I can't remember seeing where DOW and S&P rise again and again while anything tech heads south. Inflation fears are way overblown, as they shouldn't cause tech stocks to crumble like this. GS is up and yet during real inflation, you want to be far away from banks. Went through high inflation in the mid 1970's. Banks love low inflation normally, because if they can borrow money at 1% and loan it out at 1.5%, that is a huge huge spread for them. I remember when banks had to pay 15% for a jumbo CD, but they could only loan money at 17% which was a much smaller spread that the 1-1.5% spread. I doubt inflation will hold like it did in the 1970's. but it could be an interesting ride for awhile. US is bashing China, yet China is playing the game much better than the US. Chinese EV's are selling more and more. Nearly all the buses are EV in China now and all the motorbikes are EV's. NIO is growing at a good pace in China and will succeed. Look at NIO's debt and then go look at GM and Ford's debt. Learn Mandarin folks. Go to you tube and watch some WHEELSBOY and his reviews on cars in China. Hang on to your hat. Hopefully, by September, we will see some of the fear leave the market, and the big money will have bought everyone's shares on the cheap and most of the middle class will see what it is like to be in the lower middle class."

"Some of the strongest pieces of the report came through NIO's margin profile, aided by battery upgrades and NIO Pilot uptake.

It seems that NIO parallels TSLA when it comes to share price. I just don’t understand why. NIO isn’t owned by TSLA. It’s a separate company and should move independently. Just don’t get it.
I feel better and better about my holdings. Long term eagle eye vision my longs. NIO will succeed

"What happenedShares of Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) were trading lower on Monday, on sectorwide weakness after another electric vehicle start-up reported sales well below Wall Street's expectations.As of 2:30 p.m. EDT, NIO's American depositary shares were down about 5.6% from Friday's closing price.So whatThere was some minor news on NIO on Monday, but it wasn't bad news. The Chinese government has developed new regulatory standards for electric vehicle battery swap stations, and NIO -- which operates one of the country's largest battery swap networks -- helped to write the new regulations. The new rules will go into effect on Nov. 1.￼NIO REPORTEDLY HELPED WRITE NEW REGULATIONS GOVERNING BATTERY-SWAP STATIONS IN CHINA. THE REGULATIONS WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN NOVEMBER. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.That's not why the stock is down today, of course. It's always hard to be sure, but I think it's probably down for a couple of reasons. First, U.S. electric commercial vehicle maker Workhorse Group reported first-quarter results that were well below Wall Street's expectations, at least with respect to revenue. The company shipped just six of its new delivery vans in the quarter, as various issues complicated its effort to ramp up production. Analysts had expected a much higher total. Did that sour some investors on the electric-vehicle segment as a whole? While NIO's business is in a much better place than Workhorse's, it's possible that Workhorse's woes were contributing to the broader EV stock sell-off on Monday.Now whatIt's also worth noting that segment leader Tesla has been under selling pressure recently. Tesla's stock was also down over 5% at 2:30 p.m. on Monday, and while the reasons for that are unrelated to NIO's business, investors have tended to buy and sell Tesla and other electric vehicle stocks as a group in recent weeks."
"Remember it was 3 bucks a share this time last year and went to 66, now is 35 so calculate where it will be next January"
NIO is past due for a move into the low $40's After Crypto Crashes we will be OK
No one with a brain will buy anything besides a NIO in EU if NIO offers the accommodations and services similarly to what they offer in China. Because not everyone cares about brand loyalty if the perks are and vehicle quality are just too good. Which is why NIO going to win.
THE BOTTOM. Third time 200-D tested and NIO BOUNCED.
"NIO: Implied upside of 53%A third hypergrowth stock that Wall Street professionals believe could soar over the next year is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer NIO (NYSE:NIO). Following the company's recent swoon, the Street is forecasting upside of as much as 53%.The ""Why NIO?"" question is pretty simple to answer: EVs are the future of the auto industry, and China is the largest auto market in the world. By 2035, the Society of Automotive Engineers of China has predicted that half of all auto sales will be new-energy vehicles, with roughly 95% of those being EVs. The Chinese EV market is ripe for the picking, which should allow NIO to secure a piece of a really large pie."
This is your last chance to sell all your nio shares before a huge drop tommorow with inflation data. Just buy dogecoin I already did
"Sorry about the late summary. Blame it on the side effect of the second vaccine shot.Here is my routine earnings call summary covering what wasn’t necessarily broadcasted or detailed by analyst publications with my thoughts added in parentheses. Hopefully, more details will be broadcasted in the coming days. NIO earnings call is always full of content. This one continues to show consistent vision, great progress on execution and built-in conservatism in projections. I definitely expect more great things to happen down the road.It took NIO 26 months to deliver the first 50,000 vehicles. It took nine months to deliver the second 50,000 vehicles.100 kWh battery pack widely welcome and take rate on new cars exceeded expectation; 10,000+ users already; 100kwh upgrade for existing cars available in June5 days of production suspension certainly had a negative impact in April (which was already reflected in the 7,100 units delivery result); those days were used to modify production line in preparation for ET7 mass production.During the Shanghai Auto Show, 180 NIO user volunteers worked at the NIO booth to explain products to visitors; 15 NIO users worked with experts to give 14 sessions/speeches on NIO Life; NIO user artwork show.Vehicle margin: current level comfortable and healthy; achieved earlier than expected.Chip shortage: There will be a delay in the impact of the Japan semiconductor company fire to be felt in mid-May. Expect inflection point in third quarter. Hundreds of NIO suppliers/partners just had a meeting. They are all very supportive of NIO’s business operation. (My interpretation: We are not promising or guaranteeing anything. But, our suppliers got our back.)Extraordinary General Meeting: Increase number of board members to be more diversified. Grant the NIO user trust the right to nominate directors to the board. (My thinking: William Li’s vision to build NIO into a user enterprise is genuine, which is reflected in all the moves he took. This is another significant step which will be recognized and appreciated by the affluent people in China. A lot of NIO users are successful entrepreneurs, small business users, company executives who desire to be part of the force to nurture NIO’s growth and see it become a first class global company. Also, there is a lot of eagerness from NIO users to become NIO shareholders. NIO’s continuous focus on user experience and user participation in management will undoubtedly have the chain effect of attracting a bigger user base and investor base in China once the company turns profitable and lists in China. Geely started to say they will build clubhouses etc. and was already called a copycat instead of being genuine. I admire Li’s originality and believe his genuine innovation will go further than profit driven copycats.)Competitor: NIO is very confident of overall competitiveness in premium brand market. NIO will be more competitive in the long run.ET7: Pushed up the schedule for suppliers, possible to start delivery in Q1 2022. NIO’s history of one new product per year showed massive capability and expertise in pushing high quality products out timely.Neo park: Government fund infrastructure, not NIO. Hundreds of companies will be there. NIO will be the most important. Huge benefits come from talent concentration, operational and supply chain efficiency improvement, etc. Example: when battery and whole car factories are next to each other, $100 per car saving just in battery logistics cost reduction. On the 1 million unit capacity, it can be tapped by anyone. If NIO gets there fast enough, it can be NIO’s. The same manufacture cooperation model. NIO focuses on process, technology, quality assurance, invest in some equipments; not on land, factory, staffing and operation.SINOPEC deal: No revenue or profit sharing agreement at this point. Use SINOPEC sites and share service personnel. Partnership isn’t exclusive for either company. NIO has sufficient location resources.Balancing gross margin and market share: No price cut to gain more market share. Brand reputation and community are important. NIO wants to be the Porsche which sells a small portion of VW’s units but accounts for 40%+ profit. Global premium market is 10+ million units. Massive room for growth. NIO wants to be a long-term winner.In-source chip design and production: This is a long-term topic, no specific plan to share.R&D expense: It goes with ET7 development stage. It will go up from Q2 while approaching ET7 production. Will increase investment in NT2/NT3 as well. Multiple products being developed in pipeline.Raw material cost: Well controlled because routine cost reductions more than offsetting the increases. Overall cost is still going down.Solid state battery progress on track.I can’t wait to have my very own ET7 when it hits US and become a proud NIO volunteer if I’m lucky enough to qualify."
Zoom out 3 years. You’ll be begging to buy at these levels in a few years. Tech will get some love again soon.

NIO will take over EV high-end segment and tesla goes to entry level because it can't compete on quality and service, quantity is the only only game for Elon. good luck with that and hope it will still can find buyers when Austin and Berlin factories online before year end. on battery front, tesla will ""probably "" produce some in 12-18 months."
"How dumbfounded you have to be to sell off at the bottomThis chip shortage is overblown foe the benefit of Hedge funds and the companies trying to buy low; it’s obvious There is no justification foe NIO to be at $30 per share I will keep buying this sale daysI am certain that even if NIO under delivers for May, they will catch up with great numbers very soon afterwards. I will continue to accumulate from the selling frenzy artificially fabricated by the hedge funds and shorts"
This is what a coiled spring looks like.
Tesla’s in Europe are MADE IN CHINA and better quality than those produced in the US. haha
If Tesla turns green and we don’t follow I’m out
"Clearly, the level of Chinese demand for Teslas is in question right now. That's bad news for the Silicon Valley carmaker's ambitious growth plans, but it seems to be giving NIO a nice opportunity to gain market share."
I heard about NIO the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Vehicle revenues, accounting for 92.8% of the total revenues, came in at $1.1303 million. The 489.8% year-over-year increase in vehicle revenues was attributed to higher deliveries, expansion of sales networks and an easier comparison with the COVID-19-hit year-ago quarter."
"NIO is building NeoPark with 11.3 square kilometers, over 10,000 R&D personnel and 40,000 technical workers, and an annual production capacity of 1 million vehicles and 100 GWh battery. NeoPark is expected to realize a gross yearly output of RMB 500 billion"
investing means riding the ups and downs. If market only goes up everyday that means free money.
"BATTERY SWAPPING IS THE ONLY SOLUTION It emulates the same instant service drivers are used to. It takes three minutes. Batteries are charged an tested, Large vehicles will need 400 volts and take hours to charge.Rapid charging is a safety risk and wears the battery sooner"
at least 10% up on Monday
Around 34.90 and 35 closing today. Shorts are working hard to keep us under 35..
I bought it at my price target at 35.435 ! And now we will go to 43$  amine
"When I bought NIO, it was not with the intention to sell on May 11th, 2021, and the list of reasons why I bought have only gotten longer since."
"At the 50th ""St. Gallen Symposium,"" a NIO Europe representative explained what sets NIO apart from other competitors as a manufacturer of smart electric vehicles."
Nio eating away at tesla in the ev market
Have fun losing money now
If only $nio was doing as well as $eeenf today id be happy
$32.50 yesterday was a bear trap. the bottom is forming
"NIO has a month by month narrative to move the shares to $60 in front of new plant launch, They will announce sold out months for the ET7 as early as June."
"Why I'm BUYING more Nio today:- no debt make Nio less interest rate sensitive - ""buy on fear"" - VIX jumping- European battery expansion - supply constraints are not permanent - GDP recovery strongNIo is not a short term playNio is not for the faint of heartIt is evolving into a transport tech behemoth It will take timeBLUE SKIES COMETH "
"Tesla red and NIO supergreen means one think. Buy the most advanced EV in the world. Buy it hard, money will flow by trillions here."
Tesla shares slide in wake of China sales slump
"NIO EPS beats by 0.95, beats on revenue!"
"Building the NIO brand in ChinaNIO believes that it offers customers in China a superior “ownership experience” to what Tesla can offer. Although investors might worry that price cuts instituted in the country on Tesla’s Model Y crossover EV might eat into NIO’s business, Feng says that, to the contrary, in China Tesla tends to serve a useful purpose by attracting owners of traditional internal combustion engine cars to the idea of owning an electric vehicle. But once they’re interested, customers often prefer to buy a NIO.Why? Name recognition is one factor. Feng says that within China, NIO has 80% brand awareness, and is admired for its interior design, handling/suspension, and “post-purchase service” — in particular its technology that permits batteries in NIO cars to be “chargeable, swappable, and upgradeable” (to batteries with longer range). 55% of NIO owners today subscribe to the company’s “Battery-as-a-Service” plan, buying their cars, but subscribing to the batteries that run them. And NIO plans to roll out autonomous driving software as a $100-a-month subscription offering beginning in Q1 2022."
"fraking bears are digging themselves into a hole and are blind to it because of the greed.. they such of been cutting some of their shorts.. oh well, I just hope that they get slam tomorrow and the next day and so on.. charts are looking bullish and starting to take form for a potential breakout through to $30s . gl"
TESLA missed the boat on BATTERY SWAP NIO BATTERY SWAP is why NIO retail longs will be retiring early
Richshaw Co. stock is trading much higher than Nio these days.
The capital gains tax rate increase is only for those earning a million usd a year. Chill...
I am not worried a bit. I know where NIO is going.
just like buying amazon in 1997 very strong buy
Hold your shares. Xpev is catching NIO share prices
"Investor Place :Recent Earnings Report Confirms: Nio Is the Best EV Stock on the MarketI have always been bullish on NIO stock and believe it has the power to deliver. It could be your best electric vehicle (EV) bet. Despite the pandemic, the company has soared to new highs and achieved strong revenue and deliveries. If you are keen on buying an EV stock, NIO stock will be your best bet. NIO has always impressed with the fundamentals and its Q1 results show that the company is far from its peak. Despite the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage, NIO’s revenue increased 481% as compared to the same quarter the previous year. It reported a revenue of $1.21 billion in the quarter. The gross profit reached $237 million which is a 36% jump from the previous quarter. It is impressive to see that the company went from loss to profit within one year. This is no small feat."
"On the capital gains tax:""Still, market observers said there was no small amount of doubt whether the capital gains tax proposal would make it through Congress.""If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC, referring to stock market indexes."""
All tech stocks are DOWN. this is hard times. just wait. patience. NIO NORWAY
"NIO has had their mobil eye on the USA since day one, Like most fledging EV companies will find out, NIO had to trim the sails to make ends meet in 2018 and scaled back US presence. The ET7 was designed by an American (see YouTube) Investors who follow this company closer than analysts will tell you. NIO will probably come to the USA the same way KIA and Hyundai. Parts made in Asia with American labor and jobs assembling. First NIO will show profit in China. Then when the day comes that LI Bin says ""we are going to the US"" this will be a $350 stock overnight, its only a matter of time and you can buy a ticket for only $40 on Monday .. circle this post."
Crushed earnings and the reward is that the stock tanks in pre-market trading. I'm long but extremely disappointed with the manipulation of this stock. Nothing but great news and this stock price cannot get past 43.00. I guess that I will just keep buying the dip.
Guys don’t listen to all the bashers on heat they are trying to get you to sell so they can buy for a cheaper price. DONT fall for it NIO is a awesome stock
"Attention all Longs Great Day , now you need to put in sell order at $100.00 a share !!! So shorts can not borrow shares tommorrow ThIs is very important !!!! For us to stay climbing!!! We then get to 300.00"
This is it people with new partnerships/new ET7 coming out and thousands pre sold /all those charging station and the Chinese Government Brain washing there people to purchase Nio this stock has nowhere else to go but the Moon.I can see this finishing in the high 30's end of the week.
"I don't know what is barking louder. My German Shepard of NIO ""the dog"" stock?"
"Nio is better than any of the TIN CANs out there and this is without doubtNiO is not only selling cars but they have a complete ecosystem and the TIN CANs have notNio will control 30% of all the sales in China and I would not be surprised if they control 25-30% Worldwide within the next few yearsI see NIo as the complete EV company and because of this, without a doubt NIO is and will continue to be the winner"
"Serious question, but what the #$%& is wrong with shorts on this board?! I don't want to sound overly disparaging, but it's almost as if they have mental issues. You can argue all you want about NIO's stock price fluctuating over the near term, but anyone would have to be genuinely clueless to think the company is going to fail. NIO is executing the early part of its business case...it's not a hard thing to understand! They're sitting on a ton of cash, have government support, and are being wooed by the european auto market...and STILL there are morons here who claim the stock will be at $20 next week. I've concluded that providing shorts with a million FACTS will not matter. It's like pouring water on sand."
NIO excellent EARNINGS POWER driving it upward. Get on the ROCKET ship.
Chip shortage and inflation over rated!
We aren’t TSLA! Let my people go!Blue sky is coming!
"If this NIO was from US the price would be at least $150 by now, I don’t know why people doesn’t believe in Chinese stock but Nio has finally entered in Europe hoping for green on upcoming days. We will see $500 a share in next 2-3 years "
"May 14, 2021 - NIO's lifestyle brand opens flagship store on Alibaba's TmallAlibaba reported on Thursday that its annual active consumers in China's retail market reached 811 million, with the average annual spending of users on Tmall, an e-commerce platform for corporate merchants, and Taobao, a platform for individual merchants, at RMB 9,200."
This is the bottom for today.. if you haven't already buy before earnings. $43 to $41 is a nice little opportunity. Here we go Nio! Don't try and time the market buy and hold!
usually drops 10am-ish.... let's see.
NIO was $3.98 one year ago today Now is your chance to get as rich as we have in NIO Buy all you can and watch
"Coiled spring baby! Look out...chip shortage over...15,000 pre sold ET7’s...new factory in less than a year! And as always Enjoy "
I've just transferred more funds this morning into my account. Now I'm ready to add some more to my core amount. On the bright side we are getting a half price discount! That's so amazing to be able to get an easy 100% return on all the shares we buy right now on these dips. I will try to buy every week until the volatility slows down. Longs this is the best opportunity to buy for the long term.
someone today is +10% up in his portfolio....
buying nio
Gap up tomorrow to $36; shorts are scared tonight !!!
Usually nio price down at earning date but big rise within next week. So next week at least 10 percent up.
BATTERY SWAP is worth more money in China than the market caps of most EVs
All I know is you should be buying here and Tesla. Incredible value no matter what these shorts and bears are saying. Tesla demand is extremely high. The only real competition in this segment within China is NIO. By their past reports I NIO looks to be in very high demand as well. The delivery numbers will continue to rise and beat expectations quarter after quarter for the next several years. This is the start of something bigger than these pea brained shorts can see. They only care about the short term and they play with fire. We saw what happened almost a year ago with Tesla the same thing can happen here. I’m a big buyer anywhere under $35. Good luck all longs!
This thing is set for a bull run... any one of these days
just saw the NIO factory areal look! wow. SP 100 is coming in couple of months
This board is filled with Nio shareholders who are stuck with heavy bags. I feel sorry for them
"Negatives:1. Being a Chinese Vehicle manufacturer2. NIO is a Cayman islands entity with many subsidiaries. NIO China, NIO US, stake with XPT.3. $XPEV, $LI and others EV players have all raised substantial cash. So, kind of race to the bottom from here to grab market share. Basically all of them are going to be cash incinerators.4. It also makes me wonder how their secondary offering and $XPEV were timed so well before market correction. The big guys knew it was the top.5. The European expansion story is a joke. It is going to be a hard sell in the lands of Porsche, BMW, VW, Daimler, Mercedez. Also, too many regulations. And not to mention the anti-China sentiment running there."
"The research is in. Battery Swapping technology is co$tly (very expensive to build battery stations as opposed to chargers), dangerous (thermal runaway is very real and one puncture to lithium ion battery is fatal) , and very wasteful (many spare batteries created) - thus defeating the purpose of ev's and transition to sustainable energy. please tell me the bull thesis"
"NIO is showing strength financially: margins have increased on some higher ASPs, and net loss has shrunk significantly. Key developments within European expansion through Norway, and increased offerings in Power and Services provide more value to customers and help generate consistent monthly revenue streams through subscriptions. Capacity expansion also will aid long-term delivery growth with the new plant planned at NeoPark. Although shares continue to consolidate around a $60 to 65 billion valuation amid industry headwinds, NIO's impressive long-term potential sets shares up for a positive long-term trajectory."
I love panic sellers...
"The perception is that NIO will by & large track Nasdaq, and this is drawing out shorts. As per yahoo finance, NIO float 1.26 billion shares. Short volume 73.4 million shares. This was as on 15 April 2021. Short volume on 15 March 2021 was 51.8 million shares with float about the same. So until perception changes or a big buyer steps in, further diminutive force may well be applied. But when that happens, the mother of all squeezes will be both painful, and awesome to behold!"
Nio $80 this year!
They had some interesting insights about NIO on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
will pop 10% or more today. Big Big Green day coming
If nasdaq keep retracing we can potentially go visit 28 or lower. Fundamentals hasn’t changed. But nio is in a market
Only the price has changed not the fundamentals.. Patience is the key NIO the future!
When the smoke clears NIO still has the cash and technology And all the help they want from Chinese government

Earnings will be great China’s ev market is booming nothing like the US.
Many EV companies had signed agreement with NiO for selling them the swap battery technology. This is the BIGGEST news and good outlook as more and more EV companies will co-operate with NIO.
so we have Nio auto and Nio life app which is a lot of items being made with recycle d auto scrap materials some really great projects . The more I find out about the company I'm proud to be an investor in Nio
"Smashed earnings. No worries, it's going to skyrocket at open. Just watch"
"Ha not even worried, I’ll check back in a few years! Long and strong .... see ya"
Here we go!!!!
That AH number is a deathblow for bargain seekers Looks like summer 2020 again. NIO will just keep going back to where it was and belongs $60's
It's getting unbearable
NIO will be a $120 stock .. Dec 2021 Make no mistake
im buying
"According to the latest long-term forecast, NIO price will hit $50 by the end of 2021 and then $75 by the end of 2022. NIO will rise to $100 within the year of 2023, $125 in 2024, $150 in 2025 and $200 in 2028."
"NIO continues to break records in its deliveries. The quarterly deliveries crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time. It hit 20,060 this quarter from 17,353 vehicles in the previous quarter. It shows the company’s ability to scale production despite the chip shortage. In April, the company showed 125% year-over-year growth and delivered 7,102 vehicles."
I hope shorts keep holding and do not cover. We need them for the push to 80. 
the only winner today is buffet stock
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Renesas-says-fire-hit-chip-plant-to-resume-full-production-in-May
Elon Musk just put the Kbosh on Dodecoin Rest of Crypto will follow
"Had to pick up 500 at $30.82 today! I’m back in! GM, F, and NIO! Once the chip shortage is over... and will be soon! All three will soar! Stop in at $29.95 because if it hits there... it will go much lower! Come on NIO!! Claw your way back!"
"Regarding these NIO ""price targets"" -- they are totally meaningless. They are part of the game Wall St. plays. For long term investors, forget analyst price targets ... just put them out of your head, and focus instead on the company itself, and if they are meeting their own projections. Those are the only ""targets"" that have any real meaning. I will guarantee you that professional investors pay little to no attention to ""price targets"". They know that price targets are chicken feed for all the nimrod amateurs and pseudo journalists, who need something to publish so their firms can sell ad's"
"Someone said $400 price target.NIO_Stock forum, where a Reddito- Nio shares could go from $40 to $400 in about 18 months."
The pre-market is setting up for a nice day!!
NIO has more cash on hand than CCIV has market cap $7.3 Billion Feel free to short it
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
Shorts have been screaming bankruptcy back when NIO was below 10$. They will continue to scream that when NIO drops 10% by the time it's in the hundreds $$ and still believe they are correct.This is a young company. A tech company. A Chinese company. Trifecta - and still standing its ground like a solid son of a gun.
"New factory phase one in less than a year. The new NIO campus will be 10 times the size of Tesla’s CA facility. China can build factories 10 times fast than the US... 1,000,000 vehicles per year coming in the next few years...and as always Enjoy "
"The whole market is too high, with P/E ratios of 29 for the Dow and 39 for the NASDAQ. Especially given covid, lockdowns and major geopolitical problems. I sold out and will wait for things to calm down.I still think NIO is a great company and will become a world leader, but a falling market takes down even the best stocks."
when all negative is time to buy
"4 reasons to BUY Nio 1. Expansion to Oslo, Norway 2. Neo Park and new factory Jac-Nio - 1 milion units per year 3. Nio's business model is similar to Apple . 4. Nio produces premium electric vehicles and jt’s a competitor with the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series and Mercedes S Class️Nio Long and beautiful company! "
if NIO is not allowed in the USA very soon... Tesla is toast in China
All the market is going to be redBuy strongBargain priceLet's hold over 30
"I have 30% invested in $SNDL, and $TLRY Just waiting for the FED to relax the law around THC and this will happen with this president. the rest of my investments are $AMC, $GME, $NIO and $AAPL"
NIO will be selling a million cars a year 4 years from now and you can buy it at $30 per share.
Three reasons I invested :1. Good looking Ev Company2. Lose money3. It cannot go down more than this (me the past 3 months)
I cannot wait until the next NIO DAY!!! This stock will double and more from this point!!
I almost feel sorry for the guy who sold me his shares at $37.4 premarket today. Sorry mate.
"Remember, Li Bin said he plans to up production starting July this year to 150k vehicles on one shift and 300k vehicles between two shifts. Semiconductor plants should also be operational in full swing by then. Buying now is prudent!"

"NIO plans to keep its focus on the luxury market in China, but also develop a new brand of cheaper EVs to compete with the Tesla 2, increasing its production volume of cars sold at lower price points “in the next few years.”"
Shorts will be surprised Monday...big news coming 
all my stocks are red...when will the market stop bleeding?
NIO battery swap will win the day.
Increasing fundamentals and falling stock prices
"Nio's Battery Swapping: The high cost, time and tedium associated with battery replacement and charging drove the innovation that is called battery swapping. In fact, Tesla tried it out in 2013 but eventually gave up on the concept. Nio's tryst with battery swapping began in 2014 when it introduced its battery swapping with the Nio Power Grid technology.The company's power swap technology is enabled by over 1,200 patents, and it takes merely 3 minutes to swap a fully charged battery, Nio said."
"The fundamentals really are on fire. It’s only a matter of time before the stock price catches up with them. Massive production plant with huge capacity being built, European expansion imminent, sales growing massively quarter over quarter, deliveries even in a global chip shortage very strong, 7 billion dollars worth of cash on hand. Brand recognition growing at an incredible rate, and as if that wasn’t enough, the actual cars are beautiful. Nio are in a spectacular position and in my eyes, is the best most undervalued company on the market right now."
US inflation has nothing to do with NIO . They are made and sold in China
"So Cramer said how come China does not have the same problem with getting chips as the American auto makers are having tough problems, and the reply on CNBC was cause the auto makers in China doubled ordered,and there you have it"
Start buying backGreen days ahead
It's more than obvious that EVs are the future. No matter how much they crush the EV sector. You just need to stay on course
Wait until NIO Lite comes out next year...we will have cars at all price points and options! Tesla is viewing left behind from a car standpoint...as always w

This is why people lose hope in the stock market
"Why is everybody so stressful? Just chill, in 5 years Nio will be huge. Once the chip shortage is a thing in the past and Neo Park is complete this stock will print"
THINK ABOUT THAT. NIO at this price is like buying Apple 10 years ago. Hold long!
"NIO is finalizing and launching it’s L4 autonomous tech and hardware with the ET7, so I’m betting that the second lower priced sedan will launch very soon after ET7, likely mid 2022....nice knowing you Model 3!"
Recent Earnings Report Confirms: Nio Is the Best EV Stock on the Market

"I am a college student who began investing around April of last year. I’ve worked at Walmart since the beginning of the pandemic and have saved $500 from every paycheck with the intent to invest. I made a good amount of money since I started having made around $5000 profit by the time March began. I began my position in NIO at $58 with 100 shares. I have held through all of this and now am at 247 shares at an average of $45 and will comtinue to hold these shares for another year at least. I have done about as much DD into one company as one person can do. I am by every definition an amateur. But if you’re nervous just remember that this isn’t Nikola, this is the Tesla Killer.

"NIO (NYSE:NIO), the largest EV manufacturer in China, is certainly kicking things into high gear. After announcing its entry into the EU market yesterday, the company today began construction on the gigantic NeoPark, a joint venture between NIO and the Heifei municipal government.The first phase of the NeoPark will cost RMB 50 billion ($7.7 billion). Once complete, the industrial park would span nearly 17,000 acres and boast of an annual production capacity of 1 million EVs. For comparison, Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Freemont facility spans 370 acres and has a production capacity of 500,000 units.NIO ("

The thing is that with this low volume and upward trend is encouraging. Mostly because there less selling and more buyers. We gave the shorts a break today to be sure. The reason I say that is they have way too much time to make a decision. As well as day traders. Just wait to see what happens when we break 35.50 to 36!
oversold
"To date, NIO vehicles have traveled to 350 cities in China.More than 36,000 users have driven more than 20,000 kilometers, and NIO Pilot has driven 164,068,765 kilometers.During the May Day holiday from May 1-5, NIO users drove 34.55 million kilometers and 1.07 million hours, reducing carbon emissions by 2,271 tons, the company said last week.During the May Day holiday, NIO users drove more than 4.7 million kilometers with NIO Pilot, an increase of 278% compared to the same period last year."

Zeekr is Geely's premium electric car brand.While praising both EVs, Li said he was disappointed with the electric flagship cars of traditional luxury car brands - Mercedes-Benz's EQS and BMW's iX series - and that ""many of the strange design and feature points are just incomprehensible."""

"Over 100m trades already… I guess as I said earlier, people are learning their lesson for the cryptos. Some investors always forget to diversify.

"From the Norwegian NIO site:Hi, our Norwegian friends! We are NIO. Next generation car manufacturer.The car industry is at a major crossroads.The future lies in smart, grid-connected and sustainable - but also self-driving - vehicles, and we intend to take the lead.We believe that there is more than products and technology that needs to change: Also how people use these products, and their entire ownership experience. We want you to once again feel the joy of owning a car.The question we ask ourselves is simple: Since driving a car leads to more pollution, and owning a car can be laborious, why should we still own cars?The answer is: People long for personalized experiences, just as they do with all other aspects of life. What if your car knew you and your preferences, and managed to make it less stressful to travel in traffic?We want to give the car manufacturers' premium services a whole new meaning. This means that we will produce products and offer services based on what customers need and want from a vehicle. This means that we deliver a fantastic ownership experience that will give you the same excited feeling as when you bought your first car.When this experience exceeds expectations, electric vehicles will simply be the most natural choice for everyone, and it will give us a more sustainable future. Then our vision of a cleaner planet can become a reality.In the beginning, cars gave people a whole new freedom by being able to get around on their own.In the future, the cars will go one step further and ensure that they do not have to steer the car themselves. It will also save them a lot of time.Today, Norway is leading the way to a brighter future, thanks to their contribution to the electric vehicles creating a better future.We are happy to be able to contribute to a brighter future together with all of you in Norway.A brighter future - a whole new era.NIO #BlueSkyComing.See you soon.William LiFounder, chairman of the board and CEO.Marius HaylerGeneral manager, NIO Norway AS"
There is no bottom. It could easily go back to $3. I will wait a couple months for this market to crash then buy heavy

"JP Morgan calls NIO's Q1 results 'clean beat' during industry headwindsMay 1, 2021Despite the challenges faced by global car companies due to chip shortages, the Chinese electric car company NIO still delivered Q1 results that exceeded expectations. In JP Morgan's view, that was a clean beat and a surprise."
"The only 2 reason why NIO is at this level, fear of inflation and chip shortage. Both will be gone in summer."
Don't let the price go downIt will be difficult to go up againStrong buy at the beginningAll the market is going to be red
"As I told you earlier, it is getting close to the Close so they are going to push NIO down to 34 because of expiring options, you could have made money by shorting when it was above 34 or buying when it was below, now going to close right below 34."
NIO has chips breaking news. Look it up TSMC
NiO short interest is almost 50%. Gonna be a sweet squeeze!
Dont be left behind. NIO is a great company with bright future. Get a few NIO shares. Anything below $40 is a steal and anything below $50 is a great price. This stock will hit $60. Buy with confidence!
Please dear lord ... let us have green week....nex week
"NIO closing strong. As jaded as us longs are, this may be the actual beginning of the ride up. There is a chance we never see $35 again... Regardless, holding long & strong and averaging down on dips like these whenever I can. Too much ahead and in store to sell at these low levels. Good luck to all!"
I am going to have a nice tasty fur burger for lunch. Made from Japanese meat. Wagyu.

NIO is a $60 Stock
"I think what everyone forgets to incorporate into the bottom line is the majority of the revenue won't be discovered for a couple of years. Currently we are just looking at margins on vehicle sales and amount of deliveries. The Baas is the hidden gem. Continued income stream for most cars sold. Once we get to a million cars sold imagine the % of sales that will opt for BaaS and pay $200-$300 for add on subscriptions including the autonomous driving? Sale of vehicle is just the start. Margins will be huge in the long term. Just to reiterate, Nio is far more than just a vehicle manufacturer.. they are a part of the revolution and infact Nio will start catching up to Tesla sooner than you think."
This is all part of the chart we are about to tap a bounce point.
At this rate I think I am going to be a former NIO millionaire.

"NIO has a great future, but at present the big boys are forcing it down. It must be manipulation because all the news has been good for the past 3 months, but the share price is down 43%/. It ccould go down further, to $20 or less. I am not a short, but I have sold out and will wait until it hits a definite bottom. Then I will buy back in."
"It's funny how back in November when we were in this same share price range that I told all the pumpers that they would have same old ""to the moon"", ""buy the dip"", $50 by Friday"", etc. mantras come May and that the share price would be the same as it is today (day last November). Well, that's what panned out and anyone who has the ability to research and analyze a company and its stock performance would have said the same thing at the time.Now, don't get me wrong, I am long and bullish, but the run up from near zero to $65 was a typical SP reaction and so was its expected collapse. NIO will do well in due course, but for a number of reasons it is more likely to finish 2021 around $55 than it is to finish around $75. The year of redemption is 2022 when it truly has the potential to end the year at or above $100.Let's be civil, sensible and smart.Thank you in advance for your usual splendid cooperation."

Sorry for your continued losses and the fact you haven't realized you should have gotten out a while back.Not exactly sure what it takes for you guy to figure this out but this as far as a stock goes is not the next TSLA. There is no next TSLA as far as stocks goes. That was once in a life time. You rookies got sucked into a dream and had a chance to make a good profit. Now it is dead money.

"What NIO did in the Paracel Islands is a little NIO! After all, it is not easy for us to travel to Sansha right now. How did Wei Lai (NIO) do it so well? It turns out that Weilai launched the ""Joint Green Island Construction"" plan on the Paracel Islands.This new Chinese energy automotive company will supply smart electric vehicles to the city of Sansha and will invest in the construction of charging and storage facilities to match the new energy layout on the island to form solar, wind and tidal power generation, storage of battery power and charging cells to supplement the energy., closed loop full clean energy chain for travel in electric vehicles. In the civilian transit of the island, farewell to fossil fuels. Such a practice must be the first case in the world, and it is also a national strategy of “peak carbon and carbon neutrality” with practical actions.For island travel enthusiasts, this image is really beautiful, driving a vehicle with no air pollution and no engine noise, swinging on the islands of the South China Sea ... For NIO, which has just entered the Nordic market, this step is even more important. It has the meaning of winning glory for the country."

"Folks that are long on NIO remain so. Nio has a number of positive catalysts either currently in play or on the horizon. Neo park, Power North plan, mach e mustangs can use nio charging(think about what other companies will make agreements to access Nio's network), et7 will be the death knell for Tesla in China, expansion into Norway. Feel free to add on as I'm sure I left some off. Longs add to your positions if you can. If not, you still own stock in an innovative company with solid leadership. That stands in stark contrast to tesla who won't even disclose if it sold all its cars in the Chinese market or exported them.. Nio is on sale, load up."

Good Luch everyone"

"Team NIO: Tuesday NIO Update: 1. Excellent interview with William Li, the CEO, at Shanghai Auto-show. I am confident NIO will once again surprise everybody with another beat for April and even 2Q, against noise about chip shortage which will be resolved by the second half the year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C3AW5MN9iI&t=202s2. NIO president says EV maker has capacity expansion plans: https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/20/nio-president-says-ev-maker-has-capacity-expansion-plans/NIO has further plans for capacity deployment and aims to announce them by May 1, Qin Lihong, co-founder and president of the Chinese electric vehicle company, said Monday.Qin made the remarks in an interview with Chinese media when asked if NIO was building a second factory.The NIO plant's capacity rose to 7,500 units per month at the beginning of the year, and deliveries last month were close to 7,300 units, with an actual capacity of a little more than 7,500 units, he said.NIO can produce 150,000 units per year and expects to reach it in less than a year, he said, adding that capacity is never a problem to worry about in China.In late January, CnEVPost reported that the construction of NIO's second plant has entered the construction bidding stage.The Hefei Public Resources Exchange Center issued a tender announcement to recruit contractors for the construction of a new energy passenger vehicle body parts project for Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co.The announcement did not specify that the project is NIO's second plant, but cls.cn quoted the project manager as saying, ""This project is the second plant JAC is building for NIO, and the current production capacity is no longer enough.""The announcement shows that the estimated contract price of the project is about RMB 350 million ($54 million), with a planned construction period of 370 calendar days.The construction of the project includes a new painting workshop, PDI workshop, energy center and sewage treatment station, parking lot for finished vehicles, shipping yard for finished vehicles and related supporting auxiliary facilities.3. NIO president says long-term preparations must be made for chip shortage:https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/20/nio-president-says-long-term-preparations-must-be-made-for-chip-shortage/With many black swan events happening in the world that are affecting chip supply, ""we have to be prepared for the long term, which is a new subject,"" Qin Lihong, co-founder and president of Chinese electric vehicle company NIO, said Monday.Qin said in a media interview on Monday that many people think of chips as a problem, but in fact chips are a series of problems. For example, there are 80 chips used in the NIO ES8 car, containing 40-50 categories.The recent shortage is not of computing chips for autonomous driving, but of basic chips, such as weight-sensing chips for seats, he said.Instead of having a shortage of one chip for several months in the past six months, a different chip has been facing shortages every week, according to Qin.""There are a lot of black swan events happening in the world that are impacting chip supply. I think we have to be prepared for the long term in this regard, and this is a new subject,"" he said.Super Long NIO. Cheers!"

"Friday what I said happened- many didn’t want to hear it but facts are…Next week… market week into Memorial Day weekend. I expect Joebama to say something about gatherings in a positive manner for those vaccinated. I expect some drop possibly Monday and Tuesday sadly maybe even the week. None the less what’s important are these next notes:If it drops to $33 that’s a good buy signal I’d say right now is also. If it drops below $30It may see $22 (That’s an abortion for me.)I will be watching for that. Next week or the week after this runs to $45 then $55 I’d expect by august.July 4th was Biden’s goal for regular gatherings. By then we are back to most norms. Although in China this doesn’t matter much but it’s listed on our market though. The day chart already says buy. Days run before months So once the 30day says buy that’s a jump in point. I’m assuming it’s $33s after a slight down trend which can happen premarket Monday. Or it can just take off.Case and point if it drops below $30runWe all doubt that though. Targets raised , plenty of support says we don’t touch it. Buckle up."
Nio results were better than I thought and I’m sure will be in profit before end of the year... looking forward to listening to the call later

NIO indicated that the chip shortage has remained the key constraint for its production in May, Chung tells investors in a research note. For early-to-mid May, the delayed impact of Renesas's fire put some pressure, and management expects the situation to ease in June or July, adds the analyst. Chung notes that NIO saw market demand recovering well since February and is confident of order gains"

"Nio Stock Picks Up Momentum Amid Shanghai Auto Show: Key Catalysts To WatchShanthi Rexaline --Thu, April 22, 2021, 3:24 PMSince completing a triple-bottom formation around $35 on April 15, NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) shares have been recovering. The stock received some support from positive headlines this week out of the Shanghai auto show. Nio On The Cusp Of A Breakout? Completion of a triple bottom pattern, technically, is bullish for a security, signaling that a possible reversal is in the offing.The stock rebounding off the same level for the third time suggests it has a strong support and bears are giving up. After hitting a high of $66.99 Jan 11 on the momentum imparted by the announcements at the Nio Day event, the shares consolidated the gains until early February.The market-wide tech sell-off in February proved a dampener for Nio, as the stock tumbled from a high of $64.60 on Feb. 10 to a low of $31.91 on March 5, a peak-trough decline of a little over 50%.Subsequently, the stock has bounced off the bottom around $35 three times, completing the triple bottom.If Nio shares sustain the uptrend, immediate resistance lies around $41. Outside of this level, the stock may also find resistance around the $48.50 and $55.50 levels."

"I have mentioned earlier crypto hype was created to move retails money from growth stocks to crypto. Stock market crash illusion just help to move most of retails inv. to crypto. They bought most of crypto at the bottom in large portion so they create a spike so many investors will follow, anytime they can sell that positions. Still money outflows from grows stocks increased the reduction in prices so big institutions can buy NOT sell all the stocks they have chosen yo buy this year. Is a behaviour science. Easy. Think a little bit. Common sense."

"NIO has always impressed with the fundamentals and its Q1 results show that the company is far from its peak. Despite the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage, NIO’s revenue increased 481% as compared to the same quarter the previous year. It reported a revenue of $1.21 billion in the quarter. The gross profit reached $237 million which is a 36% jump from the previous quarter. It is impressive to see that the company went from loss to profit within one year. This is no small feat."
"Nio’s update for the company’s March and first-quarter 2021 vehicle deliveries was nothing less than spectacular.It’s not every day that you’ll encounter percentages like these. We’ll start with the month of March, in which Nio delivered a total of 7,257 vehicles. That’s a fresh monthly record for the company, and it represents eye-popping 373% year-over-year growth.When we step back and analyze the full first quarter, the picture becomes even brighter. Nio delivered 20,060 vehicles during those three months, marking a new quarterly record for the company and signifying a 423% year-over-year improvement.Plenty Of RoomAs of March 31, 2021, Nio delivered 95,701 ES8, ES6 and EC6 model vehicles in total. That’s pretty impressive for a niche-market startup.Bear in mind, plenty of investors are snapping up shares of electric vehicle companies that haven’t actually delivered any vehicles to the public yet, such as Canoo (GOEV).What’s great about Nio is that the company’s vehicles are already on the roads."

"Li, talking to Bloomberg Television, said March was a “milestone for China’s smart EV market as it was the first time EVs accounted for more than 10% of new car sales.” “More and more individual users are buying EVs, and I think this is a very good start. I’m very optimistic about the market this year, including the second half,” he said. Xpeng’s He meanwhile predicted the market would enter a rapid expansion phase in 2023 with more mid-priced EVs required. The EV upstart, which like Nio is listed in the U.S., will be aided by the introduction of its P5 family sedan later in 2021, he said.Read more at: https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/cars-behind-glass-toyota-s-ev-push-shanghai-auto-show-updateCopyright  BloombergQuintRead more at: https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/cars-behind-glass-toyota-s-ev-push-shanghai-auto-show-updateCopyright  BloombergQuint"

It could be your best electric vehicle (EV) bet. Despite the pandemic, the company has soared to new highs and achieved strong revenue and deliveries. If you are keen on buying an EV stock, NIO stock will be your best bet.NIO has always impressed with the fundamentals and its Q1 results show that the company is far from its peak. Despite the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage, NIO’s revenue increased 481% as compared to the same quarter the previous year. It reported a revenue of $1.21 billion in the quarter. The gross profit reached $237 million which is a 36% jump from the previous quarter. It is impressive to see that the company went from loss to profit within one year. This is no small feat."

As boring as it sounds, these times are the best times to buy. People selling at lows to maybe get into Crypto highs, will only risk a double crash of their portfolio. Smart money is buying these lows, cause when the near Crypto bull run is over, and chip problem, inflation, etc is solved, guess where all the big money will be moving? Yes, u guessed right. And that's where you will have been holding and buying at the bottom, and everyone else will be FOMO'ing to get in. Do what you want, I'd recommend to buy and hold. Thank me in a few months."

"3 Stocks That Offer Explosive Potential GainsAll of these companies have major catalysts ahead of them.NIOnvestors looking for stocks with explosive growth potential sometimes seek out companies in sectors like biotech, where the outcomes can be almost binary. In the realm of cutting-edge healthcare, each hopeful new product or treatment will either be a success that could lead to monster profits, or fail to pass regulatory muster and earn nothing. Enough failures, and such companies' stock prices can go to zero. These three companies, on the other hand, have massive growth opportunities, but much less of that all-or-nothing risk. They either have successful businesses already, or are quickly growing in sectors that seem to have unstoppable momentum.Some of the catalysts that will be driving their share prices are more short term, while others will likely take years to play out. But there are good reasons to expect that electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO (NYSE:NIO), EV charging network leader ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT), and North American steelmaker Nucor (NYSE:NUE) could produce significant gains for shareholders in the years ahead.

IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.NIO: A massive and growing marketAs recently as early 2020, Shanghai-based NIO was flirting with bankruptcy. But a push by the Chinese government to accelerate the growth of that country's EV industry contributed to a strong surge in sales. The company more than doubled its vehicle deliveries in 2020 compared to 2019, though that still only amounted to about 44,000 electric cars. Its production growth rate is accelerating, however. In the first quarter of 2021, deliveries soared by more than 400% year over year to over 20,000.EV sales in China surpassed 1 million in 2020, and the government's goal is to expand that annual number to 5 million by 2025. According to a forecast from sector research organization BloombergNEF, China's EV sales could reach 10 million by 2030, and approach 20 million by 2040.The opportunity that degree of market growth represents hasn't been lost on investors. NIO stock is up more than 1,000% since its period of financial struggles a year ago. But its shares are also down by more than 40% from their recent peak. NIO's current $60 billion market capitalization is still pricing in an enormous amount of anticipated growth.The automaker will begin selling its ET7 luxury sedan early next year, and it recently announced plans for a new production factory. Its unique battery-swap subscription service, and an agreement with Ford (NYSE:F) to allow Chinese Mach E buyers to use NIO's charging network, will also add to its revenue streams. It certainly won't happen overnight, but the stock has the potential to advance well beyond its current level if the"

Besides the chip issue I don’t know one negative issue surrounding NIO or even $XPEV that would limit their potential. Only issue I feel that would impact EVs is the number of companies entering this sector. Although I don’t feel this should be an issue for quite sometime as there are plenty of consumers to go around.

"NIO: 'Tesla killer' wants better US-China cooperationRobin Brant - BBC News, Shanghai Wed, April 21, 2021NIO and Tesla are now among the most valuable car companies in the world; worth more than Ford, despite having sales that are still in the thousands, not the millions. Both are at the forefront of the race to develop the most advanced proprietary knowledge on Autonomous Driving. William Li is a serial entrepreneur and since NIO's founding in 2014 he has emerged as one of China's best known tech leaders. NIO is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Mr Li has drawn comparisons to the founder of e-commerce platform Alibaba Jack Ma, who also has a sizable footprint in both China and the US."
NIO the great....! I like it..thats it folks. Are Mythological greek stock God ...NIO the great will rise again like the phoenix out of the ashes. And those ashes will regenerate we vibrate and fertilize the blessed soil of our stock accounts which will be growing redwood trees flowers ferns in all around general happiness. This is simply the birth pains of life the labor pains which will bear the fruit of many years of joy and contentment that a newborn child brings his loving parents. So my fellow long investors weep not at these dark days.. buy the dips if you still can. And maybe go find a 2nd job like i will have to do soon ...lol just thought this post would cheer folks up..
Only 60.180 shares till now... no sellers... haha... we go UP today.
"I bought at 49.75, everyone at the time on this board said it will never touch the 40’s again and buy the dip because it will be $75 in 60 days, so I did after reading numerous posts and doing my DD , reading articles and watching YouTube videos on NIO, I feel somewhat dumb at this point , then Again I am an amateur still at trading"
"Buy buy buy this is your chance. CHEAP stocks, nobody sells now, all buys !!!!"
"I know someone from NIO… big news coming soon. This thing is going to Sky Rocket. Mark my words. Exciting times and this beauty is on sale. May 25th, mark it on your calendar "
REALITY CHECK NIO just beat by 75% and is .04 cents from being profitable.
"porsche has 51% voting rights in VW, but has 30% stake in VW, bases on market caps of porsche se vs VW, we can see it is about 25% cheaper than VW, and still reaps the profits VW makes.VW owns buggati, seat, porsche, audi etc.and much much more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The shares of Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) have received a reiterated price target of $64 by Morgan Stanley.
"Nio has found success in China as a seller of premium electric vehicles, so it follows that the company is aiming to replicate this success in international markets. The company says it has superior technology with respect to its product platform and autonomous driver assistance system. It also says it has been proactive in implementing several services to make its vehicles cost competitive.Nio's CEO William Li said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that it is nicely positioned in the premium segment,"
"If NIO reports more that 15,000 pre orders for the ET7 on Friday ,, this is a $60 again"
"I made 30 bucks yesterday, which means I should be a millionaire in 333 years!!"
Can the market bounce back?
These are the times I like to add some dips to my NIO blue chips
"More Smart Money Moves Into Nio As US Investment Bank Boosts HoldingsShanthi RexalineMon, May 17, 2021, 4:59 PM·1 min readNIO+1.17%New York Mellon Corporation's (NYSE: BK) U.S. investment bank has increased its holdings in NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) by 18.6%, according to a 13F filing by the bank.Bank of New York Mellon held 3.29 million shares of Nio at the end of the March quarter, up from the 2.782 million shares it held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.In terms of value, the bank held $128.16 million in shares at the end of the first quarter, compared to $135.614 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter.Nio's shares, which ran up to a record high of $66.99 on Jan. 11, have had a tumultuous quarter amid market-wide weakness and concerns over stretched valuation.In the first quarter, the stock was down about 20%. It has pulled back further in the quarter-to-date period. The lackluster run came despite a slew of positive news flow from the company, including strong quarterly results and deliveries for the first quarter."
"I think the most interesting part of the call was probably Bin Li elaborating on the NeoPark capacity utilization plans. Basically he implied NIO will not own any hard assets in the venture, that NIO should be allowed to make use of the full 1Mvpa capacity [if the growth is there], and that the new JV formed btwn JAC and NIO ""Jianglai"" will be responsible for plant/ park management and operations."
"If you look from a macro perspective, NIO is both part and inventor of an emerging and growing mobility and energy ecosystem. They work in a coherent and bold way, strategically teaming up with their partners in the field and treating their customers in a pleasant way. I haven’t seen greed and I think NIO as well as a number of their equals will do more than fine over the next decades.Maybe it’s wishful thinking but I sense a new way of running a corporation here: incorporating soft values as their core values, with long term prevailing over short term, quality over quantity … It looks good in every single way and it makes sense to me. All best from Europe."

Ev cars Ev scooters = the futureNio + Niu are the pearls of the game
The Chinese EV Market will shake out much like the U.S. Market has over the last hundred years. They will have thw Big 3 or 4 EV companies when all shakes out with many Failures and Aquisitions. Which is why I believe Nio will buy out a failing EV startup soon. Of course Nio is already in the top 3-4 EV companies.
"Thank all for being panic and sell your stocks during the week,I am glad to announce that I bought NIO, TESLA, PLTR. CCIV in a a very bottom prices.Why I dare to say so ?1.

This stock ain't going nowhere. The only way we will see an uptick is when Nio will unleash the et7 and that's a long way off.
First et7 rolls of the line today.Check Nioglobal on instagram
Blue sky is coming!
feels like a 4%+ day coming
Why are people worried? Pretty much all of the market is RED today!? $NIO will have a great earnings and will be $80-$100 within a YEAR
Relatively low volume with a healthy jump in price is a nice change of pace.
NIO is an INCREDIBLE growth story. $50B revenue within 5 years. Share price? $250?
this selling algo is really aggresive
"Positive comments coming from UBS:NIO IncSolid 21Q1 result with margin strengthQ: How does the result compare to expectation?Beat. Nio reported Q1 net loss of Rmb451mn, better than our estimate of Rmb811mnand VisibleAlpha consensus of Rmb1,110mn. Revenue came in at Rmb7,982mn, about6% ahead of consensus and our estimate, mainly due to stronger-than-expectedproduct mix, brought by 100kWh battery pack variant (25% adoption rate) and Nio Pilot(~50% adoption rate). Vehicle GPM came in at 21.2%, a historical new height andahead of both our estimate of 17.4% and consensus of 16.7%, largely due to thissuperior product mix.Q: What’s the most noteworthy in the result?This result contrasts with some peers who missed on Q1 result and may ease someinvestor concerns on Tesla Model Y impact on Nio ES6. The ability to shift product mix upin this rising competitive environment has indeed demonstrated Nio’s capability tosecure customer loyalty, due to its continuous brand building efforts. On the expenseside, R&D came in with Rmb 687mn only, 17% down q/q and >30% below our andconsensus forecast. In view that the company needs to accelerate its ET7 developmentfrom Q2 onwards, this part of cost saving might not sustain, as R&D is necessary anywayin our view. Overall, we consider -4% OPM for a company at this stage with 7k/monthvolume a decent achievement.Q: Has the outlook changed?Probably slightly upwards. Management guided Q2 delivery of 21-22k, which webelieve is largely in line with market expectation. As the product mix shifts upwards,there might be some upside potentials for its FY21 GPM assumptions.Valuation:After pulling back by 20% YTD, the stock is currently trading at 11.5/7.4x 21/22E EV/sales, compared to 11.4/8.2x of Tesla. Our PT of US$55 is based on 10x 22E EV/sales. Wethink the share price might react positively following this result."
I get so sick of this. NIO puts out so much good news yet it continues to fall. Does anyone in here have an idea as to why it continues to fall?
"NIO's own quarterly earnings were fairly good; its adjusted loss of $0.04 per share was better than what Wall Street was expecting (a loss of $0.10 per share). Revenue was higher as EV buyers elected premium options on their cars. Unfortunately, the chip shortage will continue to weigh on NIO as it is on Ford and other carmakers, keeping it about 25% to 30% below its monthly production capacity for the foreseeable future.If you want investment ideas from real knowledgeable traders, check them out at the https://dailytrading.tools/Trade-Ideas-Test-Drive platform"

I don’t have position but I can see high ratio difference between a calls and puts . Should be nice squeeze coming Monday as long as no bad news over the weekends
According to fact that so many pumpers are pumping crypto it is obviously time that crypto will fall hard
Nio is the best EV stock out there! 54.00 by September easily! probably more!

"3 Top Robinhood Stocks to Buy in MayNIO: A massive market opportunityThere is huge potential for growth in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Chinese EV maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) is a leader in the world's largest automotive market. There will be plenty of competition, but the company's sales are growing quickly, and it has begun construction on a new manufacturing facility. NIO delivered 20,060 vehicles in a strong first quarter, a jump of over 400% from the prior-year period. Deliveries in April 2021 grew 125% over last year's April shipments and this speed bump in growing sales has been a factor in the recent decline in the stock price. In late March, the company told investors it is being affected by the global semiconductor shortage -- a headwind being felt by many automakersNIO has several things investors should be excited about. Its new ET7 luxury sedan that will be available early next year expands its offerings beyond its current SUV designs. It is also expanding a network of battery swap and recharging stations that should help demand grow throughout the country, and bring NIO a growing income stream from the service. And NIO plans to expand beyond China. It recently announced an upcoming news conference where it will detail plans to enter the European market, beginning with Norway.NIO is still growing toward profitability and is worth a look for investors comfortable with risk as the EV market is expected to soar. Only 1.7 million EVs were sold in 2020, but industry research provider BloombergNEF expects that will reach 26 million by 2030, and more than double from there over the following 10 years."
"""China will overtake the US to become the world's largest economy by 2028, five years earlier than previously forecast, a report says."" from BBC now they say it might be by 2026. NIO is a great way to be part of China growth story."

"Tesla, Nio and other EV makers seek to build Apple-like brand loyalty among fansNio and Xpeng are building online communities for users to earn credit for other branded productsNio has sold more than 3 million products on its app and had 1.6 million Nio app members"
This is the market pulling NIO down and not because of NIO. NIO is still a strong buy at these prices and will be over 100.00 next year
can we have more volume than 60-70m ??? NIO desperately needs higher volume. otherwise it won't go higher. the float is killing here
China's EV startup NIO said a fire incident occurring to an ES8 SUV on April 22 that resulted from a short circuit after its battery pack was struck in chassis impacts.

BofA lowered target price for Tesla.NIO should not be affected. Nio is kicking a.s in Sales.
this is a pure China stock at the moment.. huge buying opportunity. no reason for this to go along with USA inflation BS
Nio and Tesla are being heavily shorted today.
At this time Tesla and NIO compete in different segments NIO ET7 will be a test and NIO could come out on top

If we have a strong opening with lots of buying power behind us we will break away from Tesla… Tesla moving away from crypto will be seen as a good sign for the hedge funds as they are more likely to invest… I think a lot of people didn’t like Tesla’s move to Bitcoin as it adds additional risk and additional factors to the stock price.

Trading doesn’t have to be about losing all the time. It doesn’t have to be about letting the markets pummel you day in day out. Fight back with (http://Pick-stocks.com). Beef up your defenses and join them.
I am close to tying NIO cars to their stock prices. Meaning why would I want to buy a car from a company that does not value their customers thru insuring their stock price is respectable. NIO is quickly making themselves look as if their stock price is just some random number not tied to any milestones or performance. This will kill NIO...
It’s almost humorous watching the NIO share holders continuing to play their instruments of hope as did the musicians on the sinking Titanic

I'm really regretting buying NIO
"It's very simple. NIO will grow continuously for the next few years. The stock price will follow inevitably.Just keep buying on dips and hold for a couple of years. Shorts can be right sometimes on short periods but longs will be the winners over a long period of time for this type of fundamentally sound company with massive growth potential. You say, it's been going down for a few months? So what? Loot at the stock over a period of few years if you are a serious investor. Blue Sky Coming!"
I buy....it goes down......I sell...it goes up. Do the opposite of what I do....lol
"Lousy article in Marketwatch today: ""EV Stocks NIO and XPeng Reported Impressive Deliveries. Why That’s Bad News."" Clearly written to shed a negative light on Nio and to influence sentiment. Why not write about -the strong delivery numbers despite semiconductor shortage-superb technology and design-european expansion plans-increasing production capacity to impressive quantity-and all the established knowledge networks?"

"April 19 (Reuters) - NIO Inc:* SAYS TO ADD 12,000 EV CHARGERS IN NORTHERN CHINA AREA IN THREE MONTHS Further company coverage: (Reporting by Beijing newsroom)"
"I could be wrong but, IMHO, this will likely continue on a downward decline, with a big final crash with the rest of the market after rates actually go up. Until then, the A.I. algorithmic strategy seems to be buy and sell in 20K to 50k chunks for a difference of within .10 to .30 cents or so = $2k to $5k every few minutes. Rinse and repeat several times, and then drop the price down to shake out more shorts, and start the process over again. Even with the stock price going down, big investment firms with high speed algorithmic trading platforms are still making money hand over fist. The only way to beat them, is to STOP SELLING, and let the mm's battle it out amongst themselves. Until then, the mm's will be profiting from the small retail investors. In my opinion, the best strategy at this point is to neither buy nor sell a single share."
"The sheer ignorance on this comment feed is astounding. “Oh but it’s made in China Dohhh” - he’s says - gazing with empty eyes through his Chinese manufactured phone.This company is revolutionary, not just on products but it’s service.Have any of you even seen NIO day and the enormous mass following on this company? Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. This company has epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It’s a lifestyle beyond the car. NIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn’t enough then feel free to visit one of the 200+ battery swap stations, increasing every day + 300,000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. Oh, and don’t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. As for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high-performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!! Let me translate: that’s equivalent to 7, yes you read that correctly - SEVEN -Tesla FSD computers. A total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one ADMS sensor are installed in the NIO ET7.Aquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in a vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters).As I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with Nio. LIFETIME FREE ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. LIFE TIME FREE CAR CONNECTIVITY. UNLIMITED ON THE SPOT TYRE REPAIR & BACKUP CHARGING CALL OUTS. Oh, did I mention NIO house? What’s Tesla doing? **tumbleweed**As for the market - do any of you truly understand how underpinning the success of a company is with the power of the Asian market? It’s ENORMOUS. It’s economy is now bigger than America, 40% of Tesla cars are sold here and with good reason. The demand is unprecedented. The supply simply can’t meet the demand. There’s room for both but Nio will dominate China and make waves in Europe and America. Heck, it would be immensely great with the Asian market alone. Before you know it you’ll be gopping at your neighbours NIO car, while you ping your 5 minute microwave (made in China) meal waiting for your Tesla to charge. Tesla is severely lacking in build quality. Off-set panelling, windows not fitted properly, seats that wear down faster than toilet paper and some dodgy paint jobs along the way. JAC motors builds NIO cars and they are well renowned for quality. NIO has research and development, design, manufacturing and offices in San Jose, Munich, London, Shanghai as well as eight other locations. They are employing and working with some of the greatest talent in the world. Do some homework and look up who deigned the ET7. Yes, NIO isn’t Tesla. NIO is taking is on completely different stance. It’s NIO within its own right. Believe or not I do love Tesla, I’m a massive fan! Elon is a visionary and I’d love to be riding shotgun to Mars one day! But don’t let that blind sight you from the uprising of perhaps one the biggest companies in the world. Infact...it already is."
$60.04 ▲ (50.70% Upside)Based on 10 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Nio in the last 3 months. The average price target is $60.04 with a high forecast of $81.00 and a low forecast of $38.80. The average price target represents a 50.70% increase from the last price of $39.84.

Biggest scam in the history of the stock market : Chinese Ev battery swapper NIO
Market wide sell off... NIO around $33 now... with this momentum sp of NIO most likely will go around $30 a share by end of this week or next week... I will add more shares then...
JUST BOUGHT 509 shares at 35.70.
"So the more good news they come out the more share drops. The more markets goes up the more NIO drops. The more cars they sell the more the share drops. Wait , I got it, let’s just stop the good news and start giving some bad news and then we will reverse the trend.I am glad one of us is thinking."

Fairly solid presentation overall, lots of enthusiasm. Did I miss anything? It's early here, lol"
US Gas issues will only speed the move to EVs
"TX Immediately following the fatal Tesla crash in Texas this weekend, reports from both local and national media outlets emerged citing the statements of Harris County Pct. 4 Constable Mark Herman, who remarked that police were 100% certain that there was no one in the driver seat of the ill-fated Model S when it crashed. Herman also commented that the Tesla fire was so severe that it took over 30,000 gallons of water and four hours to extinguish the flames from the crash, and that firefighters had to reach out to the EV maker for help in battling the fire. These statements have since been debunked (at least to some degree) by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who noted that data logs that have been recovered so far from the ill-fated Model S indicate that Autopilot was not enabled during the crash, and that the vehicle did not have any Full Sell-Driving functions activated. Musk’s update essentially threw a wrench on the pervading narrative that Autopilot likely caused the tragic crash. And now, even the reports about the Tesla fire have been thrown into question–by the man whose team extinguished the blaze no less. In a statement to the Houston Chronicle, Palmer Buck, fire chief for The Woodlands Township Fire Department, noted that contrary to some reports in the media, the Tesla Model S fire did not burn out of control for four hours. Interestingly enough, Buck remarked that his team actually managed to put down the fire within two to three minutes, which was enough for authorities to see that there were occupants in the vehicle. After these first two to three minutes, it was only a matter of keeping the batteries as cool as possible by pouring small amounts of water into the damaged battery pack. Buck described the fire department’s strategy in the following statement. “With respect to the fire fight, unfortunately, those rumors grew way out of control. It did not take us four hours to put out the blaze. Our guys got there and put down the fire within two to three minutes, enough to see the vehicle had occupants. After that, it was simply cooling the car as the batteries continued to have a chain reaction due to damage.“We could not tear it apart or move it around to get ‘final extinguishment’ because the fact that we had two bodies in there and it was then an investigation-slash-crime scene. We had to keep it cool, were on scene for four hours, but we were simply pouring a little bit of water on it. It was not because flames were coming out. It was a reaction in the battery pan. It was not an active fire,” Buck said.As for the rumors that the fire department had to call a Tesla hotline for tips on how to handle a battery fire, the Fire Chief stated that these reports were untrue. “We did not (call Tesla), and I do not know where (that rumor) came from. There is a chance someone else did, maybe the Harris County Fire Marshal, but we did not call (Tesla). Tesla has an emergency manual for first responders,” Buck said. He also noted that he is not aware of Tesla having a hotline for tips on how to control a battery fire. Buck also provided some new details about the Model S crash and how the fire department was involved. According to the fire chief, the first calls about the incident did not involve reports about a car at all. Instead, initial reports were about a fire in the woods. And while the Model S fire was notable when the firefighters arrived, it only took minutes to control the blaze from the vehicle. “The first calls that came in were a fire in the woods. Then we got at 9:30 p.m. where we got the first call when someone said, ‘I see a car in a tree, and it is on fire. They reported a car hit a tree, and it had exploded… That is when we added extra units (to the response). There is a big lake, and (the accident) was just to the left of the lake, closer to the exiting part of the street, not the end of the cul de sac. It was at an undeveloped lot. “(The Tesla) was heavily involved in flames. When the fire was put out, it was noticed there were two bodies (inside), and they were deceased. They continued extinguishment of the woods around (the car), putting out the trees and pine needles and what have you. I was there probably five to 10 minutes after that and at that point, every once in a while, the (battery) reaction would flame and it was mainly keeping water pouring on the battery,” Buck explained, adding that this was a process recommended by Tesla in cases of burning batteries.While a number of the initial reports about the tragic Tesla crash this weekend have been debunked by Elon Musk and now, the fire chief for The Woodlands Township Fire Department, the incident continues to attract some degree of drama. As per recent reports, Harris County Pct. 4 Constable Mark Herman has stated that investigators would be serving a search warrant on Tesla to gain all data from the ill-fated Model S. Federal regulators from the NHTSA and NTSB have also launched an investigation into the crash."

"""The Chip Shortage Could Be on Its Way Out. Here’s Where Things Stand for the Auto Industry.By Al RootUpdated May 18, 2021 11:46 am ET / Original May 18, 2021 11:19 am ETBARRON'S NEWSLETTERSBarron's Tech\A shortage of semiconductors is delaying automotive production by millions of units around the globe, costing auto makers billions in profits—just as demand is surging after the Covid-19 pandemic. But recent commentary from car and chip makers suggests that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel for the industry and for automotive investors.Investors have heard plenty about the current state of capacity problems for months. Roughly 2 million cars—or about 10% of quarterly global automotive production—weren’t built in the first quarter because of no chips. Ford Motor (ticker: F), one of the auto makers feeling the shortage most acutely, said in late April that it expects to lose about 50% of planned second-quarter production.It has been much harder for automotive investors to get a sense of when these supply chains issues actually will improve. But Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NIO) and chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International (0981.Hong Kong) are now offering some signs of hope for the industry.Last week, NIO management sat down with Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung. The analyst says NIO expects the situation to ease in the June-July time frame. That’s a brighter outlook from late April, when NIO said on its first-quarter earnings conference call that the chip shortage was getting more severe.https://www.barrons.com/articles/chip-shortage-cars-nio-ford-51621351133?siteid=yhoof2"

"History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was “made in china” at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do)."

So to swap my batter I have to 1. Make sure I have enough battery to drive to the nearest swap station even if it's more than 20 miles away. 2. I have to get in line to get battery swap out 3. Then I have to waste some battery from my freshly swap battery to drive home 4. Then I got to worry if they swap my batter with a used one if I recently bought a new Nio that comes with a new battery then they swap my new one with a used recharged one. There are many more uncertainty but too long to list

NIO Power Swap Station 2.0 is the world’s first mass-produced battery swap station that allows the vehicle to maneuver into the station automatically.
"Stellar fundamentals --- NIO has always impressed with the fundamentals and its Q1 results show that the company is far from its peak. Despite the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage, NIO’s revenue increased 481% as compared to the same quarter the previous year. It reported a revenue of $1.21 billion in the quarter. The gross profit reached $237 million which is a 36% jump from the previous quarter. It is impressive to see that the company went from loss to profit within one year. This is no small feat."
I’ll be honest..... this company is absolutely stellar. It’s incredibly nice to invest in this stock here and there and just focus on the news coming out. I used to monitor this everyday but that’s not the case anymore. Loving all the news of Norway expansion. Long and strong guys! Nothing but positive news has been coming out of NIO camp.
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has said it is coordinating with NIO to allow Mach-E owners to use the NIO charging network in China.

The market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent..
When the smoke clears NIO will have $7 billion in cash and the largest car factory in China
"NIO shouldn’t be moving up and down with TSLA. It should be moving on its own merit. In other words, it should be moving independently of TSLA. Just because TSLA goes down doesn’t mean NIO should go down."
Still waiting for the day we start outperforming tesla stock.
"Who believes NIO can reach $50 by end of May, 2021?"
I need to follow my own advice. Need to stop looking at this stock several times a day. I’m long NIO but it’s driving me effing insane sometimes…

"China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) earlier this month approved the National Standard for Battery Swap Safety Requirements for Electric Vehicles (GB/T 40032-2021), making it the industry's first mandatory standard governing the development of the battery swap model.The standard, drafted by companies including NIO, Beijing Electric Vehicle Co Ltd, and Geely, will come into effect on Nov. 1 this year, specifying safety requirements, test methods, and inspection rules for battery swappable electric vehicles.The SAMR said the standard is the first basic national standard in the battery swap field in China's automotive industry, which will help improve the safety level of electric vehicles using battery swap technology in terms of mechanical strength, electrical safety, environmental adaptability, and other aspects to ensure the safety of battery swap electric vehicles.The process for the development of the standard, released by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on May 10, shows that it began pre-study in November 2018, drafting in February 2020, and soliciting public comments in March 2020.According to the standard, models with snap-on batteries need to be able to support at least 5,000 battery swaps, while models with bolt-on batteries need to be able to support at least 1,500 battery swaps.Currently, battery swap-enabled vehicles are already in production, with NIO being the only vehicle company to deliver such vehicles on a large scale to the general consumer.Beijing Electric Vehicle is offering a large number of these vehicles to the cab market.Since last year, the battery swap model has received strong support from Chinese policy, with several government departments mentioning support for the construction of battery swap infrastructure.Last April, China set a requirement that subsidies for the new energy vehicle industry must be priced under RMB 300,000, but battery swap-enabled models are exempt from this requirement, allowing the high-end NIO to continue to enjoy past subsidies.As for why China supports the development of the battery swap model, Vice Minister of MIIT Xin Guobin mentioned the advantages of the model at a conference last year. Here is what he said: First, the battery swap model allows the body to be separated from the battery, which can reduce the cost of purchasing a vehicle for consumers. Second, the battery swap time is shorter than the time to fill a tank of gas, which can make consumers travel more conveniently. Third, the battery operation company will monitor, maintain and manage the battery centrally, which is conducive to extending the life of the power battery and improving the safety of the battery. Fourth, such batteries can be charged at preferential rates during off-peak hours, thus reducing charging costs. Fifth, consumers can consider how large the capacity of the battery rented that day according to the daily mileage, saving energy. Sixth, the battery swap model can also give rise to new service models."
"Huge and fantastic news! Today, April 29, the official construction of Neo Park begins on an area of 11.3 square km.It will have a production capacity of 1 million vehicles annually! ️️https://www.nio.com/de_DE/news/neopark-officially-kicks"

Sound Advice ... NIO regains star status on good old fundamentals.The market is going to move to companies with tangible assets and cash.NIO will have the largest EV manufacturing plant on planet earth in six months. China has no labor issues and NIO will end up with a Major US and EU partner. The US and EU do not have the laws or labor to ramp up EV alone.
Since I started to buy NIO a year ago the average price I paid lies below $20 per share...not selling...
"Missed Earning's Report and ""chip"" issue will push NIO down to low $20's. Don't buy until bottom is in which should be in 45 days or so. NIO has way more downside to go through especially if future orders drop like Tesla. So SCARY"

"There won't be any market crash soon. The economy is reopening and it seems like we already survived the worst. Any mentioning of the bubble on this stock is just shorts trying to scare you out to panic sell. Bubble is only there if big amount of money used to buy shares come from the loans which we know it isn't. Without the huge debt there are only left some people that bought with margin or levarage, but it is a minority of stockholders in this case. Anyone selling here at a loss is either a beginner that panics after stock crosses 200SMA or breaks the ""support"" at 35 or a gambler that counts on some lower prices. Current drop has nothing to do with NIO. Have you heard any bad news lately? Maybe I've missed sth. No I didn't! It is clearly a panic selling reinforced by stop-loss triggering by the hedgies. I believe it is the lowest share price you can get in foreseeable future. I ency those that can buy today, me myself I don't have more to put in this stock. But I am a true long and being here is a pleasure when you think of the future of this great company. See you all in 2022. Blue skies are coming!"

"Don't work for money, make money work for you.”― Warren Buffett"
Almost all investors are down. So many great companies on sale now including NIO. What is going down is going up and vice versa. The once who stay focus will be rewarded and we all know that.
From the penthouse to the outhouse in one month !!! The bubble has burst!
"$NIO and $XPEV following sentiment of TSLA is very unfortunate but a reality. Normally, when one company in the sector gets bad news, such as production drop news at TSLA, the competition benefits. NIO and XPEV have delivered positive news each month this year and they still have been battered to oblivion and presenting amazingly low prices. These selloffs for the past couple of months have been overblown and extremely disporptional to the positive fundamentals that haven't changed except for only improving. Keep buying. Keep holding for 5+ years."
You short i buy dips lets see who is making more money in a year ?
Crypto is starting to crash. Sooner than I actually expected. I thought it would be July before the major correction. I think these high growth stocks will start to see money slowly but surely transfer from there back into here and we will start another bull run. This time not at $2 starting point but $34+ starting point. Hope you all have been taking advantage of this generous discount given the amazing fundamentals we have had. Red on open big green Day!
I can not believe what happened with NIO today.The same old story about chip shortage which was known 2 moths ago. Bank of America must have made a gizilion today shorting it!

Solid state batteries are going to change the world of EV’s. The opinion of the scientific community is that they may be introduced around 2025 and will change the world. NIO is working on solid state batteries and will have the ability to quick change out any new advanced batteries coming out!
Remember when the big retirement accounts invested in Nio. Even though it was millions of shares Nio still didnt go up.
"Next 5 years NIO will crush any forecast, no matter what. Issues about price valuation will persist, there is no way to measure it besides we are paying for a tech company not a pure car company. Shorts will get burned soon or later. We will see better days, hold and watch how your wealth increases. I just bought more, as already mentioned this is a gift, dont let it pass by."
"Fellow NIO investors, its clear shorts are in control and I’m tired of seeing our hard earned investment go down daily. A lot of information below is basic but I’m putting because many investors still don’t know how to do step 2 below (read on and you will see)…we have invested in a very good company and instead of seeing our hard earned money grow, we’re seeing it drop little every day…not sure about you, but my investment is down hard and yes although I’m long on this, I’m not enjoying seeing my investment drip away! Just because you’re long doesn’t mean you’re immune to stress in seeing your investment drop!! With huge potential, amazing financials and a sound management team, there is no reason why this stock should be dropping. So why is it? Its dropping because fellow investors are getting nervous and selling at a loss to try and salvage some of their investment. They are selling because there are plenty of forces out there manipulating false news, spreading rumours about poor products, management, financials etc. to scare you into selling. When you panic sell you’re helping drive the SP down! Unless you’re desperate and need the money, DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS!!! You would never take your money and light it on fire, so why would you sell at a loss? That’s exactly what you’re doing. So how can we see our investment in this company grow? If we ALL band together as fellow investors and do the following we will see SP stop dropping and can get this turned around so we can all sleep stress free!1. Stop Selling your shares - at least for 1 quarter (3 months for those who don’t know what a quarter is) let your investment sit.2. Put a Sell Order with a High limit for min 1 quarter – How do you do this? Its simple and will take you a few minutes…Go into your trading account or call your broker and put a sell limit on every single share. Put the sell limit price super high and specify the sell date out by minimum 90 days. For Canadian stocks the furthest date you can specify is 90 days and for US stocks its 180 days. Here’s a link for your ease on how to prevent your shares from being borrowed by shorts (https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html) If we ALL do the above two steps, short sellers will be extremely limited in their ability to short the stock. They won’t be able to borrow your shares to drive price down!!! Yes, for all new investors, that’s exactly what they are doing…go to google and research “Shorting a stock” here’s a link for ease (https://www.fidelity.ca/fidca/en/investor/shortingstocks). You will quickly realise that if you follow the above to steps you will stop your shares from being borrowed. Now, after you’ve done the above two steps…go now and start doing research about the company, their products, their future, what is the potential of their product etc. This company makes products which ARE the future. They are going to change the way we live!!! PLEASE STOP getting tricked into selling your shares to shorts and see your investment grow! Now sit back, stop stressing and your hard earned money will start to grow. God Bless our investment! BUY, HOLD, and PROSPER!"
So wouldnt inflation and the coming devaluation of the us dollar make the CNY more valuable? why wouldn't this run counter to how the market broadly reacts to inflation. Shouldn't cny and Nio be a hedge against the inflation and a high growth market??? where is this news story?
my fortune cookie said $40+ coming soon. it also said shorts are ugly. hmmm
"Every year and every quarter NIO continues to improve. If I read it correctly, they also have 7 billion in cash. Unlike what I read from Tesla the other day, 98% of revenue for NIO is from cars.

"Strong deliveries for April despite the chip shortage that is haunting companies across the sector.What Happened: Close on the heels of a stellar quarterly report, Nio announced it delivered 7,102 vehicles in April.

Will we jump to $46 area?Don’t forget oftentimes NIO has a delay function in it SP response to positive news so expectation can be that we should see $46 before ER and then higher around mid-May........we shall see.Macro markets are bullish but we do still have the $1 chip issue.All IMHO.MUTE THE MUTTS.Go NIO!"
all noise now down a lot from the hype of 60$ .long its is very good investment.let check it in jan 2021
"NIO, not Tesla, leading the NASDAQ market up. POWER OF NIO."
"Inflation is good for stocks and assets. Why does gold go up as inflation rises? Why do assets go up as inflation rises?Because in the long run it's a store of value. Nio will become profitable in less than 2 years and only needs China to do so. Maybe in the short term bears will say it's bad. But judging by the ammount the FED has printed and will continue to print. I'm bullish on stocks as a store of wealth easily accessible to all. Minimum wage will increase as well. It'll be another bu run supplemented by the devalue of the dollar. Don't worry though. Other countries are going through bailouts as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just means that assets will continue to rise over time. If you realized how fast your dollar loses value, where will you put your money?Gold & silver? Not a bad choice, but a burden to carry or rely on others to hold.Stocks? Very easy to access, store of wealth, future companies that will generate revenue will be great choices. Nio will be profitable in less than 2 years. Tapping into new energy and EV.Housing? Low interest rates do not validate the all time high housing prices. And so far it looks like we will have a continued inflation of the bubble going over the proposed stimulus towards this bubble. So maybe. Assets will go up, stocks will go up. Everyone knows stocks are a good store of wealth. Especially undervalued foreign equities, value, and companies that transition into new markets. NIO wins."
"From 3 to 60 to 30 to 300... do u think I care about the 30?...Look at it as a long term investment if you believe in it... the shorts will enjoy sometimes, they also need some money...Blue sky is coming!"
NIO has been on the CNBC ticker all morning in green
"NIO ET7 vs Tesla Model S (a short comparison)NIO ET74 door, mid-sized sedan, dual motorPrice: starts at $69,200Output: combined output of 644 hp and 850 NmRange: 310 to 621 miles (70 kWh priced is 310 mi, 150 kWh option up to 621 mi)Acceleration: 0 to 100 km in 3.9sBreaking: 100km to 0 km in 100ftFeatures: battery swap, NOMI, luxury interior, 23 speaker audioAutonomous Driving (Aquila): uses 33 sensors, including 11 8-megapixel high-definition cameras and a long-distance high-definition camera, a high-resolution LIDAR with a 500 m (1,640.4 ft) range, 5 millimeter-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic radars, and 2 high-precision positioning units. The Aquila autonomous driving system generates 8 gigabytes of data per second which is analyzed by an onboard computer called AdamWarranty: NIO ET7 users also get free lifetime warranty, lifetime Power Swap benefits, free Power Home, lifetime free connectivity, and lifetime free out-of-town service.Tesla Model S5 door liftback, full size, dual motorPrice: starts at $69,420 (for long range model)Output: front and rear motor combined up to 615 kW (825 bhp) 1,300 N⋅m (960 lb⋅ft)Range: 345 to 402 mi with 100 kWh battery (smaller battery options available)Acceleration: 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 km/h) in 2.8 seconds (""Ludicrous"" mode)Acceleration: 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 km/h) in 3.2 seconds (""Insane"" mode)Autonomous Driving: suite of advanced driver-assistance system features offered by Tesla that has lane centering, traffic-aware cruise control, self-parking, automatic lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation on limited access freeways, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. In all of these features, the driver is responsible and the car requires constant supervision.Warranty: 4 yr/50,000 mi basic, 8 yr/unlimited mi powertrainSummary:These 2 cars are in direct competition at the same price.Tesla is faster, and longer established. Both cars have very good looks. NIO appears more luxurious and has some important advantaged features like battery swap and NOMI. NIO has more advanced sensors and processing power for autonomous driving. NIO has much better warranty and service package. I would also think that in China, where everyone does not have a garage like in the US, battery swap is a bigger advantage. I would think so is NOMI."
Think today we will have a little preview of a short squeeze...it is just my feeling...good luck to all Longs
"At NIO's annual event NIO Day on January 9 this year, William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, unveiled the NIO ET7 sedan and said that the model was available for pre-order and deliveries were expected to start in the first quarter of 2022."
"NIO Stock: $64 Target Reiterated By Morgan StanleyBy Amit Chowdhry ● May 8, 2021 The shares of Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) have received a reiterated price target of $64 by Morgan Stanley. And Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao is maintaining an “Overweight” rating on the shares."
"14-day RSI, a key momentum indicator, suggests the stock is in oversold territory. If buying sets in to take advantage of the oversold stock, it is likely that the stock will push past the near-term resistance around $35.50. Other key resistance areas are around $39.50 and $44."
Someone needs to tell nio that the market Is green today. It’s ok...you can go green too.
"After 6 months of holding... I’ve liquidated all my NIO stocks. -1.5k euro lost. That’s enough. I’ve learned a few lessons by myself, peace has no price and stress can kill you faster than anything. This stock seems to be in a coma for the moment and it might take a while until it will get back in pace. I don’t believe in it anymore. Stay safe and invest carefully. Learn to stop it when things start to affect your personal life and behaviour. Wish you all best!"
"Wow! I just read the investmentplace piece by thomas Neil. Seems he is only concerned with current chip shortage, growth & competition. He didn’t mention anything about baas or the new huge factory being built. I can’t wait but yet I can when short sighted analyst such as him will be eating their words in 12-18 months"

There are less than 7% of NIO shares available in the free float NIO makes Millionaires who dont sell
"Brutal 2021 for NIO, but guys this is just a natural shift in tides from getting out of a recession from last year. It's temporary. By 2022 this will shift back in a huge way. It's likely NIO will be turning profit and in multiple countries in 2022. Just be patient and keep the faith."
"Investors looking for stocks with explosive growth potential sometimes seek out companies in sectors like biotech, where the outcomes can be almost binary. In the realm of cutting-edge healthcare, each hopeful new product or treatment will either be a success that could lead to monster profits, or fail to pass regulatory muster and earn nothing. Enough failures, and such companies' stock prices can go to zero. on the other hand, other companies have massive growth opportunities, but much less of that all-or-nothing risk. They either have successful businesses already, or are quickly growing in sectors that seem to have unstoppable momentum.Some of the catalysts that will be driving their share prices are more short term, while others will likely take years to play out. But there are good reasons to expect that electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO (NYSE:NIO), EV could produce significant gains for shareholders in the years ahead."

Some existing investors also participated, including Nio Capital, Nio’s investment arm. With the latest funding, Innovusion has raised more than $100 million."

"In 2021 Norway became the first country in the world where the sale of electric cars has overtaken those powered by petrol, diesel and hybrid engines last year, with the German carmaker Volkswagen replacing Tesla as the top battery-vehicle producer, data shows.Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) made up 54.3% of all new cars sold in the Nordic country in 2020, a global record, up from 42.4% in 2019 and from a mere 1% of the overall market a decade ago, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said."

"NIO is unstoppable in the long run so fretting and handwringing in the short term is a waste of time. William Li grew up poor and became a billionaire due to his brilliance, hard work and persistence. This is only the beginning and anyone who believes Li would sell out to Apple or VW or anyone else doesn't understand the forces that drive a man like Li. Betting against Li is like betting against Mike Tyson in a fistfight with your grandmother"

NIO should be trading in the mid $40's with an upward trajectory
Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO) shares are trading higher by 6.4% at $33.22 Friday after the company grabbed the largest market share in China's all-electric SUV market in April.
"So please check my math and assumptions. q1 revenue was 1.2b. I am assuming q3 and 4 will be much better. Analyst are projecting 5.6b. Let's say that's correct. Tesla trades at at P/S of 23. NIO has been about 22. Based on 2021 estimated revenues, and $39, we are at about 11. Using the average of about 22, which is reasonable for the amount of growth coming, 22 x 5.6b is a market cap of $123b. Twice what the market cap is today, even if they just meet expectations. Easily $80 stock by EOY. Thumbs up if you agree or comment. Obviously this is only one factor but what's more important than revenue growth and demand."

"Probably oil companies and GS shorting all the EV sector, as they are afraid they will lose their stranglehold on energy in America. If they can BK all the EV companies, they still stand...if not, they will start to get much smaller. Exxon, Chevron, in cahoots with GS? China doesn't have much oil, so they are changing the energy market with solar and EV's, and that doesn't fit with the big money in America or UK."
What I find interesting is that all the experts that were on this board for the last few months touting this dog as the next best thing since the invention of the wheel are suddenly hiding under a rock. There were several of us (myself included) who warned that this thing was a piece of crapola. Notwithstanding the fact that the Chinese numbers are not to be trusted is the fact that the swap technology is clunky and unreliable (so--you drive into a swap station at 1 am with little charge left to discover that the station is out of order- what do you do then...call a tow truck?).

"These days I can see that investments are being put in sectors. So the trades are being made throughout those sectors. This is not a good practice to see if $TSLA is being sold, all other EV needs to follow. $NIO has its own entity and it will behave independently soon. Because it doesn’t have a weird CEO like Musk who influences the market by a bunch of tweets for his own wealth. Ever wondered why $BTC got pumped and now being sunken after his tweets all the way through last year?Same history is happening with $DOGE once it’s pumped enough, he will push for a dump.$NIO’s William Li never tweets weird financial advices but he’s minding his own comapny and the future of it!$NIO will soon jump off as their plans are ambitious and realistic!"
NIO is starting to show that it is going to a great LONG TERM company. Thanks for the discounted shares on the past month!. Time to head back up!
"I have not been inspired by any company like how Nio is.Their core, their culture has all the ingredients of a globally successful empire of a company."

"Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey says crypto investors could 'lose all their money'Business | 7 May 2021 7:01 pmFacebook twitter Print Font FontAndrew Bailey says he is being blunt about crypto assets. 'Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.'Andrew Bailey says he is being blunt about crypto assets. 'Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.'Cryptocurrencies “have no intrinsic value” and people who invest in them should be prepared to lose all their money, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said Thursday.Digital currencies like bitcoin, ether and even dogecoin have been on a tear this year, reminding some investors of the 2017 crypto bubble in which bitcoin blasted toward US$20,000, only to sink as low as US$3,122 a year later.Asked at a press conference about the rising value of cryptocurrencies on Thursday, Bailey said: “They have no intrinsic value. That doesn’t mean to say people don’t put value on them, because they can have extrinsic value. But they have no intrinsic value.”“I’m going to say this very bluntly again,” he added. “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”The Standard ChannelMore>>Bailey’s comments echoed a similar warning from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority.“Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money,” the financial services watchdog said in January.“If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money.”"

"The Nio normal: Chinese electric carmaker seeks to plug buyers into lifestyle appREUTERS 3:31 AM ET 4/27/2021 By Yilei Sun and Tony MunroeSHANGHAI (Reuters) - In Shanghai, aerospace executive Lu Hao didn't just buy a sleek electric SUV from Nio, China's answer to Tesla. He bought Nio's whole vision of a future where social media, e-commerce and the daily commute converge in one lifestyle app.In the morning, the 31-year-old eats cereal bought from the automaker's Nio Life online store while chatting on its app with other Nio owners. He wears Nio gear for the drive to and from work, and in the evenings relaxes at home with a glass of Nio wine and more chat with Nio owners about how to get the best out of their cars.""Buying Nio stuff has been a part of my daily life,"" said Lu, ""the prices are good and it is a habit to wear Nio clothes to events."" Over the past two years he has spent over 220,000 yuan ($34,000) on Nio Life products, on top of the 470,000 yuan he forked out to buy his ES8 SUV to replace a Ford Mondeo gasoline sedan. Automakers around the world have long sought to tap into brand loyalties with goods like branded t-shirts or caps. But Shanghai-based Nio's ambitions are much grander: a startup now valued at $70 billion according to its New York stock listing, it operates its own digital currency with tradeable credits that clients can gain from buying a car, attending events or even simply posting their stories on the Nio app.""Communities tend to lean towards loyalty ... that's exactly what Nio is tapping into,"" said Tu Le, analyst at China-based research firm Sino Auto Insights, referring to an app that Nio executives say now has around 150,000 daily users.""If Nio can continue to build the community, launch great products, and not have any major quality spills they are well-positioned to be a major player in China.""However, Le cautioned, ""Nio still hasn't figured out to convert more of the Nio community that haven't purchased a Nio vehicle into Nio (car) buyers, which is concerning.""THE NIO LIFEBacked by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd as well as global investors betting on an electric car boom in the world's biggest auto market, Nio's huge market value - just above that of Germany's BMW - provides a stark contrast with thus-far tiny sales.It sold just under 44,000 cars last year in China, a fraction of BMW's 2 million-plus global sales, and remained firmly in the red though it narrowed net losses significantly to $860 million.Shanghai's Lu might be among the more enthusiastic Nio owners, but he is far from alone. More than 80% of Nio customers participate in online or real-life Nio community activities, using Nio credits, apps and showrooms, according to executives who said Nio has sold over 3 million Nio Life products so far.""Deep and close contacts with customers help us adjust to the changes of auto industry more quickly,"" Nio's co-founder and president Qin Lihong told Reuters in a recent interview. Qin said Nio will build a user community in foreign markets when it does branch out overseas - Europe being a likely market at some stage - but will adjust to local environments.The same community message has been picked up by others.Geely, China's biggest private automaker, launched a new electric Zeekr brand with a similar strategy of city centre showrooms and lifestyle product lines. Meanwhile BMW, which has a long-time lifestyle product line, launched its car-owner app in China in last September.Nio designed its app, which make its credits different from hotel's points or airline's miles, in such a way as to try to attract customers to interact more with the company, Nio's user relations executive Calvin Shen said. ""Buying a car is a less frequent activity than taking a flight or shopping at supermarket, so we need to create more everyday activities to keep customers in touch,"" Shen said.Buyers like Shanghai's Lu are on board with that, using some of his Nio credits to secure tickets for this year's edition of company's annual 'Nio Day' celebration. The Chengdu event, livestreamed on the app, saw the unveiling of the company's first sedan, the ET7 - now set to join Lu's collection of Nio goods.($1 = 6.4879 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.

"I believe that Nio proves its strenght today. Comparing it to NASDAQ and Tesla stock, which isn't of course the best qualitative measure, but still they used to be connected somehow, Nio perform significantly better today even though it is red. The day haven't ended yet but I am hoping for even more buyers towards the end of the day. Remember that it is better to invest in Nio now than after 10% spike up which may happen soon, you will never know when! Accumulating shares on the way is the key to become financialy independent. Think about it is as an investment for your future. Selling after 5, 10, even 15 years might bring you the wealth that you would never dream of. I know that it is already a big company with 60 bln market cap but if they succeed in collecting the greatest amount of market share in china and developing the best autonomous cars in the world then this company can be worth trillions! I am 22 and I want to become a millionare by 25, and my millionare price is $250. Achievable in my opinion. Keep strong guys!"
"Citi is nothing but a giant pile of.... But they do somewhat have it right. The chip problem will clear within a quarter and orders and deal flow and cash position are very good. Not really a neutral and more a buy (especially at these prices if you are saying 57$ as they did) and if you are looking forward. I am averaged here at about 36 after taking some profits in the 60's, which is quite comfortable for me. Any purchase at these levels feels great for the short, mid, and long term. WAY OVERSOLD NOW!"
"NIO is a great company, with a great future; but three months of nothing but good news has brought nothing but three months of falling share price. There is something wrong here. The big boys must be manipulating it. I have sold out and will sit on the sidelined until thingd become clearer."
Nio stock down trend factors...Semiconductor scarcity..Elon musk Tesla overvalued dipping down for a big correction..Institutional buyers investing in EV sector hedge funds..Inflation heating up..Pandamic concern..Economic recession..etc
IF NIO STAYS ABOVE $30 IT WILL FLY TO THE UPPER $50 very soon. IF NIO IS BELOW $30. WE WILL SEE A PULLBACK TO THE LOWER $20s. IM PUTTING MY MONEY THAT THIS WILL FLY.
"As of March 2021, Nio had a robust cash buffer of $7.3 billion. Strong financial flexibility is likely to help the company in planning an aggressive expansion in several European countries."
Earnings + going into Europe next week will take Nio share over 50$+Buy now still cheap price
Tesla’s gigafactory in Berlin delayed 6 more months. Shanghai giga factory expansion was canceled. All these massive expansions ￼slow downs spells opportunities for NIO - NIO must quickly recover on the chip shortage (probably pay double and triple for now for the chip) just so can expand production numbers and assume more market shares from Slowing down Tesla. ￼
Keep in mind .. NIO is the favorite son of China China will make sure NIO wins
Can someone explain to me why this is dropping in pre-market despite a relatively positive earnings report?

"Nio Earnings Growth Is Still SolidFor Q1 2021, the company posted a non-GAAP net loss of 0.23 yuan or four cents per share, as compared to a loss of 1.60 yuan year over year. Revenue soared 481.8% to 7.98 billion yuan, or $1.218 billion year over year. Analysts were looking for a loss of 16 cents per share on sales of $1.02 billion. Gross margins also improved to 19.5% from negative 12.2% year over year."
"NIO has a market cap of $67 billion, almost three times bigger than XPeng. Its sales are also almost three times bigger at $2.5 billion, so it's got a similar price-to-sales multiple of 27x.talking about, winning in the huge Chinese market, if they can do it, it's a winning strategy, and then there's upside from there if you can expand further around the world. It's founder-led. CEO William Li is a career entrepreneur around the auto and internet spaces and the combination of the two. He owns over 10% of the stock, but controls about 40% of the voting control. So if you're buying NIO, you're buying into him. It has big company backing, including Tencent and Baidu"

"From a technical trading perspective, Nio is due for a large bounce, it is oversold on its RSI... as for 55 billion market cap with 2021 revenue almost at 5 billions, this is about 11 times forward Sales,, that's if they only produce 7000 car per month... if they grow that over time,, current valuation will be too low.. But of course, our dear wall street traders and investors are very short sighted and rotating into Value like Energy/Gas companies, commodity, whatever u have it,, i think overtime, those are money losing investments.

"April 22, 2021 03:24 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News -- Since completing a triple-bottom formation around $35 on April 15, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares have been recovering. The stock received some support from positive headlines this week out of the Shanghai auto show. Nio On The Cusp Of A Breakout? Completion of a triple bottom pattern, technically, is bullish for a security, signaling that a possible reversal is in the offing. The stock rebounding off the same level for the third time suggests it has a strong support and bears are giving up. After hitting a high of $66.99 Jan 11 on the momentum imparted by the announcements at the Nio Day event, the shares consolidated the gains until early February.The market-wide tech sell-off in February proved a dampener for Nio, as the stock tumbled from a high of $64.60 on Feb. 10 to a low of $31.91 on March 5, a peak-trough decline of a little over 50%.Subsequently, the stock has bounced off the bottom around $35 three times, completing the triple bottom.If Nio shares sustain the uptrend, immediate resistance lies around $41. Outside of this level, the stock may also find resistance around the $48.50 and $55.50 levels. Nio's Auto Show News: At the press event of the 19th International Automobile Industry Exhibition, widely known as Auto Shanghai 2021, Nio announced a Power North plan, the Blue Sky Lab fashion project and the interior of its flagship sedan ET7, which is slated for a commercial launch in the first quarter of 2022.At the event, William Li, the founder, chairman and CEO of Nio, presented optimistic projections about the Chinese EV market.Li said he expects new energy vehicle penetration to increase from 10% now to 20% in two years.Ahead of the Shanghai auto show, Nio announced a collaboration with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (NYSE:SHI) for setting up its Power Swap Station 2.0 at the oil giant's gas filling stations.Upcoming Nio Catalysts: The coming few weeks are key for Nio. The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter results April 29.Analysts, on average, estimate a loss of 16 cents per share, narrower than the 25-cent-per-share loss in the year-ago period. Revenues are expected to jump over 400% year-over-year to $1.02 billion.On the earnings call, the company is likely to shed more details on new products and services, and chip availability. The company was forced to shutter its plant for a few days in late March and early April due to chip supply shortages. Nio's April deliveries update is due in early May. This number could be of particular interest to investors due to the five-day factory shutdown that began March 29. Rumors abound that Nio may announce its European expansion plan May 7 or 8. As the EV maker prepares for its maiden overseas foray, investors may be keen to find out more details regarding the timeline, targets, localization of production, distribution and pricing.Confirmation from the company regarding a potential secondary listing in Hong Kong is also seen as a positive for the stock. With the listing, the company is setting up the possibility of expanding its investor base and in turn financing sources."

"SHANGHAI— Tesla Inc. exported most of the cars produced at its Shanghai factory in April, in a sign of how much the electric-vehicle maker is using the Chinese plant to satisfy demand outside the country.The EV maker sold 11,671 locally built Model 3 and Model Y cars in China last month, while exporting a further 14,174, according to the China Passenger Car Association. It was the first time that the association broke down the sales that way and comes amid questions about the strength of demand for Tesla’s electric vehicles in China after a run of adverse publicity.Tesla’s car production in China dropped 27% from March to April, this a huge production reduction in one month for Tesla. Even more interesting that Tesla only sold 11,671 of it cars in China, solid clear factual indication that it have lose a massive market shares to the local 3 auto maker (NIO, SPEV and Li) which was about 17,800 combined sales! There is a major shift happening in the EV market in China - and conveniently not of these is covered by the media in the US Market. Since Feb. 8th TSLA’s SP dropped 35%, dragging the entire EV & battery sector down 50%-65%. - the hedge funds realizing this major shift taking place in China EV (largest market in the world) collectively has taken full advantage with massive shortening of all the Chinese EV stocks to assume much larger position in major discount from the panicking majority retailers position ￼” a classical move “ - once the chain supply of chips Shortage / batteries will be resolve soon, all 3 Chinese EV makers will surge in deliveries number for Q3 & Q4 and beyond and their SP will follow up sharply as well! - these are my analysis on the current events taking place with NIO stock. And my recommendations is hold on to your shares and accumulate as much as you can, you won’t regret it. ￼"

"From a financial perspective, Nio reported a vehicle margin of 21.2% for Q1 2021 as compared to a negative vehicle margin of 7.4% in Q1 2020. Even on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the company’s vehicle margin expanded. With increasing vehicle deliveries, vehicle margin will likely continue to improve."
"Currently, battery swap-enabled vehicles are already in production, with NIO being the only vehicle company to deliver such vehicles on a large scale to the general consumer.Beijing Electric Vehicle is offering a large number of these vehicles to the cab market.Since last year, the battery swap model has received strong support from Chinese policy, with several government departments mentioning support for the construction of battery swap infrastructure.Last April, China set a requirement that subsidies for the new energy vehicle industry must be priced under RMB 300,000, but battery swap-enabled models are exempt from this requirement, allowing the high-end NIO to continue to enjoy past subsidies."

Why all the market is full red ?
"JP Morgan calls NIO's Q1 results 'clean beat' during industry headwindsPhate ZhangMay 1, 2021Despite the challenges faced by global car companies due to chip shortages, the Chinese electric car company NIO still delivered Q1 results that exceeded expectations. In JP Morgan's view, that was a clean beat and a surprise.NIO's unaudited earnings report showed that its revenue for the first quarter was RMB 7.98 billion yuan ($1.22 billion), beating market expectations of 6.65 billion yuan and up about 482% from a year ago.NIO's adjusted loss per ADS was RMB 0.23, a 75% reduction from RMB 0.93 in the fourth quarter.The company's gross margin was 19.5 percent in the first quarter, higher than 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Its vehicle margin was 21.2% in the first quarter, compared with a negative 7.4% in the same period last year. In a research note Friday, JP Morgan analyst Nick Lai's team said NIO ""surprisingly"" managed the industry headwinds well in the first quarter.The team wrote:Narratives at the company's 1Q21 result call today -despite a clean beat - mostly surrounded two major industry headwinds, which not only sent China auto stocks down, but in some cases pressured the companies' margins (e.g. Great Wall, BYD, SAIC): 1) chip shortages and production outlook, and 2) profitability from here in light of elevated material prices，production lost due to tight chip or battery supply and heightened industry competition.Nio, surprisingly, has managed all these well in 1Q21 with record-high vehicle GPM (21.2% vs JPM's earlier estimate of 17.3%) driven by content increases (through high take rate for100Khw battery and Nio pilot options) and contained BOM (bill of materials).The team said they will continue to look for signs of ""sequential improvement"" in chip supply and expect the problem to be fully mitigated by the end of the year or the first half of next year.Before the problem is fully alleviated, the chip supply situation could change from the current ""shortage"" to a potential ""tight"" and such an inflection point is likely to occur this summer, the team said.According to the team, if this scenario materializes, it should mark the bottom of the auto company's share price performance.In the long term, JP Morgan maintains a positive thesis on NIO and expects the company to achieve 106% and 93% volume growth in 2021 and 2022, respectively."

"NIO just broke through the 4hr-200MA; the last time this happened was in 5/2020, when its SP was ~$4. Its SP shot up 16x to ~$66 nine months later, before consolidating down to the 200MA again. This time, NIO has the potential to shoot up to $500+ before consolidating down to the 200MA again; with all the positive news, we may see it before the end of 2022."
"Big green weeks coming Nio over $50 end of May. The selling cycle is over. Taxes sorted, chip shortage sorted. Inflation under control. Upwards momentum huge. Tech is too cheap. Great buying opportunities"
"The last couple of months have not made me question my commitment to NIO. It has only made me question the integrity of the market, and understand that things don't just keep going up. NIO is going to make me/us so much better off than I/we have ever been, and I am saying the absolute truth. This is coming from more research than I have ever invested in any stock.It is the perfect time for EV's, in the perfect country (China sells more than half of the world's EV's). The Chinese government has mandated/projected 5 million EV's sold/year by 2025, which is a 40% gain per year to reach that level. China bought about 1.2 million EV's last year, and projections are for over 5 million in 2025!!! That is an increase of about 40%, and if you projected NIO's stock price by 40%/ year, you are going to be around $300 by 2026. I actually think NIO will do better than that because they will eat up market share when they start to sell mid-range cars, increase their margins, start to sell their iconic ET7, and achieve their level 4 autonomous driving platform. I have been biting my nails the last couple of months, yet I haven't sold my NIO because I know this is the current GOLD STANDARD in the EV commodity, similar to Amazon in the early 2000's. I have been watching this go down, and all that has been impressed in me is that this is an oil well that is in it's infancy, with most people having no idea how big the well will become. I really believe that this will eventually be in the top 3-4 companies in the world, with the potential to be bigger than Apple! Fun fact! NIO just passed the 2 billion kilometer mark for NIO drivers!! This is data to be used in the development in their autonomous driving platform. Data IS the driving force (please excuse the pun) in autonomous driving! Li Bin has a vision that includes being the best autonomous driving platform. The Holy Grail in the future! NIO has 2 of the top 3 experts in autonomous driving. Research Ren Shaoquing (#1 in the world) and Zhang Jianyong (#3 in the world)! Both work for our NIO! Research who is the MOST cited in the world for autonomous driving! NIO acquired Momenta, an autonomous driving company from Ren Shaoquing, and made Ren a vice president under Li Bin. A quiet MOMENTOUS moment!! Battery swapping in the only country that has given subsidies for battery swapping, and oh, by the way, China chose NIO's battery swapping model as the standard!! I know I am considered a pumper, but it truly comes from the heart and research, and NIO is by far my biggest holding. My position built up in time as I learned more about NIO and Li Bin. Covid has kept me in the house researching (mostly) NIO, and my other stocks."

Ford and GM are also adversely impacted by the chip shortage. But you wouldn’t know it because analyst coverage is biased.

"Phantom Shares aka Short Selling still persists at Illegal Time of Day. SEC mandates that Short Selling can not commence until 8am even though people are permitted to trade at 7am. Today, one can Trade at 4am. Very few Brokerages permit this. There are still Short Sales occurring prior to 8am, and yet the SEC ignores it. They pretty much Ignore everything in violation of Regulation ""SHO"", Brokerage houses don't even have to report the amount of Shares Short their Firm holds until the end of a Q, and again Yearly. The SEC maintains a Blind Eye towrds this practice, if they ever enforced Reg SHO it could Topple quite a few Firms, but exposing/investigating it is impossible. So you never hear of any Violations, because they are almost impossible to uncover.If you want to really learn how useless the SEC is, just Read this Article and see for yourself how Corrupt the Markets are and what happens if you try and Expose it.Phantom shares on Wall Street threaten U.S. companies, investorsRevelations of “Naked, Short & Greedy” by Susanne TrimbathBy Lucy KomisarMarch 26, 2020"

that after market activity is nice 
"My opinion, worth just what you pay for it, believes that NIO will trade up and down and in a range between $32-$40 until later in August, and then hang on to your hat. Chip shortage will dwindle, it will be one month before selling cars in Norway, more swapping stations and high speed stations will be installed, much of the new factory will be nearing completion, orders for the ET7 will be way up, the listing on the Chinese exchanges will be becoming reality, margins for the second quarter along with earnings will be released, more presence of NIO connections with Alibaba selling goods will be present and their ecommerce will start sending money to NIO, more of the autonomous driving subscriptions will be sold increasing monthly revenue and the coming fruition will begin to play out late summer. Tech will not have an evil name put on it. The one drawback is if the US govt keeps trying to badmouth China all the time and relations get too strained."
This won’t be closing over $35 this week based on the options activity. We’ll see.
"If you see the one year chart we should be a 45$ level. Think we will reach that. Because it's a continuous growth on good news, which make sense for a company with that prospects. We have seen a hype and a call which is not unusual. But the main trend is ok. 65 eoy"

"Guys, keep in mind why EV technology is so crucial for China. They have to pay for oil in dollars while America can just print more money (paper).

"I think everyone forgets you can charge Nio battery's too, not just swap them. And they have mobile chargers. They just have multiple ways to allow EV to be convenient and are customer centric. Yes the infrastructure costs money, bit they have partners, plus it generates residual income. Wait til other vehicles use their swappable battery system. I'm tired of all the bashing of BaaS which will be one of their larger revenue streams.Of course, also, as battery tech quickly advances ove the next several years BaaS keeps the NIO cars more upto date, which will also mean higher resale value. Don't forget the possible benefits to selling power back to the electrical grid.Enough about swappable battery being a problem, it's also backed by the Chinese government."
"I’ve got a tonne of NIO @ $42.10. I believe in this company, that they can be successful over the long haul, but there’s no way that I’m selling now, despite my belief that it’s going below $30 fairly soon. Meanwhile, I bought 10 puts at $34 for $2.13 each, and will be exercising soon"

"China's state media says smart EV industry seeing explosive growth-CnEVPost(Source: CnEVPost)The Shanghai auto show at the end of last month, dubbed by many as the ""Shanghai Electric Car Show,"" showed how hot the electric car industry is growing in China. In an article Wednesday, state-owned media outlet People's Daily summed up their feelings about the show.Commentary from state-owned media is highly watched in China because they often imply policy signals and are an important reference for investors looking at industry trends.In the article, the People's Daily said that at this year's Shanghai auto show, for the first time, smart electric cars are no longer just a concept, but perceptible mass-produced products. At this year's Shanghai auto show, almost all foreign and Chinese brand car companies launched mass-produced smart electric vehicles, and more than 20 new smart electric vehicle brands, including Zeekr, Voyah, IM Motors, Hengchi, HiPhi, and R bran, took the stage with their main models that will be launched this year and next year, the article wrote.Huawei, DJI, Horizon Robotics, BlackSesame, and nearly 100 other companies in the chip, radar, advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous driving solutions, connected vehicles, and high precision mapping industries are also launching mass production products and solutions, the article mentions.""At this momentum, it is possible for China's new energy vehicle sales to break through 2 million units this year, or even exceed 2.5 million units."" More than one industry expert expressed optimism about the new energy vehicle market at the Shanghai auto show site, the report said.Data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers shows that in the first quarter of this year, China's new energy vehicle sales reached 515,000 units, up 2.8 times year-on-year. Among them, 433,000 pure electric vehicles were sold, up 3.1 times year on year."
Take into consideration that NIO is still a company that many people are unaware of. With increasing company awareness new investors will come. Also Nio is doing great job with their expansion plans etc. The growth in SP is inevitable. Go long!

"A 2021 Autolist survey identifies EV battery range as being the primary concern among over 60% of respondents. But the larger story is that price and charging infrastructure came in second and third respectively. This creates a win-win-win situation for Nio. With the ability for owners to swap their batteries in what Nio claims will be less than three minutes, range becomes less of a concern.Plus, being able to sell the battery as a separate item lowers the price of a Nio which already benefits from subsidies."
"This is so weird, and almost funny. One good news after another with EV being the future, but dropping like this company is going bankrupt with bad earnings and bad delivery."
"Most Gasoline cars will last about 100,000 miles - after that is most costly to maintaining them, to many parts on them just wear out; engine, transmission, Radiator, manifold exhaust, fuel and water pumps and many many other smaller parts and components need to be replaced.... in comparison to EV cars, the electric ️ engine can go for millions of miles without - beside the brakes and tires regular 20/30k replacement nothing needed to be replaced.

Get ready for the run
"Nio has already made a deal with the Norwegian government for 4 battery swap stations in Oslo, the capital. Agreement has also been made to expand this to other cities in Norway. Nio’s ‘club-Centre’ is at the best possible location in Oslo, Karl Johan’s Gate, and will for sure attract a lot of attention. Around 40% of new car purchases in Norway are EV’s, the highest density in the world. The Norwegians know their battery driven vehicles, which is why NIO chose Norway as their test market. It’s like trying out your new line of fashion in Milan. If you can make it there, you can make it everywhere. So don’t get fooled by the small population and market that Norway represent. It’s a prelude for things to come."

"If you had any doubts about Nio’s ability to ramp up production, those should be gone at this point. On April 7, the company announced it had hit a huge milestone. Less than three quarters after producing EV number 50,000 Nio announced that EV number 100,000 had rolled off the line. Its first quarter of 2021 deliveries of 20,060 vehicles was up 423% compared to Q1 2020.Having 100,000 EVs delivered to customers is a big deal. None other than Elon Musk tweeted his congratulations, noting “That is a tough milestone.”"
"NIO is one of the truly undervalued stocks right now. When you think how the shares lost value since the constant revenue generating advances NIO has made since NIO day its almost bizarre. Longs dont let go because they dont have to, Most of then made a bundle already. The hedges sell every uptick trying to shake retail out and they have gotten nowhere, with retail controlling NIO Its like a Mexican standoff. I.m betting the day traders wind up flattened out first and then we move up mid $40s+"
"At this point most people are not buying or selling based on the company, they are buying or selling based on the outside or external factors.Unfortunately this has gotten NIO some unwanted attention from shorts who only make things worse. NIO is still the same amazing company, never forget that."

"Recent Earnings Report Confirms: Nio Is the Best EV Stock on the MarketNIO stock is set to soar with strong fundamentals and an impressive product rangeBy Vandita Jadeja May 7, 2021, 9:29 am EDTThe Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China, Nio (NYSE:NIO) is making big moves this month. Having recently reported first quarter results, the company reported a new high in deliveries. NIO stock has shown volatility over the last few months. The stock was as high as $62 in Feb 2021 and declined to $35 in April 2021. As of close on Thursday, the stock was changing hands at $36.68. Needless to say, NIO is doing very well and it’s not stopping here. The company expects deliveries between 21,000 and 22,000 in the second quarter and total revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Considering the way NIO is growing, the deliveries and revenue seem achievable. That, of course, will lead to a rise in the EPS. All in all, NIO stock has long-term potential and outstanding fundamentals. The company will continue to impress investors in the coming years and the shares could easily cross $50 again."
"People in China want to drive Tesla, they just can’t admit it or their social credit score will go down just like this stock."
"in the next 5 years, NIO deliveries will by north of 2M annually, more than BMW, Audi, Lexus, Mercedes etc and then will sell more annually than Ford, GM and Daimler Chrysler shortly thereafter...so basically in 10-15 years they’ll have gone from a startup to one of the largest if not the ‘car’ company in the world....and most profitable I’m sure, but of course we know NIO is much much more than a car company which is the best part. This accomplishment is nothing short of astounding and beyond belief....and is exactly why the SP will be 400 by 2025/6 ! Easiest 10x bagger from today and biggest no brainer investment in history!"
"If anyone has spare time, go to the TSLA community on here, sort by oldest first, and you will see many people saying exactly the same things as people say here today, of course there's no guarantee the same thing will happen (with regard the share price), but it shows people have no idea what they are talking about generally. I like NIO, I like the cars, I will keep buying the dip and hold for years."
NIO is a ROCK strong among EVs. Buy and hold.
"I have been with NIO since October of 2018 and believe me there is nothing I haven't see. Price drop to low of $1.19, and millions negative posts about bankruptcy, delisting etc. Then the Blue Sky came and you know what happened. NIO is in much better shape than last year and the true long investors know that. Just a little cloudy now but the Blue Sky is behind those clouds. Patience is the key to achieve wealth."
NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS: THATS RIGHT. No news from Norway/Europe NIO launch is not a good sign for NIO stock price. The NIO car must not be doing well in Norway/Europe. Sure NIO will survive in China but if the NIO car is not sucessful outside of China then the NIO company might survive on China sales but the NIO stock price will just be another dodgy $30 chinese stock. Probably time to sell.
"NIO is the most undervalued stock in the EV space with 100,000 deliveries and $7 Billion cash in the bank.Anyone who thinks NIO is dead money over the summer better be ready to lose money.All NIO has to say is ET7 pre orders are off the charts or Apple is interested"
"I’m so confident NIO Will be over $100 a share next February, that I’ve told my closest family members about it. Also I bought my limit, I wanted to get a second mortgage on the house and buy more but my wife wouldn’t let me.￼￼Blue sky coming"

"Hmmm….let’s see.NIO is up 950% in the last year.We are in the middle of a global pandemic, millions dying…last one was 100 years ago.We are in the middle of the first global silicon chip shortage ever.We are in the middle of a massive disruption to ICE vehicles by EV. First massive disruption to ICE vehicles ever!China has massive EV infrastructure. We are seeing the first ever Chinese Auto Company producing top quality high tech vehicles.Chinese versus West politics in pretty poor state with technology bans, tariffs, human rights issues, pacific island etc etc etc.First time in a generation that USA face economic threat from overseas.And there are people whining and moaning about 2%-3% drop……..Get real. We are in globally uncharted Ed territories financially, economically, politically, medically, pandemically etc.No-one can predict what will happen on a day to day basis….markets are jumpy.Solution to all is go LONG.BUYHOLDSELL IN 2025BUY A FJORDGET STUNKIN’ RICH.MUTE THE MUTTS."
REALITY CHECKNEO IS THE MOST WATCHED YOUNG EV COMPANY IN THE WORLD
what happened to all that bashers they were posting yesterday evening and overnight here ??? anyone ??
"Anoyne know how to get access to Nio life products on Alibaba ? Can this only be done through the Nio app, or from China ? Or is there another way to see what's on there ?"
"Hang in there longs, nio will be profitable and be selling 350-500k units per year in the near future…..the sp will follow!"
Nio is eating Telsa's lunch in China and the Chinese Government LOVES IT.
Look for a takeoff to $35 Monday
NIO must start releasing EP7 preorder numbers on the monthly bases... it will creat a healthy buzz and help the SP growth organically
NIO needs to do everything it can to get into the US as fast as it can before the Dems get thrown out in 2024 and oil goes cheap again. Other risks might be other techs that make battery swapping pointless or outdated so I hope their tech is adaptable enough to make use of future tech.
"The company, backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent, has delivered over 100,000 cars since it was set up in 2014, almost all of them in China.The automaker's chief in Norway, Marius Hayler, said at an online event that Nio was building its first showroom outside China in Norway's capital city Oslo."
"Must admit painful to watch, short term this is killing us, long term will be great see you in 3 months guys holding 1250 shares"
Making money by shorting!!!! Back up the money truck!!!!
All is bout IF IF IF... what If NIO cant make it promise true? What if..? Have you ever thought about it?
"TO ALL HOLDERS IT’S important to know that we are still in the DOWN TREND , and not a reversal, the only difference it’s OVER BOUGHT !!!! I will consider to sell now before you can’t"
HUGE BOUNCE AT OPEN. We could see reversal into Green. OVERSOLD FOR NO REASON.
"CommonWere pulling back to November prices when this company is increasing sales,openning new markets?"
Well we'll well what we got here finally is the bitter truth about the overhyped way overpriced $TSLA vs the local high end EV brands in China.$TSLA $NIO $XPEV
"who do you believe? bailie and gifford, blackrock, vanguard, deutche bank, credit suisse, jp morgan..............................or bobbie off yahoo forums?"
Tidal wave of cash flooding into NIO now.
"Drop it under more so that we can get rid of the doubters and we get fresh investors Nio is the beat EV and lifestyle company out there and if you do not know this by now, then you do not belong hereUnless there is a major catastrophe this stock will not continue to drift lower because the smart ones know it’s intrinsic value"
So when do you swap your batteries? When it's super low? What if it takes 30% of battery to get to a charge station?
"Anyone care to guess when the last ""downgrade"" occurred for NIO where the analyst Downgraded the stock and REDUCED the price target?? GS nearly a year ago!"
"Q1's financials were solid, with NIO seeing +20.2% growth in revenues q/q with just +15.6% growth in deliveries, with higher ASPs on top of higher deliveries from sales network expansion and more product mix. Revenues from the 100kWh battery upgrade also were strong. Some of the strongest pieces of the report came through NIO's margin profile, aided by battery upgrades and NIO Pilot uptake. Higher deliveries and ASPs combined to push vehicle margin to 21.2%, up 400 bp q/q, the highest that NIO has seen and the highest between peers Li (LI) and XPeng (XPEV). Gross margin rose to 19.5%, a 230 bp increase from Q4, giving increased leverage down the line: gross profit rose 36.2%, operating loss shrunk 68.2%, and adjusted net loss shrunk 73.3%."
"for those that haven’t looked or noticed, close to 100M shares of NIO on average are traded every day, or 7% of the float. That would mean all shares are bought and sold every 2 weeks but since at least 50% are being held long the other 50% are turned over every single week. That is impossible in theory and would never happen except it clearly shows how man i pulated NIO is by and between MMs, but longs will always prevail with such an incredible company like NIO, always!"
something went wrong for ARK they were bashing NIO yesterday and probably thinking they can buy CHEAP shares then
Everyday more and more financial institutions are adding shares. Go on Fintel and check institutional ownership daily. This helps ease the fear for when it drops

"I will buy some puts tomorrow, I own enough long calls , need the hedge and swing trade it before we take off. Why mot get in on the dips. I am 200 % bullish, but am not blind, so tomorrow is a new day. GLTA"
"Nio and Tesla are the best stocks to invest in moving forward. Trading and shorting can put a great deal of pressure on these stocks especially Nio because of the fact that it is Chinese and has much lower market cap than Tesla. But, this pressure will eventually result in a pop. I am holding my stocks and have been adding over the last few weeks buy selling other stocks. GLTAL"
"NIO announced the recall after one of its ES8 vehicles emitted smoke in Shanghai last month, following one that burst into flame earlier this month in Wuhan and another similar incident in Xi’an in April."

"The Power Swap Station 2.0, according to Nio, boosts the service capacity of each station to a maximum 312 times per day by shortening the battery swapping time to under three minutes.The company announced a partnership with Chinese oil giant Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (NYSE: SHI) for setting up its power swap station at the latter's gas filling station."
"On February 4 this year, the Hefei Municipal Government and NIO signed a framework agreement to deepen cooperation, agreeing to jointly plan and build the park and turn it into a world-class intelligent electric vehicle industry cluster with a complete industrial chain.According to the agreement, Hefei will increase its support for the intelligent electric vehicle industry, introduce more high-quality enterprises in the industry chain to the park, and provide supporting policy support for enterprises in the park in terms of construction, funding and talents.In January, CnEVPost reported that the construction of NIO's second plant has entered the construction bidding stage, a month after a tender notice for clearing the land for the plant was issued."

NIO created a BATTERY SWAP business that may be worth more than its vehicle business as the EV industry adopts it as a standard
Low volume... same as yesterday... good thing?
Monday we open at $40
Strong Earnings and the price drops??? I'm not buying it. Hang lose and drink a few cocktails. Come back next month and all will be FINE.MAGA
JPM said that they parked their money in more mature businesses but increased their price target to $70 once chip shortages solved and inflation fear goes away NIO will break new records

"Not much to worry about with every other EV bleedingThe difference is NIO is fully funded and has 100k vehicles delivered, $7.2 Billion cash,with a 1000k car per year plant under construction ,, Oh they own China BATTERY CHARGING"
"1. NIO may be the only undervalued stock in the EV space with 100,000 deliveries and $7 Billion cash in the bank.2. NIO stands as one of the few EV Partners that Apple would even consider."
Why is this happening to my portfolio? I’m losing a ton of money very quickly
Bought more at $36. I'm looking forward to $60 a share prices at the end of this year.
Stop bashing and start buying if you want to make real moneyNIO is ready to return to a realistic price level over $40
NIO 7102 delivery in April. Again record. Nothing can stop NIO not even chip shorts. Beautiful week coming up. May 6 Thursday another conference about Europe invasions.See ya at 70$ soon enough
"from the Morgan Stanley research note dated yesterday morning 5/2""despite the tight production capped by chip shortate, demant looks healthy: order intake steadily recovered in March and April, with extra impetus from the promotion around the Shanghai Auto show. In adition, as mentioned in the earnings briefing, healthy demand could also give NIO greater operating flexibliity for more active promotion and marketing campaigns that could advance the take rate of NIO Pilot and 100 kwh battery packs. that would bode well for its long-term edge in autonomous driving and power solutions"""
It’s a Bear market
"NIO Is Expanding in the Red-Hot European MarketAfter EV sales more than doubled to 1.4 million in 2020, Europe is now one of the world’s largest EV markets, all thanks to tighter emission standards, and government subsidies. For 2021, Forbes’ contributor Neil Winton says electric vehicle sales could top a million again."

"The 60 Minutes interview with TSMC president, largest producer of semiconductor chips for Chinese EV companies, may weigh heavy on NIO‘s share price for the near future until NIO can convincingly demonstrate that the chip shortage will not affect it’s production capability."
Market going up againBuy before is to lateBargain bargain bargain
Changing the entire battery is like changing the gas tank every time you want to fill up. Why not change the whole car then? lol.

"Why NIO Stock Is Down TodayIt's not just Tesla, though that's part of it.￼John Rosevear(TMFMarlowe)May 13, 2021 at 2:13PMAuthor BioWhat happenedShares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) were trading lower on Thursday, after a Wall Street analyst said that the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors will continue to hold NIO's production down for a while longer.As of 1:30 p.m. EDT, NIO's American depositary shares were down about 7.5% from Wednesday's closing price.So whatCitibank analyst Jeff Chung, who recently hosted a call with NIO management, wrote on Thursday that the chip shortage has remained ""the key constraint"" for NIO's production in May. NIO, along with Ford Motor Company, BMW, and Honda Motor, has suffered from the effects of a February fire at Japanese chipmaker Renesas, which has reduced some auto suppliers' access to chips even further for the time being. According to Chung, NIO said that it felt the impact of the Renesas fire peaked in early May, and management now expects supplies to begin to improve in June or July. Chung maintained his previous hold rating on NIO's stock and his earlier price target of $57.60. ￼NIO BUILT ITS 100,000TH VEHICLE IN APRIL, BUT A CHIP SHORTAGE HAS SLOWED ITS PRODUCTION IN MAY. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.That's probably part of why NIO's stock was down on Thursday. Another factor is almost certainly the ongoing decline of electric-vehicle category leader Tesla, which seems to be pulling down other EV names for the time being. Now whatNot all the news was bad, though. Chung also noted that NIO said market demand has recovered well since the Lunar New Year holiday period in February, and that it's confident that the pace of new orders will continue to increase. While it's always hard to watch a growth stock lose ground in big moves day after day, I think that investors holding NIO can take some comfort from the longer-term story, which remains --"
"If this trend continues, I'll be Stuffing Tacos with PEDRO !!! "
"I’ve received email for NIO special meeting vote? Any idea, anyone???"
"In its recently released first-quarter 2021 earnings, the company reported deliveries of over 20,000 for the first time and is projecting deliveries of 21,000 to 22,000 vehicles in Q2 for revenue between $1.24 billon and $1.29 billion."
"People will see how oversold this is. Waiti till open, NIO will easily reclaim $32 imo... But obviously I could be wrong, no one knows."
Nio is soon to be profitable according to the ER report. Nio capacity will grow to 1.3m cars a year very soon cus of the Ev park they build with the government. We are looking here on the main EV player that will dominate China in its early stages. This is my best investment I'm sure I'll 10X my money from now if I just hold for few years. I suggest you all to stay strong we will make it people. Blue sky is coming!
Today (obviously) is risk-off. The market is in Gamma-Trade mode.

"$NIO continues to excel in China's fragmented EV market, performing well amidst the chip shortage spanning the overall automotive industry. Deliveries and production remain strong, and NIO's financial picture is improving dramatically at scale. Other key developments in play include Norwegian market entry, improvements to BaaS/swapping stations and services, and planned capacity expansion. While the chip shortages will remain the main dark cloud above shares for the near-term, long-term prospects remain positive."
"Good Luck to VW, GM and FCA when they have to show EV spending in earnings reports alongside ICE expenses."
"CATL has topped the global power battery shipments for four consecutive years, with customers including NIO, Tesla, XPeng Motors, Li Auto, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Volvo.In the first half of 2020, NIO became CATL's largest customer as its shipments continued to rise."

Thanks for this price lol I will add some shares to my 1500 shares I think :)
someone was selling 140K shares $34.00 ah and he finally sold it market price.. let's see if he made good decision tomorrow...
You can buy a share of NIO and a Little Caesars pizza with what Tesla lost today Smart money knows NIO will out perform every other EV stock in the next year Dont worry about what fast-money future Popeye's fry chefs think
The plan in Norway is actually much bigger and more creative than what I expected. Service idea is also good. Very interesting.
"""NIO started the year of 2021 with a new quarterly delivery record of 20,060 vehicles in the first quarter, representing a strong growth of 422.7% year over year,"" said William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO."
what is the president doing? the market is crashing so hard right now
Look for $35 plus on Monday as word gets out about NIO overtaking Tesla in China
"I looked at the balance sheet, I looked at the income statement, I looked at the chart. Than I asked my Magic 8 Ball if this stock is ready to rebound and it said ""All signs point to YES""!"
All the analysts were totally impressed by the 25 plus vehicles margin and they commented that it is unheard of for a relatively new company. Not even Tesla has that type of gross margin.
" The smart day traders sold in the $60, put $ aside for tax and buy back in the $30’s. Very smart investors buy and hold "
China EV market is huge. NIO is their premier company. BUY and HOLD and BUY MORE.DO NOT fall for Hedge Fear mongering.
One more trading day until tax deadline. Don’t be surprised to see big buying again
On the phone letting all the panic sellers know I’m buying more of this  sale !
Looks like nio looking to outpace the border market after lunch
NOW BUYING TIMEDon't wait for tomorrowHuge opportunity to buy cheap
I made a lot of money in Nio like no other stock in my life! Long for the next 5 years!!
The double whammy once again. Down in regular trading and down in AH's.Are we happy here?
"looking at the progress, once this inflation settled, our first stop could be above 80 (mostly by end of summer) !!"
Engineering classes will be taught on the failures of Nio and their decision making. It will be a great lesson for future EV makers
20% up side today?
Now who is smiling? The “panic sellers?” Or the “bag holders”? :)))

"NIO’s weak fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall F rating, which equates to Strong Sell in our POWR Ratings system.

"The long-term outlook on NIO stock is very favorable. The world is pivoting towards electric vehicles. China is at the forefront of this transition. NIO is the highest-quality and most technologically-advanced EV maker in China. Over the next several years, this company is going to produce and sell a lot of EVs, and generate tons of revenue and profits."
So whoever bought at -11% at pre market now he's got 15% profit? Should I start trading after hours?
Why NIo is doing soo well but its value on market is falling down soo hard? It's impossible for me to understand this . Any explanations?
"Analysts at Deutsche Bank reiterated their NIO stock price prediction of $70 per share on March 2 after the company's earnings report. They view the first-quarter guidance as “impressive” and raised their estimate for 2021 deliveries by 6,000 to 96,000, with the company on track to be a leader in the Chinese premium EV market.The Deutsche analysts said in a note to clients on the NIO outlook: “Longer term, we see several areas of untapped growth including developing a separate brand for the mid-tier/mass-market (potentially with partner), incremental volume in Europe (sales begin later this year and few investors give NIO any credit for success there), and recurring software subscription revenue from NAD (NIO Autonomous Driving) service.”“With ample capital exiting 2020, we believe the company can invest aggressively to expand its capacity/service network and improve its autonomous driving software/engineering capabilities. We reiterate our $70 price target, still based on 10x 2023E EV/Sales, and believe recent stock weakness is a buying opportunity.”"
NIO shares are trading higher after the company grabbed the largest market share in China's all-electric SUV market in April
"NIO BaaS and Battery Plan. Patents and deals with Sinopec, and Chinese Taxi monopolies are worth more than the market cap of FSR and CCIV ,, COMBINED"
NIO’s 1.3B shares are coiled to spring up. Most weak hands have been shaken out. Institutional investors are about to move back into growth stocks and NIO is at the top of their list. The economy is about to rockInflation is non existent. Lumber price is dropping. Chip shortage is ending. EV is at is infancy like the smart phone in 2005. Tesla = Blackberry and NIO = IPhone 
"We already know that NIO cars technology and service is superior to TSLA. But I haven't see any comparisons of the two CEO's. They both are visionaries both have a big dreams, but when it comes to Ethics Musk is in the bottom of the barrel. Promoting Dogecoin that we all know what kind of investment is to so many millions of people that most of them lost so much money already is morally a unexpectable. Feeling sorry for all those people that lost their life savings because of Musk."
"I have invested in these Chinese company stocks ($NIO, $XPNG, $QD, $XNET). All these are in the dump for the past 2 weeks."

OMG: LOOK AT NIO GOING UP IN AFTERMARKET. MY SHORT POSITION IS NOT LOOKING GOOD.
"Pre market is looking good, let's hope it sticks."
It’s funny how shorts come out when the stock is down and they hide when stock is up.
A potential stock but not a right time for growth
If in 10 mins it will not rise to day ... we will end up 3.5% down today ....

Green baby 900 viewers like Tesla this is amazing all the world is talking about our Nio we beat the revenue by +17% that's hugeee!!!!
All the stocks I watch that were up in the AM look the same as NIO today. The fact NIO didn't end up looking like the other EVs is significant.
"Team NIO: Monday, April 19th: Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today held a third press conference regarding the occurrence of a fire on March 19, 2021 at part of the processes in the N3 Building (300mm line) of Naka Factory (located in Hitachinaka, Ibaraki Prefecture) of Renesas Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd, a wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiary of Renesas. The press conference covered the latest outlook on production and shipment. The contents of the press conference are summarized below. Once again, we would like to give our sincerest apologies to neighboring residents, partner companies, relevant authorities and all those involved for the trouble. Overview of the press conference*Timeline for restarting production- As of 9:00 am April 17, 2021, production restarted at the N3 Building. As of April 17, 2021, our production capacity is just under 10% in comparison to the production capacity before the occurrence of the fire. We aim to recover the capacity to 30% by the end of this week, 50% by the end of April and return to 100% by the end of May.*Manufacturing and shipment statusIn regard to shipment of products manufactured in the N3 Building, we will gradually return to the shipment levels before the occurrence of the fire by starting the shipment of work-in-processes which was being produced at the time of the fire. Although this will depend on the product, following the lead time of a typical product, we stated at the March 30 press conference that we expect 100% recovery of product shipment of products manufactured in the N3 Building to customers approximately 100 days after the fire. At this current time, we expect there to be a delay of about 7 to 10 days from the approximately 100 days after the fire for 100% recovery of product shipment. On the other hand, the effect of alternative production is expected to come sooner than initially anticipated, and the amount is larger than expected, contributing to the production.Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-notice-regarding-semiconductor-manufacturing-162500878.htmlSuper Long NIO!"

"NIO has more back orders than FSR, CCIV and GOEV have sales ...COMBINEDFSR, first car is two years away, Ditto CCIV (lucid) NIO already delivered 100K and operates in the worlds largest market with the best tech and 233 showrooms plus BATTERY SWAP"
37m traded? Extremely low volume. I think people are scared lol
"Predicting one major day this week After 23 years trading, I never seen a coiled spring like NIO By the way, most of the bashers here daily are working for VW and hold no shares"
Looks like market is crashing. Get ready for a wild ride.
"China or not, the ICE-to-EV transition is in full swing and for the early NIO longs, beating 95% of the big inv houses to the punch, feels good! Remember, competition is healthy, think Apple had no competition? Sensitive to market trends and rising innovation demand, Apple introduced great products (Creating and leading new trends) with solid CEO, they ate everyone's lunch. NIO is most certainly entering a growth phase with a solid base of patents and revenue STREAM$ with the kind of speed that not even the largest investment houses can quantify with any reasonable accuracy... Long play is the only way !"
Chart spells doom for sell side
"I would like to know what pre orders are for ET7 and Norway's pre orders. You know that it is beyond expectations. Something no one is talking about yet.Borges bank, the national bank of Norway purchased 13.4 million NIO shares in final quarter of 2020.Don't be fooled by the shorts. This is a real of growth as you ll find. We will be rewarded!!!!"
So today we need a green day. No big ups downs just steady day would be nice
I actually love this action. NIO competitors with no cars to sell are getting wiped out. NIO will be announcing first quarter gains of 400% plus in ten days after it takes the gold in Shanghai
"ONLY I prognosed last year, that $Nio will kill $Tsla in China and it's happening, in lightspeed. Sell your Far$Tsla stocks as soon as you can and enter the true future multi trillion dollar company $NIO"
"The 40 or 50 even 60 we will see this year, I have every confidence. My only regret is that I can't buy now, but bought a few weeks back."
Buy and hold  we all knew $NIO is a long term investment ;)
"Its getting very expensive for hedge funds to keep dumping $60 shares for $38 and the end is approaching.Man does this remind me of the mood a year ago. NIO is in a position right now to make a lot of people a ton of money,"
I haven't been here in a while...
Bloomberg - Nio will be the first EV builder to breakout in a big wayAvoid SPAC players
"$NIO's vehicle sales rose by almost 500% compared to the prior-year period, and by 20% compared to Q4 2020. But like many automakers around the world, it has been hit by the global semiconductor shortage. Management says the scarcity of automotive chips will hinder its ability to further ramp up production in the coming months.I am really glad that I found https://dailytrading.tools/hlvedh They have the best technology to find stocks and manage the trades"
They delivered great earnings and accelerating growth
"Everyone, chill out. Just start typing random symbols into the search bar. The entire market tanked today. This isn't about one stock."
"First Validation Build Of Nio's ET7 EV Sedan Rolls Off Assembly Line5/18/21, 1:52 PMMay 18, 2021 02:52 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsNio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO) provided an update Tuesday on its first-ever EV sedan, which it plans to commercially launch in the first quarter of 2022.What Happened: Nio said the first validation build of its ET7 sedan has rolled off the production line. The ET7 is Nio's first sedan model and fourth vehicle model. It was officially launched at the annual Nio Day event in early January.Validation builds are vehicles used for testing engineering design and production line processes. Much of the work on the vehicle — including the interior, exterior, electronic system, chassis and battery — are completed at this stage."
I would like to buy more but I think I will wait to see where all EV stock goes by Friday
"Xpeng (xpev) beat Q1 estimates and sees a steeper sequential gain in deliveries this quarter despite the global chip shortage.Speaks well for NIO but chip shortage has made NIo pull back on guidance while xpeng says it is doing well despite the shortage, interesting!"
I’m holding 35 calls for next Friday? Worth holding? I’ve literally lost all of my money these past few weeks.
This is promising like the old days
"NIO unstoppable, NIO builds joint lab with one of China's best universitiesPhate ZhangMay 2, 2021NIO builds joint lab with one of China's best universities-CnEVPostChinese electric vehicle company NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on April 30 to cooperate in technology research and talent training.As part of the agreement, the two will establish the USTC-NIO Smart Electric Vehicle Joint Laboratory to conduct joint research on cutting-edge scientific issues, major scientific and technological issues and strategic new technologies, according to a statement by NIO.The two will also use the lab to jointly apply for and undertake major national and local research projects to promote innovation in high-end technologies.USTC's research strength in China is almost comparable to that of Tsinghua University and Peking University. The university is located in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is also home to NIO China's headquarters and the JAC NIO facility. Under the agreement, NIO will provide resources and a platform to serve as an educational internship base for USTC, which in turn will support the establishment of a postdoctoral workstation at the joint lab.NIO says it hopes to train and deliver globally-oriented high-end talents for the smart electric vehicle industry and is committed to keeping more outstanding young talents in Hefei."
Can nio flirt with 38 today
markets down but NIO up. because NIO will win the day
Look up thermal events. I’m sure China has had one or two but refuses to release the data.
This is the bottom everyone was waiting for
"""We need to find a pragmatic solution, but from a business point of view, there's a point separating the battery from the car."" CEO Luca de Meo, Renault. SA..google Seeking Alpla. they posted about this"
STRONG SELL IF YOU BOUGHT AT 32.8$ time to go out
"The last year plus, Nio hasn't had any negative fundamental changes.Nio is on target to the plan, and only has added value during that period.A Long Hold is justified."
"With terrible margins, a cash bailout, spin-offs and more layoffs in a Chinese electric car market that’s slumping, Nio’s future doesn’t exactly inspire confidence."
38¢ a day is fine with me. that would put us at around $80 by Xmas
"Today I got my ET7. I love that car. 23 speaker, 150 kWh battery. I purchased the autonomous driving too."

Anyone know how we should vote on the share holder’s proxy vote???
This FUNNY chianese STOCK run by CONFUSE ASAIN whom have SOY MSG hangover from to MUCH frie rie for LUNCH
"The ""Big Guy"" in Washington has not removed the 25% tariffs on imported Chinese electric vehicles imposed under former President Trump. This would need to happen if NIO is to expand to the US. But, Washington is watching what happens to Tesla in China at the moment, so nothing is going to happen. If China Halts Tesla, we can forget about NIO coming to the US. World would better off if US and China can come to terms with each other, which seems unlikely any time soon."
"The only reason Wall Street has walked the EV sector down is because they missed the last ride up. Its getting very expensive for hedge funds to keep dumping $60 shares for $38 and the end is approaching. Man does this remind me of the mood a year ago. NIO is in a position right now to make a lot of people a ton of money,"
Good Q2 numbers will take us to 45 plus...
35$ today ?
Good morning to all true NIO bulls all over the world. Blue Sky is coming again.
"Geely, one of the biggest car seller group, is also joining Battery swap technology. Because Chinese gov. enforces this strategy. They develope a national standard. This is pushing Tesla from the Chinese market because incompatible. Overall Chinese Ev registration is higher than ever."
NIO
Big upswing tomorrow!
"NIO will trade at $120 the day the first ET7 comes off the lineNIO will see $170 a share in 2021 ,,, take that to the bank"
"ladies and gents, if Goldman is doubling here from 10M shares to 20M shares... you can ask yourself if GS trading desk will be wrong here ??any thoughts ??"

"2 months ago nio was $35.21, the longer it trades flat the bigger the breakout will be"
"Amazingly, Nio is leading market up! Not TSLA ."
"In my opinion the most important of NIO in the Shanghai auto show 2021 was, how NIO has presented it superior EV technology and designs autos with leading Revolutionary EP7 to the Hong Kong exchange investments fun￼ds in Asia! China EV auto makers with NIO emerging as leader among them, finally putting China in both the global future auto industry and the Asian inventors market... a huge achievement for NIO. - we may see NIO SP surging just as acknowledgement by that market. It’s truly an exciting time for NIO and their investors."
NIO has more internationals awards for innovation than FSR and CCIV have cars TRUTH
This is the worst stock in the whole stock market with no gains in 7 months
"The Ransomware Attack on the largest US pipeline creating uncertainty in the markets, throw in inflation, covid variants then we will see some term volatility. Nothing has changed fundamentally with NIO as company however. Theres actually speculation NIO is about to do something involing crypto."
"$120 in 2021 is now conservative Before you trade, be sure to look at the other vehicles on display in Shanghai. Compared to almost any car there, I bet you would want to own the NIO."
"If you are holding long term, like 3 to 5 years and beyond, why would you freak out over the sp today? We all know NIO is a superb investment and will dominate the premium luxury sector and will eventually introduce utilitarian models which will translate into a triple digit sp. so don;t wring your hands over every fluctuation, the thieves will always be with us but at some point the machinations and manipulations will stop as market forces overwhelm them"
NIO has a chance to close GREEN on weekly first time in 5 weeks..let's do this. it must start somewhere...
Chart says new launch point forming
"thee most beautiful chart! 3 mo, 6mo, 12 mo... pure bull"
Its just a matter of time !This stock is going to explode.
The feeling is like when I bought Alibaba at $30 and sold at $300. This feeling comes back again... Great Feeling
Remember when I said NIO will follow similarly to Honda and Japan? Well now Sandy Munro and stockmoe agree and are saying the exact same thing I've said for a long time about NIO.So all the shorts can be NIO janitors once they open a factory in America and EU.
Big news this morning is that Tesla Shanghai plant exported most of its vehicles. They are losing market share to NIO.
"You cant discount the cash value inside the stock value. From 50 billion capitalization 7 billion is cash, do you believe the other all is fat ? no innovation, sales, a good name, a big market, ok you have make your choices. The stock is powerfull. NIO we believe."
This is what happens when you elect someone for there personality instead of there policy
back to 31s...yawn
The death cross is coming. I’m very bullish on Nio long term but everyone be careful here and protect your capital. There is a reason they say SELL IN MAY AND GO AWAY
"TSLA is still the leader of this sector. Understanding that will give you some perspective. TSLA, for now, will be the 1st choice for investors re-entering this sector. Its stock price has started to turn around over the past 2 weeks. NIO and other solid companies in this sector will soon follow suit as the momentum players return and look for less expensive options. Once NIO shows results of the amazing innovations and partnerships they have built over the past year their momentum will only escalate. Be patient."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
NIO is a $60 Stock trading at half price $120 Dec
The big institutions are buying back now. They kept NIO price down several days.
"America will own the business for EV. And as a consequence GM, Ford and Tesla will Rule North America.Tesla will most likely be the leader in China as well, so long as Musk remembers which cheek to kiss. NIO is poised to be the strong number 2 Player in China and perhaps Scandinavia. The only two stocks that will prevail as growth entities will Be TSLA and NIO. I believe NIO as a stock can and probably will be the growth leader over the next decade if they can execute. If the Chinese Government was not so totalitarian NIO would be sold in the US as well which would cement the stock growth. The real problem is for all EV Makers is raw materials. I believe that puts GM and F back in the picture but NIO will compete in any scenario if they do not screw up this opportunity again. TSLA has survived some very decisions because there was no competition. The game is different today. I still vote NIO as a long term player with a strong stock performance."
another million share purchase thats not retail
"Fridays numbers are already in view 400 sales gain Analysts will be wanting to know ET7 pre orders, chip outlook and factory construction info This news we believe will propel NIO to Jan highs and the $62 range for summer"
If we hold $33.00 we will be taking off just like $XPEV & Li Auto
You know what I find especially funny. Can you all remember all the Blue Sky talk with NIO was in the 50's then more in the 60's. Looks like the rookies who didn't know anything else to post except what they DavidNio say are now a club grabing their ankles wondering who it got stuck so deep.
These Shorts are paid posters. Paid to lie so investors can rob your shares cheap.

"we will call this ""the big dipper"".. 1 year later this will be just a small bump in the road. cheers longs."
welcome to the Nio board buy an hold for the long haul this is an incredible company
Kudos to DavidNIO’s bosses who decided to just have me keep $87K because they want to sell their shares for $70 in 7 days instead of $32.50 and definitely not $26. I love you all!
Finally it’s got it’s own movement and not copying Tesla and Nasdaq
"Yesterday finally was a day NIO went up and TSLA went down. Finally and hopefully investors start to realise that NIO is the big deal in the largest potential EV market. Also new rules in Europe, excluding petrol cars in a rapid way, will blast NIO sales. I hold my 4.000 pieces for at least 3 to 5 years. SP : >350 !"
"EV market enjoy very high valuation. For example $NIO which sell <100K cars valued at $60B+, $TSLA with 600K/year car has $750B+ (When you include options and convertible) $XPEV is $30B and list can go on.I understand currently no big boy give dam about EVTOL companies like $RTP, $QELL ,$ACIC, $ATLU, $EHIt's actually good thing for any long term believer in EVTOL because once sector get highlight this stock won't available even for 3 time where they are today. I don't care what market really think.But we know EV market getting flooded by every auto maker and those valuation EV only company enjoyingwill soon go other-way if they don't find way to diversify their revenue stream.EVTOL share many technology with EV and EVTOL is logical way to diversify. Now while it logical, it's entire different when come to making them. Best way to get into and take leadership is buyout existing player with proven product.Now for company like Tesla is pocket change to spend few billions to buyout and if they don't act fast those few billions might change to few 10's billions and some point EV maker stuggling and EVTOL might buy them out. So window of oppturnity for them is slim.It's funny people give top dollar for outdated EV technology and afraid to value company like Joby Aviation at $4.5B (when remove cash part). And so either EV valuation will drop or EVTOL catch up on valuation."
we have a short term double bottom here at $30.60.. first time premarket and another time during the regular trading hours.let's see if NIO can go higher than $35 now..
"NIO's vehicle margin was 21.2% in the first quarter, compared with a negative 7.4% in the same period last year."
Without a mass market car this company will be lost They can’t survive with only luxury cars
"Question - how many shorts woke up this morning thinking today was the day and talking about how great their predictions were and how many thumbs down to only see this stock roar back and go up within minutes, then thinking it would go back down and shorting more or buying puts, only to watch it creep higher and stay higher all day? Classic bear trap- also a telling sign that we are bottoming."
" Cathie Wood; The Chinese Government has announced an EV subsidy for vehicles priced at $45,700 or less for all manufacturers except those offering battery swapping. Electric vehicles incorporating battery swapping will be exempt from the price limit. This policy favors domestic battery-swapping EV manufacturers like NIO as opposed to Tesla which avoided that strategy."
Can today be NIO's day to make that 10% jump too haha
Finally I am Having a good day!! $Fubo is killing it!! so is $NIO and $CLOV!! FUBO to $40.88 Soon!!
Final day to file taxes. Buy/accumulate in case big buys start coming into stocks tomorrow
"NIO had a very similar pattern to the Nasdaq today, just flowing along. Wonder when it'll pop with all this good news"
Why would Nio be delisted?First of all this company has a base of operation in USA as well as Europe. I don't understand why you guys are freaking out over nothing.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said that tackling the chip shortage remained its top priority.
"come on NIO release earnings, checking the bloomberg every 2 minutes"
At these prices we will shake weak hands and institutions will pile in! Don't be concerned about the price unless you plan to buy more. This stock is a long term winner. See you boys at the top of the mountain in 2030. Don't forget how large the EV market will be.. Rome wasn't built in a day!
"A six week assault on NIO retail longs has been a boon to day traders and a total money waste of time and money to hedge funds trying to scare off retail longs Retail longs still own 51% of NIO ,, thats a fact and a fact that is unlikely to change until Wall Street is ready to pay what they are worth .. see ya at $60++ ... laugh all you want. we got the shares and you dont"
why is NIO under performing other EV sticks including Xpev lately???
Red pre is green eod
Buy today moreThe sale price will be over tomorrow
All 800 institutional investors with 1.5 billion shares can’t all be wrong picking NIO to invest in.
NIO - Load and Long! It is a potential growing company with great track record.
One good thing we take from this week! Change of sentiment for all EV plays! Lets hope for continuation next week! Have good weekend longs
"NIO (NYSE: NIO) to Tap Another Monetization Avenue as Ford (NYSE: F) Opens Up Its EVs to the Chinese Company’s Charging InfrastructureBy Rohail SaleemApr 13, 2021 11:06 EDT SHARE TWEET SUBMITNIONIO (NYSE:NIO 38.18 2.80%), one of the leading manufacturers of electric cars in China, appears to be on a roll lately. Coming on the heels of a major partnership with China’s largest network of gasoline stations, NIO has now secured another monetization avenue for its charging network via Ford (NYSE:F 12.165 -1.74%).To wit, while opening the reservations for its Mustang Mach-E in China, Ford has also announced a sweeping partnership with NIO:It’s Official Now: NIO and Sinopec’s Strategic Partnership To Go Live on the 15th of April“Ford will also work closely with charging partners such as the State Grid. Mustang Mach-E users can access over 300,000 high-quality public charging piles, of which 160,000 are fast charging, in more than 340 cities across the country through an exclusive APP. NIO’s nationwide fast-charging network will also be accessible to Mustang Mach-E users.”As stated earlier, NIO is set to formalize its strategic partnership with Sinopec on the 15th of April. The arrangement would facilitate the deployment of second-generation battery swap stations across Sinopec’s vast network of gasoline stations. This, in turn, would allow NIO to lock in a substantial number of existing and future customers to its ecosystem, thereby creating a monopoly of sorts in the largest market for electric vehicles. As a refresher, NIO’s Battery Swap 2.0 stations can perform 312 automated battery swaps per day, with each swap taking place in under 3 minutes. The company plans to build at least 500 such stations across China in 2021.Of course, given the proprietary tech involved in utilizing battery swap stations, Ford is unlikely to tap into this growing network. Nonetheless, NIO does offer its customers a variety of charging solutions. These include a dedicated home charging solution, called the Power Home, and a mobile charging solution, called the Power Mobile, whereby an EV may be charged through a fleet of charging trucks. Moreover, the Power Express is a 24-hour facility available on-demand to NIO customers whereby EVs are picked up, charged, and then dropped off at a pre-chosen spot. Finally, NIO customers can also access China’s network of over 300,000 charging stations.In a bid to make its EVs more affordable, NIO allows users to buy its electric cars while renting batteries under the ambit of its Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) facility. For a fixed monthly payment – $141 per month for the 70 kWh battery pack – users can slash over $10,000 off the retail price of NIO’s EV models."
"A statement from the General Manager of NIO Norway. ""Hello, NIO users and friends, I am very happy to meet you. I am Marius Hayler, the general manager of NIO Norway. I am very happy to announce with you today that NIO’s first step in the overseas market-Norwegian strategy The press conference will be broadcast live simultaneously in Norway and China at 16:00 on May 6, Beijing time.As a new member who just joined the NIO family, I have learned so many stories about NIO and the community over the past period of time, and I am deeply attracted by it. I believe that in the near future, I will also become a good friend of everyone. My team and I are also planning a trip to China in the near future, and hope to meet you soon."
"NIO has ""kicked off the planning and building of a new plant in Xinqiao Industrial Park in Hefei"" as part of NeoPark, a 16,950 acre industry park that will become home to multiple companies, 10,000 R&D workers, 40,000 technical workers, and a total capacity among all occupants of 1 million vehicles annually. NIO is a major partner, with an RMB10 billion investment to build NeoPark."
"Longs with vision have known for over a year now that Nio will eventually overtake Tesla in China, if not other countries as well. Keep buying, holding and be patient. You can be rich."
"Guys, I have been a #NIO investor since August 2020 and made 70K profit. What I see happening right now is everyone is selling their positions and buying #AMC for the squeeze. I think you should do the same before #AMC squeeze starts. Then, we can come back to #NIO and ride it back up."
"Folks, if you’re truly long and meet the income requirements, I highly suggest adding to a Roth IRA as well as a brokerage account. I keep seeing individuals saying “If you invested in Microsoft or Amazon at IPO, etc... it would be worth X today” Well, if you believe, like I do, that Nio will dominate, throw shares into a Roth to enjoy tax free gains come that 59.5 year old requirement. 10, 20, and 30 years will come in 10, 20, and 30 years time regardless of what you do. Might as well set yourself up for success."
Alert for all shorts. Marco.... the poet is preparing a ponzie skim. You will eat BK burgers for free and then he will make sure you lose all your money....lol

Last chance to buy more sharesNext week monday the price will start from 35-34$+Buy cheap today
NIO will sell out every ET7 it makes for the first two years. NIO will have a half million units delivered before Lucid or Fisker get one dozen built in 2023
"Going to be a lot of Tesla holders moving to NIO shares NIO is going to double from todays close .., Tesla will not"
$38 this week .. ?
Why NIO Stock Is Up Today - NIO is a company well fit for the new economy.
Never been so terrified of good news in my life. Legitimately considering closing all stock apps for a few months
"For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough."
Lot of negative comments about NIO in this forum. NIO is a unique EV company with the BAAS plan. Also NIO launched in Europe. Upside is on the way. My speculation is that we have to be patient. This is a long term.
"NIO has $7 Billion in cash ,, more than the market cap of FSR or CCIV NIO has 21% margins and is building a factory 12 times the size of Tesla NIO has won five high level tech awards ,, from JD Powers to Fast Company"
Gas prices going up up up  It would be super nice to have a battery swapping EV right about now 
Remember.nio is a great company with a unique productAlso norway+Neopark+new car models will take nio up
"All eyes on GM's ER pre-open tomorrow morning. If they say anything remotely positive about chip situation, the entire auto sector will pop."
You can hear them literally beg you to sell your shares. Lol
I didn't think it would do it today but...here comes the $31's? Bid now $32.18. It's been all selling all the time. The bid just ain't being allowed to recover. Not yet....
To the 40s next week . I think bearishness is done
"I am WILLING to go down with the ship (Highly doubt that ship is sinking). I will not look into selling a single share of this company in the next 5 years. NIO is only getting bigger and the pathway that they have paved for themselves is remarkable. As someone with a $40 average, these current prices are a STEAL. I saw green 2 weeks ago and still didn’t sell. I am an “investor” not a day trader."
So much talk about Cathie Woods thinking about buying NIO. The price continues to climb daily. What is she waiting for?
"Elon Musk, meanwhile, figured out that a network of superchargers would be a whole lot cheaper than building a nationwide chain of expensive battery swapping stations at US$3 million a bay. The idea of battery exchanges fell off the electric vehicle roadmap, found only in the darkest regions of the most idealistic — that should be read impractical — of Reddit comment chains."
Just saw on NIO’s official Instagram page that NIO will host a conference on May 6th to launch their European expansion initiatives.
"By the time CCIV and FSR get a dozen cars built in 2023. NIO will deliver 800,000 vehicles And you can say you passed or day traded it at $33 like a fkkingIDIOT"
"Yup, let’s all pretend NIO isn’t one of thee most cutting edge companies in one of the biggest economies in the world. The writing is on the wall for ICE and NIO is playing the game of chess to absolute perfection. Just wait until NEO Park is churning out millions of advanced EVs and BaaS is printing money."
Green in after hours and green in pre market and green in trading hours

"Stock Moe every day for the past 3 months - ""I just had to add some more Nio to my portfolio today during this dip"" "
CCIV has already lost 1000% off its highs NIO millionaires circle the globe
"The news that the Chinese government is supporting battering swap technology, I can see how this helps NIO, but it also encourages competitors to adopt the battery swap tech too, which doesn't bode well for NIO in the long run. Tell me if I am wrong. I'm a NIO long, but I want to have an open mind."
I want to ask you a question and I hope you answer me seriously: Nio has 1.5B outstanding shares. How can you imagine it at $ 200 a share since it would have a market cap of more than 400 billion? In my opinion it cannot go beyond 80 unless a share buyback takes place.
$69 stock
"2nd generation Battery Swap Stations are fully automatic (driver doesn’t have to exit vehicle) and it costs $230 k per station according to media report. If the battery has a thermal runaway, it will cost a lot in damage, PR Disaster - not to mention how much maintenance and insurance will be."
Looks like traders are waking up to the difference investing in businesses instead of risky bitcoin Ponzi schemes
I believe in this company and I know that everyone believe in NIO after one or two years so many people will become millionaire very soon $500 a share
ouch i in @41 i believe in this company but i can see it down to 20 before up above my buy point.let see what happend.
"Be in before the Power Hour ,, NIO should be trading in the 50's on fundamentals"
BOTTOM LINE: NO NIO CARS ON USA SOIL = LIMITED INVESTOR INTEREST = STAGNANT STOCK PRICE FOR NIO.
Nio has been a speculative stock for so long.It has been overvalued for so long.However now our sales and our progress are revealing themselves.Nio is not an overvalued stock anymore it is a solid stock
"Earlier this year, Nio (NIO) stock touched a high of $66.90. Since that time, valuation concerns, coupled with a semiconductor shortage, have resulted in a steep correction. However, it seems that the worst might be over for Nio stock"
This stock is gonna fly. Takeoff could begin as soon as this week. Great buying opportunity at these prices.https://www.facebook.com/groups/3540893589258580/
Nio down half from highs and this is not the end of it. Why buy 50 percent off when you can sell now and buy at 75 percent off?
SEC Rule 801 is in effect tomorrow so...cover time like hammer time. Sorry NOT sorry retail shorts. Good luck with your margin accounts. 
NIO shares are trading higher by 6.4% at $33.22 Friday after the company grabbed the largest market share in China's all-electric SUV market in April.
Anyone going to sell or hold?
"NIO is not down because of bad news ,,, Its pinned down trying to shake retail off. Support is over $36 - If NIO cracks $43 its going to $48"
"Still down 55% from all time high , it’s too cheap now, HodL"
"Thank God I hold a stock that will trade at $120 by Jan ,, instead of a SPAC or Crypto"
will break soon. forming a W shape
Where’s the Reddit crowd when you need them
Went on a Tesla Model Y road trip this weekend from Sacramento to Las Vegas. Went there to ride road bikes. 3 guys with bikes. 2 bikes mounted on a bike hitch. We charged 4 times each way. Comfortable ride good times. If i ever go EV I'll probably wait for battery swap technology. Go Nio. Holding 5k long and strong.

"NIO is not affected by US inflation or bond yieldsNIOS are Chinese products sold in China. NIO has 78% upside, so keep fooling yourselves"
"This would have been a very strong result with no chip shortage and no pandemic. In light of the circumstances my confidence in management has been reinforced. There is clearly extremely strong support from multiple levels of the Chinese governments. You combine the excellent leading product, the battery swap, and their structural advantages in China with clearly solid management and I see massive upside here. Strong buy, EOY target $68. Good luck investors."

I just checked out the Tesla board no bullishness on Tesla bearish remarks not many new comments . I think even Elon seems bearish on Tesla that's why he is promoting cryptocurrency William le and Nio to the moon the momentum is shifting I am excited

"NIO is in the process of 'earning' its valuation. We're basically at the 'Show Me' stage of development. Lotta talk, but also a lot of headwinds. They're delivering on expectations, no doubt, more than that even, exceeding, but big plans take time, and NIO's business model requires a lot things to be grown and cultivated at the same time."

"People outside China underestimate how familiar Chinese people across all classes are with electric mobility. When I first moved to China ten years ago, people were whizzing around on led battery scooters. Now its lithium, with petrol bikes banned in cities. Many public busses in Beijing connect to over head electric cables like trams. Light years ahead. Just looks a bit old school because it's China, but don't be fooled. My point is the basis for major electric mobility take off are already in place. Europe can follow. US will need a decade to consolidate any comparable infrastructure within the context of free market federalism."

Battery Swap is the reason NIO is only going up from here Bloomberg says its worth more than several EV startups combined
"Renault makes a key EV decision: To battery swap or notMay 12, 2021 2:12 AM ETRenault SA (RNSDF)By: Yoel Minkoff, SA News Editor68 Comments As it looks to deepen its presence in the electric car market, Renault (OTC:RNSDF) is considering introducing battery-swapping capabilities, which would significantly cut waiting times at recharging stations. ""It's not decided, but I see it as an interesting opportunity,"" CEO Luca de Meo told the FT. ""We need to find a pragmatic solution, but from a business point of view, there's a point separating the battery from the car."" The French automaker is part of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, which is one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world and a leader in EVs (think the pioneering Leaf and best-selling Zoe). Backdrop: Interestingly enough, Renault was once a trailblazer in battery swapping technology for electric vehicles. Starting in 2010, the carmaker became the primary partner for Better Place, an Israeli startup that hoped to revolutionize the e-mobility industry. The company initially set up shop in Israel, Denmark and Hawaii, but was plagued by financial difficulties and mismanagement, and eventually went bankrupt in 2013. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also began conducting its own battery swapping trials in 2013, but it dropped the project a few years later as consumers increasingly expressed interest in its Supercharger network. While the process seems simple, making a business out of swapping is a bit complicated. Batteries are the single most expensive component in any EV, but they're still in a rapid stage of development and manufacturers have been reluctant to standardize anything. In fact, at Tesla's Battery Day event last September, the EV maker said it plans to integrate batteries into structural elements of future cars, comparing them to the fuel tanks located within the wings of an airplane. Enter NIO: The Chinese EV maker just recorded a milestone of 2M battery swaps to date and plans to double its Chinese network to more than 500 stations in 2021. Each NIO (NYSE:NIO) battery swap takes only a few minutes (and comes with a full charge), compared to the 35 minutes it takes a Supercharger to load a Tesla battery from 10% to 80% (it's even slower at home). Besides quicker turnaround times, battery swapping technology also allows EV makers to decouple the cost of batteries from their vehicles, meaning drivers aren't worried about depreciating battery capacity or the value of their cars."
Why worry about short term this is getting ready for years of dominance
"NIO's 5 year lead in the development of high end EV technology is unmatched anywhere, 100,000 deliveries, $7.3 Billion cash, 21% margins You cant do better than that, anywhere. $33 is free money and a 10 banger"
"If NIO cornered 23% of the EV market in China for April 2021 with limited production because of chip shortage, what will the percentage be when the chip shortage is resolved and we are building 12,000 a month in a few months and 20,000 a month next year?The future is brighter than you think."

"(Bloomberg) -- As the semiconductor shortage hobbling the global automotive industry has worsened, its cost as a hit to sales has almost doubled to $110 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $61 billion.That’s the latest assessment of AlixPartners, a global consulting firm closely monitoring the widening crisis. It also now says the world’s carmakers will lose 3.9 million vehicles of production to the chip shortage this year, more than its prediction four months ago of 2.2 million. That’s about 4.6% of the 84.6 million vehicles that AlixPartners had projected in total production for 2021.Automakers issued warnings in earnings reports in recent weeks that the chip shortage would get worse before it gets better. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. each predicted the second quarter would be the worst of the calamity, as they are forced to idle factories for lack of the essential components. But the industry isn’t likely to see signs of recovery until the end of the year, according to the AlixPartners assessment.“It’s still deeply impacting the third quarter,” Mark Wakefield, head of the firm’s global automotive practice, said in an interview. “We don’t really have it getting into a recovery mode at all until the fourth quarter.”The timing takes on added importance because the chip-related production cuts are driving up prices of new and used vehicles, contributing to higher inflation in the U.S. Another researcher, LMC Automotive, predicts global production will be cut by almost 3 million vehicles in the year’s first half alone.Read More: Record Surge in Used-Car Prices Is Key Culprit in InflationFord Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said Thursday the company is redesigning its vehicles to use the most common and “accessible” chips. It also is planning to boost semiconductor inventory and sign contracts directly with chipmakers, rather than go through an auto supplier.“We really see the second half improving,” Farley said at Ford’s annual shareholders meeting. “We’re starting to get more confidence in the chip supply.”The crisis that grew out of pandemic-related production cuts has been exacerbated by a fire at semiconductor factory in Japan and this winter’s historic cold snap in Texas that curtailed output.“There are up to 1,400 chips in a typical vehicle today, and that number is only going to increase,” said Dan Hearsch, managing director of AlixPartners’ automotive practice. “The top priority for companies right now is mitigating the best they can the short-term effects of this disruption, which may include everything from renegotiating contracts to managing the expectations of lenders and investors.”Supply ChainAlixPartners, which helped guide GM through bankruptcy more than a decade ago, estimated in January that the chip shortage would cost the auto industry $61 billion in lost revenue. As the crisis has worsened, the firm has begun working with automakers to overhaul supply-chain management to try to avoid this happening again.The first lesson automakers are learning, Wakefield said, is they are no longer “the 800-pound gorilla” in supplier relations, especially with chipmakers who also serve tech giants that pay higher prices for more advanced semiconductors for mobile phones, laptops and video games. Suppliers like that can’t be strong-armed into dancing to Detroit’s tune.Automakers are now in a situation “where they’re eye-to-eye and not the big dog on the street,” Wakefield said. “Reducing costs has been a priority at automakers. It’s great to save money, but not if you can’t build cars.”"
it's even funny if you can see all these high-flying stocks from 2020 are opening -8-10% this morning.. this is definitely well planned.. margin calls in progress

Market is rigged in full. Pre and after hours should be closed to stop rigging. This pre and after is not serving good for the market. For few of course.
Wouldn't it make since for Apple/NIO partnership? Apple has such a strong presence in China and could help with bringing NIO to the states. Apple would seem to have such a competitive advantage if they use their iPhone capabilities to their benefit with the efficiency of their technology inside there car. This seems like it could either hurt all NIO competitors due to the number of people who own iPhones or would help Apple sell more iPhones.

"Nio will do great in EU. I don't think Americans care if a great product is from China. But it's smart for NIO to perform well in EU and then to America. It really makes sense given the climate of things currently. So expansion to the U.S should be done imo 2-3 years from now. If another left leaning president wins, I would say it's a win for foreign relations.Xpeng sales show that people in EU will buy a good product. I really don't think Americans are as patriotic to there country as the media likes to perpetuate. People still bought Huawei and will continue to buy Chinese products. But if it matters that much. Gaining EU confidence is a good step."

The stock has recently bounced off its 200-day moving average and broke above the 21-day moving average, which Zhang sees as a bullish sign and the sign of the end of the downtrend."

Tesla’s sequential sales dip in April was significantly more than its closest rivals in China BYD Co Ltd’s (OTC: BYDDF) and Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) which showed a drop of 1% to 2% in sales when compared with March numbers.
"“UBS forecasts electric car sales will reach 6.6 million in 2025 and 18 million by 2030.”I don’t care what side you’re on, you can’t ignore that estimate. It’s realistic and very likely.

Big drop is coming
54k shares in pre market... haha... very low volume... no sellers
Looks like most pullbacks are affecting most stocks as bond yields are spiking and big money is flowing into crypto and other assists. I firmly believe in Nio’s growth and potential as an investor which is why I suggest buying these dips and long calls. Companies with great valuations and business models will always prevail in the long run.
NIO will go down 80%.. they not even sell one EV car !! just prototype.. where is the revenue ???

The jig is up it is very obvious that wall street and media are trying to get investors to short the stock. Wall street does this to great stocks so they can scoop in buy up all the shares and make the profits for the big guys .

You simply can not compete in China's automotive sector unless you have a battery swap technology.When the average investors wakes up to these realities, NIO's stock will be xxx a share.Big institutions have researched and done their homework, and that's why they have been loading up.NIO is only beginning it's journey, sit back and enjoy the 2nd half of 2022 and all of 2023.There will be fireworks"

The thing about NIO is not good news coming. Its good news has been here for as long as the stock declined. This is what a coiled spring looks like. Yes you can make a boatload of money being in under $70. Yes I said $70 NIO will have the scale in months

"Just an interesting thought. Apple stock on 3/1/89 traded at 43 cents per share. Ten years later, on 3/1/99, the stock traded at 39c per share...a ten percent reduction excluding inflation. There is little logic to this stuff for long periods. These huge percentage swings in the market most everyday, especially in the Nasdaq should show folks that even though little has changed from when you got up yesterday morning and this morning, your net worth can drop by ten percent on no reason.. I hope NIO can get listed soon on the HK and SHanghai exchanges, as I feel prices will stabilize a bit more. The US is finished."
This is the most undervalued company in the history of the stock market ! Been buying NIO for 2 years since $3! Easiest money I’ve ever made!

"Good morning boys and girls. You all still listening to the mindless pumper who have pumped this to a crash of 50%? Have you not learned yet?A little bit of advice I will give you rookies free of charge. Keep your investment money in the groups that are going up not down. I know this sounds simple and actually it is. If your money is tied up in a group of stocks, lets say EV, and that group is out of favor you can not expect to make money. If you haven't figured that out by now you have no business in the stock market. Check out IBD and look at the strong groups. I like to look for groups that are not at the top but are going up and soon may work their way to the top. EV has worked its way to the bottom with no end in sight.Your welcome."
The chip shortage will end soon then this will rocket.

"NASDAQ is recovering, so is NIO. The issue with this stock is it is now highly under the influence of short sellers and weak hands. A falling price, is a shorter's will and weak hands get panicked and once it recovers a bit, they sell at a small gain but in overall loss. New investors need to learn some basics: check a company's debt/cash ratio, their future plans and their management board's direction.NIO does not show any bad records but it keeps looking more and more promising! Its innovative battery as a service plan, autonomous driving, futuristic looking vehicles and recently Norway, EU and later on US expansions they all are positive signs.Unfortunately, for now the ball is in the shorter's hands and they are spreading the fear amongst all those weak hands. This is why we are seeing a plunge despite all those great news!This'll pass too, just hold your shares and try to add more on those dips. Look longer than just a day/week trading."
dont be suprised if Elon is buying up this stock
"Nio's Stock Has Option Traders Gearing Up For Higher MoveMelanie Schaffer , Benzinga -April 19, 2021 Option traders were expecting a return of positive sentiment into the stock following the reveal of Nio’s new products, and they bet more than $852,243 the share price of Nio is going higher."
Why it’s too slow to climb? Blink is catching us.
"How much longer can dark pool traders (hedge funds) continue to give NIO shares away at a 50%+ discount? After four months, they have not even come close to dislodging NIO retail longs or accumulate many shares."

"NIO is expected to become profitable on a full-year basis in 2022. - by Al RootAny analyst can choose a single number or problem like chip shortage and build a theory... An investor will do zoom out, will take all the data available, all the planes (NEOPARK = 1,000,000 cars / year!), the business model, the quality and innovation, the leadership that has a great vision and based on it will decide if NIO is for long...I decided two years ago, long and strong!

You can feel it wants to fly
NIO hits mid-$20's this week and dive bombs to $15 a share next week. And that's not even counting the HUGE earnings miss due to chip delay. Buy back in single digits in June boys and girls.
Another day of a higher high and a higher low
"Hedge funds are selling and shorting to drive the price down. Lots of retails panic sold or lost patient sold. Large institutions accumulating on the low, they also don't want to buy too much at a time to push the price back up so that they can continue to accumulate on the low. All in all, once institutions hit their target, a tiny piece of good news will be used to reverse the trend. God bless all the longs."

"Why I keep telling NIO is becoming the powerhouse of China. Keep building on the road! At the auto show, NIO introduced the Power North Plan. In three years, it will deploy a total of 100 Power Swap stations, 120 Power Mobiles, 500 Power Charger stations with over 2,000 Power Chargers, and over 10,000 destination chargers in eight provinces and autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. With the completion of the Power North Plan in the areas mentioned above, there will be one Power Swap station or Power Charger station every 100 kilometers along the expressways on average and one reliable charging or swapping station every three square kilometers in the urban area of prefecture-level cities; 95% of the tourist attractions rated AAAA or above will have charging or swapping facilities. The Power North Plan will significantly better the power experience of electric vehicle users in northern China. With that, NIO will make a step closer to the vision of driving an electric vehicle wherever a gasoline car can go."

"NIO, which is seen as a credible rival to Tesla, differs from the Californian EV maker in that it uniquely offers a proprietary battery swapping service rather than a charging network.While other players are also looking to battery swapping as a method of addressing consumer hesitation about charging times, they tend to lean towards a modular service that is open to multiple brands"

Day Trader Slaughterhouse AKA NIO
Another 11 days and we should have report on May sales. It will be interesting to see if it maintained the same as April since production was shut a few days or if it managed to creep above even with chip shortage. It would be nice to see daily production just to see if numbers started increasing/decreasing toward end of month. I feel production numbers should start slowly increasing.
40 very soon
"NIO is OUTPERFORMING among EV stocks, including Tesla."
Get ready for a 10-15% JUMP sometime in the next couple of weeks. Shorts had their fun... now it’s time to let the adults drive the bus.

"BREAKING: China reportedly to boost new energy vehicle battery swap mode through pilotPhate ZhangApril 27, 2021BREAKING: China reportedly to boost new energy vehicle battery swap mode through pilot-CnEVPost(Source: CnEVPost)New energy vehicle companies, including NIO, using the battery swap model have received new policy support.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Energy Administration recently decided to jointly organize a pilot project on the application of battery swap mode for new energy vehicles, with the aim of implementing the New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035), the Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday.The move will promote the innovative application of battery swap mode for new energy vehicles, promote the development of deep integration of new energy vehicles and energy, and support the achievement of carbon peak and carbon-neutral goals, the report said. The pilot is to strengthen key technology research and development, accelerate battery swap infrastructure construction, promote battery swap mode vehicle application as the goal, the formation of new energy vehicle charging battery swap mode complementary benign development ecology, the report said, citing a document.At present, NIO is the only car company that supports battery swap mode for general consumers, and other such models are mainly for the cab market."

"China News Driving NIO Stock Higher TodayReports today that EV rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is having troubles in China appear to be bullish for NIO stock. Indeed, EV investors appear to be viewing Tesla’s loss as Nio’s gain as the race for Chinese market share heats up.According to recent reports, Tesla sold less than 26,000 Chinese-made EVs in April, down from more than 35,000 units in March.These reports, compounded with previous bearish news that China would be moving to restrict the use of Tesla vehicles by government employees and officials, continues to move the needle on TSLA stock. Tesla has seen its share price dip today on this news.Elon Musk has publicly attempted to assuage concerns via talks with Chinese government officials. However, it appears Tesla’s built-in camera systems are a no-go for Chinese authorities looking to clamp down on American companies following rather bitter diplomatic talks of late.As the “golden child” of the Chinese EV space, investors in NIO like this news. Less competition means more profit for NIO."

"Positive news after positive news... THIS IS PRETTY BIG. I have never been more excited about NIO's future. The new Power North Plan aims to increase the country's EV market by easing consumer anxiety regarding battery life. It will result in a battery swap station or charger station about every 60 miles, on average, along highways, and will increase the density of charging and swapping stations in urban areas. The company also said that a vast majority of tourist attractions will also have such facilities."
"Nothing wrong with Nio, the company. Problem is that the entire EV sector was fully pumped up during the pandemic. It is completely reasonable for an over-inflated sector to fall back to pre-pump levels. And for NIO, that's single digits. But doubt it'll drop that far..."

"Nio went below support, $34, a few days ago. Next support levels are $30 then $22. The EV market is cool but probably not the place to be right now. At least not until the chip issue is resolved. Just my one cent advice. Had two cent advice but lost half of it thanks to NIO."
I am issuing STRONG SELL call on this with $5 target.

NIO gains advantage after Chinese Government favors battery swapping for EVsThe federal government’s assist for battery swapping programs offers NIO a bonus within the Chinese language automotive market.https://www.onlineev.com/nio-gains-advantage-after-chinese-government-favors-battery-swapping-for-evs/
"Despite these supply chain issues, NIO reported monstrous first quarter numbers.Deliveries rose 423% year-over-year and 16% sequentially in Q1. Average sales prices rose 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Revenues rose 482% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Vehicle margins expanded 400 basis points. Gross margins expanded 230 basis points. Operating loss narrowed dramatically both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter."
"Nio to expand battery swap to Europe, deliveries in late Q3"
 just borrowed some of those from Ryan
NIO is not the only stock that will never get back to its old high. Most stocks in the EV category got way ahead of themselves. Not just the car EV's. The EV battery stocks also turned into a joke. Especially those that came public through SPAC's. Over half of those companies will not be around in 2-3 years. Most of the EV car companies will survive but profits will be limited due to the competition. EV was hot with the idea of dementia Joe being in office. Everyone knew he could be pushed around. Problem is reality set in and now the street woke up to the fact too much competition is not good for the stocks.
After more than a year holding $NIO digesting ups and downs.. can’t let all my profit goes away for this ￼ manipulated market. It hits my stop today at $33. And unfortunately I am out from the whole market. Thanks you guys thank you $NIO will get back after things are stable even for higher share price. Keep holding guys NIO is a great company in a wrong market. Obi
"In 2014, Tesla demonstrated the ability to quickly and automatically swap battery packs in Model S and Model X vehicles. The technology was touted as a faster way to get a fully charged battery pack and an alternative to DC fast charging. The automaker ended up building a single battery swap station and offered owners battery swaps for a limited time before shutting down the facility."
How i feel about my portfolio performance since the beginning of 2021
NIO ready to Break for $40
"CLSA analyst Soobin Park has initiated coverage for the Chinese electric carmaker with Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $50.The Nio Thesis: Park expects Nio’s brand value, game-changing battery-swap model, and growing battery services revenue to drive its top-line sales growth and become profitable in 2023.The analyst sees semiconductor chip shortage or tech developments as near-term hiccups and that Nio's electric vehicle sales volumes and supply-chain partnerships as potential upside catalysts.CLSA expects Nio to be able to maintain a premium image as it expands into the sedan category and cracks the European EV market starting mid-2021."
"The last couple of months have not made me question my commitment to NIO. It has only made me question the integrity of the market, and understand that things don't just keep going up. NIO is going to make me/us so much better off than I/we have ever been, and I am saying the absolute truth. This is coming from more research than I have ever invested in any stock.It is the perfect time for EV's, in the perfect country (China sells more than half of the world's EV's). The Chinese government has mandated/projected 5 million EV's sold/year by 2025, which is a 40% gain per year to reach that level. China bought about 1.2 million EV's last year, and projections are for over 5 million in 2025!!! That is an increase of about 40%, and if you projected NIO's stock price by 40%/ year, you are going to be around $300 by 2026. I actually think NIO will do better than that because they will eat up market share when they start to sell mid-range cars, increase their margins, start to sell their iconic ET7, and achieve their level 4 autonomous driving platform.I have been biting my nails the last couple of months, yet I haven't sold my NIO because I know this is the current GOLD STANDARD in the EV commodity, similar to Amazon in the early 2000's.I have been watching this go down, and all that has been impressed in me is that this is an oil well that is in it's infancy, with most people having no idea how big the well will become. I really believe that this will eventually be in the top 3-4 companies in the world, with the potential to be bigger than Apple!Fun fact! NIO just passed the 2 billion kilometer mark for NIO drivers!! This is data to be used in the development in their autonomous driving platform. Data IS the driving force (please excuse the pun) in autonomous driving!Li Bin has a vision that includes being the best autonomous driving platform. The Holy Grail in the future! NIO has 2 of the top 3 experts in autonomous driving. Research Ren Shaoquing (#1 in the world) and Zhang Jianyong (#3 in the world)! Both work for our NIO! Research who is the MOST cited in the world for autonomous driving! NIO acquired Momenta, an autonomous driving company from Ren Shaoquing, and made Ren a vice president under Li Bin. A quiet MOMENTOUS moment!!Battery swapping in the only country that has given subsidies for battery swapping, and oh, by the way, China chose NIO's battery swapping model as the standard!!I know I am considered a pumper, but it truly comes from the heart and research, and NIO is by far my biggest holding. My position built up in time as I learned more about NIO and Li Bin. Covid has kept me in the house researching (mostly) NIO, and my other stocks."
"I knew this EV craze was a bubble. Yet despite all my conventional knowledge I got greedy and took a significant position in NIO just because I felt Tesla had no where to go but down, because several years of best case scenarios was already priced into Tesla and then it happened to NIO and I didnt sell. At this price I am just above break even for NIO and thinking of investing in dividend stocks. I think the Bull Run is over especially if some of Bidens wealth destroying policies get passed"
"today we need to finish at 32 or above for confirmation of an uptrend. If not, then we heading to the 20s"
This is all manipulation to the market! I am here with my shares and I am adding a bit every time it goes down

"NIO is back to the price 6-7 months ago, like October 2020. I would say this company is much better than 6 months ago. Its a BUY!"
Step by step.. Every day a dollar up its not so bad at all.

"Thank you for a cheap share. If the share price achieves $100, I will be millionaire. Thanks William Li"
I'm sensing the smart money moving from TSLA into Nio. Nio's % rate of trajectory because of numerous positive catalysts will be greater than TSLA and it will become more and more apparent to Tesla shareholders.
"One sobering reminder of the chip shortage and its impact:"" In April, Ford said that it expected production to drop 50% in the second quarter due to the chip shortage, before bottoming out and then increasing during the rest of 2021. Ford said the chip shortage would cost the automaker about $2.5 billion this year. ""The impact is universal, and is not diminishing. A month ago Intel stated that it sees the chip issue extending through 2022. Every manufacturer of computing equipment, from phones to PC's to motor vehicles, is drawing from the same troughs."
The 60 minutes interview with TSMC president may weigh heavy on NIO‘s share price for the near future until NIO can convincingly demonstrate that the chip shortage will not affect it’s production capability.
Next week $38
"Call the close - $34.50 but better yet we open $36 plus tomorrow. Tesla going the way of the Dodo bird in China, which is very very good for NIO."
"The economics associated with battery swapping will lead to design constraints and shortened battery lives, the analyst said. Encouraging these sub-optimal results, the Chinese government could limit Nio's success globally, even more so if the company relies on subsidies instead of aggressive investments in innovation to deliver competitively priced vehicles"
"People need to remember Chinas economic outlook, they will be backing Nio until it surpasses any western competition lol"
Nice volume 
I'm on Nio for long term. To be honest in order Nio to pass Tesla Nio need to open up new factories. Tesla currently has 7 factories where Nio has only one which affects the capacity. I believe Nio will value half of Tesla in just 5 years as Nio's president gave an interview saying that they have a plan to open up a new factory both for producing EV and chips. If they can open up these two factories in 2 years there is no doubt they can reach at least 300 usd rate in just 5 years.
NIO is so bad a that A UK Lidar company raised $64 Million CASH from getting a NIO contract

"Cathie wood said that, ""China is favoring local brands like NIO because battery swapping which gave subsidies. Model Y doesn't"".Also said that the Chinese built Tesla is better built than Fremont built Tesla. That shows you Chinese built products are extremely well built.""NIO will win the day"".Also from Cathie Wood. All these add up to something very simple. We have a winner that will mass produce. Xxx share coming soon!!!"
From a technical perspectivetriple bottom at $35. Closed above $41 and up in AH. Holds $41 Monday and next stop $48...then $55.All IMO due your own Due Diligence (ie look at the charts its obvious and its backed by the continued stringof smart corporate moves and the Chinese EV market!
This is where chart guys lose money. Dont give us no bullshht There is no way your chart predicts NIO that was going to take a bite out of Tesla.All you tea leave readers were talking stupid low numbers. The longs on this MB nailed it.
I can see a HUGE short squeeze coming tomorrow when shorts realize they are trapped. Same like happend in Tesla today. Gl longs! NIO to 100$+ this year!

"From today's FT ""Renault considers introducinf Battery Swapping in its electric cars...…Renault is considering introducing a battery-swapping capability in its electric cars, potentially becoming the first big carmaker to embrace the technology.Chief executive Luca de Meo told the Financial Times’ Future of the Car Summit on Tuesday he is assessing plans to adopt the technology, which would significantly cut waiting times at recharging stations.The technology allows a driver to replace spent batteries with recharged ones within minutes at dedicated stations, resurrecting an idea first introduced by the French carmaker more than a decade ago.“I’ve asked our engineers to find the solution to go back to the original idea that was pioneered by Renault around 2010/11 and maybe we’ll see the thing coming on some of the cars.“It’s not decided, but I see it as an interesting opportunity. We need to find a pragmatic solution, but from a business point of view, there’s a point separating the battery from the car.”De Meo, who opened the three-day FT virtual event where Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares and Jaguar Land Rover boss Thierry Bolloré are due to speak on Wednesday, also said Renault was on track to hit its 2022 cost-cutting targets later this year.The battery-swapping technology also allows manufacturers to decouple the cost of batteries from new electric vehicles, preventing drivers from being concerned about depreciating battery capacity or value.While none of the largest carmakers have adopted the technology, there are signs the system could work.Chinese electric vehicle start-up Nio is at present the industry leader, having carried out more than 1m swaps so far since launching its service.The brand plans to double its Chinese network to more than 500 sites in 2021, and also wants to open a swapping station in Norway later this year to spearhead its foray into the European market."""

"Negatives: 1. Being a Chinese Vehicle manufacturer 2. NIO is a Cayman islands entity with many subsidiaries. NIO China, NIO US, stake with XPT. 3. $XPEV, $LI and others EV players have all raised substantial cash. So, kind of race to the bottom from here to grab market share. Basically all of them are going to be cash incinerators. 4. It also makes me wonder how their secondary offering and $XPEV were timed so well before market correction. The big guys knew it was the top. 5. The European expansion story is a joke. It is going to be a hard sell in the lands of Porsche, BMW, VW, Daimler, Mercedez. Also, too many regulations. And not to mention the anti-China sentiment running there."

"In terms of finance, Rakesh predicts that Weilai's revenue this year will reach $ 5.2 billion and a loss per share of $ 0.29; revenue will increase by 85% to $ 9.6 billion in 2022, and reach profitability in the first in 2022. Earnings per share will be $ 0.14; In 2023, revenue will increase 73% to $ 16.6 billion, earnings will increase 6-fold and earnings per share will be $ 0.88. Assuming that the NIO can achieve this goal, its expected rate of return in 2023 will drop to 68 times.AssessmentsI have something to say...Rakesh said that, due to NIO's leadership position in the field of switching power plants in China, this will help it maintain a strong growth momentum. At the exchange station, car owners can charge their electric cars or choose to spend a few minutes to replace the battery. It is important to note that Weilai adopts a separate sales model for cars and electricity, where batteries are sold to customers as a service and battery replacement services are included in battery sales.Rakesh estimates that the cost of setting up a NIO plant will be between $ 450,000 and $ 1.5 million, and will spend $ 300,000 to store batteries. However, as the entire industry implements “standardization” according to government policies, these two costs will fall. Rakesh pointed out that Weilai plans to set up 500 exchange stations by the end of the year. In addition, the company is also cooperating with Sinopec to build up to 5,000 exchange stations in the future. In addition, Weilai will allow owners of Ford Mustang-E electric vehicles to use their charging stations, thereby expanding Weilai's customer base and helping to amortize charging station costs more quickly."

I see NIO oscillating between $28 and $42 until the 4th quarter this year where production will pick up and the Summer stock market lull will keep it at bay. Hopefully NIO will climb to between $62 and $78 by EOY.
Monday NIO should ramp higher. It's certainly bottomed at low $30's but news that Tesla is falling behind in China EV market is GREAT news for Nio. Think we open aroun $35 plus and climb throughout the day. BOOM
"7,102 vehicles delivered in April...strong, strong, strong "

This will be the Next Move if the US is to Catch Up to China.""Up to 20% Of Electric Vehicle Owners In California Switched Back to Gas, According To Study""Benzinga EV Insights , Benzinga Staff Writer April 30, 2021 5:41pmWhen thinking about the switch from a gas car to a battery-powered one, the main concern is charging. With a gas car, pumping a full tank of gas can happen in minutes, while charging an electric vehicle can take up to an hour for a full battery. One of the fastest places to charge an EV battery is at a Tesla Inc TSLA 4.79% Supercharger station.A new study published in the journal Nature Energy, covered by Business Insider, shares that nearly 1 in 5 California EV owners switched back to gas after owning an EV.The main reason for switching back was difficulty acquiring a charge for their EVs. Out of the owners that switched back to gas, more than 70% didn't have access to level 2 fast charging at home. This can charge most electric vehicles from empty to full in 6 to 10 hours, depending on the size of the battery and exact charging speed. Nearly 2/3 of EV drivers in the survey said they did not use public chargers. The reason why was not given, but normally it is more expensive and less convenient to charge at these destinations. Also, because EVs take longer to charge, it can be harder to find an open spot. Companies such as Nio Inc - ADRNIO 1.71% are working to make charging faster via battery swap technology. This allows an EV owner to replace the empty battery with a full one in a time that's comparable to filling a tank of gas.Benzinga's Take: Without fast home charging, owning an EV can be difficult. On a standard wall outlet, most EVs will only gain 3-4 miles of range per hour.Unless daily driving is minimal, this will not be enough for most Americans. If a larger wall outlet can be installed, 30-plus miles of range per hour can be gained, which can handle even the longest commutes.But with home renters, apartment owners and others that don't have the option to install faster charging at home, other charging alternatives may be needed."
RELAX!!! We saw this a few weeks ago! What goes down quickly also goes right back up quickly! Not worried at all as a medium and long term holder. Might start picking up day trades at these levels as well.
Looking like a breakout to the $42 range is imminent

UNLEASH THE ET7.
Now up in after hours. Strange stock to follow. Took a beating today for no reason yet it’s up now.Anyone have an intelligent answer?
NIO needs to decouple from the rest of the tech sector. I think getting listed on the HK exchange will facilitate that.

"Hey folks… once again, I’m going to come off as holier than thou, but the amalgamation of incessant posts for NIO and against is palpable though not surprising given ER now and in progress. Longs and short-term traders pump and it’s obvious. But shorts, it just seems on this board and others are mean-spirited and can often hide real intent with sophisticated, seemingly objective posts that inherently suggest the SP will decline so run for cover and sell. What’s the net today? NIO crushed expectations. Unaudited as someone else rightly pointed out doesn’t happen on earnings day or in quarter. The orders of magnitude on several metrics were remarkable. Yeah, I’m holding. There’s plenty of room as the world morphs to EV for two or more players… to wit: look at internal combustion players still. NIO is pureplay electric. No conversion mess to deal with. And make no mistake there is much “face” riding on its success with a very deep pocketed gov’t behind the scenes.Can we stop with the drivel. It’s obvious and tiring both ways?"
"NIO hired a blockchain and security software engineer in the U.S.Original title: NIO hired a blockchain and security software engineer in the United States. Source:In the past few weeks, the NIO (NYSE: NIO 37,975 0.12%) has skyrocketed in several ways. The company recently started building the huge NeoPark to locate its supply chain. In addition, the company is also preparing to officially enter the European Union on May 6 to establish its business in Norway. In that context, a recent job offer indicates that NIO now plans to delve into the field of cryptocurrency.According to a LinkedIn post, NIO has now hired a blockchain and a security software engineer in San Jose, California. This recruitment event aims to assist the NIO in the design and construction of a blockchain system. While this position is temporary, we believe it is a sign of NIO's deeper involvement in the field of cryptocurrency. The blockchain-based data storage system is inherently very secure, because its state is synchronized with all participating nodes in real time, thus eliminating the possibility of a single node destroying the entire data set.However, we have reason to believe that NIO's blockchain plan is likely to exceed the scope of data security. As we all know, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA 676.21 0.39%) not only owns Bitcoin (BTC), but also accepts cryptocurrency as a payment method for its vehicles. In addition, China will become the first country in the world to introduce a digital currency backed by a central bank. While the digital renminbi is not expected to use blockchain, it does show that China's political community has a new disposition for cryptocurrency-based solutions.Given NIO's well-known desire to establish itself as a lifestyle brand, it may be feasible for the company to seek to supply its NIO cryptocurrency coins in the near future. The company is already offering branded leather bags and clothing as part of its NIO life plan. The NIO currency will allow the company to attract its customers more deeply into its ecosystem, while also increasing its non-vehicle profit margins.In the first quarter of 2021 financial report, NIO's total revenue was $ 1.2183 billion and vehicle revenue was $ 1.1303 billion. This means that the company earned $ 88 million from other sources, including NIO Life. In this context, the launch of the NIO coin will significantly increase the company's lifestyle and non-vehicle profits. We believe that this story will bring many interesting developments in the near future."
"NIO has had a collar on it that's getting weaker by the dayLook for a 15 - 20% rally at any time NIO is the real deal.. the products , the markets and the capital Watch and Learn"
How much cash does NIO have ?
"Being able to swap a battery is like getting a new engine. Between this and #Uxin which will be the platform to sell used electric cars in the future , China has done it right Congrats..."
Stock Moe keeps adding Nio at these low prices. He is a smart man. I re-upped my price target based on other factors plus growth to $60-75 by end 2021.
No matter how you look at it. NIO remains the most credible and able partner for Apple to build cars with. NIO has strong ties to FoxComm as well via Mr Jack Cheng a NIO founder and current executive at FoxComm
"either 29 or 53 tom which one will it be, like for up dislike for down"
"I am holding NIO since July 2020 when the share price was $11, The minute I saw their battery swap technology I become a believer. I hope their nice cars would make it to the Canadian market!"
Everything is so cheap. Lemonade down from 185 to 62. That bubble is done. Hopefully major buying commencing soon. Get ready for a ride up sooner than you think. Nio holding floor nicely. Safe buy there imo.
My portfolio went from 110k in mid Fed down to 36k now...
All Longs Place your $ 100.00 sell order before market close !!! This is very important !!!!!!
"Suggestion for new purchases: Hold Off until this latest round of selling is over. Best potential would be a complete capitulation of the stock, which could push it down ultimately to the low 20's. The market is completely down on the EV sector, so don't buck the trend."
"Time and time again I have seen scaremongers on this board saying nio will be bankrupt/useless/fake.How can the stock be “over” if this company is in the infancy of growth.How can NIO be over if it’s deliveries were 36,000 in 2020 and this year it’s forecasted to reach 150,000 and 300,000 the year after.How can it be over if jp Morgan reckons nio will have a 1/3 of the worlds electric vehicle market share.Before you bash this stock remember this is not another company that’s share price is driven by hype this company is driven by innovation.Yeah you are right it’s not the next Tesla.It’s the next Apple"
I guess we can achieve 30% UP today as the good ER has just been reflected on share price...
Used car sales are running up in prices due to lack of them. Now imagine EVs demand where the entire world is looking to purchase them. NIO is going to be a profit machine
Cant be green every day! NIO will be back to green again tomorrow and the rest of the week!

"ladies and gentlemen, are we not entertained!? this is the Stock Market."
Those who know will tell you. When shares dry up you buy NIO 24 million shares traded Wed was about as low as I seen it in over a year. Going to be tough keeping NIO out of the high $40's
With $7.Billion in cash NIO can change the narrative back to 2020 very fast. Don't be on the wrong side of the trade

TESLA BEATS ... More green ahead for NIO
"Over time , stock market is a wealth transferring machine from the impatient to the patient ones ....."
I still remember a year ago when I said I wish NIO came to Europe so I can get the ES6 and guess what they are coming to Norway and I hope soon to Germany but I’ve changed my mind I will get the ET7 It’s freaking gorgeous car.
"If the stock is going to high to quickly in a very short time than the chance to bounce back down harder is something which the long term investor wouldn’t prefer..: rather have each day 0,5 to 0,75-% than 3 to 4. Have a great day to all longs."
"Have to laugh ,,, only thing holding NIO from breaking out like a rash is hedge funds selling upticks NIO may be the best coiled spring any of us ever see. $60 stock"
"plenty of arguments that lack of NIO cars in US soil for share price ain't shooting to sky! it's on the way for sure! once they capture decent chunk of Germany market and it's all the way transatlantic to America. if NIO successful in Germany, then it is considered truly a ICONIC EV BRAND for sure. all these happening in two years! also the share price towards 300 mark!"
"China has 1.4 billion in population, just think about it"
They expect that to go 65 !!!! I am expecting that to go 500 !!! this is the difference
It is going to be profitable in the next quarter

"NIO, coming to a city near you soon. So sorry for BMW, MB, Audi and the other so called premium brands...since they focused on ICE far too long. BMW said they’ll be 50% EV by 2030.....2030 LMAO !"
"Keep pushing, the shorts are getting desperate, the higher you push them, the quicker they’ll have to cover and buy more shares, this will push the price up! We’ve broken the bloodbath so now we must unite and push!"
"The company is looking at increasing its production capacity by building a new plant in Xinqiao Industrial Park in Hefei. Last month, $NIO started deploying the Power Swap Station 2.0. This second-generation Power Swap Station can carry up to 13 battery packs and will shorten the time required for battery swapping, thus increasing the service capacity to 312 swaps each day.With all the crazy things going on and my limited time/ability to day trade I have found https://dailytrading.tools/May-Test-Drive-2021 useful"
Cathie Wood and her team put out a free report on why she thinks battery swapping stations are not the future. It is a great read and all Nio investors should be worried.
I know it’s heading to 30$ so why buy it now and lose after
"OK, ITS TIME FOR ME TO QUIT BASHING NIO: I just sold a bunch of $25 NIO puts, that means I need the NIO stock to go up and it appears to be doing just that. Go NIO."
"Panic among shorters ahahahahah. Just opened position with 2.5k shares. Options activity that runs out today will make sure lots of shorters either lose money or exercise them, either or is good for bulls."

BREAKING: China's battery swap national standard drafted by firms including NIO to go into effect Nov. 1https://cnevpost.com/2021/05/10/battery-swap-national-standard-to-go-into-effect-nov-1/Super Long NIO!
"NIO battery swap is just for pr stunt actually. Look up Solid-state-battery, SSB is the true future of EV car and it takes 60 seconds to charge your vehicle (Ford, GM, Volkswagon, Honda, Toyota, etc..are all on board with this technology). NIO gonna have a hard time competing in the auto industry once the big names unleash their millions of EV cars. NIO and their BaaS are only good In china...Shareholder and long-term investor, please be careful."
"remember nio is not just car company ..they have created it as a high society lifestyle.. slowly they would offer many different products with nio lifestyleit's software , ai , consumer product , license, baas as well as a car company... future growth is unstoppable"
it can go to 10$ spi dont care i believe in nio long period.let see if i right 5 year from now.you cant stop china big economy .it is the future .stop with all the cheap human rights political password and admit as us citizen that they will pass you in the next future.
$NIO and $XPEV are set to break upwards any day now after a long ride down. The market has managed to get prices low enough to pick up very cheap shares and these low prices have a lot of support now at these key resistant ranges we're at right now. Keep buying. Keep holding for 5+ years. Key fundamental to always remember: China's EV market is going to be colossal.
Back to 40 by EOW
I am not interested in buying a car that needs a battery swap. It's never going to happen. This is an idea driven by companies that see big profits. People who live on a budget will not dump their ICE car for an EV if this is part of the deal. It's a good thing that batteries tech is getting so good we don't need this. Just like Hydrogen fuel - this is being pushed by the industry on to consumers who don't want it.
"Options say $35 Friday .,.."
All time high by end of the year easily
When I trade stocks I've never once felt the need to berate others or the stock even if I play bear. I am genuinely curious on why people do it. Doesn't make the stock move.
Imagine buying a Nio and getting a battery swap. Trapped inside a steel coffin to cheap Chinese labor. Thermal event happens due to misalignment and punctures the battery.
To all Longs... don’t sell and keep your shares. NIO is a very strong company with huge potential. Stay focused because in the end we will get back to 40+
"Greatest Hits Coming.. for your pre-market enjoyment ,,"
I guess EVs will just stop selling in China? -Not.Sell in May and you will Pay.Big Summer rally about to start with the anticipation of Chip shortage solved.
"NIO is a steal and the big guys know it, 40 different hedge funds heavily invested, neo park being able to produce 1 million cars a year, battery swap is the future, 200$ a share 2022"
"With all of the good news... 489.89% Y.O.Y. increase in sales, Norway announcement, Nio park and factory announcement, deal with Ford, deal with Sinopec, just to name a few... The question remains, ""Who would sell their diamond shares here""??? I suppose people who live in a bizaro world where light is actually dark, and they don't want to make long term money, sad."

"Does Nio Stand To Benefit From Chinese City Chongqing's Subsidies For Battery Swap Stations?5/19/21, 3:54 AMMay 19, 2021 04:54 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsChinese electric vehicle maker Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO) could significantly reduce the construction costs of its local battery swap stations if it can take advantage of the subsidies announced by the Chinese city of Chongqing, cnEVpost reported Tuesday.What Happened: Chongqing will provide subsidies of up to RMB 500,000 ($78,000) for each battery swap station built and put into operation in the city, according to the report that cited a document released by the city’s finance bureau.Builders are eligible to apply for subsidies if the annual cumulative number of battery swap stations built and put into service by them in Chongqing reach at least 15, as per the report. However, cnEVpost added it is not sure if Nio is eligible for the subsidy.The individual cost of Nio’s second-generation battery swap station is reportedly RMB 1.5 million ($236,850), half the cost of the company’s first-generation product. Nio’s battery swap station construction costs will be significantly reduced if it can take advantage of the Chongqing city subsidy, the report noted.Nio built its first second-generation battery swap station in the city on May 9."
"I think the actually bigger (hidden) news here is, that sinopec – chinese giant with 35000 gas stations –was before this deal in talks with Tsla about its charging system according to forbes article (google sinopec tesla) and now decided itself for $NIO s swap system – lets not forget here that NIO has swapping and mobile charging system plus what all others including tsla has.While Elon is still denying the swap system he becomes slowly but steady a leftbehind in china. Total domination of china and then the world here we come, elon can still pay us and use our battery packs ;) since BaaS is free to enter for anyone who pays for it thanks to william lis mercy.Lets go into the multi trillion dollar marketcap future"
I wonder if Stock Moe bought more again today? The man has been accumulating like a boss.
$20's coming by Friday
will be interesting from an options point of view today. there are a bunch of calls as well as put expiring in the 33-35 bux range. my guess this stock will be kept below 34 to eliminate most options either side..
I just woke up. What’s going on here ?
"How many legacy car companies have anything like BaaS, or Super charging stations, or any of the technology. AI is the future, $Nio Nomi."

Good opportunity to buy again.
"Last week, NIO management sat down with Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung. The analyst says NIO expects the situation to ease in the June-July time frame. That's a brighter outlook from late April, when the EV maker said on its first-quarter earnings conference call that the chip shortage was getting more severe.That means investors should be hearing better news on second-quarter conference calls. Chung rates NIO shares Hold and has a $57.60 price target for shares."

"Upcoming Nio Catalysts: The coming few weeks are key for Nio. The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter results April 29.Analysts, on average, estimate a loss of 16 cents per share, narrower than the 25-cent-per-share loss in the year-ago period. Revenues are expected to jump over 400% year-over-year to $1.02 billion.On the earnings call, the company is likely to shed more details on new products and services, and chip availability. The company was forced to shutter its plant for a few days in late March and early April due to chip supply shortages. Nio's April deliveries update is due in early May. This number could be of particular interest to investors due to the five-day factory shutdown that began March 29.Rumors abound that Nio may announce its European expansion plan May 7 or 8. As the EV maker prepares for its maiden overseas foray, investors may be keen to find out more details regarding the timeline, targets, localization of production, distribution and pricing.Confirmation from the company regarding a potential secondary listing in Hong Kong is also seen as a positive for the stock. With the listing, the company is setting up the possibility of expanding its investor base and in turn financing sources.Source: Benzinga"

"Wow 5 months ago everyone was excited for inflation because it meant another bull run for stocks.But now everyone thinks inflation is bad? Lol people cannot make up there minds. It's as if narratives are created in order to exploit retail investors. Amazing.So far looking at charts in 1-5 years we are doing great. The overall markets have been in a correction, but that's it and that's all."
NIO will thrive together with other companies in the sunrise industries. Cheers to holders
Bought 3300 shares
YouTube videos said to buy at every dollar it dropped. Look where we at now
"sad to all the people thinking this is a great stock long term, they produce EV's and so do a number of other companies, within a couple years all the major vehicle manufacturer's will be selling EV's(ford, GMC, Toyota, etc) and the competition will drop overall sales and profit margins, bottom line is this is just another company trying to sell vehicles, look at it for what it is, so many people talk as if there will be no other manufacturers or competition giving Nio this huge market in the future, not so"
"Nio's Battery Swaps Dampen Global Ambitions: Ark Invest AnalystShanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer May 10, 2021 3:51pm NIO has more to lose than to gain with the subsidies the Chinese government is doling out to domestic electric vehicle manufacturers, according to an analyst at Ark Invest, the investment fund run by Cathie Wood.What Happened: The Chinese Ministry of Finance announced in April that it is extending the subsidy meant for EVs priced below 300,000 yuan ($46,766) through the end of 2022.The government also extended subsidies for higher-priced vehicles with battery-swapping capability in a bid to promote this technology. Nio's EVs, though positioned as premium brands, qualify for subsidies for this reason has not embraced battery swapping tech, and therefore Teslas priced above this limit do not qualify for subsidies in China."
still here. still long.
EV selloff is going to end. Its overdone.Let Cramer buy Wendys
"I have long on Nio and just bought further shares in Wimi hologram also Chinese, both got hit the last months on the stock market and both will come out strong software and ability to work the hardware will be a strong factor for autonomous cars and Nio And Toyota are further ahead than other ev and traditional car maker s"
Smart Investors know a chip shortage restricts NIO competitors too.The Chip shortage gives NIO time and space as they build their new advanced manufacturing plant It could be a plus for well managed NIO
I've added my remaining savings into Nio this morning around 9:30am time here. I cannot be happier! Hopefully this is the reversal for all EV's and a bottom has been reached. It's been a long tough few months. However a spectacular buying opportunity to add shares for the long term investors. We are looks good once again. :)
I bet that NIO stock has a bottom here. $30.60 tested twice.. next stop $35 must be tested again..
Once this goes green they will start pushing the price down again in my view. Thats how people are trapped

"Smart money will be coming back to the EV sector soon just hold and relax, keep accumulating"
Panic sellers lol. So many young traders losing a lot of money. Never sell when the market is bad or when the trend is down. Hold tight and enjoy buying these low dips. Just got some more
You know its bad when this is tanking on a very good nasdaq day. Chip shortage+ inflation fears + short seller overweight positions = very unappealing. And if we're entering a bear market? Ouch.
I guess the jokes on me!! Not just Nio but all EV and growth stocks. I bought and bought and now the real selling looks to start

"Nio‘s battery concept serves any taste: you can swap if it suits you, you can buy and charge at home, you can rent. Decoupling the battery from the car generally is clever and lets customers keep up with the fast moving battery improvements. Similar but more sophisticated than Renault Zoe, which is a very popular car in Europe. Trying to bash Nio on their battery concepts is pretty desperate"
"NIO's hiring of blockchain expert could herald innovations in user rightsPhate ZhangMay 6, 2021 In China, companies are prohibited from using cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, for payments. But innovation using the technology behind it is encouraged, and we're starting to see companies in the automotive industry start to do just that.Chinese electric car company NIO is hiring blockchain and security software engineers based in San Jose, US, and even though it's a temporary position, it's drawing a lot of interest.According to NIO's job description on LinkedIn, the engineer is responsible for designing, building blockchain systems, and delivering production-ready systems in the areas of blockchain and security engineering.Candidates need to have excellent knowledge of computer science, especially distributed systems, and need to be familiar with blockchain technologies, including cryptography.From what is known, it is unclear what NIO's specific purpose is, but it is safe to speculate that the company is exploring innovations to its user entitlement system based on blockchain technology.Currently, NIO already has a user entitlement system that includes rewards for users who successfully refer others to purchase a car, and points for users who log into the NIO App every day.This system is excellent and easy to use, but seems relatively ordinary compared to the company's innovations in business models that include the separation of body and battery.NIO has always touted itself as a user-centric company, so it would make sense to innovate on user rights, and blockchain technology provides a good direction.There is already a precedent for this in the automotive industry, although it is still in its infancy.Less"

"Earlier this year, Nio (NIO) stock touched a high of $66.90. Since that time, valuation concerns, coupled with a semiconductor shortage, have resulted in a steep correction.

"To New NIO investors who joined us today asking about NIOs potential and whether they made the best decision: Potential is as big as the globe; NIO is building a broad spectrum of technologies camouflaged behind a commuting vehicle, a consumer product. NIO is getting into future ENERGY transformation and distribution; NIO is in entertainment industry, in e-commerce, in food and beverages. She is licensing her brand to broad range of consumer products and collects loyalty. NIOs autonomous driving sensor fusion is the most comprehensive of that in any other car in the market. NIO decided to build a more expensive system to have a better chance in providing guaranteed Safety and Security for passengers. And NIO is at the epicenter of EV Revolution, China, benefiting its government support and conviction towards a healthier community for present and future generations. If you think it’s hard to beat Tesla (American NIO) today, think about how competitive China has become where Xpev promising flying cars by 2022, Li Auto says its Self Driving beats that of Tesla, Ford submits to NIO Charging Schemes and NIO aggressively using every opportunity to expand and distribute super chargers and BaaS not only in highly populated areas but also in remote deserts and high altitudes all the way to the nearest pitstop to the peak of Mount Everest.

"The Bottom Line on Nio StockI’d use weakness in the NIO stock as an opportunity to buy. Even with semiconductor shortage issues, the company still sees strong deliveries and revenue growth. It’s expanding into Europe, and we have to consider that electric vehicle growth isn’t likely to slow any time soon. In fact, with the world looking to reduce emissions significantly over the next few years, electric vehicle stock will be some of the top beneficiaries.With this anticipated growth in Europe, I’d like to see NIO back to $50. Longer-term, I’d like to see it closer to $67.50."" investorplace."""
until the chip shortage is resolved...all EV stocks will not move up much. NIO will hit the $60-$80 once there's a good source of chips
So many thumbs down on very good and informative posts means shorts are at work over the weekend which also means NIO is a very good stock!

"the market will do the opposite of what you expect, a lot expecting nio to go to the 20s and when it goes up a bit they short it, watch out"
Who is still here since early 2020 or even before that and holding? NIO long and strong!
"Despite the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage, NIO’s revenue increased 481% as compared to the same quarter the previous year. It reported a revenue of $1.21 billion in the quarter. The gross profit reached $237 million which is a 36% jump from the previous quarter. It is impressive to see that the company went from loss to profit within one year. This is no small feat."
"Capacity expansion also will aid long-term delivery growth with the new plant planned at NeoPark. Although shares continue to consolidate around a $60 to 65 billion valuation amid industry headwinds, NIO's impressive long-term potential sets shares up for a positive long-term trajectory."

Photo: ReutersChinese electric-vehicle (EV) start-ups NIO Inc and Xpeng are best placed to rival industry leader Tesla for global market share because of their competitive technological advantages and strong shareholder support, according to JPMorgan Asset Management. Never mind that they may take years to earn their first dollars.“They have three key competitive advantages, [namely] significant production expertise, strong software integration skills such as Advanced Driver Assistance System, and strong backing,” said Oliver Cox, Hong Kong-based money manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. He cited Tencent Holdings and Meituan as their powerful financial backers.The two US-listed EV start-ups are setting the pace in the mainland China market, which is set to dominate the global EV industry in the coming years amid a bullish outlook painted by auto analysts. Under the “Made in China 2025” industrial plan, 20 per cent of new cars will be new-energy vehicles (NEVs), which encompasses pure electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell cars.The view should come as a warning for Tesla, which has stumbled on several regulatory hiccups and a quality backlash. The Shanghai Auto Show also suggests Chinese EV makers are gunning for its scalp, with Geely Auto unveiling its Zeeker 001 model, and Volkwagen its ID.6 along with a slew of mini EVs.Competition for market share is heating up as more than 500 players have entered the fray with the industry on the cusp of a major growth spurt, including new entrants like smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. China recorded a 12 per cent jump in NEV sales to 1.17 million units in 2020 and sales almost doubled last quarter. UBS forecasts electric car sales will reach 6.6 million in 2025 and 18 million by 2030.Cox co-manages the US$1.22 billion Pacific Technology Fund, which has risen 89.4 per cent over the past year, according to Bloomberg data. The fund added NIO and Xpeng some time between September 2020 and February this year, according to reports to fund holders, amounting to a combined 2.9 per cent of its net assets.NEWKNOWLEDGEWho's leading China's electric car market?Get the full pictureShares of Beijing-based NIO and Guangzhou-based Xpeng have risen by 1,168 per cent and 122 per cent respectively over the past 12 months.

"Battery swap technology is Expensive, wasteful, and timely. This will be the laughing stock of all Electric Vehicles."
you still have a chance to cover below $35.. your lucky day shortie
I’ve been buying and ran out of funds with this correction going on for months. It’s unfortunate the EV’s continues to fall on good news. I’m going to try to muster up some more funds on a week for more Nio first and maybe Xpev and Cciv. Good luck longs. We will be fine long term.
"As you know, for several months, I have touted two things (check my history) that are key to NIO's growth: 1) NIO must develop a vehicle that appeals to the middle class. 2) NIO's expansion into Germany (Norway is not significant) will draw huge and much needed institutional support.Fortunately, someone influential from NIO must have been reading my posts and has heeded my advice because those two MAJOR catalysts seem to be having credible traction."
If you're tracking the real-time tick by tick you're probably noticing something that I've noticed. Every so often you'll see the bid size flash upwards of +10K shares offerred. It quickly vanishes and then occurs again a few minutes later. Over and over again. Somebody selling into any surges? Not sure it's important...but it keeps happening which tends to make me think some positions are being squared here in the $33.17 area...
Tesla had monopoly in EV sector...Now Chinese EV car makers are buckled up going globally with superior technology...features ..efficiency and finish..detailed precision car makers..They have been a treat to global car makers with unbeatable prices..It's logical thinking...they will take their market share..Nio is one such car maker from China and the rest chinese carmakers will fire..
"But American, that’s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!” First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations around the globe. But fine, just take a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier “ramp” years."

"Lidar sensor maker Innovusion said on Monday it had raised $64 million in funding to ramp up production to supply Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio Inc's ET7 sedan, which is scheduled to start deliveries in early 2022.The funding includes new investments from Singapore state investor Temasek and venture capital firm Joy Capital.Some existing investors also participated, including Nio Capital, Nio's investment arm. With the latest funding, Innovusion has raised more than $100 million.Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car. They are seen as essential by many automakers for higher levels of driver assistance, right up to making cars capable of self-driving.Nio unveiled the ET7 earlier this year.It is one of two models the EV maker plans to sell in Norway, where government tax breaks and subsidies have made the country a global leader in per capita EV sales.Innovusion Chief Executive Junwei Bao said its Lidar sensors would be offered as standard on the ET7, with the latest funding helping to scale up production and provide financing to some suppliers.""The supply chain needs a boost because Lidar is a new animal, so we'll use some of the funding to support them,"" he said.Innovusion's sensors can spot some objects at a range of up to 500 meters (1640 ft) and can register all but the darkest objects at a range of 250 meters.Junwei Bao said Innovusion's sensors were being evaluated for deployment by other carmakers.Other Lidar makers like Ouster Inc and Luminar Technologies Inc have gone public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)."
"I suspect most of the NIO bashers here are day traders, and thought they were geniuses when they took 10-20% profit. They probably looked on in horror at the enormous surge! Investing is easier when you buy & hold."
"Nio also has plans for expansion in the U.S. That’s unlikely to begin this year, but the key point is that expansion into new markets will ensure that vehicle deliveries remain robust. The company is already building a new plant in the Xinqiao Industrial Park in Hefei. This will cater to the incremental demand from China as well as from international expansion."

"Exclusive: Tesla puts brake on Shanghai land buy as U.S.-China tensions weigh - sourcesStock MarketsMay 11, 2021 12:11PM ET4 Exclusive: Tesla puts brake on Shanghai land buy as U.S.-China tensions weigh - sources� Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The logo of car manufacturer Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland October 28, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannSHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub, people familiar with the matter said, due to uncertainty created by U.S.-China tensions.With 25% tariffs on imported Chinese electric vehicles imposed on top of existing levies under former U.S. President Donald Trump still in place, Tesla now intends to limit the proportion of China output in its global production, two of the four people said.Tesla had earlier considered expanding exports of its China-made entry-level Model 3 to more markets, including the United States, sources told Reuters, a plan that had not previously been reported.Tesla currently ships China-made Model 3s to Europe, where it is building a factory in Germany.Shares of Tesla fell as much #$%$3% early on Thursday.Tesla sold 25,845 China-made vehicles in China and overseas in April, down from 35,478 in March, according to data from China Passenger Car Association.Tesla's Shanghai factory is designed to make up to 500,000 cars per year, and has the capacity to produce Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at a rate of 450,000 total units per year.In March, Tesla refrained from bidding on a plot of land across the road from the plant as it no longer aimed to boost China production capacity significantly, at least for now, three of the people said, declining to be named as the discussions were private.In a statement to Reuters, Tesla said its Shanghai factory was ""developing as planned.""The Shanghai city government, a key supporter in Tesla's establishment of a wholly owned factory in China - the first and only foreign passenger car plant not required to form a joint venture - did not respond to a request for comment.Tesla had never declared an intention to acquire the land, which is about half the size of the 200-acre (80 hectare) plot housing Tesla's current facility and would enable the company to lift capacity by another 200,000 to 300,000 cars, said two of the people.Tesla's China sales are surging despite mounting regulatory pressure in the country after consumer disputes over product safety and scrutiny over how it handles data.It generated $3 billion in revenue in China in the first three months of this year, more than tripling year-earlier sales and accounting for 30% of total revenue.LAND PLANSLed by mercurial Chief Executive Elon Musk, Tesla is known for shifting gears on strategy, including in China.Construction documents posted on a government website in March show Tesla is revamping its plant in Shanghai to add capacity.Tesla still has land, designed for production but now used for parking, at its Shanghai site. One of the people said Tesla could expand its capacity beyond 500,000 on its existing site. Another said Tesla may acquire more land for more car production lines in the future.Separately, Tesla is building facilities to repair and reproduce key components such as electric motors and battery cells and build EV chargers at its Shanghai plant.The Shanghai government has been talking to several companies to sell the land for new-energy commercial vehicle production, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.Tesla faces intensifying competition in China with domestic players such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, which is considering making mass market products under another marque.Even before the trade war tariffs, relatively few China-made cars were shipped to the United States."

"China EV Sales Report for April:1. NIO 23%2. Tesla 17%3. Xpeng 7%and the rest of them(10-12 other EV companies) were lower than 5%.Nio is clearly in a great position to succeed in China as well as in Europe. China will overtake U.S as world's #1 economy sooner than expected, and almost all scholars agree. China has almost 1.5 billion people population and many of them are sickly rich. Nio car sales number right now is probably less than 1% of it's potential."

"The Chip Shortage Could Be on Its Way Out. Here's Where Things Stand. -- Barrons, 11:20 A shortage of semiconductors is delaying automotive production by millions of units around the globe, costing auto makers billions in profits -- just as demand is surging after the Covid-19 pandemic. But recent commentary from car and chip makers suggests that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel for the industry and for automotive investors.Investors have heard plenty about the current state of capacity problems for months. Roughly 2 million cars -- or about 10% of quarterly global automotive production -- weren't built in the first quarter because of no chips. Ford Motor(F) , one of the auto makers feeling the shortage most acutely, said in late April that it expects to lose about 50% of planned second-quarter production.It has been much harder for automotive investors to get a sense of when these supply chains issues actually will improve. But Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NIO) and chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International (0981.Hong Kong) are now offering some signs of hope for the industry.Last week, NIO management sat down with Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung. The analyst says NIO expects the situation to ease in the June-July time frame. That's a brighter outlook from late April, when the EV maker said on its first-quarter earnings conference call that the chip shortage was getting more severe.That means investors should be hearing better news on second-quarter conference calls. Chung rates NIO shares Hold and has a $57.60 price target for shares.Semiconductor Manufacturing International's first-quarter conference call held May 13 offered another ray of hope, saying that supply constraints will last ""until the end of the year."" While that means there are months left of supply constraints, it also means an end is indeed coming.This is good news for high-growth EV stocks such as NIO, which is down about 30% year to date. Higher interest rates and more EV competition in China have played a role in the decline of EV stocks, but the chip shortage has constrained exactly what investors want to see: growth.Shares of traditional auto makers such as Ford Motor(F) and General Motors(GM) are up year to date, mainly because auto sales are recovering from pandemic-induced lows. Still GM and Ford stocks are down over the past month as concern over the chip shortage and its impact on profits has crept in. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are essentially flat over the same period.Improvement in the chip situation has the potential to remove one overhang from the auto sector. Investors are anxious to see the situation improve. After all, demand for cars is strong right now, and car companies need to strike while the iron is hot."
"i believe NIO has something the other EVs don't that is a game changer. that is the swappable  battery. the main point is battery technology is continuously developed and the ""engine"". this is the best approach with changing technology. NIO can introduce new engines. disclosure I hold stock and expect this company surpass Tesla in few years. undervalued due to fake news from short sellers. I would suggest if you hold this stock to set a high overnight sell price $400+ and as far out as possible so the short sellers can't borrow your shares and if they are forced to buy to cover very very expensive. good luck everyone."

"Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu offered his commentary on this week's action in a research report published on a Friday.

He named Baidu (BIDU), Foxconn, Huawei, and Xiamoni, among others getting into the Chinese electric-vehicle market. His list didn't include Tesla, which expanded its Chinese offering to include Model Y crossover vehicles recently, and Ford Motor (F), which started taking orders for its Mach E in China this week.Still, Yu believes Nio, Xpeng(XPEV), and Li Auto(LI) can be long-term winners. Of the three, he prefers NIO and XPeng(XPEV), rating both shares Buy. His price target on NIO is $70. His price target on XPeng(XPEV) is $48 a share. Yu rates Li stock Hold and has a $32 price target for those shares."

Then again long term u can’t lose with nio. Especially with them being top choice in China. Correct me if im wrong by all means. Short term a little scary but long term nio is a winner. God bless and good luck everyone

"Hi everyone, Tesla’s car production in China dropped 27% from March to April, this a huge production reduction in one month for Tesla. Even more interesting that Tesla only sold 11,671 of it cars in China, solid clear factual indication that it have lose a massive market shares to the local 3 auto maker (NIO, SPEV and Li) which was about 17,800 combined sales! There is a major shift happening in the EV market in China - and conveniently not of these is covered by the media in the US Market. Since Feb. 8th TSLA’s SP dropped 35%, dragging the entire EV & battery sector down 50%-65%. - the hedge funds realizing this major shift taking place in China EV (largest market in the world) collectively has taken full advantage with massive shortening of all the Chinese EV stocks to assume much larger position in major discount from the panicking majority retailers position ” a classical move “ - once the chain supply of chips Shortage / batteries will be resolve soon, all 3 Chinese EV makers will surge in deliveries number for Q3 & Q4 and beyond and their SP will follow up sharply as well! - these are my analysis on the current events taking place with NIO stock. And my recommendations is hold on to your shares and accumulate as much as you can, you won’t regret it."

"ALERT FYI ARK analyst also put out a BS story on NIO today Look up "" Nio's Battery Swaps Dampen Global Ambitions: Ark Invest Analyst"" May 10, 2021 (BenzingaIts was to cover Tesla over this ""China's battery swap national standard drafted by firms including NIO to go into effect Nov. 1""May 10, 2021 -China EV Post REALITY CHECKBattery Swap is going to win everywhere - Tesla has it wrong"
"EV's in many cases are already cheaper than ICE cars. These studies that point to 202727 as the year that EV's become competitive with ICE cars is a ridiculous study. It isn't just the initial cost that should be compared but rather the overall cost for the time period of your vehicle. Take NIO's entry into Norway. First, the vehicles NIO is selling in Norway are comparable to S class Mercedes. A 450 S class in Norway costs 90K. What does an ES8 cost? Now let's look at the S class fuel bill. With gasoline at $7/gallon in Norway and 20 mpg with that Mercedes, let's drive the two a bit. With the 100 kwh battery, the NIO can get 300 miles between charges and kwh rates in Norway are 10.4 c per kwh, so a full charge would cost $10.40. Now, let's look at the Mercedes 450S averaging 20 MPG. With 300 miles of driving, that Mercedes requires 15 gallons of gas. At $7/gallon in Norway, that totals $105 in gas to go the same distance a NIO ES8 will go on $10.50 cents worth of electricity. That is a $94.50 savings in the NIO every 300 miles. That means in 30000 miles of driving, the NIO saves another $9450 dollars in cost savings, and the NIO was a cheaper purchase in the first place, has a longer warranty and way less maintenance . You don't have to wait until 2027. Imagine the ET7 with the 150 kwh battery allowing 580 miles between charges costing only $15.60 to charge. You do the math. Right now, in America, gasoline averages $3/gallon where average kwh rates are about 13.5c/kwh so a hundred kwh battery can be charged for $13.50 in America, take you between 300-400 miles. How many gallons of $3/gallon gas in your 25 mpg car will it take? Well...for 300 miles, you would use 12 gallons of gas in a 25mpg car x $3/gallon =$36 of gas vs $13.50 worth of electricity. Looks like ICE cars cost about 3x as much per mile or more at least. People buying ICE cars now are just asking to hold obsolete money suckers in the future."
"The $ 35 support, it was broken a few days ago, I do not recommend any purchases once this support has been broken.It is in free descent without obstaclesI can assure you that shorts always have a minimum volume of 20% daily for their games.Who lends these shares is a mystery.It's very frustrating, very good news always and always going down"

"In the stock market what happen in the past means little if you are tanking in the present. A good example would be anyone who bought into the hype of the Chinese EV car sector at the end of last year. Those that bought before the big run started made out good even if they were not smart enough to sell some or all before the 50% crash. Now you have for months seen pumpers posting all their blue sky and new models and NIO day and all the reasons NIO would get back to its old high. How has that worked out?They don't mention ever since there has been a stock market there are groups that got way ahead of themselves and in time got cut back to where they should be priced. That is what happen to the Chinese EV stocks. You can throw most all of the EV battery stocks in there too. Call them Tulips.Those who got sucked into the hype are now down big time. They would have been much better of YTD in GM or F. Both of those companies actually make their own cars unlike NIO. Those companies actually make money so they do not have to dilute the current shareholders. Both are going big into EV cars.History shows it is not easy to make money in the auto business. Just too much competition. By the time NIO ever gets up to making a decent amount of cars not only will F and GM pass them in cars built, but so will BMW Mercedes and Volkswagen.I would actually put money into Volkswagen before any of the Chinese EV companies.Before you buy the OLD HYPE, you better look at it from all angles. NIO has crashed 50% and has lost all momentum. All Chinese EV stocks are out of favor now. Just think if you buy NIO then they do yet another dilution what will happen to the stock. Remember this trustworthy management team told you once before they didn't need any more money and diluted for the third time less than a month after telling that to the shareholders.Can NIO go up form here? Yes of course it can. Does it look to anytime soon. Look at how it has acted you you determine that. I think it is dead money. In a market that is at all time highs be careful where you put your money. Stick with strong stocks.Have a great weekend."
"Chip shortage is overblown and short term- AlixPartners expects the largest impact to production in the second quarter and then progressively get better during the second half of the year and into 2022, Hearsch told CNBC.""By Q3, there's enough to get everybody back up and running for the most part,"" he said. ""And then in Q4, we should get humming again and then next year get back to normal, hopefully."""
"I just read a negative article from investorplace from Dana B. She compares tsla and other ev's as an apples to apples comparison to nio. I don't need to go into detail as there are many learned folks here, but she has left out a lot of factors that tilt the scale for Nio. Nio is making a comprehensive, customer first ecosystem 2nd to none, imo she has grossly underestimated this in addition to the cost to produce and brand solidarity in the best market. The same article could have been written about a number of successful companies in their infancy, but broke out from pack while on the surface only appeared to be another me-too. Time will tell, but do your own analysis and form your own beliefs. Lately I see analysts all over the place and I'm continually losing confidence in their assessments. glta"

Let me take a wild guess...NIO trades down tomorrow.
Call the Open tomorrow. $33 and that's the good news. Nio will close near $32 due to longs getting very very nervous about future earnings report. And I don't blame them.
If NIO can hold $33 today would be a good sign bottom might be in. That doesn't mean it will return to $40 anytime soon. The one step forward two steps back has been the movement in NIO for a while now.

If you want investment ideas from real knowledgeable traders, check them out at the https://dailytrading.tools/7jh9n4 platform"
"Price target of NIO stock is $60? That's where I bought it! Yay, I might break even"
I just keep buying the dip nobody can tell me this is not a tripple digit stock
"A NIO ET7 Luxury high performance EV sedan, will cost $100,000 less than a Lucid Air"
"If the figures that are being posted here are accurate, NIO beat on both the top AND bottom lines. The EPS in particular has been something i've been posting about, and to see that this figure is moving handsomely in the right direction is VERY impressive and welcome.The major overhang continues to be the chip shortage. But, with a good quarterly in the bank, it shouldn't take too long, hopefully, for the Street to program this into the mix, and come up with something a bit more to the liking of the investor community.NIO management is proving that they are up to the challenge. So, it's now becoming a wait-and-see game for this chip shortage to be fully baked into the algorithms, and to open the door to what lies beyond."
"I was expecting it to drop another 1 dollar to 32 so I can load my boat safely but that was an epic run-up from 33, feel like NIO might have found the bottom. Haven't seen action like that in quite some weeks. Impressive."
"$NIO Open note to my fellow investors: Ladies and Gentlemen,If you fail to see why this company isn’t visionary. Then I’m not sure what else can help qualify this for you. The moves this company are making will hit before you know it. Please seriously imagine millions of NIO cars on the road. MILLIONS. Now please, genuinely convince me why there isn’t room for insane growth on the SP. Take a step back people, breathe and remain confident in your research ——The 16,950-acre park features three main function areas, smart manufacturing, R&D and living space, and eco-park.NeoPark aspires to be green and environmentally friendly and contributes to peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality.

"Just another positive article reiterated today - “Another recent news item came from a rather surprising source. Ford (NYSE:F) said preorders are open in 20 cities in China for the locally made electric Mustang Mach-E. The surprise was that it is coordinating with NIO to allow Mach-E owners to use the NIO charging network, which would become a new source of revenue for the Chinese EV maker. In a statement reported by CleanTechnica, Ford said: Mustang Mach-E users can access over 300,000 high-quality public charging piles, of which 160,000 are fast charging, in more than 340 cities across the country through an exclusive APP. NIO's nationwide fast-charging network will also be accessible to Mustang Mach-E users.”The positive news are piling up. NIO is doing everything right."

$400 end of year will not surprise me. One of the biggest future EV car companies. Very undervalued.

"WOW, a machine is unscrewing a battery and replacing it with a new one????? OH MY GOD!!!!!! THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY HOLY Moly !!!!!!!!!!! - Nio investor"
It's still hard to believe how mysterious forces can control the share price like this. I still refuse to admit what is blatantly clear every Friday... The straw that breaks the camels back would be a continuation of this sideways trading d'or 4 hours to print day end at 33.9 
Its all just a game. Hold long enough and you will make money.
Traders should note the pullback Tuesday PM attracted 111 million buys and more volume than all month Dropping NIO was a fail for the hedge funds .. Buyers jump right in. Everyone wants this stock and retail will not let go.
"The bottom line on NIO stockNeedless to say, NIO is doing very well and it’s not stopping here. The company expects deliveries between 21,000 and 22,000 in the second quarter and total revenue between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Considering the way NIO is growing, the deliveries and revenue seem achievable. That, of course, will lead to a rise in the EPS."
"Team NIO: our company just impressed the sector with another exquisite earning; Here is the highlights of Business OutlookFor the second quarter of 2021, the Company expects:1. Deliveries of the vehicles to be between 21,000 and 22,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 103% to 113% from the same quarter of 2020, and an increase of approximately 5% to 10% from the first quarter of 2021. 2. Total revenues to be between RMB 8,146.1 million (US$1,243.3 million) and RMB8,504.5 million (US$1,298.0 million), representing an increase of approximately 119.0% to 128.7% from the same quarter of 2020, and an increase of approximately 2.1% to 6.5% from the first quarter of 2021.Bravo Team NIO.

"NIO and Sinopec’s strategic partnership will allow NIO to dramatically scale up its Battery Swap 2.0 station deployment across China with Sinopec’s assistance. Additionally, NIO would be able to lock in a substantial number of existing and future customers to its ecosystem, thereby creating a monopoly of sorts in the largest market for electric vehicles.As a refresher, NIO’s Battery Swap 2.0 stations can perform 312 automated battery swaps per day, with each swap taking place in under 3 minutes. The company is able to achieve this feat by eliminating the lift step required by the first-generation stations. These stations will begin to be deployed from April 2021, with NIO planning to build at least 500 Battery Swap 2.0 stations in China by the end of the current year.On the fundamental front, things are also brightening up for NIO. As an illustration, the company reported this month that it delivered 20,060 EVs in the first quarter of 2021, translating to annual growth of 423 percent. The company continues to ramp up the production capacity at the JAC-NIO facility. By the end of 2021, its annual production capacity is expected to cross 300,000 units. Another major anticipated development for NIO investors relates to the company’s much-hyped entry in the European market under the ambit of its Project Marco Polo."
All the good news and great quarter and expansion plans has not made the stock move so it is being manipulated heavily by Wall Street. Not sure what kind of more good news is needed to move the stock up?

On NIO's side, the company’s goal, which it has described as conservative, is to have 500 battery swap stations by the end of 2021.This is the largest so far, but not the only partnership of NIO’s in this space. A few weeks ago, NIO reached an agreement with another state-owned infrastructure company, Beijing Shoufa, to build stations in the Beijing area. NIO president Qin Lihong said on Thursday that they are aiming to add nearly 100 more third-party partners this year.The idea of battery swap stations is that consumers can drive into the station with an uncharged battery and have it automatically replaced by a fully charged one in just a few minutes. The 2.0 version of these allows drivers to complete the battery swap without leaving their car and can perform up to 312 swaps per day.A mass rollout of these stations is a key part of NIO’s BaaS strategy (battery as a service). With this model, customers do not purchase the battery with the car and own it, but rather pay a subscription fee to “rent” charged batteries and replace them as they become uncharged. By not including the battery, the initial purchase price of the vehicle is reduced by up to almost 20,000 USD. As more and more swap stations are deployed, the convenience gap between electric and petrol-fuelled vehicles could gradually disappear.NIO is not alone in the battery swapping business, nor did it invent it. Israeli start-up Better Place tried to develop the concept in collaboration with Renault (OTC:RNSDF) in 2007 without much success. Today, a handful of companies around the globe are trying to deploy such systems, like Blue Park Smart Energy, a competitor in China with government influence, or American start-up Ample, which has begun operating several such stations in California, catering for fleet vehicles.Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) started with the idea of battery swapping in 2013 but abandoned the program in 2016 in favour of its superchargers. At the time, it may have appeared like the right strategy given the limited amount of EV’s on the road. Superchargers are much more efficient than regular ones, achieving a range of up to 200 miles in 15 minutes, and they are smaller and much easier to deploy than battery swap stations. This has allowed Tesla to provide over 20,000 superchargers to its customers around the world. However, with EV presence increasing fast, the economies of scale may cause a shift in which is the most efficient of the two solutions.It remains to be seen what will happen with regards to the standardization of these battery swaps, as for now, customers can only swap batteries at their manufacturer’s station.Though not the creator of the technology, NIO appears to be moving fastest towards dominating what could be the future of EV refueling, and it could be shaping up a"
Bought another 100 shares just under 31. This and anything lower is a gift for the long term. The company has cash and is set up with a customer base. This is clearly the hedge funds dropping the market because they are #$%$ that their manipulation can no longer fly under the radar.

"The market does not like EV's at all. I am surprised regular auto companies can hold water, as they too have just as great a chip problem. This looks like a very solid company in a totally out of favor industry at the moment. I am a bit surprised, as with gas prices averaging $3/gallon, an ICE car getting 30 mpg would use 10 gallons, or $30 worth of gas to travel 300 miles, and average kwh cost would allow a 100 kwh hour battery that would take you 300 miles, only cost $10 to charge from empty and take you 300 miles, so cost of driving is one third the cost of an ICE at this point."

Let us all long remember this is the time to buy more shares long term if you believe in this company. I will have some funds ready in a day or two. So I will definitely will be adding to my position. This drop has nothing to do with Nio alone. It's the entire markets being affected right now. I will be adding sometime this week. At these prices what an amazing opportunity for everyone wanting more shares. No one will ever time the markets perfectly. All we can do is take advantage of the low prices as it dips. Sooner or later Nio along with all the EV's will rise up just as fast. I would hate to miss these opportunities to add more. Best of luck longs. We will be just fine long term. Also let us all remember a lot of us were in much lower so we are still very much in the profit zone. Do not listen to the bashers which does not even own shares. Long and strong!

Most retail longs in NIO are totally aware of what the shares are worth. It is a waste of time to think painting the ticker red is going to net any shares. They already took 30% hits and only added.

Question for people smarter than me: I’ve noticed that many EV companies in China are committing to build charging stations that allow for swaps of charged batteries for batteries needing to be charged. The implication is that each EV manufacturer has its own battery type. Is there a plan to standardize the batteries so that the EV market can leverage off the investments each of the EV companies is making in the charging stations?
Don’t sell your uncut diamonds! It is going to sparkle soon !
NIO is falling behind Li and Xpev lately. Is it b/c these two don't use Renesas for their chips? Does anyone know?
NIO is going after the Chinese luxury segment. The ET7 will probably be considered the most advanced EV ever made. Performance will rival a pure bred sports car costing 10s of thousands more

"I had written this 2 hours ago in response to someone whining about Wall Street not being fair: And now just to prove me right, Stock will close at almost exactly at $40-------------------------------------------------------Wall Street is not about fairness. It is about making money. They create bubbles from shady companies so that they can sell to the main street from higher prices. And they suppress good companies' stock prices while they are in the accumulation mode, snatching shares at low prices.Basically they are able to do whatever they want. They have so much money at their disposal that they can control the stock price to the cent as we see week after after at option expiration dates."
WAKE UP !!! NIO reported quarterly sales of $1.22 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.02 billion by 19.41 percent. This is a 528.63 percent increase over sales of $193.76 million the same period last year.

Nio clocked a total of 7,404 SUV sales in April — with the ES6 model selling the most at 3,302 vehicles, EC6 sales were 2,484 units and ES8 sales at 1,618 units, the report said. Xpeng Inc XPEV 1.56% made up for 7% of the all-electric SUV market in the month."

"REMEMBER ?JP Morgan calls NIO's Q1 results 'clean beat' during industry headwindsMay 1, 2021Despite the challenges faced by global car companies due to chip shortages, the Chinese electric car company NIO still delivered Q1 results that exceeded expectations. In JP Morgan's view, that was a clean beat and a surprise.NIO's unaudited earnings report showed that its revenue for the first quarter was RMB 7.98 billion yuan ($1.22 billion), beating market expectations of 6.65 billion yuan and up about 482% from a year ago."

We still stand a chance to finish the year around $50, but don't lose hope if that does not happen. Next year, 2022, should be NIO's year with chip shortage in the rear view mirror and many anticipated major catalysts coming to fruition. Please be patient, realistic and sensible. Wishing you all the best!"
"NIO offers so much and reminds me of Amazon. They bend backwards until they're established because they realize the competitive and unfavourable conditions when it comes to outside of China.Try gathering all the automakers and creating a pamphlet. Leave the company names out but show the vehicles,perks, and service. Everyone will pick the NIO in a blind survey. Because people want a quality product. If you compare NIO and it's product vs other top brands. In a blind survey they will pick NIO.Imo people are better off educating others about NIO. Because NIO already wins in terms of product. Just needs more publicity."

"Noway really isn't a big deal because Norway's population is 5.35M and only about 150K cars are sold annually. Seems like a waste of time, money and energy and efforts had be concentrated on higher population countries that sell way more cars annually. The add will be incremental."

The final nail in the coffin for many Nio stock investors has been the Chinese government’s move this year to half the subsidies it offered to buyers of electric vehicles.
"The difference between NIO dropping and CCIV, NKLA, FSR, GOEV dropping is that when the smoke and FUD clears NIO will be a $50 to $100 stock in 2021 and the other guys will all be under $10"
"NIO is pinned to $38 plus or minus. $38 is where they sold the secondary and where the cheats at Jeffries Investments put out their target, NIO will launch from $38. when the time comes. Jeffries flopped trying to scam shares from longs. NIO is 51% owned by retail longs. It will move when nobody expects it, just like last summer."
NIO future is too bright for NIO and NIO park!!!!!!!!$270 by EOY!!!!I believe!!!!NIO make me a millionaire now!!!!!

"Cathie Woods' ARK Innovation ETF Is Selling Off -- and It May Get Worse -- Barrons 12:24 PM ET 5/6/2021 The fund's top 10 holdings account for nearly half the portfolio. Tesla (TSLA) is its top holding at about 11% of assets, followed by Square (SQ) at 6.5%, Teladoc Health(TDOC) at 6.3%, and Roku(ROKU) at 5.5%. The rest of its top 10 consists of Zillow Group (Z), Zoom Video Communications (ZM), Baidu (BIDU), Shopify (SHOP), Spotify Technology (SPOT), and Exact Sciences (EXAS).Many of these stocks have tumbled as market leadership shifted from high-growth, high-multiple stocks to value and cyclicals. While the ETF offers exposure to many innovative areas of tech that may be great long-term bets, it's ailing as investors' appetite for risk cools off and crowded momentum trades reverse.Tesla, for instance, is down 22% in the last three months. Zoom, Zillow, and Baidu are off about 30%. Spotify and Exact Sciences are each down 25%. Teladoc is dragging the portfolio down too, losing 47% in the last three months, including a 21% slump since April 26.The ETF is still a giant with $21 billion in assets, making it one of the largest actively managed ETFs. But it's shedding assets fast; investors redeemed $770 million in shares over the last week and $866 million overall in the last month, according to FactSet."

Up 2.2% on insanely low volume. This is going to squeeze up soon. These small green days on low volume are the small quakes before the volcano explodes.
I can see Nio turning profitable within a few quarters...maybe even this quarter?!
"The current chip shortage is likely only a transitory factor. Although Nio’s deliveries fell by -2% month over month to 7,102 vehicles in April 2021, with sequential growth for May also likely to be limited, Nio recently indicated that the chip situation could get better around June or July. This means that delivery growth should pick up over the second half of the year, likely improving sentiment around the stock. Nio’s valuation also looks much more attractive, with the stock trading at just over 10x 2021 revenue – not unreasonable for a company that is projected to more than double sales this year and grow sales by another 60% in 2022, per consensus estimates. Longer-term growth could also hold up as Nio is expanding its geographic footprint, indicating that it would begin delivering vehicles in Norway from the fall of 2021. Moreover, we think Nio should hold its own in the Chinese EV space, despite mounting competition, given its wider product range versus rivals (Nio currently sells the EC6, ES6, ES8 vehicles), unique innovations such as battery swapping, and also due to its positioning as a lifestyle brand, with an emphasis on quality customer service."
"NIO's battery supplier CATL says it will release sodium-ion batteries around JulyMay 21, 2021Current power batteries are mainly lithium-ion, but the next generation of batteries with new materials is not far away.Robin Zeng, the founder of NIO and Tesla's battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), said at a shareholder meeting Friday that the company will release sodium-ion batteries around July this year.This means that power battery technology will see a major innovation. But with that, the price of the new batteries could be higher. Zeng said sodium-ion batteries are likely to be more expensive than lithium-ion batteries because they are a new concept.Last year, CATL built the 21C Innovation Lab in Ningde, Fujian province, with an investment of RMB 3.3 billion to focus on research and development of next-generation batteries, including lithium metal batteries, all-solid-state batteries, and sodium-ion batteries.The sodium-ion battery that Zeng says will be released soon could be from this lab. NIO's battery supplier CATL says it will release sodium-ion batteries around July-CnEVPost(Source: CATL)Sodium-ion batteries work mainly by moving sodium ions between positive and negative electrodes, similar to lithium-ion batteries.But because the electrode material used in sodium-ion batteries is mainly sodium, it is more abundant and cheaper than lithium.When lithium batteries are prevalent, a problem that cannot be avoided is also a growing concern - China's lithium resources are highly dependent on imports.Globally, the distribution of lithium resources is extremely uneven, with about 70% distributed in South America."

What exactly is the proxy vote about?
Chip Shortage will end just as NIO opens its one million car a year operation 12 times the size of Tesla
"NIO just overtook Tesla in China! Tesla’s second largest shareholder dumped 40% stake in Tesla last week!NIO was the best-selling brand in China's fast-growing all-electric SUV market in April, according to new data from the China Automotive Technology and Research Center. While Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling electric SUV in China in April, with 5,520 units sold, NIO's three electric SUV models sold a combined 7,404, enough for a 23% share of the market."
"Why NIO Stock Is Up TodayTesla lost a lot of ground in China in April, and that gave NIO an opportunity. What happenedShares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:NIO) were moving higher on Friday, after data showed that it beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on one key sales metric in China in April. As of 11 a.m. EDT today, NIO's American depositary shares were up about 6.9% from Thursday's closing price.So whatNIO was the best-selling brand in China's fast-growing all-electric SUV market in April, according to new data from the China Automotive Technology and Research Center. While Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling electric SUV in China in April, with 5,520 units sold, NIO's three electric SUV models sold a combined 7,404, enough for a 23% share of the market.A red NIO ES6, an upscale mid-sized electric SUV. WHILE NO SINGLE NIO OUTSOLD TESLA'S MODEL Y IN APRIL, COMBINED SALES OF THE SIMILARLY SIZED ES6 (SHOWN) AND CLOSELY RELATED EC6 WERE 5,786, TOPPING THE MODEL Y'S 5,520. IMAGE SOURCE: NIO.Of course, that data comes with an asterisk (or at least an excuse): The Model Y production line at Tesla's Shanghai factory was reportedly shut down for about two weeks in April, so supplies might have been tight.That said, demand might also have been a factor. Tesla's China sales fell by about 67% in April from March, as CEO Elon Musk's feud with the Chinese government in the wake of a series of accidents and protests sent many potential buyers to other brands. Now whatAuto investors who are inclined to dismiss the Tesla data should note that while Tesla managed to move 25,845 Shanghai-built vehicles in April, more than half of those (14,714) were exported. Clearly, the level of Chinese demand for Teslas is in question right now. That's bad news for the Silicon Valley carmaker's ambitious growth plans, but it seems to be giving NIO a nice opportunity to gain market share."
"Wholly freefall, Batman!!"
All I know is that buying at this price is a steal and you’ll make at least 100% gains this year. At least.
"NIO Norway highlights:- Operational September 2021- Starting with the ES8, followed by the ET7- Swap station 2.0, 4 in Oslo, then more in other cities- NIO House in Oslo, spaces in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Kristiansand- NIO Service Center Oslo, incl. Pick up, delivery and mobile service- Partnership with, among others, Adyen, BNP & AWS"
"Go listen to Bezos talk about the early days at Amazon. His point is the company is not the stock and the stock is not the company. By every measurement, NIO is getting better each quarter. That is all one needs to look at to gain confidence in holding, buying the dips, and laughing at all of these people bashing the stock for short term price fluctuation. Say what you will, but I firmly believe those who follow that simple strategy will build long term wealth. Good luck."
Moving up slowly is fine
"Construction of Hefei's Xinqiao Smart Car Industrial Park will start on April 29, and NIO's new plant will be included, a new report suggested."
"""This is world-changing""No. It's very cool in theory, but it's only for those who have this car. The world has not changed because of battery swaps on one model of car."
"I’ve been holding this stock a long time. In that time I’ve seen it lose up to half its value a couple of times, only to vigorously rally soon afterwards up to new ATHs. I see no reason why this is any different, and in fact I think it even more likely, as Nio is a much better company than it was back then. Do your own DD, if you believe in the company invest. If you don’t, don’t invest."
What an amazing earnings report! Proud to be a holder.
Great report long term looks outstanding for nio
"I would just like to say that I have been apart of the NIO train since July 2020, I have continued to add shares at every drop and am holding my healthy position for years to come. I have never been this bullish on a stock in my entire life and cannot wait for the European expansion so I can fly to Norway and see these beautiful vehicles in person. Remember to invest in long term companies that have real value. Nio in my opinion is a diamond in the rough and will dominate the EV market for years to come. With that I say, Nio long, Nio strong, and finally NIO TO THE MOON!"

Companies barely have enough batteries to produce EV let alone have stock pile to replace. Even if they recharge those battery it would require a large amount batteries that are always fresh and ready to be swap. Also the wait time of everyone waiting for their cars to be swap. The idea require alot of work to make it happen. Also batteries will soon evolve and sooner or later we would have super fast charging that we can so at home and the swapping station would become obsolete.
"Edison Yu is an analyst who works for the DB and last April in an investigative report he said that NIO's problem will be competition from large Chinese companies.""In a research report, Yu wrote that every major technology company is"" now planning to build at least some part of the electric vehicle. "" For example, Yu pointed out that Baidu, Foxconn, Huawei, and Xiaomi are among several companies getting into the Chinese electric vehicle market. "" Due to this ""problem"" there are large short positions in NIO, XPEV and LI, and the analysis is that they will not be able to compete.According to the ""analysts"" there are therefore several problems, the chip shortage, the competition in China and the expansion towards the EU."
BATTERY SWAP .. Tesla needs to license this advanced tech from NIO if they want to survive.Because NIO Battery Swap will be the international standard for safe and fast EV charging
"I love everything about NIO. I am so all in that’s it’s almost unbelievable. Absolutely primed for a strong surge in Q3 and Q4. There is so much I could write and have done in the past however I think there is something under the radar which could end up being a billions of dollars revenue stream. “NIO Life” internet shopping is going to be huge……….there are over 2 million subscribers to the NIO App and this weekend they went live with their own channel on Alibaba Platform. They manage to mix east and west which is something no Chinese company have managed to do successfully so far.GO NIO LIFE.And yes, always, always, for pity sake MUTE THE MUTTS."

NIO car are better designed than TSLA. NIO battery are better than TSLA NIO battery last longer than TSLA NIO battery can be charged in about 10 minutes or so. TSLA battery I believe it takes over 30 minutes.NIO has more kiosks to charge your batteries. TSLA has less.NIO allows you to purchase two batteries for your car. TSLA doesn’t.Not sure what other sheeet I left out.
we are being taken independently No Tesla buddy anymoreThis means the market is starting to recognize NIO as a separate entity not tied to Tesla and also capable of Increasing in value soon

It will have an annual capacity of 1 million vehicles and 100GWh of batteries"
Analyst Price Target on NIO$60.04 ▲ (75.15% Upside)Based on 10 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Nio in the last 3 months. The average price target is $60.04 with a high forecast of $81.00 and a low forecast of $38.80. The average price target represents a 75.15% increase from the last price of $34.28.
You can only buy and hold now when the stock has bottomed. Everyone knows the upcoming earnings will be bad. The only question is then - How Bad. I think NIO will trend down to high to mid $20's just before we find out what kind of quarter NIO had. And if its not a good quarter the stock easily could fall to low $20's - high teens.
"Look at all the news in the past 90 days. Other than a chip shortage that is slowing down production for a few months WHILE ALSO STOKING PENT UP DEMAND, there has been no bad news and a TON OF GOOD NEWS. Honestly I believe that any investor that is not snapping up shares today is not thinking or reading much about NIO at all. GLTA Longs"

SP should be 100 right now, so the last thing anyone should be doing is panicking or worse selling!"
"ET7 is one sweet technological advancement in the transportation category. Or any other category out there. I will be owning a NIO, hopefully soon. Anyone who sees and drives an ET7, will be fall in love. Audi, BMW, Mercedes will not compete, and especially when those European brands have near double sticker price.We are witnessing automotive history in the making. Once deliveries are near 300k per year with 2nd factory up and running. We will see $300 share price. And up!!!!!!No one will compete with NIO's cars or ecosystem."
Thank all that sells your stocks. Today I keep collections your shares at a very good discount
Everything red today. EV sector red. Chinese EV competitors red. NIO stayed green. If you know how good a sign this is...you bought more. Picked up another 22 shares today.
NIO will be over 50 in next 2 1/2- 3 months. Wallstreet. Will be factoring in their PE ration increases as well as the company still increasing their capacity.
The sp is just moving with the Nasdaq With this low volume it’s easy to tell
"Big picture still looks good, revenue, margins, brand, demand. Production capacity will improve… by the end of the year that’s what the market will be talking about and NOT the chip shortage (hundreds of cars short now per quarter). China wants a international luxury brand to call their own. This looks well positioned. if we get a lower cost NIO sedan model (via a new NIO “affordable” brand) it should expand NIO Power revenue in addition to more cars. More partnerships with companies like SINOPEC. Lots to look forward to. Oh almost forgot..autonomous driving developments!"

I could sell now and it would jump up $4 by closing.
"I have a request to all investors to keep calm. Long-term NIO is going to be 1 of the biggest companies in automotive industry. Todays valuations won't matter in couple of years when the SP will be trading above 100 or even 200. It quite easy to see their potential and of course time will tell who was right or wrong. I honestly believe in this company like in no other, also considering the need of change to more eco-friendly technologies Nio will surely take advantage of it. If you are wondering whether to buy or wait for the stock to drop 1$ maybe 2$, I am telling you, don't hesitate. Buy before the run up and keep believing in the company. Millioners are not made in a day. Btw I am 22 and I know that many people would like to get rich very fast but it's just not like that, most of those that are risking their money to trade or play with options or margins are loosing, and most of long-term intelligent investors are winning. It's as simple as that. Keep strong!"
"According to Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu's team, NIO's delivery guidance implies that second-quarter sales could range from RMB 8.15 billion to 8.5 billion, which is broadly in line with the team's estimate of RMB 8.26 billion and above the market consensus estimate of RMB 7.92 billion."
"By end of year predicting there will be at least 100K ET7 preoorders. When that number officially is released it will be game, set, match in favor of longs."
Panic selling going on. Great buying opportunity!
Already moving up higher and once summer starts and shortages get reduced more and more NIO's will be made and sold. The company and stock is still strong and the popularity and attention continues to rise.
"EV technology will bring the end of Petro-Dollar system and thus posing a big threat to US's hegemony over the world. US was able to print trillions because it forced the world to trade oil only in dollars. This created a demand for Dollars, which will disappear once oil is no longer needed. Scary times. hard to guess how US will respond to all this. It may become even more aggressive but China seems unstoppable and China is slowly building bridges to Europe, which may make US more and more irrelevant.Feedback appreciated."
Something fishy happening in the markets!!!!!!
Hopefully this will bounce back today. If not we are going down big. Not buying yet.

"Forget revenue at the stage.

They have vehicles, a huge fan base and more buzz than a beehive. they have an awesome new ET7 coming. a huge market and they look like the Apple of EVs . $40 is free money here this one will see $400 someday sooner than anyone thinks"

I would not be surprised if $NIO will be red today or just more or less 1 or 2 % green despite the great earnings and future expand plans.
"Motley Fool has released another positive news on 3 HYPERGROWTH STOCKS and NIO is one of them. Below is the snippet: “NIO: Implied upside of 53%A third hypergrowth stock that Wall Street professionals believe could soar over the next year is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer NIO (NYSE:NIO). Following the company's recent swoon, the Street is forecasting upside of as much as 53%.The ""Why NIO?"" question is pretty simple to answer: EVs are the future of the auto industry, and China is the largest auto market in the world. By 2035, the Society of Automotive Engineers of China has predicted that half of all auto sales will be new-energy vehicles, with roughly 95% of those being EVs. The Chinese EV market is ripe for the picking, which should allow NIO to secure a piece of a really large pie.NIO has been successfully ramping up its production, as well. After delivering a little over 20,500 EVs in all of 2019, the company increased deliveries to 43,728 in 2020. If not for chip shortages, which are hampering the entire automotive industry at the moment, NIO would probably be delivering 9,000 to 10,000 vehicles a month at the moment. Even with the chip issues, NIO's revenue is expected to more than double its sales to $5.2 billion this year.The company also deserves serious credit for its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) operating model, which should be a long-term operating margin and loyalty driver. Buyers who sign up for the program can receive replacement or upgraded batteries in the future. In turn, they pay a monthly fee to NIO and receive an upfront discount on their vehicle. NIO is effectively trading away some near-term margin for considerably higher BaaS margins and loyalty over the long run.Then again, a $59 billion valuation for a company that's delivered 95,701 vehicles since its inception seems a bit excessive. Although it's done well with its early stage ramp up and has laid to bed any funding concerns, next-big-thing technologies like EVs won't be without hiccups. Between increasing competition and a steep learning curve, a wait-and-see approach might be prudent, even with Wall Street's aggressive price target.”Go NIO."

"chinese electric vehicle startup Nio Inc. reported a narrower first-quarter loss, while warning the global chip shortage will keep a lid on deliveries."
The only people who should panic in a stock market sell- off of are those who shouldn't be in the market to begin with. Who are they?People who invested in stocks to meet short terms goals like a down payment on a house or high school seniors college tuition.Or folks who are too fearful and anxiety - prone to ride out occasional turn downturns without capitulating and selling.The rest of us - those invested to meet long-term goals and able to buy the dips or at least hang on and reinvest dividends should take a deep breath and stick with the program.

"It seems to me that Cathie Woods and her ARK analyst team may believe NIO cars can *only* be charged by battery swap. That's not accurate. Don't they know that NIO cars can also be charged at a charging station? For anyone who has been to China's larger cities, with their vast landscape of high rise apartment buildings, it's clear that having both charging options is a HUGE advantage for NIO."
Looking at earnings NIO has about $23 value hidden in every share. Moreover they may own the charging business in China too.
great company at a great price. 50+ coming soon

The inevitable Short Squeeze is on the way. NIO is way oversold 
"This is nothing but a falling knife. I am shorting this all the way down. This company loses money left and right. It’s down 50% from its highs, hasn’t made a new high in 3 months. Making lower highs and lower lows. Trading below 200 day moving average. Avoid this falling knife at all costs."
it crushed 43 line like anything.. now its time to make it touch 44 for the day. if we make 44 today tomorrow it will touch 47 or 48. by earning it will be over 48..lets push it before bears come after
One thing all auto companies have to face besides the chip shortage is the cost of steel. It had gone up a lot with all other commodities. This will hit the bottom line of all of them.

"NIO's lifestyle brand opens flagship store on Alibaba's TmallPhate ZhangMay 14, 2021NIO's lifestyle brand opens flagship store on Alibaba's Tmall-CnEVPostMany people know NIO as an electric car company targeting the high-end market, but few know that the company also has big ambitions in lifestyle products.NIO's lifestyle brand, NIO Life, announced Friday that it has opened a flagship store on Alibaba's Tmall platform in order to ""share its joyful lifestyle to more people.""Alibaba reported on Thursday that its annual active consumers in China's retail market reached 811 million, with the average annual spending of users on Tmall, an e-commerce platform for corporate merchants, and Taobao, a platform for individual merchants, at RMB 9,200.Founded in 2018, NIO Life is an important means for NIO to build relationships with users beyond the car. By the end of April, NIO Life had sent out more than 3 million items, covering eight categories: apparel and accessories, travel luggage, technology products, home products, car life, car toys, hotel experience and food. As an early investor of NIO and Tesla, 110-year-old asset management firm Baillie Gifford had been optimistic about the social e-commerce potential of the NIO App and expected that NIO Life's annual sales would reach RMB 200 billion in 2030."

"The Global Times, China's closest major media organization to the state, published a scathing review of Tesla's earnings on Tuesday morning, stating that ""despite record earnings"" for the quarter, ""Tesla's sales in China are expected to drop sharply in the coming months due to a public relations crisis that has put the image of the otherwise popular brand at serious risk""."

Not sure when the bottom will be, but looking forward to jumping back in."
Who can explain why NIO' patterns follow so much TESLA' s ones? Thanks for your abswers. I am so sad for all Longs believing in NIO's future. Let's be strongers than all those shorters.

"BREAKING: China's battery swap national standard drafted by firms including NIO to go into effect Nov. 1Phate ZhangMay 10, 2021 The lack of uniformity in standards, considered the most important obstacle to the development of the battery swap model of electric vehicles in China, is now expected to be alleviated.China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) earlier this month approved the National Standard for Battery Swap Safety Requirements for Electric Vehicles (GB/T 40032-2021), making it the industry's first mandatory standard governing the development of the battery swap model.The standard, drafted by companies including NIO, Beijing Electric Vehicle Co Ltd, and Geely, will come into effect on Nov. 1 this year, specifying safety requirements, test methods, and inspection rules for battery swappable electric vehicles.The SAMR said the standard is the first basic national standard in the battery swap field in China's automotive industry, which will help improve the safety level of electric vehicles using battery swap technology in terms of mechanical strength, electrical safety, environmental adaptability, and other aspects to ensure the safety of battery swap electric vehicles. The process for the development of the standard, released by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on May 10, shows that it began pre-study in November 2018, drafting in February 2020, and soliciting public comments in March 2020."

Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable noncontrolling interest to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders was RMB 354.5 million or USD 54.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.

ET7 going to sell like hotcakes!!!!!! long and strong. 3k shares

I feel so sorry for those that are going to short this today. Rebound will be quicker than you think.
30M shares already changed hands today.if you compare this to these daily volumes lately 45-50-60m... it looks positive

"So KenC, what do you plan to do with your 30,000 NIO shares when May 22 comes around? Will wait for Q3 or Q4? Hold longer?

I do remember you criticizing the battery swap concept (could be wrong). Nio in 1-5 years as a company?Chinese equities vs U.S equities and there valuations and future? Did you ever end up buying a NIO vehicle?"
I have shares at an avg of $10.52.I was on top of the roof whn NIO crossed $60....Did not give up even whn it scaled back to @31 ...and now WE are back to WINNING WAYS...So exited again..!!I held for 3 months on the downtrend coz I hv complete faith in NIOs prospects.
this is a great long term investment opportunity at current prices. patience will be rewarded. 50+ coming soon
NIO has reached the bottom bands in oversold territory causing a massive buying opportunity at $32! In six months from today you will wish you mortgaged your house and bought more NIO!
so who do you trust today? the bloke on this board telling you to sell everything or the investment banks that are buying millions of nio for a very handsome return indeed.
"A few economists I work with, did a rough audit to see what it would cost to get to where NIO is in China as opposed to the EU or USA. In the USA NIO would already have a$150 Billion dollar enterprise value. NIOs lead in specific technologies and supply chain connections may be financially out of reach for VW, based on EU pricing and labor costs in maintaining their ICE business at the same time."

"Tesla's April Sales From China Were Mostly Exports5/12/21, 6:40 AMSHANGHAI -- Tesla Inc. exported most of the cars produced at its Shanghai factory in April, raising questions about the strength of demand for its electric vehicles in China after a run of adverse publicity.The EV maker sold 11,671 locally built Model 3 and Model Y cars in China last month, while exporting a further 14,174, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The association confirmed Wednesday that a wholesale figure of 25,845 published the day before combined local sales and exports. It was the first time it broke down the sales that way.Some analysts have questioned whether there would be enough demand in China to absorb most of the Shanghai's factory's planned output of 500,000 vehicles a year. While a portion of the company's Chinese production could be earmarked for export, the bulk of buyers would likely need to come from China -- the world's largest auto market -- for the factory to be sustainable. Demand from the rest of Asia is relatively weak and Tesla is planning new production plants in Europe and the U.S., its other main markets.By separating out export numbers in April, however, it is clear that Tesla might not have the commanding lead over rival EV makers in China that the wholesale data previously implied.In some cases, analysts have mistakenly assumed the wholesale figures reflect Tesla's sales in China."

get out of doge as soon as you can and buy nio
This is just how the cycle works. 60$ - over positive and wise investor taking profits. Then correction 45$ - usual investor starting to worry. Further collapse due to panic selling 30$ - many of inexperienced investors starting to sell because of panic. Next comes rebound because of the smart ones playing it and buying the fear. And after this many will follow as they will regain positivity! The answer is you should probably be a buyer here. I am not a fortune teller so I will not promise that the Sp won't drop another 1-2 dollars but it seems very unlikely as it is already in the oversold territory. Good luck to everyone! Next time maybe you will get it right.
"WOW NIO, is the best stock in History, it just hit 32!"
Like what I said. Lots of BUYS yesterday mates.Janitor OUT...in under 5 mins.I normally don’t eat breakfast
Thumbs up if you did NOT sell any shares today!
With elon dumping crypto …. a lot of crypto buyers will come back to nio now …. especially at this price. If you are short....you better cover first thing because this is skyrocketing in the morning.
"It's almost mind blowing to see so many people investing in crypto. That proves that everyone looking to get rich fast forgetting the fundamentals of investing. And when the crash will come most of them they don't have the financial backing to average down, they will be WIPED OUT. It's very difficult to stop being a trader but do it with some solid companies that in up and down days they give you couple dollars to profit. And if you get stuck for a while you know that you holding a great company and not a balloon ready to pop at anytime."
"Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto"
If anyone thinks NIO is a dump just look at there cars there the next Tesla. And do the math on how many people live in China lol even better when they expand to the west even more sales.  nio to 300$
Investor place is posting negative articles... you know what that means? NIO is about to go up again.
What a come back today...how strong is NIO? VERY! And as always Enjoy 
-10% premarket to this is a great day and put the shorts in there place !!
"Why is the NIO going down daily, many times over 5%, despite analysts price predictions and all the good news?"
I think the sell off is over nowWhen we get some chip shortage news this is gonna fly
I just hope will have enought power to get through the Ishimoku cloud. If not the sp will certainly drop again. Of course I dream NIO will ignore this cloud. Go NIO.
I think today will be the high of the week. It always goes done 4% on earnings followed by a 10%-20% jump the next week. Fridays are always a sell before the weekend event. So... if the upside is already factored into the earnings. 42-44 today. 42-43 Friday. Next week 48.

"Adding income streamsNIO also offers a battery-swap subscription service that customers can join for fast battery swapping as a way to ""recharge."" It recently announced plans to expand that service in China, which should help grow the EV market in general as charging and swapping infrastructure becomes more accessible. And in a sign of another way to boost recurring income, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has said it is coordinating with NIO to allow Mach-E owners to use the NIO charging network in China."
NIO will end the year over $120Wall St knows it and wants your shares
"I’m reading and hearing conflicting reports about Baillie Gifford. Did they recently buy or sell some NIO shares? If so, how many shares?"
The main problem at NIO is that there are over 1.5 billion shares and it is a plaything in the hands of short investors.A reasonable control would be between 200 and 500 million shares.I only see one way that is the repurchase of shares and their amortization by NIO but today it is unfeasible.
if shorting became illegal this stock would literally go to the moon

"YOu know if NIO was an American company, this will be over $120 by now."

"I'm a firm believer that NIO will make you rich long term, however I broke even holding since november of last year averaging down. It was just too hard to watch NIO being flat for such a long time while all these kids are zooming by in the fast lane in the crypto market. I sold everything I had in NIO about 10k worth and switched it into Dogecoin and Ethereum classic, I know it's a risk, but the money was extra anyways and it's outside of my 401k investments which are a little more secure. Just want to hear your opinions, there was alot of good news in that period of time but no real solid uptrend since it hit in the 60's, and i understand that the hedge guys are trying to get our shares for cheap and so on and so forth, but I'm kind of looking for some of these tantalizing returns, and when you read up on the crypto the whole smart contracts behind Ethereum makes alot of sense cost reduction wise. The stock market just isn't making alot of sense, with win after win we should be going up for NIO, but I guess I am seeing the dollar losing it's value."
"Here's the Key to NioLooks like the third time is a charm, and the charts have improved.By BRUCE KAMICH Apr 26, 2021 | 12:15 PM EDTStocks quotes in this article: NIOWe reviewed the charts of Nio Inc. (NIO) earlier this month on April 6 and wrote that, ""We have been successful so far avoiding the long side of NIO. Prices have held the $35 area twice in March, so that is the level for the bulls to defend. A break of this support zone could open the way to declines in the $25 area, according to the Point and Figure chart.""Prices have held $35 three times and that is the chart. In this daily bar chart of NIO, below, we can see that prices have successfully held the $35 area the past two months. Prices are turning upward and are currently testing the declining 50-day moving average line. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows the beginning of new firmness and tells me that buyers of NIO have become more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to a cover shorts buy signal last month and is edging closer to the zero line and an outright-buy signal. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/3b2e83ba-f26d-3d86-876d-85513670b008/here-s-the-key-to-nio.html"

Some of these bashers are in moms basement alternating between Fan Dual and chokin the chicken
"Ignore the day traders and the shorts. They are not going anywhere, true longs in the other hand they know what they hold. NIO made a lot of people wealthy and will do it again in even bigger scale. The few with the patience will be rewarded again the rest they will be looking from the outside."
"Seriouslly tho, Nio has already went up way too much already. Any higher will just be way too optimistic. There are way too many people who bought this in the single digit that can keep selling and selling. Other stock like Li ans Xpeng IPO at around $15. So the chance of selling on those stock is lower which will recover faster then Nio."
Today looks like is the final REVERSAL DAY in reaching $67 within 3 months. Best positioned EV company. Go NIO.
"21% margins on 20,000 cars a month Jan 1 Thats why longs get rich and day traders get evicted"
"Everyone is selling EV's NIO is selling the best EV with a ""Lifesyle"" to go with it"
America finally decides to invest in infrastructure that will allow them to transition into new wealth creation.But China did this decades ago. Amazing.
"Nio has already completed more than two million battery swaps to date in China, having now sold more than 100,000 of its ES8, ES6 and EC6 electric cars."
I still believe we may hit 35 today
"As electric vehicles continue to widely proliferate in China and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) appears to be losing its momentum in the Asian country, Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock certainly has a great opportunity."

"What technical analysis could predict those charts?What fundamental's analysis could predict tanking on any good news?We either have to hold for years or do casino trading. Day-to-day and week-to-week results are not supported by logic or knowledge in this era.And for those who say Nio is overvalued, what do you think of Dogecoin, Tesla, GME?"
I think the revolution started by NIO in China will explode... If SAIC will use NIO’s infrastructure this is huge news!Blue sky is coming!
"China is about to catch up and possibly surpass the US in space race as well with the latest landing on Mars. Pretty soon this huge discrepancy between US and Chinese stocks will disappear, Tesla having 10 times the market-cap of NIO etc."
"The fundamental story for NIO is exciting, it has a dominant EV space presence in China and will sell at least 100K high class vehicles by the end of 2021, the innovative battery swapping business and market penetration in Europe starting by Norway will position it to be the leader in EV worldwide ahead of Tesla. The stock will be valued in 300s soon. That's the dream that is being sold to Bag Holders, the reality is in Hard Ca$h, the stock is in free fall and the company is overvalued in a saturated market, it went from 68 to 32 and still falling, the Communist Party of China stole your money, so you either keep dreaming or save what is left of your money and sell"
"Opinion: Should you buy Nio stock? The company may be light on profits, but it’s heavy on momentum."
The only correction NIO is going to see is back to $45 ++ targets NIO is oversold and way undervalued.
101% confident on NIO to hit expectation from analyst.... See you at $60
the banks are buying follow the smart money
NIO opens at $41. Close at $44 plus tomorrow
"All I see is shorts spamming. Not a single person this week, or ever, has provided any fundamental criticism. When you're paid to spam, all you're good for is getting reported for spam. I've been a long in many winners over the years because I had conviction in the company & their products/services. These include $TSLA, $NIO, $ROKU, $AMD, $JD just to name a few. Every single one I had conviction and have profited in hundreds to thousands of percentages with each. $XPEV is no different for me. The market momentum in the past month or so is driven by unfounded fear...this week's knee jerk selling due to already known inflation is disproportionate to the concern. EV stocks have gained popularity from last year as many new investors had fomo. That money moved to new viral crypto gambles this year as institutions pulled strings to make profits from all of their own losses from those viral plays they missed out on. So they have been driving the prices down in the EV sector for months to cheapen the price, knowing full well the adoption of EVs in China is going to be absolutely tremendous. In the next few weeks, you'll see filings by many hedge funds that have picked up millions of shares of XPEV and NIO. Every MM knows 5-10x upside to both of these stocks, as they both had great earnings this quarter with plenty of cash on hand, higher deliveries every month, and increased revenue. The entire market moved in sync today to bring down the prices as overblown fear was the catalyst, but the VIX sunk more than everything. People have liquidated from crypto and that money is going to also enter the stock market after learning how a couple of viral tweets doesn't just fly you to the moon, but can also bring you crashing down even quicker. Tech stocks have been overly punished in general. XPEV specifically had even indicated today they had already taken steps to allocate parts to minimize any disruption to production. Recent delivery numbers prove that XPEV is achieving that goal. EV stocks will come back very strong and these prices are a gift for all those that have been looking for a long entry. Blood is in the streets. Every hedge fund is buying. So should you. Keep buying. Keep holding. Until 2025+."

"After Selling Nio Stake In Q4, Hillhouse Capital Buys Shares Of EV Stock In Q15/18/21, 10:43 AMMay 18, 2021 11:43 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsNio, Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares were sought after by institutional investors in the first quarter in an apparent bid to capitalize on a pullback in the electric vehicle stock. What Happened: Asia-focused private equity firm Hillhouse Capital bought 127,000 shares of Nio in the first quarter, a 13F filing by the firm revealed. Hillhouse's stake in Nio at the end of the quarter was valued at $4.958 million.Incidentally, the private equity firm sold off its position in Nio in the fourth quarter.In the third quarter of 2020, the firm held 2.412 million shares of Nio, valued at $51.18 million.Hillhouse also bought 658,595 shares of Nio's Chinese EV peer XPeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) in the first quarter. The stake was valued at $24.05 million. The firm had no position in XPeng in the fourth quarter.Related Link: Germany Could Be Nio's Next Stop After Norway Foray, Reports SayWhy It's Important: Nio and XPeng are two prominent players in the growing Chinese EV market. These companies have capitalized on the momentum with product lineups, particularly with respect to technology and customer service.Both Nio and XPeng are planning overseas expansion. XPeng has already started exporting its vehicles to Norway, while Nio recently announced its entry into Norway by setting up an office and service infrastructure in the European country.Nio and XPeng are likely to benefit from the acceleration that is expected in EV adoption. If these companies can match their vision with execution, in all likelihood, their shares could emerge as attractive investment options."

I've been vaccinated.I went to Wal-Mart today and didn't wear a mask.It was wonderful
Why still under 40 ?
"How time passes .. not so long ago, 12 month low was 1,19$. It's now at 3,18$ and will be wiped with the 6's in about 2 weeks, slowly ramping up to the 30's within a few months. This consolidation phase is amazing for all early investors looking for steady long term growth. At some point in time, it will snap out of consolidation and could potentially double in no time. And the next time around, fundamentals will be much much stronger, which will greatly help Nio maintain its value. Giant in the making."
"I have been an investor since 13-14 but lately i hate that xpeng and li are making bigger moves , but on the otherhand they have fallen more last 3 months ..i dont know anymore"
This is a short squeeze my friends! Hedge funds a fuming the wanted 27 but they couldn’t get in! No one is selling! Nio investors got those diamond hands! Hedges will have to by on top now and this will rocket!
Coming soon NIO EF9.
20 here we come. and once the Nasdaq corrects (it has to) back to 9500-11500 range Nio will see a low of $17. Thats where i buy more THEN IT EXPLODES back up in the 20 30 40 50 60 70 ++. But this technical event must happen before we move higher....so stop asking why it moving lower. Look at the Nasdaq 1 year chart and you tell me it isnt overinflated.
What happens when there are 10 million NIO vehicles in the road that need to swap batteries? How many extra batteries need to exist for that to work? Batteries are such a scarce resource at this point in time. How many cars would Tesla be able to sell right now if they had to provide swappable battery support?
"Nio will be a cash cow in 5 yrs going at this rate. We hvnt even see the real economies of scale yet and the gross margin and vehicle margins are these excellent. When nio finally get to 1m car sale, oh boy. Let it rain let it rain let it rain."
Guess I am buying more tomorrow
"Nio grabbed a 23% electric SUV share in April, compared with Tesla’s 17%, CnEVPost reported — citing the CATRC data. Nio clocked a total of 7,404 SUV sales in April — with the ES6 model selling the most at 3,302 vehicles, EC6 sales were 2,484 units and ES8 sales at 1,618 units, the report said. Xpeng IncXPEV 1.56% made up for 7% of the all-electric SUV market in the month."
"In order to be bullish on NIO. You must be bullish on China. And seeing how the U.S only now focuses on infrastructure investments that China did years ago shows me the U.S is lagging. NIO needs to succeed. The battery swap infrastructure and technology. Along with NIO global branding will succeed, but it doesn't need to in order for NIO to become profitable in less than 2 years.EV and new energy are methods of generating wealth that the EU and China have shifted towards years ago. Only now the U.S has finally decided to put a large investment into this market. The problem is that China is leading in patents for new technology than the U.S by multiple folds. The infrastructure bill you see now with the Democrats is good imo. You don't have to agree with how the money to supplement it is arranged or with it at all. But it's here, and it will happen.China already started this decades ago and the blueprints have been shown in Xi Jinpings 2025,2035, goals. So china has the head start that the U.S does not. Thus allowing China to capitalize on these untapped markets unlike the U.S. China will not make the same mistakes other rivaling superpower powers during there time because China learned. China has already done what the U.S is planning to do now decades ago. This is why instead of defaulting to gasoline, they opted in for EV and new energy infrastructures that scale along with new markets. So I am very bullish on China. If this does not succeed, then China fails. So far, it seems as if China is winning."
"Will we see the 20’s ? I invested pretty much my entire 401k into NIO at 49.75, my stress level is through the roof right now, please someone tell me what to do !"
"Attention All Longs , put your sell order in $1000.00 a share good to cancel , we unite and stick together !!!! We will be there then 1000 shares would be a million 2 !!! We need to Roast Shorts !!!! please I beg you all do it now , forget about the share price now !!!!"

Not giving any of my shares. I’m holding strong. If its going down more I will buy more simple as that. Fundamentals have not changed remember guys.
"The Greatest have made mistakes. NIO's first was to get us accustomed too soon to too much brilliance, day after day, and against all odds. When I bought NIO, my sell date was not May 13th, 2021. Therefore I am holding. See you all there, my fellow future NIOnaires."
"+15% today, great squeeze ahead !!!"
Many tech companies are falling .. Make money Grab NIO with $7Billion in cash and the BATTERY SWAP patent that will be used in every country

NIo holding up much better than the other EV companies. Could bottom be in?
"I would like to buy more nio but we are only at the start of the correction. I'll wait and see, maybe maybe $25 is possible"
"One way to protect your shares is to use cash accounts. Margin accounts using margin will allow your brokerage to lend your shares. There’s nothing you can do about it. It’s in the statement/agreement you signed when opening your account. If you need to, transfer your shares into a new non-margin account then it will be protected. Don’t let the short positions ruin the forward momentum. Call your brokerage and verify what I posted but this what mine told me. Protect your hard earned money and don’t let the shorts win an inch. The bearish hedge funds sentiments are reversing. We can’t control them but WE CAN CONTROL RETAIL SHORTS!Blue Skies AHEAD!"
"Remember, set a stop limit sell for $50.00 - it all helps push the price up :D"

Bloomberg now: China's economy continues strengthening.
The company is also reportedly contemplating whether to deploy its battery-as-a-subscription model and power swapping services in Europe. It has found big success with these two in the Chinese market. It is also fleshing out other key details such as distribution.
"I have never witnessed more naive and more dmb ""investors"" than $Tsla shareholders, especially the fanatics in america.While Elon is trying to produce high quality in China – still failing especially in opposition to $NIO s superior quality – for Chinese people, he sells (more) garbage plastic wannabe tin cans to american people, to the same people, giving him their money to burn it down like Joker.Elon himself is suffering under a Neurodevelopmental disorder and so do his fanatics, spreading lies about especially $NIO since months, because they are aware of TSLA s failing upscaling process, we are witnessing with all the quality, security and service issues and because they are aware of $NIO s superiority on all spheres.Elon musk is betraying american investors and potential TSLA customers and they are giving him thankfully their money additional to that .Reminds me of Trevor milton, who betrayed the $NKLA shareholders with a 3 D Model and who took all their money and presented a build solar panel, for him, paid by investors money.Extreme bad news for $Tsla and the outcome will kill all your portfolios soon, only $nio has the intellectual and management capacitys to upscale accurate, as we witness by now, and only $NIO has with that the potential to become a multi trillion dollar ev tech data lifestyle luxury products selling social commerce (NIO app has already more than 6 million users, back in 2018 there were only 100000) tech company by its fundamentals.Sell TSLA and buy $NIO, thank me on 5 years with kissing my nts in one of our NIO millionaire Club houses"

"Traders who make money and actually know how to invest notice facts like NIO's debt to equity ratio (45.6%) is considered high. Its better than VW, GM and F ,, forget about basket cases like CCIV /LCID and FSR which own nothing and have no capital to work with"
Hello $35.00 ++
"Think cold, more than 112 million shares were sold/bought today, do you think the big funds would buy garbage or throw money away?"
it's going down the same way as the whole tech sector.but the whole tech went up faster yesterday than NIO..
"NIO's battery swap is going to implode in the future when the charging networks continue to become as common and fast in charging as. the gas. stations. NIO is. going. to. stuck with abandoned. swap stations and. wasted all the invesents $, #$%$ the shareholders $ away. For now, it sounded like a great story."
"looking at various sources, it is very likely that chip shortage ll be solved by summer! in fact soon after summer, chip industry ll face overproduction issues!"

I think what's happening here is that musk says bitcoin is to expensive and inefficient a sell off of all crypto happens almost mediately and the robots kick in make Ng the market drop after all it makes no sense the market has not opened so no one can sell a thing but yet the market is falling must took his 700 million profit and then says bitcoin isn't good enough now expect the market to be down for weeks the world needs to stop following one man and his word it gives an unrealistic distribution of power

"NIO (NIO.US) launches joint construction plan for the green island in the Paracel IslandsNIO (NIO.US) launches joint construction plan for the green island in the Paracel IslandsThis article is from: Zhitong Finance NetworkZhitong Finance APP learned that on May 11, NIO (NIO.US) launched a plan to co-build green islands in the Paracel Islands to promote the development of clean energy on islands. It is reported that the Paracel Islands are the largest islands in the South China Sea by land and are under the jurisdiction of the city of Sansha, Hainan province. Through the joint construction of the Green Island, Weilai supplied a batch of smart electric vehicles to Sansha City, and invested in the construction of charging and storage facilities, in line with the new energy layout on the island, thus forming the formation of solar energy. , wind, tidal power generation and energy batteries. The entire clean energy chain, including energy storage, charge cells and electric vehicle travel, is a closed circuit.So far, Weilai has fallen 4.46% before the market, to $ 32.80."
I just grabbed another 300 shares of NIO. I'll hold on until 100 a share. Go NIO
"Nio ET7 pre-order numbers coming soon, then, game over!"
"the problem with retail investors, they never put money before the news! they want to invest in a company that makes billions and realising the fact that that time it's too late! same with NIO, I'm sure many will watch the nio progress without investing and get in when it's become real deal and put  and cry !"

"NIO's PT raised by Mizuho to $65.00 and reiterated ""Buy"". Many new PT to come after smashing earnings. JMO. Shortage=Short term/shortsighted; Earnings=Long term. It is inevitable at this point that this company won't become a monster."
"classic, when everyone climb 5-10% up on good days, NIO does 1%. on bad days everyone goes down 2%, NIO does also 2% "
We need to break 34.66 ....cmon!
All this better be worth it 3 years from now.
"I had a gut feeling a month ago when NIO was $62, that it would go down as a correction. I ignored my instincts and stayed long. If I had sold then and bought back in today I would have doubled my holding. Never again. After such a big rise there was bound to be a decline. Same for most stocks. I still think NIO is the best company to invest in"
Shorts must cover on Monday or they will lose a lot of money
tomorrow when Nasdaq will be +0.7% that will go 0.4% up and that would make me leave that stock forever
"NIO will blast to 3-digits SP, only when sales numbers will double from the current levels. Having said that, NIO completely laying out the road for that to happen this year by Q4! The SP will double by Q3 and by Q1, 2022 NIO will be in the 3-digits SP."

someone wanted to sell his 78k shares $34.50.. ok DONE. you don't need it
bought a couple more shares yesterday! #longterm
only one reason why nio keep going down is because the big money for smart money wants to buy this. Cheap

"Nio’s fundamentals have never changed. Only positive news coming out. Bigger and better news than any other automotive company at the moment. Not only speaking about the EV sector either. Nio said they are going to Norway, and they went to Norway. Nio said they are building battery swap stations and they are building battery swap stations. Nio said they are building a massive plant in China and they are going to do exactly that. They are producing more cars and there technology is only getting better. These guys are giving Tesla a run for their money. I don’t think people realize that Nio has a patent for their battery swap stations. This means a steady stream of income and other car companies will have to pay Nio if they wish to use this technology. And in my very own opinion battery swap stations will be THE WAY. I love everything about this company from the core. They do everything they say they are going to do and more. Haven’t let me down yet and with the more research I do on a weekly basis I begin to love this company and their fundamentals so much more."

Hedge funds need to be regulated like mutual funds. They have been manipulating stocks for ages now
This week add another 800 shares Holding at least till 2023Nio milionners holding long
"Actually, the price after earnings depends heavily not that much on the company's performance but rather on how the analysts want to manipulate the stock.If they want to buy it again low, even if the company does great, they will find some made up excuse or some insignificant negative detail and write about this again and again. If they want to pump it because they already have it, even if the earnings aren't as good as expected, they will find everything that looks good and promote that.That's why it is unrealistic to try to imagine this kind of short term moves, even if you are great both in the fundamentals and technical analysis.But, on the long term that manipulation doesn't count much and the company will get what it deserves."

"Looked up nio in the dictionary,only description said was “great buy”"
HERE IS THE MONEY MAKING STRATEGY: 1st. Nio stock is now in a range from $30 to $50. So what i did was sell May21-$30 puts and collected a $2000 premium and i sold May21-$50 covered calls and collected a $3000 premium. My $5000 is safe if NIO stock stays in this range by May 21st. This is the way folks with this stock.
NIO will own the Battery Swap industry World WideThats why they want your shares

Worthless Day Traders are accelerating plunge into bankruptcy with Crypto
BUY THE DIPS!! $XPEV $TSLA $NIO
"Many people are being manipulated to short and sell this stock. The volume is 17 million here where Xpev only has 3 million and almost in the green. It's not that Nio is worse now, but many people get in and the big ones may want to take advantage of it."
Shorts will lose all they have! I’m not sure who promised them the stock going to 20!!
"A friend placed an order on a Tesla back in December and has not received it. The demand is unbelievable for EVs.NIO is not entering a new market in Norway to not deliver EVs. They will be resolving the chip shortage before we know it. Again, this is a great opportunity to buy and hold."
At 25 I will buy in
".NIO is now building EV infrastructure with Sinopec China's 30,000 location fueling Giant .This collaboration could strengthen the company's advantages on infrastructure, costs and services, attracting more customers.Bullish"
Market cap still bigger than Ford. Completely nonsensical
BREAKING NEWS. TSMC and INTEL can meet chip shortage by JUNE!!!!!!!!
All the market is redStart buying backBargain prices
More bad news for Tesla in China. Tesla cars are banned from parking inside sensitive areas. Quality problems with delivered cars. No battery swap model. China is pushing another competitor out of the country. That means more cars from Nio to come to the local market. Wish I could have bought more NIO for this bargain at the moment.
UPDATE 2-Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio launches its 1st overseas store in Norway Source:reuters
What is the June 3 meeting all about? New shares authorization?
Just forget about TESLA and come to $NIO. Cut your losses now. NIO is super cheap now and it will be TESLA 2.0.
"5 dollar stock at most, If it doesn’t get delisted that is. Remember Huawei? Lmao"
Let’s do a survey: Click “thumbs up” for NIO and click “thumbs down” for TESLA
NIO does not need sales abroad. They have the largest captive and supportive market in the world!
I am buying more at open.
Finally red pre market. Green EOD. 
"loads of EV car companies, non like $Nio. Anyone can sell an EV, that's not Nio's philosophy. Get will plan."
This is a Chinese EV winner! Hands down!
"I'm invested in both NIO and FSR for long term, I am not worried in the least."

"Nio in Europe is huge, because battery swap technology will change Europe car maker industry whole sector"
Buying and looking away pays off long term here...dont worry about what it closes at today or tomorrow invest what you can afford now and then thank me in a few years :)
"This is the worst day nio has had in my eyes , moving worse than any other stock i have in my watchlist, sad day for me cause its my biggest investment."
"YES, NIO IS GOING DOWN. WHY?? MY SUSPICION IS that the expansion into Norway and Europe is not going well for NIO. This has to be because the NIO car is really poor quality and cant stand up to harsh Norwegian standards and climate or that NIO cant really compete in the freeworld. That spells doom for NIO stock."
"If you were Apple’s CEO, and your looking to get into the EV market, wouldn’t YOU partner with Nio? Sure you would. In a New York second."
"I am pleased that I had diversified some long ago, as I see these EV and tech stocks fall out of favor. Although I am a believer that the tech sector, including EV, will have a rebound later this year which may even surpass their highs previously, I am nibbling again in the EV sector, as I feel it will have the most growth in the future. In the meantime and for some time now, I have invested in utilities both in funds as well as individual utility stocks, especially in states like TX as well as MO and others such as SO, Nextera, NRG, AES and a few others, as these will benefit in a large way with every new EV sold, as folks who buy the EV's will be paying higher utility bills to charge their vehicle (still at much lower cost than gasoline costs), and these utility companies have basically very long term companies and guaranteed profit. I personally feel any buy of NIO below $38 will be looked on as a genius buy within a year. What it does right now, is kind of meaningless, as it is being sold off due to the rampant gambling and margin calls both to individuals and to hedge funds. It has zero to do with the value of the company. This is a lesson in the market for many as they are learning that you should only invest in the market with monies you do NOT need in the near future, but the market is full of short termers who borrowed and are now in desperate straits selling everything to stay afloat. It seems like folks would learn, but those that bought higher, and they did so with long term horizon and no need for that money right now, IMO, you are just fine and will see blue skies again. I would be more worried about the 0 and 1 gamblers on crypto. If they feared fiat currency, regular folks should really fear money made with 0's and 1's on a computer using huge amounts of electricity for a totally non tangible asset. At least, gold and silver are tangible assets with history."
crypto is in a huge bubble and you could lose 90% you are either an investor or a gambler.Buy nio for safe 10x long term gains
"We all know that if NIO was an American company the price will be well above $200 and all analysts will support such a price. Another example is Alibaba shares that are trading at half of Amazon's valuation. Unfortunately xenophobia exists when it comes to Chinese companies. But mixing patriotism with investing is wrong, after all you invest to make money. NIO and its CEO are the poster child of the Chinese EV future and the government will never let them fail. The company have displayed a well organized and orchestrated plan to be a major player in the world market. In a personal note holding NIO shares is a winning Lottery ticket that some of us already presented for payment and will do that again soon. Patience is the key."
THIS MAJOR UPGRADE NEWS. Bloomberg Analysts State Fisker FSR could be a TEN X Tesla Type performer in the next 30 -90!days it will double from its $12 price currently$AAPL & $NIO are next to join Fisker. 
"When we hear smart money is moving funds into certain stocks, as the U.S. investment bank that has increased its holdings in NIO Inc. (NYSE: NIO) by 18.6%, according to a 13F filing by the bank.Bank of New York Mellon held 3.29 million shares of Nio at the end of the March quarter, up from the 2.782 million shares it held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, I believe in the profits and future earnings, and the trends / charts are good indicators, my dd has lead me to have a long term investment in this company."
NIO under promising and over delivering $60 summer $120 Dec 100 million new longs today
Tasha Keeny of Ark investment just said on BNN that Tesla could reach a 4000$/share by 2025!!!!!Wondering where ole little Nio will be by then?? still saying 171$ end of 2021.
"Wait, Nio is to be spared, don’t sell all.Sell all Tesla and other evs. Buy nio.Nio being in China & having the expansion, catalysts will have great news soon."

This is the earliest date thus far that NIO is announcing earnings. They wouldn't schedule this early if the report wasn't outstanding. Just my opinion.
"THE TRUTH UNVEILED ITSELF, ELON MUSK JUST BOUGHT $BTC TO SHOW ""PROFITABLITY"". Elon musk is trying to hide the heavily down sales in china and the fact, that $NIO is overtaking china – the biggest ev market in world for any reasonable multi billion/trillion dollar marketcap.Dump/short $Tsla Buy $NIO"
"Nio’s future depends more on the Chinese government than ever.The EV startup weathered the pandemic, but the cost of its bailout is becoming clear"
Ban shorting of stocks simple!!!
Anyone thinks we’re heading for the gap at $24?
"you guys need to realize the chip shortage is affecting EVERY oem, not specific to NIO. I don't get it why no analyst will ask about ET7 pre-order numbers?? they wasted like 4 questions asking the same thing about margin improvement....which was already explained very explicitly"
"I am looooong Nio since august and through next 5 years.....Anyway, in the near term, is here anybody to share names of chips producers worth to add to portfolio? I think its worth to speculate."
Today I ordered my ET7. So excited.
NIO has more cash than FSR and CCIV / Lucid have market cap COMBINED
"Could be worse , you could be holding bitcoin."
When is Hongkong listing gonna be up?
This is starting to look very good. If they keep on increasing production I can't see how this stock can not be a winner in the future. It's a growing EV maker in the biggest and most important EV market on the planet who is soon to expand into the european market. I'm holding this one.
"If you are scared. Sell. If you have doubts sell. All this is, is temporary. This is a gift to all long term investors. Leave now if you think it might not hit 100, 200, 300. Save the rest of us long term investors time. Soon as you leave your shares will be bought. Institutions know it. They write the media hit pieces that scare you. I like many long term investors will be smiling big in the coming months and years."
"Trading up in Frankfurt last check$42.06 usdEither way, the triple bounce off the 200dma seems to be intact.The intrinsic value of Nio should keep the price buoyant over time. Who knowsPerhaps we may revisit the highs before longCreate more Nio Millionaires BLUE SKIES COMETH "

more great news! stock tumbles..makes zero sense.
nio 2025. 300 dollar stock easy
"OMG! keeps going down, i thought NIO was a leader in EV's...will this go up again.?"
"TSLA has $483M net profit which $518M are from carbon credits and $101 profit from Bitcoin.without carbon credits and bitcoin, its a loss of $136M. I just call this ""creative account"".NIO let's customer get any profit from carbon credits!!!!!!"
"Crypto is an international thing. anybody in the world can trade in crypto even the little guys. this is the reason why you see billion dollar valuations. only 2Trillion of the global money is in crypto. the stockmarket has roughly 95T if 10% of the money in stocks go to crypto... it will be a huge spike for crypto. crypto is its infancy so early adopters will make a killing. you don't need huge money to invest in crypto and the potential is limitless. You can buy fractional coins so what are you waiting for, see you on the other side."
"All in all, NIO stock has long-term potential and outstanding fundamentals. The company will continue to impress investors in the coming years and the shares could easily cross $50 again."
"another free tip for knuckleheads that are clueless and going on and on about chips.... NIOs chip suppliers will be onsite at the new mega Neo Park under construction, as will battery production by CATL and of course drivetrain by XPT.... William Li our genuine leader and genius has it all figured out, I’m 100% sure of this! (for example, would they actually come out and announce expansion and delivery commitments to Norway by Sep if he is worried about chips...he has a master plan as always!"
"Despite continued supply chain challenges, chip and battery supply shortages don't appear to be affecting NIO as badly as expected, as the Chinese electric car company continues to give strong second-quarter delivery guidance"
"NIO BATTERY SWAP - Deals with major fueling stations and malls. $7.2 Billion Cash, 21% margins. NIO ET7 Most anticipated EV vehicle ever, is in productions trials. ONE MILLION UNIT FACTORY under construction. Low Debt ...LAST chance under $40 ... quote me on that"
"Inflation is good for NIO. Inflation means US printed more money. That means things will cost more, so your share of a foreign company should go up too, especially because non-stop printing devalues dollar."
Cathie Woodcock is a Tesla PimpTesla blew it on the BATTERY SWAP and the spoils go to NIONIO's partner in BATTERY SWAP is the largest battery make in the world CATL
"New York Mellon Corp. increased its holdings in NIO 508,000 shares. that should speak volumes compared to the noisy nattering nabobs of negativism."
Used to be a $60 stock Now its an $80 stock
"The ET7 is simply the most technologically advanced production car in the world. Simple!When it goes on sale in Q1 2022 the demand will be phenomenal.Watch the SP then !!It’s still early basement pricing to get into NIO. Hurry up.REVERSAL IS ONGOING, WE GO UP.MUTE THE MUTTS.All IMHO."
I'm not sure if you all did read the earnings report... in summary earnings before redemption of NCI which is an one-off.. when a company buy back its own shareholding it is a good sign as they have confidences that the rewards outweight the risks.. hence do focus on the EPS adjusted RMB -0.23 which is approx 80% positive variance as compared to QoQ and YoY.. and this beats the target by a huge margin.. sorry to type this late.. but I have to buy the dip first hahaha
maan there is only good news on top of good news and nio keep dipping.
Almost shopping time again
"If there is inflation, then economy is heating up. Which is good. If there is lack economic inflation, then people will say it's bearish for the stock market as well. You just can't win.It is manipulation before a very summer and fall.Not panicking, NIO is best EV play and best auto manufacturer the world has ever seen"
How many of you believe that NIO will be green today...  Needs thump up... On Monday we will have numbers of cars manufactured in April.. Green again...
Future is green
IDEA of the Day You can buy 17 shares of NIO for one share of TeslaWhat doubles first $621 or $32 ?
"if your uber driver or your beautiful bartender or a girl you met at the bar a week ago, are telling you about crypto, obviously it's time to sell. FUNNY"

"Stock Moe bought options for $50 by EOY and is expecting $100 next year.'""Now let's get out there and lose some money'"
Is NIO a good buy & hold stock?
Institutions are driving this down to take retail shares. Jumping in and waiting for increase. It is obvious.
it is my belief that NIO is up due to the news that Tesla is abandoning their project to add a new production plant in Shanghai. Tesla sales were down 27 in China in March and the Chinese people want to drive a car manufactured by a Chinese company. The government is 100% behind NIO and will guarantee their success
Bitcoin sinks after Elon Musk says Tesla will not accept the digital coin for transactions
I was more than a little encouraged with the earnings. The outlook remains promising but more importantly in spite of chip issues the unit and revenues were excellent for the quarter with margins that are indeed impressive. I am a long term investor and a short term trader as well. I have made a strong return as I put sophisticated hedge positions on over the last two years. I believe your Euro expansion and battery exchange rollout will pay off in a large payoff of profits and revenues. I covered my short positions as the forward growth looks excellent. Hopefully chip shortages will be abated. I look forward to the June Conference. I have covered shorts and I am buying more long positions. Good job.
"guys,is this company bankrupting or what is going on"
China’s EV startup NIO said a fire incident occurring to an ES8 SUV on April 22 that resulted from a short circuit after its battery pack was struck in chassis impacts.
"Tesla reportedly suspends expansion of Shanghai plant The second phase of the Tesla Shanghai plant expansion project is currently on hold, Tencent News said Wednesday, citing people close to the plant.The project covers an area of 461,100 square meters and is owned by the Shanghai Lingang District Management Committee. The site's auction failed several months ago when there was only one bidder, the report said.Tesla signed a memorandum of cooperation with Lingang in July 2018, announcing the construction of its largest overseas factory outside the United States, the Shanghai Gigafactory, with a planned capacity of 500,000 units. On Jan. 7, 2019, Tesla officially opened the Shanghai Gigafactory with a first phase capacity of 250,000 units. The plant is mainly used for the production of Model 3 and Model Y.On January 7, 2020, Tesla delivered the Model 3 produced at the Shanghai plant to 10 Chinese consumers for the first time and launched the production of Model Y.According to Tencent News, Tesla was previously required to invest RMB 14.08 billion over five years and achieve an output of more than RMB 75 billion by the end of 2023 and generate RMB 2.23 billion in annual tax revenue.Otherwise, Tesla would have to hand over the land but would receive corresponding financial compensation regarding land rental, buildings, and equipment.On April 28, Tesla made an announcement that it had repaid the $614 million loan related to the Shanghai factory expenses early and the related contract was terminated. After this, the unused $758 million under the fixed asset credit line in Tesla's debt and finance lease schedule will no longer be available.A Reuters report on Tuesday mentioned that people familiar with the matter said Tesla has stopped buying land to expand its Shanghai plant due to uncertainty over tensions between the US and China."

NIO is my biggest position after NIU. Both EV companies and both have a bright future. Keep holding!
NIO was just mentioned on The Five on Fox News by Jessie that NIO officially sold more EVs than Tesla 
"Partnership between Chinese firms, European partners gets closer during COVID-19: NIOBERLIN - The partnership between Chinese companies and European partners has become even closer against the backdrop of COVID-19, said Zhang Hui, vice-president of NIO Europe.The domestic production and sales of the Chinese electric carmaker have been on the rise for months, which also means that there are more orders for German suppliers even during the epidemic, Zhang said in a recent interview with Xinhua.In order to keep the supply chain stable, NIO and its partners are deepening cooperation and communicating in advance, so that the effect of the epidemic would be reduced to the lowest level.""A friend in need is a friend indeed. Mutual understanding, mutual support and precise previews are contributing to NIO's smooth operation and its local partners' fight against the epidemic,"" Zhang continued.NIO announced last year that it would enter the European market in the second half of this year. At the moment, the Chinese carmaker, with its office in the German city of Munich, provides only design and R&D services.According to Zhang, once NIO begins its car sales in Europe, it will expand its investment in Europe and need more partners to form after-sales service.""Therefore, it is foreseeable that there is big room for more cooperation with local partners, as NIO starts its sales business,"" he said.NIO also hopes to establish its footing in Europe and build up its brand to better serve the European customers ""by making use of our Chinese digital experience, connectivity experience and service experience."""

Great opportunity to buy at $36 price range for long term. $50 within a year. $80 within 2 years.
Futures down big. NIO will drop again tomorrow.
"Realistically, do you believe with time NIO will become as big a stock as Tesla?"
"I have 24 shares in NIO with an average of 52$ purchases, what do you recommend me to buy another 20-30 now or to wait?"

"Tesla is most overvalued and due to correction in Tesla , it's taking down all other EV shares along with it .."
who is stronger now NIO or tesla .... I like how NIO recovered
Most Day Traders will Lose every last nickel they started with ..and thats a fact
"Back in the 50s whenever we got a toy the first thing we did was to turn it over to see if it was made in Japan in which case it was deemed junk. The good stuff was made in the USA. Then in the 70s and 80s Japan proved itself to be a country that manufactures high quality goods while the junk was made in America as any car owner from that time will attest to.A short while ago the stuff made in China was considered junk and America made the good stuff, or so it seemed. smart people came to realize that the Chinese built stuff for Americans based on the specs provided and so if it was junk it was because American companies wanted to sell the cheaply made junk for the most amount of money.Now we find out that the teslas made in China are of "" a much higher quality than those made in Freemont Ca."" according to Cathey Woods. So we have come full circle yet again. The Chinese make high quality goods , with NIO being a prime example, and Americans make junk because elon wants to squeeze every last penny from his victims, er I mean customers. This can not continue into perpetuity for obvious reasons as the free market will prevail.Interestingly, our Ms. Woods attributes the #$%$ quality of American teslas to the plant being old. I guess the worlds second richest person cannot afford to upgrade that plant as his customers are not worth it."
ALERT Noticing two articles on Ameritrade today that strongly state Wall Street is finally agreeing NIO shares are trading well below the companies true value. JPMorgan and Mellon Bank both added big-time @$33
The whole world revolves around tech.Tech sell off is a joke
After today's news about the NEO park and its production capacity - it has become official - NIO is way undervalued.
"Do those a couple hundred dollars in stimulus checks really benefit people, when the rich big boys pull off massive shorts over inflation fears, and benefit from rising real estate, etc? Retail investors got played like a fiddle...$NIO $TSLA $CCIV"
"my good friend from China, gave me following:1. As Tesla recently have been involved into lots of car accidents in some provinces in China. The reasons seemly are still under investigation, but looks like that it will be in relation to brake lost control. More importantly, seemly Chinese government by this chance is taking more and more strict monitoring upon Tesla cars as the cars like mobile scanner which can take lots of road/building information within China. Some rumors even indicates that special military building/ high level government area are not allowed for the entry of Tesla cars from this year. 2. To further improve the local NV industry to compete Tesla(and other similar companies around the world), Chinese government on 20 May 2021 released a draft order for the improvement of the power charging and exchange station structure, which seemly is a big advantage technology of NIO. NIO is on the wind in China in my view. 3. In addition, lots of technology companies are rushing into EV industry (like Huawei/Baidu/Alibaba) to battle in EV industry. 4. NIO on 6 May 2021 announced its Norwegian strategy to entry Norway NV market. the rest is up to you GL"
#NIO will be $78 to $100 by end of this year.

"NIO Battery Swap is worth more than CCIV, FSR and WKHS market caps COMBINED"

"That's potentially a serious problem for Tesla, which opened its second auto assembly plant in Shanghai in late 2019 specifically to serve the crucial Chinese market. China is the world's largest market for overall car sales, and electric vehicles make up a much bigger share of auto sales than in any other major market — about 4.5% in 2020, more than twice the EV share of the US car market last year.Tesla's sales to Chinese buyers plunged by more than 60% between March and April, according to independent Chinese EV analyst Zhu Yulong. Newly insured Tesla vehicles fell to just under 12,000 vehicles in April from about 34,500 in March, Yulong reported. Those numbers correspond closely to the CPCA's non-export number in April, and total number in March. Source:CNN"

"Stock Moe bought a load more $NIO for over $60 after Nio Day and a load more Ethereum at over $4000 last week. ""Now let's get out there and lose some money"""
"This market is one step forward, 10 steps back. This is hype and manipulation by who knows who. But it’s BIG money and the fear drives price down and big money comes for shopping spree. Wake up weak hands and stop selling your shares! First it was bond yields and market crashed, bond yields, then its inflation, then its covid. It’s all media creating fear and panic. Big boys use that and make one or two big sells triggering a decline in price scaring weak hands to sell triggering stop losses and that’s it. Then same big boys come and buy buy buy. Wake up already! If you don’t believe me just look at the charts and each time there’s been panic about bond yields, inflation and the list goes on and on and on...."
"I'm constantly seeing people talk about assistance that the Chinese government is giving NIO, and other Chinese EV companies. The context being that it is a negative. People that are researching Chinese stocks consider that as a great benefit any time they are considering investing in China. There are other political considerations as well, and some of them are negative. Do your DD in this regard, but NIO is registered in the Cayman Islands, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and has a Chinese subsidiary of the American accountant firm Pricewaterhouse, Coopers to do their accounting! Still, sh-tuff can happen, so that is a consideration (Taiwan?).I'm looking out 5 years, and these things I know:The Chinese government LOVES NIO! The Golden Goose of the future! The iconic car company that they have never had!! They have made many accommodations that appear to assist NIO, and other Chinese EV companies, as well as all EV companies.. Many of these policies are in an effort to transition from ICE (internal combustion engines) vehicles to zero emission vehicles because they have the worst air on the planet (Beijing). As a result, they have been paying government subsidies for EV's. -Then, the government decided to give subsidies for vehicles costing over $42 thousand dollars-ish only if you had battery swapping, which felt like they were targeting NIO specifically as they were the only one selling an EV over that price point with battery swapping!! As a result, Tesla had to cut their prices under that price point to ensure they could still get the subsidy for their lower level Model 3. Tough on their margins to cut 3-4 thousand off of their prices! NIO has never cut their prices!-In order to buy an ICE vehicle in China, you have to win a lottery, which is about a 1 in 100 chance. -If you win the lottery to buy an ICE vehicle in China, you then have to purchase a license that costs $13-14 thousand dollars JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO BUY AN ICE vehicle! Licenses for EV's are FREE, and given out to everyone who wants to buy an EV!-Once you buy an ICE vehicle, then many of the major highways have limitations to drive your new ICE car. Major highways only allow you to drive ICE cars on odd/even days, depending upon the last number on your license plate. May 1st, 3rd, and 5th, etc... you can drive only if you have an odd number as your last number on your plate. The same for even numbered days, which makes me think, ""Why would anyone in China buy an ICE vehicle??"" They say China will sell over 5 million EV's/year by 2025, but my brain asks ""Why would anyone buy an ICE vehicle with all of these hurdles to cross??"" 25 million cars bought/year, and I bet they will buy more than that at a faster rate than projected!I am a pumper (NIO is my biggest holding), but only telling the truth! Vedad, don't copy my post this time!"
"Earlier today Li said at the auto show launch that the manufacturing and testing of ET7 are in full swing.To date, NIO has 203 battery swap stations, 144 supercharging stations, and nearly 1,100 supercharging piles in China. In addition, NIO has more than 1,800 destination charging piles and access to more than 380,000 third-party fast charging piles."
"NIO is likely to outsell all other luxurious SUV brands in China soon. During the first quarter of 2021, NIO sold 5419 units in Shanghai, ranking second behind Benz, which sold 5749 SUVs, but ahead of BMW (5165), TSLA (3372) and AUDI (3249)."
NIO will be trading at $50 within a week of the Crypto Crash
Red is the favorite color of nio.
"Sometimes what you see and hear isn't true, stay the course. It's important to choose to believe in yourself after so much researching. Mute the noise!"
"what reaction do you guys expect after earnings are out? usually we go into the red, but i want to add more soon anyway."
I just got off the phone with LI. He told me not to worry they beat on earning though forward guidance is not great due to the chip shortage. That is good new for you longs.
"this whole stock needs a battery swap itself, what's happening NIO, all this good news everyday and never moving up, flat battery?"
So there was a gasline attacked this should shoot higher in logical terms.
Add 200 more shares at 36.10
"Stock Moe after Nio Day in January - ""We will never see this below $40 ever again, I expect $100 by end of the year"". "
"OMG, awesome numbers. With this rate, we will surpass Tesla in 2-3 years, much earlier than people thought."
Why does the day chart look exactly like the Tesla day chart?
"It’s wonderful to see so many investors in NIO at this level. Hard to imagine but many of us bought under $4 a share when it was a “lost cause” and the owner Li Bin invested $100 million of his own. Life is good, good luck to everyone!"
"I am very bullish. NIO is the future for China EV, Believe me - we will be doubling from this point in 6 month."
Just what is battery swap?When you are on empty do you pull in and get a fully charged battery and drive off ?
"NIO is Beyond Oversold on every Metric, so is LI & XPEV & TSLA."

With all the good news around this company it simply doesn’t make sense for this stock to lose 35$ support and go back to the 20s
Deathcross on Monday. This is when 50 SMA crosses 200 on daily chart.
JPMorgan and Mellon NY have set a new bottom. NIO is moving back towards $50+ levels for good.
"If NIO CEO Li Bin announces any number of ET7 pre orders over 15,000 units, this stock will go over $55 in one sessions ,, watch and see"
There must be at least 5 new YouTube’s daily about how wonderful NIO is yet the pps goes down. Even in after market it goes down. I’m bullish on NIO but I’d really hate to see what would happen to the pps if bad news came out.
GET READY: Get ready for the afternoon end of week NIO stock price crash. Are you ready?? Just watch. LOL
"NIO BATTERY SWAP time is shorter than the time to fill a tank of gas, which can make consumers travel more conveniently. Tesla owners will age waiting for a open charger or buy a horse"

All EV STOCKS are getting a beating because Tesla is way overpriced and Tesla correction is bringing EV sector towards a downtrend..Long term investors do not panic...just hold on...or if you can buy more a good opportunity..at every low levels....Good luck..
"$72 soon...The chip shortage doesn’t mean “game over” for Nio. Growth may return once it’s resolved. Also, if its upcoming move into Norway shows signs of success, there’s more reason to believe this early stage company, still valued as if it’s an established player, will live up to sky-high expectations."
TSMC expects to be able to fully supply chips to EV market by mid-October. NIO SP should then move forward close to $50 range by EOY.
I hope you guys been stocking up on buying shares of Nio because alot of institutions have been swooping in buying up alot of the shares people panic sold.

"Very Very Bad news for all others, Even German Media is saying : ""The Shanghai Auto Show turned out to be a $NIO-Show""Congratulation, we are holding a future multi trillion dollar company. Maybe the only in the only in the world and the chances and indices are big, that $NIO has the potential to become the greatest Car company on earth since NIO even stole the greatest deal in EV history from Tsla, the deal with the gas station Giant Sinopec – Google Sinopec tsla and then Sinopec NIO, very very bad news for all others, even german car brands....$NIO to andromeda"
history tell! no stocks ever climbed higher continuously for a hype or stayed down with solid growth!
Only reason anyone will put NIO down is to glom your $65 shares for $38
"NIO says NIO Pilot range up 278% during May Day holiday over same period last yearMay 7, 2021NIO users drove more than 4.7 million kilometers with the NIO Pilot during the May Day holiday, May 1-5, a 278% increase over the same period last year, the electric car company said in a report Friday.During this period, users used NIO Pilot for a total of 62,417 hours, up 269 percent from the same period last year."

NIO will have the largest EV manufacturing plant on planet earth in six months.
I have avg down to 36$ with around 140 shares. Do you guys think it is going to rebound soon? Hmm its following the tesla’s trend.
"There is a high probability that NIO took over 15,000 pre orders for the ET7"
Who knows if the shares sold today were even real shares or naked shorts borrowed and never delivered?
It's amazing how quickly the sentiment can change. NIO is a great company with great products. Glad to have been buying the dip!
Ford with the announcement of their EV truck up over 6%NIO announced a new sedan and it dropped like a rock. Now it islike on the bottom of the lake with the rock around their necks.F or GM much better buys!
"Welcome back EV buyers! It's about time the entire sector recovers a little bit. The best we can all do now is continue to add at these bottom prices. This really helps a lot having a few green days again. I'm going to need to pay off some bills I've been holding off on, and it's not easy the last 4 months being on a down trend almost daily. I will try to add some more next week after I take of my bills first. Hopefully the reversal is beginning right now. In a few months from now. We will all look back and see what an amazing opportunity we had the last few months to buy these EV stocks at these low prices. Long and strong!"
Happy today looking like we can move forward towards 40 now again

"Stock market margin debt jumped by another $25 billion in April, to a historic high of $847 billion, according to FINRA data. It has exploded by $188 billion in six months, and by 61% year-over-year, and by 55% from February 2020:What does that tell ? From wolfstreet analysis Yes, margin debt drives up stock prices, so spiking margin debt CAUSES stock prices to surge. This happens every time before a sell-off. This is exactly what then drives the selloff and causes so much damage when margin debt unwinds.The VIX is telling big corrections are coming to the market. and NIO is no isolated simply because its in china. brace yourself since we will hit 25 in few months."

50% off highs. and moving very slow to the downside. $28? this reminds me of CGC after cannabis boom. took a year to recover
Doesn't matter folks... New NEO facility...better battery...higher sales.... Yet... Stock is down? lol... This is Wallstreet manipulation at its finest.... Shorties.. Hedgies...Cramer.... they want to drive this down... And they're winning! It's a great company. But right now it's being manipulated. Until it's profitable.... it's will hang around 35-42 range....

"ET7 REVIEWS says BE A BUYER NOW May 20 2021 ,, Could the new ET7 be NIO's most significant car? We sent Elliot along to an exclusive preview to see if their first super luxury electric saloon car lives up to the hype. Yes it's another big car from NIO, but it looks the business with a smooth, sleek and simple design. With an option for a whopping 150kWh battery that gives a range of over 600 miles, this Chinese sedan is poised to take on rivals including the Tesla Model S. Like the ES 8, the ET7 can use NIO's innovative battery swap system enabling a 0-100% charge in 3 minutes. It might not be coming until early 2022, but legacy automakers should start worrying now as this elegant and powerful car could prove incredibly popular."

This will be a great month for NIO.
"After detailed analysis and repeated testing, the investigation has concluded that the battery packs in the vehicles involved were equipped with a module specification NEV-P50, and the voltage sampling cable harness in the module may be pressed by the upper cover of the module due to improper positioning. In extreme cases, the insulation on the pressed voltage sampling cable harness may wear out and cause a short circuit, creating a safety issue. Other ES8 vehicles that have encountered safety issues are equipped with the same battery pack. -Inside EV"
We are actually holding up quite well in comparison to li auto and xpeng. I have allot of confidence in Nio and believe it will be a long term winner
"NIO 7,000shrs @15.78 last summer....LONGSTRONG...."
NIO IS A GREAT CAR BUT: NO NIO CAR ON USA SOIL = LIMITED INVESTOR INTEREST = STOCK PRICE REMAINS STAGNANT.
Hedge funds are so beneficial for the market they push stock prices down and prevent bubbles. Thanks to them we can buy NIO shares at this level. Once the industry and market risk disappear NIO will break new highs.
"writing was on the wall early this morning, this needs to stay under 40.00 because of the 1,700,000 shares that have options on them. This may be one of the most manipulated stocks out there. JMHO"

"Nio’s Upcoming Earnings Report May Lead to a Much Higher Price 4/26/2021 4:10pm EDT By Mark R. Hake, CFANio (NYSE:NIO) will release its first quarter sales and earnings on Thursday, April 29, after having pre-released on April 1 the delivery numbers for the quarter. As a result, Nio stock could move higher, especially if the company updates its outlook for the rest of the year. My assessment is that Nio is worth $73.34, or 72% higher than this morning’s price of $42.58."
All you sellers must enjoy losing money because when NIO's stock price is much higher you will be complaining that you didn't buy when it was low.
Battery Swapping Technology is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Nio. One thermal runaway event and this stock is going bankrupt. They will have to recall all the cars and or fix Battery swap which will never work or get approval from any place other than china (which bypass all regulations for profits) ITS JUST TOO DANGEROUS.
"The market is long due a correction. We're already seeing the beginning of it, which will only bring NIO further down as well. Forget going up anytime soon."

let's close at $35 or higher..
Chip shortage is over ? NIO 55 NOW !!!!!!!
Seems to be so sensitive to the downwards moves of Tesla & Nasdaq but not as positive on the upwards moves of them
"Cathie Wood's latest comments on NIO are interesting regarding battery tech. She has exhibited this sentiment previously, but the fact that she is elaborating on her prior commentary, to me, means that ARK ""may"" be moving closer to taking a position in NIO. If this happens, this will definitely be a positive catalyst for the stock. Personally i think she's ""hedging"" her commentary when she includes Xpeng, because there is no evidence that Xpeng is directly participating in the Swapping station build out. Battery Swapping - BaaS - is now a central part - some would say THE central part - in NIO's business model. It is clearly a superior technology, and is the driver for the subscription service, which Li is BIG on. NIO is establishing THE model for the future of EV adoption across the spectrum."
Someone explain the logistics of battery swap to me. The battery must get very carefully swapped but what happens to the one without energy? it has to charge right? for every EV made a spare battery has to be produced so that it has a mate to exchange when low. Completely backwards engineering
"I've been here since $27 and watched it go to $65... Now it is at $34 and my shares are just increasing because I keep adding. I do not have intentions of selling, and trust me I will still be here when it hits $100 and even $200"
Deutsche Bank lowered the EOY price from $70.00-$60.00/share.Anyone have any idea why?
"+2% pre market, market open -10%, + 2% after market"

NIO buzz has never been louder. I been in the stock since the beginning. LI Bin is becoming legend in China along the lines of Steve Jobs. The ET7 is his proof of authenticity and the Shanghai Show has put NIO in the spotlight all over the world.

Nio needs to implement fuel cell technology. It would be easy for them to do and make them competitive in broader New Energy Vehicle Markets and sectors.https://www.carwale.com/news/hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered-bmw-x5-coming-next-year/
"NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnershipEqualOceanMay 13, 2021The company saw several competitive products of premium EV sedans at the Shanghai Auto Show.NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnership-CnEVPostChina's NEV sales penetration rate rose to 11.4% in March.NIO's share in China's NEV market reached 3.4%.Notwithstanding, the Chinese premium EV market is entering a 'no apple to fall' situation.NIO is now building EV infrastructure with Sinopec.This collaboration could strengthen the company's advantages on infrastructure, costs and services, attracting more customers.Amidst the coronavirus pandemic last year, the global economy was severely compromised. However, China's economic recovery is moving now at a lightning speed that overshadows other nations.Passenger vehicle and EV sales locally carried the leading positions in March 2021, presenting surges of 80% and 352%, respectively.In the same month, monthly EV sales first reached 11.3% of total car deliveries in the country. The rocketing EV sales mirror the overall strong consumption recovery. NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnership-CnEVPostNIO broke its monthly record, delivering 7,257 vehicles in March. Meanwhile, NIO's EV market share was down to 3.4% mainly due to the booming sales of Wuling Mini, a product of SAIC Motor, Liuzhou Wuling Motors and General Motors' joint venture.In 1Q, NIO delivered 20,060 units, meeting the sales expectation of between 20,000 and 20,500 vehicles.On the other hand, the company's founder and CEO William Li claimed that due to the chip and battery shortage, the monthly production will remain at less than 7,500 units in the following months. He nevertheless believes that the supply chain issue will be eased in 3Q 2021.Chinese EV market: no apple to fallNotwithstanding NIO's strong delivery results, as mentioned in our last report, the EV market is expected to see more intense competition as different manufacturers are going to release new models in 2021.In April, a few brands launched similar products to NIO – and demonstrated them at the Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition. It is not hard to tell that these brands are entering the premium EV market and eager to occupy a share. Below is a crop of the new vehicle models with competitive functions. NIO in April 2021: Fresh sales record, new major partnership-CnEVPostOther than the brands portrayed above, Baidu said that for every month in the rest of 2021, it is expected to have a new EV model equipped with self-driving solutions based on the Apollo platform.Luckily for NIO, some of these models won't be sold within a year due to the production timeline and will not impact its sales too much in 2021.Collaboration with SinopecLeaving aside market dynamics and competition, NIO's new form of cooperation with Sinopec is also worth mentioning. Even though some of the EV maker's previous strategic collaborations are not important, this new project definitely stands out.On April 15, the founder William Li and other major management figures at NIO and Sinopec announced that they have released the second generation swap station in a Sinopec gas station in Beijing.Based on their agreement, NIO will deploy many of its planned swap stations at Sinopec's sites. We think this initiative will create synergy effects for NIO in two ways.Siting: Most of NIO's current swap stations are geographically located in non-core urban areas, due to the difficulty in site selection (probably it's hard for NIO to find open-air places to build stations in the city center). By using Sinopec's sites, the construction of swap stations can solve the problem.Brand marketing: another significant benefit of building a swap station in Sinopec's gas station is to achieve accurate marketing. Hypothetically, every driver will be exposed to NIO's swap station when they are filling up their cars at some Sinopec's gas stations.This is highly harmonic with NIO's broad strategy, whereby promotion is one of the important purposes of developing a swap station network. ConclusionWith the economy bouncing back, China's automotive industry is recovering first, along with increased demand for both combustion engines and EV motors. The competitive landscape is becoming more intensified.NIO, in turn, is actively reinforcing its business through infrastructure-related collaborations.This article was first published by Niko Yang on EqualOcean, an investment research firm focusing on China."

The forecasted NIO price at the end of 2021 is $50.78 - and the year to year change +4%. The rise from today to year-end: +48%. In the middle of 2021, we expect to see $38.94 per 1 NIO.

"NIO recalled nearly 5,000 electric ES8 SUVs at the end of June, following reports of spontaneous fires coming from the battery packs. The company found out that, in packs made between April 2nd, 2018, and October 19th, 2018, there was a module that occasionally pressed up against a voltage sampling cable in the car’s wiring harness. This contact could wear down those cables over time, and, in a few cases, it resulted in short-circuits that started the fires."

NIO is here to stay either you like it or not. What makes someone successful is the ability to see something few years down the line when everyone else is only seeing today. This is what separates successful people (and not just in the stock market) from the one's that look back wondering why I didn't see that coming.

"Can you imagine when someday NIO manages to enter the North American market, millions of Chinese here being so patriotic would definitely rush to buy NIO. making NIO possibly number one EV car in the world.

I guess Chinese people would start asking questions."

"NIO is 75% of my portfolio. If it hits $800 and surpass Tesla, I will be millionaire."
Tesla is also literally stamping entire cars like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron’s Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand abandoned plans to make their own factory due to cash shortage and partnered with JAC. A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.

All you need to know is that Nio is building a 50 Billion Dollar Plant and R&D Center called NeoPark that can produce 1 million cars and 100 GWH per year.

"NIO expects to enter 5 European countries next yearPhate ZhangMay 6, 2021NIO expects to enter 5 European countries next year-CnEVPost(William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO ( left), and Qin Lihong, NIO president (right), talks to media in Shanghai. Source: CnEVPost)Chinese electric vehicle company NIO officially announced Thursday that it will enter Norway, its first stop to test the overseas market. Before the launch, William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, said in an exchange with media that the company expects to enter five European countries next year.Li did not disclose which five countries. When asked if NIO will enter France, he said that NIO will eventually go to France, but the countries where NIO's products will enter in the future will be announced in new launch events.NIO will enter more markets, but will advance step by step and do long-term planning, Li said. At the end of last year, NIO started to build a Norwegian team and formally formed NIO Norway in March, Li said, adding that NIO's entry into the global market was planned, but last year's Covid-19 and some of NIO's own events caused the progress to be a bit later than expected.NIO's entry into Norway was more than a year later than originally planned, and now it's time, so NIO has been speeding up the matter since the second half of last year, Li said.According to Li, it is more difficult for NIO to develop the European market than the Chinese market, and Chinese brands generally face more difficulties in their internationalization efforts compared to previous years.Although globalization is currently facing challenges, NIO has a simple idea that good products and services will be recognized globally, Li said.NIO's overall globalization strategy is well-prepared, and the company has planned for the long term while remaining patient and not holding out for a one-hit wonder, according to Li.Overall, NIO's entry into overseas markets will certainly be challenging, but not as much as one might expect, Li believes. NIO's vehicles have been designed with overseas markets in mind, and some details and software will be adjusted to suit local conditions, according to Li.NIO is already thinking five years down the road, and entering the global market requires even more of a long-term perspective, he said.As for why Europe was chosen as NIO's first stop in overseas markets, Li said he had learned that many fans in Japan and South Korea wanted NIO to enter the regions, but the company had no team there before, and the team previously established in Europe and the United States made it easier to enter those markets.NIO will not build smaller cars specifically for Europe, and in the future NIO may build smaller models in China and will consider entering local markets at that time, he mentioned."

"The 14-day RSI, a key momentum indicator, suggests the stock is in oversold territory. If buying sets in to take advantage of the oversold stock, it is likely that the stock will push past the near-term resistance around $35.50. Other key resistance areas are around $39.50 and $44."
"I'd rather have the odd red day with a slight pullback than it shoot up and drop like last time. It's currently consolidating a new support level (around the $41.40 mark before the next push up. No one is going to want to miss out on this earning call. Nio is too unpredictable, everyone might be expecting a sell the news sell off on Friday but can you afford to give up your shares when it takes off? Just hold through regardless."

"NIO COMPETITOR EVERGRANDE BITING THE DUST - The $87 Billion Chinese Car Maker That Hasn’t Sold A Single CarBy Irina Slav - May 20, 2021Since first announcing its plans to take on Tesla, Evergrande Auto has pushed back production deadlines several times, and it reported a 67-percent increase in its annual loss for 2020, Bloomberg reported in April. Taking on Tesla, it appears, is not as easy as it seems. Neither is manufacturing electric cars.Yet despite the absence of any working EV models, and despite the loss, Evergrande Auto’s market cap gained about a thousand percent in 2020 to hit $87 billion in April. Now, the company is saying it will begin trial production of EVs at the end of this year and start deliveries in 2022. However, initial plans to have a production capacity of half a million cars next year were delayed to 2025."

"Nio’s Upcoming Earnings Report May Lead to a Much Higher Price4/26/21 By Mark R. Hake, CFAhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/04/nio-stock-is-worth-73-34-or-72-more-based-on-estimated-sales-through-2022/amp/“Do you NOMI?”"
Et7 just rolled off assembly line
Nio to Hero!
"NIO is a great company with a great future, but the share price falls on every bit of good news. In the long run it will become one of the top companies in the world. Now however, but I have sold out and am waiting on the sidelines as it continues to fall. I am not normally a trader. I have always stayed long, but NIO stock price movements are too weird for me. It looks as though we will see .£30 or below."
That was a sudden drop  NIO will be the leader in the EV market buy now that is cheap
"NIO's William Li sees good start as EV sales exceed 10% of new car sales in China for first timePhate ZhangApril 19, 2021March marked a milestone for China's smart electric vehicle market, with EVs accounting for more than 10 percent of new vehicle sales for the first time, according to William Li, founder, chairman, and CEO of NIO, adding that the growing number of individual customers buying EVs is a good start.Li made an optimistic statement in an interview with Bloomberg during the Shanghai auto show on Monday, saying he was very optimistic about the market this year.Some older car brands will also launch competitive products in the second half of the year, but overall, they are latecomers to the smart electric vehicle space and have a lot of work to do, he said.Technology companies such as Xiaomi, Huawei, and Baidu are also entering the electric vehicle market. li welcomed the competition to them, saying it could foster innovation.He mentioned, however, that many new companies are entering the market, but it's a very long-term market. Li believes this is not a sprint race, but a long run, and NIO is confident of long-term competition.Earlier today Li said at the auto show launch that the manufacturing and testing of ET7 are in full swing.To date, NIO has 203 battery swap stations, 144 supercharging stations, and nearly 1,100 supercharging piles in China.In addition, NIO has more than 1,800 destination charging piles and access to more than 380,000 third-party fast charging piles."

There are many in Chinese but the US media doesn't cover them. The institutional investors are adding at these levels. Great product. Great management. Largest market in the world. Do your own due diligence. I also believe analysts are way underestimating future revenues, particularly 3-4 years out. Best buy and hold stock there is right now."
NIO getting hit hard in early at early trading for no reason. Lost most value of all my other stocks. Does anyone know why?
"Just hold, paper loss won’t mean anything.You wouldn’t have sold if this was at $75 at the moment. Then why would you sell this now it won’t make a difference. Just let it ride.This company is here to stay and grow to huge numbers in the future. Hold and buy more if you have the capacity."

Also, next millionaire maker is:ACRX - May 21, 2021:- It appears the COVID backlog of elective surgeries is starting to move and the company reported that April was the “best commercial month since the launch of DSUVIA.” What is more, is seeing movement on the delayed formulary reviews and now has 432 approvals for DSUVIA.- First and foremost, the company has made significant progress on the payer front and expects to hit their year-end target of 615 formulary approvals.- Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) has committed roughly 70 commercial team members to push DSUVIA in the oral and dental surgery space. Recently, AcelRx was informed by the American Dental Association about a billing code that can be used for DSUVIA, which should help with implementation.- The company reported the fastest-growing users of DSUVIA in the plastic surgery specialty, followed by orthopedics. This is most likely due to the massive backlog of elective surgeries from COVID-19 that are starting to be addressed.- In addition, the company is seeing strong interest from the oral and dental surgery arena, as well as eye surgeries, ENT, and palliative care, who could benefit from DSUVIA’s ease of use.- Perhaps the biggest opportunity for DSUVIA is penetrating the hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. DSUVIA has some clinical data published recently that validated its potential in these arenas and should help sway some P&T committees to consider employing DSUVIA into some treatment paradigms. The data showed that DSUVIA expressively reduced the total volume of opioids administered that led to faster discharge times.- In fact, when comparing DSUVIA to patients receiving standard IV opioids, patients dosed with DSUVIA prior to extubation required 50% fewer opioids in the PACU with 36% of them being opioid-free versus 8% in IV opioids. It is this level of data that could help AcelRx and DSUVIA disrupt the well-entrenched IV opioids in the hospital and ambulatory surgery center setting.- Another update to note is that the company’s contract manufacturer has taken control of the automated packaging line, which is being installed in their U.S. facilities. AcelRx expects to have the initial commercial batches being produced in the third quarter of 2022. AcelRx believes this move will considerably decrease the company’s cost of DSUVIA sales.- The company also reiterated their commitment to expanding DSUVIA’s footprint and expects to have an out-licensing transaction completed for DSUVIA in the near term. A commercial partnership should come with a substantial upfront payment, commercial milestones, and royalties.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4430374-acelrx-pharmaceuticals-moving-closer-to-an-attractive-risk-reward"

"NIO Chooses an EV-Obsessed Country for Its Landmark Push Outside of China -- Barrons 5/6/2021 Chinese electric-vehicle company NIO will make a landmark move later this year by pushing into its first market outside of China, the company said on Wednesday.NIO will expand into Norway, one of the most electric-vehicle-obsessed countries in the world, with the group's first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September. Four more spaces will come in 2022 in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, and Kristiansand, as the after-sales service network goes nationwide, the group said.""From its founding, NIO's vision is to be a global brand with high-quality products and services to the users worldwide,"" said William Li, NIO's founder, chair, and chief executive. ""Norway is a sustainable and innovative country and resonates with our vision.""Also: Tesla Has Been Losing Market Share in Europe. That May Change Dramatically.The company said that it will establish a ""full-fledged ecosystem"" in Norway, going beyond vehicles and servicing to include a lifestyle brand and community app. The group will also invest in charging infrastructure, with plans for four battery-swap stations in Norway connecting five major cities by the end of 2022.The first model to be available in Norway will be the ES8, NIO's electric sport-utility vehicle, with the ET7, a premium electric sedan, to come in 2022. NIO will compete for the attention of Norwegian drivers with its Chinese rival XPeng, which delivered more than 100 vehicles to the Scandinavian country in December 2020, with more coming in 2021.Norway is an EV-obsessed country in an EV-obsessed region.There were more electric vehicles sold in Europe than in any other part of the world in 2020, with 1.33 million electric-vehicle registrations in 18 key European markets last year, according to automotive analyst Matthias Schmidt. Those 18 markets include 14 major European Union states plus the U.K., Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland.Plus: Forget NIO and XPeng. This company and Tesla will be the top two electric-vehicle plays by 2025, says UBS.The EV explosion in Europe came amid a pedal-to-the-metal push to increase the adoption of cleaner transport from European governments, including offering generous incentives to consumers, which supercharged demand. However, China, which is home to a strong domestic electric-vehicle sector, reclaimed its crown as the world's largest EV market in the early months of 2021.But EV adoption has penetrated far deeper in Norway than in any other part of Europe. Battery-electric vehicles were nearly 53% of the mix of Norway's national auto market by the end of the first quarter of 2021, with plug-in, hybrid-electric vehicles at more than 29%, according to Schmidt, who publishes the European Electric Car Report.NIO will face tough competition in a red-hot European market. Volkswagen Group leads the way among battery-electric vehicle brands in the region, with Stellantis -- the group formed out of the merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group earlier this year -- not far behind, along with Tesla.Plus: This New Mercedes 'Tesla Fighter' Could Be Game Changing, Says Deutsche Bank"
