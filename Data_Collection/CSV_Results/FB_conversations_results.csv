Recent headlines and conversations for FB
Did Zucker pay the Australian government to bend over? The politicians are always looking for a good job after and would no a first for Canberra.
They launch a stablecoin or cryptophone and its 350 in days
246.93 USD is the bounce level.253-256 should be the true value.Personally I like to buy things with a massive sale (a lot lower).
"FB and the dems would give the medal of freedom to the brick throwers and bomb throwers in Portland & Seattle...not a peep from them burning & stealing ....but these thought police groupthink hypocrites gaslight everyone who disagrees with their globalist agenda....Just like Uber & Lyft just accomplished in California, they want to make every employee a contract worker...then use social credit scores to decide who gets even gets to work at all.....it's coming...."
"without the politics stuff, this is pretty undervalued compared to other big FAANGs"

"FB is gpong down to hell. The whole world after Australia is going after, England all ready is standing by Australia."
"Facebook is, and has always been, a lightning rod for issues outside of its control. Many on this board are viewing the removal of the president's facebook as a violation of the rights granted by the First Amendment and speculate that facebook silences conservative viewpoints that in turn infringes on their rights to freedom of speech. However, this is not a First Amendment issue. Facebook, being a private entity, can censor, remove or suspend any speech that violates their terms and conditions, as agreed to by the user in their ""terms of service"". The first amendment clearly states, ""CONGRESS shall make no law that ... [limits] the freedom of speech"". The government has no power over facebook... nor OAN, nor Fox, nor Newsmax and cannot legally stop the spread of potentially false information. Those individual corporations are proof that the First Amendment is alive and strong. To suggest the removal of the president's accounts from Facebook to Twitter, and all platforms inbetween is somehow a ploy from the left in silencing free speech and the beginning of ""socialism"" or ""communism"" is pure folly as evidenced by the fact that some media outlets have exercised their freedom of speech and insinuated as such. Sorry for the rant. Just exercising my First Amendment right ;). P.S. Long facebook because of their balance sheet and market opportunities in AI."
"Facebook is corrupt; and always HAS BEEN corrupt to everyday average people. Facebook has sold so much information about everybody who joined them, it's not even funny. But most do not care. They simply say that the price you pay. Short the #$%$ out of this criminal company. It's not even a question of whether it's the right move or not."
FB is the king in town! We like this steadily beautifully strong chart!
End of fb
"FB just about peaked in 2020, old people are ones still using FB and hey are dying fast with covid, FB is toast, move on over to green economy & crypto , politicians waged bets there and they are the ones that will write the checks"
This one's going to get broken up pretty soon. It's inevitable. FB TWTR etc. are basically like telephones were 30 years ago. These social media companies are going to end up as utilities.
"The fat cats will probably hold down FB today in an effort to kill off today's 180 call options. All bets are off come Monday which is when I expect the pps to finally start showing some appreciation for the blowout Q3 earnings. Also, don't forget, Q4 is historically FB's best quarter for revenue. I read that mobile is accounting for 70% of ad dollars. Yep, all those ad dollars that were once the exclusive purview of radio, TV, mags and newspapers have found their way into FB's coffers. To wit, have you noticed how ""thin"" your daily local newspaper has gotten? Do you ever remember TV showing so many ads for gold, silver, lawyers and other non-traditional topics? Of course not, and it's because their ad rates have dropped so much the aforesaid group can now afford them. Now, even the smallest local mom and pop biz can afford to advertise on radio as stations drop ad rates like TV.FB? I'm long and strong."
More manipulation than a Chicago election!
"People still complaining about FB while S/P keeps going up, love it"
Mix business with political is big mistake. FB and TWTR are against freedom of speech and American people.
"Yahoo FinanceHow the world’s biggest tech companies are working to prevent free speech.In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, tech companies ranging from Facebook and Twitter to Google have moved to stop the spread of free speech content on their platforms. With the presidential inauguration set for Jan. 20, those sites, as well as others including Shopify and Etsy, have moved to address similar content on their platforms related to the day’s event."
Overwhelming majority of people are in favor and are grateful to Apple for protecting their privacy....I mean cmon Mark u r just looking like the bad guys here and just digging a bigger hole for yourself.
i think low 200 is a great buy
$AAPL $TWTR $AMZN $FB. Look at the charts today. All artificially being pumped up. You’re going to get a few good days but it’s a slow and steady ride to the bottom. People are leaving their products and services because censorship isn’t good for anyone. Regardless of party.
Just checking in on this communist company that censors Americans. Does anyone know if Zuck is flying the communist flags over headquarters yet?
Sell FB-too risky and unpredictable!
Don't even think about buying this. Will only go down from here.
"Lets all follow Cathy....Sell $aapl, $fb and buy $pltr... To the $30 by Friday. Best case scenario, $30 by end of Monday."
"Deleted all social media, show them what we do when they ban our free speech down to 0"
"Time to ban all social media companies, this technology is like a dangerous drug addiction and destroying our society. Life was much better without disgusting social media, we do not need it. We can use traditional / conventional methods of communications and have drug addiction free normal peaceful lives."
Are we defunding the Capitol Police yet? They shot an innocent military vet in the head while she was holding her American Flag..
Coffee trading is a money making machine
"spent 400 million to buy your election, know a no fly zone for senators who dared challenge the election,as did the democrats did, antifa marching in N.Y. with hell mats and face mask no coverage, next stop fracking and gas will go up to $4 a gallon interest rate,s will rise, you will do what your told and do not dare to speak up. but hay keep your face book acct. keep buying from them, keep your twitter act. but only post what they allow become good little sheep. don;t cancel your p.g.a card keep buying coke, just do what your told you bunch of sheep, don;t you dare stand up for freedom of speech."
Short. This. Keyrap. Stock.
Fb up bigly!
"Fb won't dump 30-40% like zoom,tesla or any mega speculative stocks. Sitting at forward 21pe super cheap"
"Very surprised its ONLY 210.00 or so, slowly increasing, that's what goog did, soon to be enormous, You'll wish you bought at this price, wish I had more cash, but I am married, and you know how that goes.... Go FB"
"Stock splits are historically implemented by companies that want to improve the marketability of their shares, which can potentially enhance shareholder value resulting from an increase in demand for the shares. Apple, which went public in 1980, has split its shares FIVE times since then; Google has split its shares TWICE since its shares went public in 2004. These moves by both companies have proven to be extremely financially beneficial to shareholders. Facebook, in contrast, has refused to offer a share split because that action would not be advantageous to Mark Zuckerberg, even though shareholders could greatly benefit from a split. The share split should have happened a while ago but it seems highly unlikely to happen, as shareholder interests are secondary to the company’s management team. To better promote the interests of shareholders, I am asking other shareholders to join me in demanding the resignations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. A management team change is long overdue, and it’s critical we push for the installation of a new team to better represent shareholder interests. Zuckerberg and Sandberg MUST GO!"
"This morning I was hoping FB would hold $250.00. Looked good for a while, especially after it turned green around mid-morning. But, alas, it was not to be. Instead, now hoping FB can hold $240by Friday's close. Friday's are always a tad goofy, so have no idea what to expect. But the self-inflicted negative cloud hanging over FB ain't gonna go away on its own. Plus, Zuck doesn't look like he's about to rescind his censorship ban anytime soon. Big mistake on his part IMHO."
Facebook is nothing more than a hate group. Leave now or you will be labeled as part of a hate group!
"I just cancelled my $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts. Next, im selling their stocks at 9a, im not waiting until 930a!"
FAKEBOOK. The number of people getting out of anything FAKEBOOK is stunning and makes one proud to be an AMERICAN. Boolean

Why is fb lagging everyone else in coming back to green today? Mfst is almost there. BABA already gained $3. But FB not moving
"Democrats have all been fooled. They are tools. They follow CNN and MSNBC with their mouths open and their hands on the remote-- waiting to flip back to the other news source when something stimulating is not on. CNN MSNBC CNN MSNBC. Then, they hit the real drugs. Meth, Pot, Cocaine, Beer.....it's all in a good night for a democrat."

"Tomorrow you can advertise the election fraud again on FB! Women in Mississippi just got arrested for election fraud. A small case, but a good start to letting people know how big the election fraud got."
Wow. Amazing market manipulation after hours. This is just like 1999. This is a total value play at a PE of 15. I think it is hilarious.
"Regulators on their way in, Takeover coming and Zuck will be in cuffs soon for the millions given to promote the fraud in Ga."
Yahoo deleted this 2 times now; I said there was no good reason to ban Ron Paul. He is a voice of reason
FB will fall atleast 68 points after earning.
"$1,000 by June"
Everything will be fine after earnings and @ $175.00 again
Facebook longs still waiting for their first dividend.....keep waiting!
Short for quick scalp
"I wasn’t sure before, but $195 next week is now in play. Next Wednesday would mark a month since the most recent FB death cross. A FB death cross seems to be a reliable oversold rally indicator. The previous two death crosses marked oversold rallies to all time highs about a month later."
The P/E ratio of 26 is laughable for a company growing it's revenue 25%. It won't be long before it reaches 350.
we all know people who have stopped using FAKEBOOK so extrapolate that out and you know things are getting bad.
Just assisted 2 additional neighbors (they hunted me down) here in WA to close their FB account. This is spreading like fire. Fakebook is so done based on what I see.
44 analysts. Average price target $322!!!
SHORT this to ZERO
over 270 today?
"The actions of social media companies like Twitter and Facebook are not just national brands, they are global. Their actions over the last several months have shown how manipulative they are in regards to freedom of expression, and personal views if they do not ""conform"" to their Socialist ideals. Glad to see them both heading South."
"Although many may not realize it, FB should probably classify, at least to some degree, as a ""reopening"" stock. Because it's a social media platform, this spring and summer will likely yield more people going out, taking photos and videos, meeting up with friends/family, travel and leisure companies increasing their adspend etc. In my opinion, this stock should do pretty heading into the spring and may even exceed expectations. Of course, do your own research and assess your risk tolerance before investing."
Investors are waking up to facebook is not returning any capital in form of dividends. It is not like they don't have the cash! Don't get Zucked!
Someone needs to tell Zuck that apple provides and product and service people need. While FB is a product no one needs and fewer and fewer people want.
Only 30 shares. Glad I didn't panic sell as FB is just a cash machine.
"Nice. Fell 4% today. Tomorrow will be another red day. This social dilemma contributor will pay for all the lives they have ruined. Oh and shutting off our President isn't the only reason. This has poisoned our society as a whole. Watch ""the Social Dilemma on Netflix. Better watch it soon before AMZN pulls it. It's all part of their brainwashing tactic."
Sold my shares and bought Tesla....no regrets!
Bought today $253 this company is a monopoly. No one can compete
Sell before its too late
Don't sell at this price. Its certain to recover and then some.
"A fund manager has stated: ""I can no longer consider FB for investment based on the bigotry against conservatives and election interference the company has engaged in worldwide. FB does not meet our ESG standards""."
I think the GA runoffs are holding FB down. A democratic sweep in GA will open the path to more regulation targeting FB. Does anybody else feel like this is what is keeping the stock from breaking out over 280?
I don’t understand how deleting the account protects their data. Wasn’t the data already compromised? How is deleting the account now make any difference unless new data is added to Facebook on a regular basis. I am not vouching for Facebook nor do I own the stocks but just try fin to understand. Thanks for any replies.
Do I smell 300

Fight big tech bigotry. Cancel Facebook.
"Scary, I think it can drop to low 200"
"Trading more 20 yrs. FB will soar. EPS/revenues on form 10-K tells me FB 350 correction with gap-ups. Shorties will cry very soon. They're happy for their penny position, but you will see who win in the end. Better buy FB now. I will remind you at the close and Monday pre market. Buy . We are in the beginning the bullish season. We will keep buying at pullback...we don't care if drop more. We accumulate. Shorties will suffer from now. This is time bomb for shoties . FB will soar huge"

"Many people on this thread, want Facebook to reach 300 and that's pretty acceptable to expect as it's not much far from 300 and it's a world famous brand value and only making big profits year after years. Not to be offensive, but as people know that I am still questioning the movement of this stock market. Now some random guy like me on this thread, asking to buy a dollar stock and giving a price target of 300 with such no information about the stock. All I am saying that I am rattling on floor laughing out loudly....."
sell Amazon $AMZN Sell Facebook $FB SELL Twitter $TWTR ....GET OUT!!!!!!
Just started a position yesterday. Hadn’t been purchasing any tech companies due to their ballooned valuation. Little did i know Facebook hadnt been following. Crazy growth and a less than 20 forward pe. Awesome business model with a ton of active users. Really looking forward to adding to my position because this could easily double in 5-10 years. Easily
"Looks like we might have difficulty holding $260 today. Very disappointing situation coming on the heels of excellent Q4-2020 numbers. Dunno. Maybe we need those teeny boppers on Robin Hood to start buying FB and put the squeeze on the shorties? You know, like drive the pps up to $350-$400 where the PE says it belongs. Right now, we are trading for $40 more than where we were ($218) in August of 2018. Not exactly a soaring growth stock when compared to some others."

"Every troll and short on this board have nothing to say except ""fACebOOk iS eViL"" and ""mE aND mY NeigHbOR deActIvATed"". Ha. Reality is Facebook is a money making machine and one of the cheapest big cap growth stocks in the market at these levels. Bring me some real numbers is you're bearish. If not, all you have is your glass half empty opinion."
"Whether or not Facebook is good for society is certainly debatable, but one thing isn't: Facebook is an outstanding business, and the stock has been nothing but a winner since its 2012 IPO. Despite the controversy and even a Democratic takeover of Congressional leadership and the presidency, the stock still looks poised for a strong 2021. Advertisement , The company was handed a $5 billion fine by the FTC in 2019, but the stock barely flinched. The ""worst-case"" scenario of a company breakup seems unlikely, and even if it came to pass, the business could be more valuable with Instagram as a stand-alone entity, No one knows what will happen to the market this year, and the bubble could expand, favoring stocks that have already seen a sudden rise, but there's no doubt Facebook will be standing strong whenever the bubble pops. It has $55 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt; it generates mountains of profits that underpin its valuation, and its user and advertiser bases have proven to be sticky over the years."

I just modeled it out and it looks like FB will drop to the $183.17-184.12 range by the end of the week. Longs you are forgetting that a PE changes when the E changes( earnings) my model shows that FB earnings will actually decline due to higher expenses).

I suspect the last buying that came in to stem the carnage was THE ZUCK TEAM....now...it was lame and you can see that SELLING PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE AND WILL LIKELY ACCELERATE. The accelerant he has laid upon FAKEBOOK is not one you can make disappear. He has tried to side with POWER whether it was RIGHT or now LEFT so it is all MONEY BASED NOT IDEOLOGICAL BASED. Everyone now sees that so FAKEBOOK IS TOAST. Anyone considering buying the proverbial DIP will find that it was...indeed....a very bad idea. The SS FAKEBOOK and CAPTAIN ZUCK entered dangerous waters on their own and now the stock will be economically destroyed. This will be lesson told in business courses for years to come. Boolean

I feel supporters of the administration should strongly consider selling their FB now rather than face an even larger dropoff later in the week. Twitter as well

"alright....here's the deal. This is merely FB's toe-in-the-door into the world of finance...and what a huge move. Once this gets rolling, there will be no stopping it.....every major company in the world will want in, or they run the risk of being left behind.But wait, it gets better. After this move is established, next move is in insurance.....HUGE profit margins! FB will change the insurance markets exactly the same way they will change the financial markets. Both segments will be automated.....no moving parts....total automation. Zuckerberg is smart, in a very simplistic way. He doesn't want to get into all the logistics of Amazon...or WalMart....way too many moving pieces. My guess, by the end of next year, once things get rolling, FB will be around $500 a share....which is less than a 150% increase from where it is now. Very do-able."
Does FB cooperate with the suppression of the Chinese people? Hmmm?

"All of the celebrating on fake earnings. No way FB can increase earnings when their user base is tanking. Ad revenue is fake, bloated on bot traffic. FB can keep up this charade for awhile, but the truth always catches up."
FB is Socialist platform. Deserve to be shutdown!
"I find it interesting that the stock is down because someone said that the ban could result in a 10% loss of business. Not to get political and bash anyone but I don't think the current president is that important and that much of an interest in my everyday life. Some of the things he says and does is comical and good entertainment but its making a mountain out of a molehill. At the end of the day, facebook sells lots of ads for those of us who socialize on their sites. And doesn't facebook own instagram too and they blew it out of the water last quarter. I bought at today's low and don't think it will trade at this price again anytime soon. Their earnings are coming out in a couple of weeks. Am I missing something or just a lot of political bashing one way or other here?"
"I am hanging in their because it is still growing at 20%. Apple is anti-competitive with pre installing iMessage which only works on Apple devices.

"FB value will someday exceed Alphabet search (which is 80 or 90 percent of Alphabet now). Users cannot leave FB because thats their vrtual bar/coffee shop/family gathering. If someone constantly bothers you to buy something in your favorite coffee shop you might leave someday. Zuckerberg is right. The best way to make money is to give users the best experience. FB will have more information about ""who is interested in purchasing cars"", ""what people's opinion is"". FB can also play the role of yelp or amazon reviews. Because they can create Forum or mine people's opinion on different products. At the end they have to do it by not interrupting the users preferred way of online socialization. They might be invasive, but discreet. To cover all the bases the investors have to put money in FB, AMZN and GOOG."

"So someone with power can insight riot on any social megaphone and it is ok if you voted for them, but the media that they can no longer use is suppose to be free to use any way? I think there is a demand for stock as IRA money flood during tax time, and funds leaving bond funds, and buying stocks that create a demand for that stock. Facebook stock. The same stock today, that you drive the price down, will be double by the end of the year because of the solid balance sheet and tons of cash. Hell, FB might even be buying back their shares."
Facebook just deleted the #walkaway page. They are at war with anyone who doesn’t think the way Facebook wants. That’s the very definition of fascism. Please delete your Facebook pages. I’m complaining to my ISP to block them.

It would be nice to see FB pay a dividend. I did not realize the money you make on dividends until I bought Apples years ago. I look at the free stock I get on every payout and it adds up. Talk to people who have owned stocked with dividends. The new thing for me is to add up reinvested dividends back into  Apple and multiple it by stock price and it's 10s of thousands of dollars. It is nice to be paid while you wait for the stock to move up.

What you do is your perogative, and most would go through withdraw if they left these platforms. But if you want to hurt facebook, do not buy any shares, and let the shorts run this to the ground!! It's not the action of short selling that hurts a stock, it's more short sellers than buyers that can drive a nail through it's socialist black heart! Besides, there are much better companies to invest in. This stock is garbage and will drop overnight in the next few months because of censorship!! Don't buy!! You'll be throwing your money away!! The more people that abandon facebook, the least likely smart money (hedgefunds, investment institutions, etc) and advertising agents will invest. Food for thought."
FB could break higher at the closing bell!- Selling programs are over and bulls are stepping up to buy at this bargain bin price.- This is free money if you have ability to look to FB's earnings and beyond!

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-may-vastly-overpaid-data-022704042.htmlWhen the $5 billion settlement penalty for privacy violations was announced in 2019,I thought it was an outrageous amount. The attached article discusses how the fee was significantly higher than the maximum amount recommended for the violation of privacy issues detailed. The big question posed by a study done by a law firm for shareholders is this: why did Facebook pay a penalty almost $4.9 billion higher than recommended? Was the settlement agreement forged to prevent the release of sensitive information that incriminated Zuckerberg?? It’s very possible that shareholders lost $4.9 billion in profitability in 2019 to protect Zuckerberg."

"Maryland becomes the first state to tax on digital ads from Facebook, GoogleMaryland has approved the country's first tax on the revenue brought in from digital advertisements placed by companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.On Friday, the State Senate voted to override the governor's veto of the measure following a similar vote from the House of Delegates, The New York Times reports. The measure is expected to generate as much as $250 million in its first year.The Maryland tax specifically applies to digital ads that are displayed within the state. It's also levied based on the ad sales that a company generates. Companies that make at least $100 million to $1 billion a year will be taxed at a 2.5% rate. Companies that make more than $15 billion — which includes Facebook and google — will face a 10% tax on digital ad revenue.Legislators in Connecticut and Indiana have already introduced similar measures to tax social media giants.The tax legislation is just part of a growing debate about the dominance and power of technology giants. In the U.S., companies like Facebook and Google are facing multiple antitrust lawsuits. Antitrust legislation introduced at the federal level could target those companies. The measures in the U.S. also follow in the footsteps of governments in Europe, which have introduced both new restrictions targeting Facebook and Google."
"Facebook overpaid in data privacy settlement to protect Zuckerberg (Reuters) - Facebook Inc may have paid $4.9 billion more than the maximum penalty it faced under a settlement agreement with regulators related to allegations it mishandled user privacy, according to a Wednesday court ruling.The information made public by a Delaware judge who gleaned it from a ""white paper"" prepared by a law firm advising Facebook's board of directors as they debated a proposed $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also protected Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery cited the paper by Gibson Dunn attorneys in his ruling directing Facebook to turn over documents to shareholders who are trying to determine if Facebook overpaid to protect Zuckerberg.""The documents already produced provide no insight into why Facebook would pay more than its (apparently) maximum exposure to settle a claim,"" said Slights in the ruling. Shareholders, he said, were ""right to question whether internal communications among Facebook fiduciaries might shed light on the Board’s thinking in this regard.""Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The July 2019 deal resolved allegations Facebook mishandled user privacy. The company did not admit wrongdoing.Slights said Facebook faced a maximum penalty of about $104 million, according to the Gibson Dunn paper.The FTC did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Joel Fleming, an attorney for the Facebook shareholders, told Slights during a hearing last year that before they sue over the FTC settlement they wanted to know: ""Did anyone say, 'Go ask the FTC, would you take less money if Mr. Zuckerberg is personally liable'?""Slights refused to order the company to turn over documents that Facebook said were protected by attorney-client privilege, in part because the judge said shareholders could gain insights from non-privileged electronic communications he was ordering to be disclosed."

So I thought it was looking like 245 was a real possibility (removing the emotion out of it and how irrational/stupid that is).We have three black crows (a bearish reversal pattern consisting of three consecutive long red candlestick bodies where each body closes at or near its low of the previous day).Looks like a bearish reversal.But if you look at MACD and CMF it suggests the buying pressure is ramping up.About 3 hours before close the RSI found support at its level when the SP was @ 245.MACD turned green and we saw a bullish crossover.CMF also picking up big.I would guess we see a recovery next week.Either way I dont think this will break the support at 245.Would buy big if it drops at open as downside seems limited.

This is such a no brainer to 325s this year. Facebook has doubled digit earnings growth and value compared to peer group. They are the best advertising company on line. I used them and they 3x my biz this year alone with a budget of 25k. Paid it self over and over. the trade desk is the only other comp I think that is as well run. TTD but I wait for 500.

Don't know what it's gonna take to get FB anywhere near those lofty price targets. Obviously, good earnings ain't doing the trick. JMHO, but if Zuck stepped a side, or at minimum, took a less visible position within the company, that might be interpreted as a good sign by WS."

"$SNAP has a tremendous opportunity out in front of it. Numerous years of ~50%+ revenue growth is enough to justify an even greater valuation in my opinion. Long-term we have an easy bull-case: targeting, ad platform, optimization, and Snap Ad analytics improve, enabling eCPM (ad pricing) growth. In addition, new streamlined product (five parts of Snapchat) enable new ad inventory to be opened up. This allows a lot more impressions per user (i.e. higher ARPU). In addition, lack of content moderation costs relative to platforms like $TWTR and $FB enables higher long-term margin profile. In my view, not financial advice WHATSOEVER, this couldn't be a clearer buying opportunity."

Public SEC fillings show insiders all dumping large amounts of shares every month of FB and not buying. Never a good indicator when the founders are all liquidating their fortunes as fast as legally possible.￼
I'm so HAPPY I sold all of my FB stock...good riddance!

FB solid even during these red days! there you go my boy!
Lol I just bought at the opening under 262.Bargain. But it sucks to see this money making machine this red when everything else is flying.CAT passed 190 with a gain of +7% and now their pe ratio is higher than FB even though their earnings are down 50% and their revenue is down 22% while FB rev goes up +20% a yr and earnings +25% a year.It's a joke.But everything corrects itself so I'm just accumulating and I just sold Cat 10 mins ago.

"After looking into detail policy changes, just want to share this with you all:Short version: your personal conversations remain personal and encrypted. WhatsApp’s data sharing hasn’t really changed, its security hasn’t changed, it remains the largest end-to-end encrypted platform available.Long version:Keeping aside any jokes on what valuable or secret data you are really trying to protect...1. WhatsApp is still end to end encrypted, which means that ALL your chat threads (group or 1:1) as well as your voice/video calls are entirely secure and only available to you and the people you are talking to. Yes, that includes all your naughty content too.2. Your contact list on the phone that you use for looking up contacts and sending messages to/calling people, is not shared with anyone, including Facebook.3. The only time you have to worry about your data “leaking” is when you backup your WhatsApp messages to iCloud (if you are on iPhone) or equivalent Android backup service. To be able to restore that data on a new device, the backup file is not encrypted. So please protect your iCloud backups well.4. So what are the real changes? *In future* IF and WHEN you start using WhatsApp to send messages to businesses or do payment transactions, the shopping data can be shared with merchants and Facebook to improve their services (example making your Ads more personalized for you). When in future will this happen? Your guess is as good as mine...5. If nothing really has changed, why all this noise? Or a more candid version of this - why can’t WhatsApp explain this in simple language? WhatsApp over-communicates and proactively shares even the slightest change that might impact its extremely high standards on privacy to run an end to end encrypted private messaging service for 2 Billion people. Good learning for us that technically nuanced and accurate messaging doesn’t work at 2B people scale.6. Can you give feedback to the WhatsApp team about this? Absolutely. See a more detailed response from the head of WhatsApp: https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660768225841152…7. Do I need to pay for a private/secure version of WhatsApp? Heck no. Please don’t fall for any such scams. There is only one secure, private version of WhatsApp and that is FREE for all the 2 billion people who use it. And yes, feel free to forward this to your friends and family."
This should be 300+.
Fb won’t got to 300 till prolly next week
.......I was in FB two years ago and it made money for the Shareholders and I was quite happy with it.....But since then it almost got to $300.00 then pulls back......How can you stand this if you are long FB?.....You don’t even get a dividend for Waiting.......Conclusions BUY.......XOM NOW and make .87 for every share and your investment could Double by the end of the year.......just saying......
With the new earnings this stock is a way undervalued compare with current market valuation! We just need green day and FB catch up it’s valuation!

"Facebook to pay record $5 billion U.S. fine over privacy violations WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) will pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices and the social media giant will restructure its approach to privacy, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to adopt the settlement, which requires court approval, even as Democrats said the settlement did not go far enough or require a large enough fine.“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how personal information is shared Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a Republican, in a statement.But Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the penalty provided “blanket immunity” for Facebook executives “and no real restraints on Facebook’s business model” and does “not fix the core problems that led to these violations.”Facebook declined to comment ahead of the settlement’s public release.The FTC said that Facebook’s data policy was deceptive to “tens of millions” of people who used Facebook’s facial recognition tool and also violated its rules against deceptive practices when it did not disclose phone numbers collected to enable a security feature would be used for advertising.Under the settlement, Facebook’s board will create an independent privacy committee that removes “unfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.”Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ftc/facebook-to-pay-record-5-billion-u-s-fine-over-privacy-violations-but-critics-call-it-a-bargain-idUSKCN1UJ1L9"
I pulled out profits @$286. Didn't expect to see that come around this morning. Hope to get back in at a better entry point
How many people actually think FB could sustain 300+ if they continue to get fined for violating laws and data mining. Without instagram this would be a company in decline yes or yes. Insta is worse now to but all they care about is making it a cash cow which is backfiring bc there losing users.
Did FB shut down GME chat group to help hedge funds
Hope everyone has a nice trading day tomorrow. I know we are not out of the woods yet but I’m glad things are calming down a bit

"Facebook reports earnings on January 31. I still think Zuckerberg already knows Facebook will be reporting a record quarter for revenues and profits on January 31, which is WHY Zuckerberg chose to report about the FB crack down on fake news feeds now. The euphoria of a solid earnings report should overcome the temporary pain of the current fall in FB stock price. Look for the FB stock price to rebound going into earnings on January 31 and beyond. Long FB"

How exactly do they make money at Facebook?
"While I'm new to this board, I figured I would share my thoughts on $SNAP at ~$57/share and why I see a tear to $100. Used to be a bear, even held a short, but am now heavily exposed on the long side for a few reason. Firstly, $SNAP has great demographic exposure: the young audience. A case can be made (Big E) that TikTok is stealing users away from $SNAP. But it's just not true. In 4Q, $SNAP added a record number of sequential DAUs, and was able to monetize them at scale. In addition, we saw ~58% gross margins in 4Q (and that factors in an acceptable 500bps headwind from Spotlight) as $SNAP builds out their TikTok competitor in Spotlight. At this point, $SNAP has raw ARPU inertia going for it. In 2020, $FB monetized their global user base at ~$45/DAU. SNAP is at ~$10. So, you've got a 4.5x revenue growth opportunity from improved monetization alone, not even factoring in user growth, which has been accelerating (in terms of sequential adds). Now, the company is guiding for multiple years of ~50%+ rev. growth based solely on monetization expansion, implying that the 50% number could be conservative. This puts it among the top tier growth companies in tech, meaning a premium valuation is warranted."
Nothing can stop us

deleted FB todayFYI if and when you leave Facebook if you want to make sure you have all of your pictures and timeline photos you have to go to settings on Facebook and there is a link where you can download all of your data. it will download it to a zip file which you can save to your computer. Easy way to get all your pictures and videos
To all Facebook shareholders please get out as soon as possible!
I just bought more .
Is this the new social media? I.e Yahoo! finance lol
Hows that dividend plan coming along for this no growth company!
So strong direction! Heading north all the way to the best earnings report! 
Huge hedge fund taking short position in Facebook!Hold on for the ride boys!!!!
I am surprised that the governments of the world do not tax social media's ad revenue like they do cigarettes...boose...gas...
Facebook has no problem with violence and nudity on their sites but Republican freedom of speech is where they draw the line. nice priorities.
"Hope Powell do the right things (keep interest unchanged, says no inflation and promises The Fed will support stock market with any means) at 2 PM so the stock market can continue rallying."
"I am seeing better products to buy on Facebook so why would I sell, because its giving me better products? I use Facebook 2 hours (in the aggregate on a daily basis) to stay connected to friends. I've been a member since 2004 but only began purchasing items in 2020. So unless you are telling me to sell because 256 already prices in folks like me converting to ""purchasers"" on the FB platform, I am staying."
It’s Un-American to have an account with these 2 communist owned companies. $TWTR $FB

Thank you Real Peaceful Patriots! #GodWins #WeThePeople but I don't be happy until they go Bankrupt. Get your kids of FaceBook go have them call a friend instead. Use FaceTime or get them to create their own!

"FB, uhm is it overvalued I can never understand except that it has data.... speaking of data, OPRA, opera limited is another strong company to look into closely (amazing fundamentals (so much $$) with over 50% profit margins) with over 80 million users, gives ad free browsing and free VPN security. data is the new oil.... Long on both.... happy new year all!!"

Let's keep going Facebook!These social media sites were doing a patriotic duty from allowing domestic terrorists and insurrection from destroying our now fragile democracy. Those who STILL think trump wasn't lying about fraud (NO EVIDENCE PROVIDED YET!!!!) only to save his orange #$%$ makes you a manipulated sucker still.

Think about how expensive other tech stocks are right now... Facebook is extremely cheap and it has lagged the market run up this year. Catch up rally mode!
How is this only at 153.60? It should really be $120 right now.
TAOp stock soaring now soaring loaded 30k
FB should be dropping $20 a share for dumping the giant Australia
the CEO of fakebook should be imo PUT ON THE CROSS!!!!!!
"nobody under 21 uses facebook, instagram is just propaganda, what’s app has no moat anymore"
Facebook and Twitter are an assault on free speech. My money will be moving away from them and to other platforms which are not geared towards pushing only one message. I am beyond disappointed.
Chinese Zuck... The Buddhist
FB and AMC is safest plays on maket buy and hold.
Looking like FB valuation and fundamentals are starting to matter again. And the noise no longer matters. Finally! (Fingers crossed)
"$MSFT $GOOG $WIMI $FB AR HUD is to use augmented reality technology (AR) to integrate advanced driving assistance systems, such as ADAS and ACC, to project navigation and driving information to the front of the vehicle, and combine it with the real object in front, so as to obtain a better driving experience.The demonstration of holographic technology is exactly how the final pole of AR-HUD will be presented."
By cancelling Facebook I am effectively taking a knee to them. Paybacks are costly Zuck. You angered at least half the country and opened the door to more competition.
"let's go FB. good earnings, now time to head into earnings call and blow investors awau"
Pretty clear $amzn likely bottom as well as $fb but $googl $msft $aapl are heavy as f. Google has a 1950 gap to fill
Where do people go to post their outrage lol. FACEBOOK.
"Mark...come to your senses, you are generating tremendous amounts of bad will. The optics are not good for you here. News agencies employees need to eat too, you are capturing all the ad revenue generated by all the shares and likes of news articles. That content makes your platform a better value proposition, and you need to come to a compromise and allow some ad sharing revenue. You frankly are being greedy and hiding behind your facebook users. Google has already come to a compromise. The news article generates views, likes,shares, increases advertising dollars spent, etc and you should treat the news agencies that are part of this virtuous cycle by compensating them as your company is compensated. You are tempting to incur the wrath of the global community and nations over this payment dispute."
Nothing you can do. Like I’ve told everyone...when you aren’t making hay on green markets....look what happens on red markets.
ANOTHER CHANCE TO SELL!$FB TWTR $GOOG $AAPL $AMZN
"I am a longterm investor and have been in facebook since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. I added in 2018 after the -20% plummet when they missed on user growth, profit & revenue. I trimmed most of my position down to peanuts today. The balance sheet is pristine and I wasn't worried about anti-trust issues or fines imposed on Facebook. However, the privacy policy change by Apple could cripple facebook. I'm exiting early before the bloodshed. Any investor in Facebook who misses the immediate threat to the core of facebook's business would be wise to educate on the changes coming to iOS."
Facebook is up 4.91% to 285.50
"Bail out, FB is losing users"
"FB might not get dumped as bad as twitter, but it is trending down. get out if you still love your freedom. if you continue to support them, your grand children will be living under communist rules, just like china. get out, get out now"
The unions were lied to directly to their face by the current president and vice president. Ending fracking in the oil fields and cancelling the Excel Pipeline which cost thousands of really good union jobs on the very first day of the new administration. The unions supported the current president and they have been betrayed bigtime. The Teamsters and the AFL-CIO and others now have real buyers remorse. They now realize their support was a mistake and wish they could take it all back.
"I noticed all good names are down right now, like MA, V and etc...weird"
I have just deleted my Facebook account. It feels so good... refreshing. Of course I?ve also sold the few shares I had on this #$%$

Sell this oligarch stock like FB
NO STRENGTH IN THE CHART so DON'T BUY THE DIP HERE. It is going DOWN
Bought the dip. Love it. And guess what... don’t post what you don’t want shared (period) but keeps me connected to people I know all over the world. I don’t see myself leaving the platform any time soon
Lol people still short FB? I feel bad
"Can't facebook add a feature to their app that rewards a customer for activating the ""ad tracking"" feature. Yes, i consider it a feature. Why would anyone want non-targeted ads on their feed. I much prefer ads for thing I'm shopping for currently and I actively click on Facebook ads and engage with them. (I want more curation in my life.. not less)."
Lol FB -.- not going anywhere no up no down.
When FB sees that Google has installed revolutionary View Smart Glass(CFii) on it’s new 1.3 million sq foot New York City headquarters building they most likely follow.I expect all top tier office buildings will compelled to follow to stay competitive.

Awesome news to drive the share price to new heights."
"Banning individuals and denying free speech by $TWTR $GOOG $APPL $FB will not be tolerated. It is the surest sign that big tech needs to be broken up. Consolidation and concentration of any type of power (power, money, influence) inevitably lead to abuse of that power. Ironic that GOOGs first motto was ""do no evil."" They may all think they are too big to fail. I guess that depends on how you define ""fail."" In my opinion, they just did."
FB is whipping post for something EVERY social media outlet is doing. NONSENSE!!
Mark Zuckerberg is unethical as are several of these tech companies that utilize user’s information to direct ads. Jack Dorsey is another example of an unethical CEO. FB will lose any battle with Apple. Ethical vs unethical. The battle has began. Let’s Rumble!
"The winning play in FB stock is to go long, stay strong, buy the “inflection dips” — ignore the noise — and just keep on. Keeping on!*** It’s been the winning play since FB IPO’d.- There is nothing wrong with FB’s juggernaut business, performance that would indicates weakness!"
Hopefully everyone does sell. This is a behemoth of a company. There's no debt and they're doing well in the vr.
That $40 billion they had will probably be half of that next earnings.
To be honest when i see ads related to my searches it creeps me out. I dont like it at all so if there is an option i will say not to share my info all the time
WOW - BREAKING NOW THE LOWER BAR....Sell as I told you. Boolean

The trouble is When you can't Trust Facebook or Zuckerberg........You can't trust their ADs!!!....Just like Microsoft edge.....Ads are so Fake!
My elderly neighbor needed help with her FB login this morning. She understands FB has been cancelled and the account and app was deleted. She was very happy when I departed.
"This is the only stock I keep buying right now. Ready for it to catch up soon, MMs keeping it down pushing us out. Oculus is big, no big news still on it"
When will the government allow the people to borrow money at real negative rates. If you could get a 30 year mortgage at 2% or borrow for a new car or anything else for that matter the economy would go parabolic.

Take this scrumbag back to $50 ya.
I love how the LONGS say I’mStill holding when their own CEO cashed out tons of his shares. Zuckerberg is laughing at you.
FB drops below $200 by week’s end
If I had cash I'd be buying a boatload of FB. The stock is so undervalued right now its a screaming buy. There is a ton of noise right now in the FB universe affecting the share price but if you are thinking long term; 5-years from now the stock will be up significantly. Buy when people are beating down a great company. Sell when people are euphoric about a great company.
If zuck only allowed free speech and stoppes his fake fact checking this stock would be 600 .
"Imo going under $250, downward pressure just too strong!"

FB is generating a fortune in advertising revenue. The number of targeted ads I get when on is huge.
I bought more today for the first time in over a year.
"It's time to cancel the cancel culture. This is what happens when whiny children are coddled by their lazy parents and never disciplined for acting like brats. When a millennial or one that belongs to the alphabet generations applies for a job at our company the first thing HR asks them to see is all their social media accounts. FB, TWTR any dating sites, etc. If they refuse they are told we'll get back to you and they never get a call. If they comply then their backgrounds are vetted better than those of most of the incompetent rubes in DC. The process works pretty good and thank God it's in place because there have been some train wrecks and potential problems who never got calls to come back for a second interview."
"Take a look around the world and what's going on right now hey, we're in this position because of overprinting currencies with no back stop and our only leverages, our security against the total CONTROL by CRYPTO-CURRENCY, big social media that cut you off, big banking collaborating, and the government all on the same page what chance do you have? (game over for the taxpayers, and unleashing of unlimited spending,oh, and turn out the lights and you got, GOOSE EGG!) Our VOICE! Gold and silver, and how we spend our MONIES which is stifling the powers-that-be, that are blindly PUSHING us, into a future of no investment in PEOPLE,,,,,,,,,, THINK! Overprint for our PEOPLES NEEDS stop the vote for giveaways oh, accountability out there for for those doing harm to the economy, begin a campaign to rebuild Pride, of rebuilding America to more mirror what this country was founded on oh, restore faith and confidence in our government with term limits, accountability mass elections oh, and those that did not like this country, the beauty of this country is you have a choice you can leave"
Facebook's latest push is to legitimize highly speculative climate change theory by suppressing those who utter facts and hard science that don't support the fad.
"FB will go UP very soon and the revenues this year will be unprecedented. Here is why: First of all, the outrage regarding the changes to wassap privacy policy are just noise. The people will “click” accept like they do with ‘cookies’ and EVERY other privacy policy. Yes, there are other social networks and messaging apps, but the FB ecosystem is the most profitable trifecta since GOOG. For instance, there are other alternatives to Google search and YouTube, nevertheless, go ahead and try to find something on Bing or use DailyMotion to reach more customers.It isn't worth it. And why is that? Because like GOOG, FB knows their users very very well and they know what to do to still be relevant, but more importantly, profitable. The amount of information that FB have on their users and the unparalleled amount that they will gather now with the changes to wassap PP, will create the worlds biggest reserve of the most valuable asset: Data."
FB is finishing off this ūber-Powerful day in a strong  position that bodes well for the next 6 months!!!*** Whatta FB Bonanza!
facebook doesn't have the right to do what they have been doing...take back america people...this is not about politics..this is about freedom...sell...be done with facebook...look what this world has become..make a stand stock holders. sell. sell sell

Which Amendment to the Constitution does FB despise today?
I personally think the police forces and government should be THANKING facebook and big tech for making their jobs easy. Irrefutable archived video evidence of all the malfeasances. No one would have been arrested had the evidence not been posted on social media? am I wrong?

People Instagram is the future! Watch for guidance during the earnings call to focus on Insta user growth & future prospects rather than FB. FB is important but Instagram is where sub-30 year olds go to meet...with more users on Insta than Snapchat and a proven ad model- FB as a co. will absolutely destroy earnings. Watch for a Neftflix like move after earnings announced.

People without jobs that have time to go to rallies and break the law by attacking the capital, may not have that much disposable cash, I am just guessing here. I didnt see alot of 18 to 40 year olds out there, those are the advertisers target. FB has a few Billion on it, and they are not just in the US. I dont think Zuck is too worried today.

"There are some segments of people who are not really participating in social media such as Facebook or Twitter, or they do but their opinions are mostly of not trusted personal thoughts or of twisted information in nature. Those people are probably highly educated ones such as engineers, scientists, wisdom folks, etc., or high-level officials, such as government employees, company executives, media reporters, etc., or high tech people (such as Facebook or Google employees), or agencies such as NSA, FBI, CIA employees, etc. And many more.Big data analysis without those ""big"" people in the on any topic (including climate change, same-sex marriage, prevalence of ""something"") is likely biased."
"Facebook predicts 'significant' obstacles to ad targeting and revenue in 2021In the ""CFO outlook"" section of the earnings release, Facebook said it anticipates facing ""more significant advertising headwinds"" this year.""This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,"" the company wrote. ""While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning late in the first quarter.""Facebook has already been waging a bit of a campaign against Apple's upcoming privacy changes, which will require app developers to ask users for permission in order to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting — although the PR focus has been the impact on small businesses, not Facebook.Facebook also highlighted two broad economic trends that it says has benefited from during the pandemic: The ""ongoing shift towards online commerce"" and ""the shift in consumer demand towards products and away from services."" But again, it took a cautious stance, writing that ""a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth."""
The users control the fate of Facebook and Twitter
Is strange that with such great quarter there is selling pressure. There is something larger going on. Maybe people want out of the stock market or manipulation.

Analysts are again raising FB price targets after yesterday’s report.
"keep your eye on the Facebook investor Relations website for the quarterly earnings release. Ignore the swings that some traders and hedge funds do after hours before earnings releases to try to scare people into selling out. Also stay tuned to the earnings call at 5:00pm ET, which is also accessed on the company website, to see if they comment on any other developments, discuss the dividend earnings will be huge"
"This stock must be at least 300 Great earnings,great balance sheet.I understand the pressure here but buy and hold this is flying soon"

"After the Policy upgrade of Whatsapp about collecting and sharing user information with facebook, and allowing usage of personal information of each user, there has been a big decrease in number of users of Whatsapp in Turkey. Just in 2 days, 7 million users have closed their whatsapp account and have started using Telegram, Signal and BiP. Not respecting the freedom of speech is also another downside of this company. Honestly speaking, I stopped using all of social media a long time ago, and I am glad I was right to do so. Number of users are going to significantly decrease in my opinion."
"$AMZN - Now that Amazon is being sued by Parler for removing them from their hosting site AWS for allegedly violating Amazon's standards, will they be inclined to remove $TWTR and $FB, two of their largest clients for the same reasons? People post violence and threats all day long on FB and TWTR."

"How many shareholders love the unpredictable and volatile nature of Facebook stock? NO ONE does! Stock price instability and price volatility are a reflection of uncertainty; uncertainty is indicative of a poor communications strategy; a poor communications strategy is a function of a combination of inept management, arrogance, and deficient leadership skills.

This is unfair and people won’t like it or stand for it. I hope this is the beginning of the end of Facebook, or to put another way, Facebook goes down MySpace path."

"Nice Move Zuck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Facebook to allow users view into Internet-wide trackingMay 1, 2018 12:03 PM ET|About: Facebook (FB)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor In the latest word on privacy tools/enhancements from Facebook (FB -0.6%), the company says it's building a ""Clear History"" feature that will give users a view into what sites are tracking them across the Web along with the power to manage that information.The new feature ""will enable you to see the websites and apps that send us information when you use them, delete this information from your account, and turn off our ability to store it associated with your account going forward,"" Facebook says in a newsroom post.That commonly covers the ""Like"" button that heavily promulgated across the Web.The company will still provide those apps and sites with aggregated analytics, and says it can do that without storing the information in a way that could be associated with a particular account.Facebook's F8 developer conference is set to get under way in less than an hour."

This company seemingly can't get on the right track and constantly has setbacks. What is management doing? This stock should be $400+ right now but they just can't get it together. Perhaps a change in management is needed.

"FORBES - Thereafter, revenues are expected to grow further to $96.8 billion in 2021. In addition, the EPS figure will likely improve to $10.08, which coupled with the P/E multiple of around 32x will lead to Facebook’s valuation around $321, about 25% upside compared to the current market price."

Key message from earnings season: being a successful one-trick pony no longer garners accolades; the company must have multiple sources of revenue to achieve the gold standard now.
FB target price for Wednesday May 2nd is $177. Trading range $173 to $178.
FB will be more than $500 by end of the year. There will be a PE expansion and a stock split just like Apple last year. They make a ton of money and have 2.5 billion people on their platform. All you naysayers if you have the balls then shut up and just short the stock if you think it will go lower. Just stop whining about politics and privacy issues. You shouldn't go on FB to decide which way to vote AND don't put your sensitive personal info on it. Enough with your nonsense! Give me a thumbs up if you agree!

This is a money making machine
This is a big issue here in Europe: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/whatsapp-facebook-app-privacy-policy. FB paid 19B for Whatsapp but with the current integration to facebook a LOT of users will leave Whatsapp because they don't want to send all that data to FB and dont'want to use a FB account. Even goverments like Netherlands Turkiye are going to leave Whatsapp for other chat applications like signal. This was going to happen: Too bad destroyed whatsapp. No way they are going to make money of that.

"I hadn't used Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram in a long time. I only went on Twitter and Instagram to see the President's pages so deleting those accounts was no big deal to me. If Democrat big tech nerds don't want me on their sites, fine. But the thing that upset me was Parler. I love Parler and Jeff Bozo is EVIL for taking it away. All the 12 million people on there are not criminals. Taking away something for no good reason is RIDICULOUS. Their reasons for taking away things from conservatives are #$%$ Nobody on Parler was planning events or riots or anything. Twitter and Facebook can't say the same, so they need to censor themselves and delete their platforms entirely like they did Parler. COMMUNICATION is important for many reasons, but also it is just HEALTHY for isolated people and elderly people and others to have a way to communicate with other human beings. All the violent and perverted stuff Twitter and FB has and they claim conservatives are the problem? This is going to come back and bite Democrats in the behind."
Forget about Australia.The IOS 14 privacy feature is going to kill their profits.Today for a known paying iOS user install in the US you pay 15 to 40 USD.After the update they will not be able to sell ads in such prices.IMHO their profit is going to drop by a lot.How come that investors don't see that?Anyone?

Market badly needs a 10% correction in order to go higher.
"I have compared FB and MSFT and GOOGL and AMZN and AAPL extensively. In a nutshell, considering past and future growth, FB is by far the cheapest. Amazon and FB's growth stand out. Should have a higher PE ratio than all but AMZN. When taking cash and debt into account, Google and FB stand out for having extremely low debt and lots of cash. This means they can borrow billions if they want to, at very low interest rates. Right now FB should be trading in the $340-$370 range all things considered. I believe FB should announce a huge buyback and this would propel the stock to the $400 ballpark. Would a $100B loan only cost them ~$1B/year in interest. I think this confidence would create far more than $100B in shareholder value. It seemed to work for Advance Auto. Or perhaps they could take a page out of Buffets book and say they will buyback shares under a PE of 35. I already own shares but I am now planning to buy a bunch more and hold until at least $340. I'll probably be using 4 month options."

That should tell you something. This stock isn’t going the way of MySpace or any other defunct business. If you are an investor stay the course. If you’re a trader more power to you. I’m an investor. Long for the next 10 years have a nice day."

I've held this thing for 10 months and this is the first time that I am positive.
"1/10/2021 Sunday on 60 Minutes --->""Nancy Pelosi Just Admitted Why Dems Obstructed COVID Relief Bill For Eight Months""--- ponder that as YOUR bussiness goes under and your kids education fails ---"
New stimulus package fails to provide confidence and virus mutation imposing travel bans around the world.
As FB TWTR continue censor people (Big figures)People around the world continue DISTRUST FB and TWTRAdvertising will PULL OUT for less usersI can see FB TWTR will drop in 1/2 coming week - DON't be holding the bag
Make the Geobbels media outlets pay for their censorship! Vote with your feet and your wallet. They've struck down our freedom of speech. It's time for us to fight back.
"FB is headed higher after this obvious, early round of profit taking.*** Go long to stay strong in the FB winner!"
FACEBOOK CENSORS HALF OF AMERICA. SELL
Sold all my FB stocks.
watch the close when sellers move in en masse'
"FB UPGRADE: Oppenheimer this afternoon raised FB’s price target to $345 from $300— In detail notes to their customers:- They estimated above average Q4 results, based on 30% year over year increase in ad revenue based on U.S. Media Data showing — U.S. Digital Spend rose +29% vs Q3’s +12.9%, and; +31.9% YOY from Q4 2019!*** Maintains outperform.- Credit Suisse maintained FB at outperform in the pre-opening bell."

This company needs to figure out how to control the dissemination of false/fake news. In its current iteration it is a serious threat to democracy.
Bottom line 28.5 B net.
Catch a new FB???? HLLPF Just my opinion HelloPal Skyrocketing in the last 3 days
"I wouldn’t, want to be short this stock going into earnings. All the weak hands have been washed out.It’s been basing for quite awhile now , and it never misses.most the people in this stock now are in it for long haul.If this thing blows it out it’s going to be like shorting TSLA, I pity the fool that shorts this one"
$320 tomorrow
"This company just cannot stay out of news, negative news. Daily onslaught. I said it from day one. This company has a ball and chain around its neck. No getting out of it."
I sold FB a few months back and they have run up and back as usual. Zuck is a George Soros type.
Facebook is losing millions of freedom loving people to free speech sites. Their ad revenue will go down. They will not have as much personal information to sell. I hope Mark Suckerberg loses a lot of money over time. I hope Facebook gets Myspaced.
So you are telling me that apple is going to grow 1.5x faster than facebook? Interesting
"All zuck need to do is appologize, stop censoring or die and the stock will jump to 500."
OMG! Take advantage of these free trade ideas. Just go to (http://Pick-stocks.com)
"fb is cheap , it might be cheap forever"
"The E-commerce sales grabbed market shares from AMZN. Ads from election will set a new record. I guess FB will beat the estimates again. My prediction, FB will hit 300 again in April."
Down again? Something is wrong with FB.
300 dollars by XMAS.
WE WOKE... TWITTER GO BROKE!!!!!!!WHO'S NEXT $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL
Biggest news is the 25 billion buybacks. That's literally them telling you they know their own stock is cheap and they are buying it cheap before you do.
"Guys, its an amazing report but im so sorry. Nasdaq is down almos 3%, this market needs a big correction. There is fear in the atmosphere. Tomorrow will be a bad day but facebook is a very nuce business"
"I am glad our social media companies de-platformed an influencial person who makes baseless claims of fraud and incites violence against our elected representatives. He broke their terms of service, and that's enough reason for a suspension. I also see this issue as a matter of national security. I honor legitimate concerns of fraud, and Trump hasn't made any. Free enterprise has the right to refuse service to people who break their rules.I understand you're angry. You will probably call me names. I wish you all peace. I have chosen to invest in FB at this low price. They have a 32% profit margin. It's a very successful business."
Go ahead and sell you patriotic Americans! We foreign investors will take the discounted stocks.... 
"Sold Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon this morning."
Target 350$ from many big banks  with these results we have a goldmine
"With a new Administration in power, FB can now rally to new highs without all the “noise and incessant hoopla”!- The MAGA folks can now flock to their: “Russian hosted Parlor”???"
ANTIFA did infiltrate at the WH. Look at the video's. Its clear the GOP was there just to stand outside. ANTIFA wanted in and they did. Elon agrees its Facebook as one of the problems.

It is over for FB!
setting up for a big dip this afternoon...buyers dwindling...awareness of the end at hand....tears to come. The chart IS THE TRUTH AND YOUR WISHES FOR RECOVERY ARE AN ILLUSION. Boolean
consider all in
Less than 1% of FB employees are minority workers... that’s a nice fact for all of you
Cmon shorts. Work this board harder. It's moving up
The analysts always say FB is cheap. Cheap because it's always embroiled in controversy and therefore doesn't go anywhere but down or sideways.
"Google missed while Facebook beats estimates. Google ad clicks pricing goes down while Facebook ad services increased prices by 43%. Bank of America Upgrades Facebook $265, RBC raises target $250. Ad dollars are flowing into Facebook and its supported by the ROI. Facebook's growth rate is a value to Google. Facebook trend is still up."
Fb the winner in red day
fb will be the new gamestock
"I will post this every day until change occurs: I am calling on Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg to resign their positions immediately. Now is the time for new leadership and a fresh approach to management, in order to restore the company’s credibility. Shareholders have endured painful volatility in valuation over the past three years, and the company has experienced public scorn because of the behavior of this leadership team. A change is mandatory to restore the firm’s reputation."
Great buying opportunity. Go for it.
"Facebook shuts popular stock trading group amid GameStop frenzy(Reuters) - Facebook Inc took down a popular Wall Street discussion group, Robinhood Stock Traders, in a move that its founder on Thursday described as backlash for conversations buoying shares of GameStop Corp and other companies this week.GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and BlackBerry have been at the center of a market battle as individual investors coordinating on social media including Reddit, and using trading apps such as Robinhood, bought shares and squeezed hedge funds that had bet big on those struggling companies to tank.Allen Tran, a 23-year-old from Chicago who created Robinhood Stock Traders, said he woke up on Wednesday to a notification that Facebook had disabled the 157,000-member group. The notification, seen by Reuters, said without detail that the group violated policies on ""adult sexual exploitation.""""We were first on the picking tree to be cut off because we are on Facebook, not a free platform like Reddit,"" said Tran, referring to the typically lighter moderation on the discussion website.Some of his group's members made tens of thousands of dollars in recent trades first popularized on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, he said.Tran, who also runs the 20,000-member HaiKhuu Trading group on chat app Discord, said he has never seen adult content on the Facebook group.Facebook spokeswoman Kristen Morea said, ""This group was removed for violating our Community Standards, unrelated to the ongoing stock frenzy."" She did not respond to requests to elaborate.Tran said institutional investors are trying to separate retail traders.Facebook suspended his group on Jan. 7 after labeling it a ""dangerous organization,"" according to correspondence seen by Reuters, though the company reinstated its privileges after he appealed to contacts there.""With all these major institutions being frustrated with the success of retail, they are trying to target any groups they can,"" said Tran, who was featured in a Wall Street Journal article in November and described his Facebook group as the largest of its kind.Tran expressed concern that a replacement group he formed to carry on discussions also will be taken down."
"easy money has been long made from FB, time to move on"
yes....selling this dog is RIGHT AND JUST. Glad i have 0 shares now. holders are fooling themselves about its collapse....under 200 next two weeks
Millions leaving FB daily now----
It goes up by $3-4 for five days everytime and then Mark Zuckerberg comes into the picture. 
"AAPL turned green. Pretty sure, FACEBOOK will gap up on Monday pre market. We are loading a lot. EPS/revenues Q3, Q4 is our truth. Truth will prevail and lead. Buy buy accumulate. FB300 breakout will come"

This couldn’t happen to a better liberal company
"Who’s pressing FB down, just let it be, let it go up"
Smart money scaling in here for earnings
"Where can I find after hours charts ?? I like to see a graph of how the stock was moving after hours, anyone ?"
Facebook playing politics will be the downfall of their company. Lots of their investors believe they are doing the wrong thing. The future of FB is on thin ice.
The most undervalued of the FANG stocks with the most upside potential! Congrats to everyone who bought a few days back in the 250’s!! 300 here we come!

To all Facebook shareholders please get out now . This company under control by China government.
massive exit
"As it seems to be the norm, there's always someone taking a shot at FB. FB reminds me of that Timex commercial of old: ""It takes a licking but keeps on ticking!""I'm more enthused by the comments made by the charters and the disciples of the ""S Curve"" theory. Both strategists opined that FB is positioned for a breakout from its current levels.Nervous Nellies are always looking for a reason to sell, however investors who pay more attention to the numbers and market potential, vis-a-vis monetizing Messenger and WhatsApp, have their eyes focused on the truer picture. And let's not forget Instagram. It is still in its infancy in terms of monetization.So if you disregard the comments of the petty snipers, many of whom appear on TV to spin their theory and are rarely heard from again because they were wrong, you'll remain long and strong.$200 per share. Not an ""if"" but rather a ""when""."
When is 300$?
I think this will be a good deal if we just give it time. People are angry and The stock if falling. I will wait until we see it turning and Then #$%$ it up for cheap and wait for the userbase return
Fb holding strong today as all my other tech crash  I've gone crazy still buying tho lmaooooo
When FB has to report 1Q21 results we will only then know how many subscribers and how many advertisers they lost to their censorship practices. You cannot silence the American public.

"Look$ like FB also getting punished, just like TWTR, AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL and other big tech who think they can decide who speaks right or wrong, NOT OK these practises!! Long live FREE speech 4ever GLTA to all people with a FREE mind, take care."
Picked up 300 at 270. Way to cheap to ignore
Anybody has an idea technically how deep this could fall? $220-$230 short term possible? Looks like downwards pressure is building for $FB en $TWTR Tia
"Microsoft wades into Facebook news fight by siding with European publishersLondon (CNN Business)Microsoft is joining forces with publishers in Europe to call for an Australia-style system that would force tech platforms such as Google and Facebook to pay news organizations for content.The company said Monday that it would team up with media industry groups like the European Publishers Council to lobby for such a policy, which lawmakers around the world are now considering.The move comes after Facebook (FB) stopped people from finding news on its platform in Australia last week rather than pay publishers for their content, a decision that produced a global backlash and generated negative headlines for the social media company.""We welcome Microsoft's recognition of the value that our content brings to the core businesses of search engines and social networks,"" Christian Van Thillo, the European Publishers Council's chairman, said in a statement.Australia's government is pushing legislation that would allow certain media outlets to bargain with tech companies so they could be paid for distribution of the news they produce. Both parties would enter arbitration if they can't reach an agreement.The European Union and the United States face growing pressure to adopt similar measures. Canada's government has said it plans to introduce legislation in the coming months.Facebook has forcefully opposed the Australian legislation. Last week, it took the extraordinary step of banning users in the country from finding or sharing news on its service in protest of the policy. Google, meanwhile, went from threatening to pull its search engine to cutting deals with some of the country's largest media organizations, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.Microsoft (MSFT), which owns the search engine Bing, is taking a different approach. It voiced its support for the legislation and has committed to keeping its services in Australia if it takes effect, seeing a chance to steal market share from rival Google (GOOGL).""It was an opportunity to combine good business with a good cause,"" President Brad Smith said in a blog post earlier this month.The company has said it would back similar measures in other countries, including in the European Union, where policymakers are debating new laws that would rein in the power of Big Tech companies.Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner leading the charge on tech regulation, is holding a consultation on the legislation with members of European Parliament this week.New copyright laws in Europe require search engines and social media platforms to share revenue with publishers if their content is displayed. But European publishers and Microsoft want leaders to enact ""additional regulatory measures"" to ensure publishers have clout in negotiations.Some French publishers have signed up with Google, but without an arbitration mechanism, they fear the press ""might not have the economic strength to negotiate fair and balanced agreements with these gatekeeper tech companies, who might otherwise threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,"" according to Monday's press release.""Access to fresh, broad and deep press coverage is critical to the success of our democracies,"" Microsoft vice president Casper Klynge said in a statement."

"When the dust settles, everyone will remember the one story that got buried by gme and the like.The Fed! Jerome Powell! How much clearer can he make it that he has the market’s back. He even said if need be asset repurchase. QE again? Not off the table according to Powell. This is the David Tepper rally scenario again.The big money boys know this.Buy FB on sale. Remember they will be repurchasing shares all along too."
What happened to all the clowns that were talking about this is going to $220 last week? Driving for door dash or what

"Last I checked, I still haven't seen any official results of an investigation into voter fraud of the most recent election. Therefore, when a sitting president alleges fraud, it is not a ""lie"". Ironically, the real ""lie"" is that a sitting president's allegations are being called a ""lie"". Leave it to liberals to call anything they disagree with a ""lie"". And to be clear, the counting of ballots isn't where the fraud occurs. It's the fraudulently cast ballots that get counted that are the problem. It would take many months or years of investigation to determine whether there is a fraud extensive enough to have affected the election outcome, but it is, well beyond any reasonable doubt, a true possibility."
Hello everyone As per my research Fb will go 330 in next 5 to 6 months Please tell your friends and family to buy fb as it will go and take advantage of my research Thanks
"FB hasn't gone down any of these lawsuits by the government to break it up because long term they know the government won't win. Regulation isn't going to destroy this company's prospects. Any selloff should be bought. This company is inexpensive at these levels along with GOOGL and is sitting on a mountain of cash with enormous free cash flow and big earnings growth. Ultimately more acquisitions will occur down the line and this company will only get bigger. Governments hate successful companies, and especially ones that are game changers the way FB is. You can hate this company for moral reasons but from a business standpoint it is a cash machine and a winner."

"Klobuchar unveils sweeping antitrust bill, laying out her vision as new subcommittee chair • Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill on Thursday. • The bill sets a tough tone to start her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. • If enacted, the proposals could draw even more risk and scrutiny to large firms including Facebook and Google.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill on Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.Klobuchar has been a frequent critic of what she and other lawmakers have viewed as lax enforcement of existing antitrust laws and has called for strong measures against some of the major tech firms. While she’s introduced several bills in the past seeking reforms to various aspects of antitrust law, the “Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act” is a comprehensive proposal calling for a major revamp of enforcement standards. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company.With this bill, Klobuchar is drawing her line in the sand on antitrust reform, signaling that she will use her post to call for major changes to the status quo. Broadly, the bill seeks to reform antitrust law in three main ways: 1) resetting the standard for enforcement and shifting the burden of proof onto dominant firms in merger cases; 2) requiring agencies to study markets and merger effects regularly, with the help of additional funds; and 3) giving new tools to antitrust enforcers, like imposing civil penalties.In the House, antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms throughout an investigation into Facebook and Google. That investigation culminated last year in a nearly 450-page report on the companies’ alleged monopoly power and suggested reforms to restore competition to the digital market."

"Hackers can easily look up your phone number from Facebook using cheap botA database of phone numbers belonging to Facebook users is being sold on a cybercriminal forum, with customers looking up numbers using a Telegram bot.One person advertising the phone numbers says it contains data on nearly 500 million users, although the information is several years old.In 2019, a security researcher found 419 million records on an unsecured server, meaning no password was needed to access them.A total of 18 million were from users in the UK, while around 133 million were from American accounts.When the bot – which uses the messaging service Telegram, which recently saw an influx of users - is launched, it says: ""The bot helps to find out the cellular phone numbers of Facebook users”, according to Motherboard.Users can enter a phone number to receive a user’s Facebook identification, for profiles in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and 15 other countries. This also works in reverse – a Facebook ID can be used to harvest a users’ phone number.While the initial results from the bot are hidden, users can pay to reveal the full phone number. It costs $20 per phone number unlocked, with prices reaching $5,000 for 10,000 numbers.""It is very worrying to see a database of that size being sold in cybercrime communities, it harms our privacy severely and will certainly be used for smishing and other fraudulent activities by bad actors,"" said Alon Gal, co-founder and CTO of cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock, who alerted Motherboard to the breach.Gal obtained a sample of the bot’s data, which Motherboard then shared with Facebook.“It is important that Facebook notify its users of this breach so they are less likely to fall victim to different hacking and social engineering attempts,"" Gal told Motherboard."
I’ve been a long term holder of this stock. Recently I’ve been very concerned with the 5-10 year outlook of this company. It seems growth has hit a stagnation point and political battles will hit the stock hard. Can anyone ease my concerns￼?
Just remember what drives a stock. It’s numbers not news! FB will report outstanding numbers!

Thankfully, over the past couple of years, Facebook has started utilizing its fat cash position to tangibly return capital to its shareholders. While the stock remains undervalued, management should be able to scoop up shares on the cheap and increase the long-term value creation for its shareholders. This should also serve as an additional catalyst in terms of the stock's potential to deliver superior returns over time."

"3 years ago, I decided to buy huge amount of one of Faang stocks, I picked fb because I think fb has the best balance between growth and value. Now omg facebook wasted me 3 years with only 20% gain . what should I do with my shares"
FB ... close it downPut it out of budiness
This stockIs going to new highs in next coupleOf weeks if not sooner
FB and twitter are going down. there are other platforms available that value your privacy and free speech. Other countries are changing laws to ensure FB and Twitter will never be able to do this to their people. Sell now before it's too late!
"Smart money is buying — ignore the temporary decline, FB is headed higher!!"

Sell FB Chiba first policy
"I don't have a FB account, I just hold the stock. Everyone in my circle still uses it like this never happened."
"I was saying a few weeks ago when there was a lot of negativity in the news about how FB might have improperly shared users' data, some people were skeptical to buy and they should have while the stock price was in the $180s (it had even gotten as low as $176 in pre-market on one of the days). That was a great time to buy but its still early to get it on the rally. Stock price is going to be hitting $250 soon and in the next 2-3 years you may be holding a stock worth more than double of today's price. They released news that I was reading about how FB will generate an additional $6-8 billion in revenue just from targeted ads that are placed inside Facebook messenger. BUY BUY BUY and HOLD"
Pay for the news so that we can get good reporting. It's never been more critical for the truth to emerge.
"As I said EXACTLY a week ago, watch the last 15 minutes of this stock. Watch the rapid upswing then."
"Yessir, love FB"

Facebook is so sick.
People en masse are getting on SIGNAL and TELEGRAM and deleting WHATSAPP.....this is another huge loss for FAKEBOOK....and as I noted the rest will come to pass as I always am able to see what will unfold in these situations....FAKEBOOK is DONE....the stock is going to get its lights blown out next week with massive selling. If you are not out now....it is almost too late as the door OUT is not wide enough for all the sellers I see going OUT THE DOOR. Boolean

Zock invested over 1 billion in the democratic party let’s see what he gets in return￼
"The financial markets are speaking clearly, definitely, and decisively: the Facebook pps will continue to languish and underperform as long as Zuckerberg and Sandberg remain in place. This management duo is earmarked as the most pernicious factor affecting share price today, even though the firm earned $10.10 per share last year and announced a $25 billion stock repurchase. Wake up, Zuckerberg, it is time for you to listen to the markets. Time for Zuckerberg and Sandberg to go!!"

extraordinary comeback
Of all the FAANG stocks...FB is the best short. The dumbest company leader with a great downside potential. Puts are reasonabley priced...easy to cover slightly out of the.money near term puts and roll over at a quantity multiple after cashing out. Just keep buying puts like 40 days out...when you get close to experation just get out at your profit and buy more.puts than your last trade. FB will keep going down foe a while...

And, of course, our taxes will be going up, too. C'mon, man. Cut it out!"

"Fb continues making good money no matter people hate it. Do I like the CEO? No, I don’t like Zucker at all. He is acting like a dictator. Do I like fb stock and its app? Yes, I do!"
FB' s power trip is being judged around the globe my friends; not just in the US. This is a sinking ship.
Facebook censors better than Communist China who owns the Bidens? This company does not act like an American company? I can’t figure out￼ why they are so in align with Communist China? Maybe China has lent Mark Zuckerberg some money which they have invested a lot in our universities and they support Democratic candidates with the help of Communist spies like Sing Sing who escaped to China and the congressman she supported is still on the intelligence committee?
When everyone panic its time to buy or add shares.

Sell this stock if you have a soul
Stock will hit $300 during the earnings call.... Lots of positive news. Nothing to worry... FB is a money-making machine.
Gotta feel sorry for the people who bought in over 300. The good news is that you can recapture some of your losses via the tax loss when you sell. Every day you hold that tax loss is going to get bigger though.
I've been waiting for 6 months now for the break out.
Facebook censoring any rightwing opinions looks like the CCP censoring FB in China.
"Looks like it's gonna be an ugly day for stocks. FB already giving back Friday's gain in pre-market. Dunno. Looks like a lot of the smart money would like to see the NASDAQ fall below 10,000 so they can load up on quality stocks at a discount. If that's their goal, they'll probably achieve it. Manipulation has been the name of the game on WS for almost 20 years."

Free speech isn't protected by the 1st amendment when it incites violence and riots. FB didn't violate the constitution through their actions. All you bears saying this is the end of FB have no clue what you're talking about. People have nowhere else to go without using Facebook's products. It's moat is still intact. 50% of users leaving FB? Not even close. A small fraction of that may leave. FB will go on. You doomsdayers are delusional. And all these posts trying to score brownie points with yahoo users saying you are quitting FB. Total baloney. You all need to read up on the law before you go and quit your FB accounts. You pro Trumpers lost the election and you're going to lose out by quitting social media and selling your shares. I would love to own your shares so keep selling.
"FB, Twitter, Apple, Smart Phones etc are one conclusive study away from being labeled as more harmful than cigarettes and will come as a warning and a prohibition for certain age groups."

facebook is worth over 744billion off the people with there ads ...they dont care about u...they care about there pockets an they are deep....an now they somehow dictate who's on there free platform an tracks your every move....sell. facebook must go...or government will soon do it ..storm is coming
Do the right thing... This is not China or is it??
"In order to understand why $SNAP is trading where it's trading (valuation wise), we have to understand the story and the long-term picture. Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share."

WSJ today on FB and Twitter in India - Interesting read on their largest global market. Huge impact this will have on companies.

I canceled Facebook well over a year ago but now use Twitter to go after bad actors that are subversive that perpetuate non truths and foster terrorism in our country. Social media for its part is complicit and I'm glad to see that maybe future regulation will force constructive guardrails to be put in place.....There can be a future for social media....

"Yes, indeed. A nice start in pre-market trading. Given the $185 call expiration this Friday, I'm betting we finish the week just shy of that price. And so long as Christmas season shopping reports remain strong, I'd expect FB's pps to continue upwards as we approach year end. Will be more than pleased if we finish the year somewhere in the $190s.But remember, there are still almost 5 billion people out there who for any number of reasons (No internet service for most of them) that are still an untapped market for FB. The progress in that area may be slow to fruition, but sooner or later that many people are not going to be without access to FB and its other sites.In summary, the future looks very bright."

"‘We will not be intimidated’: PM takes Facebook fight to India and the worldGlobal leaders will be asked to back Australia in a fight with Facebook over its market power after the social media giant silenced news, health and emergency services in a bid to halt a federal law.Prime Minister Scott Morrison raised the shock tactic with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Thursday night in the first step of a plan to mobilise global support to stop Facebook “bullying” elected governments.“We will not be intimidated by this act of bullying by BigTech, seeking to pressure parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code.“I am in regular contact with the leaders of other nations on these issues. We simply won’t be intimidated, just as we weren’t when Amazon threatened to leave the country and when Australia drew other nations together to combat the publishing of terrorist content on social media platforms.”Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,” Mr Morrison said in his post.”These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Social media companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them.“Mr Morrison took plans to regulate social media to a G20 summit in Japan and a G7 meeting in France in 2019, when the Christchurch attack in March that year sparked calls to stop the spread of violent terror content.One option for the Prime Minister is to discuss Facebook and digital content regulation again this year when he attends the G7 summit hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Cornwall in June with leaders from Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.The proposed law, which mandates a bargaining code to force Google and Facebook to pay media companies for using their content, is being watched by these countries and the European Union as a precedent in regulating social media.Labor voted to support the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, clearing the way for it to pass the Senate and become law as early as next week.Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Facebook’s actions were “reprehensible” but the government had a responsibility to tell Australians what the next steps would be.Mr Morrison’s talks with Mr Modi, conducted by phone on Thursday afternoon, raised concerns about Facebook and its power when the company is seeking help from the Indian government in a huge market.“Decisions that are made here shape the global discussion,” Mr Zuckerberg told Indian business executives in December in a pitch to expand the company’s Whatsapp business app, which has 30 per cent of its global users in India.Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow rebuked Facebook for depriving users of public information including health and emergency updates.“Freedom of expression includes the right to speak and to receive information,” Mr Santow wrote."

"Facebook’s been there, and done that. Remember when major corporations were staging an ad boycott? That was suppose hit em hard with their revenues, and the share price drop was steeper than the current drop. Also, this is not the first time people are claiming to leave FB in masses. Just google up and you’ll see there had been some movement since years ago. And yet, Facebook is expanding globally and gains users every quarter. As many others pointed out, they have massive cash holdings. And... they have almost 0 long term debt. Buying anywhere near 20x P/E is absolutely value. Ride this out, and FB’s price will recover sooner rather than later."
Of course Facebook paints a gloomy outlook. Imagine what the regulators would try to do to them if they actually admitted they are crushing everyone and really don’t see any problems with overtaking the world in 5’years.
"Looking at FB’s balance sheet and cash flows, they have $11 billion in debt, total cash of $24 billion, and between $23-$24 billion free cash flow. If they wanted to they could pay down their debt and have plenty of cash left over. The only reason people shouldn’t like this stock is for moral reasons, of which I personally have nothing against the company. Most of the FAANGs are cash generating machines and now NFLX is going to be cash flow positive as well. The FAANGs may not have performed much as of late but long term they will still do well with their durable competitive advantages. FB is undervalued right now."

"Facebook shareholders, Facebook employees: we must make 2021 the year to maximize shareholder value. The fist step to maximizing shareholder value is to push for a 3:1 stock split. While a split is no guarantee of stock price appreciation, there’s plenty of historical data that shows stock splits leads to enhanced shareholder wealth. Let’s use the recent split by Apple, which initiated a 4:1 stock split on 8/28/20. Since that split, the stock has appreciated significantly, nearly 17%, or 40% if expressed on an annual basis. Zuckerberg refuses to split the stock because it doesn’t serve his best personal interests; shareholders deserve a leadership team to serve their best interests. Time to maximize shareholder wealth; time for Zuckerberg and Sandberg to GO!"

Moon time
"Facebook profit is deadlyThe antitrust action filed by 48 states and territories against Facebook gives us hope that tech firms will one day be held responsible for the harms they have caused our society. But we’re left wondering: Why are state prosecutors focused only on Facebook’s monopolistic behavior? What about the firm’s facilitation of serious crime and extremism?The Alliance to Counter Crime Online, which we run, tracks how tech platforms enable a wide range of illicit actors to reach vast audiences to market their goods, negotiate prices, raise money and accept payment. Facebook profits off this illegal activity from the ads for commercial products that appear in the feeds of users who come online in search of illegal ones. This symbiotic relationship benefits Facebook and criminals, but its impact on ordinary people can be deadly.Our researchers and others have tracked how Facebook’s family of platforms have overtaken the dark web as the premier online source for the illegal drugs driving these overdoses.To get a sense of the scale of the narcotics market thriving across Facebook platforms, consider this: Facebook’s latest Transparency Report claims the company found and took action on more than 5.9 million drug sales posts from Facebook and Instagram in the third quarter of 2020. The report also claims that AI flagged 94 percent of these drug sales posts before any users reported them (although this doesn’t account for how many times these posts were viewed). Facebook’s 94 percent “success rate,” however, means that at least 354,000 confirmed drug sales were reported by users after evading Facebook’s AI systems. By comparison, when the Justice Department shut down AlphaBay in 2017, the world’s largest dark web marketplace had about 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals. And when the Justice Department seized the Silk Road servers in 2013, that dark web marketplace featured a mere 13,000 drug postings.And these numbers assume Facebook is being honest. Our research, collaborated by recent whistleblower accounts, suggests the firm exaggerates the success of their content removal efforts, so the number of drug posts could be even larger.The problem is that Facebook’s recommendation algorithms are far more efficient at spreading drug content than its moderation tools are at sniffing it out. Predictive search on Instagram, the number one online drug marketplace, suggests alternate spellings to make sure anyone showing the faintest interest in drugs can find them—even if that interest is negative. Search for #opioidaddiction, #twelvesteps or another recovery-related topic on Instagram and you will be served multiple posts with drugs for sale (even as a spokesperson touts the platform as a place where people struggling with addiction can get help).Our researchers run daily test searches, and we consistently find that the average Instagram user — i.e. someone between the ages of 13 and 29 — is less than 10 seconds and a few clicks away from being able to buy narcotics or counterfeit pills.It’s enough to make you feel anxious. Mention that sensation while chatting on Facebook platforms and you will begin to see advertisements for online pharmacies selling prescription medicines at cut-rate prices, some of which are lethal counterfeit drugs. The pandemic gave the online pharmacy market a shot in the arm, with 31 percent of Americans buying prescriptions online for the first time.According to the FDA, 97 percent of online pharmacies are fake, and illegal online pharmacies have emerged as the main source of the counterfeit medications causing the current spike in overdoses. Facebook actually sells these illegal pharmacies ad space, yet another way the firm profits off illegal activity.On Jan. 6, members of Congress experienced firsthand how illegal activity taking place on Facebook can have deadly, real-life consequences. Facebook knows its algorithms spread division, and that many of its most popular groups are cesspits of illicit activity and extremism, but this active facilitation of crime and extremism has never been properly addressed by our judicial system.Just as state attorneys general have begun to unravel how powerful tech algorithms stifle competition, it is vital to also grasp how Facebook algorithms spread and amplify serious crime, and the myriad ways the firm profits from victimizing ordinary people.The world’s biggest social media company isn’t just harming society with its monopolistic behavior. Facebook platforms are a threat to the health and human safety of the American people. It is time to hold the firm and its senior executives accountable."

Boycott all companies that advertise on FB, notify those companies of your boycott by phone, email and/or USPS."

"No, it's not the shorts. Shorts can't put downward pressure on a stock. Investors can only lift a stock price by buying it. A short only benefits if an investor sells. What's happening appears to be some people are selling . It seems unwarranted, but probably all this market volatility is scaring some established investors. They'll be back. Not going to sell mine."

Shareholders should be enraged that Facebook paid $4.9 billion more than the maximum FTC penalty for the violation, assuming the reporting by the attorneys from Gibson Dunn is accurate. As a shareholder, I want to know more; I want to know if the massive overpayment was made to cover up malfeasance. If true, it’s even more critical that Zuckerberg and Sandberg and Wehner resign, so a fresh management team can take the helm and truly represent shareholder interests!!"

"The EU looks set to follow Australia's lead by demanding Google and Facebook pay for news articles • The EU looks set to follow Australia's lead and demand tech platforms pay to display news. • Australia's threat resulted in Google threatening to pull search from the country. • MEP Alex Saliba said the Australian approach addressed the ""acute bargaining power imbalances.""European legislators may follow Australia's lead in calling on major tech platforms like Facebook and Google to pay to display news articles.The Australian government has been locked in a war of words with Google over proposed new regulations in recent weeks, culminating in the tech giant threatening to shut down its search engine locally.Meanwhile, Facebook has also warned it could stop Australian users from sharing news articles if the legislation goes through in its current form, with local MD Will Easton saying there were ""no clear limits"" on the amount publishers could charge.But the EU looks set to make similar demands of the tech giants, according to the Financial Times, as legislators seek to build on the framework outlined in the recently proposed EU Digital Services and Digital Markets acts.Speaking to the paper, Maltese MEP Alex Saliba said the Australian government's approach had addressed the ""acute bargaining power imbalances"" between tech platforms and news publishers.""With their dominant market position in search, social media and advertising, large digital platforms create power imbalances and benefit significantly from news content,"" he said. ""I think it is only fair that they pay back a fair amount.""The EU has been at the forefront of tough new data and tech regulation in recent years, bringing in the wide-ranging GDPR data protection legislation - which has resulted in massive fines for the likes of British Airways and Marriott Hotels - and proposals to clamp down on digital giants."

Dump FB.. They share member info with other tech companies and China.. Zuckerburg can not be trusted playing roulette with a PUBLIC owned company.. FB worth $0.00.. A free company can’t be owned by a socialist who only cares about 50% of his customers! FAKEBOOK to be banned in several countries in 2021!
This is the best news ever for Facebook. Paying the news for content. PAY FOR THE CONTENT.For the people that get it.

Why any conservative would own fake book is beyond me. If you support freedom of speech why would you ever support a company that sensors free speech??

Never forget!!
"FB: second day of SHORTING FB to 245 Big gap yesterday was NOT for nothing, volume was HIGH - DECISIVE"
"it is completely fair...many people get banned for doing much less...a person's position of power should not put them above the law/rules/terms of using a service. if anything, their abuse should be considered more material.this isn't political...in fact, the complaints coming from the conservative aisle is hypocritical when republican views actually tend to favor a private business to run/moderate their business as they see fit and should be allowed to employ or serve whomever they see fit, regardless. wasn't there a recent controversy over a baker refusing to make a cake...the argument that these forums are considered journalistic is absurd...then all online forums and websites should be considered as such, and every user/person posting comments here is now a journalist... and then people believe these social ""media outlets"" shouldn't be political...wth, have you turned on any news channel/station? they are all politically biased! so FB is a media company, and instead of them determining what content they want to publish, they are going to be censored and controlled by government to determine what is published...so now we have state media under the guise of a public forum? the hypocrisy never ends..."

"U.K. Opens Investigation of Facebook’s Purchase of Giphy(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. started a formal investigation of Facebook Inc.’s $400 million purchase of Giphy Inc., saying it will look at whether the deal hurts competition in the supply of video clips and animated images.The Competition and Markets Authority set a deadline of March 25 for its initial decision, setting a timeline on a review that has already been marked by a court clash. Facebook had previously argued that the CMA imposed unreasonable and disproportionate restrictions on the company.The CMA is increasingly voicing concerns about internet giants swallowing up smaller firms. Its Chief Executive Officer, Andrea Coscelli, said in October that the largest tech companies should face scrutiny for any transaction, no matter how tiny.Facebook had to pause its integration with Giphy in June after the CMA said it wanted to investigate whether the deal would give the social network too much information on its rivals’ operations."

Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote a scathing letter to Mark Zuckerberg condemning Facebook's method of recommending political groups to users on its platform. A representative of Markey's office shared the letter with Insider.The Massachusetts senator said Facebook not only allows users to ""organize and coordinate violent and anti-democratic efforts on these pages,"" but that it recommends them to people.""Facebook's system of recommending political groups poses grave threats to American democracy and public safety,"" Markey wrote in the letter. ""Many Facebook groups (pages on your platform that function as forums for users to communicate about a particular topic) are breeding grounds for hate, echo-chambers of misinformation, and venues for coordination of violence, including explicit planning for the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.""Markey said Facebook ""failed to meet commitments it made"" to stop the practice, commitments that Markey said were also made in Zuckerberg's responses during a hearing before the US Senate in October.During the hearing, Zuckerberg said the company has taken ""the step of stopping recommendations in groups for all political content or social issue groups as a precaution for this."" In early January, Facebook reiterated that it still does not recommend political groups for people to join. But according to Markey, Facebook is not keeping to its word.The senator referenced an investigation by The Markup that found 12 of the top 100 groups recommending on Facebook were political, including groups that promoted violence.Markey is demanding that Facebook address this discrepancy and provide an explanation by February 9."
Going down because of censorship. Take your money out before it drops
There is a boycott of FB today. It will be happening every Friday from now on.
William - this isn't politics this is business fact....due to THE ZUCK his business is losing customers on all platforms and advertisers will leave en masse and are leaving already....so investors are forward looking not backward looking so that means the chart I see that is collapsing will smash this stock barring something I have not seen or heard yet...but 98% rating is DOWN and will continue DOWN.

"Very interesting player in the market who trades FB against TSLA intraday. I am not certain whether there are other securities in its basket but its Algo' trades these two against each other. I have traded this Reverse trade for three days and have done well. I spotted and traded a very similar reverse trade between BA and AAPL in September through November 2020. I do not know whose Algo it is but GS upgraded or reiterated FB a few weeks ago and FB has been sliding while TSLA has been rising. GS did the very same thing to BA and put it on its Buy List. BA went down significantly until it finally found a bottom and bounced. My guess is that it is either GS or one of its bigger clients. At any rate, enjoy the action while it lasts. Happy New Year."
Facebook’s malware business model is fundamentally flawed. The CEO keeps selling shares and smart money is moving elsewhere.

"The pps is sure jumping all over the place. Down big on Friday; down over $6.00 in pre-market yesterday; recovered from that and turned green, and then, Bam!, down almost $9.00 at the close. I don't need to see a heart doctor. If the old ticker can handle the wild price swings of FB without going kaput, I guess it's in good shape. Who knows what we'll see today? Handsomely green in pre-market right now, but black clouds abound. Thus far, FB has ticked off its own users by censoring, the pols, most of Europe, Australia, India and now, Russia. FB is quickly becoming the company everyone hates. I'd much rather them be more like Sara Lee. You know, ""Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee""."

FB losing subs by the millions. App Banned in China so no growth to pick up the slack. Boy is this a sinking ship!
"This is a no brainer. BUY BUY BUY. FB beats on top and bottom line. They had to mention the ""uncertainty"" so that the stock drops more so they can buy back shares cheaper.

"I can praise Facebook's financials all day long. The company has $55B in cash, ready to be deployed in all sorts of fruitful ventures and acquisitions in the future, and $0 of long-term debt. It also enjoys gross and net income margins of 80%+ and 35%+, respectively. You can love or hate Facebook. However, any investor who has ever looked at its financial statements should agree that its metrics are just too good to be true."
Oculus and other products will be big going forward.
"This is great FB is purging all those people who proliferate disinformation and conspiracy theories. Old Donny bone spur is gone, just one more stop for him and that's prison for tax evasion or worse sedition. He's destroyed his brand and now it'll be fun to watch as he pardons all his kids and himself. So all you anti-democracy right wing zealots and fascists , sell, sell, sell. I'll step in and reap your profits, can hardly wait to get the cash you should've been collecting. I'm buying, so you make sure you sell."
Excellent buying opportunity. Buy before the sale ends!
FB won’t be so easy from now on!
"It's risky... but all FB has to do is somehow incentivize people to ""opt in"" to ad tracking. Most Americans are so poor the would opt in to ad tracking if FB sent them $1 as a reward sign up bonus. Another way to easily get people to OPT IN.. is disable some often used facebook features until they ""opt in"". I know I personally would click YES in a second if it got a pop up window saying... ""Please opt into to ad tracking so we can cater to your interest more with our targeted ads and make your experience better"". If that window popped up a few time on FB.. everyone would click it after 1 day just to make it go away.Third option would be a subscription model of like $1 to download FB.

On June 1, 2020 Vice President elect tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota.""If your answer to this question is YES, then immediately contact your House Representative and insist that they draft articles of impeachment based upon Harris' own words. Please take action in behalf of our beloved republic. Let us fight fire with fire. We must use the same political weapon, namely, impeachment, that the Left is quick to use against conservative leaders. GAME ON!"

"Facebook, Instagram and YouTube become the platforms for drug dealers Accounts peddling steroids, opioids and other drugs remain easy to find on major social networks. A new report published today by the Digital Citizens Alliance, a consumer watchdog group, and Coalition for a Safer Web details how Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and YouTube videos are promoting drug sales, in some instances to thousands of followers or viewers. The Digital Citizens Alliance, researchers and other advocacy groups have warned the tech companies of such sales for several years, and they say the persistent appearance of such posts raises questions about social media companies fostering apparent criminal activity. “If we can find it, they can find it. That begs the question how hard they're looking,” Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin said in an interview. The researchers also uncovered that similar accounts were peddling what they claimed to be coronavirus vaccines or testing kits. Law enforcement has said it would be fraudulent for individuals to sell vaccines, which are being distributed in authorized medical centers – and the report's authors raised concerns that potentially fake vaccines or test kits could give people a false sense of security about their protection from the virus. Facebook, Twitter, Google and others have been particularly aggressive in promising to stamp out content taking advantage of the public health crisis, and the findings raise questions about the enforcement of these policies.“The platforms continue to treat this as a PR problem instead of an Internet safety issue,” Galvin said. “When we put out things, they take them down and say all is fixed. But it's whack-a-mole, and they're up again the next week.”"

"What is the Facebook strategic plan? Where does the management team want to take the company over the next five years? When’s the last time we heard someone from the company talk bullishly about the company prospects? It’s been years since anyone has talked strategically about the firm, in the meantime the stock price continues to languish because of a lack of direction,a lack of market confidence in the company, a lack of trust in the company. The firm has no bullish spokespeople; the shareholders cannot rely on Mark “The Whiner” Zuckerberg or Sheryl “Happy Talk” Sandberg or David “Chief Buzzkill” Wehner to provide strategic vision. Shareholders must demand a change or we will never achieve maximum market value of our investments. Zuckerberg and Sandberg must GO!"

"Facebook, Amazon, TikTok, other tech giants ordered by FTC to turn over info on privacy practicesThe privacy practices of nine major technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet’s YouTube (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are being scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission.The FTC voted 4-1 to issue orders on Monday to those three companies, along with ByteDance’s TikTok, online gaming communication company Discord, Reddit, Snap (SNAP), Twitter, (TWTR), and Facebook’s WhatsApp., to hand over wide-ranging data on how they collect, use, and present personal information.The FTC directed the companies to provide data on their advertising and user engagement practices, and how their practices affect children and teens.“Despite their central role in our daily lives, the decisions that prominent online platforms make regarding consumers and consumer data remain shrouded in secrecy,” stated a December 4 letter from a bipartisan group of FTC commissioners including Democrat Rohit Chopra, Democrat Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, and Republican Christine Wilson.That letter added: “Critical questions about business models, algorithms, and data collection and use have gone unanswered. Policymakers and the public are in the dark about what social media and video streaming services do to capture and sell users’ data and attention. It is alarming that we still know so little about companies that know so much about us.”Specifically, the agency said it wants information related to how social media and video streaming services collect, use, track, estimate, or derive personal and demographic information, and how the companies determine which ads and content consumers see. The FTC wants to know whether the companies apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information, and the impact of such efforts.The FTC asked the social media and video streaming services to illustrate, in detail, how they utilize demographic information collected on age, country, and whether a user is of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. The FTC asked them to share the inputs and methodology for assessing their services’ reach, as well as to identify the top 1,000 most populous attributes that make a user valuable to their platform."
"El Paso Sheriff's Officers Association says Facebook page taken down without warningEL PASO, Texas (KFOX14) — Leaders of the El Paso County Sheriff’s Officers Association say they were blindsided by Facebook’s decision to take down their page this week.The heads of the group feel their political statements on the page weren’t enough to warrant a suspension.“This was just, it’s a big shock,” El Paso County Sheriff’s Officers Association president Pete Faraone said.On Valentine’s Day, sheriff’s officers association president Pete Faraone tried to log on to the group’s Facebook account, looking to post a message to their more than 7300 followers.But when he pulled up the page, Faraone got an unwelcome surprise instead.“On February 14th, Facebook took down our page with no advance notice, they didn’t provide us with any reason or explanation,” Faraone said.Click on the group’s Facebook page now, and all you’ll get is an error message, saying the page may have been removed.Faraone said while they may have lost their site, they still don’t know why.“There was no opportunity to fix whatever they saw as harmful,” Faraone said. “And that’s where we are now.”Leaders of the sheriff's officer’s association said they didn’t understand Facebook’s decision to remove their page, as it was mostly used to celebrate officer’s achievements and highlight how the group has given back to El Pasoans.“Our last three posts were actually a retirement luncheon for some of our guys to thank them for their service, I presented an officer with the deputy of the year award, and the other one was a Make-A-Wish, where we did a drive-by parade for a sweet little boy that’s on the Make-A-Wish program,” Faraone said.Group leaders said the only content on the page that could be considered controversial were posts they made in response to local political leaders calling to defund police."

"FB's INSTAGRAM (Music) Opportunity---Instagram has been relatively insulated from the controversies plaguing its parent company, allowing to better focus on these initiatives without being distracted.Investors should now consider another opportunity that Instagram has: musicAn Instagram exclusive:Music Business Worldwide points out that Jaden Smith recently released an album as an exclusive for Instagram on its new IGTV service. While almost always time-limited, artists exclusives are often a differentiating factor that music-streaming services compete over, so releasing content as an exclusive on a photo/video-sharing service is quite the departure -- and a new model worth exploring.Keep in mind that Facebook recently inked deals with all three major record labels -- Warner Music, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, and Universal Music -- that give it the rights to include copyrighted music in user-generated content. All of those deals notably included Instagram. It seems unlikely that Facebook or Instagram would try to launch a pure music-streaming service anytime soon, but it undoubtedly has an opportunity to encroach on YouTube's dominance as a popular destination for music videos and other free music content.Incredibly, Instagram's user base is catching up with YouTube. The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) property was originally launched in 2005 and now has roughly 1.8 billion monthly active users (MAUs). Instagram was launched in 2010 and recently hit 1 billion MAUs."

Be patient longs. FB stock is consolidating for a breakout. Quarter after Quarter of revenue growth from mobile advertising cannot be stopped. Any political headwinds from privacy issues or hate speech will not stop this company from 25-30% growth for the next 10 years. Trust it. $300 before next earnings.

"Look at the one year chart: great since March, but lagging the market and poised to rise.Look at the EPS, fantastic... HUGE beats the last two quarters. Look at the market situation, FOMO at highest levels; NFLX just crushed and set up the market for more big tech gains. Look at the reasons why FB has been held down: politics & fear of regulation; valid regulatory concerns, but the sum of parts is worth more than the whole in a breakup scenario, and FB lawyers are head and shoulders above the govt who already approved FB acquisitions prior years. FB has the lowest valuation of all the FAANG. If FB just meet estimates, we are at $9.25 EPS @35x = $323. If they beat as usual, we are at $9.50-$10 EPS.35x multiple at $9.50 is $332.FB stock is still CHEAP!!! The recent selloff and current share price is a huge opportunity to get in before it jumps higher. FB will be over $300 after earnings and STILL sorely lagging behind it's peers.."

"‘Arrogant’ and ‘wrong’: Australia slams Facebook’s move to block news as unnecessary and heavy-handed • The social media giant on Wednesday said it will no longer allow publishers and users in Australia to share or view news on its platform. • Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Facebook’s actions were “as arrogant as they were disappointing.” • “Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary. They were heavy handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said at a media briefing on Thursday.The Australian government has slammed Facebook’s decision to block users in the country from all news content on its platform — a move that ended up affecting access to several government sites.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Facebook’s move “arrogant” and “disappointing,” while Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it was “wrong” and “unnecessary.”The social media company on Wednesday announced its decision to ban Australian users from viewing and sharing news content. It came ahead of an expected decision by the Australian parliament to pass a new media bill that will require online platforms like Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for displaying and linking to their content.“Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary. They were heavy-handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” Frydenberg said at a media briefing on Thursday.“Their decision to block Australians’ access to government sites — be they about support through the pandemic, mental health, emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology — were completely unrelated to the media code, which is yet to pass through the Senate,” he said.Frydenberg’s comments were later followed by strong criticism from Morrison.“Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,” Morrison said in a Facebook post.In addition to pages run by news outlets, several government-backed Australian accounts were also wiped clean by Facebook on Thursday morning. Government pages affected include those providing updates on the Covid pandemic and bushfire threats.Facebook’s decision was in contrast to that of Google. The latter on Wednesday said it has agreed on a revenue-sharing deal with Australian media conglomerate News Corp, which owns media outlets including The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.“We will not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code,” said the prime minister.Human rights advocates also criticized Facebook’s move. Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement posted on Twitter that the social media giant is restricting important information such as Covid-19 updates.“Facebook is severely restricting the flow of information to Australians,” she said.“This is an alarming and dangerous turn of events. Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable,” she added.Facebook’s “overreach” earlier Thursday that restricted Australians’ access to non-news pages was a “bad” public relations move, said Tama Leaver, a professor at Curtin University’s School of Media, Creative Arts and Social Inquiry.“I think Facebook has lost the PR battle by enforcing a ban that’s just simply too wide,” Leaver told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Thursday.“If Facebook was hoping this would remind Australians how important Facebook is, I think really they’re gonna remind that Facebook does things without considering the consequences on its users,” he added."
All time high is 304. FB will blow by that number. i predict 330 tomorrow. Shops is going to become more visible regarding revenues and that will drive it higher than most people think.

"Facebook to close Irish holding companies at centre of tax disputeIntellectual property to be repatriated to the US after IRS said it was owed $9bn in taxesFacebook is winding up Irish holding companies it has used to channel billions of profits to avoid paying taxes in the US, the UK and hundreds of other countries.The company’s main Irish subsidiary paid $101m (£75m) in tax while recording profits of more than $15bn in 2018, the last year for which records are available. Facebook companies around the world paid the Irish holding company for use of its intellectual property.Facebook International Holdings I Unlimited Company recorded revenue of $30bn in 2018, more than half of Facebook’s total global turnover of $56bn.The company’s decision to close the Irish divisions and return its intellectual property to the US came shortly after the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) took the company to court claiming it owed more than $9bn linked to its 2010 decision to shift its profits to Ireland. Before its stock market flotation in 2012, Facebook valued its intangible assets at $6.5bn in 2010, but the IRS claimed the true value was $21bn.The decision to wind up three of Facebook’s Irish holding companies was recorded by the Irish Companies Registration Office.Facebook paid just £28.6m in tax in the UK last year, even though it recorded £2.2bn in gross revenue from advertisers, according to accounts filed this month at Companies House. The tax payment was up only £100,000 on the previous year despite profits rising by more than a quarter.Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary group on responsible taxation, said the tiny tax payment “beggars belief”.“While other companies have struggled during the pandemic, big tech has thrived as people spend more and more time online,” she said. “Facebook and the rest of the tech giants must do their moral duty and pay their fair share.”Google moved its intellectual property holdings from Ireland back to the US in January, before the closing of the “double Irish” tax loophole, which has been used by US companies to channel international profits through Ireland and on to tax havens like Bermuda, keeping them outside the US. Ireland agreed to close the scheme under international pressure five years ago but companies were given until the end of 2020 to comply."

Transparency with the market pays off more so than being opaque."

I’m long the stock and haven’t seen the prompt Facebook is going to show apple users about opting in to advertisers. But I’ve spoken with three people who say they don’t buy Marks plea to opt in for for the good of small businesses. Maybe it’s well written and is more persuasive then I think though too. Any thoughts on this and does anybody have any idea of what the percentage revenues will be if most people opt out? I’ve been long since 86 bucks and am curious to anybody’s constructive thoughts. Political hacks need not weigh in please

"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration. Give it to them."
This is the same thing that happened when all the companies boycotted Facebook. The stock went down for a little while and then it went back up. I’ll buy more if it goes down below $240.

New highs inbound
252.72 USD if you expect strenght going forward is a nice level to add.If you expect a lot of weakness and you want to add: 215.35 USD.If you expect a major correction: between 190 USD - 200 USD.If you expect a bear market: sub 190 USD. - just my opinion -
"The all time high is barely 7% (about $14) up from here. All of this worrying and hand wringing is a little overdone. This is a stock that can do 7% in just a few days. I’m not saying that it will, I’m just noting that a new high is not as far away as it sometimes feels. Don’t be surprised if it does spike up to a new high at some point soon."

"WhatsApp to switch off messages for all who reject new termsWhatsApp users who do not accept its updated terms and conditions by the 15 May deadline will be unable to receive or send messages until they do so.Their account will be listed as ""inactive"". And inactive accounts can be deleted after 120 days.Calls and notifications will still function for ""a short while"" but, TechCrunch reported, probably only a ""few weeks"".There was a backlash among many users who thought it meant the company was planning to change the amount of data it shared with its parent company, Facebook.It later clarified this was not the case - the update is actually aimed at enabling payments to be made to businesses.Notifying usersWhatsApp already shares some information with Facebook, such as the user's IP address (a sequence of numbers attached to every device which connects to the internet, it can also be used to pin down its location) and purchases made via the platform.But this is not the case in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist.Following the initial announcement, platforms such as Telegram and Signal saw a huge surge in demand as WhatsApp users sought alternative encrypted-messaging services.WhatsApp delayed the initial rollout and has now changed the way it is notifying users of the changes."

"Three years ago this week the news of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal broke, a seminal event that launched an onslaught of scrutiny and oversight of both Facebook and the technology sector; that single event has crippled and hobbled the company, especially regarding share price, and prevented it from growing aggressively over the last several years. Zuckerberg and Sandberg, the management duopoly effectively running this entire company, have attempted to burnish the reputation of the company through an aggressive PR campaign for the past several years, but the campaign has not worked. Facebook has lost an enormous amount of market respect, and, most importantly, Zuckerberg and Sandberg are reviled in the market and lack favorable public sentiment. The only way to restore the reputation of this company and to reconfirm its place as a true growth company is to install a new management team; fresh leadership sends a message to the market that the players responsible for the data privacy scandal have been held accountable. More importantly, a new management team to lead this company into the future tells the market it’s not afraid to change and it’s serious about growth. I believe this change will push the share price to the $350 price point.Sent from my iPhone"

"Apple has announced changes that will adversely affect the way our ad systems work and may impact your ability to reach people with personalized ads. In early 2021, we expect Apple to require all apps in the App Store to implement its AppTrackingTransparency framework. This will affect the ability of apps to receive conversion data from iOS users.Apple's AppTrackingTransparency framework will limit the information that can be exchanged with third parties like Facebook, which may significantly impact ad creation, ad personalization, and performance reporting. This disruption will affect advertisers using pixel, Conversions API, or any other Facebook Business Tools that optimize, target, or report on events from a web domain.What do you need to plan for? Since I do advertisements on FB this can't be good for FB as they will lose customers like me if my conversion doesn't pan out as advertisement on FB ain't cheap either per impression. iPhone account for 80% of all users onlineOnce Apple enforces these changes, domains with existing web events will be configured by Facebook to send no more than 8 default events. All ad sets optimizing for events outside the 8 auto-configured pixel events will be paused.For domains where multiple businesses or personal ad accounts own pixels, domain verification must be completed. This can be done by the Business Manager."

The chart still says - FB IS GOING DOWN AGAIN and will blow through the lows set earlier.
ZUCK must be buying shares trying to save it...no else would be so foolish to come in with this level of effort BUT IT WON'T WORK...>FAKEBOOK IS DONE. We now own control and the people say SELL IT ALL. Boolean
"Yahoo censors and disallows posts all the time so why are you not boycotting Yahoo, but posting on Yahoo making Yahoo money?There is no Freedom of Speech here so why you here?"
"Drug Cartels Are All Over Instagram and FacebookInstagram is currently the leading platform for selling drugs directly to consumers, while Facebook comes a close second.Latin American criminal gangs are leveraging social media and messaging platforms to spread narco culture and sell drugs.Late last year, Colombia’s federal police arrested Diego Optra, a crime boss who heads a ruthless gang called La Local in the port city of Buenaventura. In addition to overseeing drug trafficking and extortion rings, La Local was reportedly behind over 90 percent of the city’s homicides. Optra had successfully evaded the police for months, but he left digital breadcrumbs in the form of his meticulously curated Instagram profile. There, his many fans were regaled regularly with photos of Optra donning diamond-encrusted bracelets, designer clothes, and an arsenal of firearms. According to police officials, his lively social media profile was key to his arrest and conviction.Optra is not the first crime boss to display his gangster lifestyle on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram. Nor is he the first to get caught after doing so. Drug traffickers and gangs are lively social media users across the Americas. Cartel bosses and their underlings use mainstream social media and popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp to shore up power and influence, threaten the competition, recruit new members, conduct sex trafficking, sell drugs and contraband. Mexico used to be ground zero for this kind of activity, where researchers created a new discipline out of studying these narco posts. Now, gangs in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and the United States are also involved.Law enforcement agencies have been warning for years that the so-called darknet—the unmonitored reaches of the internet—is one of the largest sources of direct sales of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services. Transnational law enforcement operations involving simultaneous takedowns of darknet vendors are routine. Yet hiding in plain sight is the sale of illicit goods on public social media. Instagram is currently the leading platform for selling drugs directly to consumers, while Facebook comes a close second. These platforms serve as a kind of halfway point between the street market and the darknet."
Facebook's new ticker symbol is TANK
"Genuine question (I hold no shares)....Does anyone like FB, the COMPANY (disregard the stock).Thumbs up if likeThumbs down if NO like"
You will soon see how far this stock will dive....

FB & TWTR the best communist stock in America supported by communist Americans.
"Has there ever been a stock like FB that stays in the limelight for all the wrong reasons. Seems like bad press follows FB with the same intensity as a wolf chasing raw meat. Don't recall how many times I've said, ""Well, this (Bad press, i.e.) will be over soon."". Thankfully, there aren't any social media sites with FB's reach that advertisers can turn to, so the revenues and profits should continue to pour into their coffers. Most analysts' price targets are $100 above our current pps. We're gonna get there eventually, right?"
Sell sell sell.
Institutions are going to eat this deal up very soon.
shorts will be covering as it rides to 260+
 Let’s SPIN the #Webull Wheel  4000 shares of FB stocks are waiting to be claimed.  https://act.webull.com/ina/7EhmCNMSWF6U/dtl/Wheel/wb_oversea
"FB reports earnings January 27. If they have lost a material amount of customers it must be disclosed. Media would not tell you, but look at their 10Q filing and look at material impacts. Guessing they lost millions of accounts. Advertisers will see it and take notice."
All the shorties: stop worrying about the fate of FB :D
Will be $285 by tomorrow morning.

OK OK I PROMICE I WILL BUY 2K AT $5.17
FB has clear path to higher ground — as we finish off a week in a solid green with great upward momentum!
I wonder how much consideration FB put into the lives lost protecting free speech? Yahoo Its a legit question please dont delete
How much did fakebook lost by now. I know yesterday it was like 47billion!
Remember not to use WhatsApp. Delete that platform and use Signal.
"I feel that FB absolutely needs to start issuing a dividend to shareholders. The company is still one of the most profitable around, but continues to get itself caught up in various situations/headwinds that the stock can't make any progress. To compensate shareholders for holding through all the nonsense, they need to at least issue a dividend because the stock seemingly no longer trades like a growth stock."
Sell this stock and keep freedom alive.
"These social media companies have entered dangerous territory, too much power in the hands of too few people, their ability to manipulate the narrative will bring their downfall."
this stock isn't going anywhere despite the earnings people are jumping off and Apple 10 makes if more difficult for FB to make money. pay the piper.
Haha fakebook.
Yes it is time to close the Massage Ladies down and send them home.
Zuckerberg and Sandberg are two of the most exceptional people in the tech social media sector — both centralized in one — FB great global business of our time!*** FB will be ordinary without their “exceptionalism” !- Only non-FB shareholders utter such nonsense about replacing these brilliant from FB’s Mgmt Team!
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Fairstox.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. FB exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today

The Cambridge Analytica debacle was the greatest gift for FB shareholders since the IPO meltdown and mobile ad conversion scare. Still not too late as FB is still trading cheaply compared to future growth. And the X factor is the stuff we still know nothing about!

All set for a strong dive
"Lots of positive announcements by FB today....I say we see green by close as well :-). In any case, $200 will be in the rear view mirror in the very near future."
They are now taking down anti-vaccine ads what a wonderful way to make the stock go up. Vaccines are A waste being that people who take them still have to wear a mask. Corona kills 1% of the population the same as flu.￼￼￼￼. More people die in automobile accidents and cigarettes. Don’t let Zohn find out about what I just told you he’ll have a heart attack.￼￼￼
Next quarter is going to be worse since their advertisements are leaving in drove due to censorship...
People invest to make money. They don’t care about your political views and your nonsense. FB will have great earnings.
TIME TO VISIT 300s!
"we will se 255 today nasdaq is falling. Is a overall market correction, healthy. And dont be sad, facebook has rallied 15% the last 2 weeks..."

There aren't as many people using than there were 1 year ago. Its too bad that MK had an idea that turned out badly because of his own greed and power grab. When you learn to get along man will be able to go forward. MK has decided on war and power which always goes badly.
"Even if you cancel your Facebook and Twitter account, the FBI is looking for you because you were spotted on cameras"
What I don’t understand is Facebook helps these news organization by having a platform where they can promote their content. Thanks to Facebook more people will go on a small news site website because it’s readily available meaning those small news organizations get more Ad dollars or maybe more subscribers. But if it wasn’t for Facebook how else would these small news organizations get their word out? They will just be buried in google and no one will know about them. If anything they should be paying Facebook for the free advertisement
Catch up trade. All of these other tech stocks are up 200% to 300% year to date
FB junk rating.
"look at zuckerberg. Lying, cheating, election fraud, violating the constitution. Your parents must be so proud."

"Okay, all indexes in the red at the opening, so was expecting a red number. However, not one as large as the current one #$%$53). Thus, there's more driving down FB's pps than just a bad day in the market."
Time to start boycotting all advertisers on FB. Write/email/text/call (or all of them) the advertisers and tell them you are never buying their products again as long as they advertise on FB.
Just watch out for the movement in the last 15 minutes.
"FAKEbook, the abettor of all thats rite, WILL Take Down Posts With Claims About Covid-19 Vaccines It Deems False.--- Robinhood U, -little zuckieeee"
FB is still making tons of cash and a relatively low PE compared to others. $335 will be reached this year and $400 by end of 2022. Patience in investing.
"What I don’t understand is why people waste their time bad mouthing this stock? Why waste the energy? Only leads us to believe that you have a short interest. But why bother shorting this? It has just chugged along for a decade and is a cash cow with huge profit margins. Ethics or not, FB rakes in the dough."
Buying more good news on the way
A $300 stock for under $250. Count me in. I know most people prefer a $25 stock trading at $150 though.
"FB, the communist collector."
$FB has $19B of cash on hand. IG is only started to gain monetization and traction. Where else are business going to advertise? FB market place is still in it's infancy but it's so much easier to sell on that platform vs Kijiji or Craigslist. Companies have yet to directly list on marketplace
Go Facebook!!! 200 is on the way!

"Facebook doesn't seem to mind that facial recognition glasses would endanger womenPicture this: you’re sitting in a bar and a creepy stranger keeps trying to talk to you. You ignore them. The next day you get a text from that stranger. Not only do they know your phone number, they know where you live; in fact, they know everything about you. They were wearing Facebook smart glasses, you see. The moment they looked in your direction the glasses identified you via facial recognition technology.This, it seems, is precisely the sort of Black Mirror-esque future Facebook wants. The tech company (and serial privacy invader) has teamed up with Ray-Ban to develop a range of smart glasses. While it’s not clear exactly what these devices will do yet, Buzzfeed has reported that Facebook is considering building facial recognition capabilities into them. During an internal meeting on Thursday, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice-president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that Facebook was currently assessing the legal issues surrounding this.Legal issues are one thing, but what about the very obvious ethical and privacy issues? Would you be able to mark your face as “unsearchable?”, one employee asked. And what about the potential for “real-world harm” and “stalkers”?Bosworth replied: “Face recognition … might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don’t know where to balance those things.”Excuse me? What kind of benefits could possibly balance the risk of making life extremely easy for stalkers and creeps? Well, Bosworth later said on Twitter, it could help people with prosopagnosia, a neurological condition where you can’t recognize people’s faces. More generally, Bosworth said, it would be super handy when you run into someone at a party and can’t remember their name. Ah yes, I can totally see how avoiding a little social awkwardness balances out the whole stalker thing!No need to worry too much about privacy, though. We all know you can trust Facebook to do the right thing and keep your data nice and safe. When a (female) Wired editor raised the concern that you could no longer pacify creeps at parties by giving them a fake name and number, for example, Bosworth breezily replied that there’d be a technological fix for that. The exchange makes it almost hilariously clear that Bosworth had given very little thought to the implications of this kind of tech on women’s everyday lives. Which is to be expected, considering Facebook started life as a website that let people rank hot girls via photos obtained without their consent.Facebook, of course, may not end up building facial recognition into its glasses. However, the fact it is even considering doing so is a disturbing reminder of how little ownership we currently have over our own faces. Several photos of your face, for example, are probably in Clearview AI’s database. The company, which counts the Facebook board member Peter Thiel as an investor, built a secretive facial recognition tool which it trained, in part, on pictures it scraped from social media. It sells its services to law enforcement agencies but also gives access to its app – which lets you hold your phone up to someone’s face and pull up their personal information – to select people. John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of Gristedes grocery, boasted about using the Clearview App to identify a man he saw on a date with his daughter, for example.As well as being intrusive, facial recognition technology is plagued with problems. It doesn’t work as well on people with darker skin, for one thing. At least three black men have been falsely arrested based on a bad facial recognition match. But as long as the collateral damage involved with this tech is just black people and women, who cares, eh? None of the big technology companies seem to. Timnit Gebru is one of the leading voices in AI ethics and has done groundbreaking work around bias in facial recognition technology. Gebru was fired from her role as technical co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team in December; she alleges they were trying to suppress her research on bias. Last week Google also fired Margaret Mitchell, another top AI ethics researcher. Big tech loves to wax lyrical about their commitment to privacy and ethics but their actions tell a very different story."
FB is responsible for antifa.

"It's time to get tough with 'bully' Facebook after Australia move, senior UK lawmaker saysLONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Facebook's move to block all media content in Australia is a staggeringly irresponsible attempt to bully a democracy and will stiffen the resolve of legislators across the world to get tough with the tech giants,a senior British lawmaker said.""This action - this bully boy action - that they’ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,"" Julian Knight,chair of the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media andSport Committee, told Reuters.""We represent people and I'm sorry but you can't run bulldozer over that - and if Facebook thinks it'll do that itwill face the same long-term ire as the likes of big oil and tobacco,"" Knight said.The social media giant shocked Australia on Thursday when it blocked all media content from its platform in a stunning escalation of a dispute with the government over paying forcontent.The move came after the government of Scott Morrison drafted a law to require Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or be subjected to forced arbitration to agreea price.""If you gain value from carrying trusted sources ofinformation - in the same way as if you gain value for example from music streams - then those that carry those and then sell advertising off the back of that value, should pay for it,""Knight said.""I think they're almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wishto impose restrictions on the way in which they do business, or corrections to the way in which they operate within markets. So,we're all behind Australia in my view.""Asked if Facebook and other tech giants had got too big fortheir boots, Knight said: ""That's the understatement of the century isn't it?""""The way in which you tackle the tech giants in a positiveway is to look at competition,"" he said."

Good time to exit. Not sold on the fact that FB isn't going to lose some advertisers with the move to suppress free speech. I could be wrong but I doubt most Americans feel FB was in the right to remove the first amendment rights of Americans.

To date, they've enjoyed the support of the MSM, but as each day passes, more and more people are discounting what they hear on TV or read in the newspapers because they know there's a lot of bias in what they say or downright lying."

They probably bought their 150 after a commercial Ford shoved down their throat that was designed based in personal information that they got from FB.

This is a company that gets hated on from extremists on the left and right. They both want FB to sensor the other and let themselves. It's pretty hilarious actually.
Bye bye Facebook

"Russia rebukes Facebook for blocking some media postsMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused Facebook on Monday of violating citizens' rights by blocking some media outlets' content in the latest standoff between a government and Big Tech.Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor at the weekend threatened Facebook with a minimum 1 million rouble ($13,433) fine and demanded it restore access to content posted by TASS news agency, RBC business daily and Vzglyad newspaper.It said Facebook blocked posts pertaining to Russia's detention of alleged supporters of a Ukrainian far-right group.""I think this is unacceptable. It violates our national legislation,"" said Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament and a member of President Vladimir Putin's United Russia ruling party.In a statement, Volodin said Facebook had violated basic rights to disseminate and receive information, and legislation would be proposed to preserve Russia's ""digital sovereignty.""Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Like other nations, including Australia in a high-profile dispute with Facebook and India in a spat with Twitter, Russia has in recent months taken steps to regulate and curb the power of big social media companies.Bills passed in December allow Russia to impose large fines on platforms that do not delete banned content and to restrict access to U.S. social media companies if they are deemed to discriminate against Russian media.""They operate in our environment but at the same time they often don't obey any Russian laws,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told RIA news agency on Monday."

So glad I sold FB 2 months ago while it was showing weakness. Too much controversy about its product. Share price is falling off a cliff.
Same story. Time to buy more for the long term.

"The volatile, erratic, irrational movement of this stock will NEVER subside until some of the key management team players are removed. The market greatly distrusts this company, and the only way to restore credibility with the market is to replace key components of the management team; change is always good, and will assuredly be applauded by the market. I find it unfathomable the BoD approved the 2018 agreement to collude with Google- change is imperative. ."
Dont let the shorts scare you FB will be right back up at close and we will be at 300.00 by friday
HAHAHAwhere are the sellers

"India plans new social media controls after Twitter face-offNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chafing from a dispute with Twitter, India plans to oblige social media companies to erase contentious content fast and assist investigations, according to a draft regulation.New Delhi's planned ""Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code"" - a copy of which was seen by Reuters - come as various nations around the world try to assert tighter control over powerful big media firms.Facebook faced a global backlash from publishers and politicians last week after blocking news feeds in Australia in a dispute with the government over revenue-sharing.In India, Twitter ignored orders to remove content over farmers' protests, fuelling the zeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government since 2018 to tighten regulation for content it deems disinformation or unlawful.The latest draft rules - which would be legally enforcable -say companies should remove content as early as possible, but not later than 36 hours, after a government or legal order.They must also assist in investigations or other cyber security-related incidents within 72 hours of a request. Further, if a post depicts an individual in any sexual act or conduct, then companies must disable or remove such content within a day of receiving a complaint, the rules added."

"Bob, how about $85/sh? nope, lower... oh geez... we're runing out of time, join us again..."
"Richard notes that FB dropped after earnings 9 times out of the last 11 reports. it also ran up all of those times *before* earnings. It's running up again now. Does that mean the pattern is repeating itself? Maybe. But maybe not. Eventually, once ""everyone knows"" about a pattern in the stock market, that's about when it stops working.Maybe it'll sell off again this time, but I suspect ""this time will be different."" FB rallied the last few days, but overall it has lagged the other FANG stocks for the last few months. It hasn't made significant new highs. In fact, FB actually first hit 188.00 in AH trading on 11/1/2017, before Zuck killed the rally. There is some negative sentiment and I think earnings expectations are WAY too low. I think this quarter, 4Q2017 will go down in history as one of the biggest blowouts of all time. I think $200-210 is a conservative view on the post earnings move. I wouldn't be surprised to see $220-230 within a few weeks after results come out. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, eventually, the market will stop listening to Zuck's naysaying, and if this ER's results are good enough, there's nothing he can say to kill the monster rally we're about to see."
FB parabolic surge in the making 28++ BILION revenues!!!
FAKEBOOK ACCT. NONE. SO GLAD AND FEELS GREAT!!!! Boolean
about time fb starts to move higher
moved 500k usd to tsla in nov and it doubled.
In 3 years Facebook revenue doubled from 40 Billion -> 80 billion and stock doubled from 125-> 250+In 3 years Apple revenue grown around 25% (229B->280B) but stock grown almost 5 times (29->145)Hard to use logic here.
Facebook & Twitter showed us all how to hate each other. Neither company can be salvaged.

FB has gone on sale!
Should of sold yesterday at the high
I told you guys two weeks ago that facebook was a steal at under the 200 moving average price. At the end the market always corrects itself and you simply can't keep down a stock like this for too long. FB makes too much money to justify price drops for too long
All my friends and family use Facebook daily. Their kids all have Instagram accounts. They love it! Can’t get enough of it. The market share in this space makes this a a great long term investment. More regulation only helps them. It makes entry by competitors more difficult. Headline risks has had no practical affect on the end users habits.
"The real ""bully"" in this situation was Australia; FB showed that they won't back down or lay down for a bully like the Australian government. Australian journalist/publishers are realizing that putting their content on FB without FB paying them a nickel for it is way more lucrative than not being on FB at all. Its like starting a fight on the playground because one person is better at a particular game than the others and then that person that is better at that game kicks your +++ for starting the fight in the first place."

"From a political view, I can't stand FB. From an investor's view, I love it. 5 to 1 cash vs debt. Can't beat that with a stick. I'm conflicted."
"Once again Zuck has put FB in the crosshairs of controversy by banning Parler. Whether you use Parler or not, this type of hubris on the part of Zuck is weighing down on FB. And eliminating a competitor, albeit one small by comparison to FB, GOOG and TWTR, won't help them in their battle with pols over charges that they are too big and/or are a monopoly. Lately, Zuck doing more harm than good for shareholders. Without his childish antics and comments, FB would easily be a $350-$400 stock."

Who is going to get zucked this week? Still no plan for a dividend and there is little to no growth in this company......It is great for paying fines though. Maybe that is why they don't pay a dividend.....

Congratulations ZUCK for holding it above the water line today BUT...look at the chart - there is no support there and you likely had the company buying in shares to support - next week you won't be so lucky as news will begin to flow negative for all the reasons you already know. Boolean
It is all over now with the GME AMC BB nonsense. Now money can flow to quality.FB beat strong and has committed to buying back their own shares.
"You can not like FB for moral reasons but from an investment point of view there is nothing to dislike. Extremely high margins, little debt leverage, 24 billion in cash, 23 billion free cash flow. All in all, a cash machine with a durable competitive advantage. And it is inexpensive at these levels, very underpriced. So when it comes to your morals it might be a questionable investment but from a money making standpoint it’s a no brainer. I invested at $66 in 2013 and haven’t sold a single share."
"Facebook went downhill when the mainstream media was included into the content...It went off a cliff when they started ""fact checking."""
"Laughable that FB sets up their own ""fact checker"" Snopes so they can push their own agenda."

Kris Faafoi, New Zealand's broadcasting and media minister, called on the tech giants to begin negotiations with broadcasters to pay for hosting their stories.Faafoi said he met both companies last week to 'encourage' them to enter talks with media companies - or else face harsher regulation. ‘I'm confident that commercial discussions taking place between traditional media and digital platforms will also begin here in New Zealand and I encourage that,' he told a parliamentary meeting on Friday. “They will be heavily influenced by the nature of the actions and discussions between the platforms and media companies,' he said.He said New Zealand media companies were facing a financial crisis at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic meant their work was increasingly important.'The media's role through the pandemic was key to New Zealand's successful response,' he said.'As minister, I'm committed to supporting the sector... and to deliver the change required to make it stronger and sustainable in the future.'New Zealand is not the only country looking at ways to make tech companies which dominate their markets and soak up the lion's share of advertising revenue share their wealth with media firms which have seen profits dwindle in recent years.The UK is thought to be looking at similar legislation with proposals due before parliament next year, while the EU is being encouraged to include similar laws in its Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, which are currently being drafted.Lobbyists in the US are also thought to be considering similar proposals."

Is Facebook currently repurchasing shares right now.
"Citi analyst: “Citi analysts said Facebook is likely to continue to be a primary beneficiary of the ongoing shift to digital ads, with shopping tools poised to benefit from the surge in e-commerce. Facebook ad revenue should accelerate further than its third-quarter 22% year-over-year growth led by ongoing recovery and a heavy e-commerce holiday season, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week. Those analysts project fourth-quarter ad revenue growth of 26% year over year. Oppenheimer analysts said they anticipate fourth-quarter advertising revenue will “handily” top Wall Street estimates at 30% year over year versus estimates of 25%. They added that according to Gupta Media, fourth-quarter global CPMs at Facebook and Instagram were up 35% year over year, up from -12% year over year in the third quarter. Facebook’s e-commerce is also gaining traction.“The company did a great job in 2020 of preparing Facebook Shops and many other e-commerce ad products (IG product tags, etc.) for the 4Q holiday season, and adoption was very robust based on our checks,” Barclays analysts said. ‘’"

"Facebook and Google could lose bargaining power under upcoming U.S. bill to help news outletsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bipartisan members of Congress plan to introduce a bill in coming weeks to make it easier for smaller news organizations to negotiate with Big Tech platforms, said Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.The U.S. bill would be introduced at a time when Australia is in a pitched battle with Facebook. The social media giant blocked news feeds and other pages - including those of charities, and health and emergency services - as part of a dispute over a proposed law that would require it and Google to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree on a price through arbitration.Buck, who was named the ranking member this month, told Reuters on Thursday the panel would bring out a series of antitrust bills and the first one in the coming weeks would allow smaller news organizations to negotiate collectively with Facebook and Alphabet's Google.Social media companies use news to attract customers and have been accused by news publishers of not sharing enough advertising revenue with them. The legislation could boost sales in the struggling news business.While Facebook has fought publishers, Google has struck deals with them in France, Australia and other countries.Google announced this week that it had agreed to a global deal with News Corp that involved ""significant payments"" to the news organization, in one of the most extensive deals of its kind.Smaller publishers using Google's ad sales technology have for years griped about their bigger competitors getting more favorable revenue-sharing deals from the search giant.The news industry is undeniably struggling, with employment at U.S. newspapers down by half since 2008 amid tumbling advertising revenue and changing media habits, according to data from Pew Research.""What publishers have experienced is that platforms go to them one by one, make them sign NDAs and try to optimize per publisher without publishers being able to compare notes,"" said David Chavern, president and chief executive officer of the News Media Alliance, an industry trade group that is promoting the bill.“Big national publishers probably have the capacity to get their own deals. If you look at smaller publishers, the only way to get some fair value is if they act together.""In October, the antitrust subcommittee's majority report detailed abuses by tech giants such as Google and Facebook. In his own report, Buck and three fellow Republicans expressed interest in some changes in antitrust law aimed at strengthening enforcers.Buck said he wanted the focus to remain on the tech giants. ""The biggest threat to the free market economy is big tech and it (potential legislation) should be fairly tightly focused on that,"" he said."

"U.S. lawmakers to introduce antitrust bills to protect news mediaWASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers led by Senator Amy Klobuchar and Representative David Cicilline will introduce legislation on Wednesday aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.The bill comes not long after Facebook had a pitched battle with Australia over how much publishers should make from their social media pages. During the fight, Facebook blacked out Australian news pages and only restored them once the government granted concessions. It also promised a $1 billion investment in the news industry.Senator John Kennedy and Representative Ken Buck, both Republicans, said they will also sponsor the bills. Klobucar and Cicilline are both Democrats."

"Their is an article written by Allum Bokhari. He points out that Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, Newsmax, Yahoo, Apple, and others mine our data to skew the way we think, VOTE, purchases goods, and work. If anyone believes this is free speech you are mistaken because these internet providers have the power to take down any post that their speech police deem to be biased concerning articles by people and or politicians that are on the ultra left, liberal, or populist. They do not allow much by the conservatist view points to be persued. Therefore it is my belief that the government of the world need to break their monopolies up."

"I am following the drama with Facebook, now with Australia. I made the comment a couple years ago, after hearing Zuckerberg speaking at a private engagement, and then hearing his ""backstage"" discussions about the internet, who will guide it in the future, etc. It scared the $h|+ out of me. I have been anti-Facebook since. Fast forward 2 years to today. Facebook is now influencing elections, shaping the news, what we are allowed to know and not know (i.e., ""fact-checking""), and so forth. Is it any wonder why apps like Parler were SHUT DOWN by Android and Apple (and blocked by Amazon)? It was out of FEAR. People are fighting back. It's a (somewhat) quiet movement right now, but it's like water on a hot stove...at some point it's going to boil over. Not sure where it goes with Facebook, but if I were a betting person I'd say it does not play out well for the company in 5 to 10 years."

"I have a question for Facebook management, and perhaps shareholders... The Facebook Live feature is a great option for users to share with their peeps and friends but why doesn't Facebook work out a program for musicians and other entertainers to receive proper tips during a live stream. I see a lot of entertainers using Facebook live to advertise their Patreon channels; the free publicity is great for them but why doesn't Facebook find a way to keep the entertainers live on Facebook rather than moving their audience to another platform? I know, it's all about the money. If Facebook provided a proper way for customers to tip entertainers then the entertainment with stay on Facebook. Sadly, Facebook invented a STAR system for tipping and that system takes 40% up front away from Facebook customers so less than 60% reaches the entertainer. This is a very bad and backwards system. Entertainers should get 100% of their tips up to a certain agreed upon minimum then split the rest with the house (in this case Facebook) in some logical fashion that entertainers are willing to accept... Perhaps a quick review of whatever percentage Patreon takes would give Facebook an idea of what's appropriate. Regardless, taking money up front away for those who want to tip seems like the worst possible approach. That is why the STAR system is failing and it's why entertainers are just using Facebook as a free mechanism for promoting the Patreon accounts."

Let me share a great piece of advice I learned from Warren Buffet. He has shared many a sage wisdom in his interviews over the years but this little snippet has done me more good and made me more money than anything else. And it is simply “tune out the noise”. When you buy a stalwart like FB and have conviction in the company and MZ then buy it and tune out the noise. Because this stock is going to continue to go up and you don’t want to be left behind kicking yourself over why did you sell. Better advice you won’t receive. Do with it as you please. No charge :))

"A Sneak Peek at the Apple Feature That Keeps Facebook Up at NightOf all the privacy-preserving goodies Apple promised to roll into the iOS 14 update, its so called “Tracking Transparency” alerts were probably the most controversial, stirring up enough pushback from fellow tech giant Facebook that the feature ended up being delayed past its original autumn deadline.Now it’s looking like Apple’s waited long enough. A user with beta access to the upcoming iOS 14.4 update shared a screenshot on a MacRumors’ forum showing the NBA official app asking to track their activity across non-NBA apps and websites. In the customizable fine print that accompanies these tracking prompts, the NBA’s app notes that it’ll use this data to offer “a better and personalized ad experience”—whatever that means.Per MacRumors, it also looks like some folks using older versions of iOS 14 have also started getting these alerts on particular apps, albeit “rather inconsistently.”To briefly recap, the idea of Apple’s so-called “AppTrackingTransparency framework”—or just ATT for short—is to give users control over the amount of data that the apps on their phones are allowed to hoover up. Arguably, the juiciest piece of data that users are getting control over with the update would be their phone’s advertising identifier, or IDFA. We’ve covered the IDFA in depth before, but in a nutshell, it’s a string of characters that identifies your specific phone across all of the apps that you use. Being able to access this particular ID doesn’t only allow advertisers to track you from app to app, but in tons of other ways as well.Naturally, most advertisers were a bit peeved at the idea that Apple would be siphoning off their data supply. And the face of this peeved party, ironically enough, was Facebook. We’ve mentioned before that outside of Instagram, WhatsApp, and its flagship blue app, Facebook also has an external “advertising network” that siphons off tidbits of consumer’s phone data through non-Facebook apps in order to let those app’s users get retargeted across Facebook’s myriad platforms. Losing access to the IDFA, in particular, means that this Ad Network is losing a ton of valuable consumer data, which means Facebook, in turn, is losing ad dollars that were historically used to target that data.That said, I think we can all agree that as far as companies go, Facebook isn’t really the most sympathetic player. This is probably why its tactic over the past few months has been hamfistedly telling us that the ATT update has the potential to cripple the small businesses that rely on its ad platform for their day-to-day work. Since August, we’ve seen this message rolled out on press calls, corporate blog posts, and—as of last week—two full-page newspaper ads.Facebook, for its part, is kind of fuzzy on how small businesses will be impacted (besides some vague definition of badly). Now that there’s actual details coming out about what ATT entails, it’s looking like even Facebook’s own advertisers aren’t too worried about the actual impact that’s coming down the pike."

How much money is Blackberry going to get from Facebook?
FB today reminds me of TGT a few years ago with the consecutive data breach and bathroom scandals. Countless keyword warriors swore to never shop there again and it would go bankrupt as a result.Look at TGT now.FB still makes money hand over fist because it's an extremely efficient way to advertise online. There's no better. FB becomes even more important in an ad buy as old school TV audiences continues to fragment due to streaming alternatives.Short term noise does equate to long term success.
"Bulls are running ""Hogs wild"" all over FB, and they'll be doing it ""all day long"" -- into next month!- BUY with both hands!"
Sheryl Sandberg delivered a brilliant explanation of Facebook’s data usage: Advertising and protecting people's information are not at odds. They do both. Targeted ads that respect people's privacy are better ads. They show people things that they're more likely to be interested in. People want to see ads that are relevant to them. Over 80 million small businesses advertise and connect with customers through Facebook.
"to all the ""buy back"" disciples around here... that's all FB can do with their existing pile of benjamins... their acquisition days are gone... the problem with buy-backs is they do nothing for your long term competitiveness, innovation or growth... they simply reduce the denominator ...The street will not pay one iota for buy backs in FB's arena... when you got Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon starring you in the face... fewer shares is not much of a weapon. Twitter and Snap are just laying around like vultures... they, themselves, are not much a threat... they are not the problem... they will, however, provide fodder to expose FB's disregard for privacy and integrity... One more time...FB is not sliding towards extinction... but it ain't worth $270/share...sorry longs."

"Zuckerberg bribed the Australian government officials without success Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has lobbied senior federal ministers about the proposed code forcing the digital giants to pay media companies, and the prime minister has engaged with Microsoft amid threats from Google about removing its search engine from Australia.With a lobbying offensive in overdrive with Labor expected to endorse the Morrison government’s code after a shadow cabinet meeting this week, and with a Senate inquiry continuing to hear from stakeholders – the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, confirmed the conversation with Zuckerberg on Sunday.Facebook has branded the proposed code unworkable in its current form, and has asked for digital platforms to be given six months’ grace to negotiate deals with news companies directly before being hit with mandatory regulations.Frydenberg told the ABC his discussion with Zuckerberg had been constructive, but the tech mogul had not convinced the Australian government to back down.With parliament set to resume for 2021, the platforms have engaged politically connected lobbyists and are pulling out all stops to try to scale back or scuttle the proposal.Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia and Facebook has warned it will remove news from its feed for all Australian users if the code proceeds.As well as confirming the high-level approach from Facebook, Frydenberg also revealed on Sunday that Scott Morrison had spoken to Microsoft, which operates a rival search engine to Google.He said Microsoft was “watching this very closely” and was “mulling expansion opportunities in Australia”.The government remained “in detailed discussions with Google, with Facebook, with the other players across the industry” – discussions that had been under way for some time.Australia’s major media players, hit by technological disruption and by the economic shock associated with Covid-19, have also lobbied extensively for fairer commercial arrangements with the platforms.The proposed code – a world first – aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants.Google and Facebook would have to pay for displaying news content and provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic – such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. If they failed to comply, they could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.The proposal was developed by Australia’s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Although Labor supports the code in principle, its communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said last week that the government needed to be clear with internet users and businesses what Google’s threatened departure from Australia – if that eventuated – would mean in practical terms.Frydenberg said on Sunday he didn’t “dismiss the threats” but “I’m not intimidated by them either”.The code was “the product of an 18-month inquiry, world-leading inquiry, by the ACCC, and at every step of the way, these businesses have been consulted”.As the process went on, the story from the platforms appeared to be changing: “The goalposts seem to be shifting because originally they had a concern with the algorithm requirements of notification, then it was about value exchange and then it was about a final arbitration model.“Now we’re told that if we go ahead with this, we’re going to break the internet.”Frydenberg said the government’s view was it was clear current practices had to change: “What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.”"

Nice to see FB fined 650 million....more to come.
glad I sold this turd a while back in the 270's. Will be leaving FB and moving to GAB. Censorship is un-American.

"FB is coiled and ready to ROCK, $300 by end of month, I predict. Average analyst price target, about $350. Fidelity has it as 3rd most undervalued large cap, after GOLD & WPM. Rev growth = 30%EPS growth = 50%+I personally don’t care for the company, not because of politics, but more the devious nature of data collection, etc. But, that doesn’t mean I won’t make $$ by “renting” shares, in the words of Pete Najarian"

"Not looking good in pre-market (-$3.01). Probably gonna see the pps challenge the $250 barrier at some point this week (Thanks, Zuck!). Anyway, with all the bad press hovering over the company, any thoughts of FB hitting those $350-and-above targets is foolhardy under current conditions. Gotta face the facts, FB (Zuck et al) has ticked off too many people across way too many spectrums of involvement. Stock most likely trades sideways until 1Q 2021 numbers are announced. FB just not receiving a lot of love."

"Might see some profit taking now that FB is kissing $200. Gotta remember that there are a lot of longs who bought in last December at a really cheap price.

"Growth tech names like $ZM $TSLA $SNAP $PINS $SFIX $TWLO $NVDA $TWTR etc. selling off for a simple reason. Powell saying that when the economy returns to normal so will inflation. This leads to strong fundamentals growth (booming economy) but rising rate environment. Rising rates hit DCF discount rates on growth stocks (all of the aforementioned names have huge multiples). This means the highest multiple stocks start coming back to reality. I've been rolling back into my highest conviction names. As fundamentals show their strength, the market will likely get over the temporary valuation correction and re-rate growth names higher. I'm not going long value tech ($INTC or $FB or $AAPL), I'm going to stick to what works. Long $PINS and $SNAP more specifically."

Personal entry levels: 213.28 USD and 197.66 USD.Waiting on the sidelines. I like to buy things when they are cheap.For example: I bought a house for 15% under the market price of that time from an unemployed guy (who had to sell the house to avoid execution of the house); now the house is worth 40% more and I feel great about it.
No freedom on facebook.
"Fundamentals will always win. I'm glad the shorts made some $ because I never root for fellow small guys like me to lose money. BUt the fact IS that this is an iconic company that makes money at will, has relatively few employees and overhead, has an increasing customer base (yep) and has 70 billion in cash. This will bounce back to ATH with little difficulty."

FB down 10 percent this month while the stock market is soaring.I hope you shareholders are going to sue Zuckerberg for alienating half his customer base for personal political reasons.Sounds like breach of fiduciary responsibility to me.
It's all in the earnings call now. Lets hope they remain positive. After hours is already starting to turn in anticipation
Next game changing FB $TWTR type game changing tech/science stock?

FB starts declining from here!
"FB seems to be stuck in a narrow range. $256 in AH trading. Hoping for a breakout, but not banking on it. Still too much negative press. Need a better PR guy than Zuck as our front man."

Facebook since march lows is up 100%; the company did really well during this time and people communicated on the social media and ad revenue increased.What happens if there is suddenly a vaccin and people decide they spend enough time on Facebook?Things might have been priced in more than the underlying future business for months to come.

Mark Zuckerburg cannot be trusted. Zuckerburg and his wife helped rig an election paying poll workers $20-$60 dollars an hour. He basically funded crime. FB shares their member information with other tech companies admitted in front of congress. How can Zuckerburg and wife be trusted? FB looking to be banned in Europe! Poland and Eastern Europe had enough of Hitler.. They don’t need a Zuckerburg commie in their people’s minds! Short FB!

"Shorts,what are you donig here? Youre loosing money!, this is moving side ways for so long! And you know this is not going down"
"Apple CEO Tim Cook rails against 'purveyors of fake news' as Facebook feud rages onApple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook took to the virtual stage of the Computers, Privacy, and Data Protection (CPDP) conference on Thursday, attacking social media sites for allowing the spread of misinformation — an apparent barb aimed at Facebook (FB), though he didn’t mention its name.In his speech, Cook laid into algorithm-driven social media platforms, painting them as, “An interconnected ecosystem of companies and data brokers, of purveyors of fake news and peddlers of division, of trackers and hucksters just looking to make a quick buck.”Cook’s appearance followed Apple’s announcement that it will soon launch a controversial privacy feature that gives users the ability to stop apps from tracking their activity to collect information for advertisers. The feature could hurt Facebook and other apps that benefit from targeted advertising dollars.The feature, called App Tracking Transparency and coming to Apple devices in the next update for iOS 14, has faced heavy criticism from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who claims Apple is only making the privacy change to benefit its own bottom line.Apple and Facebook’s relationship has never been worse. They have sparred over privacy and data security for years, but iApple’s announcement at its WWDC 2020 conference that it was going to introduce App Tracking Transparency set the two tech titans on a collision course.App Tracking Transparency is a new pop-up that users will see when they download apps from the App Store that track their online activities to provide information to advertisers to better target their campaigns.Facebook, however, claims the feature will decimate small businesses that rely on its ability to effectively target ads. According to the social media company, those businesses could see a 50% reduction in revenue as a result of Apple’s changes.Facebook even went as far as to take out full-page ads in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal saying that it was fighting to save small businesses from Apple. The irony in Facebook using media outlets, which have been crushed by it and Google’s dominance of the online advertising industry, was particularly rich.During his speech Cook lambasted social platforms that operate using algorithms, which include Facebook and Twitter, for allowing everything from conspiracy theories to violent militias to propagate across their services.“What are the consequences of prioritizing conspiracy theories and violent incitement, simply because of the high rates of engagement?” Cook said.“What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in life-saving vaccinations? What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users joining extremist groups, and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more?”Prior to his speech, Cook tweeted that the industry needs transparency and reform.Facebook isn’t taking Apple’s moves lying down, though. During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg called out Apple as one of its biggest competitors. He added, “Apple has every incentive to use its dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps work to favor their own, which they regularly do.”Facebook is now, according to a report by The Information, considering filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in an effort to push back against App Tracking Transparency. That’s in addition to Facebook’s announcement in December that it was assisting Epic Games in its antitrust suit against Apple."
Zuck is Zucking up a good business by playing politics and trying to intimidate users.
"Anyone bearish on FB stock is a dummy.FB posted $10,20 EPS for the year, above the highest estimates.They are a money printing machine.Zuckerberg warns pretty much every quarter. He has made a habit of underpromisingand overdelivering quarter after quarter. Honestly look at their numbers without blind hatred and you'll see that there is no other company in the market today with this combination of an extremely high current level of profitability and growth as well as untapped future potential trading at this kind of valuation... The PE is now under 26 and people here think it should be lower?!!? Yes, there are political headwinds, but if you don't think FB will be able to sustain growth youare kidding yourself. There is no mass exodus, and people on both sides of the aisle continue to post their vitriol and will continue to do so because that's where the people are.In the short term anything can happen as we see now, but long term it's the easiest investment to buy and forget about."

Warning WhatsApp who belongs to Facebook isn't safe anymore WhatsApp announced that they will sell their users information from WhatsApp conversations to other companies for marketing reasons.They are exposing their users most private information which they don't want to share with everyone . therefore they are not trust worthy.

Now you all need to delete WhatsApp and download Signal. Fb lost millions of people on this platform too. The founder of Signal is the creator of WhatsApp and sold it to fb for 20billion. Upon leaving his employment with fb he urged everyone to delete their fb accounts due to invasion of privacy. Come on who really needs FB. Grow up! It’s a kids tool.
"Fantastic ER call. Apart from revenues and profits which jumped almost 40% yoy and insane 46% operating margin, things which will drive up the stock, one of the most under-rated aspects of how this company has evolved is their willingness and ability to deal with issues like taking down terrorist content, a success rate of 99.99% is unbelievable. Also they are getting more transparent every passing year which helps build trust with users. Congratulations FB and shareholders!"

"Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for newsOTTAWA, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Canada vowed on Thursday to makeFacebook Inc pay for news content, seeking allies in the media battle with tech giants and pledging not to back down if the social media platform shuts off the country's news as it didin Australia.Facebook blocked all Australian news content on its service over proposed legislation requiring it and Alphabet Inc's Googleto pay fees to Australian publishers for news links.Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, in charge of crafting similar legislation to be unveiled in coming months,condemned Facebook's action and said it would not deter Ottawa.""Canada is at the forefront of this battle ... we are reallyamong the first group of countries around the world that aredoing this,"" he told reporters.Last year, Canadian media organizations warned of apotential market failure without government action. They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total.Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agreeon a price through binding arbitration.Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content.""We are working to see which model would be the most appropriate,"" he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content.""I suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties withGermany, with France?"" he asked, saying that at some point Facebook's approach would become ""totally unsustainable"".University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializesin social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach.""We could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful,"" she said in a phone interview."

"""Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him in so far as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country.

It will be integrated with Facebook's Pages to enable publishing across multimedia formats including photos, live videos and stories style updates.The idea is that writers can earn through subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community.Facebook will allow them to create Groups for their work as well, and also provide metrics on their newsletters. To pilot the program, Facebook plans to pay to help get the tools to build actual websites, in addition to newsletters, off the ground. Moreover, the company will look to add monetization tools later."
"Drugs for Sale Plague Social Media PlatformsWASHINGTON, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media platforms continue to have difficulty removing illegal offers of opioids, steroids and COVID-19 ""vaccines."" Even after they have been alerted of specific posts and long past when they have made public pledges to do a better job of making their services safe for U.S. consumers, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram are not backing their words with action, new research from the Digital Citizens Alliance (Digital Citizens) and the Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) shows.The Digital Weeds 2021 report revisited past research conducted by Digital Citizens and CSW to determine if social media platforms have truly addressed illicit activity that was brought to their attention. Researchers searched for old posts and previous users who were attempting to conduct illegal activity. In some cases, the research teams found accounts and similar posts from the same users, whose posts were taken down years earlier, still up on the platforms. In some cases, the research teams found current accounts and similar posts from the same users who were identified years earlier.In addition, researchers also found that the fraudulent sale of COVID-19 vaccines, which was identified by DCA and CSW in February, remains despite calls for action by Facebook's Advisory Board to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and related dangers.""I find it amazing that the platforms have the ability to pinpoint a 47-year-old resident of Walla Walla, Washington who might be interested in buying retro-styled, minor league baseball caps from teams of the 1950s, but can't figure out a way to stop the posts pushing illegal and/or illicit activities on their pages,"" said Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin. ""The platforms have had a chance to correct this problem. How much more evidence do we need to present before lawmakers say, 'enough is enough' and take the action the platforms themselves have not been able to take?""Both Google and Facebook, once enormously popular, respected companies, are increasingly questioned by consumers as well as federal and state regulators for their business practices. But a lot remains the same: • Criminal activity and/or illicit activity highlighted in previous research, such as the selling of opioids, steroids, and malware, can still be found easily today. • Many videos and posts shared in prior DCA and CSW reports and/or with media contacts are still available across numerous social media platforms. • The platforms still have advertising from premium, respected brands running next to videos and/or posts for illegal and/or illicit item. • The platforms allow for communication between drug pushers and potential buyers. Whether by containing phone numbers and emails in videos and/or posts or allowing for conversations to happen in chats. • The platforms' algorithms amplify connectivity between potential buyers and sellers of illegal and/or illicit items. Researchers, acting as potential buyers looking for drugs, showed that when they look for drugs on Instagram, Instagram will in turn begin directing drug sellers back to the potential buyer. • When outed by media outlets, platforms will often take down specific videos mentioned by reporters, but not address the larger problem. This leaves consumers vulnerable to similar, or sometimes even the same scams, that inspired the news coverage in the first place.Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, President of the Coalition for a Safer Web, added: ""Our report is another abject proofpoint that so long as social media companies are unregulated and left to run wild, consumers will be exposed to the criminal web marketplace opened by extremists and terrorists hawking illicit, dangerous drugs to fund their organizations and operations. Until Congress acts, both the FDA (by issuing formal warning letters prohibiting the sale of illegal drugs) and the FTC (by prohibiting criminal operations on social media companies) must step in immediately to protect the American people?"""

"Instagram is ‘most invasive app’, new study showsInstagram has topped a list of “invasive” apps that collect and share users’ data.Cloud storage firm pCloud made the discovery after analysing the recently introduced App Privacy labels that companies are now required to include within Apple’s App Store.The study found that Instagram collects 79 per cent of its users’ personal data and shares it with third parties, including search history, location, contacts and financial info.“Any information you agree to be gathered by an app when signing up can be analysed for their benefit and even shared. Everything from your browsing history, to your location, your banking details, your contact details, and your fitness levels can be valuable for apps to store, use, or sell on,” Ivan Dimitrov, a digital manager at pCloud, wrote in a blog post detailing the research.“With over 1 billion monthly active users it’s worrying that Instagram is a hub for sharing such a high amount of its unknowing users’ data.”The second worst offender for sharing the personal data of its users was Instagram’s parent company, Facebook. The social network gave away 57 per cent of its users’ data to third parties, which can include companies that are associated with the company.Food delivery apps Uber Eats and Deliveroo also scored badly, both featuring in the top 10 alongside LinkedIn, Trainline, YouTube, Duolingo and eBay.By contrast, fellow food delivery apps Just Eat, Grubhub and My McDonald’s were among the few apps that gave away no user data at all.Other apps that protected their users’ data included privacy-centric messaging apps Signal and Telegram, as well as online streaming services BBC iPlayer and Netflix.Apple’s new privacy labels have forced tech companies to publicise exactly how they are tracking people, recently prompting privacy-focussed search engine DuckDuckGo to accuse Google of “spying on users”.After delaying the release of its privacy labels, Google revealed this week that it collects users’ location, financial info, browsing history and audio data.“After months of stalling, Google finally revealed how much personal data they collect in Chrome and the Google app,” stated a post on DuckDuckGo’s Twitter account. “No wonder they wanted to hide it.”When the App Store update was first announced last year, privacy advocates said the new transparency standard was critical for the future of online privacy.“The changes mean people can more easily consider privacy issues when choosing whether or not to buy or download an app,” the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA, who helped push for the new labels.“Safeguarding people’s control over their data is important for protecting privacy as well as for the healthy operation of the market.”"

"Could have been a good idea, but it was used for greed and is no longer worth anything."
"In August, 2018, FB stock was trading around $218. Here we are two-and-a-half years later, and the Dow up 50% since then, and FB shares are just $48 higher. Not exactly a high flying growth stock by that account despite quarter after quarter of excellent results from a business standpoint. So what's the problem? I say it's Zuck and his mouth and ill thought out policies. FB needs a new leader, and one who is a hundred times less controversial than Zuck. He ain't helping shareholders, and whether he likes it or not, shareholder value should be Priority #1 with him. Not his political agenda."

"Now, I do admit $SNAP is mostly saturated domestically and in Europe in terms of usage. The real user growth opportunity is going to come from international (think Mexico, East Asia, Latin America, etc.) where purchasing power is lower, but Android is the predominant mobile operating system. In $SNAP's Analyst Day event they highlight the ways they are going to sustain strong engagement. At this point in time, $SNAP has differentiated itself enough from the competition that the risk of competition grabbing users is likely minimal. It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing. At the end of the day, I'm focused on the long-term of this company. The biggest concern about this company is it's valuation. And believe me, I understand the concern. At ~15.7x '22 revenue, it's not cheap. Or is it? Let me break down my valuation for this business, and why it could generate so much more in returns than $FB or $TWTR."

"Anger mounts as Facebook's Australia news ban sweeps up charities, government pagesSYDNEY (Reuters) - Dozens of Australian companies, charities and information providers reacted with anger on Thursday after being shut down by Facebook, imploring the social media giant to restore their pages as calls for users to delete the platform grew.Australians were blocked from accessing news in their Facebook feeds after an escalation of the proposed media bargaining code which would require the company and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms.But several charities and pages of official health, meteorology and emergency services were also blocked, along with smaller, niche content providers.Foodbank Australia, one of the many charities caught in the crossfire, said Facebook's response was ""unacceptable"".""Hours matter when you have nothing to eat. SORT THIS OUT!"" CEO Brianna Casey tweeted.Save the Children CEO Paul Ronalds said the charity had come to rely on the platform to communicate with supporters and members.""We also use Facebook as an important fundraising tool to reach generous supporters who want to support the world’s most vulnerable children,"" he said. ""Every minute that our page is down is another minute our message isn’t getting out about the needs of children.""Facebook had restored the government services pages by afternoon, but there were still small businesses and community groups who were left venting, with #facebooknewsban and #DeleteFacebook trending on microblogging site Twitter.Rachel Chappell who founded a Sydney-based community group 'North Shore Mums' nine years ago woke up to see her Facebook page with its 35,000 followers disappear.“We’re a mum’s website. We are small and niche. This is not fair,” said Chappell, who built up a small business for mothers, writing about family-friendly cafes and pets for the local community, and attracting advertising.""I think they are just bullies. They are shooting themselves in the foot. I spend my A$20,000 marketing budget to promote our content with Facebook,” said Chappell, adding the move had “completely shaken” her.Facebook's reach in Australia is powerful. It has more than 11 million users in a population of 25 million and takes in about 24% of the country's advertising spend, according to the competition regulator.A Facebook representative in Australia did not reply to a request for comment. A later Facebook statement said the ban should not affect government pages but ""as the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition"".""CUTE CATS AND CONSPIRACIES""Several organisations posted social media messages directing followers to their websites or other platforms including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram.Journalist Jelisa Apps said many rural areas and country towns relied on their local paper's Facebook pages as physical copies were stripped back over the years. Other social media platforms were not as widely used, she said.""I've just checked my hometown's newspaper page. It's gone. This is a real shame. An undervalued audience having their news further limited,"" Apps said on Twitter.Peter Lewis, director of the Australia Institute's Centre for Responsible Technology said Facebook's decision would make it a weaker social network.Facebook ""is destroying its social licence to operate,"" Lewis said.""Without fact-based news to anchor it, Facebook will become little more than a cute cats and conspiracy theories (page),"" he added.""If Facebook determines to treat Australians with such contempt, Australians should respond by ending its use of Facebook and using alternate ways to connect online."""

"How Democrats could end Wall Street's infatuation with Facebook, Amazon and GoogleBrace for it, tech bulls. Those investors who have been conditioned these past five years to only expect big tech stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to do one thing — go up, and go up huge — may be in for a wake-up call in coming quarters as the newly emboldened Democratic party looks to drop the regulatory hammer on these powerful giants.“We continue to anticipate that the regulatory overhang for mega-cap internet companies will continue in 2021 and see a breakup of Facebook to be most structurally concerning for investors given a difficult/expensive unwind and that separate Instagram and WhatsApp platforms would likely compete directly for usage and advertisers,” says BofA Securities tech analyst Justin Post.Post outlines numerous regulatory concerns for investors in Facebook, Amazon and Google, which could collectively weigh on the multiples the already expensive stocks trade on.“With the Democratic sweep, we see a slightly higher possibility for new legislation that: 1) establishes a Privacy Bill of Rights restricting the use of personal data; 2) re-defines market power in large tech; and, 3) regulates companies as digital utilities,” Post explains. “We also think the Democratic Party-led government will even more strongly support the DoJ [Department of Justice] and FTC [Federal Trade Commission] efforts to break-up Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. President-elect Biden’s decision to name Bruce Reed (helped craft the landmark 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act) as top technology advisor signals higher probability for the administration to adopt a regulatory agenda focused on consumer policy protection (similar to GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California).”Post adds the recent insurrection on Capitol Hill will likely renew calls among lawmakers to make social media platforms “more accountable” and also revoke Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.The end result of these would-be government actions on Facebook, Amazon and Google, Post argues, may be pressured sales, increased operating costs and outgoing cash flow to pay fines. More often than not, these are conditions for a stock price to lose value as investors recalculate the future of the underlying company.And the selling could become pronounced.Enthusiasm for big tech stocksFacebook, Amazon and Google remain the most owned three tech stocks among large cap active managers, according to Post’s research. In other words, these are some of the most crowded trades on Wall Street that may be unwound quickly as a the government sticks a pin in the big-cap tech bubble.Despite the growing regulatory risks (fueled in part by 38 U.S. state attorneys general in December signing an antitrust lawsuit against Google, as Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan details here) ushered in by the arrival of a Blue Wave in government, the stock prices of tech’s three most scrutinized names continue to be loved on Wall Street.All three stocks outperformed the S&P 500 (again) in 2020, paced by a 70% rise in Amazon as U.S. consumers relied heavily on the platform during the COVID-19 pandemic.But the enthusiasm for big-cap tech stocks — often seen through the prism of the FAANG complex [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google] — has waned to kick off 2021 perhaps because of the reality that new regulations from a Democratic-controlled government are coming.Shares of the FAANG stocks are all lower (Facebook is the worst performer, down 8.1%) year-to-date compared to the 1.1% gain for the S&P 500.Not helping sentiment on big-cap tech stocks right now is the specter of a new $1.9 trillion stimulus plan from the Biden administration. If enacted in any form, the stimulus could lead to a sizable rotation into cyclical sectors of the market from “safe-haven’ big-cap tech stocks.“The spending comes at an interesting junction for analysts and investors as it will no doubt mean further EPS upgrades. It will also mean that many early cycle S&P 500 sectors will see faster earnings revisions than the popular FAANG+ and IT which dominated investor attention in 2020,”"

"Google, Facebook agreed to team up against possible antitrust action, draft lawsuit says - WSJDec 22 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google agreed to ""cooperate and assist one another"" in case of an investigation into their pact to work together in online advertising, the Wall Street Journal reported late on Monday.The Journal report cited an unredacted version of a lawsuit filed by 10 states against Google last week.The states had accused Google of working with Facebook in an unlawful manner that violated antitrust law to boost its already-dominant online advertising business.According to the report, the lawsuit said that Google and Facebook were aware that their agreement could trigger antitrust investigations and discussed how to deal with them.A Google spokesperson told the Journal that such agreements over antitrust threats are extremely common.The unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which the Journal said it reviewed, also said that Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg signed the deal with Google.The draft version also cites an email in which Sandberg told Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and other executives that ""this is a big deal strategically,"" the report said."

You can’t single out one person or one company and discriminate no matter how much you dislike their behavior. You have to treat all of social media and tech companies the same across the board. What they are doing to FB is illegal. This tax has to be applied to all of those companies in the same manner. Now do you think this will have a chance in any Australian Court or any Court based on English Common Law????

"It's amusing how the senators are demanding answers from Facebook, but, you never hear a word from them about the dozens and dozens of other companies, big and small, that have had very serious data breaches. The love to grandstand and try to show that they are doing such a great job of protecting their constituents. Because FB has such a high profile and everyone uses it, they center it out while ignoring every other case of privacy breaches. Vote them all out of office and put brand new people in their places. Voters need to keep doing that until elected officials realize that they aren't fooling anyone with their phoniness and are not going to continue to be elected until they do an honest job."

"20M child sexual abuse images on Facebook in 2020, report saysWASHINGTON (SBG) - Facebook had more than 20 million child sexual abuse images on its platform in 2020, according to a report by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.“You don’t want to talk to your kids about sexual exploitation, you don’t want to talk to the kids about sex or pornography,” said Rezsaun Lewis, a father of five. But Lewis says he has already talked to his kids about pornography, fearing exploitative images of children may pop up on their feeds.“To be sexually abused and then for it to be put on camera and for millions of strangers to watch it for enjoyment, that’s sick,” said Lewis.In 2020, 1,400 companies reported over 21 million incidents related to child pornography. Google had over 546,00 incidents; TikTok over 22,000.“We are talking about crime scene photos,” said NCMEC's Lauren Coffren. “We're taking about the sexual abuse of the child that unfortunately has been memorialized.”Coffren believes the numbers could be even higher than reported.“The real story behind it is that some companies are making an awful lot of reports and some companies are not making a lot of reports,” said Coffren.“We have victims who are 20 years pass the actual hands-on or contact of use, and they are still suffering as a victim because the imagery is still being distributed,” said Coffren. “It’s the crime that never ends.”“As a parent I make a point of it to put certain restraints on my kids phone, there’s parental blocks on everything,” said Lewis."

"Bull case on this stock is a run to $100+ on fundamentals. Once $SNAP can deliver market-rate eCPMs comparable to $FB, ARPU can run to $FB levels (~$45-$50/DAU). $SNAP has not content moderation expenses and so you can conceivably get to 55-60% operating margins long-term, blowing through even peak $FB operating margins. Take a step back, take a long-term view, understand the story, and discount back to present value. I'm at ~$100+ on $SNAP fundamentals wise."

"The Creepy Way Facebook, Google And Amazon Profit Off Our Private DataOur lives and habits are being tracked. Every time we tap in a Google search, every time we click “Like” on Facebook and every time we make an Amazon purchase, we are giving away information about ourselves: our thoughts, our preferences, our behaviors.We are providing data that can be packaged up and sold to companies, which then use that data to try to modify our behavior and steer us toward buying products or using their services.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it the commodification of human data. In the information era we live in, she explains in her new book, “The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are the marketable product. It’s a terrifying idea.So, what is surveillance capitalism?It’s important to know that in many ways, surveillance capitalism differs dramatically from other forms of capitalism over the last couple of centuries. Capitalism is claiming things that live outside the marketplace, bringing them into the market and turning them into what people call “commodities,” things that can be sold and purchased.Industrial capitalism, which dominated the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, famously claimed nature. The trees and the forests and the rivers — these are entities that have a life of their own. Industrial capitalism brought nature into the market dynamic, and nature was reborn. It was called “land,” and it was called “real estate.” That allowed it to be sold and purchased and become the source of profit.Surveillance capitalism proceeds according to this pattern, but with a dark and unexpected twist. So unexpected, in fact, that it’s taken us quite a while to catch on to what they’ve actually done. Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience for the market dynamic.It says that private human experience is now a source of free, raw material — just like harvesting wheat or collecting ore from a mountain side. [We are] a source of free, raw material that can be processed into data, and those data can be computed and sold and purchased and owned.That sequence has created the largest, wealthiest and most powerful companies — like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — that the world has ever known. All of that begins with the unilateral declaration that private human experience is ours for the taking.Ultimately, what surveillance capitalists are trying to do is sell predictions. It’s not only to know our behavior, but it’s to predict our behavior. That’s how they make their money.Those predictions are not to improve our lives, but rather they’re sold to business customers who have a business interest in knowing what we will do next — because that raises the certainty that they have about how to successfully get us to behave in a way that serves their bottom line."

Anyone buying this stock still is actively funding a company bent on turning the world into their twisted vision.
"FB is going to turn in a “barn burner “ of a Q4 earnings report in 2 weeks — one week after the current Administration is done and gone!*** The documentary on Senator McCarthy in the 1950’s, and American History reveals that after “populism” suffers a swift and precipitous decline after its “jump the shark moment”!- The current Administration will go the way of “McCarthyism” of the 1950’s!- Play the rebound in FB stock for last Wednesday was “the beginning of the end”, AND the beginning of the rebound for the Great American Republic”!!!"
"Hello fellow FBers I come in peace. Honest question, what is holding this stock down because I see that we are well below price target. (Long since 2012)"
Earnings are gonna be best ever this quarter. I'm opening a position outside my retirement IRA in facebook before earnings. It's been underperforming and is the lowest PE of all tech stocks.

Suckerburg backed Joe...it makes sense he would take peoples 1st amendment right from them or anyonehe doesn't back or like. These social media tech companies need to be reined in asap. Only the usershave the power to stop them and the stock holders. Hurt them in the pocketbook.
Here we go!!!
Now even more glad I sold my $TWTR end of Dec for some great gains as looks like it's going to be cyptonite to own it going forward. Going to now look at unloading my $FB as well. #timber
"I have had a Facebook account since 2007 and i finally permanently deactivated it today. Though the impact of my action may not be as large as an individual who owned stock in the company then sold it off due to forecasting and distrust of the platform actions, I know there are many others like myself who are leaving. Consumer demand is taking a sharp downwards turn. Substitutes will arise despite market entry barriers. People are fed up."
We are so due for aMultiple expansion. Let’s go Facebook. Maybe it’s our time longs.
Chinese news talked about allowing FB in China in return for loosing regulation on TikTok. Is that possible?

just sold ALL of my facebook before it tanks. I will not be a part of a company that censors ANYONE. facebook is a place where people should be able to express THEIR opinions to THEIR friends. FACEBOOK was never elected to shut down any ones opinion or 1st amendment right to give their opinion. I also have seen that facebook is lying about how many users they have since there are a lot of people that have multiple accounts because they lock people out and then their have been a lot of people that have left them and went to PARLOR where they are not censored but facebook still has them as an active account because we all know how hard it is to close your account. I hope you goto zero facebbook. you are not a company that deserves my support and I can see this is not just my opinion
That's only one lawsuit. There will be many more little man.

"All three indexes in the red at 7:15 AM EST. Fridays can be goofy, especially during the final hour of trading. FB only off about a buck, so maybe today won't be so bad. Not expecting any miracle surges in the pps heading into the weekend. If the excellent earnings report didn't propel us into $280s or higher, I'm afraid we may be stuck where we are for the time being. Might be okay going forward so long as the pols don't beat up on us too much. However, you can count on the MSM, all of whom have taken big financial hits with lost ad revenue, to pile on unmercifully. Anything they can do to embellish and/or slant stories about censorship, privacy, monopoly and the other broadsides being aimed at FB to their own benefit, rest assured, they will do exactly that."
Short this stock. It serves no purpose. FB spreads hate and has shown how much they hate the President. No room for a company like this here. Maybe they should move to Cuba. I'm sure they will get away with the same thing there.

FB is trading in “gift horse ” territory!- FB Mgmt has ingeniously managed the recent negative headlines — into a great advantage for its global business in Australia and now in the EU!*** FB’s proactive “win-win” negotiations have been nothing short of brilliant as should pay off in time!
"In my opinion, this company has serious issues. While I totally understand that companies may hit road blocks from time to time, this company seems to hit a road block every other week. To me, that's indicative of management not making the right moves. I won't place the blame on any one individual, but clearly something is very wrong and Facebook needs to do a true and unbiased evaluation of their management and internal operations. All of this is quite unfortunate as the company arguably has the best balance sheet of any public company on the planet, but it's not reflected in the stock price due to various issues that seemingly aren't being handled correctly. I hope Facebook can turn things around and get back to on the path to greatness, but to me, things are very questionable right now."

For those three reasons, I'm confident that Facebook will get past this and continue to move forward."
"FB, together with Instagram and Messenger do not have a strong competitor presently - this is simply the reality. Twitter and LinkedIn serve completely different purposes and no one uses Google+. I believe FB is demonstrating that they are trying to address the issues and the people will continue to use them, while the company bring robust profits through new business models, which do not necessarily have to be growth-based. How much more should they grow???"
Will FB head to new highs? I believe so. Momentum appears to be in the stock and nothing appears in its way. FB will shatter earnings again. Just a matter of this week or next before 200

"Europe Publishers Turn Up Heat on Facebook After Australia Spat(Bloomberg) -- News publishers are urging the European Union to copy parts of a proposed law in Australia that would force Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay an agreed price for their content.The publishers want EU lawmakers to force the tech giants into binding arbitration if they can’t agree on payments for snippets of articles shown on the platforms. They want a clause inserted in legislation proposed in December to rein in the big tech firms, known as the Digital Markets Act.The industry sees an opportunity to press its case after Facebook imposed a news sharing blackout in response to Australia’s legislative move in an unprecedented show of strength. Publishers have hemorrhaged advertising revenue to digital platforms for decades.“It has become clear that without the full force of an Australian style approach, gatekeeper tech companies threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,” said Angela Mills Wade, executive director of the European Publishers Council, which represents publishers including Axel Springer and The New York Times. She said the EPC would support European lawmakers seeking to ensure that platforms negotiate in good faith.The EU already agreed a separate copyright law to help publishers seek compensation from the platforms, after years of negotiations involving industry, officials and lawmakers. Andreas Schwab, the lead lawmaker in charge of the DMA, said the copyright law protects people’s ability to share content while supporting quality journalism online.For some publishers, the rules still don’t go far enough. France is one of the only countries so far to apply the copyright law, but its competition authority had to step in last year to force Google to pay for displaying news.When France rolled out the law, Google started showing stripped-down French news search results that didn’t include previews of the articles. The search giant eventually reached a deal in January with a French publishers’ union that it will negotiate individual license agreements.The tech giants are still finding ways to “wriggle out” of their obligations to publishers even with the EU copyright rules in place, said Wout van Wijk, executive director of News Media Europe, an umbrella organization representing national publisher associations.“We would welcome a clause that mandates binding arbitration,” he said."
"I would definitely consider this to be bad for the market. I've lost a ton of money thinking a market would be bullish before, and I've learned my lesson. Just be aware and decisive if you're considering buying$INTC $FB $WIMI"
"Inside the Google-Facebook Ad Deal at the Heart of a Price-Fixing LawsuitLawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction riggingGoogle allegedly gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a lawsuit brought by 10 Republican state attorneys general saysState attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants, Facebook Inc. FB -0.08% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG -0.98% Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”Crucial to the backdrop of the Google-Facebook deal was the advertising industry’s movement toward an ad-sales method called header bidding.Header bidding helped website publishers circumvent Google’s exchanges for buying and selling ads across the web. The exchange auctions ad space to the highest bidder during the split second it takes a webpage to load.Header bidding allowed the publishers to directly solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges at once, leading to more favorable prices for publishers. Google worried a big rival might embrace header bidding, such as the Facebook Audience Network ad service, or FAN, cracking Google’s profitable monopoly over ad tools, the states allege. “Need to fight off the existential threat posed by header bidding and FAN,” Google advertising executive Chris LaSala wrote in an internal document outlining 2017 priorities, according to the draft complaint.In March 2017, Facebook publicly endorsed header bidding. Google approached Facebook and in September 2018 reached the digital advertising agreement, the states allege. The draft lawsuit says Google code-named it “Jedi Blue.” In December 2018, Facebook announced it was joining an advertising program, “Open Bidding,” that Google offers as an alternative to header bidding.TERMS OF THE ‘JEDI BLUE’ CONTRACTThese are some of the alleged stipulations in the Google-Facebook contract, according to a recent, unredacted draft of the states’ lawsuit viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Google says it is common to match users through trackers known as cookies, and it publicly offers that service to other buyers. • Facebook pays Google a 5% to 10% transaction fee. (Google says this fee is standard.) • Google helps Facebook recognize mobile and web users. • Facebook bids to show ads to 90% of users it recognizes. • Facebook has 300 millisecond “timeout” to recognize user and bid. Some other participants have shorter, 160 millisecond timeout. • Facebook is locked into spending $500 million annually starting in the fourth year.In return, the states allege in the final suit, Google gave Facebook special treatment. Among other things, it allowed Facebook to send bids directly into Google’s widely used software, known as an ad server, the draft lawsuit says.Typically, bidders go through an exchange, which sends the winner on to Google’s server. By circumventing the middleman, Facebook could face less competition and save money. Google barred Facebook from discussing pricing terms publicly, the draft says.Google also told Facebook which ad opportunities were likely produced by bots rather than by consumers, and it didn’t charge Facebook for those impressions, according to the draft suit. Other auction participants asked Google for the same information but were denied it, the final lawsuit says, redacting the information in question.Any bidder without that information would be at a disadvantage, said Adam Heimlich, CEO of ad technology company Chalice Custom Algorithms LLC. “It’s like saying CarMax has the ability to tell when they have a junky used car, and they don’t tell you,” he said. Mr. Heimlich accused Google of harming competition at a Senate hearing this year.Unlike other types of antitrust cases, which can require complex market analysis and the sussing out of business motivations, agreements to fix prices or rig auctions are inherently illegal, said Harry First, a New York University antitrust law professor who was once the head of New York state’s antitrust enforcement bureau.“The only defense that a court will hear is, ‘We didn’t do it,’ ” he said."

"PALO ALTO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc may face questions about fallout from U.S. election controversies when it posts earnings on Wednesday, but top of mind for investors is a less political matter: the company's heavy bet on e-commerce to drive ad sales.The world's biggest social media company is poised to reap a windfall from that gambit, analysts say, bolstered by a return in ad growth rates to pre-COVID levels and a holiday shopping boost from its new ""social commerce"" features.Wall Street expects the company to report fourth-quarter sales up 25% to $26.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Driving those gains were a coronavirus-era shift away from physical stores and the unequal impact of the pandemic on low-income populations, which left others with ""flush household balance sheets,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note."

And seven trading days after that (Oct 1), the share price reached $268.33 (a +10% increase from its Sep 21 low of $244.13). Later that month, on Oct 26, it peaked at $285.23 (a +16.8% increase in one calendar month). Just eight trading days after that (Nov 5), it peaked at $297.38 (a +21.8% increase from the Sep 21 low)."
"This stock should be trading $100 higher in the $360-370 range, and yet it continues to struggle to rise above the $270 price point. The disdain for and distrust of the company, which translates into the distaste for the company leadership, is weighing down the share price and is contributing to its massive volatility.As a shareholder, I’m disgusted with the massive loss of shareholder value and the gut-wrenching volatility; I want to see a new management team that can restore public trust, win back public sentiment, and lead the company forward with integrity, innovation, and profitability."
"I was watching a CNBC story where Maryland wants to tax tech on their advertising revenue. I was thinking: what if you gave away a free newspaper and the state came in and taxed you because you had ads? The senator himself said that tech was such a big part of his state's education, but I guess he neglected to realize that those services are mainly free and the ads fund the companies"
"We are people who love freedom and peace. Let's stand up and crush those (The swamp of parliament, Media, and Bigtech) who have colluded corruption and sold this country to China."
"Dow up almost 600 points and FB up less than a buck (0.78 as I type)! So much for blow out Q42020 earnings sending the pps to $300. As has been in the case in the past, Zuck's guidance wasn't exactly a heart pumping endorsement.Dunno. maybe he does that on purpose to temper the Street's estimates of future revenues and earnings because he knows he'll probably beat them next reporting period? Anyway, happy we're off yesterday's post-market lows, but truth be told, was expecting better."
I was wondering when some of these alternative platforms were gonna get caught in the crosshairs of the powers that be.
"The PE for Facebook, a company typically categorized as a growth company, is 29. Compare that to the PEs of similar growth-oriented companies:Apple 40Amazon 93Google 35Netflix 88Nvidia 89It’s painful to witness and admit, but Facebook is sold at quite a discount compared to its peers. Why? In my honest opinion, it’s attributable to the distrust of the management team and a lack of confidence in their growth story. When’s the last time you heard someone from Facebook talk bullishly about their growth strategy? I am imploring other Facebook shareholders to join me in demanding the resignations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg so we can achieve full market value of the share price."
meanwhile back at headquarters mark and crew are shredding everything!
$NFLX $FB $WIMI hopefully we go strong in the morning...
Apple is offering transparency for the iPhone user. That’s it. 100% about letting people know what’s happening with their data and they can choose how they want their data to be used. That’s great for everyone. What possible argument can Zuckerberg have? He looks bad.
"They stole a election (or parts thereof) They covered it up. They then silenced anyone who objected to it. And you're buying their stock? The whole world longs for freedom, and you're selling in for peanuts."
I've never bought FB before but got in after hours at 167... we'll see tomorrow.
"Has anybody noticed how many shares Zuckerburg has sold since November? Interesting isn't it, follow the money. This thing is heading lower."

The Absolute Best Meme Stocks To Watch For Explosive Gains Check out https://youtu.be/h_BshPXySww
"Wow, check out Netflix’s price action yesterday - up nearly 17% to $586 after positive fourth quarter results; it’s now trading at 96 times earnings. Maybe Facebook should change its name to Faceflix and perhaps it would trade around $810/share. Why the disparity in how these two stocks trade? It’s all about public sentiment, and public sentiment is everything. In the words of Abraham Lincoln: “Public sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.” Zuckerberg and Sandberg no longer have public sentiment in their favor, and it’s unlikely they can succeed without it. Now is the time for shareholders to push for a change: Zuckerberg and Sandberg must go!"

"The world knows of the problems liberals have created at the border. Its being over run. Even Biden is telling immigrants to stay home for a while. Yes liberals, like Pelosi, Schumer, google , fb and twitter, have helped open the border, and they have banned the media from covering their fiasco, and the hardships they have created.They come into America, to escape being exploited. Sadly their next round of exploitation starts right at the border, and gets worse when they come in.

"Congratulations to Zuck! He is now even richer than Warren Buffett. He is the world’s third richest person! FB is not Buffett’s kind of stock, but it would be if he understood the company. FB’s returns will far outpace $AAPL’s over the next 5-10 years. I hope Buffett is still around to see me proven right! He is a legend."

"Might get some buying in the AM as bargain hunters buy the dip. However, I think by the close we'll be hoping to end the week above $250. I think we will finish at $250 or higher, but after all those glamorous target prices were announced, I was hoping for much better than a $250ish pps."
"Few ppl talks how reopenning could be bullish for fb, yes ppl will spend less time on social media but barely IMO. But advertising will go much higher with small/medium company reopening."

"FB just censored Kevin Sorbo, best known as Hercules on TV and in the movies. Why? Because Sorbo is a conservative and doesn't agree with Zuck's liberal policies and friends. I wonder who is gonna be next? Maybe it will be you or me! The over-the-top hubris being exhibited by Zuck just males that target on his back bigger and easier to hit. The downside for shareholders is the fact the we suffer every time this sort of nonsense makes headlines."
FB is reaching $300 after some consolidation. Fantastic earnings engine so time to load up.
I would get rid of this stock. They won't be going up with all the court battles. Kevin Sorbo was blocked today. Its ok to disagree with anyone but you can't remove someone because you do. This is America.

"Market is gonna hold this down to shake out the short term options positions. Flat is good for the writers of the options as both call and put holders lose with the deterioration of time value which rapidly happens after an earnings release and reduction in the volatility premium. If you are long shares, you are golden as this will start to rise in a week or so after most of the value of the options has been captured.Clearly the latest quarterly report shows this is a $350+ company and funds will accumulate once the dust clears and some optics holders take their losses.This is self evident and anything else is just noise."

"Australia passes new law requiring Facebook and Google to pay for newsAustralia has passed a new law that will force tech companies to pay publishers for news content, setting the stage for potential, similar action in other countries.The new code, which the Australian parliament approved Thursday, ""will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate,"" Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement.The country's unprecedented new law had been hotly debated in recent months. Facebook and Google had opposed the initial version of the legislation, which would have allowed media outlets to bargain either individually or collectively with them — and to enter binding arbitration if the parties couldn't reach an agreement.Facebook even shut down news pages in Australia last week in opposition to the legislation. But it restored them earlier this week after the country made some changes to the code, including a provision that ""must take into account whether a digital platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through reaching commercial agreements with news media businesses.""Arbitration, meanwhile, will now only be used as a ""last resort"" following a period of ""good faith"" mediation."

"Following An Insurrection, Lawmakers And State Attorneys General Are Asking Facebook To Halt Ads Of Military Gear“Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”Three senators and four attorneys general demanded Facebook pause or permanently halt the advertisement of military goods and tactical gear following last week’s insurrection at the US Capitol.Two letters — one signed by senators from Illinois, Connecticut, and Ohio, and the other from the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, and Washington, DC — cited Facebook’s role in allowing extremists to organize the Capitol riot and asked its leaders reexamine how they were profiting from national turmoil. Facebook was showing ads for body armor, gun targets, and other weapon accessories in the News Feeds of people who had engaged with content about the attempted coup or followed extremist and far-right organizations on the platform.“Facebook must hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company’s products and platform to further their own illicit aims,” wrote Sens. Tammy Duckworth, Richard Blumenthal, and Sherrod Brown. “Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”Facebook employees had raised concerns internally about the ads. “I’m seeing ads for tactical armor in my news feed,” one employee wrote on Thursday, sharing a screenshot of the advertisement. “When I looked at why I’m seeing these for the first time EVER it says the ads are targeting males in the USA. This is concerning to me, as I have never had any interest in this or anything like it.”Those ads may be shown to people who are being radicalized on the social network. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit industry watchdog group, showed that a Facebook account set up by the organization to follow pages belonging to right-wing extremists and militant organizations was regularly shown ads for military gear in between posts casting doubt on the presidential election and praising the assault on the US Capitol.TTP’s Facebook account, which mimics the activity of a right-wing extremist middle-aged man, continued to see body armor ads as of Friday afternoon.""Facebook has spent years facilitating fringe voices who use the platform to organize and amplify calls for violence,” TTP Director Katie Paul said in a previous statement. “As if that weren't enough, Facebook's advertising microtargeting is directing domestic extremists toward weapons accessories and armor that can make their militarized efforts more effective, all while Facebook profits.""The senators’ note to CEO Mark Zuckerberg asked the company to “immediately develop and execute a Facebook policy permanently prohibiting advertisements of products that a reasonable observer would interpret as primarily designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.” Their letter also asked that the company hire an independent law firm to investigate what role it had played in providing a platform for the planning of the Capitol attack, as well as appoint a member to the board of directors who has “expertise in matters of domestic terrorism.”The four attorneys general wrote, “Halting this advertising while the nation prepares to respond to [an unprecedented] domestic threat is a simple action that Facebook can take to support this response and to help prevent another emergency like the one the country experienced on January 6.”The letters come as Facebook faces landmark antitrust lawsuits from federal and state governments. The attorneys general who wrote the letter are part of a coalition of regulators from the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states and territories that have sued the company for maintaining an illegal monopoly and stifling competition.Both documents were critical of a statement from Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the attempted coup was “largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate.” Despite the company’s efforts, Facebook has been a cauldron for hate and conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.“The public comments of your COO are even more perplexing in light of a public report that your own employees internally flagged advertisements featuring semi-automatic rifles and selling body armor and other equipment as irresponsible and dangerous,” the senators wrote.“We are deeply disappointed that based on the existing facts and circumstances, we have little confidence in your company or your corporate leadership,” they added."
MZ has no clue how big the GOP is. He'll figure it out.
This valuation is just silly. It’s trading under the PE ratio of the S&P 500 and has more than 3x the growth as most of the companies in it. This should be valued at $350/share. I believe the negativity around Facebook will die down and eventually pass with the new party coming in. I think we will see this valued where it should be as a growth and revenue beast.

"Booyah !!! ""Time Spent on Social Media and Messaging Apps Is Also Still GrowingTime spent on social media and ""communications"" apps is believed to have risen 35% from 2016 to 2018, and is estimated to have accounted for 50% of total time spent on apps last year. And outside of China, Facebook's (FB) various apps, reported by the company to collectively have over 2.6 billion monthly active users (MAUs), continue accounting for a giant portion of this activity.Among social and communications apps, Facebook Messenger, core Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ranked No. 1, 2, 4 and 5 in terms of downloads last year, respectively. Notably, WhatsApp, which Facebook is just beginning to monetize, surpassed the core Facebook app in terms of MAUs towards the end of 2018.WhatsApp is now Facebook's most popular app, according to App Annie.WhatsApp was also reported to be the most popular social and communications app among Android users in several major foreign markets. However, it didn't crack the top-five in the U.S., where Facebook Messenger and Snapchat are both widely used on Android (on iOS, Apple's iMessage is of course also quite popular."""

"Australia's antitrust chief claims victory after Facebook standoffCANBERRA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The architect of Australia’s laws forcing Google and Facebook to pay media companies for content claimed victory on Wednesday though critics said last-minute changes to appease Facebook favoured Big Media over smaller news outlets.After tense negotiations prompted Facebook to cut off news in the country last week, Australia offered a few concessions and the social media giant said it would restore news as the revamped bill looked set to become law this week.Even though Facebook said its concerns had been met and opposition lawmakers warned that smaller media players may be overlooked, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said the bargaining power imbalance had been righted.""The changes the government's done are things that either don’t matter much or are just to clarify things that, at least in Facebook's mind, were unclear,"" Sims, who helped draft the original laws, told Reuters.""Whatever they say, they need news. It keeps people on their platform longer. They make more money,"" he said.The endorsement from Australia's top antitrust regulatorwill bolster the government's argument that its hardline approach worked and may offer encouragement to countries such as Canada and Britain which have said they plan similar laws.Other countries have introduced legislation forcing so-called Big Tech players to negotiate with media companies for licensing fees for links that draw traffic, and advertising revenue, to their platforms.However, Australia will be the first country where a government arbitrator effectively sets the rates tech giantswill have to pay if negotiations with media companies fail.The last-minute changes include an extra two-month mediationperiod between any failed talks and state intervention and give the government discretion to release Facebook from the processif it proves it has made a ""significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry"".Facebook's vice president of global news partnerships,Campbell Brown, said in a blog post that the changes confirmedthe U.S. company could decide which news, if any, appeared onits platform and that it could avoid forced arbitration.But Sims said Facebook was always free to stop offering news- and had also been free to cut deals to avoid intervention.""This isn't a must-carry regime,"" he said. ""We never said we’re forcing Facebook to keep showing news."""

STRAIGHT FROM BARRONS Facebook’s Earnings Could Be a Reset for the Stock. Why It Could Move Higher From Here. GOING TO 350.00
Bought another 500 shares earlier
"Disappointed in FB's pps the past few years. TWTR has tripled over that time while SNAP has gone up almost tenfold. True, those who have been in FB since the early days and have never sold are pleased. But those buying into FB at much higher prices must feel like there's a party happening on Wall Street but FB didn't get an invite. Hard to knock Zuck given what he's built over a dozen years or thereabouts, however I believe FB needs a new and more appealing face of the company than Zuck. He doesn't come off as very likeable (Don't underestimate the value of being likeable.), and his recent decisions (e.g. ideology specific censoring) have further hurt FB's image. To wit, time for him to step down."
Zuckerberg knows this is going up and who cares if he sold some shares but now hes buying back billions Hes helping his company

"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."

"$GOOG $WIMI $FB ""What's the biggest concern in the tech world right now? Holographic projection is definitely on the list. The technique was invented in 1947 by Hungarian-born British physicist Dennis Gabor, who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in physics for his work. The technique has been used in electron microscopy since its invention, in the field known as electron holographic projection, but holographic projection did not make substantial progress until the invention of the laser in 1960. This technology is now used in so-called secret technologies known as Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap.Holographic projection is a kind of display technology, it needs medium, and it has to be done in real time, and it can interact with people. We call it a ""holographic medium,"" and it can't be created out of thin air, which is why it's so hard to make the technology popular right now. A holographic projection projects an image onto a holographic medium, thereby rendering the 3D effect in front of people's eyes. Also known as virtual imaging, augmented reality (AR) is one of the most popular applications of this technology.Holography relies on holographic phantom technology and uses optical imaging principle to present three-dimensional images in space, so that viewers can have a strong 3D three-dimensional impression.When 3D holographic technology is integrated into the traditional stage drama, the technology expands the imagination of the director infinitely, and provides a space for the stage art to be fully released. It outputs the concept of spatial imaging and forms such a holographic stage full of science fiction elements.Holographic imaging system uses artificial intelligence, virtual interaction, augmented reality and other interdisciplinary integration, in order to achieve the most realistic holographic effect of science fiction, and achieve the integration of humanities, science and technology, tourism and other industries.Unlike VR and 3D videos, holographic stage productions do not require any wearable devices to be worn. Moreover, AR technology, motion capture technology and other ""stage black technology"" can be combined to create interactive performance experience. Through AR technology, the actors or audience are collected in real time to realize the holographic interactive works performed by real people, virtual people and real-time collected audience on the same stage."""

Complete free fall. No bottom

Tech is showing weakness
mark must leave
Seems like all the pro Trumpers boycotting FB failed to accomplish their mission to drive the stock price into the ground. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to buy in the 250s you all messed up by selling your shares. You stuck to your morals instead of making money. The opportunity cost was quite high and will only be higher when FB is back above 300. Thanks for your shares.
Finally a big scary selloff!!! We needed this $aapl $fb $jpm $googl to reset and refresh oh $tsla is gonna go to 300
"South Africa's information regulator says WhatsApp cannot share users' contact informationJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Facebook Inc cannot share any contact information it collects from WhatsApp users with its other properties without first obtaining authorisation from South Africa's Information Regulator (IR), the agency said on Wednesday.In January, the Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp informed users it was preparing a new privacy policy, under which it could share some data, including location and phone numbers, with Facebook and its other units such as Instagram and Messenger.The move has sparked backlash among users in South Africa and elsewhere, and prompted many to opt for rival services such as Signal or Telegram.""WhatsApp cannot without obtaining prior authorisation from the IR process any contact information of its users for a purpose other than the one for which the number was specifically intended at collection, with the aim of linking that information jointly with information processed by other Facebook companies,"" the regulator said.The regulator said its decision was in accordance with section 57 of the Protection of Personal Information Act, South Africa's data protection law.The regulator said that it has written to Facebook South Africa and outlined its concerns about the company's privacy policy.The regulator is also ""very concerned"" that citizens of the European Union will receive significantly higher privacy protection than people in South Africa and Africa generally.""Our legislation is very similar to that of the EU. It was based on that model deliberately, as it provides a significantly better model for the protection of personal information than that in other jurisdictions,"" Chairperson of the IR Pansy Tlakula said.""We do not understand why Facebook has adopted this differentiation between Europe and Africa.""Facebook South Africa was not immediately available for comment, while questions sent to Facebook were not immediately answered.The changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy have come under scrutiny globally, with Turkey's competition board launching an investigation and a legal challenge filed in India."
Put a buck on zuck. Go book
Buybacks! In a month it'll be $320

Thumbs up if FB can reach $300 after earnings!!!
as predicted. just not a good company these days loads of regulations and scrutiny. has done next to nothing over the past 6 weeks. long road ahead i'm afraid. have a sizable position but might be having to trim as tomorrow the market will also have issues.
"Just endless price target upgrades in the mid 300s.

Investors have yet to see one penny in dividends from a stock that has $10 in earnings.....Weird.
get this baby under 200 I didn't get enough... 100 shares at $172.45
I think this is historically one of the cheapest P/E ratios for FB. WhatsApp and other assets aren’t just going away. FB’s better days are not behind it.
Bye bye fb. Deleted.
It’s tough to hold down the cheapest large cap growth stock in the S&P 500 for long!*** FB will shine this year in a global economy will be booming into record historic growth!!!
OMG OMG OMG FB stock down BIG TIME after terrible earnings and guidance- GET OUT NOW LONGS!!!! SELL it all fast and cheap

"There’s about to be some BIG CHANGES coming down the pike for not only Twitter but $FB as well. These online platforms, along with others, have PROFITED off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of MISINFORMATION among Americans that has caused HATE AND DIVISION within our country. They’re platforms are being used as tools to organize MASS RIOTS all over the US. I’ve been against FB and Twitter from the very beginning. It was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be SHUTDOWN. There is very little, if anything, “social” about them."
Anyone really think that even this yahoo board will be around much longer ?
Road to 300

"All in all the whole of markets are over bloated especially with much liquidity in and in dangerous territories, over priced and no longer going on shares earnings per pricing fundamentals,most whole of markets are going on popularity favoritism based shares,most fund managers and people are not doing there DD or home work and keep advising people to keep investing in a over illed priced dangerous market, hence just waiting to collapse,there is signs of a terrible market crash on the looming horrizon.The trouble with those signs is that while they are very obvious with the benefit of hindsight, they aren’t so easy to see in real time.In 1929, JFK’s father Joseph Kennedy Sr. picked up on one of those subtle signs and didn’t just get out at the top, he scored a massive windfall on the way down as well,yes he was one of those few who did not loose all his money back in the devastating 1929`s horrible crash,how did he know you ask..by sitting in a shoe shine chair having his shoes shined ...and yes it was the shoe shine boys advise that made him think drastically,this all very simple sign most people do not care to believe in or digest,however has always been proven strongly true with time over time,once again it seems it will pronouce it`s coming more over soon."
"Watch these stocks closely....twitter, apple, amazon, facebook and google.

Do your research."

You will regret selling Facebook at a 27 P/E ratio. Extremely cheap here for a company that’s growing the top line.
"TWTR another 52 week high coming this week!! After Due Diligence on ACRX went long, ACRX 450% upside based on analyst reports... At least put ACRX on your watch list - hint ARMY, AIR FORCE, NAVY, COAST GUARD... Also buying $FB on this dip"
"Now we know what the people of CHINA have to deal with,,,CENSORSHIP!"
Social media has truely deviated from their origanl platform focus. Too bad. They could have been a great tool to help our country come together. All of them have done nothing but to help tear our great country to pieces. As history shows us time and again the U.S.A is in the final stages of losing its leading place on the world stage.
The World needs to show Suckerburg what it feels about Censorship!BURY this Company! Disclaimer: I no longer have a position in Facebook
These companies these companies are getting ready to take a big loss because of political leanings which is not what companies are supposed to do. can you imagine the shareholder class action lawsuits that are about to come? They will be massive.
Can you imagine FB with just liberals and Democrats in it? It would be the modern-day clan meeting...
After all conservatives leave just think they will follow us where ever we go

"I’ll wait and see what FB has to offer, IF it does show tendency to growth, I’ll wait for a strong pullback and Buy, if it does continue to show no growth potential, I’ll keep shorting"
By getting political instead of being a social media site not to mention communist they have defrauded their investors. time for class action by investors for lack of disclosure and sue Zuckerberg personally for this Madoff scam.
i see zero support here for fb
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx
There goes mark Zuckerberg.
Down $20 tomorrow

"This selloff is silly, but I'll take it. Facebook is a money-making machine. After its earnings report later this month, it should be trading up in the $280s and $290s again, if not $300."
I believe it will reach all time high again before earning on May 1st.

"Zuck might have stepped in quick sand by banning news from Australia. If he can ban Australia, the obvious response is for Australia to ban Facebook? Stock off almost $4 so far. Imagine what would happen if other countries band together in support of Australia and decide to block Facebook. Zuck may have dug himself a hole where escape is impossible. Don't even want to think about what would happen to the pps if anything close to that scenario occurred. It's one thing to ban an individual, but an entire country! Just underscores my long held position that Facebook needs a new face at its hem. Zuck doing way more harm than good lately."
"It’s very hard to hold FB with the lawsuits, the constant negative press, and the badmouthing by conservatives who think it’s got liberal minded censorship, which is actually far from the truth. The share price is also in horrible monthlong decline at the moment.. Despite all that, let’s look at the bottom line. They delivered $2.71 in the midst of pandemic, and show no signs of slowing down. Nothing has changed and they are in their strongest quarter historically with strong revenue from an extended presidential election and senate runoffs continuing. Oculus is now advertising, Instagram is firing on all cylinders, WhatsApp hasn’t even started to monetize, they are working on a new cryptocurrency, their marketplace is huge and gets no revenue yet, which is another potential Avenue for future incomes.They will easily report $3.50+ for the current quarter, bringing them to $10 EPS on the year...This means they are trading at under 27x earnings.. No other FAANG comes close to this value. This is a discounted price that won’t stay at these levels forever. Finance professionals will recognize the value, even with all the negative press, so look on this as a buying opportunity before they report the next quarter.Stay strong!"
Emmet says I am wrong about FAKEBOOK....well Emmet watch what is about to happen to FAKEBOOK...you all talk about the past I AM TALKING ABOUT THE PRESENT TO THE FUTURE and FAKEBOOK is not going to be the force it was -- this is GOING DOWN and you are going to see it all unfold before your rosy glasses.

Ok let's pump FB back to $320 just like GME and AMC. Diamond hands!
Target $300 by Friday 
FB 190 before Wednesday.
"I'll never figure out what makes a stock go up or go down. Over the years, FB has come out with good earnings and, for whatever reason, the pps retreated. Lately, FB has received precious little love from the MSM, yet we've rallied from the high $240s to the mid-$270s over the past two weeks. Go figure!Anyway, hope the rise continues. The pps will probably get another boost upwards early next week because everyone is expecting earnings to be good to great. I guess the key will be what happens in the post-market after Zuck completes the conference call. GLA. On our way to $300 again IMHO."

"Facebook news ban fears grow as tech giant fails to sign deals with Australia's big media playersTwo weeks after Facebook struck a deal with the Australian government to pay publishers for displaying their news content the social network has failed to sign a single big media player – sparking fears of a second news feed ban.Sources close to the negotiations say Facebook is either freezing them out or refusing to budge on key clauses, which could indicate the platform is getting cold feet and considering “pulling the plug” again.Facebook last month was globally condemned for “attempting to bully a democracy” when it stopped its 18 million Australian users from viewing or sharing news stories. But a longer crisis was averted when the government made last-minute amendments to its media code that Facebook was happy with.While Facebook has signed letters of intent with three smaller players and Seven West Media, which publishes two newspapers, it’s failed to come to an agreement with the three biggest employers of journalists: News Corp Australia, Nine Entertainment and the ABC.The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been encouraging publishers to push for a resolution."

This evil method seems to be what the wealthy want to hold everyone back. Entertainers, Hollywood, government leaders, and media all seem to thrive on when societies are fighting against each other."
"FB is a cash cow, when are they going to start paying a dividend!!! I want a dividend. They'll just keep growing, but the shareholders want a dividend."
People realized we beat right?
FB deletes conservative comments. And Free speech. They are against the United States constitution.
"Common sense and logic decide the price of the stock particularly FB. The company already sent the signal that the 4th quarter earnings will be better that normal, thanks to the election year, and Shopify's E-commerce. FB's revenue in Asia, is shining, average revenue per user increasing at the alarming rate, thanks to the E-commerce in the region. Instagram is the golden goose that keeps laying golden eggs. By chart, FB still has room to hit 300 this time around after missing twice this year. THE CHART DOES NOT LIE."
I agree. Smart money will get burned . 401K investors added FB in their plan. So hedgies will fight who cover first eventually. You buy and accumulate....that's the key to wipe out hedgies and steal their prey by buying low. Don't sell but buy at pullback. 300 break is coming

I see many on here don’t understand how stop losses work. I set the price I want to automatically sell to limit my losses when I’m not actively trading. I set mine at $200 so my share will sell at $200 when the market opens tomorrow.

"Facebook: ""Here is a free service you can use."" Australian media: ""You should pay us for this"". FB - great company. I'm in."
It seems like in the world of business & investing there are sharks and sheep. Zuck is most definitely a shark. Sheep are afraid of this company because he sometimes goes against the grain; sometimes Zuck goes into extremely deep waters. Some people don't realize or understand the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning that FB / GOOG / AMZN utilize to predict and understand the habits and motivations of billions of people on an daily/hourly/minute/second basis. You think they don't use those same types of algorithms to learn the behavior and predict what kind of new laws will be used against them in the future and work on finding solutions to those issues in advance? I think FB is misunderstood and people don't realize that Zuck is smarter than what some of his business decisions suggest. FB should be trading considerably closer to what google trades at; maybe there is a lot I am missing here?
The campaign trail starts tomorrow!! MAGA!!!!

"Australia won't change planned content laws despite Facebook blockSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will not change proposed laws that would make Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, despite vocal opposition from the Big Tech firms.Facebook has strongly protested the laws and last week abruptly blocked all news content and several state government and emergency department accounts. The social media giant and Australian leaders continued discussing the changes over the weekend.But with the bill scheduled for a debate in the Senate on Monday, Australia's most senior lawmaker in the upper house said there would be no further amendments.""The bill as it stands ... meets the right balance,"" Simon Birmingham, Australia's Minister for Finance, told Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio.The bill in its present form ensures ""Australian-generated news content by Australian-generated news organisations can and should be paid for and done so in a fair and legitimate way"".The laws would give the government the right to appoint an arbitrator to set content licencing fees if private negotiations fail."

"If you have spent anytime around children in the past year while they are on a device, you know about Roblox. And if you're a parent, you also know about Robux (Roblox currency) as your credit card may have gotten charged by purchases made in-game. All I could think about was 'revenue' and when is the IPO.Developers have been looking for a new platform to take their talents further and also have greater freedom while reaching an entire new and broader age group of gamers.Enter RBLX.Roblox reminds me of Fortnite and Minecraft in popularity & style.I believe Roblox will be even more successful than Fortnite & Minecraft though.Roblox is more than gaming, and similar to Fortnite, will take entertainment and social media to a new level that many can't grasp...especially if you're over the age of 40.Roblox is capturing majority of the 6 to 18 year olds, and in the next 5-10 years will continue holding onto these users. Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA. Combine these 3 companies, and I see $RBLX.I'm in at $64.50 and will hold this one for 10 years. Keep buying. Keep holding.I expect RBLX to be at $140+ within 6 months."

To all of me fellow republicans and Trumpers. We have to buy FB TWTR GOOG in order to control the narrative. We should not be sellers. Buy as much as you can so that as shareholders and eventually board members we can control the narrative just like the Dems are doing that to us. Don't be fooled by selling your shares cheap to these traitors. If we all buy these companies then we can control the narrative on social medial and only then we can censor them like they are doing that to us. Remember there are about 2.5 billion people and businesses on FB INSTGRAM WHATSAPP and MESSANGER. Even if a few million republicans delete their accounts it wouldn't make the slightest difference for FB. We must ban together and buy the shares in all of these social media and tech companies in order to control on how they are being run.
Buckle up!

"It’s all about market share value. If Facebook was as trusted a company as Apple, it would be trading in the range of $340/share, given the Apple PE. Similarly, if the market had as much faith in the Facebook growth strategy as it does in Amazon’s, Facebook would be trading near $750/share. As a major Facebook shareholder, I am angered by the discount at which Facebook trades, and highly frustrated with the persistent share price volatility. For me, the time has come for a change in the company management team; they’ve had nearly three years since the Cambridge-Analytica debacle to improve public opinion of the company and they haven’t succeeded. Shareholders will never achieve maximum market share value if the current management team remains in place. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have become too toxic for the business, and I’m calling on all shareholders to rally with me and demand their resignations. A new team will help us achieve maximum shareholder value and help stabilize the share price. Zuckerberg and Sandberg must go!"

"Let’s talk about CASH. Facebook closed out Q3, 2020 with over $55.5 billion in cash, or $19.5 per share. That’s a lot of cash and it seems appropriate to pay out some of that cash to shareholders in the form of a one-time dividend. Some might argue that doing so is foolish because Facebook is a “growth” company and needs the capital to expand the business; I would argue Facebook is priced as a “value” company by the market because of the pall of uncertainty that lingers over the company and the heightened scrutiny faced by the company. Given these constraints, it seems unlikely Facebook will be able to use the cash to make any significant purchases. 2021 is the year to maximize shareholder value; 2021 is the year to install a new management team."

"UK seeks G7 consensus on digital competition after Facebook blackoutLONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Britain is seeking to build a consensus among G7 nations on how to stop large technology companies exploiting their dominance, warning that there can be no repeat of Facebook's one-week media blackout in Australia.Facebook's row with the Australian government over payment for local news, although now resolved, has increased international focus on the power wielded by tech corporations.We will hold these companies to account and bridge the gap between what they say they do and what happens in practice,"" Britain's digital minister Oliver Dowden said on Friday.""We will prevent these firms from exploiting their dominance to the detriment of people and the businesses that rely on them.""Dowden said recent events had strengthened his view that digital markets did not currently function properly.""I put these concerns to Facebook and set out our interest in leveling the playing field to enable proper commercial relationships to be formed. We must avoid such nuclear options being taken again,"" Dowden said in a statement.Britain will host a meeting of G7 leaders in June.It is seeking to build consensus there for coordinated action toward ""promoting competitive, innovative digital markets while protecting the free speech and journalism that underpin our democracy and precious liberties,"" Dowden said.The G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada, but Australia has also been invited.Britain is working on a new competition regime aimed at giving consumers more control over their data, and introducing legislation that could regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of illegal or extremist content and bullying."

Once the Australian issue is forgotten in one or two weeks it will shoot up 285+ again. The world needs Facebook and all its other services. Imagine there would be no WhatsApp or Instagram.

"Facebook Faces Year of Reckoning After Showdown in Australia(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s brief but tempestuous standoff with the Australian government over a world-first pay-for-news law is only the start of a string of regulatory battles that the world’s biggest social network faces in 2021.Mark Zuckerberg started the year on the offensive, blocking news across Rupert Murdoch’s home turf of Australia to fend off demands that Facebook pay media companies for content shared on its platform.On Tuesday, Zuckerberg struck a compromise after 11th-hour talks with the government on the legislation that’s also aimed at Google and is expected to pass Australia’s parliament this week. But a regulatory domino effect is already underway, with publishers pressuring the European Union to emulate Australia’s approach.With the prospect of more assertive regulation and even Apple Inc. questioning Facebook’s longstanding model of using data to better target advertising, the social media platform’s way of doing business faces being upended.U.S. legislators are voicing the loudest concerns about Facebook, with Rhode Island Congressman and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline tweeting that the company “is not compatible with democracy.” Congress is holding hearings this week to consider tougher antitrust measures to rein in the powers of the company and other tech giants.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, meanwhile, said he’s discussed Facebook with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and the U.K.’s Boris Johnson, whose government plans to conduct antitrust probes into its operations.Facebook’s Australia Face-Off Could Backfire Across the GlobeFacebook has struggled to shake off deep-seated distrust since the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed failings in safeguarding personal data. It courted fresh controversy this January when WhatsApp’s privacy policy was updated to help it share more information with its parent, leading to several lawsuits and a flood of users joining rival messaging services Telegram and Signal.Facebook’s abrupt move to cut off news sharing in Australia -- jeopardizing credible sources of information about the coronavirus during a crucial time in vaccine rollout -- was widely criticized. But the high stakes gambit did help it wring some concessions from the government, which announced key amendments to the planned law on Tuesday. Crucially, Facebook and Google can decide what commercial deals to cut with news publishers, and will only face forced arbitration as a last resort.The “lesson for regulators and governments around the world is, Facebook is a formidable foe that’s willing to pull out the big guns to get what it wants,” former Facebook Australia and New Zealand Chief Executive Officer Stephen Scheeler said in a phone interview Wednesday. The Silicon Valley firm has the power “to essentially undermine a government position on a topic.”Among its other battles, the company has been hit with a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleging a “multi-year course of illegal conduct” and anticompetitive behavior. An unfavorable ruling in that case could ultimately force Facebook to sell off Instagram.And Zuckerberg, along with the leaders of Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc., will be answering U.S. legislators’ questions in March about the spread of misinformation online and the responsibility of platforms to curtail it."

"Microsoft says U.S. should copy Australian law targeting Google and Facebook over news contentMicrosoft likes Australia’s plan to make Google and Facebook pay local publishers for content included in search results or news feeds so much that the company thinks the U.S. should adopt similar thinking.“The United States should not object to a creative Australian proposal that strengthens democracy by requiring tech companies to support a free press. It should copy it instead,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.Microsoft waded into the dispute down under earlier this month, when Google threatened to block its search engine in Australia over the proposed law, or “news media bargaining code,” as it’s called. Smith said at the time that Microsoft would never make such a threat.Facebook has also warned that it would consider blocking Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law passes.Smith used the occasion in his post to dive deeper on threats to democracy and journalism and the erosion of traditional news sources at the hands of the internet and social media. Microsoft also touted its MSN licensing agreements with 1,200 publishers worldwide, generating $1 billion in revenue for those publishers since 2014.“The legislation will redress the economic imbalance between technology and journalism by mandating negotiations between these tech gatekeepers and independent news organizations,” Smith said. “The goal is to provide the news organizations with compensation for the benefit derived by tech gatekeepers from the inclusion of news content on their platforms.”"

"Facebook will hit anywhere from 208.22 to 225.86 after earnings.. as long as the earnings are spectacular and zucky doesn't add any hot pepper afterward. I did a long term study on facebook movement, this stock usually go up anywhere from 18% to 28% after it found its bottom. Facebook found its bottom around 176.46 176.46 ( 18% to 28% upside ) puts facebook price in this range $208.22 to $225.86Keep in mind that if zuckerberg do decide to released the blockbuster mystery news, Facebook stock price could go much higher than $225.86Remember the 2015 bloodbath plunge during late december ? This bloodbath plunge is very similar to what we recently went thru.FB from 104.66 plummeted to 94.97 ( a disaster 9% plunge ) ... if you bought 94.97 ( u made 18% afterward )The price went back up after it bottomed out at 94.97.. from 94.97 skyrocketed to 112.21 ( u made 18% on gloom and doom)How much gloom and doom are u hearing now in Jan 2018 ?? ignore the b.s and load up on FBIf you want to calculate FACEBOOK recent bottom at 176.46 ( 18% ) means Facebook will hit $208.22(28% ) means Facebook will hit $225.86 180.00 this is the price FB spends the most..( 18% ) puts FB at $212.40( 28% ) puts FB at $230.40Remember the Final Outcome after Jan 31, 2018 really depends what Zuckerberg got to offer and what he's going to sayIf everything is good .. you should see the price above"

Zuck, whether he realizes it or not, doesn't come off as a real likeable guy. Toss in the recent censorship decision, and we can add ""cause"" to championing his demotion."

"These fund managers on CNBC are angry that people on reddit are having more of an effect on the market than they do. They tell each other what is beneficial to their own fund as managed by themselves while making the retail investor think there is some magic to what they are doing, and there is none. So the people on reddit get together and bypass the so-called magic. So these fund managers are afraid they will become obsolete and lose the fees they use to rape the retail investor. Meanwhile desperate ""wealth managers"" try their hand at scaring the little guy out of taking their lack of transparency away by posting about how the SEC is going to come and get you for buying into a stock."

The advertisements and inability to see news is the ""cost"" that non-subscribers pay to be able to access their platform.

Australian government sounds like the real bully here. FB should do better job of letting the people of Australia understand the ramifications of what their government is trying to do. FB should be letting the Australian people know that due to new laws going into effect are causing FB to remove news information from its platform."

While the management team has worked hard to regain credibility and to burnish the firm’s reputation since the C-A debacle, they have failed. It is time to go! To wit, shareholders have experienced unprecedented stock price volatility and exorbitant penalties over the past three years ; and this price instability will NEVER subside until a new management team is installed. I am hoping other Facebook shareholders will join me in demanding a restructuring of the management team to restore the firm’s market credibility."

It's time to delete Facebook once forever.
"The Biggest Threat to Facebook Isn’t Apple, It’s Mark ZuckerbergThe CEO told analysts that Apple is one of its biggest competitors. That misses the point. During Facebook's earnings call, the company's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, made a point of talking about the risk Apple's upcoming iOS 14 changes pose to its business. Those changes will require apps to ask permission before they are able to track users across apps and the internet.For Facebook, a company whose entire business model is built on the ability to track users, collect their data, and then sell targeted ads based on all of that information, losing the ability to track users could be a real problem. The thing is, Apple isn't stopping any app from tracking any user. It's only requiring that apps ask permission first. The only way an app won't be able to track a user is if that user says ""please don't track me.""That seems pretty reasonable. If people don't want to be tracked online, it seems reasonable that apps shouldn't track them. Apple is just adding transparency to that interaction and allowing users the choice.Clearly, Facebook doesn't see it that way.“We increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors,"" Zuckerberg told analysts. ""Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do. They say they are doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests.""There is so much that we could unpack in that statement, but I want to highlight a couple of things. First, Zuckerberg is right, Apple is a competitor, but not in the way it thinks. Apple has a messaging product, but it isn't monetized. Apple doesn't show ads in Messages.Second, if Apple's goal is giving users a choice over how their data is used, what difference does the incentive make. If Apple is advantaged by respecting people's privacy and giving them a choice over whether and how their data is collected, I'm not sure that's quite the burn you think it is.Finally, It's hard to know how many different ways to say it, but if your business model is threatened by the idea that people will be given a choice as to whether you can track them, your problem isn't Apple. Your problem is your business model.For that matter, personalized advertising, which is just Facebook's nicer way of describing ads targeted based on your browsing history and activity, isn't a necessity for small businesses. Small businesses existed long before there was a massive social platform willing to take their money to show ads to its users.Sure, Facebook's version of advertising is more efficient, and maybe even more effective. But, even with Apple's proposed change, Facebook will still know where you live, how old you are, what your interests are because you tell it all of those things. For most small businesses, being able to target 25 to 30-year-old women that live within 20 miles of your salon isn't going to change.I'm also not so sure Facebook is actually worried about this particular change. The segment of its ad business that will be directly affected is quite small in comparison to its overall business. The real problem is that now everyone will be given a choice about whether to let Facebook track them, and the company logically assumes that most people will opt-out.And even if that doesn't have an immediate effect on its business, it does affect its brand. Suddenly people will be confronted with the reality that Facebook isn't free at all--it's just that most people weren't aware of the cost.Now they'll see a little popup that tells them that the cost is their personal information. Instead of facing that reality and making changes, Facebook has doubled down on the narrative that Apple is actually the bad guy here.That's why the biggest problem facing Facebook isn't Apple, it's Mark Zuckerberg.The smart move for Zuckerberg and Facebook would be to start with the idea that privacy is the given. If you can't build something that protects that, don't build it. I don't mean build things and then try to find a way to say it protects privacy, that's starting in the wrong position with the wrong motivation. It's why people don't trust Facebook.By the way, Zuckerberg isn't alone. Companies are full of leaders that can't see beyond the picture they have in their own mind of their good intentions.That's dangerous because it means they can't see the problems that everyone else sees. And that means they won't ever lead the way to a solution. You can't lead people where you aren't able to go. That's true for all of us."

As a shareholder, I am calling on Zuckerberg and Sandberg to resign from their positions; a time for fresh leadership of this company is long overdue. Until change happens, the massive volatility associated with this stock price will never cease, and the company will continue to be disrespected."
"Facebook Knowingly Profited Off Junk Ad Efficacy Estimates, Lawsuit ClaimsFacebook, which along with Google accounts for around 60% of advertiser spending online, has knowingly built some of its astonishing success on incorrect data, newly unsealed court documents allege. Incidentally, this may pose a problem for a business which generates over 90% of its revenue from selling ads. In a nutshell, this class action suit, which was first filed back in 2018, alleges that Facebook massaged figures for “Potential Reach”—an estimate that Facebook gives its advertisers for the number of people that might see their ad—to goad advertisers into spending more money on the platform, all in the hopes of reaching the people that Facebook had promised. These filings detail that some of Facebook’s top brass, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, were fully aware that the company spent years exaggerating the number of eyeballs its advertisers could reach. As first reported by the Financial Times, the suit claims that when Facebook’s rank-and-file proposed internal fixes for these inflated figures, senior executives repeatedly brushed them off on the grounds that their solutions would cut into the company’s all-important ad revenue.Thanks to these unsealed filings, we know just how inflated some of those figures were. Here’s an example: in 2018, Facebook told its advertisers that it had a Potential Reach of 230 million adults across the U.S., out of the 250 million adults that were counted by U.S. census data that year. But according to a 2018 Pew Research study, only about 68% (or 170 million adults) actually use the platform at all. Sandberg acknowledged in an internal email that “she’d known about problems with Potential Reach for years.” But she repeatedly shot down employee’s attempts to rectify those figures, according to the filing.Internally, employees acknowledged that while the product billsitself as an estimate for how many “people” your ad might reach, it is, at best, an estimate for the number of accounts—including the untold numbers of fakes and duplicates. Some employees even ran the numbers in 2018, just to see what would happen if known duplicate accounts were cut out of Potential Reach, and saw a 10% drop in the numbers advertisers were given. Facebook chose not to cut them. When one of the product managers on the Potential Reach team later suggested tweaking the way they talked about these figures—like, say, replacing the word “people” with the word “accounts”—his suggestion was shot down over worries about the “significant” impact it might have on Facebook’s ad revenue. Per the suit, the manager responded that “it’s revenue we should have never made given the fact it’s based on wrong data.”In a lot of ways, this case mirrors another high-profile advertiser suit that hit the company in 2016 alleging Facebook knowingly withheld some serious problems with the metrics for its video ads for the sake of pulling down more money from those video ad partners. In 2019, Facebook settled the claim for a $40 million dollar sum that, as others have pointed out, is pretty much chump change to a company that earns tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue per year.And apparently, Facebook didn’t learn much from that slap on the wrist. When it comes to the ongoing problems with Potential Reach, the suit points out that numbers Facebook continues to give its advertisers make even less sense, like telling them it can reach “100 million” 18-to-34 year old’s across the country. Census data shows there’s in fact only 76 million of them—and we know not all of them use Facebook."

"Apple Privacy Change May Cost Facebook, Google $25 Billion Over Next 12 MonthsGoogle could lose $17 billion in revenue over the next 12 months. Facebook has perhaps $8 billion at risk. The cause, according to mobile marketing professionals? Apple’s new privacy changes. Last year Apple announced that the Identifier For Advertisers (IDFA) would become explicitly opt-in in its next mobile operating system update, iOS 14. The IDFA helps advertisers measure ad effectiveness as well as track devices and people. In September, Apple delayed execution of that change until early 2021. But the change is coming, and most in the industry think it’s coming soon.What that means is greater user privacy.And what that means for Facebook and Google is impaired advertising efficiency. Unless huge numbers of consumers opt in to tracking, ads will no longer be as personalizable to our unique history, interests, and activity as they could in the past.In fact, Facebook itself estimated personalization accounts for 50% of the value of its advertising.Now mobile advertising expert Eric Seufert, who formerly led user acquisition for Angry Birds and other apps, has estimated the privacy cost of Apple’s change. He estimates some people will opt in to tracking: likely around 20%. (Facebook has stated it will ask for permission to track; Google has not yet revealed how it will proceed.) For the other 80% of people, however, advertising will lose some of the efficiency that personalization has delivered. Facebook and Google can recover some efficiency by better contextual targeting, he says, but not all of it.(Personalized targeting picks ads to show you based on your history and activity; contextual targeting selects ads based on on the content and focus of the app or website which you are using.)“I believe that Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes will significantly harm Facebook’s revenue, causing a roughly 7% revenue impairment in Q2 2021 in the base case scenario,” Seufert writes. “Subsequent quarters will also face revenue losses.”"

"Facebook's renamed cryptocurrency Diem is still 'wolf in sheep's clothing': German Finance MinisterBERLIN (Reuters) - It will take more than renaming Facebook’s cryptocurrency to address the concerns regulators have about authorising its launch in Germany and Europe, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Monday.In a statement after a video conference of G7 finance ministers at which cryptocurrencies were discussed, Scholz said that relaunching Libra under its new name of Diem was only a cosmetic change.“A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf,” he said. “It is clear to me that Germany and Europe cannot and will not accept its entry into the market while the regulatory risks are not adequately addressed.”He added: “We must do everything possible to make sure the currency monopoly remains in the hands of states.”"

FB can pays for news feeds and simply increase add prices to make up the cost. Revenues will keep rising. The entire issue is overblown as it always becomes where FB is involved. You dont hear as much about Google's involvement yet they are in the same situation. FB is always being bashed while other companies fly under the radar and aren't targeted like FB. We need good news like a dividend or share split to really boost share price.

"Facebook Cuts Off News in Australia in Fight Over Payments(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. has started restricting the sharing of news on its service in Australia, defying a controversial proposed law that would require technology companies to pay publishers when their articles are posted by users.The ban constitutes the strongest action yet in response to the proposed legislation, which would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay publishers for the value their articles generate on the digital platforms. News outlets have demanded such payments, arguing they should be fairly compensated for their journalism as Google and Facebook capture much of the advertising market.Facebook’s decision blocks those in Australia from sharing news stories and stops users globally from sharing articles from Australian publishers. The action threatens to cut off one of the most widely used ways for people to access news and information online.It’s possible that Australia’s proposed law could set a precedent with other countries around the world that have watched Facebook and Google impact their respective news industries. While they oppose the measure in Australia, Google and Facebook have struck separate, voluntary agreements to pay publishers. Earlier Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., a supporter of the Australian proposal, said it had reached a deal with Google for the search giant to pay for journalism from the Wall Street Journal and its other newspapers.Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s Treasurer, tweeted that he had a “constructive discussion” with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday morning Australia time. “He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,” he wrote. A Facebook spokeswoman didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.Last summer, Facebook had threatened to block people and publishers in Australia from sharing news on its main social network and Instagram if the legislation were to become law. Google has similarly threatened to shut its search engine in Australia."

"Well, today is the day we find out whether or not Zuck's $500 million campaign contribution to the Dem senator candidates In Georgia pay off. If so, FB will have its back scratched by those who benefitted and probably not have to worry about Section 230 being rescinded any time soon. Down side of Zuck's side winning today is he'll have ticked off half the country. I, for one, wish Zuck would go hide out in FB's technology lab and not come out until he's a mature adult. JMHO, but were it not for Zuck's mouth, FB would be the darling of WS and selling for close to $400 per share."

"Does anybody remember the Ad Boycott?Time flies, and in the current era in which attention is the new currency, people forget easily. So I ask, does anybody remember the Ad Boycott? It was a little over half a year ago, yet it feels like ages ago. Too many events and ""breaking news"" have occurred since, and everyone has forgotten about it. Yet, it serves as a great reminder of why Facebook is an unstoppable train that you should not bet against.In June, investors feared that thousands of Facebook's biggest advertisers leaving the platform would hurt its top and bottom line. In the three months following June, i.e., Q3, Facebook went on to deliver a spectacular quarter, posting all-time high revenues and net income of $21.4B and $7.8B, respectively. Facebook doesn't need the big advertisers. The company had more than 1.8 billion people (and growing) scrolling through its apps on a daily basis at the end of Q3. It has all the attention in the world. The truth is that big advertisers need Facebook. Especially when there are thousands of smaller brands spending massively on social media platforms, threatening to capture market share from the bigger players."

"I’ve held FB since 2012 and it’s been very good to me financially speaking. However, it now appears to be the perfect time to find a better investment without controversy. The coordination between FB, Apple and AWS is a direct attack on free speech. The constitution was constructed to protect us from the government violating the rights written into the document. They had no idea private businesses would one day become larger and more powerful than the government. This is exactly what has happened with big tech companies.
