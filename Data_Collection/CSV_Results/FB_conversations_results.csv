"Facebook, Instagram and YouTube become the platforms for drug dealers Accounts peddling steroids, opioids and other drugs remain easy to find on major social networks. A new report published today by the Digital Citizens Alliance, a consumer watchdog group, and Coalition for a Safer Web details how Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and YouTube videos are promoting drug sales, in some instances to thousands of followers or viewers. The Digital Citizens Alliance, researchers and other advocacy groups have warned the tech companies of such sales for several years, and they say the persistent appearance of such posts raises questions about social media companies fostering apparent criminal activity. “If we can find it, they can find it. That begs the question how hard they're looking,” Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin said in an interview. The researchers also uncovered that similar accounts were peddling what they claimed to be coronavirus vaccines or testing kits. Law enforcement has said it would be fraudulent for individuals to sell vaccines, which are being distributed in authorized medical centers – and the report's authors raised concerns that potentially fake vaccines or test kits could give people a false sense of security about their protection from the virus. Facebook, Twitter, Google and others have been particularly aggressive in promising to stamp out content taking advantage of the public health crisis, and the findings raise questions about the enforcement of these policies.“The platforms continue to treat this as a PR problem instead of an Internet safety issue,” Galvin said. “When we put out things, they take them down and say all is fixed. But it's whack-a-mole, and they're up again the next week.”"
"$FUBO is all about ad revenue. This is a much higher profit margin than betting. Gandler is a smart guy. Sell tv channels at a small loss, grow customers, betting just for getting people more engagement, earn on ad revenue. This is the same playbook as $ROKU and $FB"

"Australia won't change planned content laws despite Facebook blockSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will not change proposed laws that would make Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, despite vocal opposition from the Big Tech firms.Facebook has strongly protested the laws and last week abruptly blocked all news content and several state government and emergency department accounts. The social media giant and Australian leaders continued discussing the changes over the weekend.But with the bill scheduled for a debate in the Senate on Monday, Australia's most senior lawmaker in the upper house said there would be no further amendments.""The bill as it stands ... meets the right balance,"" Simon Birmingham, Australia's Minister for Finance, told Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio.The bill in its present form ensures ""Australian-generated news content by Australian-generated news organisations can and should be paid for and done so in a fair and legitimate way"".The laws would give the government the right to appoint an arbitrator to set content licencing fees if private negotiations fail."
"FaceBook - Easy ProfitI’m going to state small points and you guys can research your own data to determine your move.1. Most work places ban Facebook from their computers because it’s very popular in the older generation. (My parents, uncles, aunts)2. Most Americans at the moment are working from home or not working and at home. 3. Facebook owns Instagram, WhatsApp and other companies. All companies based on apps or websites. 4. Facebook’s main advertisements are online shopping or online games etc... also we’ve all experienced the AI who advertises our recent views that we didn’t purchase in our face.5. Unlike Netflix, Facebook gets profit from users per add. Netflix is 1 time per month. Once a User pays there’s no more profit other then the subscribers. 6. Facebook stock fell when they announced they would spend lots of $$ in development of AI meaning less workers. 7. Q4 of 2019 which profits don’t include time spent in quarantine had the stock at $223. The stock currently is at $184.8. If you want proof checkout Snapchat after they announced their earnings (30% increase). Now go on your iPhone and Samsung and see how much time you’ve spent on Facebook & Instagram compared to before quarantine. ... double? Triple? 9. Facebook announced 10 000 new jobs... companies don’t do this if they don’t make more money. Common sense. 10. search how adds work for facebooks If someone bids 3$ and the second bid is 2.29. The winner pays $2.3 (1 penny more). That being said if an airline pulls back all its ads, the ads will be replaced by the second bidder. 1 cents less only per add. It’s lots of money in the big picture but not as bad as it looks. Big picture Now: my bet is that the users will outrun the losses in adds. Also go on Facebook and Instagram... did you notice the change in adds?? People are always looking to make money meaning they will always advertise something somewhere. I’ve been getting bombarded with amazon startups/training on Facebook. Every 3 pictures on my Instagram has an add. Q2 will still have much better earnings then expected. It’ll show slow money early April only to get strong by the end of Q2. Lastly, if you’re investing say $xxxx or more why not be smart. Do what I did, create a fake add for nothing. Enter it into bidding and see where the price falls. I won’t share that number, but try it yourself. It won’t cost more then a fraction of your total investment.I estimate $220-$240 after earnings post."
"UK seeks G7 consensus on digital competition after Facebook blackoutLONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Britain is seeking to build a consensus among G7 nations on how to stop large technology companies exploiting their dominance, warning that there can be no repeat of Facebook's one-week media blackout in Australia.Facebook's row with the Australian government over payment for local news, although now resolved, has increased international focus on the power wielded by tech corporations.We will hold these companies to account and bridge the gap between what they say they do and what happens in practice,"" Britain's digital minister Oliver Dowden said on Friday.""We will prevent these firms from exploiting their dominance to the detriment of people and the businesses that rely on them.""Dowden said recent events had strengthened his view that digital markets did not currently function properly.""I put these concerns to Facebook and set out our interest in leveling the playing field to enable proper commercial relationships to be formed. We must avoid such nuclear options being taken again,"" Dowden said in a statement.Britain will host a meeting of G7 leaders in June.It is seeking to build consensus there for coordinated action toward ""promoting competitive, innovative digital markets while protecting the free speech and journalism that underpin our democracy and precious liberties,"" Dowden said.The G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada, but Australia has also been invited.Britain is working on a new competition regime aimed at giving consumers more control over their data, and introducing legislation that could regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of illegal or extremist content and bullying."

"My dating years ended almost 50 years ago when I walked up the aisle and said, ""I do."". Thus, am not familiar with the likes of E-Harmony and other online dating services. They've been around for a while. Their ads still appear on TV. So I assume they must be making money. I know people who have used one or more of the sites, and I believe the cost to do so isn't cheap. So I now assume that FB can offer the same service only we have one big selling point in our favor. FB is FREE!"

"FB ought to change its ticker symbol to YoYo. Here we go again. Up nicely yesterday and then, poof, red at the end. Up over $4 in pre-market. have no idea what type of catalyst we need to propel the pps higher. 4Q 2020 numbers were great. Hey, our numbers are great 95% of the time. Yet, here we are languishing about 60 points off the 52-week high? Go figure."
This stock is the bane of my existence as an options trader. We're now trading at the post-earnings point... after a full month. It seems increasingly unlikely that FB will rebound significantly until something positive comes out of Q3 or even Q4.
Toxic.. to the 10th power.
Not to worry longs.......Zuck is coming to the rescue
The only way liberals win is to cheat.
"FB Q1 Earnings release in about 45 minutes, and you’ll see we the stock take off like a Space-X rocket"
It seems like in the world of business & investing there are sharks and sheep. Zuck is most definitely a shark. Sheep are afraid of this company because he sometimes goes against the grain; sometimes Zuck goes into extremely deep waters. Some people don't realize or understand the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning that FB / GOOG / AMZN utilize to predict and understand the habits and motivations of billions of people on an daily/hourly/minute/second basis. You think they don't use those same types of algorithms to learn the behavior and predict what kind of new laws will be used against them in the future and work on finding solutions to those issues in advance? I think FB is misunderstood and people don't realize that Zuck is smarter than what some of his business decisions suggest. FB should be trading considerably closer to what google trades at; maybe there is a lot I am missing here?
is this a jokeonly 5% up witha quarterly result like that?really this is incrediblethis should be $340 easy

Well at least this weak story broke on Saturday
Investors have yet to see one penny in dividends from a stock that has $10 in earnings.....Weird.
People en masse are getting on SIGNAL and TELEGRAM and deleting WHATSAPP.....this is another huge loss for FAKEBOOK....and as I noted the rest will come to pass as I always am able to see what will unfold in these situations....FAKEBOOK is DONE....the stock is going to get its lights blown out next week with massive selling. If you are not out now....it is almost too late as the door OUT is not wide enough for all the sellers I see going OUT THE DOOR. Boolean
Anyone know why this stock is performing so well today?
Me when I hear people say FB is not a good stock.
Remember....when the stock continues to go lower and you're losing money.....it's a gift. LOL

"Civil groups want EU lawmakers to boost privacy rights in planned WhatsApp, Skype rulesBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amnesty International, Privacy International and 28 other civil and human rights groups on Wednesday urged EU lawmakers to take a strong stand on privacy rights in proposed rules governing Facebook's WhatsApp and Microsoft's Skype.The call by the group in a letter to the European Parliament, whose members are spread out across Europe, is in response to what they said are attempts by EU countries to weaken privacy rights.EU countries in February agreed to a joint position in forthcoming negotiations with EU lawmakers and the European Commission on an ePrivacy Regulation that would subject WhatsApp and Skype to the same rules as telecoms providers and restrict the tracking of users in order to provide personalised ads.The regulation, proposed by the Commission in 2017, has run into various hurdles, with EU countries disagreeing on rules for cookies, consent requirements and provisions on detecting and deleting child pornography.The civil groups said EU countries had removed or weakened some clauses that would protect internet users from tracking and monitoring whether by cookies or other technological means or ban tracking or cookie walls from the negotiations. These clauses had been proposed by EU lawmakers as a basis for the talks.EU lawmakers should restore these clauses because privacy has become a paramount issue during the COVID-19 pandemic as people move online for everyday activities and exchanges, the group said.""We have the opportunity to create an internet that better serves users by stopping built-in data harvesting and tracing methods,"" Eva Simon, senior advocacy officer at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties), said in a statement.""It's important that the European Parliament realises it can stand up for people, and not defend the interests of the big tech platforms."""

"All I can say is “Face Ripping Rally”. Or shall I say “ Facebook Ripping Rally”. Be careful in here now, we need to consolidate a bit to eventually move higher. $325.00 is reasonable but probably not until around earnings. Expectations are high, and if we disappoint, we could trade lower until Q3"

"‘The Social Dilemma’ Filmmakers Say Social Media Companies Have “Polluted” Our “Information Ecosystem”Director of the award-winning Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, used to be an avid social media user. Not anymore.Around 2017, he says, he started becoming alarmed about “manipulative design techniques” employed by social media companies, and with his documentary collaborators he set out to illustrate the ways social media platforms have harmed society. “We just knew there was something really important here,” Jeff Orlowski explained during an appearance at Deadline’s Contenders Television: Documentary + Unscripted awards-season event.The Social Dilemma zeroes in on the algorithms created by Facebook, Google, Twitter and other such companies, which push content at users to keep them glued to their platforms. One effective way to engage people, these companies discovered, is to feed users a diet of conspiracy theories, misinformation and other material that stokes outrage. It’s good for the platforms, because the more people they reach and retain, the more ads they can sell, but the effects have been demonstrably bad for democracy, social relations and even mental health of users.“They figured out how to reverse engineer each and every one of us,” Orlowski said. “They did that really, really well and it’s been extremely profitable for them. … It turns out that those things, those rabbit holes that we end up falling into, can often be polarizing.”No two people are being fed the same stories and content. The algorithms customize an individual’s feed based on previous searches, “likes,” content engagement, etc. Social media users can become mired in a feedback loop of material that reinforces their preconceived ideas or exposes them to more radical content.“Our information ecosystem is not only polluted in some way, shape or form but is also distinct and different for every single person,” said producer Larissa Rhodes. She cited the example of entering the search term “climate change,” which produces different results for different people, and also varies depending on where the search is being executed.“Performing that search you see in Denmark it’s ‘A wicked problem,’ in China ‘It’s real,’ in Texas ‘It’s a hoax,’” Rhodes said. “I think that really helps us understand and empathize with where our society is at, recognizing that everybody is seeing a different set of information.”Orlowski was asked what he would say to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he could interview him. He pondered for a while, then answered, “I guess, in its simplest form, if he still thinks it’s all worth it…Is he still convinced himself that this Frankenstein’s monster is still something that he loves and admires?”"

"All these Trump supporters on here telling you to boycott FB don’t realize there aren’t any good alternatives. You can go to Instagram, which is owned by FB, you can go to Twitter, which did the same thing to Trump FB did. Or you can boycott social media altogether and live in the Stone Age. TINA. There is no alternative, no good one anyway. For the millions who leave FB, millions more will replace them. You can deactivate your account, but doing without messenger is a lot more complicated. I expect another round of thumbs down and bashing, but the simple fact is the bears haven’t given me a decent alternative. That’s why I’m long social media. Morally it may not entirely make sense, but from a money making standpoint it’s a no brainer."

"State, federal antitrust lawsuits likely to challenge Facebook for buying rivals and weaponizing dataState and federal investigators are preparing to bring antitrust charges against Facebook that will challenge the tech giant’s acquisition of two rivals, Instagram and WhatsApp, alleging that the deals helped create an anti-competitive social networking juggernaut that has left users with few quality alternatives.The charges form a critical part of what could be a wide-ranging legal salvo, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, ultimately threatening to saddle Facebook with its toughest regulatory challenge in its nearly 17-year history.As the state and federal probes enter their final phases, investigators have explored how Instagram and WhatsApp changed in the years after Facebook purchased them, according to the three people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law enforcement proceeding. Government antitrust watchdogs have weighed whether to contend in lawsuits that these transactions have left users with worse services — and fewer privacy protections — than they might have had if the companies had remained independent, the sources said.With the text-messaging service WhatsApp, in particular, Facebook had promised users that it would preserve the messaging company’s independence and strong privacy protections when it was purchased in 2014. It made the same commitment to regulators, who then gave a greenlight to the deal. But Facebook reversed course years later and has sought to integrate its users’ data with the social networking site’s other services, a controversial move that has raised fresh concerns given the tech giant’s past privacy mishaps.Investigators also have eyed the way in which Facebook manages its vast trove of user data, and the policies it has in place that govern when and how third-party app developers and other companies can access it — setting up the potential, the three sources said, for forthcoming state and federal complaints to contend that Facebook weaponized its most valuable assets as a way to stamp out emerging rivals.Each of the sources acknowledged that any state and federal lawsuits have not been finalized, meaning that investigators could still alter their thinking, potentially to maximize their potency in court. Nor are these the only issues that government officials have explored as part of their wide-ranging Facebook probes, the three people familiar with the matter said."

"Today's FED move in my view appears to be very positive for FB and Apple inclusive of the NASDAQ & S&P. Positive earnings and guidance should prove to add to FB today, the question continues to remain whether FB has the potential to post its first-ever double-digit gains after it reports. The good thing is I post the question today and investors will soon find out within less than an hour from now.The FB and Apple dueling opposing views in their service technologies too is another major question in today's event that may present headlining news to the press for the next couple of days from these two companies from either side.Today may well be known as the ""FB vs Apple earnings event"". Reminds me of Google vs Bing and HD vs Blueray which may cause a transfer of money if one of the two appears defeated or gains an upper hand during their calls."

Oh mama... nice earnings. Bought FB during the initial IPO back in 2012... sold about a year later.. I figured it would go the way of Myspace. Sure wish i had those shares back:(
FB is still making tons of cash and a relatively low PE compared to others. $335 will be reached this year and $400 by end of 2022. Patience in investing.
FB removed 1.3B fake accounts out of 2.8B.. Is FB not the plateforme we think they were. Ad revenue will take a hit...

"I remember a time when republicans and so-called conservatives applauded the independence of businesses and freedom from government regulation and interference. So, it?s sweet irony to watch their hypocrisy on full display as these same people call for government regulation of FB and Twitter and others that have banned this criminal from their platforms. I remember just last year when BLM protests raged, those same people touted their ?law and order? party platform. Now they?re angry that this coup-fomenting one term loser with blood on his hands is made to face consequences for his assault on our nation. They?re as shameless as they are dishonest as they are delusional. If you?re a rational centrist or true conservative reading this message, you know that the only path forward is to never vote GOP again, lest you wake up one morning in #$%$ America. FB had no choice but to keep that cancer banned."

"If you have spent anytime around children in the past year while they are on a device, you know about Roblox. And if you're a parent, you also know about Robux (Roblox currency) as your credit card may have gotten charged by purchases made in-game. All I could think about was 'revenue' and when is the IPO.Developers have been looking for a new platform to take their talents further and also have greater freedom while reaching an entire new and broader age group of gamers.Enter RBLX.Roblox reminds me of Fortnite and Minecraft in popularity & style.I believe Roblox will be even more successful than Fortnite & Minecraft though.Roblox is more than gaming, and similar to Fortnite, will take entertainment and social media to a new level that many can't grasp...especially if you're over the age of 40.Roblox is capturing majority of the 6 to 18 year olds, and in the next 5-10 years will continue holding onto these users. Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA. Combine these 3 companies, and I see $RBLX.I'm in at $64.50 and will hold this one for 10 years. Keep buying. Keep holding.I expect RBLX to be at $140+ within 6 months."

"Facebook removes over 16,000 groups trading fake reviewsFacebook with reputation for profiting from fraudsters has removed more than 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after the UK’s competition regulator criticised the company for failing to make good on a previous promise to clamp down on the practice.In January 2020, the Competition and Markets Authority secured an agreement from Facebook to “better identify, investigate and remove groups and other pages where fake and misleading reviews were being traded, and prevent them from reappearing”.The practice, in which unscrupulous traders buy fake positive reviews on e-commerce sites to boost sales – or hit competitors with fraudulent negative reviews – was frequently co-ordinated on Facebook and Instagram, the CMA found.But while Facebook agreed to act, a follow-up investigation “found evidence that the illegal trade in fake reviews was still taking place”, the CMA said, and it was forced to intervene for a second time.“Facebook has a duty to do all it can to stop the trading of such content on its platforms,” said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. “After we intervened again, the company made significant changes – but it is disappointing it has taken them over a year to fix these issues.“We will continue to keep a close eye on Facebook, including its Instagram business. Should we find it is failing to honour its commitments, we will not hesitate to take further action.”The scourge of fake reviews has spread across much of the internet. In October 2018, an investigation by Which? found that Facebook “factories” were producing the reviews, which were then almost entirely posted on Amazon. The e-commerce site would prioritise reviews from “genuine” buyers, who were then reimbursed for their trouble by the scammers on Facebook. The expensive “genuine” reviews were then backed up by tens of thousands of unverified positive reviews.Another investigation looked at products on Amazon and found that 71% of headphones had perfect five-star ratings – but that the text of the reviews often referred to unrelated products such as soap dispensers. One set of headphones made by the brand Celebrat had 439 reviews. All were five-star, all unverified, and all arrived on the same day."
So easy to make the money. LOL....

"Australia to introduce landmark Google, Facebook legislation to parliament next weekCANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia will introduce landmark legislation to force Alphabet's Google and Facebook to pay publishers and broadcasters for content next week, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday.Australia is on course to become the first country to require Facebook and Google to pay for news content, legislation that is being closely watched around the world.“The bill will now be considered by the parliament from the week commencing 15 February 2021,"" Frydenberg said in an emailed statement.With bipartisan support, the legislation - which Google says is ""unworkable"" and will force it to pull out of the country altogether - could come into law this month.The acceleration of the bill came as a senate committee examining the proposals recommended no amendments.Representatives for Google and Facebook did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.The U.S. search and social media giants have pressed Australia to soften the legislation, with senior executives from both companies holding talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Frydenberg."

"Facebook accused of making false statements to CongressSen. Mazie Hirono is calling out a Facebook executive for making a claim that “appears to be false” at a recent social media hearing. Monica Bickert, Facebook's vice president for content and policy, told the Hawaii Democrat at an April hearing that the company does not allow the use of “some of the more sensitive targeting criteria” when placing ads for “certain types of advertisements, such as financial services advertisements or housing advertisements.”But now Hirono is demanding answers from Bickert in a new letter after the publication the Markup published a report that appears to contradict Bickert's testimony. The Markup reported in April it found 91 ads selling credit and home equity products to restricted age groups. The practice violates Facebook’s anti-discrimination policies and, in some instances, may violate federal or state civil rights laws. Hirono says the issue is bigger than just the Markup's findings. As part of a 2019 settlement, Facebook agreed to block advertisers from targeting housing, employment and credit ads based on age, gender and Zip code, which can be used as a proxy for race. But Hirono worries the company hasn't stopped a broader range of financial services product ads from being targeted based on these characteristics.Recent lawsuits against Facebook claim the company allowed ads for insurance, bank accounts, debit cards, and investment opportunities to target ads in a way that they weren't shown to women and older people. Hirono says Facebook's responses to those lawsuits indicate it allows such a practice, as long as the ads aren't for credit. Hirono suggested in her letter that this wasn't the first time that a Facebook executive had made false statements to Congress. She pointed to a CNN column from 2018, which raised questions about the accuracy of Zuckerberg's statements to Congress about the company's privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Under Section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code, it is a federal crime for making fraudulent statements to Congress."

Going from bad to worse!
From now to next earning release FB slowly cimb to 100+ dollars just like GOOG and AMZN did last 3 months
Looking to buy more during this opportunity. Just wondering what's the entry point?
rising tide raises all boats -- the aapl & amzn beat should make it a green day for nearly everyone. Will FB get north of 197?
What happened? From $299+ down to 291 and change after hours. Why?

Actual results should blow them away, and probably will propel the stock upward.The Facebook moat is safe.

"An interesting dichotomy I’ve noticed to my Facebook long brethren. I was on another stock chat here on yahoo. A company called GEVO (I was thinking of buying some but didn’t) in the green energy field and the catalyst short term Is government money to these alt energy companies that don’t seem to have a lot of cash. Meanwhile, Facebook, a major anchor stock in my portfolio, has tons of cash, great fundamentals, an enormous client base, and is a revenue generating machine of epic proportions. The obvious risk is government trying to stop Facebook because basically the company is FAR TOO SUCCESSFUL. It’s kind of fascinating. I do have faith the government will not beat Facebook nor will they come close. But it is fascinating"

It is amazing how the stock price of FB and GOOGL has skyrocketed since January. Only when they start picking who they want to silence is when the price started to take off. FB did not ban maxine waters for the comments she made during the jury deliberation for derek chauvin. Is this a pay off from the Democratic party for silencing Republicans?
"Contrary to popular belief, lower prices in high quality stocks are the same as lower prices in high quality products - they become more attractive at those prices. And just like low quality products, low quality stocks are unattractive except at incredibly big discounts that make savaging parts profitable.FB is in the first category. Most of this selling is year end and leverage related. Leverage has been very high in the last few months. This sell off will be healthy for the market, ratcheting down some of the extreme leverage levels we’ve seen recently."
"in a stroke of pure luck, had all my FB stock called away at 295 Friday that i bought with avg price of 77 years back, I mean will find out if it was lucky ""IF"" the stock tanks tomorrow, either way Im back in selling puts below 295 tomorrow am, this is a money stock, all it does is make money IMHO."

"20M child sexual abuse images on Facebook in 2020, report saysWASHINGTON (SBG) - Facebook had more than 20 million child sexual abuse images on its platform in 2020, according to a report by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.“You don’t want to talk to your kids about sexual exploitation, you don’t want to talk to the kids about sex or pornography,” said Rezsaun Lewis, a father of five. But Lewis says he has already talked to his kids about pornography, fearing exploitative images of children may pop up on their feeds.“To be sexually abused and then for it to be put on camera and for millions of strangers to watch it for enjoyment, that’s sick,” said Lewis.In 2020, 1,400 companies reported over 21 million incidents related to child pornography. Google had over 546,00 incidents; TikTok over 22,000.“We are talking about crime scene photos,” said NCMEC's Lauren Coffren. “We're taking about the sexual abuse of the child that unfortunately has been memorialized.”Coffren believes the numbers could be even higher than reported.“The real story behind it is that some companies are making an awful lot of reports and some companies are not making a lot of reports,” said Coffren.“We have victims who are 20 years pass the actual hands-on or contact of use, and they are still suffering as a victim because the imagery is still being distributed,” said Coffren. “It’s the crime that never ends.”“As a parent I make a point of it to put certain restraints on my kids phone, there’s parental blocks on everything,” said Lewis."

"It's time to get tough with 'bully' Facebook after Australia move, senior UK lawmaker saysLONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Facebook's move to block all media content in Australia is a staggeringly irresponsible attempt to bully a democracy and will stiffen the resolve of legislators across the world to get tough with the tech giants,a senior British lawmaker said.""This action - this bully boy action - that they’ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world,"" Julian Knight,chair of the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media andSport Committee, told Reuters.""We represent people and I'm sorry but you can't run bulldozer over that - and if Facebook thinks it'll do that itwill face the same long-term ire as the likes of big oil and tobacco,"" Knight said.The social media giant shocked Australia on Thursday when it blocked all media content from its platform in a stunning escalation of a dispute with the government over paying forcontent.The move came after the government of Scott Morrison drafted a law to require Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or be subjected to forced arbitration to agreea price.""If you gain value from carrying trusted sources ofinformation - in the same way as if you gain value for example from music streams - then those that carry those and then sell advertising off the back of that value, should pay for it,""Knight said.""I think they're almost using Australia as a test of strength for global democracies as to whether or not they wishto impose restrictions on the way in which they do business, or corrections to the way in which they operate within markets. So,we're all behind Australia in my view.""Asked if Facebook and other tech giants had got too big fortheir boots, Knight said: ""That's the understatement of the century isn't it?""""The way in which you tackle the tech giants in a positiveway is to look at competition,"" he said."

Of course, this is relative to the huge success of third-party social platforms like Rec Room, BigScreen, and VrChat.It's unclear whether Horizon will be another sandbox experiment, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a big fan of ""social presence"" -- the feeling of being close to someone even from a distance -- and the company is working on a follow-up to Quest."

"I'm curious about next ER. While you can expect a lot of small businesses to close (and so won't spend any more money for ads on FB), we will see a sharp increase in both, users as well as time spent on FB/Instagram/WhatsApp, hence FBs platforms will be even more interesting for those that do still spend money on ads. That's why I would rather take a shot at FB (right before ER) than say Apple or others, where you can expect they will fail bigly.Anyway, good luck investing these days and stay indoors & healthy."
LETS GO FACEBOOK LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This will only go up then split 5 for 1 most likely.
This is why you don't listen to the media or trolls on here. FB is a cash cow and that's all that matters.
"Mega-cap tech stock valuations are not “crazy.” The reason: Incredibly low rates on short-term government debt, or Treasuries — which are “the risk-free yardstick against which other values are measured,” said Buffett.“Interest rates basically are to the value of assets what gravity is to matter” — and the rate on short-term Treasuries is really nothing today, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman said.If Treasury rates are really supposed to be this low, those high-flying tech shares are a bargain, Buffett said (and that is one big “if”). That view contrasts with the prevailing wisdom in the market, which is that tech-stock valuations are extreme.“The Googles, Facebook and Apples are incredible in terms of what they earn on capital,” Warren Buffett said. “They don’t require a lot of capital, and they gush out more money.”"

"Smart money is not interested in visible growth of investments. Otherwise Facebook would have been $2000.People should understand that they might not lose much money on Facebook but will not gain much either. Procedure of irritating market:Do not move the stock price for a few days to a few weeks. Next, bear the share price a little. Show unreal hype of bearish market. Collect the cheap shares. Then, boom the stock price before News.At last after a few spikes, tell people how positive last news is. A big vertical spike and rapid sell from the top. Repeat the circle!"
"Better than Amazon,apple, netflix ytd. 2nd best faang so far this year"
I hope people overreact to this. Facebook will adjust and move on.
"FB is not a Ponzi scheme, it’s a well oiled machine that will continue to run. I’ve been selling residential real estate for 30 years, my FB business profile with BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY Arizona Property gets tons of responses. I can spend $20 on a FB add and get coverage of 5000 homeowners in my area. There is no other business offering so much return of revenue, I would pay much more if I had to.FB will be around forever. Instagram is just getting started my business ads will start with instagram soon"

"California just passed a major privacy law that will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people and gather data • California voters just passed Proposition 24, a ballot measure that expands the state's existing privacy laws and scales back the amount of data that big tech companies are allowed to collect on people. • The law will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people's activity through third parties, which could make much of the tech giants' advertising business models obsolete, experts told Business Insider. • While Prop 24 is active only in California, it will effectively apply to all of the US because of the state's huge influence on the tech industry.A new law passed by California voters in the November election will set an unprecedented standard for digital privacy in the US, making it harder for big tech companies like Facebook and Google to track people's data.The Consumer Privacy Rights Act, also known as Proposition 24, was on track to pass in California as of Wednesday morning, with 56% of voters supporting the measure and over three-quarters of ballots counted.The law will strengthen existing privacy measures in California, allowing consumers to stop businesses from selling or sharing their personal information, including race, religion, genetic details, geographic location, and sexual orientation.It will also set tighter restrictions on how websites track your data to sell that information to advertising partners. Google and Facebook — two of the largest players in online advertising — both gather personal data collected by third-party websites to strengthen their advertising products, which make up the bulk of their revenue.Prop 24 could effectively block companies like Facebook and Google from continuing to collect that data, which could change their business models and cut into their existing revenue streams, privacy-compliance experts told Business Insider.""The third-party adtech industry will need to evolve ... otherwise, their business models risk becoming obsolete,"" said Heather Federman, the vice president of privacy and policy at BigID, a data-privacy compliance firm.A Facebook spokesperson did not provide comment when reached by Business Insider. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. Neither company has publicly taken a stance on Prop 24.The law comes as online-ad giants' business models are facing other new threats. Apple is planning an iPhone software update that will let users opt out of ad trackers, which Facebook has vehemently protested. Web browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are rolling out similar tools to let users opt out of tracking, which could cut into advertisers' revenue.Prop 24 will become enforceable in 2023. Before that happens, California regulators are expected to provide more details about how it will be enforced, which could shape its influence on major tech companies.Despite its potential to hurt the ad revenue of major tech companies, Prop 24 gained support from several tech business leaders who advocate privacy, including former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who said the law was necessary to give people more control over their data.Raju Vegesna, the chief evangelist at the global software firm Zoho, said he expected both private companies and governments to continue to crack down on third-party ad trackers because of growing privacy concerns from consumers. Vegesna added that Zoho removed third party trackers from its sites in July.""That means we leave money on the table, but just because it's there doesn't mean you have to take it,"" Vegesna said in an email to Business Insider. ""The privacy tipping point for most countries will come when they realize just how much data big tech companies such as Google have collected on their citizens and that as a government, there is nothing they can do about it."" Some privacy advocates have said the law doesn't go far enough, calling instead for Congress to pass privacy legislation that sets a single standard nationwide."

"Major conflict of interest between Zuckerberg and shareholders: Zuckerberg is tamping down growth expectations while he initiates a $35 billion share repurchase program, and shareholders want substantial share-price growth, which has been missing for years.

I'm so HAPPY I sold all of my FB stock...good riddance!
It’s tough to hold down the cheapest large cap growth stock in the S&P 500 for long!*** FB will shine this year in a global economy will be booming into record historic growth!!!
What are your thoughts on level after earnings guys? 315 -325 ?
Tomorrow going to close above 217$ and above 225 after earnings
new high tomorrow :-)
"3,30eps vs 1,70 last year"
.........It’s time for FB to rise and shine!Best of luck longs!
very strong results big earnings rev beat
"I can’t predict where FB stock will close tomorrow ( no one can ). But I can say that 4Q EPS justifies a $250 stock, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see $200+ tomorrow and $220 within days or weeks.I bought a LOT more FB around 179-80 on the dip."
When the heck are Americans going to finally stand up and say enough with censoring free speech? People you need to boycott FB. Close your accounts!!!!!
"Today FB stalls after hitting new high yesterday. I will buy FB on Friday before the close. I believe that at this moment, FB is better than any FANG stock."
"Nobody forces anybody to use Facebook. Personally, I love the different groups that you can join, and communicating with my friends. And if they want to track me so as to be able to send me targeted ads, it's no skin off my back. In fact, I find that a lot of the products peddled in those ads are quite interesting. Anyway, Facebook needs to target the ads to be able to attract more advertisers."

"It’s way oversold, but Wehner did a POOR job of representing the company. In fact, I think he will not be in that position for much longer: he stumbled through his presentation, talked about his own lack of experience in forecasting, and really presented a very dim short-term view of the company’s financials, which caught the investment community completely off-guard. That should never happen!!"

"Looks like it's gonna be an ugly day for stocks. FB already giving back Friday's gain in pre-market. Dunno. Looks like a lot of the smart money would like to see the NASDAQ fall below 10,000 so they can load up on quality stocks at a discount. If that's their goal, they'll probably achieve it. Manipulation has been the name of the game on WS for almost 20 years."
"Might see some profit taking now that FB is kissing $200. Gotta remember that there are a lot of longs who bought in last December at a really cheap price. Others may have used the more recent decline into the $160s as a buying point. Thus, there's a lot of uncashed profit waiting to get cashed out. Me? Been in FB since the very early days. Have held through all the ups and downs. Ain't selling a single share. Truly believe we'll see $250 before long and we will never again see those two cheap entry points I mentioned earlier."
"Gary Black: $TSLA valuation remains insanely cheap on any relative measure of valuation. On my 2022 EPS of $9.60, $TSLA now trades at a 2022 P/E of 70x, or 1.3x my estimated 2021-2025 EPS growth of +55%. No mega cap stock is that cheap - not GOOGL 1.4x, not $FB 1.4x, not $AMZN 1.7x."
"Tomorrow FB may test 175, if the revenue per user is higher than 30%, I just want to see the revenue per user in Asia, if it comes out high, I will buy FB July 200 call tomorrow."

However, the zuck can express his views through his personal Facebook account, just like everyone else. To do otherwise, is caving into temptation to control. This is unfair and people won’t like it or stand for it. I hope this is the beginning of the end of Facebook, or to put another way, Facebook goes down MySpace path."

"Maybe this is why FB popped at end of day.Facebook Inc. shares are on track for their first down year in the company’s history, but analysts at JPMorgan are betting that 2019 will be a far better period for the stock.The firm named Facebook its “best idea” among internet stocks for the coming year, citing a potential for the shares to outperform as the company executes on its efforts to improve the health of the Facebook platform.“We expect Facebook to operate its way up the wall of worry in 2019,” wrote analyst Doug Anmuth. He’s upbeat about metrics on the core Facebook platform, which he said look healthy, as well as the company’s overall monthly-active-user trends.New opportunities for Facebook include better monetization of Stories content across Facebook and Instagram. The company may also get more serious about making money off the Messenger and WhatsApp chat platforms.Anmuth likes the stock’s valuation, with shares trading at 16.5 times 2020 GAAP earnings expectations. Shares have fallen 18% so far this year, to a recent $145. Anmuth has a $195 price target on the stock."
"It reached 2.23 billion monthly users, up just 1.54 percent, much slower than Q1’s 3.14 percent around where its growth rate has hovered for years. Facebook earned $13.23 billion in revenue, missing Thomson Reuters consensus estimates of $13.36 billion, but beat with $1.74 EPS compared to an estimated $1.72 EPS."

"FB being sued by almost every state, it seems their reward for ""putting a finger on the scale"" for election interference by donating millions for a one way ""get out the vote"" effort. I have lost all faith in FB and have sold out of my position at $288 because enough is enough. I stayed with MZ and FB through all lawsuits, Cambridge Analytica Fiasco, Data Harvesting etc but seeing their recent policies of censorship is a point I can no longer support by being an investor.Good Luck!"

"FB is so much more than a social network, its an ecosystem. Here is an example...The country of Tonga had an undersea cable cut and lost all internet and cellular communications.

"Facebook price target raised to $330 from $242 at UBSUBS analyst Eric Sheridan raised the firm's price target on Facebook to $330 from $242 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company's increasing exposure to e-commerce serves as an incremental driver of revenue, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Sheridan adds that thanks to its product and platform innovation, Facebook should be a beneficiary of rising e-commerce penetration relative to pre-COVID levels, also benefiting from the rise of social commerce and its ability to craft personalized and ""highly effective"" advertising outcomes."
$FB is the BIGGEST BUBBLE in history.
FB will be +4% after strong Snap earnings beat.
"FB truly has no exposure to China, but when the Dow dives, no one escapes its scorn. Oh, you might make a case for FB going down if their advertisers are affected by the coronavirus and that it turns leads to less spending on ads. That's about the only scenario I can think of that somewhat supports today's decline.The Dow and FB are at or near all-time highs. This red ink could just be a collective decision to take profits, or at least some profits, off the table. Probably a good idea to expect more of the same heading into the weekend. That said, I'll be interested to see where FB is in pre-market trading on Monday morning. If the selling continues as I think it may, it'll be a good sign if FB's pre-market number on Monday is green.If the red ink continues, then I'm afraid we just might be looking at that 10% correction the pundits have been telling us is coming."
Wow the number of bag holders here is mind blowing hahah. It will keep going up but when it will start going down... Nothing will stop it. Good luck I'm out!
Has FB caught up to the difference between climate change (a democratic buzz word) and pollution? Climate change has to do with the axis of the Earth. It is changing because of construction in China and water distribution in India. It has nothing to do with CO2. Pollution is not climate change nor does it change our weather. That is up to the axis of the Earth. Now go look up how the axis has changed from slowly going west to now going east at twice the speed. China and India.

"Isn't this anti-trust thing old news? JMHO, but this is just another example of a publicity starved politician making noise and generating free TV face time. I'm not a lawyer, but proving anti-trust ten or more years after the acquisitions were made is gonna be a pretty tough road to hoe. Furthermore, the companies FB bought were bought when they were babies; not making money and nowhere near fully developed. FB took them to where they are now. Their investment in each goes beyond the original purchase price. Since being bought, FB has no doubt spent billions to development them as market leaders. But we've seen this #### before and FB always recovers since most of the accusations leveled against them are more opinion than fact. Unfortunately, attempts to disparage FB aren't gonna dry up any time soon."

"If you look at the chart, this is the longest secular increase in FB shares since the crash in July. It looks like $130 was indeed the bottom. It will either trade in a range-bound manner or grind higher for months to come. Ultimately, FB will recover from the various headwinds plaguing it lately and soar beyond $500 over the next decade."
It this drops during the day then it’s a no brainer to buy more even on margin
wait until earning.

"$SNAP has a tremendous opportunity out in front of it. Numerous years of ~50%+ revenue growth is enough to justify an even greater valuation in my opinion. Long-term we have an easy bull-case: targeting, ad platform, optimization, and Snap Ad analytics improve, enabling eCPM (ad pricing) growth. In addition, new streamlined product (five parts of Snapchat) enable new ad inventory to be opened up. This allows a lot more impressions per user (i.e. higher ARPU). In addition, lack of content moderation costs relative to platforms like $TWTR and $FB enables higher long-term margin profile. In my view, not financial advice WHATSOEVER, this couldn't be a clearer buying opportunity."

"Facebook estimates not at risk from ad boycott, says JPMorgan maintains BUYThe Facebook (FB) advertising boycott has gained greater momentum over the past few days with bigger brand marketers now planning on withholding spending on the company's properties or all social media during July, or in some cases through year-end, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth tells investors in a research note. The boycott creates near-term risk to the shares, particularly as additional brands are likely to join, adds the analyst. However, Anmuth does not expect significant risk to estimates for Facebook. Many other marketers will take advantage of potentially lower-priced inventory, contends the analyst. He believes Twitter (TWTR) is most at risk given its ""high degree of brand spend and function as an open town hall with more politicized nature."" Anmuth continues to prefer Facebook and Snap (SNAP) in the online ad space."
"I'm in the Middle-East, there is a new trend started 2 days ago where everyone deleting their whatsup application and Facebook application because of their privacy policy change which will be effect staring Feb,8 2021. People now are moving to a new open source and more secure application named ""Signal"" as an alternative to whatsup app. Elon musk mentioned in his tweet 2 days ago to use Signal. Anyone in the U.S using this app"

"Smugglers buy Facebook ads to advertise services on the US-Mexico border, report saysHuman smugglers are paying Facebook to advertise services to migrants seeking to cross the US-Mexico border, according to a report released Friday by a tech transparency group.The influx of migrants, especially unaccompanied minors, at the US southern border has overwhelmed the government's resources in the last month and posed a steep challenge for the government. The government has also been up against human smugglers who in some cases have marketed their services on Facebook, a platform critics say has failed to uphold its content moderation commitments.Of the 50 Facebook pages identified in the Tech Transparency Project report, more than half were created since mid-November and of those, a dozen popped up in the last month. Most pages used descriptors like ""coyote,"" a commonly used term used for human smugglers, to signal the service being offered. Pages were also sometimes categorized as ""travel company"" or ""product/service.""The content of each page, though, was similar: selling the journey to the United States. The names of the pages, included ""Cruse Seguro,"" translated to ""Safe Crossing,"" as well as ""Viajes a Estados Unidos,"" translated to ""Trips to the United States,"" and ""Cruse a usa,"" translated to ""cross to USA.""""Some of these Facebook pages offer detailed descriptions of the travel arrangements they offer as well as the cost of passage for a single person, typically in the thousands of dollars. Others simply post cryptic images of buses with American flag emojis indicating the United States as the final destination and wait for users to express interest,"" the report found. “Facebook is clearly facilitating these illegal activities for profit”, said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, associate professor at George Mason University who studies migrant smuggling networks."

"Yes, bad data breach, but will prolly only result in a payout in a couple years for what amounts to chump change to FB. Marriott had about same size breach, cost them $18M. Yahoo paid out $117M for their 2014 breach of some 3 billion customers. Equifax data breach of some 150 million US customers cost them $1.4 billion, but that info more sensitive than this current FB breach. Target breach of 2013 affecting 40M customers cost them $300MHow tragic, for us FB bulls. I personally don’t care for the company. But then, I’m not on any social media, think it’s mostly big waste of time and these companies strike me as evil with their data collection, etc. but I guess “everyone’s doing it” Barron’s just came out with article saying Facebook is undervalued by at least 20%, I am loaded up with May $350 calls, 4/28 calls, and some 4/9 calls with $310 strike. I’m only worried about the 4/9’s and I have the least amount of those, so should be ok??Hmmph"

"Just saw a FB commercial while watching Basketball Playoffs. It was a warm feel good addressing issues of late and getting back to what made them in the first place, being friends and sharing. I thought it was well done. Either way FB is a money machine."
I don't think ppl realise that FB is trading at 30pe and that Q1 2020 Q2 2020 was weak because of low advertising. Pe will drop even more after Q1 Q2 2021
Leave Facebook now you are contributing to mark zuckerbergs vision of a socialist America if you remain .
thankfully i own fb but hate or love the company they have one of the best balance sheets out there especially their margins are unbelievable
Going for red
Zucks skin gets more translucent every time you see him. Guess he will finally morph back to the extraterrestrial that he is. His ultimate demise along with his social media platform coming sooner than you think.

"The danger of unregulated Facebook Marketplace Police say a 29-year-old man is dead after he went to sell his dirt bike to someone he met on Facebook.Joseph Vindel's body was found in the Garden District of New Orleans this morning, in the 2300 block of Coliseum Street.His girlfriend reported that Vindel found a buyer for the dirt bike on the Tulane Classifies section of Facebook Marketplace.The two set up a meeting in Harvey, on the Westbank of Jefferson Parish. Sheriff Joe Lopinto said at a JPSO news conference that they were able to locate and arrest the suspect. He says the suspect admitted to the murder Sunday morning on Manhatten Blvd., then dumping the car and body in New Orleans.Lopinto says the suspect rode the dirt bike back from where he left Vindel's body.The sheriff says they have seen a series of crimes linked to Facebook Marketplace and advised people to exercise caution when meeting someone they contacted on the social media."
"Apple's CEO equates Facebook to digital peeping Toms, changing our behaviorApple and Facebook's relationship has always been best described by ""it's complicated."" But over the past couple months, the two companies have gone from frenemies to no longer being friendly.The latest example comes from Apple CEO Tim Cook who compared Facebook to peeping Toms, people ""looking in the window and seeing what's in your home"" without your permission. But in the digital version, he said, it's ""somebody looking over your shoulder, seeing what you're searching, seeing who you're talking to, seeing what 'like' buttons you're hitting and so forth, and then building a detailed profile of that.""That, he said, is why Apple's pushing its newest privacy rules in a free iPhone and iPad software update due ""in a few weeks."" In his interview with Canada's Toronto Star published Monday, Cook said the software was created in part because he believes people should be asked to give consent to modern advertising techniques. In Apple's case, the new software will include a pop-up, asking users if they consent to allowing an app or company to ""track"" them ""across apps and websites owned by other companies"" in order to ""deliver personalized ads to you.""""We think that some number of people, I don't know how many, don't want to be tracked like that,"" Cook said. ""And they should be able to say they don't."""
"FB ūber- Bulls will prevail over these “weak short stragglers” who are held up at “Bull Trap Creek” without a prayer , nor a paddle!*** FB will end strongly in the green at the closing bell , when these bears are rounded in a stampede from here into the close!!!"

"Why I quit Facebook. For every 10 friends...3 were making endless political rants. The next 3 were posting Grandma’s recipes and other nonsense. The next 3 didn’t post much at all except the occasional cartoon saying. That left 1 friend per 10 posting something fun, vacations, discussions on hometown, etc. 9 of 10 were useless stuff on Facebook. This is why I left Facebook."
I heard about FB the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

If we can get to 365 by August then that’s a 20 percent move from last August’s high Right in line with its its growth rate. Facebook is a core position. A stud. An earnings juggernaut.
FB will be worth $1tril when the stock hits $352. That’s still a 30 PE
I predict FB will hit $350 before pull back.
$254 area holding strong...funds and institutions are gaming with this value play....cheapest stock in tech now with 20-30% annual growth

"New data shows how devastating Apple’s new anti-tracking feature is for FacebookApple late last month introduced iOS 14.5, an update with all sorts of intriguing new features, including dozens of new emojis, more diverse Siri voice options, support for AirTags, and more.The most notable iOS 14.5 feature, or at least the one that has garnered the most attention, is a privacy tool dubbed App Tracking Transparency. As the name suggests, App Tracking Transparency allows users to control which apps can track their activity “across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or sharing with data brokers.”Not surprisingly, Facebook views Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature as a threat to its underlying business to the extent that it hinders the social networking giant’s ability to track billion of users.According to a recent report from Flurry Analytics, only 3% of iOS users have opted-in to app tracking, which is the exact scenario Facebook was dreading when Apple first unveiled the feature at WWDC last year."

DCF of 18% growth (24% for the past 3 years) and a 22 pe (normally 25-30) gives a conservative FV of $330. TLDR: just click buy and forget about it.

Either way, it's a good time for FB in what can best be described as a take-this-stock-and-shove-it kind of a day for the shorties.

Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
"We, Trump supporters, will bury big tech. There will be alternate sites for twitter, facebook, youtube etc. I am sure there will be or I will make them"
"Australia's antitrust chief claims victory after Facebook standoffCANBERRA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The architect of Australia’s laws forcing Google and Facebook to pay media companies for content claimed victory on Wednesday though critics said last-minute changes to appease Facebook favoured Big Media over smaller news outlets.After tense negotiations prompted Facebook to cut off news in the country last week, Australia offered a few concessions and the social media giant said it would restore news as the revamped bill looked set to become law this week.Even though Facebook said its concerns had been met and opposition lawmakers warned that smaller media players may be overlooked, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said the bargaining power imbalance had been righted.""The changes the government's done are things that either don’t matter much or are just to clarify things that, at least in Facebook's mind, were unclear,"" Sims, who helped draft the original laws, told Reuters.""Whatever they say, they need news. It keeps people on their platform longer. They make more money,"" he said.The endorsement from Australia's top antitrust regulatorwill bolster the government's argument that its hardline approach worked and may offer encouragement to countries such as Canada and Britain which have said they plan similar laws.Other countries have introduced legislation forcing so-called Big Tech players to negotiate with media companies for licensing fees for links that draw traffic, and advertising revenue, to their platforms.However, Australia will be the first country where a government arbitrator effectively sets the rates tech giantswill have to pay if negotiations with media companies fail.The last-minute changes include an extra two-month mediationperiod between any failed talks and state intervention and give the government discretion to release Facebook from the processif it proves it has made a ""significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry"".Facebook's vice president of global news partnerships,Campbell Brown, said in a blog post that the changes confirmedthe U.S. company could decide which news, if any, appeared onits platform and that it could avoid forced arbitration.But Sims said Facebook was always free to stop offering news- and had also been free to cut deals to avoid intervention.""This isn't a must-carry regime,"" he said. ""We never said we’re forcing Facebook to keep showing news."""

FB is officially getting the proper attention it deserves for being a “hidden gem” in the tech-sector!- Mr Market now realizes that FB is on pace to deliver a record growth FY-2021 year — with outsize and exceptional revenues and profit growth within a global economic rebound year!!!
"I don’t know if FB will be 170 or 210 in 2 weeks. But I do know that at 190 it’s a bargain. If it is 170 in 2 weeks it will be an even better bargain. The stock is trading at only about 20 times 2018 earnings and is growing quickly enough to get a 25 PE, if not 30, on those earnings.Any dip from here is a buying opportunity unless facebooks fundamental business picture changes (which is unlikely in the near future)."
"Interesting that 80% of FB stock is held by large institutions like Vanguard, TRowe , Black Rock, etc.... do the shorts really think they’re gonna influence the majority of institutions into selling by publishing old news or noise?"

"WhatsApp's New Privacy Policy Could Lead To 'stalking' Of Consumers: CCI Tells Delhi High CourtThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Tuesday told the Delhi high court that WhatsApp’s new privacy policy could lead to excessive data collection and “stalking” of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users.The submission was made by senior advocate Aman Lekhi on behalf of the CCI, defending its order for an investigation into the new privacy policy of social media platform WhatsApp. Lekhi told the court that CCI was looking into the competition aspect and not the alleged violation of privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.“There is no question of jurisdictional error,” he said adding that WhatsApp and Facebook’s pleas challenging the CCI’s order were “incompetent and misconceived”.User data including their location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to the creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised for targeted advertising – all of which amounts to “stalking”, Lekhi added."

"FB value will someday exceed Alphabet search (which is 80 or 90 percent of Alphabet now). Users cannot leave FB because thats their vrtual bar/coffee shop/family gathering. If someone constantly bothers you to buy something in your favorite coffee shop you might leave someday. Zuckerberg is right. The best way to make money is to give users the best experience. FB will have more information about ""who is interested in purchasing cars"", ""what people's opinion is"". FB can also play the role of yelp or amazon reviews. Because they can create Forum or mine people's opinion on different products. At the end they have to do it by not interrupting the users preferred way of online socialization. They might be invasive, but discreet. To cover all the bases the investors have to put money in FB, AMZN and GOOG."

"Facebook shares now a bargain - Barron'sMar. 24, 2018 3:21 PM ET|About: Facebook (FB)|By: SA Eli Hoffmann, SA News Editor Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) lost $75B in market value this week, and shares are now priced as ""scornfully"" as cigarette and gun makers, but there?s still plenty to like about the stock, Barron?s says.Revenue is still growing more than 5x as fast #$%$&P 500 stocks; its profit margin is 3x as high.30% of the world?s population uses Facebook, and there?s little evidence so far of widespread user revolt.Shares could climb 25% or more over the next year to $200. At that price, it would still be trading at a reasonable 23x next year?s earnings consensus."
Well one good thing is since we haven't had a huge run up this time I think the upside is much greater than the downside thinking $200-210 on the upside low $180's on the downside JMO

"If all non-Fb believers would QUICKLY sell, it’ll be a dent - but quickly forgotten in the stock price in few weeks given revenue machinery that Facebook is. Context, why Fb is NOT affected by Apple’s cross-app tracking changes: - Well, Facebook is the ONLY company in the world that does well even without Apple’s cross app data. Because guess what: Many Apple apps, use Facebook for social login/share, AND Facebook has enough signal from all other activities (incl. Instagram). So if anything, it’s a problem for every OTHER company that doesn’t’ have the same 3 billion people reach. Apple is ‘only’ 1 Billion, and Facebook did just fine getting all signals they need. - So… again: Other advertising companies WITHOUT the reach of Facebook will loose, which means Facebook will gain ‘EVEN MORE’ for lack of alternatives with same advertising power :)"
400 by end of week
"FB up $1.88 is pre-market as I write. Certainly a good sign. Don't know about $200 by Friday a some have opined, but clearly we ought to whiz by $190 as the day progresses.I am expecting nothing less than another great ER. What to expect from Zuck? Well, that's another matter. However I do agree with the poster who noted that Zuck strategically announced the changes to news feeds well in advance of the ER. He gave investors time to digest that (Much ado about nothing IMHO) ahead of time rather than making it part of the CC. Clever move by Zuck.Zuck may have his own agenda when it comes to the world, but I'm starting to think his BOD and his top employees (Stock options anyone?) are getting his ear in terms of reminding him that FB is a public company with shareholders, and his first duty is to maximize the pps for them. If so, that's a huge step in the right direction. Zuck has to stop treating FB like it's his own private kingdom to do with as he pleases. Let's see if he got the message."

"From a money making standpoint, owning FB is a no brainer. People like Oak betting on a stock collapse are about to get a schooling. FB is cheap and has high growth, both in earnings and free cash flow. Free cash flow is expected to be $35 billion next year, up from the mid 20s this year. Instagram and What’s App, which isn’t popular in the US but hugely popular outside of the US, are tremendous assets that give FB an infinite supply of life. In addition, FB has developed a VR headset which is going to become mainstream, which could turn FB into a hardware business in addition to an online one. Digital advertising and e commerce are further sources of revenue for FB. Finally, FB has $62 billion in cash and no debt. It could easily pay a small dividend, which would open up a ton of institutional buying, or they could do giant share repurchases. In addition to that, despite all the Trumpers who boycotted FB FB’s user numbers continue to increase due to most people’s inability to complete quit the base. In short, betting against this company is suicide and those who lean on morals will rob themselves of an incredible opportunity to get wealthy. It’s not a question of if you’ll make money from here, but how much. And with rising rates FB is a solid name to own as its healthy financials and cheap valuation insulate it from being clobbered like the high beta names. Washington most likely can’t do anything to destroy the tremendous bull case I just laid out. Buy all you can here and your wallet will thank you down the road."

"Walmart warns customers about Facebook spreading yet another scamDon’t get too excited about any Facebook posts you’ve seen about Walmart giving away free gift bags and more; they’re not for real.A few weeks ago, Walmart announced that it was trying to free itself of plastic bags and identify solutions that could serve a similar function for the betterment of the environment. However, no good deed goes unpunished -- or should we say “unscammed.” Walmart’s announcement led to scammers creating a post on a fake Walmart Facebook page that’s gone viral. The post featured photos of people standing behind dozens of reusable blue bags, claiming that the retail giant is giving away gift bags filled with products and a $75 voucher to those who share and comment on the post. “To celebrate the Great news of Walmart becoming plastic bags free by the end of 2021, we are giving one of these Walmart gift-bags to every person who share & comment before Thursday @ 5pm. Each person who does this will have their bag full of goodies and a $75 voucher delivered straight to their door on Friday!” the scam post alleges.Keep your personal information safeOn the surface, it looks like consumers might not be able to be harmed by the scam. After all, liking a post isn’t likely to compromise an account in any way. However, the next instructions given out by the scammers are the dangerous part. The post goes on to tell people to validate their entries at a specific link. That link leads to a prompt asking those who clicked to enter their personal information, which can later be used by cybercriminals.By all accounts, 26,000 people took the bait and “liked” the page. What Walmart says those Facebookers failed to do was take a hard look at the photo. It had been digitally doctored, adding in the Walmart logos on the bags and t-shirts. Another dead giveaway that the page was fake was that it was missing the little blue checkmark indicating that the page has been verified by Facebook. Comparing apples to apples, the real Walmart Facebook page has that blue checkmark and more than 34 million likes.“This page is not affiliated with or endorsed by Walmart,” a Walmart spokesperson said. “We take any fraud impacting our customers seriously and continue to implement and improve upon measures designed to help guard against various consumer scams.”"
"Hold on to your shares. The MMs want them. That is why they are running AAPL, TSLA, BABA etc up and holding FB down. This is a 300 stock. Long and strong."
somehow alot of Shorty are over at GME.... they should come here instead. GME is a long play...FB is a short play! Be on the right side to make $$
"Fantastic ER call. Apart from revenues and profits which jumped almost 40% yoy and insane 46% operating margin, things which will drive up the stock, one of the most under-rated aspects of how this company has evolved is their willingness and ability to deal with issues like taking down terrorist content, a success rate of 99.99% is unbelievable. Also they are getting more transparent every passing year which helps build trust with users. Congratulations FB and shareholders!"
Lol
Keep selling guys lol

Digital Advertising Will Account for the Entire Industry's Growthhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/digital-advertising-account-entire-industry-190000116.htmlGrowth will continue to propel FB higher.
The path to FB $350 to $409 will be made easier with next week’s Q1 Earnings report!
I checked Facebook and all my friends and strangers are still on it
Dividen in the future ?
"After compiling five cases of from the low to high between 2014 and 2019, the average run up is 36% from the consolidated low, the averaged time is 81 days, we can easily see 350 - 370 by summer assuming that the market does not tank!"
"Thank you! It’s time that FB pays, they have been doing whatever that want for the pass decade. Time to pay FB!"
Same story. Time to buy more for the long term.
"A lot of investors wait for Snap earning results before buying FB days before its own earnings, Snap is a good indicator of how FB is going to perform."

Get ready for the sell off to happen... they pump up their profit by increasing the ad pricing. Next quarter they will be dead
"With FB, it's always something. Just when it appeared $250 was a certainty, Bam!, we get knocked down by some bad news."
"People thought I was kidding when I said a week and a half ago this would go back to 300 yet, yesterday, it hit 299. One thing is certain. FB pps has been consistent since August 2020. Being consistent may be good for a restaurant, but not a stock that pays no dividend! LOL ;)"
I was wavering with a couple of minutes before after hours close- do i buy or do i wait until tomorrow morning? This thing going to open higher pre-market? I put in at $173 and missed it. Not sure if that was right move or if it’ll open much higher tmrw. Thoughts?

Facebook closed at new high at $189.35 today. Time to get on the Facebook train before blowout earnings and revenues are reported next week. Facebook should easily break through $200.00 and beyond next week. Get on the train or get under the train.
Excellent company 
Added 3000 shares yesterday after hour at $227. I am in full confidence that Facebook stock will recover and make new high.
Farcebook is a real CASH COW!!! 9 days until earnings and still trading at August 2020 levels :) LMAO!!! You've been Screeched!!!
900 bil market cap!
Don't listen to the noise. FB stock is just consolidating around 197-199 before it crosses 200. A lot of big players already took big positions between 190-195. Those guys are not weak hands and will not easily sell. Therefore the stock will go higher! Thumbs up if you agree!
$400/share is closer than ever bois and grills!
Next stop 220$

I'm glad I deleted my FB account. I don't miss it. Good riddance.
A good day on SOLID VOLUME.
"I'm out tomorrow, selling this while I can and buying mining coin glta!"
"300 soon,very soon"
"this is so devalued, and so for long, its time to get to its real valuation!!even a $350 would be acceptable"
Back to 300
Action suggests a big miss. AAPL action is bullish though.
-15% tomorrow. everyone left fb and theres nothing but political agenda bots. advertisements arent even making it to real people. why advertise on a platform where theres no real people.
"With billions of earnings y-o-y, SP should be in 600 plus! MZ must declare dividends long overdue, I'm LTI since May 2012 IPO N added more in 2013 when it tanked to $20s...perhaps or maybe should split too...Mhm, Hmm...GLTAL...this is a BARGAIN...only if u can afford it..."
Facebook will be broken up. Modern Block buster video.
Just got a buy alert on FB. Any opinions (http://Stocks-tracker.com)?
Here comes 325. If you can get it premarket for under 310 you’re good.

"I have no doubt of FB's profit. It will break all the record again, even bigger than first quarter, because of Instagram. if you see how the Instagram is well known for social media, you will be surprised. Instagram is used not only social media, but E-commerce in a big way. Instagram is a cash machine that FB keeps ringing in this quarter. I will reveal the whisper earnings number on the eve of the earnings report day, July 25, 10 min. before the market closes."
Sellers are in short supply and the FB juggernaut is rallying into the closing bell !!
"I think people are finally realizing FB is the way to go, FB is strong on cash, FB is immune from Covid-19 because it can continue to operate (working from home employees), cost savings from work from home, investments in Asia, Growing Instagram, Growing Libra, Diplomatic with President, Immune from 2020 elections, FB ads coming at rocket speed, immune from Elections, Group Video conferencing, Shops, etc. If you think about the revenue streams, its simply amazing!"

Big money pushing this back to $300.
ROFL great close. Bulls why so quiet now? Keep the chatter up
Profit tracker is back baby! Let’s run
Amazing how people don't understand this business model. We own a franchising system and our per store revenue drops by 33% on average when we don't advertise on FB. I am wondering if there are any other business owners on this board?? Do people understand terms like customer acquisition cost and what that means in regards to the greatest advertising model ever invented to date? Stay Thirsty my friends!
"The day will come when FB crashes and burns. The only thing keeping them alive are the 230 protections. There is nothing decent with their discriminatory practices. And no you cannot do what you want with your company. If you believe that I want you to buy a diner. Then I want you to say only whites can sit at the counter. Once you've done this comeback after the lawsuits are settled. And then tell me how selective discrimination is perfectly legal because ""its a private company"" "
FB will be more than $500 by end of the year. There will be a PE expansion and a stock split just like Apple last year. They make a ton of money and have 2.5 billion people on their platform. All you naysayers if you have the balls then shut up and just short the stock if you think it will go lower. Just stop whining about politics and privacy issues. You shouldn't go on FB to decide which way to vote AND don't put your sensitive personal info on it. Enough with your nonsense! Give me a thumbs up if you agree!
congrats to all longs
"What a cheap way to bash everyday and all the time,a strong an profitable company. How easy is to insult and troll behind the curtains, no one is obligated to subscribe,follow or read Facebook, if you have an account and you wish to fill it with your information, its your desicion, no one is obligated to do anything here, so pls stop this nonsence that facebook is the bad guy around here.Next week financial results, they will be excellent, why is this stock so behind in its price range?"
Buy on dips!! Buying opportunities now on discounted FACEBOOK price before skyrocketing price on BLOWOUT Earnings Report day!!!!!!
"Few ppl talks how reopenning could be bullish for fb, yes ppl will spend less time on social media but barely IMO. But advertising will go much higher with small/medium company reopening."

"I’m thinking of selling too, I don’t seem to have the interest in Facebook and many of my friends hardly ever post. I think it’s glory days are pretty much over. Good luck to those that hang on but I’ve made a bunch of money on this and need to sell while I can grab the gain I’ve gotten."
Congrats to people making money off this company. I still don't get why people use it and why anyone advertises on it. When was the last time you looked at an advertisement on line? Do you remember the company or the product? I will remain social media deficient.
"I didn't give FB enough credit. I said back to 300 by today. My bad. That said, back to 300 by next Friday ;)"
Why I gave up Facebook. 300 “friends”. 150 post endless political garbage. 50 post cartoon messages. 50 post grandmas pie recipe. 49 font post at all. I’m left with 1 person who posts interesting stuff. I contacted her and told her to send me vacation pics directly.
"Trash talking shorts cant even get FB to yesterday’s low, but saying $290 is coming lol"
"I think this will be a $1,000+ share price stock by 2030. Facebook are getting more sign ups all the time as more people in poorer countries get internet access. Facebook are also getting smarter at increasing their revenue per user with their A.I. I think it's $30 per user by year at the moment."
OK MM'S !!!! TGIF !!!! Show Me A Sweet GREEN Close !!!!!!!Amen !!!!!!!:):):):)
Let the winner RUN..... $215-$220 By earnings and 10% or more jump after they SMASH earnings estimate. See you at $240+ after first-quarter earnings report.
When will they lose 230 protection? My guess? SOON AND VERY SOON. Both parties dislike the Zuck and FB.

"It’s totally understandable for someone not to like FB the company or it’s CEO/officers, however that’s completely different from the business model. The question at the end of the day is, if it’s a growing profitable business to invest in. The barrier to entry is a tall one for any new company to duplicate, and therefore a reasonable investment as far as I’m concerned. Obviously every investor has to do their own due diligence and make sure it’s aligned with your own values. Very simple"
FB rally today or what guys?
it does appear that it will be even worse for FAKEBOOK come Monday Morning Trading...I still say 75-100 points DOWN within the first 30 minutes and it won't recover....ever. Look now at the growth of Telegram and Signal.....I mean SIGNAL has already over taken Whatsapp..... and now left/right/middle are all coming after FAKEBOOK for their transgressions... this stock is toast. ZUCK thought he was cute and could play everyone but now he will find out.....that was a bad move. Boolean

"FB, INSTAGRAM WHATSAPP. OCCULUS. Spare 22 billion. What more does one need ?"
Stay long if you like red. Wall Street didn’t build’ US”
"Facebook's balance sheet is not only debt-free, unlike some of its peers, but it carries $55 billion in cash and equivalents.The strong flexibility Facebook's balance sheet affords the company is being under-appreciated by investors - who ironically probably spend too long on Facebook's family of apps concerned about government investigations of the company.Jesting aside, Facebook announced a new $10 billion share repurchase plan, which is being added to its outstanding $4.9 billion repurchase plan.Thus, after reporting excellent growth and investing aggressively into new opportunities, Facebook still has more cash than it needs and is returning it to shareholders.On a cash flow from operations, before capex requirements (and before stock-based compensation accounted as a 'cash cost'), Facebook trades for just 16.6x its trailing figures. This number is not only among the cheapest in its peer group, but it is also cheaper than its own historical average."
Green...????
"Re: FTC InvestigationOn the surface, that sounds ominous, however, in reality it should not worry anyone, least of all FB shareholders. Why not? First, it'll be up to the FTC to prove FB did something wrong. Good luck trying to prove that certain ads aimed at a certain segment of FB users were the end all and be all of why a person cast his/her vote for a certain candidate. Second, back in 2011 FB was given a set of rules/regulations about what they can and can't do with data provided by the users themselves (those last five words are paramount for obvious reasons.). So long as FB hasn't been violating those rules, and there has never even been so much of a hint that they have, there will be no sanctions in that arena.What scares these pols more than anything is that FB, and all of social media in general, has become so ingrained in the fiber of people's lives that they (the pols, i.e.) can no longer keep the voting public in the dark like they could as recently as twenty years ago. News, real or imagined, can get sent around the world in a nano second. Thus, social media can serve as their scapegoat every time something (An election?) doesn't go there way.Finally, and as an aside, this past weekend it was reported that Yahoo's user data was being compromised for several years. I swear, since about mid-afternoon yesterday, I can't find one headline talking about Yahoo's faux pas, Yet FB is still in the news as some sort of bad guy. In was comforting to hear the talking heads on CNBC last night talk of FB being oversold. One regular said this current situation is just a bump in the road for FB on their way to bigger successes."
Has anyone else noticed the sudden ads on Instagram? This will show up in earnings within the upcoming quarterly reports.
This will close green today watch!!!

"I dare say, Fb will challenge 300.00 by the end of the year."
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx
FB will be a great source of revenue for the Biden tax plan. We need money to build infrastructure.
"FB is well suited to handle rising rates due to it having $61 billion in cash, huge and growing free cash flow, solid and growing EBITDA, solid profitability and solid growth, and just not growth, but GARP....(Growth at a reasonable price). This name is undervalued as well. You will not lose money in this name while rates are rising unlike the high beta names which are getting clobbered. The bear scenarios on FB are weak and mostly unfounded. The yahoo shorts like Oak probably will aggressively thumbs down this post, but the simple fact is FB is not going to collapse the way the bears are hoping. I've been in since the mid 60s and will continue to hold over time...bears complain the stock appears to have peaked out but that is because they have no long term vision. Come back to me when you can say the story is broken, the financials are bad, the growth no longer intact, etc. None of that exists right now. THen you have the people who use moral reasons not to own FB, most of which are pretty weak arguments. Their choice to stay poor while longs like me get rich is their undoing. So thumbs down away...you're not going to make me any poorer or hurt my feelings."
LIstening to the hearing makes at least one thing clear. Zuckerberg did his homework and Congress did not. Congress is so clueless about Facebook technology they are asking him what they should do.
New and better social media sites popping up everyday now. Fakebook is an old hack site that old people use.

"Gave back some of the early session gain, but all in all, a nice green day up $2+. Sure I'd like to see FB pop $10 in a day, but I'll settle for mini moves in the green. Gonna be $150 by Christmas. Can't wait for Q4 2018 numbers to come out. They should be decent to good and dispel any notions that users are leaving FB in droves. So long as FB maintains its 2.5 billion users across their four platforms, I'm not too concerned about how that number is divided. If Instagram happens to be the new FB in terms of growth, revenues and profits, well, so be it. All the cheese goes in the same corporate pot."
If it hits $180 today I will record myself swimming across the Atlantic ocean

A 600 stock ! That is what FB is worth now ! It used ti go higher than apple.till the haters created the rehashed bad news stories about it. The headlines never mention fb’s huge cash profits.
Lol sooo the real question is 350 or 360? I’m thinking 360 but who knows ;)
Naz is fading fast... bear  market ?
careful. FB'ers will be selling options soon. These prices are crazy high.

"Never have or will have a FB account, I won't buy stocks in companies that wok's to fools. I am a supporter to remove protections for tech companies, that uses the China model of, you have no rights..Fb is China's right hand. just like yahoo, censorship....a few pieces of silver is not worth a partnership with hateful companies toward freedoms..."
I'm in when it hits 80 in about a month.
Grand deception is embedded into Zuckerberg's DNA.
what are the expectations today!! i think we top $320 easily afterhours
FB been flexing!
"Yabba dabba do! Been waiting 3 weeks for this!! $300 today, or close, I think...And it will still be undervalued."
Time to buy more and more FB stock
I think selling ads to Message Parlors is not good for FB.
FB is the ideal “value / growth” intrinsic fundamental business in technology!

"Jefferies boosts Facebook target on ad strength, Instagram monetizationJul. 13, 2018 4:25 PM ET|About: Facebook (FB)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor Jefferies has boosted its price target on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), with an eye to the company topping expectations with its Q2 results due July 25.Analyst Brent Thill reiterated a Buy rating and raised the target to $240 from $215, implying 16% upside from today's close of $207.32.""Continued strength in pricing"" and growth in Instagram offers upside, he writes. Advertiser checks are showing higher prices for the ads. And Instagram's recently launched IGTV effort offer new monetization prospects.:):):):):)"
FB could drop Down to $170 worst case scenario. The last time FB had a scandal in 2018 and people boycott FB the share price dropped 40%.
"Untrustworthy Facebook faces a roadblock for developing apps for kidsPlans by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to offer an Instagram app for children have hit a potential roadblock after the most forceful criticism yet of the controversial venture in a letter from dozens of state attorneys general demanding the idea be dropped.In the letter sent on Monday, the top lawyers from 44 US states and territories said Facebook’s proposal would be “detrimental to the health and well-being of children, who are not equipped to navigate the challenges of having a social media account.”The letter also took aim at the company’s record. “Facebook has historically failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms,” the attorneys wrote.“The attorneys general have an interest in protecting our youngest citizens, and Facebook’s plans to create a platform where kids under the age of 13 are encouraged to share content online is contrary to that interest.”The criticism mirrors that previously expressed by childhood health experts. In April the advocacy group Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood called on Mr Zuckerberg to scrap the idea, highlighting the dangers of social media for young users.""[Instagram’s] relentless focus on appearance, self presentation, and branding presents challenges to adolescents’ privacy and wellbeing. Younger children are even less developmentally equipped to deal with these challenges,"" the group said."
FB is on sale in the bargain bin at these levels — we’ve hit “gift  trading levels”!

Since the release of Oculus Quest 2 in the third quarter of last year, it has been selling like hot cakes. The scheduled delivery time during the Christmas season was as long as a month. Although the delivery date has returned to normal, the purchase limit is still limited to 3 units. By the end of March, Quest 2 had sold nearly 4 million units.Oculus is also scaling up, with more than 10,000 employees today, up from about 1,000 in 2017."
"FB's INSTAGRAM (Music) Opportunity---Instagram has been relatively insulated from the controversies plaguing its parent company, allowing to better focus on these initiatives without being distracted.Investors should now consider another opportunity that Instagram has: musicAn Instagram exclusive:Music Business Worldwide points out that Jaden Smith recently released an album as an exclusive for Instagram on its new IGTV service. While almost always time-limited, artists exclusives are often a differentiating factor that music-streaming services compete over, so releasing content as an exclusive on a photo/video-sharing service is quite the departure -- and a new model worth exploring.Keep in mind that Facebook recently inked deals with all three major record labels -- Warner Music, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, and Universal Music -- that give it the rights to include copyrighted music in user-generated content. All of those deals notably included Instagram. It seems unlikely that Facebook or Instagram would try to launch a pure music-streaming service anytime soon, but it undoubtedly has an opportunity to encroach on YouTube's dominance as a popular destination for music videos and other free music content.Incredibly, Instagram's user base is catching up with YouTube. The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) property was originally launched in 2005 and now has roughly 1.8 billion monthly active users (MAUs). Instagram was launched in 2010 and recently hit 1 billion MAUs."
"I’ve bought some Facebook down here but this market makes no sense to me anymore. I see stocks like wayfair, GameStop, jumia, doordash at insane levels and I can’t rationalize that. I’m willing to change my mindset if it makes sense but I can’t with this market. I will continue to look for opportunities while patiently staying mostly in cash. Normally I think you should not argue with the market but I’m old enough to know this exuberance does not last for too long."

"Australia passes new law requiring Facebook and Google to pay for newsAustralia has passed a new law that will force tech companies to pay publishers for news content, setting the stage for potential, similar action in other countries.The new code, which the Australian parliament approved Thursday, ""will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate,"" Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement.The country's unprecedented new law had been hotly debated in recent months. Facebook and Google had opposed the initial version of the legislation, which would have allowed media outlets to bargain either individually or collectively with them — and to enter binding arbitration if the parties couldn't reach an agreement.Facebook even shut down news pages in Australia last week in opposition to the legislation. But it restored them earlier this week after the country made some changes to the code, including a provision that ""must take into account whether a digital platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through reaching commercial agreements with news media businesses.""Arbitration, meanwhile, will now only be used as a ""last resort"" following a period of ""good faith"" mediation."
"I think this reaction before earnings is actually a good thing. Everyone talks about the ""pattern"" of run up before earnings and then a dip on the Conference Call. Well if its a recognizable patter, it should self correct like this, where everyone tries to be ""first"" in selling before the post earnings drop. I think that why its positive, is that everyone who wants to avoid the possible drop is exiting. If we have an expected conference call where MZ tempers expectations, the stock will sit as it has already dipped. If we have a good conference call, all those people will try and enter back in immediately and it will see a possible huge spike in price when that happens. MZ already announced the bombshell news before earnings about the newsfeed. Now I think he was smart in announcing the newsfeed change so far in advance before the CC. He flat out said that people would be expected to spend less time. Thats priced in. If he gives some good news on the CC about the stock, or that revenue wont be affected much if at all by the change, we will see an amazing day Feb 1."
Lol it’s still going to close green
"How does this BS earnings estimate get derived????? Imagine if you missed your goal of being correct by 50%??? you wouldn't have a job. Oh, unless you are told to lowball the number. Now I get it."

How much does Zuck get paid to push violence of one group to another and then deny everything?
The Cambridge Analytica debacle was the greatest gift for FB shareholders since the IPO meltdown and mobile ad conversion scare. Still not too late as FB is still trading cheaply compared to future growth. And the X factor is the stuff we still know nothing about!

"Sell! Sell! This stock is going down from here.. with new ios, FB is dead!"
All these naysayers are most probably in one of these categories:1. They have shorted the stock (bad move)2. They seek to drive the price down to get a better deal on a strong stock.3. They work for one of the media companies who see their doom in sight due to advertising budgets shifting to Facebook.4. They put a lot of their personal info on a global on-line Chat Platform and expected no one to see it ( foolish )5. They lost the love of their life to someone on Facebook.If for some reason these naysayers believe that their info should be safe on a global chat platform when the banks can’t even keep it secure or that FB is a bad investment then they should stop investing in the market because they have no idea what they are doing.

"Indian government threatens legal action against WhatsApp’s new privacy policyThe Indian government has put WhatsApp on notice as Facebook is yet to back down from its position. Reports suggest that WhatsApp may face strong legal action if it does not give a “satisfactory” response to a notice sent by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).A report by PTI, quoting government sources, says that the ministry has written to WhatsApp asking the Facebook-owned company to respond within 7 days.More than just a threat of legal actionIt’s not just the threat of legal action that should worry WhatsApp – the government has taken a strong position with regards to contents of the privacy policy.According to the report, the government has termed WhatsApp’s decision to enforce its privacy policy as “irresponsible”, calling the terms and conditions as “unfair”. WhatsApp is used by 530 million users in India, according to government data.In the letter, the ministry has drawn the attention of WhatsApp to how its new privacy policy is a violation of several provisions of the existing Indian laws and rules.IT ministry takes umbrage to discrimination against Indian usersThe ministry has also taken offense to WhatsApp policy being “discriminatory” against Indian users, when compared to those in Europe.More specifically, WhatsApp users in Europe do not have to accept the new privacy policy. They can opt out of the changes without the fear of their WhatsApp account being deleted – a scenario that is not applicable for Indian users.European users have the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to thank for it. With the Indian Data Protection law still under works, the Indian government might lack the teeth to force WhatsApp to withdraw its new terms and conditions."

"Quote: ""The answer to the question of why I still like Facebook is quite simple. Despite the increasing political and regulatory risks, which may indirectly only widen its economic moat (a term meaning competitive advantages), Facebook's cash-based sources of intrinsic value, as in the net cash on its books and its capacity to generate considerable free cash flow, are phenomenal. This, despite the added expected costs related to some of the privacy initiatives it has put into place. From where I stand, Facebook is worth $226 per share, and our discount rate of ~9% means we estimate this intrinsic value to advance this pace on an annual basis going forward. But just how realistic are our forecasts?"" ""Facebook is super cheap, growing like a weed, its chart is looking up, the company generates gobs of free cash flow, has a boatload of net cash on the books, and has one of the strongest competitive advantages out there: the network effect. The market is not giving Facebook its due credit at all. I'd be in favor of the company launching a massive buyback program and taking on a little debt to do it (with intentions of paying it back very soon, of course). I think the best days are still ahead at Facebook."""
Call me late to the game... but I just took my first position FB. My market knowledge tells me not to buy near all time high.

From my point of view FB has the biggest potential to go further because is base purely on software...no more problem with road infrastructure, with hardware, with heavy machines etc etc etc . It has plenty of possibilities to go further like: dating, virtual coins, money transfer (if ti buys revolut it can become easily a bank), or it can add any services on whatsapp like ""call a virtual doctor"" or call a taxi and suddenly the entire planet see it ! On the other hand AMZN looks more safeness and AAPL is like gold for everybody ! Buffet knows better than us !What do you suggest ?"

A price target of $340 on a stock that has a moat, has the potential to become a hardware business with its VR headset, and trades at a significant discount to fair value is being less than fair. Now I'm sure all the yahoo bears are celebrating this downgrade but the simple fact is I'm not worried unless all the sell-side research downgrades FB to a hold.

"Big tech firms to face 6% fines if breach new EU content rulesBRUSSELS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Big tech firms such as Google and Facebook will face fines of up to 6% of turnover if they do not do more to tackle illegal content and reveal more about advertising on their platforms under draft European Union rules.The EU's tough line, which is due to be announced next week, comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny worldwide of tech giants and their control of data and access to their platforms.EU digital chief Thierry Breton, who has stressed that large companies should bear more responsibility, will present the draft rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) on Dec. 15.The Commission document on the DSA seen by Reuters defines very large online platforms as those with more than 45 million users, equivalent to 10% of the EU population.Additional obligations imposed on very large platforms are necessary to address public policy concerns and the systemic risks posed by their services, the document said.The tech giants will have to do more to tackle illegal content such as hate speech and child sexual abuse material, misuse of their platforms that impinges on fundamental rights and intentional manipulation of platforms, such as using bots to influence elections and public health.The companies will be required to publish details of their online advertisers and show the parameters used by their algorithms to suggest and rank information. Independent auditors will monitor compliance, with EU countries enforcing the rules.Facebook declined to comment ahead of publication of the EU document. Google said it had nothing to add at this stage."

"India plans new social media controls after Twitter face-offNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chafing from a dispute with Twitter, India plans to oblige social media companies to erase contentious content fast and assist investigations, according to a draft regulation.New Delhi's planned ""Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code"" - a copy of which was seen by Reuters - come as various nations around the world try to assert tighter control over powerful big media firms.Facebook faced a global backlash from publishers and politicians last week after blocking news feeds in Australia in a dispute with the government over revenue-sharing.In India, Twitter ignored orders to remove content over farmers' protests, fuelling the zeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government since 2018 to tighten regulation for content it deems disinformation or unlawful.The latest draft rules - which would be legally enforcable -say companies should remove content as early as possible, but not later than 36 hours, after a government or legal order.They must also assist in investigations or other cyber security-related incidents within 72 hours of a request. Further, if a post depicts an individual in any sexual act or conduct, then companies must disable or remove such content within a day of receiving a complaint, the rules added."

"Fake ads in Facebook newsfeed on the rise As you probably know, Facebook earns (most of) their revenue from ads.And I’m sure you’ve probably noticed that they’re everywhere!Some scammers are now taking advantage of Facebook’s advertising potential by posting fake ads that are designed to steal your money, your personal information, or both.Most fake ads will show up in your Newsfeed just like the legitimate “Sponsored” posts that we’re all used to seeing. They just won’t have the word “Sponsored” above them.If you see something that appears to be an ad but you don’t see the word “Sponsored” above it, you can be 100% certain that it’s a scam.Other fake ads might show up in the regular advertising section of the sidebar if they were placed via Facebook’s ad platform.Without exception, ALL legitimate ads on Facebook will be marked with the word “Sponsored”. Every one of them.But just because you see the ad is marked as “Sponsored” doesn’t necessarily mean the ad isn’t fraudulent. It simply means the person who posted it is paying Facebook to display it.As always, if an offer sounds to good to be true, it probably is. And on Facebook you can place those odds at pretty close to 100%.If you happen to click or tap on a fake ad you’ll probably be taken to a fraudulent website designed to steal your personal information and credit/debit card info. And it’ll probably download malware on your device as well.Bottom line: Always evaluate any ad you see on Facebook with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially the ones that are displayed in your Newsfeed.And yes, that does include the ads that are clearly marked as “Sponsored”.You can safely assume that any ads that aren’t marked as “Sponsored” are fake without even having to think about it.Carefully analyze exactly what the ad is offering. Does it make sense for the company from a business standpoint? If not, the “offer” is probably a scam.If you have even the slightest doubt about the legitimacy of an ad, don’t click or tap on it."
The rally into FB’s barn burner Q1 earnings has strong and very sexy legs!- Longs should keep nibbling into earnings for huge gains!

"CNBC crew never gives up throwing darts at FB and/or issuing cautionary tales about privacy, regulation etc. I don't watch them every day, but I do tune in most days. Frankly, I don't think any of them know any more than you or I do in terms of whether a stock is going to go up or down unless there's huge news that would obviously indicate it's going one way or the other. Ask yourself this question, ""Have you ever gotten a solid stock pick out of any one of CNBC's regular panel?"" In other words, did they ever tout such-and-such a company at, say, $10 per share and the stock is now selling for $50? I'd like to know if anybody on this message board experienced that situation as a direct result of listening to CNBC? In terms of what's the latest and greatest in the world, I get more solid info from my teenaged grand kids."

I am overly invested in FB. All my gains are short term. If I sell I will have to pay high taxes. If the stock goes down with earnings I m going to go down a lot. I have call options in margin. Not sure how to play. In the past I was not able to do well if I sell and buy in the short term.

"Let's take a closer look at what FB actually does with the data they mine. Before we start, let's make one thing perfectly clear. FB is not mining data looking for someone's SSN or other critical personal information. They mine data to try and get a feel for people's likes and dislikes so they can better position the ads advertisers ask them to place. This is an important distinction because some are under the impression that FB sells the data they mine. They do not.In a nutshell, FB is unlikely to direct an ad for lululemon to middle aged men, and by the same token, an ad for Skil power saws is not going to be directed to single women in their twenties.So when/if our fearless government leaders come up with some regulation, the above will pretty much remain status quo. After all, FB isn't doing anything different than what advertisers have been trying to do for decades; i.e. get their ads in front of the people who have the best chance of buying their product or services.FB does that as well or better than anybody, and given their 2 billion user population, they offer advertisers far more eyes/ears than any newspaper, magazine, TV or radio station can ever hope to do.CA obtained certain FB data illegally. Any company that holds personal data on any of us is subject to the same type of breach. Just goes with the territory in this tech driven age we live in. If you do something on line, what you do is never going to be 100% private, nor will it ever be 100% secure. As Zuck pointed out in his testimony before Congress, there are people in Russia (Probably elsewhere, too.) whose only job is to try and infiltrate various web sites. Even our own IRS has been hacked, and they hold most of our most sensitive information.In the end, our government and others around the world will not issue any sanctions against FB. If anything, they will insist on some form of tighter controls so another CA episode has little chance of recurring. Note, I say ""little chance"" because there is no such thing as ""no chance"". Whatever it is that's suggested or even mandated in terms of security, FB, and everyone else who mines and/or possesses info about us, will eagerly comply. Most important to we FB investors, none of that will impact FB's bottom line. People will still use FB and its other platforms and advertisers will still spend billions of dollars each quarter with them on ads."

"Instagram is ‘most invasive app’, new study showsInstagram has topped a list of “invasive” apps that collect and share users’ data.Cloud storage firm pCloud made the discovery after analysing the recently introduced App Privacy labels that companies are now required to include within Apple’s App Store.The study found that Instagram collects 79 per cent of its users’ personal data and shares it with third parties, including search history, location, contacts and financial info.“Any information you agree to be gathered by an app when signing up can be analysed for their benefit and even shared. Everything from your browsing history, to your location, your banking details, your contact details, and your fitness levels can be valuable for apps to store, use, or sell on,” Ivan Dimitrov, a digital manager at pCloud, wrote in a blog post detailing the research.“With over 1 billion monthly active users it’s worrying that Instagram is a hub for sharing such a high amount of its unknowing users’ data.”The second worst offender for sharing the personal data of its users was Instagram’s parent company, Facebook. The social network gave away 57 per cent of its users’ data to third parties, which can include companies that are associated with the company.Food delivery apps Uber Eats and Deliveroo also scored badly, both featuring in the top 10 alongside LinkedIn, Trainline, YouTube, Duolingo and eBay.By contrast, fellow food delivery apps Just Eat, Grubhub and My McDonald’s were among the few apps that gave away no user data at all.Other apps that protected their users’ data included privacy-centric messaging apps Signal and Telegram, as well as online streaming services BBC iPlayer and Netflix.Apple’s new privacy labels have forced tech companies to publicise exactly how they are tracking people, recently prompting privacy-focussed search engine DuckDuckGo to accuse Google of “spying on users”.After delaying the release of its privacy labels, Google revealed this week that it collects users’ location, financial info, browsing history and audio data.“After months of stalling, Google finally revealed how much personal data they collect in Chrome and the Google app,” stated a post on DuckDuckGo’s Twitter account. “No wonder they wanted to hide it.”When the App Store update was first announced last year, privacy advocates said the new transparency standard was critical for the future of online privacy.“The changes mean people can more easily consider privacy issues when choosing whether or not to buy or download an app,” the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA, who helped push for the new labels.“Safeguarding people’s control over their data is important for protecting privacy as well as for the healthy operation of the market.”"

"U.S. government, states ask judge to deny Facebook's request to dismiss lawsuitsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission and a big group of U.S. states asked a federal court on Wednesday to deny Facebook Inc's request to dismiss major antitrust lawsuits filed against the social media giant in December.The FTC, in its filing, said Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram because Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg believed it was ""a large and viable competitor"" and purchased the messaging app WhatsApp to neutralize a nascent threat. The FTC has asked the court to order Facebook to sell those assets.The states, which had filed a separate antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, said in its filing: ""Deploying a buy-or-bury scheme of predatory acquisitions and exclusionary conduct, Facebook successfully squashes, suppresses, and deters competition, entrenching its monopoly power to this day.""Facebook had asked the court to dismiss the two lawsuits, alleging that they were brought ""in the fraught environment of relentless criticism of Facebook for matters entirely unrelated to antitrust concerns.""It also said that the states, in their case, failed to show that they were harmed by Facebook and that they waited too long.The FTC and states accused Facebook of breaking antitrust law to keep smaller competitors at bay and snapping up rivals, like Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.All told, the federal government and states filed five lawsuits against Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google last year following bipartisan outrage over use and misuse of social media clout both in the economy and the political sphere."

"Senate panel mulls revoking immunity, citing COVID scam adsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans and Democrats criticized social media giants like Facebook on Tuesday for the scam artists on their sites, with one prominent Democrat suggesting a legal change to make them more accountable.Senator Richard Blumenthal, in noting the sale of fake COVID vaccine cards online, said he was willing to discuss amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives platforms immunity for what users put on their site.""The mere selling of those cards is a violation of law and only their immunity protects them,"" Blumenthal said while discussing online platforms in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to discuss oversight of the Federal Trade Commission.The FBI said in late March that the unauthorized use of a government seal, like that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a crime.Blumenthal noted that Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who is als on the committee, has also called for Section 230 to be reformed.""There should be another takeaway from this hearing, which is that if Ted Cruz and Richard Blumenthal can agree on excessive power and abuse of power by ad giants, there will be some action, and that includes Section 230,"" Blumenthal said.Lawmakers - both Republican and Democrat - also discussed passing legislation that would undo a potential loss at the Supreme Court, which could rule that the FTC overstepped its authority when seeking ill-gotten gains from those accused of deceptive practices. The FTC, which cannot bring criminal charges, has said a ruling against it would curtail its ability to undo damage done by scam artists."

"Facebook’s suggestion to reform internet law is a ‘masterful distraction,’ says Silicon Valley congresswoman • Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to offer at a congressional hearing on Thursday his own suggestion for reforming the legal shield that protects his platform from liability for users’ posts. • But two House Democrats said Wednesday that it’s nothing more than a red herring. • Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district includes Silicon Valley, called Zuckerberg’s proposal a “masterful distraction” during a virtual press conference.At his fourth congressional testimony since July, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to offer his own suggestion for reforming the legal shield that protects his platform from liability for users’ posts. But two House Democrats said Wednesday that it’s nothing more than a red herring.Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district includes Silicon Valley, called Zuckerberg’s proposal a “masterful distraction” during a virtual news conference Wednesday. Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., said it’s “a classic example of Facebook hoping that we miss the point.”Zuckerberg suggested that platforms should be held accountable based on their general adherence to best practices for addressing unlawful content, rather than for individual posts that slip through the cracks. He wrote that the adequacy of the moderation systems should depend on the size of the platform and be set by a third party.Eshoo and Malinowski disagreed, and offered their own approach to reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in a bill they reintroduced on Wednesday.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been pushing to change the law, considered foundational for the internet, to remove some of its protections for the largest of the tech giants. But tech advocates say even seemingly small changes could disrupt services that all internet users have come to rely on.Eshoo and Malinowski’s “Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act” seeks to take a narrow approach to reform. The bill would remove immunity under Section 230 in cases where a platform’s algorithm has amplified or recommended a post directly relevant to a case involving acts of international terrorism or civil rights violations.Malinowski said the idea of the bill is to focus on the root problem, which is a business model that relies on convincing users to spend more time on the site, even if that means promoting inflammatory or divisive content. He said that Facebook seeks to distract from this basic model.“They want us to focus on putting out fires, and not on the fact that their product is flammable,” he said. “Facebook’s algorithms cause the spread of the very content that they are then forced to remove. And so what we are trying to do in this bill is to focus the attention of Congress on how the engine actually works.”Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who co-authored Section 230 in the 1990s, similarly criticized Zuckerberg’s suggestions for reform in a statement. Wyden has remained cautious about attempts to alter the bill he helped write, and accused Zuckerberg of using the suggestions for his own gain.“Mark Zuckerberg knows that rolling back Section 230 will cement Facebook’s position as the dominant social media company and make it vastly harder for new startups to challenge his cash cow,” Wyden said in the statement. “Everyone working to address real issues online should be deeply wary about Mark Zuckerberg’s proposals for new regulations.”Wyden referenced Facebook’s support of SESTA-FOSTA, a package that was passed into law in 2018 to remove liability protection for sites that hosted solicitations of sex work or trafficking. The law essentially shuttered parts of the internet and sex work advocates have claimed it has made the industry less safe.He also critiqued his fellow lawmakers for hosting several hearings with the same CEOs.“Zuckerberg’s testimony is another reminder that Congress can’t craft smart tech policy if it keeps holding hearings featuring the same three big tech CEOs,” he said. “Pretending the internet is only Facebook, Twitter and Google will lead to laws that ensure that’s the result.”Eshoo and Malinowski made two key changes to this iteration of their bill to focus it more directly on the largest social media platforms. First, they lowered the small business exemption from platforms with less than 50 million users to those with less than 10 million. And second, they added an exemption for internet infrastructure companies, like those that store data, provide cybersecurity or web hosting services, since they are not the main targets of the reform."

"U.S. lawmakers to introduce antitrust bills to protect news mediaWASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers led by Senator Amy Klobuchar and Representative David Cicilline will introduce legislation on Wednesday aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.The bill comes not long after Facebook had a pitched battle with Australia over how much publishers should make from their social media pages. During the fight, Facebook blacked out Australian news pages and only restored them once the government granted concessions.

"The thing about FB stock is that even though it hasn't provided much of a return over the past 2 years (aside from those who got in after the major drop in 2018), it could easily double or even triple within a 1-2 year period if they figure out how to monitize WhatsApp; kind of like how MSFT didn't return much for years but then tripled within 2-3 years. Definitely a stock worth holding long term."
somebody needs to look at fb it should be at least 200 by now
I hate facebook i got off that boomer site long ago. People seem to enjoy being marketed too and looking at photo shopped or filtered pics of random strangers weird... new apps will take FB place as change is the only constant
People sold their shares based on something that happened 3 years ago and was resolved 3 years ago. Makes no sense.

"Instagram for kids met a hostile responseFacebook’s plan to create Instagram for users under the age of 13 faces hurdles from lawmakers wanting the tech giant to keep its distance from children – and the fact that many children under 13 are already using the regular Instagram app.The issue was brought to light this week, in the form of a letter sent by Democratic lawmakers to the company that raises new questions about plans recently announced by Facebook for an Instagram-branded product designed for children under. 13 years old. Users under the age of 13 are currently prohibited. to join one of the company’s platforms.The letter follows a congressional hearing last month in which lawmakers on both sides bombarded Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg with questions about the plan, claiming that heavy use of the platforms was unhealthy for young people.“Facebook and Instagram are in the crosshairs, and they should be,” said Jim Steyer, founder of Common Sense Media, an advocacy group that promotes the safe use of technology for families. He cited research findings that found heavy use of social media can harm adolescent mental health in certain circumstances. “Given Facebook and Instagram’s privacy and security backgrounds, would you let them be your children’s babysitters?"

"UK Competition Watchdog Begins Facebook Probe Over Data UsageThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Britain's antitrust watchdog, is planning an investigation into how Facebook handles user data, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Friday (March 19), citing sources.The CMA's investigation into Facebook follows similar competition probes into Google and Apple earlier this month. The U.K. competition custodian is looking into allegations that Facebook tapped user data to sidestep rivals in social media and digital advertising.The U.K. probe is similar to the investigation launched by Brussels into how the Silicon Valley social media giant runs its Marketplace portal. Britain’s probe will also include Facebook’s Marketplace policies. The official announcement of the CMA’s investigation and its components are subject to change, the sources told FT. The inspection is said to stem from the CMA’s digital advertising report that indicated Facebook benefited from a “strong incumbency advantage,” per the report.Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said in February that tech companies like Google and Facebook would be slapped with several competition investigations. He also said he will collaborate with Brussels. A general crackdown on Big Tech is also being launched via the competition authority’s new digital regulation division, the Digital Markets Unit (DMU). The DMU, which will be enacted by legislation, will be tasked with creating and enforcing codes of conduct for Big Tech companies.Facing numerous competition lawsuits in the U.S. by state attorneys general in almost all 50 states as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Facebook made a move last week to have the legal proceedings dismissed. The FTC and the States are expected to answer the motions in April."

"In case anybody was curious to know how much cash FB, it's $61 billion with a B. This company won't be nearly as vulnerable to rising rates because it actually trades on fundamentals, has real earnings, cash flows, and a solid balance sheet. If you're worried about rising rates over the short term you should be rotating into mega tech names like this and out of the high beta stocks with no real earnings, which will get battered with rising rates. This and the other FAANGS plus ADBE are now safe plays when the times get rough for growth stocks. So I've been rotating more of my money towards the FAANG names as of late."

They don't realize how out of touch with reality they are...analysts aren't concerned about the latest data breach...I have never made money listening to the bears and those who tell you to let your morals dictate your investments. I have lots of money from investing in FB in 2013...people who detest this company will tell me I'm corrupt....I would rather be rich and corrupt than poor and resentful. Thumbs down all you like...the kool aid you bears are drinking is going to run out soon and reality will hit you in the face like a cold Arctic wind. Long term FB goes to $500, not $100."

"Essential poll: two-thirds of Australians say government should regulate Facebook and GoogleA majority of Australians want the government to regulate the digital behemoths, and voters also support moves to make Facebook and Google pay for mainstream media content, according to the Guardian Essential poll.The latest fortnightly survey of 1,034 voters shows three in five Australians (59%) agree that Facebook and Google have too much power and should be regulated by the government, with 13% of respondents disagreeing with that proposition.A similar percentage (57%) believes Facebook and Google should be required to pay media outlets for distributing their news content, with 15% disagreeing.Voters were also asked whether websites should face limitations on the amount of personal information about users they collect (73% agreed with that proposition), and whether they thought systems that monitor web activity to target advertising and communications to users should be illegal (63% supported that idea).The Morrison government is expected to use the final parliamentary sitting fortnight to introduce legislation giving effect to a new code forcing Google and Facebook to pay for the value they receive from the distribution of Australian journalism.The proposal is expected to be introduced to parliament next week."

This represents a hard narrowing of demographics unfortunately$TWTR is now the second to the bottom of number of users (343M) of the ranked social media entities. $FB has 2,740M as the top dog.

Shopping mall sales down again compared to previous year and online shopping up 30%-50%.. On top of that, many young folks are opening their own online business..... so who benefits from this booming trend. The answer is ~~~> FACEBOOK"

Facebook is NOT I repeat NOT ESG compliant due to censorship and interference in elections worldwide. Do not invest in this company they pollute.
Thank you Credit Suisse for the upgrade from $230 to $232. Once FB goes into payments with Whatsapp and Messenger stock will double. Look at WeChat in China.

"I bought in at 178 and thought I missed it. So pain isn't that bad. But I feel bad for those that got in late near the highs for the ER play. So what should you do.MY ANAYSIS: This is a massive company with billions of users and has tons of cash. They are in the process of re inventing them selves. I expect moves to be made in the future. FB DATING is coming, maybe movie streaming, sports betting is another option. Also WhatsApp and FB messenger are still in trial for monetization and FB Stories is growing.I think the future is dark at the moment but as they say, buy on fear. This company will survive and once again find ways to grow. So hold. You haven't lost a penny until you sell."
Is everyone winning? This is the cheapest it will get before earnings. So load up and make some money.
"So I checked with a bunch of older people and they use FB every day, younger adults use FB infrequently but use Instagram and Messenger all the time, people who travel use Whats App and all the other apps.

"Done with Facebook and censorship, selling the stock and deleting my account, enough is enough"
FB is the cheapest growth stock in the S&P 500 and is schedule to report even greater growth on next week’s Q1 earnings report!
We expect second quarter 2021 year-over-year total revenue growth to remain stable or modestly acceleraterelative to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2021. That mean 40% growth or more
Such a important and good stance by Facebook to take action against right wing ideologies on their platform. Right wingers should not be allowed to have social medias at all. Their constant assault on democracy is a threat to us all. Some might say censorship but I say standing up for what is right. We likely hit $500 later this year.
"I mean a former high profile FB Exec (Chamath) is short the stock that should tell you everything.Secondly Google just announced (and Chamath tweeted) that they will no longer track people on their search putting pressure of FB to do the same.And lastly, no ESG fund will touch this even at a relative discpunt to other big tech.So i dont see why this isnt trading around $200 per share???"

"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration. Give it to them."

"'Your business model is the problem': tech CEOs grilled over role in Capitol attackThe CEOs of America’s biggest technology companies faced a grilling from Congress about the 6 January insurrection at the Capitol, as protesters outside the hearing denounced the platforms for playing a role in fueling the violence.Sundar Pichai of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Jack Dorsey of Twitter on Thursday were called to testify before two committees of the House of Representatives on social media’s role in promoting extremism and misinformation.Protesters who had gathered outside the Capitol building ahead of the hearing portrayed the tech executives as the violent insurrectionists whose images went viral in the days after the 6 January riots.“The platforms’ inability to deal with the violence, hate and disinformation they promote on their platforms shows that these companies are failing to regulate themselves,” said Emma Ruby-Sachs, the executive director of SumofUs, the human rights organization behind the protests. “After the past five years of manipulation, data harvesting and surveillance, the time has come to rein in big tech.”Lawmakers opened the hearing by criticizing the platforms for their role in the 6 January violence, as well as in the spread of medical misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine.“You failed to meaningfully change after your platform has played a role in fomenting insurrection and abetting the spread of the virus and trampling American civil liberties,” said the Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, chair of the energy and commerce committee. “Your business model itself has become the problem and the time for self-regulation is over. It’s time we legislate to hold you accountable,” he added.“You’re not passive bystanders – you are not nonprofits or religious organizations that are trying to do a good job for humanity – you’re making money,” Pallone later said. “The point we’re trying to make today is that when you spread misinformation, when extremists are actively promoted and amplified, you do it because you make more money.”“The witnesses here today have demonstrated time and time again, that self-regulation has not worked,” echoed Jan Schakowsky, the Democratic representative from Illinois. “They must be held accountable for allowing disinformation and misinformation to spread.”"

"India antitrust watchdog orders probe into WhatsApp's new privacy policyNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's competition watchdog on Wednesday ordered a probe into a WhatsApp privacy policy update, saying the Facebook Inc-owned messaging service had breached antitrust laws.The update announced in January, which will take effect in May, allows WhatsApp to share some user data with Facebook and its units, prompting a global backlash including in India, its biggest market with more than 500 million users.The 21-page antitrust order came as WhatsApp is expanding its digital payment services to millions of Indians.The Competition Commission of India said WhatsApp had violated competition laws ""through its exploitative and exclusionary conduct ... in the garb of policy update.""It ordered its investigation unit to launch a probe and submit a report within 60 days. Such probes typically take several months.WhatsApp's sharing of data in a way that is ""neither fully transparent nor based on voluntary and specific user consent,"" appears unfair to users, the watchdog added.In India, users concerned about privacy have downloaded rival apps such as Signal and Telegram, according to data from research firms."

"India Wants Court to Block WhatsApp’s Controversial Privacy Rule(Bloomberg) -- India’s federal government has urged a Delhi court to restrain Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp from implementing a controversial privacy policy, intensifying pressure on the popular messaging service in its biggest market by users.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in a filing to the Delhi High Court alleged that WhatsApp Inc.’s proposed policy violates India’s technology laws on several counts, said advocate Meghan, who goes by one name. The lawyer had earlier petitioned the court challenging the messaging app’s new norms. A spokeswoman for WhatsApp declined to comment.The court filing underscores the growing tussle between WhatsApp and the government of its most important market. The company is already facing challenges over the countrywide rollout of its payment service and has to contend with new guidelines that could require it to break its encryption to identify originators of unlawful messages on its platform.India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had earlier expressed concern over the altered privacy policy and in an email asked WhatsApp to withdraw the changes that have implications for Indian users’ freedom of choice.WhatsApp’s privacy policy violates the country’s information technology laws as it fails to specify the nature of user data being collected or notify users about it, according to the filing. It also does not guarantee that third parties getting user data will maintain confidentiality."
Can we all just breathe a collective sigh of relief that Zuck told the market about the changes BEFORE the print??? THANK GOD.
FB is your grandma's social media. No one under 70 posts there
how about some sgmd check it out a microcap pot stock based in California!
short FB now!
Tomorrow watch it will go up $9
"Great action today, value value value here. Love the action"
Facebook does not support child hormone blockers and that's not ok
The consolidation level at 160 which was serving as support is now serving as a resistant. The next support level is 150.
"Best for growth, best valued, and most independent if China stock! Did you see their latest earnings; They were fabulous, just fantastic! Stick is worth $300!"

"I do not use Facebook but I sure like buying and selling the stock , 330 and I am out again"
Still a buy right now??
"FB stock price now OVERSOLD, technically FB should see a short term bounce from here. FB $280.00 in 2018"
This stock is fixing to breakout to new all time highs
I am planning to sell some position cos of the law suite and all. Any advise? Thanks
Tomorrow we celebrate a real party. Cheers.
here comes the massive crash. nothing but fake bots on their platform and fake bots pumping their stock. what a bunch of crooks.
This should be -12% like Twatter
"17 Billion in cash. Healthy balance sheet. Growing earnings. Fb dating app. Oculus. Instagram. Huge moat. You might hate this company for whatever reason, but how often do you go to Facebook each day? Billions are addicted to this service.. Its not going to change anytime soon."
Once earning is out.. this will plunge down to $250. That’s only when I will close my short
The WOKE like Bitcoin because it has no history.
"Libra is a win/win for FB investors. FB knows how to make things right. If Libra stays with FB it is a win for FB investors. If Libra is separated from FB it will be sold for a high premium, also a win for FB investors. FB knows how to make things right."

I'm impressed at how well Facebook has held over the past few weeks with all other techs down. Solid company.

$msft $fb $goog $amzn Nice day for big techs. Seems like enterprise value going up with market caps since a few days.
"I can't believe people are honestly still consistently trying to short FB with its recent run and all the positives which surround it. If you're shorting any of the FANG stocks, you're already betting against a stacked house. 3 out of 4 times longs will benefit."
"Was hoping, after Friday's $5.00+ drop, we'd be up more than 30 cents in pre-market. Dunno. Despite good numbers, tech is out of favor now. Don't know what it's gonna take to get FB anywhere near those lofty price targets. Obviously, good earnings ain't doing the trick. JMHO, but if Zuck stepped a side, or at minimum, took a less visible position within the company, that might be interpreted as a good sign by WS."
stay long...fb = up over %150++ in the last 5 years and growing nicely....this side move bs will go away!!...nice bounce over $310 next week!!!!!
The CIA need to investigate all foreign national partners of CEOS of major companies critical to America’s security. JMHO.
"The biggest concern is that even though people still keep their Facebook account, many have stopped posting /updating and they are spending less time on it. The lower engagement level means less traffic, and less traffic is not good for advertisement revenue. Unlike a TV station that makes good shows to draw advertisers, Facebook relies 100 percent on ""user generated content"". If people don't post, then there is less traffic, and less traffic is bad for ad revenue."

Still a BUY FB has a lot more upside
"FB is, by far; the top “value stock in FANG and the S&P for a megacap stock of Its size!"
FB truth is not my truth.
Okay its getting up there
WOW. FB=$300!533M leak can only drive price higher!
"Bad move by Zuck to censor #45. Not once, but twice. #45 isn't happy. Call me crazy, but if told the 70+ million who voted for him to close their FB accounts to get even with social media's bias, I bet most of them would. Zuck seems to have forgotten the cardinal rule for any business owner, ""Never #$%$ off your customers!""."
My advice to GOPer's at least pretend you are a man.
"Full list. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Snapchat, Instagram, Shopify, Reddit, twitch, YouTube, tiktok, Pinterest."
I had fun today...how about you shorts??
This time we can finally hit over $200. Let the New Years rally continue up to earnings on Jan 31. The 21% new corporate tax rate will help all techs this year.
"FB is propaganda for the dnc . . . Nothing but censorship . .,get way before they drag down your money!"

Sold my short for a small 4.5% profit today and was amazed it dropped 3%
One day Facebook will be $1000 and you will have wished you bought this at $295.75.
Earnings already baked in. Exactly why FB hardly ever moves after each quarterly report. The only thing that would make this load move would be a stellar announcement. It's a social media platform with zero overhead. There's nothing stellar about this company.
"$175 coming up, $156 yesterday at this time was a bargain...."

"Would be a good sign if FB can finish this Friday at $180 or higher. Might be tough as the MMs and shorts have a vested interest in a sub-$180 finish, but FB has finished above a benchmark option number before, so here's crossing my fingers and hoping a finish north of $180 happens today. Of course, I'm assuming the jobs number that comes out today is good and the market doesn't sell off if it turns out to be less than what WS was expecting."
beeing up 6% after earnings is huge for big cap like FB
FB is connecting people. this teleporting thing isn’t that far off.
"ER beats estimating as usual, go fb!"
Ban others because your truth is not the same sounds like FB is wanting a war they can not win.

"All will be better by the end of this week!!! Market reacts and will counter react, all in all fb is huge and instagram is worth a qtr of fb"
"Three years ago this week the news of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal broke, a seminal event that launched an onslaught of scrutiny and oversight of both Facebook and the technology sector; that single event has crippled and hobbled the company, especially regarding share price, and prevented it from growing aggressively over the last several years. Zuckerberg and Sandberg, the management duopoly effectively running this entire company, have attempted to burnish the reputation of the company through an aggressive PR campaign for the past several years, but the campaign has not worked. Facebook has lost an enormous amount of market respect, and, most importantly, Zuckerberg and Sandberg are reviled in the market and lack favorable public sentiment. The only way to restore the reputation of this company and to reconfirm its place as a true growth company is to install a new management team; fresh leadership sends a message to the market that the players responsible for the data privacy scandal have been held accountable. More importantly, a new management team to lead this company into the future tells the market it’s not afraid to change and it’s serious about growth. I believe this change will push the share price to the $350 price point.Sent from my iPhone"

"Just my monthly post for those that don't fully understand FB model. We own a large franchising company. When we advertise on FB our units (stores) revenue increases on average by 33%, our customer acquisition cost has declined by around 85% vs. TV, Radio and Print. FB for us at least is the greatest advertising model every created. Good luck to all whether long or short!"

"FB is consolidating its gains at base camp before the next breakout to the summit and beyond!*** FB’s Q1 earnings report in 3 weeks will really blow the roof off the top, opening the pathway for a run at $350 to $400.- Let’s just say the pathway to $350 and $400 will be at warp speed compared to the trek from $200 to $300!"

"Facebook says it could still ban Canadians from sharing news as government eyes regulationFacebook is not ruling out banning Canadians from sharing news on its platform and says it will voluntarily report revenues and promote journalism in the country ahead of what could be a contentious regulatory battle with Ottawa.The company made the controversial decision to remove news sharing on its platform in Australia just as that country moved to make digital platforms pay news organizations for content.“It is never going to be something that we would want to do, unless we really have no choice,” said Kevin Chan, Facebook Canada’s public policy director, during testimony at the House of Commons heritage committee on Monday.“Our unfortunate response to an unworkable piece of legislation (in Australia) ... was that we had to exit the market, and that’s what happened,” he told Liberal MP Julie Dabrusin after she questioned him about Facebook cutting off access to information during a pandemic.The hearing on Monday featured some testy exchanges between Chan and the MPs who are examining government regulations and how they could impact Facebook. There were also the revelations that soon, Facebook would begin reporting revenue to the Canada Revenue Agency and more information around the deals it hopes to strike with Canadian media organizations.Meanwhile, Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault is looking to enact laws that would ensure media companies are paid by digital platforms. The rules are expected to be similar to those in Australia.Many in the media industry, including Torstar, which owns the Toronto Star, have lobbied for government intervention and said that most online advertising revenue has been siphoned off by digital giants such as Google and Facebook, threatening the survival of journalism.In February, Facebook cut users off from sharing news just as Australia was moving to enshrine new laws that would force digital platforms into binding arbitration if an agreement with news companies about compensation couldn’t be reached."

"""Facebook's Big Win""Jun. 19, 2019 2:18 PM ET|Daniel Jones""The management team at Facebook just announced a significant win for the company: plans to dive into cryptocurrency and online transactions. This move paves the way for the firm to capitalize off of its massive user base and serve the unbanked simultaneously."" Check out the numbers. *Taken from McKinsey & Company""While those statistics are staggering, what’s even bigger is the size of the industry that does exist today. According to a study done by McKinsey & Company last year (covering through 2017), the global payments processing industry was worth $1.9 trillion in revenue in 2017. By 2022, this is forecasted to grow to $2.9 trillion. Of the $3.09 trillion in global digital commercial volumes completed in 2017, 31% were completed through mobile apps. In the category of cross-border flows (including e-commerce), flows of between $400 billion and $500 billion occurred between consumers, and a further $700 billion to $950 billion went from consumers to businesses. Even capturing a small amount of this global industry could allow the company, over time, to add significantly to its revenue which, in 2018, came out to $55.84 billion."" ""As of the end of its latest quarter, Facebook had 2.38 billion MAUs (monthly active users) and 1.56 billion DAUs (daily active users). By incorporating a digital wallet onto its platform and enabling users to send and receive money without significant risks regarding capital losses, the social networking giant is effectively serving to bring blockchain and cryptocurrency mainstream. Yes, there will be certain risks the company has to contend with here, but so long as management can navigate those things, the long-term prospects for the company are material."" Facebook's Libra cryto-currency is going be much bigger than any analysts projections impacting worldwide. Facebook is the KING!"

Seriously FB has a lot of enemies all around...We need an extraordinary patience."

"FB traded up around 200 posting great earnings without crypto news. And now just back up to where it is. Crypto news is not built into the stock. Its another $5 Billion new revenue in the making for FB and skies the limit as FB has proven to be able to create new businesses and add new revenue stream with it's suite of businessess from instagram, WhatsApp, its FB Messenger, Oculus. Its ad revenue is accelerating while Google's revenue is declining as the most recent quarter revealed. FB is the KING!"

"Question for all, do you see FB or NVIDIA as the better long term hold?"
"Facebook clearly enjoys ad pricing power on it's massive social networking platform. Advertisers seem to allocate more dollars chasing large consumer clusters. However, ad monetization rates or rates leading to actual sales are flat to slightly up. The question is why Facebook do not publish data on actual sale growth rates by advertisers from advertising on it's platform."
y'all ready for it to go down...I'm bout to buy!
"FB hasn't gone down any of these lawsuits by the government to break it up because long term they know the government won't win. Regulation isn't going to destroy this company's prospects. Any selloff should be bought. This company is inexpensive at these levels along with GOOGL and is sitting on a mountain of cash with enormous free cash flow and big earnings growth. Ultimately more acquisitions will occur down the line and this company will only get bigger. Governments hate successful companies, and especially ones that are game changers the way FB is. You can hate this company for moral reasons but from a business standpoint it is a cash machine and a winner."

"Drugs for Sale Plague Social Media PlatformsWASHINGTON, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media platforms continue to have difficulty removing illegal offers of opioids, steroids and COVID-19 ""vaccines."" Even after they have been alerted of specific posts and long past when they have made public pledges to do a better job of making their services safe for U.S. consumers, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram are not backing their words with action, new research from the Digital Citizens Alliance (Digital Citizens) and the Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) shows.The Digital Weeds 2021 report revisited past research conducted by Digital Citizens and CSW to determine if social media platforms have truly addressed illicit activity that was brought to their attention. Researchers searched for old posts and previous users who were attempting to conduct illegal activity. In some cases, the research teams found accounts and similar posts from the same users, whose posts were taken down years earlier, still up on the platforms. In some cases, the research teams found current accounts and similar posts from the same users who were identified years earlier.In addition, researchers also found that the fraudulent sale of COVID-19 vaccines, which was identified by DCA and CSW in February, remains despite calls for action by Facebook's Advisory Board to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and related dangers.""I find it amazing that the platforms have the ability to pinpoint a 47-year-old resident of Walla Walla, Washington who might be interested in buying retro-styled, minor league baseball caps from teams of the 1950s, but can't figure out a way to stop the posts pushing illegal and/or illicit activities on their pages,"" said Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin. ""The platforms have had a chance to correct this problem. How much more evidence do we need to present before lawmakers say, 'enough is enough' and take the action the platforms themselves have not been able to take?""Both Google and Facebook, once enormously popular, respected companies, are increasingly questioned by consumers as well as federal and state regulators for their business practices. But a lot remains the same: • Criminal activity and/or illicit activity highlighted in previous research, such as the selling of opioids, steroids, and malware, can still be found easily today. • Many videos and posts shared in prior DCA and CSW reports and/or with media contacts are still available across numerous social media platforms. • The platforms still have advertising from premium, respected brands running next to videos and/or posts for illegal and/or illicit item. • The platforms allow for communication between drug pushers and potential buyers. Whether by containing phone numbers and emails in videos and/or posts or allowing for conversations to happen in chats. • The platforms' algorithms amplify connectivity between potential buyers and sellers of illegal and/or illicit items. Researchers, acting as potential buyers looking for drugs, showed that when they look for drugs on Instagram, Instagram will in turn begin directing drug sellers back to the potential buyer. • When outed by media outlets, platforms will often take down specific videos mentioned by reporters, but not address the larger problem. This leaves consumers vulnerable to similar, or sometimes even the same scams, that inspired the news coverage in the first place.Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, President of the Coalition for a Safer Web, added: ""Our report is another abject proofpoint that so long as social media companies are unregulated and left to run wild, consumers will be exposed to the criminal web marketplace opened by extremists and terrorists hawking illicit, dangerous drugs to fund their organizations and operations. Until Congress acts, both the FDA (by issuing formal warning letters prohibiting the sale of illegal drugs) and the FTC (by prohibiting criminal operations on social media companies) must step in immediately to protect the American people?"""
Sammy Jung....it's down over 4.5% on the day and 31% from its high....should everyone still relax as they lose money? lmao
FB is currently in oversold territory — just 2 weeks out from W1 earnings report!- Today’s decline presents a great buying opportunity in one of the best growth businesses of our time!
Looking goood baby let’s keep going
only faang below 30pe and strong growth / balance sheet
"Damn in this overvalued market, FB is just the one stock not overvalued, look at forward P/E and PEG Ratio, compare it to the other big tech stocks. #$%$ buying another 10 shares :)"
"Looking look a possible double top coming, but we will see soon enough. FB is doing better then I thought it would, might have sold to soon today."
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
"Congrats to all of you FB longs who did not panic and sell when, if you were like me, your stomach was churning for the better part of the past two weeks. We all feel a whole lot better now, I'm sure. With about forty minutes to go, it looks like we'll end the day north of $160. Hopefully from there we'll start a nice orderly rise upwards. Gotta tell you, this roller coaster ride we've been on is not one I'm hoping to repeat any time soon."
Here comes the sell off
"Is Prince Jared Kushner, a Rothchild?Matthew Lohr, will be looking into a possibleconnection via his up coming website."
"Note: it's not bad to take profit sometimes.Do know that restrictions could be lifted any time and it could lead to less usage of FB. Personally I always use Whatsapp, and they probably make money selling my data to engines. FB buying Whatsapp was a good move."
"Accumulated 2400 sh around Feb 2016 market correction at averaged around 100, went up to 216. Didn't sell a share. Pretty regretful at 130 last December, only sold 300 share. Now huge relief. Believe the business story, so just didn't look the screen for few months, and that turns out the best strategy. Patience is one of the virtues in investment."
This stock is too safe.Really i feel more afraid to let my money in a mutual fund than here
so this is where all the q-bags hang out with their 1-2 shares of fb stock :)
time to repeal the 230 and put Face Block give notice to that PIN HEAD
FB will be under $190.00 by July.
Should be 330 tomorrow-excellent qtr!
This is not a breakout.. this is a top! Giving us a last chance to short it hard
FB is a joke. Look how the CEO and staff censor anything they disagree with. FB does not have any leaders. They are childish in censoring a former president but allowing criminals to select fake IDs and allow them to spread lies and propaganda. FB has no control and is a very childish company.
Only sorry non patriot athiests invest in freedom killing social media.

"Wow a $10 increase, am I supposed to be impressed?"
TAKE A LOOK AT THE 1 YEAR CHART OF FACE BOOK. AFTER THAT. ARE YOU CRAZY. TAKE PROFITS AND BUY BACK.

Guys ! Wait Till The ^^FB^^ Money Hits The Market !!!Looking For $300 In 2020 !!!!!!!!!!!!Oh Yes !!!!!!!!:):):)
FB still trades in the value zone as its Q1 revenues and profit growth exceeds its PEG.
anyone who thinks the stock will...should or could be up tomorrow...or even in a week or month...or even y months...please give a basic explanation why after you listen and comprehend the conference call
"Earnings and revenue have grown on average over 45% the past 8 years. This quarter just solidified that we will see this trend continue, this is a 700 billion dollar stock. Put a 30% eps growth for this year from last year and P/E at 700 billion market cap is only 25."
Last time it went over 300 just to go back to the 200s. This time we're gonna stay over 300
"Ever since I was all-in at 154 and all-out at 293, this stock has never back to even 280, now it is 290, I think it is time to get in, FB is the only FAANG that has not received massive attention until now. The adv problem is solved, only bull can happen from now on!"
FB is now a part of the media wing of the socialist govt. and will be used to spy on and report anybody that opposes the party. FB will be rewarded greatly. BUY!
Can anyone explained why Nasdaq has been red all day and now is turning green as we approach end of day?

"Russia rebukes Facebook for blocking some media postsMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused Facebook on Monday of violating citizens' rights by blocking some media outlets' content in the latest standoff between a government and Big Tech.Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor at the weekend threatened Facebook with a minimum 1 million rouble ($13,433) fine and demanded it restore access to content posted by TASS news agency, RBC business daily and Vzglyad newspaper.It said Facebook blocked posts pertaining to Russia's detention of alleged supporters of a Ukrainian far-right group.""I think this is unacceptable. It violates our national legislation,"" said Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament and a member of President Vladimir Putin's United Russia ruling party.In a statement, Volodin said Facebook had violated basic rights to disseminate and receive information, and legislation would be proposed to preserve Russia's ""digital sovereignty.""Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Like other nations, including Australia in a high-profile dispute with Facebook and India in a spat with Twitter, Russia has in recent months taken steps to regulate and curb the power of big social media companies.Bills passed in December allow Russia to impose large fines on platforms that do not delete banned content and to restrict access to U.S. social media companies if they are deemed to discriminate against Russian media.""They operate in our environment but at the same time they often don't obey any Russian laws,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told RIA news agency on Monday."

I don't need to see a heart doctor. If the old ticker can handle the wild price swings of FB without going kaput, I guess it's in good shape. Who knows what we'll see today? Handsomely green in pre-market right now, but black clouds abound. Thus far, FB has ticked off its own users by censoring, the pols, most of Europe, Australia, India and now, Russia.

It will be integrated with Facebook's Pages to enable publishing across multimedia formats including photos, live videos and stories style updates.The idea is that writers can earn through subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community.Facebook will allow them to create Groups for their work as well, and also provide metrics on their newsletters. To pilot the program, Facebook plans to pay to help get the tools to build actual websites, in addition to newsletters, off the ground. Moreover, the company will look to add monetization tools later."

"very dangerous zone facebook is about to break , i hope not so i can buy more. When i bought at June of 2019 at price of 186. I made a promise, not sell before 5 years time and only buy more if the yearly compound return is less than 20%. My goal was to make 20% per year by owning the stock that means 2.5 time the money in five year time. So till June i can only buy at 223 and then after June at 267. I find it hard to have this opportunity but i think following the rules in investing is very important"

"Sen. Warner to unveil bill that strips Section 230 protection from Facebook and Google Sen. Mark R. Warner is set to introduce a bill that could hold Facebook, Google and other tech giants more directly accountable when viral posts and videos result in real-world harm.The measure is dubbed the Safe Tech Act, and it marks the latest salvo from congressional lawmakers against Section 230. The decades-old federal rules help facilitate free expression online, but Democrats including Warner (Va.) say they also allow the most profitable tech companies to skirt responsibility for hate speech, election disinformation and other dangerous content spreading across the Web.The senator’s proposal aims to preserve the thrust of Section 230, which generally spares a wide array of website operators from being held liable for what their users say. Instead, it opens an easier legal pathway for Web users to seek court orders and file lawsuits if posts, photos and videos — and the tech industry’s refusal to police them — threaten them personally with abuse, discrimination, harassment, the loss of life or other irreparable harm.“How can we continue to give this get-out-of-jail card to these platforms that constantly do nothing to address the foreseeable, obvious and repeated misuse of their products and services to cause harm? That was kind of our operating premise,” Warner said.Ultimately, it would be up to a judge to decide the merits of these claims; the bill mostly opens the door for Web users to argue their cases without running as much risk of having them dismissed early. Facebook, Google, Twitter and other social media sites stand to lose these highly coveted federal protections under Warner’s bill only in the case of abusive paid content, such as online advertisements, that seek to defraud or scam customers.“You shouldn’t get immunity from this advertising content that’s providing you revenue,” said Warner, who is introducing the measure along with Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Mazie Hirono (Hawaii)."

"Some Reasons To Stay Calm:1. Usually when the Market hears something they don't want to hear, they over reacts.2. Much of the AH selling really wasn't due to people assessing the situation and deducing what to do. To the contrary, most of it was due to AI programs that automatically buy or sell when certain criteria is met. Think robots without a brain.3. FB did beat earnings ($1.74 vs. Estimates of $1.72). But we all knew, Wall Street as well, that at some point FB was gonna report a good quarter but one that didn't blow away numbers as we perhaps have been spoiled to expect.4. FB also pretty much came in on the number with revenues, too; $13.23 vs. expected $13.36. Ask yourself, three months ago you were asked to give your guess as to what FB's revenues would be over Q2, and you guessed $13.36 billion and the final answer was $13.23 billion, are you really gonna beat yourself over the head and call yourself a total loser. hey, boys and girls, we're talking billions of dollars here. If your guess ended up being as close as the results were, I'd say you'd be patting yourself on the back.5. And remember, all these estimated numbers are guesses. Someone's opinion. If they were hard and true benchmarks that denoted passing or failing, then the naysayers would have a point. Like in school when a grade of 70 was passing. Either you achieved 70 or better or you did not. The benchmark was a pre-established hard floor with no room for variance.6. Finally, for whatever reason, FB's forward looking statements have followed a pattern over the years. They make tons of money but somehow the brass (Zuck and the CFO) feel compelled to temper any enthusiasm with cautious tales. Pretty much did the same thing yesterday.So what to do, what to do? You do what the smart people did last March. You don't panic and sell. You might do that if FB was forecasting losses or losing market share to an up and coming competitor. Neither is the case here. Fact is, just the opposite is true. FB, and its other social media platforms, dominate, both individually and collectively, all the other sites (TWTR, SNAP etc.) combined. The pps is gonna come back. You just wait and see."

"Fox News: Facebook's business model exploits YOU and Mark Zuckerberg could care lessMark Zuckerberg's staunch defense of Facebook’s business model and actions in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed revealed more than ever the negative impact the company continues to have on society and us as individuals.Unfortunately, the op-ed offers little reassurance to anyone uneasy about the company’s intrusion into their privacy. Zuckerberg touts the company’s “transparency tools” -- which purportedly show Facebook users why they're being targeted by certain ads -- but knowing that your social interactions are being monitored doesn’t make it less creepy. An entire system built on knowing what every single user does on its platform (and beyond) is invasive and not what most people signed up for or understand.I’m sure that mass surveillance was not the vision when Facebook was conceived in a Harvard dorm room 15 years ago, but it's certainly the reality now.No rhetorical sleight of hand, such as Zuckerberg’s disingenuous claim that “we don't sell your data,” can obfuscate that fact. His claim makes a technical distinction. Obviously, Facebook does not part ways with the data we give it in exchange for money from advertisers. They hold onto this precious commodity and sell insights into who we are and what we do to advertisers, treating it as a renewable and recyclable resource.Indeed, Facebook’s business model relies on amassing as much personal information as possible. Zuckerberg admits this in his piece, saying Facebook aims to collect “what pages people like, what they click on, and other signals.” The latest illustration of this intent appeared in a recent New York Times report that Facebook plans to integrate Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp into a unified platform, which will dramatically increase their holistic knowledge and insights of users and their behavior.Let’s not be fooled or distracted by semantic debate. We are being monetized and sold.There is a better way. Just like any service, and especially with social networks, there should be a clear business model where the user is the customer, not data buyers. Social networks should come with controls that protect and respect their users. Despite Zuckerberg’s protests to the contrary and straw man arguments, Facebook fails this simple test.We get on social networks to share things with our family, friends, and other people in our lives. We don’t get on them to become data points. As long as Facebook makes money by plundering our photos, our likes, our friends, our comments, our memories, our time - they will continue to be led by a financial incentive that will never be aligned with its users’ interests. They will continue to build a platform designed with the sole purpose of getting as much data as possible and selling it for as much profit as possible.Over the past 15 years since Facebook was created we have been conditioned to believe that sacrificing our privacy for the convenience of a free service is just how things work. People are now breaking out of this mindset, recognizing there is a heavy cost to “free” -- and that it doesn’t have to be this way.Social media platforms don’t need to collect our information to be sustainable. They can be built with users’ best interests in mind and respect their privacy. They should reward authentic and organic content instead of bots, fake accounts, and those who manipulate the algorithms.I truly believe that social networks can be an important force for good and a way to bring people closer together. So much so that I created Vero and am committing the next five years and millions of dollars of my own money to solving this problem because I just know we deserve better.Vero doesn’t mine our users’ data, relying instead on an affordable subscription model to sustain it. Our goal is to enable connections with each other and do so in a considered and transparent way.It’s a pity that Zuckerberg seems more focused on making excuses while refusing to change. Whether it’s giving third parties access to users’ private messages or duping teens into using spyware, this is business as usual at Facebook. No amount of profit or op-eds can paper over the fact that the company’s business practices are built to exploit you. It’s a good thing they’re no longer the only game in town."

"Facebook's renamed cryptocurrency Diem is still 'wolf in sheep's clothing': German Finance MinisterBERLIN (Reuters) - It will take more than renaming Facebook’s cryptocurrency to address the concerns regulators have about authorising its launch in Germany and Europe, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Monday.In a statement after a video conference of G7 finance ministers at which cryptocurrencies were discussed, Scholz said that relaunching Libra under its new name of Diem was only a cosmetic change.“A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf,” he said. “It is clear to me that Germany and Europe cannot and will not accept its entry into the market while the regulatory risks are not adequately addressed.”He added: “We must do everything possible to make sure the currency monopoly remains in the hands of states.”"

"Facebook and Google are profiting from scam ads, new research suggestsFacebook and Google are failing to crack down on paid fraudulent ads placed on their platforms, even after users have reported them, new research shows.Online fraud has skyrocketed over the past year, as scammers capitalized on the widespread lockdowns that have kept people indoors all over the world.Tech giants have come under pressure to take action against nefarious actors with past reports accusing Facebook of having a ""lax approach"" to the issue, while criminals continue to buy and set up fraud ads in a matter of hours.More than a third (34%) of people that reported a scam ad to Google said it was not taken down while just over a quarter (26%) said the same had happened with Facebook, according to a study published by British consumer group Which?.Which gave examples of scammers posting fake ads for discounts at established shoe retailers like Clarks or Russell and Bromley, using their logos and branding. These ads lead to look-a-like websites that steal consumers' financial details. One victim said she paid £85 for a pair of boots, but instead received a pair of cheap sunglasses.The study, of 2,000 adults in the UK, found that while Google was worse at reacting to reported scams, victims were more likely to encounter a fraudulent ad on Facebook in the first place.Around 27% said they had come up against a scam ad on Facebook compared to 19% on Google.Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said the findings showed both Facebook and Google had left their users ""worryingly exposed to scams,"" and suggested the UK government bring in legislation to root out the problem.""Online platforms must be given a legal responsibility to identify, remove and prevent fake and fraudulent content on their sites,"" he said. ""The case for including scams in the Online Safety Bill is overwhelming and the government needs to act now.""As part of the British government's proposed Online Safety Bill, tech companies that allow users to post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to £18 million (around $25 million) or 10% of their annual revenue, whichever is higher, for failing to remove ""harmful"" content.The Bill is expected to contain extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with ""high-risk features,"" expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter."

"Today was a great day for growth tech investors. $PINS, which has been a Top Pick of mine for a while, was no exception. With days like today, we have to keep a longer-term context in perspective. Understand the long-term narrative, and discount back to present value. So here goes...$PINS is the most unique ""social media platform"" available from both a user and advertiser perspective. So unique in fact, that I would only use the term social media platform as a loose descriptor. Pinterest is really an eCommerce search engine of sorts. Users use the Pinterest platform as a way of gaining inspiration. Whether it be fashion, home decor, or travel, Pinterest is an inspiration engine. Compared to $FB or $TWTR, where users are left in a generally negative headspace after using the app, $PINS users have a generally more positive experience. Why? Because they're being inspired. It's that simple.This positivity on the platform correlates to sticky engagement (emphasis on sticky). As you use Pinterest more and more, the platform collects more and more data on your interests, your taste, and other important insights into how you are inspired. Why is this important? It means Pinterest is able to understand a lot about their users, using merely first party/on-platform insights. They aren't really subject to third party targeting (think third party ad cookies) and they won't see much of a headwind from $AAPL's IDFA change (if/when it ever happens). Simply put, $PINS just works for advertisers. We see it in $PINS users' purchasing behavior. Out of all the social media platforms, $PINS has the highest percentage of users who purchase a product after using the platform. $PINS is monetizing its user base at ~$3/MAU annually (as of 2020). Keep in mind, peer $FB is monetizing at ~$30/MAU annually (again as of 2020). So, you could argue the attack opportunity from monetization alone is 10x. This neglects any further growth in the user base as Pinterest evolves and expands (especially internationally).Yes, on a short-term basis it's expensive. Yes, there is a lot of execution risk. But take a long-term view. We're at ~$45 billion in market cap, for a fundamental story that could be worth ~$100B+ one day (my view). Right now, 2021YE PT is ~$130/share based on 2030 valuation discounted back to year end value. Will update you all in the future. Long $PINS"

They were made by Zuckerberg, as trustee of the Mark Zuckerberg Trust, or in the name of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation or for CZI Holdings LLC.In Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zuckerberg disclosed that a total of 546,363 Class A shares FB, -0.99% were acquired through the conversion of derivative securities at a price of $0.He also disclosed that 725,204 Class A shares were sold, via roughly 350 recorded trades, at a weighted average price of about $270.11 to raise $195,887,332, according to a MarketWatch calculation of the data.The sales were made at prices as low as $254.08 on March 4 and as high as $292.61 on March 19. For reference, the stock traded in a range of $253.50 to $299.70 in March through Friday, with an average closing price for those 15 trading days of $269.02."
It's tired. I see 245 buying.
80 cents YOY quarterly earnings increase and at a PE lets just presume 30 (which is on the low end of its history) that equates to a 24$ increase assuming it wasn't already baked in and....growth remains (I guess the latter part could be argued slightly although not proven)
When FB and other large cap stocks get pummeled by the coming dollar bear market in a few months at least small cap stocks will soar.

"Supreme Court ruling could make robocalls ‘virtually unstoppable’Facebook (FB) is fighting a case in the Supreme Court. It’s not about fake news, foreign influence, censorship, or antitrust issues – it’s about robocalls.This is the second time in 2020 that the Supreme Court has heard a case involving robocalls.Efforts to fight robocalls through new legislation foundered this year as the divided Congress left out key provisions that defined exactly what a robocall really is.In 2014, Noah Duguid started receiving a ton of texts from Facebook regarding his ""account"" – even though he didn’t have a Facebook account. Irritated, he asked Facebook to stop sending him messages. The company did not stop and he sued. Now, it’s gone all the way to the Supreme Court.This type of automated phone activity can take the form of texts or calls and is a different kind of robocall than the obvious fraudsters who say that you’ve “won a free vacation” or want to sell you a new car warranty. But they do represent a significant problem that vexes anyone with a phone.In almost all circumstances, a business needs your permission to send you an automated call or text. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 applies this to companies that use “autodialers,” essentially technology that stores and dials numbers.But Facebook says that its technology doesn’t count as an autodialer because it doesn’t dial randomly. That’s the question in front of the court: What is an autodialer?An exception to smartphonesFacebook and other business-friendly interests say that you can’t define an autodialer as simply a device that stores and dials numbers because that would mean the law would apply to a modern smartphone, which can also store and dial numbers.But in a new letter to the court against Facebook this week, consumer groups including the National Consumer Law Center, the Consumer Federation of America, and Consumer Reports argue that this is disingenuous, and that no one really thinks smartphones are involved in the spam calling or texting.Furthermore, the letter argues, if the court ruled in favor of the tech behemoth, “users would be defenseless against the increasing barrage of robocalls.”“The consequence will be that autodialed calls and texts to all cellphones and the other protected lines will be virtually unstoppable,” the consumer groups wrote.Speaking to Yahoo Finance, the National Consumer Law Center’s Margot Saunders, one of the authors of the letter to the court, explained the difference between autodialers that companies use and smartphones.“That’s just speed dialing,” Saunders said of what smartphones do, adding that the consumer groups couldn’t find a single case of smartphone robocalling that ended in a lawsuit.As the letter argues, “Smartphones are simply small computers, which standing alone do not have the ability to robocall people en masse.” In other words, they should not be included in the robocall debate — something the FCC could clear up if it chose to, but has not.Politics is getting in the way?Saunders said companies like Facebook would rather simply make sure unwanted messages are legal than to deal with stopping the spam texts. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.Joining Facebook’s side, she added, are many companies and corporate interests, which were part of the reason why the robocall bill that passed Congress didn’t previously resolve the issue.In the divided Congress, protections that would have solved this problem were not included in the robocall bill that passed in 2019. And with conservative-leaning Amy Coney Barrett recently confirmed to the Supreme Court, consumer advocates are concerned a ruling in Facebook’s favor will remove people’s means to stop unwanted texts and calls.The Federal Communications Commission has put anti-robocalling efforts high on its list of priorities and the agency has been active, especially fighting fraudulent calls. But the FCC hasn’t used its authority to make a ruling that smartphones don’t count as robocalling machines, potentially clearing the Facebook matter up.Saunders said the industry-friendly agency’s stalling is because it’s facing a dilemma. If Pai and the FCC rule in favor of consumers who don’t like spam calls and texts, Pai may lose friends in the business community. And if it rules in a way advantageous to Facebook, the anti-robocall champion suddenly is on the side of the robocallers.“This has been pending the FCC for two years and [FCC Chair Ajit] Pai has not touched it,” Saunders said. “It’s the third rail.”The FCC declined to comment on the matter, or Saunders’ reasoning. The court will hear the case in December with a ruling expected in the spring."

"AWESOME. Looking to see it reach $260 or above on Friday. Remember, the recent $250.15 all-time high was in an environment of boycott, regulatory pressure, and earnings uncertainty. All three of those factors have just been alleviated to a very large degree. If the earnings call goes well, we should see FB soar tomorrow. Also, in the coming days, there are bound to be a flurry of positive news items and positive analyst recommendations that should take the share price even higher."
"Very possible this thing goes right back to $20 bucs. Remember, its not investing. Its pure gambling."
"MM and shorts will most likely keep the pps below $195 today. Going forward, also have to keep an eye on the Fed and interest rates, though with zero debt, an interest rate increase won't personally hurt FB. But if the overall market declines on worries about rates, kind of tough for any stock to buck that trend. Lastly, have no idea what kind of fine FB will ultimately have to pay, but if it's less than what is rumored, and it should be in MHO, the pps will get a boost. Also, I'm waiting to see what kind of fine Marriott will be assessed for their 500 million customer breach. The info they exposed is a lot more damaging to an individual's privacy than the fantasia posted by users on FB. Anyone wanna bet that the numbers don't play out proportionately and Marriott gets off far more cheaply than FB?"
"are we back to the number of employees again? Sigh. Ok - consider this (again) J&J started with a small handful of employees. As did MOST COMPANIES on the planet. Yeesh. $MSFT, $FB, $AMZN, and $DELL started with.. oh, how many? What's that? 1? really one?"
"The price is 296, which way it’s more likely to go, I am betting on dn"
Finish green
"Not even for $200, my ethics is worth more than money"
Mark Zuckerberg just came out and said that they were going to DOMINATE APPLE.Hmmm........
"As a shareholder, I am still livid that the management team and BoD approved a payment to the the SEC that was $4.9 billion higher than the maximum they should have paid. Shareholders got humbugged! We need a management group that won’t sell out shareholder interests."
So glad I loaded the boat a few weeks back during the sell off. There is so much short and long term potential with fb its ridiculous and is still undervalued even here. 300 here we come!
Apple is saving the day right now........this would be south of 165 today if not for Apple
Wall Street cowboys decided to take FB stock over $200 by month end.
"$WIMI $FB $AAPL Microsoft is experimenting with Mac OS support for its social service AltspaceVR.The test was ""designed to help us better understand the feasibility of extending Altspacevr to Mac OS,"" and you can try it now. In recent months, AltSpace avatars from cross-platform social services have been shown working with Microsoft's Mesh service for VR and AR collaboration."
my short time frame is not 1 day... so nothing to worry about. Sell off will come very soon...
Do not be surprised if it erases the majority of the loss by the end if the day.
FB got caught promoting fake products/reviews and was forced to remove them by the UK authority for the second time
beware of pastyface.
"FB,APPL,NFLX BEST SHORTS OF STOCKS, SHORT AS FB RISES!"
"Adspend for restaurants, hotels, flights, etc. will likely see a massive increase over the next 3 months. Could be very favorable for FB and I wouldn't be surprised to see this stock reach $350+ by August."
FB AAPL BA TWTR CPNG are standing out so well today guys!
52 week high is 208.66...thumbs up if we close this week out above it
"I can’t believe some of the headlines I’m reading today about FB changing its business model and regulation. From my perspective, nothing has changed as a result of the CH testimony and nothing will; it’s business as usual and FB will continue to drive forward with its growth model. To wit, I’ve been seeing ads on Messenger so they’re starting to monetize that platform now. If anyone thinks the dotards on CH are interested in regulating FB, you just weren’t listening. The testimony on CH was a just a show of bravado and nothing more. After all, Congress can’t even develop sensible legislation for gun control, an issue which has proven to be more deleterious to our society than social media."
We may see green before closing
"Zest won Arkansas largest Federal lawsuit in State history $155 Million judgment against Walmart. Walmart and IBM food trust need Zest Tech, buyout or royalty in the works! Add Zest to your watch list!"

Good upward movement finally by this stock.
"I like the May 21st Calls, because if we soar on earnings, they will be up big, and if we dip, I have time to add (average down) on these, then sell higher on the next move up. "

FB is an unshortable stock at .9% The long term trend and only way is up over the next few years.
still undervalued
new ATH today!
"THIS DIP IS WEAK, CONSIDERING HOW MUCH FB IS UP FROM EARNINGS."
Facebook will be going down. Its political overreach will be the downfall of this once popular site.
"FB is the premier value stock in Big-Tech, and remains in bargain territory as a cheap growth stock!"
Politics are driving the market right now be prepared for extreme volatility my advice just hold what you got this too shall pass.
"Newspaper publishers sue Google, FacebookPublishers of 125 newspapers in 11 states filed or announced lawsuits against Google and Facebook this week, claiming the tech giants have unlawfully monopolized the digital advertising market and engaged in an illegal secretive deal, nicknamed “Jedi Blue,” to thwart competition.Fourteen complaints were filed or announced by publishers from Indiana, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Mississippi, New Jersey, Missouri, Maryland and Delaware.The claims follow a January antitrust suit against Google and Facebook filed by HD Media, a West Virginia-based newspaper company that publishes the Charleston Gazette-Mail and (Huntington) Herald-Dispatch.“As found by recent investigations conducted by both federal and state agencies, Google and Facebook have monopolized the digital advertising market and restricted the monetization of local news by local news organizations,” Halbreich said. “This has had a dramatic impact on the revenues and resources available for local news organizations. These monopolistic practices must come to an end. It is no longer appropriate for these two platforms to profit directly from local news while publishers increasingly struggle.”In October 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law issued a 470-page report detailing Google and Facebook’s conduct in the digital advertising market and the profound effects it has had upon America’s free and diverse press, particularly the newspaper industry. The Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice and numerous state attorneys general also have filed antitrust claims against Google or Facebook or both. Newspapers have been acutely impacted: Advertising revenue plunged from $49 billion in 2006 to $16.5 billion in 2017, threatening the existence of local news, according to the complaints.“The freedom of the press is not at stake,” the complaints state. “The press itself is at stake.” Nearly 30,000 newspaper jobs disappeared — a 60% industrywide decline — from 1990 to 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Almost 20% of all newspapers have closed in the past 15 years, and “countless others have become shells — or ‘ghosts’ — of themselves,” according to a recent report by the University of North Carolina.“Newspapers are essential to the functioning of our democracy, and there is no replacement for a well-informed citizenry,” said Paul Farrell Jr., an attorney for the newspaper publishers. “This is a fight worth fighting.”"
"WOW! Considering AAPL just went red on those massive earnings, FB IS HOLDING UP VERY WELL, even with the dip."
FB is a censoring Marxist platform. You are being used. All these big tech companies work with Government to push propaganda. This is TYRANNY. COVID IS A FLU. DATA PROVES IT. WAKE UP!
FB is trading in “gift horse ” territory!- FB Mgmt has ingeniously managed the recent negative headlines — into a great advantage for its global business in Australia and now in the EU!*** FB’s proactive “win-win” negotiations have been nothing short of brilliant as should pay off in time!
"German regulator bans Facebook from processing WhatsApp user dataBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's lead data protection regulator for Facebook is banning the social network from processing personal data from WhatsApp users because it views the messaging app's new terms of use as illegal, it said on Tuesday.The decision follows emergency proceedings opened by the regulator in the city-state of Hamburg last month after WhatsApp required users to consent to new terms or stop using the service.""This order seeks to secure the rights and freedoms of the many millions of users who give their consent to the terms of use throughout Germany,"" Hamburg's data protection officer Johannes Caspar said.""My objective is to prevent disadvantages and damages associated with such a black-box procedure.""Caspar, who leads domestic oversight of Facebook under Germany's federal system as its country office is in Hamburg, announced his decision before a May 15 deadline for consenting to WhatsApp's new terms.Caspar said he was using his power to impose a three-month freeze on Facebook's collection of WhatsApp user data under extraordinary powers foreseen in the GDPR.He said he would also seek an EU-wide ruling at the European Data Protection Board, a forum that groups regulators from the bloc's 27 member states."

another company that alienated half of its subscribers in the interest of censorship and communism is going to lose over half its market cap before the end of this year is my prediction!
Unfortunately Some people think FANG is related. Netflix has nothing to do with Social. Netflix was up over 100% this year. FB is undervalued and up only 10% or so. It’s all about numbers not News! Buy the dip tomorrow!
I guess I’ll have to pick up a few shares here. Who woulda thought

"U.S. House antitrust chairman plans multiple bills to go after Big TechWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Representative David Cicilline, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, is preparing to come out with 10 or more pieces of legislation targeting Big Tech companies, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.The strategy to produce a series of smaller bills is aimed at lowering opposition from tech companies and their lobbyists towards a single piece of legislation, the source said.Cicilline is also working on a separate bill targeting a key law called Section 230, which offers protection to tech platforms from liability over content users post, the source said.His 230 legislation is likely to go after platforms such as Facebook and Google the way they amplify user content.Cicilline’s comments were first reported in an interview by Axios on Sunday."

Jeez when you mute the 10 shortes suddenly the board is so calm.

FB makes a lot of money scamming people. You should all be proud of that.
"As I stated two days ago:""Three years ago I used to use Facebook multiple times daily, now I just check in once or twice a month.

"If some of the folks that buy into the big lie all leave, nobody cares. I'll take the discount. Most, however, are all talk. They are addicted to FB and will keep using as they need a platform to yell and scream...just like they keep drinking coke, going to baseball games, etc."

"Let the birdbrained, basement dwelling, Deplorables flee FB. Makes it that much more pleasant for the rest of us. They can enjoy the new BLOG created by Team Dotard. Something my 7th grade nephew could do in his free time."
FB are not being impartial with postings..they are monitoring with a political bent. For example they assume they can make medical decisions without proper due diligence. Anecdotal evidence works both ways for correlatable conclusions. FB is not the FDA or the WHO etc. They will lose many many FB accounts with this ongoing polarizing of the site; a lot of my friends are totally #$%$ of with their attitude; just remember eyeballs is advertising and this is FB bread and butter. I am thinking to take them to task with a civil suit for restricting freedom of speech. Their platform is supposedly is for the public according to their terms of use?
Why is Facebook against free speech? One should be able to express their views without being turned off by any social media platform. FB is starting to sound like our so-called elitist universities that are anything but bastions of free speech.
At 77 I see more rules and far less freedom.

"Does anybody remember the Ad Boycott?Time flies, and in the current era in which attention is the new currency, people forget easily. So I ask, does anybody remember the Ad Boycott? It was a little over half a year ago, yet it feels like ages ago. Too many events and ""breaking news"" have occurred since, and everyone has forgotten about it. Yet, it serves as a great reminder of why Facebook is an unstoppable train that you should not bet against.In June, investors feared that thousands of Facebook's biggest advertisers leaving the platform would hurt its top and bottom line. In the three months following June, i.e., Q3, Facebook went on to deliver a spectacular quarter, posting all-time high revenues and net income of $21.4B and $7.8B, respectively. Facebook doesn't need the big advertisers. The company had more than 1.8 billion people (and growing) scrolling through its apps on a daily basis at the end of Q3. It has all the attention in the world. The truth is that big advertisers need Facebook. Especially when there are thousands of smaller brands spending massively on social media platforms, threatening to capture market share from the bigger players."

In this day and age social media sites are popping up everywhere on the internet. Facebook is not the only game in town now. Thanks to Twitters and Facebooks new cancel culture and communist ways they really wont be a thing for much longer.
"I'm guessing we'll see some off and on profit taking in the short term. Lots of the smart money pounced when the pps was in the low $150s, so they have a handsome, albeit short term, gain.FB seems to be coming out with a new addition to its basic platform every other day. Okay, some won't be money makers on their own, but the more reasons you give people to log onto FB, there's bound to be a trickle down effect leading to increased profits.$180 or better by this Friday? It's a very real possibility but I'm not gonna be crushed if it doesn't happen. Long term, we're looking good and will pass $180 and beyond as the summer progresses."
"Drug Cartels Are All Over Instagram and FacebookInstagram is currently the leading platform for selling drugs directly to consumers, while Facebook comes a close second.Latin American criminal gangs are leveraging social media and messaging platforms to spread narco culture and sell drugs.Late last year, Colombia’s federal police arrested Diego Optra, a crime boss who heads a ruthless gang called La Local in the port city of Buenaventura. In addition to overseeing drug trafficking and extortion rings, La Local was reportedly behind over 90 percent of the city’s homicides. Optra had successfully evaded the police for months, but he left digital breadcrumbs in the form of his meticulously curated Instagram profile. There, his many fans were regaled regularly with photos of Optra donning diamond-encrusted bracelets, designer clothes, and an arsenal of firearms. According to police officials, his lively social media profile was key to his arrest and conviction.Optra is not the first crime boss to display his gangster lifestyle on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram. Nor is he the first to get caught after doing so. Drug traffickers and gangs are lively social media users across the Americas. Cartel bosses and their underlings use mainstream social media and popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp to shore up power and influence, threaten the competition, recruit new members, conduct sex trafficking, sell drugs and contraband. Mexico used to be ground zero for this kind of activity, where researchers created a new discipline out of studying these narco posts. Now, gangs in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and the United States are also involved.Law enforcement agencies have been warning for years that the so-called darknet—the unmonitored reaches of the internet—is one of the largest sources of direct sales of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services. Transnational law enforcement operations involving simultaneous takedowns of darknet vendors are routine. Yet hiding in plain sight is the sale of illicit goods on public social media. Instagram is currently the leading platform for selling drugs directly to consumers, while Facebook comes a close second. These platforms serve as a kind of halfway point between the street market and the darknet."
Fakebook and communism go hand in hand. Fakebook wants control over the American citizen. Pulled my stocks this morning.

Will be glad when FB crumbles
"As seems to be the case with FB, the pps recovered slightly (About $1.00) at the close. CNBC pundits shredded Sanberg's year-end closing remarks. Said her statement sounded more like an excuse and/or an everything- is -alright speech. Not the first time one of FB's leaders opened his/her mouth and the pps went down.Can only hope that we've seen the last of the bad news regarding user privacy etc. FB does allow users to right to limit how their data is used. It's there in black and white for all to read and act upon if they choose. JMHO, but I don't think the average FB user is overly concerned about this issue for one simple reason. Most people don't post truly sensitive info on FB, or any other social media site for that matter. I think we've all come to realize anything we do on line is being monitored for the purpose of sending us ads that may interest us. To wit, I recently booked a hotel room in South Carolina. For the past week or ten days I've been getting all types of ads for hotels, tourist attractions, golf meccas and the like in South Carolina. I know why I'm receiving them, and unless I'm a cult of one, I'm totally not phased by any of that. Finally, I'll be interested to see how sales of FB's Portal and Oculus VR products fared over Christmas. FB's pps will really get a boost if they can show other revenue streams over and above ads. That's why I'm excited about blockchain/crypto project."

"I talked with several young people over the holidays and asked what their thoughts are regarding the future of Facebook.While none of them post on FB, they all use what can be called the ecosystem, FB logins for gaming, Messenger, Instagram, etc. One recent graduate is looking to work at Oculas and uses what's app to connect to family. They all suggested on holding FB stock based on the fact that there is nothing to replace that ecosystem, and that there is not anything close to replacing it. Like it or not, FB is the 600 pound gorilla."

"kudos to FB and the legitimate media for speaking out against racists, authoritarian tendencies, and conspiracy theories. Buying more FB today."
I knew this was going to happen
"fb has been bouncing at the range of 263-265 for a month, it looks like a strong resistance there we have to break that point to get even further"
"facebook was $195 a week ago, now its $174.39 its safe to buy now"
This stock is a tank. Amazing report
People hate the company but you got to love where the stock is at
I just modeled it out and it looks like FB will drop to the $183.17-184.12 range by the end of the week. Longs you are forgetting that a PE changes when the E changes( earnings) my model shows that FB earnings will actually decline due to higher expenses).
"I was saying a few weeks ago when there was a lot of negativity in the news about how FB might have improperly shared users' data, some people were skeptical to buy and they should have while the stock price was in the $180s (it had even gotten as low as $176 in pre-market on one of the days). That was a great time to buy but its still early to get it on the rally. Stock price is going to be hitting $250 soon and in the next 2-3 years you may be holding a stock worth more than double of today's price. They released news that I was reading about how FB will generate an additional $6-8 billion in revenue just from targeted ads that are placed inside Facebook messenger. BUY BUY BUY and HOLD"
Let's go FB 203$
May be 195 today
"The people/companies that are using Facebook for advertisement, selling stuff or for entertainment don't care about privacy issues. It's the media and politicians making an issue about privacy."
"$WIMI $FB During Facebook's recent Q1 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked a lot about AR/VR, saying, among other things, that developing mainstream AR glasses could be one of the biggest technology challenges of this decade."
"Companies like Facebook aren’t making it any easier—in fact, says a complaint filed with the federal government Tuesday, the social media giant and 10 other companies are actually going out of their way to make it tougher. The complaint—filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by the American Civil Liberties Union, the law firm Outten & Golden and the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a labor union, —says Facebook practices sex discrimination against women and older workers, by allowing advertisers to target job openings only to men. The complaint was filed on behalf of three individuals, part of a proposed class of millions of Facebook’s female users, as well as on behalf of CWA and its workers."

Enjoy the L shorts & CFD/put buyers.... YOU GUYS GOT SMOKED
I can’t see a smart person not buying FB. Definitely low on the IQ scale types would short it these levels.￼

"FB's cryto currency is legit and will be the most successful of crypto initiatives as its not nearly as volitile as bitcoin so ecommerce/online vendors are likely to accept FB's Libra. FB having over 2 Billion subscribers and their WhatsApp over 1.5 Billion users FB has the audience and community to drive their crypto initiative worldwide success. The likes of VISA, Mastercard, PayPal are amongst the top payment services believing in its success as they invested in it along with DOZENS of firms that are now being released. More monetization, new revenue generation. More growth, FB stock needs to be repriced higher."
Please short this stock so it could go up more lol
we need class Acton for the losses that FB caused us . by making half the population mad

A $300 stock for under $250. Count me in. I know most people prefer a $25 stock trading at $150 though.
"@ cy, don't be so nervous, relax!FB is way too cheap, for a growth stock, a P/E=27 is way too low. FB next big moves: (1) Blockchian and cryptocurrency(2) FB shops like Amazon.If the above is going to materialize, people will buy using TSLA's P/E=1000, FB can be priced at $10,000/share.Unfortunately you shorted way too low, you may face INFINITY loss if FB explodes."
Facebook is undervalued asf. It should already be USD 450 at least.
Anyone want to talk about WhatsApp Brazil peer to Peer payments. This is a huge game changer for Facebook.THe Financial Times said Facebook wants to move into Mexico and Indonesia next.

"The social dialogue on ""Climate Change"" was proven to be totally fake. For the past year, the entire globe was shut down. No one mentioned how much improvement we seen. Millennials, politicians and media are lying about climate change until the address how much improvement we seen and what it took to get there. Climate change experts are a total scam and joke until they present their evidence. FB staff and especially their CEO are complete failures for not recognizing this obvious and intentional oversight. FB is worthless to the planet."
Where O Where is CY tonight. Is he still short his 2000 shares at $308.00 ? He will probably tell us he covered at $305 and than re-shorted again today at $316
this should cross the $300but has a strong sell at that pricestill this is a very left back stock!!!
"Where is the outrage for the networks, cable news etc. FAKE NEWS"
Facebook’s malware business model is fundamentally flawed. The CEO keeps selling shares and smart money is moving elsewhere.
Bitcoin has no cash or gold backing so it is a joke.

"Betting against FB is like betting gasoline will put out a fire. FB shorts’ finances will end up as dumpster fires. The shorts who thumbs down my posts don’t hurt my feelings...they merely reaffirm their stupidity. There is no bear case on FB. None. Washington 99.99 percent likely won’t make FB give up Instagram and What’s App, the latest data breach is a paper Tiger, etc. Shorts are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. I’ve asked them repeatedly to stop handing longs like me their money but they just seem to want to do it even more. Your ethical and moral objections to this company will keep you poor. This company is sitting on a powder keg that over time will propel it into the stratosphere. You can either get rich or complain. Anyone with a brain would do the former."
"FB moving up nicely. Should cross $190 even before earnings are announced. Even the naysayers, shorties and talking heads with their own agendas are having a hard time trying to rain on this parade.

"Facebook Ads Documented by FTC as Promoting ScamsThe United States Federal Trade Commission documented millions of dollars of Facebook Ads scams.The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that their documented consumer scam complaints related to social media are rising at unprecedented levels. Consumers have lost $117 million dollars in the first six months of 2020 compared to $134 million dollars for 2019.The FTC describes the Facebook ad scam trend as skyrocketing.Facebook and Instagram Ads Used by ScammersFacebook and Instagram advertising is being abused by criminals to swindle users out of millions of dollars in 2020. Online shopping related to Facebook advertising is cited by nearly 100% of consumers who report having placed an order and never received their items.What’s happening is that swindlers are placing ads on Facebook with no intention of delivering products.The FTC highlighted the danger of online shopping via Facebook ads by stating that the top consumer complaints about being scammed was through online shopping via Facebook and Instagram advertising.According to the FTC“Online shopping topped the list of complaints from consumers who reported a scam to the FTC that originated on social media.Of these consumers, many were responding to an ad they saw on social media and reported that the item they ordered never arrived.Most of those consumers (94 percent) who identified the social media service in their complaint cited Facebook or Instagram as the platform they used.”The FTC specifically named Facebook and Instagram advertising as usually being the source of advertising related scams.The government watchdog said that criminals are abusing advertising features to make their ads look more trustworthy.“These scam ads look real and can be carefully targeted to reach a particular audience. The scammers can delete comments on their ads or posts, so that negative responses don’t show up and alert people to the con.”Romance ScamsBut it’s not just shopping ads that criminals are using. Romance related rip offs are also reported, accounting for millions of lost dollars.The FTC warns:“About half of all romance scam reports to the FTC since 2019 involve social media, usually on Facebook or Instagram.”Romance related scams, according to the FTC, begin with a message or a friend request. The FTC encourages the public to not send money to a love interest that they have not met.Types of Scams Found on Facebook Ads • Online Shopping • Romance scams • Economic relief scams • Income opportunity scams • Grant money • Giveaways • Multi-level marketing MLM • Pyramid schemes • Blessing circles/gifting schemesFacebook Scammers Using Identity Theft SchemesAnother way scammers are taking advantage of users is by impersonating a Facebook member or by outright taking over an account. Scammers are taking advantage of the fact that Facebook users will trust messages from someone they know and trust.Finance Related ScamsThe FTC said that the pandemic has created an opportunity for scammers to use Facebook advertising to reach economically distressed consumers to scam millions of dollars.Many people are looking for ways to earn more money. Scammers are taking advantage of them with pyramid and MLM schemes.Facebook Ad Scams Create a Bad ImpressionScammers leveraging Facebook ads is bad for consumers and for legitimate advertisers. Millions of dollars have been lost and the victims will tell a friend about their experience.The success of advertising depends on trust. Anything that erodes trust in Facebook advertising can’t be good for the advertising ecosystem."

"Let's see, news about breaking up FB sent the pps spiraling downwards by 14 points in one day. The so called experts come out the following day and yesterday saying to the effect, that's a lot harder to do than a simple edict, and a few even placed the odds of a mandated breakup in the same range as the Orioles winning this year's WS. Yet, the recovery off the low is barely half of what was initially lost? Is it any wonder that FB longs might have less hair today after all the head scratching we've had to do over the past 18 months. Finally, I'm very excited to learn the details of FB's cryptocurrency model (Libra). And specifically how much cheese it has the potential to earn. Another solid revenue source added to FB's already impressive stable of platforms has to be met with enthusiasm on Wall Street, right? At least one would think so."
FB is one of the cheapest companies in internet sector. Do your due diligence. It’s making close $12 per shares and a current PE of 21? Investors have been selling it as growth but it’s actually a value stock growing at 30% YOY...12B income from 28B revenue speaks for itself

Tendie making during EOD but tomorrow we are going over 300
There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to the violent swings in price currently. We are in a gun slinging environment where option players that play both sides of the fence simultaneously make money. I'm in that group. Owning the stock is not productive.
I see 205 after earnings. That's my guess.

"I’ve held FB since 2012 and it’s been very good to me financially speaking. However, it now appears to be the perfect time to find a better investment without controversy. The coordination between FB, Apple and AWS is a direct attack on free speech. The constitution was constructed to protect us from the government violating the rights written into the document. They had no idea private businesses would one day become larger and more powerful than the government. This is exactly what has happened with big tech companies. One of these companies touch all of us. I’ve never had a FB account. I deleted Twitter last year due to the nastiness. We undoubtedly use services that use AWS and finally, I’m writing this on my Apple phone."

FB won't be around forever that is a fact.
"Facebook may lose some tracking information, but I bet their AI already has a ton of information on us and FB has a lot of users so it's unlikely that Ad dollars will free any time soon. Regardless, it's going to be rather interesting to see how things play out as Apple makes it harder to track customers."
I said on the twit board and I'll say it here. It's a fact over half of America hate these companies and want nothing to do with them. Yes... Me included.
Problem with FB earnings either good or bad always pull back after ! I noticed Most of the time the gain always comes the week before earnings.
FB is the top value business in Big-tech at these levels!
They can’t prop this all day
When is FB going to hold the 180's?
Just started a position yesterday. Hadn’t been purchasing any tech companies due to their ballooned valuation. Little did i know Facebook hadnt been following. Crazy growth and a less than 20 forward pe. Awesome business model with a ton of active users. Really looking forward to adding to my position because this could easily double in 5-10 years. Easily
Very deserved run still undervalued here now ;)

"Advocacy group urges Zuckerberg to cancel plans to launch Instagram for kids(Reuters) - An advocacy group on Thursday called on Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to not create a version of photo-sharing app Instagram for children who are under 13, as it would put them at ""great risk"".The letter to Zuckerberg from the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) comes at a time the world's largest social network has been criticized for amplifying misinformation globally across its platforms, while also exposing children to inappropriate material. Instagram exploits youngsters' fear of missing out as they constantly check their devices seeking approval and uploading pictures, CCFC said, adding that the platform's continuous focus on appearance and self presentation would be a challenge to adolescents' privacy and wellbeing.""While collecting valuable family data and cultivating a new generation of Instagram users may be good for Facebook's bottom line, it will likely increase the use of Instagram by young children who are particularly vulnerable to the platform's manipulative and exploitative features,"" the letter said.CCFC is a nonprofit organization that believes that child-targeted marketing, along with the excessive screen time it encourages, will damage kids' healthy development, and is dedicated to ending marketing to children."

This means the highest multiple stocks start coming back to reality. I've been rolling back into my highest conviction names. As fundamentals show their strength, the market will likely get over the temporary valuation correction and re-rate growth names higher. I'm not going long value tech ($INTC or $FB or $AAPL), I'm going to stick to what works. Long $PINS and $SNAP more specifically."

"Facebook probe in final stages as FTC, U.S. states prepare lawsuitsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan group of dozens of state attorneys general are in the final stages of filing one or more major antitrust complaints against Facebook Inc in early December, according to four sources familiar with the situation.FTC staff undertaking a probe of the company has recommended to commissioners that they sue the social media company in federal court, which would allow the group of states, led by New York, to join the lawsuit, according to one source.As many as 41 states may sign on to the lawsuit, three sources said. The filing of the lawsuit or lawsuits could slip into next year, the sources said.Following news reports on the Facebook investigation, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement: ""We don't comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, but as we have said before, we will continue to use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions stifled competition, reduced choices, or put user data at risk.""The FTC and states have yet to finalize how they might file any lawsuits. The FTC may file alone to a district court while the states file their complaint separately; the FTC can file to an administrative law judge and states can file in district court, or they can join forces and sue together in district court, two sources said.States discussed the matter during a call on Wednesday, two sources said.FTC commissioners could make a decision as early as Friday, when a meeting is scheduled. Unlike the Justice Department, which typically gets new leaders with a new U.S. president, the FTC commissioners' terms are unaffected by Inauguration Day in January.The FTC declined comment while Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.In addition to New York, other lead states on the investigation include Colorado, Nebraska, Tennessee and Utah, one of the sources said.The legal action is expected to focus on Facebook's alleged violations of antitrust law to protect its gigantic market share in social media.The FTC and states have converged on similar accusations, though what they will allege in court has not been finalized, one of the sources briefed on the discussions said. They contend Facebook stifled competition with its $1 billion acquisition of the image-sharing app Instagram in 2012, weakened privacy protections in the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp after acquiring it for $22 billion in 2014 and selectively squashed rivals by refusing to share user data, the source said.States are not expected to list specific remedies in their lawsuit, the source added.Startup investors, antitrust experts and privacy activists have criticized the FTC for its approvals of the Instagram and WhatsApp purchases.A comprehensive report by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee of the four Big Tech companies this year found that Facebook used its access to superior market data to identify coming competitive threats so those companies could be copied, purchased or choked off by restricting access to Facebook data."
"Facebook’s surveillance based targeting tool promotes gender bias (Reuters) - Facebook users may not be learning about jobs for which they are qualified because the company's tools can disproportionately direct ads to a particular gender ""beyond what can be legally justified,"" university researchers said in a study published on Friday.According to the study, in one of three examples that generated similar results, Facebook targeted an Instacart delivery job ad to a female-heavy audience and a Domino's Pizza delivery job ad to a male-heavy viewership.Instacart has mostly female drivers, and Domino's mostly men, the study by University of Southern California researchers said.In contrast, Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn showed the ads for delivery jobs at Domino's to about the same porportion of women as it did the Instacart ad.""Facebook's ad delivery can result in skew of job ad delivery by gender beyond what can be legally justified by possible differences in qualifications,"" the study said. The finding strengthens the argument that Facebook's algorithms may be in violation of U.S. anti-discrimination laws, it added.Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said the company accounts for ""many signals to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in, but we understand the concerns raised in the report.""Amid lawsuits and regulatory probes on discrimination through ad targeting, Facebook has tightened controls to prevent clients from excluding some groups from seeing job, housing and other ads.But researchers remain concerned about bias in artificial intelligence (AI) software choosing which users see an ad. Facebook and LinkedIn both said they study their AI for what the tech industry calls ""fairness.""LinkedIn engineering vice president Ashvin Kannan said the study's results ""align with our own internal review of our job ads ecosystem."""

"Long term horizon 5-10 years is my bet, not months or even a year or two. Patience wins the race. Never been Aquino trader in for days or weeks. Very happy with my long term gains. Short term gains are just too tax prohibitive. This will be like GOOG in another 5-10 years. Guaranteed"
"While Twitter, Amazon, Yahoo, Google, and Fakebook are busy censoring Americans that don't agree with their way of life, there are newer and better social media platforms springing up every year that don't accept the fake censor police. These older platforms that were once on top in the world will soon be just another face in the crowd."

"Inside the Google-Facebook Ad Deal at the Heart of a Price-Fixing LawsuitLawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction riggingGoogle allegedly gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a lawsuit brought by 10 Republican state attorneys general saysState attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants, Facebook Inc. FB -0.08% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG -0.98% Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”Crucial to the backdrop of the Google-Facebook deal was the advertising industry’s movement toward an ad-sales method called header bidding.Header bidding helped website publishers circumvent Google’s exchanges for buying and selling ads across the web. The exchange auctions ad space to the highest bidder during the split second it takes a webpage to load.Header bidding allowed the publishers to directly solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges at once, leading to more favorable prices for publishers. Google worried a big rival might embrace header bidding, such as the Facebook Audience Network ad service, or FAN, cracking Google’s profitable monopoly over ad tools, the states allege. “Need to fight off the existential threat posed by header bidding and FAN,” Google advertising executive Chris LaSala wrote in an internal document outlining 2017 priorities, according to the draft complaint.In March 2017, Facebook publicly endorsed header bidding. Google approached Facebook and in September 2018 reached the digital advertising agreement, the states allege. The draft lawsuit says Google code-named it “Jedi Blue.” In December 2018, Facebook announced it was joining an advertising program, “Open Bidding,” that Google offers as an alternative to header bidding.TERMS OF THE ‘JEDI BLUE’ CONTRACTThese are some of the alleged stipulations in the Google-Facebook contract, according to a recent, unredacted draft of the states’ lawsuit viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Google says it is common to match users through trackers known as cookies, and it publicly offers that service to other buyers. • Facebook pays Google a 5% to 10% transaction fee. (Google says this fee is standard.) • Google helps Facebook recognize mobile and web users. • Facebook bids to show ads to 90% of users it recognizes. • Facebook has 300 millisecond “timeout” to recognize user and bid. Some other participants have shorter, 160 millisecond timeout. • Facebook is locked into spending $500 million annually starting in the fourth year.In return, the states allege in the final suit, Google gave Facebook special treatment. Among other things, it allowed Facebook to send bids directly into Google’s widely used software, known as an ad server, the draft lawsuit says.Typically, bidders go through an exchange, which sends the winner on to Google’s server. By circumventing the middleman, Facebook could face less competition and save money. Google barred Facebook from discussing pricing terms publicly, the draft says.Google also told Facebook which ad opportunities were likely produced by bots rather than by consumers, and it didn’t charge Facebook for those impressions, according to the draft suit. Other auction participants asked Google for the same information but were denied it, the final lawsuit says, redacting the information in question.Any bidder without that information would be at a disadvantage, said Adam Heimlich, CEO of ad technology company Chalice Custom Algorithms LLC. “It’s like saying CarMax has the ability to tell when they have a junky used car, and they don’t tell you,” he said. Mr. Heimlich accused Google of harming competition at a Senate hearing this year.Unlike other types of antitrust cases, which can require complex market analysis and the sussing out of business motivations, agreements to fix prices or rig auctions are inherently illegal, said Harry First, a New York University antitrust law professor who was once the head of New York state’s antitrust enforcement bureau.“The only defense that a court will hear is, ‘We didn’t do it,’ ” he said."

The stock could be trading at the double its current valuation, and it would arguably not be overvalued, based on comparative valuations. The outcome could even be more optimistic in the scenario that FB uses its huge cash pile to buy back more stock.While a $400/share is indeed quite high, I would not be surprised if Facebook goes under am Apple-like multiple expansion, which could lead to a share price north of $350 by the end of 2020."

"Cybercriminals Bought Facebook Ads for a Fake Clubhouse App to Scam Facebook UsersCybercriminals have been pushing Facebook users to download a Clubhouse app “for PC,” something that doesn’t exist. The app is actually a trojan designed to inject malware into your computer. The popular new invite-only chat app is only available on iPhone but worldwide interest in the platform has risen and users are clamoring for Android and, presumably, “PC” versions.Per TechCrunch, the malicious campaign used Facebook ads and pages to direct platform users to a series of fake Clubhouse websites. Those sites, hosted in Russia, asked visitors to download the app, which they promised was just the most recent version of the product: “We tried to make the experience as smooth as possible. You can check it out right now!” one proclaims.However, once downloaded, the app would begin signaling to a command and control (C&C) server. In cyberattacks, the C&C is typically the server that informs malware what to do once it has infected a system. Testing of the app through malware analysis sandbox VMRay apparently showed that, in one instance, it tried to infect a computer with ransomware."

"Honestly, if there's a company that I trust nearly 100% to make the right decision for the long-term, it's Facebook. For all of you who are in panic mode, let me ask you one question: Have you taken a look at Facebook's chart? Clearly, this is a company that consistently makes the right moves. Sure, the stock may face a few bumps in the road, but this company has proven over and over that every move they make is for the long-term growth and well-being of the company. So stop worrying and watch FB stock end up in the $240 range by year end."

"EU investigates Instagram over handling of children's dataInstagram is being investigated by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) over its handling of children's personal data on the platform.The social media app's owner Facebook could face a large fine if Instagram is found to have broken privacy laws.The investigations stem from complaints that Instagram made contact information on business accounts publicly visible to anyone accessing the app.The BBC has approached Facebook for comment.A number of US tech giants have their European headquarters in Ireland, and the DPC is the lead European Union regulator under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018.The DPC is responsible for protecting individuals' right to online privacy, and has the power to issue large fines.The Irish regulator is investigating whether Facebook has a legal basis for processing children's personal data and if it employs adequate protections and restrictions on Instagram for children.Separately, it is also looking at whether Facebook has adhered with GDPR requirements in relation to Instagram's profile and account settings. It is inquiring into whether Facebook is adequately protecting the data protection rights of children as vulnerable persons.The minimum age for having an Instagram account is 13.""Instagram is a social media platform which is used widely by children in Ireland and across Europe,"" said Graham Doyle, a deputy commissioner with DPC.""The DPC has been actively monitoring complaints received from individuals in this area and has identified potential concerns in relation to the processing of children's personal data on Instagram which require further examination.""A parent's worriesIn February 2019, data scientist David Stier analysed profiles of almost 200,000 Instagram users across the world. He estimated that for over a year, at least 60 million users under the age of 18 were given the option to easily change their profiles into business accounts.Instagram business accounts require users to display their phone numbers and email addresses publicly, meaning that personal data belonging to many users is visible to other Instagram users.The same personal information was also contained in the HTML source code of web pages accessed when using Instagram on a computer, meaning that it could be ""scraped"" by hackers.Mr Stier reported his findings to Facebook, but he wrote in a Medium blog that Instagram had refused to mask the email addresses and phone numbers for business accounts.However, Facebook did decide to remove the contact information from the source code of Instagram pages.Despite this, Mr Stier believes that hackers might have succeeded in stealing the personal information from Instagram's website, after it was revealed in May 2019 that contact details relating to 49 million users were stored online in an unguarded database owned by a firm in India.""Do we have a responsibility to keep kids' phone numbers and emails hidden so that strangers can't find them just by clicking a button?"" wrote Mr Stier.""Speaking as a parent, I want to be assured that the experience Instagram offers to teens is as 'adult-overseen' as possible."""

"Facebook’s acquisition of GIF platform Giphy to face in-depth antitrust probeFacebook’s acquisition of GIF site Giphy will face an in-depth investigation from antitrust regulators, after the social-media giant refused to make concessions to address competition concerns.Social-media giant Facebook FB, 1.45% acquired Giphy in May 2020 in a deal worth $400 million, with the initial intention of integrating the site into Instagram, according to a report from Axios. Giphy allows users to search, create and share GIFs.The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, said on Thursday that it had referred the merger for an in-depth, “second-phase” investigation with a deadline of September 15.The CMA began probing the deal in June 2020 and launched an initial investigation in January this year. On March 25, the regulator said it was possible that Facebook’s takeover of Giphy “has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition” in U.K. markets. Facebook had five days to offer concessions to address the competition concerns, but chose not to do so.The regulator’s concerns center on how Giphy would have less of an incentive to expand its digital advertising, which would lead to a loss of potential competition. In July 2020, the CMA found that Facebook controlled more than 50% of the £5.5 billion ($7.6 billion) display advertising market.The CMA also said that the deal could harm other social-media platforms, like Twitter TWTR, 0.77% and Tik Tok, if Giphy stopped supplying GIFs to these Facebook rivals or offered them worse terms.An in-depth investigation by the CMA comes as Facebook and other technology giants face intense regulatory scrutiny around the world.In addition to the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Facebook for illegal monopolization, Big Tech is set to square off against new regulation in the European Union that includes the possibility of multibillion-dollar fines and the breaking up of companies if they don’t comply with new rules."
Why is the stock going down even though there is exciting and good news about Facebook?
When this hits 294 I’ll buy more
"Any hint, even the smallest, that ad revenues will not grow as they have, will spell disaster for FB. Not the type of disaster we often see with companies that are hyped and disappoint, but perhaps a 25% reduction in the pps. Remember what happened a few years ago when the CFO said FB wasn't attracting young users? The stock caved. Couple that with, IMHO, a big drop in The Dow and NADAQ (You know it's coming. Just a matter of when.) and all stocks, even the good ones, do not escape unscathed.True, based on fundamentals, FB's pps ought to be at least 10% higher than it is. But all the bad opinions about FB have created a sky with way too many black clouds. The pols may not ever do anything to actually hurt FB's biz, but their rhetoric about what they may do or want to do will hurt the pps by making investors nervous. And, nervous investors gravitate in swarms towards that Sell button."
What happened to all the Naysayers?
It’s clear FB is coming in with hardware. I bought the oculus 2. Awesome experience! Stakes are high!

"You have to ask yourself has anything about FB as a company fundamentally changed. Has growth slowed? Have the financials weakened? The answer is No. Its struggle are merely due to a large amount of bad press and media. It's what the big institutions want, to hammer the stock until sentiment reverses and it takes off to new highs. Add periodically if you can because you can't keep a top notch stock like FB down forever it's been six months already. Eventually FB will come roaring back with vengeance like a bat out of hell. All us fellow longs who have been in for years know this. It's simply a matter of time. FB is by far the most undervalued big tech and FANG stock. Good luck to all the longs and anyone with the patience,fortitude,and foresight to stay the course. Have a great weekend everyone.

"I have compared FB and MSFT and GOOGL and AMZN and AAPL extensively. In a nutshell, considering past and future growth, FB is by far the cheapest. Amazon and FB's growth stand out. Should have a higher PE ratio than all but AMZN. When taking cash and debt into account, Google and FB stand out for having extremely low debt and lots of cash. This means they can borrow billions if they want to, at very low interest rates. Right now FB should be trading in the $340-$370 range all things considered. I believe FB should announce a huge buyback and this would propel the stock to the $400 ballpark. Would a $100B loan only cost them ~$1B/year in interest. I think this confidence would create far more than $100B in shareholder value. It seemed to work for Advance Auto. Or perhaps they could take a page out of Buffets book and say they will buyback shares under a PE of 35. I already own shares but I am now planning to buy a bunch more and hold until at least $340. I'll probably be using 4 month options."

FB is printing $ and you have to own shares until it is eventually broken up and regulated as a utility. Who knows when that day will come so enjoy the ride. I will say that FB is a huge part of the growing division in America and a gateway for foreign governments to manipulate the the US population with massive PR campaigns on both sides of the political spectrum. FB has made physical spies obsolete as you can get far more data on US users through them than ever possible with an actual spy.

"Those who think FB will go to 0 when it has no direct competition, trades on fundamentals, has $62 billion in cash, and $23-$24 billion free cash flow, are delusional. If FB were just a fad, explain how it’s been around since 2005 and continues to grow in popularity? Fads don’t last 16 years. And those who leave FB go to Instagram, which conveniently is owned by FB. And many often keep messenger. Bottom line, FB owning Instagram and What’s App makes switching costs extremely high. Some people are ok with quitting social media altogether but the average person can’t do without it. If the opposite were true explain how FB continues to grow year over year. You can paint social media as evil all you want to...the benefits outweigh the cons for the vast majority of the world."

"Facebook shuts popular stock trading group amid GameStop frenzy(Reuters) - Facebook Inc took down a popular Wall Street discussion group, Robinhood Stock Traders, in a move that its founder on Thursday described as backlash for conversations buoying shares of GameStop Corp and other companies this week.GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and BlackBerry have been at the center of a market battle as individual investors coordinating on social media including Reddit, and using trading apps such as Robinhood, bought shares and squeezed hedge funds that had bet big on those struggling companies to tank.Allen Tran, a 23-year-old from Chicago who created Robinhood Stock Traders, said he woke up on Wednesday to a notification that Facebook had disabled the 157,000-member group. The notification, seen by Reuters, said without detail that the group violated policies on ""adult sexual exploitation.""""We were first on the picking tree to be cut off because we are on Facebook, not a free platform like Reddit,"" said Tran, referring to the typically lighter moderation on the discussion website.Some of his group's members made tens of thousands of dollars in recent trades first popularized on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, he said.Tran, who also runs the 20,000-member HaiKhuu Trading group on chat app Discord, said he has never seen adult content on the Facebook group.Facebook spokeswoman Kristen Morea said, ""This group was removed for violating our Community Standards, unrelated to the ongoing stock frenzy."" She did not respond to requests to elaborate.Tran said institutional investors are trying to separate retail traders.Facebook suspended his group on Jan. 7 after labeling it a ""dangerous organization,"" according to correspondence seen by Reuters, though the company reinstated its privileges after he appealed to contacts there.""With all these major institutions being frustrated with the success of retail, they are trying to target any groups they can,"" said Tran, who was featured in a Wall Street Journal article in November and described his Facebook group as the largest of its kind.Tran expressed concern that a replacement group he formed to carry on discussions also will be taken down."

"""Tech Stocks to Buy with Little Exposure to US-China Trade War""[Zacks] Benjamin Rains""Facebook has essentially no presence in China due to government censorship laws. It also makes nearly 99% of its money from digital advertising and will hardly be impacted by the continuation of the trade war. Plus, the social media powerhouse was still able to grow both its daily and monthly active user bases by 8% last quarter despite not operating in the world’s most populated country. Facebook executives now estimate that over 2.7 monthly billion people use at least one of its “family” of services—which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger—every month on average, or roughly 35% of the global population."""

"One thing that did disappoint me with FB is the fact that they did not seem to fight very hard to lower that $5 Billion fine. When you look at previous fines levied over the years, to say FB's fine was way over the top is an understatement. Okay, FB had the cookies in their cookie jar to easily pay the fine, but if I was Zuck (Actually, his lawyers.) I think I could have made a pretty good case that the CA situation wasn't anywhere near as large and/or detrimental to users as some others: Equifax, Marriott, Yahoo, the I.R.S, Target etc. All of these examples had sensitive personal data exposed. Still contend, the infraction is the infraction. To wit, if a parking ticket is $25, it's $25 for everyone. Period! You don't pay more because you illegally parked a Rolls Royce and you don't pay less because you illegally parked a 20-year-old Yugo. FB should fight back once in a while. They take way too many shots without so much as a whimper."

"It happened 5 times in last five years and didnt cause crash. It might dip a little bit, do not expect big drop.March 2019 – At least 600 million usersFacebook’s first data breach of 2019 was a big one. In March, cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs reported that Facebook was storing hundred of millions of user passwords in plaintext files. Only employees could access these files, but that still means that account passwords were accessible to over 2,000 Facebook employees. In some cases, the records went all the way back until 2012. Facebook didn’t divulge why or how user passwords had been stored in such a way. A month later, it was revealed that millions of Instagram users had been affected as well; their passwords had also been stored in plaintext. Facebook reiterated that the passwords had not been compromised or improperly used in any way. The total number of Facebook and Instagram users affected is still unknown (as Facebook has refused to comment), but it is estimated to be at least 600 million, though the actual number is probably a lot higher.April 2019 – 540 million usersThe spring of 2019 was not a good time for Facebook. In April, it was discovered that hundreds of millions of Facebook user records were sitting on a public server. Oops. Researchers at the security firm UpGuard discovered the breach, and reached out to the Mexican company hosting the server, Cultura Colectiva, multiple times before the server was finally secured months later.It’s unknown exactly how long user records were exposed for, or if anyone managed to take advantage of the situation. The data was only made private after Facebook became aware of the situation. Although Facebook isn’t directly responsible for this breach, it certainly added fuel to the growing fire. April 2019 – 1.5 million usersGoing back to May 2016, Facebook had been harvesting the email contacts of 1.5 million new users when they opened their accounts. It will come as no surprise that the company was doing this without the consent or knowledge of its users. So how did it happen?During the registration process, Facebook was asking new users to verify their email address by entering in their email password, a move that is widely condemned by security experts. Once the password for the email address was entered, their email contacts would automatically be imported. Facebook did not ask for permission to do this, and there was no way to stop or cancel the process as it was happening.Facebook would then use the collected data to improve the performance of ads, make friend recommendations, and help build up the Facebook web of connections. Facebook said it wasn’t able to see the contents of emails, but being able to see who you are communicating with is still a pretty big privacy breach. With 1.5 million email address books connected, Facebook now had the details of millions of other people.The company said it would delete the email contact lists, and that no one outside of Facebook had access to the data.September 2019 – 419 million usersIn a breach that feels a bit like Groundhog Day, the data of 419 million Facebook users was discovered sitting on an exposed server. If it sounds familiar, it’s because it also happened in April 2019. Each record contained a user’s unique Facebook ID and the phone number listed on the account. In some cases, the full names, gender and location of users were also listed.Facebook did not own the server, and it’s unclear who it belonged to. We don’t know who scraped the information from Facebook’s systems or why, but only an employee (or a motivated hacker) would have that level of access. The server was taken down, and it remains to be seen if anyone has been affected by this breach. December 2019 – 309 million usersFacebook finished off 2019 with a bang when yet another database was left exposed. More than 300 million Facebook user phone numbers, names and user IDs were left unprotected on the dark web for nearly two weeks. Security expert Bob Diachenko, who discovered the breach, reported that it was the result of an illegal scraping operation or Facebook API abuse by hackers in Vietnam.The estimate of those affected was originally 267 million. However in March 2020, it was discovered that a second server containing an additional 42 million records was exposed by the same criminal group, which brought the total up to 309 million. Once again, it is unknown if anyone was affected by the breach, but it definitely put users at risk to spam and phishing attacks. Conclusion – Protect your personal dataWhat’s clear from this list is that your data is not safe on Facebook. In 2019 alone over 1 billion user records were leaked, which equals half of all of Facebook users. So what can you do to protect your data?The first thing to realize is that any online account can be breached. As a result, you should either delete your Facebook account or at least delete any information that could potentially harm you."

Ok now let's move onto growth rates...32.6 percent revenue growth rate for the current quarter, above 40 percent next quarter, 19 percent for 2022. Earnings growth rate over the next 5 years 21.5 percent, large free cash growth over every year for the last decade except for 2018. Cheap from a valuation standpoint (PE very reasonable for a growth stock). Immune to rising rates. Earnings solid. What's not to like? I know I'm going to get thumbs downed for this but the simple fact is there is no way you can hate the stock after everything I just laid out."

"The EU looks set to follow Australia's lead by demanding Google and Facebook pay for news articles • The EU looks set to follow Australia's lead and demand tech platforms pay to display news. • Australia's threat resulted in Google threatening to pull search from the country. • MEP Alex Saliba said the Australian approach addressed the ""acute bargaining power imbalances.""European legislators may follow Australia's lead in calling on major tech platforms like Facebook and Google to pay to display news articles.The Australian government has been locked in a war of words with Google over proposed new regulations in recent weeks, culminating in the tech giant threatening to shut down its search engine locally.Meanwhile, Facebook has also warned it could stop Australian users from sharing news articles if the legislation goes through in its current form, with local MD Will Easton saying there were ""no clear limits"" on the amount publishers could charge.But the EU looks set to make similar demands of the tech giants, according to the Financial Times, as legislators seek to build on the framework outlined in the recently proposed EU Digital Services and Digital Markets acts.Speaking to the paper, Maltese MEP Alex Saliba said the Australian government's approach had addressed the ""acute bargaining power imbalances"" between tech platforms and news publishers.""With their dominant market position in search, social media and advertising, large digital platforms create power imbalances and benefit significantly from news content,"" he said. ""I think it is only fair that they pay back a fair amount.""The EU has been at the forefront of tough new data and tech regulation in recent years, bringing in the wide-ranging GDPR data protection legislation - which has resulted in massive fines for the likes of British Airways and Marriott Hotels - and proposals to clamp down on digital giants."
"Apple CEO Tim Cook rails against 'purveyors of fake news' as Facebook feud rages onApple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook took to the virtual stage of the Computers, Privacy, and Data Protection (CPDP) conference on Thursday, attacking social media sites for allowing the spread of misinformation — an apparent barb aimed at Facebook (FB), though he didn’t mention its name.In his speech, Cook laid into algorithm-driven social media platforms, painting them as, “An interconnected ecosystem of companies and data brokers, of purveyors of fake news and peddlers of division, of trackers and hucksters just looking to make a quick buck.”Cook’s appearance followed Apple’s announcement that it will soon launch a controversial privacy feature that gives users the ability to stop apps from tracking their activity to collect information for advertisers. The feature could hurt Facebook and other apps that benefit from targeted advertising dollars.The feature, called App Tracking Transparency and coming to Apple devices in the next update for iOS 14, has faced heavy criticism from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who claims Apple is only making the privacy change to benefit its own bottom line.Apple and Facebook’s relationship has never been worse. They have sparred over privacy and data security for years, but iApple’s announcement at its WWDC 2020 conference that it was going to introduce App Tracking Transparency set the two tech titans on a collision course.App Tracking Transparency is a new pop-up that users will see when they download apps from the App Store that track their online activities to provide information to advertisers to better target their campaigns.Facebook, however, claims the feature will decimate small businesses that rely on its ability to effectively target ads. According to the social media company, those businesses could see a 50% reduction in revenue as a result of Apple’s changes.Facebook even went as far as to take out full-page ads in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal saying that it was fighting to save small businesses from Apple. The irony in Facebook using media outlets, which have been crushed by it and Google’s dominance of the online advertising industry, was particularly rich.During his speech Cook lambasted social platforms that operate using algorithms, which include Facebook and Twitter, for allowing everything from conspiracy theories to violent militias to propagate across their services.“What are the consequences of prioritizing conspiracy theories and violent incitement, simply because of the high rates of engagement?” Cook said.“What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in life-saving vaccinations? What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users joining extremist groups, and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more?”Prior to his speech, Cook tweeted that the industry needs transparency and reform.Facebook isn’t taking Apple’s moves lying down, though. During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg called out Apple as one of its biggest competitors. He added, “Apple has every incentive to use its dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps work to favor their own, which they regularly do.”Facebook is now, according to a report by The Information, considering filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in an effort to push back against App Tracking Transparency. That’s in addition to Facebook’s announcement in December that it was assisting Epic Games in its antitrust suit against Apple."

"New Zealand looks to bring in Australian-style media deals with Google and Facebook that would force the social media giants pay for news contentNew Zealand has called on Google and Facebook to pay its media companies for news as it considers bringing in Australia-style content laws. Kris Faafoi, New Zealand's broadcasting and media minister, called on the tech giants to begin negotiations with broadcasters to pay for hosting their stories.Faafoi said he met both companies last week to 'encourage' them to enter talks with media companies - or else face harsher regulation. ‘I'm confident that commercial discussions taking place between traditional media and digital platforms will also begin here in New Zealand and I encourage that,' he told a parliamentary meeting on Friday. “They will be heavily influenced by the nature of the actions and discussions between the platforms and media companies,' he said.He said New Zealand media companies were facing a financial crisis at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic meant their work was increasingly important.'The media's role through the pandemic was key to New Zealand's successful response,' he said.'As minister, I'm committed to supporting the sector... and to deliver the change required to make it stronger and sustainable in the future.'New Zealand is not the only country looking at ways to make tech companies which dominate their markets and soak up the lion's share of advertising revenue share their wealth with media firms which have seen profits dwindle in recent years.The UK is thought to be looking at similar legislation with proposals due before parliament next year, while the EU is being encouraged to include similar laws in its Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, which are currently being drafted.Lobbyists in the US are also thought to be considering similar proposals."

"Surveillance Giant Facebook Faces German Bid to Halt Collection of WhatsApp Data(Bloomberg) -- One of Germany’s toughest data regulators is seeking an administrative order that would stop Facebook Inc. from collecting user data from its WhatsApp unit.The regulator in the city of Hamburg is seeking an “immediately enforceable order” before May 15 over concerns that policy changes could lead to the use of such data for wider marketing and advertising purposes.“WhatsApp is now used by almost 60 million people in Germany and is by far the most widely used social media application, even ahead of Facebook,” Johannes Caspar, the data commissioner, said in a statement Tuesday. “It is therefore all the more important to ensure that the high number of users, which makes the service attractive to many people, does not lead to an abusive exploitation of data power.”WhatsApp delayed the introduction of a new privacy policy earlier this year after confusion and user backlash forced the messaging service to better explain what data it collects and how it shares that information with its parent company. The U.K.’s top data-protection regulator told lawmakers in January that millions of people have stopped using WhatsApp in favor of alternative messaging services such as Telegram and Signal.Facebook officials declined to immediately comment. The company will have a chance to respond to the allegations at a hearing, the regulator said.“Up to now there has been no supervisory review of the actual processing operations between WhatsApp and Facebook that we are aware of,” Caspar said. “There is reason to believe that the provisions that will enable and expand the sharing of data between WhatsApp and Facebook will be unlawfully enforced due to the lack of voluntary and informed consent.”He said the formal case was opened “to prevent unlawful mass data sharing, if necessary, and to put an end to unlawful consent pressure on millions of people.”"

"Facebook doesn't seem to mind that facial recognition glasses would endanger womenPicture this: you’re sitting in a bar and a creepy stranger keeps trying to talk to you. You ignore them. The next day you get a text from that stranger. Not only do they know your phone number, they know where you live; in fact, they know everything about you. They were wearing Facebook smart glasses, you see. The moment they looked in your direction the glasses identified you via facial recognition technology.This, it seems, is precisely the sort of Black Mirror-esque future Facebook wants. The tech company (and serial privacy invader) has teamed up with Ray-Ban to develop a range of smart glasses. While it’s not clear exactly what these devices will do yet, Buzzfeed has reported that Facebook is considering building facial recognition capabilities into them. During an internal meeting on Thursday, Andrew Bosworth, Facebook’s vice-president of augmented and virtual reality, told employees that Facebook was currently assessing the legal issues surrounding this.Legal issues are one thing, but what about the very obvious ethical and privacy issues? Would you be able to mark your face as “unsearchable?”, one employee asked. And what about the potential for “real-world harm” and “stalkers”?Bosworth replied: “Face recognition … might be the thorniest issue, where the benefits are so clear, and the risks are so clear, and we don’t know where to balance those things.”Excuse me? What kind of benefits could possibly balance the risk of making life extremely easy for stalkers and creeps? Well, Bosworth later said on Twitter, it could help people with prosopagnosia, a neurological condition where you can’t recognize people’s faces. More generally, Bosworth said, it would be super handy when you run into someone at a party and can’t remember their name. Ah yes, I can totally see how avoiding a little social awkwardness balances out the whole stalker thing!No need to worry too much about privacy, though. We all know you can trust Facebook to do the right thing and keep your data nice and safe. When a (female) Wired editor raised the concern that you could no longer pacify creeps at parties by giving them a fake name and number, for example, Bosworth breezily replied that there’d be a technological fix for that. The exchange makes it almost hilariously clear that Bosworth had given very little thought to the implications of this kind of tech on women’s everyday lives. Which is to be expected, considering Facebook started life as a website that let people rank hot girls via photos obtained without their consent.Facebook, of course, may not end up building facial recognition into its glasses. However, the fact it is even considering doing so is a disturbing reminder of how little ownership we currently have over our own faces. Several photos of your face, for example, are probably in Clearview AI’s database. The company, which counts the Facebook board member Peter Thiel as an investor, built a secretive facial recognition tool which it trained, in part, on pictures it scraped from social media. It sells its services to law enforcement agencies but also gives access to its app – which lets you hold your phone up to someone’s face and pull up their personal information – to select people. John Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of Gristedes grocery, boasted about using the Clearview App to identify a man he saw on a date with his daughter, for example.As well as being intrusive, facial recognition technology is plagued with problems. It doesn’t work as well on people with darker skin, for one thing. At least three black men have been falsely arrested based on a bad facial recognition match. But as long as the collateral damage involved with this tech is just black people and women, who cares, eh? None of the big technology companies seem to. Timnit Gebru is one of the leading voices in AI ethics and has done groundbreaking work around bias in facial recognition technology. Gebru was fired from her role as technical co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team in December; she alleges they were trying to suppress her research on bias. Last week Google also fired Margaret Mitchell, another top AI ethics researcher. Big tech loves to wax lyrical about their commitment to privacy and ethics but their actions tell a very different story."

"While I'm new to this board, I figured I would share my thoughts on $SNAP at ~$57/share and why I see a tear to $100. Used to be a bear, even held a short, but am now heavily exposed on the long side for a few reason. Firstly, $SNAP has great demographic exposure: the young audience. A case can be made (Big E) that TikTok is stealing users away from $SNAP. But it's just not true. In 4Q, $SNAP added a record number of sequential DAUs, and was able to monetize them at scale. In addition, we saw ~58% gross margins in 4Q (and that factors in an acceptable 500bps headwind from Spotlight) as $SNAP builds out their TikTok competitor in Spotlight. At this point, $SNAP has raw ARPU inertia going for it. In 2020, $FB monetized their global user base at ~$45/DAU. SNAP is at ~$10. So, you've got a 4.5x revenue growth opportunity from improved monetization alone, not even factoring in user growth, which has been accelerating (in terms of sequential adds). Now, the company is guiding for multiple years of ~50%+ rev. growth based solely on monetization expansion, implying that the 50% number could be conservative. This puts it among the top tier growth companies in tech, meaning a premium valuation is warranted."

"It's time to cancel the cancel culture. This is what happens when whiny children are coddled by their lazy parents and never disciplined for acting like brats.

FB, TWTR any dating sites, etc. If they refuse they are told we'll get back to you and they never get a call. If they comply then their backgrounds are vetted better than those of most of the incompetent rubes in DC. The process works pretty good and thank God it's in place because there have been some train wrecks and potential problems who never got calls to come back for a second interview."

"$WIMI As a pioneer in driving the contemporary AR/VR industry, Facebook's AR/VR business and layout have always attracted much attention. At the same time, Zuckerberg also said that the most anticipated business in 2021 is VR, and it is expected that Quest 2 will be the first VR headset to open to the mainstream market. Facebook is a social platform that aims to provide users with a variety of ways to interact, such as private messaging, video and photo sharing, etc.Currently, Facebook apps are built on other companies' platforms (Windows, iOS, Android, MacOS, etc.), so they want to invest deeply in AR/VR to build the next generation of computing platforms with telepresence and immersion. Facebook's related teams include the VR product team, the AR team, and the interaction team. The VR team is working on Quest 3, 4 and related technologies, which will optimize optics, performance, shape, etc. In addition, the next generation of products will most likely have eye-tracking and face-tracking capabilities.

"Facebook price target raised to $385 from $355 at Deutsche BankDeutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley raised the firm's price target on Facebook to $385 from $355 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst increased Q1 and 2021 estimates for Facebook reflecting more confidence on the back of positive feedback from the advertising community, ""multiple encouraging data sets"" on ad prices and spending trends, delays to Apple iOS privacy changes and positive recent commentary from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Investor focus is starting to shift away from fears around iOS changes towards a continued ad recovery and benefits from more e-commerce activity shifting into Facebook's platform, Walmsley tells investors in a research note. The analyst would add to stock positions as he sees a ""catalyst path"" that also includes benefits from the largest round of stimulus checks to date, more tests of non-skippable Stories ads, and the potential for Facebook to start monetizing Reels."
"In order to understand why $SNAP is trading where it's trading (valuation wise), we have to understand the story and the long-term picture. Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share."

"Apple Privacy Change May Cost Facebook, Google $25 Billion Over Next 12 MonthsGoogle could lose $17 billion in revenue over the next 12 months. Facebook has perhaps $8 billion at risk. The cause, according to mobile marketing professionals? Apple’s new privacy changes. Last year Apple announced that the Identifier For Advertisers (IDFA) would become explicitly opt-in in its next mobile operating system update, iOS 14. The IDFA helps advertisers measure ad effectiveness as well as track devices and people. In September, Apple delayed execution of that change until early 2021. But the change is coming, and most in the industry think it’s coming soon.What that means is greater user privacy.And what that means for Facebook and Google is impaired advertising efficiency. Unless huge numbers of consumers opt in to tracking, ads will no longer be as personalizable to our unique history, interests, and activity as they could in the past.In fact, Facebook itself estimated personalization accounts for 50% of the value of its advertising.Now mobile advertising expert Eric Seufert, who formerly led user acquisition for Angry Birds and other apps, has estimated the privacy cost of Apple’s change. He estimates some people will opt in to tracking: likely around 20%. (Facebook has stated it will ask for permission to track; Google has not yet revealed how it will proceed.) For the other 80% of people, however, advertising will lose some of the efficiency that personalization has delivered. Facebook and Google can recover some efficiency by better contextual targeting, he says, but not all of it.(Personalized targeting picks ads to show you based on your history and activity; contextual targeting selects ads based on on the content and focus of the app or website which you are using.)“I believe that Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes will significantly harm Facebook’s revenue, causing a roughly 7% revenue impairment in Q2 2021 in the base case scenario,” Seufert writes. “Subsequent quarters will also face revenue losses.”"
"well, when you ignore 50% of the population and censor them, probably not a good idea for long term success."

The central banks have also given investors the illusion that recessions are a thing of the past... and they've created massive stock market and real estate bubbles that are going to collapse. Most all investors and companies won't be prepared. Massive losses and bankruptcies are coming. Facebook could go bankrupt due to the loss of 80% of advertising revenue in the coming deep global recession."

"Facebook Faces Year of Reckoning After Showdown in Australia(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s brief but tempestuous standoff with the Australian government over a world-first pay-for-news law is only the start of a string of regulatory battles that the world’s biggest social network faces in 2021.Mark Zuckerberg started the year on the offensive, blocking news across Rupert Murdoch’s home turf of Australia to fend off demands that Facebook pay media companies for content shared on its platform.On Tuesday, Zuckerberg struck a compromise after 11th-hour talks with the government on the legislation that’s also aimed at Google and is expected to pass Australia’s parliament this week. But a regulatory domino effect is already underway, with publishers pressuring the European Union to emulate Australia’s approach.With the prospect of more assertive regulation and even Apple Inc. questioning Facebook’s longstanding model of using data to better target advertising, the social media platform’s way of doing business faces being upended.U.S. legislators are voicing the loudest concerns about Facebook, with Rhode Island Congressman and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline tweeting that the company “is not compatible with democracy.” Congress is holding hearings this week to consider tougher antitrust measures to rein in the powers of the company and other tech giants.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, meanwhile, said he’s discussed Facebook with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and the U.K.’s Boris Johnson, whose government plans to conduct antitrust probes into its operations.Facebook’s Australia Face-Off Could Backfire Across the GlobeFacebook has struggled to shake off deep-seated distrust since the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed failings in safeguarding personal data. It courted fresh controversy this January when WhatsApp’s privacy policy was updated to help it share more information with its parent, leading to several lawsuits and a flood of users joining rival messaging services Telegram and Signal.Facebook’s abrupt move to cut off news sharing in Australia -- jeopardizing credible sources of information about the coronavirus during a crucial time in vaccine rollout -- was widely criticized. But the high stakes gambit did help it wring some concessions from the government, which announced key amendments to the planned law on Tuesday. Crucially, Facebook and Google can decide what commercial deals to cut with news publishers, and will only face forced arbitration as a last resort.The “lesson for regulators and governments around the world is, Facebook is a formidable foe that’s willing to pull out the big guns to get what it wants,” former Facebook Australia and New Zealand Chief Executive Officer Stephen Scheeler said in a phone interview Wednesday. The Silicon Valley firm has the power “to essentially undermine a government position on a topic.”Among its other battles, the company has been hit with a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleging a “multi-year course of illegal conduct” and anticompetitive behavior. An unfavorable ruling in that case could ultimately force Facebook to sell off Instagram.And Zuckerberg, along with the leaders of Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc., will be answering U.S. legislators’ questions in March about the spread of misinformation online and the responsibility of platforms to curtail it."

As said in an earlier post, no one wants to be left standing alone on Non-PC Island.No matter how many algorithms FB employs to combat hateful speech or political bias, given the hugeness of its platform, thousands will undoubtedly slip through. So I'm not sure exactly what FB can do beyond the proverbial ""BesT Efforts"".A bigger problem for FB beyond losing its prime source of revenue (i.e. advertisers) is users, primarily here in the USA where FB generates more than 50% of its ad revenues, possibly taking up the mantra of the departing advertisers and leaving the site.Frustrating (Maddening?) for FB investors is history repeating itself. Seems like every time FB makes a new high and looks certain to hit that often mentioned $250 benchmark, something comes along to not only deny $250, but also drop its pps steeply.Finally, the pols never pass up an opportunity to grab TV face time by jumping on the hot topic of the day. Look for them to strut out their best damning comments about FB during the coming week. This ad boycott situation is a shame. I really thought FB could remain under the pols' radar this year while the Dems concentrated on trying to defeat Donald Trump. Alas, it was not to be."

"Apple to start enforcing new app privacy notifications in coming weeks(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday that in the coming weeks it will start enforcing a new privacy notification rule that digital advertising firms such as Facebook Inc have warned will hurt their business. Apple said the notices will become mandatory when its iOS 14.5 operating system becomes available in the coming weeks, though it did not give a precise date.The notices will require an app developer to ask a user’s permission before the app tracks activities “across other companies’ apps and websites.” Digital advertising industry experts have said the warning could cause many users to decline permission.Apple announced the move last June, but said in September that it would delay the change to give digital advertisers time to adjust. Some developers are already displaying the notice on a voluntary basis.Apple has said that it is providing developers with alternative advertising tools ahead of the change. One tool provides a way for advertisers running app installation ads to see how many people installed an app after the ad campaign without divulging information on individual users. Another tool called private-click management gives advertisers a way to measure when a user clicks an ad inside an app and is taken to a web page, but without revealing data about the individual user.Although the tools are intended to be used by software developers, Apple added information about them to one of its privacy guides for consumers on Wednesday."

"Microsoft wades into Facebook news fight by siding with European publishersLondon (CNN Business)Microsoft is joining forces with publishers in Europe to call for an Australia-style system that would force tech platforms such as Google and Facebook to pay news organizations for content.The company said Monday that it would team up with media industry groups like the European Publishers Council to lobby for such a policy, which lawmakers around the world are now considering.The move comes after Facebook (FB) stopped people from finding news on its platform in Australia last week rather than pay publishers for their content, a decision that produced a global backlash and generated negative headlines for the social media company.""We welcome Microsoft's recognition of the value that our content brings to the core businesses of search engines and social networks,"" Christian Van Thillo, the European Publishers Council's chairman, said in a statement.Australia's government is pushing legislation that would allow certain media outlets to bargain with tech companies so they could be paid for distribution of the news they produce. Both parties would enter arbitration if they can't reach an agreement.The European Union and the United States face growing pressure to adopt similar measures. Canada's government has said it plans to introduce legislation in the coming months.Facebook has forcefully opposed the Australian legislation. Last week, it took the extraordinary step of banning users in the country from finding or sharing news on its service in protest of the policy. Google, meanwhile, went from threatening to pull its search engine to cutting deals with some of the country's largest media organizations, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.Microsoft (MSFT), which owns the search engine Bing, is taking a different approach. It voiced its support for the legislation and has committed to keeping its services in Australia if it takes effect, seeing a chance to steal market share from rival Google (GOOGL).""It was an opportunity to combine good business with a good cause,"" President Brad Smith said in a blog post earlier this month.The company has said it would back similar measures in other countries, including in the European Union, where policymakers are debating new laws that would rein in the power of Big Tech companies.Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner leading the charge on tech regulation, is holding a consultation on the legislation with members of European Parliament this week.New copyright laws in Europe require search engines and social media platforms to share revenue with publishers if their content is displayed. But European publishers and Microsoft want leaders to enact ""additional regulatory measures"" to ensure publishers have clout in negotiations.Some French publishers have signed up with Google, but without an arbitration mechanism, they fear the press ""might not have the economic strength to negotiate fair and balanced agreements with these gatekeeper tech companies, who might otherwise threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,"" according to Monday's press release.""Access to fresh, broad and deep press coverage is critical to the success of our democracies,"" Microsoft vice president Casper Klynge said in a statement."

"South Africa's information regulator says WhatsApp cannot share users' contact informationJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Facebook Inc cannot share any contact information it collects from WhatsApp users with its other properties without first obtaining authorisation from South Africa's Information Regulator (IR), the agency said on Wednesday.In January, the Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp informed users it was preparing a new privacy policy, under which it could share some data, including location and phone numbers, with Facebook and its other units such as Instagram and Messenger.The move has sparked backlash among users in South Africa and elsewhere, and prompted many to opt for rival services such as Signal or Telegram.""WhatsApp cannot without obtaining prior authorisation from the IR process any contact information of its users for a purpose other than the one for which the number was specifically intended at collection, with the aim of linking that information jointly with information processed by other Facebook companies,"" the regulator said.The regulator said its decision was in accordance with section 57 of the Protection of Personal Information Act, South Africa's data protection law.The regulator said that it has written to Facebook South Africa and outlined its concerns about the company's privacy policy.The regulator is also ""very concerned"" that citizens of the European Union will receive significantly higher privacy protection than people in South Africa and Africa generally.""Our legislation is very similar to that of the EU. It was based on that model deliberately, as it provides a significantly better model for the protection of personal information than that in other jurisdictions,"" Chairperson of the IR Pansy Tlakula said.""We do not understand why Facebook has adopted this differentiation between Europe and Africa.""Facebook South Africa was not immediately available for comment, while questions sent to Facebook were not immediately answered.The changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy have come under scrutiny globally, with Turkey's competition board launching an investigation and a legal challenge filed in India."

"US privacy, consumer, competition and civil rights groups urge ban on ‘surveillance advertising’A coalition of organizations across the privacy, antitrust, consumer protection and civil rights spaces has called for a ban on “surveillance advertising”, further amplifying the argument that “big tech’s toxic business model is undermining democracy”.The close to 40-strong coalition behind this latest call to ban “creepy ads” which rely on the mass tracking and profiling of web users in order to target them with behavioral ads. “As leaders across a broad range of issues and industries, we are united in our concern for the safety of our communities and the health of democracy,” they write in the open letter. “Social media giants are eroding our consensus reality and threatening public safety in service of a toxic, extractive business model. That’s why we’re joining forces in an effort to ban surveillance advertising.”The coalition is keen to point out that less toxic non-tracking alternatives (like contextual ads) exist, while arguing that greater transparency and oversight of adtech infrastructure could help clean up a range of linked problems, from junk content and rising conspiracism to ad fraud and denuded digital innovation.“There is no silver bullet to remedy this crisis — and the members of this coalition will continue to pursue a range of different policy approaches, from comprehensive privacy legislation to reforming our antitrust laws and liability standards,” they write. “But here’s one thing we all agree on: It’s time to ban surveillance advertising.”“Big Tech platforms amplify hate, illegal activities, and conspiracism — and feed users increasingly extreme content — because that’s what generates the most engagement and profit,” they warn.“Their own algorithmic tools have boosted everything from white supremacist groups and Holocaust denialism to COVID-19 hoaxes, counterfeit opioids and fake cancer cures. Echo chambers, radicalization, and viral lies are features of these platforms, not bugs — central to the business model.”The coalition also warns over surveillance advertising’s impact on the traditional news business, noting that shrinking revenues for professional journalism is raining more harm down upon the (genuine) information ecosystem democracies need to thrive.“Facebook and Google’s monopoly power and data harvesting practices have given them an unfair advantage, allowing them to dominate the digital advertising market, siphoning up revenue that once kept local newspapers afloat. So while Big Tech CEOs get richer, journalists get laid off,” the coalition warns, adding: “Big Tech will continue to stoke discrimination, division, and delusion — even if it fuels targeted violence or lays the groundwork for an insurrection — so long as it’s in their financial interest.”Among a laundry list of harms the coalition is linking to the dominant ad-based online business models of tech giants Facebook and Google is the funding of what they describe as “insidious misinformation sites that promote medical hoaxes, conspiracy theories, extremist content, and foreign propaganda”.“Banning surveillance advertising would restore transparency and accountability to digital ad placements, and substantially defund junk sites that serve as critical infrastructure in the disinformation pipeline,” they argue, adding: “These sites produce an endless drumbeat of made-to-go-viral conspiracy theories that are then boosted by bad-faith social media influencers and the platforms’ engagement-hungry algorithms — a toxic feedback loop fueled and financed by surveillance advertising.”Other harms they point to are the risks posed to public health by platforms’ amplification of junk/bogus content such as COVID-19 conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation; the risk of discrimination through unfairly selective and/or biased ad targeting, such as job ads that illegally exclude women or ethnic minorities; and the perverse economic incentives for ad platforms to amplify extremist/outrageous content in order to boost user engagement with content and ads, thereby fuelling societal division and driving partisanship as a byproduct of the fact platforms benefit financially from more content being spread.The coalition also argues that the surveillance advertising system is “rigging the game against small businesses” because it embeds platform monopolies — which is a neat counterpoint to tech giants’ defensive claim that creepy ads somehow level the playing field for SMEs versus larger brands.“While Facebook and Google portray themselves as lifelines for small businesses, the truth is they’re simply charging monopoly rents for access to the digital economy,” they write, arguing that the duopoly’s “surveillance-driven stranglehold over the ad market leaves the little guys with no leverage or choice” — opening them up to exploitation by big tech."
"Posted on Friday that the news conference that spirited a 900 rise in the Dow during the final hour of trading should not be viewed as the elixir that cures all that's daunting to the market. Said we haven't seen the last of those ""Dow Down 1,000"" headlines. But I didn't think Friday's jubilation would be so short lived. Here we are about 45 minutes away from the opening and the Dow is off more than 1,000 points already. As for FB, Down 15 on Thursday, Up 15 on Friday and now down 15 in pre-market. Man, that's a three-day pattern I never thought I'd see under any circumstances.JMHO, but there's an old adage about never selling on bad news. Thus, best strategy right now is probably to wait this thing out until normalcy returns. That may take loner than we'd like. But I think we're all smart enough to know that this virus is gonna end sooner or later. Keep the faith."

"I just announced that we're launching Facebook Shops today – the basic idea is that any small business can easily start a shop to sell things directly across our apps. If you visit someone's shop, you'll be able to see that small business's story, see their featured products, and buy them in our apps.I think this particularly important right now because so many small businesses are moving online to deal with the economic fallout from Covid-19. As people are being told to stay home, physical storefronts are having a hard time staying open and millions of people are losing their jobs. I've been personally working with our teams on Facebook Shops every day for the last couple of months so we could accelerate launching it to small businesses who could use tools like this now.Facebook Shops are free and easy to create. When you set up your shop, it will appear on your Facebook and Instagram accounts to start and soon on Messenger and WhatsApp too. Shops are native and fast, which means no more app-switching to a slow mobile web browser where you have to reenter your credit card when you tap on an interesting product you see in feeds. We're also working with partners like Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Channel Advisor, CedCommerce, Cafe24, Tienda Nube and Feedonomics so that small businesses can easily integrate into a strong, open ecosystem of tools to help them manage their customer journey end-to-end, and it's up to the business to decide what level of integration they want. On top of that, we’re building a bunch of features across our apps to help people discover things from small businesses that they might want to buy. We're building a dedicated shopping tab on Instagram and a destination inside Explore where you can find and buy products you might be interested in. Soon, we'll also be launching new Live shopping features across Facebook and Instagram, which will allow you to shop on Live in real-time.Lastly, in the near future Shops will use our AI and augmented reality tech to create better shopping experiences. We'll automatically identify and tag products in feeds so people can easily click-through to purchase when they find things they like. Small businesses will also be able to personalize their storefronts to first show products that are most relevant to you and use augmented reality to let you virtually try on things like sunglasses, lipstick or makeup to see how they might look on you before buying, or what furniture might look like in your room.This all adds up to something quite powerful. If you're running a small business or you're thinking of starting one – even from your living room – you now have a whole suite of tools available that can help you serve people. You can build out your online presence across Facebook and Instagram. You can use Messenger and WhatsApp to communicate with your customers. You can reach new customers through our ads. And now, you can also set up a full online store experience with Facebook Shops. All of these tools are open for business, even when your physical storefront can't be. Hopefully this helps relieve some of the pressure that small businesses are facing right now and helps them prepare for a more online future. I look forward to getting Shops into the world more widely -- let us know what you think!"

"Now, I do admit $SNAP is mostly saturated domestically and in Europe in terms of usage. The real user growth opportunity is going to come from international (think Mexico, East Asia, Latin America, etc.) where purchasing power is lower, but Android is the predominant mobile operating system. In $SNAP's Analyst Day event they highlight the ways they are going to sustain strong engagement. At this point in time, $SNAP has differentiated itself enough from the competition that the risk of competition grabbing users is likely minimal. It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing. At the end of the day, I'm focused on the long-term of this company. The biggest concern about this company is it's valuation. And believe me, I understand the concern. At ~15.7x '22 revenue, it's not cheap. Or is it? Let me break down my valuation for this business, and why it could generate so much more in returns than $FB or $TWTR."

"FB will bounce back eventually. But we might be in one of those spin cycles we've experienced time and time again in the past. Keep in mind that in July of 2017 FB was trading at $177. All the buzz on this message board was how the pps was gonna go over $200 by Labor Day of that year. Didn't happen. Had to deal with one issue after another and watched the stock fall below $150. Over the ensuing year it rallied and was around $216 on August 7th of 2018. Then, pow, more negative news and the stock plummeted $44 in after hours trading. Again it was a slow and yearlong rise back to over $200 by December, 2019 but not before it touched a low in the $120s in December of 2018.There's a pattern here that strongly suggests that, if it repeats, FB's pps will go lower, perhaps a lot lower, before it is viewed favorably by Wall Street and rallies again.Keep in mind, at its current price ($206), FB is only up about $30 bucks since July, 2017. For whatever reason, and despite repeated good earnings over the past 2 1/2 years, unlike APPL, GOOG, TESLA, NETFLIX etc. the big money is averse to allowing FB to follow suit and hit mega highs.Add in the distain the politicians globally have for the most powerful social media platform in the world, and it's easy to see the headwinds the stock price is facing. FB is like the fastest horse in the race (And it is by far.) but the stewards laden it down with excess weight so it can't dominate and win as it should.Yes, very complicated and not an easy situation for small investors like you and me to unravel. Fact is, I don't have a clue where the pps is gonna be in six months. Could be $250 or could be $150. I can make a better case for $250 than $150 based solely on FB's numbers, but as we all know, with FB, it's never just about their numbers. There's always some other chef in the kitchen adding the wrong spice to the stew at the wrong time."
"Oppenheimer raised the target recently to 414. ￼. I disagree because of the massive profits being made, it’s worth 600 now. ￼ People need to realise that in 2024 Facebook will exceed 1000. ￼￼ Jesus will make it rain soon. ￼"
Goodbye 200s soon!
People should starting to cover short now
"Facebook is no longer an audacious company. It’s lost its dazzle and sizzle because the management team has lost its appeal. Change out the leadership and shareholders will benefit: you’ll see a stock split, a potential one-time dividend payout, and more focus on shareholder interests. The share price is undervalued because the management team is disliked and distrusted."
"Following An Insurrection, Lawmakers And State Attorneys General Are Asking Facebook To Halt Ads Of Military Gear“Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”Three senators and four attorneys general demanded Facebook pause or permanently halt the advertisement of military goods and tactical gear following last week’s insurrection at the US Capitol.Two letters — one signed by senators from Illinois, Connecticut, and Ohio, and the other from the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, and Washington, DC — cited Facebook’s role in allowing extremists to organize the Capitol riot and asked its leaders reexamine how they were profiting from national turmoil. Facebook was showing ads for body armor, gun targets, and other weapon accessories in the News Feeds of people who had engaged with content about the attempted coup or followed extremist and far-right organizations on the platform.“Facebook must hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company’s products and platform to further their own illicit aims,” wrote Sens. Tammy Duckworth, Richard Blumenthal, and Sherrod Brown. “Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”Facebook employees had raised concerns internally about the ads. “I’m seeing ads for tactical armor in my news feed,” one employee wrote on Thursday, sharing a screenshot of the advertisement. “When I looked at why I’m seeing these for the first time EVER it says the ads are targeting males in the USA. This is concerning to me, as I have never had any interest in this or anything like it.”Those ads may be shown to people who are being radicalized on the social network. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit industry watchdog group, showed that a Facebook account set up by the organization to follow pages belonging to right-wing extremists and militant organizations was regularly shown ads for military gear in between posts casting doubt on the presidential election and praising the assault on the US Capitol.TTP’s Facebook account, which mimics the activity of a right-wing extremist middle-aged man, continued to see body armor ads as of Friday afternoon.""Facebook has spent years facilitating fringe voices who use the platform to organize and amplify calls for violence,” TTP Director Katie Paul said in a previous statement. “As if that weren't enough, Facebook's advertising microtargeting is directing domestic extremists toward weapons accessories and armor that can make their militarized efforts more effective, all while Facebook profits.""The senators’ note to CEO Mark Zuckerberg asked the company to “immediately develop and execute a Facebook policy permanently prohibiting advertisements of products that a reasonable observer would interpret as primarily designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.” Their letter also asked that the company hire an independent law firm to investigate what role it had played in providing a platform for the planning of the Capitol attack, as well as appoint a member to the board of directors who has “expertise in matters of domestic terrorism.”The four attorneys general wrote, “Halting this advertising while the nation prepares to respond to [an unprecedented] domestic threat is a simple action that Facebook can take to support this response and to help prevent another emergency like the one the country experienced on January 6.”The letters come as Facebook faces landmark antitrust lawsuits from federal and state governments. The attorneys general who wrote the letter are part of a coalition of regulators from the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states and territories that have sued the company for maintaining an illegal monopoly and stifling competition.Both documents were critical of a statement from Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the attempted coup was “largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate.” Despite the company’s efforts, Facebook has been a cauldron for hate and conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.“The public comments of your COO are even more perplexing in light of a public report that your own employees internally flagged advertisements featuring semi-automatic rifles and selling body armor and other equipment as irresponsible and dangerous,” the senators wrote.“We are deeply disappointed that based on the existing facts and circumstances, we have little confidence in your company or your corporate leadership,” they added."
EARNINGS JAN 31st!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see GREEN TODAY! WAY UNDERVALUED! BIG BOYS WANTED CHEAP SHARES!
Love seeing FB going strong today but can't find the news. Does someone have anything on why so stong today with the overall market down? Thanks Long and strong and GO FB!!!!
"Looks Like Seeking Alpha Likes ""FB"".............SummaryFacebook has been dealt a sentiment-induced blow when revelation about their privacy issues re-surfaced over the last few weeks.After an empty questioning by Congress and a European Union law requiring certain privacy-related regulations to take place, Facebook's growth has faced more uncertainty.However, a sum of all parts and future growth potential review shows a disconnect between investor and user sentiment and reality as new growth avenues remain untapped.As a review of all the company's growth factors show the company is undervalued, I believe a $210 price target is highly achievable throughour 2018."
"imagine if nasdaq was +2%, this would be at like 300"
"Since buying into FB in the $20 it will be very satisfying to see the $200 milestone get broken, hoping that comes from the earnings call. That would be sweet!"
"Facebooks hardware efforts will cause more buying, selling and over all Facebook activity. It’s not about the hardware profits and more about the transaction activity. Which will be a plus to the already exploding profits."

The day FB gets in to China the stock will be $300+++
Close in 270S would be a good sign.
What’s funny is they keep posting articles about how much FB board members make like who cares it a 100 billion dollar company lol
Coinbase may have just have contributed to FB's getting government approval and confirmation for Diem/Novi. In my view the be the runway for FB's $500+ price target moving forward.
All time high + apple allowing users to restrict info = puts on deck

FB is way undervalue. Going to $400 soon.
"Heavy investment in AR/VR tech. FB is future proofing itself and it's a mistake to think about FB as a 'social media' company in same way Alphabet is not a search company. It has 10,000 employees in the AR/VR department. Yes, let that sink in. In comparison, Sony has less than 5k. Google and MSFT even less."
I see lots of opps. with 3D VR on igaming including even sports betting or gambling. FB should seriously consider investing n this sector. I see huge rev increase with steady business in coming years .https://www.mageplaza.com/blog/how-ar-vr-transform-gaming-industry.htmlWell I am also long : #MSFT #GOOGL
FAANG stocks have done nothing for 7 months. Time to move on!
Not sees want to control everything
Anyone saying earnings are already built in have ZERO idea what they are talking about. The post Q1 Ad revenue with companies readveristing after opening after COVID will give earnings a massive push. Take at look at FB's free cash flow. It has risen significantly over the past two months; this is an indication of massive ad revenue.
Facebook is up 7.53% to 330.22
"Fossil fuels are now a bigger portion of global energy use than decades ago, rising to 86% today from 81% in 1970, in large part because of oil, gas and coal's falling costs historically and as an expanding global population consumes more.For its part, the U.S. soaks up 20% of daily oil barrels globallyhttps://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210419470/the-worlds-fossil-fuel-addiction-has-only-gotten-stronger-so-heres-where-to-invest-says-wells-fargos-laforge"
So close to 1 billion market cap
"short ratio is high +overshold, it is time to buy"
It would be nice to see FB pay a dividend. I did not realize the money you make on dividends until I bought Apples years ago. I look at the free stock I get on every payout and it adds up. Talk to people who have owned stocked with dividends. The new thing for me is to add up reinvested dividends back into  Apple and multiple it by stock price and it's 10s of thousands of dollars. It is nice to be paid while you wait for the stock to move up.
Just saw an article about FB getting to $400 per share. BS.
THANK YOU SHORTS FOR YOUR MONEY!
FB on FIYA’ today!!!!
FB is still the cheapest and only “extreme value play” in FANG and in the S & P 500 mega cap sector!*** Today’s rally is confirmation of that “irrefutable fact”!
Open much lower and lawsuits coming.
"WHAT'S HOLDING FB BACK??? SHARE COUNT...The problem with FB stock is too MANY outstanding shares ppl. Googl-298.7m. NFLX-434.7m. AMZN-485.2m. FB?? 2.4B. with a ""B"". That's the problem, too many shares to go around and harder for it to move as fast as the others mentioned. IF Zuckerberg were to announce a ""share buyback"" of say 200-400m. shares, could you imagine what it would do for the share price???!! THAT'S what he should be doing right now..."
200 quick
Bring them on. I just believe one thing that FB will blow up the estimate earnings this quarter. SHOP has great growth rate both revenue and earnings. Instagram is like the magnet that shows no sign of slow down in Asia.
Finally up 1006.2% I put my life savings in this stock when I was 22... since then I’ve sold shares here and there but still own a few hundred... cheers to the longs.. will only get better as the years go on! :)
I think some of you have fallen in love with FB shares that it doesn’t matter what they do
"It was a great ride up with FB, TSLA, GOOG, NFLX, etc. and decided to sell all my ""larger market movers"", to raise some cash for now. Good luck all!"

"I have 170, 180, and 190 CALLs for next Friday, April 20th. Most of them purchased days or weeks ago."
"Lol. FB at all time highs and the shorts double down...FB has given very little to shorts since the time it IPO'd and that is only going to continue to be the case going forward. I expect tons of thumbs down but FB shorts represent incompetence at its finest...this company is practically bullet proof. Rising rates can't knock it down, it represents GARP (growth at a reasonable price), has stellar earnings and cash flow growth, 62 billion in cash and no debt, etc. And Washington more than likely won't make FB cough up Instagram and What's App. Odds are 95 percent likely that scenario won't play out. The haters will still be here at 400, then 500. The only people who don't like FB stock are people who don't know anything about investing. The bull case I laid out over the weekend wasn't just my own thoughts, Barron's said the exact same thing. Are the yahoo shorts smarter than Barron's? That's like asking if drunk driving is a smart idea. If you have to think about the answer investing clearly is not for you. There is still tremendous value to be unlocked in FB. The only question is are you going to take advantage or are you going to let your misguided beliefs that a data leak like what happened over the weekend is going to make shorts rich, which it won't. Not to mention the belief that this company has done more harm than good. I'm not here to convert the haters, just lay out how idiotic it is to bet against this company. Unlike the people who post negative stuff about FB on here, I'm not trying to score brownie points. Smart people get it. The dumb ones who lean on misguided morals will only hate the stock more as it goes up instead of down."

"This is a battle between print and television media versus Facebook, and the print/tv entities are leading a full-throttle assault against Facebook in retaliation for the reshaping of the advertising industry, which has greatly worked against tv and print houses. They’ve lost a lot of ad dollars to Facebook and google, and they will continue to do so as the digital ad model becomes more robust and ubiquitous, and as Facebook and Google continue to grab market share. This has nothing to do with privacy issues!!"
Yesterday I read a post concerning a judgement against FB which amounted to a few million. The post dismissed the amount as it amounts to only one days profit. The problem I have is every country that allows FB will similarly sue and have to pay. These countries all need money to fund all their programs. The cost of lawyers will be in the billion. When they loose the law suits they will be ordered to restrict their business causing them to loose additional billions in revenue. Things may look fine now but their business model is unsustainable. I look forward to reading any rebuttal.
We got to break 315 today and hold it steadty to 325. I pray unto thee in Jesus name.
FB is now in customer retention mode which means zero growth for the stock. This is a strong sell here at $320.
yahoo liberals stop deleting my post you shuk too
Still will not come back to FB
you guys are going to think I'm crazy... but I think indexes are going to test 200 sma lines again. That's gonig to bring nasdaq to $8612 and dow to $25506 and sp500 to $2964... We're in a tech bubble and it's going to crash the markets.. $msft $amzn $goog $fb $twtr $zm $nflx

"U.S. senator urges FTC to interview Facebook ex-officialsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican and a tough critic of the big tech companies, urged the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday to interview some former employees of Facebook Inc FB.O as part of its probe of the social media giant.Both the FTC and groups of state attorneys general are widely believed to be planning litigation against Facebook for breaking antitrust law.In her letter to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, Blackburn referred to an FTC deposition of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, adding: “While that is promising, I encourage you to also speak to other Facebook executives and engineers who can reveal the company’s real agenda. Many of them fear letting Facebook’s dominance go unchecked can hold dark consequences for competitors and consumers alike.”Blackburn specifically urged the FTC to interview such Facebook critics as company co-founder Chris Hughes, former chief security officer Alex Stamos and Yael Eisenstat, former head of Facebook’s elections integrity effort.Blackburn said that internet regulation, which is something Congress would take up, was not sufficient. “Americans depend on the commission to stand up to Facebook and to fully prosecute entities that violate the Sherman Antitrust Act,” she wrote.Pursuing the tech giants -- the Justice Department sued Alphabet’s Google last month while Amazon and Apple remain under investigation -- is one thing that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on despite a polarized political atmosphere.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Democrat, has urged that Facebook be required to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014."

Good to see FB selling. It will sky rocket after earnings.
Chauvin's lawyer is that good! I said from day one that this will be a mis-trial or manslaughter 5 years or less with good behavior. Chauvin did exactly how he was trained (regardless of whether it was good or bad) and his lawyer also proved reasonable doubt. It only takes one juror for a mis-trial. I would hate to live in any city no matter what the outcome ;)

Thumbs down all you want, you’ll still be broke."
God forbid this stock actually may trade up to where’s its earnings warrant it.

"The fate of Facebook’s business model may lie in the hands of the European Union Supreme CourtThe supreme court of the European Union has been drawn into a German battle over whether Facebook’s broad collection of user data is in breach of competition rules, in a landmark challenge threatening the viability of the technology giant’s business model.The decision will be closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic amid a global effort to regulate Big Tech that has picked up speed over the past year.The case involving the German competition regulator, the Bundeskartellamt, represents a unique nexus between privacy and competition laws. The regulator has effectively used data protection regulations as a method of challenging Facebook’s market power.The Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf said on Wednesday that it would ask the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) to issue an opinion on whether the competition regulator was right to determine that Facebook was in breach of the EU’s data protection rules, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).“The question of whether Facebook is abusing its dominant position…because it collects and uses the data of its users in violation of the GDPR can not be decided without referring to the ECJ,” said the court, chaired by Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kühnen, in a written statement that has been translated.Wednesday’s hearing is just the latest development in a case that stretches back to February 2019, when the Bundeskartellamt ordered Facebook to curb its data collection.The regulator said at the time that the social media giant abused its market position by harvesting user data across its platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as from third-party services."

"EU’s top privacy regulator urges ban on surveillance-based ad targetingThe European Union’s lead data protection supervisor has recommended that a ban on targeted advertising based on tracking Internet users’ digital activity be included in a major reform of digital services rules which aims to increase operators’ accountability, among other key goals.The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorówski, made the call for a ban on surveillance-based targeted ads in reference to the Commission’s Digital Services Act (DSA) — following a request for consultation from EU lawmakers.The intervention by Europe’s lead data protection supervisor calling for a ban on targeted ads is a powerful pre-emptive push against attempts to water down legislative protections for consumer interests.In his opinion on the DSA the EDPS writes that“Given the multitude of risks associated with online targeted advertising, the EDPS urges the co-legislators to consider additional rules going beyond transparency,” he goes on. “Such measures should include a phase-out leading to a prohibition of targeted advertising on the basis of pervasive tracking, as well as restrictions in relation to the categories of data that can be processed for targeting purposes and the categories of data that may be disclosed to advertisers or third parties to enable or facilitate targeted advertising.”It’s the latest regional salvo aimed at mass-surveillance-based targeted ads after the European Parliament called for tighter rules back in October — when it suggested EU lawmakers should consider a phased in ban."

"Data Harvester Facebook Loses Court Fight Over Halting EU-US Data TransfersLONDON (AP) — Facebook lost a legal battle Friday with Ireland’s data privacy watchdog over a European Union privacy decision that could result in the social network being forced to stop transferring data to the U.S.The Irish High Court rejected Facebook’s bid to block a draft decision by the country’s Data Protection Commission to inquire into, and order the suspension of, the company’s data flows between the European Union and the U.S.Judge David Barniville wrote in his judgement that he concluded Facebook “must fail on those grounds of challenge and that it is, therefore, not entitled to any of the reliefs claimed in the proceedings.”The Irish watchdog had launched its inquiry last year shortly after a ruling by the EU’s top court striking down an agreement covering EU-U.S. data transfers known as Privacy Shield, saying it didn’t do enough to protect users from U.S. government cybersnooping.The Data Protection Commission “welcomes today’s judgment,” spokesman Graham Doyle said."

I own shares in a few social media companies each has it's positive merits inc. FB and areas to improve. I think Spt an under the radar, not well known company with earnings today is a very compelling investment in the entire sector."

"Reporters without Borders sues Facebook over hate speechPARIS, March 23 (Reuters) - Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has filed a lawsuit against Facebook in France over hate speech and false information, the global media watchdog said in a statement on Tuesday.RSF said that in a lawsuit filed with the public prosecutor in Paris on Monday, it accuses Facebook of allowing large-scale proliferation of hate speech - notably against journalists - and false information despite promises to provide a safe online environment.""Using expert analyses, personal testimony and statements from former Facebook employees, RSF’s lawsuit demonstrates that ... it (Facebook) allows disinformation and hate speech to flourish on its network ... contrary to the claims made in its terms of service and through its ads,"" RSF said.A Facebook France spokesman said he could not immediately comment on the RSF initiative.RSF said that a court ruling against Facebook in France had the potential to have a global impact and that it was considering filing similar lawsuits in other countries.It added that the suit concerned Facebook France and Facebook Ireland and is based on the French consumer code, under which companies using deceptive commercial practices can be liable to fines of up to 10% of annual turnover."

Throughout American history freedom of speech has been protected and their have been radicals, marxists, communists, etc that have pushed the envelope. The ACLU and American press always defended the 1st amendment.

"Things looking good for the Market and FB. However, a word of caution. Even though fundamentals for both remain strong, I just have a feeling that we're probably gonna see a day over the next week or ten days when the Dow and Nasdaq take a big hit if for no other reason that no index or stock continually goes straight upward. Some FB puts are pretty cheap right now. Might be an inexpensive way to pick up some nice profits if what I'm feeling comes to pass. Long term, I still believe FB is gonna break $200 and challenge some of those recently announced price targets."

"Facebook accused of taking money for ads to fake people after disabling 1.3 billion fake accountsFacebook, which in 2019 paid advertisers a $40 million settlement over inflated video-viewing metrics and is fighting a lawsuit over its “reach” to users, is now taking flak over its revelation this week that it took down 1.3 billion fake accounts during just three months last year.“How much money was spent advertising to these fake accounts?” said Angelo Carusone, CEO of progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.Carusone noted that U.S. taxpayers bankroll ads on Facebook via government agencies including U.S. Health and Human Services and the U.S. Census Bureau. Advertising analysis firm Pathmatics reported that the Census Bureau in the first six months of last year put more than $51 million, or 61% of its digital-advertising budget, into Facebook. Neither of the federal agencies immediately answered questions about the fake-accounts issue.Facebook is facing intense scrutiny in Congress over its digital-advertising dominance and was sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission late last year in an anti-trust action. The firm has been in hot water before over the numbers it puts out for users and user activity — metrics advertisers rely on to guide spending. In 2019, without admitting wrongdoing, it paid the $40 million settlement after advertisers accused it of inflating video-viewing metrics by up to 900%.The company is still in federal court in San Francisco battling a 2018 class-action lawsuit accusing it of overstating to advertisers the number of people their ads could reach, despite senior executives allegedly knowing for years about the exaggeration and a manager describing the issue in an internal communication as “a lawsuit waiting to happen.”"
I have never understood how FB earn money on ads. I never see any because i use ad blockers. Can someone explain?
$FB today it crossed last set benchmark and topped 52 wk high. Investors are holding from the lot of 188 from 10 days back would like it to go $200+. I see it at 198 on jan 31 and 207 on Feb 1.
"Betting against FB is like jumping out of a plane without parachute. Not a question of if you will get hurt, but how badly."
No matter how much you hate FB they keep bringing in the money. When you’re investing it’s about revenue and profit not how much you like a company
Facebook can make the necessary changes and move beyond this

"Ok folks, this board is saturated with desperate shorts working over time to steal your shares. The nonsense about the leaked personal info is so old news. No one gives a hoot about this, Facebook is a huge company with plenty of levers it can still pull. It’s “Cheap” by all standards. Repeat after me, “Facebook is cheap”, but won’t stay cheap for long."
"Boycotts of Twitter, Facebook and Google have proven to be somewhat ineffective.

"FB should settle at $315 today, and then $350 by end of this month.When FB shopping is online, another Amazon is in making. I can't image how much FB will be, maybe $1000/share."
loving it
"It should be clear now that this “scandal” is not going to have a major affect on the company. Users aren’t leaving. Advertisers aren’t leaving. Undue regulatory burdens aren’t coming. The business model isn’t in danger. They restated that they’ll be hiring more for security and whatnot, but they already said that on a previous earnings call. So while they may tick that up a little more, these aren’t exactly new and unexpected costs. There’s really no reason for this stock to below the $185 price it was at when this hit."
FB and Twitter are only going to be owned by liberal socialists due to censorship . . . in the end they will never grow enough or make revenue growth projections thus dead money!
Delayed earnings rally coming....$200++ this week....on to $240 by 2020...
Time to sell
At $320 per share for FB there is a significant expectation for growth. You cannot kick 50% of the U.S. population to the curb and expect the company to grow. Get out over $300.
"Most hedge funds are long stocks. They use 40 to 1 margin to buy stocks so the stocks skyrocket because of huge margin buying power. The hedge fund which long Chinese Internet stocks, Viacom and Discover Channels got trouble, then they need to sell some shares. The stock down 25% to 50% in five sessions. That is the consequence 40 to 1 margin power goes wrong. The problem is that the rallies behind all growth stocks are such 40 to 1 margin buying power. Every stock will produce a bomb when the bear market comes."

FB is a great company and I finally bought in today at ave cost of $184.16. Sold my GE after going through my portfolio to have only the best performing companies financially. FB: $184.82GE: $15.34ABBV: $106.85 (this is a great co that I bought around $92.56 recently).

"UK government launches new technology regulator aimed at surveillance giants Google and FacebookThe UK government has launched a new technology regulator aimed at checking the dominance of the biggest tech giants.It will first examine codes of conduct and how they could properly enforce competition between big companies such as Facebook and Google as well as smaller firms.The body, called the Digital Markets Unit or DMU, will look to increase competition in the tech industry. The government said it hopes that will encourage more choice, stricter control over personal data, and fairer prices.“Today is a major milestone in the path to creating the world’s most competitive online markets, with consumers, entrepreneurs and content publishers at their heart,” said digital secretary Oliver Dowden.“This will pave the way for the development of new digital services and lower prices, give consumers more choice and control over their data, and support our news industry, which is vital to freedom of expression and our democratic values.”The CMA previously urged the government to grant the new unit the ability to apply “significant penalties” for code breaches.It believes the regime should take a three-pillared approach to regulating tech firms, including blocking or reversing decisions made by the companies to improve competition, and having greater scrutiny over potential mergers, as well as enforcing the new code of conduct.Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: “People shopping on the internet and sharing information online should be able to enjoy the choice, secure data and fair prices that come with a dynamic and competitive industry.“Today is another step towards creating a level playing field in digital markets.Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: “Our new, unashamedly pro-competition regime will help to curb the dominance of tech giants, unleash a wave of innovation throughout the market, and ensure smaller firms aren’t pushed out.”"

Once this gets rolling, there will be no stopping it.....every major company in the world will want in, or they run the risk of being left behind.But wait, it gets better. After this move is established, next move is in insurance.....HUGE profit margins! FB will change the insurance markets exactly the same way they will change the financial markets. Both segments will be automated.....no moving parts....total automation. Zuckerberg is smart, in a very simplistic way. He doesn't want to get into all the logistics of Amazon...or WalMart....way too many moving pieces. My guess, by the end of next year, once things get rolling, FB will be around $500 a share....which is less than a 150% increase from where it is now. Very do-able."

"The fact I get so many thumbs down for bullish comments about FB is comical. The only people who thumbs down this do so because they think the company is evil. They don't care that this stock is a golden ticket to riches. FB will only continue to do better and better while the haters are left with their resentments. Sorry but I don't get my feelings hurt by ignorant thumbs downers. If you really want to hurt my feelings you are going to have to take away all the money I've made since first investing in FB in 2013. Those hoping for an implosion are delusional. The only way FB revisits levels from where I first bought it is through a stock split. This company is extremely undervalued at these levels and a solid company to be in in the good times and the bad. So keep up your thumbs downing...you are only reaffirming your idiocy to me, not hurting my feelings."

"Seeking Alpha !!! Oh Yes....................

"I posted this on Market Watch- they blocked it because it dont agree with them. (If the politicians wanted to tax the rich a simple flat tax so easy to do on 2-3 pages not 2-3 K pages. Exempt medical & food ONLY add the tax at retail level. A 10 million dollar home would pay 2 million tax at 20%, a 200K home would be 20 thousand. That is taxing the rich , but politicians will give enough exemptions that Warren B & Bill G will never know it happened.)"
Why does the trade war with China send the FB price down? FB is banned in China!
"While the FB haters continue to post their moral reasons trying to tell you to sell your FB shares or not buy, I continue to buy hand over fist, because this company is drowning in cash, is growing rapidly, has huge cash flows, and at these levels is undervalued greatly, and it has an unquestionable moat. I never let my morals dictate what I invest in unless the company commits fraud, something FB has not done. I eagerly welcome the insults and the thumbs downers...my cost basis in FB is an average of $66, what are the bears gonna do, rob me of my money by repeatedly hitting the thumbs down button? No, they are just going to stay poor while I get richer and richer. These lawsuits are not going to end FB's reign as king of social media. They are all smoke and mirrors to try and scare longs away. But the smart ones can see past all this short term noise. FB will be a $500 stock in a few years, and the moral haters will still be complaining as badly as ever. Idiots."
"U.S. Supreme Court rebuffs Facebook appeal in user tracking lawsuit(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away Facebook Inc's bid to pare back a $15 billion class action lawsuit accusing the company of illegally tracking the activities of internet users even when they are logged out of the social media platform.The justices declined to hear Facebook's appeal of a lower court ruling that revived the proposed nationwide litigation accusing the company of violating a federal law called the Wiretap Act by secretly tracking the visits of users to websites that use Facebook features such as the ""like"" button.The litigation also accuses the company of violating the privacy rights of its users under California law but Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court involved only the Wiretap Act.Four individuals filed the proposed nationwide class action lawsuit in California federal court seeking $15 billion in damages for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook's actions between April 2010 and September 2011. The company stopped its nonconsensual tracking after it was exposed by a researcher in 2011, court papers said.Facebook said it protects the privacy of its users and should not have to face liability over commonplace computer-to-computer communications. Facebook has more than 2.4 billion users worldwide, including more than 200 million in the United States.The case centers on Facebook's use of features called ""plug-ins"" that third-parties often incorporate into their websites to track the browsing histories of users. Along with digital files called ""cookies"" that can help identify internet users, the plaintiffs accused Facebook of packaging this tracked data and selling it to advertisers for profit.Facebook said it uses the data it receives to tailor the content it shows its users and to improve ads on its service.A federal judge dismissed the case in 2017 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 revived it, allowing the Wiretap Act and state privacy claims to go ahead.""Facebook's user profiles would allegedly reveal an individual's likes, dislikes, interests and habits over a significant amount of time, without affording users a meaningful opportunity to control or prevent the unauthorized exploration of their private lives,"" the 9th Circuit said in its ruling."

"Don't Be Greedy Dept.:If someone told you last January that FB would close out 2017 at $176 per share, we longs all would have been excited. Somewhere along the way we allowed our thoughts to sway toward greed (Hey, it's only natural.) and visions of $200+ started to creep into our minds last summer when we crossed $170, a target price offered by many pundits at the time, with almost six months to go.Alas, FB has pretty much moved sideways since then and we now find many lamenting its performance and even questioning if they should sell and move on or stay the course. Instead of looking at where we are now as a let down, try to wrap your arms around the thought that we all might have gotten just a little ahead of ourselves with expectations.No stock goes up in a straight uninterrupted line. FB is no exception to that rule. What's important for the future is to properly assess where FB is now and where we think it might be a year or two down the road. If the analysts' target prices are a viable barometer for properly evaluating that scenario, then we all should be feeling fairly safe and secure owning FB as almost all of the predictions are positive with anticipated prices well north of $200.I'll take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy New Year. And if all (!!!!) FB's pps does in 2018 is repeat its performance of 2017, come this time next year, I'll be a very happy man.Peace!"

"Ireland privacy regulator to investigate Facebook over massive data dumpLONDON — Ireland’s privacy regulator said Wednesday it has opened an investigation into Facebook after data on more than 500 million users was reportedly found dumped online, in a suspected violation of strict European Union privacy rules.The Data Protection Commission said it decided to start investigating following “multiple international media reports” about the data dump.News reports earlier this month said the data was found on a website for hackers and contained information on 533 million users from more than 100 countries, including names, Facebook IDs, phone numbers, locations, birthdates and email addresses.The watchdog said it launched the investigation after it “engaged with Facebook Ireland,” questioning it about compliance with privacy rules. The company responded, the Irish agency said, suggesting it wasn’t satisfied with the answers.The company has previously downplayed the problem, saying “malicious actors” didn’t hack its systems but used automated software to scrape the data from Facebook’s platform.The problem stemmed from a vulnerability, reported and fixed in 2019, in features that allow users to import contacts.Still, it’s another example of the vast amount of information collected by Facebook and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is. And even though Facebook has patched the vulnerability, the user data is already out in the open and could be exploited by fraudsters.Facebook, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has its European headquarters in Ireland, making that country’s watchdog its lead privacy regulator for the European Union under a system known as “one-stop shop.”Irish regulators are already working on a dozen other investigations of Facebook and Instagram over suspected privacy breaches."

"The Creepy Way Facebook, Google And Amazon Profit Off Our Private DataOur lives and habits are being tracked. Every time we tap in a Google search, every time we click “Like” on Facebook and every time we make an Amazon purchase, we are giving away information about ourselves: our thoughts, our preferences, our behaviors.We are providing data that can be packaged up and sold to companies, which then use that data to try to modify our behavior and steer us toward buying products or using their services.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it the commodification of human data. In the information era we live in, she explains in her new book, “The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are the marketable product. It’s a terrifying idea.So, what is surveillance capitalism?It’s important to know that in many ways, surveillance capitalism differs dramatically from other forms of capitalism over the last couple of centuries. Capitalism is claiming things that live outside the marketplace, bringing them into the market and turning them into what people call “commodities,” things that can be sold and purchased.Industrial capitalism, which dominated the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, famously claimed nature. The trees and the forests and the rivers — these are entities that have a life of their own. Industrial capitalism brought nature into the market dynamic, and nature was reborn. It was called “land,” and it was called “real estate.” That allowed it to be sold and purchased and become the source of profit.Surveillance capitalism proceeds according to this pattern, but with a dark and unexpected twist. So unexpected, in fact, that it’s taken us quite a while to catch on to what they’ve actually done. Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience for the market dynamic.It says that private human experience is now a source of free, raw material — just like harvesting wheat or collecting ore from a mountain side. [We are] a source of free, raw material that can be processed into data, and those data can be computed and sold and purchased and owned.That sequence has created the largest, wealthiest and most powerful companies — like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — that the world has ever known. All of that begins with the unilateral declaration that private human experience is ours for the taking.Ultimately, what surveillance capitalists are trying to do is sell predictions. It’s not only to know our behavior, but it’s to predict our behavior. That’s how they make their money.Those predictions are not to improve our lives, but rather they’re sold to business customers who have a business interest in knowing what we will do next — because that raises the certainty that they have about how to successfully get us to behave in a way that serves their bottom line."

"Here's a thought. Has anyone here ever directly given any of the credit reporting companies permission to disclose your debt payment patterns? Have any of us ever told banks, S & Ls, mortgage companies, department stores, finance companies etc. that it's OK for them to disclose how we pay our bills?I bet the answer is know. All these folks, and more, took it upon themselves to inform the credit rating agencies about us. Now the likes of Equifax resells that data to interested concerns who pay to see our credit history.I find that more egregious than data FB provides if only for the fact that I am responsible for what I post on my FB page, and I knew ahead of time that a profile of my likes and dislikes might be used for ad targeting."
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Stocks-tracker.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. FB exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
I would sell when FB gets done monetizing Insta and WhatsApp. But that process is in start up phase lol. Facebook and the govt work hand in hand for info. Buy the dip lol. No debt billion and billions in profits.

"FB has the best earning growth rate over 50%, and the revenue growth rate is the mid 20%, why the analysts' annual earnings is just 11 dollars. My number is over 13 dollars this year.

FB already signals that the earnings for the first quarter is even better than the 4th Q 2020. so I am so confused ??????????????"
"I post this every month for you investors, we own a large franchising company.

I have been saying since $240 a share that Facebook is highly undervalued. I had always received a lot of feedback disagreeing or negative regarding Facebook. Like I was saying at $240 this is high undervalued now at $288 this is still highly undervalued.
"No matter how Zuck spins his latest dictatorial move, there is gonna be a backlash. Of course, Zuck won't suffer personally. After all, exactly how many billions does one need to eke by an existence? Sadly, we shareholders are gonna be laden with the consequences of his actions. I've read some reports about conservative groups rallying to drop FB. In other words, ""If you don't want us, then we don't want you!"" Already, there's a determination by conservatives to never stay at a Marriott property again. Unlike social media outlets, hotel users have dozens upon dozens of choices. Hope I'm wrong, but for FB shareholders, I got a feeling this is gonna get ugly before it gets pretty again."

In terms of Oculus Store content support, there are Oculus Start, free one-year Unity Plus membership and so on, which have made great efforts.On why Facebook chose and dove into VR years ago, Zuckerberg said: ""We're able to build the VR experience now because it's essentially an evolution of the smartphone, whether it's the display, the chip, the supply chain, it's all matured.""It's important for Facebook to invest in an area where it can see revenue faster.

"FB is an anomaly in this market. 0 debt, over $62B in cash means the rising interest rates are not going to affect it since cost of debt doesn't exist. It also nearly as much FCF as net income, which is insane and FCF growing at 25-30% Yoy. Even bearishly putting a WACC at 9.4% gives a fair value of $325 a share based on my DCF model.Even just adjusting the market cap for cash on hand puts it at $298 a share.Only headwind is the potentially higher corporate tax rates and anti-trust, both of which are not too worrisome and baked in I believe.Monster company"

"Investor Place 7/16/18...""5 stocks that could double in the next 5 years"".Between Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, Facebook has 6 billion monthly active users. Only 2.2 billion of those users are “fully monetized” (the Facebook ones). The billion on Instagram are just starting to be monetized, and the 1.5 billion on WhatsApp and 1.3 billion on Messenger have yet to be monetized at scale.Imagine Facebook does start to monetize fully across its whole ecosystem. The long-term implications are quite profound.It is unlikely Facebook maintains its current sky-high Facebook platform ARPU (north of $20 on a trailing twelve month basis, and up 31% year-over-year last quarter) on Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. But it is very likely that Facebook monetizes those users at at least the same level as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which reported ARPU of just under $7.50 last year.Considering ARPU is just trending up at Facebook, it really isn’t unreasonable to assume ARPU of $20 across all users in the Facebook ecosystem in five years. Considering the whole user base is still growing, it also isn’t unreasonable to assume Facebook’s ecosystem numbers 7 billion in five years.A 7 billion user ecosystem at a $20 ARPU implies revenues in five years of $140 billion. At 50% operating margins, that should flow into roughly $20 in EPS in five years. A growth-average 20 forward multiple on $20 implies a four-year forward price target for FB stock of $400, versus $200 today.This is one of the most undervalued hyper-growth stocks in the market. The company owns a ton of valuable digital real estate, most of which the company will start monetizing over the next several years. That will push FB stock way higher."

All my friends and family use Facebook daily. Their kids all have Instagram accounts. They love it! Can’t get enough of it. The market share in this space makes this a a great long term investment.

"Facebook says a breach that hit 533m is old news. Experts disagreeAfter information from 533 million Facebook users was exposed to hackers, the company has tried to reassure users, saying that the data was leaked years ago and has since been secured.But experts say the issue is still grave – whether it happened in 2021 or years prior – largely because of the nature of the leaked data.The dataset, first reported by Business Insider, contained information from 106 countries including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates and email addresses. Even if it did not include passwords, the data is significant because those identifiers don’t often change, said Rob Shavell, chief executive officer of DeleteMe, a personal data protection tool.“Even if the data is old, it’s never really old because it will always be useful for data brokers,” he said. “It helps them correlate related information that is new and dump them into these profiles, which they sell online for as little as 99 cents.”That the leak dates back to 2019 may actually work to Facebook’s detriment: under some privacy regulations, including Europe’s GDPR, that means the company should have alerted users under privacy-related reporting requirements. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission announced on Tuesday it was investigating the breach to see if it violated any rules.“The DPC attempted over the weekend to establish the full facts and is continuing to do so,” it said in a statement. “It received no proactive communication from Facebook.”Related: Facebook data leak: details from 533 million users found on website for hackersThe data probably changed hands many times, said Ivan Righi, cyberthreat intelligence analyst at the San Francisco cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. He said it appeared the data had initially been listed at a relatively steep price, limiting the number of hackers who were willing to buy.“The breach was probably re-sold multiple times since then until the price lowered enough that a user decided to publicly expose it to generate a small profit and increase reputation,” he said, adding that this behavior was common for hackers. “While the data may be old, it still holds a lot of value to cybercriminals.”Data leaked from Facebook can be used in combination with existing user data online to hack accounts, including bank and other accounts that require two-factor authentication – texting a confirmation code to a phone number to verify a person’s identity. The leaking of phone numbers can also be problematic amid the meteoric rise of robocalls in recent years.“Forget about being hacked, it’s just annoying to be constantly getting spam calls,” Shavell said. “The data breach, whether they say it’s old or not, is another way spammers get this information.”The latest breach adds fuel to the antitrust fight that has been brewing in Washington. Facebook has experienced data security issues in the past, most notably when the political firm Cambridge Analytica accessed information of up to 87 million users without their knowledge.The new breach also calls attention to the need for additional regulations in the EU, said Varoon Bashyakarla, a data scientist who works as a technical advisor to the Real Facebook Oversight Board – an activist group intended to hold Facebook accountable for content decisions. Bashyakarla said his own data had been exposed in the breach.“This incident underscores the need for Facebook to respond to European regulators and not merely American ones,” he said. “If there are no consequences for incidents like this one, they will continue, as we’ve observed over the last several years.”The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which called the newly revealed breach “horrific”, said Facebook’s dominance in the tech industry directly contributed to hacks like these. There are few options for users who, fed up with privacy breaches, do not want to use the platform – Facebook already owns alternatives including Instagram and WhatsApp.“Privacy does not come from monopoly,” Cory Doctorow of EFF said. “Facebook’s data breach problems are the inevitable result of monopoly, in particular the knowledge that it can heap endless abuses on its users and retain them.”"

"Muslim civil rights group sues Facebook for making deceptive statementsA civil rights group is suing Facebook and its executives, saying CEO Mark Zuckerberg made “false and deceptive"" statements to Congress when he said the giant social network removes hate speech and other material that violates its rules.The lawsuit, filed by Muslim Advocates in Washington, D.C., Superior Court on Thursday, claims Zuckerberg and other senior executives “have engaged in a coordinated campaign to convince the public, elected representatives, federal officials, and non-profit leaders in the nation’s capital that Facebook is a safe product.""Facebook, the lawsuit alleges, has been repeatedly alerted to hate speech and calls to violence on its platform and done nothing or very little. Making false and deceptive statements about removing hateful and harmful content violates the District of Columbia's consumer-protection law and its bar on fraud, the lawsuit says.“Every day, ordinary people are bombarded with harmful content in violation of Facebook’s own policies on hate speech, bullying, harassment, dangerous organizations, and violence,” the lawsuit says. “Hateful, anti-Muslim attacks are especially pervasive on Facebook.”Facebook declined to comment beyond the statement, which did not address the lawsuit's allegations that it has not removed hate speech and anti-Muslim networks from its platform even after it was notified of their existence.For example, the lawsuit cites research by Elon University professor Megan Squire, who published research about anti-Muslim groups on Facebook and alerted the company. According to the lawsuit, Facebook did not remove the groups — but it did change how outside academics can access its platform so that the kind of research Squire did would be “impossible other than if done by Facebook employees."""

"$GOOG $WIMI $FB ""What's the biggest concern in the tech world right now? Holographic projection is definitely on the list. The technique was invented in 1947 by Hungarian-born British physicist Dennis Gabor, who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in physics for his work. The technique has been used in electron microscopy since its invention, in the field known as electron holographic projection, but holographic projection did not make substantial progress until the invention of the laser in 1960. This technology is now used in so-called secret technologies known as Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap.Holographic projection is a kind of display technology, it needs medium, and it has to be done in real time, and it can interact with people. We call it a ""holographic medium,"" and it can't be created out of thin air, which is why it's so hard to make the technology popular right now. A holographic projection projects an image onto a holographic medium, thereby rendering the 3D effect in front of people's eyes. Also known as virtual imaging, augmented reality (AR) is one of the most popular applications of this technology.Holography relies on holographic phantom technology and uses optical imaging principle to present three-dimensional images in space, so that viewers can have a strong 3D three-dimensional impression.When 3D holographic technology is integrated into the traditional stage drama, the technology expands the imagination of the director infinitely, and provides a space for the stage art to be fully released. It outputs the concept of spatial imaging and forms such a holographic stage full of science fiction elements.Holographic imaging system uses artificial intelligence, virtual interaction, augmented reality and other interdisciplinary integration, in order to achieve the most realistic holographic effect of science fiction, and achieve the integration of humanities, science and technology, tourism and other industries.Unlike VR and 3D videos, holographic stage productions do not require any wearable devices to be worn. Moreover, AR technology, motion capture technology and other ""stage black technology"" can be combined to create interactive performance experience. Through AR technology, the actors or audience are collected in real time to realize the holographic interactive works performed by real people, virtual people and real-time collected audience on the same stage."""

"Latest data leak proves why Facebook users should purge their personal data from Facebook • The personal data of over 500 million Facebook users has been posted online in a low-level hacking forum. • The data includes phone numbers, full names, location, email address, and biographical information. • Security researchers warn that the data could be used by hackers to impersonate people and commit fraud.A user in a low level hacking forum on Saturday published the phone numbers and personal data of hundreds of millions of Facebook users for free online.The exposed data includes personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and — in some cases — email addresses.Insider reviewed a sample of the leaked data and verified several records by matching known Facebook users' phone numbers with the IDs listed in the data set. We also verified records by testing email addresses from the data set in Facebook's password reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user's phone number.While a couple of years old, the leaked data could provide valuable information to cybercriminals who use people's personal information to impersonate them or scam them into handing over login credentials, according to Alon Gal, CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, who first discovered the entire trough of leaked data online on Saturday.""A database of that size containing the private information such as phone numbers of a lot of Facebook's users would certainly lead to bad actors taking advantage of the data to perform social engineering attacks [or] hacking attempts,"" Gal told Insider.Gal first discovered the leaked data in January when a user in the same hacking forum advertised an automated bot that could provide phone numbers for hundreds of millions of Facebook users in exchange for a price. Motherboard reported on that bot's existence at the time and verified that the data was legitimate.Now, the entire dataset has been posted on the hacking forum for free, making it widely available to anyone with rudimentary data skills.Gal said that, from a security standpoint, there's not much Facebook can do to help users affected by the breach since their data is already out in the open — but he added that Facebook could notify users so they could remain vigilant for possiblephishing schemes or fraud using their personal data.""Individuals signing up to a reputable company like Facebook are trusting them with their data and Facebook [is] supposed to treat the data with utmost respect,"" Gal said. ""Users having their personal information leaked is a huge breach of trust and should be handled accordingly."""
Keep holding the bag.. it’s going downhill from here.

"WOW, this is the only stock that's down........so sad."
"The consumer is offering their viewership, to be subjected to targeted advertising, based on the consumer’s personal information, which FB sells to the highest bidder. That’s the relevant market on which the FTC should focus its antitrust violations, and that’s not free to the consumer"

"Facebook profit is deadlyThe antitrust action filed by 48 states and territories against Facebook gives us hope that tech firms will one day be held responsible for the harms they have caused our society. But we’re left wondering: Why are state prosecutors focused only on Facebook’s monopolistic behavior? What about the firm’s facilitation of serious crime and extremism?The Alliance to Counter Crime Online, which we run, tracks how tech platforms enable a wide range of illicit actors to reach vast audiences to market their goods, negotiate prices, raise money and accept payment. Facebook profits off this illegal activity from the ads for commercial products that appear in the feeds of users who come online in search of illegal ones. This symbiotic relationship benefits Facebook and criminals, but its impact on ordinary people can be deadly.Our researchers and others have tracked how Facebook’s family of platforms have overtaken the dark web as the premier online source for the illegal drugs driving these overdoses.To get a sense of the scale of the narcotics market thriving across Facebook platforms, consider this: Facebook’s latest Transparency Report claims the company found and took action on more than 5.9 million drug sales posts from Facebook and Instagram in the third quarter of 2020. The report also claims that AI flagged 94 percent of these drug sales posts before any users reported them (although this doesn’t account for how many times these posts were viewed). Facebook’s 94 percent “success rate,” however, means that at least 354,000 confirmed drug sales were reported by users after evading Facebook’s AI systems. By comparison, when the Justice Department shut down AlphaBay in 2017, the world’s largest dark web marketplace had about 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals. And when the Justice Department seized the Silk Road servers in 2013, that dark web marketplace featured a mere 13,000 drug postings.And these numbers assume Facebook is being honest. Our research, collaborated by recent whistleblower accounts, suggests the firm exaggerates the success of their content removal efforts, so the number of drug posts could be even larger.The problem is that Facebook’s recommendation algorithms are far more efficient at spreading drug content than its moderation tools are at sniffing it out. Predictive search on Instagram, the number one online drug marketplace, suggests alternate spellings to make sure anyone showing the faintest interest in drugs can find them—even if that interest is negative. Search for #opioidaddiction, #twelvesteps or another recovery-related topic on Instagram and you will be served multiple posts with drugs for sale (even as a spokesperson touts the platform as a place where people struggling with addiction can get help).Our researchers run daily test searches, and we consistently find that the average Instagram user — i.e. someone between the ages of 13 and 29 — is less than 10 seconds and a few clicks away from being able to buy narcotics or counterfeit pills.It’s enough to make you feel anxious. Mention that sensation while chatting on Facebook platforms and you will begin to see advertisements for online pharmacies selling prescription medicines at cut-rate prices, some of which are lethal counterfeit drugs. The pandemic gave the online pharmacy market a shot in the arm, with 31 percent of Americans buying prescriptions online for the first time.According to the FDA, 97 percent of online pharmacies are fake, and illegal online pharmacies have emerged as the main source of the counterfeit medications causing the current spike in overdoses. Facebook actually sells these illegal pharmacies ad space, yet another way the firm profits off illegal activity.On Jan. 6, members of Congress experienced firsthand how illegal activity taking place on Facebook can have deadly, real-life consequences. Facebook knows its algorithms spread division, and that many of its most popular groups are cesspits of illicit activity and extremism, but this active facilitation of crime and extremism has never been properly addressed by our judicial system.Just as state attorneys general have begun to unravel how powerful tech algorithms stifle competition, it is vital to also grasp how Facebook algorithms spread and amplify serious crime, and the myriad ways the firm profits from victimizing ordinary people.The world’s biggest social media company isn’t just harming society with its monopolistic behavior. Facebook platforms are a threat to the health and human safety of the American people. It is time to hold the firm and its senior executives accountable."
lot of upgrade in the 400's and some close de 500
"I have heard it said the CIA is responsible for more than a few IT billionaires......so was, or is, FB aided by CIA or China in cataloging identities, habits, political views and facial recognition? Is this something a person should be aware of in their pursuit of a private, safe and joyous life?"
"Facebook news ban fears grow as tech giant fails to sign deals with Australia's big media playersTwo weeks after Facebook struck a deal with the Australian government to pay publishers for displaying their news content the social network has failed to sign a single big media player – sparking fears of a second news feed ban.Sources close to the negotiations say Facebook is either freezing them out or refusing to budge on key clauses, which could indicate the platform is getting cold feet and considering “pulling the plug” again.Facebook last month was globally condemned for “attempting to bully a democracy” when it stopped its 18 million Australian users from viewing or sharing news stories. But a longer crisis was averted when the government made last-minute amendments to its media code that Facebook was happy with.While Facebook has signed letters of intent with three smaller players and Seven West Media, which publishes two newspapers, it’s failed to come to an agreement with the three biggest employers of journalists: News Corp Australia, Nine Entertainment and the ABC.The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been encouraging publishers to push for a resolution."

"Further down the road, Apple will reportedly release Apple Glasses, which is expected to be lighter-weight eyewear that delivers augmented reality experiences on the go. Apple Glasses may work in tandem with an iPhone, but the earliest release date we’ve heard about would be 2023.$APPL $WIMI $FB"
Elizabeth Warren gives new meaning to stupid
"Based on merit alone, FB ought to finish the week above $180. However, we have those pesky call options owners wrote, and I know they like to see the pps end tomorrow at below that number so they can keep the premium they were paid and live to write another.As history with FB's has clearly told us, its pps rises; gets driven back down because of some new report/opinion/Cramer etc., and then, when saner heads prevail, works its way up to making new highs.We're only about 45 days into 2018. If you recall, FB didn't have a great February 2017. Yet, come year's end, there we were selling for around $175, up about 40 or so points from where we started the year.FB's 4Q 2017 was a monster quarter and I expect those revenues to be maintained. Why? Retail enjoyed its finest Christmas season in more than a decade. The jobless rate is at a thirty year low. Tax cuts mean more spending. All those and more bode well for the economy and for advertisers to start ramping up spending for the products/services in an effort to gobble up more of those additional dollars people now have to spend.Couple the above with the price targets for FB all being in the $225 range, come the end of 2018, it should surprise no one if FB enjoys another $40 increase this year. Who knows? Maybe even more?"
"congrats, we made it"
FB will recover this drop is fantastic entry the share will stabilize in matter of days and will resume its up momentum next quarterly report will show the recovery
Back to $240 for awhile i guess
Will break 185 on Monday buy buy

"This is so undervalued, just go to fundamentals, huge sales and earnings.It has the three most popular social platforms, Facebook,Instagram,Watsapp, come on, this stock should easily be over $300, and that price is cheap"
Let's start with $190 tomorrow and work our way to $210 after earnings.
"The Facebook / Zuckerberg hearings accomplished one thing... The vast majority of our Senators and Congresspeople are ill-equipped to serve in their roles. The majority simply grandstanded and accomplished little to nothing with their questioning. I thought Zuckerberg did an admirable job dealing with a very tough situation.

Apparently the data leak that shorts like to harp on has had absolutely zero impact on the FB stock. But nice try guys.
Soooo cheap still
"Bull case on this stock is a run to $100+ on fundamentals. Once $SNAP can deliver market-rate eCPMs comparable to $FB, ARPU can run to $FB levels (~$45-$50/DAU). $SNAP has not content moderation expenses and so you can conceivably get to 55-60% operating margins long-term, blowing through even peak $FB operating margins. Take a step back, take a long-term view, understand the story, and discount back to present value. I'm at ~$100+ on $SNAP fundamentals wise."
"Nothing is intrinsically wrong with FB. All systems are go and performing well. The fly in the ointment is the overall market. Inflation is looming (See article in today's WSJ) and no matter what side of the aisle you favor, no one is gonna like the new increased tax rates, especially on capital gains. Thus I believe the long rumored (Anticipated?) correction in the Dow and Nasdaq is now upon us. Nothing goes straight up forever. JMHO, but take your profits now. And at $300+ per share, I will assume most holders of FB shares do indeed have profits."
"Saying you hate Facebook is like saying you hate people, it makes no sense. Do you hate TV too or just change the channel"
YOU BETTER PRAY AMAZON IS GREAT TONIGHT. OR!
Massive massive beat vs expectations incoming
Great run... not too fast... moved slow and steady for months.. retraced a few times.. I play one side which is the long.. accumulating shares as it drops and building my wealth... :)
Sold at $325. GLTA.
Facebook past $ 300. Wow! Finally! Have held this stock since IPO
"I can see increasing to trendline 310, of it holds, 320 and then 360... Very good stock maybe a good time to load up now ;)"
Going to be 310 this week.
So many short traders are raising their White flags of surrender!*** FB ūber-Bulls will continue to romp into the weekend and beyond!!!
Perfect time to short from the ATH to the $65 it deserves. Twitter to $0! Easy money! Socialism will be defeated!
I rented 40 shares of FB the other day @ $302.50. Just sold them @ $331.70. Love that.

"Social media is the future, and regardless of many thumbs down I get for saying that, the simple is the haters are robbing themselves of a chance to get wealthy over the long haul. Wallow in your morals and hatred of these companies and remain poor, or come aboard and get rich. Anyone with common sense would do the latter. Social media has done a lot more good than bad. I own FB, TWTR, SNAP, GOOGL, etc. As an investment these companies all make perfect sense...they are futuristic, forward looking and the CEOs are geniuses. I'm watching Zuckerberg and Dorsey and the GOOGL CEO speak on TV right now. Very impressed by them. So I know I'm going to get tons of thumbs down from all these haters and nutjobs on the yahoo discussion forum but the simple is fact by not buying these companies at these prices you will only lose even more. These companies are not going to collapse the way the haters hope they will. So thumbs down at will. I've made a lot of money owning all of these and you thumbs downing this comment is not going to take any of it away. Money doesn't necessarily buy happiness but it doesn't hurt that's for sure, and it buys a lot more happiness then when you wallow in your resentments and don't have any of it."
"It’s worth $325 tomorrow, the higher numbers, 385, later in the year. But it is so undervalued right now."
Chairman Zuckermao has issued the edict. My government has spoken.
"Red day on WS, so most stocks will follow suit. Will be happy if FB can stay between $190 and $200 heading into earnings. Can't lose sight of the fact that FB makes money hand over fist. Even if some sort of regulation is proposed, it'll be years before it gets finalized. It's pretty obvious that the older geezers on Congress don't have a clue about social media, and if it's determined that regulating FB, GOOG, TWTR et al won't get them any votes, they'll drop regulation.JMHO, but if the Dems are serious about taking back the WH in 2020, when it comes to telling the voters what they've been doing for the country over the past three years, they had better have something better to say than they spent every day trying to dig up dirt on Trump in hopes of impeaching him and finding a way to regulate (Punish?) the likes of FB, GOOG and AMZN for thehorrible crime of being too successful."

"Facebook post promising free groceries is a scamROCKFORD (WREX) — We all know the old saying, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. That's the case with a Facebook post promising people free groceries from Aldi.The Facebook page, Aldi Store is not even the grocery chain's Facebook page. The legitimate page is Aldi USA.In the spoofed post, it says, ""My name is Jason Hart and I'm the CEO of Aldi Inc. To celebrate our 75th birthday, Every single person who shares and comments by 5 PM Sunday will get one of those Christmas Food Box delivered straight to their door on Monday 30th November.""The post goes on to say each food box contains $75 worth of groceries and a $25 Aldi voucher. It asks people to click on a link to validate their entry, thus fulfilling the scam.If you see this post, do not share it or click on the link. The scammers will use the link to get your personal information.It should also be noted that on Aldi's official website, it says the first store was founded in 1961, making it 59 years old.So how can you tell when something like this is a scam? The pictures look authentic, the name is familiar, and your trusted friends shared it. In the case of this post, there are a few signs that give it away as a scam.First off, the page itself. When 13 WREX clicked on it, we noticed there was only one post: This one. Aldi certainly has posted more than once on its Facebook page. Second, the grammar in the post. You will notice a few typos in it such as the word ""every"" is capitalized when it shouldn't be. And it says everyone will get one of the ""Christmas Food Box"" instead of boxes. While everyone makes mistake, the multiple grammar issues in here indicate this is not a reputable company making this post.Finally, we simply searched Aldi in Facebook to try and find the legitimate page. Aldi USA shows up instantly in the search bar, and has 2.7 million likes. Aldi Store at the time had a few hundred likes.Aldi USA posted about the scam Sunday afternoon saying:""Hey ALDI fans! Looks like another Facebook scam is making its way around. We can confirm it is a scam and the page has no affiliation with ALDI. We're sorry for any confusion this may have caused! We have been working with Facebook since yesterday to get the page taken down, but we'd love your help! Please share this post to help us spread the word and always be sure to look for the blue check mark by our name for authenticity!"""

"Data leak is worst , 500m ppl"
I just read a report by an analyst stating the new algorithm will change the number of news feeds shown per view but not advertising which is where the ad revenue comes in to play. I assume this change will have an effect on the number of fake news stories seen on FB.
"It is a no-brainer to ban the malefactor for life. Wake up, Facebook, and do what’s right for the Country; there should be no hesitation to squelch his profusion of lies and misinformation!! As a long-term major shareholder, I want him banned for life!!"

Probably a good investment - but company is a big negative for society. Allows the immediate spread of fake news by would-be tyrants.

"I currently own Facebook shares and it is a great stock to buy in my opinion, for these reasons:1. Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 25% for 20212. Low forward P/E ratio of 23, considering it continues to have double digit revenue growth3. The market for Facebook and Instagram will continue to have strong growth, in my opinion, as social media has become incredibly important to so many people. 4. Facebook’s financial statements are incredible with strong revenue growth of 21.6% in 2020 even when it was in a worst-case scenario with lockdowns and reduced advertising budgets. The family daily active people was up 15% year-over-year to 2.6 billion in Q4 2020 and family monthly active people was up 14% to 3.3 billion. The family average revenue per person also increased 16.8% to $8.62 in Q4 2020. 5. The company is highly profitable and has an incredible balance sheet with $61.9 billion of cash and marketable securities at December 2020.6. Facebook has around 10,000 employees working on virtual reality and augmented reality which may be massive markets in the future and Facebook is looking to capitalize with VR headset Oculus and Facebook’s smart glasses.The risks with Facebook include the privacy changes to Apple’s iOS and the risk the government may try to break up the company which I believe is unlikely to happen.

Incumbent on the FB management team to make a concerted effort to communicate positive stories from the business, which they started at the last earnings conference call, and to continue to promote that growth narrative on an ongoing basis - take an offensive posture instead of a defensive one. The market, which suffers from short-term memory loss, needs constant reminders of FB’s growth prospects to drive the share price higher."
What a great comeback this week! Have a nice weekend everybody!
"Facebook and Instagram use iOS notices to pressure users on surveillance activities Facebook has been determined to pressuring users to accept surveillance activities before Apple made it optional with iOS 14.5, and it's now using pressure tactics to encourage adoption. Technologist Ashkan Soltani and The Verge have found that Facebook and Instagram are displaying notices to iOS users that pitch the user tracking concept. The option not only shows more personalized ads, Facebook says, but supports businesses and helps keep the apps ""free of charge."" Disable user tracking and you might have to pay someday, the social network implied.The company detailed the notices in an updated blog post in late April, but the ""educational screens"" (as Facebook described them) didn't garner much attention until now.It's not surprising that Facebook would try the hard sell for tracking. User tracking and data collection play a major role in Facebook's business, and using iOS 14.5 to effectively disable them could hurt the internet giant's bottom line. The notices could be worthwhile for the company if they lead to at least some customers allowing tracking. At the same time, they're reminders that Facebook's business revolves around surveillance and data collection — you might balk if you're privacy-conscious."
"Clubhouse, here FB comes to challenge. It is the best tools for the Asian-Pacific merchants to do the business. It looks like FB will do damage to Clubhouse like it does to Snap."

"What I don’t understand is why people waste their time bad mouthing this stock? Why waste the energy? Only leads us to believe that you have a short interest. But why bother shorting this? It has just chugged along for a decade and is a cash cow with huge profit margins. Ethics or not, FB rakes in the dough."
"That’s about 2 years worth of gains that have evaporated. That’s assuming no one here was adding at 210, 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, 150, 140, 130. Just wow. Losses must be mounting for those people."
"Facebook Let Fake Accounts Inflate BJP MP’s Popularity In India, Says Former EmployeeWith a reputation for profiting from amplifying fake news, Facebook has once again been accused of being hand in glove with ministers from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A recent report from The Guardian has found that Facebook allowed a network of fake accounts to artificially inflate the popularity of a BJP Member of Parliament (MP). The company was asked to remove these fake accounts but stopped when it realised that the politician was directly involved in the network. The revelations have come from Sophie Zhang, a former data scientist at Facebook, who in September last year wrote a 6,600-word internal memo, detailing examples of how the company knew of political leaders from around the world, including India, who were using the platform to manipulate voters, but failed to act. According to the report, in December 2019, Zhang detected four sophisticated networks of suspicious accounts that were producing fake engagement such as likes, comments and shares, on the post of political leaders affiliated with both the BJP and the Indian National Congress, India’s principal opposition party. After recognising that a cluster of these suspicious accounts included the account of the BJP MP, the Facebook staffer responsible for taking down those accounts paused. Subsequently, despite Zhang seeking approval to ‘checkpoint’ the account — where it is locked unless the owner can provide proof of their identity — the situation was characterised as one of low priority and approvals weren’t granted. In August last year, a The Wall Street Journal report had alleged that Facebook had failed to apply its rules for hate speech violations to politicians and MPs affiliated with the BJP, which rules at the centre. Two months after the publication of that report, Facebook’s then public policy head Ankhi Das, who was named several times in the WSJ report, resigned from her position."

"FB is gpong down to hell. The whole world after Australia is going after, England all ready is standing by Australia."
"Facebook is, and has always been, a lightning rod for issues outside of its control. Many on this board are viewing the removal of the president's facebook as a violation of the rights granted by the First Amendment and speculate that facebook silences conservative viewpoints that in turn infringes on their rights to freedom of speech. However, this is not a First Amendment issue. Facebook, being a private entity, can censor, remove or suspend any speech that violates their terms and conditions, as agreed to by the user in their ""terms of service"". The first amendment clearly states, ""CONGRESS shall make no law that ... [limits] the freedom of speech"". The government has no power over facebook... nor OAN, nor Fox, nor Newsmax and cannot legally stop the spread of potentially false information. Those individual corporations are proof that the First Amendment is alive and strong. To suggest the removal of the president's accounts from Facebook to Twitter, and all platforms inbetween is somehow a ploy from the left in silencing free speech and the beginning of ""socialism"" or ""communism"" is pure folly as evidenced by the fact that some media outlets have exercised their freedom of speech and insinuated as such. Sorry for the rant. Just exercising my First Amendment right ;). P.S. Long facebook because of their balance sheet and market opportunities in AI."
"Facebook is corrupt; and always HAS BEEN corrupt to everyday average people. Facebook has sold so much information about everybody who joined them, it's not even funny. But most do not care. They simply say that the price you pay. Short the #$%$ out of this criminal company. It's not even a question of whether it's the right move or not."
FB is the king in town! We like this steadily beautifully strong chart!
End of fb
"FB just about peaked in 2020, old people are ones still using FB and hey are dying fast with covid, FB is toast, move on over to green economy & crypto , politicians waged bets there and they are the ones that will write the checks"
This one's going to get broken up pretty soon. It's inevitable. FB TWTR etc. are basically like telephones were 30 years ago. These social media companies are going to end up as utilities.
"The fat cats will probably hold down FB today in an effort to kill off today's 180 call options. All bets are off come Monday which is when I expect the pps to finally start showing some appreciation for the blowout Q3 earnings. Also, don't forget, Q4 is historically FB's best quarter for revenue. I read that mobile is accounting for 70% of ad dollars. Yep, all those ad dollars that were once the exclusive purview of radio, TV, mags and newspapers have found their way into FB's coffers. To wit, have you noticed how ""thin"" your daily local newspaper has gotten? Do you ever remember TV showing so many ads for gold, silver, lawyers and other non-traditional topics? Of course not, and it's because their ad rates have dropped so much the aforesaid group can now afford them. Now, even the smallest local mom and pop biz can afford to advertise on radio as stations drop ad rates like TV.FB? I'm long and strong."
More manipulation than a Chicago election!
"People still complaining about FB while S/P keeps going up, love it"
Mix business with political is big mistake. FB and TWTR are against freedom of speech and American people.
"Yahoo FinanceHow the world’s biggest tech companies are working to prevent free speech.In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, tech companies ranging from Facebook and Twitter to Google have moved to stop the spread of free speech content on their platforms. With the presidential inauguration set for Jan. 20, those sites, as well as others including Shopify and Etsy, have moved to address similar content on their platforms related to the day’s event."

"Stock splits are historically implemented by companies that want to improve the marketability of their shares, which can potentially enhance shareholder value resulting from an increase in demand for the shares. Apple, which went public in 1980, has split its shares FIVE times since then; Google has split its shares TWICE since its shares went public in 2004. These moves by both companies have proven to be extremely financially beneficial to shareholders. Facebook, in contrast, has refused to offer a share split because that action would not be advantageous to Mark Zuckerberg, even though shareholders could greatly benefit from a split. The share split should have happened a while ago but it seems highly unlikely to happen, as shareholder interests are secondary to the company’s management team. To better promote the interests of shareholders, I am asking other shareholders to join me in demanding the resignations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. A management team change is long overdue, and it’s critical we push for the installation of a new team to better represent shareholder interests. Zuckerberg and Sandberg MUST GO!"
"This morning I was hoping FB would hold $250.00. Looked good for a while, especially after it turned green around mid-morning. But, alas, it was not to be. Instead, now hoping FB can hold $240by Friday's close. Friday's are always a tad goofy, so have no idea what to expect. But the self-inflicted negative cloud hanging over FB ain't gonna go away on its own. Plus, Zuck doesn't look like he's about to rescind his censorship ban anytime soon. Big mistake on his part IMHO."

"The actions of social media companies like Twitter and Facebook are not just national brands, they are global. Their actions over the last several months have shown how manipulative they are in regards to freedom of expression, and personal views if they do not ""conform"" to their Socialist ideals. Glad to see them both heading South."
"Although many may not realize it, FB should probably classify, at least to some degree, as a ""reopening"" stock. Because it's a social media platform, this spring and summer will likely yield more people going out, taking photos and videos, meeting up with friends/family, travel and leisure companies increasing their adspend etc. In my opinion, this stock should do pretty heading into the spring and may even exceed expectations. Of course, do your own research and assess your risk tolerance before investing."
Someone needs to tell Zuck that apple provides and product and service people need. While FB is a product no one needs and fewer and fewer people want.
Only 30 shares. Glad I didn't panic sell as FB is just a cash machine.

"Whether or not Facebook is good for society is certainly debatable, but one thing isn't: Facebook is an outstanding business, and the stock has been nothing but a winner since its 2012 IPO. Despite the controversy and even a Democratic takeover of Congressional leadership and the presidency, the stock still looks poised for a strong 2021. Advertisement , The company was handed a $5 billion fine by the FTC in 2019, but the stock barely flinched. The ""worst-case"" scenario of a company breakup seems unlikely, and even if it came to pass, the business could be more valuable with Instagram as a stand-alone entity, No one knows what will happen to the market this year, and the bubble could expand, favoring stocks that have already seen a sudden rise, but there's no doubt Facebook will be standing strong whenever the bubble pops. It has $55 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt; it generates mountains of profits that underpin its valuation, and its user and advertiser bases have proven to be sticky over the years."

Dumped RatBook and Twitter Today after 11 years.. Feels awesome.
When Fb trying to link Whatsup as they not generating any money stocks falls I never understand the logic. It should be good for fb stock in long term. But yes privacy issue antitrust #$%$ is all are part of this but how it affect fb stock negatively? I?m buying more aggressively than anything else in the market.

"I find it interesting that the stock is down because someone said that the ban could result in a 10% loss of business. Not to get political and bash anyone but I don't think the current president is that important and that much of an interest in my everyday life. Some of the things he says and does is comical and good entertainment but its making a mountain out of a molehill. At the end of the day, facebook sells lots of ads for those of us who socialize on their sites. And doesn't facebook own instagram too and they blew it out of the water last quarter. I bought at today's low and don't think it will trade at this price again anytime soon. Their earnings are coming out in a couple of weeks. Am I missing something or just a lot of political bashing one way or other here?"
"I am hanging in their because it is still growing at 20%. Apple is anti-competitive with pre installing iMessage which only works on Apple devices.

"So someone with power can insight riot on any social megaphone and it is ok if you voted for them, but the media that they can no longer use is suppose to be free to use any way? I think there is a demand for stock as IRA money flood during tax time, and funds leaving bond funds, and buying stocks that create a demand for that stock. Facebook stock. The same stock today, that you drive the price down, will be double by the end of the year because of the solid balance sheet and tons of cash. Hell, FB might even be buying back their shares."
Facebook just deleted the #walkaway page. They are at war with anyone who doesn’t think the way Facebook wants. That’s the very definition of fascism. Please delete your Facebook pages. I’m complaining to my ISP to block them.

"YOU ARE STILL SUPPORTING FACEBOOK if you haven't Deleted (not deactivated) all facebook apps, including - but not limited to - facebook, fb messenger, instagram, whatsapp, oculus, etc.. What you do is your perogative, and most would go through withdraw if they left these platforms. But if you want to hurt facebook, do not buy any shares, and let the shorts run this to the ground!! It's not the action of short selling that hurts a stock, it's more short sellers than buyers that can drive a nail through it's socialist black heart! Besides, there are much better companies to invest in. This stock is garbage and will drop overnight in the next few months because of censorship!! Don't buy!! You'll be throwing your money away!! The more people that abandon facebook, the least likely smart money (hedgefunds, investment institutions, etc) and advertising agents will invest. Food for thought."
FB could break higher at the closing bell!- Selling programs are over and bulls are stepping up to buy at this bargain bin price.- This is free money if you have ability to look to FB's earnings and beyond!
"I’m so happy to see the fight between $AAPL and $FB. I hope they run each other into the ground. BTW, when is Tim going to delete the Facebook app from the App Store? Or is he all talk?"

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-may-vastly-overpaid-data-022704042.htmlWhen the $5 billion settlement penalty for privacy violations was announced in 2019,I thought it was an outrageous amount. The attached article discusses how the fee was significantly higher than the maximum amount recommended for the violation of privacy issues detailed. The big question posed by a study done by a law firm for shareholders is this: why did Facebook pay a penalty almost $4.9 billion higher than recommended? Was the settlement agreement forged to prevent the release of sensitive information that incriminated Zuckerberg?? It’s very possible that shareholders lost $4.9 billion in profitability in 2019 to protect Zuckerberg."

"Maryland becomes the first state to tax on digital ads from Facebook, GoogleMaryland has approved the country's first tax on the revenue brought in from digital advertisements placed by companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.On Friday, the State Senate voted to override the governor's veto of the measure following a similar vote from the House of Delegates, The New York Times reports. The measure is expected to generate as much as $250 million in its first year.The Maryland tax specifically applies to digital ads that are displayed within the state. It's also levied based on the ad sales that a company generates. Companies that make at least $100 million to $1 billion a year will be taxed at a 2.5% rate. Companies that make more than $15 billion — which includes Facebook and google — will face a 10% tax on digital ad revenue.Legislators in Connecticut and Indiana have already introduced similar measures to tax social media giants.The tax legislation is just part of a growing debate about the dominance and power of technology giants. In the U.S., companies like Facebook and Google are facing multiple antitrust lawsuits. Antitrust legislation introduced at the federal level could target those companies. The measures in the U.S. also follow in the footsteps of governments in Europe, which have introduced both new restrictions targeting Facebook and Google."
"Facebook overpaid in data privacy settlement to protect Zuckerberg (Reuters) - Facebook Inc may have paid $4.9 billion more than the maximum penalty it faced under a settlement agreement with regulators related to allegations it mishandled user privacy, according to a Wednesday court ruling.The information made public by a Delaware judge who gleaned it from a ""white paper"" prepared by a law firm advising Facebook's board of directors as they debated a proposed $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also protected Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery cited the paper by Gibson Dunn attorneys in his ruling directing Facebook to turn over documents to shareholders who are trying to determine if Facebook overpaid to protect Zuckerberg.""The documents already produced provide no insight into why Facebook would pay more than its (apparently) maximum exposure to settle a claim,"" said Slights in the ruling. Shareholders, he said, were ""right to question whether internal communications among Facebook fiduciaries might shed light on the Board’s thinking in this regard.""Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The July 2019 deal resolved allegations Facebook mishandled user privacy. The company did not admit wrongdoing.Slights said Facebook faced a maximum penalty of about $104 million, according to the Gibson Dunn paper.The FTC did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Joel Fleming, an attorney for the Facebook shareholders, told Slights during a hearing last year that before they sue over the FTC settlement they wanted to know: ""Did anyone say, 'Go ask the FTC, would you take less money if Mr. Zuckerberg is personally liable'?""Slights refused to order the company to turn over documents that Facebook said were protected by attorney-client privilege, in part because the judge said shareholders could gain insights from non-privileged electronic communications he was ordering to be disclosed."

So I thought it was looking like 245 was a real possibility (removing the emotion out of it and how irrational/stupid that is).We have three black crows (a bearish reversal pattern consisting of three consecutive long red candlestick bodies where each body closes at or near its low of the previous day).Looks like a bearish reversal.But if you look at MACD and CMF it suggests the buying pressure is ramping up.About 3 hours before close the RSI found support at its level when the SP was @ 245.MACD turned green and we saw a bullish crossover.CMF also picking up big.I would guess we see a recovery next week.Either way I dont think this will break the support at 245.Would buy big if it drops at open as downside seems limited.

This is such a no brainer to 325s this year. Facebook has doubled digit earnings growth and value compared to peer group. They are the best advertising company on line. I used them and they 3x my biz this year alone with a budget of 25k. Paid it self over and over. the trade desk is the only other comp I think that is as well run. TTD but I wait for 500.

No one likes being bullied into an opinion but I think this mass attempt to silence opposing thought was the wake up call many conservatives have long needed."
I contacted my mutual fund today and asked them if they would consider dropping Facebook from the portfolio. Facebook are an Un American company and have more in common with third world countries with their stomping on free speech.

It’s time to short FB and Twitter. These stocks are now unownable. The are toxic to the country and your wallet

So, will that old Wall Street axiom: ""Buy the Rumor, Sell the News."" come into play tomorrow afternoon? Agree with the prognosticators about Q4 2020 earnings being very good. Just hoping Zuck and the CFO allow the numbers to speak for themselves and not be Debbie Downers during the conference call."
In the last hour there will be a buying spree. Get your bets in.

Public SEC fillings show insiders all dumping large amounts of shares every month of FB and not buying. Never a good indicator when the founders are all liquidating their fortunes as fast as legally possible.￼

Lol I just bought at the opening under 262.Bargain. But it sucks to see this money making machine this red when everything else is flying.CAT passed 190 with a gain of +7% and now their pe ratio is higher than FB even though their earnings are down 50% and their revenue is down 22% while FB rev goes up +20% a yr and earnings +25% a year.It's a joke.But everything corrects itself so I'm just accumulating and I just sold Cat 10 mins ago.

Nice job FB! way to shut down one-term Donny! RPOS
"After looking into detail policy changes, just want to share this with you all:Short version: your personal conversations remain personal and encrypted. WhatsApp’s data sharing hasn’t really changed, its security hasn’t changed, it remains the largest end-to-end encrypted platform available.Long version:Keeping aside any jokes on what valuable or secret data you are really trying to protect...1. WhatsApp is still end to end encrypted, which means that ALL your chat threads (group or 1:1) as well as your voice/video calls are entirely secure and only available to you and the people you are talking to. Yes, that includes all your naughty content too.2. Your contact list on the phone that you use for looking up contacts and sending messages to/calling people, is not shared with anyone, including Facebook.3. The only time you have to worry about your data “leaking” is when you backup your WhatsApp messages to iCloud (if you are on iPhone) or equivalent Android backup service. To be able to restore that data on a new device, the backup file is not encrypted. So please protect your iCloud backups well.4. So what are the real changes? *In future* IF and WHEN you start using WhatsApp to send messages to businesses or do payment transactions, the shopping data can be shared with merchants and Facebook to improve their services (example making your Ads more personalized for you). When in future will this happen? Your guess is as good as mine...5. If nothing really has changed, why all this noise? Or a more candid version of this - why can’t WhatsApp explain this in simple language? WhatsApp over-communicates and proactively shares even the slightest change that might impact its extremely high standards on privacy to run an end to end encrypted private messaging service for 2 Billion people. Good learning for us that technically nuanced and accurate messaging doesn’t work at 2B people scale.6. Can you give feedback to the WhatsApp team about this? Absolutely. See a more detailed response from the head of WhatsApp: https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660768225841152…7. Do I need to pay for a private/secure version of WhatsApp? Heck no. Please don’t fall for any such scams. There is only one secure, private version of WhatsApp and that is FREE for all the 2 billion people who use it. And yes, feel free to forward this to your friends and family."
Fb won’t got to 300 till prolly next week
.......I was in FB two years ago and it made money for the Shareholders and I was quite happy with it.....But since then it almost got to $300.00 then pulls back......How can you stand this if you are long FB?.....You don’t even get a dividend for Waiting.......Conclusions BUY.......XOM NOW and make .87 for every share and your investment could Double by the end of the year.......just saying......
With the new earnings this stock is a way undervalued compare with current market valuation! We just need green day and FB catch up it’s valuation!

"Corrupt insiders are shearing up their positions, be careful."
"Facebook to pay record $5 billion U.S. fine over privacy violations WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) will pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices and the social media giant will restructure its approach to privacy, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to adopt the settlement, which requires court approval, even as Democrats said the settlement did not go far enough or require a large enough fine.“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how personal information is shared Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons, a Republican, in a statement.But Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said the penalty provided “blanket immunity” for Facebook executives “and no real restraints on Facebook’s business model” and does “not fix the core problems that led to these violations.”Facebook declined to comment ahead of the settlement’s public release.The FTC said that Facebook’s data policy was deceptive to “tens of millions” of people who used Facebook’s facial recognition tool and also violated its rules against deceptive practices when it did not disclose phone numbers collected to enable a security feature would be used for advertising.Under the settlement, Facebook’s board will create an independent privacy committee that removes “unfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.”Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ftc/facebook-to-pay-record-5-billion-u-s-fine-over-privacy-violations-but-critics-call-it-a-bargain-idUSKCN1UJ1L9"
I pulled out profits @$286. Didn't expect to see that come around this morning. Hope to get back in at a better entry point
How many people actually think FB could sustain 300+ if they continue to get fined for violating laws and data mining. Without instagram this would be a company in decline yes or yes. Insta is worse now to but all they care about is making it a cash cow which is backfiring bc there losing users.

I still think Zuckerberg already knows Facebook will be reporting a record quarter for revenues and profits on January 31, which is WHY Zuckerberg chose to report about the FB crack down on fake news feeds now.

"Mark...come to your senses, you are generating tremendous amounts of bad will. The optics are not good for you here. News agencies employees need to eat too, you are capturing all the ad revenue generated by all the shares and likes of news articles. That content makes your platform a better value proposition, and you need to come to a compromise and allow some ad sharing revenue. You frankly are being greedy and hiding behind your facebook users. Google has already come to a compromise. The news article generates views, likes,shares, increases advertising dollars spent, etc and you should treat the news agencies that are part of this virtuous cycle by compensating them as your company is compensated. You are tempting to incur the wrath of the global community and nations over this payment dispute."
Nothing you can do. Like I’ve told everyone...when you aren’t making hay on green markets....look what happens on red markets.

However, the privacy policy change by Apple could cripple facebook. I'm exiting early before the bloodshed.

I much prefer ads for thing I'm shopping for currently and I actively click on Facebook ads and engage with them. (I want more curation in my life.. not less)."
Lol FB -.- not going anywhere no up no down.
When FB sees that Google has installed revolutionary View Smart Glass(CFii) on it’s new 1.3 million sq foot New York City headquarters building they most likely follow.I expect all top tier office buildings will compelled to follow to stay competitive.
Hello $300 in the next few days :)
FB got zucked!
I'm excited for monday.. I have a feeling it is going to be a good day.Please press the like:
"Major bargain hunting time in Big-Tech and FB stock before huge Q4 earnings release!***And, AND investors celebrate the departure of the old Administration who was no friend to America’s job creating machinery of Big Tech Giants!"
woohoo seeing lots of green everyone is buying
Next stop $115 down
"Instagram crosses 1 billion monthly active users, unveils long-form videohttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/20/instagram-is-taking-on-youtube-with-long-form-video.htmlInstagram is the new KING: 1 Billion monthly active users, and introducing new long-form videos(60 minute capacity) on a new video hub, IGTV. Awesome news to drive the share price to new heights."
FB is whipping post for something EVERY social media outlet is doing. NONSENSE!!
Mark Zuckerberg is unethical as are several of these tech companies that utilize user’s information to direct ads. Jack Dorsey is another example of an unethical CEO. FB will lose any battle with Apple. Ethical vs unethical. The battle has began. Let’s Rumble!
"The winning play in FB stock is to go long, stay strong, buy the “inflection dips” — ignore the noise — and just keep on. Keeping on!*** It’s been the winning play since FB IPO’d.- There is nothing wrong with FB’s juggernaut business, performance that would indicates weakness!"
Hopefully everyone does sell. This is a behemoth of a company. There's no debt and they're doing well in the vr.
That $40 billion they had will probably be half of that next earnings.
To be honest when i see ads related to my searches it creeps me out. I dont like it at all so if there is an option i will say not to share my info all the time
WOW - BREAKING NOW THE LOWER BAR....Sell as I told you. Boolean
"After breaking $249,02 imho we can see next stop $230,12 ! GLTA"

Facebook should be ashamed of themselves. I am never using what’s app again

"there's a time for making money and a time for taking a stand. 24 hours silence on FB on protest of selective censorship.

When will the government allow the people to borrow money at real negative rates. If you could get a 30 year mortgage at 2% or borrow for a new car or anything else for that matter the economy would go parabolic.
"No Guidance, Great Earnings, but future doesnt look good -$20 AH I'm out"

"This will be $280 in 2 weeks, it can do it in one day but you know how the algorithms works"
Take this scrumbag back to $50 ya.
I love how the LONGS say I’mStill holding when their own CEO cashed out tons of his shares. Zuckerberg is laughing at you.
If I had cash I'd be buying a boatload of FB. The stock is so undervalued right now its a screaming buy. There is a ton of noise right now in the FB universe affecting the share price but if you are thinking long term; 5-years from now the stock will be up significantly. Buy when people are beating down a great company. Sell when people are euphoric about a great company.
If zuck only allowed free speech and stoppes his fake fact checking this stock would be 600 .
"Imo going under $250, downward pressure just too strong!"

Facebook's latest push is to legitimize highly speculative climate change theory by suppressing those who utter facts and hard science that don't support the fad.
"FB will go UP very soon and the revenues this year will be unprecedented. Here is why: First of all, the outrage regarding the changes to wassap privacy policy are just noise. The people will “click” accept like they do with ‘cookies’ and EVERY other privacy policy. Yes, there are other social networks and messaging apps, but the FB ecosystem is the most profitable trifecta since GOOG. For instance, there are other alternatives to Google search and YouTube, nevertheless, go ahead and try to find something on Bing or use DailyMotion to reach more customers.It isn't worth it. And why is that? Because like GOOG, FB knows their users very very well and they know what to do to still be relevant, but more importantly, profitable. The amount of information that FB have on their users and the unparalleled amount that they will gather now with the changes to wassap PP, will create the worlds biggest reserve of the most valuable asset: Data."
THANK YOU TO FB!! I MAKE MY FIRST MILLION!! I couldn't have done if not for USA!! Thank you Mr. Zuckleberg!! We did buy the new car!!
Which Amendment to the Constitution does FB despise today?
I personally think the police forces and government should be THANKING facebook and big tech for making their jobs easy. Irrefutable archived video evidence of all the malfeasances. No one would have been arrested had the evidence not been posted on social media? am I wrong?

"It’s time for Facebook employees to step up and exert pressure internally for a change in management.

It is a 300$ stock!
I will be holding FB and buying more all the way to January 27th earnings putting it over $300.
Glad I loaded the boat yesterday at 254. It’s still a steal at this price long term and by year end.

Facebook is like
People Instagram is the future! Watch for guidance during the earnings call to focus on Insta user growth & future prospects rather than FB. FB is important but Instagram is where sub-30 year olds go to meet...with more users on Insta than Snapchat and a proven ad model- FB as a co. will absolutely destroy earnings. Watch for a Neftflix like move after earnings announced.

People without jobs that have time to go to rallies and break the law by attacking the capital, may not have that much disposable cash, I am just guessing here. I didnt see alot of 18 to 40 year olds out there, those are the advertisers target. FB has a few Billion on it, and they are not just in the US. I dont think Zuck is too worried today. They didnt cut off conservatives they cut off people who are inciting violence."

"Facebook predicts 'significant' obstacles to ad targeting and revenue in 2021In the ""CFO outlook"" section of the earnings release, Facebook said it anticipates facing ""more significant advertising headwinds"" this year.""This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,"" the company wrote. ""While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning late in the first quarter.""Facebook has already been waging a bit of a campaign against Apple's upcoming privacy changes, which will require app developers to ask users for permission in order to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting — although the PR focus has been the impact on small businesses, not Facebook.Facebook also highlighted two broad economic trends that it says has benefited from during the pandemic: The ""ongoing shift towards online commerce"" and ""the shift in consumer demand towards products and away from services."" But again, it took a cautious stance, writing that ""a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth."""
The users control the fate of Facebook and Twitter
Is strange that with such great quarter there is selling pressure. There is something larger going on. Maybe people want out of the stock market or manipulation.

Honestly speaking, I stopped using all of social media a long time ago, and I am glad I was right to do so. Number of users are going to significantly decrease in my opinion."

"How many shareholders love the unpredictable and volatile nature of Facebook stock? NO ONE does! Stock price instability and price volatility are a reflection of uncertainty; uncertainty is indicative of a poor communications strategy; a poor communications strategy is a function of a combination of inept management, arrogance, and deficient leadership skills.

"Isn’t it IRONIC  Foreign countries are now starting to CANCEL Twitter  This is what the LOSERS ON THE LEFT didn’t understand! They never understand. They opened up a new can of worms. Of course, when we play by the same rules they play by they CRY LIKE BABIES  Riots all summer long ENCOURAGED BY THE DEMS. That was ok but when some on the right fight back look how they CRY FOUL  Time to CANCEL THE LEFT!$FB $SNAP $AAPL $AMZN"

"Nice Move Zuck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Facebook to allow users view into Internet-wide trackingMay 1, 2018 12:03 PM ET|About: Facebook (FB)|By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor In the latest word on privacy tools/enhancements from Facebook (FB -0.6%), the company says it's building a ""Clear History"" feature that will give users a view into what sites are tracking them across the Web along with the power to manage that information.The new feature ""will enable you to see the websites and apps that send us information when you use them, delete this information from your account, and turn off our ability to store it associated with your account going forward,"" Facebook says in a newsroom post.That commonly covers the ""Like"" button that heavily promulgated across the Web.The company will still provide those apps and sites with aggregated analytics, and says it can do that without storing the information in a way that could be associated with a particular account.Facebook's F8 developer conference is set to get under way in less than an hour."
"Let the campaign begin! He's not going away, folks! Watch the Dems implode from within their own party!! LMAO!!"
This company seemingly can't get on the right track and constantly has setbacks. What is management doing? This stock should be $400+ right now but they just can't get it together. Perhaps a change in management is needed.
Anyone else feel like we will never ever see FB at 244 again. Wish I.would have loaded up.I think Jeremy is right about this one . Will eventually the biggest company on earth

"When The Donald really won 48 of the 50 states, it's not hard to believe that most of these libtard companies will go under. Google, FBook, Twitter, Amazon are so desperate now, they are throwing out all stops. Why ON EARTH do you think they cut him and many off? It is because our own and old government owns these companies. Do your research instead of waiting for Cnn to fill your lap with garbage. Bezos has CIA ties, Bill Gates, Zuckerburg were all PUT into these executive/ownership positions years ago. When these big techs were bought out from the original owners, they were bought out by govt/banker/controller's printed money. You think Bezos was a billionaire? muwhahahahaha.

I think we all know the earnings will be huge. What we don’t know for sure is how the market will react. There may be a planned selloff to shake out weak hands and then huge buying later even with huge numbers reported. I’ve seen that happen plenty often. Hopefully we see +$45 tomorrow morning.

"FORBES - Thereafter, revenues are expected to grow further to $96.8 billion in 2021. In addition, the EPS figure will likely improve to $10.08, which coupled with the P/E multiple of around 32x will lead to Facebook’s valuation around $321, about 25% upside compared to the current market price."

Since Facebook is so fond of CommunismI think we should split their company price up and divide it equally through the shareholders
Wow. Getting beat up like the red headed step child.

This is a money making machine
This is a big issue here in Europe: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/whatsapp-facebook-app-privacy-policy. FB paid 19B for Whatsapp but with the current integration to facebook a LOT of users will leave Whatsapp because they don't want to send all that data to FB and dont'want to use a FB account. Even goverments like Netherlands Turkiye are going to leave Whatsapp for other chat applications like signal. This was going to happen: Too bad destroyed whatsapp. No way they are going to make money of that.

"I hadn't used Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram in a long time. I only went on Twitter and Instagram to see the President's pages so deleting those accounts was no big deal to me. If Democrat big tech nerds don't want me on their sites, fine. But the thing that upset me was Parler. I love Parler and Jeff Bozo is EVIL for taking it away. All the 12 million people on there are not criminals. Taking away something for no good reason is RIDICULOUS. Their reasons for taking away things from conservatives are #$%$ Nobody on Parler was planning events or riots or anything. Twitter and Facebook can't say the same, so they need to censor themselves and delete their platforms entirely like they did Parler. COMMUNICATION is important for many reasons, but also it is just HEALTHY for isolated people and elderly people and others to have a way to communicate with other human beings. All the violent and perverted stuff Twitter and FB has and they claim conservatives are the problem? This is going to come back and bite Democrats in the behind."
Forget about Australia.The IOS 14 privacy feature is going to kill their profits.Today for a known paying iOS user install in the US you pay 15 to 40 USD.After the update they will not be able to sell ads in such prices.IMHO their profit is going to drop by a lot.How come that investors don't see that?Anyone?
Congress said repeatably how important Facebook is to us and the world. Articles saying this will make FB even better.
Been in the Markets a long time. I feel like we're going through the Obama Years again.

"Hey longs I’ve been long since 15. I’m not always happy with Facebook but am a believer. It’s gonna be rocky but this company is a cash machine, has a bulletproof balance sheet, and 5 billion eyeballs on their properties every month. People love to whine about Facebook but in Australia as soon as they exercise their right to fight the Aussie government all sorts of groups are whining they don’t have their Facebook. That should tell you something. This stock isn’t going the way of MySpace or any other defunct business. If you are an investor stay the course. If you’re a trader more power to you. I’m an investor. Long for the next 10 years have a nice day."

I sold FB a few months back and they have run up and back as usual. Zuck is a George Soros type.
Facebook is losing millions of freedom loving people to free speech sites. Their ad revenue will go down. They will not have as much personal information to sell. I hope Mark Suckerberg loses a lot of money over time. I hope Facebook gets Myspaced.
So you are telling me that apple is going to grow 1.5x faster than facebook? Interesting

Free enterprise has the right to refuse service to people who break their rules.I understand you're angry. You will probably call me names. I wish you all peace. I have chosen to invest in FB at this low price. They have a 32% profit margin. It's a very successful business."

"As it seems to be the norm, there's always someone taking a shot at FB. FB reminds me of that Timex commercial of old: ""It takes a licking but keeps on ticking!""I'm more enthused by the comments made by the charters and the disciples of the ""S Curve"" theory. Both strategists opined that FB is positioned for a breakout from its current levels.Nervous Nellies are always looking for a reason to sell, however investors who pay more attention to the numbers and market potential, vis-a-vis monetizing Messenger and WhatsApp, have their eyes focused on the truer picture. And let's not forget Instagram. It is still in its infancy in terms of monetization.So if you disregard the comments of the petty snipers, many of whom appear on TV to spin their theory and are rarely heard from again because they were wrong, you'll remain long and strong.$200 per share. Not an ""if"" but rather a ""when""."
When is 300$?
I think this will be a good deal if we just give it time. People are angry and The stock if falling. I will wait until we see it turning and Then #$%$ it up for cheap and wait for the userbase return

"Last I checked, I still haven't seen any official results of an investigation into voter fraud of the most recent election. Therefore, when a sitting president alleges fraud, it is not a ""lie"". Ironically, the real ""lie"" is that a sitting president's allegations are being called a ""lie"". Leave it to liberals to call anything they disagree with a ""lie"". And to be clear, the counting of ballots isn't where the fraud occurs. It's the fraudulently cast ballots that get counted that are the problem. It would take many months or years of investigation to determine whether there is a fraud extensive enough to have affected the election outcome, but it is, well beyond any reasonable doubt, a true possibility."

"Klobuchar unveils sweeping antitrust bill, laying out her vision as new subcommittee chair • Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill on Thursday. • The bill sets a tough tone to start her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. • If enacted, the proposals could draw even more risk and scrutiny to large firms including Facebook and Google.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill on Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.Klobuchar has been a frequent critic of what she and other lawmakers have viewed as lax enforcement of existing antitrust laws and has called for strong measures against some of the major tech firms. While she’s introduced several bills in the past seeking reforms to various aspects of antitrust law, the “Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act” is a comprehensive proposal calling for a major revamp of enforcement standards. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company.With this bill, Klobuchar is drawing her line in the sand on antitrust reform, signaling that she will use her post to call for major changes to the status quo. Broadly, the bill seeks to reform antitrust law in three main ways: 1) resetting the standard for enforcement and shifting the burden of proof onto dominant firms in merger cases; 2) requiring agencies to study markets and merger effects regularly, with the help of additional funds; and 3) giving new tools to antitrust enforcers, like imposing civil penalties.In the House, antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms throughout an investigation into Facebook and Google. That investigation culminated last year in a nearly 450-page report on the companies’ alleged monopoly power and suggested reforms to restore competition to the digital market."

"3.Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter were down in the East African nation on Tuesday, after the communications regulator ordered a social media shutdown.In a letter seen by AFP, Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) executive director Irene Sewankambo ordered telecommunications companies to ""immediately suspend any access and use"" of social media and online messaging platforms.."
"Hackers can easily look up your phone number from Facebook using cheap botA database of phone numbers belonging to Facebook users is being sold on a cybercriminal forum, with customers looking up numbers using a Telegram bot.One person advertising the phone numbers says it contains data on nearly 500 million users, although the information is several years old.In 2019, a security researcher found 419 million records on an unsecured server, meaning no password was needed to access them.A total of 18 million were from users in the UK, while around 133 million were from American accounts.When the bot – which uses the messaging service Telegram, which recently saw an influx of users - is launched, it says: ""The bot helps to find out the cellular phone numbers of Facebook users”, according to Motherboard.Users can enter a phone number to receive a user’s Facebook identification, for profiles in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and 15 other countries. This also works in reverse – a Facebook ID can be used to harvest a users’ phone number.While the initial results from the bot are hidden, users can pay to reveal the full phone number. It costs $20 per phone number unlocked, with prices reaching $5,000 for 10,000 numbers.""It is very worrying to see a database of that size being sold in cybercrime communities, it harms our privacy severely and will certainly be used for smishing and other fraudulent activities by bad actors,"" said Alon Gal, co-founder and CTO of cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock, who alerted Motherboard to the breach.Gal obtained a sample of the bot’s data, which Motherboard then shared with Facebook.“It is important that Facebook notify its users of this breach so they are less likely to fall victim to different hacking and social engineering attempts,"" Gal told Motherboard."
I’ve been a long term holder of this stock. Recently I’ve been very concerned with the 5-10 year outlook of this company. It seems growth has hit a stagnation point and political battles will hit the stock hard. Can anyone ease my concerns￼?
Just remember what drives a stock. It’s numbers not news! FB will report outstanding numbers!

FB GOING DOWN - American doesn’t like censorship. Communist companies that police it’s people that are patriotic and good honest people.
Going down
"Mark Zuckerberg, should begin to understand that teamsports teaches character. Zuckerberg, should join a softball team.We need to change his very rude nerdy, persona into moreof a Warren Buffet. FB should be $350 based on Value investing."
"Thanks Yahoo for not blocking my 1st Amendment right; allowing me to express my FREEDOM OF SPEECH. You're ok in my book, but not for Fakebook."
why is this stock still trending green?
"Fb took down the walk away group with over 500,000 followers targeting young conservatives."
"FB is undervalued. Forward PE for AMZN 166, GOOG 28, NFLX 101 GDDY 97. FB 28. With such a domination and keep redefining its future, this stock should have a double multiple. Stock price to $400. Strong buy."
"If you don't buy the stock...Facebook will do it for you.Institutions may be treating Facebook as a vice stock, refusing to add it to their holdings despite its attractive financials, due to the scrutiny it faces. Thankfully, over the past couple of years, Facebook has started utilizing its fat cash position to tangibly return capital to its shareholders. While the stock remains undervalued, management should be able to scoop up shares on the cheap and increase the long-term value creation for its shareholders. This should also serve as an additional catalyst in terms of the stock's potential to deliver superior returns over time."
Keeps going up ah! 
keep selling so i can keep buying
"Aww... Mark Zuckerbergs' feelings were hurt. Now he just blocks people he doesn't like.. even if its an entire country. What a baby. Why would you even pretend you wanted to be in elementary school again. That's how MZ ""rules"" FB. #$%$"
"If only FB would stop censoring people. They recently blocked the star of Hercules Kevin Sorbo from posting. FB is asking to be regulated. Not a smart move, imho."
Facebook doesn’t pay its investors a dividend what makes governments think they will pay them for news
"3 years ago, I decided to buy huge amount of one of Faang stocks, I picked fb because I think fb has the best balance between growth and value. Now omg facebook wasted me 3 years with only 20% gain . what should I do with my shares"
FB ... close it downPut it out of budiness
This stockIs going to new highs in next coupleOf weeks if not sooner
FB and twitter are going down. there are other platforms available that value your privacy and free speech. Other countries are changing laws to ensure FB and Twitter will never be able to do this to their people. Sell now before it's too late!
"Smart money is buying — ignore the temporary decline, FB is headed higher!!"
How much stock in this company do I need to buy to be allowed to say what I believe on Facebook?

"The financial markets are speaking clearly, definitely, and decisively: the Facebook pps will continue to languish and underperform as long as Zuckerberg and Sandberg remain in place. This management duo is earmarked as the most pernicious factor affecting share price today, even though the firm earned $10.10 per share last year and announced a $25 billion stock repurchase. Wake up, Zuckerberg, it is time for you to listen to the markets. Time for Zuckerberg and Sandberg to go!!"

extraordinary comeback
Of all the FAANG stocks...FB is the best short. The dumbest company leader with a great downside potential. Puts are reasonabley priced...easy to cover slightly out of the.money near term puts and roll over at a quantity multiple after cashing out. Just keep buying puts like 40 days out...when you get close to experation just get out at your profit and buy more.puts than your last trade. FB will keep going down foe a while...

"Fb continues making good money no matter people hate it. Do I like the CEO? No, I don’t like Zucker at all. He is acting like a dictator. Do I like fb stock and its app? Yes, I do!"
FB' s power trip is being judged around the globe my friends; not just in the US. This is a sinking ship.
Facebook censors better than Communist China who owns the Bidens? This company does not act like an American company? I can’t figure out￼ why they are so in align with Communist China? Maybe China has lent Mark Zuckerberg some money which they have invested a lot in our universities and they support Democratic candidates with the help of Communist spies like Sing Sing who escaped to China and the congressman she supported is still on the intelligence committee?
When everyone panic its time to buy or add shares.

Sell this stock if you have a soul
Stock will hit $300 during the earnings call.... Lots of positive news. Nothing to worry... FB is a money-making machine.
Gotta feel sorry for the people who bought in over 300. The good news is that you can recapture some of your losses via the tax loss when you sell. Every day you hold that tax loss is going to get bigger though.
I've been waiting for 6 months now for the break out.
Facebook censoring any rightwing opinions looks like the CCP censoring FB in China.

Free speech isn't protected by the 1st amendment when it incites violence and riots. FB didn't violate the constitution through their actions. All you bears saying this is the end of FB have no clue what you're talking about. People have nowhere else to go without using Facebook's products. It's moat is still intact. 50% of users leaving FB? Not even close. A small fraction of that may leave. FB will go on. You doomsdayers are delusional. And all these posts trying to score brownie points with yahoo users saying you are quitting FB. Total baloney. You all need to read up on the law before you go and quit your FB accounts. You pro Trumpers lost the election and you're going to lose out by quitting social media and selling your shares. I would love to own your shares so keep selling.
"FB, Twitter, Apple, Smart Phones etc are one conclusive study away from being labeled as more harmful than cigarettes and will come as a warning and a prohibition for certain age groups."

I canceled Facebook well over a year ago but now use Twitter to go after bad actors that are subversive that perpetuate non truths and foster terrorism in our country.

Sell sell sell this stock is going to collapse. I’m not a shorty. Just can’t see how folks wanna own this bad company and what it stands for
"Yes, indeed. A nice start in pre-market trading. Given the $185 call expiration this Friday, I'm betting we finish the week just shy of that price. And so long as Christmas season shopping reports remain strong, I'd expect FB's pps to continue upwards as we approach year end. Will be more than pleased if we finish the year somewhere in the $190s.But remember, there are still almost 5 billion people out there who for any number of reasons (No internet service for most of them) that are still an untapped market for FB. The progress in that area may be slow to fruition, but sooner or later that many people are not going to be without access to FB and its other sites.In summary, the future looks very bright."

"So now FB says it ""inadvertently"" banned Australia! Zuck must have attended the Andrew Cuomo school of delusion and spin doctoring."
I replaced Facebook and Facebook Messenger with MeWe. No corporate fascist totalitarianism either. Win-win.

Examples of other specialty markets we believe, may also have potential opportunity for partnerships are in plastic surgery, emergency medical services and ENT physicians.And similar to how we create an initial demand in the oral and dental surgery market, which led to a collaboration with Zimmer Biomet, we're approaching the plastic surgery market are running a small pilot with a couple of virtual sales representatives focused on office-based plastic surgeries.""$pton $fb $twtr my other top holdings!"

"This Founder-CEO scenario at Facebook has proven to be disastrous for shareholders, especially over the last three years since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Shareholders must now hold Zuckerberg and Sandberg accountable for their bungled management of that crisis and the lasting impact it’s had on shareholder value.

"‘We will not be intimidated’: PM takes Facebook fight to India and the worldGlobal leaders will be asked to back Australia in a fight with Facebook over its market power after the social media giant silenced news, health and emergency services in a bid to halt a federal law.Prime Minister Scott Morrison raised the shock tactic with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Thursday night in the first step of a plan to mobilise global support to stop Facebook “bullying” elected governments.“We will not be intimidated by this act of bullying by BigTech, seeking to pressure parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code.“I am in regular contact with the leaders of other nations on these issues. We simply won’t be intimidated, just as we weren’t when Amazon threatened to leave the country and when Australia drew other nations together to combat the publishing of terrorist content on social media platforms.”Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,” Mr Morrison said in his post.”These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Social media companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them.“Mr Morrison took plans to regulate social media to a G20 summit in Japan and a G7 meeting in France in 2019, when the Christchurch attack in March that year sparked calls to stop the spread of violent terror content.One option for the Prime Minister is to discuss Facebook and digital content regulation again this year when he attends the G7 summit hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Cornwall in June with leaders from Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.The proposed law, which mandates a bargaining code to force Google and Facebook to pay media companies for using their content, is being watched by these countries and the European Union as a precedent in regulating social media.Labor voted to support the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, clearing the way for it to pass the Senate and become law as early as next week.Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Facebook’s actions were “reprehensible” but the government had a responsibility to tell Australians what the next steps would be.Mr Morrison’s talks with Mr Modi, conducted by phone on Thursday afternoon, raised concerns about Facebook and its power when the company is seeking help from the Indian government in a huge market.“Decisions that are made here shape the global discussion,” Mr Zuckerberg told Indian business executives in December in a pitch to expand the company’s Whatsapp business app, which has 30 per cent of its global users in India.Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow rebuked Facebook for depriving users of public information including health and emergency updates.“Freedom of expression includes the right to speak and to receive information,” Mr Santow wrote."

"Facebook’s been there, and done that. Remember when major corporations were staging an ad boycott? That was suppose hit em hard with their revenues, and the share price drop was steeper than the current drop. Also, this is not the first time people are claiming to leave FB in masses. Just google up and you’ll see there had been some movement since years ago. And yet, Facebook is expanding globally and gains users every quarter. As many others pointed out, they have massive cash holdings. And... they have almost 0 long term debt. Buying anywhere near 20x P/E is absolutely value. Ride this out, and FB’s price will recover sooner rather than later."
Of course Facebook paints a gloomy outlook. Imagine what the regulators would try to do to them if they actually admitted they are crushing everyone and really don’t see any problems with overtaking the world in 5’years.
"Looking at FB’s balance sheet and cash flows, they have $11 billion in debt, total cash of $24 billion, and between $23-$24 billion free cash flow. If they wanted to they could pay down their debt and have plenty of cash left over. The only reason people shouldn’t like this stock is for moral reasons, of which I personally have nothing against the company. Most of the FAANGs are cash generating machines and now NFLX is going to be cash flow positive as well. The FAANGs may not have performed much as of late but long term they will still do well with their durable competitive advantages. FB is undervalued right now."
 The 7 Best Stocks To Buy In March 2021  Check out https://youtu.be/tpqEbEZywA4
"Facebook shareholders, Facebook employees: we must make 2021 the year to maximize shareholder value. The fist step to maximizing shareholder value is to push for a 3:1 stock split. While a split is no guarantee of stock price appreciation, there’s plenty of historical data that shows stock splits leads to enhanced shareholder wealth. Let’s use the recent split by Apple, which initiated a 4:1 stock split on 8/28/20. Since that split, the stock has appreciated significantly, nearly 17%, or 40% if expressed on an annual basis. Zuckerberg refuses to split the stock because it doesn’t serve his best personal interests; shareholders deserve a leadership team to serve their best interests. Time to maximize shareholder wealth; time for Zuckerberg and Sandberg to GO!"

"it is completely fair...many people get banned for doing much less...a person's position of power should not put them above the law/rules/terms of using a service. if anything, their abuse should be considered more material.this isn't political...in fact, the complaints coming from the conservative aisle is hypocritical when republican views actually tend to favor a private business to run/moderate their business as they see fit and should be allowed to employ or serve whomever they see fit, regardless. wasn't there a recent controversy over a baker refusing to make a cake...the argument that these forums are considered journalistic is absurd...then all online forums and websites should be considered as such, and every user/person posting comments here is now a journalist... and then people believe these social ""media outlets"" shouldn't be political...wth, have you turned on any news channel/station? they are all politically biased! so FB is a media company, and instead of them determining what content they want to publish, they are going to be censored and controlled by government to determine what is published...so now we have state media under the guise of a public forum? the hypocrisy never ends..."

AS I TOLD U THIS WEEKEND....FAKEBOOK is DONE and the stock will DROP EACH DAY and it will ACCELERATE. The stench of FAKEBOOK is unmistakable and immovable. By Friday FAKEBOOK will be a shadow of itself. I was shocked to hear on so many stations today of BOTH...BOTH I TELL YOU conservative and liberal speaking about FAKEBOOK in NEGATIVE WAYS. And now advertisers are/will flee in line with the more socially conscious movement and a perfect OUT FOR THEM to stop advertising on such a wicked platform. And look at after hours....NOTHING ...NO BIG RECOVERY...and the same tomorrow because IT IS OVER FOR FAKEBOOK. DONE. I know these things and it is DONE. Boolean

"We are in a pandemic, how can ppl delete there accounts and avoid staying in touch for loved ones. No one lives a private life anymore and that’s reality. The governments are watching you either way so wake up everyone. Ppl deleting their accounts are a bunch of sheep just following others and not really knowing what’s going on out there.

"U.K. Opens Investigation of Facebook’s Purchase of Giphy(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. started a formal investigation of Facebook Inc.’s $400 million purchase of Giphy Inc., saying it will look at whether the deal hurts competition in the supply of video clips and animated images.The Competition and Markets Authority set a deadline of March 25 for its initial decision, setting a timeline on a review that has already been marked by a court clash. Facebook had previously argued that the CMA imposed unreasonable and disproportionate restrictions on the company.The CMA is increasingly voicing concerns about internet giants swallowing up smaller firms. Its Chief Executive Officer, Andrea Coscelli, said in October that the largest tech companies should face scrutiny for any transaction, no matter how tiny.Facebook had to pause its integration with Giphy in June after the CMA said it wanted to investigate whether the deal would give the social network too much information on its rivals’ operations."

"Sen. Ed Markey wrote a scathing letter to Mark Zuckerberg condemning Facebook groups as 'breeding grounds for hate' and 'venues for coordination of violence' • Sen. Ed Markey wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg condemning Facebook's practice of recommending political groups to people. • ""Facebook's system of recommending political groups poses grave threats to American democracy and public safety,"" Markey wrote. • The letter references the siege on the US Capitol on January 6 — insurrectionists were found to have organized online.US Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote a scathing letter to Mark Zuckerberg condemning Facebook's method of recommending political groups to users on its platform. A representative of Markey's office shared the letter with Insider.The Massachusetts senator said Facebook not only allows users to ""organize and coordinate violent and anti-democratic efforts on these pages,"" but that it recommends them to people.""Facebook's system of recommending political groups poses grave threats to American democracy and public safety,"" Markey wrote in the letter. ""Many Facebook groups (pages on your platform that function as forums for users to communicate about a particular topic) are breeding grounds for hate, echo-chambers of misinformation, and venues for coordination of violence, including explicit planning for the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.""Markey said Facebook ""failed to meet commitments it made"" to stop the practice, commitments that Markey said were also made in Zuckerberg's responses during a hearing before the US Senate in October.During the hearing, Zuckerberg said the company has taken ""the step of stopping recommendations in groups for all political content or social issue groups as a precaution for this."" In early January, Facebook reiterated that it still does not recommend political groups for people to join. But according to Markey, Facebook is not keeping to its word.The senator referenced an investigation by The Markup that found 12 of the top 100 groups recommending on Facebook were political, including groups that promoted violence.Markey is demanding that Facebook address this discrepancy and provide an explanation by February 9."
Going down because of censorship. Take your money out before it drops
There is a boycott of FB today. It will be happening every Friday from now on.
William - this isn't politics this is business fact....due to THE ZUCK his business is losing customers on all platforms and advertisers will leave en masse and are leaving already....so investors are forward looking not backward looking so that means the chart I see that is collapsing will smash this stock barring something I have not seen or heard yet...but 98% rating is DOWN and will continue DOWN.

"Very interesting player in the market who trades FB against TSLA intraday. I am not certain whether there are other securities in its basket but its Algo' trades these two against each other. I have traded this Reverse trade for three days and have done well. I spotted and traded a very similar reverse trade between BA and AAPL in September through November 2020. I do not know whose Algo it is but GS upgraded or reiterated FB a few weeks ago and FB has been sliding while TSLA has been rising. GS did the very same thing to BA and put it on its Buy List. BA went down significantly until it finally found a bottom and bounced. My guess is that it is either GS or one of its bigger clients. At any rate, enjoy the action while it lasts. Happy New Year."
"these companies making big mistake here... the USA has a ferocious libertarian history, our American revolution was ANTI government, the left should take heed....resulting in our remarkable constitution a brilliant document masterful in reach and design... the left wing is awakening a sleeping giant, a huge mistake castigating those outside their left wing ideology as ""deplorable and olive garden customers...."

BUYBACK SHARES!FB is hindered by negative image of Zuckerberg.
FB briefly this morning broke up past its 50 Day $266 and 200 Day $268 Moving Avgs before retreating. It’s got its engines lit and will make another thrust at the resistance levels.

The “smart money” has arrived on the FB scene!
Relative valuation suggests Facebook stock has entered the buy territory.
Has Facebook already been run up? Very undervalued
Anyone know when $FB is having their investor day? Both Twitter and Snap popped off when they talked about what's new.
IT plunged 20$ TWENTY dollars TODAY! After this ER! GRAAAAAATS who shorted this #$%$
"Buy that dip, clear support"
"I used to believe this would be one of the best 21st century investments. No more. Way, way too much of a negative vibe surrounding everything fAcebook. It’s killed a nice opportunity. Zuck will continue to sell shares and reap billions."
The numbers were stellar if it was any other company it would be up at least 10 percent AH
"facebook stock is at a very high risk because it Is not as critical as other services like Amazon and Apple to most people's life. When the account deleting wave come, its stock shall be a free fall."
Good place to start 'scaling-in!'.
Enough already. It’s time for Apple to create its own FB...(ASM)Apple Social Media would be awesome!
Buy the dip !

"“ The social media giant said it was backed into a corner by a new law there, which requires Internet companies to pay news publishers for their content and for those rates to be set by a government arbitrator.

"The FB rally has strong ""sexy legs"" and will run into next week's barn burner earnings release as a new more pragmatic Administration takes over in D.C._- Plus, funadamentals of: revenue growth, earnings and profit growth are back in focus for investors -- as investors shift their focus to what really matters in the scheme of the investing process!"
Let’s see what happens with two hours left.. hold on tight kiddds
FB losing subs by the millions. App Banned in China so no growth to pick up the slack. Boy is this a sinking ship!
"This is a no brainer. BUY BUY BUY. FB beats on top and bottom line. They had to mention the ""uncertainty"" so that the stock drops more so they can buy back shares cheaper. These guys are not here for today and tomorrow. They are thinking long term. The ""uncertainty"" in ad revenue means nothing and is not a surprise. Look at the numbers. This will hit 300 in no time."
$300 by earnings ...apple and Facebook strong
"I already bough level 261, 262 and 263. I don't worry . I am buying more and accumulate. Pretty sure SPY will breakout 300 next week. Shorties will suffer huge Monday Premarket...20 yrs in the market. BUY a lot now"

"I can praise Facebook's financials all day long. The company has $55B in cash, ready to be deployed in all sorts of fruitful ventures and acquisitions in the future, and $0 of long-term debt. It also enjoys gross and net income margins of 80%+ and 35%+, respectively. You can love or hate Facebook. However, any investor who has ever looked at its financial statements should agree that its metrics are just too good to be true."
Oculus and other products will be big going forward.
"This is great FB is purging all those people who proliferate disinformation and conspiracy theories. Old Donny bone spur is gone, just one more stop for him and that's prison for tax evasion or worse sedition. He's destroyed his brand and now it'll be fun to watch as he pardons all his kids and himself. So all you anti-democracy right wing zealots and fascists , sell, sell, sell. I'll step in and reap your profits, can hardly wait to get the cash you should've been collecting. I'm buying, so you make sure you sell."
Excellent buying opportunity. Buy before the sale ends!
FB won’t be so easy from now on!
"It's risky... but all FB has to do is somehow incentivize people to ""opt in"" to ad tracking. Most Americans are so poor the would opt in to ad tracking if FB sent them $1 as a reward sign up bonus. Another way to easily get people to OPT IN.. is disable some often used facebook features until they ""opt in"". I know I personally would click YES in a second if it got a pop up window saying... ""Please opt into to ad tracking so we can cater to your interest more with our targeted ads and make your experience better"". If that window popped up a few time on FB.. everyone would click it after 1 day just to make it go away.Third option would be a subscription model of like $1 to download FB. But make a disclaimer that buying this app requires you be tracked. So you have FACEBOOK... and FACEBOOK MAX. (handicap regular facebook until people switch over).anyway.. FB has options... i'm sure there are better ones that this."
FB is on serious  FIYA’!!!

Every tyranny on earth started with the restriction of free speech! END YOUR ACCOUNT AND SELL YOUR POSITIONS. BLM ANTIFA and others still have facebook accounts even after billions of dollars of terror damage!

"What is the Facebook strategic plan? Where does the management team want to take the company over the next five years? When’s the last time we heard someone from the company talk bullishly about the company prospects? It’s been years since anyone has talked strategically about the firm, in the meantime the stock price continues to languish because of a lack of direction,a lack of market confidence in the company, a lack of trust in the company. The firm has no bullish spokespeople; the shareholders cannot rely on Mark “The Whiner” Zuckerberg or Sheryl “Happy Talk” Sandberg or David “Chief Buzzkill” Wehner to provide strategic vision. Shareholders must demand a change or we will never achieve maximum market value of our investments. Zuckerberg and Sandberg must GO!"

"Facebook, Amazon, TikTok, other tech giants ordered by FTC to turn over info on privacy practicesThe privacy practices of nine major technology companies, including Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet’s YouTube (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB), are being scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission.The FTC voted 4-1 to issue orders on Monday to those three companies, along with ByteDance’s TikTok, online gaming communication company Discord, Reddit, Snap (SNAP), Twitter, (TWTR), and Facebook’s WhatsApp., to hand over wide-ranging data on how they collect, use, and present personal information.The FTC directed the companies to provide data on their advertising and user engagement practices, and how their practices affect children and teens.“Despite their central role in our daily lives, the decisions that prominent online platforms make regarding consumers and consumer data remain shrouded in secrecy,” stated a December 4 letter from a bipartisan group of FTC commissioners including Democrat Rohit Chopra, Democrat Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, and Republican Christine Wilson.That letter added: “Critical questions about business models, algorithms, and data collection and use have gone unanswered. Policymakers and the public are in the dark about what social media and video streaming services do to capture and sell users’ data and attention. It is alarming that we still know so little about companies that know so much about us.”Specifically, the agency said it wants information related to how social media and video streaming services collect, use, track, estimate, or derive personal and demographic information, and how the companies determine which ads and content consumers see. The FTC wants to know whether the companies apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information, and the impact of such efforts.The FTC asked the social media and video streaming services to illustrate, in detail, how they utilize demographic information collected on age, country, and whether a user is of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin. The FTC asked them to share the inputs and methodology for assessing their services’ reach, as well as to identify the top 1,000 most populous attributes that make a user valuable to their platform."
"El Paso Sheriff's Officers Association says Facebook page taken down without warningEL PASO, Texas (KFOX14) — Leaders of the El Paso County Sheriff’s Officers Association say they were blindsided by Facebook’s decision to take down their page this week.The heads of the group feel their political statements on the page weren’t enough to warrant a suspension.“This was just, it’s a big shock,” El Paso County Sheriff’s Officers Association president Pete Faraone said.On Valentine’s Day, sheriff’s officers association president Pete Faraone tried to log on to the group’s Facebook account, looking to post a message to their more than 7300 followers.But when he pulled up the page, Faraone got an unwelcome surprise instead.“On February 14th, Facebook took down our page with no advance notice, they didn’t provide us with any reason or explanation,” Faraone said.Click on the group’s Facebook page now, and all you’ll get is an error message, saying the page may have been removed.Faraone said while they may have lost their site, they still don’t know why.“There was no opportunity to fix whatever they saw as harmful,” Faraone said. “And that’s where we are now.”Leaders of the sheriff's officer’s association said they didn’t understand Facebook’s decision to remove their page, as it was mostly used to celebrate officer’s achievements and highlight how the group has given back to El Pasoans.“Our last three posts were actually a retirement luncheon for some of our guys to thank them for their service, I presented an officer with the deputy of the year award, and the other one was a Make-A-Wish, where we did a drive-by parade for a sweet little boy that’s on the Make-A-Wish program,” Faraone said.Group leaders said the only content on the page that could be considered controversial were posts they made in response to local political leaders calling to defund police."
"i hate the majority of facebook’s business practices, but the sheer possibilities of Oculus and CTRLlabs under facebook’s cash machine could become huge in the future"

It bounced off the 200 day moving average. Hopefully that’s as low as it’s going.

FB has been beaten down far too much for far too long. Time to sour above $300+. I am a TSLA investor but can clearly see FB is way undervalued.

Be patient longs. FB stock is consolidating for a breakout. Quarter after Quarter of revenue growth from mobile advertising cannot be stopped. Any political headwinds from privacy issues or hate speech will not stop this company from 25-30% growth for the next 10 years. Trust it. $300 before next earnings.
$20 swing? Really?
"I don't drink, smoke, gamble, swear, or do drugs, but Yahoo has deleted almost all of my innocent posts today."
"I'm long FB. Going to be a $1000 per share. No doubt. Hurdles or no hurdles. Ad revenue will grow every quarter, old DAU's will leave and new DAU;s will join. Simple."
The only reason I won’t go all in here is because overall market is due for pullback. If that happens 225-230 is possible so I’ll continue to add slowly
I do hope this stock crashes.
"Look at the one year chart: great since March, but lagging the market and poised to rise.Look at the EPS, fantastic... HUGE beats the last two quarters. Look at the market situation, FOMO at highest levels; NFLX just crushed and set up the market for more big tech gains. Look at the reasons why FB has been held down: politics & fear of regulation; valid regulatory concerns, but the sum of parts is worth more than the whole in a breakup scenario, and FB lawyers are head and shoulders above the govt who already approved FB acquisitions prior years. FB has the lowest valuation of all the FAANG. If FB just meet estimates, we are at $9.25 EPS @35x = $323. If they beat as usual, we are at $9.50-$10 EPS.35x multiple at $9.50 is $332.FB stock is still CHEAP!!! The recent selloff and current share price is a huge opportunity to get in before it jumps higher. FB will be over $300 after earnings and STILL sorely lagging behind it's peers.."
Made a huge profit shorting this turd today. Thanks Fascists for buying and thinking it was going to recover...Never doubt the patriotism in this country!
ER...buy the rumor...sell the fact.
Funny how all of these paid analysts put up higher price targets right when the Nasdaq hits ridiculous highs because of the stay-at-home pandemic and then you see hedge funds have sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth last quarter. I've seen this before many times.This is called paid manipulation before a big drop.

Without Wattsapp, and with TikTok eating at Instragram, could get very ugly in Zuckland. Best of luck to you all!"
I have been a shareholder for many years and enjoyed big gains but censorship in our free speech democracy is dangerous. I’m sure the stock will continue to grow but the hypocrisy is too much. Good luck to all but I’m out.

"‘Arrogant’ and ‘wrong’: Australia slams Facebook’s move to block news as unnecessary and heavy-handed • The social media giant on Wednesday said it will no longer allow publishers and users in Australia to share or view news on its platform. • Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Facebook’s actions were “as arrogant as they were disappointing.” • “Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary. They were heavy handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said at a media briefing on Thursday.The Australian government has slammed Facebook’s decision to block users in the country from all news content on its platform — a move that ended up affecting access to several government sites.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Facebook’s move “arrogant” and “disappointing,” while Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it was “wrong” and “unnecessary.”The social media company on Wednesday announced its decision to ban Australian users from viewing and sharing news content. It came ahead of an expected decision by the Australian parliament to pass a new media bill that will require online platforms like Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for displaying and linking to their content.“Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary. They were heavy-handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” Frydenberg said at a media briefing on Thursday.“Their decision to block Australians’ access to government sites — be they about support through the pandemic, mental health, emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology — were completely unrelated to the media code, which is yet to pass through the Senate,” he said.Frydenberg’s comments were later followed by strong criticism from Morrison.“Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,” Morrison said in a Facebook post.In addition to pages run by news outlets, several government-backed Australian accounts were also wiped clean by Facebook on Thursday morning. Government pages affected include those providing updates on the Covid pandemic and bushfire threats.Facebook’s decision was in contrast to that of Google. The latter on Wednesday said it has agreed on a revenue-sharing deal with Australian media conglomerate News Corp, which owns media outlets including The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.“We will not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code,” said the prime minister.Human rights advocates also criticized Facebook’s move. Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement posted on Twitter that the social media giant is restricting important information such as Covid-19 updates.“Facebook is severely restricting the flow of information to Australians,” she said.“This is an alarming and dangerous turn of events. Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable,” she added.Facebook’s “overreach” earlier Thursday that restricted Australians’ access to non-news pages was a “bad” public relations move, said Tama Leaver, a professor at Curtin University’s School of Media, Creative Arts and Social Inquiry.“I think Facebook has lost the PR battle by enforcing a ban that’s just simply too wide,” Leaver told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” on Thursday.“If Facebook was hoping this would remind Australians how important Facebook is, I think really they’re gonna remind that Facebook does things without considering the consequences on its users,” he added."
All time high is 304. FB will blow by that number. i predict 330 tomorrow. Shops is going to become more visible regarding revenues and that will drive it higher than most people think.

"Facebook to close Irish holding companies at centre of tax disputeIntellectual property to be repatriated to the US after IRS said it was owed $9bn in taxesFacebook is winding up Irish holding companies it has used to channel billions of profits to avoid paying taxes in the US, the UK and hundreds of other countries.The company’s main Irish subsidiary paid $101m (£75m) in tax while recording profits of more than $15bn in 2018, the last year for which records are available. Facebook companies around the world paid the Irish holding company for use of its intellectual property.Facebook International Holdings I Unlimited Company recorded revenue of $30bn in 2018, more than half of Facebook’s total global turnover of $56bn.The company’s decision to close the Irish divisions and return its intellectual property to the US came shortly after the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) took the company to court claiming it owed more than $9bn linked to its 2010 decision to shift its profits to Ireland. Before its stock market flotation in 2012, Facebook valued its intangible assets at $6.5bn in 2010, but the IRS claimed the true value was $21bn.The decision to wind up three of Facebook’s Irish holding companies was recorded by the Irish Companies Registration Office.Facebook paid just £28.6m in tax in the UK last year, even though it recorded £2.2bn in gross revenue from advertisers, according to accounts filed this month at Companies House. The tax payment was up only £100,000 on the previous year despite profits rising by more than a quarter.Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary group on responsible taxation, said the tiny tax payment “beggars belief”.“While other companies have struggled during the pandemic, big tech has thrived as people spend more and more time online,” she said. “Facebook and the rest of the tech giants must do their moral duty and pay their fair share.”Google moved its intellectual property holdings from Ireland back to the US in January, before the closing of the “double Irish” tax loophole, which has been used by US companies to channel international profits through Ireland and on to tax havens like Bermuda, keeping them outside the US. Ireland agreed to close the scheme under international pressure five years ago but companies were given until the end of 2020 to comply."

I’m long the stock and haven’t seen the prompt Facebook is going to show apple users about opting in to advertisers. But I’ve spoken with three people who say they don’t buy Marks plea to opt in for for the good of small businesses. Maybe it’s well written and is more persuasive then I think though too. Any thoughts on this and does anybody have any idea of what the percentage revenues will be if most people opt out? I’ve been long since 86 bucks and am curious to anybody’s constructive thoughts.

"The all time high is barely 7% (about $14) up from here. All of this worrying and hand wringing is a little overdone. This is a stock that can do 7% in just a few days.

"Apple has announced changes that will adversely affect the way our ad systems work and may impact your ability to reach people with personalized ads. In early 2021, we expect Apple to require all apps in the App Store to implement its AppTrackingTransparency framework. This will affect the ability of apps to receive conversion data from iOS users.Apple's AppTrackingTransparency framework will limit the information that can be exchanged with third parties like Facebook, which may significantly impact ad creation, ad personalization, and performance reporting. This disruption will affect advertisers using pixel, Conversions API, or any other Facebook Business Tools that optimize, target, or report on events from a web domain.What do you need to plan for? Since I do advertisements on FB this can't be good for FB as they will lose customers like me if my conversion doesn't pan out as advertisement on FB ain't cheap either per impression. iPhone account for 80% of all users onlineOnce Apple enforces these changes, domains with existing web events will be configured by Facebook to send no more than 8 default events. All ad sets optimizing for events outside the 8 auto-configured pixel events will be paused.For domains where multiple businesses or personal ad accounts own pixels, domain verification must be completed. This can be done by the Business Manager."

"Dumped $TWTR, $AMZN & $FB this morning. It's beyond to understand why these companies do such stupid things and alienate half(+) of this country. Makes for poor business decisions. Khamenei posts stand while that of an American citizen are removed and is banned forever........"
Hopefully these losses hold until after 7 so I can do some shopping.
"You blokes are simply purging the weakest FB hands from the playing field!- Just look at the paltry volume, and you’ll realize that the smart money is simply picking up cheaper shares during this sale.***Essentially, FB’s basing pattern will achieve a Rock of Gibraltar core, from which to explode in a protracted upside surge to new all time highs!- FB is way bigger and too important to the world , to be affected by you Don Quixotes, jousting against the Giant windmill, eh?!- So cary on and cheerio!"
Buy FB 
Owned FB for 6+ years and sold yesterday. Did well but the hypocrisy is too disturbing. Closed my FB account this morning. Freedom of speech is not a political issue. It is a right that makes our country great.
Dropbox is pretty good at Cloud Services. So don't need Amazon. Likewise lots of people use Facebook as a general ID for posting. Not sure who else to pick. G-mail?
Why would you invest your money so it can censor you? Crazy times!

No one to blame but the manager (Zuck). If this were a baseball team, he would have been fired months ago. He's got his team basically playing .500 ball despite having a roster of all-star performers."

This is so obviously still on sale. Fundamentals will always beat rhetoric in time. See you guys at 300. This will age well.
Congratulations to FB for cancelling the account of the President
The chart still says - FB IS GOING DOWN AGAIN and will blow through the lows set earlier.

"Has there ever been a stock like FB that stays in the limelight for all the wrong reasons. Seems like bad press follows FB with the same intensity as a wolf chasing raw meat. Don't recall how many times I've said, ""Well, this (Bad press, i.e.) will be over soon."". Thankfully, there aren't any social media sites with FB's reach that advertisers can turn to, so the revenues and profits should continue to pour into their coffers. Most analysts' price targets are $100 above our current pps. We're gonna get there eventually, right?"
Sell sell sell.
Institutions are going to eat this deal up very soon.

I wonder how much consideration FB put into the lives lost protecting free speech? Yahoo Its a legit question please dont delete
How much did fakebook lost by now. I know yesterday it was like 47billion!
Remember not to use WhatsApp. Delete that platform and use Signal.
"I feel that FB absolutely needs to start issuing a dividend to shareholders. The company is still one of the most profitable around, but continues to get itself caught up in various situations/headwinds that the stock can't make any progress. To compensate shareholders for holding through all the nonsense, they need to at least issue a dividend because the stock seemingly no longer trades like a growth stock."
Sell this stock and keep freedom alive.
"These social media companies have entered dangerous territory, too much power in the hands of too few people, their ability to manipulate the narrative will bring their downfall."

They are now taking down anti-vaccine ads what a wonderful way to make the stock go up. Vaccines are A waste being that people who take them still have to wear a mask. Corona kills 1% of the population the same as flu.￼￼￼￼. More people die in automobile accidents and cigarettes. Don’t let Zohn find out about what I just told you he’ll have a heart attack.￼￼￼
Next quarter is going to be worse since their advertisements are leaving in drove due to censorship...

"Even if you cancel your Facebook and Twitter account, the FBI is looking for you because you were spotted on cameras"
What I don’t understand is Facebook helps these news organization by having a platform where they can promote their content. Thanks to Facebook more people will go on a small news site website because it’s readily available meaning those small news organizations get more Ad dollars or maybe more subscribers. But if it wasn’t for Facebook how else would these small news organizations get their word out? They will just be buried in google and no one will know about them. If anything they should be paying Facebook for the free advertisement

Good time to exit. Not sold on the fact that FB isn't going to lose some advertisers with the move to suppress free speech. I could be wrong but I doubt most Americans feel FB was in the right to remove the first amendment rights of Americans.

To date, they've enjoyed the support of the MSM, but as each day passes, more and more people are discounting what they hear on TV or read in the newspapers because they know there's a lot of bias in what they say or downright lying."

"Well, so much for a big run up prior to the earnings announcement. Up big in pre-market and now down just as big. Still, when the overall markets take a hit as they are this morning, even the good stocks get dumped. Dunno. Maybe today is the start of that long predicted 10% correction? If so, won't make a whole lotta difference what gets reported after hours today. Might see a bump in after hours, however if the market slide continues tomorrow nd into Friday, it won't be pretty for anyone."

Don’t worry y’all 265 by tomorrow if not then Wednesday This has bottomed here strong support
So glad I sold FB 2 months ago while it was showing weakness. Too much controversy about its product. Share price is falling off a cliff.

"The volatile, erratic, irrational movement of this stock will NEVER subside until some of the key management team players are removed. The market greatly distrusts this company, and the only way to restore credibility with the market is to replace key components of the management team; change is always good, and will assuredly be applauded by the market. I find it unfathomable the BoD approved the 2018 agreement to collude with Google- change is imperative. ."

"Bob, how about $85/sh? nope, lower... oh geez... we're runing out of time, join us again..."
"Richard notes that FB dropped after earnings 9 times out of the last 11 reports. it also ran up all of those times *before* earnings. It's running up again now. Does that mean the pattern is repeating itself? Maybe. But maybe not. Eventually, once ""everyone knows"" about a pattern in the stock market, that's about when it stops working.Maybe it'll sell off again this time, but I suspect ""this time will be different."" FB rallied the last few days, but overall it has lagged the other FANG stocks for the last few months. It hasn't made significant new highs. In fact, FB actually first hit 188.00 in AH trading on 11/1/2017, before Zuck killed the rally. There is some negative sentiment and I think earnings expectations are WAY too low. I think this quarter, 4Q2017 will go down in history as one of the biggest blowouts of all time. I think $200-210 is a conservative view on the post earnings move. I wouldn't be surprised to see $220-230 within a few weeks after results come out. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, eventually, the market will stop listening to Zuck's naysaying, and if this ER's results are good enough, there's nothing he can say to kill the monster rally we're about to see."
FB parabolic surge in the making 28++ BILION revenues!!!
FAKEBOOK ACCT. NONE. SO GLAD AND FEELS GREAT!!!! Boolean
about time fb starts to move higher
moved 500k usd to tsla in nov and it doubled.
In 3 years Facebook revenue doubled from 40 Billion -> 80 billion and stock doubled from 125-> 250+In 3 years Apple revenue grown around 25% (229B->280B) but stock grown almost 5 times (29->145)Hard to use logic here.
Facebook & Twitter showed us all how to hate each other. Neither company can be salvaged.

I told you guys two weeks ago that facebook was a steal at under the 200 moving average price. At the end the market always corrects itself and you simply can't keep down a stock like this for too long. FB makes too much money to justify price drops for too long
"The real ""bully"" in this situation was Australia; FB showed that they won't back down or lay down for a bully like the Australian government. Australian journalist/publishers are realizing that putting their content on FB without FB paying them a nickel for it is way more lucrative than not being on FB at all. Its like starting a fight on the playground because one person is better at a particular game than the others and then that person that is better at that game kicks your +++ for starting the fight in the first place."

And eliminating a competitor, albeit one small by comparison to FB, GOOG and TWTR, won't help them in their battle with pols over charges that they are too big and/or are a monopoly. Lately, Zuck doing more harm than good for shareholders. Without his childish antics and comments, FB would easily be a $350-$400 stock."

"You can not like FB for moral reasons but from an investment point of view there is nothing to dislike. Extremely high margins, little debt leverage, 24 billion in cash, 23 billion free cash flow. All in all, a cash machine with a durable competitive advantage. And it is inexpensive at these levels, very underpriced. So when it comes to your morals it might be a questionable investment but from a money making standpoint it’s a no brainer. I invested at $66 in 2013 and haven’t sold a single share."

"Citi analyst: “Citi analysts said Facebook is likely to continue to be a primary beneficiary of the ongoing shift to digital ads, with shopping tools poised to benefit from the surge in e-commerce. Facebook ad revenue should accelerate further than its third-quarter 22% year-over-year growth led by ongoing recovery and a heavy e-commerce holiday season, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week. Those analysts project fourth-quarter ad revenue growth of 26% year over year. Oppenheimer analysts said they anticipate fourth-quarter advertising revenue will “handily” top Wall Street estimates at 30% year over year versus estimates of 25%. They added that according to Gupta Media, fourth-quarter global CPMs at Facebook and Instagram were up 35% year over year, up from -12% year over year in the third quarter. Facebook’s e-commerce is also gaining traction.“The company did a great job in 2020 of preparing Facebook Shops and many other e-commerce ad products (IG product tags, etc.) for the 4Q holiday season, and adoption was very robust based on our checks,” Barclays analysts said. ‘’"

"Facebook and Google could lose bargaining power under upcoming U.S. bill to help news outletsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bipartisan members of Congress plan to introduce a bill in coming weeks to make it easier for smaller news organizations to negotiate with Big Tech platforms, said Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.The U.S. bill would be introduced at a time when Australia is in a pitched battle with Facebook. The social media giant blocked news feeds and other pages - including those of charities, and health and emergency services - as part of a dispute over a proposed law that would require it and Google to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree on a price through arbitration.Buck, who was named the ranking member this month, told Reuters on Thursday the panel would bring out a series of antitrust bills and the first one in the coming weeks would allow smaller news organizations to negotiate collectively with Facebook and Alphabet's Google.Social media companies use news to attract customers and have been accused by news publishers of not sharing enough advertising revenue with them. The legislation could boost sales in the struggling news business.While Facebook has fought publishers, Google has struck deals with them in France, Australia and other countries.Google announced this week that it had agreed to a global deal with News Corp that involved ""significant payments"" to the news organization, in one of the most extensive deals of its kind.Smaller publishers using Google's ad sales technology have for years griped about their bigger competitors getting more favorable revenue-sharing deals from the search giant.The news industry is undeniably struggling, with employment at U.S. newspapers down by half since 2008 amid tumbling advertising revenue and changing media habits, according to data from Pew Research.""What publishers have experienced is that platforms go to them one by one, make them sign NDAs and try to optimize per publisher without publishers being able to compare notes,"" said David Chavern, president and chief executive officer of the News Media Alliance, an industry trade group that is promoting the bill.“Big national publishers probably have the capacity to get their own deals. If you look at smaller publishers, the only way to get some fair value is if they act together.""In October, the antitrust subcommittee's majority report detailed abuses by tech giants such as Google and Facebook. In his own report, Buck and three fellow Republicans expressed interest in some changes in antitrust law aimed at strengthening enforcers.Buck said he wanted the focus to remain on the tech giants. ""The biggest threat to the free market economy is big tech and it (potential legislation) should be fairly tightly focused on that,"" he said."

"FB looks very attractive, and is one of the best about low pe/growth ratio stocks I can find. FB has been caught in tech sell off drama, but this a CYCLICAL winner (advertising is highly cyclical) and a SECULAR winner as FB continues to gain advertising market share. FB is on sale and I say time to load up on FB!"

"i grew up in a time with no cell phones or computers. We had fun and enjoyed the company of other people who we actually talked to.

"Their is an article written by Allum Bokhari. He points out that Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, Newsmax, Yahoo, Apple, and others mine our data to skew the way we think, VOTE, purchases goods, and work. If anyone believes this is free speech you are mistaken because these internet providers have the power to take down any post that their speech police deem to be biased concerning articles by people and or politicians that are on the ultra left, liberal, or populist. They do not allow much by the conservatist view points to be persued. Therefore it is my belief that the government of the world need to break their monopolies up."
"Honestly despite what people say about Facebook, we all know that it will grow revenue more and more. Think about the risk/reward. I can’t see Facebook going away in the future so I think there’s little risk with this investment"
300 soonConsider this a warning.
"Share price is caught in between Mark and Tim verbal wars. FB share price is affected by political environment and public opinions more than by its earnings. From today's high 280 and current low at 266, that's quite a few billions evaporated."

"I am following the drama with Facebook, now with Australia. I made the comment a couple years ago, after hearing Zuckerberg speaking at a private engagement, and then hearing his ""backstage"" discussions about the internet, who will guide it in the future, etc. It scared the $h|+ out of me. I have been anti-Facebook since. Fast forward 2 years to today. Facebook is now influencing elections, shaping the news, what we are allowed to know and not know (i.e., ""fact-checking""), and so forth. Is it any wonder why apps like Parler were SHUT DOWN by Android and Apple (and blocked by Amazon)? It was out of FEAR. People are fighting back. It's a (somewhat) quiet movement right now, but it's like water on a hot stove...at some point it's going to boil over. Not sure where it goes with Facebook, but if I were a betting person I'd say it does not play out well for the company in 5 to 10 years."

"What don't people understand about FB? They just said we don't care about half of our user base... and we don't care about free speech.. because we need to be your Big Brother... where was FB this summer with all the fires, riots, and deaths? Who's accounts got taken down then? Kamala Harris supported the riots...was she taken down to protect us? How about Maxine Waters? Was she banned? How about Cynthia Johnson who threatened Trumpsters on FB? Is she banned? You can't lose half your user base and expect this stock to jump back up... it's absurd.. how would forward guidance look? Ummmm we lost half our customers.. but we got a new filter to play with...?"
Decline in FB viewers skewed by unwanted alerts and notifications. Try ridding yourself of this fungus—good luck. It will destroy the peace in your life. Good luck Zucker (only one letter off of what you are.). “Unsubscribe”—what does that mean to you? I have no intention of supporting FB.

A low volume upward means a lot of manipulation in stock. It's dangerous either way.

Just loaded up the truck at 248.50. Could it it go leven lower? Sure. But the upside at this level far outweighs the downside risk.

"I have a question for Facebook management, and perhaps shareholders... The Facebook Live feature is a great option for users to share with their peeps and friends but why doesn't Facebook work out a program for musicians and other entertainers to receive proper tips during a live stream. I see a lot of entertainers using Facebook live to advertise their Patreon channels; the free publicity is great for them but why doesn't Facebook find a way to keep the entertainers live on Facebook rather than moving their audience to another platform? I know, it's all about the money. If Facebook provided a proper way for customers to tip entertainers then the entertainment with stay on Facebook. Sadly, Facebook invented a STAR system for tipping and that system takes 40% up front away from Facebook customers so less than 60% reaches the entertainer. This is a very bad and backwards system. Entertainers should get 100% of their tips up to a certain agreed upon minimum then split the rest with the house (in this case Facebook) in some logical fashion that entertainers are willing to accept... Perhaps a quick review of whatever percentage Patreon takes would give Facebook an idea of what's appropriate. Regardless, taking money up front away for those who want to tip seems like the worst possible approach. That is why the STAR system is failing and it's why entertainers are just using Facebook as a free mechanism for promoting the Patreon accounts."

Not a long or a short but suprised this only went down 0.5 percent on the news that Facebook censored Australian news because it disagrees with a bill Australia passed

Let me share a great piece of advice I learned from Warren Buffet. He has shared many a sage wisdom in his interviews over the years but this little snippet has done me more good and made me more money than anything else. And it is simply “tune out the noise”. When you buy a stalwart like FB and have conviction in the company and MZ then buy it and tune out the noise. Because this stock is going to continue to go up and you don’t want to be left behind kicking yourself over why did you sell. Better advice you won’t receive. Do with it as you please. No charge :))
Selling!

"Buy Facebook For Its Value And Growth, Sell Snap....- Facebook has achieved strong, stable growth over the past few years, and that is likely to continue as active users and ARPU keep increasing.-The combination of low multiples and strong future cash flows make Facebook undervalued.-Snap has rallied over 255% over the last year as investors have been bullish on the company's growth prospects.Due to the lack of loyalty surrounding Snap's target age demographic, Snap could have trouble growing at the same rate.-Facebook's Instagram has similar, if not better, growth potential than Snap due to its monetization and wide audience.Ready for FB to make my account another 20-30K by December 2021..."

"Nice move in pre-market (Up $5.00+). Going forward, a lot of the stock market's success will hinge on several policies put in place by the new administration. Key for FB is the 230 exemption and if hearings are eventually heard on the censorship issue that has not gotten favorable press from either side. Gotta face it, conservative or liberal, we all want our voice heard when we have something to say."
"Left or Right, censorship people voice is completely WRONG!!!! We are in America , not in China or N. Korea...."

"Doing security and privacy for a living, I do not see any need to be concerned about using Whatsapp more than using a web browser. Everyone is collecting data from every site. So they know everything they need to know from other means. Every website today is instrumented with beacons and they know what you are viewing, clicking - who your friends are - demography, socio-political inclinations, everything. They can even predict very very accurately what your credit score is etc...Unless somone is using whatsapp ( assuming it is end to end encrypted) to do something nefarious with criminal intend they dont have to be worried. That's my 2 cents."
FB is on the wrong side of history and shareholders and management are going to pay dearly...

"Explain how this works. I was on Pinterest looking at bar stools for our newly remodeled kitchen and discussing the topic and choices with my daughter. We both have iPhones. My daughter never opened up her Pinterest app, but instead went to FB on her phone. An add immediately popped up on her phone for barstools. I do not have a FB account and never have had one. So how does this work. Is there a method for the phone to pick up verbal communication or since she’s in my contact list does her FB somehow attach to my phone????"

"A Sneak Peek at the Apple Feature That Keeps Facebook Up at NightOf all the privacy-preserving goodies Apple promised to roll into the iOS 14 update, its so called “Tracking Transparency” alerts were probably the most controversial, stirring up enough pushback from fellow tech giant Facebook that the feature ended up being delayed past its original autumn deadline.Now it’s looking like Apple’s waited long enough. A user with beta access to the upcoming iOS 14.4 update shared a screenshot on a MacRumors’ forum showing the NBA official app asking to track their activity across non-NBA apps and websites. In the customizable fine print that accompanies these tracking prompts, the NBA’s app notes that it’ll use this data to offer “a better and personalized ad experience”—whatever that means.Per MacRumors, it also looks like some folks using older versions of iOS 14 have also started getting these alerts on particular apps, albeit “rather inconsistently.”To briefly recap, the idea of Apple’s so-called “AppTrackingTransparency framework”—or just ATT for short—is to give users control over the amount of data that the apps on their phones are allowed to hoover up. Arguably, the juiciest piece of data that users are getting control over with the update would be their phone’s advertising identifier, or IDFA. We’ve covered the IDFA in depth before, but in a nutshell, it’s a string of characters that identifies your specific phone across all of the apps that you use. Being able to access this particular ID doesn’t only allow advertisers to track you from app to app, but in tons of other ways as well.Naturally, most advertisers were a bit peeved at the idea that Apple would be siphoning off their data supply. And the face of this peeved party, ironically enough, was Facebook. We’ve mentioned before that outside of Instagram, WhatsApp, and its flagship blue app, Facebook also has an external “advertising network” that siphons off tidbits of consumer’s phone data through non-Facebook apps in order to let those app’s users get retargeted across Facebook’s myriad platforms. Losing access to the IDFA, in particular, means that this Ad Network is losing a ton of valuable consumer data, which means Facebook, in turn, is losing ad dollars that were historically used to target that data.That said, I think we can all agree that as far as companies go, Facebook isn’t really the most sympathetic player. This is probably why its tactic over the past few months has been hamfistedly telling us that the ATT update has the potential to cripple the small businesses that rely on its ad platform for their day-to-day work. Since August, we’ve seen this message rolled out on press calls, corporate blog posts, and—as of last week—two full-page newspaper ads.Facebook, for its part, is kind of fuzzy on how small businesses will be impacted (besides some vague definition of badly). Now that there’s actual details coming out about what ATT entails, it’s looking like even Facebook’s own advertisers aren’t too worried about the actual impact that’s coming down the pike."

How much money is Blackberry going to get from Facebook?
FB today reminds me of TGT a few years ago with the consecutive data breach and bathroom scandals. Countless keyword warriors swore to never shop there again and it would go bankrupt as a result.Look at TGT now.FB still makes money hand over fist because it's an extremely efficient way to advertise online. There's no better. FB becomes even more important in an ad buy as old school TV audiences continues to fragment due to streaming alternatives.Short term noise does equate to long term success.
"Bulls are running ""Hogs wild"" all over FB, and they'll be doing it ""all day long"" -- into next month!- BUY with both hands!"
Sheryl Sandberg delivered a brilliant explanation of Facebook’s data usage: Advertising and protecting people's information are not at odds. They do both. Targeted ads that respect people's privacy are better ads. They show people things that they're more likely to be interested in. People want to see ads that are relevant to them. Over 80 million small businesses advertise and connect with customers through Facebook.
"to all the ""buy back"" disciples around here... that's all FB can do with their existing pile of benjamins... their acquisition days are gone... the problem with buy-backs is they do nothing for your long term competitiveness, innovation or growth... they simply reduce the denominator ...The street will not pay one iota for buy backs in FB's arena... when you got Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon starring you in the face... fewer shares is not much of a weapon. Twitter and Snap are just laying around like vultures... they, themselves, are not much a threat... they are not the problem... they will, however, provide fodder to expose FB's disregard for privacy and integrity... One more time...FB is not sliding towards extinction... but it ain't worth $270/share...sorry longs."

"Zuckerberg bribed the Australian government officials without success Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has lobbied senior federal ministers about the proposed code forcing the digital giants to pay media companies, and the prime minister has engaged with Microsoft amid threats from Google about removing its search engine from Australia.With a lobbying offensive in overdrive with Labor expected to endorse the Morrison government’s code after a shadow cabinet meeting this week, and with a Senate inquiry continuing to hear from stakeholders – the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, confirmed the conversation with Zuckerberg on Sunday.Facebook has branded the proposed code unworkable in its current form, and has asked for digital platforms to be given six months’ grace to negotiate deals with news companies directly before being hit with mandatory regulations.Frydenberg told the ABC his discussion with Zuckerberg had been constructive, but the tech mogul had not convinced the Australian government to back down.With parliament set to resume for 2021, the platforms have engaged politically connected lobbyists and are pulling out all stops to try to scale back or scuttle the proposal.Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia and Facebook has warned it will remove news from its feed for all Australian users if the code proceeds.As well as confirming the high-level approach from Facebook, Frydenberg also revealed on Sunday that Scott Morrison had spoken to Microsoft, which operates a rival search engine to Google.He said Microsoft was “watching this very closely” and was “mulling expansion opportunities in Australia”.The government remained “in detailed discussions with Google, with Facebook, with the other players across the industry” – discussions that had been under way for some time.Australia’s major media players, hit by technological disruption and by the economic shock associated with Covid-19, have also lobbied extensively for fairer commercial arrangements with the platforms.The proposed code – a world first – aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants.Google and Facebook would have to pay for displaying news content and provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic – such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. If they failed to comply, they could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.The proposal was developed by Australia’s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Although Labor supports the code in principle, its communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said last week that the government needed to be clear with internet users and businesses what Google’s threatened departure from Australia – if that eventuated – would mean in practical terms.Frydenberg said on Sunday he didn’t “dismiss the threats” but “I’m not intimidated by them either”.The code was “the product of an 18-month inquiry, world-leading inquiry, by the ACCC, and at every step of the way, these businesses have been consulted”.As the process went on, the story from the platforms appeared to be changing: “The goalposts seem to be shifting because originally they had a concern with the algorithm requirements of notification, then it was about value exchange and then it was about a final arbitration model.“Now we’re told that if we go ahead with this, we’re going to break the internet.”Frydenberg said the government’s view was it was clear current practices had to change: “What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.”"
great short opportunity
When Must/Trump build the new platform all key employees from FB/TWTR/AMZN/GOOG will jump ships just like folks left INTC for EVGO. INTC is now dying!
Facebook is being sued for “losing control” of the data of around one million users in England and Wales.
Get ready to go under $120
Bought at $32. Holding until $400. Selling half at that point and holding the rest long term. There will be ups and downs from now to $400. Hold and prosper.
Nice to see FB fined 650 million....more to come.
glad I sold this turd a while back in the 270's. Will be leaving FB and moving to GAB. Censorship is un-American. Ask every person who escaped a communist country what they think of the lefts attack and free speech and gun ownership. They will tell you its the exact thing that happened to them before the tyrants took power. Do your own research people this is for real.
$300 before earnings
This is one of the most undervalued stocks in this market currently. The valuation is an absolute joke with their growth. Unreal

"Nobody should have the right to ban speech in America, no matter what political party you affiliate with. It is this expression that distinguishes America from other countries and fosters new ideas and dialogue. I hope the stock price drops significantly because this will be the only way for the managers at twitter to feel the repercussion."
"The gains are generally sold off...if not the next day, the few days after a nice pop. Not sure why this was down close to $5 on up markets. All big tech didn’t participate today. The shining star was TSLA. Up almost $30."

hopefully Zuckerberg put in at.the end of earning plugs a 25 billion stock buy back
"Not looking good in pre-market (-$3.01). Probably gonna see the pps challenge the $250 barrier at some point this week (Thanks, Zuck!). Anyway, with all the bad press hovering over the company, any thoughts of FB hitting those $350-and-above targets is foolhardy under current conditions. Gotta face the facts, FB (Zuck et al) has ticked off too many people across way too many spectrums of involvement. Stock most likely trades sideways until 1Q 2021 numbers are announced. FB just not receiving a lot of love."
How FB shareholders roll.

"While much has been said about Facebook's slowing growth, one thing that should not be overlooked is its awe-inspiring scale. With more than 1.5 billion people using Facebook every day and 2.5 billion using its apps every month, the company's reach is incredible. Moreover, its daily and monthly active users both grew 11% year over year, so this is not a declining business......stay...LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Thanks Facebook for encouraging me to seek out and ultimately subscribe to your competitors. They are much safer and better. Way to blow a golden global opportunity. The moat you enjoyed now has alligators in it. I reduced my large position in FB to minimal at best. Bye

BLM rioted and looted for months while the media claimed they were peaceful protesters. Now a one day protest about possible election fraud is the worst thing ever. Some pushing and few punches nothing set fire the only person harmed was a unarmed young white woman who was murdered by security forces. The media has already buried this story. No charges have been laid against the officer. She was not the right color or political affiliation for her life to matter. The communists have won.

As I said last night - this is OVER FOR FAKEBOOK - ZUCK played both sides of the fence and now the BIG DOGS are out of the house and coming at him and FAKEBOOK and his ruse is up. The stock will continue to erode and end of day a BIG DROP as this is not a single day event for them this is is transformational in the degree of negative impact. don't buy the dip it is a sinking ship. Boolean
This is no longer the same company. The environment has changed I don't care how big you are you can't fight the world governments. Zuck done Fd up. This will not end well. instead of being at the table FB is now on the outside as an enemy. It is time to trim IMO. GLTA.

Personal entry levels: 213.28 USD and 197.66 USD.Waiting on the sidelines. I like to buy things when they are cheap.For example: I bought a house for 15% under the market price of that time from an unemployed guy (who had to sell the house to avoid execution of the house); now the house is worth 40% more and I feel great about it.
No freedom on facebook.
"Fundamentals will always win. I'm glad the shorts made some $ because I never root for fellow small guys like me to lose money. BUt the fact IS that this is an iconic company that makes money at will, has relatively few employees and overhead, has an increasing customer base (yep) and has 70 billion in cash. This will bounce back to ATH with little difficulty."
FB is Toast. zuck is dumping because he knows his treasonous actions will destroy this sorry excuse for a legitimate company.

FB down 10 percent this month while the stock market is soaring.I hope you shareholders are going to sue Zuckerberg for alienating half his customer base for personal political reasons.Sounds like breach of fiduciary responsibility to me.
It's all in the earnings call now. Lets hope they remain positive. After hours is already starting to turn in anticipation
Next game changing FB $TWTR type game changing tech/science stock? ACRX received recent Orange Book patents on their recent FDA approved only RAPID & NON INVASIVE Acute Pain medication used in medical settings... NO MORE IV BOLUS needed.... all eyes on ACRX...

IF you still hold FAKEBOOK stock you must believe in Martians and VOODOO DUST. The entire guts of this company is now toast...ads are toast...users are leaving...advertisers are leaving....investors should be leaving....NO MARTIANS COMING TO FIX THIS... none.

Facebook since march lows is up 100%; the company did really well during this time and people communicated on the social media and ad revenue increased.What happens if there is suddenly a vaccin and people decide they spend enough time on Facebook?Things might have been priced in more than the underlying future business for months to come.
1000 shares at 245$ hold until earning this thing’s going explore to new high good luck traders
few things have given me joy in the past year as much as watching this company and stock slowly deteriorate

I hope FB and the twit that owns it loses everything. America doesn't censor.

Mark Zuckerburg cannot be trusted. Zuckerburg and his wife helped rig an election paying poll workers $20-$60 dollars an hour. He basically funded crime.

Poland and Eastern Europe had enough of Hitler.. They don’t need a Zuckerburg commie in their people’s minds! Short FB!

Zuck is Zucking up a good business by playing politics and trying to intimidate users.
"Anyone bearish on FB stock is a dummy.FB posted $10,20 EPS for the year, above the highest estimates.They are a money printing machine.Zuckerberg warns pretty much every quarter. He has made a habit of underpromisingand overdelivering quarter after quarter. Honestly look at their numbers without blind hatred and you'll see that there is no other company in the market today with this combination of an extremely high current level of profitability and growth as well as untapped future potential trading at this kind of valuation... The PE is now under 26 and people here think it should be lower?!!? Yes, there are political headwinds, but if you don't think FB will be able to sustain growth youare kidding yourself. There is no mass exodus, and people on both sides of the aisle continue to post their vitriol and will continue to do so because that's where the people are.In the short term anything can happen as we see now, but long term it's the easiest investment to buy and forget about."

Warning WhatsApp who belongs to Facebook isn't safe anymore WhatsApp announced that they will sell their users information from WhatsApp conversations to other companies for marketing reasons.They are exposing their users most private information which they don't want to share with everyone . therefore they are not trust worthy.

The problem is big business control the lawmakers the gov and judges....so what is left to ordinary Joe Block? Only pay taxes.
Now you all need to delete WhatsApp and download Signal. Fb lost millions of people on this platform too. The founder of Signal is the creator of WhatsApp and sold it to fb for 20billion. Upon leaving his employment with fb he urged everyone to delete their fb accounts due to invasion of privacy. Come on who really needs FB. Grow up! It’s a kids tool.

"Canada vows to be next country to go after Facebook to pay for newsOTTAWA, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Canada vowed on Thursday to makeFacebook Inc pay for news content, seeking allies in the media battle with tech giants and pledging not to back down if the social media platform shuts off the country's news as it didin Australia.Facebook blocked all Australian news content on its service over proposed legislation requiring it and Alphabet Inc's Googleto pay fees to Australian publishers for news links.Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, in charge of crafting similar legislation to be unveiled in coming months,condemned Facebook's action and said it would not deter Ottawa.""Canada is at the forefront of this battle ... we are reallyamong the first group of countries around the world that aredoing this,"" he told reporters.Last year, Canadian media organizations warned of apotential market failure without government action. They said the Australian approach would permit publishers to recover C$620million a year. Without action, they warned, Canada would lose 700 print journalism jobs out of 3,100 total.Guilbeault said Canada could adopt the Australian model, which requires Facebook and Google to reach deals to pay news outlets whose links drive activity on their services, or agreeon a price through binding arbitration.Another option is to follow the example of France, which requires large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content.""We are working to see which model would be the most appropriate,"" he said, adding he spoke last week to his French, Australian, German and Finnish counterparts about working together on ensuring fair compensation for web content.""I suspect that soon we will have five, 10, 15 countries adopting similar rules ... is Facebook going to cut ties withGermany, with France?"" he asked, saying that at some point Facebook's approach would become ""totally unsustainable"".University of Toronto professor Megan Boler, who specializesin social media, said the Facebook action marked a turning point which would require a common international approach.""We could actually see a coalition, a united front against this monopoly, which could be very powerful,"" she said in a phone interview."

"To all FB bulls... it's time you heed the warning signs on the horizon...- FB is not going to BUY their way into growth (their acquisition days are DONE)- the move towards greater privacy is a significant headwind- they've milked the USA ARPU about as far as it's gonna go- competition is closing in on all sides...and , again, they will not be allowed (dare i repeat it?) to ""buy out"" the innovation beating on their head- boomers are dying and the young gen dislike the core platform and the culture of Z- they WILL get regulated (and be very lucky if not forced to divest assets)I'm not saying the company will cease to exist or decay into a nothing co...but, the days of growth(as they have become accustomed to and is the base of their dna) are DONE.You're seeing it in the stock as we speak.

"Of course the price speaks for itself, and it is what it is. FB is tanking.But you could say the same of GME this morning. It was worth $468. And now it’s worth $225. GME isn’t worth $15 people no matter what the price says.People manipulate the market for their own purposes.FB share price is out of whack with reality right now.The price SHOULD be over $300, with $10.20 EPS in the last year, but who knows how low people can push it down.Stay long and you will be rewarded. This is an entry point for long term holders. For options holders, we all knew the risk and we need to bite the bullet."

"""Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him in so far as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth — whether about the President or about anyone else — save in the rare cases where this would make known to the enemy information of military value which would otherwise be unknown to him.""-Teddy Roosevelt, ""Lincoln and Free Speech"" essay"

"In August, 2018, FB stock was trading around $218. Here we are two-and-a-half years later, and the Dow up 50% since then, and FB shares are just $48 higher. Not exactly a high flying growth stock by that account despite quarter after quarter of excellent results from a business standpoint. So what's the problem? I say it's Zuck and his mouth and ill thought out policies. FB needs a new leader, and one who is a hundred times less controversial than Zuck. He ain't helping shareholders, and whether he likes it or not, shareholder value should be Priority #1 with him. Not his political agenda."

"Anger mounts as Facebook's Australia news ban sweeps up charities, government pagesSYDNEY (Reuters) - Dozens of Australian companies, charities and information providers reacted with anger on Thursday after being shut down by Facebook, imploring the social media giant to restore their pages as calls for users to delete the platform grew.Australians were blocked from accessing news in their Facebook feeds after an escalation of the proposed media bargaining code which would require the company and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms.But several charities and pages of official health, meteorology and emergency services were also blocked, along with smaller, niche content providers.Foodbank Australia, one of the many charities caught in the crossfire, said Facebook's response was ""unacceptable"".""Hours matter when you have nothing to eat. SORT THIS OUT!"" CEO Brianna Casey tweeted.Save the Children CEO Paul Ronalds said the charity had come to rely on the platform to communicate with supporters and members.""We also use Facebook as an important fundraising tool to reach generous supporters who want to support the world’s most vulnerable children,"" he said. ""Every minute that our page is down is another minute our message isn’t getting out about the needs of children.""Facebook had restored the government services pages by afternoon, but there were still small businesses and community groups who were left venting, with #facebooknewsban and #DeleteFacebook trending on microblogging site Twitter.Rachel Chappell who founded a Sydney-based community group 'North Shore Mums' nine years ago woke up to see her Facebook page with its 35,000 followers disappear.“We’re a mum’s website. We are small and niche. This is not fair,” said Chappell, who built up a small business for mothers, writing about family-friendly cafes and pets for the local community, and attracting advertising.""I think they are just bullies. They are shooting themselves in the foot. I spend my A$20,000 marketing budget to promote our content with Facebook,” said Chappell, adding the move had “completely shaken” her.Facebook's reach in Australia is powerful. It has more than 11 million users in a population of 25 million and takes in about 24% of the country's advertising spend, according to the competition regulator.A Facebook representative in Australia did not reply to a request for comment. A later Facebook statement said the ban should not affect government pages but ""as the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition"".""CUTE CATS AND CONSPIRACIES""Several organisations posted social media messages directing followers to their websites or other platforms including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram.Journalist Jelisa Apps said many rural areas and country towns relied on their local paper's Facebook pages as physical copies were stripped back over the years. Other social media platforms were not as widely used, she said.""I've just checked my hometown's newspaper page. It's gone. This is a real shame. An undervalued audience having their news further limited,"" Apps said on Twitter.Peter Lewis, director of the Australia Institute's Centre for Responsible Technology said Facebook's decision would make it a weaker social network.Facebook ""is destroying its social licence to operate,"" Lewis said.""Without fact-based news to anchor it, Facebook will become little more than a cute cats and conspiracy theories (page),"" he added.""If Facebook determines to treat Australians with such contempt, Australians should respond by ending its use of Facebook and using alternate ways to connect online."""

Top 2 5G stocks $AAPL & $TMUS
"How Democrats could end Wall Street's infatuation with Facebook, Amazon and GoogleBrace for it, tech bulls. Those investors who have been conditioned these past five years to only expect big tech stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to do one thing — go up, and go up huge — may be in for a wake-up call in coming quarters as the newly emboldened Democratic party looks to drop the regulatory hammer on these powerful giants.“We continue to anticipate that the regulatory overhang for mega-cap internet companies will continue in 2021 and see a breakup of Facebook to be most structurally concerning for investors given a difficult/expensive unwind and that separate Instagram and WhatsApp platforms would likely compete directly for usage and advertisers,” says BofA Securities tech analyst Justin Post.Post outlines numerous regulatory concerns for investors in Facebook, Amazon and Google, which could collectively weigh on the multiples the already expensive stocks trade on.“With the Democratic sweep, we see a slightly higher possibility for new legislation that: 1) establishes a Privacy Bill of Rights restricting the use of personal data; 2) re-defines market power in large tech; and, 3) regulates companies as digital utilities,” Post explains. “We also think the Democratic Party-led government will even more strongly support the DoJ [Department of Justice] and FTC [Federal Trade Commission] efforts to break-up Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. President-elect Biden’s decision to name Bruce Reed (helped craft the landmark 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act) as top technology advisor signals higher probability for the administration to adopt a regulatory agenda focused on consumer policy protection (similar to GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California).”Post adds the recent insurrection on Capitol Hill will likely renew calls among lawmakers to make social media platforms “more accountable” and also revoke Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.The end result of these would-be government actions on Facebook, Amazon and Google, Post argues, may be pressured sales, increased operating costs and outgoing cash flow to pay fines. More often than not, these are conditions for a stock price to lose value as investors recalculate the future of the underlying company.And the selling could become pronounced.Enthusiasm for big tech stocksFacebook, Amazon and Google remain the most owned three tech stocks among large cap active managers, according to Post’s research. In other words, these are some of the most crowded trades on Wall Street that may be unwound quickly as a the government sticks a pin in the big-cap tech bubble.Despite the growing regulatory risks (fueled in part by 38 U.S. state attorneys general in December signing an antitrust lawsuit against Google, as Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan details here) ushered in by the arrival of a Blue Wave in government, the stock prices of tech’s three most scrutinized names continue to be loved on Wall Street.All three stocks outperformed the S&P 500 (again) in 2020, paced by a 70% rise in Amazon as U.S. consumers relied heavily on the platform during the COVID-19 pandemic.But the enthusiasm for big-cap tech stocks — often seen through the prism of the FAANG complex [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google] — has waned to kick off 2021 perhaps because of the reality that new regulations from a Democratic-controlled government are coming.Shares of the FAANG stocks are all lower (Facebook is the worst performer, down 8.1%) year-to-date compared to the 1.1% gain for the S&P 500.Not helping sentiment on big-cap tech stocks right now is the specter of a new $1.9 trillion stimulus plan from the Biden administration. If enacted in any form, the stimulus could lead to a sizable rotation into cyclical sectors of the market from “safe-haven’ big-cap tech stocks.“The spending comes at an interesting junction for analysts and investors as it will no doubt mean further EPS upgrades. It will also mean that many early cycle S&P 500 sectors will see faster earnings revisions than the popular FAANG+ and IT which dominated investor attention in 2020,”"

"Google, Facebook agreed to team up against possible antitrust action, draft lawsuit says - WSJDec 22 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google agreed to ""cooperate and assist one another"" in case of an investigation into their pact to work together in online advertising, the Wall Street Journal reported late on Monday.The Journal report cited an unredacted version of a lawsuit filed by 10 states against Google last week.The states had accused Google of working with Facebook in an unlawful manner that violated antitrust law to boost its already-dominant online advertising business.According to the report, the lawsuit said that Google and Facebook were aware that their agreement could trigger antitrust investigations and discussed how to deal with them.A Google spokesperson told the Journal that such agreements over antitrust threats are extremely common.The unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which the Journal said it reviewed, also said that Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg signed the deal with Google.The draft version also cites an email in which Sandberg told Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and other executives that ""this is a big deal strategically,"" the report said."

Facecrook. Leadership very questionable . Zuckerberg not going anywhere but maybe better to step aside
"Hey Phillip Tell me why they are just doing this to FB? Why not TWTR, SNAP, PINTEREST, YELP, REDDIT, GOOG, etc.... You can’t single out one person or one company and discriminate no matter how much you dislike their behavior. You have to treat all of social media and tech companies the same across the board. What they are doing to FB is illegal. This tax has to be applied to all of those companies in the same manner. Now do you think this will have a chance in any Australian Court or any Court based on English Common Law???? Do you think all of these tech companies and I am sure some Australian tech companies will stand for this political nonsense PM of Australia is starting??? Give me a thumbs up if you agree!"
I can't laugh hard enough.. How all the longs are getting complacent and shouting $300 before earning
The earnings will be a fake flag to hide the many crimes of Zuck and his followers.

"It's amusing how the senators are demanding answers from Facebook, but, you never hear a word from them about the dozens and dozens of other companies, big and small, that have had very serious data breaches. The love to grandstand and try to show that they are doing such a great job of protecting their constituents. Because FB has such a high profile and everyone uses it, they center it out while ignoring every other case of privacy breaches. Vote them all out of office and put brand new people in their places. Voters need to keep doing that until elected officials realize that they aren't fooling anyone with their phoniness and are not going to continue to be elected until they do an honest job."

That deteriorating credibility gives him very little control over the blow back from local red-state politicians who loath his arrogance.

just sold ALL of my facebook before it tanks. I will not be a part of a company that censors ANYONE. facebook is a place where people should be able to express THEIR opinions to THEIR friends. FACEBOOK was never elected to shut down any ones opinion or 1st amendment right to give their opinion. I also have seen that facebook is lying about how many users they have since there are a lot of people that have multiple accounts because they lock people out and then their have been a lot of people that have left them and went to PARLOR where they are not censored but facebook still has them as an active account because we all know how hard it is to close your account. I hope you goto zero facebbook. you are not a company that deserves my support and I can see this is not just my opinion

"All three indexes in the red at 7:15 AM EST. Fridays can be goofy, especially during the final hour of trading. FB only off about a buck, so maybe today won't be so bad. Not expecting any miracle surges in the pps heading into the weekend. If the excellent earnings report didn't propel us into $280s or higher, I'm afraid we may be stuck where we are for the time being. Might be okay going forward so long as the pols don't beat up on us too much. However, you can count on the MSM, all of whom have taken big financial hits with lost ad revenue, to pile on unmercifully. Anything they can do to embellish and/or slant stories about censorship, privacy, monopoly and the other broadsides being aimed at FB to their own benefit, rest assured, they will do exactly that."
Short this stock. It serves no purpose. FB spreads hate and has shown how much they hate the President. No room for a company like this here. Maybe they should move to Cuba. I'm sure they will get away with the same thing there.

One day your frontal lobe will wake up and snap you back to reality if you haven't completely destroyed it thanks to all that legal MJ your ""government"" wants you to have."
Doomsday yesterday and now everyone flocking to buyJust look at the volumeThis will get a parabolic close
"I hope this stock goes to negative $.It would be what I call ""social justice""."
So undervalued. Even at $300 it would be undervalued.

Could FB spin Instagram this year?
"FB going after a trading group is a black eye on top of a black eye from their political censoring, pretty soon, no one will be able to use FB... people WILL find other Apps/SM to use."
ALL APPS FACEBOOK OWNS ARE DOWN!!!! FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM WHATSAPP FACEBOOK MESSENGER!!!
So if I start a fb account and write stop the steal it will be taken down? I may have to try that and see
"In my opinion, this company has serious issues. While I totally understand that companies may hit road blocks from time to time, this company seems to hit a road block every other week. To me, that's indicative of management not making the right moves. I won't place the blame on any one individual, but clearly something is very wrong and Facebook needs to do a true and unbiased evaluation of their management and internal operations. All of this is quite unfortunate as the company arguably has the best balance sheet of any public company on the planet, but it's not reflected in the stock price due to various issues that seemingly aren't being handled correctly. I hope Facebook can turn things around and get back to on the path to greatness, but to me, things are very questionable right now."
"I never invested in FB but I also probably never will, don’t agree with censorship no matter what you beliefs are or who you voted for ... Down with FB , Twitter , google and Apple for all that I care .."
"My FBJan 15 2021 257.5 Put went from $1.30 to $8! Thanks Zuck! Made 6x my money, in less than a week."
"Cnbc is supposed to be a business channel.. if i wanted to hear sermons, I d watch televangelist tv"
"I've held my entire position the whole time for three main reasons: 1) There's no real alternative to Facebook; 2) They're led by and hire the best and brightest minds of nearly any public company; and 3) Their balance sheet is excellent. For those three reasons, I'm confident that Facebook will get past this and continue to move forward."
"FB, together with Instagram and Messenger do not have a strong competitor presently - this is simply the reality. Twitter and LinkedIn serve completely different purposes and no one uses Google+. I believe FB is demonstrating that they are trying to address the issues and the people will continue to use them, while the company bring robust profits through new business models, which do not necessarily have to be growth-based. How much more should they grow???"
Will FB head to new highs? I believe so. Momentum appears to be in the stock and nothing appears in its way. FB will shatter earnings again. Just a matter of this week or next before 200
"FB PING - PONG,$255.00 TO $265.00GOING NOWHERE FASTWHAT A PIECE OF CARP !!!!"
"I will keep accumulating down to 200. If it goes lower than 200, I will buy even more "

I love FB and the haters I have seen them crush earnings and go down 15 bucks.... what a recovery lol I mean damnnn so proud.. let’s go green lol
Maybe no $300. Many calls going to get wiped out.
"Back to 250. Why? No reason, just manipulation."
Facebook due for correction. 277 too high.  Dinosaur company seen its days. No one under 40 uses Facebook. Strong sell imho.
Let’s get back our American gd rights to sue FB
Keep buying at these levels. It’s funny once we get some momentum and hit 300 people will be jumping in but they are scared to buy now at lower levels. Weird but I’ll take the discounted shares.
I just heard that a major church has told all of it's members to cancel their FB. This represents like 16 MILLION members.They are going to delete accounts tomorrow.
"Oh poor markZuckerberg crying over aapl being one of its biggest competitors and is crying about appl policies. Keep it up marky book .,, I hope aapl takes you off of their App Store"
We can not allow this punk kid at facebook Zuckerberg to decide which Americans have free speech on their platform and which Americans do not determined by whether their posts agree with his socialist agenda or not.
"Great first day of F8! News everywhere. Once Apple earnings are positive, FB will respond. $200 by Friday is still my prediction!"
That was fun.... Any predictions how long she will go?

Good news Fb will split the stock- research
Karma is a real thing... we will see a slow & steady decline. We will see next generation social media platforms over the next few years - exciting stuff. Fraud & privacy of personal data concerns at the forefront of this movement.
Up over 2% on a red day. Hopefully this is the start of an uptrend for Facebook.
"Europe Publishers Turn Up Heat on Facebook After Australia Spat(Bloomberg) -- News publishers are urging the European Union to copy parts of a proposed law in Australia that would force Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay an agreed price for their content.The publishers want EU lawmakers to force the tech giants into binding arbitration if they can’t agree on payments for snippets of articles shown on the platforms. They want a clause inserted in legislation proposed in December to rein in the big tech firms, known as the Digital Markets Act.The industry sees an opportunity to press its case after Facebook imposed a news sharing blackout in response to Australia’s legislative move in an unprecedented show of strength. Publishers have hemorrhaged advertising revenue to digital platforms for decades.“It has become clear that without the full force of an Australian style approach, gatekeeper tech companies threaten to walk away from negotiations or exit markets entirely,” said Angela Mills Wade, executive director of the European Publishers Council, which represents publishers including Axel Springer and The New York Times. She said the EPC would support European lawmakers seeking to ensure that platforms negotiate in good faith.The EU already agreed a separate copyright law to help publishers seek compensation from the platforms, after years of negotiations involving industry, officials and lawmakers. Andreas Schwab, the lead lawmaker in charge of the DMA, said the copyright law protects people’s ability to share content while supporting quality journalism online.For some publishers, the rules still don’t go far enough. France is one of the only countries so far to apply the copyright law, but its competition authority had to step in last year to force Google to pay for displaying news.When France rolled out the law, Google started showing stripped-down French news search results that didn’t include previews of the articles. The search giant eventually reached a deal in January with a French publishers’ union that it will negotiate individual license agreements.The tech giants are still finding ways to “wriggle out” of their obligations to publishers even with the EU copyright rules in place, said Wout van Wijk, executive director of News Media Europe, an umbrella organization representing national publisher associations.“We would welcome a clause that mandates binding arbitration,” he said."

"PALO ALTO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc may face questions about fallout from U.S. election controversies when it posts earnings on Wednesday, but top of mind for investors is a less political matter: the company's heavy bet on e-commerce to drive ad sales.The world's biggest social media company is poised to reap a windfall from that gambit, analysts say, bolstered by a return in ad growth rates to pre-COVID levels and a holiday shopping boost from its new ""social commerce"" features.Wall Street expects the company to report fourth-quarter sales up 25% to $26.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Driving those gains were a coronavirus-era shift away from physical stores and the unequal impact of the pandemic on low-income populations, which left others with ""flush household balance sheets,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note."
So glad I sold fakebook and bought other opportunities with a future. Suckerberg has alienated a significant portion of FB's user based and the business will/is suffering.
"I struggle to believe that the market did not comprehend their ER. This is manipulation. DO NOT SELL. HOLD. For a company producing these numbers and such huge beats, it should be up far more than it is. An absolute gift at these levels. Biggest bargain in the market. Buy, buy, buy!"

Biotech Stocks Under $1. For Details (http://under.1dollar-stox.online)
FB = deleted from my social media world. I deleted everything from that #$%$ company.
"Yahoo keeps deleting my post when I mention the Pres., this happening to anyone else?"
We are bouncing around at the bottom folks!- FB will bounce strongly off a solidly formed base!!!-
Shorts getting greedy
Don’t be surprised if FB rebounds to positive territory with so many “weak hands and skittish investors” being pruned from the playing field — resulting in a solid as a rock FB base formation.*** Lest you forget: by definition stocks tend to bounce off solidly formed bases!
"all these emotional investors/traders tripping on a handful of people canceling their FB account. The same people that barely ever buy anything advertised on FB, never click on anything, etc. Good riddance. From an investor perspective, I'll stick with FB as I have for years. The stock is CHEAP."
"FB is now a chinese company. Sell, Sell, Sell, ...I dump all my FB stock for a long time."
SHUT DOWN FAKEBOOK...it has not value and has hurt so many people. ADVERTISERS LEAVE NOW. This is a cesspool. Boolean
"If past is prologue, today's drop to $246.37 probably represents the bottom of this down-cycle. The last time FB dropped to the mid $240s nearly four months ago, on Sep 21st. At that time, it bottomed out at $244.13. The next day (Sep 22), it rebounded to the $255 level, which is where it peaked today. And seven trading days after that (Oct 1), the share price reached $268.33 (a +10% increase from its Sep 21 low of $244.13). Later that month, on Oct 26, it peaked at $285.23 (a +16.8% increase in one calendar month). Just eight trading days after that (Nov 5), it peaked at $297.38 (a +21.8% increase from the Sep 21 low)."
"This stock should be trading $100 higher in the $360-370 range, and yet it continues to struggle to rise above the $270 price point. The disdain for and distrust of the company, which translates into the distaste for the company leadership, is weighing down the share price and is contributing to its massive volatility.As a shareholder, I’m disgusted with the massive loss of shareholder value and the gut-wrenching volatility; I want to see a new management team that can restore public trust, win back public sentiment, and lead the company forward with integrity, innovation, and profitability."
"I was watching a CNBC story where Maryland wants to tax tech on their advertising revenue. I was thinking: what if you gave away a free newspaper and the state came in and taxed you because you had ads? The senator himself said that tech was such a big part of his state's education, but I guess he neglected to realize that those services are mainly free and the ads fund the companies"
"We are people who love freedom and peace. Let's stand up and crush those (The swamp of parliament, Media, and Bigtech) who have colluded corruption and sold this country to China."
"Dow up almost 600 points and FB up less than a buck (0.78 as I type)! So much for blow out Q42020 earnings sending the pps to $300. As has been in the case in the past, Zuck's guidance wasn't exactly a heart pumping endorsement.Dunno. maybe he does that on purpose to temper the Street's estimates of future revenues and earnings because he knows he'll probably beat them next reporting period? Anyway, happy we're off yesterday's post-market lows, but truth be told, was expecting better."
I was wondering when some of these alternative platforms were gonna get caught in the crosshairs of the powers that be.
"The PE for Facebook, a company typically categorized as a growth company, is 29. Compare that to the PEs of similar growth-oriented companies:Apple 40Amazon 93Google 35Netflix 88Nvidia 89It’s painful to witness and admit, but Facebook is sold at quite a discount compared to its peers. Why? In my honest opinion, it’s attributable to the distrust of the management team and a lack of confidence in their growth story. When’s the last time you heard someone from Facebook talk bullishly about their growth strategy? I am imploring other Facebook shareholders to join me in demanding the resignations of Zuckerberg and Sandberg so we can achieve full market value of the share price."
meanwhile back at headquarters mark and crew are shredding everything!
$NFLX $FB $WIMI hopefully we go strong in the morning...
Apple is offering transparency for the iPhone user. That’s it. 100% about letting people know what’s happening with their data and they can choose how they want their data to be used. That’s great for everyone. What possible argument can Zuckerberg have? He looks bad.
"They stole a election (or parts thereof) They covered it up. They then silenced anyone who objected to it. And you're buying their stock? The whole world longs for freedom, and you're selling in for peanuts."
"Has anybody noticed how many shares Zuckerburg has sold since November? Interesting isn't it, follow the money. This thing is heading lower."

"Wow, check out Netflix’s price action yesterday - up nearly 17% to $586 after positive fourth quarter results; it’s now trading at 96 times earnings. Maybe Facebook should change its name to Faceflix and perhaps it would trade around $810/share. Why the disparity in how these two stocks trade? It’s all about public sentiment, and public sentiment is everything. In the words of Abraham Lincoln: “Public sentiment is everything. With it, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.” Zuckerberg and Sandberg no longer have public sentiment in their favor, and it’s unlikely they can succeed without it. Now is the time for shareholders to push for a change: Zuckerberg and Sandberg must go!"

"Might get some buying in the AM as bargain hunters buy the dip. However, I think by the close we'll be hoping to end the week above $250. I think we will finish at $250 or higher, but after all those glamorous target prices were announced, I was hoping for much better than a $250ish pps."

"FB just censored Kevin Sorbo, best known as Hercules on TV and in the movies. Why? Because Sorbo is a conservative and doesn't agree with Zuck's liberal policies and friends. I wonder who is gonna be next? Maybe it will be you or me! The over-the-top hubris being exhibited by Zuck just males that target on his back bigger and easier to hit. The downside for shareholders is the fact the we suffer every time this sort of nonsense makes headlines."
FB is reaching $300 after some consolidation. Fantastic earnings engine so time to load up.
I would get rid of this stock. They won't be going up with all the court battles. Kevin Sorbo was blocked today. Its ok to disagree with anyone but you can't remove someone because you do. This is America.

"Market is gonna hold this down to shake out the short term options positions. Flat is good for the writers of the options as both call and put holders lose with the deterioration of time value which rapidly happens after an earnings release and reduction in the volatility premium. If you are long shares, you are golden as this will start to rise in a week or so after most of the value of the options has been captured.Clearly the latest quarterly report shows this is a $350+ company and funds will accumulate once the dust clears and some optics holders take their losses.This is self evident and anything else is just noise."
Back to 300 within few weeks

Facebook is down 4.90% to 268.22

As much as I would love to see all these big tech companies fail. The fact is I highly doubt this is a permanent injury to these companies. When Nike backed blm everyone was saying the same thing. Nike did crash short term but has recovered since.

MZ has no clue how big the GOP is. He'll figure it out.
This valuation is just silly. It’s trading under the PE ratio of the S&P 500 and has more than 3x the growth as most of the companies in it. This should be valued at $350/share. I believe the negativity around Facebook will die down and eventually pass with the new party coming in. I think we will see this valued where it should be as a growth and revenue beast.

"Booyah !!! ""Time Spent on Social Media and Messaging Apps Is Also Still GrowingTime spent on social media and ""communications"" apps is believed to have risen 35% from 2016 to 2018, and is estimated to have accounted for 50% of total time spent on apps last year. And outside of China, Facebook's (FB) various apps, reported by the company to collectively have over 2.6 billion monthly active users (MAUs), continue accounting for a giant portion of this activity.Among social and communications apps, Facebook Messenger, core Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ranked No. 1, 2, 4 and 5 in terms of downloads last year, respectively. Notably, WhatsApp, which Facebook is just beginning to monetize, surpassed the core Facebook app in terms of MAUs towards the end of 2018.WhatsApp is now Facebook's most popular app, according to App Annie.WhatsApp was also reported to be the most popular social and communications app among Android users in several major foreign markets. However, it didn't crack the top-five in the U.S., where Facebook Messenger and Snapchat are both widely used on Android (on iOS, Apple's iMessage is of course also quite popular."""

"Ok ignorantes — Freedom of Speech is subject to limits when speech is used to harm fellow human beings. “The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries ""special duties and responsibilities"" and may ""therefore be subject to certain restrictions"" when necessary ""[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others"" or ""[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals"".[3]Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that ""the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."""
STRAIGHT FROM BARRONS Facebook’s Earnings Could Be a Reset for the Stock. Why It Could Move Higher From Here. GOING TO 350.00
Bought another 500 shares earlier
"Disappointed in FB's pps the past few years. TWTR has tripled over that time while SNAP has gone up almost tenfold. True, those who have been in FB since the early days and have never sold are pleased. But those buying into FB at much higher prices must feel like there's a party happening on Wall Street but FB didn't get an invite. Hard to knock Zuck given what he's built over a dozen years or thereabouts, however I believe FB needs a new and more appealing face of the company than Zuck. He doesn't come off as very likeable (Don't underestimate the value of being likeable.), and his recent decisions (e.g. ideology specific censoring) have further hurt FB's image. To wit, time for him to step down."
Zuckerberg knows this is going up and who cares if he sold some shares but now hes buying back billions Hes helping his company

"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."

Public sentiment is not with this management team; until there is a change the price will continue to languish at a massive discount to its peers. Zuckerberg and Sandberg must go!"

"Is interesting to read these perspectives. Last year during the pandemic, Fb helped promote small business and impede debt business. Not that they don’t have privacy issues. It’s a HUGE deals.

All the internet companies need rules to follow."

If he makes FB a better product then in the long run people will keep using it. It sounds like many people here would like him to just add more and more ads so the revenue goes up. Well let me tell ya that is what myspace did and NOONE uses it now. It is still up. Just go to any myspace page. 85% of the page is covered with ads and they have 20 active users. There is always going to be a balance. What Z could do is stop talking. He could have changed the algorithm quietly and no one would have none about it.

Seems like all the pro Trumpers boycotting FB failed to accomplish their mission to drive the stock price into the ground. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to buy in the 250s you all messed up by selling your shares. You stuck to your morals instead of making money.

get this baby under 200 I didn't get enough... 100 shares at $172.45
I think this is historically one of the cheapest P/E ratios for FB. WhatsApp and other assets aren’t just going away. FB’s better days are not behind it.
Bye bye fb. Deleted.
OMG OMG OMG FB stock down BIG TIME after terrible earnings and guidance- GET OUT NOW LONGS!!!! SELL it all fast and cheap

"There’s about to be some BIG CHANGES coming down the pike for not only Twitter but $FB as well. These online platforms, along with others, have PROFITED off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of MISINFORMATION among Americans that has caused HATE AND DIVISION within our country. They’re platforms are being used as tools to organize MASS RIOTS all over the US. I’ve been against FB and Twitter from the very beginning. It was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be SHUTDOWN. There is very little, if anything, “social” about them."
Anyone really think that even this yahoo board will be around much longer ?

"All in all the whole of markets are over bloated especially with much liquidity in and in dangerous territories, over priced and no longer going on shares earnings per pricing fundamentals,most whole of markets are going on popularity favoritism based shares,most fund managers and people are not doing there DD or home work and keep advising people to keep investing in a over illed priced dangerous market, hence just waiting to collapse,there is signs of a terrible market crash on the looming horrizon.The trouble with those signs is that while they are very obvious with the benefit of hindsight, they aren’t so easy to see in real time.In 1929, JFK’s father Joseph Kennedy Sr. picked up on one of those subtle signs and didn’t just get out at the top, he scored a massive windfall on the way down as well,yes he was one of those few who did not loose all his money back in the devastating 1929`s horrible crash,how did he know you ask..by sitting in a shoe shine chair having his shoes shined ...and yes it was the shoe shine boys advise that made him think drastically,this all very simple sign most people do not care to believe in or digest,however has always been proven strongly true with time over time,once again it seems it will pronouce it`s coming more over soon."

You will regret selling Facebook at a 27 P/E ratio. Extremely cheap here for a company that’s growing the top line.

Social media has truely deviated from their origanl platform focus. Too bad. They could have been a great tool to help our country come together. All of them have done nothing but to help tear our great country to pieces. As history shows us time and again the U.S.A is in the final stages of losing its leading place on the world stage.
The World needs to show Suckerburg what it feels about Censorship!BURY this Company! Disclaimer: I no longer have a position in Facebook
These companies these companies are getting ready to take a big loss because of political leanings which is not what companies are supposed to do. can you imagine the shareholder class action lawsuits that are about to come? They will be massive.
Can you imagine FB with just liberals and Democrats in it? It would be the modern-day clan meeting...

By getting political instead of being a social media site not to mention communist they have defrauded their investors. time for class action by investors for lack of disclosure and sue Zuckerberg personally for this Madoff scam.
i see zero support here for fb
There goes mark Zuckerberg.
Down $20 tomorrow

Just a matter of time until FB is relaxed and irrelevant
"This selloff is silly, but I'll take it. Facebook is a money-making machine. After its earnings report later this month, it should be trading up in the $280s and $290s again, if not $300."
I believe it will reach all time high again before earning on May 1st.

Say goodbye to your profits.
This will be a huge week for Facebook and tech stocks as a whole. Earnings could make or break it. Beating earnings could easily push us passed 225 by end of week.

remember all those people who thought that fb is over because of what it did? it looks like you arent that many after all.
This is an unintelligent board. Just buy FB and hold then buy some more and keep holding

"Zuck might have stepped in quick sand by banning news from Australia. If he can ban Australia, the obvious response is for Australia to ban Facebook? Stock off almost $4 so far. Imagine what would happen if other countries band together in support of Australia and decide to block Facebook. Zuck may have dug himself a hole where escape is impossible. Don't even want to think about what would happen to the pps if anything close to that scenario occurred. It's one thing to ban an individual, but an entire country! Just underscores my long held position that Facebook needs a new face at its hem. Zuck doing way more harm than good lately."
"It’s very hard to hold FB with the lawsuits, the constant negative press, and the badmouthing by conservatives who think it’s got liberal minded censorship, which is actually far from the truth. The share price is also in horrible monthlong decline at the moment.. Despite all that, let’s look at the bottom line. They delivered $2.71 in the midst of pandemic, and show no signs of slowing down. Nothing has changed and they are in their strongest quarter historically with strong revenue from an extended presidential election and senate runoffs continuing. Oculus is now advertising, Instagram is firing on all cylinders, WhatsApp hasn’t even started to monetize, they are working on a new cryptocurrency, their marketplace is huge and gets no revenue yet, which is another potential Avenue for future incomes.They will easily report $3.50+ for the current quarter, bringing them to $10 EPS on the year...This means they are trading at under 27x earnings.. No other FAANG comes close to this value. This is a discounted price that won’t stay at these levels forever. Finance professionals will recognize the value, even with all the negative press, so look on this as a buying opportunity before they report the next quarter.Stay strong!"
Emmet says I am wrong about FAKEBOOK....well Emmet watch what is about to happen to FAKEBOOK...you all talk about the past I AM TALKING ABOUT THE PRESENT TO THE FUTURE and FAKEBOOK is not going to be the force it was -- this is GOING DOWN and you are going to see it all unfold before your rosy glasses.

almost 8 billion in earnings last quarter. sinking ship? i dont think so.
Ok let's pump FB back to $320 just like GME and AMC. Diamond hands!
Target $300 by Friday 
FB 190 before Wednesday.
"I'll never figure out what makes a stock go up or go down. Over the years, FB has come out with good earnings and, for whatever reason, the pps retreated. Lately, FB has received precious little love from the MSM, yet we've rallied from the high $240s to the mid-$270s over the past two weeks. Go figure!Anyway, hope the rise continues. The pps will probably get another boost upwards early next week because everyone is expecting earnings to be good to great. I guess the key will be what happens in the post-market after Zuck completes the conference call. GLA. On our way to $300 again IMHO."
"Call options are sold, now they need to bring the price down"
Don’t be a fool by selling. Don’t miss out like many of us did when we sold our $FB and $APPL and $TSLA way too early. Hold long and strong... ride the waves

FB's revenue in Asia, is shining, average revenue per user increasing at the alarming rate, thanks to the E-commerce in the region. Instagram is the golden goose that keeps laying golden eggs. By chart, FB still has room to hit 300 this time around after missing twice this year. THE CHART DOES NOT LIE."
I agree. Smart money will get burned . 401K investors added FB in their plan. So hedgies will fight who cover first eventually. You buy and accumulate....that's the key to wipe out hedgies and steal their prey by buying low. Don't sell but buy at pullback. 300 break is coming

To all of me fellow republicans and Trumpers. We have to buy FB TWTR GOOG in order to control the narrative. We should not be sellers. Buy as much as you can so that as shareholders and eventually board members we can control the narrative just like the Dems are doing that to us. Don't be fooled by selling your shares cheap to these traitors. If we all buy these companies then we can control the narrative on social medial and only then we can censor them like they are doing that to us. Remember there are about 2.5 billion people and businesses on FB INSTGRAM WHATSAPP and MESSANGER. Even if a few million republicans delete their accounts it wouldn't make the slightest difference for FB. We must ban together and buy the shares in all of these social media and tech companies in order to control on how they are being run.
Buckle up!

"It’s all about market share value. If Facebook was as trusted a company as Apple, it would be trading in the range of $340/share, given the Apple PE. Similarly, if the market had as much faith in the Facebook growth strategy as it does in Amazon’s, Facebook would be trading near $750/share. As a major Facebook shareholder, I am angered by the discount at which Facebook trades, and highly frustrated with the persistent share price volatility. For me, the time has come for a change in the company management team; they’ve had nearly three years since the Cambridge-Analytica debacle to improve public opinion of the company and they haven’t succeeded. Shareholders will never achieve maximum market share value if the current management team remains in place. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have become too toxic for the business, and I’m calling on all shareholders to rally with me and demand their resignations. A new team will help us achieve maximum shareholder value and help stabilize the share price. Zuckerberg and Sandberg must go!"
Say NO to totalitarianism. Say NO to Facebook and the unDemocratic Party.

"Let’s talk about CASH. Facebook closed out Q3, 2020 with over $55.5 billion in cash, or $19.5 per share. That’s a lot of cash and it seems appropriate to pay out some of that cash to shareholders in the form of a one-time dividend. Some might argue that doing so is foolish because Facebook is a “growth” company and needs the capital to expand the business; I would argue Facebook is priced as a “value” company by the market because of the pall of uncertainty that lingers over the company and the heightened scrutiny faced by the company. Given these constraints, it seems unlikely Facebook will be able to use the cash to make any significant purchases. 2021 is the year to maximize shareholder value; 2021 is the year to install a new management team."
It's heading down to 245 support.

"Will be interesting to see if FB can hold $250.00 today. Up slightly right now (+0.47) in pre-market, but was up more earlier. Would not be surprised if we have another red day, albeit not as bad as yesterday or the day before. With all the bad press we've gotten over the past two months, gotta pray Q4 2020 results blow the doors off of estimates for the pps to rally again. However, we won't know about that for two more weeks (1/27/21). In the meantime, let's hope Zuck doesn't do any more stupid things to hurt we shareholders. JMHO, but Zuck ought to lift the Parler ban today. That would help."

"Microsoft says U.S. should copy Australian law targeting Google and Facebook over news contentMicrosoft likes Australia’s plan to make Google and Facebook pay local publishers for content included in search results or news feeds so much that the company thinks the U.S. should adopt similar thinking.“The United States should not object to a creative Australian proposal that strengthens democracy by requiring tech companies to support a free press. It should copy it instead,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.Microsoft waded into the dispute down under earlier this month, when Google threatened to block its search engine in Australia over the proposed law, or “news media bargaining code,” as it’s called. Smith said at the time that Microsoft would never make such a threat.Facebook has also warned that it would consider blocking Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law passes.Smith used the occasion in his post to dive deeper on threats to democracy and journalism and the erosion of traditional news sources at the hands of the internet and social media. Microsoft also touted its MSN licensing agreements with 1,200 publishers worldwide, generating $1 billion in revenue for those publishers since 2014.“The legislation will redress the economic imbalance between technology and journalism by mandating negotiations between these tech gatekeepers and independent news organizations,” Smith said. “The goal is to provide the news organizations with compensation for the benefit derived by tech gatekeepers from the inclusion of news content on their platforms.”"

"Facebook will hit anywhere from 208.22 to 225.86 after earnings.. as long as the earnings are spectacular and zucky doesn't add any hot pepper afterward. I did a long term study on facebook movement, this stock usually go up anywhere from 18% to 28% after it found its bottom. Facebook found its bottom around 176.46 176.46 ( 18% to 28% upside ) puts facebook price in this range $208.22 to $225.86Keep in mind that if zuckerberg do decide to released the blockbuster mystery news, Facebook stock price could go much higher than $225.86Remember the 2015 bloodbath plunge during late december ? This bloodbath plunge is very similar to what we recently went thru.FB from 104.66 plummeted to 94.97 ( a disaster 9% plunge ) ... if you bought 94.97 ( u made 18% afterward )The price went back up after it bottomed out at 94.97.. from 94.97 skyrocketed to 112.21 ( u made 18% on gloom and doom)How much gloom and doom are u hearing now in Jan 2018 ?? ignore the b.s and load up on FBIf you want to calculate FACEBOOK recent bottom at 176.46 ( 18% ) means Facebook will hit $208.22(28% ) means Facebook will hit $225.86 180.00 this is the price FB spends the most..( 18% ) puts FB at $212.40( 28% ) puts FB at $230.40Remember the Final Outcome after Jan 31, 2018 really depends what Zuckerberg got to offer and what he's going to sayIf everything is good .. you should see the price above"

Zuck, whether he realizes it or not, doesn't come off as a real likeable guy. Toss in the recent censorship decision, and we can add ""cause"" to championing his demotion."

Australian government sounds like the real bully here. FB should do better job of letting the people of Australia understand the ramifications of what their government is trying to do. FB should be letting the Australian people know that due to new laws going into effect are causing FB to remove news information from its platform."

While the management team has worked hard to regain credibility and to burnish the firm’s reputation since the C-A debacle, they have failed. It is time to go! To wit, shareholders have experienced unprecedented stock price volatility and exorbitant penalties over the past three years ; and this price instability will NEVER subside until a new management team is installed. I am hoping other Facebook shareholders will join me in demanding a restructuring of the management team to restore the firm’s market credibility."

"Nice price increase for Twitter today, as Jack Dorsey came out with some bullish commentary about company growth prospects over the next few years. That’s what a GOOD CEO does for a company and its shareholders. Twitter pps was up over 12% today. Zuckerberg - where are your bullish comments about the growth prospects of your company?? Are you not able to grow it any further? Do you think shareholders like to hear the constant bashing of the company? Step up and do your job as CEO, or resign! Shareholders deserve better than your blather about first amendment rights; we want to know how you’re growing the company and how you’re going to increase the pps, because right now the share price is undervalued by $100 or more."

It's time to delete Facebook once forever.
"The Biggest Threat to Facebook Isn’t Apple, It’s Mark ZuckerbergThe CEO told analysts that Apple is one of its biggest competitors. That misses the point. During Facebook's earnings call, the company's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, made a point of talking about the risk Apple's upcoming iOS 14 changes pose to its business. Those changes will require apps to ask permission before they are able to track users across apps and the internet.For Facebook, a company whose entire business model is built on the ability to track users, collect their data, and then sell targeted ads based on all of that information, losing the ability to track users could be a real problem. The thing is, Apple isn't stopping any app from tracking any user. It's only requiring that apps ask permission first. The only way an app won't be able to track a user is if that user says ""please don't track me.""That seems pretty reasonable. If people don't want to be tracked online, it seems reasonable that apps shouldn't track them. Apple is just adding transparency to that interaction and allowing users the choice.Clearly, Facebook doesn't see it that way.“We increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors,"" Zuckerberg told analysts. ""Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do. They say they are doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests.""There is so much that we could unpack in that statement, but I want to highlight a couple of things. First, Zuckerberg is right, Apple is a competitor, but not in the way it thinks. Apple has a messaging product, but it isn't monetized. Apple doesn't show ads in Messages.Second, if Apple's goal is giving users a choice over how their data is used, what difference does the incentive make. If Apple is advantaged by respecting people's privacy and giving them a choice over whether and how their data is collected, I'm not sure that's quite the burn you think it is.Finally, It's hard to know how many different ways to say it, but if your business model is threatened by the idea that people will be given a choice as to whether you can track them, your problem isn't Apple. Your problem is your business model.For that matter, personalized advertising, which is just Facebook's nicer way of describing ads targeted based on your browsing history and activity, isn't a necessity for small businesses. Small businesses existed long before there was a massive social platform willing to take their money to show ads to its users.Sure, Facebook's version of advertising is more efficient, and maybe even more effective. But, even with Apple's proposed change, Facebook will still know where you live, how old you are, what your interests are because you tell it all of those things. For most small businesses, being able to target 25 to 30-year-old women that live within 20 miles of your salon isn't going to change.I'm also not so sure Facebook is actually worried about this particular change. The segment of its ad business that will be directly affected is quite small in comparison to its overall business. The real problem is that now everyone will be given a choice about whether to let Facebook track them, and the company logically assumes that most people will opt-out.And even if that doesn't have an immediate effect on its business, it does affect its brand. Suddenly people will be confronted with the reality that Facebook isn't free at all--it's just that most people weren't aware of the cost.Now they'll see a little popup that tells them that the cost is their personal information. Instead of facing that reality and making changes, Facebook has doubled down on the narrative that Apple is actually the bad guy here.That's why the biggest problem facing Facebook isn't Apple, it's Mark Zuckerberg.The smart move for Zuckerberg and Facebook would be to start with the idea that privacy is the given. If you can't build something that protects that, don't build it. I don't mean build things and then try to find a way to say it protects privacy, that's starting in the wrong position with the wrong motivation. It's why people don't trust Facebook.By the way, Zuckerberg isn't alone. Companies are full of leaders that can't see beyond the picture they have in their own mind of their good intentions.That's dangerous because it means they can't see the problems that everyone else sees. And that means they won't ever lead the way to a solution. You can't lead people where you aren't able to go. That's true for all of us."

"All accounts associated with the occupier of the WH must be shuttered. A twenty-four hour suspension is insufficient to address the calls for insurrection coming from the WH. This is no longer an issue of first amendment rights, but a clear and present danger to the future of our democracy. As a shareholder, I am calling on Zuckerberg and Sandberg to resign from their positions; a time for fresh leadership of this company is long overdue. Until change happens, the massive volatility associated with this stock price will never cease, and the company will continue to be disrespected."
"Facebook Knowingly Profited Off Junk Ad Efficacy Estimates, Lawsuit ClaimsFacebook, which along with Google accounts for around 60% of advertiser spending online, has knowingly built some of its astonishing success on incorrect data, newly unsealed court documents allege. Incidentally, this may pose a problem for a business which generates over 90% of its revenue from selling ads. In a nutshell, this class action suit, which was first filed back in 2018, alleges that Facebook massaged figures for “Potential Reach”—an estimate that Facebook gives its advertisers for the number of people that might see their ad—to goad advertisers into spending more money on the platform, all in the hopes of reaching the people that Facebook had promised. These filings detail that some of Facebook’s top brass, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, were fully aware that the company spent years exaggerating the number of eyeballs its advertisers could reach. As first reported by the Financial Times, the suit claims that when Facebook’s rank-and-file proposed internal fixes for these inflated figures, senior executives repeatedly brushed them off on the grounds that their solutions would cut into the company’s all-important ad revenue.Thanks to these unsealed filings, we know just how inflated some of those figures were. Here’s an example: in 2018, Facebook told its advertisers that it had a Potential Reach of 230 million adults across the U.S., out of the 250 million adults that were counted by U.S. census data that year. But according to a 2018 Pew Research study, only about 68% (or 170 million adults) actually use the platform at all. Sandberg acknowledged in an internal email that “she’d known about problems with Potential Reach for years.” But she repeatedly shot down employee’s attempts to rectify those figures, according to the filing.Internally, employees acknowledged that while the product billsitself as an estimate for how many “people” your ad might reach, it is, at best, an estimate for the number of accounts—including the untold numbers of fakes and duplicates. Some employees even ran the numbers in 2018, just to see what would happen if known duplicate accounts were cut out of Potential Reach, and saw a 10% drop in the numbers advertisers were given. Facebook chose not to cut them. When one of the product managers on the Potential Reach team later suggested tweaking the way they talked about these figures—like, say, replacing the word “people” with the word “accounts”—his suggestion was shot down over worries about the “significant” impact it might have on Facebook’s ad revenue. Per the suit, the manager responded that “it’s revenue we should have never made given the fact it’s based on wrong data.”In a lot of ways, this case mirrors another high-profile advertiser suit that hit the company in 2016 alleging Facebook knowingly withheld some serious problems with the metrics for its video ads for the sake of pulling down more money from those video ad partners. In 2019, Facebook settled the claim for a $40 million dollar sum that, as others have pointed out, is pretty much chump change to a company that earns tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue per year.And apparently, Facebook didn’t learn much from that slap on the wrist. When it comes to the ongoing problems with Potential Reach, the suit points out that numbers Facebook continues to give its advertisers make even less sense, like telling them it can reach “100 million” 18-to-34 year old’s across the country. Census data shows there’s in fact only 76 million of them—and we know not all of them use Facebook."

FB can pays for news feeds and simply increase add prices to make up the cost. Revenues will keep rising. The entire issue is overblown as it always becomes where FB is involved. You dont hear as much about Google's involvement yet they are in the same situation. FB is always being bashed while other companies fly under the radar and aren't targeted like FB. We need good news like a dividend or share split to really boost share price.

"Facebook Cuts Off News in Australia in Fight Over Payments(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. has started restricting the sharing of news on its service in Australia, defying a controversial proposed law that would require technology companies to pay publishers when their articles are posted by users.The ban constitutes the strongest action yet in response to the proposed legislation, which would force Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to pay publishers for the value their articles generate on the digital platforms. News outlets have demanded such payments, arguing they should be fairly compensated for their journalism as Google and Facebook capture much of the advertising market.Facebook’s decision blocks those in Australia from sharing news stories and stops users globally from sharing articles from Australian publishers. The action threatens to cut off one of the most widely used ways for people to access news and information online.It’s possible that Australia’s proposed law could set a precedent with other countries around the world that have watched Facebook and Google impact their respective news industries. While they oppose the measure in Australia, Google and Facebook have struck separate, voluntary agreements to pay publishers. Earlier Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., a supporter of the Australian proposal, said it had reached a deal with Google for the search giant to pay for journalism from the Wall Street Journal and its other newspapers.Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s Treasurer, tweeted that he had a “constructive discussion” with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday morning Australia time. “He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,” he wrote. A Facebook spokeswoman didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.Last summer, Facebook had threatened to block people and publishers in Australia from sharing news on its main social network and Instagram if the legislation were to become law. Google has similarly threatened to shut its search engine in Australia."

Down side of Zuck's side winning today is he'll have ticked off half the country. I, for one, wish Zuck would go hide out in FB's technology lab and not come out until he's a mature adult. JMHO, but were it not for Zuck's mouth, FB would be the darling of WS and selling for close to $400 per share."
