"30 years long in visa just dropping in to say hi, how’s everyone feeling about visa long term?"
Maybe get a good chance to add some.
138 by end of may. then sell. buy back late august
"If you get out of the market, where are you going to put your money, banks and make nothing? The only place to make any money is stocks and real estate. The market will not only go back up, it will surpass where we were before the panic. If you get out today, and the market goes back up over the next week, you'll have lost even more. You won't see Warren Buffet selling anything. In fact he is now buying. Relax"

"Another day, another high. Sponsored by the Federal Reserve, the ""regulator"" of the massive credit card vig."
Who has stopped using their Visa card completely? No one.
I thought we be up at least $2 today. But this is a slow and steady stock so.
"I'm a long time holder, never seller, so obviously I'm biased. That said, it seems silly to me that a world wide, world class, money printing franchise like V would engage in operations that shade/skirt legality. It simply doesn't make sense? I think we will find out in a week that there may be something a bit out of order, but nothing egregious. I think this a HUGE buying opportunity, Good Luck!"
"Haven't been looking at Visa very long (really wish I had been!), but seems like they have steady growth. Good time to get in even though they are hitting highs?"
will go green easy today
It's miss. Sell sell sell Market just over reacting it missed by 20M. Stock trade at near 52 week high even when sell projected to decrease by 18%. So 20M miss is huge deal but 18% decline in sale year over year is meaningless matri.
New 52 week low for JP. Morgan and Goldman Sachs today..Again you have to think what do they know that you don’t ?
When is a good time to buy V? Anytime if you're long.
I bought a $54 in 2008. I'm holding for a very long time. V LONG. Great stock. Eat that shorties.
Earning week!
V is for victory!!
Surprised it's up as much as Mastercard. Looking good ahead of earnings. Probably seen the top for the day already.
Standing pat. Jobs number too hot to add to position.
As e-commerce continues to take over Visa will continue to grow transactions and payment volumes. Most purchases will be online and that will require a credit card or a debit card. Visa will reach $200 in the near future.
Come on Visa! It’s everywhere!
All bad news already priced into Visa here. No surprises. Online and contactless purchases are essential right now. Headed back above $210 soon.
FY2020 revenues expected to grow in low double-digits range. FY2020 EPS expected to grow mid-teens range.
Just got of phone with Fid not trading V no change in Volume?????????? not officially stoped trading ??????Any one have ability to check other source Yahoo shows price 209.15 and changing how can it happen with no volume??
Down 10% on the year already. Down 20% and I'm all in.
buy the dipsnever fails.
"(Reuters) - Visa Inc said on Monday its transaction volumes had been hit as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on consumer spending, leading it to forecast mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth for the second quarter.""As countries have imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, domestic spending, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment and fuel, has sharply declined week on week,"" the world's largest payments network said in a statement.The company said transaction volumes fell in the second half of March and there has been a rapid deterioration in cross-border travel-related spending.The coronavirus has upended the retail industry as shoppers stay at home to avoid catching the highly contagious illness and stores remain shut."
Really hate when things bleed like this during earnings season.
"Visa is the best stock to buy,because of the online shopping. as long as Amazon staying in business you are in business."
"Hang on, and enjoy the ride. The best is yet to come!"
Covid surge is hammering credit cards. Paypal not so bad since it's online only.
"Thumbs up if you have a Visa card in your wallet, digital wallet, or purse..."

Rome is the eternal city. Visa is the immortal credit card. Viva Visa.

"Pulse ID. enters a strategic partnership with Visa , that should pump the stock up tomorrow, looks like it will be a good merger."
Great ! Time to buy
Does anyone know if Visa still owns around the 10% of the company Sguare (SQ) they invested/purchased when SQ was starting out??I haven't see much on thatThat would be worth a small fortune if they still own it.Here's a link to one of the original articles:https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/08/why-did-visa-take-such-a-big-stake-in-square.aspx
RBC Capital maintains outperform with $251 price target 
The Plaid acquisition is a new source of hyper growth for Visa. Get in now or miss out
"Cramer last week said that for the last 9/10 years if you bought V just before christmas and held into mid January, you made money. I'll give it a shot."
Buy low. Sell high... keep it simple
Just bought some more. For long we known this. That how V react each time for earning. Still not sale even 1 share. After earning this V up to between $230.00 and $240.00 range within 6 months. I love this stock. Shorties are the gamblers....Check out my posts...
Really too panic...Almost to the bottom price...

$300 within a year.
V is breaking out to all time highs. Time to get aboard.
what is happen with visa ? market up and it got down ? is there some thing with bitcorn ?
Visa is the ultimate consumer stock. The consumer in strong so Visa will directly benefit no matter where they shop. Visa will get a piece of all of the shopping.
Is Visa considering leaving San Francisco?
More good news after that thrilling rally today -Visa beats earnings again!
Buy back at 135

I wonder how long will this news linger and keep the stock down. few weeks?
Fid stuck on 210.22 Yahoo shows at 209.30 other stocks ok on Fid any ideas?
I'd rather sell a kidney than my V.
"Tough to predict what earnings will bring. Lots of online shopping of course due to lockdowns, but way less travel and smaller Christmas gatherings probably meant less spending on gifts/food...?"
How does it make sense that V reports strong quarter but MA stock does better. Now MA reports and it looks like MA will do better than V? Like why is MA always outperforming V???
"V should be up today to $143 or higher. It did rise to this level in after-hours trading, then the price was dragged down nearly $10. For some reason, V stock hasn't been growing in price for several months -- it seems V is being held down."
Let’s be real. Market is turbulent and going down. Big economists are pushing their worries about global economic slow down. Visa doesn’t move independently from the general market. So where do you think it will bottom? Where will you back up the truck and load up?
At 121 im thinking about it
"Analysts consensus for V are Strong Buy. ""Based on analysts offering 12 month price targets for V in the last 3 months. The average price target is $227.29 with a high estimate of $251."" Visa acquiring Plaid for fintech will lead to further growth.Bullish. Good Luck."
I use VISA in everything no more holding cash!!!
ONLY Lost 1.5 percent vs the Market's 5. WOW!
"Visa is going to make me a boat load of $$$ when I decide to finally sell, which will be a long long time from now. Dont be a fool, buy as many shares of Visa and hold on to them. This stock is simply amazing!"
I wish I would have bought more V.
Amazon Netflix... these all depending on E payment... both record high demands... leading repayment growth alot too
WIll it hold the gain or give it all back right before the bell like it has been doing?
"making money here. glad to do so. ,...when I posted, several days ago, about bitcoin, bitchain, and visa's heavy investment in it; along with other entities of money; no person posted anything relative to it. yeah, sure, consequences concerning this new fiat will take several years - Qatar(?) is bracing for it to be there form of currency, initiating starts in about three years. do people on this board have insight into the evolution of bit? I'm hoping visa will be a strong determinant on profits, (ours), from this source. input, please."
Close above $202
Why doesn't Visa buy Square?
Covid is killing credit card companies. Dark covid winter coming.
Visa is down 4.98% to 180.60
cant get to $160 on a day like this?
Why no dividend increase?
Buy more while you can
"Online sales, contactless payments, cashless society, etc. These trends are just beginning. Strong buy."
bought 800 shares in 2016 at $80. getting bored with this consolidation . time for a move up.
C'mon folks. Spend some dough on your Visa card and keep the economy going.
"So, who is worried about square cash , Zelle and Venmo crushing the interchange model?"
"Wall Street knows Trump is gone ina few weeks.That's why this sideways dance of stocks is happening.Under Biden, the stock market would do even better due to the trust and strength of alliances with our partners, who hate trump today.."
"Online shopping is only a subset of entire Visa spending. The bigger ugly beast lurking in Visa's revenue portfolio is the card spending related to travel & entertainment (T&E) segment which got slammed by coronavirus. All the airline/hotel revenues evaporated with no major revenue in past month, and guess what was the major payment channel for such spending (Yes, MC, Visa, Amex).Those T&E $$ that vanished should start to impact on Visa bottomline in this quarter. (International spend is a high margin fee segment in revenue portfolio and this will have evaporated as well)"
How does visa get impacted by Bitcoin being at all time highs?
"Seriously i dont want sarcasm from anyone trying to prove they were RIGHT on V, Fundamentally what has been the justification for this stock to drop over $67 the past 3 weeks ?????"
Pls visa give me some dollors
Visa and SIRIUSXM . A mighty combo.
Stimmy checks already hitting the banks. Get out yer Visas!
I have to use Visa to earn Airline points. Who uses Paypal to pay? What a waste!
If the pandemic subsides significantly to where people begin travelling this thing will hit $300 this year.
MA reports morning. All good and we’re green!
"Just be patient, let all the people that scare sell first, then it will go back up."
john is desperate
lol if your still long at all time highs after a 15% runup in a month you deserve your losses from here. talk about greed
"Square cash and Venmo, transactions outside of card interchange model. Anybody worried about the way V makes revenue is being engineered around? Sounds like a big deal, no?"
I love my V but this stock is getting way ahead of itself right now. We haven't seen any kind of pullback lol. As with most stocks right now.
"One day down. Next day Up.VIX at 70, Writing covered calls is best way to make money now."
No matter what anyone says... at the end of the day everyone is still using a Visa or MasterCard to make most of their purchases. Next up is $300 a share.
Look at the lowest price target. Oversold
Finally going to break above $180.
Breaking out above all time high
Just put on sale higher than market price....
PYPL also reports this week 10/23/19 after the close.
should have stayed in when I was in under $180
Reminder... Apple’s stock doubled in 12 months. Visa is still very undervalued here.
215 yahoooo.........
I would think people would use the credit cards compared with touching cash that can carry the virus? I know I wouldn't touch cash in areas that had the virus. (ok... a suitcase full of money can be washed....lol)
"Visa makes out wether we go into a recession or not. People use their debit cards more and Visa is the King of Debit. It doesn't lend money either, so they make out on every transaction. And they're the king of mobile payments too. Its a $1000 stock in the body of a $145 equity."
Considering 11.11 sales... V and MA should go up as plenty of people will be using their cards to make online purchases.
Bought 100 more shares at a discount! Go Visa go!!
"JOHN, you are so SHORT TERM. It's easy to be negative and come out on the down days. You don't really add and substance or logical info to your emails. You sound like a POLITICIAN. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Tell me something new or informative. Naysayers, what a drag!!! LONG VISA since 2008."
looking ridiculously cheap!
"Visa beats earnings and revenue, it drops. GE misses earnings and it soars. Only on wall street."
Go long V — it will trade at all time highs!
"I pulled profits before year end and I suspect you will see continued drop in price. I'll get back in, but not in this range.. GLT -----"
Buy on dips going to $300
As much as I love Visa we are so overbought on so many levels here. Either need to pause here for a good couple months or could see a pullback to the 110-115 area which would be a good buying opportunity for those who want yo get in. Forward PE even if do 4.30 in earnings this year is 29. Getting bit too steep to quickly. RSI way overbought to. Don't panic a healthy pullback is normal and great time to add to a great holding.
$200 after earnings
Also we need a price target upgrade
Let's go V.
$200 after April earnings release
man this has consolidated for a good 3-4 months now. anxious for the breakout.
P/e is 41. Expensive by that metric
looking like we're headed for a new all time high loozas!
#VIS2.L by Leverage Shares facilitates tactical trades with 2x leverage. It trades commission-free on Interactive Brokers and could be accessed through most trading platforms.
Wonder why it always goes down after earnings beats and then back up the next days. Good to know for next time.
Fighting hard vs virus
This pullback is way overdone!*** Time to add on this inflection type dip in V!
171 mid May. 177 June 5. 183 July 16.
"great stock, justt 2 problems wonder if you can help, it is valued at $383 billion and a p/e of 28. so you wont get a 10 or 20 bagger here, you need smaller size stocks and the p/e is higher than the growth estimates which are say 14%. its frustrating"
"Visa stock (NYSE: V) is an amazing stock, a perfect compounder. However, your future investment returns depend on the growth rate Visa's business will deliver in the future. I have analyzed the stock and even made a small valuation model on how to put Visa's current price earnings ratio and growth into a valuation perspective. https://svencarlin.com/visa-stock-analysis/"
You had better buy now while you can. :)
"More turbulence today!...1 step forwrd, 2 steps back"
I sold some V at a nice profit and I left some in and am experiencing a paper loss of about 45 a share. I will buy more and have no idea where the bottom is but I sleep just fine holding these shares. With all the business Amazon and Walmart are doing people are really hitting their plastic and it will only go up from here. With all the germ fears around money is an unnecessary pollution.
$V looking good headed into earnings. Next quarter they should be adding the crypto cards. Over 267k waiting for the Bitcoin rewards card alone! That's my play too. Jump on the waiting list herehttps://blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/?r=hvB4V
Great buying opp. Reminds of when JNJ SP dropped bkz of the overdone baby powder lawsuit.
been holding since 120 range. I averaged up today. Thaank you DOJ
Quit playing the guessing game with where the consumer is shopping. Visa cards are being used everywhere all day.
"Visa pretty large holding by Buffet.From Insider MONKEY:According to the Nilson Report, the volume of credit card transactions is expected to increase by 54% by 2020 and by 2025 the worldwide volume is projected to reach $55 trillion per year, with Visa Inc (NYSE:V) being one of the few companies that is very well positioned to profit from these developments."
what time is the earnings release? I thought it was 7 am?
institutions only trying to shake out the small investors just like last quarter!
Visa needs to come back someone call 911 visa needs help
"First they kill small business with lock downs 2 times and probably a 3rd coming.Then. A $15 minimum wage so that teenagers, handicapped and the elderly are forbidden to workand so that nobody can enter a business area, be it a new Company or a new worker.The question is.Will this outrageous ruling increase or decrease the bulk of economical transactions ?"
Steady since 203 buy zone good till 213
"Empirical observation: People are OUT and shopping on credit. They are gaslit into 'thinking' that it's safe to be at the malls, bars, restaurants, et. cetera."
Does anyone else here also own Berkshire Hathaway?
$200 soon!
V will BENEFIT from Pandemic. Most people switched from cash to Credit to AVOID germs.
"Visa is invisible in China, thanks to Chinese nationalism in favour of its own champions. Let us all see the reaction to Chinese debit/credit cards trying to penetrate the Western world. It's called Come-Uppance, and fails, but not because Chinese payment supremos domestically are banned from the countries they want to cover. Mis-trust in them will prevail."
"@@ NEW AABBG GOLD-backed Cryptocurrency Token / Wallet stock AABB...UP 1,100 % in 3 months. Now the #4 Most Research Requested OTC market stock by INSTITUTIONAL TRADERS.... "" newschain asia broadband ."""
Bought the dip. Added more
"That’s why you wait till buy zone with volume, 203 -210"
131 coming soon.
I'm long with Visa. Holding since $72/share.
200 in no time! Best time buy in before everything goes NORTH!
Can't stop this freight train. Third day in a row of new all time highs loozas!
A what share price would this stock split again?
Visa and Mastercard can't lose .. average in what you can afford and fund your retirement
Good news from AAPL after the close. V should test the highs again by end of week.
buy now or lose out.
Yahoo is saying 139.04 is the 52 week high. I swear this hit 140 last week. Am I wrong?
Online shopping- especially over Christmas will absolutely boom again..you could have a ‘big bag of money’ but not worth the paper it’s printed on if you want to buy online..
going big down tomorrow
"Fed cut rates to 0, v should go up to new high,"
what a yo yo day
I think it's time to take some profits and buy Square (SQ).
"Buy, a golden opportunity!"
$200 is on the way
"I don't see many people talking about the potential gains Visa will have from the amount of people buying cryptocurrencies on credit card. there was a report that 22% of crypto investors have bought with credit card. If you consider how many of those people used Visa and a rough 2% transaction fee for thousands of dollars, it adds up quick. that compiled with the increase in credit card usage and online shopping over the holiday season, q4 results should be spectacular."
krunalisnh that's a mastercard. lololo.
Is this the final nail in the coffin for cash?
$5.51b Rev
"I guess the thing that is new today, other than the fact that the WSJ decided to write about it today, is that the DOJ didn't stop their investigation into Visa when then Plaid deal fell through."
Visa is still not trading at its 52 week high. Get in now before you miss out. Quality stocks should be trading there right now. Strong buy.
"The most hilarious thing about the goof balls trying to bash V here is they realize that 96% of the stock is held by large institutions like Vanguard, Black Rock, T Rowe Price. Like these morons are really going to swing their short trade in their favor with lame comments on a Yahoo chat board. Hilarious"
Visa = $300 stock
Once the pandemic begins subsiding V and MA are your go to stocks.
Target estimate is now 122.81.
"April, May, and June of last year was the worst for closed businesses. The year over year growth will be massive for Visa. $300 price target"
"Earnings Expectations are fairly high, so i anticipate a meet or beat. PT keeps getting slowly pushed up by analysts, and we all know this company is still growing profits...sure winner and takes a front seat in my portfolio."
Visa is king
Buying more
if you want a quick profit go somewhere else. if you want the profits increase steady and surely then stay with Visa.
Bought it at the IPO. Only 2 things will be left if we have an apocalypse: cockroaches and and survivors trying to use Visa cards.
profit taking and buying opportunity
It is a chance to get out before the next dive when cov19 is at peak in (the end of) April. (may be in May).Good luck n stay healthy to all.
Hopefully people loaded up on the calls at the end of the day the company is due for a big earnings beat. Lots of people avoiding cash transactions and using card instead. Expecting a big earnings win on this call. Good luck everyone!
remember that visas growth rate is going to be astronomical and with more and more online purchases and also people using fintech payment platform such as Square! $$$$$$
Looking good. I bought a Fortune magazine and it had 50 stocks listed that are growers that you need to own. One is V.
BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? Whenever Amazon announces wanting to start up their own payment system is enough for me to BOYCOTT AMAZON.
$162 today
The MM not gonna let it get to 180...nice try though
"this real???? i buy at 225 $ , nothing but a skihill now !!! hahahahahahaha sad"
My unemployment check arrived in the mail. It was a Visa debit card.
"Nice to see Visa topping $200.00 and going to $210.00. Seems like a milestone after last year's 'consolidation' period. Even if it's peaked for now, it was a great way to end the mid year doldrums of 2019!"
Another amazing day?
Play the technical rebound in V for huge gains!
We’ll see 206 right today!
Hope it holds up but I'm not confident of a green close.
"Hello, I can't be the only one that sees that this company is gonna be your new bitcoin hang on For the ride!!!"
Visa should buy Square with decline in SQ stock
V should be a lifetime hold. All you have to do to be a millionaire is live long enough holding V. It has split once and I can't wait for the next split.
"About time it makes a move. I hope it sticks. I just buy a share when it hits a 1 month low and starts moving up again. Worked so far, hope it continues."
Glad i bought more shares Monday :) was a no brainer
Those shorts better hurry and cover!
$250 tomorrow
V or MA? Any opinions?
Get in now. Visa will beat earnings and jump over $150+ soon.
If earning are good what’s outcome going to look like? What price do you think we can get too?? Any help would be nice. Thanks.
So nice to own a stock you can buy and forget about. Love Visa.

"I know Kudlow gave up drinking but he sounded like he was hammered during that call. And who wrote those questions for Scott, Nancy Pelosi?"
"V - USD 206.90 Close 03.19.21. Every 2 years DOJ comes back with the same accusation against Visa. Would DOJ, for the sake of closure, do what it thinks is right for a longer period in time this time, and allow V to be the trend-setter. Copy cats do the same as V, but under different classifications to an instantaneous financial intermediary, which V set out to be, is, and will be. Others call themselves names, bereft of the highest hi-tec, which V has invested in. Let DOJ destruct V in a tiny way, and watch, then the DOJ's damage to the economy as a whole."
Just waiting for the Santa Claus Rally!!!
"Strong earnings are coming, prepare to calculate your profit !"
KeyBanc downgrades day before earnings....lol. They are not even trying to hide their manipulation. Loading up on the 195 calls expiring 1/29 .
#$%$ is happening here in the AH?
"The whole complex is down--PYPL,V,MA,PAYS,--may have something to do with FB testamony today."
This looks like a retaliation against sellers . Looking good .l
"I’m not sure I agree with the theory that since everyone is home they will be buying stuff online. With these uncertain times, and the fact that a ton of people don’t know when or where their next paycheck is coming, I’d say spending will retract significantly. V is a great company but due to the current climate I’d say wait for the next decline to start working on a position."
2nd stimulus comes in prepaid visa debit cards. millions will be issued. 
"Well I really hoped this would have taken off, up through the 140s. What to do? I’m buying MORE. Much, much more as V will be 159+ by June."
Most spending has to funnel thru Visa and spending is accelerating throughout the world. Still cheap at these levels.
over 207 today!!
picked up some more today..what a gift below 174 :)
all you haters talking about losing money day by day. CALM DOWN. the market is very volatile and if you hold through the volatility you will profit and also receive some divident income too
Visa estimates EPS about 10% lower than the year To date. That's why that correction to 200. Disappointed by the fact that it cannot create earnings at all in a digital Era! Holdimg till 215 and that's enough for me with this stock. Shareholders are neglected by CEO and the board for a long time!
I am adding more Visa. It is rallying!!!
Just bought a lot of shares! This sell off has nothing to do with VISA!
"own them all:SQUARE, PAYPAL, MASTERCARD, VISA. cant go wrong. they are my fav."
WHY THE DROP ?????
Why drop of $1 at last minute?
This should be down double digits
Winner Visa!
"Surprised this is not getting more attention: (Reuters) ""Visa Cardholders To Be Able To Use Card On Wechat Pay in China""This has been a big issue for a long time."
Vaccine and economic recovery coming soon in my opinion. This will be up over $200 and beyond soon I believe.
why is blaming trump for covid 19? isnt anyone angry at china for eating dogs cats bats and cockroach soup?
big break out coming now
Cashless society
Get into Visa before holiday sales numbers are released. Holiday sales were huge. Don’t miss out.
Why is this down
There is major resistance at 4.98
"The core business of credit card companies is spending power! Ask yourself, in this environment, ppl are spending more or less? In addition, does debt relief policy hurt credit card companies?"
won't more people use credit since they don't have a job?
More people will use their debit and credit cards to make purchases at home and have things delivered.
"Reality check: V estimated earnings for 2020 were $6.20 a few months ago. Current revised consensus is now $5.40. And its dropping. V is a great company, but don't be fooled by all the cheerleading. I will buy closer to 52 week lows."
Smart money is buying Visa! $$$$
"Just LMAO at the idiots on here who mocked me when I said this would pull back a week ago. Stocks don't go straight up. So many investors, if you want to call them that, have ZERO clue. I own Visa and still knew it was due for a pullback. And said it is normal and nothing wrong with that and would be good opportunity for those who missed getting in and wanted a lower price. Consolidation is a good thing. Those of us with a brain know this. Unlike the fools who are claiming it's going straight up. Non stop. Will double in a year. Give me a break. Stupidity abounds on so many. 121 is a good price but could pullback to 115-118 depending upon general market movement. Maybe some fools will learn stocks don't just go straight up. But I doubt it. That would take braincells."
$300 stock in 30 days
V will be back 132 on Monday guy
paypal can not be better than visa no matter what.
V is a value/reopening/faux financials play and is breaking out of a 1 year base
New all time high before earnings
Should hold and goo long
Why is this stock rallying? Is it just the market sentiment or something else?
Visa stock price target raised to $220 from $210 at Oppenheimer.
"Love to listen to all the TV pundits, so called experts. Today they all list the risks, brexit, no EU deal, USMCA still need to pass congress, flat yield curve, China deal uncertainty, recession threat and so on. NO mention of any of this yesterday. Can you spell manipulation, get everyone buying their shares at highs and then kill the shares so they can buy it back cheap for great returns next year. Hold on your shares, take the pain, and do not give MM your stocks."
25.98M short interest. 1.46% of float.....not a lot
250 tomorrow?
"42 PE, for what?Processing cards is a commodity service. Yes, I know it is a great company. Blah blah blah. But that is not the point. Everything has a price."
visa + plaid = good marriage helping my rookie star happy
"This deep impact will ripple 2~3 more days.Then, good to buy."
Buy. The Money Machine.
"Visa will continue to rise, no worries. Good time to buy!"
let's back to 210 minimum
buy V today move out of ur mo ms basement tmrw!
looks like break'in new highs soon.
Coronavirus- Feds excuse to cash out bulk amounts of stock
"Today is the calm before the next storm. It's been a painful ride for V and MA shorts, and will only get more painful if shorts don't cover. Have owned V since 2016 and MA for a few less years, but both have made me a lot of money as a long. These will be much higher than they are now several years from now."
"I loaded up more shares. People will forget this in 2 days and even if SEC fines V, it will be peanuts to this amazing company. This is a god given opportunity. Have seen a lot of such stock movements due to SEC probes and average life time for this news is 2 days. Don't miss this great reopening stock"
got some V and MRK
VISA is going to 1000.00 per share in 10 year. still lots of room to buy gentlemen.This is truly one of the best companies in the world!
Stock split?
Kaleyra (KLR +0.2%) announced a new agreement with Visa (NYSE:V) in the Latin America and the Caribbean region.
this is gonna probably get to 180-182. The real $$$ will be in the next 3 weeks. this will probably go to it's high when the FED cuts.
"@Bemo, very strange? a few weeks ago you didn't like Visa?"
we could keep it at 150...just for you
$231 is still the price target
"Back to 220, that was even quicker than I thought. Well done V."
A strong consumer bodes extremely well for Visa

Pricy even at $181
Time for another 4:1 split
Visa going to keep benefiting from our wonderful Trump economy! $$$$ GO VISA! $$$$$$$
Has everyone lost their collective minds? Not adding to my position but down V down close to 4%. Does trade with China control all aspects of a stock?
Why Visa P/E is way higher then CoF?
Read the report on Amazon. Record breaking holiday sales. Can you make cash purchases on Amazon? No. Only digital purchases.

VISA looks a bargain right now. Underpriced and huge upside potential with reopening
This year $300. Next year $400.
I've been waiting for a pull back to buy more. The pull back never happens. Think this is still a buy at this price? I'm long visa.
Range bound since July.
"V & MA are poised to do huge gangbuster business during the upcoming Holiday Season.- These stocks are trading relatively flat, year over year, and could both see a technical bounce from current trading levels.."
Glad I sold in the 180's. let's see how far it can go down to put up some more at a discount!
Market finally drops but V holds on as the Bigs and insiders KNOW that the Feckless Fed will protect credit card company 'vig' at all costs.
"Without Visa, nothing works, eCommerce or brick-and-mortar.Visa will be stronger!"
WHY did JP MORGAN just go RED Seconds Ago ? In the middle of this big rally ?
It’ll come back to $142 in the morning. After hours volume is sooo weak that it’s hard to even count as much. Really just gives you an idea of range. I mean 2k shares a min is nothing to the 80k per minute that visa typically logs.
Always use your common sense and logic. Will people stop using their Visa cards because of a tweet? NO! This price is a gift. You will regret not buying at this price when Visa reaches $200. Strong buy!
$250 before November. Online sales and e-commerce are surging.
I can't believe V is showing down in premarket. What stupid person would be selling one of the best in the entire market? Just raised the dividend. If you owned from the ipo day you are making about 2% on your money--- not bad. Then add in the capital gains and you have done extremely well. Any seller of V is way past being stupid. They need a care giver.
China deal is done! $$$ Like I said Trump is a master of business negotiation! Thank you president Trump! Job well done!
"Visa has to tank badly. Airlines and airports have been banned. No travelers this Winter, expect V under 180."
Visa needs to buy some Bitcoin....
Looks like V primed for a run to test new highs by earnings. I expect V to touch 85 by earnings barring a market correction.
"Visa is reporting earnings on Wednesday Oct. 24....this is why Visa and Mastercard are up today even though the markets are deep into the red. Load the boat, truck and car on Mastercard shares. Mastercard will pop big time on the back of Visa's strong earnings.....by Oct. 30 when Mastercard reports, it will over $220/share.Get on board, and don't wait, or you will watch the party train pass you by.All aboard."
"I hope people followed my advice when Visa was 194 10 days ago, I said then and still maintain it will be over 220 before the end of February, I've been in with Visa 12 years now and I follow it close enough that I know it's ups and downs and it was certainly due to fly up as it did over $14 a share within the last two weeks, hopefully you cashed in on it."
V still undervalued 
interesting.....MA and V-same story but MA goes up after ER and V downnever figure......................
250$ by EOY
One of my better investment decisions over the past few years has been buying V at around 75 back in 2016. Only regret is I should have bought a whole lot more. I think V (and MA) are buy and hold forever stocks due to their 3 sided network making it next to impossible for a start up to dislodge them from the fintech royalty.
"Everyone who bought at $220+, welcome to bag holding"
"When I'm having a bad day, I take a look at V and I'm happy again."
Bernie Sanders has previously proposed credit card fee and interest caps. This could spell the end of card benefits and would greatly reduce the growth of processing. Sanders is a FAR greater risk to investors than Coronaviruses.
"lol way overbought, shorted hard 207.60, got me some nice cheap Jan 31 207.5 PUTS thanks id_iots!"
why?
When is this thing going to bottom out? Safe to wait until tomorrow to buy or get in now? I can't see it dropping much lower than 179/178?
why is this consistently going down even after the earning beat.. is it amazon sorry reporting..
"Talking heads on CNBC bemoaning GC all day long trying to keep market down like he is single handily responsible for tax cuts is just crazy. Never knew of any of the past administrations economic advisors and we were just fine. But GC , oh my. Trump should have never hired him in the first place. Maybe all the leaks will subside with him gone. Trump likes resolution through conflict. GC was responsible for the contrarian view. For that we can be thankful otherwise don't let the door ..."
"Are we pulling out of the mud today? two static weeks here, so I hope so!"
Using Visa reduces risk of catching deadly China flu since people aren’t handling contaminated dollar bills. Your exposure risk is significantly reduced

Goldman is tanking to new 52 week lows every day now...WhAts going on as they know everything ?
TO Visa and employees = Forward this the head office!! Millions of Americans watching the first NFL game turned the pre-game off! These folks did not watch the pre-game because of all the BLM garbage by NBC announcers. SO your money you paid went down the drain!! Thought you would like to know this!!
High gas prices = higher payments at the gas pump = win. Less driving = more online shopping = win. V = Victory.
"On the brighter end of the payments spectrum, Visa Inc (NYSE: V) (Overweight, $165 price target) is Morgan Stanley’s top pick. Closely following are Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) (Overweight, $224 price target), FleetCor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FLT) (Overweight, $238 price target) and Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) (Overweight, $96 price target)."
"$300 this year. Reopening, online sales, cashless society, and the comps for 2020 are very low."
Visa should break thru $220 on Monday... Easily $235 by Friday

Selloff may be partly due to Affirm IPO. Weak hands selling as usual.
"$172 is right value for this stock, MA investors thinking based on this , MA will hit $285"
Visa has lots of room to raise the dividend for the next decade. Can’t wait to get $5/share
any reason why visa has been dropping over the last couple weeks?
Again... I would rather swipe my own card than carry around cash that’s changed hands with lots of people. Strong buy!
"The holiday buying season was huge. Absolutely no doubt Visa has reaped the benefits from that, along with strong overall consumer spending. I added shares today to our retirement Roth. This money machine will just get more and more valuable over years to come. Look at their 5+ year chart. GLTA."

Holiday purchases are breaking records. Online sales are breaking records. Great entry point for Visa.
"Look at V now, meanwhile MA pre-market up 8pts... such a joke!"
"Visa, is a must-own stock in your portfolio, not only is the country and world going to plastic which will definitely be on the upswing now that covered being reigned in, but the dividend on Visa stock is a tremendous bonus every quarter I get huge earnings just from that and with the stock heading northwards we can expect another split probably before the end of the year, that would be awesome probably will be another three or four to one split. Been with Visa 12 years never disappointed!!"
"Stunning beat, we need a proper reaction:Visa reported quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.28 by 10.94 percent. This is a 2.74 percent decrease over earnings of $1.46 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $5.70 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $5.53 billion by 3.07 percent. This is a 5.85 percent decrease over sales of $6.05 billion the same period last year."

Another day where V is out performed by MA.
I’m assuming just reaction to mastercard great quarter. That to me is good.

"Visa Right now at this price is a Bargain entry point to add more to your portfolio, this little pullback only offers you an excellent price point to either add to your portfolio of visa or first-time buyers,,, been through this scenario several times since 2009 and Visa has always risen back up and will continue to do so again, this is an absolute long-term hold and will return to the mid 200s by August, in the meantime you'll still be receiving Nice dividends along the way. Long & Strong ! Don't be the foolish one who sells now and is sorry later."
don't worrybe patient
Whatever the reason is ! Just keep calm and buy the dip Have a nice weekend
More and more I find it impossible not to think V is the best company in the world...
oh noit went up againnow ill have to pay taxeshahaha
Buy now if you want the dividend. Or buy because this is a great stock to own for the long term. Easily 145+ by end of the year.
Best stock ever!

"Question to everyone: I own Visa and Mastercard. When I do a chart analysis comparin both over the last 5 years, Mastercards stock has appreciated more. Can anyone offer me a good opinion as to why Mastercard stock has done better. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy with the performance of Visa's stock, yet, it seems Mastercards stock has performed better. So, I want to know why?"

Like i said.. Visa stock value increase slowly but surely since ipo.. Still here and buy more..Thanks Visa..now my coffee time. Congrats to all long. Sorry shorties..
I bought on the split up 141% now

So far... glad I bought more yesterday. And likely I’ll be kicking myself in a few weeks for not having bought even more. Should have gone all in on Visa a long time ago
How about that the legal eagles are starting to gather in hopes of a class action against Visa...
"Was V downgraded or something? I am shocked that it is down this much today. I didn't see any news on it, but I didn't scroll down very far."
What’s causing the panic!!! I thought no news was good news! Lol I sure got a rude awakening

what a great Company to own and forget
my biggest regret is that I didn't buy more
why does V always trade behind MA. MA +6ish% while V is only 4ish%
Looks like a beat.

Within 5-10 years we will likely all be totally cashless. Visa accepts no credit risk - banks are underwriters. What good is a shoebox full of money when you’re buying online. Visa is worldwide- better positioned than MC. especially in Europe. But and hold forever..really.
lol what do u geniuses think will happen once the market goes down again? this will magically go back up? lol!
I regret selling my V and MA
The blood bath returns
Where’s Julez? Him and his $200 by earnings from 2 quarters ago? Haha I’m just glad V woke up from its 6 month nap. Congrats longs!
This is a stock you never sell unless you need the money. They joined forces with an Asian company which will only make Visa bigger and better.....a solid great stock!
Drumpf’s ego is destroying everything.
Visa is fxxxkn underrated! $230 at least! even not a balloon. compare it with other stonks
"I've been in Visa since the IPO and I'm here to tell you to own it, don't trade it. I consider Visa one of my core holdings, steady as she goes, upward trajectory, a bit of stability and huge profit. It is a diversion from the other high beta stocks I own.. Consider it for your portfolio."
Bought tomorrow's 205 contract when this was at 204.8. In and out in under 2 hours with a 80% profit
This is a staple stock that you buy and dont look at for a year. It moves very slowly but it's a guarantee win.
Buy more Visa and make some money! Holiday spending will be great for Visa like usual!
Crazy how people want this to go straight up. V is a long term buy and hold and buy more on a pullback. It was just in 150s a couple months ago people. Buy it and forget it.
"Does anyone worry about the operating margin of credit cards as 2-3% transaction fee of credit cards are charging today will be facing headwinds in the future, when other Fintech companies are looking to eliminate or lower the cost of digital transactions?"
"$V $MA IMO what’s happening is because some investors are re distributing their wealth into other undervalued companies affected with trade war as it started to ease to gain quick profit plus the slight increase in US borrowing rate and China manufacturing deflation rate in August .Thats why despite huge sell off the index is not impacted with same magnitude( they are shuffling) .finally ,This is a great buying opportunity for longs"
"I thought to myself, before Phase 1 China deal, that Visa would probably end this year somewhere around 235-240. I know it will take some time to get into China, but the potential is astronomical. Visa could end the year, barring no calamities, around 260-290. Any thoughts??? Same goes for MA."

$300 by the end of 2020. To the moon!
"weaker hands sold today, thanks that was a gift to buyers."
AXP just had a nice beat. Easy beat for V for Q1.
"A lot of pumping here by V longs, as you would expect. But if the market is really ""forward looking"" and a near-term recession is imminent, V will get smashed just like all equities. I hope to accumulate V at lower prices (looking for $120/sh and below). Its valuation is not unreasonable at current levels, but it has PLENTY of room to fall on stock market pullbacks.Good luck to all."
Still very cheap at these levels. Check the analyst price targets. $239 is the high target. Several stocks in the market are trading close to their high target.
Curious for ecommerce numbers
Stock market becomes bleeding battle field. No more an investment tool than greedy lust. I’m out...
$200 today?
Getting kind of pricey with a historically high p/e. How far can it really go?
More people are using their Visa cards to shop online and use delivery
Trump just cancelled Christmas for a chunk of America.
Congrats to all that bought the dip at $220
Market makers love V so much and always play this kind of game!LOL
Retailers are reporting record e-commerce growth. Digital payments are required for e-commerce. Visa will breakout to the upside going into the holiday shopping season.
Break thru the $180 resistance!
why is this happening?
"MA has higher PE, yet it is going at a faster pace than V. I wish V can catch up to MA as it should."
Buying more Visa this morning
Nobody is using cash and millions of people will be living off their plastic...this lion will roar!
There will not be $200 before earnings. That guy doesn't quite know what he is talking about.
"I only have 74 shares, this is one of my favourite stocks. Anyone know roughly when they would do a split? Thanks"
How far do you think the current dip will go before a rise? According to the chart major dips never really decline further than the previous major dip. V is pretty steady.
Looking good for higher prices. Long over 180 for a run up to 210. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/V.gif
Over $200 today.
Why drop today? Something I missed?
This is my favorite stock !
This is visa's 4th. quarter. Hope they have a positive outlook for 2020 guidance. The Conference call will be very important and scrutinized! Good luck!!

David you have been muted.
"ok, getting into 207's now. I expect next week will also be rough."
V better have great earning report today.
"Getting all that red back into our pockets!! Quick tip for those of you who haven’t hear of TWLO. Their 52 week low is in the 20’s and the stock is currently at 112. I’ve been following it since 37 and every time there has been an earnings report, the earnings have been beat by about 200% and the stock price rose about 15-30% afterwards. Obviously that comes with some volatility, there was a 3 week period where the stock most 25%. However the earnings date is Feb 12 and I just want to let all my new Visa friends know you might want to load up the 11th or before close on the 12th. I expect big things! Especially since it will be year over year comparisons to the highest degree!"
stay long. no reason to trade this stock.
V is close to it's high for today.

"Do we break $180 tomorrow? Thumb Up for Yes.....Thumb Down for No.Also comments if we can break out to $200 and when?Cannot hold V and MA down for too long, always been slow and steady but would like to see a surge higher!"
Buy on the dips my friends! $$$$
VISA will break out this week!!!
V is not a trading stock. Best bet is to get in and hold. Lots of other stocks that swing trade for a fast buck.
Maybe they want to buy at rock bottom prices. LOL
why its down without earnings?
"There is no fundamental reasons why this is going down post-earnings. It handily beat increased earnings expectations, as well as on revenues. Its forward EPS is also similar to MA with their outlook actually getting brighter as more folks purchase online. Today's jobs and wags report is positive. And V just announced a 7B share buyback. Look at all the other financials, they are doing very well recently (e.g. BAC, C, GS even WFC) despite or in spite of all the tax code changes or gov shutdown.The only reasons I can think of are due to the bots trading against the humans. They will force the price down until most people lose money and then it will reverse back up after all the relevant options expire this week.Remember too that markets are irrational and these financials are mostly held by big institutions with the money to run trading bots to sweep all the retail money.Let me theorize here on whats going on and what is likely to happen on market open, so you folks see if this will pan out as follows:- Visa price will be sold down by the bots and algos until a point where the largest volumes of options becomes worthless. Given the bullish expectations we had more call options being overbought than puts, this implies that prices will fall to where most of the OI in calls are and stay there until they expire. In other words, the bots will frustrate most people most of the time.- That means I expect the price to fall rapidly on open to somewhere in the vicinity of 119 and even slightly below.- Then it will bounce a bit and stay near there until Friday close- On Monday or Tues open, after all the calls expire, it will shoot back up and progress above 125I have put this to the test, with a small purchase of near-term puts to ride it down short-term.Likewise, I am holding a 2:1 ratio of longer term calls to capture the high probability of upswing over the following week(s).I'm also intentionally posting this to let the bots (and other traders too) read this, and see how they might react or maneuver.My theory may be right in which case I make money, or I might lose a bit if my expectations are totally upended, but it will still be a worthwhile experimental lesson.Good Luck to all."
Digital sales are the new normal. Visa will be at a new 52 week high very soon.
They downgrade stocks or even short them just toget it cheaper!
have been with Visa since 2008Glad they split too
I think any news besides fundamentals is useless in this climate. News on trade deals comes out good and bad so often it feels like manipulation.
It's spring coiled!
I have no doubt in V reporting strong earnings. I'm a little more skeptical about guidance. I will add more on any potential dip
The value of V should be much higher. It invested in the startup firm Square (SQ) 2009 which is doing very well now...
Below 200 this is a buy.

Companies like tech, financials and any/or highly regulated or duopolies leaders are always target. Once they get their piece of flesh this to shall pass. V?MA are still long term buys.....keep averaging through any downturn."
"Since we didn’t see 204 today, we’ll see low 190 territory tmr! Do we still remember last quarter earnings in October? All the way down to 179!"
Don't worry.VISA will be the winner in e.pay.It won't go down the hill.
The march to 230 has ended ! 230 is here now ! Now on to 250 !
"It it doesn't matter how good the financials are. People and institutions will take profits. Especially when it is this far extended past it's previous high. Historically, every run up is combined with sharp pull backs, so it is more or less guaranteed to go through a correction, big or small. Looking at what goes on in the past, even if this stock is bound for 200, those who entered recently will take a big loss. Otherwise, smart money would wait for support after a healthy pull back to enter. I personally have a slightly bearish option spread that I'm selling premium off of until it does ultimately retrace, which then I'd go long. But be smart, don't believe hype, believe price structure, because if 10/10 it does a sharp retracement during a big move up, guess what? it'll happen again. Probabilities always win"
Expecting a very solid ER after market closes and expect a pop to at least $185-$187 the recent highs. Here is the question does V then reverse down some ($180) or starts to move and make new highs possibly analysts estimates $200 or so? I am not sure without some analysts upgrades will V get over $200 threshold.....THOUGHTS?
$200 is on the horizon
Headed for $200
xnet gonna rise 5-10x by monday
"V (USD 207,90 on 02.16 close) is struggling with USD 215-218 in sight. V has been struggling for 1 year, with this former top made before the outbreak of Covid-19. Has lots of smaller/tiny rivals to contend with, offeringsuper-fast money transfers. Visa is investor in latest digital equipment to ward off encroachment by lesser-endowed ""competition"". V's danger is for being seen as quasi-monopolistic - a long-term headwind."
stock market really this scared about the china virus?
$245 price target. Check it
"How have you PERSONALLY benefited by trump's ""tax cut""?"
Visa! It may go down a bit ...right before it goes up MORE! Long and holding
"When we look back tmr, Even 204 is too cheap!"
A the rate MA is going V may be higher in a few months lol
"So much panic on here. Look at the chart, it broke it a bit bc of panic yday - same with stocks like FB - but when V recovers it does it swiftly. Took a week to get back to 210 from 203 in Nov and a week to go from 203 to 218 in Dec. Buy and forget."
V will go to 145 after earnings!!
Is it too late to buy it here
"May not be climbing with the rest of the market but with V your money is almost always safe. Looking back on the full historical chart you'll only see pullbacks where larger macro conditions were at work. Cross-border travel is picking up in markets outside the US and with that come the foreign transaction fees and tourism spending we've been missing out on. We're on the tail of the pandemic, hospitalizations are continuing to trend down worldwide even as positive test results are up, and therapeutics and vaccines are quite literally right around the corner. The pandemic still shouldn't be ignored but the facts show that it's not getting worse, rather better. I can't even begin to imagine the number of people worldwide that are champing at the bit to travel."
"Buying more V, thanks for the opportunity! "
Just relax everyone. No margins no worries. The sun will rises tomorrow.
what's today's excuse?
The price target is $250

I have been holding Visa sinced it's IPO 2008 and thru the 4 for 1 stock split 2015. It's been 9 years. still holding.

"visa is held internationally. people here in canada are chomping at the bit, with their visas in hand to spend, spend, spend. No way this can falter over the next year."

"Visa will be one of the few to hold onto value during a recessionReturn on Equity: ROE is one of the most widely used profitability measures, reflecting the efficiency by which a company uses its shareholder funds to generate returns. While Mastercard has an ROE of 30%, the same for Visa is 41%, reflecting its better profitability."
people are now receiving unemployment plus stimulus plus 600$ unemployment boost. some people in industry are making more staying home lol. people will be spending.!!
"Own both but the more I look at PYPL, the most annoyed I get with V."
@Greg V is different from other fintech like SQ and PYPL! V has been building up the most prominent financial ecosystem and gained the best trust from global clients! Just look at the percentage of new bitcoin pockets opened with V! It’s the NO.1 in all aspects!
Does V split again below or above $300? Last split was at $248.
I purchased at the ipo price of $66 and then it split four to one making my cost basis about $16 dollars a share. Visa is one will stay in my portfolio until full retirement age (and maybe longer).
Bounced off the 200. Hopefully it takes it 52 week high. all economic indicators looking good. BUY!!!
why red ah? not enough beat?
Any idea when Visa might split 2:1 or even 3:1 ?
we'll see some modest rebound by EOD. just my opinion
This will surely turn today. I can't imagine it will be down this much two days in a row
Visa train taking off! :)

V is a slow and steady run stock
At $180 ish = buying with both hands as we move to $195....
When is the dividend increase going to be announced? Its not if but when.
Pick any time range for the Share Price...all GREEN...all the TIME.
Pump and dump is the hallmark of the bear . You are gradually losing fabulous gains because you refuse to accept the fed removing the punch bowl  and it’s effect in overpriced stocks like v...
"I am so scared I will buy Visa and Mastercard. I'd say about 5 years ago I acquired Visa at $ 67 a share. After that it went up to around $ 200 a share so I bought some more. After it hit $ 264 a share (2 years back I think) it split 4:1 so the share value was $ 61 per share or something like that. If it drops to around $ 72 I will buy some more. I hope it does. Visa and Mastercard are great stocks. Same as WW Grainger, Autozone, BRK-B, GE, Stanley Black and Decker, PPG and so on."
"What a strong reversal! Good lessons for the losers that sold Friday!If they allow crypto purchases on Visa cards, it is going to be a serious game changer, the volumes alone will compete with all other consumer purchases!"
"V is for long holding, not for short trade or even day trade. Look at the 10 year ago, 955% higher! Need patient to hold it."
up up we go to another record high
Very low comps this year versus last year. Visa will crush earnings for the rest of 2021 and beyond. People are traveling again.
Well! V hit the new high today.
Bad performing recession stock. HUGE gains in a thriving economy.
This stock never dips 
"Besides, everything is down after hours, has anyone else noticed that there are a ton of sell-offs going on? I had to check the news to see if we declared war on someone, that’s how bad I thought it was."
"Dec. 26, 2019 at 10:55 a.m. ESTAmericans have accumulated near-record levels of credit card debt over the past year as card companies have increased interest rates and fees.The booming market is helping drive record banking industry profits but could become increasingly costly for consumers who don’t pay off their bill every month or miss a payment, industry experts say.JPMorgan Chase, the country’s largest bank by assets, and Citigroup reported that credit card sales were up 10 percent and 5 percent respectively in the third quarter. Profits at Visa were up 17 percent in its most recent fiscal year, while Mastercard reported an 11 percent profit jump in its most recent quarter."
"Yes, a very nice and speedy recovery after Monday's big dip. Like the ""dip"" never happened. The Visa toll booth never stops making money. I love recurring revenue streams, this is a company Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway loves too. Say no more."
Trump is keeping his campaign promises to better our country whether you like it or not! $$$ God bless Trump!

More analyst upgrades are coming
"Who or what is DOJ? I'm looking for buying some shares here, following Visa and it's prospects for a long period. Personally I've been disappointed from the CEOs tactics of not being interested for shareholders but soon or later I would be regretful if I didnt buy at these levels. I took a placement though near 205 for today or Monday to be clear considering the technical analysis. But except of the antitrust warning, I dont quite follow the DOJ thing"
I really love this stock and want to get in but im not sure when especially with the news and pre-market action. Any advice?
Closed on the highs of the day again... Very bullish signal
"I checked with my broker and they have no idea...so I looked online but cannot find any reason why V is down like 4 %, M is down like 5 %, SQ is down like 3 %, and PYPL is down like 6 %; yet AMEX is up almost 2 %? Doesn't add up or make sense...."
going the wrong way!
may be because they don't have Bitcoin???
Any news please to understand why is Visa dropping this way?
GOOD MORNING BAG_HOLDERS! another glorious day in bag_holderville eh?
"Anyone looking to buy into company: Look at the 32 price targets placed by analysts and the “buy” rating... The only decision you ought to make is in the short term, whether or not you’ll wait for the fallout of the election results to buy."

most of us have not seen the great depression of 1932. but u can google it
undervalued still
$300 soon
y a big drop after hour
I bought it back again.
Visa is bouncing all over the place in pre market

I see a drop down to $120..i hear they are taking all the shorts..
The stock buybacks in Visa are huge! We’re just getting started. $200 soon.
Will we see $210 by EOF? I think will get some forward progress with V! PayPal And SQ taking a lot of buyers cash
I’m currently in my last year of college and purchased V at 82.67. This stock & FB may help me retire at an earlier age!
"This is the best stock to own sit on it and let it ride, also they sponsor winter olympics....."
"Buy V today, stop using your parents' Netflix password in 2020."
Smart money are buying a lot of shares at these extremely low levels.
now is time to buy
Bingo. Told ya. Strong Buy now.
Visa needs to get to $300+ and then do another split. Love this company! Best stock to own..
Sold at $143 but will buy back if rebounds. Who knows what is going to happen? No one.
"All the money and work Yahoo put into ""improving"" the site and we still are riddled with spammers. Yahoo you are a real loser."
Slow and safe
Should pop from here
Who here bought more Visa shares in the $130’s? Congrats!
I am seeing vision of white bull running through the smoke.
A 900 point drop is a terrible thing to waste￼
"V will hit $240 EOM after this earnings period is over. People are ready to get out there and spend as summer approached, so expect V to $260 by July. The signs in retail bode well for a V jump."
getting ready to buy more! $$$
Up up up
There may be enforceable quarantines for NYC metro soon. Corona virus is still spreading and will not peak for at least 2-3 more weeks in most of the country. Oil demand is critically down and supplies are climbing. This pandemic is going to paralyze economic activity.
Question: at what share price will Visa probably split?
Anybody know why MA and V are down these days especially MA more then V?
What will happen tomorrow with Visa ? Any guess .
So Visa beats earning and revenue for quarter - then CEO announces that Visa will likely ‘face challenges in next few quarter’ that’s freakin great. Why not wait a month or so to announce possible bad forecast. Why do it simultaneously to your earnings. Not a bright strategy..
Stock buybacks
Visa beat estimates.....hihi..let see what's happen tomorrow when's market open?? Hopefully this time is different!!!!
V will have a great 2Q. They're issuing three crypto cards. I'm getting the Visa BTC rewards card. Get BTC for my purchases without coming out of pocket for that position. The wait-list is getting long so better sign up quick. https://blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/?r=hvB4V
Visa is becoming an unfashionable stock. Who wants to buy a turtle when you can buy a rabbit. People are getting out and buying PayPal and Square instead.
What is going on with visa? Why is MA out performing this stock? Visa can’t make any head way at all. Any input or reasoning would be great. Thanks.
Is it a buy in the morning or naw
is that 900% increase in 220 calls legit or not. that price going to hit before expiry??
This stock surely will go to 140 in a few months time or earlier. Everyone uses Visa Card!
volume almost half of daily avg
"Should be a great report, and a short squeezed to all time high coming."
"UBS came out and said they expect 80,000 retail stores to close by 2026. Most purchases will be made via V, or MA. Oh, plus reopening, share buybacks, crypto, and dividends increases. Hreat place to be. Cheers longs!"
Back in the saddle again!!!
When Visa drops on er it usually ends up even by the end of the day...
Is this some sort of setup for someone to buy cheap shares before summer arrives?
"I own both visa and MasterCard and i will be holding long. I was looking at numbers and i noticed Visa has more debt then cash, but has a better revenue, mastercard has less debt but less revenue. What makes mastercard much more expensive? Like i said i own both stocks equally in $ and i just wanted insight from a pro since i am still new"
Let's break that all time high so we can all get drunk.
Headed to $300 this year
Wake me up when it breaks 200.
Half way to $150
"really smart comment...I own a bunch at split adjusted 16, smartest investment I ever made"
No doubt $MA is a great company and good bet long term .... it’s now trading at 60 x earnings which makes $V look like even better in my opinion. If Visa was trading at 60 x earnings it would imply a share price of $290 ... I probably wouldn’t advise to selling either $MA or $V but if I had to pick one to add to I think the choice is easily $V
Devastating news for visa longs was reported last night by none other Than Nordstrom.. so Walmart warned on the low to muddle class and JWN huge miss tanking over 10%ah warned on the high end..This can’t be good news for overvalued visa going forward can it ?
I hold about 20 individual securities and Visa by far is my favorite. makes money in recessions... makes money in string economies... something everyone uses but doesn't cost them any money [directly]. only 3 competitors [ma amx and d]Visa will go up forever.
new all time high!
118 is what I’m looking for.
Was think 155 by end week earlier... now I reckon 157 possible!
"Visa havent failed on earnings EVER, lets see if they can keep their record!"
Already down 1% in pre-market....
"Try living life without a credit card. Next to oxygen, food and water, it is about next."
volume is ~50% above avg
V has been froze for 30 min plusOther stocks starting to freeze up also
I'm glad that most were intelligent enough to hold on to their shares! $$$ Stay long with Visa! $$$
I'm thinking 250 and a big dividend increase up to 1%
the cream came to the top.
Why did American Express just go red ? Is it due to tanking retail sales like target ?
Credit card stocks will trade sideways until travel reopens. I'm adding shares on weakness and using V as a recovery play.
JUST HOW MUCH WILL THIS ICONIC STOCK CORRECT????????????? TA PEOPLE
"Sorry, missed the news...why are we down so much today?"
Why are institutions shorting this stock and driving the price down after they had such a good report?
it will split when it hits $300
Remember 3 days ago American Express Q1 2020 earnings beat estimates https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/american-express-axp-q1-earnings-122512259.html
Dividend will increase this fall by how much?
"Fundamentals are looking strong, according to stockFA. Looking for breakout at 145.46."
Visa is a no brainer. Best stock ive ever owned.
anything to keep you happy...
"Visa is definitely still a part of my portfolio, nevertheless MA shines brighter."
Visa and MA day charts are identical...impressive
V has bigger room to rally back than MA!
Don't take my money Trade war
Just bought 100 shares @ $211 Hope it was a good choice !
Buying more!
Trimmed my position in Visa. it has been good to me but it has been stuck for too long.
V doing it's usual thing when market is green everywhere
how much is figured into the current stock price for defaults do u think?
Buy V today; stop meeting your parents for dinner but never picking up the check in 2020. And going to a restaurant with an AARP discount doesn't count. Jeez!
Top Bullish Charts for October 2020  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
You guys are joking this is well timed attack to drive Visa a lot lower. When this is over they will find Blacks pay more for late fees and penalties and VISA will pay reparations Don't kid yourself when the Democratic media digs in Visa will be villains.
"I finally took a position with Visa after two years of watching and waiting, and it has dropped each day since. That is the story of my investing life! I'm not in the least worried in the long run, but it is daunting to constantly be reminded of the massive power you wield whereas you can affect a multibillion dollar company's market cap negatively by merely purchasing a few shares! Happy new year all!!"

Only 22¢ needed to set another 52 week high. Go Visa!
"ninety something percent of the Visa merchants, where visa gets its revenue, are out of business. In order to get back, visa gonna need to reduce it's price gouging of it's own customers. I'm a buyer, when the stock at cheaper then 120. visas got a few more dead cat bounces to go."
V's not a trading stock. It's a buy and hold.
Nobody wants to touch cash anymore.
"Visa's business is essentially selling crack cocaine to the poor. Getting them hooked on debt and spending that they will never recover. Debt, and anxiety prison. How do they sleep at night. make money on both ends, transaction and super high interest rates. The max interest rate should be no more than twice the Fed rate. This is criminal."
"I'm not sure, but this is beginning to look like a V shaped correction. Will know by end of week. As well, VISA did not warn for next quarter like MA. That's strange. VISA has more foreign exposure!!! LONG VISA since 2008"
opps that was supposed to be a comment to kevins post
Long-time V holder here... Amazon crushes it last quarter so which payment method(s) are customers using if V transactions were down according to the latest report? According to Amazon there are a number of approaches to paying for your goods and services. I just have a hard time believing that CCs aren't the #1 approach. I personally use a CC because it's simple. Just interested in thoughts/opinions here and not necessarily facts.Payment Methodshttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201894900

"Hey, Mark! The dollar plus pop on V just now must be horrifying!! Ha ha ha ha !!!"
"SHEP. HERE................................. I was reading online how V has decided to not raise prices yet to help those small businesses but I was amazed at how much V makes on a transaction. For a $100 charge, V get $1.90. That is unreal. I had no idea it was that much. They were going to raise it to 1.99 but are going to hold off on that for awhile."
Hope they raise the dividend significantly (> 12%) to put a floor under this thing

I would have thought V would get a lift going into Earnings, as it has done historically over the past 3-4 quarters, then drops off after. But V is holding up in a down day for the DOW, as well as prior days drop in DOW. Overall I think this Earnings season (due to market) trend for V is just reverse, this will jump up at least 6% after ER."

"Probe news takes nearly $18 billion in market cap off. I doubt the penalty, if anything is imposed, would come even remotely close to that kind of hit to assets.

Only 5 shares (full disclosure) but working to something larger."
"This vicious, 56 hour (market) reaction to coronavirus is absurd. How many people worldwide from other communicable diseases? Twenty-thousand? Thirty-thousand? Two-hundred thousand? How many people die from food poisoning/botulism? None of the aforementioned moves the needle on the stock market. This is madness and yet another way for the Street to exacerbate panic selling so that the very rich win the game again. Oddly, or perhaps prophetically the three biggest drops in recent history ALL happened since 2018 under the current administration and its orange occupier of the WH — who coincidentally killed off the Pandemic Response Team and lowered funding to many of our CDC’s programs. Not to mention, allowing infected passengers of a cruise back into the U.S.—— Brilliant."
My favorite stock by far! Best growth rate in comparison to risk in the market!

V will give up today’s little gain tmr! Seriously tanking from here!
Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on V? the other week https://winningpicks1.blogspot.com/ alerted this company i think. google them .
Very undervalued here
Who grabbed those shares cheap?
Visa do any one think the stock will Split￼ it would be great if it 4 ways bring in new buyers
delete all your comments and yahoo accounts based on the latest changes of Y finance
Bought at 178. Up 16%
This stock will never pass the $150 mark.
"As soon as the virus slows, the use of credit cards will skyrocket on pent up demand."
Visa has still not even reached its 52 week high. Still very undervalued.
V is on sale at this great sub $200 price!- Especially on the eve of of V reporting expected great Q4 earnings!
Buying a trip to the moon with a SPCE visa card will be here soon.
so was it a good or back quarter? Make up your mind already.
In light of the positive sentiment on this board V stock price is likely due for a pullback.
What is happening??
been trending up from IPO early this year retraced back to the 120s from 159 that was a great opportunity! Might see that at 200 again.
Love today’s price action by market makers who are making such an effort all for the upcoming tons of tailwinds!️️️

"As expected on Friday, less than normal trading volume as we approached the Memorial Day weekend. However, The MACD Line is still above the Signal Line, and for me this is the most recent trend indicator of all, IMHO. I was hoping for a bullish candlestick Friday, but we got a doji candlestick indicating some market indecision. Long-term investors don't get worried about these short-term trader values. I'm just looking for dips. However, I have no problem when Visa surfs along the upper Bollinger Band (wave as I call it)."

"Earnings are going to be solid- I’m hammering calls, being in the processing business with carry out, online and even in store in the Midwest levels are back to about 70% from levels of 40 when the shutdown started, as you all know or don’t visa makes all their money on interchange, so grocery store and any other possible “essential” business and even non essential are back to stable levels only upside from here but if you think another apocalypse is coming- then you know something I don’t and you should be shorting literally everything, just my opinion."
V is up 4.90% to 127.15
visa is going above 210 in no time for sure. the drop after earning was a hoax
$146 for this week is a target for $V
"Come on, get back to $200"
Seem like a smart play medium -long term
Easily the best investment I've ever made...wish I would have taken a second mortgage out when the IPO was issued.
At what price do you think there will be a split?
Visa is now using 100% renewable electricity through solar and wind. 
The lowest analyst price target is $216. Look at where it is now. Not many stocks trade below the lowest target.
beat?
Like my Apple  but I think I’m in on visa also .
Visa finally responding.....their share online is 3X their offline share.....they are pulling away from other credit card/online options......and they don’t have exposure to interest rate spread. I believe this one will be substantially higher by end Q1 2021.
charts say fintech is rolling over. sell upside calls or pick up September puts
142 Hit. One of the few hold forever stocks.
If this goes under 200 you best be loading up!
"Still up 30% YTD. Sticking to fundamentals of the company and ignoring the noise. Not new, we have seen this trend multiple times after a tweet."
I stole more shares of visa on Friday$$$$ Told ya!
This stock should jump at least 10 points with low interest rate by fed....
I am eagerly awaiting the European results this quarter with the weak dollar this will benefit V in the FX.
Is everyone loading up for the November dividend increase announcement?
WOW
"Hi Guys, planning to buy this stock, is there a chance that it can go down further in April?"
"Condition red, Major tank job."
Visa will easily surpass $200 this year. Shares are still cheap at these prices. I’m not selling a single share before $200 is reached. Everyone you know is swiping a card or paying with a card online.
Will V one day slowly but surely out rank MA?
Can anyone say $200 a share?
What was that all about? I've seen a 187 a few seconds ago.
"V could retest 130s, went up too fast in the last 90 days or last Q ER."
I feel very comfortable holding this stock good days and bad.
Visa being shorted?
Tech wreck tomorrow. V is a Dow Stock. We will be fine.
market manipulation AH? to let hedge fund managers a discount buy before it shots up tomorrow.
With an RSI of 44 V is very close to oversold. I see maybe one more day of this sell off and then a turn north taking us to $225-240 a share over the next 12 months. Visa is a money making machine.
"trying to figure out why such downward pressure on fintech. rotation, positioning, profit taking??"
300 by 2024
"Just a heads up, September 20-26th. Historically one of worst trading weeks of the year. Going back 70 years this week is down avg. 38%. Has to do with Friday's quadruple witching. The large brokerages have to unload all the shares they bought and sold to cover options. Just informing not trying to scare!"
Any facts on what is the actual investigation looking at?Seems BS To use V on line most times you have to go thru pay pal as guest ??Dont see the issue???

Christmas Rally ahead. Max out those cards!
"KOHLS, Nordstrom, Macys, Abercrombie and Fitch, Foot Locker etc etc all reporting dismal sales..This can't be good news for V can it and trouble in Europe also with trade and Visa Europe Affected by Recession..and the tariffs have not been done yet... Also car makers warning and JP Morgan and Citi warning on Trading..Look at Calvin Kline Hilfigger maker PVH Corp. (PVH)NYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price. Currency in USD85.28-13.97 (-14.08%)<--this is not good news.... As of 2:11PM EDT. Market open."
Visa gonna go on a tear!!! Buy buy buy!!!
"With so many creative and prominent programs, VISA Chinese market is 99.7% recovered! With vaccines, global spending power will be completely recovered and even going huger in Q1 2021!"

"Paypal up 5% on earnings. Paypal uses Visa, so you know what's coming tomorrow."
"While FB has caused a market wide lemmings fire sale, it is based on no volume accept for FB. If you look at MA for example the one time there was any after market volume it spiked way up. Therefore unless FB lemmings start a larger stampede tomorrow everything will sort out and we could still see $144-145 by Friday. Thoughts?"
"New high for Visa, 97.27. Been here since IPO congratulation to all you longs."
Shall we see green today? YES!
"Okay, due to people buying with BOTH FISTS this Christmas, decided a few shares of V are the way to go. Love to see a 20% pullback to buy much more!!!"

Red and new lows on Monday
"Visa as a business is a processor, not a card issuer. The banks issue Visa cards and the banks collect the above 10% interest rates for the cards when cardholders do not pay their bills in full each month. Visa (under the stock symbol V"" charges the businesses to process the transactions and gives the information to the banks to charge the customer. Do not blame V for high-interest rates."
Just bought a LOT more!
It's time to position yourself for the relief rally on Monday with strong follow through early next week!- The Market has bouced off its lows of the day in anticipation of that future expectation!
More vaccines equal higher share price for Visa.
"The merger is 1% of market cap haha do people even look at that before asking to buy puts or not? VISA will find other mergers and grow organically, no need to panic! HAHAH"
"http://alph.st/b1abed6a Excellent results. Maybe Visa is in red AH because of increased outlook in operating expenses for FY18. Among Visa, $MA and $AXP , Visa is a clear winner!"
Back to 180
Is it still a good buy?
When will the investors start giving up their buybacks to make this thing start moving up?
What's up with the drop? People selling off in fear of a bad report?
Beat on top and bottom. Raised dividend. Strong guidance. = Stock down.
Fasten your seatbelts 
Big buying opportunity at these levels!!
i just cant imagine anyone selling today--right before earnings
All time high today
From what I can see someone (probably a mutual fund or hedge fund) sold 7.9 million shares right at the close which caused this massive drop at the end. No worries this will recover Christmas season is coming and this is a very friendly season to Visa. GLTA
"@MichaelThe argument that the Market is overvalued is flawed, because the Market trades — not at some set historical PE multiple — but; as a “mathematical derivative” related to the current FED interest rate, and current inflation rate.- The current historically low interest rates and the absence of inflation pressures — allows for Market PE expansion.*** As long as the FED remains accommodative, and the Gov and FED keep adding stimulus, Markets will remain the only game in town.- But we know your overvalued ruse is being pushed to distract and distort a flawed message to bolster your “short trading position in V & MA stocks! Yes?"
115 next week
Harry don't use VISA and bitcoin in the same sentence please. I find it offensive.
"Down 2% is nothing for earnings. It will probably recover because of the new stimulus package. The bigger thing to be concerned about is the general state of the world economy over the next 2-3 years. Once stimulus is done, V could become a slow bleeder for the next few years."
Why is it going down today? Any news I missed?
Acually holding up fairly well today
We’re looking at a $200 stock by year end here.
bag_holders pushing each other out of the way to be first to jump off buildings haha SPLAT
Can someone explain me why visa has a 35 PE ration even if its growth is not as good as tech stocks? (no hate really want to understand because I am considering taking a new position here)
I'm here have no fear. $147 was nice but 145 even nicer
Visa will reach $300 because of online purchases for the holidays. Strong buy.
Looking very strong. If and when we get to the $300 range does anyone think it could split again?
"I think V is the best stock in the entire market. You don't have to own a retailer, you just have to own who makes money off of all of them. If you bought V at the ipo, your rate of return on the dividend is about 2% and that will only grow as V increases the dividend. I figure V will raise every year."
HitiPositive ebitda
"I don't think V will be up today or within the next few days. To many negative items and nothing to make it go up. V is making an acquisition, presidential election, negative market bias, Europe starting new covid measures just to name a few. Covid issues were reflected in a sales decrease for Visa's report yesterday. I think long term V is a good play, but pretty rocky in the short term. It's a ""buy the dip"" kind of thing for me right now."
"Huge miss on retail sales ! Supposed to be up .8%But it was not .7,.6,.5,.4,.3,.2, no it was up .1%...Hmmmmmmmm"
"There's insider knowledge inside today's price increase (+1.69%), before general knowledge of V's results to be announced after today's mkt close. ""It's not fair !"" (If you're not already a shareholder.) It is fair, given the publicity on V's short- and - medium term earnings outlook."
It's headed back up to the highs. Businesses and travel opening up. $250. You know it.
How can one person tank the stock market? This is getting so crazy just because Gary Cohn resigns stock market sinks. After they passed the tax cut they the market will be on solid ground - since February 1 it been on slippery ground.
MA is up.
Everyone that hoped and prayed for a dip here’s your chance. The share price will not be here for long. Visa will be trading over $200 before the end of this month. Fundamentals are flawless.
"The EDD issues benefit payments for Disability Insurance, Paid Family Leave, and Unemployment Insurance claims using the EDD Visa Debit Card. This prepaid debit card is a fast, convenient, and secure way to get your benefit payments and is not subject to a credit check or monitoring by the EDD. -holy moly"
That the H!!! good earning report and raise guideline. down?
Whenever I don't know what to do with my money...I park it in Visa. :)
How will shoppers make purchases on Amazon Prime Day... credit cards and debit cards!
Where's John? He always posts early on down days. Hasn't his Mom gone down to the basement to wake him up yet?
Currently the only credit card stock I own is American Express but with the news about visa how can you not own this to.
should break support at 179. see where we land on what volume but I see a solid 2-5% pullback in store over the next couple weeks
"Great company I want to get into but it is still overvalued despite the crash. A PE of 30 with these earnings, imagine the earnings in these next couple years, at this price I wouldn’t be surprise seeing a pe of 60+."
People are now demanding contactless payment options when they shop and make purchases. Visa should be trading at all time highs.
"Stole 29 shares today (I’m a kid don’t hate on small numbers). Small profit so far today, excited for the future of Visa, easily one of the most stable and dependable stocks."
bought a few yesterday
"Since the V is sitting on above 20% gain, I've set the stop loss at the 50 day MA which is around $177 and it was stopped out. Now V is below both 50 and 200 day MA, I think more downside is possible. Will get in once the solid base is set and upside is observed again."
When will V become a $1 trillion market cap?
Cherish this pull-back before V surging above 220 all the sudden! Every business in the globe is with V which is such a booming cash cow in this reopening environment+tons of dry powder!️️️
AMEX reported strong 2nd Quarter earnings!!! I expect the same from V and MA!!!
"Dejardins Coop, financial institution in Quebec, CA, just lowered it's credit card interest rate from 19.9% to 10.9%.This includes their partners Visa and mastercard cards."
"Pre-earnings manipulation at it's finest. Keeping it range bound on low volume, despite a bullish premarket. I can't wait until tomorrow."
why is V going down? people are not swiping their cards anymore? this is insane.
Pypl will surpass visa
"V has been dropping for 8 days with today a big drop. Really dont under stand why> Cant all be stimulus ? Any restraunt with outside seating is booked, malls are full of shoppers air travel slowly going up. Car travel and gas sales up? Only thing I see is how to sort out all the #$%$ news for some good facts?? people scared ?? Guess buy more time ??"
Holiday shopping season is near. Online shopping will be huge.
Maybe the big boys are done artificially holding this one down?
I will jump in if it drops to $145 per share
been holding for about 1.5 years now avg cost is 136. this correction has cut my profits in half. debating whether to buy more or find other bounce back plays. any suggestions?
"Visa is a necessity for everyday life. Food, medicine, bills, gas, etc. No matter what goes on in the world you still have to make purchases while you are alive. Use your common sense."
Closing over $200
"With the government checks coming, visa will jump back to the 200 range."
"V reported strong quarterly earnings yesterday, and reported strong guidance for the next fiscal year!!! Longs will make significant money in this stock!!!"
Buy now!
And then there is TSLAReports $4.10 loss expected $1.81 loss. up .25%??Just don't get it?
Put all of your money in Visa. Take it out of everything you invested in a put it in Visa.
This will go sub 100! World wide depression coming!
"be careful...yesterday's 10 point rise was the rumor/MA results. Today's report the news, expect a return to 170."
I dont like the sound of this anti-trust investigation. is this different from the Justice department's investigation that was announced 3 weeks ago?
Typical Democrats. Remember the hurt they put on credit cards under Obama with Dodd-Frank Act?
"buy V today, read yahoo finance and sell on the dip"
I just keep adding I love it
People are buying up Visa as if it has already announced an earnings beat. Obviously not the case. A miss tomorrow will make this tank and a beat should keep it at these levels.
Better than google and apple but why is the share price so low?
A steal @ 172!
"well, i'm rich, just dumped my weekly 210 PUTS for $20K profits, thanks again id_iots!"
"I love my Visa! I use my card for everything. I Buy food, bait, tackle, gas, Starbucks,and slim Jim’s. I hate cash. This is my crypto currency."
"Relax everyone, we've all done extremely well since Jan. 1"
This stock is so manipulated by fund managers. Us little guys have no influence on the stock.
"TOTALLY WACKY, CRAZY SELL OFF ! And yes I am shouting"
"EU banks to take on visa, Mastercard with new payments system per Reuters"
Like I said...this is a DOG! Most stingiest stock with capital gains and dividends
"$200 already here, we see 205 b4 earnings"
I may buy at $100 . Maybe........
if anything credit cards use should be increasing....everyone is buying consumer and food goods like crazy
Slow and steady...Slow and steady
V = Victory
Citibank have converted all their Visa card to Master card. Do you think this could have negative impact on Visa?
The future is plasticless and cashless. The future is mobile. Who ever adapts stays in payments business. What do you think? Many cash using countries will bypass plastic and go straight to mobile and wireless payments.

Visa deserves a $600B market cap.
Microsoft which was up big AH just went red seconds ago !hmmmmmmmm
Am I the only one bothered by the fact that this stock has been flat all year?
"v’s fair trading price should be at $245 / share — given its recent consecutive, blow out Qtrs, and considering that it should continue outperforming over the current Holiday Season — V & MA’s strongest period of their Fiscal Year.- V is trading at a very reasonable discount from fair price!"
Exiting before the earnings.. I know the earning would be fine but the short term future doesn’t look good for visa with card spends dropping
"Visa up 9 days in a row. John is currently on what the mental heath professionals refer to as ""watch""."
Bought at close....want to hold going into earnings..October 31
VISA has been loading up since August 3rd. It’s exploding on Monday!
the chart and news are screamin nothin can stop me im all the way up
Thanksgiving shoppers expected to spend over $4 billion dollars online today alone. Visa is still very cheap here!
very weak technically. 172 on the horizon.

$300 stock
Most tech stocks are trading at or above their 52 week high. Visa should be at $250 right now.
Added to my position today. I suggest all longs do the same on any dips. This will continue it's climb to $200+ by this time next year.
"If you're long on this, no need to worry. Visa isn't going anywhere but up"
ready to buy it at 170
I strongly think Visa will up to 220 at least.
"The MACD Line is still above the Signal Line. The Histogram is above the Zero Line. Betting on green, !"
Earnings are in 2 weeks and the holiday shopping season is approaching fast. Shorting Visa is not a smart move.
"Purchased 105 shares @ $55 during the IPO in 2008, needless to say I'm a happy camper. I didn't start watching the stock until after 2015 split. I'd like another split please."
Sell puts ahead of earnings? Or vertical credit spread?
Visa and MA both have dropped substantially the past 2 weeks. Honestly they are both way over sold and should get a big bounce next week.
Tumbling through earnings. Terrible company going to 75. I MAY buy there.
"very good chance to buy v, because government raise debt,Fed buy debt, the money too much,so v can reach$300 no any problems, covid-19 only temporary, it won't hurt v long-term,people use v card will continue growth,civid-19 will be good news for v long-term, people use v card buying things looks stronger than before in this covid-19 in supermarket,"
Best stock to own long term. 5 years so far and I’m doing well!
What is Cyclical Unemployment?https://www.thestockdork.com/what-is-cyclical-unemployment/
Visa will make a new all time high today. Buy now or miss out on more gains coming next week.
Coming back to lower normal price
Lot of weak holders getting out around 201.
V will be at $214 again tomorrow. It was panic sold today.
Visa will be a winner for a very long time. I always buy the dip. Holding forever.
V is up 6.96% to 162.41
"Earnings coming out in 9 days, bullish or bearish??"
"BUY it. SELL your losing positions and take up positions w/ V (and MA, PYPL, too) and then FORGET you own it. If you’re a person of savoir-faire, you will not TRADE this stock. You BUY and HOLD for a moment in time, down your path for when you’re ready for it or need it. V should be the very foundation of your portfolio... ESPECIALLY if you detest volatility. Go VISA."
Everything was closed last year
Wisdom of crowds - will earnings over deliver or under deliver? Pls vote with thumbs up vs thumbs down.

beep-beep-beep...Backing up the truck in the AM if MM allows it
Visa will close to day either close to $200.00 or $203.00 range
Thumbs up if Visa will reach $200 before the end of 2019.
P/E 45 for a non growth company ?
V reached a new All Time High at 118.54
Believe me Visa is going to break out very soon! Stay long! $$$$
the pullback :)...buy more
When is it going to breakout past $200. Been stuck between $190 and $200 for months.
My prediction says Visa will drop until $160 if the coronavirus does not clear out. Only medical stocks and gold stocks will go up.
Never base yourself on the after-hour market. Visa will fly high first thing in the morning
"went in at 180, out at 226. fun ride. ill be back at 200"
When is the dividend increase announcement coming?
I don't know why this seems to be surprising news. all endless and brokers pretty much knew whatever happened a month ago they would report lower guidance because of the Coronavirus. my opinion it's oversold and it was a lot of panic selling but now is a good price to add more
MC earnings were a 30 % jump. Hope V does same or better.
this thing needs to go. unreal.
New high coming today.
this is scary.....quite a serious drop over 2 days.
Is buying Visa a mistake?
will Visa invest in Bitcoin???
New all time highs loozas!
"Why did i sell this at 132?? I feel so dumb, 1 week later they hit a new 52 week high. I guess ill wait for the dip"
Visa reports good numbers$$$$$
"never listen to analysts, they dont know anything"
"I'm starting to believe if Amazon is doing good, Visa and Mastercard will do good. Weak forecast from Amazon, result weak Visa. What do you think? Thanks."
"David,Here you go. Now stop calling us you people. Don Cherry was just labeled a racist for that. It might also help if you read the financials like the rest of us. Even after its 35% rise in the last year, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) could deliver further capital growth. The global electronic payments specialist has strengthened its competitive position through acquisitions, while its expansion into new services could boost its financial prospects."
Wow! I'm going to cash in on this panic selloff. What a bunch of lemmings!
v or ma? Only enough money for one.
Why the drop?
Just bought some V. Hoping it'll make up for my GE loss (GRRR).
Hey John you were wrong! Look how much money I made since I got in!
MA reports contactless payments surge 40%....
"Just in time for Christmas , it is buying season , *I know what my grand daughter will get , V , AAPL , MSFT , HD"
i thought most sold into the strength last quarter and up to today it looked the stock was being bought back.
it's gonna pump up tomorrow.
"Surge in consumer spending. U.S. economy grew 4.1% in second quarter. V is down again today, but so is the entire payment industry, MA, PYPL, SQ...etc. Horrible week for most investors, hopefully just a dip here!"
I’m hoping for a bit of correction tomorrow. Would love to buy more lower.
Just another day in the office:-)
"Shares of American Express tumbled nearly 3 percent in after-hours trading. The financial services company beat analysts' expectations on earnings for its second quarter, posting $1.84 per share versus the estimated $1.82 per share. However, American Express missed analysts' revenue estimates, generating $10 billion versus the $10.05 billion that was expected. The company saw a 21 percent rise in net income year over year amid growth in member spending and fees."
Yahoo cant do simple math. Closed at 134.26 and AH closed at 136.50 meaning gain AH is 2.24 not 1.74
Is there a hope for recovery in the next few weeks? or it just a start of a bear market?

"Recall how the AI Algo's search for popular stocks--- that's where the money is--to shake you out, then tear back up; --- buy the dip---we all know big Bitcoin / Visa plans are in the making."
it could possibly be institutions just trying to shake out weak hands before the Market opens?
I feel another 2-for-1 split coming.... anyone here guess what price they'll announce it?
"3% eps beat, looking good"
I’m an IPO holder. Not seen good results after earnings but happy with the stock.
"I totally miss the old finance page layout, it had so much more to offer...Why fix something that is not broken?"
Visa should be trading over $220 by now
Not even at the 52 week high yet
bam
Visa will reach $300 this year. Spending is gradually getting better and it will continue to improve. Smart money is buying Visa now while the share price is low. You don’t want to wait until everything is completely better. You will miss the upside.
Price targets range from a low of $175 to a high of $231 from 36 different analysts.
"Visa left in the dust again. Cmon visa let’s get some corporate action over here, expand the business, innovate, do something"
Buying Visa now is like taking candy from a baby! $$$$$
Target is $157.

"Hello Fellow Visa investors, I wanted to open a discuss regarding the growth of differences in Visa vs. MasterCard.I am invested in both companies, yet, when I compare the graph charts of both over the last 5 years, I notice MasterCard is outpacing Visa. Mastercard up 106% and Visa up 84%.........As mentioned I am invested in both, yet, I am not sure why Mastercard Stock is growing faster than Visa's.......can anyone explain this to me. Thank you in advance."
"$8.5B buyback in 2019. $3.5B in dividends.he Visa board has authorized a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 for the first quarter of fiscal '19. In line with our dividend policy, this puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range. In fiscal '18, we completed additional buybacks to neutralize the impact from stock issued to Visa Europe owners as part of the acquisition. In fiscal year '19, we anticipate buying back at least $8.5 billion of Visa stock.Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending plan, free cash flow from operations is anticipated in -- to be in excess of $13 billion. Most of this free cash flow will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fiscal '19, we anticipate returning at least $11 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks"
Dow within 150 all time high. Visa within 10 all time high. Lookin good. Feelin good.
Another nice day. I figure this is the best stock in the entire market. From the ipo day untl now has been fantastic.
shall we see 185 soon!
$220 Jan 2021 calls are perking up a little. almost back to even for me.
"I have MA, V, and PYPL. That's my finance and tech stocks."
"UPS beat earnings due to increased online demand, this means increased spending in the marketplace, meaning there is a good chance Visa beats earnings."

Anyone seen Johnny boy. Too busy dealing with the debt collectors is it?
it's got to shake out one min it's way up another it's down.
Based on 21 analysts offering 12 month price targets for V in the last 3 months. The average price target is $197.81 with a high estimate of $225.0
ok visa get the led out lets move
when are earnings and what do you all expect afterwards
"AH showing $2 red.On the plus side, BMO capital maintained outperform adn increased PT to $196 from $186.I'd be happy if it reaches $150"
Visa should have passed $200 months ago. This price is very cheap. Strong buy!
Why are u RED?
"tired of playing games with this stock, been holding for 1.5 yrs, bought at 70. I want this to close at 150 a share by end of year, no exceptions"
I remember $50 ipo and holding until recession and selling for loss at $43 lol
No one wants to use dirty physical cash right now.
Stimulus is coming in visa prepaid cards. Huge gains for tomorrow. Will be a very nice day. I see at least 5% price up tomorrow. Longs be with you.
"Almost 30% of today's volume was bought at close for 171.32... That was the big boys jumping back in for earnings after fleecing the sheep to sell low, constantly undercutting the sell price with 5-10 share sales."
V is showing refuse to sink
"If you buy V now or tomorrow and simply FORGET about it, it will be the HERO of your 2019, 2020 and beyond portfolio."
Buy V today. Stop dreaming about retiring to travel the country pulling a Gulfstream and make it happen!
Back to $220 in 2 weeks.
Wish the POTUS would stop messing around with the market already.
Road to $200...
Sold @ that price. Up too much too fast. This price is not sustainable! This is not over yet. Not even close!
bag_holders still having a good morning? xoxo
what a diamond
Black Friday sales result will make this sky rocketed!
Oppenheimer reiterates “buy” and sets price target to $212 (updated 10/29)
V is the best stock ever. ^^^^^
We may need to pass the hat for Satnam and Vincent. They seem to not recognize a good report when they see one.
Buy after brutal earnings report in 7 days.
"Stock split is old fashion and in not the best way to increase the values. Only buy back and increase the dividend is the best way increase the value..Visa, had split one time 1 to 4. That enough. I wish is never split is must better in term of quality stock holder. Sorry for offence someone but it is true facts."
Glad I got in at open for 200 more....nice movement today!
Heading to $220 by end of next week! The spending is only going up! Look at all the online orders!!
"Way oversold. Loaded up on weeklies, easiest $$$."
"I have own v for five years now .. never sold or traded .. it is just a hick up ,"
Easily a $1000 stock in the next decade
Strong like ox
Is this is anyone’s long term portfolio. I.e. beyond 5 years?
"what could be better ? un employment at a 50 year low , everyone that wants to work has a job , everyone feels rich and Christmas is right around the corner , everything sold online needs a card , keep on staying low"
225 easy after earnings if it can keep going on that beautiful run
Will hit new 52 week high today!!!
hold forever
"If cryptocurrencies become mainstream and are actually usable at some point in the future, does this help, hurt, or have no effect on Visa and Mastercard? Would Visa be able to work with bitcoin and do business together?"
Why is there so much resistance for both V and MA these days?
Good to jump in now.
Beat and beat.
"Long term holder since IPO. Where will Visa be in five years....cashless society, crypto.... I know very few people that don’t hold a VISA card. Hopefully a double in a few years from now."
I bought Visa when it dipped down to 206. Finally some movement. feels good.
Bottom $175
"Next stop,,,, 100 !!!!!"
"Visa set to breakout.Visa Inc (NYSE:V)The 35 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Visa Inc have a median target of 234.00, with a high estimate of 270.00 . The median estimate represents a +13.59% increase from the last price of 206.01."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-visa-172008709.html
"Jun2021 puts are very cheap. V is trading at 16X sales, it's previous peak ratio. A $100 Jun2021 put is just $4. When V's market cap returns to under 10X sales, this $4 put will be $20 to $40 in value. 10-bagger option opportunity boys."
Visa will drop today. Always after earnings it goes backwards. Then in a week it will go up a little and then back down.
Well they raise the 1yr target
Quite confused how V can trade at +30x earnings while growing at 10%.
Hopefully MA crushes morning
"The company posted net income of $2.4 billion, or $1.07 a share, down from $3.1 billion, or $1.37 a share, in the year-prior quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.06 a share, whereas analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $1.03 a share.Visa’s revenue fell to $4.84 billion from $5.84 billion, while the FactSet consensus called for $4.82 billion. Payment volume dropped 10% for the quarter, while cross-border volume was off 37%. Excluding intra-Europe transactions, cross-border volume fell 47%."
Visa is a very nice long position and helps balance out my tech stocks.
Fedx warned huge tanking pre market and dsw warned huge yesterday..DSW - DSW Inc.NYSE - NYSE Delayed Price. Currency in USD22.09-3.27 (-12.89%)<——-hmmmAt close: March 19 4:00PM EDT
V is going to skyrocket after earnings.
VISA beats on revenues and earnings. $1.47 vs $1.43 expected. Revenues $6.137BN vs $6.08BN expected.
$VReinstates Sanford Bernstein Outperform USD 232 Downgrades KeyBanc Sector Weight
Retailers are selling off !the container store pier one etc hmmmmmm
l bought this stock at IPO for $59 and change 1000 shares. Split 4/1 for 4000 shares currently. You do the math. This is a generational buy and will soon be worth millions. Generation to generation long term hold.
I would not be selling stocks like V to take profits or to roll into banks. this is a $200 stock people
Does it make sense for Visa to just outright do a leveraged buyout of SQ ?
"After AXP best on their earnings, thumbs up if you think Visa will easily beat on this quarters estimates."
Glad I got in at 159. What's in my pocket? V
Have some guts and close 200
"Hello to all,Like i said the V is slowly but surely increase the value. If you look for quick money at Visa then you are so wrong...Go somewhere else with your junky comments. Good day to all long,"
Unusual patterns for Visa today
9.5 billion dollar buyback
I could have bought at 131. I reached home it was too late :( even at 132 I will buy.
I have added Visa to my portfolio and bought 60 at $179.
Saw that coming 1 mile away...
cant beat Visa
Someone sure worked to knock that down $2 at the end of the day
Only if I wasn’t a poor person...11 shares @ $153 sad face
Why is the price dropping today?
"Amazon, UPS ramping up the hiring for holidays. They expect the consumer to be spending. They spend with credit cards. I think visa will be immune from rotation out of big tech. I’m expecting a bounce back."
"In my opinion, if Amazon is worth 1k+, then VISA is worth 1k+ per share within 10 years.And VISA pays a dividend. I wish people would stop comparing cryptocurrency hysteria scams to VISA. Until I can get cryptocurrencies from a legit bank / see them in a protected account, I refuse to consider bitcoin a legit currency."
Tim I bought in 2008 at the IPO and again 2009. Sold have my shares earlier this year. For me I had too much value in one stock.
"Visa fiscal Q4 revenue $5.43 billion vs $4.86 billionOct. 24, 2018 at 4:15 p.m. ET by Sue ChangBreakingVisa fiscal Q4 earnings $1.23 per Class A share vs 90c per Class A shareOct. 24, 2018 at 4:15 p.m. ET by Sue Chang"
"Thought higher interest rates were good for financials. Rates going to 1.75% , oh my. Get out of stocks and bonds. Rush right in and get a one year CD for 2%. Yeah, that's the ticket. Also, WE MUST test the lows. Is that a state or federal law? We MUST?"
I think Visa earnings on Thursday are going to be huge. Everyone is charging on credit cards in this pandemic online and nobody is paying them off. They are just paying the minimums and will never pay them off. Why has the priced gone down $7 this week? Anyone please share your thoughts on earnings also?
Good price point for new shareholders
Article posted about V possibly reaching the 1 trillion club....we all can dream 1 day right? :) https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-comma-club-predicting-next-175845706.html
I dont think the MM let it get to 180 this week...of course I've been wrong before
"Could close positive. If so, should continue to go up into earnings. Looking like but the do was a great move."
Give your trading account a boost with solid picks delivered once a week by (http://Pick-stocks.com). These guys completely changed the way I look at winning in the markets.
$8.5 Billion share buyback announced this afternoon along with stellar earnings.On the road to $200 a share in 2021.
looks like visa will get a good price for there stock buybacks
"Hedge funds selling V in the name of so called Rotation is comfortable buying high PE stocks like ROKU, LULU, CMG and others. V, MA and other fintech stocks are undisputed leader for the future. If online shopping is the future, so are these fintech stocks."
MA down big. Stick with V!!!
"V up 45% in 2017, look for similar results in 2018."
"Will be v interesting to see if we can break and hold above 206 tomorrowWould be a good sign we are heading back to 210 plusImo it will happen, bear a market crash, by end of month"
Visa is essential to make purchases at home. How are you going to buy the things you need? Cash? Visa should have never traded down this far.
They got ya agin didnt they
Online payments are the new normal.
$300 stock in 2021
"v can reach$275 if fed cut more rates, because people use card Will continue growth. virus won't affect it,"
V is the best stock in my portfolio !
Market is in a 5-10 % correction. Owned Visa since IPO. Solid stock and will see plenty of upside with holiday season approaching.
What about all the companies that are circumventing the interchange model. This is crushing to Visa’s partner banks. I mean if I can pay with Venmo the merchant does not incur interchange fees. What merchant wouldn’t want that!
V is winner in long run.
Will it hit $200 a share tomorrow? What’s your thoughts?
smart money buying today! $$$$$$
It’s still not even trading above the lowest price target.
Down for absolutely no reason!
I think the funds are going to play some games with Visa....more so then they had been doing
"Visa Debit Bitcoin cards. Great idea, happy to hear about it."
Went thru the earnings call/slides and read the results. Everything looked good. No reason for selloff other than some day traders or algos doing what they do. Fundamentally revenues and earnings beats/results were exceptional. Guidance was strong plus they likely sandbagging as always. A gift to add more if you don't have full position yet down 8 bucks from after hours 142+ pop (which seemed like the correct move).Pouring over everything I didn't see any data points that would have me selling any shares. Also even if Visa had a soft quarter whether from macroeconomic headwinds or execution it's hardly a reason to sell the stock when you have a multi-decade outperformer here as the move from cash to digital is still early innings in both developed and emerging markets.
Whole markets down today. No worries for V. Solid stock.
:( I wish I could sell my calls right now
AH: WTH????
Today likely to be a GREEN day... this better be above 180!
Good luck with that Kroger.... people will just go where they can use their Visa cards duh
I guess no one believes the governments +33% up
it's gonna go up... don't know the revolut deal?
"Visa will be $250 by the end of April at least. With the economy rebooting and stores starting to re-open, spending will increase. Along with the fact that unemployment is down and people are generating more income, Visa is bound to rise."
It seems like Visa is slowly trying to become more involved with crypto. I like that they aren't rushing in. Does anyone understand how they make money with these crypto credit cards? Do they make money on the initial transaction and then again for the exchange into a different currency?
these next couple of quarters are a great time for people like me to accumulate. I'm fine with it hitting new lows. let's go baby
American Express missed.
"Analysts wrote a report to drag down the price, I just don’t believe it. There’re a lot of junk reports outside there...."
it's just a matter of time before visa makes a crypto announcement then it's going off
Hoping to see this to 200+ !
All time high this month
How much would this stock be after the election?
V will hit new high and BREAK OUT this week. V should break out around 3-4 pts. So I think V may test resistance at 105.
I am long V but has anyone noticed how quiet it has gotten here at the conversation section? V will do well but hopefully it stabilizes here.
Sold all visa today and took profit! Will see how V does over rest of the month. Would buy back on a nice dip if possible
bag_holders having their money flushed again
We need to break out of this resistance area. Strong buy here!
Should be a beat
We need to acquire Plaid. I'm really hoping for this deal to work out.
And we have 90!!!

"Why would v be the one paying the interchange law suits when the issuers are the ones that received the actual interchange. For example, why is Cap One calling it earned rewards when in fact nothing is earned, it is just a higher cost to the merchant for exactly the same card. The reward to the cardholder is at the cost of the merchant. I wonder how many people know how interchange actually works."
Going back above $200
Anything yet ?
Visa (V) reported 1st Quarter December 2017 earnings of $1.08 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.98 per share on revenue of $4.8 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.01 per share.
Any reason why we’re almost down $3 after hours?
All the time high rates strong consumers
If you believe in President Trump then you will be buying into this great opportunity! $$$$$ Visa long and strong! $$$$
Huge options volume August $150 calls / Sept $145 Calls
Undervalued
Wonder if John still has his 168 short?
Fid chart for V appears to be working in active trader pro and giving correct price put cant place trade
"With strong results, why it's going down after market?"
here we go again
Big Day for Visa mañana. Both AmEx and MasterCard’s strong ER’s is a good harbinger for VISA andd de what’s to come on ER.
"VISA Dropping to these levels down 3%, and MA dropping 4% because of AAPL or China slowing is way overdone. Remember everyone was talking about huge Holiday Sales. Also if you look at casino traffic in Macau it was up 16% YOY. So do not tell me China is slowing. All BS....AAPL id down because the gov't in China is punishing AAPL in retaliation for Huawei...in other words, Tim Cook is either lying or in denial this is specific to AAPL targeted by China."
"This dip is the fortuneThanks to the agility and creativity brought in by the CEO from former AXP, V has been growing even faster in this environment!️️️"
I think everyone is done wetting their pants about money getting shifted. Holding strong above 109 for some time
I would love to see a bullish candle where we close convincingly above $203 at the top of the range
"Visa reports tomorrow after market closes, I expect strong revenue and profit beats, the economy has been opening up, retails sales was strong and Visa comparison to same qtr last year should be a positive. I predict Visa finally gets over $240 after ER, if agree.....Thumb Up?"
let us see $200 !!
as per past weeks 15 days trend trend V 177 to 180
AmExp and PyPal both beats on both top and bottom lines....guidance positive. I think V and MA should move up tomorrow and next week. OPINION VOTE PLEASE: The question does this strong performance bode well for V and MA or does it hurt as they are competitors. What has history told us? Thumb Up if positive for V and MA OR Down if Hurts.
good range to add more.
"Hopefully, we have seen the bottom?"
Buy buy buy
MOJO RISING
I am not surprised if it’s heading back to green or even close Green today!
So who is just holding no matter what?
"Yaaaaa,It is Green now."
$190 is the average price target
new all time highs every week.best stock on the exchange. low profile but delivers year after year.
V is currently trading in the oversold zone!!!***
"level II 236,12"
There is huge selling volume at the end.....not sure why so much planned selling from hedge funds? I thought V should benefit from the reopening of the world at some point this year?!
"Mastercard just got approved to operate in China, this news should boost V as well."
This should be a $200 stock already. Extremely undervalued here.
New all time highs today loozas!
If you're waiting for a pullback you won't get it. Share buybacks will hold the stock up and keep it moving higher. Buy Visa now or miss out.
I GIVE UP . This thing can hardly go to 170 . bought it at 171.9
got this at 60and not selling!MM buying in every dip!
195!? ENORMOUS buying opportunity for the astute and long player.
Visa’s Incentives to Banks Examined by Justice Department per Bloomberghttps://newsfilter.io/articles/visas-incentives-to-banks-examined-by-justice-department-7255a73533b6c1720660b086eb623996
Buy the dip. Digital payments are replacing cash.
Broke 196 in after hours at 196.20
V is one to own. The market is trading growth for value right now.
You know everyone will be using credit cards now. V has to go up from here.
Visa or MA?
Man really thought it would hold the prior low..
Rising with good volume. A break of 139.90 could move it up to 163.40. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/V.gif
Don’t be shocked if visa goes down after earnings. It doesn’t make its gains during earning season.
Yay! We're red.....for a minute I thought we were to break a habit of a lifetime...Back to normal business.Results have nothing to do with the stock market
"I so badly want to get in on visa, but I think the price is way too steep. I could be wrong. If Trump is able to continue market moving upward I may get in for long hold"
Visa will do well with new tax law
already drop alot from 20x+....should going to strong supporting level
Everyone is swiping their Visa cards today!
@john hey little johnny how is that short position working out for you! Hahaha! amateur! Visa long and strong! $$$$$
Time to buy.
“Russia ready to switch off Visa & Mastercard ahead of tougher US sanctions“n response to sanctions Russia has developed its own national payment system. The Mir payment system was introduced in 2015 after clients of several Russian banks were temporarily unable to use Visa and Mastercard due to US sanctions. Customers found bank issued credit cards linked to Visa and Mastercard systems no longer worked. The country issued 37 million Mir cards as of June 2018.
Stop spamming this board with your trashy websites. Let's go Visa
going lower
I exited Visa for good at 218. Good Luck gentlemen.
"Futures calling for a green open on the market. Obviously, that can change, but assuming it’s green, then V is breaking $140 and heading north!"
"Visa has better earnings % than MA, MA has been fined 650 million dollars. V is down and MA is up? Explain that one."
Great news How do you spell Crash?
The upside potential for V just got a whole lot more interesting. I started receiving notifications from awesomeS-TOCKS the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
$230 price target
This is the best of the reopening trades. Don't know why it doesn't get talked about more often. Throw in the crypto cards that will be issued in Q2 it should have a great second half of the year. I'm getting the Bitcoin rewards card. Give me that coin!https://blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/?r=hvB4V
"Hey, settle a marital dispute. I say DRIP V's divies, my husband says take the cash."

"Here's one of John's posts from last month from the Tesla board:""shorted this sc_am 341.20 500 shares thank you so much mor_ons!""AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!UH-OH!"
Clueless traders constantly jumping in and out of great stocks to chase the quick buck.
Going up. Easy money here.
"The elephant in the room is the uncertainty of the severity of supply chain disruption out of China and it's impact overall on the market. China has mismanaged the COVID-19 since the beginning. Japan further screwed things up with the handling of the Diamond Princess. You can say the seasonal flu kills more people each year, True, but we have never been 90% dependent on one nation before for our goods. Folks, we are in for a ride at least until the end of this year. You'll have excellent opportunity to pick up some fantastic stock bargains, including V. I'm not selling, but let's not stick our heads in the sand about how big an impact supply chain disruption out of China is to our overall economu - flu or no flu."
Conference call must have stunk.
"Target tanking huge ah !Lowe’s tanking huge ah !Kohl’s tanking huge ah !Follows amazon Walmart and Williams Sonoma This can’t be good news for overpriced v can it as the wealth effect of a falling market causes everyone to cut spending.,,"
Both! I like to hold V & MA for long periods of time but when I see storm clouds on the horizon I become a trader.No reason to go down with the ship. Last time I got out of V @ $192.
"Alright, Visa. I'm a shareholder, and as a shareholder, I request the company please include the target price on the mobile homepage, like it used to be. Thank You. :)"
Flat?
Credit Suisse just upgrade price target to $265 in next 6 months
Does anyone know how much it was split before or have an guesstimate when it will split again?
People have stopped using the cards otherwise they would not they would not say revenue will be impacted! Hate to say it but not all the world sits and looks at Amazon all day! People still swipe that card at brick and mortar stores like Starbucks! Well that was until Coronavirus!
200 by next earning? Next earning seems to be very good!
"If this is true, they need to fire CEO and charge him with something. Us shareholders own this company. Let's not stand for this. We're not Wells Fargo."
Solid quarter for a solid company. Expecting similar results for MA.
Going into earnings Visa will reach $250
"Got in at the IPO and am long for the ride. If I had known it would be this good, I would have sold my plasma just to buy more."
"Hello ALL short SH's in on V your time is coming. I've watched you guys manipulate this stock heavy for the last 5 years. this stock should be well over 300 by now. We want our money, and We want it now..."
1.46 eps meeting expectations. Can't find the revenue yet
Heading to 150
Been waiting for a pullback. Started a position today at 169. Don't buy all at once.
187$ is ATH.it can be done.it is Vs 4tg qtr.
Why is it so hard to break the 180 resistance?!
You know I would be happy about this but if it follows the trend it will down to 197 again tomorrow
Visa was trading over $200 for all of January and most of February. This price is still cheap.
Visa holds up very well during down days. We will blow thru $150 next week.
Can't believe there are 40 million shares short on V. Are they stupid? Just crazy.
we added short 179 friday to our existing 185-187 shorts. wanna thank everyone here for your support!
Can someone explain the Cramer Christmas Eve trade? How much does it go up usually over last 10 yrs?

Our calculations also showed that V ranked 5th among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings).
Deutsche Bank raised it's price target on Visa to $270 from $220
all this money is making me think about retiring to my future beach house
"i hold visa shares,and while i am frustrated with the slow growth as opposed to the market,i am in this for the long haul,and am quite confident of a nice profit; Just cuz Mark keeps bringing up all these retail sufferers,he seems to forget all the people who have switched to online buying,WITH their Visa! Where do these guys come from???"
any reason why this is weak?had this since 60 will keep loading up
V will make you a millionaire if you hold it long enough.
"Who here goes to a coffee shop/bakery, etc and does multiple transactions with your debit card to support Visa??? :) Good luck to everyone today...even a slight drop should not deter investors although V is priced for perfection already."
Remember Costco takes Visa and not the other card companies! Costco is busier than ever
why is it down? I didn't see any bad news.
Great Beat on Earnings! Tomorrow opening bell predictions? Could be a lot more volume if this news attracts the day traders pre-market. Interesting Friday morning tomorrow
is this weak due to the contactless form of payments???or due to the break up with PLAID?
The new Venmo credit card is a Visa card
Buyers will come in like swarms. Don’t worry!
"Tomorrow is Wednesday May 01, 2019.Another new high for Visa.."
"Based on early high volume, blame the algos. Talk this morning about some 10 sigma event occurring overnight, but never found out what that was. Rotation is not enough of an excuse for this selloff after V has been trading in such a narrow range for the last month relative to today's move.Bottom line, I think the algos are wrong and this is a rare dip buying opportunity for V."
The upside potential for V just got a whole lot more interesting. This is so frustrating trying to find trade ideas. I've subscribed to some email newsletters which helps me with new stock ideas. https://winningpicks1.blogspot.com/ is the one i like best.
this is one of the least volatile stocks. had it's advantages and it's disadvantages.
"Visa has so much going forward with partnerships, acquisitions and expanding its global footprint. In the past 5 years the stock has more than tripled. As long as the economy stays afloat, Visa will continue its upward trajectory."
"So the new and improved board yahoo forced us all to use still has total spammers like Mark on here that they will not remove apparently, no matter how many times I report him. Thank Yahoo, we expect nothing less from you than total not giving a damn about your users."
V will close green today.
Does someone know something like China is letting MA in and excluding V? What would explain this price action??
"Our day will come. Expecting a great ER, with all on-line sales during holiday not thinking it'll miss."
Easy 200.00 by end of year..
"Love Trump giving us all these discounts, just to have the market rebound over and over and over again. Buy those dips! Go Visa! Trump 2020!"
"This pullback has created a great opportunity for investors to buy V & MA on the very cheap— as we look forward to 12 to 30 months of easy and highly beatable, “year over year comparisons for the dynamic duo!!!*** Some folks will be looking backward at these amazing cheap prices for the awesome “gift  horse” buying opportunity!"
"BUY BUY BUY! When people buy stuff on Black Friday & Cyber Monday, VISA profit big time!"
"Looks like support is at around $200...consolidation probably will begin and depending on market conditions, V will march higher. It happened last year when it was around $180+ for a few months. Stay the course and be patient :)"
"Understand the payment system in US before buying. India, China, Sweden already cashless societies. WeChat, AlliExpress in China going around the card system. Visa margins of 61% is unsustainable in near future. New tech allows for consumers and businesses to no longer pay Visa absurd fees, it's a broken system in US to take a cut for the transfer of money between parties. Will not last."
Any word from Visa? Obviously they'll deny any wrong doing but it would be nice to hear it from them.?
No worries with this stock whatsoever. Get it and forget it.
$200 by the end of this week
"MA getting into China, hopefully Visa will too"
I’m down 100 dollars
"On the full chart, looks like this is the biggest dip in visa history"
let us see 210!
So glad i sold at 143$. Too bad i didn’t sell at 150. Same with MA. Sold at 210. Its a blood bath. I will be back when the time right
will be an interesting day. pretty much a guessing game at this point.
Earnings are out!! they beat by 3 cents and 4 cents from the estimates
people are at home shopping using their visa card...look at the tiolet paper sales alone using plastic )
Back to all-time highs this morning... Nearly a 10-bagger since going public just a decade ago. Wish I knew then what I know now.
Should be even more of a boom for fin tech. Less cash changing hands and more online transactions.
kaka hello shorties...just start..like I mentioned surely and steady increases is the Visa way...quick money and day traders ..good luck..not Visa
V is a long holding and you can have good sleep on it! Bought at 2009 for 17.70 up more than 900%.
this thing has had 0 gains since january. I'm out guys.
Yes V q1 result will be bad.so what? The fact visa is still growing strongly does not change. just one more buy opportunity. Visa is like to be a trillion company in 20 years.
Very smart acquisition!
Visa will reach the all time high now
"CAVO, remember when they hit over two hundred before and they split. I see the same thing when they hit the 250 mark."
"the government send money boost workers wages raise very strong, ,people staying at home save a lot of money, so after covid-19 finished, people spend money will surge, V earnings will surge too, V earnings very good in March quarter, so V worth $250 now,"
I think V is set to roll. With Visa Europe coming on board this is a 250.00 stock in an 85.00 suit !
shep!!! love that your here as well. loloo. you do your grocery shopping at Walmart today?
This V stock is going to pop today. You should of bought yesterday went it was down. Looking good today and the rest of the year. Everyone has a visa credit card and the just saying the holiday are coming. 150.00 easy
I expect a great quarterly report for Visa!!! GO V GO!!!
V reached a new All Time High at 138.73
Buy today or tomorrow? Earnings are after close tomorrow correct?
Up today!
Headed back to $220
i want about 5 more days like today VISA
Will v give all of yesterdays gains back and then some. Will it matter after the bell?HRTX is going to fly today with ALLK and DNLI.
Interesting twist: MLB StL Cardinals going cashless as part of re-opening Covid plan this year. Will it become permanent? Are other venues doing similar?
Buy back at Dow 20k
Why is Visa dropping?
Rockets higher as the economy restarts this week and goes over $200. Headed to $250 by year end.
Buy low... Sell high
"For all those disbelievers out there, do you really think a mammoth company the size of Visa will stand by and let a DOJ investigation effect their bottom line? This is deliberate move of a large short seller attempting to get in cheaper. This happened with every large cap stock when someone wants to buy your shares on the cheap"
Can anyone share. I bought about 900 shares about two weeks ago. 165. It’s now 177. Would you buy more.
"Tell me again, why was Visa raising their fees in the first place?"
Wow! This stock usually is a steady climber. To get online this morning and see it go over 171 was fun.Long since day one. Went all in. Sold a bunch of mutual funds to buy Visa IPO. So glad.
New all time high today?
V is going to pull up fast. A historical trend. Buy at discount.
"Hoping for a little pullback so I can buy more, but doubt it happens"
When can we expect a pull back ?
"WE will close today over $230, we had strong momentum touching $230, then people decide to start selling....why?"
"Adjusted earning came in at $1.47 per share, beating estimate by 4 cents. Sales came in at $6.137 Billion, beating estimate by $57 Million. This is a 12.94% increase over sales of $ 5.434 Billion the same period last year."
Why is it falling like a rock now? Anyone listen to the call....
"Retail is up, jobless claims are down will Visa go up?"
"Buy V today, buy a house near your parents in 2020!"
MA up .41% today. V can't move up yet for reasons unknown.
Massive share buybacks
Visa should be trading over $200. Very undervalued here.
"V has already been in China, listen to conference call"
this is everywhere ah trading
We are going to a cashless society. This stock is a bargain right now. Wish I would have bought more at the low.
Why is this down more than MA? It just does not make any sense
RIP bag_holders
"I normally don't hold stocks for very long, a lot of buying and selling but I like Visa since its a stock I don't have to worry about. Just let it sit and it will steadily gain and won't ever drop much."
"Will be around 190.00 by Friday.... :) Nibble, nibble!"
"Visa is a powerhouse financial company. Although the market is shaky, this will pay off HUGE."
Why is this dropping?
V is going to surge up!
"Let me tell you why all the negative press is BS. Because they had an earnings beat with lower volume which means that they did more with less. If volume had been higher, earnings would’ve been out of this world...instead of just awesome."
"V is the sleeping giant, this company has so much future hidden potential"
what were the major banks credit card earnings? that is the tell
Trading at 40+ PE and all the competition from the new Fintech...I would be careful here
Shall we see 180 by end month and maybe 200 by earning!
Price target upgrades coming
Guys i would like to invest in this company. Do i wait for 120? Or lower? Not too sure
GE has done better than V over the last 2 days! Madness!
Quality company no stress about day to day dips
Another new all time high today
How’s that $200 target working for everyone who has been screaming for it all year?
I can finally exhale
Will the dividend be doubled?
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-visas-401k-offer-is-better-than-a-splashy-1000-bonus-2018-01-09
Can’t wait for bounce tomorrow!
V is having a V-shaped recovery...get in ....dont be left out.
"More Americans are defaulting on their credit cards: analystBy Gregory Bresiger August 11, 2018 | 10:20pm | Updated"
$190 baby . LONG VISA
"Some good news today for Visa shareholders. Tariffs on several consumer goods will be ""delayed"" until December 15th 2019. OK Big V, start moving once again in the upper channel as you usually do."
Why down big?
All time high!
145 by the end of the week
"V, MA, PYPL, MSFT are near monopolies with a long runway worldwide. They have huge profit margins plus economies of scale. Revenue growth steady, ut margins could increase with economies of scale. As long as the jobs, consumer ok, they will keep on spending. Not much volatility. Wonder what V folks do all day. Is runs by itself."
moo ka-ching. moo ka-ching. visa is a cash cow.
10% increase in quarterly profit? I’ll take that. Buying more if this is still dipping.
Visa never die.
Bucking the trend again as investors get out of overinflated FAANG and into safer stocks.
Wonder if Keybanc will change yesterday's downgrade? lol
New stimulus plan and reopening will push Visa to $300 this year
"In a market down day, everyone buys V, MA and utility."
"Airlines are booked up for months. Travel has returned. Hotels, plane tickets, rental cars, etc. $300 price target"
All these banks are hitting new highs and V and MA should be as well. But there both down again. V should be over $85 by now. Makes no sense they are down. I'm not worried as these are 25+ year holds. Just frustrating at the moment.
I'm so glad that there's no manipulation in the market...
"Stock moving, but options not moving much"
"Visa and MasterCard will continue on an upward trajectory until they have saturated the market with their credit cards. I never believed I would prefer a credit card over cash, but I think that day has arrived. With the introduction of square and online shopping surpassing brick and mortar, credit cards ARE the way to go. Plus they provide security and flexibility you just don't get with cash. I've had both visa and MasterCard, and by far prefer visa. As long as they continue to grow, ill keep my shares. They are a money making machine!"
"No news is good news for Visa. I’m very long here, however we could under pressure for a few weeks until we get more clarity on the DOJ investigation and hopefully some pushback from Visa’s lead counsel. Keeping with my bull case conviction"
really? profit taking or weak hands
This accumulation with the support @208 is for the upcoming rally! We will see V above 220 this week!
"Once again, yahell finds yet another way to fk up a one-car funeral. Another new and unimproved format change. Pure geniuses....NOT. Their CEO needs to be fired for incompetence. She's actually even worse than Gerry Yang...didn't seem possible."
All time high coming today
time to load for tomorrow
Kroger. Couple things I’m specific about. Don’t patronize restaurants that serve Pepsi. And now who don’t accept V.
All time highs are coming
Rotation still working itself out. I'd be surprised if the stock wasn't back to $180+ within two weeks of the qtr. report.
Bought more for the long run.Long with the institutions. GLTA.
"Boeing is tanking and the catastrophe will reverberate throughout the massive travel industry resulting in a loss of spending by the jet set impacting v and causing it to go red today up 1.06 to 148.41 I say it closes red today as realization of the implications hits.,,"
sold today. will buy in a couple of dayswhen it hurts low 175 !
Another day another all time high. If I wasn't making so much money I'd think it was boring.
The run for $300 is on.
Did they announce any buy backs in the transcript call?
I hope V is taking advantage of this price for it's 7.5 billion buyback.
Why has this stock declining today? I didn't see any specific news or downgrade.
and boom goes the dynamite! best stock on planet earth.
What time is earnings
Does V hit $185 or does it make a new all time high (over $187-$190) with MA reporting earnings tomorrow morning?
Visa taking a breather today...up again tmr
Beat by 3%
Just another period of consolidation similar to August to December of last year. Give it a couple weeks and let earnings catalyze the next run up.
231 by end of Oct.
Visa has been trending down for some time now. Would like A big flush down to the $180's- $170's so I can add more. Would like a pull back in MA for the same reason.
Best thing to buy now
Another ALL-TIME high for V. If only all my stocks were this wonderful.
Why is Visa underperfoming so badly the market?
Just use your common sense and buy more while it’s still cheap. The economy is reopening. Why would Visa not benefit?
Getting a bid ahead of itself now. Love V and its my favorite but it has to pullback.
E-commerce growth directly benefits Visa.
What do I buy this at?
beats earnings by 8% then drops like a stone? what's the deal?
200-202 by 4 JAN.
Visa and MasterCard have been trading at the low end of their price targets. They are both extremely undervalued.
You just can't keep a good stock down!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx51non76c8&t=22s
Down AH. I wonder if that’s a sign for earnings. Hope it’s a good warning. Let’s pray for a solid beat like MA
"Don't panic folks, this still a great stock, ...the stock can't go straight up all the time. Good time to buy, below the 200 day average."
Great buying opportunities in the low 130’s. Easy money here.
Quality name at a discount. Market could continue to drag it lower but these are the sales you look for
"From earnings whisper.....""Earnings Whisper $1.362nd Quarter March 2020Consensus: $1.35Revenue: $5.80 BilThursdayApr 304:05 PM ET"
upgraded to strong buy
just keep buying Visa in all market corrections & keep making money. my target for first quarter 2021 244/247
"Been holding since the 120's and will hold until i retire (im 24), seems like some sever over selling is going on. I agree investors shoudl move money to oil as the Saudi news triggered a nice spike. prices going to head above 60 very soon. I have DNR, which i grabbed under $1 and have been blessed in these past couple days. GLTA"
"I wish Monday was October 24th. We could use a good ER, like right now!"
any one think split ...visa at 300 two for one ??
People don't want to touch change or dollars so they are using their credit cards
We are just getting started!
"Classic lib stock, pay tiny dividends, price goes up even during bad news, Kroger is about to quit accepting Visa."
Down a little today. Not sure what is causing this. Overall market is up.
Obliterated
"Lots of indecision w/ ""V"". Multiple days of buyers and sellers having a standoff. Trading volume has dropped too."
This is a $300 stock now
"Which one is better if you can only buy one, V or MA? MA had a greater PE ratio, but it moves faster than V."
Buying Western Union
I have a limit order at 170 too but might pull the trigger early. V down to 173 already premarket that's only 2% away
I bought this at 165. I will buy again at 125. Long term hold.
the Thurs before good friday...the interns must be in charge
V is extremely bullish. GO V GO!!!
The low div payout is a big turn off for me...but best of luck to the V longs.
"When was the last time you bought something from Amazon, Apple, or Netflix with cash? Never."
Elect Biden!
"Paypal not investing in crypto, good news for Visa"
159 on the fast-approaching horizon.
Smashed it
No regrets to have sold mear 52 weeks high this time
Beat on earnings but miss on revenues. No surprise there. Guess where the revenues are going........Square (SQ).
"Visa is buy and hold. Doesn't matter your entry point, but best bought on any pullback."
Visa is a steal at this price. If people are traveling and flying how are they paying for the travel? Strong buy!
might salvage my 07/20 140 calls after all! Keep going up V
First time investing for V. I believe it will be in 2 years a trillion dollar company!
Double whammy with missed earning.
"Nothing has changed. Visa is more solid than ever. Today's red numbers are truly unjustified. I am long, and confident that this company and stock is a winner."
Look at V rally!!!
What’s the low it will see today. Keeps going down but will spike after earnings.
"“ The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is poised to breakout as ""positive catalysts are coming into play in the next few weeks,"" according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.”We gonna have ourselves a short barbecue."
"Kroger has high priced groceries. $1.58 for DelMonte chili diced tomatoes compared to 68 cents at Walmart. Guess where I shop. There is also a grocer based out of Michigan called Meijer which has pretty inexpensive groceries, and they have cash back perks."
Credit Suisse raises V price target to $270 from $265 “based on potential upside to revenue forecasts — maintains outperform rating”.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT !!
"Visa, finally getting some deserved Rally, after being upgraded yesterday this stock should be in the 230s to 240s and 2 to 3 months, Right now it's a screaming bargain !!!"
New 8 BILLION buyback. $220 in the morning
Why is V down? Consolidating?
does anybody know what the f yellen is talking about - golf courses are packed - we are having the best time of our life - COVID has been great for the rich
Visa still has room to run a lot higher. Still not even at the all time high. But people are buying into Apple today at $2 trillion.
"Buying opportunity coming up after earnings.First it gets bad, before it gets good.....!"
"Since now debt is so forgiven even by government, it’s severely hurting credit card companies deadly tho!"
"Well, I will go on record for saying I think the earnings should trigger an upgrade tomorrow.."
This could easily hit $300 in the next 12 months
If you know you know
"IMO in a diversified FinTech strategy, one must have positions in BOTH V and MA, et als... held in a Roth in perpetuity..."
Mastercard Q1 Earnings and Revenue beat estimates....https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mastercard-ma-q1-earnings-revenues-131501509.html
I see a number of concerns about $ transaction volume. I think with so many individuals struggling to survive its the deferred payment (for which there will be pressure to forgive) and downright losses that will have to be written off. Throw in a 30P/E with no near term growth and customer base that will be strapped for spending over the next year or two and its a good reason the stock is trading so badly. All imho and fwiw.
left the V train at 140. will get back under 136 - next Monday
Visa will run up to $180 before the next earnings release. $200 by the summer.
"While HUGELY bullish, I tried to give a heads up to the tried and true ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"" thesis that lined up perfectly with the chart. There is a gap to fill at 170, those interested might start to nibble there. Buying today in the 180 area, after a 10 point rise yesterday, is just bad trading...in my very humble opinion. Hope all is well with you and your families!"
Earnings will crush expectations. Analysts know this and they are getting in early. Don’t miss out.
Higher after hour
after this it will go down more and then it will go a little bit up. till the virus stops.
201 very soon
"This can’t be good news for Visa can it ?“'The clock is ticking' on U.S. consumer loans — and that could mean a slowdown, Deutsche Bank warns”Yahoo Finance Aarthi SwaminathanA rising number American households are grappling with rising borrowing costs and consumer loan delinquencies — a worrying trend that could indicate an economic slowdown is at hand, Deutsche Bank warned on Wednesday.As U.S. consumers rack up a record amount in credit — a recent Federal Reserve report showed outstanding consumer debt topped a record $4 trillion — Deutsche Bank’s analysts showed that more borrowers are falling behind on a range of personal debts, like credit cards and auto loans."
YAY GO VISA GO
People are underestimating the trend to going cashless. 99.99% of my bills/expenses are paid in plastic. I reap huge rewards every year.
Thumbs up if Visa reaches $200 this year.
did V earnings date get confirmed....is it Oct 24 after close?
Down about 7% in 3 weeks. Is this about the lack of a stimulus bill hurting consumer spending? Any other reasons?
"ya, it was Big dead cat bounce yesterday .I will stay out until May 31.Vacation at Home."
This is very normal for V. I had been told you guy that how V react each time during earning season. Look at my past post. Within several days V will be up.
"Here is my prediction for tomorrow. if Visa, earning number is good with out any negative warning for the next quarter earning number then Visa go up from $4.00 to $6.00 max.If Visa earning number just meet the expectations with negative warning for the next quarter then Visa may go down from $2.00 to $4.00..Let see..."
$142 at close today
V is likely going to be the best Dividend Growth stock of our generation. Same with MA. Buying these 2 is going to be like buying Big tobacco stocks back in the 1960s and 70s. Enjoy capital appreciation right now and income a few decades from now...
"The reason why it’d be dumb to go short or sell before earnings is simple, there are too many beats happening tomorrow. The tides will raise all boats and you’ll see a compounded effect going into Thursday. I probably should have played the $FB beat instead of $V, but I’m here, so be it."
Anyone have any thoughts on why MA is outperforming V lately?
PayPal is on a breakout
I agree with Anthony. I got just after the IPO and it's been good for me. Keep watch of the trends.
$V is a great way to play the re-opening of the economy after COVID-19!
man Visa is killing it! it's like a dream I bought only a couple years ago at 100$... i dont make alot of money and the 5k i invested means slot to me! this is incredible
Barclays announced a $170 price target this morning

"What a joke. Government investigating and having hearing ( FB, GOOG, AMZN, now V ) and nothing happened.Looks like buy the dip......"
I keep hearing that you should hold onto your cash. So I have been using my credit cards. Don’t you think most people are doing the same?
buy buy buy on dip
i knowits only rock n rollbut i like it

resilient as ever.
Online shopping
Yes true! But it's not business as usual.
PayPal tearing it up. That'll be Visa soon.
I am perplexed why this stock is dropping today with all the good news and articles out on Visa. 18% increase in dividend... Great time to buy!
The consumer is strong. Why would you sell a single share of Visa???
"I think this will recover to $220 to $225 before too much longer, so anywhere under $200 to the low $200’s is a great buy in point with good potential gains in my opinion."
not worried. gobs of money never goes out of style.
V will close this week at $ 180.00!!!
Will Apple Card hurt visa ?
Ma and v are the best investments. The future of payments
I agree I think visa will start falling from here however it will only create a dip and make new highs in the months or years to come
MA & V are raising transactions fees.Would not what to be a small business.Let's raise the minimum hourly rate to $15.00 dollars/hour.Let's also raise the credit card transaction fee as well 
Love V’s global collaboration and creation programs!what a cash cow machinery
"If amazon is the big winner of the pandemic, and the amazon credit card is a Visa card, should Visa not be going much higher compared to MA? They trade more or less the same percentages down feom their pre pandemic highs. What do u think? Will we have big jumps after the earning call or is it not significant enough? Your thoughts. Tnx"
"Finally, another opportunity to add to the position. Anything below 145, go for it. When the dust soon settles, we’ll be above 150..."
Mastercard sticking it to Visa again.
"Most transaction worldwide today are still in cash. Especially in Asia, South America and Africa. And that is changing fast. Visa has a huge market to take on, and has only reached a fraction of its potential."
"They had great earnings and by giving less in guidance, they can beat."
"Overreaction on poor ISM data, not enough weight in the record holiday spending."
this is a life time hold. add more on any pullback.
Do you know that Amex is 2 times larger than Visa. Search it!!!!!

"If coming back to $150, that's a normal value...."
"For longs. Has V ever popped like AXP did last week after earning? Just wondering. They had a solid 1st quarter, increased earnings and rev, announced a 7 billion buy back, and maintained their outlook for the year and the stock dropped. How can they improve on that I don't know"
ALL ABOARD!!!!!
Why can’t this get above $200.00.
Tom Lee of Fundstrat Advisors said we will have a Face Ripping rally throughout the month of April. 100-200 point potentially added to the S&P 500
"Bit of an odd run here. I anticipate at least a tiny pull back at some point before earnings, then another run. Just what Visa does"
Straight UP since $116....it ALWAYS retraces back to the 50 day average....ALWAYS...check charts for years after any gap up.
"Who doesn't have a visa card, none!Visa ill always be the KING!"
V is like a supercharged high yielding safe deposit. It sure feels almost 100% like you’re capital guaranteed/protected at all times while you’re gains steadily builds.
"It’s quite puzzling to see V trading at such a bargain basement price, despite “soundly beating earnings expectations” on last week’s report!- We are on the eve of the Holiday Season — which is V’s strongest Qtr of the year!***What a great time to load up on one of the best businesses of our time — while it remains on sale below $215."
"Visa Inc (V) is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Wednesday, July 25, 2018. The consensus earnings estimate is $1.08 per share on revenue of $5.06 billion and the Earnings Whisper  number is $1.14 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 81% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for year-over-year earnings growth of 25.58% with revenue increasing by 10.84%. Short interest has decreased by 7.9% since the company's last earnings release while the stock has drifted higher by 12.7% from its open following the earnings release to be 16.6% above its 200 day moving average of $120.88. Overall earnings estimates have been revised higher since the company's last earnings release. On Thursday, July 19, 2018 there was some notable buying of 20,752 contracts of the $150.00 call expiring on Friday, August 17, 2018. Option traders are pricing in a 3.2% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 2.6% move in recent quarters."
Credit card use has never been more prevalent. VISA = WINNING
"Crypto is not a threat to Visa. The President, the Fed, and Congress are all concerned about Crypto. They will not allow crypto to replace the US dollar. Visa will continue to surge higher!"
Over Over sold!
"VISA at $240 going into ER next week. Good jobs report and economy opening up in ""shutdown States"". People pent up demand will be explosive for V quarter and outlook. New highs after ER on our way to $300."
Visa and Mastercard are getting crushed. Economy will roll over in 2019. Time to leave the markets and wait till the big crash is over. Will buy when Visa is under 100 and Mastercard under 125.
temporary drop.
"Steady and sustained growth, with earnings report due late October. One to watch."
"Picking any of these 12 months ago made a mint: Visa, Mastercard, Square, Paypal, PayCom, FleetCor Tech. Business is BOOMING in this sector."
mute Stephen
Expect a BIG beat later today.
Visa and Mastercard to merge! Approval from FCC likely.
V is heading back below 210 again now!
Lost it's leg's ? Great report and forecast but no 180's !?
237.50 today 240 tomorrow
I bought some. Visa will come out ok

Looks like people are bailing?
love this stock. good luck finding a sexier chart!
I need to get better at knowing when to sell
"Hey. Does any one experience where visa charge a $3.5 per transaction fee for paying bills using their visa online to pay? I thought they encouraged ppl. To use their service to pay bill, but not this is too expensive to use. I’m going to opt. Out to visa."
forever stock
Also remember the stock buyback plan
Any idea what would be impact on visa after tomorrow’s feds call
Mike u cant time the market. u a trader or an investor bro. pick one
125 v soon!
Just keep buying V honestly. This is one of those stocks that will B-line straight up for decades to come. This industry is essentially a duopoly and V has the best balance sheet.
This thing absolutely refuses to go over $200. Feel like I’ve been waiting for eternity
Today's new vaccince announcement should be good for the stock
On Stocktwits they are saying that the insiders pushed the price down end of this week to kill a large amount of Calls deadlining today. Any truth to this?
Any ideas of a way to play Visa’s QTRS EPS. A straddle ???Any suggestions???
STRONG BUY
What time is earnings?
Today is a gift! $$$$$$ Buy! $$$
Huge beat
It’s a beat! $1.20
Dfs is doing better
"The value of the stock since New Year has gone from 220 to ""207"" for International holders of Visa because of the ""dollar effect"" i.e. the increasing value of the US dollar that is a Biden twist.The market is anticipating less stimuli from Democrats than Republicans and this shaves additional dollars off this stock, however the new Politics add a couple of % to the dollar exchange.Imo. This is not the time to defend the currency of the USA. The lock downs need to end BEFORE the monetary policy shifts or the stock market will have a crisis that is worse than 2020. Lets hope that Biden hasn't forgotten his High School math and economy lessons. -_-"
".03 eps beat, slight miss on revenues. Not going to move stock much one way or the other. Let’s see conference call."
I sold at 145$ now I’m sick when to buy back in again ?
"Shorting Visa stock - move truly reserved for the galactically stupid. Then again a pea-brain like John also claims to be short other ""losers"" like LULU, Tesla and Microsoft. LMAO!"
Didnt know that many people used Visa to buy Brazilian steel
"Maybe with Mastercard having not so great earnings, more money will flow to Visa."
Just went live again 45 minutes plus frozen will be interesting to see the why reasonm
V is one of my best stocks. Chart is amazing and I bought at $67; I’m up 110%
"i sold my position of VISA at $122.Watched an analyst on Bloomberg who said it was too expensive, PE was too rich."
"Tomorrow market go down, so V will settle down $172 to &173 range"
"Hope we can close above $141, even if it means red"
On it's way to $190! 
All time high
MoffettNathanson raises Visa target to $230.
"At 182.80. Broke through 180, now lets push 200."
Cash is a covid-19 risk. Visa will explode to the upside in the coming months. People who never used cards before are for the first time going cashless.
"Visa will probably dip down after earnings, good time to scoop up some shares before the steady increase continues."
Steady as she goes.
I bought when Visa went public.The only regret I have is that I did not have more to give.VISA for life!
new and new high...
"@Mark, you are dead nuts correct for the SHORT TERM INVESTOR. However, since owning it from the IPO in 2008, I'm up unbelievably. There have been several times since I've held this stock that people, like you, purported that everyone should sell( Retailers being paid over $6 billion for lawsuit, the great recession, etc.). But wisely, I have held on to this great stock, and will buy more on the dips. Great Management, Visa understands and is implementing new trends, and they have a nice dividend to boot. Mastercard is great as well. LONG VISA since 2008."
"Christmas is almost here.Most will start rushing to pick up that perfect gift us g plastic, if which V has the Lions share.long Visa."
This has been running up since the first of the year.I don't remember a run like this since ever!
Head fake
Strap in... nobody is predicting an earnings beat for either V or MA ￼
Visa is extremely undervalued and under appreciated at these levels. Why buy Square and PayPal at all time highs? Visa has much more room to run.
Hope you bought low.
We had our PT raised by Oppenheimer. So too did MANo explanation though.
visa like any other company will just PAY THE FINE N MOVE ON NO BIGGIES HEHEHE JUST PAY FINE THANK YOU FOR THE DISCOUNT LORD N MAKE MONEY HEHEHEHE
$70 tomorrow
High PE but V deserves it every ounce. There is monopoly business in credit card which V is the biggest.
"Visa to Outperform on Consumer Spending TrendsAs investors gear up for earnings season, bulls including Oppenheimer's Glenn Greene see credit card company Visa as a buy on accelerating retail sales and ""healthy"" card-issuer volume growth, as outlined by Barron's. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Kupferberg also chimed in with an upbeat outlook for Visa ahead of earnings, indicating that the firm is likely to beat consensus estimates as it benefits from consumer spending trends, as reported by U.S. News & World Report. Citing data from SpendTrend, BAML said Q2 year-over-year (YOY) card volume grew 4.9% for Visa and Mastercard, the highest since 2012. Meanwhile, in the U.S., retail sales growth in Q1 was 5%, and gasoline, which represents between 7% and 9% of total U.S. card volume for Visa, saw a YOY price hike of 20.1% in Q2."
Apple taking an interest
52 week high in a few days
The last time it reached 250 dollars there was a 4 for 1 split.
We are in a cashless society. No more checks either. It’s a plastic folks!!!

"Meets expectations drops 4 percent, buy while it’s low. I get beating expectations was baked into the price but not by 4 percent"
"Everywhere I look I see the US market manipulating quality stocksSomehow FB after 6m is flatSomehow BABA is at 265 after turning its cloud buz profitable (the very thing Wall Street said needed to happen to value it at a higher multiple) and making progress so Ant will IPO (the very headwind that the Yankees had used as justification to discount the stock)Now we have VISA that sold off both times hard, to 185 and 195Then recovered stronglySee the pattern? Wild gyrating prices to shake out and hurt the little guy and make the big cats richThe whole game is riggedAnd the US stinks"
There was nothing not to like in the report last night.
Why does this stock keep dropping? It never holds its gains in the morning.
Fireworks are prepared for Visa reaches historical high
What’s causing the rise
very nice start. let's get this thing to 140 by close.
anyone here eat #$%$
Baked in already all these stocks are way over valued we need a reality check lol and im long v but come on
why is it down today?
"Love the headline today: ""V has entered into a global partnership with Accor."" Next stop $220 by March 1st. Go V!"
"Bullish technical indication, according to stoxline. A break of 179.47 could move it up to 209.62."
the Facebook effet
"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS)NYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price. Currency in USDAdd to watchlistQuote Lookup176.72-2.11 (-1.18%)"
WOW! Nice to see 300!got it 12 years ago at 60.....
"Who can interpret this Options table, https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V/options?p=V"
my Visa up 661%retirement in 5 yrs
needs to break 209....
Just remember when this corrects again that I said wait till 203 with volume
Millennials and Gen Z love credit cards and for the majority I’d say are smart with them. They see the upside to having credits cards and a lot of them have the goal of having 10+ one day. More credit card financial literacy = more Visa cards in action = more revenue = higher stock price for us. Visa should take advantage and potentially make quick YouTube videos teaching people about how to properly use credit cards to gain consumer confidence back. Credit cards are an amazing thing if you use them right!
Lot of people will sell. Big investors will buy them up and the stock will run again. It’s a game.
shake out the shorts then up up up
"More people than ever pay for items using their mobile phones, whether they’re having their rewards card scanned by a barista for the first time or they've gone ""all in"" by loading their Visa debit and credit card on their phone. But as rapidly as mobile payments have grown, the technology is still in its infancy. By 2020, many people could be leaving their wallets behind and paying for almost everything using their mobile phones.This infographic discusses the growth of mobile payments since 1997 when vending machines that took payments by text were first introduced. Since 2010, the amount of money that's passed from consumers to merchants via smartphones has gone up nine-fold. By 2017, more than $721 billion will change hands via mobile1.More importantly, though, more people and more merchants will feel more comfortable to use mobile, whether it's those NFC chips in your phones that let you hold your phone up to a scanner at a store or via transaction apps, by 2020 Visa believes mobile payments could become the preferred method of both consumers and merchants."
"Visa and Mastercard make a portion of every transaction made on a card (banks issuing the card hold the risk of it not being paid back), this business model is absurd. Long term investors will do very well. Cash is trash!"
Election Victory for Trump will MOVE Visa MUCH HIGHER as the whole Economy moves MUCH FASTER than with a Kamala in Charge!!!
I use Visa in everything!!!
should I sell my Visa and buy Master Card? Looks like Master Card has more growth to be where it was before all of this Covid 19.
does increase in interest rates affect this stock in anyways
looking forward to seeing $200 stock again!
"Good short here at $140.............may get to $142, but it is overvalued and business around the World will be slowing with higher rates and massive debt."
"WOW, As I read it MA didn't do any better.. And up big.. Sour grapes for anyone not believing this will be 150.00 in the next few days weeks."
why is visa down so much???
Looks like they are trying to keep this between $152.50 and $155 this week
Cyber Monday had record breaking sales numbers. Why would you sell Visa here? Strong buy!
"Based on Mastercard and American Express' earnings, a miss is likely in the cards here. It's being priced in. Hindsight is 20/20 but I certainly wish I had waited until today to buy more instead of last week, but this is still a great long-term company. What matters more to me than top and bottom line is how they compare to Mastercard. We will see very soon."
"V is like my parents, always do good to me"
"As the summer approaches and covid cases drop and job hiring spikes, Visa will explode to $250 and run to $300 by year end. You heard it here first."
Ok. Looks like $130 is at risk today.
"This and Mastercard have been absolute monsters. I've had Visa since 2013 and regret only buying MA last fall. Still, it has also performed incredibly. Good luck to all longs! Shorts can continue to get slaughtered."
Low volume...hope it continues
"I remember buying V at it's IPO. Aww those were the days, my only regret is I had too little to give.Visa = one of the strongest companies mankind has ever known!We are going to 1k per share!!!"
God bless president Trump and Stay long with Visa! $$$$Don't worry Matt I will put a good word in for you! Maybe president Trump will let you kiss his hand one day.....
"Visa needs to expand and they gotta do it quick for us to continue growing in the future. We need to figure out our own blockchain of some sort so that money is transferred P2P within milliseconds. As an example Visa needs to team up with banks and fintech apps such as Webull, Wealthsimple(Canadian brokerage) and robinhood so that money can be transferred to and from your account instantly. That is the biggest upside to blockchain/cryptocurrency and idk why Visa isn’t taking advantage of how big they are to be able to create a “fast transaction system”. How else do you guys think Visa could expand because we haven’t innovated in years and something new, something fun, something good needs to go out of this company to create more stream of revenue."
Who doesn't love a good sale? Visa is as solid as it gets folks. If you missed out on the IPO here's your in. THank me later.
"Over $20K of the $150 August Calls bought today, over $5K of the Sept $145 Calls."
i dont have extra money laying around to buy on dips. but i bought visa at its ipo and now i have 7 1/2 times more money. its for retirement-ill never sell
V is money in the bank after MA Q4 beat this morning!
Look at Visa climb!!!
Ouch!
"Hurricane disaster time. Visa should do *very* well - before, during and after. More hurricanes, expected."
"Counter intuitive move this morning after Citi's raise. V seems to trade with tech and there appears to be a rotation out of high multiple tech today. Is it that, or is the market selling consumer oriented stocks in the belief we have reached peak employment ahead of the coming slowdown? Of note, MCD is also down for no apparent reason on a day with a pretty good tape. I don't think I'd be adding here without a better understanding of why V and others in the group are down."
I’m so mad rn this should be skyrocketing but no it’s knifing this is manipulation
Ok V banking crisis is over how about a divided increase you cheap B!$&;@s
Apple Card will put a dent in Visa. Steady decline from here on in.
$Cash Cow Peeps $200.00 PPS is coming. Not a pumper just look at the numbers. Who has a better business model? I know right.
I have 2600 shares at 18. Whats 10 points
"Like this stock, have owned it for years, but why can’t it pay more divvy at this point? 0.60 % just doesn’t cut the mustard for me. Payout ratio extremely low as well, what’s the plan here?"
Can’t wait to see how high this stock will jump upon earning result!
Visa already controls card networks... now they will control non-card networks with the Plaid acquisition. Visa is the network of networks. Visa will see a huge acceleration in growth going forward.
Bought another lot today. V will see $200 by the end of the year. 
ATH
Go V Go!!! There will be big earnings today!!!
Any good books about visa?How does visa operate as basically a monopoly ?
"Visa is heading down, how high can it go, institutions are pumping, PE ratio is very high. JPM is much much better PE ratio is half of V."
V is holding up pretty good for a 350 point drop day. Not losing at least half of your ATR is a good sign.
Oh John. You are sooo SHORT TERM. Man Up. Visa is a LONG TERM HOLD. LONG V since 2008.
"market correction, but will visa's price hold up above 210?"
"short term, pullback and consolidation. long term, move higher."
Trump wants to ink a deal.
"Great earnings, great stock. It holds its value and you can sleep well at night owning it."
hopefully this lousy action is due to options expiration. V has been moving sideways for over a year now. after this consolidation should break out soon (hopefully)
The trading setup for V looks very enticing. have you guys heard of awesom-eSTOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
"The more pessimistic posts I see make me think this thing is ready to jump. PYPL and SQ way overpriced. V is a stalwart and has been consolidating here around 190-200 and has established a support. V is unlikely to go down significantly. I see this as a new base. Yeah, I’m bullish."
don't listen to cowards buy buy buy when everyone is fearful that's Warren Buffett's saying
"Good Morning,Up and down is nature of stocks index. The Visa value depend on stock index too. However the Visa plastic very popular. Almost everyone carry one or more and they make money on transaction fee . So the Visa is the best. A lot of people worry about the Google pay and Apple pay may bring down the value of traditional cards like Visa and Master cards. No, I not worry at all. Very happy with Visa...Have a great days.."
strong resistance 210. lets see if it could break past 212
Breaking out big time. Go big V!
"Amazon, Walmart, Kroger, CVS, Netflix, Apple, etc. How are you making purchases with these companies?"
Nice
This is one pony that loves to run.
29.6M shares shorted. 1.65% of float. Seems as though its risen in the past few months.
Will they be able to hold it under $150 today?
200 this week?
Isn’t the whole Trump economy based on credit? Deficit sure has surged
why negative?
dow up 353 but V down. i feel like im in the twilight zone
200 seem possible now
where are those shorty? run and hide. ..Visa will be up to 140 per share then pull back a little bits and up again...Love this stock and buy more since Ipo...
"The only thing worse than the new finance page is Yahoo Messenger. Yahoo has sunk to a new low. I will quit going to message board, things are not in chronological order there and you can't follow a link. They must let inmates be in charge at yahoo."
Go!!! Free road to 250
Its in the governments best interest for payments to be tracked digitally for tax purposes. I’m in visa stock for years and years to come.
The VIX hit 30 today. That's usually the time to buy.
Just money getting shifted around
New high. ..
Anything under 140 is a buy. Will be up EOY @ 155p/s.
Go V!
Plz go to 200 by end of the year!!
Any bad earnings abs could drop to $180s. Stay tuned.
"time to load up tomorrow, it always falls for 2 days after earnings and then up we go."
I expect a strong quarter. Hold tight.
Good day to add a few shares to one's core position.
Another earnings beat. Love. it. Great stock. Still in overbought after huge run. Strong Buy on any pullback.
johnkelly has been quiet. or logged in as another account and pretend as a long. :)
RSI & Money Flow heading lower. Soon to be buying opportunity?
Well hopefully next week is better glta
been holding since ipo...you dont get rich selling srocks short term
"Debit interchange. Want to know the value? Go read how much fraud exists on Squares cash ap. Sq, the most over hyped company ever."
Threw a little money into this stock just to let it run. Not getting rich off of this anytime soon. But it beats leaving my money in a .05% APY bank account
Once in a lifetime buying opportunity for Visa. Don’t miss out. People are at home using their Visa cards to make digital purchases.
$195 w/ upgrade by analysts
Price target upgrades should be announced soon.
Going 150 tomorrow
It helps to have a little green on such a red day.
$200 this week
Visa should be trading at its 52 week high
Earnings will beat. $150 soon.
Viva Visa!
Purchasing V and MA hand over fist. Two monster stocks continue to track higher...Just saying!
"When other stocks falling, only this one climbing, will this give any help?"

Just think of how Visa will have blowout earnings next month. Everyone swipes a card or uses a card for online purchases.

I had a dream.. if the world is ending.. why don’t you use your visa and buy the item you always wanted? Since you don’t have to pay for it any way? Right? Lol! Sell off your visa stock.. I need more at lower prices!
Visa reports tomorrow after the bell right?
"Record revenue. Buying Plaid. Over 9 billion in buyback.Just a little ""harsh"" in after hours aren't we??? !!!!!"
"MasterCard is not doing much better, yet."
"Started a position today in $V. Best balance sheet of any of these credit companies. I'll also be waiting to get into $PYPL as well if it pulls back. It'll be interesting to see if consumers have been using credit during this crisis. Also, when this eventually blows over, consumers will be spending like gang busters after being stuck in their houses for months. The credit industry will be a great place to be at a discount."
Very happy about this dip. Loaded more on V and MA. Great stocks. Safe as well.
This is a gift! $$$$$
Pandemic is hammering credit card stocks. Going to be a rough ride for several months.
MA only down 0.8% unlike this stone.Seen it drop from $145 to $135 in 3 trading days. Talk about a volatile stock.MA raises its dividend over 30%....V is supposedly buying back its stock....don't see the benefit
$300 per share in a couple years .. the Visa and Mastercard business model is untouchable
Dead cat bounce ?
Great ER! Well done Visa!
I don’t see how anyone could hate on Visa. It’s a money printing machine! Buy on every dip and smile as you make more and more money from a great company!
Added to V at $167.60
I wanted to buy today... was hoping the market would be down today with people taking profit at the first of the year. That did not work out.
Visa needs to announce support for Cryptos as well as investment in Crypto currencies. It will take off like a rocket
bagys looking for buildings to jump off of
Just added 70 more shares of Visa. I bought my original shares in 2015 when they had a 4:1 split. I bought only 120 shares then. Wish I bought waaay more back then. Oh well. I just have a great feeling this baby still has ways to go.
Here is a game I like to play with Visa. I look at the charts and pick a price I think it will hit that I want to buy. Then I just smack myself for not putting it all in Visa in the first place when I started investing
Bought in at 113 on Friday. I might sell and make a profit if market turns.
Everyone is sitting inside spending money online with there VISA.Better believe im loading up every chance at this $$$
Looking at 150 after Earning Result!
"Everybody has had their own branded credit card for decades. Walmart, Amazon, Costco, etc. Visa is still here and Visa is still growing. $200 will be reached soon."
"So much for buying on dips, (when was that). Jules your $200 by ER was not that far off! V is an excellent long-term hold."
"Im looking to go long. One thing many people are not noting yet is that all small business credit terms will need to be looked at. Right now all business including mine are on hold, what happens when we return is anybody's guess, will they pay me what they owe? what I am hearing right now it that a lot of companies are putting 100% of customers on COD terms this means if you want to do a transaction you will most probably need a credit card or electronic form of payment."
Visa using crypto. Full send mode engaged
Do u think they’ll have good earnings?
HowMuch will visa dip to this evening and tomorrow morning? It will spike tomorrow afternoon.. I think

"Read this a while back....""If your barber, uber driver, cashier at McDonalds, or your barista is talking to you about the stock market, that is the time to be afraid...."" I do not think we are there yet, but we are pretty close."
Open position today for V at $136.89 and think tomorrow earning will be good.
$340 stock in 10 years
"What's crazy is this stock hit >$140 yesterday, before plummeting intra-day.Over $7 dollar swing in 36 hours"
Going to max
The huge stock buybacks in Visa are just getting started. Also online spending is surging. Visa is extremely cheap at this price.
I bought 8 shares on Friday at 207.10. I am expecting that V will start a slow but steady climb starting Monday. V is a massive company. Apparently 1/3rd of the dow decline on Friday was due to Visa’s decline.
We will have another down day today. Better buying opportunity ahead.
Oversold. A buy here.
These are the times when great fortunes are made by investors with the courage to invest in one of the great business of our time.
Anyone knows when is ER today?
Start it out low and give the shorts a chance to cover
Wait for post earnings market selloff to buy cheaper. It's been a hellova ride for the market and expect a summer selloff.
Online purchases
Visa is a winner
Visa Warns It Will Be Challenged ‘for a Number of Quarters
could not resist buying back today
Surprised the Kroger ban did not negatively impact Visa stock. I got a notice a few days ago that Smith's in NV would no longer accept Visa. I thought V and MA charged the exact same network fees.....guess Visa has higher fees.https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900058291/smiths-to-ban-visa-credit-cards-citing-excessive-fee-charges.html
Excellent discussion from this group.Visa is an excellent imvestment for long or short . Low risk and always makes new high overtime
"There has to be deep in the markets to see significant gains in stocks like Visa. I miss the deep of March, thinking it was heading lower to at least 120 but in a few sessions was already back to 180 and since then is range bound."
"In 10 more years, I should have a nice V account value at this rate."
World moving quickly to a cashless society. MasterCard and Visa a great long-term investments. Huge buying opportunity in both stocks
stock seems broken.................................
V is going to fall a little tomorrow from the PayPal fall so just watch out for that
Not before it goes alot lower.Most stores are closed for business right across the board.
Is it too late to get in on this ride?
fairy muted
Can this be the beginning of the next correction?We are due.
Buying Opportunity my friends! $$$$$
"How will the Coronavirus effect V stock ? Many airlines are canceling flights to and from China,and will not restart flights to China until the Coronavirus clears up.The transportation indexes are trading downward and appear to be bearish."
Now is the time to buy
Here comes $ 170.00
"Time to start selling some shares. Have had V for years and it's been great, but with a PE of around 40 and being were now on the longest bull run in history, it is time to lighten up. Taking money off the top is never a bad thing. GLTA"
"Visa stock price gone way over real growth rate and expectation. While this is quality stock, There isn't enough growth to justify this price for next 3 year. PEG is almost 3. Such established industry this is too high.I am only shorting out of money calls but starting bigger way (IN past I only done 1 or 2 calls and overall small profit so far) but at 150 it no brainer to short.I won't go short on stock much longer but continue use calls and puts premium to print profit."

Yes ... go Visa! 
Guys did you hear CNBC?GOOG is buying FIT!
ex-div thursday!!!
Buy at 190 next week ?
This Visa go up slowly but surely will be over $100 per share by Friday morning.
"Sounds to logical. As if good earnings means a stock pop. So many times it didn't happen. Have the rules changed? just asking no skin in the game here yet. Also a lowering tide takes out all boats, when is exactly that correction coming? A game of musical chairs imo."
$220 price target
Would love to see a 20% correction for a good entry point.
Wow you know it’s a rough day when this is down 4 percent
200dma is about $196 and latest breakdown went to ~ $186. We’ll see if it gets there but considering adding limit orders at both levels. Last add was @ $190.
222 by mid October.
Bought Visa few years back at $55. Best investment I have ever made. No-brainer. This stock will make gains every year. Probably will hold V forever.
oh for FS!
"As a V and SQ stockholder, I always wonder if V would ever consider buying SQ. I'm happy with both as independent companies, but I think it would be an amazing team-up. Good luck to all longs!"
People buying crypto on a Visa card with all risk to the banks is going to be interesting. I hope these people can at least pay their bills.

Who plans on holding forever? I'm serious. This is one of those stocks you don't sell until you retire! One of my favorites!
For all us longs we’re not surprised at the exact results of today and earnings report this is very typical on visa steady as she goes always consistent.￼
What is pushing this stock up - year end buying?
Going to $190s. Wait for it
Need a up 2% open tomorrow and my #$%$ is getting paid. Go Visa
"Wait for the earnings report that is due on the 28th before you pump this stock.Covid has caused Visa 2 years of revenue growth. This means that in the middle of 2021 the Company will have the revenue that it had in 2019 and this is a positive prognosis. The alternative is a prolonged lock down that sacks the revenue another 30 % for several years and reverts Visas sales back to the numbers of 2015 and prior. V and MA are transaction loggers and insurance Companies. Misbehavior and fraud make up a large portion of the % that they charge and false orders, criminality has gone up since the lock down. ( credit risk is NOT the only risk in business ) Visa doesn't have a banking license like PYPL and SQ and venturing into BTC will do little for it's 400 B valuation. The transaction numbers are too small to move Visa and the BTC App market is over saturated with providers. V and MA need the GDP to recover. The GDP outside of the USA means little to nothing for Visa. The Company will make money even if sales slip 40 % and they won't default but the valuation won't be 400 B in the case of slashed sales. Card issuers need people to physically swipe cards and go OUTSIDE. The Internet alone can't uphold the market cap. Square got saved by its App. Visa doesn't have an App Wallet and it should develop one even if the market is saturated and it's 10 years too late to the Internet. Developing a mobile wallet will cost approx. $40 mil and could add $80 B to the valuation I.e. 2000 times the risk reward."
"Why sell at $200 ? I consider Visa one of those stocks that Mr Buffett said ""Hold forever""."
Contactless payments are the new normal. Strong buy
"I would like to see Visa have a payment system like Venmo. Phone App to make payments to retailer directly. Notify of charges like Amex. Biometrics to avoid fraud. Security. My biggest concern is fraud, ID theft."
Signs are pointing to a market panic now. One of the big banks is hemorrhaging and triggered unprecedented FED activity to bail them out. Just like 2008. Visa was $49 a share back then before a 4/1 split. Going to be a lot of losses coming soon.
Very low bar for comps this year. $300 price target
Buy buy buy!
Said would go to 115-118 two weeks ago and Friday and 8 losers said no way. Was gonna keep going straight up. Get a clue. Stocks don't go straight up and as I said two weeks ago a correction like this is healthy and normal and good buying opportunity. Sooo many clueless out there. Bingo...118 today.
Year over year growth will be huge for Visa. Low comps from last year. Cheap at these levels.
I find it interesting that Andrew Left who used the media and internet to drum support for his shorts is put out that others are using it also . It seems he is taking his ball and heading home
Oppenheimer raises V to 210. BMO cuts V to 232 from 239.

Look at some stocks dropping fast. Visa hardly moving down that tells the story.
Powell put is in place. see you at $200.
"$RMD up 3% beat, stock up 13 pts."
Qiwi explosive growth including its visa wallet and omni channel payment services to me is a great buy as a shadow stock for Visa with faster growth.
"In statistics, what are total cash and total debt?Why is the debt pretty much always higher, no matter what company?"
GLAD I bought in 2008. Great Management. UP THAT DIVIDEND
"Anything below 220 is a blind buying opportunity. This DOJ investigation is kind of a recurring event with credit card companies (Just like the Pharma law agencies are always behind the JNJ and other pharma each year). Remember, when you buy home depot or target or american airlines or MGM or AMC or whatever.. you are dependend on the performance of these companies. However one thing in common across any sector or shops is that the payment is mostly thru Visa or Mastercard."
180 holding so far folks
$150 soon
Pullback needed. By this time next year $300+. Short term neutral. Holding 200 shares from $107 still.

Finally I got me some V at FVE. Thanks V
If there was ever one stock to own in any market be it a bull or bear market its Visa. Buy and hold forever and enjoy a split or two along with continued dividend increases. Bulletproof company.
We're really moving now. New all time highs coming.
"Visa will be 230 by the end of January, Count on it !! Every fundamental is pointing there as well as their outlook for this year."
"Since V always tanks around earnings, how low will V go this time? 179 again or lower? And how long does this decline last?"
What Card trump geted :O ? Visa or MA ?
looks like everyone who is off next week took Friday also...the interns are in charge again...have a good Independence day
"I've been say'in ""$200 soon!"" forever. Now have to say.....""$300 soon!"""
"Visa almost always beats quarterly Rev/EPS expectations, so the beat might have been priced in already to a large extent. So we didn't get a big pop in the AH. Sit back, relax, and take in V's 5-year stock chart. Ahhhhh. Serenity now!"
"Thinking visa will beat earnings because more people are shopping online due to the virus is a little small minded. I own a retail store that is currently closed and usually pay VISA hundreds of dollars a month in processing fees. Now that the store is closed, I’m not. It’s the merchants that make up most of their business, and many of them like myself are non operational right now. Cruises and flights are the other big purchases usually made on VISA cards, and that is also non existent right now. Long term visa is an excellent buy, but in my opinion it will decrease significantly in the coming months."
It will be a glorious day when (if) V finally holds 200+
"I can't see why it should be bearish, but there is no interest in the stock."
its time to buy....
300 in 3 months 
"Another panic sell, is another buying opportunity! (Rich get richer...)"
Isn’t this about the time Visa announces a huge dividend increase?
buffett trims stake in Visa. time to sell
why it is down after market hours
Call sellers would have needed to come up with over 40 million shares if this had closed over 220 today...they had to do something. Jerks pulled out all the stops to keep that from happening.
"People have their Visa cards loaded into all of their digital devices/products... Amazon, Prime, Netflix, Disney+, Comcast, Apple Products, Utility Bills, Grocery Delivery Apps, etc... Use your common sense people"
Visa is Slowly but surely increase to $190.00 range. Love this stock...
ohhh cmon. get up
New all time highs. Never in doubt. Gotta love it. Post pandemic this is $300.
"On February 25, 2008, Visa announced it would go ahead with an IPO of half its shares. The IPO took place on March 18, 2008. Visa sold 406 million shares at US$44 per share ($2 above the high end of the expected $37–42 pricing range), raising US$17.9 billion in the largest initial public offering in U.S. history..........Compare this to the current IPO's"
sold my SQ two days ago and bought V! Not sure short term how it's going to play out but I'm pretty sure long term should do me well?
Am grateful to buy the shares at a discounted price .
"Based on some quick math, looks like MA hit bear but V hasnt"
Went off a cliff in the last minute.
"If you think V & MC fees are high now, then just wait until they both up their fees in the near future. Kroger doesn't hurt Visa. Kroger will suffer. Too many Visa buyers can go elsewhere. Kroger already having a hard time with Amazon, Costco, and others. Better watch out. Might cut off their nose in spite of their face. VISA LONG."
V is very interesting. I'm using credit cards more and more to secure warranties and compliance with product standards. Cards give you extra leverage with the merchant. It's tougher getting cash back in other words. - Pete
"Massive jobs report, I think it's all up from here."
possible a surprise?????????????
There is only one card stock to own and it’s MasterCard. As proven once again. :))
Congrats to all who bought Visa at $180
"I am out of everything except for Visa which is a long term investment. I am only 35% invested. I would like to be fully invested in equities but the gyrations from the tarrifs and the outright lying by this administration has me cautious. In addition I may take a stake in MasterCard after it becomes evident that the Chinese with take all the pain we can offer and ask for more. Have we not learned from our mistakes in the past when at war with Asian people. Japan, Koreaa, Vietnam."
I bought at 172.01 yest and added to my existing. Up 2.00 afterwards. I like v better than ma.
Surely V will be upgraded after this report!
lol....Visa charging out the gate and announcing earnings shortfall on a huge market day.....hey lets get those cut numbers out there....maybe they wont notice.
Boom!
"this is a bargain now, remember the big (teckets) items when people start traveling all paid for by credit cards"
Jefferies upgraded Visa to Buy from Hold with a price target of $250
"I am also going to sell this. I will take only 2% profit, which hurts, but this investigation can be lengthy. Sorry."
To those compare Visa vesus Master Card..If the Visa is not split 1:4. The Visa to day value is $720.00 per share ( base on $180.00 ) or even more... So stop the nonsense compare these two special stocks..
"we need this to go above 228 EOD, then break out!"
$239 analyst price target
Dividend recording today or tomorrow?
visa and master card are doing good during the recession.
Love this stock! Buy and hold for a long time.
"Even with the drop today V traded up around 5% on MA earnings report....V went from $170 to $180 (approx) going into MA ER.Not sure if upside for a good ER is not already built in this price, maybe we get back to $180 or $185-$190 at best, but assume if over $185 it will drop a bit just like MA and settle around that $180 range for a while.What V and MA needs is the economy to re-open up; travel starts up again, restaurants fill up and overall confidence rises, and these companies (MA, V, AmExp) will skyrocket as plastic not dirty germ ridden cash will be the so called ""new normal""."
I think there is a good support around $170 based on the chart. Last draw down low is around $175 and I think we can retest that point. Will add to positions if it hits between $170 to $175. But will ease into positions since we don't have a clear picture about how long and how bad this coronavirus is impacting the world economics. Just need to be patient.
i only use V or AXP.
Dead money since July. Patience is needed. Hang tight.
More jobs = more Visa card swipes!
"papers money better than labour money about v, because papers money can boost people spend money more open, so Trump printing money for people was very good news for v, v sales will get second rebound, so v will be over$300."
2 1/2 bucks from ATH! territory.
To see one of the most beautiful charts ever click on the Visa Max
I remember paying 20$ per share... God Bless you VISA.
"Buy V today, stop borrowing stuff from your parents' pantry without replacing it in 2020."
$200 before Friday
Visa $182 forever
question: how do you guage when to buy more?
"I’m betting tomorrow, earnings get ignored and this moves based on the broader market"
Thumbs up for those of you that loaded on this latest dip. The 180 levels are an absolute steal for V.
Hope this doesn't become one of those stocks that stays stagnant for a decade.
"Visa usually runs up going into ER, I am looking for $145 prior to ER and I expect great results to take Visa to a new 52 week high."

""In certain categories, it's almost gone,"" said Erminia Johannson, BMO's group head of North American personal and business banking. ""There's nothing coming through on travel -- it's about 90 per cent down."
"Visa named IBD stock of the day pic, long-term looks super promising with many irons in the fire !! Read The IBD report today and you'll get some great insight as to what next year holds."
The analyst upgrade will push Visa over $170 next week. The shares are still dirt cheap at these levels. Strong buy!
Look at the upper end analyst price target... $300

$V | Visa Q1 20 Earnings Results:- Adj. EPS: $1.46 (Estimate: $1.46)- Revenue: $6.1B (Estimate: $6.06B)
Buy Visa if you think a cashless society is coming. E commerce is exploding. Stay at home. Plus the mint is way behind. How many times do you pay with your card? You probably use Visa... Visa is a better play than the dollar. Worldwide exposure
Why is it selling off after hours?
V is resilient to Trump's tweets ...
"Shorts will be working overtime today and probable for a few more days. Careful here. If your planning on building a position, watch for decent entry points.News will gradually be released and some if not most will be noise. Conviction in your investment is key."
Visa lost most of its gain whereas Mastercard gained 3%. What gives?
People are not going to want to use cash w CV! Go VISA
$191 X 10% run up would be $210. End of the month?
What do you think end the day around $193 $194?
"Typically, V and MA, do not require much patience from investors. Thats why I dont mind being patient right now. It's only a matter of time before I wont have to be patient anymore."

Finally a rise before the close
"V and MA representatives were in attendance today at the signing of the Chinese agreement. The Chinese have agreed to review letting them in without 90 days. If and when that happens, I figure V and A are going to the moon. Think of all the people who can get a card!!!!!"
V will be 185 in 6 months.
come to daddy---buy order @ 195.09 c'mon!
I think will be a good green today!

Visa is a strong buy under $200

Institutional investors are loading up shares. Buybacks should also begin soon. $170 before next earnings release.
33 p/e vs 42 for Mastercard. At similar p/e Visa is at $220. Ceo needs to wake up and pursue more growth opportunities.
Closed on the highs of the day
People are still using their Visa cards today. People will not stop using their Visa cards because of geopolitical issues.
So undervalued I am hoping for some more red days so I can keep getting these great discounts!
Bye bye plaid  maybe time to dump this for $PYPL now

"NICE BEAT VISA. I will hold for another 10 years, just hope they do not get behind in QR code paying and let Paypal take full control."
Thumbs up if you still use your Visa card even in a pandemic.
Next $1T Club
Thumbs up if you own a Visa card. The answer will explain why the stock is going to $200 in the next couple months.
Is 180 a good price to enter? Most probably the er will be good then there will be no chance that it will go down soon.
$59 - complete collapse is coming. $20
When would you recommend the best entry point?
I have owned Visa since it went public....will take this stock to retirement. great company and business model.

Visa cards can now be used in China
I love how humble this Visa forum is. It’s been breaking records day after day and only a few meek comments leaks out. I love you guys
Don’t forget about the COIN SHORTAGE. People have been using their card MORE THAN EVER for transactions. Don’t be surprised if V and MA post big beats!!!

I see other stocks having froze up issues XOM froze
V/Visa is probably the best possible investment in this current time... When times are tough.. people spend with a credit card... when times are great.... People spend with a credit card... This is a strong buy at this point...
We are on the march to $200. Shorts have no choice but to cover. Visa will soon be trading over $200 where it belongs.
"It's a slow grower. Buy, add more, hold = u will be rewarded."
"Of course V will beat. With the world on lock down nobody is paying with cash. And what's even better, people will get used to living cashless and Visa will benefit big from here on."
Backing the truck up! Love averaging down
Difficult to fathom how Amazon can be up 2% when Visa is down 7% today. The two companies are Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum for each other.
"Among financials, banks are taking a pause resulting in a bid for fintech. Round and round goes the merry-go-round."
Cramer likes V and MA at these levels!! Buy buy buy!! Zoom and boom!!! Longs goo longs!!
Reservations are popping all using Visa cards. Summer has begun!
240 todày
"I bought V shares but I had PYPL on my radar as well, maybe I made the wrong choice? In the long run this is a safer bet I guess."
Living requires spending money. Visa allows you to spend money safely. Strong buy!

"Really wish we would have a nice big sell off as I want to add to my ""V"" position."
Again... $9.5 billion dollar stock buyback plan... why would you even think about selling this stock?
Over 200. Nice. Got in at 130. And my wife too.
new lows enjoy those margin calls boys!
I love the fact that owning Visa helps me pay my Visa bill. Love this stock.
Pay attention to the lowest analyst price target
$300 this year
Let it drop. I missed the last buying opportunity.
Make Recessions Great Again!
I am in. couldn't resist this price
added at 137.75 today to my existing position. Go long on Visa and reap the benefits.
Visa is back up to pre-pandemic levels and Europe has not even opened yet
"Buy more V! With access to China's now $27 Trillion market, its run time! "
"USD 133 for V on pre-market opening for 10.11.18 ? That's a 15% drop in price since 150/share ... last week ? Now, just before V reports its earnings, that price drop strikes as a shake out by institutional ETF holders of V, who have to face up to massive ETF selling. Is V a tech stock ? Yes, it follows tech development in its systems, but does not produce hi-tech. Is V a financial stock ? Yes - but not in the banking sense of borrowing cheaper than loan rates. Selling overdone. A buy."
"instead of you people stating the price where it's going, how about simply explaining the price action of the day?"
I think it comes in at $1.26......solid beat
Is it a buy at $200?
Why it's not green
V is up 4.91% to $140.29

Keep cash on hand! I am down to my last 10k. My long term holdings are down 15%... but that’s life! Gotta roll with it and do NOT get rattled or shaken out!
Last chance to get in at these levels. Visa will be much higher next week.
Transmission of Corona Virus germs has prompted some counties Treasury Depts to literally burn their cash currencies found to be a major source of lingering germs. Hence Paypal taking off and MasterCard and Visa not far behind
"I noticed the Visa MB doesn't get the attention the AAPL, AMZN, MSFT MB's get. Can't imagine why. Check the charts, Visa's performance has been nothing short of amazing."
When will Visa leave San Francisco? Schwab left and now Pinterest is laying the ground work by no renewing their lease
growth of ecommerce
The one year target estimate here is 140. One year is in two weeks.
This is the best IPO I ever bought and I will ride it as long as I am alive!￼
Thanks visa for a great discount yesterday. I see Mrs V going up another 3% today. I love VISA
Just based on the P&G earning result and report claiming “consumers are spending a lot” I reckon most of them uses their Visa or Master cards... hence we will be going to see a bigger growth in those companies!
More people are ordering online with Amazon which means more revenue for Visa
"I know that VISA warned recently, but I still feel that the stock can reach the $235-$250 range by year end based on fundamentals and momentum. After coronavirus, I think numbers will return exponentially( especially at first, because of pent up demand). LONG VISA"
I think 112-113 is reasonable

"yeah visa to go down much more, but long term great buy."
I'll be buying more tomorrow if this after hours dip bleeds into tomorrow. Absolutely wonderful earnings.
Commentary suggests another down day due to rapid Interest rate rise threats!How can the price target be increased? Do these analysts not read the news?

"Payment processing is a profitable business. Visa stock leads most rivals with a 66% pretax profit margin. Visa's 36% return on equity far exceeds the minimum 17% or higher investors would want to see.Digital payments — fueled by the rise of 5G networks — are a growth opportunity. Visa's real-time push in payments technology has seen robust growth during the pandemic.In June, Visa announced it's partnering with Facebook (FB) on WhatsApp payments in Brazil.

"Seems like somebody is alternating between MA, Sq, PYPL and V taking them down and then letting them come back up"
"It makes sense to me that if the virus is keeping people home, that they will order on line --- groceries and other stuff and they will be using a credit card."
Wild swing today. Anyone think the market bleed out is over? All the calls for a flat market in 2019 make me not confident about short term volatility.
I like the Visa has their own blockchain. They understand future trends. My guess is somewhere between $230-$245 this year. LONG VISA
Visa should be trading over $200 already. Amazing opportunity.
For noobs wanting to enter 203 is the buy point so up to 210 you are good
Slowly but Surely..Great..
When a drops at the open I'm going all in.
good price to get in this would be $177 by end of the day..
Why the sudden drop?
Such a good opportunity
Giddy up ; we need it after the last two days

Thumbs up if you have a Visa card in your wallet or purse.
"If Mastercard is up today, Visa should as well.There is just no way, MA can do better than V."
Blockfi partnership with Visa to creat a reward card in Bitcoin. This is really a game changer. I think Visa moving to the right direction and it will exceed Master by miles.

Report on Earnings after the Market Close.
Anyone concerned with the fed raising rates and how this would affect visa? Any input would be appreciated!
"don't worry,money more than before in this covid-19 crisis, some people make money more than before,I think wages and inflation will surge after covid-19 end,so v reach$350 no any problems, almost all things price has been raised in this covid-19 crisis, people spend more v got more,"
Hopefully V hit new Hi today..
"EU Resolution, yet another short term catalyst to new highs"
Why the drop today?
Simple market rotation
"Is it me or does V have the best balance sheet of any of the CC companies? (MA, AXP)"
"trust me to buy, only to watch it fall."
"Article from 2009:BOSTON (AP) — Visa said Wednesday its fiscal first-quarter profit rose by 35 percent as the shift from cash toward electronic payments maintained its staying power, even while consumers tightened spending amid the recession.The results beat Wall Street expectations, and shares of Visa rose nearly 8 percent after the regular trading session. Visa also reiterated expectations for earnings growth of more than 20 percent for its current fiscal year, even though it scaled back its revenue forecast, warning of slower growth in the spring and summer."
Let's see if we can close above 200. V and MA are on the verge of taking out their pre-pandemic highs.
This should be at $185 by now. Let’s go!!!
Relax all of you visa shareholders.Visa will beat earnings once againAnd xmas is right around the corner.The march is on to higher ground.
Why down 20% in after hours?
Low volume growth? Aren’t there already more Visa cards than people or something and more people using cards than ever before? Don’t need more volume growth if revenue and earnings are good. Just keep swiping those cards.
"Analysts’ recommendationsAfter Visa’s second-quarter earnings release, Susquehanna raised its target price for the stock from $165 to $190. KBW raised its target price for Visa from $179 to $188. On April 23, Jefferies raised its target price for Visa from $175 to $190. Morgan Stanley raised its target price for the stock from $165 to $173.Among the 39 analysts covering Visa, 14 recommended a “strong buy,” 22 recommended a “buy,” and three recommended a “hold.” The mean target price for Visa is $170, which implies an upside potential of ~5% from its current price."

And again 180...
The economy is getting back to normal and more people are shopping online than ever before. Visa directly benefits.
Going long on VISA as the US economy opens up.
"So many complain about the $2 profit taking from $178 to $176. What is not taken into account, is that the earnings buzz saw this jump at close and AH yesterday, from $170 to $178 AH today. There will always be a pullback after a gain like that, and we could easily go higher tomorrow. So take a xanax or something."
$150 coming up
Wow 200! I did not expect that to happen so quickly. Yipee.
Biological warfare killing the global market.
Dropping to $205 before close. Monday market closed.

"As we near 24K on INDU we r at ""over-bought"" and expect a pull back soon.... V is down 3% and might test the 50 day MA around 108.00"
no one is using cash
"I really think V is the very best in the entire market. It doesn't get a lot of press, which is my kind of stock. It goes up and maintains the price, isn't volatile and it is necessary to life. Amazon gets mentioned about every 10 word on CNBC and V gets mentioned when earnings come out and that is about all. They don't even realize on CNBC how good V is. They don't talk about how necessary it is to have a credit card or other investors would get in."
"I'm starting to believe if Amazon is doing well, Visa will do well. What do you think?"

"Back in after 3 years, this started me off making good money only to panic cause of pods trump, who I voted for, lost me 1/2 of it with amzn. Staying in v for a long time, better for the nerved"
Visa is a fast growing tech company! Very undervalued here!
Got this and wish I hadn’t Waste of time
thank pelosi
Why sell? Have people stopped using Visa cards? No.
Look at the chart and volume right now! Accumulating...then surging all the sudden
i hope we really crush the earning! starting to get worried.

Pretty severe rotation out of high multiple growth stocks is happening.........actually started in earnest yesterday. Multiple compression can be difficult to process because on one level it defies logic. V's biz model and prospects have not changed. But the market's willingness to pay up for its earnings has.
Going under $200 next week. Keep selling. Don’t buy still too expensive.
Safest investment out there probably.
shorting at 184.54 thanks for the free money!
"Up $4.35 today , that is the first sign of great things to come, get on board, new highs ahead !"
Walmart is starting to sell off big V is on deck !
Visa should turn their focus to beans and rice. Works for Chipotle...unreal.
Guess people realize PE is still over 32 at this price.
Go V! 
The first stock i ever bought. Your not suppose to fall in love with Stocks but I love my Visa. Visa deserves more days like this
"V, Ma not considered financial stocks. As a matter of fact, they are considered TECHNOLOGY stocks. Not going back to $150 any time soon, unless something really bad happens over in Hong Kong. LONG V since 2008."
Ok today 145 easy
this thing is at best dead money. I read so many bullish analyst reports on how V was a great stock to own. now I'm reading about how competitors are undercutting them. looking at a chart and money flows it's looking lethargic. someone earlier posted that $175 is where V is heading and unfortunately I agree
A great day for the best stock ever..
"The first time the Visa stock is positive while the Nasdaq is negative, after reported the quarter end. Im happy. Normally Visa will be Negative after release the number..Only the long holder will notice."
the failure of the second stimulus bill obviously isn't helping here
people taking profits
$200 stock
Fridays chart shows technical hammer. 250 EOY
Looking for $188-189 to buy in the weeks to come.
Boom! Just a matter of time. I should have bought more.
Visa's quarterly results just underscore that debt is the primary product manufactured in the US.
"OK, WTHeck happened today? The ER for Thursday, is it still predicted to beat estimates?"
Welcome to the party!!!
$142 today. Visa will run up into earnings.
V is down 5.76% to 196.78
Long for day when we'll see $5 rise in one day

Congrats longs busted through 203 with above average volume now we get moving
"V did great and V is down after hours , ridiculous ...I own MA not V"
"Yes, short term digital payments skyrocketed due to necessity. However, the bills are in the mail and payment will be difficult for people without jobs. So I predict the next couple of months will show the opposite in terms of usage. Visa is still a great company, just be realistic and don't expect new highs anytime soon."

When will they declare their dividend ?
earnings results anyone?
https://www.cnbc.com/select/last-minute-holiday-shopping-visa-signature-concierge/
lol why
Bear  market hallmark pump and dump
Do people think V has exposure to credit card debt? Very odd.
CEO Mr. Alfred must be doing so well with Visa. Glad I met him 2 years ago. I wish I had the stock back then even though I had the opportunity to. Buying on a dip.
Buy and hold this puppy aka V forever. You'll do well over long term
anything posted about trump is ok. but anything posted about china gets deleted by yahoo
A ton of places I shop have not been accepting Visa credit cards any longer. I hope this isn't a trend.
Come on V I want my $2.00 back.
V will go nuts in 2021 when pandemic passes and people start traveling again... load up now
thank you big v
The lowest price target is $207. This price is a gift.
The lowest analyst target for Visa is $175... this price is an absolute gift. Visa will be trading over $200 before the next earnings release.
200 here we come. It’s about tiem
My EOY target for V: 169.
"No time for f.e.a.r in buying V by retail investors today!- It’s time to back up the truck when one of the great global business goes on sale — with the global economy projected to grow like a weed over the next 24 months!*** Don’t you dare look this V “gifthorse” in the mouth — just buy as much as you can, and give thanks to Providence  for this wonderful opportunity!"
just great!!!!!
Fed has killed the golden goose !
Is this rout going to stop above $140? Lost confidence
The Market was at all time high and a correction was overdue and the CR virus was the catalyst to do it. Unfortunately things are going to get worse and it's best to watch and wait on the sidelines until the some clears. I love the big V and will load up at lower levels!
next stop for V is $150!!!
A buy here. V does the same each quarter beats then falls only to rise following day. No brainer.
Visa going to be 210
Buying more... Holiday shopping season is approaching. Online sales will surge
buy when drop...
"great company, broken stock. Be months for this to move up. Second quarter, maybe"
Selling the winners of the past year to buy the trash stocks.
"Down after er? We need more 'vig' from the ""regulator"" Federal Reserve."
Does anyone know why V down so hard yesterday and today?
not a fan but Cramer once said- before you sell always remember why you bought the stock in the first place
Wow! Visa will reach $200 soon
"Also, what these boobs say is an indicator of retail trader sentiment but we all know that retail traders have not held the majority of volume in decades. Everyone here can be bullish but keep in mind, hedge funds and institutions hold 50% of market volume. And if you were a money manager, would you be looking to enter, downsize, exit, or add onto your position? Given the risk profiles of institutions, I guarantee you the only things they would be willing to do is, downsize, or exit if they are super conservative."
Visa is a credit card and a technology stock. Buy now!!!
V at 400 in 2024 ?
"Been on an incredible run since Dec 24, 2018. More $$ to be made this year."
"I'm looking to buy more at $176.00. Depending how fast we get there. (Not if, when.)"
"Hey John, how are your pretend short positions working out? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
Holiday spending season not going well. Bad for Visa and Mastercard.
150 wooo
buy buy now
Can some one please explain what’s going on here
"Don’t understand the negativity about Visa some are expounding. You could have a shoebox full of $100. bills but you still need plastic to buy these days. Visa has no financial exposure. If cardholders are unable to pay,its the responsibility of the issuing bank. Processing companies will flourish."
let the good times rollby the carsgoogle it punkhaha
$300 is a cheap price target for Visa. People are out spending everywhere this weekend. Buy now or regret it later.
240 run comming + intrest
$300 price target
35 analysts have 12 month price targets ranging from $239 down to $175 with an average guess of $203.43.
"When does everybody think V will split and what will it be, 2:1?"
"Wow, can't beat on a Christmas quarter!"
Let's go for $220 and break open the champagne bottles early this year.
Still predicting $200 before next earnings report??????
What’s a good entry point for VISA? Have been waiting for $160 for a while and reckon we will hit that at some point in next 2 weeks.
Good buying opportunity!
all we are going to do is take risk visa 300. but we cannot sell anything .. . and not give all profit to joe anyone see the new tax plain??? sorry i voted poorly..
There is resistance at $215.00. Lets see if V can overcome it.
$V Target Raised by Barclays Overweight USD 225 » USD 235
"Wanted to get into V for a while, finally in at $189"
My apartment complex and others around me (my friends have confirmed) are allowing tenants to pay with Credit Cards during quarantine. Not sure if this is happening anywhere else? Comment below what your thoughts are on this. Is this accepting too much risk?
I got a chance to but when it pulled back and now it looks like it was too soon
It’s time to play the rebound in V at this discount level!
Should break thru the all time high this week
"why I bought visa stock - with the holiday season coming up and the rebound of the economy, I think this holiday season is going to be booming. also, as Amazon and other online retail eats away at brick and mortar, more people are using credit cards for transactions. owning visa is a way to profit off the shift in how people shop, especially during the holiday season"
Back over $200 soon
"Visa is the real crypto currency. You can buy anything and everything with visa. Both Credit and Debit. Its the top currency better than the U.S. Dolla, and Bitcoin which is nonsense. This one is the real deal. Plastic is elastic and its super bubble plastic."
"In the last earnings report (1 week ago) Visa posted very impressive numbers on both top and bottom line. Mastercard on the other hand had poor earnings as half their revenue was due to incentives. Visa is doing far better than Mastercard on the earnings and revenue. Also, Visa Europe integration is going very well, which will add big time to revenues. Two analysts on BNN picked Visa as their top pick, with a one year target price of $164Below are the two comments:Kim Bolton: Oct. 31He has a 12 month price target of $164. It is not a value orientated company, but has high profit margins and plenty of free cash flow. It has delivered capital appreciation and dividend growth. In this pull back it is a good buy. Yield 0.7%. (Analysts’ price target is $163.06)Barry Schwartz: Oct. 31Everybody uses credit cards or phones and nobody pays cash. This is an incredible business. Terrific earnings, raising their dividend 17%. He believes more people will use Visa and that global growth will continue. (Analysts’ price target is $163.06)"
Why so many bot messages on this board instead of real people.Good luck folks for tomorrow.
Why is Target tanking prevmarket ? Anyone know ?
I tripled down today. I just feel good about V!
Use your common sense. More online retail sales equals more revenue growth for Visa. Also the holiday shopping season is coming.
Visa has never been a fast mover. Also there were a few rough years in there at the start. (0bama years for sure).This is exciting to see it going up by several dollars at a time. This is a long hold for life.
ATH 
Buy Buy Buy Keep it pumped Never Sell Nothing can go wrong.
Visa stock is the gift that keeps on giving.
One price target upgrade will take this to $230
"The Amazon Rewards Visa and Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature cards have become hot items for frequent Amazon shoppers, and for good reason: They are great cards that, for the most part, can’t be beat when it comes to earning cash back on Amazon purchases."
New all time high today. John's Visa short ensures he never leaves mom's basement.
I wish I had more money to buy. This is a prime example of market manipulation that happens in plain sight for the big boys to big up cheap shares. If you have money BUY BUY BUY
Visa is the ultimate reopening stock
added first position
What is going on? Down big now after hours. What the heck
Will 190 hold? Seems the 190 area is turn around level since March. Coming of a good qtr?
Is earning before or after the bell?
"Fed will printing more money into market,the government and people and company will increase debt, so V Jpm and GS will up 100%,"
Have held Visa for years but sold my position in the last run up. This is not about their earnings but the market sentiment and it is about to turn. I will own Visa again but at a lower price.
How soon before we reach $200?
OUTPERFORM initiated today by Bernstein!What happened to the market???
"Consumer debt at all time high,,not a good sign."
Tomorrow is the next leg down.
buy back 9.5 billions.
Visa will forever be a part of our future
AMEX ER and strong guidance bodes we’ll for V.
i never understand the panic when a stock goes through its routine and pulls back
"Highest consumer debt in years, not good.."
$251 price target
Long squeeze
In February 2009 the stock market bottomed. The economy did not get back to normal for years later. Buy now and hold.
wow shoulda bot at 190 :( wow
"And this is why there is waaaaay more to earnings than the simple numbers...kinda angers me, because it’s an “earnings report”, not a “ancillary projects” report."
"Monday, April 29 is another good day for Visa.."
Buying with both hands
"opened a new position today, 15 shares @$175, executed. will dollar cost average in 15 shares every couple fridays till the hurting stops then hold for life. nice opportunity on something that never goes on sale."
Visa + Square + Mastercard =$$$$$$$$$$$
Sweet Jesus I was starting to get worried there
"Well boys you can tear off the rear view mirror, we are moving forward and not looking back!"
"Remember... people are still buying Tesla, Apple, Zoom, etc. at all time highs. Visa is very undervalued."
Wed will be a good day for the market
Massive buying opportunity!!
This is the gravitational pull to $200
V now +0.30% !
A great earnings report from Mastercard and American Express bodes well for Visa! 
"Tomorrow we'll be up a few %. If a stock is going to drop after earnings, it is ""generally"" more than this."
Visa has to close above $180 today!
Let’s make it ALL TIME HIGH once again!
"oil down nearly 5% today and job report miss by over 100k jobs, markets are up.. LOL"
"Everything nowadays is online, from subscription to shopping.Long MA & V"
perfect backbone stock to protect your portfolio during this tough summer
MW has V up $14 pre
I might just put half of all my money in this for the rest of my life till 60yrs old and retire with a boat and sail off into the sunset
If there isn't a rate cut then this will pull back hard.
V one of the few stocks up in my portfolio today.
Will run to $220 after earnings and john will be evicted from his mom's root cellar.
Will double in time.
New high to day. Love it.Slowly but surely.
Visa is the perfect stock imo. Will do well in the shift to online. Will do well if there is another lockdown. Will do well if there is a gentle easing with contactless. Will do well all round. And doesn't fall too much when the market sells off. Buy and hold. And not at AS crazy a valuation as the other big cap tech stocks.
Last chance to buy before the race begins.
The last split was on 3/18/2005 and visa share price at that time was $248. we are getting close.
Visa is the best stock ever!!! $150 coming soon!
I don't understand why anyone would short this
"Said it before...it was necessary for it to go down to $200 for it to move higher....here we are, not even 2 1/2 weeks later and bam!!"
Online purchase CASH or CARD? YOU TELL ME!
$18 gained back in the last month. Visa continues to be the best investment I've ever made.
"Buy V today, stop waiting tables in 2021 for extra money to pay the rent."
Not smart to be short Visa going into the holiday season. Shorts will feel pain for the rest of the year.
$300 stock because of the reopening
Stimulus Plan finalized. Stocks will rise into close.
Visa can fully capitalize on Bitcoin just like Square and Cash App.....their brand equity and distribution offers amazing moat. Square is rallying while Visa being overlooked....I suspect this will change.
The Wealth Effect is working in Reverse and will cause a huge drop in Retail sales for The critical Q4...
Lots of stimulus passed by Congress will flow through V & MA!** These stocks are on sale at today’s trading levels!
I don't get it... ARKF up 28% YTD and this is down minus 5% YTD
big boys trying to shake out small investors!
$300 by the end of 2020
disaster coming on next quarterly project. Transactions will be down over 90% globally.
"These prices are a GIFT and will not last long. Unlike the banks, Visa takes no credit risk. Consumers will continue to buy online if they don’t feel comfortable purchasing in stores."
This is all Trump trying to force the Fed to do 4 rate cuts. It's a done deal.
what news am I missing? why down?
Bitcoin as a payment tool is benefiting V the biggest in the whole industry! V is always the most prominent!
just on CNBC. stimulus money going out as Visa debit cards not cheques.
"Beat revenues, beat EPS, improved outlook for 2019. All in all an earnings beat. I think people were expecting a heavier beat and that's the reason for the sell off. No reason to not hold onto this given the ER they just put out today."
Longs have made a fortune on this. Owned this since 2012 and my the riches and rewards.... Got into MA last year and that's been no slouch either.
Here what's I seen?Very first time in a long time. The Visa is up after earning. So your young horse and new comers for this board shall be happy and remember the 52 weeks hi of V is in the range of $185.00.Do not expecting the V will be over $200.00 in short time then split !@ Split not helping anymore.
4th quarter beats projections and stock goes down?
Time to fly!!
114.51 on January 2nd. Still climbing.
"How many people will be spending their Stimulus money with Visa cards? Online, contactless, booking hotels/flights, paying bills, etc. Strong Buy at these levels."
Just joined visa! Hey guys!
When Visa stock drops...as goes the market..
Here’s your buying opportunity @ 4% discount from high of last week.
sideways movement is driving me nuts. what's going on?
if or when Visa is fully allowed in China.... $300
I keep telling the board this is going to 75 soon . Be happy ut is cause it will be a great buy there.
Less cash being used=more money for visa. This stock is a no brainer. Long live Visa!
The lowest price target is $216. Very undervalued.
"awesome, rebounding nicely"
buying more during this week
paypal hardly beat and is up. what would us shorts do without these kinda moves?
0.86 EPS vs 0.81 estimates. ITS A BEAT BOYS!
"27m shares short. 1.52% of float as of 31st Oct.Not a lot really.Shows it was genuinely sold back in October.If that motley ool article is correct, $8.5bn in buybacks being returned to stockholders in 2019 is pretty impressive. Really generate a lot of FCFIf only they could buyback at today's prices, they'd be able to wipe out 59m shares.They'v3 spent $7.5bn on buybacks this year."
Worldpay is surging higher
V plunged in the last minute with no news. Stocks will behave strangely on the brink of a crash. This is what happened right before the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Most likely large holders are dumping it.
180 gonna be a tough hold. Apple is strong again today. Once it tops out money will begin flowing into V.
"stock market for some people is an obsession, myself included. it's money we put in and probably never see again, because if you have 1mil you want to bring it up to 2mil then 3 then 4. and then before you know you're old and die and leave it all behind. therefore you should take your money out and spend it on your visa card. ( I own the stock)"
Green today!
what happened????
This stock is fun to own
V needs to rise its dividend !! With all the projected growth a less than 1% dividend is kinda lame !
I love the fact that V quietly goes up and no one ever talks about it. That is my kind of stock.
Love that dividend raise! $$$$$
"Any original posters on the Visa message board from it's IPO date?Back in the years (2008 to 2010) there were a core group of posters on here, just wondering if any are around or lurk here from time to time.Posters handle names:BadpirateLineblockIithirJugglesKensamakrealistJc6969many more just do not remember there names."
I like the stock. 300$ this year anyone?
Visa has the best chart I've ever seen.
Green before the market closes today
"V's stock price descent (USD 152) on 04.01.20 is in lock-step with the S+P500.Such makes no sense - V is a known - the SP500, as a bunch of unknowns, is not."
LAST CALL!!!!! If you want to buy below 200
Merry Christmas
Visa will trade upward to $200+ by earnings
Ahhh...back to the good ol days!
Tech and finance down this morning. Looking for reasons. Anyone?
Visa will breakout over $170 after earnings beat
"Held since 2013, enjoyed burying short sellers along the way."
I'm long Visa. bought it. IPO and been buying since.
seems like it only make sense to buy after earnings is out. 155 to enter...
Interesting that Mastercard has been trading a little bit ahead of Visa lately. Usually they trade identically.
I got in at $112 and got out at $185.I just felt it was time to take the profit but still like the stock.
V broke out yesterday. I think they are having a conference today.
"I will be adding more at $128, this was where it hit back in October drop."
V is up 6.65% to 164.81
"Nomura Instinet’s Bill Carcache raised his price target from $105 to $120, and Barclays’ Darrin Peller upped his to $114."
"buy now coz tomorrow its earnings date for V also, soon there will be 0 quantity for V"
"I mean you buy anything anywhere, amazon, facebook, Walmart, whatever and you most likely use a Visa card. You have to use a debit card you still use visa debit. More use than any other card, why is it lagging Mastercard? I er just Dunno."
"Anyone notice Citigroup raised our PT from $160 to $168, yesterday?"
Buying more. This is a gift.
"This stock is gold dust, $400 stock within the next 2-3 years thanks to covid. Cash is becoming a thing of the past"
"Where is ""Bad decision Brian"" that dumped Visa??"
"Another new all time high for Visa. Where are the short sellers? Also, where are the bulls. Isn't this cause for celebration, or does Visa make all time highs so often it's to be expected?"
It’s wise for V to drop Plaid at this point!
Perfect time to buy!
Visa is green today and the overall market is flat
I can see 180 today
"Both V and MA reported solid earnings and guidance and both will hit new highs very soon, no worries. I think and would like your opinion: is todays drop due to AMZN announcement yesterday about using Alexa to widen thier influence in the payment space. AMZN is always a disruptor and rarely stay in their lane. So is this inactivity or small drop after great ER for both a response to this AMZN announcement?"
"Owen, I like to reassure you this is a good investment in a great company. I've bought and sold at least 3 times over the last 6 or so years and made a lot of cash every time. You just have to be patient. It may not be the hottest or most stylish stock out there but if you don't have money to lose and have time, I can't see how you can go wrong. I've bought the hot stocks over the years and have gotten burned and lost a lot of money. After that, I've learned what it means to invest - search for companies with great balance sheets, make lots of money and have a competitive edge. Visa and Mastercard fit that criteria. Square on the other hand, may continue to climb like a rocket but sooner or later, you could get burned."
VISA - MASTERCARD -SQUARE $$$$$$$ the huge money-making Trio! $$$
For a new investor would one recommend buying Visa for the long term???
Curious why no one thinks this Dow Component is not overpriced at 40x earnings.
we were looking good this morning.
Old highs just keep getting taken out. Gotta love this.
Is it worth it for someone to take a run at V and get it over $215 by Friday?
Looks like another down day.....Are we going to hit $131 again?...One day I'll figure out how to buy low and sell high.
All time highs on the way!
V is down 8.36% to 158.50
December 20th options look interesting
"i thought earnings rep. is tomorrow , isnt it?"
why is it dropping AH?
Keep buying the dips. Sell in 2030.
I get sick from people asking why Visa is down 1% thought it’s more than 30% from couple of months back if you are a day trader this is not your stuff go for Tesla then one day you woke up losing all of your money
V or SQ....which would you longs add to?
Share buybacks have accelerated
"PE needs to be corrected to 15-20 times before it is a good buy. stay out until then, its coming."
$200 after earnings release
Visa (V) is toast!
12 month target prices from 36 different analysts range from the lowest $175 to the highest of $231 with an average (guess) of $201.33.
"Just bought 2,000 shares at $121.90. Looking for a good bounce this afternoon."
Visa on a roll! Love the sound of money!
"Visa Inc. (V), Director, Matschullat Robert W, Filled Form 4, on 03/18/2021, Disposed 29,956 shares, at Price $223.02 worth $6,680,787. Follow On Instagram, money_insider_stocknewsFacebook, Earnegy InvestmentsFor Stocks Inside News and Details."
"Why would you sell Visa going into a period of increased spending through sports, concerts, travel, and entertainment? Visa will make more money this year than last year."
It was smart to drop guidance as it would be in poor taste to admit that Covid-19 will probably be positive for future results. Online orders are up and so are online charges. Time will tell....
Will we hit $100 by year end?
will enter longs at low 140's. keep buying the tops my retail friends.
EPS $1.20 vs $1.09 and revenue of $5.24 Biilion vs $5.09 Billion. A solid beat
im long on visa but i cant say im happy with the opportunity cost ive lost
Tambo210 why all the hate?
It’s a dog with fleas...
Going red and under $200 by end of the week!
"I bought V about 7 years or so back for $ 67 a share, then it hit 220 around 3 years back and split 3 for 1 and was down to $ 67 a share and then it has moved to $120 a share so I bought some more and then it kept moving and now it is stalled at $ 169 so should I panic and sell or should I hold tight?"
Just got my dividend from Visa
Any upgrades announced yet?
The big V catching bids today.
coming very soon
"I LOVE red right before earnings...just adds to the gains, sell all you want, papa bear is here to buy all your scraps."
Walmart just broke 70 seconds ago !
Normal consolidation after huge run. Buy and forget it.
Only $3 away from the pre pandemic high. MA already took out its pre pandemic high V will take out their's very shortly. Long both stocks and added to my positions on the pandemic floor in March.
Just a matter of time for this company to hit the $200. range.To many people use everyday & worldwide for it not to happen!
flat six months; down past month; no dividend; bad investment; too much competition.
Interesting to see SYF outperform V MA and AXP this past month. Guess that’s what happens when you’re patient and invest in the undervalued
"Who needs GME when you got the ""V"" !"
No one has stopped using their Visa cards. Very undervalued at these levels. Buy the dip.
How will people buy the new iPhones... credit and debit cards!
People are buying Apple today that’s up 100% in the past 12 months. Visa is extremely undervalued at these levels.
"TheStreet just released an article that better explains it if you're blocked by the WSJ paywall. ""The Journal said the DoJ's antitrust division is looking into allegations that Visa limited the ability of merchants to route debit card transactions in order to limit so-called 'network fees'."""
2-for-1 split....
"I wish it drops more after hours, then I would just BUY more of V."
Would not mind seeing another stock split in the near future.
"When the blood is in the street, buy more, great opportunity. I keeping adding small amounts."
$200 on the way
"The market turns on a dime. When they find a cure for the chinese govt disease, and they will, markets will go crazy."
"This is a GIFT of your LIFETIME at these levels. I’m still holding positions @ 31, 50, 77, i3, i5, 117 and YES, today I bought at 135. When the dust settles and smoke clears, if YOU buy at these levels you will thank me and send flowers of joy in less than one year. There is NOTHING that can slow this monster. Visa: it’s not sexy. It’s not interesting. It’s not stylish. But itbwill make YOU, a LOT of $$$$$$$$$$$. BUY IT. Thank me profusely in 2019. I’m a BUYER and BULL longterm holder of VISA. Compare their 2,3,5y chart against AAPL. I’ll take VISA."
"Forget V and buy STNE for real growth and no Fed interference, join Buffett in making billions"
It just needs to roll over 210 before close
"30m shares shorted as of 15th Jan.Amounts to nothing given its less than 2% of float,"
"what happened ... they bot into a credit company... ""Paidy"" .. all I can see!they taking on credit risk going into that....now they only have fee income..."
Isn’t it time to raise the dividend or announce a share buyback?
I made a video about Visa ($V)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnoqc5Ze0WsThey will make x10 in 20 years!
Price target is $231
Great hold in a sell off
$150 this week
where is our friend John for analysis?
"John come to the light all is forgiven ...everyone has ""I thought it was a good idea at the time"" moment"
"holding this stock for the last 5 months makes me feel like a hamster on a Pelaton. Get up early, sweat a lot, but get nowhere."
It should close above $175 today. What do you think?
"Well, the orange one has spoken. Expect the market to drop Monday, March 30, 2020."
buying at 130
"hope we stay green for the day, but have my doubts. hope this wasn't another failed break out attempt. options exp and economic headwinds are keeping this range bound. would love to see a large vol spike and a close at the top of the range"
All those online sales had to be using a credit card and Visa is the largest one.
just about a good price
Now is a good time to buy .
Why the liftoff? FAANG getting too toppy?
Who thinks this will cross $140 soon?
Right now Visa is sitting right on the 200 dma. If this breaks and doesn’t bounce back then it’s heading lower for sure!!! Have cash ready to buy at much lower levels!!!
Visa is a $300 stock
oh noi sold yesterdayhahaha just kidding
Visa is connected to bitcoin. Will go higher and higher!
My one regret in life is that I didn't have more money to invest at the IPO.
Visa. The only stock where you can actually feel at ease when holding. A force of nature. THE BEAST!!!!! 220 EOY !!!!
I'm loving Visa! $$$ How many people on here also own Square?
Visa will accelerate growth this year... $300 price target
finally
buy ARKX and BLNK and CRSP and NEE today for great 1 year returns
Stuck at $174 for four days.
Bullish case is strong but you ought to remember V is already a 430 billion company. Not much upside but great long term hold.
This is going back below 180 once people realize Donald Trump has serious chance of second term
another 5 percent up tomorrow after earnings.
recovering nicely
Oh oh! Reality starting to set in. Its a long way down!Theres always a lag in the market vs economy.No wonder Warren Buffet was sitting on the side line not deploying his cash.Timber......
Could push thru $200 today
"Great company, great financials and a great price to buy in. This remains one of my favorite stocks. E-commerce is on the rise especially now in Europe due to the current health crisis. I just bought more stock and will continue to add to my position while its stocks sits at such low prices. 300.00 by the end of this year is a reasonable price target I'd say."
"When Goldman issues a buy or conviction rating, it usually means the party is over and they are telling their rich clients to start selling. V is a good company but don't trust Goldman."
"Hey guys/gals/others, be careful in here now, we may have had some short covering today, but that doesn’t mean the downside risk is over. Expect more noise from CNBC and shorts to drum up drama and possibly people like Elizabeth Warren to champion the far left. Their a lot of sympathy out there now for the consumer, and rightfully so, given what we’ve been through. But the good fight hasn’t been won yet and I suspect more negative press will come out before this is over. Stay long, and visa will prevail"
Wow! AH doesn't look pretty.Battered tomorrow it suggests.Bought V at 147 hoping for a quick 1% rise. Nursing a 10% fall
"Being long for many years, V has become a high expectations stock on a fiscal report. In order for the shares to pop convincingly after earnings release, not only must it beat guidance, but must also beat by a percentage that investors anticipated that it would surpass the analyst expectation. Then the release must not show any deceleration in forward revenues or rising expenses. Finally, it needs to beat by such a margin that the run-up of the last month seems reasonable. That is all possible; the moon and the stars are aligned, but I would be just happy to have the shares consolidate around these levels on the release."
still not done it has just begun!
"if you believe in triple bottoms, 132 looks like it an the 1 yr."
Will the launch of google pay strengthen Visa’s anti trust appeal?
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/amazons-prime-best-holiday-season-1-billion-echo-alexa/
Going above $200 on Monday morning because of the stimulus executive order.
Strong jobs report! Holiday spending will be huge! Buy Visa!
Online sales on Black Friday we're absolutely amazing. Visa stands to benefit.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/24/black-friday-pulled-in-a-record-6point22-billion-in-online-sales-adobe.html
"Visa is better than Mastercard, it's extremely undervalued!"
"I bought this company at it's IPO, buy and hold forever this is a titan."
if market reverses and goes positive V could go negative.
Let's see if it can hold this one.
"IS this falling due to partial holiday in FED funds, etc?"
Massive share buyback program
"If and when this clears 205.6, there is a gap to fill....COME ON VISA"
Let's Go V!!!
"Think about what businesses were closed in April, May, and June of last year. Very low comps from the 2nd quarter of 2020. Visa will reach $300 this year."
V is nearing its 52 week high!!! GO V GO!!!
Visa has had a nice run. Must break that $180 point. Has been difficult. LONG VISA since 2008
"I don't see how it drops on earnings, its not an industrial manufacturer, it's a credit card company. People are going to be living off their visa's for the next 9 months at least."
"No need to sell any shares for 172.50 AH, when this will be $175 plus in the morning."
Anyone hearing the call? Next earning is also going to be HUMONGOUS.
I already am in for long but still waiting for a pullback to add more but that does not seem to be coming any days soon. :-(Needs a war or recessions or something to bring this stock down.
V should run at or about 230 upto earnings call. Hang on.
GO V GO!!!
$3 from all time high. Here it comes.
CDC will be recommending going cashless as much as possible
Everyone needs to write there congressman a letter to try and make it law that Creditors cannot charge anyone more than 10 percent interest. these loan sharks are charging upwards to 30 percent And it hurts the economy.
"I'm in Visa since the IPO. Yes, I've added to my position. Each time thinking am I buying at too high a price since my original purchase. The answer has always been, no. Now, it's my second biggest holding. Be a believer in Visa."
Headed to $200 now
should I sell?
"Yep, I agree. Anypulback on V, i am accumulating The same with AAPL....buying a lot and holding for tonite. BUY BUY"
"Business which is immune to covid. E-commerce, retail, fintech and many others are depending on VISA. Long live the V!"
"If Visa's offer to Earthport is accepted, how do you feel this would impact the visa stock?"
Looking good to get to 141.00 any minute. I’m buying before goes to 145.00 pop it baby
I own alot of visa... but let's not forget cross border travel is still closed... this is a long term play not a get rich over night stock...I'm holding.. but I dont expect to much until international travel really comes back
easy buy chance here. Way too low atm.
Hold and pass down to your grand kids. Visa isn't going anywhere. My only regret is not taking out a loan on my house when the IPO was issued.
Where is the 200?? It’s been too undervalued
"$3.00 Down in after market, only because AMEX was downgraded. lol. Buying the dip on Visa!"
Buy V now before it’s too late
"So all we needed to break out was a trade deal? Buy V today, eat Chinese food in 2020!"
"Visa Inc. Reports Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 ResultsSan Francisco, CA, April 27, 2021 – Visa Inc.

Why were V and MA down today ??
V will be surpassing ️️️ next weekthis dip is for Wall Street to accumulate...right before the upcoming best earnings report!
Solid financials and a low RSI - strong buy!
Cramer just 'high-gived' Visa....This man is not a good omen
New high ...
everyone using credit cards now and avoiding money for fear of contracting the virus. They will continue this practice after the virus goes away.
Santa Claus rally begins on Monday
"it will go green tomorrow, no worries at all"
'Visa is a buy all the way to one thousand dollars per share my child'Jesus 2020
I think this is about the third or fourth time in the past couple years Visa has been run down before reporting and then it beats
congratulations to all you longs who have held it and watching new highs
"Visa is a great stock no question, sold at 145.0 waiting for the dip to 139 to buy back,"
"the bill has been passed, covid-19 is good news for v long-term,because covid-19 making money market bigger than before , so buy v now, making money immediately,"
250 by year end.
donr forget visa is working with amazon for palm scan payment.also china market potential once the virus fears go away
"Definitely hit hard by covid, even if they beat their earnings revenue where down 20% YOY. Still great company with great margins and will rise when this whole situation is over."
"NASDAQ (technology sector) is down 100 points today..11-29-17...Which is why MA, V, PYPL, Sq are down while AMEX is not. Just another buying opportunity for some great equities."
Lol. Whomever is moving this lower is c-r-a-z-y. The ascent higher will continue as long as people keep using their credit cards and history shows that is what people do.
is there a split coming for V??? Does anyone know??
V or Ma? Thoughts please
New all time high suckas!
8% by the end of the day
"Who foots the bill when borrowers default on credit cards? Is it the credit card company, insurers, or banks?"

Hopefully Dopey John's mom locked the root cellar and won't let him out anymore.
Possible to see Green V today.
small investment fifty shares!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A start to accumulate
For all you longs congrats 200 is here.
September options are exploding on call options!!!! $150.00 coming.
How long before it's back to $184? My guess is not very long.
Aaaaaaaaand back to $180 for the next six months
"With apple coming into Visa's market place, visa should start building phones"
I like what I see!!!
Job report blew past expectations. Visa will reach $300 this year. Reopening is here.
"pypl see15%-20% growth in June quarter, that means card payment strong growth in May, so strong buy V sure be make a lot of money, so investors who sold out V will regret it."
V will hurt MA call options today
Not even a million shares at 10:15 et...Looks like a lot of people are on the side lines......either that or it's too cold to trade anything
zoom!
October 10th gap up gets filled at 175.15...
This stock. lol It is up today but it climbs slowly. New highs then back down. Long and own quite a bit. Still fun to check it each day for great surprises like 117!
Only 10 more dollars
"Go V, Go!"
Has 200.00 written all over it!!
Thumbs up if you own a Visa card.
"I bought this at eh IPO, around 20.00 per share. and today's price is no less of a deal. This is a juggernaut and it is headed to 1000.00 per share easily. all while collecting a meager yet frequently raised dividend."
"Outside of a dog, this stock is a women's best friend."
Master Card cut revenue forecast for the year because of travel implications from coronavirus. Hit Visa.....buy more
I’m holding 455 Aug 17 calls. There’s $5.2M on these calls so my $22K looks puny. Go big or go home!!!
$200 was never in double. Nor was John never leaving his mom's root cellar.
"I've seen this several times now with V, folks. We might have another down day tomorrow or Thursday but then it's back to the steady climb."
"Where's John? He shorted the market, moved out of the root cellar and into a penthouse and is now too good for this forum?"
WHOOPIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Visa is killing it
Even on a down day in the market V continues its ascent. V (and Mastercard) are money printing machines!
$200 plus tomorrow! May the longs be with you.
I think we're getting a little overbought I love Visa I'm a holder got in at 120 but this has been quiet the run
"My 3 Favorite Moneymaker stocks have been VISA, NIO and APPLE. NIO continues to be on a Tear, expected to hit triple digits very soon,. don't miss out Get in Today"
"Most people will use their Visa card to go Holiday shopping. Visa doesn't get hit with their debt. They get paid with every transaction. People just spend and spend all on their visa card. The stock is unstoppable. They are also a main player in the mobil digital payment arena.Visa is dominant in the rest of the world outside of China, with 50% market share of global card payments minus China. Itcan handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second."
Visa does not only make money from brick and mortar retail...
Payroll tax cuts go into effect today! More spending on Visa cards!
Interesting down 2.50% after a 10% beat with more than double the normal volume...I think it will be up big Monday
"Have to say the drop from $210 to $200 was actually needed for V to go higher. Will it go past the 52 week high after earnings? Possibly.....the guidance will determine that...however, it is shaping up very nicely today."
VISA is not risky. BANKS ARE RISKY. Visa is a payment processor. They take the risk out of being risky. They warned . Fundamentals will be good for rest of year. LONG VISA. Be safe out there.
How u guys feeling about earnings
Pure profit taking!!!!!!! Long V
"It may seem as if Visa is a mature company -- that is, there's limited room to grow. After all, there are more Visa cards in existence than Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards combined.However, there's still a lot of potential for Visa, particularly internationally. Over the past year, its international transaction revenue has grown by 45% on especially strong results from the Visa Europe segment. Longer term, there's still tremendous opportunity in Asia and the Middle East, regions where credit cards still aren't widely accepted. In fact, China just recently opened access to U.S. credit card networks, so this is definitely a development to watch over the next few years."
New all time high!
https://www.investopedia.com/news/visas-breakout-seen-boosting-stock-9-short-term/
Interesting morning with V. Started to move at 10 am pacific which I am glad to see but don't understand why. Any ideas why it moved so good ????
"Once it reverses, it will surge strong."
$300 on the way
"Nice, i made about 300$ with V and lost about 5000$ with FB"
Looks like V is trading in a channel between $190.00 and $200.00/share.Just ride the wave baby!!!
Another all time high today. Only short sellers and those jealous folks that don't own any shares criticize.
"My 2 cents. Yes people still need to spend, and yes V is a solid company. That being said, the macro forces are just too much. When unemployment numbers come out Thursday (if Trump doesn't ask them to hold off on reporting) Visa is going gap down. Q2 & Q3 earnings drop is going to be brutal."
"V is better than MA. Everyone is maxing their Visa at this ""stay home""....."
Stimulus will directly benefit Visa. This stock will surpass the all time high after the stimulus announcement.
sleeping good with this stock.
Millions are trying e-commerce for the first time. My parents are seniors and avoided credit cards until now.Cash carries covid-19. everyone moving to credit. This is gonna explode.
V up 1.2% at 11:40 today. More to come.
Visa should buy Square for 50 bill. Huge growth. Put Dorsey on board.
Might be a good time to add some more before it hits $200
In the last earning they missed the expectations. How can they meet this time during these covid days?
Blowout jobs report this morning. Tailwind all month for Visa.
"I love V and am a long-term investor, but had to split 50% of my position into MA about six months ago since MA has been a heavy out-performer over V for a few years. Strange that V trades at a 39 p/e while MA trades at 47 p/e. Is MA growing that much faster than V? Doesn't make sense to me why MA is such a better stock. Over 5 years, MA has returned 271.75% while V has returned 189.94%."
sold all Vs at 173. be back at 140.Good luck to all.
my god what a waste of time this is. opportunity cost is a huge loss. every time it gets an upgrade the stock drops and this is in a huge bull market. I wonder what would happen if the overall market started to decline...
Its not a short term investment guys. :) I bought at the IPO and still own half of what I bought.
14 day RSI at 40...nearing oversold levels...
Visa held up ok today when tech sold off a lot. The stock will push above $200 next week.
$120 by year end!
$150 today. Congratulations to all the longs that were smart enough to buy the dips in Visa. You are being rewarded.
"I believe V is one of the backbone holdings for many people here, like myself.It's OK, if your other backbone happens to be AMZN.However, if it happens to be PYPL or SQ, it's a very different story."
$5Billion was spent online alone on Black Friday. probably going to be a good earnings report for Q4.
"Sold some V yesterday, should I buy back in now or wait a little?"
Visa just helped me retire early while Dopey John continues to live in his moms root cellar. Happy trails Dopey.
"Tomorrow I’ll be a better day, visa I’ll be up, visa is a great stock!"

I should have just put everything I had into visa and forgotten about it lol
"@S.P, you're down 4% from the day I sold off Visa. Now, I can come buy more V at a discount. Whose the rockie now?"
not saying it's a good thing... but a fact. the longer the shut down goes the more swipes on Visa cards to buy groceries...toiletries... diapers... front cash etc.
What a beauty
"An excellent stock with a dividend as well. Visa will benefit from the major increase in ""on-line"" sales for the 4th quarter 2017."
Always buying V. Especially at these levels !!!! Buy Buy Buy !!! You wont regret it !!
When will Visa move their headquarter out of California. I just read today HP is leaving California which is just another company added to the long list of corporations fleeing
when will it take off????????????????????
What happened AH?
It might drop back to 130 soon
Digital payments are here to stay. Cashless society.
"Imy financial advisor told me buy jpm, visa, and FedEx. long term investments"
I <3 Visa bought a couple years ago at 100 rode up and down now back up:)
Let's see if it can hold support at 124. Else 113 is the next support (I might buy some at 113)
I need V to hit $207 tomorrow. Will it make it?
"An absolute technical disaster. The whole group WAS weak today except SQ early. Often, hedges have side deals to bail each other out depending on direction of each. It was either that or stunning shortsighted traders who WERE long. The only consolation is those people will never be flush! Never. Glad I just held tight. Monthly Stochastic still straight down. I’m fine just holding this green core. You profit takers will give whatever you made and MORE back to the house. Always do:). Best to all but HATERS:)"
V is a stock one should definitely buy whenever cash is avail. do not wait for dips as it will continue to go up.
Visa with BitcoinYes!!!!Load Up!!!!
This price is a gift. Smart money are buying at these cheap levels.
Just purchased more. Longest winning streak in a long time.
Economic numbers terrible today....V is going back to $110....it is OVERVALUED and World economy is tanking!!!!!!
$200 by end of year
Earnings have to be massive this Thursday 1/28/21. Everyone is charging their Visa and M/C and nobody is paying them off but instead paying the high interest minimum. Visa doesn't need advertising debt anymore because the cards sell themselves especially in this pandemic. I think $225 on Friday 1/29/21 but anyone else have opinions?
This is going to easily blow past $300 in the next 18 months

V is going up like last time
What is a good prices to jump in? I originally had $115 but it's lower than that now.
https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/01/its-hard-to-find-a-downside-to-owning-visa-shares.aspx
$194 today. Wake up John. Mom says your Fruit Loops are on the table.
Incredibly reliable stock
All time high.
The whole market dropped of 4% just over an hour . What happened??
"What most of you idiot's dont understand is that ""analysists"" (who are no better than you and i) estimates are usually 10-20 percent higher than it's really worth so for this stock to consistently beat it year over year and then all of a sudden had an ""inline with estimates* ER the day traders and bums will sell and scream bloody Mary. Little do they know that MA expectations weren't even close to V and the fact that V even came close to these worshipped analyzits estimates is amazing. the bar was set high. This is a company that prints money. yes it had a huge run up last few months that wasnt completely justified in a time perspective, (but I enjoyed it), but the fact that a healthy pull back is in play (hopefully it drops a bit more so I can buy more) shows the power. if this went to 300 like your millenial SHOP or TSLA out to the moon with no lunch I would be worried but the price action on V is mature, promising and stable. invest in V for stable returns and dont invest if you're 30 who just inherited your dads coin"
"why are fintech stocks, V, MA , PYPL up today?"
broker failed to execute my order at $150 this am. not pleased.
yesterday is the bottom。 regret i didnot buy v
lower price better for the additional $8.5 billions buyback. CFO statements was intentional.
I believe in Visa. Good high quality company and good fundamentals. This February 'Flash Crash 2018' is nothing more than computer bots trading manipulations. Stay long without margin credit and Visa will deliver sooner or later. I bought for 125 and I don't worry for a long run.
"Any recommendations for trading platforms? Currently using plus500, not happy."
All time high soon!
Buy at $166. I think that’s the bottom. You heard it here first. I don’t think it’ll break that level! Great point to add!
"I do not know the implications of the rise of Fintechs on V or MA or AXP. 10 years from now, will they still be that dominant? Someone might have the answers."
"Master Card Beat estimates, So will Visa, who is actually in a better fundamental position than MasterCard, better buy it now at 200 before it goes up!!"
We are approaching holiday season where online shopping=credit card use will surge.
"Giving yesterday’s gains all back, great."
Shorty will cry!
what is going on with visa?
Will hit under $190 midWeek if not earlier like I mentioned a week ago!!
Great buying opportunity. Visa will be at 165+ year end.
You think it can go to $180-175?
Why Visa dropping?
"As sad as this will seem, a good chunk of the world population is going to be out of work for quite some time with no income. How will everyone buy what they need? Credit cards."
"""expensive valuation"" blah blah blah. its the new normal and money never goes out of style. long live Visa"
buy visa and become rich . simple
Stock will be over $200 in 2020!!! MAGA!!!
this is the easiest stock to ever own. Hold for the foreseeable future and add on any pullbacks.
Hey guys looking for a good entry point...any suggestions?
Visa is my largest holdings. I got in the day it went public in 2008. I also have LEAP Options that go out to 2019 already 20% in the money. Happy trading.
Is there actually any bad news for visa?
The march to 250 begins...
"Visa is left behind by pypl, sq catching up"
$133.30 near term bottom.
"Six to seven months from now, those that sell (or who have sold) will regret it."
$230 today
"V is the proxy for the US. Fix crushing debt with even more debt. It, not AAPL or AMZN, should be the $Trillion stock."
"CSCO used to not pay a dividend. But now it does and my yield on cost is over 25%. Yes, I bought CSCO a long time ago before it paid a dividend and it went through several splits. I suspect Visa will follow a similar path but people just need to give it time. When the growth slows down the dividend will increase to attract investors. The time to buy a stock is before it focuses on dividends."
Owning Visa is like having a second job where Visa is working for you. Easy money.
Why in the world V will drop?!
Sold all of mine when it dropped 10%. from its high. Now looking at buying back and adding a lot shares to grow back tot he 200 mark.
Slow and steady wins races. :)
#stablecoin
Glad I added to my position yesterday ! $$$$
"What do you buy with your visa card nowadays? Airline tickets, gasoline, hotel reservation, clothes, go to restaurant? Or toilet paper?"
Nice rally! today was the low!
corporate scandal again.. I'm out. will take the 6% loss.
What is everyone doing if we hit 200 this month?
Long should not be worried. V is coming back again. This drop is smaller compare to overall market drop.
"Thinking about buying tomorrow's calls at $210 strike price. They are at 60 cents right now. What's yall's thoughts? I think it trades rest of day around current levels, $208.80. Can it open up just 1% tomorrow to make me a double up?"
"I have owned since the IPO only stock I have seen that goes down after beating the street but goes up before earnings, and now this quarter will be the first time I have seen it since inception go down before earnings, questionably unusual activity!"
I have no idea why people were selling this before after terrific earnings? ??
Stock will blow through pre-covid highs pretty soon. 20%-25% upside over next few months.
It seems to me that Visa could offer both their current processing system plus a blockchain system for example thru Ripple or some other token. Therefore Visa perfectly positioned for this possible disruption...
Wow. Watch it wipe out all on yesterday's gain.
hey anyone know if Visa will be affected by tax repatriation? (just wondering because AMEX got hammered by it)
Have to love dividend increase share buy backs and growth.
"You gotta love Visa today as it set a new, all-time high. Onward & upward!"
"Buy V today, stop doing your laundry at your parents house in 2020."
"@SGW. As a proud Canadian Liberal residing in these great United States, I would say that Trump has accomplished more than the last 4 Presidents combined. You may not like what he says or his character, but Trump is all about results., Unlike his predecessors. I can't imagine what he could have done if he didn't have so much Democratic resistance.Trudeau sucks by the way. Using Obama to influence a Canadian election to further him along. All Politicians are bunk."
back to green
No surprise here. We all knew it was going to beat because no company raises the dividend 18% without earnings to back it up!!! Lifetime hold!!!!!!
What are your 3rd Quarter Financial prediction and WHY ????
"Visa stock has underperformed S&P for several months. Also slightly underperforming against Mastercard, which I also own. I need some cash. Sorry, Visa, you are on the chopping list. I have a limit sell order for its previous high price of 226.15."
watch $108.35.... and be ready if u r a buyer at $106 that is the real first tech support I see..... honestly from $110-114 it was in overbought territory. A small entry or add at $106 to 108 seems ok.
"Thanks, DOJ, for the temporary dip. Was a nice time to buy."
V reached an all time high at 203.53
glad I only left 10 calls open

The all too familiar pattern repeats............retail bids up the stock at the open........funds liquidate positions in to that strength.
6 Billion penalty & still going up..going to come down really hard...shall I buy more?
Why is it RED?! Which joker shorting it?
Mastercard Inc. shares were subject to a rare downgrade late Monday as Oppenheimer's Dominick Gabriele cut his rating on the card network to perform from outperform. Gabriele argued that Visa Inc. could recapture lost market share in Europe at Mastercard's expense.Load up.
Contactless payments are the new normal.
Very undervalued
Visa! the goose that lays golden eggs! $$$
"Well not too thrilled about the recent drop in Visa especially the fact that they just announced they're not merging with Plaid, after that announcement they dropped another $2 after hour trading after going down $4.00 during the day, very disappointing now we better hope that earnings report comes out better than analysts expect otherwise we'll be headed back below 200 again, very frustrating!!!"
95 ready or not...here we come...
Buy at $179
SHEP. HERE................................. Did anyone see that some stimulus money is being sent on a Visa debit card?
"while Visa had almost always moved synch. with MA but post result movement is not so, do we expect more gain in Visa in coming weeks?"
"Visa May Add Cryptocurrencies to Its Payments Network, Says CEOVisa CEO Al Kelly said the payments giant is in a position to make cryptocurrencies more “safe, useful and applicable” and may add them to the company’s payments network.Speaking on the company’s fiscal first-quarter 2021 earnings call, Kelly described cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as “digital gold” which are “not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point.” “Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally,” Kelly said."
Visa train is going to ram market bears hard sooner or later.
"V and MA are gifts at these levels. V below 200 is a steal. V shorts are going to be bleeding from every orifice once the rally starts. V is going to rally, take out 250, then take out 300. This is not a stock I would want to be short on."
"tough to see how this stock isn't much higher headed into Q1 prints. even chart says buy here at channel bottom of 206. how can V,MA, SQ, Pypl, GPN ext...not be recipients of all this liquidity. June calls golden imo"
"Here is how bad all those analyst just to hype stuff.Visa, Master Card, Pay Pal used everywhere during pandemic. People dont want to touch money.So In otherword it has best possible earning we may see in history by theory. Sure GDP was down 20% during that period so let's say best possible + 20% + future World GDP growth (Which is 2% average) + 5% for development market.As people start using cash, credit card payment share will decline. Also various Apps doing direct transfer reduce their usage as well.So my opinion best they can have 5-7% growth from last Quarter earning. Stock is trading 55 PE.How you can justify 55 PE for 5-7% growth for mature large company like Visa."
"01.28.2019 - V @ 135.625 and down 2.17%, when SP500 is down less than 1/2 that. I smell a dead fish - Q earnings are due out on 01.30 i.e. in 48-odd hours. Does some institution know something about those un-disclosed earnings today, which the rest of mankind does not ? Today's down move, on today's up volume speaks ... well, yes = volumes !"
Bought 500 shares at $210.30. Let’s hope this was a good investment. Going long term with this baby! Make me happy and proud visa
Steve Weiss says buy on CNBC!!
We should reach $200 very soon. Momentum is gaining in this stock.
I am going all in.
V has held strong around $149. Buy at $125
Only a newcomers getting mad and surprise the Visa performance after very good earning. Im a long Visa stock holder well aware and posted some comments prior the earning date but you guys getting mad. Sorry that is how the Visa is. Will be $200.00 and more but slowly and steady Visa will reach to that price...
buy and hold all the way!
The average price target for Visa has increased to $195
Calls set a couple months out have never failed on me here.
"did anyone watched Bloomberg last night?an analyst valued Bitcoin to 400,000because of the high demand and limited availability."
Rumors about the decline of V have been greatly exaggerated. New ALL-TIME high today.Congrats to all longs.
"I bought Visa at the price of $55.00 not getting off this pony for a long time, the scenery is beautiful."
Bought more recently. It is a very strong buy in my opinion.
Watchout money ahead.
Does anyone have access to the text of Citi's note raising the PT to $206? If so could you post it? Thx.
Get ready for a great week folks!!!
I think the weakness in V and MA yesterday was in sympathy to EEFT earnings.
Futures are all green! $160 tomorrow!
"Congrates to all you longs, all time high. Enjoy, long and holding"
Over-corrected.
I lost my V-card once and Visa was so supportive and helpful. They froze it and replaced my V-card like nothing ever happened. Thanks Visa!
Think V will go up after earnings or will it be built in?
"Visa Inc. (V), President Mcinerney Ryan, Filled Form 4, on 04/01/2021, Disposed 11,194 shares, at Price $213.87 worth $2,394,061 Follow On Instagram, https://www.instagram.com/money_insider_stocknews/Facebook, https://www.facebook.com/Earnegy/For Stocks Inside News and Details."
"Reopening, online sales, cashless society, contactless payments, share buybacks, cross border travel"
In near future will be disastrous for credit cards many hi tech companies using digital Processing almost 4 nothing hardly any fees I have it already in my store I don’t know how long visa and MasterCard will hold ￼
Closing +200
Earning will be sky high.
"V will move lower in the near term. Why?Fed will cut, value stocks are in vogue during this rotation, market at near term highs, China news is favorable but recession fears linger.All this adds up to a pause in the 160s-mid-170s over the next few weeks into mid-October."
Do Fridays options have anything to do with Visa being flat?
Overvalued FAANG money coming into Visa and Mastercard. The smart money knows this will fly as covid cases drop.
"3 bull flag, and a major Cup and handle! Bullish!!"
JP Morgan just turned red !Seconds ago another 52 week low ?
Why the huge dump right before the close?
Here Comes the Big Bounce!!! GO V GO!!!
One of the few stocks you can buy and hold forever.
Viva Las Visa
"Overall I think VFF earnings looked good. I am not sure how the street will percieve it but interested to see how today goes, despite of the report puclished by Citron Report and has caused a downward trend since april but the company seems to recover and i think it's on the way up and i see a potential buy position coming out . Here is another one I am watching too. https://alldaytrading.market/MJDelivery"
Going green today! $$$$$
"For this stock, one step back is 3 steps forward in the future."
why the world stock market suddenly down so much? trump?china?
Great week gentlemen and ladies! Have a great weekend and use your Visa card! :))
All time high next week.
where's cramer?
Visa is a no brainer. Buy and hold for a few years.
"Markets down 150 and visa is up $3, what's up?"
Institutions came in at 10. Starting to see market rebound. Look at move in Apple. Very positive.
Bought V at 204 and 208 last week. How long will the coronavirus affect the stocks and what are people recommending to do?
"What’s up with Visa? Crazy earnings, stock down?"
Visa is a safe haven stock for investors right now... $300 price target
"This will easily surpass predictions for 2020. Visa is used all over the globe, and with this fintech company they are cementing their stake in the future of banking."
good going and good bye..enjoy the MA board
They just keep charging!
got 150 stocks at 209 when it dropped due to DOJ investigation. will sell right before the earnings
Share buybacks will push Visa over $200 a share soon.
"heart pain, i bought in at $200 and not it is only beginning to fall...."
Travel has returned
V is love
Added shares @ $142.75 Friday and $140.50 today. 
This stock is on SALE
"low volume, just manipulation"
Why the rise today?
Bought 500 more shares at 208.22. I figure this is a safer place to put my money. I really think Visa is something that could be held for years and I would be happy with the results. I have yet had the discipline to hold anything for one year. Sure would help on paying my taxes though.
They currently have a great business model but the valuation is out of this world. Negative tangible equity and $300B+ market cap for a payment network that could be regulated or made obsolete by new technology? No way....
Check the history weaklings. Visa doesn't disappoint. No reason to sell prior to earnings.
What’s everyone’s opinions on earnings tomorrow after the bell? I predict 5% to the upside! Financial is going to roar now after being down for 6 months! Let’s roll baby!!
"Visa will blow all the expectations tonight!Akk e-Commerce/Internet stocks, FB, MSFT, Google, Amazon have done well - Visa would be no exception, as its an enabler for eCommerce."
Just bought a $1000 Luger pistol with my VISA. Felt really good.
"Simply EOY profit taking. Be there for the turn when the #'s for holiday season are announced. V and MA should have great ER, wouldn't sell either. Best of luck in 2020."
I have holding since the 80s......I have no idea whenever to sell...great company
I've loved Visa but they've been under performing the other fintech companies recently. Im starting to wonder if it'd be wise to trim from overweight and hop into PayPal or Mastercard with the freed funds.
cheers from spain go VISA
Stimulus $ will cause credit card spending to skyrocket
No upside resistance
Great place to add more shares. Any 5 dollar dropoff in Visa is a gift.
"The first time the Dow hit 24,200, Visa was $136 a share....yesterday the Dow was 24,200 and Visa was $180the stock is too far ahead of itself."
Who would buy visa in this market. It’s like watching paint dry.
The Visa monopoly shall be broken by the Feds. Then this is $100 stock
Look at the lowest price target of $216. Most stocks trade far above their lowest price target. This price is a gift.
Go Visa. Closing in on a new high.
"Visa doesn't care if no-one pays their bill. The banks get stuck. Every time someone sneezes, money goes into the visa coiffures. Visa mobile payments, credit, debit..cha ching."
"The bottom is in for the S&P500 and Visa is moving up and up. Get in today, in a few days it will be over $140/share. I am an original investor in Visa since IPO March 9, 2008. The Federal Reserve knows they must be very, very accomodative at the meeting today and tomorrow, which will give marke fuel to rise much higher."
"incredible, at 3pm I thought it will certainly close above $201...but no! Who keeps controlling this stock not to break out??"
My feelings on Visa
Buy on all dips. Visa is a clear winner. Doesn’t get much better.
big beat. Stock down. Hmm...
Red means GREEN LETS GO BULLS
sky rockets in flight...afternoon delight
V making a ton of $. How about a dividend increase?
Five banks just maintained buy/outperform ratings. PT: 268-280

Any split coming ?
"In store shopping, online shopping, cashless society, international expansion, share buybacks... $200+ on the way!"
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4297187-visa-significant-growth-potential-stagesafety warning of not undervalued in article.
V is great. Now I am waiting for MasterCard. Finger crossed
Just wondering...I'm in the MIdwest and an eatery here yesterday had a big sign that they weren't taking cash payments. Is this going on in other parts of the country? Is it even legal to refuse legal tender as payment?
Based off of American Express and Mastercard we should see similar results.
"Crystal Ball time folks - When will V hit the magic $200 mark?I'll say March 1, 2020."
"Mark, do you ever have a positive thought/word for any stock? I see you on many boards spreading doom and gloom and all the while the market is hitting new highs. You might do better if you looked for things to invest in that do well. GO VISA. If Amazon is building all those new warehouses and hiring 50k people, they are planning on people ordering online stuff and you cant order on line without a credit card and Amazon's card is a Visa card, but of course you could use any other one too."
1200 points up tomorrow...this roller coaster ride is great if you time it right!
This is a hold for 10+ years. buy on the dips.
"Seriously, everything I buy goes down. Whatever I sell goes up. Just bought this a few days ago :-("
Here comes 150
Dopey John is back. What financial literacy course did you take?
Remember $245 is the high price target... long way to go up
"I was looking a fundamental financial information for overvalued companies. V hit the radar on the first two passes. I find it hard to short / put an equity that has significant (70% or more) margins and keeps printing money. Plus it is a brand name. Yes, it may be overvalued, but I'm not brave enough to take a contrarian bet on this until there is a viable competitor (MA and AMEX are playmates not competitors). PYPL is an example of potential disruptive competition, but they will end up as a playmate as well. The ""competitor"" is at least 10 years away that I can tell. Nice work if you can get it. Good luck to longs, shorts and everyone in between."
"too optimistic, i wanna see 220 today. highly unlikely i suppose."
"Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY)NasdaqGS - NasdaqGS Real Time Price. Currency in USD45.92-5.11 (-10.01%)<——-As of 9:57AM EST. Market open."
"In a few days, it will be, like the dip never happened, . Beautiful charts no matter if 1-Year, 5-Year or 10-Year. **Hey John, ask yourself, when did you last pay with cash? Hmm..."
One week from now: 210+ p/s
I would buy Qiwi which has the Visa brand Wallet. It is selling below its cash on the balance sheet and growing tremendously in CIS area. It will reinstate the dividend soon as it has earned too much cash. The institution investors had an early start on the company and will reap the benefits.
Square and Paypal have more growth.
"Visa beat estimates late Tuesday, as payment volumes topped pre-pandemic levels. *** This quality earnings beat will put V on a serious upward move!- What a V bonanza!!!"
"Look at stocks like Zoom, Shopify, and LuLu... but you think Visa is overvalued? Visa is very undervalued."
I own Visa and PayPal for a couple of years and both have been good to me. No plan on selling either one.
money making machine
We need Biden!
$170 before earnings
20 % off sale going on
"Ok, now you talking. Green, green like Hulk!"
$170 next week
Come on
Are there any long term shareholders who were here when the stock split in March 2015?
this will closes green. like it or not
"forward p/e of 24 and growth of 15% peg of 1.7, thus bit overvalued. so will wait till it is correct valuation."
See everyone at $200 later this month
Visa has 3X the share online.....street finally realizing how big Q4 will be......
Look how quickly it recoversRemember 185 around election time?Soon back to 220We will be back thereHope no one panic sold
Long live Visa. :)
"After the profit takers sell, V will rock today!!!"
"Way to go, abolish. your stupid boring frantic posts have destroyed this board and driven everyone away. Now you can be happy and spend your days talking to yourself. You and the greedy girls have done a great job ruining this page."
"It is normal when V hit new high, then pull back because MMM not its earnings itself. V will go even higher in the next two weeks because the economy in Q1 is even better."
I hope this dips so I can get in
load up the truck weeeeeeeeeee
V reached an all time high at 206.80
We love to see this V shape of V chart!
$250 price target
Buy low. Sell high. Don’t miss out on the dip.
This company makes money when transactions take place with cards using there logo
shorted this tr_ash 185.10 thanks again for the cheap entry and 185 PUTS mor_ons!
Why did V just tank?
"Time to add more to position... under 140. Going to 155 by EOY. Compare the 1Y, 2Y, 5Y charts of V and watch the slow, but progressively strong escalator ride, UP."
V is breaking out!!!
new high
Can’t think of a better inflation hedge than Visa with their transaction based revenue model.....believe inflation will be the next big investing narrative/shock.
Macquarie initiated coverage of Visa with an outperform rating and $250 price target.
Keep going down... I’d love a new buy opportunity at a lower level :)
"Local plug only takes visa payments now, this stock is going up"
added again today @134
Bought today...will buy again tomorrow if it goes lower.
Cash is history. Get in now before covid vaccine sends this to $300.
Oh my heart! I'm coming ethel!
Yahoo finance is glitching
pe is a little high. dividend near 0 but fintech is on a roll unlike financials and long term trénd good. easy shortcut to figure current free cash flow....... go to cash flow statement. take current operating income. and subtract. cúrrent cap ex 98%accurate!
"Loading up before the close, yes it’s a gamble I’m willing to take"
"Solid fundamentals, Solid Future!"
the supermarket s are booming right now like target wallmart . everyone is using a credit card...people are home buying things and using visa...its a no brainer
MSFT today V next week. My two biggest and only holdings!
Was this upgraded to.....? 250.00?
"This is the present. And the future is easily predictable, if you are a realist. Realists, buy buy buy."
No brainer! This chart is the answer!
V will reach $ 185 by today's close!!!
Heard Coca cola has an intetest!Sound familiar lol.In from 116 with 60 shares.
$220 this week
"I love to read all the paranoid fear-based opinions that we should all SELL SELL SELL Visa because they are going to tank. Where are all the geniuses who played chicken little when this stock was in the 70s urging all of us smart ones to sell? LOLOL....I love to sit here and rake it all in. I bought just after the IPO and sit on a gold mine. That's what smart investors do, Mark and all you other scaredy cat hand-wringers!!"
visa will surprise at earnings...people been home shopping like crazy with their cards
More price target upgrades next week. $300 price target
Gravitational pull to $200
We might get lucky Biden might ride Trumps economy four years
Congrats to all V longs on yet ANOTHER prosperous week! With the ability to soon enter the Chinese market with another the 1.4 billion people....just think of the possibilities.
181.89 at todays close.
Good buy at 181?
Visa will go down as less people will go out and travel. No purchase == loss in profit
I'm not selling visa. they will most likely be around longer than most people's life expectancy.
MM working hard to keep this down
Visa with the comeback on the day wow!
Why this is down?
"DOW and S&P are in record territory!- We might yet se V end the final trading session in the green, by the closing bell!!  "
The first couple of ER's Visa went down before earnings and then popped big after a beat...I dont see any reason for it to drop (or MA either). I would guess earnings were going to be stellar.
Earning should BEAT all around !GO VISA!!!!
Come join us on Facebook. Daytrade investing is stock market Robinhood
I just ordered an Apple credit card - Visa and the rest will be out if business in 5 years or less losing to the phones.
"Visa will be the first to recover once economies start to open, fighting pretty well the bears and its holding the 175-180 levels, i see 200$ in short-mid term"
V is the king of offline and online payments.V would rule...
I'd buy every 2% weekly or daily dip.
We’re just scratching the surface with Visa... several upgrades and price target increases coming before earnings. Undervalued
current price: $116.67

Buy V and MA! This electric duo will lead the fintech sector out of the doldrums!
can make a lot of money buying selling the highs and lows.
V is breaking out folks. need to buy on any weakness
"If you wait a week or so, you can add V for about $150/ share. 2020 Earnings estimate is down to about $5/share now and falling. Its officially overvalued."
I love Visa it is my largest holding but am considering buying some Mastercard for diversity. Thoughts?
There will be panic buying to new highs once it settles and begin the reversal.
"I find it interesting when the TV traders, fanboys, pundits, et al continually amplify the chatter about how great a stock like AAPL is... yet do a 5 year comparison chart between AAPL, V and DPZ and you’ll know why I dumped ALL my Apples in 2013 and shifted my (pardon the pun) ‘core’ holdings away from aapl to V and DPZ. I’m cool that the cramers, najarians and other assorted bozos of the tv trading world stay mute about V."
This is always schizo in AH on earnings days. Tomorrow will be the test how people feel about the call. Owning this stock is literally a no brainer.
Visa strategic partners Qiwi is crating out a fast growing e payment omni channel strategy. 70 milions people are using it and growing faster than Visahttp://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=qiwi+payment&&view=detail&mid=0A14D31F06DC488A2D1D0A14D31F06DC488A2D1D&FORM=VRDGAR .

Big recommendations to Buy PAYSIt starts rocketing as WDI filed for insolvency!Buy it now before it’s too late

"Wish i had more money in the sideline, so i could get more Visa shares. Personal price target of 220$."
"“Services stocks have less foreign input costs that might be subject to tariffs and are also less exposed to potential trade retaliation given they have less non-U.S. sales exposure than goods firms,” the analysts wrote.Within services, Goldman Sachs highlights two areas: software services and media and entertainment. According to Goldman Sachs, the biggest stocks in the services category include: Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Facebook (FB), JPMorgan (JPM), Visa (V) and Walmart (WMT)."
People are afraid to use cash during this pandemic
"Big ""V"" is just tearing the lid off, even the short term resistance level. Great week indeed!"
got this 2008before the split and bought several times.....sold quite a bit Feb 2020will keep buying any weekness.......... had not used cash but VISA Card!!!GO VISA!!!!
New all time high this morning!
I love this stock. Let's me sleep at night. Consistent performer with continued growth prospects and no crazy PE ratio.
why down .?
Visa buying Plaid.
This is going to $180.
I love visa bought at IPO and enjoying the ride. I will never sell only buy more a safe place to put extra cash
"Paperless super bowl, we pay everything on our Visa card I imagine most consumers are going in the same direction. This is great news been in V since IPO love this stock!"

"Out at 170. VISA is a great company I just do not trust the market. Will be back again. Best of luck to everyone with all your investments, stay safe."
"Buy 1 share of this. When customs ask, - Do you have a Visa ? you can reply ""yes"". -_,-"
Buying more V! 
Visa creates revenue on ‘every click’ with minimal risk. Banks not Visa exposed to creditworthiness. Visa is worldwide. Credit card processors are prospering. May be a blip now and then..but a big run up coming. Try buy something online with a shoebox full of cash..
"Why would visa trade lower while MasterCard trades in green ? With the recently announced earnings, it appeared to me that visa did better MA. Can any one shed some light please"
I added 100 more shares. I saw this as a buy opportunity.
Remember I said to buy this morning! $$$$$
"RBC capital today. upgraded Visa, raising price target from $236 to $244!"
V should put the hammer down and charge all these money apps like sq venmo higher fees.
Bought that dip hard
Looking for a REAL recession this time and $100 V.
Sorry to see so many people sell in a panic situation . But it helps some one to buy in at a good price .
BUY BUY BUY
AH looks great. What is going on?
Is fear of Coronavirus going to drop the DOW significantly on Monday? What do you guys think?
Why the sell off in V?
"under 140 , V is a screaming buy. sell your house , all in visa. Then you are rich"
This seems like a nice buying opportunity
what a gift. thank you visa thank you wallstreet. easy $$
"Don't bet against V, Ma. Remember when retailers were suing these two stocks for over 6 billion and the stocks dropped. Well, they came back in full force. there are always bumps, but V & Ma are too impressive not to buy for long term"
155 by end week!
I feel blessed owning this stock
V SHOULD BE WAY HIGHER!
Will hit $195 by next weekend. You heard it here first!! Let the work open up and begin.
Anyone think it will get back to $128?
Is earning tomorrow before or after the bell ?
"all of you that love V,just think of how little it has climbed compared to the market! staying in for the long hall,but to me V is underachieving at the present time!"
Volume will be down significantly yoy which analyst have forecast in their estimates. While credit card over cash will stay with us after covid it cannot overcome lower economic activity(purchases) now. Question is whether they beat estimates and if yes does the stock move up in short term.
$AXP missed in earnings. Likely that is the reason for V’s dip below the overall market.
we took out a terrorist. so what
"? to group. If Walmart blows earnings away tomorrow and speak of a increase in credit transactions ( cashless transactions) does anyone thing it will cause Visa to rise? I think so, but am I naïve in thinking so?"
I’d argue we are carving out a new bottom.
Visa on sale today! $$$ Load up folks! $$$$
what do all these new fintechs use? $MA $V networks
130 coming real soon!
The spring spending binge= The spring booming Visa️️️
A boost in the dividend will boost the stock price

Visa gonna shoot up after Earnings!
Where oh where is BOZO John? I'm guessing he fake shorted 5000 shares at $210. LMAO!
Green before close
Need it back down to below $170 to buy more
"Hey Russian Short Seller, if you don't like Big V then go away. We who know better are making money hand over fist. "
$300 stock this year
Green in a red marketBuilding a base for the next leg upATHs in a month imo
When Visa start paying a 3% yield dividend I suspect this may rise to around $300-400/share.
"see money increasing, V front view very good, so V should history high, it's earning short fall doesn't matter, money increasing is a lot more better than any thing,so V will be going up to$350,"
Cutting up our credit cards.. enough is enough.
Buying opportunity my friends! $$$$$$
Good talk just now on CNBC about visa...target raised to $250!
"have held this great stock since it's IPO. It'll beat or meat expectations much like MA did. However, it might decline tomorrow because of this VIRUS, and because we are going into the weekend. That said, I expect it to bounce back next, and once this VIRUS is under control, we'll be back to the races. LONG VISA."
Im guessing we close up a half a buck or so.....but I've been wrong before
Going to $190 and then $175. Slow and steady decline here it comes.
Love this steady gap-up chart!
Visa’s earnings rocks— plus a $8 billion stock buy back is sweet!
All I know is a Buy block of 2.77 million shares were just purchased
Just like Trump said the sell off was a glitch - year end hedge fund closings caused liquidation of stocks - 4 more years! Is there still space on Mount Rushmore

Do people stop using their visa cards? I don’t.
Strong buy at these levels!
Under $176. Looking more like a buy.

Remember... Very low bar on comps from last year. Everywhere was closed. Still cheap at these levels.
$205 is the lowest analyst price target
Up or down toMorrow? What do we think?
How much do you think Visa will be worh in 5 years? Or 10 years?
Getting closer but still waiting for January 2019 price $140. ￼
"This should be mid 140s by now. The games, why mom and pop stay out of market"
Does anyone on the board have any doubt the Visa will be over $150 by years end.
Fly visa fly
BUY WISH stock today for Hugh gains in the near future.
Gonna pick up A LOT during tomorrows dip !!!!!!!!!
Is VISA a buy here???
New highs tomorrow.
"One day, quarter, year, any stock can exist in a slump or a more negative decline but I am very confident that in holding V for multiple years it will result in a very significant profit for all longs."
Visa will beat but like every other earnings will be down 3-4 bucks. Believe I wish this was at 200 but the market is so crooked they will beat this up and recover next week. I so hope I’m wrong but seen it to many times
The entire dows gain almost due to united health and visaAll other or most other dow components are being sold into the “rally”Will be intersting to see if the dow goes red today..Retail sales report this week will take down visa imo...Target kohls so many others warned or missed..Lets see what happens this afternoon..Look  and see other dow stocks all red and think why...Can visa operate in a vacuum at this price level ?
"This thing has just wanted to break out over the past 6 months ... someone keeps pushing it down ... when they finally decide to let it go it’s going to move fast, with a lot of catch up to do ... coiled spring ready to move"
"Because of the holiday season Visa earnings will be superb ,, Everybody used their Visa to buy Gifts this Christmas and that will reflect in the earnings report, this Recent Dip just means you get it on sale for about another 3 days before it rockets back up near its 220 high. Long & Strong"
red after hours. That's nice.
And that’s 160!
buy buy buy baby 
Any signs or thoughts of a split coming in the near future?
Just bought some and this is another rare undervalued stock in the market. GL everyone
did you guys know that Nov 2014 Visa had reached 255/share. I hope to see it again!
Visa is up 4.91% to 225.98
Is it too late to buy in? Fearful because it’s at its peak right now...but just found out about V and want to get it. Wait for a dip?
"happy as an investor that this is one of the few stocks that isn't pumped up. It is -justly- trading slightly below precorona levels. When a correction comes -and it will-, this stock won't be affected too bad, when economy reopens it will indeed go up to 260 or so."
I own a pretty sizeable amount in V but was thinking on dropping a small amount on Mastercard as well. Is that a bad idea?
Just a monster beat
why always sell off around closing?
V needs to increase their dividend up to 2% at least... that's what people want now a days... dividends
Too bad our resident short sold his puts at 210
love it.. slowly but surely..
Strong support at these levels.
I don't think people realize the magnitude of what is happening and how overpriced some stocks are just as retail sales are collapsing. In Visas case they bought visa europe making year over year comparisons look great like 20% year over year growth until the coming quarter where that purchase will no longer juice year over year gains making the stock with a 30 pretty expensive in light of rising rates and tariffs on imported goods..Look at this if you dare...
"“US consumer spending increased steadily in August ““Personal income rose 0.3 percent, while wages jumped 0.5 percent.”The increase was sustainable: “A measure of underlying inflation remained at the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for a fourth straight month.”US consumer spending increased steadily in Augusthttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/28/us-personal-income-and-spending-aug-2018.html"
"Per SW...Starting June 3, MCO will no longer be accepting cash at the ticket counter. All transactions must be completed using a debit or credit card."
"Buy Buy, Buy, @120. Keep playing with that dead cat, but he's not getting back up and walking for 9 more months. At 120, I love the stock."
Call me delusional... but I only see buying opportunities!
visa tanking....what a joke
Contactless payments will grow top line revenue
Seems like a good opportunity at this price but the balance sheet is somewhat worrisome. Isn't anyone worried about the high level of debt in the current context? It's higher than the cash balance and their revenue is taking an enormous impact from the coronavirus - how are they going to service that debt?
Be very very wary of this rally...
Could we see 150-175 by the end on the year or another recession under Trump.
"Started out up today, then down, then up again, and closed in the red -- yikes!! I am long in V, however this frequent occurrence is getting really old. What's an individual investor to do?"
Closing above $205 today
Buy all you can. These are dirt cheap levels for MA and V. These stocks will soar once Coronavirus is behind us. I am loading the boat with both stocks.
140 by end of the week?
im holding through earnings
morning bag_holders!
This is good news for me It gives me a chance to buy more shares at a lower price
Market down because of pending doom from hurricane?
yahoo only publishes what they want
Based on 11 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Visa in the last 3 months. The average price target is $212.45 with a high forecast of $239.00 and a low forecast of $194.00. The average price target represents a 10.67% increase from the last price of $191.96.
"I understand how this virus would slow down things on the manufacturing side, but people still buy goods and services with credit cards, virus or not!!! In my opinion, Visa is way oversold. It's interesting how analysts at the beginning of the year were calling for a 10% correction. Mmm. LONG VISA"

They rather play the Casino in GME and AMCthan invest in Visa..........got this 12 yrs ago....any pull back I buy!
1.38 vs 1.27 beat
"This is how big money shakes out loose hands and then buys back in at a cheaper price. They sold off profits and triggered a sell off and while you’re late to the game selling off your shares because you have a job and a life, they are buying all of those shares back and will drive the stock higher next week."
i gotta feeling there will be a dump at the close to close at the lows. Would not surprise me if the Dow closes down 800.
money honey
"I guess this will be the biggest tailwind for Visa, MA, and Amex going forward, “U.S. economy is ‘on the brink’ of a complete recovery, says Richmond Fed’s Barkin”"

People are using plastic to pay for bills and delivery of food!!! I expect an excellent earnings report for the 1st quarter propped up by more spending on plastic in the month of March 2020!!!Go Visa Go!!!
Easy money.
I'm glad that I loaded the truck up with Visa! $$$
I hate that when I r down 4K ...I did not heard anything wrong fromMgmt
Shall we see 150 by end of this week?
With a recession obviously inevitable the next couple of months could produce amazing buying opportunities in this stock. Friday Goldman Sachs said they expect an economic contraction of 24% in the second quarter!
What was that all about yesterday..?
"‪The fed will raise interest rates tomorrow, or they might delay it. Either way the stock markets will crash. Sell today.‬"
"Cross-border e-commerce hasn’t been significantly impacted, except for travel spending and in some Asian markets, Visa said."
some heavy trades AH.Can't tell if they're buy or sell
There’s our $200 back
its will be red tomorrow.last chance to save profit.Sell asap please.
Just in. Black Friday shoppers spend record $7.4 billion online.You hold Visa stock if your brain is larger than a pea.
most using plastic and with the coin shortage Visa should be up after earnings
Just like i said! Dip after earnings but will slowly keep going up. Visa is so predictable.
"I'm amazed there aren't more posts about VISA. Hitting all time high in the pre market this morning. In it since the IPO, now my third biggest holding. Just cause it's not a FANG stock. Going higher."
150 v soon!
Stock should be strong tomorrow right after a good earning call.
"V & MA should both bounce modestly -- about 10 - 15 percent off their recent bottoms, by end of year.- 2019 will be an extra ordinary growth year for dynamic duo.- Go long and stay strong!"
Viva la Visa!
The next price target we should all focus on is $300
DOJ just opened a probe into Visa's debit card practices as per the WSJ today.

V is one stock up or down I sleep just fine. This Christmas shoppers will be melting their plastic from so much use.
I just add more
I don’t know if I sale my calls today or wait after earnings!
All time high this week. Why would you even think about selling Visa shares? Strong buy at these levels. Several low quality stocks are surging. Visa will surge this week.
Time for a split?
"It will tickle 204 before it bounces. But once it does, it will be swift."
I know it is a good opportunity but it is also a pain .
buy at 132 more resistance this time so may be the last drop
Close over 200 today is imminent.
So this was talked about 11days ago.I take it this proposal can be rejected?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-propose-merchants-tourist-105314486.html
Hearing rumors that Visa will be bought out by Game Stop next week.
It pays to stay invested
"Short term pain I think continues. Way overvalued on a Price/sales standpoint. I'm a long term holder, will continue to hold and add if it tanks again. Hopefully we're in a start of market correction. Need to get rid of the speculation."
"lol 5 10 20 years from now, people will still use plastic for online and offline"
i swipe my visa card often because i have money as a result of being a long and not a short
Today I’ll be a better day for visa!
Smartest way to play a big holiday spending season....people are saying a record year is a sure thing yet this has barely moved in anticipation. Dont try to predict what retailer will be the big winner....just play the guy that everyone will be using as a transaction service aka Visa. I'm expecting a big December into january for this stock
V & MA are sleeping
"based on our earnings outlook and capital spending plan, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $12 billion and we anticipate returning at least $12 billion to shareholders and dividends and stock buybacks"
Why the sell off after a very solid beat? Seems it was going to sell the next day anyway. Regardless of what the numbers were.Buying now during this unnecessary dip.
"Visa, Inc (V) is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Wednesday, July 25, 2018.

Purchased shares yesterday and happy to hear this morning that George Soros added V to his portfolio reported today on a 13B.
Now let’s focus on the $300 price target. Visa should be trading a lot higher that it is currently.
Why is Visa down double what Mastercard is down?
Visa is irritating. i've bought it several times over the years thinking it was originally INNOVATIVE and cornering the market in payment systems. BUT...now with FinTech- PayPal/Square/etc...are eating into Visa turf. Visa just lingers at $175-200..for YEARS. ugh. meanwhile these flash in the pan companies fly up to $500 because they say. 'cloud' Visa is one huge cloud of worldwide payment systems. anyways- i am thinking to dump and go to PayPal for a bump. i need to recover some losses in my oil stocks somehow. those dogs are down for 2 years at least....
They are going to blow this ER out of the water. Get ready for heavy duty % increase after hours. People have been using their Visa cards like opioid addicts since late November! Go V!
Can anyone tell me if future blockchain expansion will negatively effect credit card revenues.

Visa stock is undervalued. Lots of room to run higher.
V exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
Purchased 1000 shares at IPO. 4 for 1 split. 1200 percent return and will earn me more after the election.

"$191.22 is the average price target, to be exact ;) good luck into earnings"
What is the ex dividend date of V?
she going to run run into earnings. anyone want to sell I'll take em.
Won’t be long until visa is in the 500B club.
told you to hold. FOREVER STOCK. period
Visa is going to take out $200 this year! Nice chart! Reasonable price
Visa is about to explode on earnings after hours 25% increase. People are living on these Visa credit cards and paying the minimums.
"Have you guys checks the posts on the other message boards. Wow, true Neanderthals. This board is so civilized. Long V since the IPO. Happy camper."
"Great time to buy. Buy bigger amounts if it drops more. VISA, MASTERCARD, ROCK ON."
"v worth$250 now, because it's business rebound a lot more better than any one,"
V value increase slowly but surely. Love it...March to the new high today...
this is really kinda horrible. my first time seeing visa drops almost 6% in a single day
"@Bemo, sorry you missed out on a great Buy!"
Share price rose from 3:40 PM on buying volume. We'll see what Friday brings.
Credit cards will be used a lot in the roaring 20’s. Don’t kick yourself in a few years when this is trading above $500-$1000
This stock does not want to go up? It's one of the worst performers I own. I'm up 28% on Mastercard and I am only up 13% on Visa. I'm holding long term but man Visa has not done that well this year.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CMPY/CWdM9yGC-CMPY-is-our-low-float-bottom-d-chart-bounce-play-for-tomorrow/
Drop end of day yesterday was due to rotation. Some big boy did not want to have V on his books for end of quarter reporting. Probably rotating into big Banks to catch a ride on the next interest rate drop.The pendulum will swing back into V eventually.
"???? If I look at V earnings vs Mastercard earnings, in isolation and not knowing who was whom, I'd be buying V and selling Mastercard. That stocks are moving in opposite directions makes no sense."
"Buy, buy,buy"
"Thanks to the rumor today, we can see such a tremendous opportunity of V which is benefiting the biggest in this environment now and future! Next week, banks go down while Fintech payment V and MA will be surging back from here!"
Visa is everywhere you want to be. hopefully 200 by Friday 
Through all the mania there there has been same good news released about V the last day or two. More global exposure and increased fintech capabilities is what we are looking for. One time 2% or 3% hit to a quarter not worth sweating over if you have any legitimate time horizon. Curious if any of the buybacks have taken place on these dips.
Question... Are fewer people using Visa to process payments today than they were yesterday? No they’re not.
wow did visa hide big mess in data base from this morninig ??pls check
"john screams of small money, very small."
"WOW. Beat across the Board......transactions up over 9%, and a rise in diividend. Great stock and a Great Day tomorrow."

Taste the beast
buy more today
it’s a buy
Hit 200$ today!!!
All time high will be reached before earnings release.
A good break to get in for earnings next week. The technicals aren't perfect but V should have a good run into earnings. Barring all the outside noise.
"Why is ""V et al"" going up...Because people are finally recognizing that ""Facebook's new cryptocurrency platform will provide embattled mosIem terrorists, South American druglords, criminals, thugs and crooks, money launderers and lobbyists to be able to move vast sums of money anonymously, for their devious purpose with the blessing of crooked career politicians who will make more than $ 5 million a year from under the table kickbacks from lobbyists because the source, transaction middle men and recipients are anonymous under the crypto-currency cover. This is a win-win for career politicians, criminals, money launderers, mosIem terrorists and drug cartels.""."
V and MA are some of the best stocks on the market. You'll never regret buying. Society will continue to go cashless. Buy all big dips.
looking forward to V splitting again!
"Looked like a uptrend all week back to $230, tested that level today and immediately started to drop. Visa needs to break and hold $230 to get to $238ish and make new highs."
One Hour and Counting!!!!! Break Out to new highs 60 minutes away!
got in at 130 a month ago love V!!
nice beat by .3
People just overreacting. Still a buy
"VisaBuy it, buy more of it, hold on to it. Long"
The reaction will be muted. The stock has had a solid run. Will continue ride up but at a slower pace.
A pull back has been well over due in fairness waiting to buy back in at 140
Can anyone make sense out of the price action in V and MA considering all the upgrades and PT increases?
Buffett’s #1
Wow this damage will take time to heal I will be adding slowly in the coming months. Could be years until 214 again. Long term investment . Stay strong .
V value increase slowly but surely..Love it my Tea time...
What’s going on with Visa today?
Yea baby!!!
Visa reached an all time high at 219.85
down 2% lol no big deal. it's a forever stock
"""recovery is well underway"" and ""we see the end of COVID""........comments from CEO. BOOM BOOM BOOM! Great results overall. Lets move this over $240 tomorrow."

Visa and Mastercard are the best! Very stable.Don't leave home without them! I should be on T.V.
Your chance to own a piece of a 400 billion dollar corporation in a time in history where society is using credit more then any other time. Exelent investment opportunity at a good price.
I’m proud of my long decision on V. In all my years the largest correction was 25 dollars in 2.5 months back in Sept 2018. Those who stuck and doubled down on shares know the feeling. It was a good investment than and still has more to move higher in the future. Never to late to join the party on this solid Train !

When is the earning coming out?
Heading to $175
Visa will continue to run up into earnings!
Visa is a technology company. Some investors always want to group Visa as a pure financial play. Visa should be trading near its 52 week high.
"Just bought Visa , lets run!"
"Just bought at 149. Lets see how it behavies. Visa is like a tank, slow growth but stable. Right now, due to coronavirus, we have to pay everything with credit card (Spain)"
Looks like a sweet acquisition.
Holiday shopping season!
This stock within the next 5 years will probably double in price(it has too). Me personally I can’t remember the last time I used cash to pay for anything. I’m always using my visa bank card to pay for everything apart from when I’m getting a haircut then I have to use cash and that’s like once a month
Investors were waiting to get the earnings news out of the way. Now institutions and hedge funds will come in and buy.

I bought Visa right after its IPO in 2008 and have been holding it ever since. The 4:1 split was really nice. A 577% return. That's Madoff level returns!
1 years - 180
Back on track!! Let's keep this run going!!
Visa has been great. Got it 2yrs ago at $65. Been adding since on a regular.
Doesn't matter how good the earnings are all stocks are getting punished.No Fundamentals. Welcome to Robinhood world!

Love this stock! :)
will this stay above 181 for the next week?
I’m holding strong! Don’t want to start playing the guessing game on where this is going near term. still have plenty of years to make gains on this.
For those who wonder why Visa is not going up this is your answer. Visa forecasted that single digit growth will continue in 2018. Market was expecting double-digit growth in 2018
Been holding since day one.Expecting a pullback anytime now.
Warren Buffet said you only have 3-4 companies in your lifetime that you will strike it rich with and hold forever..V is definitely shaping up to be one of them.
Analysts at BMO set a new price target of $187 for VISA. 25 % upside from here. WOW

Thumbs up if you have a Visa card in your wallet or purse... $231
"Question: I have been invested in both Visa and Mastercard over the last 8 years. When I do a chart comparison between them I notice that Mastercard stock price has outperformed Visa stock price, expecially over the last five years. Don't get me wrong, I love both companies, yet, I am wondering why Mastercard stock has moved up much more over the years than Visa.Can anyone provide me with information as to why this is happening?"
"Given all the upbeat reports on the payments companies, I'm trying to figure out why on a day when the markets are up 250+ that both V and MA were down. I'm not worried, it's not much, but I don't know who would be selling?"
High target of $250
"Does anyone know if $V still holds any of the 4.2 million Class B Share of $SQ they invested n 2011 and still had in March of 2016?? 3.5 million of those shares were able to be converted to class A shares.Originally, they had a 10% stake in Square when they first invested"
Visa normally runs up into earnings. The run has started. Don’t miss out.
V chart patterns says its price is grossly undervalued.Target $320
That was it. gap up tomorrow.
"Visa is one of the best stocks to own and hold for decades. That being said, everything is dropping so I look for this to fall another 7 or 8 points into the low 120s. At that time I think it's a good opportunity to get in for those who havent done so. Visa has a ton of cash and will continue strong buy backs and increased dividends which are paltry right now but the payout will grow in time. My favorite stock to hold and pass onto the grandkids"
"If you get worried look at V's max chart. It only goes in one direction, UP!"
Grabbed it at 190 seems to be bouncing off around the 188-190 spot see you at 195+
All Time High !!!
This stock is a gold mine. It beats earnings estimates every quarter. Why would it go down?
Getting close to upward resistance. If we can get to $127 life is good. Selling now would be insane. 30% earnings growth from a company the size of Visa? What?
Still looking for a run toward 93 before earnings tomorrow.
Added here!!

Do you think it possible VISA at 300 at the end of 2020?
visa having big problems all across Europe
VISA IS ROCKING!!!
Thumbs up if you have a Visa card in your wallet or purse?
"V is a profit and cash generating machine. Let's look at its margins: 100% gross margin, obviously due to 0 cost of goods sold, EBITDA margin 69.74 percent, operating margin 66.27 percent, net margin 49.7 percent, free cash flow margin 43.6 percent. Go home bears."
$250 at the open tomorrow
Obama would have had this beat by now!
Big buying opportunity. Just loaded up.
"Lots of people been hoarding cash, now I’m really shopping"
Visa will acquire Plaid by the end of the year. More growth coming...
You could really sleep sound at night if this was the only stock you owned .... you would also crush the market most years.
sky is falling
Visa is a steal. Look at the 3 quarters earnings history fyi it always beat.
the stock price rises too fast . its kinda scary
Visa stock ipo date is March 19 2008 with $44 dollars per share. I never forget that date. My money with Visa and still buy from time to time until now. Great Stock..
"Cashless society, contactless payments, e-commerce, international growth, stock buybacks..."
Now you see why I took all my Visa shares a year ago and dumped them into MasterCard. Year over year MasterCard out performs Visa. As sure as eggs are eggs. Visa is a good stock no doubt. Just that MA is better. :))
look at my old posts..and Hopefully I'm wrong..
Another brutal day for the Nastaq and yet Visa was a total stud. Looking very resilient and hanging tough. This is a good sign folks.
Wonder why Visa and Master Card are down while the market is up. Both had great results. But I guess valuation fundamentals don't matter in the current market. Any increase in share value seems to spur a lot of people to sell & cash out.
MasterCard and visa are beauties
how did discover and American Express hold such huge gains and visa sold off end of day 
Visa coverage initiated by Seaport Global Securities at Buy with $250 price target!
Another sunny on visa island
People love having the convenience and security to use their cell phone to pay with their Visa card at checkouts! $$$$$$ Also more and more online purchases every day! $$$$$$ = $$$$$$$ Visa $$$$$$$$
Any other finance page available? .this sucks big time!
"Paypal has reached $168 , why Visa which is very strong company does moves up? Any advice please."
these number were on Quartz....Financial company market capitalizationsVisa$415 billionJPMorgan299Bank of America201Ant Financial200Wells Fargo103Morgan Stanley83Goldman Sachs73BNP Paribas54UBS43Barclays
Just think about how many people will be using a Visa card to make purchases this week! Still very cheap here!
"People do realize how visa makes money right? They make it on swipes- every time a debit card or credit card or wallet or anything that says “visa” on it they make an interchange fee... amazon, online, retail etc anytime a card is used to purchase visa makes a small fee..."
buy buy baby
"LOL, Trump going to investigate H1B VISA fraud, and Visa Stock get dumped."
only my stocks turn negative after positive earnings lol
Costco business improved V bottom line.
Here it goes will give it all back after hours. I love visa wish it was 200 but the games they play after earnings should be illegal
These levels look very inflated now! But in 5 years you will have wished you bought at 218 bargain price The way of investing!
I'd rather sell a kidney than this stock. Been in since the IPO.
Cmon Big V! Cashless future makes this stock surge!
"Been holding this bag for a long time, just don’t understand the constant price flatline. Even after good earnings!"
Visa should be like amazon and set the bar really low every quarter so it’s easy to beat expectations... that’s all I ever see happening with Amazon
Looks like market is expecting a miss.
visa makes me want to singjust let me hear some of that rock n roll music
This can’t be good news for overpriced v can it ?“U.S. retail sales post biggest drop in nine years in December”
you have no idea what you are talking about
"I was looking at Jan 17, 2020 strike $140 put options, it can sell for $1.5. I'll wait for price is stabilized a bit to sell this put options. In the event V drops that low, I'll be happy to acquire it. Since V pays very low dividends, if price doesn't drop below $140 before expiration, I can treat it as it pay out a quarterly dividend of $1.5. Either case you can win. Welcome any constructive comments for this strategy."
What a time to buy.. Going to Rocket after earnings!
1.35 million shares on buy side just past the tape @ 208.81
What's going on here? why down?
Is earning gonna be release after hr?
200 by end of year!
Will add more on Monday!
"This could be it.However, operating expenses rose 16.5 percent to $1.79 billion in the quarter as Visa, like its rival Mastercard spent more to partner with consumer brands, payment processors, hotels and airport lounges to offer subscribers better perks."
John Kelly wants you to sell. your investing in visa God. it's a win win long-term baby. clue guys like him out payed basher. world we live in
"Wish I could have bought more yesterday, bought going into the low $170's. missed out on a few dollars non the less I am here, waiting to see green today and after hours!"
"Why is V not participating in the ""Trump rally""? Both V & MA are both sliding. Does anyone have any ideas as to why it is slidiing, down another $1.33 today?? I have read mostly positve reviews of the stock. What gives?"
FOREVER STOCK just look the chart
Today’s chart is going stronger and stronger!V and MA are coming back stronger!
NOW it is a buy! Adding
Looking for another double inside of 5 years.
"V is good for the investor who wants to be safe. It's always a ""Buy"" in my book. Look at the charts and ratings."
"How do I change the color of the line in the Chart view here in Yahoo Finance? It used to be black and now it's suddenly orange for all stocks I check? I like to choose a different color when I'm comparing another stock against a current view, so I can still do that, but the orange needs to go! TIA for any ideas!"
Down 7% after market what happend
The party starts again.
V for victory start buying because it’s going up up up and soon
"Red before earnings is only a sign that the price may have been overextended. If short interest goes up before earnings it’s a sign of a miss, and I just checked the numbers, there has been no spike and V has average short interest. Earnings will likely bring the price to just above 142-144. Keep in mind that V was at the top of value last week, about to break highs. This is just a consolidation."
I guess Wallstreet liked what they heard at Visa's investor conference 
182tomorrow
Dats our boy!
Bright shiny green in a sea of red ... go Visa! 
I wish I owned more after those online sales on Friday at the all-time record
buy Visa and fuggetaboutit
"If any stock should benefit from Hurricane Harvey AND Hurricane Irma - VISA should. Plus, it is doing more businessin China."
Glitch
does trade tariffs affect this ?stock
V has been on a run up so the price is fixed in for blowout earnings and guidance. It’ll adjust but still a great hold forever
Back in half position. I will never sell again. What a mistake. Visa long I made my bet time will tell.
$250 before earnings
This V's stock is slowly but surely increasing the values . Still here from IPO and keeping buying and haven't sell a single share..Love this stock..
YAY!!!!!ITS A BEAT!!!!$1.07 Vs $0.98 This is HUGE!!!!
Dropped like a rock. Something is up.
"Visa is truly an amazing company / investment. I had it on my watchlist for a long time, and was waiting for a dip to buy in. That dip never came, I eventually pulled the trigger at $89. I was a little nervous I was late to the party, but V just keeps moving north. I just wish I would have bought more."
I wish reddit hyped this one lol
"Some may wonder, why down 5 points from the opening on no news and only half daily volume. A few big boys are accumulating before what will most likely be a very good earnings report. Using an experienced trader, a big boy can drive the price down by selling a few shares, then buying a bunch at the lower prices. This type of action is happening all over earnings season, not just to Visa. By the time the position is made even with stellar earnings , holders will be lucky to make 2 points over last Friday's close."
3 day sell off. back green tomorrow. don't worry too much.
"want to buy some to hold long-term this week, but feel like price is crazy high atm opinions? buy now or wait for a dip?"
Visa is online or in-store payment KING.Will be a winner always!!!
The Coca-Cola Company (KO)NYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price. Currency in USDAdd to watchlist46.21-3.58 (-7.19%)<—- Warner huge and also warned in strong dollar ie visa europe
Used my Visa card about eight times today.
This stock is amazing.
Good ol reliable Visa is green.
Both square and Visa are working hand-in-hand and both are a fantastic investment!
Visa still the best stock. ...
Just turned $2000 into $7100 on $207.5 call for tomorrow. Way to go Visa
Chart says this is about to head north again
Watch for the dip
V stock trades down following earnings and then trades higher. Strategy = wait post earnings for a better opportunity to buy.
Best and most consistent stock I have just steady and climbing
"slight beat on the bottom line, I doubt it will move more the a couple %"
This stock loves to erase most of its gains at the end of the day
"I bought Visa when it went public, should I sell ? :):):) This market will burst it is not sustainable with cheap money. That is guarantied . later part of 2019 things will start to fall apart. its prudent to go to more cash percentage, Buffets cash position is around 130 billion. Not saying sell today, but be ready to buy at a lot cheaper levels next year."
"Something that everyone here may not consider is that Visa is headquartered in San Francisco CA. Alfred Sharp the CEO is very friendly with both Nancy Pelosi and the Vice President, being they both understand how important Visa is to CA and it’s 14,000 employees. Do you honestly think they would stand back and let the DOJ pummel one of their local companies within their home town?"
"Funny how Visa is going down today. This is an inflation beneficiary stock! If you expect prices of stuff you need to go up tomorrow, what are you gonna do today? You're gonna BUY BUY BUY --> higher revenue for $V"
Blowout jobs report
Usually when a company takes over another company for 5B stock price goes downI am not in finance but a long time VISA HOLDERwhat effect will the plaid acquisition have ..Thanks
Maybe should've waited but added on today's dip. Long term holder.
"Visa lagging behind MA, PYPL, SQ etc..........stuck under $199, supported at $189. This soon will change and V will jump to $215 on a catch up. If MA nearing its highs, so will V break out past $200 to $204 by EOW, then $215 not far behind."
There was a LOT of volume rushing in EOD I think we'll see a very strong next couple of weeks if not months for Visa.
$245 is the high price target. Undervalued
Any insight into how the antitrust suit will play out?
"I think V is heading lower, a lot lower. Not because of mismanagement in the company, but because of mismanagement in WDC. You can't have a guy who is this big of a screw-up running things and not expect the market to go south. I think that starting around the middle of February our economy and the market will really start to tank. Trumpy the Clown will make it happen. Good luck all. God, I miss Obama."
"Good solid quarter. Remember, it's the holiday quarter that crushes it so hold on tight and this will be over $200 following holiday quarter."
wow big day....earnings surprise tomorrow?
"Keep yawls’ rally  caps on, ‘cause, V is headed to new highs!!!"
How about a sizable increase in the dividend ?
Got this since 2008Just leave it in your portfoliodon't trade it.....look at it nowwaiting to see 250....
Huge rally from here! ️️️
Just 20 more days till $200 as Jules has promised. Again and again and again.....
down 7.55% and up 5% of that the next day is still a losing bet. lower lows and lower highs. still not time to buy guys
Earnings are going to great and nothing has changed! $$$$$$$
"Zacks has a sell rating for Visa.long V, since the IPO and still adding to my position."
"113 is the next support. I will buy some at 113.83 will be a strong support, I will buy a lot more at 83."
"VISA reports EPS of $1.46 (in line), and misses revenue with 6.05 Billion vs consensus of 6.07 Billion. Yikes. Need to find out about cross border numbers.LONG VISA"
NY reopening new high for Visa
What’s a good entry point into this stock? I still feel like it’ll push lower 190s if not a bit lower. Any opinions and input? Trying to get some good views on stock here. Thanks.
The 7 Best Stocks Under $10 To Buy Right Now! Check out https://youtu.be/Mn6h8_cuLW8
Wow! Go Visa!
I wouldn’t be at all surprised that a hedge fund or short seller is feeding false information to the DOJ in order to spike the shares on purpose even if nothing can be substantiated
just because MasterCard cut doesn't mean Visa will
May get a new high today.
Set it and forget it people. Visa will be just fine overtime with mobile payment getting bigger and bigger.
Still hold since 2008 and $$ keep coming.
any Visa results yet?
"Play the interest rates in the broader market. Money and the markets always follow. Just went more into cash. When interest rates are topped out and close to falling....then shove some more of it to stocks and bonds. It’s an easy game that needs discipline or you get burned. As far as individual stocks, right now is the time to find value with a solid company. Visa was my pick at this point."
Did the whole world stop swiping their Visa card today? Did everyone stop entering their Visa card number for an online purchase? No!
"With all the activity on AMZN and SHOP, we might be in for a surprise."
people are not going stop using there credits cards
Cash cows help investors sleep well at night.
$156 today
V closed the gap created last Thur. and is sitting on the 20 day exp moving average. Appears to be holding
One year target estimate 162.77.
"Very solid report, but is anyone else concerned with lack of focus on touchless payments? I get they are investing heavily in tap to pay but PayPal seems to be taking a big lead with QR code scanning from your phone which very well may be the future and what is already the dominant way transactions take place in China. Would love to hear others thoughts on this..."
This is nearing buying territory
We’re green forgot the feeling
The fall in the past 3 days is NOT cuz Visa's fundamentals are failing. The market force is pushing all stocks down. TBH Visa might fall another 10-15% but you should be happy cuz it'll be a cheaper buy! Cheaper price = MORE VISA STOCK AT A DISCOUNT
Visa ........
I see this stock at $275 and a nice dividend boost in 2020
Seems like every time Bitcoin gets attention and breaks new news.....V and MA takes a drop.
Correction coming.
"Excellent long term stock, just became my largest position. I just turned 20 years old so plenty of time for compounding!"
Two problems here. 1. Investors are moving to value from high p/e stocks. 2. The biz model is under pressure from other companies in the cashless payments space. Both equate to multiple contraction.
"Let’s just think straight on this stock: is there anyone going to use cash after this pandemic? No, because of sanitation reason. Are people still going to buy food to feed themselves? Yes, and they use cards. What would people do if they couldn’t go on vacations or traveling for entertainment? They shop on the internet instead. So I can’t figure a reason this stock not going all-time highs. Maybe it’s just market hasn’t been correcting itself yet. So at this price for sale, I would just buy more."
As an aside..... I'm using my cards more because a lot of banks cut back their hours. It's sometimes tough to get cash out. Visa I assume will benefit. - Pete
alot of after hours action. Are earnings out?
"Gotta love V and IIIV. In fact, IIIV projects FY 19 adj eps of between .79-.81c ! So will add."
I like seeing paypals report of increased volume of payments!!!
Once it break through 200 it will keep going up!
VISA $$$ SQUARE $$$ MASTERCARD $$$
yes this is good!
when the market begins moving up Visa moves down and vice versa. Rebalancing not over.
$300 won't take long with the China tailwinds... 
A day like today and earnings the way they were so why is this not trading in the 180's? Perplexed!!!
Congrats to all that bought the temporary dip in Visa... heading above $190 now
V cash machine has stopped!
"We’ve already had a significant gap up this morning with decent volume before noon. Don’t be discouraged if we have some profit takers coming in later this afternoon who just wanted a quick trade from Friday’s low. This back and forth will continue for days, but watch for gradual recovery. Wonderful company with a huge moat and very little competition."
Bad market day to report a slight miss on the top line. This is really a buying opportunity in V.
$PYPL is eating Visas lunch. What is management doing? They had best wisen up and wisen up FAST!
Big dead cat bounce Let's see tomorrow.
had enough of a beating yet baggys?
It's gone from 115 to 142 in 4 months people. Profit taking as always. Buy on any weakness. We all know it will be way higher in a few months.
Thinking about adding more tomorrow
"Let’s have some fun. We have a lot of opposite ideas on this message board. I think visa is a great stock but I think a buying opportunity is upon us. Let’s see who has this right, pick the price that you think visa will close at on Friday, May 15 and post it here. Let’s see who’s got this right. Good luck"
Visa entering the cryptocurrency world = today’s prices are history! MA I assume will follow suit.
had the stock for over 12 years made a lot of money on it it split which was great and over the past year I watch it dropped from 214 down to 134 when covid-19 it and then saw it rise back up and hit 220 about a month ago and now is slowly dropping back down to around 204 so I'm not sure the reason it's dropping but it is quite frustrating but if I didn't sell it 134 I'm certainly not going to sell it 204 so just hang in there be patient and hopefully things turn around sooner than later good luck to everyone holding long.
nice
Going to $190 for sure if not today then tomorrow after earnings. F
Diamond in the rough.
"V, MA, or XLK? and why?"
been holding since ipo...up 400k...no way am i selling !
Great stock but it is a bit expensive. Same goes for MA
170 by next week
Not trusting this market but V never should have been hit as hard as it was. Even more online transactions. Great buying opportunity though even though I don't trust this market but It will be great in the long run.
While you’re attempting to short Visa think about the $9.5 billion dollar stock buyback plan. Not smart.
I absolutely hate the chaotic nature of the markets right now. Nothing makes sense. Everyone is rushing into whatever is deemed as the latest fade. Im at around 70% cash. Im taking my toys and going home
Upgraded to 250!Load up in any weakness!!!
"V has rising bottoms today, a very bullish sign!!!"
what happened???
I think PLAID would make a good fit for Cohn's CRCH spac by Cohn & Robbins . Cohn of Goldman Sachs and now vice chairman of IBM would be excellent for understanding finetech and it's future putting the top sources for development at their finger tips .
"CBS and Viacom got together again in 1999 thanks to Media Mogul Sumner Redstone. Viacom bought CBS in 1999 for $36.5 billion, in a deal that CNN at the time predicted would ""bring the network of Dan Rather in touch with the MTV generation.""Alas, those lofty prediction proved overly optimistic.Nov 26, 2019"
BUY BUY BUY BUY
With all these retailers reporting great earnings that bodes well for V. $150 soon!
Looking past $200... Visa will get there in the next couple weeks. $250 will be reached by Thanksgiving. Online sales are surging. Fewer people are using cash. International is rapidly growing.
"Shorts said at $100, ""All-time high! Makes no sense! Short now!""That was 11 months and a 40% gain ago. Still chirping shorts? Didn't think so."
Woohoo!
Cramer says buy Visa with the US-China trade deal news today!
"election year, plus covid-19, Fed won't rise rate, so V have huge room to growth, so V will continue going up to $350, so investors should buy V now, in 2017, Trump's tax cut boost V raised to $215 per share from $82, so Trump's save economic plans in this covid-19 crisis will boost V raise $450 per share, because this time money more than anytime, and inflation bigger than any time, and Fed have enough reason won't rise rate,"
$142 before close today
Break thru the resistance!
Are we about to get amazoned...? Frack I hate them and their stupid hype
Check please. Z
V better be at least up 2% today!
"Why would Coronavirus affect Visa? If it does, it would be very minor.BUY VISA!!!"
When is target upgrade coming?
Stock that pleases 20 years with its growth and then pleases even more with its price
why the whole sector on sell? V MA PYPL and SQ?
Slow and steady wins the race
100 more shares this morning
New 52 week high yea thir!
"Take it from me, LIONSTCOKALERTS (gooOgle search) is the real deal. Got two alerts in 4 days and both delivered 150%+ gains ."
Looks like it's at the 100 day ma
I see 150.00 today
"VISA upgraded today: Oppenheimer raised price target to $245, from $212, and maintains “Outperform rating!***That’s a 15% upside from today’s lows!!!"
"Visa will soon break $ 181 and then its nothing but up till it hits $ 205 after which it will slide, stagnate for about 3 months floundering between $ 200 and $ 205 and then break out to $ 240 when it will split 2 for 1 or so..."
Not looking good
140 very soon! Buy when it’s low
"Range bound, need a breakout!!"
if you guys wee up 300k would you sell or hold ?
Does anyone know of response from V? Serious answers only. Thnx.
Road to $300
"@Mark. VISA hasn't touched processing fees in 10 years!! That's why they are raising them which will help their revenues. VISA has a BLOCKCHAIN already to compete with the others. Default numbers aren't up. I predict that VISA will end the year somewhere in the $235-$250 area. Once the virus is contained in China and elsewhere, it'll be like a bubble bursting. LONG VISA since 2008."
"7 billion dollar buyback announced, and the stock goes down. Pehaps somebody wants in."
Visa is going to beat earnings. Tons of people paying the minimums on their cards and maxing them out. The future is bright for the credit card companies (not such much for the holders).
Could see a nice run today!
"Seriously, even with the doom n gloom / churn n burn portfolio managers out there forcing the hands of long hold investors with FEAR tactics, this stock - V - should be at or above 159 p/s."
Stock looks primed to blow thru it’s 52 week high tomorrow
We should be in the 180's
"Great results. Just keep buying visa, it’s a no brainer."
Next stop $230
Visa will fly higher. Just sit back and enjoy.
"Market down, Apple down, Visa up. Very predictable."
we use to have 5% standard and the world wasjust fine. Now 3.2% and everything is collapsing. This is short sellers in action.
"Visa's revenue for its fiscal first quarter (the fourth calendar quarter) came in at $5.51 billion, which was $100 million more than analysts had been expecting and 13% more than the same quarter last year. On the bottom line, earnings of $1.30 per share handily surpassed the $1.25 that was predicted and represented 21% year-over-year growth."
so depressing to see this like this.
Evidently the 3 million shares from the other day are talking today. long and strong
"Bought IPO, up 1100%, 2008,since day one, after earnings release never see a dramatic up tick.I'm still happy with Visa!"
I love this stock.BANG!
did I hear that right Plaid tripled since the split from Visa????
Anyone knows the exact time of the report before open??
just bought some more at 121.1 
$300 stock after earnings
Buy now! The upgrades will be announced soon. Don’t miss the boat.
Could dip more. Don’t get scared
New high Visa. Square beats. Be cautious on tech. Visa is a safe bet.
economic data looking strong. Spending is high. Heavy Visa card swiping going on. $200 stock imminent.
Back in late summer it seemed this stock was stuck in one gear. Im so glad I held on.
V don’t deserve this!!
MM working to get it under $210
What concerns me is when the DOJ starts such an investigation they usually have good reason to. I think it will end bad for Visa.
All time high on the way!
Already up on Mastercard earnings means don't expect much of a lift after they report. If it's a good report it may pop another 1%.
New all time high!!!
up over $7.00 the last 30 days. when will they announce a dividend?
Contactless payment technology
Winter Olympics 2-2018
200 by Friday am
Very low volume.
"I firmly believe we will see new highs as we get to ER next week! We should approach $240 going into ER and exceed beyond this earnings season.I do fear that once Earnings Season is over, we will get a significant market correction. I don't think the markets will absorb or ignore the following:1) proposed tax changes especially ""capital gains"" tax2) increase in corporate tax rates3) impact of administration policy will effect oil prices and gas prices4) never ending spending coming out of congress, Trillions added to debt is not sustainable5) international unrest: Middle East, Russia, China, No Korea6) civil unrest at home, and corporate political posturing7) the unrelenting COVID worries, vaccine questions and variationsThese 7 points are unknowns and in my experience the markets hates unknowns. So for now focus on ""earnings"" but beyond is a worry"
Absolutely ridiculous that is is priced this low. Makes no sense.
I think if we hit $230 by summer that would be great
"3 upgrades and raised estimates today from Wells, Wolfe and Credit Suisse, Market reaction?Buy V today on sale, might be last chance at this price for a while"
All news are about GME. Searching for V earnings release. Hello?
I purchased for the long haul so I have zero problems purchasing more at sale prices. If you have no problems holding long term and don't have to cash in your position in any emergency then every day it drops the sale continues. Wall St logic when stocks get very expensive more people want in and when sale prices arrive many turn up their noses. Unlike most markets in the world.
perfect dip buy opportunity
will close green and reach 210 soon if not today
$200 by Friday
Lower umemplyement means More employees can have Visa card.V will keep going up for 1~2 yr at least .Good for Longs
ATH!
Green by closing!
"Im not an expert but if analysts lowered expectations to account for the virus, then Visa may “meet” the streets expectations. Maybe not so bad then?"
What did I tell you? I hope the xanax helped. It was nice doing business here.
"Loaded up at 113 buy zone, a little extended but LONG term hold. Got it first after IPO 44.00 And has split twice but that’s old school now no more"
Mark on mute
So where is the love for Visa?
Feelings on another split?
MA up today.
Holiday shopping season
Next stop for V is $ 186.00!!!
"V's not going up as fast as BYND. The Fed needs to gift credit card companies with more ""vig"" to create higher profits. This just isn't fair, but it is nice having JPM's Federal Reserve setting credit card vigs. The fox is guarding the henhouse."
"days like today, exactly why ive never sold a share since its ipo"
The current after hours price is not accurate of 196.26. It's actually supposed to be 198.25 (on TD Ameritrade). Please fix that yahoo!
good morning visa. keep going please lol
Why would you sell Visa before Christmas? This is prime time for Visa. Online spending and in store spending will be huge going into Christmas. It makes no sense to sell here.
Volume is a little low today....
V is heading to 215 this afternoon!
"short all u want john, I think the smart people figured out your game. long the hell out this stock and you will make way more $$ then a CD or bond"
Buy now before earnings!!!
Visa & Square! $$$$$$$
Seems like there’s a lot of room to run
Huge buying opportunity!
"Everything down, trump is winning for sure!"
$185 New all time high today! $$$$
"Adding more shares, this is my biggest part of my portfolio, easy money here gang."
V has been oversold for a while now and a good earnings beat could send it to $180 in after hours trading.
"Scrolled through some of John's posts. It's amazing his Commodore 64 hasn't been repossessed yet. These are some of his claimed shorts in the last month. Visa, Apple, Google, Tesla, Lululemon, NVDA and MU. How's it feel to be batting .000 chump? He might not be the dumbest tool in the shed but he's still a tool. Bwhahhahahahahahaa!"
Terrible company headed to 75. Consumer credit huge trouble after jobs nu.bers.
Waiting for January 2019 price. $140. Just wipe out all of 2019 start over.
"I may be just one man, but from my perspective, my monthly Visa bill is still very active.Still buying groceries, alcohol, paying phone bill, internet costs, gas. Just not so much with clothing, or not so essential stuff. Everything is done with TAP and not using cash at all.My bill is still 90% of what it normally is, and I compared it YOY."
In ten minutes this gong to 150.00. Better buy now and make money
Do you guys think visa is a good buy right now ? Thanks for the feedback!
Earnings before or after the bell on Wednesday?
Today’s price action is for the surge next week!
For anyone who thinks they've missed the boat with V.....you haven't. Visa is the king for the future cashless society we are headed for. Just get it and forget it.
Should pop at least 5% on earnings today like Paypal this morning.
Steady as she goes
v is the next trillion company. V forever
More and more people are choosing to shop online with a credit card or debit card. The real growth in Visa has only just begun. Strong buy.
Been there and done that....If you dont have money for food or diapers you put it on the Charge Card and worry about it later
Visa will continue to cause pain for all of the short sellers. People will swipe their cards even more with lower interest rates. Strong buy!
I covered all (other than 152.5 short calls which should expire tomorrow) Yet another good profit run.
"The only thing I saw on the Squawk box ticker this morning was ""Visa's earnings lower""? I admit I only watched it for a half hour."
weaker hands selling precious shares.
"I know what it will take to get the market back to all time highs, and thats for me to sell all of my shares of V. Well it ain't going to happen, so sorry everyone."
built a great base in the 81-83 area over last two months. If earnings beat and guidance is good along with quiet period ending where they can start repurchasing shares again we will take off to new highs and could pass 85-86 by end of year imo. IF beat.

"really Visa, your dipping with fb too."
$150 by the end of the week
It looks like very struggling between $130 and $140
good time to buy this? 10y chart looks great
Make an offer that's 10% higher then MA for Earthport. If that offer is topped walk away.
Now hold 12 shares yay!
206 is coming!
Anyone think cash will ever return to be the preferred currency? Think about it. Most of Europe and the US have gone cashless but that only represents 34% of the world population. As emerging markets develop they will also transition to cashless.
The carnage just keeps on going.
"V was the core of my portfolio for a decade. V will again be the core of my portfolio after this is all over. But right now, Cash."
I am expecting an excellent earnings report from Visa next week!!!
Anyone buying before the call?
"It's hard to catch a falling knife, but congrats, some people did that today."
Someone just purchased 2.3 million shares @ 207.40
Any one care to guess why it dropped back to 226.13 and start back upAt least the 226 held
"Why would you even think about selling Visa going into the summer months? Vacations, flights, hotels, cruises, etc. Strong buy."
I think short sellers come in right before close to short Visa but once the price target upgrades are announced they will wish they didn’t short this stock.
It is sad that most people still do not understand that Visa does not issue cards and is not impacted by people defaulting. V is a Payment processing platform that makes money every time a V card is swiped around the globe.
If China opens up and let's MA and V to operate (process yuan payments)....then V will see a nice bump!
Is this just totally unstoppable? The chart says it all
Still looks cheap
It’s the dollar - a - day- stock . Steady climb to $200.
New high tomorrow...
Is this an overreaction to the firing of the head of innovation?
"When a friend told me he was getting at least one solid pick every week from a certain program I was skeptical. Anyway, I checked out (http://Stocks-tracker.com) and haven’t looked back since. Join them."
They took over the best fintech company there is I just literally mentioned it a few days earlier on another board. You love to see it
"Everyone is at home shopping online, using credit cardsmany businesses do not have coins so they cannot accept cash"
Love this shoulder chart rebound.https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/v/charts
"SHEP. HERE........................ I have said since V went public, it is ONE TO OWN AND WILL MAKE MILLIONAIRES. Rarely does a company go public that has a history and good earnings. Visa had both. V is not one to trade, but to own. Earnings should be great on Thursday. Everyone charges everything now. Until the pandemic, I would use cash for small things like an ice cream cone or at Sonic, etc., but with the pandemic, I don't want the change that could be contaminated. Plus, at some local businesses, they have a sign,""Credit card only""."
buying opportunity under 200! load up and hold long term. 3-5 years from now you will be laughing!
I swear Visa is taking the biggest beating out of all the stocks I own. it makes no sense.
contactless payment generating more Revenue$$$$$
V Forever
would really like to understand why MA outperforms V by such a wide margin. any thoughts from the board?
"SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Notifies Investors of Class Action Against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) and Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 19, 2019"
repop to the top
If we get to 150 I am adding
"Why had MA outpaced V share price so much in the past year? Both should be similar in terms of their business model, is it not? I don't get it, someone please explain. Thanks."
Anyone holding Visa has nothing to worry about.
"Why are we down? Doesn’t matter its going back up, V n MA are long terme, pretty useless to daytrade here."
Finally!
Dow is dropping now visa on deck ?
buy while u can
"Sorry guys, but I had to leave V...bought in 2014 and made good returns but it's just been to flat this year. This stock market is nuts, nothing makes sense so just following the hype and getting rich. Making way more money this year on stocks like IDEX, MRS.V, SOL, PLUG, LTHM, BB, and NIO"
strong finish at the close ... good signs continue 
V + 7.5% !
Contactless payments
Reopening should propel V to ATHs. Very bullish on both MA and V long term. Smart people are buying these two here. You'll thank me later.
Onwards back to upwards!
"V joined JUMIA in their JUMIApay, will JMIA double this year?"

Headed to $150
Help me understand why a rate increase causes V stock to tumble
"All other companies in the industry had a healthy quarter, so I doubt V would fall behind any of them."
Closes right on the high of the day!
V is up 5.60% to 156.80
Buy buy buy! Thanks for the discount Trump! You keep making me so much money.
Am I the only one concerned about the market dropping in Dec. like it did last year. Both were at all time highs.
disappointing day
"As I had mentioned four days ago when Visa was at 206, that it was a screaming bargain because it was upgraded and financial analysts feel that this stock is valued at $244, it will be 2:30 to 2:45 within 3 months, it is already climbed up nine points and four days, but there's still plenty of time to get in for a nice profit, plus to dividend you will receive visa is one of the best stocks I've ever owned, and will continue to,, I run option funds in the past and this is one of the most stable and fundamentally sound stocks I have ever invested and advised on,"
Visa up 8%. I told you months ago to buy before the vaccine because it will soar to 300.
thank you visa
Up we go
Does anyone know what percentage of their revenue is from cross-border transactions?
Moving into Visa for a trade on earnings. Out of Netflix at $176. Bought at $158.80. Now it's time for Visa. Stock is worth $115.
Online sales are breaking records. Cyber Monday is coming. Can you pay with cash when you make online purchases? No.
190 tomorrow on blowout earnings
V is great stock. just saying
"Sell and buy AMC, no brainer AMC is going to explde like GE did."
"Justice Dept. investigating anti-trust issues with V takeover of fintech company Plaid. Probably nothing imo, sets up a great buy or add opportunity. Very bullish!"
"V paid out dividend yesterday and this morning it jumps up 2% in price, 34% YTD. long long V"
"The hedge fund game goes like this. Many need exposure to financials. They have stayed away from the banks in favor of fintech. Now, despite net interest margins going down as the Fed lowers rates there is a move in to the banks................at the expense of V, MA, etc. The rotation will end at some point..........which is to say the selling will slow...........then V will resume its march higher."
WIll it close above 180 today?Of course not.
200! Been asking for months... I reckon this time should be within first 2 weeks of Jan 2020.
I’m shocked this reached another all-time high!!!Said no one. Ever.
Green today?
V. - Spending and implied warranties are strengthened with the use of credit cards. Merchants are more attentive if sales can be pulled back. You have more rights as a consumer when you use your cards. Just my opinion. - Pete..... Esq.
Dropping back again
Goldman continues to descend and now J.P. Morgan too what’s up ?

"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is at war with cash, or more precisely on 500 and 1,000 rupee bills. The two bills are roughly equivalent to $7.50 and $15.00, and account for an incredible 86% of the total currency in circulation. Each will be removed from circulation by the start of 2017, giving consumers just a matter of weeks to deposit the notes. This is all part of Modi's crackdown on corruption and on counterfeit and unaccounted money, giving Visa a huge opportunity in an economy where 90% of transactions are estimated to be made in cash."
Ok - what happened. AH at 142 now down to 134. What was said on conf call ??
This is a keeper.....it will continue to do well.
"I will use the 3 day rule, then slowly start buying in. Visa is a great company!"
If the orangutan manages to strike a trade deal visa is headed straight for $200.
Was there a downgrade or fears over European spending?
Who will buy Square SQ? Thoughts?
Bought more today
SOS. In a vacation rental somewhere in the woods with 15 family members. Go V!
@ John Bemo and Kris What happened? I thought it was going much lower? Sorry the three of you missed out on a great Buy!
lol everyone is trading AMZN before they start Visa
Somebody lend me a million dollars so I can buy more Visa.
"fed printing money and government sending money, so v can reach$350 ,"
MA beat on earnings but deliver in-line revenue and Pre-market up by 8%. Visa beat both earning and revenue and Pre-Market down 2%. Go figure how to trade stock on the market.
Who is buying in this selloff across the board.. Not just buyback by individual companies. $V $MA $AXP
Visa wins when economy opens up and also more stimulus...but they have also been quietly winning with acceleration of online sales because their online share 3X their offline sales.
Costco said it will now take ApplePay across all US stores....thoughts on any impact to Visa. When Visa took over at Costco from AMEX I recall Visa popped.
Waiting for strong PYPL earnings to boost Visa further along with MA tomorrow!
from 171 to 176 so absurd.
like I said V increase in the value slowly but surely. Will be $ 125 to $130 by the end of this year.
My grandkids will love me for investing in V
I think most things will be red today.
New all time high
Sell your gains in Apple and buy Visa!
Get ready for another all time high celebration..
the best long-term investment I've ever seen
Overreaction as always after earnings.... will be back over $210 in a few weeks... LOL... my 26 shares of amzn gain offset my 1006 shares of V loss. Gotta love the stock market.
$300 stock because of the vaccine rollout
quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share which met the analyst consensus estimate
"Oh great, now we have idiot spammers on this board"
V at 201.94 at 5:39 am in pre marketGiddy Uo combos ...
slowly but surely. ...
"Monopolistic? I call BS. So there are plenty of debit card and credit card companies out there. I only read one of the articles. DOJ, nor VISA are commenting.... But the article references ""the people"" three times...Previously cited in the article are ... ""people familiar with the investigation"".This sounds like a crappo hit piece. But we will see. Maybe retailers, if they are so injured, should stop allowing visa payments. Let us know how that works out for you."
"careful here V longs...really nothing but a trading range the last 5-6 months. Today's very low volume advance, not convincing. Needs to close above 187 on big vol. to be convincing, imo. I'm super long, for 10 yrs. with V, love the stock and company. Just be careful, there are gremlins out there for V and the market.NvrBetr"
Visa is a money printing machine
I highly doubt it will make 164 this year
One would think that V would be able to piggyback AXP earnings today.
The march to 200 continues...
"I have owned Visa since it went public in 2008. I went through the 4 for 1 stock split in 2015. I still own all the shares and buy more using the options, covered calls and selling puts almost everyday."
Best stock ever
"Visa $220 analyst Target, $270 year end target."
"Don't be short sighted. Reduced transactions coming.No vacationing, no bars ,no restaurant, many stores closed and so on. Domino effect."
All digits payment stocks are surging today!
"Mo money mo money mo money! Buy more! Christmas came early, can you imagine the price this baby will be at Christmas! It’s a gift."
"I want to throat punch the spammers posting here. Also, I love Visa. Have a great day everyone (minus the spammers)."
Vaccine approved. Stimulus coming soon. $210 tomorrow. $217 by end of month.
Hell yea! Everyone is selling but I’m buying this dip. Love visa! Long and strong forever!
The drop in the ten year will hurt visa. I am trimming
"Lots and lots and lots of retailers missing and warning and retail sales almost negative...Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI)Childrens place Even Tiffany and todayDARDEN DRI parent of Olive Garden 89.47-3.84 (-4.12%)The Michaels Companies, Inc. (MIK19.05-2.14 (-10.10%) <<<This cant be good news for overpriced visa with fed raising rates and taxing imports can it ?"
Visa is in no way affected by defaults. Visa has zero credit risk. Visa gets a percentage of each and every transaction made with a Visa card. Strong buy!
"Probably dip in the am, under 200, but rest assure 204 close is highly likely. Shares will be gobbled up."
why is v down . it have little to with trade on China
Why has Visa just not bounced back? Everything else is at all new highs.
I think that the smart money is selling this bounce. More pain to come...
OMG! Run for the hills. I should never have bought VISA at $77.34. I'm so mad at myself
glad it settled above 140usd.
VISA or MASTER CARD eye on buy out Wirecard AG (WRCDF)
I love this company bought in years ago. It has not failed me keep climbing
"Question for the board. I have held Visa for years and have been more than happy with steady rise in price. We are headed for a downturn, we are going almost straight up in all indexes. Do any of you ever sell and buy back? Love this stock."
I just can’t believe a great company and this is down. It should at least be above $200.00. No reason to be below
V is acting extremely bullish now!!!
V will rally in to today's close!!!
They playing with you down 10% tomorrow
Visa is still very cheap at this price. Buy now or you will regret it later. $200 will be reached soon.
"actually, was ex-div yesterday if record date is tomorrow?"
This stock can easier go to 130!
Schwab fled San FranciscoPinterest just announced they aren’t renewing their lease.When is Visa going to abandon San Francisco

"More Americans are defaulting on their credit cards: analystBy Gregory Bresiger August 11, 2018 | 10:20pm | UpdatedStack of credit cards and American dollars..Getty Images/iStockphoto"
Making way too much easy money with this thing that it should be illegal.
My stock tip for the day is to get rid of all your visa shares. You could pretty much blindly pick any other stock and it would do better than this wash-up
Perhaps a short-term pull back is more likely before the next rally on V? Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awe-someSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
Just bought hundred 137.5
"V spiked to $185 and dropped immediately, looks like a beat but questions if met expectations. This will turn back up once data is digested."
If goes back down to $200 or less will buy more
Time to load up people. Breakout imminent.
"Visa is a good stock , but looks like master card is the better of the two ."
Glad I got in at the IPO. Haven’t sold a single share since then.
Does higher treasury yield affect visa’s price?
$210 today
$230 on earnings
"Buy the dip, hold forever."
Higher highs and higher lows everyday
"I find it interesting that as visa has held up incredibly well the last 3 weeks, news is released about a DOJ investigation. Doesn’t something smell fishy and kind of coincidental about this, as if someone is trying to deliberately manipulate the stock lower to either short it, or buy cheaper shares? I sure do."
"Grow my baby! I wish I'd had more money to invest and hadn't jumped in so early on that dip. Ah well, still gains to be made!"
"Have to wonder why they would release their patent intent just last week?? Something that really isn’t required for them to disclose… Maybe because their stock fell like a rock by $64 in a month and needed a shot in the arm? And IF they can get this patent to technology that exists already? Or is it just narrow enough tech that coining the dollar is new?? Hey anyway the banking world is large and Ripple XRP is playing in this big time… and not just the quadrillions of banking dollars but also securities, derivatives, real estate contracts and anything with the internet of things The more players in this Digital Dollar Space, the more that main stream investors will come to this space. Buy XRP "
See what happens when you don’t wait till proper buy zone
Any idea as to when share buybacks commence?
If governments are going to put controls on cryptos they have to do it soon. As soon as one government does something then they will all join in.
"I have always liked this company. What future earnings hold is a guess right now. The positive, more individuals are using credit cards for daily purchases of necessities than ever and this trend may well carry into the future. The negatives, discretionary spending like travel are way down. Businesses using P-Cards are way down. Wages are going down or layoffs. I think the net balance is negative. Again, it is a great company but don't expect to get back to the high anytime soon."
"If everything turns out good today, I see this touching 180 in 1 to 2 months."
If Visa drops more then I am definitely buying more! $$$
"Anyone who bought at the IPO knows this stock is slow and steady. When it dips, you do not worry. It always climbs back up to new highs."
"This is going to go up before it closes, people wanting to get in before earnings since Ma beat"

New all time high loozas!
Anyone see a point in buying MA too? As they are acquiring different companies?
Walmart and Target both reported a digital sales surge. Visa is a direct benefit from digital.
"Buy st 150 around, whoever buy now is too early..."
In out of this for now but market is getting this one all wrong. Big opportunity under $190. I will be adding very soon.
It's all about the consumer...the consumer is strong…. it's Christmas. Bottom line is V is strong!
Sheep we are not in a recession
"(14 times book value, almost 18 times revenue) expensive no?"

c'mon take out $204.10
We won’t finish green but the main question is do we finish over $210??
New all time high on Monday morning!!!
Hello...John is MIA...where's he?
What are we expecting from earnings here? Beat or miss projections.
Visa earnings per share expected to grow to $8.27 per share by 2023.$8.27 x 49p/e = $405 share priceBetter load up now and forget it.
Why is visa down?!?
will tomorrow be a red day?
New highs coming.
Dividend increase again this Fall

High price target is $225. How long before Visa gets there?
"By the end of the day, it'll be back over 192+."
Did Visa get an analyst upgrade today???
"Big picks, big winners, every week. That’s how I turned things around from losing trades. My secret weapon is (http://Thetraderguide.com). Join them today."
"Well, might take a few weeks to get back to 106. Making money is like digging with a nail. losing money is like digging with a backhoe."
Every year like clockwork some regulators are chasing down credit card companies somewhere in the world. Can they find some other industry to annoy?
"V will slowly go back to 220, starting today. DOJ probe not big deal in the long run. BUY"
They should buy Square on the pull back. Great fit
Bought Visa today!!!
perfect bull flag setup plus cup and handle.... very bullish
How will trade war with China affect Visa earnings from China?
MA and V have made me a millionaire in 4 years through leveraged investing. These are the only stocks I'd ever use leveraged money to buy.
How do people make purchases with Amazon? Digital purchases not cash.
I bought this stock for $210 weeks ago. I shouda invested in GME lol
Headed back above $200
"Seems like when Tech goes down Visa goes down, when Financials go down Visa goes down....Wish they would mask up their minds"
"We just beat the numbers from last quarter which included Christmas. The government shutdown fell more this quarter than last. Plus, Easter season was late so we'll see most of that spending next quarter. A great quarter, for sure, with blue skies ahead."
Question for the smarter folks on here. How is this DOJ issue less/more problematic compared to the similar issues back when this stock first went public? It traded sideways for what seemed like forever as a shareholder.
"I'm not sure that it would be wise to buy while it continues to drop....which is what many have been saying here today. It may not make sense what it's doing, but it makes sense to at least wait until it turns and starts moving in the direction you expect."
A stock that can double by EOY. Buying Plaid is a game changer.

WHY IS THIS STOCK DOWN AFTER A GREAT REPORT?
"I want ONE, just one intelligent answer/reason why V would be below 140, much less where we are today w/ that big drop. Anyone?"
think you would ever sell ? I am in since 80 bucks and before all the splits...dont know if I should hold out or sell out..... any opinions?
Why is Goldman hitting a new 52 week low again today ?
"Visa always dips in the days before (and after) earnings reports. Later next week, the ship should be righted."
We’ll see 270 after this earnings report!
"I am just buying more, there is no reason to sell it. Tuesday will be at 210."
You may be right on the $170. This week.
Incredible triple bear action on no news. Rarely see this.1) 19-day bearish engulfing.2) Opened above upper Bollinger band and now trading below lower Bollinger.3) Broke below 50-DMA.
"Sounds like a buying opportunity! Again, technical charts rule the day regardless of the noise and the news. This drop is close to a 61.8% Fib. retracement of the major swing up from $193 to $228 a share. Look for a low-volatility positive week next week and a steady move up from there on. IMHO, Visa should be OK and will be back in the $220s before you know it so these price levels here are most likely a very good entry point here for those who missed the recent run up. The next target up should be above $240 in a few weeks. Good luck to all!"
does anyone knows if the earnings are before or after the market close tomorrow?
Low interest rates = more consumer spending! More consumer spending = more VISA card swipes!
Best stock ever. Wish I bought in sooner.
Patience always rewards. The true winners never let you down in the long run. Tesla holders will get crushed one day.

Brutal day. No direct news on Visa?
Stimulus checks will come in Visa Prepaid Cash cards. good news for Visa?
Multiple price target upgrades just announced
"Visa was the first stock I ever bought (in 2008 at 17 years of age) and I have over quadrupled my money :). My logic back then was Master Card went up as a stock so should Visa. Plus as I baged grocery as a clerk at a Kroger store I thought it was silly how many people still wrote checks vs using a card and thought for sure that would change in the future. I bought 6 shares with the help of mother. Today that equals 24 shares. In September of 2018 exactly 10 years later i plan to sell my shares. Glad Visa was my first stock, at the time I was also considering RadioShake could have just as easily bought it instead. Oh boy am I glade I didn't. Probably wouldn't still be investing today if I did."
New all-time high @ 219+!!

Did V say they were raising the div?
Visa is down 4.90% to 209.84
It looks like the down side trend line gives support about $202 area. Might look to pick some up if it gets down there next week.
"fair price $130, but if this is mostly owned by tutes they are running out of ideas where to put investors money, hence taking share price out of step with earning growth."
"This is a coiled snake .... they have been keeping it in a tight range for basically the past 1.5 years ... if you take out the pandemic it’s obvious. Sure revenues and earnings fell due to restricted travel activity, I feel the rebound is set up to do well, just may need some more time. The longer this consolidates the tighter the coil gets on that snake ... they lost control at the start of March and it ran to almost $230 ... they needed to knock it back so they can accumulate more. Be patient and let them accumulate.... the more shares they have the farther they will let it run when they finally decide to let the snake out of the basket   "
The march to 250 continues...
$150 good entry point from here.

will we see 180 today?
Call at 5pm good luck everyone
"Visa's estimated earnings for FY 2020 have slid from $6.20 and are down to $5.56 today. I would think that this figure will continue to slide in the weeks ahead.I am long V after buying the recent dip. But after this rebound, V is no longer such a great deal. Earnings are taking a hit. Unemployment numbers will not bounce back in the blink of an eye. Visa is feeling it, too.I will get THUMBS down for this post, but some investors need a reality check."
Congrats to all that bought shares when we dropped below $170!!!
i was really hoping it will go up 5% today
Im pretty certain i could pick the wrong horse in a one horse race
V is oversold. Institutional selling has V down 7% this week. Long term buy right now.
V outperformed In today’s ugly market! 220 is promisingly upcoming!
I have owned a good chunk of shares since the IPO. I just bought a few more. Took cash I had sitting in my account and bought V. This is a dip and it will not last. It makes the most sense to me.
Way oversold! Bought more today! $$$$$$$$$$
I’d be surprised if the market bleed out is over. But I’ll also be sad if I’m wrong and should have grabbed more in the 135 range
Visa is in a strong uptrend. Even on days when the overall market is red... Visa is green on down days.
The average price target for Visa has jumped to $198.74
this dip might go for another week or so..but the best time to buy! will reach 200 when close to earning!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-b2b-connect-expands-32-110000753.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi55YWhvby5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEtkr6CRT2Zc8DpjnEsEhZ9dKVzK5x5JI4a_WAz1yz8c0yIx2F3BRAELHrbofFti5bS6T-znx5YIgYETRboLii4vjW3QrViZoJlFoF9pSxdMmcQI8uEyjhQukEImANyxNGNM2iqUDWQzTh1Hkuf1hmAGINN9qe1IMrCa0wYU8_RR
Its going to be GREEN!
I believe with the solid beat by PayPal the big money will be coming in tonight and tomorrow.
bought at 120 think its time to sell
All time high this week
@xiao. go give your bad advice somewhere else!
244$ next target
Smart money has been buying shares during the dip... A lot of money will be made as we move over $200... Congrats to all longs!
36 different analysts have 12 month price targets from a low of $175 to a high of $231 with an average around $200.
in the confrence call they said there might slow times ahead
Is it better to buy LEAPS on visa or just buy the stock?
I just bought back into V. Couldn't resist at this discount. It's on sale! GLTA!
Still at discount levels!!
This is a gift that rarely happens! $$$$ Take advantage of this! Buy Visa! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
"you just buy all market corrections, and keep making money. 244 target in first quarter of 2021"
How much was the dividend raised?
200. Do it.
"The holiday shopping season, online purchases, and the move to a cashless society will push Visa to all time highs soon."
Love Visa!
"The stock market recovers before the actual economy recovers. Stocks are now being accumulated by institutions, hedge funds, etc. Don’t wait until stocks have already ran up to buy them."
Where’s Jules and his $200 before earnings comments?! Haha
"I know the PE on V is high, but when you think about online sales being up so much, the only way you can buy on line is using a credit card and the biggest one is V. That makes it a no brainer. I guess Buffett agrees since he owns V. Plus when you travel to some way out places in the world, they don't take Discover or American Express. They take only V and MA."
beat
"Visa reports tomorrow (Oct. 24) and it's earnings will surpass expectations as usual. Load up on cheap Visa shares as well as Mastercard shares. In approx. 8 years, this will be a $800 stock, based on it's earnings projections."
"Is Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a threat to Visa? I'm sure it would be eventually. But, Visa executives are smart people and I'm sure they see the threat and are actively working to soften the impact of this disruptive element. Be it fighting it or embracing Cryptocurrencies and working with it."
V will reach $ 185 by 1:00 PM!!!
"Can anyone comment of the possibility of a new payment system in US, like Alipay in China, where an internet company becomes the gatekeeper to the payment system? In that case what will happen to V or MA?"
"Just bought some calls at 209. Previously bough Visa at 195 and watched it drop to 185, held on and sold at 214. Then re-bought at 205 and sold at 218. Love VISA!"
Awesome buying opportunity. Anything close too or below 200 is great.
Lets go V! My largest position because credit cards aren't going away and Christmas is coming!
This is nuts. Down $23 points in 3 weeks
I see a green week coming.
"any word on Guidance, have to assume guidance will be strong because of raise in Divvy. Consumers are happy, money in people pockets and everyone has a job.....holiday season MUST be anticipated to be strong and reflected as such in Guiidance."
Earnings were not great. Numbers well below last year. They beat greatly reduced forecasts. Covid has a stranglehold on this for the foreseeable future.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/visa-digital-fiat-currency%3famp=1
So this is where the clueless come to jawbone?
Everyone knew what Visa was going to say about consumer spending. No surprises. But Visa is essential during this pandemic. No one wants to use dirty cash right now.
This down movement doesn’t make sense to me. $250 stock easily
Good earnings at least puts a floor on the stock. A bad report would have sent this falling below 190.
"V is grossly overpriced. A ""sell immediately"" recommendation has been issued by me."
Gained back almost the entire DOJ loss.
"""Subprime Rises: Credit Card Delinquencies Blow Through Financial-Crisis Peak at the 4,705 Smaller US Banks""by Wolf Richter • Nov 20, 2018 • 67 CommentsSo what’s going on here?hmmmm"
I reckon V will rise to at least 145 by end year!
"Visa, AMEX or MasterCard the best to buy?"
Near ATH. About time buddy.
V exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Stocks-tracker.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
This will run before earnings. Take a look at the history. Anyone selling today will regret it quickly.
"In a nutshell, management did the thing investors hate most. They injected uncertainty in to the thinking about the near term future of the biz."
Go visa!!
Tomorrow I’ll be a better day I’m sure!
I can't believe people were selling Visa a few days ago??? Solid company with consistent great earnings! $$$$$
I heard about V the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"LISTEN CAREFULLY,i checked the ones who writes bearish comments and gives that negative energy to V holders. You not even own V and comin here to write comments. you all hold mastercard and I checked that by entering every single one of yours profiles you unliking other MSTR bearish comments amd you come here and do the same. dont let them distract you."
"This is still a huge reopening play. Get your shots, and go out and spend your stimulus using your Visa card. Pass it on!!! $275 end of year target."
"If AMEX and Mastercard made money, despite COVID-9 lockdown.Visa will beat results hands down.Tomorrow morning - V is 180+..."
Every retail company is reporting a surge in e-commerce and online sales... Visa directly benefits... the stock will surge higher into the holiday shopping season
Back to all time high this week
"V down in AH, assume it is a response to AMZN miss, but PYPL had great earnings which is as much related to AMZN as any payment system. Once V beats should bounce strong.....hope just an over reaction to AMZN."
Curious what there guidance for 2020 will be. A positive outlook could rocket this a negative outlook could put a lid on any gains.
Go Visa !!!!!!!
"Timva, I jumped back in also already made 8.00 per share this morning. Lets see if it hold up,. :)"
"Anyone here understand the concept of MACD? Been trying to understand it using the description on various sites.Can't seem to find an example stock which agrees with explanation given.Here a lot about 'this is a screaming buy' etc, but this parameter doesn't say so.Nothing to do with fundamentals...more to do with understand how the algo traders are thinking."
Why down so much After hours?
"Would have bought it Friday but at a PE of 42 times, not a bargain even after the drop."
Is visa a bit coin play?
Visa any day over MasterCard.
A probe is much less serious.than charges. If the Doj wasn't doing something how would they justify their jobs. Where I work is monitored by the state. They always find something to justify their employment.
I wonder why Buffet is not scooping up more V as he already owns a few mil shares. His managers purchased growth stocks like AMZN and this is a very good opportunity for him in global fintech.
Breakout!
V & MA are technically on sale at their current trading level for investors with a 6 to 36 month time horizon!
Is the market considering V Ma and PYPl as financial stocks today? That why they are down?
I'm lovin Visa and Square! $$$
Reload @ $200
Amazon delivered over 1 billion packages over this Christmas season! What form of payment do you think was used? $$$$$
New all time high after hours. Ohhhh baby!
amazon visathey're just getting started
Headed back above $210
If V didn't beat estimate by how much % it will go down ?
Great company
$231 price target
"Elizabeth, actually Visa did split 4 for 1 when it was at $248 but the date was 3/19 /2015. Due very soon."
Visa is my favorite company in my portfolio. Been here since IPO. I rarely even look at what this company is doing. Just a power house.
50 dma is at $179. That will be a level to watch.
$250 before earnings. $300 this year.
Big earnings for Visa!!!
$200 baby
"V is a lifetime hold. There aren't many that come along that are worth holding all your life, but V is one of them. I have owned WMT most of my life and that is another one, but its high growth days are behind it, but everyone uses a credit card all the time now. When I have traveled abroad, Amer. Express and Discover weren't taken. V and MA were."
Slightly outdueling Mastercard for a change.
should i get back in now? im looking for a small dip to 136-137 but its never coming...
Holy smokes what a beat
"anyone figure why V is dragging and MA climbing? Same business, same model same well everything."
"Stock had a really good Q2 Eps of 1.39 beating estimates and having the highest quarter ever. Even in a pandemic this stock doesn't disappoint....""And given the environment, we are seeing a 400% growth in account holders just in the last month."" This also proves promising for future growth even if the account holders are not active for these month."
"With this market, I think it's heading down short term. It's great for the 8 Billion buyback, and I'll also add more at certain levels. Bought on the big dip just over $130. Bought in the recent dip at $198. I'll add more if it hits, $190, and I'll buy even more at the next support level. I'm in it for the long haul. I prefer buying when it's on sale."
"Going just as I planned. I would like to take a moment to thank the sheep that sold to me at $171-172, I couldn't do it without you guys."
"As Facebook Inc. swims in criticism over its new efforts in cryptocurrency, one of the stalwarts of payments continue to thrive. Visa Inc. shares hit a new all-time high last week, and the card company will be looking to show that it remains on the cutting edge of digital payments when it reports earnings next Tuesday afternoon.What to expectEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Visa V, +0.25% to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, up from $1.20 a year earlier. According to Estimize, which crowdsources projections from hedge funds, academics and others, the average estimate calls for $1.36 in EPS.Visa has beaten the FactSet EPS consensus in the past 14 quarters.Revenue: The FactSet consensus calls for $5.7 billion in revenue, while the Estimize consensus projects $5.7 billion. A year prior, Visa reported $5.2 billion in revenue.Stock movement: Visa shares have risen following six of the company’s past 10 earnings reports. The stock has gained 36% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.25% has climbed 17%. Of the 39 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Visa’s stock, 35 rate it a buy, three call it a hold, and one rates it a sell. The average price target is $186.92, 4.2% above current levels.What else to watch forAnalysts see positive indications for the card companies coming out of recent bank earnings. Barclays’ Ramsey El-Assal points to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, -0.99% and Wells Fargo Corp.’s WFC, +0.46% accelerating purchase-volume growth, which along with “other leading indicators similarly point to a broadly healthy spending environment in the U.S.”El-Assal has an overweight rating and $170 target price on Visa shares.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/visa-earnings-as-facebook-seeks-to-change-payments-visa-stays-the-course-2019-07-17"
This crisis encourages contactless payments in the USA.
Almost Everytime Visa release the good number then stock going down. Hopefully this time is different.. Check the history before made a comment.. Owned V since Ipo...
Nickel noses to drive/keep it under 236.00
Market open this morning down nearly 500 points. End of the day Visa is up. You can't beat the stock.
Was really hoping the Q2 GDP Print was going to give V a boost. Aug 17 $145 calls needs some help the next few weeks!
"The market is rigged, SEC is rigged, Dem govt is rigged, the whole america is plagued by the super rich since the Obama regime, 'cause the super rich is at the helm of power to influence and corrupt the financial system, and all systems in the hands of thesehandful of people. how much higher these stocks can go remains to be seen. and the share price is skyrocketing, feels like the economy is at the heights of its glory. GDP is 25% or more WOW !"
Cross border travel is back
"Bought more, looks like a typical drop according to the charts. Love this stock."
Keep pumping Buy Buy Buy
At last! Some good news!Dividend increase.Must be positive if it can distribute more free cash
Feel like I missed the boat on Visa. Still a buy tomorrow?
cmon. go up
New all time high. V keeps gettin it done.
Contactless payment technology is the future and Visa is at the forefront of the transition.
Visa looks cheap at this level.AAP will lift for sure. Expenditure on Apple will soar V to 250 after earnings
Remember folks. The end of year selloff will likely happen earlier this year (Oct) with this down trend in play. Be careful.
Amazing investment!

"I was waiting for the stock to go below 200 again in order to buy. I invested a little bit before the earnings. Gonna buy some today too because there is a big chance they will surprise us with good results. If they don’t, no worries. I will buy some more after the earnings too. It’s like that with such companies... Visa just has big and long future. You don’t sell Visa easily because you all know what the cashless payments situation will be after the pandemic."

"Thank you V. Just added more to my long position since buying at $31, $59, $71, $77, $122, $131. Know this: this is a MONEY-MAKING MACHINE. I made money on AAPL, yes. But eclipsed it by dumping AAPL in 2013 and shifting all my old AAPL positions into V. Compare the 5Y chart of AAPL and V. You’ll see what I mean and with a nice escalator up chart, without the worrisome valleys. BUY THE DIP and retire like I did in my 40s with VISA."

Bought AT&T---DOJ stepped in to foul up a merger. THEN I buy Visa---DOJ steps in to investigate. The DOJ is more detrimental than the virus.
when will V have another split? At what price can we expect it?

Visa directly benefits from a cashless society.
Every time someone buys something they use their Visa card and that money should go to the shareholders.

"If you're looking for perhaps the world's most perfect stock, your search might end with payment processing giant Visa (NYSE:V). Since the company went public in March 2008, shares of Visa have risen by 581%, inclusive of its split in 2015. Despite this strong move higher, there are plenty of reasons to believe there's more left in the tank.Here are 10 reasons Visa just might be the world's most perfect stock."

Visa is a payment processor that makes money by the amount of volume. The lockdown Internationally started mid March and continued for the month of April and will probably continue till end of May. The next earning reports Visa will report for the month of April - June. I am assuming it will be really bad report because of the lockdowns and tiny volumes in April and May. What are your thoughts on this? Last quarter they reported only half of March was effected January and February were good as businesses were still open

"Tomorrow should be a big win. Good earnings, after hours looking good and the overall futures for tomorrow are looking strong."
Buying more today
Credit card use is surging. On-line sales and mass buying.
"As I sit wishing I had more cash to by more I looked at 1 month chart. V has been dropping for a month. Each low is lower than last. Old school says this is going lower untill goes up and holds the up move. I dont see a bottom forming ?? What am I missing???? I dont want it to go lower, think it should be higher ie 205 or better??"

"Not a bad price considering the 52 week high, but it can go lower with the fee disputes and effect of funds."
Visa (NYSE:V) reported quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.28 by 10.94 percent. This is a 2.74 percent decrease over earnings of $1.46 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $5.70 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $5.53 billion by 3.07 percent. This is a 5.85 percent decrease over sales of $6.05 billion the same period last year.
I heard people are getting out of the Visa; MasterCard; etc...and going to those high flyers....I guess this is too boring for them LOL
Earnings are going to be a miss. Could see 10% drop by Friday.
Amazing earnings in the middle of the pandemic with most travel limping around and now an upgrade:Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch maintains Visa with a Outperform and raises the price target from $255 to $265.
why are we down so much for no reason?
SO MUCH FOR SHORTING 168.LOL!
Most purchases being made right now are being made digitally or with a card. Most people are not using cash to make purchases.
"i worked for visa for 25 yrs. when the economy is good, people use their credit and debit cards more. when the economy is bad, people use their credit cards more. visa is a cash cow."
Visa in past years have beaten earnings big time. Not once after those type of earnings have I seen a big jump in stock price like you would with a joke like Tesla. We always struggle for a 1 or 2 point gain. Tomorrow we give back a weeks worth. I hope I’m wrong
3rd quarter profit jumps 33%. that is awesome
"""Visa Expands Crypto Footprint..."" What a great company. Looking forward to what the future holds for Visa"
Is inflation and higher interest rates good or bad for Visa?
"just another bear trap, moving to all time high by the end of the month. Even with bad earnings for the foreseeable future, stock price in these times not related to earnings, balance sheet only look at 10 yrs down the road. if the PPS will be the same 10 yrs from now, good enough to buy. 0 interest rates."

"I was watching the Canadian news, and they said that over half of the infected people in China have already recovered. Watched the American news and they said between 30,000 and 34,000 people die from the REGULAR FLU every year. Do you think that the Media has hyped this up. A DUH. Fundamentals fine for VISA, and even with their warning, they are OK for the year. LONG VISA."
PayPal and Square are at all time highs but you sell Visa? Not smart. Visa is not even at its 52 week high yet.
Visa is building a new base. $200 will be reached quickly.
long time bull here. in since 50. this is priced to perfection and yes there is a lot of opportunities but I'd pick up some puts or sell some calls into earnings
We are lucky this isn’t a 30% or higher death rate virus or cash would wipe out humanity.I do believe cash practices need to be something of the past.
"VISA LONG TERM. Owed since 2008. Good bye to short sellers, hello to long term holders. Visa and MA to good to be true. I can see it hitting $250 this year."
This is all great news for Visa. This stock is a 200 dollar stock in an 80 dollar suit.
ARGH. Forgot to buy this gem. Could easily go up +3% next week. Whether it surpasses that 3% or stays there: no clue. But that uptick is all you need as a trader!
"This has been going down for a week, why do I think there was insider information?"
"Visa is and always will be king. Best stock to own. Buy all dips and forget about it. 10 years later, enjoy being rich"
Best stock on the market!!! Guaranteed to make you money! Long & Strong for years to come!
"Old adage is “hits $90, hits $100. Wonder if that applies to $190/$200. I’m betting it does, old adage notwithstanding."
Share buybacks will start soon
We seem to have lost $1.50 on our current price over the last 90mins...
"The 8-k is out. Visa is now guiding for adjusted EPS growth rates of just under 60% for fiscal 2018 vs 2017. The company is almost 10 months into the current fiscal year, so analysts will need to scramble quickly to adjust their own forecasts to match."
Always buy Visa. Cant go wrong.
going to be volatile for the next month sell at 140 buy at 137 do this for the month of november

Diversification is the best way for most to survive investing in the market long-term.
American Express beat expectations. Visa will continue to run up into earnings.
Everytime I buy call options this thing drops I'll keep y'all updated
"I added more here. Next support around $190 IF it goes that low, I'll add more."
strong holiday spending. itll be back up tomorrow
"V @ USD 201 on 09.08.2020, after being @ 215 last week, makes little sense in an overall market where Tech Stocks are tanking. Visa is not an innovative tech stock, other than being a huge user of hi=technology, which are not the same thing. So, Visa is being dragged down in value for the wrong reason. Buy V."
New to the market. Bought in at 147.91. I have 5k waiting in Robinhood. Could someone give me some advice on when I should buy more to help with my loses. Thx to all. GLTA
Just broke the $180 resistance!! Let’s go V! Who thinks it can push higher?
The lowest price target is $203... why would you sell it here? Huge upside!
Visa leaving San Francisco could boost profits
Too difficult to sell and take capital gains. I'll go into a Hold pattern. New funds go to MA and MSFT.
"I'm going to be honest, I bought puts on V. I'm expecting it to pull back to 225 at least within the next 2 weeks. Sorry. Who knows, maybe I'm wrong."
"V has a proper chart, slow steady climb for life."
It's all good! not worried at all.
V issuing bitcoin debit cards
"Sup fellow longs? Yall need to stop tripping....we got a killer dividend raise and beat all the the street's expectations... it will be higher tomorrow with a probable short squeeze tomorrow...dont worry, about a thing... Cuz every little thingz, gonna be alright... c'mon guys/gals, pretty much all of us own at least one Visa card... plus holiday seasons coming?

today visa ATH. i will be here before closing. crypto business is huge you cant run from it or hide. you will be run with it. ps; $227 today.
300b market cap soon.
Any updates ?
"It really doesn’t matter if Visa beats or falls short. When the market fell which they term a waterfall drop Visa fell right with market down to $133, look at the Dow chart, Visa is identical. I think this rally will lose steam very soon, probably first part of May. When it retest and falls Visa will drop right there with it. The performance of almost all stocks is tied to the direct overall movement of the market, strength and earnings become irrelevant. Keep your eye on the market most of all. Good luck."
Visa collaboration with Costco alone is going to generate revenue growth for years to come .
"During the three months ended December 31, 2019, Visa repurchased 13.0 million shares of class A common stock, at an averageprice of $179.71 per share, using $2.3 billion of cash on hand. The Company had $1.7 billion of remaining authorized funds forshare repurchase as of December 31, 2019. On January 28, 2020, the board of directors authorized a new $9.5 billion class Acommon stock share repurchase program."
new highs coming
$190 tomorrow morning
"Buy V today, get off your parents health plan in 2020!"
Huge buying opportunity
"Keep adding .. I own v and cost for years ..These are a few companies pricing power , along with msft .."
"I asked my pet bird what he thought about V at today's price. He hosts keeps saying over and over ""cheap""."
"better days will come,let's think positive!"
"Don’t care if its up or down few %. If you own Visa, time is your friend. I am up 230%. Just hold and never sell!"
Love to see this under $150 to load up.
Visa may really reach $200 this month
"Folks, if you understand Friday’s price action, you love it and enjoy riding V up from here! "
This just to show how corrupted and manipulated this market can be. I am happy the stock is going up..no complain there. but from as low as 129 yesterday til 138 as of now.. it's insane.
cashless is perfered in Covid land. online shopping is credit cards. credit cards pay you-debit charges you. everyone is broke and can't work. everything costs too much.
"I think it will only get better! With tarrif going on, spending will increase Visa and Mastercard will charge more meaning more income!"
Visa should announce that its looking into Bitcoins
What is visa doing with bitcoin- like square or PayPal
Ahahha the reaction to John's comment made me buy more
I bought in @210 and then right before the market close it dip down below 208.
Which company has the better competitive advantage? Visa or MasterCard?
Goldman has breached 200 dollars per share seconds ago.. the falling market will eliminated the wealth effect and greatly reduce credit card  spending in coming quarters...
This can?t be good news for visa can it ? Mmm tanking huge...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-cut-2-000-jobs-125852230.html
I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHY ITS NOT ABLE TO CROSS 180... SWINGING BETWEEN 174 TO 177
Very disappointing that Visa gave up on Plaid. I hope Continues to expand their reach in digital payments and stays relevant.
"Buy, and accumulate V & MA ahead of the start of vaccinations for COVID-19!- These stocks are currently basing within a static trading range — a catalyst, like needles going into arms, should spark a breakout to higher ground!"
Why down AH?
lower highs lower lows no thank you. I will buy when RSI riches around Thirty. be patient Longs and your patience will be rewarded. do not lose money rushing yourself in a bear Market too early. Have a good luck everybody
"Visa and SIRIUSXM endeavor into in vehicle commerce. This will make a subscription to the service very easy and accessible. In fact, it will make the ordering and paying for many goods and services very easy and accessible right from the dashboard of your vehicle using your visa."
V is down 4.90% to $135.33
will run to $275 within 45 days off this beat
Amazing stock and lifetime hold. Dividend payout is only 18 percent which means this thing can keep increasing dividends year after year with plenty of cash left over unlike an ATT or Verizon or someone like that who has a payout ratio near 100 percent. Hold and buy the dips.
"I underestimated impact of a the RSI yesterday. Upgrade gave V a little more gas up. But my ""big picture"" of V going down a bit more along with the market in general is my expectation. Covid concerns based on record new cases in the US and new restrictions in France. It's all fear based which creates opportunity. I'm still waiting a few days to see how it all lands."
"$300. For sure, maybe more"
Covid related E-commerce is creating tens of millions more transactions per month for V...people are buying far more things online and more transactions are needed to acquire these things than going to a single store....V is a huge beneficiary of this.....we're going higher IMO on superb earnings after the bell....
Point of interest - A lot of bank branches have been closed recently due to Covid so I/ we had to use credit cards more often.
Mark muted
If you need a dip to buy. This would be it.
What if $2T fund is approved ?Will people spend $1200 with Visa card ?
"Strong stock the past two days. When they finally let this thing go, it is going to move Long: $V $CNR $TD"
"Is there any news that came out causing this drop? Not nervous long term, just surprised to see this down 2% today."
Strong buy!
"I don’t know what’s happen visa is not move forward, we see how go’s tomorrow and Monday!"
$200 soon
Who in the right mind will sell this stock?!
"The fact is revenue and earnings fell vs the prior year eventhough they beat estimates. For a stock trading at 40+ times earnings, that is not ideal. I know fundamentals don't mean much in this market, but someday they might again."
"cool report , going down.."
I have Amex should I sell it to move it to visa ? I want your honest and professional opinion please
Visa is definitely a great stock for long-run .I regret I didnt buy enough at $163 one month before. But I guess it may have some huge pullback in next few months . I think that is better opportunity to buy.
I bought at $45 (split adjusted) in 2014. Sitting on 130 shares with a nice gain. I don't need the proceeds but from a trading standpoint maybe worth it to take some cash off the table? Let it run?
Share buybacks
$150 before Friday of next week.
AWESOME Qtr results V!!!
"How can V drop on a day like today. There is a huge tax cut, how can this not possibly help V earnings??"
"can anyone tell me why the big sell off on V today?? Monday,nov14; i cant seem to find the cause! Thanx!"
$200 will be reached due to online shopping acceleration. Visa will be greatly rewarded for the surge in online shopping.
New all time highs by end of month.
any word on earnings?
V is strongly rallying back from here!️️️
Great news! Now I wanna see more than $125. Come on VISA.
Visa and Plaid terminate merger agreement...no wonder the drop:(
Like I mentioned yesterday ..the Fb number is weak caused the market tumble plus today MA is hammered by increase the cost of operate...Otherwise Visa will be up at least 4 to 5 point today... This is just temporary case for Visa. See Visa when the market open..not bad at all until MA with lousy news...
Upgrades are coming :)
"A beat of estimates on earnings and revenue, down from last year as expected. Solid results from a solid company, I have been holding for years great returns will continue to do so.I also hold MasterCard and expect similar results."
Cash ban = more transactions for visa. Earnings of business not accepting cash isn’t baked in the price yet...
Just relax
Online sales up 19.2% from a year ago. Lots of VISA CC's being used.
"There is a large short position in Visa. Cant understand how that is, in a stock that continues to go up? Someone must be taking a blood bath ???"
Buy the dip I keep saying...buy the dip. This thing don’t take dips!!
Hope you all scooped up some shares this morning!
"New high, congratulations to alll you longs"
Down day for the market and V is holding; sure sign earnings will be strong

Visa or microsoft? Which is a better buy?
"Hey guys, you all seem smart, do yourself a favor and get a piece of FB before it retraces. A few call options are gonna go a long way. It should retrace about 38-50% tomorrow just using Fibonacci. Just look at Netflix after it tanked. Obviously there is risk, but I CANT imagine it won’t retrace."
heard that visa has made a patient on a digital currency like bitcoin? will this be putting anymore strength to the price of the visa stock or would that be nothing to do with the stock price?
"With people using credit cards for everything today for Internet purchases, traveling, gas, groceries, bills, and now being used for SQUARE readers everywhere I am 100% positive that both are going to double in a very short time! $$$$$$"
Better than bitcoin! Or should I say better when bitcoin was better?
oof
Up 10%!!
"well, we saw double the average volume on V after it was manipulated down. I'm hoping thats a bullish sign to buy for earnings"
What's the panic?
doubled down
CNBC half time just marked Visa with huge amount of unusual option 215 call expired this Friday! ️️️
"196.69 good entry point? I think so, hope my order is filled today."
"It’s a great opportunity to accumulate these great businesses of our time on weakness, ‘cause; they tend to take off in a spark, we investors regret these moments of wasted opportunity — when V and MA are languishing in the “bargain bin”."
why is this down $2.60 in after-hours?
New highs tomorrow
Keep sitting on the sidelines and missing out on free money
"If it looks like a  bear market..Feels like a bear  market..,Acts like a bear  market...Well you know the rest !Or DO YOU ????Can you see that v and this market Is being pumped and dumped every day ?Are you learning anything ?"
Retail sales rose 9.8% in March.
The cash injected into the economy has to move around. Some of them will travel through Visa.V is a M1 Abrams tank. Do not stand in its path.
"V is one of the most underrated stocks, its going to replace paper money, this is just the beginning"
Visa and MasterCard on 52-week highs and PayPal right behind them ......good times!
we should see 108.15 by friday.good accumulation today.will work its way higher. ALL ABOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I like this stock. Everything is a go-go. We're up about 12% since our last purchase. BUT I'm worried, what happens when people don't pay their bills. Does V suffer or is it the banks that issue the cards?"

"seems like doubts about doj probe finally out of the way, back to 227 sooner than later."
Any idea why V is down and entire market is up?!
Visa only up .79% but my $97.50 Sept Options soared. Nijarian bros on CNBC right again. Still holding  for two more weeks.
almost 1.8x avg volume...we got dumped
"Does this one ever dip? I’m looking to buy, but it looks like it always goes up "
Wait until next month when the credit card payment defaults start rolling in
"Very upsetting news, but Visa is still one helluva strong company."
Love Visa!!
"This is criminally undervalued, wouldn't be surprised if we are soon back at 210"
next stop on this train is 106.75. all aboard!!!!!!!!!!!!
do i smell 200?
"Opening red and hopefully closing green, this stock will be the most dependable in 2019."
Congrats to all longs in Visa. $300 is on the way.
Evidence Buy and Hold works. I bought Visa on the IPO at $44 a share. Split 4 for 1. Now heading towards $200 a share. God Bless America.
I'd rather sell my kidney then this stock.
I bet V is also buying today. :) Already close to 12 million shares.
Yahoos boards are as full as spam as they ever were. Get your act together Yahoo. Are you ever going to do something about all the spamming?
It will be up tomorrow...and pretty much every day after that.
Visa always seems to get the unfavorable Wall Street treatment compared to MasterCard… But to me it seems like a more innovative company. Am I wrong?￼
Another leg up tomorrow after Mastercard crushes it.
finally this is green pre-market. we need the WSB capital for this stock lmao
I can't wait use my Visa for trip after pandemic over .
GREEN
Serious question. How could Bitcoin/cryptocurrency affect (either positively or negatively) visa?
Josh Beck the Key Bank Short selling analyst Should be Strung Up and hung out to Dry !!!
"Come on guys, don’t sell in panic. It is a great stock."
I've been bullish on visa since the IPO but now I am selling all my shares Visa and MC's recent decisions against crypto will eventually lead to their irrelevancy and demise.
Thanks again for the 193.4 short bag_holders. Easy money
You people are crazy who are unhappy with up another 2%+ after hours. Obvious total lack of investing knowledge on this board. Clueless people man.
"“Tech, luxury goods lead Wall Street slide“"
"You are telling me -18% during a pandemic is bad??? Many industries are down 80% in total revenue. That’s all that matters- all the games behind the curtain on investments and operations etc... mean nothing. I’m going to buy buy and buy more if this thing drops. Either the world is over or it isn’t- simple investing theory some stocks actually live by, which would include PayPal."
Just added d to my position which I began from the IPO.
I would think with inflation worries V and Ma would go up.....The more money spent the bigger the cut to the fin techs
I thought visa has higher growth since they team up with Costco
bankruptcy by end of year.
absolutely no reason to be down!
Online purchases and contactless payments are surging.
Visa will benefit from opening up trade AND their share for online sales is 3X their overall business.......they win either way!
Heading to $300
"Need another dip, more shares I’m a buying. Love this stock."
i like to go to the moon!
I’m looking to invest in some companies but I’m not seeing much promise. Why should I invest in V at this price? I’m not shorting or being negative either. I’m dead serious because I’ve owned this company before.
"thanks for this beautiful opportunity to buy this beautiful business. bought some today, gonna buy more if this drops more."
What's going on with Visa?
FB dragged market AH
How big will dividend increase be this fall
Just buy more and enjoy your profit...v and ma are winner winners!!
Extremely undervalued
I <3 visa
"Profit taking volume is dissipating fast during this final hour of trading — that means many enterprising, and value investors are undergoing a “mind meld” over the continuing bargain level of FB’s current trading price!*** It’s a clear indication that this post earnings rally has extremely strong legs to hit a “parabolic growth  surge” over the next days and weeks ahead!"
"Hey ROB1, 2 Weeks ago I Spoke out about Visa Stock, and I said being in this game for over 40 years and being an investor of Visa for over 12 years, I had a good handle on the ups and down swings, I mentioned when Visa was at 194 that it was a Steal and would only go up, and said it would hit 220 Before the End of February,,,and you chastised my comments doubting my statement...Well my friend Today it hit 220 and it's only Feb.24th. I hope others followed my suggestion, because it's a stock which has a nice dividend, and a long term future, with the possibility of another split not too far down the road! Good luck to All."
This stock will make millionaires. You just have to keep buying and holding. I can't wait for the next stock split. (AND DON'T GIVE ME THE #$%$ ABOUT IT IS STILL THE SAME VALUE AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE SPLIT) You limit buyers like BRK-A How many can afford 100 shares of that?

"It’ll dip around 4pm, then load up on the cheaper shares. Visa will be at $150 in no time."
"I just read an article saying Kroger is prepared to stop taking visa cards just like food co.did. I've basically shopped at Kroger my entire life, but that would be the last day i shop there. I have 3 other choices that are cheaper than Kroger, but used them because they were convenient. I use visa because its convenient and secure. Their customer service is top notch and I've never had the card mis used by others. My wife uses master card and has problems all the time. Twice in July alone had fraudulent charges on her MasterCard from Apple store, they sent a new card, but it happened again. She's finally switching to visa. Kroger will learn, there's a reason visa gets paid more, they are worth it!"
Amazon Prime Day is tomorrow. Just imagine how Visa will benefit from the online sales. Visa is still cheap at these prices.
blockchain at this point in time is much too volatile to effect credit card revenues
Increase in credit card activity by Citi and JPMORGAN 
"one thing I know is that money gets spentand online, it's plastic in fact- cash may be dead after this"
"Think about how everything was closed in April, May, and June of last year. The bar is set extremely low in comps. Visa will reach $300 this year."
Is there more gain left in V given that it’s up around 40% in last 1 yr compared to MC’s 54%
Unreal that it was flat today.
150 price barrier...need to overcome!
"Visa has been highly undervalued for quite some time now, love it gives me time to buy more shares!"
Here we go ! Markets going up !
"During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 16.9 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $137.82 per share, using $2.3 billion of cash on hand. The board of directors authorized a new $8.5 billion class A common stock share repurchase program on January 29, 2019. Including this additional authorization, the Company now has $9.8 billion of funds available for share repurchase. On January 29, 2019, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an asconverted basis) payable on March 5, 2019, to all holders of record as of February 15, 2019."
"I know they are raising dividend, but did anyone hear by how much??? Last dividend went up 15-16 %."
I'm in 100 shares for fun...hopefully 2-4 points beat or miss to average down :)
Visa is going up. This stock will pass the 200 a share mark.
I am not very much concerned about this drop even after beats. Visa is one which runs slow but very steady and win the race for u. Stay long and strong.
Why?When buyback starting?
I know one thing...Abolish the Fed had been getting his *** handed to him with his short visa play. Well on his 3 shares. What a moron.
Congrats to all long holder Visa' stock. Another new high..patience is the key.. Sorry for those in and out plus shorties...

$1.30 beat $1.25
Visa is Buy HIGH Sell HIGHER!
@Matt don't forget to thank President Trump for buying more Visa at a discount! $$$$$$$ Visa long and strong! $$$$
"No offense anyone but my prediction was corrected. Low today at $158.55 then pull back up. Great performance of Visa and this is how Visa react each time during quarterly release their number. Another factor only long time holder this stock knew is for the next 2 to 3 weeks, lot of financial institutions will upgrade this stock with higher prices target then this VISA will up to $170.00 to $180.00 range.."
Remember that Amazon had record online sales. Visa directly benefits.
what wrong with debit card practise? you spend what you have and not on credit. why investigate?
Just needs to break the $180 resistance
go
buy buy buy
why is visa 135 and mastercard just hit 200?
"$230, Wooooo!"
Technical positive with Breakout since lengthy consolidation period stemming from July 2019. Fundamentally positive with acquisition of Plaid leading to market expansion and revenue growth. Longterm holder. Good Luck.
I just sold. Will rebuy one day when trump not in office/
Wow. I picked the wrong day not to pay attention to the market. What a bloody mess.
A very good day for V. You'll likely have much better opportunities to buy in the future. It is probably too early to get caught up with this updraft.
this minor europe issue was no reason to sell
