what's the reason for today's pullback. Both HD and Lowe's are likely busy for spring/summer season.

"Home depot beats again and again every quarter and never sees a 10% pop like some other companies.But it's ok, Go longs!!"
Yes correct
I noticed that the STREET.COM puts out a negative article every hour on Home Depot. This is Jim Cramer's company who buy the was has a BUY rating on the stock. All his commentary on CNBC is negative and it seems like he is trying to take down the home builders and specifically HD not LOWE's? Am I missing something here but it seems like he wants it to go down so he can get in on the cheap?
People are broke so who will be buying anything ?
"I have never and probably will never own HD stock but after what I saw last night, I would sell it ASAP... My husband and I went to a Home Depot and the place was worse than a pig pen, especially in the lumber area. Wood was garbage, strewn all over, no help, couldn't find one straight board, and the floors were absolutely filthy and half the price tags were missing. On the other hand, and I don't own Lowe's either, Lowes brought in a company to clean their stores and discover missing SKU's and make the place presentable.Never again going to Home Depot..."
ATT HD IS A BUY GOING HIGHER MONDAY UP ABOUT 4 POINTS GET READY BIG MOVE MONDAY..GET IN WHEN YOU READ THIS 225 FOR HD CALLS ARE HOT HOT
mad money Cramer slammed the Analyst. said this stock is solid and they didn't listen to a friggin thing g on the earnings call. this stock deserves to be blowing up after the quarter upgraded guidance that got
"I started purchasing HD in 1988. I purchased all the way up through 2000. I still own all the shares I started out with. HD has been very good to me.I purchased all of my shares thru a DRIP plan. I will be able to retire off of HD alone. I purchsed many other companies thru DRIP plans. If your reasonably young, get into drip plans and forget about touching your stock. I am 69 and looking forward to retiring."
"Should go higher with all the repairs for down south cold spell, Freezing pipes, water leaks, damage drywall and carpet, plumbing parts, heaters. All supplies to purchase at Home Depot for repairs."
"Interest rates, high or low, people will be fixing their houses. HD is the beneficiary !"
Look out $138
$HD Upgrades Gordon Haskett Buy USD 315
This will drop 10 prevent after earnings whether good or bad.
...solid buy and hold long term at this level...
"Lowe's is down even more than HD, and it seems the stock price drop is related to lowered earnings expectations in the industry."
"Someone wake me when it gets to 150s... ill buy then. 122 even better. Horribly run stores during these times and simply put, nobody is buying anything but ""trinkets"" to fix the sink, a few plants. Nobody is remodeling and contractors are nowhere to be found....... biggest bunch of incompetent idiots working in the stores too. I mean I like the guy at the paint dept when I go in for some rollers but management has no idea what they are doing these days. Sink it."
"Love HD, too bad we're not doing well to buy anything."
HD inching to 210$ hopefully w'll see it next week or 2KEYS crossing 50dma should see 90$ level next weekREEMF ATEC 2 tiny stocks have good trending
SEL SEL SEL THIS HORSE MANURE TRASH OF A COMPANY!!!
Better get out
I wish a monumental diarrhea on all shorters.
"Upgrade around the corner, hold on"
"**Devastating news for overpriced HOME DEPOT**""Housing market is ‘slowly running out of steam’""Yahoo Finance Video•December 26, 2018"
"Picked up some weekly puts on this name, I don’t see how we continue setting all times highs every day. A pullback to support seems only reasonable."
https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HD/home-depot/pe-ratio
cant believe this is staying above a 2% loss.
"Home Depot stock headed to $200 in the booming President Trump US economy, thanks President Trump."
Don't understand why HD wouldn't be making the come back that Lowe's is.
Market Realists are PAID BASHERS!!! Scam Artists on every site! They Are Paid !!!!
Is HD going to plummet or skyrocket when they report earnings next week?
Several analysts lowered target today with the lowest @210 and highest @250. Don't see any sell ratings and Jefferies suggested buying on the dip! Just has to play out I guess.
HD is overbought and RSI is at all time high. Stock will retrace back to $144 before buyers come in. Technical analysis is only we to go here. See you at $144.
Keep buying loser because Cramer told you
Betting on America is the equivalent on betting on a company that respects its workers and pays a 1.50 dividend to its shareholders. Keep driving the price down on this stock I will just buy more!
it is going to$200 then split city 3for1
"Hilarious. Maybe your hiring of billions and billions and billions of illegals is catching up to you. You mentally challenged Trumper mullets want to get rid of all illegals except the ones who work for The Depot. Obese white mullets who can't clean their own pool or mow their own lawn, but want to rid America of the Mexicans. I hope you bet it all at $209, losers."
Good stock.
"Does the scam even involve funds trading back and forth anymore, or is it just fake prints?"
"Boycott HD and all other Georgia-based companies. There have to be consequences for its government's decisions. If you don't make a stand, you could be the next one to lose your rights. Make a difference."
Pump and dump the hallmark of the  If it looks like a bear  Smells like a bear  Acts like a bear  Feels like a bear  Then you know the rest don’t you ?Pump and dump is the hallmark of the bear  Are you learning anything yet ?Or are you as dumb as the treasury secretary  from Goldman ?
"Ouch, looks like a while till we hit 300"
"what the heck, down 7.50 after hours"
"This stock is a sell on fundamentals. Fundamentally, the shelves are barren at three HDs I shop at so either the supply chain is disrupted, management is minimizing inventory build or they are intentionally creating supply shortages so they can conspire with the Feds mandate to let inflation run rampant. Either way this is now a major sell"
i bought 191..should i sell for loss?
dropping like to hell...
"Market sucked today, it’s been flat since the GOP took control."
hahahah.AIIah Akabar. HD iz support Trump. Jeff Bozos of Amazon iz support Hillary. AMZN soon wiII destroyed Home Depot an make Amrika a grate cuntree like lsIamik Republik of Pakistan..so Hillary suppoerturs iz win and Trump supporturs is loose....ahahahahahah...
"Folks, today is just a bad day all around. We just need to hold and keep collecting that dividend. The share buybacks coming later this year will help boost share price."
i have an options question. i have jan 2018 calls that are doing well. how close to the strike day do i hold the options if the stock continues to go up
good thing their on line sales are up there's no disputing their in store customer help is terrible.Then again it's no better at Lowes. Just saying.
New all-time @ 331+! Please do NOT split!!
long
I’m feeling completely unsuccessful !
Flaps down in our dissension downward
Good time to buy I guess nobody else is. So I will.
Hate this stock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can we see 172 today?
It’s down because margin requirements were hiked for HD. Wall Street way of taking candy from baby
hmmmmmmhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/3026aac3-08c5-3d20-bc8b-3711aaf5720f/sherwin-williams-shares-fall.html
5 MORE BUSINESS DAYS TILL EARNINGS!
Wake up the divi was raised from 4.12 to 5.44 per yr. Hardly a company struggling.
YES YES COME DOWN BABY YES YES
Construction companies should follow HD the uptrend...... Bird Construction is growing too..
"Cashed in my calls. May go a little higher,but this move is un natural and there is way more down side risk than upside potential"
"Why do HD stores have a wait line and Lowe’s do not, seems to not have a lot of logic must be run by Democrats"
HD did the same thing on July 20 when it sold off erratically on big volume then went on to recoup the 10 points lost. I believe it's one or two big hedge funds and history will repeat itself. HD just reported their best quarter in company history. It's the Prima Donna of retail. 50 sma is 152.43. Enjoy the ride back up!
Let them run it back up and sell the rip. Time has started to sell the rips. Home Depot is going to drop to under $152
I think we see a bounce today.
Any kind of a split would help stock go up .
"Friday will tell the tail, will see how HD holds up!"
"lumber, and most materials in most of products they sell continue to rise, HD continues to pass along costs well in advance of their hedges....could go another 15 to 20 % into earnings,, then the sizzle / steak idea comes into play for a bit"
add more to my core holding
"every stock.look at them all.big spikes.bagholders,get ready for the crash"
Why is the price dropping
if shares are repurchased can that lower company tax bill?
Traders will look for any reason to sell a stock. HD business has been holding up well against AMZN. A product that is sold by SHLD is now also going to sold by AMZN is a rational reason to sell HD. Really!
"Is it THE HOME DEPOT or is it HOME DEPOT? I noticed on all the stores now it say's ""THE HOME DEPOT"".. Waz up with that?Lowes stores don't say...""THE LOWES"".. No it just says .. :'Lowes'.. K-Mart stores didn't say... ""THE K-MART' SO could someone tell me the reasoning behind the new signs saying ""THE HOME DEPOT""?"
for a downgrade and the way the market is today looks pretty good to me will be buyingore at these levels.
"Looking like a good 3rd or 4th qtr short. The company reminds me of Federal bureacracy, bloated and stupid. Went to one Saturday and it was packed but the pitiful CS lost me after 3 hours of waiting. Lost a litlle time but kept 5 grand in my pocket so I want thank HD for there incompetence."
Earnings miss 2.08 vs 2.25 expected
if you want to be anti-American and a liberal Nut Job go Support Nike
This is an absolute dream to get HD at these prices!
Getting impatient with the SP. The way things are going HD will soon be a value stock....
Stores have been very busy ....... way over blown stock correction
"No one buys big ticket appliances online. They want to look and feel prior to buying. Design, color, sizing, questions etc.This is overblown and once they realize Market Makers are buying call options like there is no tomorrow."
"I own both HD and Low stocks although I originally bought 70% HD and 30% Low. Bought shortly after the lows of March.HDs low was 152 and has gained 88% to 286 while Low's ""low"" was 65 and has gained +160% more on its way to the current price of 170.People talk about Apple all day long, well Low has performed better than Apple since the lowest point in March.Truth is Low was and is still a lot smaller than HD so it can grow more. But careful with HD not being considered since the fundamentals are there and the earnings will once again be extraordinary. So the correction will happen and the price will correct itself upwards soon or later.My suggestion, buy both."
Just bought 10 put contracts with $160 strikes
"Ed you are seriously wrong. HD has positioned itself as a high IT company and its online side is sky rocketing. It's ridiculous you complain because they increase wages? Sorry, HD has values and if you don't want to invest in that, then don't. And look out for probably another record breaking earnings as we wait to see what black friday/etc did. This stock is very under valued right now."
I wish some one to tell Ford to be 100
Home Depot $195 ++++ this week
HD at the top of gainers in my 50 stock port on a down day.. not too shabby..
A good company just don’t fight the FED. Let it go till interest rates peak.
Let's Go Orange! Gotta love HD!! Long n Strong since 1993. Retirement @ $400!
"HD stores has always been busy before these Hurricane and will continue to be busier after these Hurricane. Imagine that. Go Figure! If it breaks Friday's high, lookout!, strength and momentum will take it a lot higher! Strength and Momentum baby!"
Slow rise back after stupid analysis ( 55% record) trashed HD.
if you want to be part of something support Bernie Marcus and the Home Depot foundation's this is true Americans
why would any democrat shop at home depot... insulting 1/2 your base and all of your workers isnt going to help their bottom line... stock is going to sink... unless the #$%$ is buying
I wonder how the shorts are doing?
time to load up folks
"HD is exceptional in its response with customer satisfaction......It's marriage with RYOBI is becoming detrimental to its mission in that customer satisfaction. HD has dumped millions of RYOBI battery equipment and tools that simply fleece the HD customers with $100 failed batteries and chargers with both downtime expenses and failure after failure of ""defectively engineered battery systems"" and it appears to be an after purchase RYOBI Gold Mine. HD needs to threaten RYOBI to either honor a 24hr turnaround replacement on this dilemma that really should be taken up as a class action suit in the interest of the consumer. An example : Even the battery stock found on the HD shelves have reached such a charge rate of nearly 0 that they too reflect ""Defective"" when attempting to be charged, leading to another loss of $100 and travel and down time on the greedy RYOBI fleecing. Reviews initially reflect happy customers..... but they all later return disgruntled with the failed battery rate and the anguish of purchasing battery after battery with the same results. Time to ditch RYOBI by the trusted Home Depot before it begins to reflect on the bottom line. JLG"
"OMG, this board is WAY too bullish, i'm shorting."
"i left home depot 2 weeks ago , i am semi retired but might go back part time next year. all i can tell you is our sales were really good this half we have two for the year. this company is very healthy in my opinion . the shares they bought back several billion is another strong thing for this company. gl longs"
Stock market has gone up $10000 points since Trump took over from that last mess that was running things....crack pot Susan wants the dems to win the election just so she can start shorting the market.....what a creepy girl...
Well...I think we can let go of Waters. Unless you're curious as to his Zulu time posts. I suspect a name change. Can't get rid of these rats.
"All the news is good for hd for a few weeks , don't understand why it will not move up"
"Back to 200 a share. The company has strong pro sales, and specialty departments are making housing upgrades smoother and complete. The buyback helped employees moral boost as well. Need to do that again!"
Market is crazy right now up is down and down is up. It will turn for the upside . Remember its only a paper loss unless you sell...
Going for a new high...cover your shorts
Why are there always H 2 0 backs loitering around in Home Depot parking lots?
The ceo should have known that lowered guidance would not have gone over well. Tsk tsk
Think will close GREEN. At least in the after hours.
Charts setting up for a reversal down. Lock them profits in kids.
Never had a doubt
Expect div in 1.18 - 1.22 range
"Some one was questioning about my crystal ball about a month ago. For that person, do you have any other questions."
HD is up 4.92% to 228.55
"Why is Lowes down #$%$ today and Home Depot is up +$1.30? The reason why is that Home Depot keeps reinvesting in itself by improving the quality and efficiency of its stores, Plain and Simple."
relax folks it isn't the first time HD reports and it drops 5%.
this has a lot of retracement to go..
Bitcoin looking good today and moving.
Free money. Buying this dip. Thank you HD
What will HD and KO do about about that massive voter suppression in their home state? How can I buy their products much less invest in their companies with this atrocity going on?
short is looking good should last for a few weeks.Cover for 15 and ride it back up after the market settles and the fed gives everyone a million dollars.
Trump just slapped the middle class again with more tariffs.
HD is down 12.02% to 180.95

This stock just go down every day. Can not believe we are trading below $268. Market up again. I think it is crazy that the stock is down almost $25 from the highs. The stock has done very poorly since the announcement of higher compensation for associates. Maybe we need a bigger buyback and a dividend increase for shareholders. It seems the company forgot about shareholders and focus on employees and really hurt the owners of the company.
Looks as though the money mangers and ETF’s got all the full benefits of the buyback
overpriced
great gains since lows
employees wage increase made all this mess
"HD, please do a split kit apple so I can buy more share."
Will be back up dow is down
Why is The Home Oh Depot up today? Did they hire a new batch of illegals?
https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/15/is-home-depot-stock-a-buy.aspxIs HD a buy? Yes.
Never wrong to take a profit in a non tax account - think I will take some of the table and wait for a pull back. If the pull back doesn't happen Shame on me.
"give it some time, use your own judgement on how you react to earnings beat, revenue beat, raised guidance.Be patient and most of all, these boards are made up of shorties."
"3:1 stock split coming along with record beats along all metrics. Stock will run to $300+. Managers at the Brewster, NY store and Danbury, CT store both said they have never seen the store(s) this busy from open to close. Long term stock holder!"
"HD has a cup with handle pattern, which traders see as bullish"
wow what a #$%$ today and Friday.
HD shorts about to get squeezed
Rising rates bad for HD...sell before it hits 200.
All the good news is out. Time to tank!!!
"It amazes me that HD has dropped in price today after a superb earnings report before the opening bell. $3.05 eps and $30.46B in sales for the quarter ending 7/31, compared to analyst's expectations of $2.84 and $30B and a $2.25 eps for the same quarter last year. HD upped it's earnings estimates for the fiscal year (ending 1/31/19) to $9.42. The TRAILING annual earnings now are $8.66 giving HD a P/E of 22.3, about 10% less than the S&P 500 avg despite a greater than avg. growth rate and 2.1% div.I have a schedule for investments in 2019 and HD is on it, but I'm considering tightening my belt for a while and advancing that investment to now.I first bought HD last year @ $153.11 when I saw the housing market recovery picking up. From my personal experiences in the stores, I planned to buy Lowe's instead of Home Depot. But after a lot of research, I saw that Home Depot, the much larger chain, had durable competitive advantages in long-term contracts with builders and with the unique ability to ship very large pre-fab and other items. Lowe's increases its earnings almost entirely by building new stores. Home Depot does it by increasing same store sales more than new stores and same store sales increased over 8% over the last year.I plan to hold HD for decades if it holds on to those advantages."
"HD is an example of an exceptionally well run company. great growth, great margins, few big issues. Long past the whacked out Bob Nardelli days. (voted worst CEO in U.S.) last three years has been a stellar performer.. A QUALITY holding."
RSI>70
When will Home Depot announce ????We already have MULTIPLE $HD sites using $PLUG equipment
Lowe's will most likely bring hd down tomorrow. I'll be adding more on the dip. Look for 85- 83
One of the best balance sheets and companies out there.. we can try to pick at bottom but even at this price-155- its a steal- and you can sleep at night.
"HD driven down by traders who knew HD would report a blow out quarter. So, big rush today up and away."
"A good time to start shorting the stock!During covid-19, HD was barely able to keep inventory in stock.As a former retail executive, I like to perform store visits and see first hand the fundamental core operations at work. I believe HD is expecting a slow down, as their support staff has been diminished.For the past year, HD could hide flaws and blame the pandemic (as long as they remained better than their competition). Now, their competition is improving; while HD is retracting services.If you want to see a perfect example, the BOT customer service may field extremely basic questions; it is only frustrating their customer base. Try to reach a human support on the phone - they insist you request a HD text to field basic questions (like the BOT) and promise to have someone call - but no call.Try calling to purchase product and hold product for pick-up (only offered for PRO service); HD tells you to order on line (and wait for a few days). Even with Self Check-out, lines to collect payment (albeit shorter due to fewer customer). I watched several customers walk out and not purchase items in their carts.Too many issues and no follow-up. Short this HD Stock."
10% jump after the earning call ! Let’s go 
Second James is not first James.
"In 2020 the hyped up speculative plays added 1 trillion to Mkt value. Only 10% of those could retain sky high valuations! So with 900 billion coming off of those, 5 trillion that is coming in from sidelines and 1 trillion stimulus, money will flow in to real winners! Companies like HD, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AMD, VRTX,PFE,ACAD,WMT, would gain bigger piece of the Pie!"
Effing POS
"I bought HD in 1983 for my wife and me, her IRA, my IRA and my profit sharing plan. Stock splits and DRIP make me immune to day to day fluctuations. It is still the 800# gorilla in the room"
"OMG, this is hilarious. What would HD do without illegals and hurricanes. Just a silly hammer store."
"The losers in the flooring department hate working for The Hoe Moe Depot.Endless complaints, long hours, no training, no back end support, no nothing.They beg me to come work at my company and I say, no way. You are the product of terrible upbringing. You have no knowledge, no experience, no real talent. Yeah, yougot EFFFED by The Depot, but that was your choice. You are now damaged loserswith no experience, and nothing to offer the population."
I think HD moves up along with LOW.
Good Company But stock is too rich . EPS 6.31 * 20 PE = 126. fair value EPS 6.31 * 17 PE = 107. Stock is too expensive even with some growth
COME DOWN BABY GO DOWN SHORTING MORE
"Bottom line is 1/3 of America has no savings and no job. Credit card leverage only goes so far. Yes, a boom during April...bored folks painting rooms and now landscaping...but that is short term. HD, the overall market and our fraudulent administration in for a rough year."
up. All home depots.its hard to find a parking spot.this stock won't go down
outstanding gains today
"don't know how HD can fill up all the shelf space without all the products that are under 300% tariffs on Trump's list. even so, how much higher would the price tags be? but with $29 B debts that HD us carrying on the rising interest rates, it's gonna be a problems for its earnings in the coming quarters."
"Like I said, Trump already told his buddies about Iran. They're out and he doesn't care. He already had a historic year under his belt and a phase 1 deal with china. Using the war will guarantee election because people are psychologically controlled to vote for a war time president. No war time president has ever lost. Good thing I bought puts and literally told everyone here to and no one listened. this is going to the ground."
Lower rates helps home depot. Not that it needs it! Best of breed.
Why does HD carry such an incredible amount of debt?
we had a good day
"HD will announce something similar to Lowe’s, relax everyone...don’t u guys know this is a copycat world. I’m not worried, we will see $300.00 by year end"
Will this stock rise in the near future?
It seems for the last few months HD is just following the Dow. If the Dow moves up some HD follows. If the Dow moves down HD follows it down.HD had a great run at the end of 2017. I am not sure if we will see another run like that for a while. I have have HD stock since the late 80s. I still have every stock that I purchased in those years. I reinvest the dividends
"Looks like the ride is coming to an end:""Housing starts slumped in September, slowing to an annualized pace of 1.201 million new projects.

Lol greed cost you boy’s! I sold at perfect time
MM driving it down to buy earnings ?
Finally some good profits shorting this garbage
I'm sure there's some concern that the fantastic numbers they reported are unsustainable.
housing crash next ... how HD?
Bernie Marcus the true American his foundation donates billions and billions of dollars money that helps veterans and all type of illnesses a true American and American company Home Depot just because he backs President Trump the left the Democrats the angry mobs want to boycott Home Depot when this man has not even been part of Home Depot for 15 years is plain anti-American sickness
"HD… Management just disclosed their registration with Federal Trade Commission of 16+ million shares of tender offering this afternoon, aggregate amount approximately a little over $2.3 billion. I am thinking management is very optimistic to close the Home Depot Supplies acquisition by the end of January 31st 2021. The HD balance sheet is solid with $13+ cash. Super long HD with juicy dividend. just added more to my position"
Big Joe is up over $60 per put contract since the call this morning and up massive on short interest. Thank you all for paying Big Joe so nicely! Enjoy your day.
We have caught a bottom after good earnings ! Under 173!!!! How many investors can say that? Not many?
I'd strongly advise taking some off the table here as this is extremely frothy. Priced for perfection going into earnings! Just sayin!
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370419-still-holding-home-depot-after-run
HD Supply deal had already closed before year ended and now the management is working on offering a 3 tranche notes financing.
Get out now(Home Depot and Lowes) before rising interest rates cut these guys in half.
Huge buying opportunity right here. Load up 300 is coming soon.
looks like this article may have spooked folks - good day in the market - taking some profits off the table and waiting for fed.

I Remember when Fake News CNN - MSNBC- NBC- ABC- CBS- NYT- Washington Post all said this about President Trump the past 2+ years. 1. Trump would never be elected.2. They said if Trump was elected the stock market would crash.3. They said Trump would be impeached within the first three months of his presidency. 4. They said he would be impeached after Mueller found Russian collusion. And they wonder why President Trump and smart people call them Fake News now. You all lie to us daily or spin the real facts. Shame on all of you. Sorry if truth hurts but you earned the title as Fake News. $NYT $BA $HD $GE $CSCO $K $GM $F

Can HD correct sure all stocks do!! but at what pps? Bottom line is you pay a slight premium for a best of breed duoply stock in which you can sleep at night. because earnings are fairly predictable. Amazon is no threat to HD plus it is an American stock icon. I read from the initial ipo early investors made 10's of thousands percentage gains. Why because the business model works. Trump like the Company and he will be imo re-elected. So yes we can correct but long-term the pps imo will surely be higher. Netflix telsa are stocks you should imo short or the very high pe stocks which HD IS NOT!!
"Buying today's dip should be a no brainer to anyone who thoroughly examined the quarter. That same store sales number was incredible. What's not to like here? Plus this is a COVID proof stock and even without COVID will do well. HD and LOW are consistent winners, and that's not about to change anytime soon."
No $178 price hit today. Yeah baby!! It's going back down after only hitting a high of $177.99!! Ha!!

outstanding day
"Great price movements. It could end badly, but it appears HD will continue to run its course here."
Looking forward to how many shares I will get this dividend.
...just wait until earnings..We'll rebound...just out of favor for the short term...
InvestorPlace was right on it . Barron’s was quite the opposite
"Wow, California fire situation, hurricanes and other various forms of destruction that happened or is happening. Everybody is running to home depot. The sales, it's going to be HUGE."

HD= THE HAMPTONS BBBY =THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE!!!
"People acting like this thing is down 8% lol. People telling other they were wrong on a stock and they are losing their entire bank account when it is down 1% when they crushed earnings. Its comical. Wait until the upgrades come in from the ""Experts""....."
Solid company......great opportunity to get in
"Funny how people react to anything Amazon touches. Sears may actually sell more appliances this way, but not leaps and bounds better. Online is not a popular way to buy this kind of item. It's a major purchase for most people, and look and feel matter. Sears doesn't manufacture their own product, so there's little opportunity to differentiate. Whirlpool stock went down on this news, as well, even though they are the manufacturer of many Sears appliances."
How many longs held through the drop to the $150’s
HD reached a new All Time High at 203.35
Huge beat 195 close
Doesn’t look like will be getting to 250 this year!!

"Housing will come to a grinding halt. Higher taxes on everyone, including the Middle Class. Higher energy and material costs. china won."
"It is truly disturbing how Red White and Blue Trumpers will go to the mat to support The Home Depot, all the while knowing that this company openly and brazenly uses illegals to install its products.All you have in this life is your word and your ethics. It really doesn't matter much the amount of fiat currency that you have stashed away when you inevitably perish.Trumper below lashed out at me for using, ""denigrating, hate filled,"" terms to describe this company. Well, sometimes it takes shocking ideas to awake the complacent, ""investors,"" out of their reverie.Aforementioned Trumper no doubt attended several classes in ethics and morality during his pursuit of a military officers' commission. Apparently, none of it stuck."
Looking for opinions on whether the dividend will likely get cut due to this?
Clowns sell the issue $10+ in one random day and then it hardly moves on option expiration day? Are you investors or just gamblers?
Stock hit a high on October 21 (238.99) so a little selloff before earnings release is not unusual. If the company delivers $250 by eoy would be easily feasible.
Splits alow small fry to invest in great stocks. spreads the wealth in the best way possible...ownership!
We had a big seller yesterday unloading a sizable position. Hopefully he is gone and we can start a uptrend again
Housing start hit 12 year high. HD is going to 250.
"A new Kohler toilet for 169 bucks plus tax??The Wifey finally put her foot down and said she was going to call a plumber to put a new one in. The guy wanted 600 bucks to put one in.....YIKES!!!!.....so i finally went to HD and picked one up. About 30 minutes later it worked SWEET. Sometimes you just have to take orders. It's not easy and you certainly don't do it all the time, but Life is much more pleasant when you do...."
It will be a quick bounce back. Everyone is just taking their profit first from what happened yesterday. Earnings coming out and it will be up up and away.
HD bull run is over
"This was $310 this morning. Oddball move up since the Magical ""10 am"" Hour, shot straight up on short covering Algo. I would wait for a pullback to $275"
Just a reminder that tomorrow is the Ex-Dividend Date - so you must buy today to receive the $1.50 quarterly dividend that's payable on Dec 17.
October smackdown of HD was WAY overdonelots of building going on across the US --- Houston is STILL recovering from harvey and Ca is just getting around to replacing all the homes from the fires + a ton of new work on the Fla Gulf coast --- interest rates are a bargain today compared to a year or two out as the economy continues to grow
HD is way undervalued!
time to trim on bad rail earnings?
What just happened?
been a weird week for this stock
"Good solid companies are really getting pounded; not buying yet as the MSM fear mongering continued drama continues! But to those investors with cash and a willingness to buy fundamentally solid companies will be rewarded a year or less from now. Right now we have mindless (algo driven) selling into a vacuum BUT sooner or later the vacuum bag will be filled up with dirt cheap, rock bottom priced companies!!!!"
HD does it again amazing strong company
Huge buying opportunity!!!
Just got a nice tip from (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)

"HD is getting punished for giving its workers a raise, same effect happened to other companies who have done the same. I see this as a positive since it builds trust and loyalty with store personnel who interact directly with customers. HD’s earnings report crushed sales and profit estimates – great opportunity to take advantage of the street’s overreaction!"

Split has to be voted on.
Home Depot is going to get slaughtered when next quarter numbers are revealed. Ordering things for in-store pickup is a joke .... takes 2 days to put together a simple order. People are going elsewhere. If HD does not increase staffing and turn orders around they are going to have a beyond brutal quarter.
Premarket volume is light. No worry.
Short this till 200$ easy money
it
Come on 250
"Two month wait time for carpet installations in Denver. No, it's not an increase in business. It's what happens when you pay people practically nothing to perform a complex job. Nice going, Hoe Moe. You destroyed the labor pricing and now it's coming back to haunt you. I guess from here on out, customers get even worse service. Shortage of installers is so bad in Denver that some stores are cutting way back on how much carpet they sell."

thinking way oversold. 8 percent selloff based on strong earnings in perpetual business that will only continue to grow over time. we should be back around 232-235 in no time
they just said on TV that this is the time to buy
"Home Depot has the worst delivery and installation service on the planet. I've bought and ordered doors, water heaters, washing machines and had to cancel and get refunds for all of it because of incompetence and unresponsiveness. Don't see how anyone puts up with it."
Express delivery. This is and will be a huge addition to the bottom line along with keeping the competition in the rear view mirror. One of the biggest issues and money/time losers on a job site is when the contractor has to leave the site to pick up materials. Lets say HD is 15 minutes away and your spend 1/2 hour in the HD (and that never happens) and then 15 minutes back. That's a minimum of 1 hour away from the jobsite and the above example is super conservative. If HD can capture a small % of that business it could be a game changer for the bottom line!
yo...this performance during record QE to infinity. oh dear.
"The market, in general, is crashing pretty hard at the moment."
"Against better judgment, I sent one of my sons to The Depot to get some tile for a bathroom we are finishing.Having owned a flooring store for twenty years, I know that this is like throwing a pot roast to a lion.We don't install tile or stock tile because it is a nasty, thankless business. However, if you are going to selltile, at least have a smattering of knowledge about it.Kid gets there and asks a simple question. Can I please have 84 tiles from the same dye lot.One associate is clueless and tells us that. The other is on the phone. Endlessly. On the phone, on thephone, on the phone, on the phone.I tell my son to just grab four boxes of the tile and we will figure it out, but can someone please tell uswhere the epoxy grout is.The clueless guy shrugs his shoulders and the guy who is always on the phone brings my son to thegrout section and points to an area where there is no epoxy grout.OMG, it goes on and on and on and on and on. Finally, I tell my son to just leave the tile and come home.It's not as if I asked a baseball player or a librarian for help. We asked the Home Depot flooringdepartment manager for help and after about two hours got nothing other than a bunch of blow-offs,shoulder shrugging, etc.All I wanted was some tile from the same dye lot and some epoxy grout. How the F does this boat fullof morons stay in business."

"Did you listen to Bill when this terd was near $210 and he was soft selling the hurricane (slash) wildfire issues (OMG, we are so, so, so, so sorry, but thank Jeeezus it will result in yuge yuge yuge returns,) and all those crocodile tears about The Home Depot not gouging customers on things like sheet rock and plywood in the middle of a nation crisis (BTW, it's illegal to do so, so all The Home Depot did was follow the law, hat's off) and now this thing is down $25 bucks a share and there's plenty of blame to go around. HD longs will overlook the fact that pencil-necked, former CEO insulted half the population and instead try to pin it on liberals, (whatever that means ....) and The Kneee Grow, Obama, who is probably sitting at home having a well-deserved glass of Cabernet. Thanks for muting me, Bill. Arguing with you is like playing chess against a chicken. You know you are going to win, but the intermediate, crazy moves are a waste of valuable time."

"The shortage of affordable housing as a boon for Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Sherwin Williams. The problem will be solved in the coming years, starting with the incoming infrastructure plan. Demand for housing far exceeds supply right now. The coming boom in home construction will skyrocket demand for these 3 companies’ products. In addition to that due to their low betas these companies are well insulated from the effects of rising rates. The future is incredibly bright for homebuilding and home improvement."

Thanks for the dividend HD. Show me the money!
Common sense if HD can increase its dividend 32% in a weak quarter.
"i thought this was interestingi, you may recall HD reported 3.7% same store sales but below WS est of 4.3%.

Comparable sales increased 1.7% for the quarter, vs. analyst estimates of a 2% increase.Lowe's ( LOW) ) said it expects fiscal 2019 EPS in the range of $6.00 to $6.10, in line with the Street estimate of $6.04.

The customer had the mm setup, so we changed them out to a regular torsion spring change. He had two bids. One for 400 bucks and the other for 500 bucks. The 2nd rip off artist was going to change out the small broken spring on one side, which makes no sense because the other spring would have broken soon after. That rip-off pri.. wanted 500 bucks.A friend of the customer gave him our name and we took out that goofy setup and put in two torsion springs and everything that went with it for 200 bucks.People that scr.. people are going to get scre... in the end.No doubt about it...."

Moving quickly off the lows
I guess we will have to wait until @ Feb 23 to find out about the dividend increase an additional buy back. It is going to be a rough 6 weeks while we wait and the trend is down due Mgmt mistakes. Hard to understand the constant buying and selling of HD Supply or hiking wages during a high unemployment environment. Anyhow as a result of these actions the stock has moved from $290 to around $265. Very sad for shareholders.
POTN buy buy buy..
I buy pile of HD today... HD is great long term company. period..... always has been.

"Got another example yesterday of corruption in our government, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, It just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens. Why hasn't the Press called this out?FYI, the reason Hillary wants open borders is that aliens typically vote Democratic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PK-SK0h9o"

"I measured a house in south Denver today. The lady is 90 years old. Her husband passed. She needs to move.The Home Depot put in a bid for $4000 for uninteresting, polyester carpet. 107 square yards.Preying on the weak. We will put in a nice 40 oz nylon for $2500.Disgusting. Absolutely pathetic to rip off the elderly. Especially since it won't be installed correctly and if anything goes wrong, the customer is screwed. They will be forced to pay up front and will be given the runaround for exactly one year until the warranty expires. This is how The Depot does business. It does not mess around. It rips you off up front and at the back end, also.A complete, cradle to grave ripoff."

"I love HD and have owned the stock for some time. But hope they fix some of their supply and stocking issues. Also problem with lumber. I understand that lumber is expensive with all the demand right now, but I'm tired of picking thru banana shaped 2x4's to find wood suitable to build shelves...."
hurricane will increase demand
"There was an article about Costco recently and mentioned that they had high security in stores in the way of cameras, watchdog employees and checkpoints at the doors. Why doesn’t HD do this if theft is the problem for lowering profits? Seems like an easy fix."
this is a mess....
"If you are a true LONG in The Home Oh Depot, you must admit that you support the relentless, brazen use of illegals and the shameless purchasing of imported, Chinese Junk.I will not judge you if you admit that, ""you shamelessly support the use of obviously illegal aliens to install products,"" and, that you wantonly support, ""buying anything and everything from China if it saves the company even one billionth of a penny.""If you are an honest person, you know these things to be true. If you are a Home Oh Depot Long, you blame all of this on Obama and dream about your next boat, regardless of the damage it does to America. Mark it, cowards."
I like building materials supplier CWX.TO. It is much cheaper at 12 times P/E than HD and Lowe. Q1 result EBDIT rose over 200 percent comparing to last year.
Lots of dreamer in HD stocks right now.
It is not correct.
"BlackRock , Vanguard and others plus insiders are hard at work"
"Again, my feeling is that its gearing up for a split around earnings,at which time the pps will be closer to $400"
"tropical storm in Gulf, soon to be upgraded to Hurricane. Oil and Hardware stocks are getting a big bump today and for the week."
market sell off is to sway mid terms to help the socialists.
Is this going to keep going down even after the ER?
HD is in a win win situation housing market strong HD. people staying home more remodeling again HD.
"Interesting that the hurricane season will boost HD sales, and yet the stock is getting downward pressure."
The giant is waking spring is here. Glad I got in a couple of weeks ago with earnings around the corner let see if we can get to 200 next week.
not worried will come back and go. looking for continued growth this is just a pause
I’m pretty bearish on this earning and the 225 P 2/28 looks like a good deal. What do you guys think
"Told you Wall Streets rich clients were selling and for you to SELL, SELL,SELL LOL,LOL,LOL that's what makes me the greatest of all time. LOL,LOL,LOL reading the real street signs. Just wait HD is going to get slaughtered . Down $20, Then down $50 then down $100 and Wall Street will tell you to sell LOL,LOL So their rich clients can buy LOL,LOL,LOL"
Looks like 2018 is going to be a choppy ride in the market
When will the split This stock? Looking for 3/1 or 4/1..
Don't support your local Home depot
Up 1%? Give me a break
I'm out! I am tired of buying inferior Chinese #$%$ from someone who supports Lyin' Donnie. MAGA my #$%$ Money over country.
spring is here most at home with lots on their to do list
"Where is @bullfight2020? You had such a big mouth earlier. Got pretty quiet now, huh, genius? Where is the stock now? Lmfao. I told you, you should aim trade until you understand how the market works before you lose what little money you have...punk! "
You can load a truck today for 20% upside in six months.HD ER is outstanding: both top line and bottom line are worthy much higher stock prices.
WTH happened today
"AMZN will enter HD business soon,.. anything AMZN in will be destroyed...."
Home Depot is up 4.93% to 220.84
Gonna test $191 again. Any down market is gonna drag this stock down quickly
215 by the end of the year.. eat that
185 should be a good buy point
"BTW take away all the illegals and Home Depot sales fall by 30%, where do you think the materials the illegals are using to fix your house come from?"
HD full speed ahead!!!
"Has it been 18 years since the last stock split? I am new to this, but why not to get penny-ante ds's like me in?"
"no buildings, no construction. no innovation earnng may fall big"
I bought 20 270 8/21 puts. This price is way too high. See you guys in the morning
HD ever going to see above $199 again ? IF so when ?
hey we are still up over 60+ per share in the last 6 months no worries we will come back
If u look at my posts last week ud see I was telling everyone about the charts and that HD would pop back up to 280 area. Happy to see that it’s making it’s way back up.
"Home Depot should be sued for stealing from their customers!Bought a quart of Polyurethane and noticed a $.35 charge for ""recycling fee"".But I brought them nothing for them to recycle for me. The empty can will go to my local trash facility and Home depot don't pay them for my disposal. I pay my town and they pay the facility where it is handled from there. Home Depot stole my money."
I hope management is buying back stock hand over fist.
Aren't we due for a dividend hike?
HD and building materials like CWX.TO can continue to grow very well.
Some stocks I buy on technical research and some I buy because of what I see. Home Depot is always crazy busy. Rain or shine. scamdemic or booming economy. It is just selling product like crazy. I am long on this stock
Talked with my brother-in-law last night who took a part time job at HD 3 weeks ago after retiring from CAT. He told me his store has done over $1M every week since March 1st here in Jacksonville. This might be the smallest store in the city here too!!
Drop to $200 by October?
This stock isn’t going anywhere too soon. Three steps forward two back.
10/1/19 ALL TIME HIGH!
ULTA now valued higherHD should be ashamed
La-Z-Boy Incorporated (LZB) 25.35 -5.95 (-19.01%)

Should be seeing a stock split soon
shorts covering?
esus F9023490HG CRHIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY THE MASSIVE DROP SINCE THE OPEN??????????????????
"The bots are running the show today, good time to buy the pullback, similar to what happened to NVDA..."
Sell sell sell!
"listen all...long time investor here HOWEVER short time day trader and HD is in fact a huge buy,However us daytraders and ""Robinhood"" account holders are totally manipulating ALL STOCKS and its unfortunate that you real deal long term ""investors"" have to suffer...However 1 thing is infact true....there is a BOAT LOAD of money to be made in this volatile market.So guys please just go with the flow...If u cant beat them JOIN THEM"
The entire South East has to be rebuilt. That will support HD next 2 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2F8QuANsME. only 4$
"up >30% in < 8 months since first buy, plus 3 divs and another coming soon. That's a ~42%APG..not too shabby at all!.."
ha! we are going to 240$ today. this orange menace is unstoppable!
way over bought swan dive coming soon....
this is BS...it should be sky rocketing right now.
 <--My Dad (He's a tough dude!)
I see JP Morgan is tanking after being up big and Goldman Sachs is down big !this indicates those in the know getting out of this bubble market..Most of Trumps Cabinet members are from Goldman so is it wise to go against what they are doing ?Do you think you know more than them and should remain in this bubble market or should you lock in fabulous gains while there is still someone out there to buy your overpriced shares ?
wonder if the analysts friends sold short in last few days. hummmm.
"As per Jim Cramer: ""Jim Cramer: I Think Home Depot Is Uniquely 'Non-Amazonable'""."
what is the reason some posters bash the stock?
"B OYCOTTING AMAZON, yet? Then keep on losing on HD, because you are part of the problem."
"All I can say is the stores are packed ahead of the winter storm about to hit East Coast! Totally out of snow shovels, etc. Big win-win for HD. Buying today!"
My two worse performing stocks in my portfolio are Home Depot and Amazon! Baffling isn't it?
Bank of America raised its PT to $360
"Boom sold in premarket for $198, I will buy back around $190 on Friday"
5-10% rally after earnings.
"Strong support zone at 191.83. I am holding my shares and a few calls. As long as it holds the support next few days, we’d be solid. I’m still surprised how ER is strong and they announced shares buyback yet the price is still down."
GNPX my other winner.
Historically HD has done well around thanksgiving. let's see if it holds up!
I don't know where the stock is going but if it goes below $250 I'm going to back up the truck.
KHC another stock that R pumps!!!! what will be down more today HD or KHC? LMAO
Guaranteed by year end lower then 140
ITT: A lot of people that don't know very much about stocks and own 2 shares of HD but want to own 4.
"Just dumped my position in HD!! I did not like the Vicious out of the Blue correction in the stock the prior 2 days after just receiving a big upgrade!! Could be shenanigans associated with options expiration, but did not like the big gap down yesterday on higher volume!! Plenty of time to rebuy if Market corrects 10-15%."
At this rate the dividend will double in 3yrs or less.
208ish before shorts take over
How many stores will be closed within 6 - 12 months? There is no vaccine anytime soon and the infection rate is doubling every 10 - 14 days. This is going to be painful for a very long time as people will not resume anything close to normal life again for at least 10 years or longer.
Yesterday I went by HD. I observed that the aisle where they have dust masks was empty. The associate said they were sold out because of the virus feats. I am not sure the dust masks will protect against virus. any opinions Thor thoughts?
"So, you HD longs have supported hiring illegals to install flooring for decades. Any idea how long you can keep this smokescreen going? Oh, don't bother with the waah factor. I run into the Julios and Juans every day. It's all illegal all the time. How long can you keep it up?"
"Thank You!!!! I have been waiting to get in with HD!!! I put on an initial buy today, and will wait and Hope to get in lower in a few days."
Why would anyone buy this stock after revelations the founder is a huge Trump supporter?
"I love HD but here's some constructive criticism. Let's hope that employee raises translate into better service and a better stock price. How about adding back more 'on the floor' employees and training them better? I regularly get questions from frustrated customers while in the store....When you do get help it seems there are too many employees that know less about their products and DIY stuff than I do. I lie to the checkout cashiers when asked ""Did you find everything?"" because I don't think they really care that much and I don't want to turn my checkout into a gripe session. With all that, I'm still long...."
So how do the homebuilders do well and have good numbers yet HD have bad numbers and HD has the bonus of hurrricane rebuilding
Home Depot will miss tomorrow they are losing market share to Lowe’s sorry to burst your bubbles..lol
I just added a few shares. I am a holder of HD for 10+ years. love it.
"I'm up >20% in < 4 months since buy, plus two divs. Not too shabby.. works for me!"
HD is getting hammered everyday!
Until the election results are corrected the market will continue to slide. The people are speaking up and had enough!
Time to SELL HD
Love HD but this has gone straight up since $250. It almost has to pull back from here right lol
"HD needs to get in the game....they need distribution centers. When I go to order something on line from HD it takes about ten days to get to the store or my house. I go to Amazon for the same item and I get it on my front porch the next day. HD is a loser company other than it's big box. IT COULD MAKE SO MUCH MORE !!!!!! Get a new board! Guess where I order my goods??? BTW, both TGT and WMT figured it out and is giving AMZN a run."
this is so overbought it's hilarious people can't pay there mortgage but longs think sales are crazy hahahaha look at the pro desk next time you go it's empty hd makes there money of contractor's not grandma buying a can of spray paint
All our utilities are up. We have to cut back.. No flowers this spring from HD...
"If HD was considered a STRONG BUY before this catastrophic disaster, it is definately more so now. Amazon has nothing on HD, especially now. Think they will have a postal truck deliver 2×4s and plywood to your door in an hour? not likely."
"They are on the verge of a class action for bogus delivery dates for items sold on their website. Literally tens of thousands of misleading ""have it tomorrow"" claims when it is clear that such is impossible. HD is trying to be an Amazon with its ""one company"" unfortunately its only talk from the top. Time to sell."
"loving the feel of the trade and consistent vol today, options ratios and OI are supportive and sustainable...and here are yet more reasons to be in HD...They take care of their own.https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/17/heres-the-defining-characteristic-of-home-depots-s.aspx"
"This is from last year, but relevant to the tariff threat increase this week:Home Depot, the state’s largest company, expects the current round of tariffs to add nearly $300 million to the cost of what it sells, but views the amount as “manageable.”In an interview after the Atlanta-based company announced a surprisingly robust set of results for the most recent quarter, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said the company remains uncertain about the ultimate impact of the tariff battle begun by the Trump administration in recent months.“There’s a lot of the tariff talk that we don’t understand yet,” she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an interview.However, the tariffs imposed thus far are raising the costs of items the company sells, from laundry machines to anything containing steel or aluminum.“But tariffs will add less than $300 million to the sales of those things,” Tome said. “Out of $100 billion in sales, so that is a manageable number.”Home Depot, the state’s largest company, expects the current round of tariffs to add nearly $300 million to the cost of what it sells, but views the amount as “manageable.”In an interview after the Atlanta-based company announced a surprisingly robust set of results for the most recent quarter, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said the company remains uncertain about the ultimate impact of the tariff battle begun by the Trump administration in recent months.“There’s a lot of the tariff talk that we don’t understand yet,” she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an interview.However, the tariffs imposed thus far are raising the costs of items the company sells, from laundry machines to anything containing steel or aluminum.“But tariffs will add less than $300 million to the sales of those things,” Tome said. “Out of $100 billion in sales, so that is a manageable number.”"
"If we had a HD across the road from Lowe's, Lowes would go out of business...Believe it!"
notes on taking profits coming. watch...
What reason for the lack of upward pop today?
CHECKOUT BOARD DUNCE R POSTS WHERE HE SAID 100 TIMES HE SOLD EVERYTHING AND WENT TO CASH!! HE MISSED A 23% MOVE IN BBBY!!!!!!! HD TO 250 BEST OF BREED.
By my math I say we hit around 215 years end.
Wow Lowes really closing in on Home Depot.￼
I'm a carpenter.....definitely not slowing down. tons of union work going on.
LOL HD STOCK PPS WILL STABLIZE SOON IMO. STOCK JUST HIT ALL TIME HIGHS. THIS IS A MINOR CORRECTION. EXPECTING AT LEAST A 10% DIVIDEND INCREASE GOING FORWARD. LOWES WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER HD PERIOD. LIKE SAYING YOU WILL BUY MORE PEPSI THEN COKE.
Looks like $205 next
"Why do you clear posts that are a) from shareholders b) well within the guidelines and are c) truthful?Here it is again...A relative bought a lawn tractor at the Gainesville, GA the other day. It was brand new for $2600. They delivered a used floor model that still had the floor model sign and the sale price of $1400 on it. The delivery guys could have cared less when it wouldn’t start because the battery was dead. Local management was impossible to reach by phone. Corporate could have cared less. They gave him a $300 store gift card.The GA Attorney General’s office of Consumer Protection opens Monday. I’m sure their specialists will find this one interesting. Craig, you need to personally resolve this one and fast.Anyone have the phone number for 60 minutes?BTW – erasing this message without the author’s permission will have serious repercussions."
"Hurricane going to miss mainland, guess they are missing out on tons of plywood sales. LOL!"
You can buy this every morning and sell it at 3:30PM everyday.
I sold my shares in this company. I will only use LOWE'S for my purchases. As a veteran I am sick and tired of these companies who condemn hard working Americans for the WOKE movement and cancelled culture.The Georgia situation is the final straw for me. I WANT FAIR AND HONEST ELECTIONS.
Note to investor relations. Stop reporting the same day as Walmart. They are a drag on the sector
wanting to be with conscience while taking something away from people who earn a living from Home Depot business
Working It back down
"Unfortunately, HD will head below $100 in the next two months. No industry is immune."
All time high!
I thought the market was supposed to be surging today???
How do we report a data problem in Yahoo finance.Missing data at:https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HD/options?p=HD&.tsrc=fin-srch&date=1550188800&straddle=trueThat HD Feb 15 options chain.
I'm about to buy more if this insanity continues.
Close over 239.70...please. Next stop 250!

Certainly HD will be affected by tariff too
up up and awayyyyyy
here comes $200
"Come on HD, announce a split already!!!"
"HD continues to deliver. Comfortable beta of 1.06, consistent volume at new highs. Pricing is still in line with an overall market PE at 27. Call OI and time value premiums point to positive expectations Q4 & beyond. Exceptional management foresight demonstrated by their commitment of $US 1.3 billion to expand supply chain facilities; especially prescient in the shadow of a long C19 winter inside and China trade instability."
Just waiting for them to announce a split
Hey..... Artie Blank owns the Falcons.... hes vocal in his support of his black playersIs he aware of all the horrors that the Black Power saluteTheir players are using is associated with....Lets start with beating women to death.... sometimes they eFed up and beat the women to within an inch of death.... but its safe to say the smarter the woman.... the more severe beating she tookBut hey.... the NFL is against domestic violenceGreat job NFL ownersShould we go on to the association with black nationalism.... how about the anti police stance and the many shootouts with (targeted white) police that the Panthers Initiated? How about the black on black murderous shootouts with rival organizations.... Something for the NFL and its black athletes to be proud ofBut what the hey.... IF a white guy extendes his arm hes a naz....All of this is historical fact.... a lil knowledge is a dangerous thing... and those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.... but I must be a racist for knowing these historical facts and to be very concerned by it
Lowe’s is up and hasn’t really done a thing different
The biggest waste of time and money on any construction job is contractor leaving job going to buy/order materials. HD is attacking this issue and is a huge area of expansion for profits. Uber eats meet Uber contractor!
"I am not long HD but if I was I would be selling here....this is literally insane it is up on the year,....people have no idea how bad the economy is going to be...Great Depression stuff"
when they close over $250...then off to 300! USA Trump 2020 imo
yawn...mess with the bull get the horns. Big Joe always keeps his promises. See you down below
Doing a brisk business in NJ and PA .. Lots of paint for home bound folks and here comes garden time.
"Heating your small house with wood....can be a challenge at times. Normally a smart guy would have two or three cords of Maple, Fir or Alder stacked neatly against the fence in July to have time to dry out. This year there was only one and finding dry wood is hard to do in November. Then you run into a guy up the street that has 11 cords of bone dry fir in his back yard and cut in 12"" lengths. The price isn't 80 bucks a cord anymore, but beggars can't be choosers. The price is less than 200 bucks a cord, but looking at 3 cords of beautiful fir gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling. Always thank GOD for small and large favors. If HE had nothing to do with it, what are you losing??"
Why down?
"dAy Traders are having a field day with HD today.. They bought at the open @ $173 and already have sold @ $174 and now are buying back in @$173.20.. I suspect the Day Traders will again sell around $ 174.25 and then do it all over again.. LoL! Day traders will make money today, but will be crying by the end of the day when they make that last sell too soon."
How about all those people here who sold out at $260?
HD will have rocking sales revenue and earnings next Tuesday!!! They never closed their stores during the COVID-19 pandemic!!! GO NVDA GO!!!
"The free carpet installation is awesome. Here's how it works. There is a secret, underground group of independently wealthy illegals that drives around installing carpet for no charge. It's their way of paying back the gringos who have been so accommodating. The rusty, decrepid vehicles and the ten to a house lifestyle are simply a cover up. Most of these guys are secretly billionaires and don't want anyone to know it.And, the savings are real. These guys pay their own supplies, salaries, vehicles, taxes, helpers, insurance, gasoline, etc etc etc just so HD customers can save that much more money. It's a great, no-strings-attached deal and the illegal billionaires are happy to do it. Everyone wins."
$300 Plus...2021
Look at the five/ten year performance of HD. The PE and growth and dividend. Own this stock forever!
Ouch
300 by the end of July!!!
hd the most stable stock ever cant order wood online 
DOUBLE OUCHES!!!
Same basic price today it was when I bought in early September - I was hoping for better performance. Considering getting out since I do have some HD w/ in a few ETFs.
"Three HD's within a 20 mi radius here in the hardest-hit-by-Covid NE. Pulled into one, parking lot full, signs posted for hiring. Ditto #2, same at #3. No denying the visual evidence. Regardless of unemployment numbers, customers will still repair their dwellings. Longer times at home triggers the impulse to improve. And if we do get the second wave, they are well positioned for online purchases and curbside pickup. Based on the technicals and hi market volatility, looking for a trade to US$280 by year's end."
So this dropping because analysts on the call were relentless with questions pertaining to online (Amazon) competition? Even though it's have no impact. Gotta love playing the market.
I added some just under $279. If Cramer says wait you buy lol
Home Depot or Lowe’s?My opinion is Home Depot but who cares about my opinion.
"Hahaa... about to take a massive drop. A drop that you will need a flashlight to find the bottom of. By the way, most horribly run stores during this pandemic. I walked into three different stores, one I almost hit the old dude working there. They had every exit blocked off and as I am 5 steps from being out the building he tells me, sir, walk to the other side of the building to exit. The stores make no logical sense, seriously. As poorly run as can be and all anyone was buying was little stuff. No big sales, no contractors. Looking forward to the drop. I am short and won't be buying even remotely close to the 2's. Watch and learn kiddies...."
$170 was a major support level to have been broken. Could be severe trouble now.
hd going back to 228
thank you for more shares
Lots more downside for HD
"Wow! Now they are Pointing Fingers at each other. The three leaker Lying egg heads are getting real nervous, different answers spewing out all over.

"Remember folks...ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS greed does not pay. Market runs up,then they short is back down, very few small time retailers get out alive."
"Get out now, market going to RED"
Gaps are full this looks like it’s ready to move. 300 here we come
"the problem is that this is pegged to Lowes stock, and we all know how they are doing. It is hard for HD to move on its own with LOW scrapping the barrel everyday."
"Bought 100 shares for 39.00 about 20 yrs. ago. Is it time to take my 21,000 profit and move on or just sit on it. Obviously I don’t sell often."
Gotta love getting the dividend reinvestment statement!
Expecting 5% in green Tom!!
so HD couldn't predict the future so gets bopped LOL Picked up some more!!!!!!!!!
Buying this dip. Free money
Any idea what the dividend increase will be????
No guidance again going down
let's keep this gain up we will be back at high and pass it
"Big gain today, waiting for tomorrow!!"
Dip not even big enough to buy. Will recover in current quarter.
"I want to know who, exactly, called for the boycott."
Only 10% or so below 52 high. Back to boom times.
Worst case scenario...drop below 180 ..then steadily back up to 200...
APPLIANCES THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS FOR HD...NOW GONE
I can barely hold the pant loosely
"I do hope the $203.00 level is not smoke & mirrors. I have seen HD shoot up into this area several times, just to fall back $15.00. I honestly feel that the day trader groups see the big #s and sell out for there profit. It is odd to me that these people may buy 500 shares @ $190.00 per share. That comes to 95K. to me this is a lot of money. Something to think about, just leave the stock alone & put it into a DRIP. In the next 2 years you would see even more money. HD pays great dividends and seldom loses any money for anyone. I got into HD in 1989. I have never touched the money. It is now worth 8 times my initial investment. If you want a nest egg for the future, try it, you might be very happy"
Home Depot is up 4.92% to 239.15
wtrh july 6's .30
it will only goes up if it was a bad earning?
best of my bunch so far today
I'm hoping for a pullback after earnings to buy more shares. Up here at $190 I just cant justify adding.

Beware pump and dump today !WASHINGTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded in November, driven by a surge in multi-family housing projects, but construction of single-family homes fell to a 1-1/2-year low, pointing to deepening housing market weakness that could spill over to the broader economy.The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed housing starts fell in October instead of rising as previously reported. Underscoring the housing market weakness, single-family home completions dropped for a third straight month in November to their lowest level in more than a year"

Home Depot's sales must be through the roof after all these hurricanes especially from home insurance.
Those wildfires in California are going to create an awful lot of sales at Home Depot and Lowes down the road. Worst disaster in their history.
"This stock is up $57 bucks, over 30% off those lows on March 20th less than a month ago. Anyone who works there (my brother does) knows its packed as people staying home are doing all sorts of home improvements, gardening, cooking at home, etc... There earnings numbers are going to be good. Just like the grocery stores, seed companies, nurseries and a few other sectors. Good stock to be in over the rest of this year....at least."
"Here we are again heading back down to $260 from $285........yt seems stuck between this range. With house sales going through the rough, HD not capitalizing in stock price. I think investors are still unhappy about the ""pay guarantee"" made by HD mgmt, and we may have to wait until ""EARNINGS"" to better understand impacts.Last with the snowstorms happening now should benefit HD sales on shovels, salt, blowers etc AND then following up in a few months the ""springtime"" bump should boost HD by next ER to finally get to $300 targets. I think anything under $260 is time to add more....thoughts?"
Actual eps is 4.02 Home Depot beat it by .31 cent
tariffs on products from china and mexico! Home improvements and repairs are going to get costly.
Quarterly numbers should come in big after all the hurricane rebuilding and repairs ?
Ouch on the earnings!!!!
Can someone explain why Lowes is doing so much better than Home Depot lately. Home depot was always doubles plus about￼ $20 more than Lowe’s stock. Now it seems like they are closing in. Now they aren’t even double lowes stock.￼￼￼￼ what the heck happened?￼￼
Annnnddd..... Profits gone. Up in vanished like a fart in the wind. I guess I’ll hold and hope for a rebound. I went long and now I’m out.
my 5 year chart puts a  on my face always reinvest dividends hold long stay strong
3 month chart showing cup and handle; or my chart reading has gone bad of late.
Funny the guy who gave Nardelli millions is calling anyone stupid.
"In my opinion, price cutting by Lowe's is a desperate attempt to win customers from the leader. HD already sends out mailers for 10% off and have been for years. I'm not going to switch suppliers for 10%, especially when prices are typically higher at Lowe's. This will only hurt margins at Lowe's more."
People really think because amazon is going to be selling sears appliance that it's going to hurt Home Depot. Sears couldn't even sell their own appliance to survive! Lol
Gotta luv those imbecil left wingers they just made us a ton of money.Go Home Depot go Trump 2020and thank you Bernie for this fine establishment.
"I wish you people will stop ""pumping"" this stock because HD stock doesn't need any help going UP! It's a big boy stock that can handle anything thrown at it by the shorts and generic bashers."
"great earnings, 260 today"
What the hell just happened?
"Company is being grossly mismanaged. You go to any retail store you see groups of 5 and more employees loitering and when you ask for someone with expertise in electrical, mechanical, hardware or plumbing there are about 2 out of 40 odd employees on the floor who know. SAD. Sorry to say this, but anyone who appears to be under 40 generally has no idea about anything technical. I have a contractor; about 50 years old. A black man who was laid off so started his own business. He does metal work, metal cutting and welding (he was raised in his Dad's metal-works workshop). Today, he cannot keep up with the amount of work he has on backlog. HD should be hiring people like him in top positions, not college educated fools without any idea about real life issues like plumbing, electrical, welding, carpentry et al. Idiocy trickles down from the top. If the top man (Manager is an idiot) he will not hire people who are smarter than him else they will displace him."
if this hits $250 I am all in this bad boy and holding for a long time
Sherwin WIlliams missed and warns huge bloodbath for HD today IMO !http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sherwin-williams-misses-on-profit-offers-soft-outlook-as-it-books-charges-for-valspar-deal-2017-07-20
"PE Ratio (TTM) is 22.53, HD stock is kinda pricy here..."
"are we heading to $149 or $145 trading range like back in Feb-Apr time frame, or is this a over reaction to lumber lawsuit as another poster raised?"
For all you value investors out there who want safe reliable stocks that grow their dividends. Today is your lucky day.
HD Supply buy-out. Who has the scoop here?
Anyone who thinks hd is a loser... go to one any day of the week!!!!! packed and people spending a ridiculous amount. I see the same every weekend!
ETF funds selling every Time it gets near its 52 week high
New all-time high @ 253.78 in the after-market!
Boycotts?. ignorance at its finest.
$168 best to buy
Beware: CNBC is now just interviewing bears and doom and gloom analysts are all coming out again. Its all a scam.
Higher than usual open interest on the 222.50 strike price
Why is this tanking at the moment
"bought our first shares of HD 25 years ago for less than $10 per share. Over the next two years we bought more for a cost of $6500. Today our HD is worth $101,000 and we own 311 shares thanks to two splits early on. This stock is liquid gold. Carol"
"Buy $HD more lol..it has the best CFO in Carole Tome. All nonsense posts by people compared to $AMZN are clueless.HD has gone from focusing on store level service to other growth areas like pro contractors, online and installation which makes you $20-50K per one install. Only HD has hands over the whole US.Those big-ticket sales offset and beat easily whatever other challenges it faces."
"Open letter to Hoe Moe Depot longs. Did you know that there are news outlets other than Fox News? My guess is that your pastor has warned you about tuning into such evil, diabolical, satanic sources such as MSNBC or CBS. That's okay. Dumb, uneducated, hate filled white people are projected to be outnumbered in 2040, so enjoy your remaining, fake kkkkristian, hate filled, useless years."
"good earnings, maybe this has something to do with the drop? http://snip.ly/hb60vs"
Not participating on the rebound. That does not bode well for HD. Were we downgraded or something?
Carter Worth is ALWAYS wrong...now he says HD is faltering which is TIME to buy ....LOL

Just disgusting what they are doing here to the stock. Probably setting up for a huge spike when stimulus announced!!
this is accumulation period. should top $220+
good gains today
And to think  the only reason this has risen is due to government money injection... whoa! Small business is no more. Government gardening/home improvement
When will this split? will it be a 3/2?
I didn't know HD was expanding into Mexico? LOL BUY BUY BUY
Open lower today?????
"I don't want to be the pessimist here but with all the downturn in the housing market which is just starting, and the fact that the insurance claims have yet to be filed on these disasters, the idea of an upturn in sales is just not on the horizon IMHO"
I heard about HD the other day on (http://dailystox.xyz). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Last time the 50 day and 200 day had this type of spread HD took a tumble basically to the next level of support
After earnings imho over 200pps again. Best of breed.
"Just bought 100 lbs of cement with $700 shipping, screws that don't fit, paint stripper cans that blew up and a new fridge from Amazon that does not cool and have to return. WOHOO!"

Home builders stock getting hit today. Will possibly close $155 today for the option X today.
Goldman did well by Trading others not so much . I guess that’s why we take these big hits
Nice divy ratio payout. That pe is too high for me

"Looks like being a common profiteer didn't pan out to well for some. Another thing, did you see the size of those houses in Naples? I kind of doubt they buy the kitschy trash that The Depot peddles."
Looks like they captured the $7 premarket jump
Now that its over 300 a split is in the cardsBeen 21 years Either 3:2 or 2:1 but 3:1 would be a suprise and really nice
"HD closed at 180,32 USD +4,66 (2,65 %)not at 179.21+3.55 (+2.02%) as yahoo suggests."
and just like that we break $300..........next stop $305. And once ER happens HD will soar to $320.
tough day
I figure with everyone staying home avoiding the world I thought this would be a buy. Who would not want a bigger house to walk in and insulate more.
Trump tariffs means consumer has less money to purchase other things.
According to my taiwanese partner high end Pixel 3 XL is delayed by 1 year this from highly reliable source their vendor news
Tired marketing and tired look. They are way overdue for a refresh
7.50 was some kind of Glitch.
Policewelfare
19.5% below all the all time high. Been here before and I do not seen any reason to sell or trim my holdings. My only suggestion to management is they should be buying back stock hand over fist right now more so than usual.
Looks like 155 pre earnings which is even better than I had anticipated!
storm won't hit land and now the storm chasers are bailing. typical!. time to ring the register and wait til it hits 200 again. whole I'm long $HD and $LOW in the long term I think there will be better entry points. so it's okay to sell and get back in at a lower price. between HD and LOw how much competition is there?
"Anyone know where on yahoo you can find out WHAT TIME (not the day) ER comes out? I know HD is tomorrow morning, but wondering where you find that info"
I think HD is heads better than LOW.
This will be a good short when the time comes.
mmmmmm HD div day. Beautiful. Steak & lobster tonight!
This must be the blow off top because this is going to feel it hard in a couple of months.
futures holding strong at 1150 pm should open green gooo HD strong

r we supposed to get dividends today
Many things closed/stopped but Markets open losing $ for elderly
This was the first stock I ever bought at 78 bucks years ago lol
Ridiculous
This stock will be at $250 based on cashflow DCF valuation model. Interest rates going up will cause new home sales to slow down.More maintenance for existing homes... HD sales will rise giving more cash flow.Watch it grow... Long term hold.
HD is just an Amazon showroom.
Yeah buy the airlines and cruise shops and sell HD and LOW. Dummies lol
This post is for Vraiphil I read all of your post on all the different boards Tou are very negative person and sounds like you know everything
Let's see if we have less than a $1.00 drop tomorrow on the ex-div. That would be a good sign.
nice gain today
300 today!
Hate to say it but hurricanes brewing. Sends stock higher which is what I suspect happening today
Back to 230s soon enough!
MAGA TRUMP WINNING$ZM $MNKD $HD $BA
well 180$ to 200$$++ easy
Sell now and buy back at reduced price. HD is headed south. Epic collapse of shareholder value. Get out now!
THE MARKET EXPECT HD TO HIT 228 BEFORE CHRISTMAS ALL ABOARD SET FOR A LARGE UP TODAY AND CONTINUE UP VERY BULLISH TODAY...HD IS A BUY IT HIT IT'S LOW ONLY GOING UP FROM HERE SEE YOU AT 228
"It is nice to see HD gaining this week. I think the warmer weather is getting people out shopping in there local HD store. I have gone long with HD for the last 31 years. I wish I could say I have thousands of shares but, that is not the case. I am just a working man so I could not put thousands of dollars in my account. I have used the drip plan which has worked very well for me. I do have eight other accounts that have used the drip approach. If you are a young man or even middle age, it will work very well for you. You will not have to be pouring over what is going on in the stock market. Please look at drip plan investing. You just add money in your stock when you have the money at the time. You will not have to pay any broker fee's.If you go long, the rewards will make you happy."
Shorts to get crushed today.. HD going to $150.00
HD is down -5.07% to 194.54
"Are there any actual humans here, or all bots?"
get over it gains since lows in March puts up plus an outstanding earnnig
"Last week was bloody, but looks like next week will be rosy.It is close to earning time. will see over $200.00 soon."
back to 190. soon
This is just another thing causing panic selling
Wow Home Depot has really lagged ￼￼behind Lowe’s. They are blowing Home Depot away in the past few months.￼￼
What a turd stock.
Bought calls cuz Home Depot is solid. They’ll be back up by the end of the week.
"why no action with HD? Labor Day, Tropical Storm/Hurricane season and flooding across the northeast not a factor?"
Oversold...adding more soon
People working from home will continue to purchase building supplies. Highly profitable compared to Walmart and Lowes. I think the dividend is sustainable with growth over the year.
"Used to work as vendor in HD. Went back to one of stores that I used to service. Associate told me that store suffered $300,000 in theft discovered during inventory. Also, they used to have security walking the stores, but I guess they don't want to pay for it. Keep costs down."
"mention AMZN and investors start freaking out. HD is solid, COST is solid, they are not going anywhere. Watch AMZN spread themselves too thin and crash. Then what? Investors will go back to what they knew before... great, stable companies."
Up 18 percent in the last 30 days Buy Buy Buy The Big Guys need Buyers
This stock keeps rising even as new home starts building permits plunge big and fall fro 3 consecutive months and all other retailers implode..https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN197277
I think HD will drop about 2-3 dollars on Monday due to less impact due to IRMA.
treasury debt is flowing into the profits of HD.Because people doesn't pay enough tax and this money are going to home improvement and its comes from increasing treasury debt ..
WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury says it will have to borrow a record $2.99 trillion in current quarter to deal with pandemic.Great sign for the economy.You get a car You get a car You get a car.
Never go a morning without a personal stock checkup.

"have patience and you will be able to buy HD at $135-136 in the coming weeks. Great company and stock, but wouldn't add at these levels."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-now-favors-lowes-200017421.html
"Bought more today @12.22 and after hours at 12.05 cost avg down to 14.78$ I've been buying all the way down last 4 months slowly. Got dang near as much in this as I do $HD and $QCOM now. If it keeps going down I'll probably have as much as I do in $FB. I believe long-term in this one. My exit point on this one is ""$0.00"""
Namaste technology
"Should go back down to $200. Look at 10 yr chart. We have been a little over bought since May. No worries. Buy more here, or at $210, or anytime. we are headed back up for sure. Nothing has changed, just fake news. Watch for possible revisions upward in the next few weeks."
Correction healthy since no stock goes up in a straight line but silly to sell before ex-dividend date. You pay taxes plus lose the dividend.
I think the only problem with HD is that I bought it at 237 a week ago
I’m hoping 250 soon.... anyone else think so??
Chinese products and as per Mr Trump regulation it's going to be difficult to sell Chinese products
all news points to growrh and huge sales for this quarter
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-integrated-strategy-aids-135801365.htmlAmid the debacle of Wednesday's sell off, HD price action, volume, and option OI continue to affirm this is a go long and stay long."
The market makes no sense valuation wise. We knew this. Perfect example Elon musk can fart and his stock goes up 60 bucks. HD can add 6b in sales YOY and their stock goes down. Go figure
I feel your pain now longs. Lets see if we'll see $145 today.
hey we're ok up over 39$ per share in last 6 months
I own shares of this Company and recently have seen a massive slowdown in building permits. I just hate it that HD will faulter again . I feel that the economy is slowing and we are not being told the truth. What I hear and what we are being told by the government are two separate stories. I believe that something is happening to the underlying foundation of this nation. False growth stories by borrowed money doesn't bring in profits. It only brings in more debts. Just sharing a thought here. It is not looking good with this goldilocks economy that is being projected .
Democrats never fail to reinforce just how ignorant they... are almost on a daily basis.
I need this back up to 216 . Please !!!!!
At this rate the dividend will be 3% pretty soon
Here's an interesting take on an HD stock split: https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/06/home-depot-stock-split-will-2017-be-the-year.aspx
Comp sales were a blowout 6.3 vs 4.7
our tax refund was lower so projects are onhold until next year.
"How, if at all, will the order on line craze affect HD and other hardware merchants...your thoughts?"
I have predicted and no one listen
"Yep I am sure glad I got some to take some off the table on their HD stock , because HD had gone from a up cycle into a new down cycle how low HD is going I have no clue until the next up cycle is starting which will be some time maybe not until spring. Good luck if you did not sell some of your HD it might drop more that 20% before the down cycle is over . Looks like he is losing lots of money on his HD today LOL No wonder he was so mad and crazy today must be as crazy as Nancy Pelosi."
The rebuilding that needs to be done in all the affected states by the hurricane will require a hardware supplier. HD AND LOW are crucial retailer's and they will help in the rebuilding and should also benefit from sales and insurance claims for repairs.
Wait until 180
This is a huge buying opportunity!!! A number one US home company! You should buy and hold at this level.
Who forgot to hit the SELL BUTTON at 145? Go ahead and fess up...it happens.
If stock can't go up after an 8% comp what will happen when it has a 4% comp? Market realizes that this is as good as it gets.
This is Black Friday
Does anyone know how much The next dividend is and when it is going to be paid?￼￼
Must be a bear market oh well your a comment or so back too prosperity
Had a problem with one of their products. They said they would call me and they never did. Customer service eventually catches up with a company.
"Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) – Research analysts at Jefferies Group increased their Q2 2018 earnings per share estimates for shares of Home Depot in a research report issued to clients and investors on Thursday. Jefferies Group analyst D. Binder now expects that the home improvement retailer will post earnings of $2.21 per share for the quarter, up from their previous forecast of $2.20. Jefferies Group has a “Buy” rating and a $182.00 price target on the stock."
"THis company is hugely overpriced, needs to go down about 100 more."
"CNBC reports $HD Home Depot reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $4.33 billion, or $4.02 per share, up 25% from $3.48 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting earnings per share of $3.71. Net sales rose 23.4% to $38.05 billion, topping expectations of $34.53 billion"
Wow! Haven't seen this much overselling in a while!
The market follows home depot. Home depot will be up today therefore the market will be up. Unstoppable gap fill on $HD
Home Depot is down 12.02% to 180.95
If interest rates do not go up tomorrow this should go couple dollars
LVS Just suspended its dividend and HD just raised theirs 10%! this is why i will never sell the Home Depot.
Who would listen to that conference call then decide to sell?? LOL
Why is HD shown as Overvalued on yahoo finance?

"IMO Think it's time for a 3-1 split, yes same value however lower price will attract more/new investors."
if a small drop fine im buying more its a no brainer when we know the housing market flying..Solid company decent dividends and will absolutely continue to climb.
Once the next earnings comes out imho HD goes to new highs.
just increase my Position good play long term

Lowe’s has no lines. people just go in and out and keeping their distance. It’s not like we were never at least few feet apart before corona. This waiting in line to get in is extremely dumb and waste of time. fix it dummies
"Why would you own this at 2.5% dividend, when other names are at 3.5% dividend with HALF the beta???"
"I thought HD was going out of business, BAZINGA! 20 plus year stockholder and have another 15+ years to reinvest the dividend and listen to all the experts that the sky is falling and no one is ever going to need another hammer again!"
"Nice bubble, explosion soon :)"
It will drop as predicted. Huge run up before earnings leaving bag holders at the high. Should drop 5 to 10% next few days before going up again.
BUYING TODAY HD BEAT EARNINGS AND RAISED THE DIVIDEND 10%. SO IN 7YRS IT DOUBLES AGAIN TO AROUND 12 DOLLARS A SHARE. ALSO GAINING MARKET SHARE ON LOWES. THANKS FOR THE GIFT.
I don't know what sparked it but it sure is nice
Modern technology and cheap foreign labor has put us into a long term deflationary environment. Yet they keep telling us we need an inflationary world. Ask yourself WHY?Does this make sense to you. NOT ME
HIstoric 5yr HD PE 22.5. so we can run.
Welcome to the Big Joe Show. Taking this down to 208 min. Sorry kids Big Joe has to get paid today
The co-founder of HD just lost another customer with his political rhetoric..Customer since they opened.
Bunch of clueless analysts doing upgrades and downgrades for their buddies.
@ close 1.5 mil shares sold

"All of you so sure of yourselves bears, let’s see you post what your position is. That way we can laugh at you when this rips up tomorrow and next week."
R how is your bbby doing today? LOL Listen to you lose 85%. HD up over 160% in 5 yrs and no reason not to go higher!! none!!
Please make more money for Bernie -- he needs to re-stock after making his contributions to our dictator!
People tired of paying double what they paid last year for Chinese junk
Why
Will this stock split soon. I heard the other day that a 3 for 1 is right around the corner!! Any truth to that?
"So, earnings tomorrow is already priced in, am i right? No way it gaps up again tomorrow. Trying to find a good entry point for a long hold."
"I completely disagree with the outlook on HD. The entire housing sector is in the gutter right now, and interest rates are rising. So there will be fewer new builds, and less willing to buy new homes at high interest rates. So when people aren't buying new homes, they are spending $ on repairs on older homes. More people are renting homes instead of buying, and I can tell you as a landlord, that I do many repairs myself to maintain rental profits. HD is the leader in DIY repairs, and I think it will sustain profits."
I’ve owned HD since they went public but I’m appalled at their price gouging during these tough times. Kleenex is three times more now. Oh well supply and huge demand I guess.
Doesn’t look good for President Trump if he gets involved with this investigation with Flynn
"I think it would be a great time for HD to do a split. This would get the price of a share down to where people would buy shares of HD to get into investing.Any time you get investors buying HD, it will only help HD. I started purchasing HD back in 1989. I still own all of the shares I purchased. I purchased shares up thru 1999. I have friends now that want to invest in HD but the price keeps them from making the move. You have people who make the dumb analogy that $100 equals 10 $10.00 bills. These people are not long term investors. Spits do help long term investors."
"HD should be trading flat but not at this level, I would expect to flatline around $290 until springtime when everyone starts to fix up homes and landscape. It seems the salary/bonus guarantee was a game changer when announced HD dropped and is staying here.I don't mind waiting because of the dividend but for no other reason its disappointing!"
"I've been in this stock since $30 .. it's a duopoly ( and the better of the two) it will reward you if hold and buy in the dips. This is a long term investment + great divined. If I had one stock to buy now and hold for the next 10 years this is it .... It's not a reddit stock , it's for investors !!!"
I like the sure thing. Home depot has beaten estimates 5 out of the last 6 quarters. The the other one in line. So next year imo we earn 11 dollars a share. Put a historic 22.5 handle on that and you get 247 a share not counting the dividend raise.
buying opportunity
4 mil shares traded moves all billion+ shares in float
"Trump caused other Republicans' popularity to drop. If they impeach Trump , their approval ratings might improve."

"Do any of you profiteering mutants believe that carpet installation is free? Of course you do, that's why Home Depot advertises it. OMG, I would love for you to go on one carpet installation job, except you would probably collapse due to physical exertion. Free installation. Hilarious, and you mutants actually believe it."
today's gains are the HD I have known and loved held long and rode out the downs knowing it will come back stronger
Bring this to $165...Will Dbl position at that level.
What's crazy to me is why there are no buy side analysts coming out of the woodwork to support HD. My gawd they upgrade Blue Apron which hasn't even proven itself to be profitable yet and dis HD! Where's the institutional support today or are they just filling their basket ahead of earnings?

"Two ways of looking at HD. One: yes there are lines to go shopping, but usually all those people are in the store buying. Also, I am certain people turn around and leave rather than wait in a line to shop (I have) which should reflect in lower sales. Two, there really is nothing that could be any worse than this as far as shutting down the economy. This is as bad as it gets, and people are lining up to shop at HD. Talk about a recession proof companyI am going with number two and am glad I bought HD years ago."
Amazing how HD missed on revenue missed on comparison stores guided down lower and the stock is flying....just amazing 
"the top of the markets is here ,,,,,learn they are shouting the end of the big bull run,, fools hold at this level"

LET'S LOOK AT IT THIS WAY THEY BOTH NEED EACHOTHER SO THE DEAL WILL HAPPON THIS YEAR FOR THE GOOD OF BOYH ECONOMES FOR REAL THIS WILL HAPPON ……...SO STOP THE PANIC......
Great well run companies don’t need all that. Based on results earnings innovation management
Its all gonna keep plummeting. Lotta cash gonna be left on the table.
"Don’t buy now, you won’t know how deep it’ll go....."
"Home Depot has the best record of any company ever for exploiting illegals. They have made an art form out of having labor shops hire illegals and then covering their tracks with piles and piles of worthless paperwork. Library cards, bus passes, water bills, rent checks, checks to the barber, the gas station, sketchy car dealers, doctors and dentists.And, it all adds up to nothing except the Home Depot sending out billions of illegals to install your flooring.You get unregistered illegals in exchange for second rate flooring products. And, you Home Depot longs seem to love it.You put your local store out of business, you pay too much for inferior, Chinese junk and it's all installed by illegals.MAGA == My Attorney Got Arraigned. At least you Trump Stains got to bully a few Hollywood people that you don't care for."
It is so nice to hear the roar of Home Depot !!

"Home Depot is now requiring customers to line up and wait before ENTERING their stores, citing social distancing. The employee who explained this to me, yesterday, wasn't even wearing a mask! He had half a dozen customers lined up, waiting to enter the store...and it wasn't anywhere near as busy as it would be normally...This does not bode well for next quarter's earnings."
"America haters and Trump haters don't shop at Home Depot, they destroy things, they don't build anything."
"This needs to split. I've been in HD's and the employees don't buy as much stock in HD anymore. They all comment it's to expensive at this current price. That may be irrelevant in the long run but psychologically it's a factor. I know, I worked there for 26 years. Buying a stock at $100.00 seems to be a more comfortable feeling. I'll bet a lot of employees at Amazon don't buy Amazon. Who would want to purchase a portion of $3500.00 out of a meager paycheck? Duh, get my drift. Hope the ""powers that be"" at HD read this. TIME TO SPLIT, WAY OVERDUE."
buying COST and HD on sector weakness. Both are winners!
I promised 250.00 by july 15. I was wrong now Im calling 300.00 by 7-15-20. Look for a stock split in several months.
"Over priced,hd,dis,tsla,the best priced stock is teva.remember that in a month"
HD. Best LT value stock ever. Get it while you can tomorrow.
LOWES WANTING TO CATCH IS BUYING ll AT RUMORED $35/Share. Monday after earnings.
"im a contractor and I spend on average 200,000 a year on materials. Home depot and lowes get about half of that. I will be buying all my materials from home depot now for doing the right thing and staying out of politics. if georgia's voting law was racist then that's means it would have to only effect a certain race, it doesn't. the new law is for everyone. Having an i.d to vote should be mandatory so there isn't ever claims of voter fruad again. They took some evening hours away but added more weekend hours.. getting upset that people in georgia need an i.d is crazy. by saying that's not right because some people don't have i.ds is calling the people of georgia stupid... georgia GIVES away free i.ds... i have to pay for mine. If someone doesn't know how to get a free i.d then i don't think they should be voting anyways. Colorado and delaware have stricter, race targeted laws than georgia but since they are democrat states no one says anything about it."
load up before it splits!!
HD has about the same valuation as Walmart! Senseless WallStreet
Housing starts are strong!! more $$$$$ for the Home Depot.
"Just like Apple two weeks ago, blow out earnings and stock falls......"
3:1 split coming?
Mutual funds like Fidelity over time have MASSIVE capital gains in HD. Now they may trim there position but NEVER IMO sellout of a duoply that has a very high ROE and MARGINS!! What to buy BBBY!! They would fire that manager!! plus on a midcap stock you can't take a meaningful position in a stock!! Look at the top returning funds they have the apples fb hds of the World!
LA numbers never lie. hd 5yr return 150% and tgt 27%. go pump that loser! lol
"LOWES, HD U THINK GOES HIGHER BECAUSE HURRICANES"
"This Co will benefit in every way possible from drywall, vacuums,carpet,appliances. Sooo much needs to get replaced ! Up and UP."
"Armstrong Flooring is tanking huge on LOSS !Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (AFI)NYSE - NYSE Real Time Price. Currency in USDAdd to watchlistQuote Lookup19.50-2.45 (-11.16%)As of 10:07AM EST. Market open.http://finance.yahoo.com/news/armstrong-flooring-reports-4q-loss-121342928.html"
Pre market we should see some life and then a big rebound after open. Bet on it guys. Stocks cannot go lower every day. It is not bear market
Cramer's been pumping this all year.should have seen it coming
ATT HD IS HOT HOT GOING UP 3 to4% to day or more mabe this low we could see 5%up move
Fading...
Today is finally the day we break that old 52 week high. Next week we will see new highs. Let’s make HD go higher again!
HD is reacting as if it had an earnings miss rather than one lousy analyst downgrade!
HD is up 4.92% to 239.15
More bad news for overpriced HD !This will hurt HD appliance sales and revenues !https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sears-amazon-alexa-turn-kenmore-air-conditioner-123039924--finance.html
I’m getting out. This is ridiculous
"This is a strong company one way or another. and their internet sales will take off. If you just look an an items on amazon and then look at the price on HD, you will see a much better price in most cases. 50 percent difference on the item I purchased the other day. Hang with 'em. A great tie to buy big"
Did anybody know that HD is down $28 since Jan
A lot of precarious factors looming
"Great comeback, scary at $120 but we are riding back up"
"You have cash, buy your stock back, please."
HD is down 6.24% to 214.26
Big win for CAT should help us today! Dow may outshine today leaving the Naz in the dust!
"All children’s workshops closed nationwide, effective immediately. And they say this is no big deal."
Hey looking good this A.M
"wow, crashing big again, lowes upgraded"
I purchased HD back in the late 80s when it was cheap. I kept buying thru the 90s. I did all of this in a DRIP plan. I just kept feeding it when I had the money. I did a number of stocks this way. I have never sold a single share. I went thru a lot of splits with HD. I personally love splits. Splits just seem to make the stocks stronger. I would advise younger investors to put your money in DRIP plans. It cost you nothing and the rewards over the next 25 to 30 years will make you happy. The long term investor is the way to go.
HD is a buy here. Same store sales at 25% is unheard of and I see no viable reason why it won't continue anytime soon. The market is radical with stocks like GME soaring and HD declining??? Absurd behavior!
WW Grainger is tanking huge !They have a lot on common with HD..
CRUSHED IT!!!
"With interest rate drop Home Depot will have to hire more people to count that money, and that’s what causing the drop."
$220 soon
almost 200$.
EPS Home Depot bubble ready too pop on their last earnings. Down big.
what will be the estimated damage cost and how will this hurricane affect forward guidance?
Everybody needs shelter!
this stock behaves strangely every earnings period. A week after reporting it will be up... i'ts like only old people who read the report 3 days later buy the stock.
"Stock is going down... expect this year's gross margin expansion to be 41 basis points vs. 45 basis points previously. The reason for the trim, says management, is higher transportation costs."
stock is higher then this time last year..this wont be a huge money maker in the next year.
I knew this would hit a new high. I feel 330 today
Curious ... to longtime HD investors ... when and at what price did HD last split??? Thanks!
300 tomorrow
Sold today at $116 and bought Apple
Nice to see BA moves HD to buy from neutral after it has doubled in price. Just sayin.
Why Home Depot’s booming when builders aren’t building is because they cook the books. all the time
testing 195 then back to 200
"having dealt with home depot's website, app, delivery, and customer service over the holidays. I can clearly tell everyone that this company is having massive problems with execution"
why its down after good results?
I have been long on Hd for 21 years!!I invest in good people....
No worries longs fraud st will push this back north
"I've been waiting for months to buy this company on a dip. Got in @255,55 and I plan to hold for years"
I am sitting in my car in the parking lot of a HD. Lots of shoppers. Some with Mask. Lots of contractors.
needed to average out my calls.
Home depot is the canary in the coal mine.
"Wait, didn't Creamer's rag TheShills.com say HD was safe from Amazon not too long ago? Thought I saw it between the 10k articles from them saying that Sears must die a fiery death."
"The stock already rallied into earnings from $142 to $156. The RSI is overbought and the price is at the upper Bollinger band. Holding into earnings is not smart. May pop in the morning on good report but will whither in the next 3 weeks with downside to lower BB and 200 day MA at $144. GLTA the rise is in and as they say ""BUY THE RUMOR SELL ON THE NEWS"" !"
shorted @191.04
Buying the dip today. COVID is good for HD and LOW. More home improvement projects with more people staying at home. Don't lean into the fear shorts are spreading. Be greedy when Mr. Market is fearful. This will rally after the election.
I can only hope you are one of the people who have gone long with HD.Thankfully I purchased back 1989 thru 1999 I. just sit back and watch the numbers go up. HD is a winner. HD will put money in your pocket.
The companies that move from China will negotiate a deal that will allow them offer products that will meet or beat current prices .
wow!
can we see $185 today???
$5 dividend would be a yield of 2.6%. This is doable and reasonable. A 21% increase in the current dividend!
New all-time high over 224. Many more to come.
"Grab the gems while they r down!HD, BABA, AMZN, AMD"
....Top Republicans behind tax plan say border adjustment tax is dead. Republican leaders working on tax reform say they have set aside the controversial border adjustment provision. ... Top Republicans driving the GOP tax reform effort have given up on border adjustment.
Yo this market is bs.... how numbers go up but market go down ?!?! maybe the earnings haven't hit chart yet idk but I'm #$%$
Going Down
can somebody tell me HD will be up or down tomorrow so I can sleep please?
will we hit $200 this week?
Don't think the big money is not looking at HD. what a great price for a takeover.
"Apparently from yesterdays action, new construction came to a halt and will never resume, renovations ended for good, all home repairs never get repaired."
SnowFlake there are a lot of Flakes that are going to lose money buying that today
"im very happy so many comments are negative here, 70% of this chat is ""200 soon"" The funny thing is the short squeeze will be big and will push it higher than without all of those negative haters. 247 close and 260+ tmrw"
The higher prices lower revenue is month old news
shorting is Unamerican......ban shorting stocks now.
"Well, if the depression and layoffs continue, can always go get a job at Home Depot!!"
love it over 200 and going higher
Going down slowly. No panic selling. Another downgrade and we can jump in again.
HD is on a tear and will continue over the next week. wpuld not be surprised to see upgrades as early as tomorrow
Loaded up @171.69 time will tell.
Need another massive sell off here for NASDAQ. IT is so out of range in price. Needs a 30% hair cut here. Teach these fools a lesson. ITs all just greed here. No common sense period.Blame the FED with 0 interest rates.
We hit the 200day ma. Historically we come back from here or drop another 8.5% at most and wait 4 months to hit highs again. My opinion
Conference call starting. All about guidance.
"""US pending home sales fell in August""4 out of past 5 months the party is over the fed is removing the punchbowl.."
IMO this may explode like Wayfair. People are bored at home just looking for things to fix. You can also buy furniture...
Would you buy more shares when markets open or would wait till the dust settle?
"American home improvement things sales strong growth maybe just beginning, because new home sales reach 13years high, so HD reach $500 no any problem, Fed won't rise rate in this year, because electing year and covid-19 disaster,"
Turn green by end of the day and huge rally for the remainder of the year.
"If the share price of HD goes to $300,000 a share, it is still a company that employs billions of illegals. This is a weird thing about America. Employing illegals is fine as long as products are cheap. That's really what it comes down to. Stop waving the flag for The Hoe Moe Depot as some kind of patriot. They are simply a software algorithm that hires illegals until some kind of law changes this abuse, and Trump is friends with the people in Georgia."
So excluding the interline 0.16 charge earnings would be 2.25?
Now China’s angry and global’s looking gloomy
Dammmm that 147 resistance
Powell can't be trusted!! Complete liar!! I'm selling this while I'm still somewhat ahead!!!
"CNBC is spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt)"
Low down $125 HD $10 overnight
I love the video about company donations.The Yahoo! snowflakes want to punish companies that donate money to Republicans.It is a very entertaining video as they try to make us think these heroes are somehow villians.
Like I said before buy on manipulation $150 easy before ER
going all in today
 Dr. Ben Carson wipes the smirk off Obama's face. Great video watch it. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EHxJK_xSpcg&itct=CA4QpDAYAyITCPuG-KLP29MCFVh_qgodNusJxDIHcmVsYXRlZEjP14K13pqWvD8%3D
Buying more today. Nothing but gains.
"A 16x7 one piece garage door....Over the 13 years my Son and i have put in about 25 of these swing out doors, but haven't put one in the last year. Friday we found ourselves taking one out here in Edmonds, the greatest little city in all the world.The lady was 86 years old, but looked about 70.They are a pain to take out. You take out the springs, and pull out the door, putting it on one saw horse. My Son ran the chain saw cutting 3 slices up the bottom and cutting it length wise across the middle. Then bending down one rail, to pull one side down and out and then cutting the top half into 4 pcs. The 8 pcs. went into my 79 Ford 1/2 ton, 460, C6 trans and 9"" rear end, one of 6, (what else is there in the world of james)??There was a monster beam above the door and one side lacked one vertical piece of wood to fill in and there just happened to be one in the garage. We put in that beautiful, fully insulated, with steel on both sides, white Northwest Door, what else is there??, raised the opener and were done for the day. The Lady was a Sweetheart and loved the door. i askedher if her husband was at home and she said he was a chain smoker and died 20 years ago. We were there about 4 or 5 hours and charged her 1450 bucks + tax, which was a 600 dollar afternoon for jimmy boy and Son.It's so nice to have a Son or three....two of which live in Blue Springs, Mo. One of which never talks to me.You can't have EVERYTHING...."
"well, 190$++ easy this weeks, after strong earnings and forecast"
HD reached an all time high at 224.90
Do you guys smell something.............I smell a stock split coming soon.
come on HD let's get to 240
Put the fool R guy on IGNORE!! He pumped M at 16 and BBBY at 11. Hd is imo a super strong co. Just raised their dividend 10% in this market. His pumps eliminated there divi.
We called the bounce off 172 over a hour ago. Now it is 176.
I wonder what the Insiders have been doing recently
What the heck? What’s going on?
Hard to believe that this stock is down $27 from the highs. Back to $180 while people are buying Lowe’s. I do not get it. $207 was a bit of an over action on the upside but we seem to be making strong support at $178-$180. I hope the company is buying a lot of stock at these levels.
Told you to buy BBBY WOW up 40% and HD down from $239 to $222 today. Was lower and HD will be going lower.
"The Democrp SHEEP that voted in this election are some of the biggest loser mooches on the plant.. A real group of poorly educated lazy welfare dopes. We all know it. Non working ,Illegal, Ghetto, the crime rate. and drug addicts.. Democrp America."
market getting worse....hd getting closer to green
About 3 weeks ago when hd was at about 280 I said going to 300 very shortly.Now I see this stock at 325 to 359 by the end of the year. enjoy hd holders.
Who had the worse week so far President Trump or Home Depot?
We need a good retail sales number this morning
"This is all Trumps fault! Wildfires in .CA, hurricanes in Fla and Chicago murders, all TRUMPS FAULT! If Hillary won we would all be walking in high cotton!"
Housing starts are up 7% in 2020 compared to 2019. That’s a lot of home improvement projects which will just add to HD and Low’s bottom line...
"I have to say I love HD. I started purchasing HD in the late 80s. I purchased the stock when ever I had a little money to invest. In those days I did not have to pay much for the stock. I purchased the stock thru a drip plan. I purchased 12 other stocks thru drip plans. I would not have been able to buy stocks if it were not for drip plans. HD was my favorite stock thru all the years. I quit purchasing stock in 2005 and used my money on other ideas such a property. HD has been very good to me in all the years I have owned it. I went thru a lot of splits until about 1999. Do not let people tell you stock splits are not good. They are great. It bothers me as to how the market has taken a dive and seems to be going lower. In less than a year if you owned 1000 shares, you are now down 50K. That is a lot of money to me for just one stock. If you own more shares you are even further down. If you own HD and go long you will be ok and you will make money. I have gone thru times like this before, just not down like this so fast..If you hold on to your HD and not expect to get rich in a short time, you will be ok. HD is a proven winner."
hopefully HD will break 147 tomorrow
"Slow, steady build back to $160 before ER on 8/15. Up 1% when overall market was flat. A $1/s dividend at month end."
MYSELF IT'S ALL MONEY.
Yesterday morning g HD hit $280 after the upgrade but closed down hard after the AM strength. The stock has now plunged $8 since yesterday AM. Any reason why HD keeps goi g down?
Congress should’ve been investigating the SEC and why they do nothing about these shake downs
what is the expected bottom guys
does it close 200?
Dont care if doubles in 2 days - will never invest in this russian backed company- vote blue against these Russian backed companies
"HD is done, good dividend - but losing value."
the Difference HD has more Commercial contracts then LOW
LMAO!! WHAT A SAD SACK THAT R IS!!! PUMPING M AT 19 AND BBBY AT 11. HE SHOULD BE FIRED AS A PAID BASHER!!! I WILL PASS THE HAT FOR YOU BOY!!
I call 220 next week.
anyone else see this completely manipulated on low volume by MM? can't wait for it to close in red and drop significantly tomorrow!!!
All out bear attack and GE and HD are the whipping boys for the Dow
Hugely overpriced.. 200 will be tested...
I hate when Analyst in the .4th qtr things are slowing. It’s and always has been a slow this time of years it’s the cold weather and upcoming holidays Duh! I I wish you could reply to their commentary .Their getting paid to worry people into making bad business decisions!
$HD and $PINS partnering up! https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/09/home-depot-adapts-black-friday-holiday-shopping-season-to-pandemic-era.html?__twitter_impression=true
"This company has negative shareholder equity. If you buy the stock, by definition, it is worth less than the market cap of the company. You are simply pumping money into the pockets of the principles. This is hilarious. All the hurricanes and the tornadoes and other natural disasters, and the (supposed,) use of illegals and after all that, you are owning less than the company is worth. Wow, how do you get that kind of work."
US new-home sales climb to 8-month high in March!!!
HD has skilled experienced marketers merchandisers that will negotiate better prices in or out of China
Fewer projects if any this year..Thanks Trump
"The Home Depot longs are certainly all MAGA Trumpers. Send her back!!! Lock them up!!! My Attorney's Getting Arraigned!!! My Attorney's Got Audiotapes!!! The Home Depot is without a doubt, one of the biggest users of illegals ever, in the history of Merika. The Home Depot uses more illegals than any other, ""legitimate,"" company on earth.The former CEO dumps money into Trump's lap. Meanwhile all flooring is done by illegals. The flooring shops are a joke amongst the undocumented illegals. They call it, ""the safest place to hide,"" in America."
Wow I’m impressed this week we broke 190! Let’s if we stay in the 190’s into next week.
What does HD have to do with Trade Wars ?????????????????????????????????????what a joke !
They pumped it up and sold off made their money . Probably not doing nothing else till after earnings
Market has turned into a major pump and dump. Long this virus goes on the longer the bear market will have control. These stocks are moving cause Trump says he wants to profit off banning china from owning companies after China owns 40% of the real estate in America. You is doing everything the wrong way and AOC is idiot she does not know what she is talking about.$SPY $WMT $HD $TSLA $MSFT $AAPL
Trying it's best to reclaim the 50 sma. Volume should pick up here
It’s hard to believe that a great business and stock would be this volatile
Thanks for another $1.50 dividend. A nice present would be a split!
Let’s see if we go over 200 today.
The government should really start looking into theses kinds of frauds and thefts instead of wasting time with partisan issues going nowhere and wasting taxpayers money Duhh
Sold my calls. Made $15k today. Still holding 25 shares strong. Thank you Jeff Bezos!
Christmas before last
"More bad news for HOME DEPOT !Broken up, the Refinance Index decreased 2% from the previous week to its lowest level since June 2016, while the seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 7% from one week earlier to its lowest level since January 2016.http://www.housingwire.com/articles/38367-mba-mortgage-applications-reverse-course-drop"
Well that 230 strike price on December 6th certainly isn’t looking very likely
Any predictions on just how low we'll go ???
Buy buy buy
"Carpet installation is FREE!! Yep, there are highly skilled installers out there who don't need a paycheck and they donate their time, vehicles, expertise and supplies for FREE!! No cost whatsoever. They just like doing it. So, when HD offers free carpet installation, don't worry about any hidden charges or gimmicks. It's just a bunch of installers who like to spend their days helping the populace."
Oversold...RSI 31
Gains
I would love to own twice as many Home Depot Shares and get to where I could buy more shares @ a reasonable price. I have had HD shares for 32 years. Every time HD splits good things happen quickly. I still own my first 98 shares purchased. I love Home Depot!
"Many HD stores are meeting and exceeding daily sales goals—the curbside pickup service is strongly contributing to sales, despite the shortened hours."
Next stop 245+ after a brief healthy correction. Cost missed trades at over 30 times earnings and is UP!! HD is best of breed and you just don't sell your long term winners. Follow that nut R to the poorhouse. He has all his milk money IN BBBY a stock down almost 90%. LOL
HD is down 4.94% to 213.63
"Hello boys , anyone remember Dumbo ( Jim Cramer ) screaming BUY, BUY BUY. WHEN ( HOME DEPOT ) WAS TRADING @ $182.00 TO $ 185.00 NOV.12"
Stock market is crashing. Won’t know how deep it’ll go..... don’t buy it or will regret...
RSI currently at 80.22! Insane..no retailers are buying at these levels all being held up by computer algorithms. Huge RED FLAG.
omg china mention china and people panic like its russia..Or is it russia and thet panic China..Always panic
algos have taken over the selling
"Home depot stores in Atlanta open reduced hours ,until 6pm are now extremely crowded,after the gov relaxed restrictionsSocial distancing is far from optimal-I hope they don't become sites of spread of covid"
been getting much better shopping experience at home depot without lining up outside in the scorching sun. now they even provide masks and sanitizer. definitely market indicators of buy buy buy $spy
Construction markets is declining.
HD PRPBABLY DROPS LOWER AS DOW DROPS A COUPLE HUNDRED POINTS
My biggest worry for HD is the FED is going to hike again and send the market into sustained bear territory instead of just a correction phase....sure feels that way...
Don't suspend my dividend
"covid-19 didn't hurt HD, AMZN too, plus HD things have more room to go up, if Fed keeping 0 rate, HD can reach $500 per share in 12months, because it's dividend can keeping high,"
GRWG is Home Depot of cannabis industry
5% off recent highs means now is the time to get back to buying this power HOUSE! Economy picking up and rates dropping is a Bull China shop situation!
there's no end in sight for new construction to slow down
great stock but I sold at 215 this thing has gotten a little rich as has the whole market
"I’m thinking the same way, time to blow this pop stop!"
"DJIA green, still sticking with 187.5+ for the day. 5% down was oversold for the day."
HD imho will beat earnings just like Nike did recently.
"Tool says, ""I am a retired military officer and I soundly support The Depot.""Wow, that's a failure of leadership. America probably spent $200K ""educating,"" this person named, ""Tom,"" assuming he is telling the truth.Any product of ROTC and/or a military academy has been grilled over and over and over about ethics, morality, gender sensitivity, racial sensitivity.That black guy next to you might be the one to give you a blood transfusion. That white guy might be the one to give you a blood transfusion.Tool suddenly sees The Home Depot as a yooge investment opportunity. Supports Trump, a lifetime draft dodger. Has no idea that The Home Depot contributed yoooge amounts of money to The Donald.Never mind that it is a widely accepted notion in Colorado that many, many, many Home Depot employees are illegals and install Home Depot products.Tool has a personal conundrum. Come after me, call me a liar and a crackpot, or ignore the teachings he was given through the military and soldier on by supporting The Home Depot, a known abuser of illegals, and continue to make a few bucks off of this company's dividend."
HD limiting face mask sales. Customers will RIOT!!! SEL SEL SEL!!!
"Cramer did a segment about HD, like it rides historically from here for the next 7-10 days."
Way oversold. Will go back in low 190's imo by late May. Home building just ramping up
Good day to all for now. Rich people like me don't spend all day on message boards! R would tell you that!...lol
"What a piece of garbage this stock is, can't wait to dump it!"
"LOL that Home Depot crushed expectations and had a temporary drop, and Lowe’s missed and pops 10%Makes total sense. HD will still outperform in the long run."
"HD in TX,LA & now FL...sales will be going up and up."
Why has Home Depot gone up so much while Lowes has been not really doing that much? Prefer Lowes myself because it's a better store and there are no illegal immigrants loitering in the parking lot. 
What is hurting HD is that they are leaning TOO FAR LEFT towards SELF SERVICE....imo...lol
Explain to this idiot was China tariffs don’t effect this stock? Ninety percent of the store is items from China
HD is actually up right now. Something must be wrong!
Seems to me this would be a perfect time for HD to exercise that 15 billion buyback program. Stock has done nada since earnings were announced
The last time HD did something like this it blew up. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awe-someSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
Congress people sold off your hard earned equities using inside information gathered before COVID-19 became DEADLY. Demand the entire list of all transactions that our coward congress made to benrich themselves over putting the people first in their thoughts and actions.
Futures is in big red. Looks like we're heading to another correction.
glad we closed with gains the stock has been beaten down since last earnings we will continue to gain stay strong stay long
Painted prints and sticky supports give us a stock that has an over built floor at 231$ and upside is a giant facade wall of worry that is easily climbed by any competent carpenter. We have 240$ in our sights tomorrow and 250$ next week...$300 is short distance away. We can do this ~ The Home Depot!
I don't listen to the analysts they are more wrong than right
Unacceptable !!!!!! Great earnings.this went to 185.90 just after. 7 AM. And now it is 181??? This is unacceptable!!!!
"If you come into my store, and I even suspect you are a Trumper, it's ""off to The Depot,"" for you. I don't need the business and I don't need to deal with Trumpers, since they are incapable of choosing a good product. Talk Trump? It's off to the Depot, where your products will likely be installed by illegals and good luck if anything goes wrong. You asked for it, you got it.So, let me head off the obvious, low IQ responses.1. No, I'm not a disgruntled, ex Depot employee. I get vertigo when I go near that dump.2. No, I'm not jealous. We have so much business that it's laughable. And much of it as a result of people who have had horrible experiences with The Depot.3. No, I am not an anti-American snowflake #$%$ I am a retired US Army Captain. I am sick to death of you Merika Merika Merika mutants who scream Merika and then have Chinese products installed by illegals.The Merika Merika Merika Trumpers who show up at my store need to be shown the rewards of hypocrisy. I will send them to The Depot and let you deal with them."
I like home depot I go there all tje time but ..... its not going to do anything any more . I'm considering a short
HD still got way more down sliding to do do. $145 is the target before any really bounce.
Long..
really nasty market.
HD stands up to the lying leftists about the Georgia law. I will continue to own this amazing company
Is a split coming?
Just bought this morning This storm is castrophic bigger than Harvey Billions in damage and rebuilding Supplies will come from home depo and Lowe’s
"I’m still happy to own this stock Long. It’s been good to me the past few years, I don’t see it going away, oh by the way I see Contractors in my HD often."

Management... Analyst Conference is a great time announce a stock buyback.Just a thought.
"I've read a comparison analysis of Lowe's and Home Deposit, and looks like HD is a good investment which will hold a market share in this industry, here's the link to the article https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/082218/home-depot-remains-better-value-lowes?t=yfdaiana"
Public Service Announcement:HD at 303Please be advised all SHORTS——>Cover!

Buy at 196
Did the co-founder know Trump is a YUUUUUUUGE sinner?
Sam was right !
"Hurry Buy, Buy , Buy and prove me wrong Should be fun to see what happens on Tuesday. LOL LOL,LOL Should go higher even on bad news just like the market is doing with CSCO's news telling you things are slowing and CEO are starting to hoard money LOL,LOL,LOL Market is for sure not a normal market , Only question is when all the hype and hot air come out you for sure don't want to be the one standing there holding all the over priced stocks."
I like Home Depot. Solid company with consistent results.
junk rallied?
Play Ball !
"When everyone gets over the treasury and rate, this will go above 200 again. Solid company with great business plans. Can’t find a single credible reason about the company itself that would make HD go down."
Glad it's down today. Cup and handle forming on chart 
could run a bit if we can break 300 - its a meaningless number technically but...
omg why is the ceo aloud to short sell his own Co? Drving the stock lower everyday!!@
hd spring...late but hang tight..200 is right around the corner
HD is officially in the BUY zone. Watch for a move to $160.00 as we approach earnings May 16. This is one great stock for years to come. Call options on the move lately along with great reviews and price targets.
Took a short position today at 170 for this company is way overvalued and in trouble
This is an overbought $100 stock.
178 by friday
I am looking for a great quarter and run up from there
"lowes...beware!.....these boycotters are mostly ""shoplifters"""
Same thing happened to Apple
Where is @Dave? He had a pretty big mouth this morning too...
"Drove 7 miles each way more to shop at HD, cause the local store is over run in parking lot will illegals looking for work, selling oranges in the parking lot etc, long lineslike to buy this in 230's"
ANALIST CNBC SAID 8 HOURS AGO TO SELL MSFT!!...LOL
u won't see a pullback it's a bubble
Come on 200 I want to cover my short
HD is going to do 10% more sales in Q4 than expected just from Hurricane Michael
HD Managers in Florida said on TV that their shelves will be stocked again Thursday and Friday for those who still need lumbar and other items for preparation for Hurricane Irma and then later Hurricane Jose.
GREAT STOCK!!! Hope I get to lose more money.
Bottom ??
where is everyone?
"I went into Home Depot the other day, nobody cleaning carts, no sanitizer for the carts, when I went up to the checkout, just the self checkout was open, the lady told me to use the open spot, l asked her if she cleaned the screen, her response was, we do that about every hour, she told me that she would run all my items. Just saying, it’s all about making a buck, there not worried about anyone getting a virus!!!"
It’s pretending like it’s going to go up getting ready to drop a buck or two 
"Now say the virus passes without within 2 months, everything should snap right back and the market should roar. Right? But there is one other variable, $2 Trillion pledged to the economy. $2 Trillion is a whole lot of money. I rem not covering my short durring the last real estate bust after the $900 billion stimulus package was signed. My portfolio got destroyed. And the pain going up comes slowly. I goes down quick but recovers slower and very painful if you are shorting.. Down at the bottom of it it always seems like the end especially in the next 2 weeks, but 2 trillion should start working."
"Heading to 300. New pattern on beat earnings. Delayed about a week. I been studying this as a hobby. Lately, with few exceptions (apple maybe a couple others) one week after a beat in earnings is take off."
anyone hearing possible stock split for HD?

Did Australia just find world's biggest gold nugget
"I wouldn't buy this until after the coming correction in markets. Depends on the severity of market decent, I will wait to buy until after US President election. Markets will face a perfect storm with an over valued stock market. For this last earning report, many major companies have missed earnings and it will get worse in coming months. Tax dollars are cut by 17% and many people are not buying homes. Housing sales slumped will impact banks, markets, and Auto sales. They are already being affected as we speak. Two big ticket items are suffering. Homes and Auto. This means people don't have money to spend. It will be brutal when she starts moving down with 1000 point swings downwards."
"Don't be hung up on the number of shares you can buy or the share prices of companies that don't split their stock. The current philosophy is not to split company stock to keep the price at a certain level. That was a past philosophy that may come back in the future. Pick a company with a good future at a good price entry point. As the market is going down, keep an eye on an opportunity to buy and hold until something changes."
245-250 is coming for this very best of breed co imho!! Lowes downgraded because they can't keep up!
"Wow, HD is approaching a 3% yield. I f this pre-market holds for a bit I'm gonna have to git sum.."
great gains what a quarter
ATT this is the start of our chrismas RALLY IT GOING ON NOW GET IN AND RIDE TO THE TOP GOING UP VERY HEAVEY VOL
HD is in a free fall
"this doesn't make sense for the huge drop last 3 days, no reason for it"
"HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMFrom Bloomberg Economic Indictors link..The Federal Reserve inadvertently released what is a weak July industrial production report about a 1/2 hour early this morning. Headline production rose 0.2 percent vs expectations for 0.3 percent with manufacturing output showing outright contraction, at minus 0.1 percent vs Econoday's consensus for a 0.2 percent gain. Capacity utilization hit expectations at 76.7 percent.A 3rd straight decline in motor vehicles, down 3.6 percent in July, held down the month's production. Excluding vehicles, manufacturing rose 0.2 percent. But also not helping were business equipment, down 0.5 percent in the month, and ****construction supplies***, down 0.4 percent <<<<<<<<<<<<<<"
"$149 at the OPEN tomorrow and $152+ at the CLOSE tomorrow. Its already moving in the after-hours and hope everyone here started or added to their position. Its all a reaction to an unwarranted assumption. This is the time to buy when all others are fearful of ""nothing""."
Anyone showing interest in the dip ??
positive green close highest of my list lets keep it up
Lets go Home Depot up 26 % last year. lets do it again this year. January effect should kick in. Think positive I am.
No worries. Executive compensation will not suffer one bit. You can bank on that.
Very Bullish. Thank you Pres Trump 2020
All we need is some more analyst perspective
HOLD!!!!
Four slightly different links... I'll bet if you go to them you'll get put on some one's email forever list
I guess I pulled the trigger too early. Off $30 from high thought it was a bargain
HD is self destructing its good employees with their new work schedules . HD have used its employees as rag tools. There are many employees who are quitting HD because HD changed their shifts and disrespected their good workers who has been at the company for years. HD have given new employees preference to choose their shifts while they destroyed their loyal older Employees who have been with the Company for decades. Many people who have been at HD are quitting and store sales are heading down. It is because of lack of management and respect for HD loyal employees. Management needs to address this or else HD will fall.
"So, it's a well accepted fact that The Home Depot uses labor shops to provide illegals to install flooring and other products.If you dispute this notion, you are a rube who simply wants to make money off of illegals whilst supporting Donald ""Cadet Bonespurs,"" Trump.Take a side, Trumpers. Don't keep lying about supporting Merika, getting rid of illegals and all that. You ARE THE PROBLEM."
Call Options are ramping up here lately on both LOW and HD. Another big earnings beat coming in May. Buying more if I can but I see going higher till earnings. Safe place to put your money in any kind of market.
ex dividend next week...think we are up from here.
Last week Cramer claim some analyst had seen a pattern when HD ALWAYS had a pop. LolTake Cramer’s recommendations like a grain of salt ...
Just spoke to the store manager and he said they shouldn’t even be open at this point. Business is horrible and the added costs are crazy. He said he would shut the store if it were up to him. No contractors coming in either. He said “I guess there goes my bonus this year”. Why am I putting my employees in harms way for this silliness we’re his words.
either debt should be lowered or dividend should be higher
"Down in pre-market, probably because of dividend. My guess: up by end of day."
Will there be a selloff in the first week of Jan....due to profit taking and lower taxes next year?
BigJoe needs to get some fresh air and get out of mommies basement a little more!
Great day looking for continued gains going into the quarter results
Wonderful day to announce earnings
"“ HD will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, HD is projected to report earnings of $2.60 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 14.04%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $30.31 billion, up 17.56% from the prior-year quarter.”. Zacks article Feb9."
I do not think HD can be own at these levels. It has become an nightmare
Temporarily
Why do we have to wait until feb 23 to announce a big buy back. Notice LOW closed higher yesterday. We closed down $6. What is the difference? LOW announced an incremental buy back last year we did not because HD Supply. The HD supply deal is now closed.... comeHD Mgmt help your shareholders. You bought your new toy and associates got big wage hikes. Do something for your shareholders PLEASE.

The real fact is the Government is making a very big change to one of the biggest blocks of money that is invested. in the stock and bond markets. That is why the very big drop in rates was the big money moving to safety. I would look for big out flows to start after Sept 15. because of the changes the Government has made . Why very big pot of money that is invested and more millionaires than any other pot of money. They can get to their money finally. Very big change for them. All part of the DEM wit plan to destroy America to win a election .
What happened to liberals boycotting $HD? 
Yellen says today rates will go up.....Real estate will slow and this will stall go down.....just saying!
"Here we are AGAIN sitting at $288, we been here before many time and then HD drops back down to $260. BUT I THINK THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT!! This will be the time HD breaks resistance and start to climb over $300. We are hitting this level after record housing starts and the upcoming Spring season. These factors should bode well for upcoming ER expectations, and it will be the anticipation of solid earnings report that will finally drive HD to the elusive $300 price.So do not sell if the MM try to drive HD back down, we can do it this time....we deserve HD to return us investors some better profits and a continued momentum to new highs and a stable support once we get past $300.Good Luck!"
"HD is a good company. However, if this continues to get pumped in the morning, I will be dumping it. I suggest you do the same... you know... after I dump mine first. ;-)You can always climb back onboard at the next stop.Here is my HD concern.There is a lot being expected from them beyond simple EPS this quarter. What is their guidance going forward? All the COVID-19 PPE costs? HD went above and beyond in my opinion. So will that hurt their bottom line and which quarter will/did that hit?"
"Bot 215 6/21 calls yesterday .97. Up very tasty, may hold until eod Friday, looking for at least 15% more upside"
Have a great weekend should be another red week next week. I might even buy a few things at home depot while I short the hell out of it.good company just overdone like the rest of the market.I'll be waiting for 20 percent move to the downside.
"Tomorrow morning is gonna be a game changer. I wish I had shares, still wanna watch the price action. Good luck to all longs"
Next March dividend will exceed $1 per share. Last bump went from 69 cents to 89 cents

Market Realists are paid scammers / bashers to drive the stock down for no reason.
"HD has been away-oversold. At this level, buy and hold it and you will be rewarded."
HD is one of the only major companies to stand strong against the radical left's destructive agenda. Go today and buy more than you need! It's important to support companies like HD that have freedom loving people at the helm.
What happens to HD when LOW announces an exclusive strategic partnership with AMZN?
By supporting the employees they become more invested in the success of HD. Smart move. I am long

From $292 to $285. I guess everyone that bought it for Laura is puking it?
HD A 10% dividend increase bodes well for its future. Just look at royal dutch huge dividend cut for the first time since World War Two. Longs of the Home depot count your blessing! i am never selling. HD up over 512% THE LAST 10YRS and more then a double over the last five. Also go back in HD dividend History to see the yearly increases. This stock in any market is a keeper.
HD & LOW....What would we do without them??
"Outlook for HD hasn't been this good since the housing boom of 2004-2007. Valuation a question, but at 280 the stock should have legs to break 300 in the next few weeks."

Anyone thinking of jumping in...seems way oversold

HD shipping mega materials for hurricane Michael alone. Billions in sales . Great time to load up for the big run.
I just cant imagine what is NOT already expected of this stock by now? perhaps this market is leaning on the consumer too long and too hard
If you need plywood before a storm .. extra nails or screws in middle of a project .. new tool or blades.. you don’t Amazon .. you run to a Home Depot
Sell this news!!!
"Affect buy tariff , HD has to raise up red flag!"
HD OVERVLAUED
held this 20 years now has treated me really well been reinvesting all divedends also will continue to hold and buy more as i have done for 20 years now
Wait til the markets react to the news China put out about scraping the trade agreement and increasing tariffs. Then again the FED will just prop it up I am sure.
"Would one of you Home Depot shills PLEASE explain how free carpet installation works. Explain to me how the installers go and pick up the new carpet, drive fifty miles to the customer's house, remove the old carpet and pad, vacuum (highly doubtful, but possible,) install the new carpet and pad and go home without being paid a cent. These installers provide their own time, materials, tools, gasoline, travel, disposal, EVERYTHING for FREE. IT'S ALL FREE!! It's just a hobby for somebody to spend 20 hours a day helping Home Depot."
I like my HD so much ..I like dividends so much..I even like to shop there even if I dont need anything just to get away from the wifey
Hoping I can pay off house with HD
what HD needs is a 4 for 1 split. This would make it about $75/share and it would explode past $100 overnight
Why so quite on this board anymore
Isolate and renovate - going 270 + tomorrow morning.
"I’m considering buying at this price, oversold"
Buy Buy Buy Everything is good Price hikes to pay more taxes.
R DID YOU FALL ON YOUR HEAR AS A CHILD BOY? 40YRS INVESTING U CLAIM AND U STILL MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER. THATS INSANITY RIGHT? HD IS THE CREAM OF THE CROP!! AND U BUY WEEDS!!
When is HD going to accept mobile payments?
Nice movement today continued growth hold long
"I have been to the Brewster, NY/Danbury CT HD store's several times all at different times of the day and I have to say I have never seen the parking lots and stores this consistently crowded. I spoke with the assistant manager in the Danbury, Ct store and he said wait till you see the next earnings report. Long term holder since the 1980's."
"I visited my local Home Depot today it looked like it was a pre covid day. Isles were busy, registers were ringing and they had enough staff around. I was helped immediately. Based on the registers alone it's a great sign that Home Depot is experiencing accelerated growth."
"hum that's what you think, or is it the next amazon for the big items it sells, plus deal with tesla... take a hint look deeper than the surface..."
What's going on with HD? this is insane
Downgrade based on month old reporting a possible expense matters ??
"HD has a fiduciary duty to shareholders to address accusations by CROC of sexual harassment, discrimination and unfair firings or layoffs. It is a duty to the shareholders to not put the company at risk of adverse legal action and costs. HD also has a fiduciary duty to it's Mexican employees to encourage them to seek alternate employment with which they are satisfied with their cash pay, vacation leave and other benefits. HD can encourage those who choose to go on strike to seek other employment by replacing them with others who are satisfied with the compensation offered by HD.HD's responsibility to the shareholders is to find the combination of cash pay and benefits which attracts and retains a qualified work force at the lowest aggregate cost. Those who go on strike are making a high-stakes bet that they can not be replaced at the compensation which they think is insufficient."
There are a lot of houses that are destroyed that will not be rebuilt.Much higher house insurance costs in hurricane areas will kill demand as well.And federal payments and insurance will take a long time to pay off.Some people will just get wise and will not rebuild.Do not plan on instant payoff.Most large contractors do not buy through HD.
"Insiders hardly own any shares, and the shares they do own and/or get gifted, they dump immediately, what's that tell you?"
Home Depot doesn't change because of holiday sales or downturns or up turns.Sales happen in all times. Homes need products that need repaired. HD is a magnet for sales.I can't see any reason why HD is down.
when are earnings?
Common sense tells us that many people are not physically shopping as they are self-isolating. Do we feel like they are shopping online more? Clearly HD is way undervalued - likely driving this move (along with the Fed stimulus). But is this rally really sustainable at this point?
180 here we come...
Number One Trending is Home Depot today!
"This market is telling us major capitulation is needed so we can flush out the system and get back to the new realitites. Rates rising, Dems won back the house, major gridlock, accusations. This is going to get ugly. I would not be surprised if HD hits a 52 week low. Just to let you know I am a 20 year stock holder of HD."
I need money for pot stocks
Home Depot Remains A Better Value Than Lowe’shttps://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/082218/home-depot-remains-better-value-lowes?t=null?t=al
HD has crossed over 200 5 times in the past 2 years only to drop. Hopefully the past 2 years has been consolidation and the 200's will be the new baseline for the next leg up. With the dividend and patience its only a matter of time.
I think we lost Jimmy?
HD also has a very good online presence. Will deliver to the nearest store with no shipping charge or deliver to your home. Amazon is not going to waive shipping cost on large items or it will be built into the cost
Total buying opportunity
Look at HD rally!!!

Down $10 overnight and nothing has changed but the selloff
190 is support and 200 is resistance
It's going to run
A decline of this size justifies a full audit.of their earning call
We just got an upgrade to $310 by Guggenheim. Stay strong longs!
The winners of today can be the losers of tomorrow. Remember when greed sets in the market could be looking at a top. Good company because so many houses need fixing up. Home Depot does not sell food so do not compare it to COSTCO. Housing is way overpriced in my opinion.

"Home Depot - it is about time for you to start to protect associates. My wife works in a store and she has now made the hard decision to not go in. There has been limited masks and gloves available to associates while sales of all items goes through the roof. Basic C.D.C. guidelines like 6 feet social distances are not established. There are numerous precautions that should be taken immediately including:- stopping temporarily all returns - limiting customers during certain hours to just contractors- pushing online sales for safe parking lot delivery outside the store- considering installing plexiglass dividers between associates and customers - establishing 6 foot lines for cashiers, service desk, etc. - providing adequate masks and gloves"
"Weather has been hot in Florida (80s.) Was in my Depot this morning. Longest line I ever saw at the paint desk. 15+ people. The line snaked around 2 sides of the desk and down the aisle. Garden center had cars lining the fire lanes loading plants/mulch/soil. Store was packed. What a great time to do those longer DIY projects, with extended time working/staying home. The Lowe's across the street had a packed parking lot, too, as I went to the grocery store next to them. Inside the grocery store was only mildly busy compared to HD.I got a text from Lowe's saying ""As an essential retailer, we're open and ready to help."" I'd imagine both will be open, with reduced hours, throughout whatever shutdowns occur. Really surprised these two stocks have not held up better, like a TGT or WMT."
I'll take today's increase any day strong company best of my bunch at close
Disappointing construction spending number offset any upside from the earlier news re optimism for trade deal met. HD seems to overreact more than many other stocks to anything related to housing or construction.
Nothing has changed but Guggenheim comments just more bs
We're broke thanks to crooked Trump.
How you boys doing in HDcoin
Some doctors r saying that masks are terrible for healthy people the fact that HD is uforcing people to wear masks is based on what ? Junk Science and a violation of constitutional rights. U may have to prove in court that its necessary . The lock down is the greatest FRAUD in history

BUFFETT MADE OVER 1 MILLION PERCENT FOR HIS SHAREHOLDERS BY BUYING AND HOLDING GREAT COMPANIES. HD UP OVER 512% ALONE OVER THE LAST 5YRS. LONG TERM HOLDERS ARE VERY RICH. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE SAME COMPANIES HD MSFT AAPL KEEP GETTING BID UP? BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST. YOU NEVER GET FIRED FOR OWNING HD MSFT OR APPLE JUST IN TIME RICHER. BECAUSE THE BIG GET BIGGER.

"If there is a stock recommendation I could make to young people. It is Home Depot. I purchased 98 shares of HD in the mid 1980s. My wife and I wanted to have a even 100 but, we were only able to buy what we could. This was a lot of money to us at the time.We were not able to put any more toward HD for 10 years. We had to put our money toward regular bills in the those 10 years. We started buying more shares starting in 1995. We did it with a drip plan and have never purchased any shares except by a drip plan."
I guess no one cares that $15 billion in damage is about to occur on the south east U.S and HD will be a big part in rebuilding
China is starting to cave!
Deer AIIah pleeze make HD stock drop down by 25 % so at $ 115 pur share I can buyed maybe 1000 HD shares ....AIIahahha Akabar Pakistan iz grate...
anyone think HD call options are cheap now?
"If HD drops some, so be it. You are getting fantastic dividends even when the stock price drops some. If your in a divy reinvestment plan you are still buy stock when the price drops some and getting the lower price."
Sell your shares at this point in Home depot and buy Lowes
If you look at the charts you see several times a retrace to this level and then a bounce back to 285++ no reason for the decline so we should see it pop back very soon
"HD, looks to be overvalued at this price Not sure how awesomeS-TOCKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy."
DON'T BUY FROM HD ONLINE THEY'RE AWFUL. I BOUGHT BUTCHER BLOCK LAST DEC. 28/19 AFTER PAYING $350 PLUS MY BILL SAYS ITEM SHOULD BE AVAILABLE JAN. 3-9. UNTIL NOW IT WASN'T AT HD STORE. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT FROM LOWS OR LUMBER LIQUIDATOR AS MY CONTRACTOR SUGGESTED....TERRIBLE N AWFUL ONLINE STORE....

"I am afraid here we go again with breaking in above 200. HD has 72% of there shares owned by institutions. The institutions start selling and taking there profits. That pushes the stock price down. They start buying again and, the stock price starts moving up again. It seems to be a vicious cycle but, when institutions own so much of the company it happens"
"If no WMT big down today, HD will be sky high..."
HOME DEPOT UP +3 WILL BEAT THE STREET TOMORROW.
so glad i bought when everyone was freaking about amazon eating retails lunch when it bought whole food.
"Institutions will be dumping into the close, they already know earnings are going to be a bust plus Trump is renewing his attacks on China things are going to get ugly. A lot new bag holders will be born today."
Does Home Depot stock a solar shingle yet?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rgs-energy-powerhouse-3-0-133100444.html
sharty stock here
Panic
"When you buy flooring from The Home Depot, here's how it goes:You are processed like a white fish. If you want the details, I can explain.You have no chance at getting a good deal. There are legions of marketing and advertising people who get paid a lot of money to make sure you will get shaken down and ripped off. You are a victim.Search the internet for Home Depot flooring installation disasters and you might learn something.If you choose to buy from The Depot, you had better learn spanish, if you want to have any idea what is going on during your installation.If something goes wrong, you had better hire a big time lawyer and expect to wait months and lose thousands as they slow roll the claim. If something is wrong, you will spend thousands to reclaim a few hundred dollars as a result of a botched install."
"It would be a huge embarrassment if they sell off tomorrow, especially if the news are great. They stock price has been underperforming the market and the evolution of sales during the past several years."
LOL R ALL YOUR HOLDING ARE WAY DOWN!! BUY SOME HD......LOL
on the chart it doesn't show support till 167 level not sure if it will go there
Big box home improvement retails are good shorts. 24 month target price: $30
I personally don't believe that HD will beat those high expectations even if the business is doing well these earnings are higher than the forecast for the previous quarter with 14 cents if they beat them that will mean that the quarantine has not affected the business at all and that is impossible. Also all these americans that lost their jobs or their income dropped i believe will cut down on expenses. I will definitely short this stock and expect to drop in 15 days to about 210 at least even 200
"HD stock will either have multiple splits or be $300 a share within 18 months. Here is why, Global economic disasters will put nations at enormous strains. Natural disasters are being ignored by Governments and world leaders and many nations will face fierce Hurricanes, Floods, earthwakes. Global warming and it has already endangered the collapse of the Northe pole ice melting. No one can stop it, and the world will face it."
What I find interesting is even Credit Suisse has the projection for this stock to be over $200 - in their revised estimate they dropped it from $221 to $211 for the 1yr target estimate. But still the stock drops to $180??||| Someone will have to explain that one to me

"The stock market has gone crazy in the last couple of months. I am a person who has always gone long the last 25 years but the last couple of months have been horrible for me. Since mid Sept. HD has lost almost 40 points. if you own 1000 shares you are down almost 40K. The over all stock market is down 1750 points. I am not sure how close we are to bottom of this fall.I am getting close to the point of selling out of the market because of my age and enjoy my investments. I am not hurting at this point but if I were to sell now, I would be down quite a bit in just 2 months. HD has always been a big money maker for me because I paid as little as $25.00 a share over the years. If you want a stock you can retire later on, buy HD. The dividends are great. I just reinvest my dividends. The DRIP plans are the greatest things since sliced bread. I would feel a lot better if the market takes a turn upwards for the next 6 months. Young people buy HD and hold, you will be happy you did. DRIP plans are the greatest."
Low is up 1.40 now . go go HD
Home developers like Pulte and KB cannot keep up with demand. There are at least 6 developments near me that Pulte/DiVosta has in progress. The builder gets much of its supply through HD....upcoming ER will run HD over $300.
"Hurry Buy,Buy,Buy and prove me wrong LOL,LOL,LOL I am the greatest fool there has ever been because I can see the future and the Wall Street CROOKS in action, So this fool and his money is NEVER EVER parted , Only sell the rips and NEVER EVER buy the dips or you will be the fool stuck with this way over priced stock"
"The market is punishing HD for investing in the future of its business, going long"
"Another day, another billion untrained illegals set off to install inferior, Chinese made Home Oh Depot junk flooring. Meanwhile, the company yacks 24-7 about America this America that while they sell you out to the Pacific Rim."
kind of sideways today
I didn’t know HD was in China!
The USA is getting sucked into a Recession here.....due to trade wars and rate hikes
Amazon ain't saving Florida. HD will and is Amazon proof.
Might HD go away?
I was at H D d2 days agoHad to stand in line to get in

**ALERT**Home depot earnings this week !I predict they LOWER GUIDANCE for next QUARTER ie WARN !It will drop AT LEAST 15-20 Dollars per SHARE and you will say Why did I not sell when I could have with limited upside ?Answer:You got too greedy and ignored the warnings from the other retailers thinkingHome depot is different and always goes up even when ridiculously overvalued..
"From $3000 in 1990 to $440,606 now Thank You Home Depot for helping my early retirement at 60!!!"
Projection on Div increase? The easy guess is $6 - $7 for a %16 raise. Less than recent years but still fabulous.
"guys, the short term...consumerism is high, Home Depot will have lots and lots of customers. Quit your doom and gloom."

Huge market selloff in progress !amzn tsla nvda hd on deck
"own HD and Lowe's stock, but HD has decided you are not a vet unless you retired. or active duty. on the other hand Lowes welcomes vets business. they are right across the street from each other. 10 percent discount pays the ta es."
HD is down -5.07% to 181.59
"It was overpriced, should fall another 15% here."
HD is down 8.63% to 158.65
LET THE PEOPLE IN!!GIVE US A SPLIT!!!
They already sell Kenmore online at Sears right ? Why would this make a differences? It's just more zing money mangers paying people to say some negative II order to mini pulse this great company and stock robining the small investors
"I'm a long term holder. With all the past long ago splits, my cost is now $16 per share. Would like to see a split again."
finally saved enough money and on the HD train. go luck to us longs! .....That felt good.
despite people think hd should do well it's still hovering the low and not able to break out to the up side
Hopefully HD wont be affected by all these online shoppers.
My morning: Place small HD order at 179. Then go to HD and purchase a new dishwasher. - expect it to drop because every time I add to my position it drops more. It could be worse - like when I sold HD and bought SQ
great gains for the last 6 months as a long who added at March lows lovdn it

Stop freaking out. Once in a while stocks do go down.
Goes down with great earnings?
"Walmart up, and Home Depot down, disappointing. This is a highly profitable company, ready to boost its earnings with reopening, and actually at a low price."
To think this was trading in low $20s exactly 9 years ago. In hindsight it makes sense as housing got crushed by financial crisis and then Govt bailed it out. Just wish I had the clear 20/20 vision of hindsight. It’s only up 8 fold. I could be living well on the equivalent dividend. Oh well. Better luck next life!
"wayne dalton doors....The builders love those doors because the prices are lower than the better quality 1.5"" fully insulated steel doors with steel on both sides. They probably spent millions coming up with their goofy spring/s inside a long tube idea, not to mention the millions they spent on an opener that attaches to that tube, which is no longer available, thank heaven. Half the doors out there have that spring setup and the other half has the convention torsion/ extension spring setup. Those springs break over time and we change out a lot of them with a conventional torsion spring setup and carry all the parts needed on our two trucks. They require one or two torsion springs, depending on the weight of the door. Two end bearing brkts, one center brkt with bearing and the torsion tube. Total parts needed runs about 40 bucks and with one installer takes less than an hour. we charge 220 bucks for the job, while others charge 600 bucks or more, depending on what car you drive or how big your house is. we did one changeover on a double wide door one time and later, i went into the Ladies kitchen to get a check. She had a company out earlier that wanted to charge her 600 bucks, so luckily she told him to leave. The guy called back while she was writing out the check and said he would do it for 500 bucks. We both had good laugh about that...."

how much exposure does HD has on china trade war?
"Definitely overpaid in the $270's, but it kept hovering up and down at that level for 3 months. Figured after all the consolidation it would bounce up after earnings, but I guess I was wrong. It sucks seeing it go down so much in two days, but HD will be back. Will just have to wait another quarter to break even, hopefully."
"It may touch $330, but it’s going to end in the red. Take profits..."
Cramer said to invest after the downgrade today
Does anyone know exactly what time Tuesday 2/20 earnings are released? I think the earnings call usually follows and start at 9:00am. I am thinking of picking up some shares in the pre-market session before the earnings release.
Bunch of greedy clowns in here. 10% run up in the last month and you want more lol
I guess wait till the next analyst blogs their positive perspective
i just unloaded long positions -- house prices taking a 5% hit and that means boat loads of wealth coming out of everyone's pocketshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/worst-time-deficit-financed-tax-cuts-134224626.html
Over priced for sure
Why the stumble after the strong start?!
"Won’t keep going up vertically for long, overall market including HD are overextended. I believe we will witness a 3-5% pullback by the end of the month which is only modest."
cash is KING....................get out of markets..............................
"So what, the stock beats on all numbers substantially and just because no splitthe stock is a dud?"
HD's starting to increase their store hours as it becomes apparent the virus has run it's course and the country can hopefully get back to normal if the politicians get the he|| out of the way.
wow this is on sale!
Now Cramer is saying wait to buy HD. I recall he said wait when we were hovering around $200. I'm glad I added more at $225 or I would have missed this nice price gain.
"WOW, HD blew away earnings. Get in while you still can. As market recovers today, expect some big gains"
Is it a buy now?????
HD is often the only green stock in my list. HD is often the only red stock in my list.I never really worry about it because they just keep making (more) money.
It wasn't too long ago they spun off HD Supply. Now they want to buy it back?!
Since it is a redux of 08-09 in the opinion of many shorts should I put in my limit order for $30 or $25? Asking for a friend....
"Remember to only sell the rips and NEVER EVER buy the dips. LOL, LOL ,LOL Told you construction is slowing and faster than most would think LOL"

"Awesome, going up"
"After higher gasoline prices, who has extra money for little projects?"
Down because Kramer is flapping his mouth on HD this morning...
"I have a hard time believing this company is worth 241 billion, they have no assets, other than the land and buildings there stores sit on. When I go in there to buy anything, I walk out with a little bag, that cost me over a 100 bucks, that’s why there loosing sales"
HD coming back. South east flocking stores for repair items.
Any explanation for why book value has dropped so much since 2013?
Funny nobody's pointed out the fact $HD is gonna see a spike as sales go up threefold or higher after Tropical Storm Barry passes through Louisiana and Mississippi
Home Depot reached an all time high at 277.86
Time to buy Hd stock .good change for go long when market down time buy
"SODA did the same thing on good earnings, then the day after, it shot up..."

I agree it’s a great company but the ETF’s are going to give many haircuts and will make most of your profits
SELL SELL SELL!!!
why is hd almost red ah ?
HD Total sales per sq ft 447.00 all time high. 52% of homes greater then 40yrs old. People have to remodel. It was the weather period. Just a great franchise period. Will add with new monies.
Earnings will decide price multiple when they report on May 16. This will justify PPS. Blowout earnings again when they report. To $ 160.00. Go baby!!!!!!!!!!!!
The collapsing stock market ERASING the WEALTH EFFECT and coupled with rising interest rates and record debt will shut down the home  improvement business and did I mention Trump tariffs on the 75% of items made in China that hd sells ?
If not for the 10 year yield this would be up $10
"I believe part of HD's sell off before today was no annoucement of a split. Soooooo GLAD I picked up a few shares today at 311 and change. Can't wait to buy even more if it breaks 300!! Nowhere else to put your $$$, plus HD gives a pretty decent dividend and is basically part of a 2 horse home improvement business!!"
"I took advantage of the recent pullback and opened a position and am new to this forum. I can report,first hand, that several of the Florida locations I have visited near me are both humming with business and well run with knowledgeable and helpful employees. GL"
"Revenue has flat-lined. Stock is overvalued, fair value points to a dividend around 3.8%. Get ready for a big haircut to put valuation more in line with historical standards."
On the upside there is only 100.00 more to go on the downside until it's just 50 percent over valued
construction is collapsing so I think would not buy until 120
HD is a stock to hold for a long time
"They killed it up and down, yet down all day Smh."

Head fake pre-market. $233.40 today.This board is crawling with foreign trolls. Strange.
Thank you Ken Langone. He muted expectations which made this report That much better! This has chance to be 300 yr end. Thx Pres Trump 2020! imo
Looks like the Russian trolls have control of this board. Cheering on a big box merchandiser that has 90% of its merchandise made in China is...patriotic?
when is HD going to perform every other stock is ripping higher
$220 by end of month
They need to split now to keep the share price up
Everything hd sells is from China the tariffs will cause all the junk stuff he sells to cost even more.. the lumber is even going up due to canada
Everything’s good at Home Depot
"Lowes means low variety low inventory low number of employees, low help, low number of stores low affordability... it’s just Lowe’s. Never liked the store! I love Home Depo! Diy is truly supported here with great pricing!"
no boycott here HD is a good place.
A German bubble with EPS. Down Big.
"The Hoe Moe Depot hires billions and billions of illegals to install flooring. The customers are hoot hoot hoot MAGA idiots who want illegals out of the country. The CEO of Hoe Moe Depot donated billions to Trump. This fiasco will never end, and it's because of the 70 IQ customer base. The Base."
good job in NY home depot! America thanks u. hope your profit s continue to improve
LOL I told you this is a New major down cycle and I told you to only sell the rips and NEVER EVER buy the dips until a new up cycle has started it will be months down the road before the down cycle has ended.
"Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) shares were dropping again on Wednesday, continuing a sell-off that followed a revenue miss, disappointing same-store sales and a downward revision to guidance.But several sell-side analysts said underlying trends point to a sales rebound, adding the company should see a benefit from IT upgrades making an argument for staying with the big box DIY retailer.Home Depot reported a third-quarter revenue miss and guided 2019 sales down for a second time, while also reporting softer comparable store sales, which drove the stock down about 5% after the print.The AnalystsWedbush analyst Seth Basham remains Neutral on Home Depot with a $230 price target.Baird Equity's Peter Benedict kept an Outperform rating on the stock and upped the target price from $230 to $245.Bank of America's Elizabeth Suzuki reiterated a Neutral stance and $235 price target.Wells Fargo's Zachary Fadem reiterated an Outperform rating and has a $260 target price.Several analysts noted Home Depot attributed its miss and guide down to slower-than-expected completion of IT work aimed at improving customer experience. Those improvements, while delayed, are still expected to come through, and when they do, sales improvements should follow, analysts said.Housing Trends Impact On Home DepotThe question for Home Depot remains the degree to which housing trends and lower interest rates will translate into demand. While housing market trends are mixed, several analysts said they favor Home Depot."
Rising interest rates are not good for housing market.
no brainer here just added more. HD is not going anywhere anytime soon.
iam long HD and will stay with it
Wow. I almost want to sell half my position in Home Depot and buy Lowe’s. They have been doing so much better than Home Depot. They are gaining ground on them very quickly. Home Depot used to be the stock to have versus Lowes.￼. I don’t think that’s the case anymore. Of course it’s only my opinion.￼￼￼￼￼
"Covid- Hd boomed! Double bonus wfh as well as strong online presence.No covid- best retail experience. Variety, availability inexpensive and best customer service.HD has become growth company. As a consumer, I am satisfied 9 out of 10 visits! Lowe’s - poor cust service, low variety and expensive."
I have owned this stock over 20 years. my avg cost for this stock is $52. this is one of the great ones that you buy and hold.
Why is the stock down on good earnings
check the 6 month chart up over 48$ sounds like a bunch of baby short traders not long term investors
Keep that unemployment check coming.Buy Buy Buy
HD will close at $ 190+ today.Jerome Powell has lowered interest rates twice in the past 2 weeks by a cumulative total of 150 basis points. The real estate market will be heating up very soon!!!
WOW! Reminding me of AAPL a few months ago - stock is on fire.
This all due to the negative publicity HD is getting from the corrupt news media...
Existing home sales fell unexpectedly yesterday and today new home sales fell unexpectedly as interest rates rise for mortgages..this cant be good news for hd can it ?the stores are empty HD is due for a big correction long ovedue imo...
$HD earnings miss: $2.08 vs $2.25 expected; Revenue beat: $28.26B vs $27.57B expected.
sell at 220 buy back at 201
Home Depot is down 8.21% to 195.41
"HD a quality company with strong fundamentals is down $24 since the open last week Thursday. 8 percent flash correction. So we know housing is very strong, we are in the middle of the peak of hurricane season, and the stock will probably split soon. Down $24 is unbelievable to me. We have very strong support at $250 and $265. We are due for at least a bounce. Again down $24 in 8 days folks and there is nothing wrong with the company and fundamentals are getting stronger. Go figure but I think it is a screaming buying opportunity."
Futures have HD down considerably after the poor outlook. I honestly feel HD went up way to much considering last quarters report...Something around 215 sounds better for this stock.
"Great company, good numbers but bad cc. You don't spew ""uncertainty"" upon releasing results!"
"Does anyone care that HD flooring installations are done primarily by illegals? Of course not. The Trump-ettes favor profits over truth. Trump will carry on at length about the wall and the illegals, but nothing will change. When money is involved, it gets very quiet, especially in the Republican world."
virus play TOMZ.... going higher and higher . check it yourself
Hotel dhaka booked 2019
it is time to get in after HD pulled back under 2 points. HD will be the big winner for the storm season.
Long term holder what happened today?
It’s been hovering around here for a few days
Only thing changed is the analyst convinced some to sell Hd and buy Low or others
It's kind of poetic justice. This company depends so heavily on illegals and Chinese made junk.The old CEO donated $30M to The Donald. (why?)$30M goes pretty quickly when you give it to a Trump. It's probably already been spent on golf.
"Phrase of the day that effect the trade of this stock is, Market sustainability."
This stock is on fire!!!!
"I see a green light a end of the day, anyone else saw it too? Give me "
Put Traders strike again. Just sell everything you can get your hands on until you break even. Than run the stock back up. SEC where are you????
Spring is here Garden shop goes crazy and don’t forget the Hurricanes New decks and remodeling projects HD not Amazon$$$$
To $200 again
We have a higher high yesterday and a higher low today as long as it doesn’t break down further than it’s current price.
"Open Letter to Bernie Marcus: ""Use your stupid brain to give your stupid tax breaks to Americans and stop using illegals.""OMG, what a horrible, hate filled company. What Democrat would shop there after being insulted by this pencil necked supporter of illegals."
Need a storm door going to HD. They come out and measure for 30 dollars. You get it back once you buy. I like that. They honestly do put the customers first a fine company.
HD beat on Revenue over a BILLION. Just wait for Guidance this is going to ALL TIME HIGHS
Got a new place and I shopped at Home Depot all weekend...lines in San Diego are out of control ...let’s go
Why isn’t it up on the Citi target change?
Weird price action today. Just went down and stayed flat. Very odd
"Cramer, taking advantage of this pull back, bought HD today. If you like Cramer see my Facebook group, "" ACTION TRADERS"". Adios."
"Longs, you have ""Negative Shareholders Equity."" That means that liabilities outpace assets. You own less than nothing.Home Depot owns very few of its own stores and very little of its inventory. There are few assets. Yeah, ""the brand,"" has value to some people. To me, the brand means mostly cheaply made, imported junk, but I guess to some it means good value.My local hardware store (thank God they weren't able to snuff out these guys,) has far superior products and services and is within 5% price wise on just about everything."
"Red white and blue on the outside, brown on this inside. This company profits mightily off the use of illegals. Very disappointing to see Trumpers line up one behind the other and curse illegals while they unapologetically pimp this stock."
Can anyone mute this bum
I'm long and a few $ up this week is awesome
"Consolidation near completion, watching for the breakout."
Volumes is dead so it’s a scam pump and dump
Buy at 170
No stock split coming
Buying some HD Jan calls. EZ money
"Soo many bag holder, I shorted 277 will cover 249 and thank you long for easy money"
"If you think big funds will hold this stonk believing it will hold this crazy price, you are just naive, they are trying to pump it as much as possible and then they will sell all in one day causing 50% drop"

Ann Schreiber never earned more then 4k a year. yet when she passed at age 101 had 22 million. She just bought good companies at a reasonable pps and reinvested the dividend. had 60% stocks 30% bonds and 10% cash when she died. Google it. Point is I don't care if hd goes up or down near term. Great buy great companies at a fair price. All imo do your own dd.
Will close new-intra-day high today: $192.5+
"LOL looks like I am the greatest look at BBBY screaming higher and HD will be going lower LOL, LOL, LOL"
Very good article on Yahoo news by the Market Realist comparing Lowes and Home Depot. Worth a read. excerpt:
Home Depot revenue might see a recovery in Q2 https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.alphastreet.com/earnings-preview-home-depot-revenue-might-see-a-recovery-in-q2/amp/
240 end of week!!
"Negative Shareholders Equity. Buy with both hands, Trumpers. You hired billions of illegals and you deserve it.COVFEFE!!!!!!!One of a handful of bloated stocks with negative shareholders equity. You own less than NOTHING!!!\COVFEFE!!!!"
How far will it drop after ex divy?
This might drop under 300 next week.
"Remember to only sell the rips and for sure NEVER EVER buy the dips this run in the market is now over and the new down cycle has started. If you not in cash yet still not to late before the crash, The S&P 500 will not bottom until around 1500. Anyone buying now will only lose lots of money , The recession has already started. Just not in the data yet but will be very soon. LOL, LOL, LOL The market should bottom in March of 2021."
Careful longs. Big Leaguers are getting ready to short this baby back down 216.50 is the bottom Bollinger.
"If you are a Home Depot long, don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever complain that somebody you know lost a job to an illegal.If you are a Home Depot long, think three or four times before spouting, ""build that wall build that wall build that wall."" As a harborer of illegals, do you realize how stupid you look? You give illegals work, protection and money and then stand there yapping about building that wall. OMG, what a farce."
"Shut up about your wrong politics, Marcus!"
"Bearish divergence continues on all time frames. Lots of Put Options on high interest. Based of previous downtrends, still have 5 to 6 more businesss days before there is confirmation for longs."
Same as always. Nothing new here.
Is there a split soon?
"Eh? OH!! HD is again heading back up to $178!! Come on people don't pay higher for Home Depot stock... Place your ""buy limit"" order @ or below price... Hurry change your order."
why is it doing so good today? don't see any news anywhere?
BIG JOE calls the shots
Any publicly traded company that doesn't completely crush earnings and provide guidance that is off the charts is getting blasted..unfortunate and irrational new reality in today's markets...makes me a little nervous...
Over reliance on self checkouts short term will be problematic. Changing their pro desks to the self checkout format just plain stupid. Fire the guy that thought that up.
Are earnings out? Down premarket.
I would hate to see what Home Depot is going to do if the market starts to go down. Had a choice to buy 250 shares of Apple at $200 or 250 shares of Home Depot at $200. Sorry I did not pick Apple. Would have been 20 grand ahead right now. And headed up words.￼￼￼￼ I don’t know if Home Depot is what it used to be profit wise. Might sell and buy all Apple.￼￼

My husband worked for HD for 18 years. Best thing he did was start purchasing stock on day one. Great company.
Lowes seeing slowdown in home improvement business..hmmmmmmmmmmhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowes-lay-off-125-workers-191141062.html
"LOL told you things are now slowing and the consumer has stopped spending. LOL I was right again when I told you it would start showing up in the data, Retail Sales DOWN .3 %, LOL That is nothing just wait until you see Oct's numbers. Why because the DEM wits are now calling around and asking people to stop spending and cause the markets to crash so they can when in 2020"
It’s over guys We will test 180
"Negative $3.1 billion in shareholder equity, folks."
Cold shower is necessary today.
Are earnings announced before market opens tomorrow?
"Fascinating. Home Depot's shareholder equity is negative. As a long, you own less than nothing. In other words, the company has more liabilities than it does assets. Does this mean that longs actually owe somebody money?"
What embarrassment up $4This is how they screw investors
"Third day in a row can't get over $328 resistance...increased my short. Gonna retrace now. Buyers had it good, but pigs get slaughtered."
a gift from the trading Gods folks. load April calls
I don't go to The Home Depot to browse and hangout. I go to buy something 100% of the time....and so does the other bazillion people in my neighborhood. The place is always crowded...negative numbers are not adding up.
I’m all in. Time to reap the benefits of an open economy and HD 300+ gain!
This stock will be $265 by 2020
HD Mgmt team how about increasing the buyback? Exhaust the current one and announced another large buyback. Also since people and you claim that employees are more productive after all the raises this year.... how about trimming employees? You know.... start doing your job!
Kudlow just announced trade talks with China are back on the table
Yeah they just made enough to pay the increase and dividends
Absurd how this is going down today after wonderful earnings report 
We should close around $211.35
With their earnings surprised it’s down today. Very low new home starts so people will be doing a lot more remodeling. May be down today but a see it increasing for the a long time being at least. I’d like to see a stock split to bring share prices down and I believe that will bring in even more buyers.
I think earnings will be massive.
"I'm no math major, but some dolts bought this kkkkrap at $207 bucks a share.I have a few words of consolation for those anti-American dopes who bought into the dream at $207 bucks a share: I hope you lose it all. I hope you bought on margin and I hope you tried to use this anti-American company to pay for your kids' college. I hope they end up at a community college.This company is simply a marketing scheme that has tried to kill off local stores for decades. This company is not your friend. It is not your buddy. It is simply a marketing formula that hires as many illegals as possible and sells as many Chinese products as it can get away with.The Home Depot is not your pal. It is an algorithm. It is a computer program that tries to rake in money for the principals and deal with as much negative feedback as it can stand until this negativity gets to the top and bothers the ultra-wealthy executives who simply want a peaceful ride on their brand new 3M million dollar yacht."
Heavy Put option Volume on Expiring options.
4 MORE BUSINESS DAYS TILL EARNINGS
Another curveball to the market is this Friday's option expiration is a triple witching one! More volatility!
"Well, if the kitchen cabinet/sink& countertop experience myself and a couple of my customers are enduring is any indication, a sell-off cannot hurt. They are happy to get the $$ upfront, then do not return a call for 6 weeks! I get a call to let me know the install will happen in 5 days, only to get a FOLLOW-UP call to inform me ""oops, we cracked your sink and will need to re-order."" The fact that all the labor is sub'ed out is irrelevvant to ME."
Ok I’ll throw it out there as a prediction. 205 in 2 weeks! It’s supposed to move 4% on earnings and may do. Realistically though it’ll beat and move up.
if they announce a 3 for 1 split....after earnings....it will blow thru $300.00 easy. This stock has been anointed as the king of sheltering stocks.....
My grandpa got in 30 years ago
It’s definitely a good report unless someone makes a negative consensus
"Man this is way worse than I originally thought. HD will be rollin' around under 20 bucks btw end of next week. This is the once in a 500 year crash, a rare set of bad circumstances that hit all at once, that causes a cataclysmic collapse. See ya next week under 20 buck, where I'll be scooping people's blownout stocks for pennies on the dollar, hehe. Thanks."
"HD has never been a rich man’s stock, you should split, then your regular home owner who buys your plumbing can afford to buy into this great stock."
Warren Buffet is on the prowl for a major elephant size acquisition. His favorites are consumer staples. Does anybody think maintenance and renovations would fit that bill. I am curious whether HD or LOW would go private under him.
"Kill two birds with one boycott, HD and tee time tweeto.!! Invest with HD lose $$. You don't call 1\2 the country stupid and not pay a price.!! that's for you Bernie, MORON!!!"
"Torsion Spring changes....Too many garage doors out there have springs INSIDE a long tube and they brake and the customer calls. We work on these all the time and change them over to regular torsion springs. A customer called Monday and we took that mess down and replaced it with other parts and ONE long torsion spring. The first call he made to another company and they wanted 1000 dollars to change the springs out. Other companies have charged 800. The job usually takes about 30-45 minutes and we did it for 250 bucks plus tax. GOD BLESS AMERICA and the WORLD....oh yea....If you don't LOVE GOD,you are in DEEP trouble...."
"The Home Depot uses billions of illegals. The CEO gives $30M million dollars to Trump. Amazingly, no illegals are removed from The Home Depot's installation division.Home Depot longs are like, Merika Merika, Lokker Up, Merika, Burf Certificate. Send them back, back to where you come from, send them back.All this send them back Merika stuff and The Home Depot hires billions of illegals. Every day, every week, illegals."
I'm seeing a d/e ration of 5.45. Doesn't that concern you guys at all? They have 2.5 time the debt they had this time 5 years ago.
HD will rally into their earnings next week!! GO HD GO!!!
Keep buying pleaseBut don’t be the last buyer. Thanks
"Many years ago (early 1990s ) I bought 300 shares of HD for my IRA , they had 98 stores. I chose to help my employees out and sold it 1 1/2 years later. Do the math close to 350,000 shares now.maybe more...lol I am just now starting to buy it again...Ya i don't help people any more."
wmWhen you've gotta board up your windows who you gonna buy the wood from?Yup... that's right.. HD
EPS will be $2.36 on $27.8 billion in revenues. Guidance will be lowered. Trades $220 tomorrow. Waters runs naked through the streets of Roanoke.
Everything is great until it isn’t. Wall Street giveth and it taketh away.
Looks like the August 19-20 gap at 207 is going to get filled...
"1 last thing boys....and this is my true belief...and been trading for 27 years,So take it for what it is,I'm not trying to pump this stock (actually have puts) BUT out of every stock and company out there & through this whole ""covid"" crisis HOME DEPOT is ALWAYS packed and cant see why it would even loose 1 dollar even on a day where the market is down 2000 HD should be up!!! strong company and I will most definitely by shares for the long haula"
Any chance of a split soon
"FAUX Sports made one interesting comment. In the past thirty years, New England teams have won 37 major sports titles and Atlanta teams just one. Yeah, that's kind of lopsided, and the south is pretty bad at winning or inventing or developing anything. Funniest thing is. When the Braves won that sole MLB title in 1995, who was the winning pitcher? Tom Glavine from Boston (actually, Billerica,) Mass."
Thanks too all the old guys building skateboard ramps in their backyards!!!!!
HOUSING STOCKS ARE STRONG TODAY MORE $$$$ FOR THE HOME DEPOT. DON'T BELIEVE ME CHECKOUT DHI LEN HOV.
"Try this HD. Change your symbol to AMZN and claim that you are intentionally keeping expenses high to upgrade your network and avoid taxes. Boom, up 10% instead of down."
HD BEST OF BREED JUST RAISED ITS DIVIDEND 10% IN THIS MARKET. COMMON SENSE IT IS A KEEPER.
HD earnings before the opening bell tomorrow: The question is how do we wake up in the morning....richer or poorer.I am betting on a big move up after earnings. I would have liked us to be much higher at this point going into earnings but as long as we move in the right direction to $300 slow and steady....I'm good.
glad to see up over hours
Why is Home Depot down today I do not get it?
down from 213 since September and for what reason? HD is acting like a tech stock
"Nothing against HD, but the market is being propped up artificially by criminals. Time to flush."
Split coming
"**Devastating news for Overpriced Home DEPOT**""Homebuilders ETF plunges to extend longest-ever losing streak""Published: Oct 4, 2018 2:27 p.m. ETThe home builder sector continued to suffer its longest-ever losing stretch, as it fell into bear-market territory Thursday amid growing concerns over the impact of rising interest rates"
HD did everything right to attain its 52 week high
Home Depot (HD) is toast!
well that was some ugly action
12 week bearish engulfing tick on the weekly chart is cause for concern.
If Lowe’s closed stores their remaining stores sales most will go up and doesn’t mean they took sales from Home Depot.
Maybe we need to set up a meeting in Appomattox and get both sides to the table! I'll supply the bics! This is ridiculous! Until something is finalized just more uncertainty!
"$mlhr If you're not stupid, a month $45+ the greatest eps in history Still half price in Corona. Maybe four times as much as $hd."
"BUY BEFORE THE CLOSE, HOME DEPOT HIGHER TOMORROW ON THE BEAT."
buy GRWG the next home depot of pot stocks
HD should go to 100 countriesgreat storeI think they would grow their business like they did in the US that way.
great company to go long with solid not like that junk people buying that makes no money
Get out
"Read an article today about HD saying that the stock goes down during recessions. That may be true, but: 1. Are we in a true recession? 2. With homes turning into 'businesses' and 'schools,' the trend to upgrade should continue. 3. With first time home buyers priced out of the market because of rapidly rising real estate prices, buying fixer uppers and remodeling should continue (I have two nephews who are doing this right now). 4. Natural disasters seem to be accelerating for the time being affecting fix up and repair.All of the above seem to say long on HD...."
15 minutes ago. 200 @ 148.97......Just like NVDA....It will bounce back. If not x div 8/30.
"HD is extremely undervalued at this level. we can do better and push this 20 points Higher by the end of the week. housing starts are fantastic, and the economy is as strong as ever."
"Y’all saying 190 by Friday, I’m say 200"
Got my 220!
"What ever your thoughts on HD, don't overlook the fact that they have a nice div. $1.50 a quarter currently.I saw recently that we will be getting it again in Dec.. A nice Christmas present. I hold some actual physical stock, so I get an actual check each quarter. Very Nice....."
"I'm up 20% in <7 months since orig. purchase, +divs... not too shabby!"
"Companies should me made to report monthly , quarterly and annually and get rid of the Analyst because they cause a lot more trouble than their worth and in the long run their reporting benefited their employers"
Ok! Homer just went positive again! Yee Haw!!
Those people who listened to Jim Cramer yesterday about Home Depot are losing lots of $$ today. Cramer is a hack. Follow his picks at your own peril.
Soon Hd stores will be smaller and fewer in number.Unless HD goes to warehouse type online selling it will be hurt.
"What a FANTASTIC GIFT to be able to buy good, old, HD below 260 on an idiotic downgrade today!! I'm lovin these prices on HD!!"
Great stock to have in any portfolio. Lots of home reno projects going on
"blowout earnings, great buying opportunity "
HD beat's but not in same store sales. i think this is manipulation. it may go down but go back up. this is my option
"Few things in life are as long term solid as ever evolving, service oriented, technology adapting Home Depot. Not sure a stock split is on the horizion as it was years ago but even with social distancing, the Summer selling season looks promising."
"What portion of HD Appliance Sales will Amazon steal? I want to touch my stuff before I buy! I don't think appliances represent more than 5% of total sales, and we won't lose much of it, if any!"
"If anything, sales will continue to ramp, because there are very few available homes to buy, which means they will continue to build new ones and renovate the ones they have. Plus, Biden is mailing out checks to families with children and making under $150K, or 90% of America for the rest of the year. Institutions should rotate out of this sure winner and into stocks like BA, which is years away from digging out of their debt ridden no fly hole. Then, you can continue to underperform the S & P as always."
HD is a great company with very good earnings and outlook. It is worthwhile to buy and hold at this level. It will be back up for sure. No need to worry.
"Sad for so many suffered from disasters from the weather, but HD will benefit from such mishaps of nature in helping communities to recover and rebuild. HD will hit $300 this year due to the building season even without rebuilding."
Nice! Very solid on an overall down day
How much did buybacks goose EPS?
Ponzi schemes always fail.
"Best of breed HD will keep growing, probably over 300 by year end. Great company"
Retailers auto companies getting slammed Home depot is extremely overpriced for the slowdownlook at the stocks being sold off !Home depot is due for a massive correction once the pros get down selling the smaller stocks..Look at how much these stocks are falling picture home depot in the same boat when they miss earnings or forecast slowdown..http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-losenyse-loser.html
"How is HD going to survive after the boomers die off? Millennials have; no perseverance, no practical experience and cant last a week in the store. Maybe time to ""short HD"".Can HD survive on contractors alone? They're the only ones in the store who can find something and use it."
Are they planning to stop the trading?
"Pre-market is pretty brutal for everything right now. But, earnings were good and the dividend increased by 10%."
Seeing some downgrades on some financials this morning. The old one two by the analysts. I think patience maybe
Dead money.
"For anyone who are not looking ahead. You better look at CAT, GE AND HD stocks which are the barometer of the US economy. Cat have been downgraded, GE is selling assets, and HD missed. HD haven't missed earnings in this way in a long while. Many retailers are closing their doors the past year. Housing have slumped, Auto sales the worse in 18 months. What else do you expect that is coming?"
HD reached a new 52 Week Low at $168.41
will rebound with all the home purchases remodeling and rebuilding from hurricanes hold and stay long
It’s about time to come back to reality.
gross margins contraction only negative I can find
The manipulators are on this stock like fleas on a hounds back !!!
Doesn't HD's minuscule book value bother anyone?
"Even when HD was at it's best the PPS was lower....it's seen huge losses in profit from the China tariffs the last 3 years...volatile economy,and now renewed trade feuds heating up again....The FED has the printing press on propping the markets up and when they come for their ROI you small time retail investors will be left holding the bag. LOCK IN PROFITS"
Watch out. Elon may talk about HD. That dingbat is bringing everything down lately.
That R guy is a total fool. Even a Moron can see how well HD has held up compared to the other stocks. Like i said buy quality.
" President Trump averaged over 250,00 new jobs every month since President Very incredible feat. Trump now has lowest US unemployment in past 28 years.  Home Depot hiring good sign business is blooming"
Soon the price on HD stock will look like they split it LOL
HD reached a new All Time High at 213.76
"Guys, relax. We are up 1000% in last 10 years."
This is just one of the reasons for buy and HOLD with the DRIP program. Next time HD pays the dividend we will receive more shares. I have been a holder since 1998 and just keep reinvesting the dividend. Home Depot will ALWAYS be needed unlike Apple and I have Apple stock too. Home Depot products are needs and Apple products are wants!
Just bought 1000 shares. Going in big on this trade.
**breaking news held back by pros so they can sell before retailers **consumer sentiment collapses much lower than any estimate !https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-consumer-sentiment-unexpectedly-falls-in-june-496319
I'm long looking for dip at 205 to buy love the company
"been a HD guy since 80s..watch all small guys go out of business..rickles, pergerment"
4% below all time highs! Springtime right around the corner. Dividend increase coming.
Initiated a long position of HD this morning. Hope it hits 255 next week.
Dead money here......
Stock is on fire
HD A FOREVER STOCK BEST OF BREED BEST MANAGEMENT A I CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT STOCK. JUST HAD A DIVIDEND INCREASE OF 10% NEW HIGHS IMO NEXT YEAR.
Hurricane Michael is going to be huge and will be moving fast so inland from Florida all the way to the East Coast will need supplies. Per latest track
The China deal will only help boost HD. I’m buying more.
Do I hear SPLIT soon
Tractor Supply Warns and is tanking HUGE !Closely related to Overpriced Home depot !
Did you see this ?Devastating news for Home Depot next quarter !http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-mortgage-activity-falls-10-143700007.html
HD pe high
They announced earning would be 9 am but must been in California the Pacific time zone
"https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a292a7c7-927e-3e21-bede-3479f43ed6e4/home-depot-was-a-pandemic.htmlStaying long for long. Consistent price performance, smart deployment of cash(initially criticized by some analysts) to enhance their supply chain during and post C19, PE still within reason relative to the sector. Yes there's a dividend, not what you'll find in a REIT but offering more price stability. And there's always the back buzz of a split...you'll have to be in it to win it."
Wait til hurricane season and this will be back trading in the 190's..
"Now is the time to load up on this one. Folks are out spending money and want to pretty up their yards and homes. HD $275 by fall. Also, nice dividend."
Bottom most likely in today with RSI at lowest since March drop .33 HD is crushing sales
POS can't get out of its own way
Sell why you still can and someone wants to pay this much for way over priced HD
HD is breaking out!!! Here comes $ 260.00!!!
"Retail taking a hit today because of Beds, Bath and Beyond. Good time to buy more HD!"
great day!!!!!!!
I'll buy when every Cramerican on this board has sold and given up hope.
I expect a div increase to about 1.05 soon.
It does seem like Cramer is trying to talk down HD after years of being bullish.
"This stock had a ""very bullish"" rating by analysts. So why the big price drop. It can't seem to sustain a rally."
"""ANGI"" is a home service broker connecting home repairman and home owners. The company charges the commission for every deal!More and more home repairs are needed as we are coming out of the Corona Virus disaster! More and more home improvement projects in summer. It is time to buy low now at $8-$9 and sell it later at $90 like Wayfair! The company just reported a positive surprising earning today!"
getting seasick
Can you imagine if Trump actually were to send illegals home. HD flooring installation companies would fold up overnight. Then what.
will be close to 52 week low by Friday
I bought a toilet seat cover from them last quarter. You’re welcome.
"I bought HD when it was 35$ long ago.I love shopping at HD ..gets all my supplies there,just close to my place.Belly happi...like the Rainier cherry tree I bought from HD last year at just 9$..clearance sale"
Hd is buying back 3.7B in stock in the second half of year. They will start tomorrow.
Wow back to $152 again
Any opinions on a stock split?
"Stock will rebound. It always does,"
"Went to the local Home Depot Saturday morning. They were making people stand outside in a line, only allowing a certain number of people in the store at any one time. Droves of people were choosing not to stand in line and were leaving. I drove 8 blocks away to Lowes. They were not following this practice. The parking lot was completely full and the lines were in the store stacked up behind the cash registers. Every register was open. Lows and HD report earnings May 20th or so. As everyone is aware, one of the key metrics for retail is same store sales growth. If HD keeps this policy through the end of the month of April, my guess is the YOY same quarter sales growth will be up for Lowes and down for HD. I like the management of HD and feel they are a great company. However I also feel a good ""trade"" may be to buy puts on HD and calls on Lowes around the first of May."
"Don't you dare give in to those violent, racist, Marxist degenerates!"
"added to my short...easy money, what a gift"
"Back in my day, when a hurricane struck, you didn't sit around and plan on how much money you was gonna make because of the other people suffering. You went and helped them clean up the water and that was that."
50 points down this one got me time for the long haul
Get ready to lose some money. Time will tell if HD makes that double TOP and the party is over. So it's time to sell some HD and take a little off the top just incase the party is over and that double Top happens. because the drop can be big and swift before for you blink once the AI trading computers kick in. So invest smartly by taking a little off the table .
"Slaughter them fools a great FALL in the FALL , Better get your shares of T because it will be the only income you will get for decades"
This is oversold like many other stocks taking a hit. Earnings will tell the story.
https://www.barrons.com/articles/home-depot-and-lowes-stocks-poised-for-further-gains-analyst-says-51592410144?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
I'm thinking of selling off 1/3 of my holdings I think we all know a pull back is coming
"The Home Depot does not enable bombers, but it does hire billions of illegals through shady labor shops."
"Cramer might save you or get you slaughtered time will tell if he can get enough sucker to buy HD in a down cycle to change the cycle before it drops $70 dollars or more LOL,LOL going to be fun to watch what happens"
"Not quite worthy of streaking, but I'll take it for now.Hey Tom, how bout's I end you?"
"Up >23% in four months since last buy of HD, plus caught two divies... not too shabby.. works for me!"
"Near 30 PE for a retail store, totally not overvalued at all"
Jumping in on some more. Exciting!!
I hurd a rummor from Maxine Waters dat the Homes Deport (HD) is gonna go bankrupp an thass why dee stock iz sinking.
So all you experts is it safe to buy yet?
I see a split after earnings tomorrow
I hope this isn’t a prerequisite of what’s coming
No Chinese products in usa.america great again
Down $35 already from recent high. That is a 15% haircut
**ALERT**About 80-90% of the ITEMS sold at HOME DEPOT come from CHINA !What will happen when TRUMP puts huge 35% Tariffs on these items ?
SHOW ME THE MONEY! Have a good weekend all long term holders!
Better look at what HD makes per square ft R aka PIPSQUEAK!!...LOL 245+ IS IN THE STARS IMO.
"o has story: short sellers have 105B week from cornovirus etc. felt like trying to hurt Trump. When Santelli read of news pertaining to housing? Santelli, literally gasped at the historic number! I believe in USA and HD. trump 2020 imo"
"This company is a gold mine, Home Depot is a great investment."
Lowe's earnings were not good so that's going to bring Home Depot down today they getting tired of how dumb the stock market is
Hopefully we go above 300 today
R to the mute pile!
This is CRAZY STUPID!!!!! Bad news is I cannot find a justification for this price drop. Good news bought more at a low price of $254.50. I have enough cash to do one more buy if drops again.
Bear market...when good news doesn't matter
Look at HD rally today!!! GO HD GO!!!
Is today the day that we buy or sale HD supply? I lost count since we keep buying high and selling g low this asset. We must be in the process of finding buyers since we bought it again.
Upgraded by JP MORGAN. A billion share float and 700k takes it down $5
bond rates are bringing down the market - hitting 2.95% for 10 year.
$245 before we hit earnings date.
I entered in '93 @ $11. Sold 80% at $200. Debating on letting go of the remaining 20% into near future
"Interest rates are going up as we all knew, so housing will go down. Beside HD recent stock prices ran up too fast. Pull back of at least $13 is needed before going back up higher."
"HD or LOW, long term???"
well after a down week let's look to the future great gains from lows!!!!
A 3-1 split would provide a jolt to this stock. Valuation would not change however interest would..
Up 18 cents pre-market! The bottom is behind us!
"Hurry BUY, BUY,BUY construction is slowing and fast , Hurry Buy , Buy , Buy so Wall Streets rich clients can Sell, Sell, Sell"
Back down to $170 as the DOW is way overbought and will correct back down 50% from its Dec uptrend. Yes about 2500 points on the DOW
HD will blow away estimates as it has done every quarter for the past XX years. Stay long and wreak the benefits.
nice after hours jump
Counting on the shorts to keep this down for about 10 minutes after open.
what just happend? LOW took even a bigger hit instantly. News of some sort come out?
"Good comeback today. Hopefully we see green on Monday heading into the best time of the year for the retail space, and the market as a whole."
In 2H will need Miracle Growth from the garden department lol.
"HD cut 4 hours out of their open hours, from pre virus. Home building has been shut down in Washington, and cut back in Oregon. The $13 minimum wage that HD attempts to capture their employees at, will be raised by law to $15 this summer, which will cut deeply into HD's earnings. The greatest real estate crash since the 2008 Liar Loan era is getting traction now. Home builders don't build homes when they can't sell them at a profit. Do the math."
Buy Buy Buy Keep pumping it up The Big Guys need Buyers
"With the increased demand in homes among millennials, roughly 1.3 million homes are set to be built per year over the next five years! This increase in home building activity points to revenue potential for Home Depot, which may not only be involved in home building materials but homeowner products as well."
"GREAT news is already baked in, hopefully they OVER-deliver or watch out for a 8-10% haircut tomorrow."
"the program evolved due to there having issues with sales employees not really caring and not putting forth much effort due to low pay and benefits. These ""new franchises,"" do not sell clothing or bath products. They deal in tools, major appliances and houseware. He stated that it is being tested. So far he says there are Approximately a dozen stores open annd they are doing well. He is thinking of trying to get one. With the pride in ownership and Personal $$ investment coupled with personal on premises owner, maybe. Agzin this is from a Sears Repairman. Was he pulling my leg or What?????"
love this stock great gains hold long
"Lowes recently closed 20 stores across the US. Most of these stores were near HD. Closeout sales and liquidations likely impacted HD's sales. with an overreaction to earnings, analyists will take this opportunity to hedge future earnings when some of this quarters earnings were a one-off due to Lowes closings, and bad weather across the US. HD is a BUY."
So much negativity on these posts.. HD will do just fine.
300 by Friday
"Elon Musk got fined a huge amount of $ for verbal market manipulation but the people do it everyday Guggenheim , Investor Place ???"
This stock is due to split.....3/1?!
Chooo Choooo!!!!! Non-stop too $200!!!!! Love my dividend and buying more shares! Spring time is HD time!
Where;s to share increase?
how come this stock is immune to trade war? every single item they sell at home Depot is coming from China maybe except lumbar that's my understanding.
Good earning caused it decline. Why? Dangerous sign for high valuation.

"Yahoo, please fix your new layout. It is terrible!"
As a poor contractor I spend 20k a year at HD. With the pro referral program I don't mind spending money there even if I don't need parts. It's free advertising. Spend $15 per click on google or buy 40 dollars of parts and get 1 referral. Lows wont be around in 20 years and Home Depot will be bigger than ever.
time to split Georgia...bye bye

"I would be really worried about HD accounting after this weekend one item I was buying 2 different stores inventory was way off. one said they had 15 only had 2, one said they had 13 only had 4 and 9 or a totally different items , Looks to me as none of the inventory is correct so the accounting has to be all screw up."
Split Time - allows more folks to afford
What's next.....going to sue all the trees that give you allergies?? FFS.
The economy is opening up. People are returning to work. With unemployment so high why are we paying extra money to employees? We need to cut those extra expenses that are hurting the bottom line immediately. We need to refocus on shareholders. Once these extra benefits are gone the stock can go to new highs. The time to cut these costs is now. We have plenty of people that can replace these employees and take the stock to new highs.
"Store hours have been cut by 6 hours per day around here. Formerly, they were open from 7AM to 10PM. Now it's 9AM to 6PM."
I own 500 shares of HD and I'm happy to say I'm up 467% and I'm a loyal customer. I see HD still advertises on Fox. If HD joins the political elite and boycotts Fox then they can kiss me goodbye. Hope that doesn't happen and keep up the good work.
"You Hoe Moe longs don't seem to listen. I know that you hire illegals indirectly through sketchy labor shops. As such, I tell as many people as who will listen to me how despicable your business practices are (and they are.)Come clean, get rid of the illegals. Stop the red white and blue farce, while you are (indirectly and knowingly) hiring billions of illegals to install your products.Until then, I encourage people to go elsewhere. And, I know a lot of people. Come clean. Show some spine. Start walking the walk instead of spewing unsubstantiated, verbal diarrhea about how great The Depot is.At the moment, it ain't so great. They willingly and knowingly send hundreds of installation jobs to illegals every day.Every day.Every day.Tomorrow, and the next day.And the day after that.If you really care about America, practice what you preach."
Here lately when the markets have been down HD and Low have held like a champ. Big money will be pouring in the closer we get to earnings date. ((( May 16 )))). $$$$$$$$. Should be @ $160.00 or better.
"HOME DEPOT LONGS, LET'S CELEBRATE."
I could see this day coming!
22% below all time high. Not bad considering the circumstances. I enjoyed the recent dividend getting 10 more shares!
Looks like no dead cat bounce which is not good. At least LOWE's jumped up today but another down day for HD does not bode well for the stock. I will wait until Monday morning but if no uptick the stock will be tainted for months and a downward spiral has begun. AMZN takes down another company. When will it end?
When HD puts up a 4% comp which is respectable what do you think will happen if an 8% ss comp can't get the stock higher? And why does Yahoo keep deleting this question? Yahoo is horrible. That is why Google essentially put you out of business.
$240 by year end

"Operation DEM wit is building and starting to show things are slowing more than you think LOL just look at them slaughtering Fed EX because they missed. Operation DEM wit to stop all shopping and go in to maximum hoarding of cash mode is showing up in FED EX numbers already LOL , They are going to slaughter Home Depot LOL. Operation DEM wit is the only way Trump loses but DEM wits have to want to destroy America to get TRUMP out more than anything else LOL and they do. HD slaughter time is coming to a Home Depot near you soon LOL SLOWING and SLOWING more FED is now way behind the DEM wits and it on purpose to help GET Trump out . $ more year of TRUMP would send the DEM wits into orbit. LOL"
All the HD employee Stock participants sell at the same time
It looks like it bottomed on Friday looking good today
28 PE for HD is completely crazy for such a low margin business.
I shorted yesterday should have waited
If I sale today. Will I receive my dividends still?
will i get my gtc @205??????????
Wow who else saw that spike in the last minute of trading?!?!
"Well, that was the easiest swing trade in the world...take the money and run, I'll be back to do it all over again :)"
"Another day.... another down day for HD. This stock is getting destroyed by Mgmt relentless wage increases to associates. Let’s remember there is high unemployment out there.... so zero need or justification for these increases. As margins decline due Mgmt Bernie Sanders plan the stock just keeps going down,"
You can put your orders into to buy HD at $120 and you just might get filled soon than you think LOL
What a great buying opportunity.
And prob their institutional investors
Remember when some clowns sold this stock at $238 after earnings? I bought those stocks.
"I wonder if our lazy Congress passes the stimulus bill, which we know they will (due to the fact they’re facing a shut down) will this rise with the rest of the market? I think the answer is yes. They have till midnight tonight to get off their lazy no good %#%# and get to work. These people are thieves and only care about themselves. Don’t be fooled. HD will see 300 next year. GL people. Merry Xmas and happy New year!"
$HD really trying for 300!
Stealthily pumping is going on. Time to grab some puts.
My local store drives off more customers than they gain---bad manager.
nice gains today. after hours looking positive hold long and stay strong
Pretty insane to think just 10 years ago $HD was trading at $13 a share!
"Terminte Dumbo Jim Cramer done it again, recommend it (Home Depot ) to buy on Nov. 15 stock trading at $181.00 plus, I suggested to short the stock,only based on Dumbo Jim Cramer recommend it, as about 98% of the stock he recommends always goes down, if I was Dumbo Jim, I will never show my face in public again"
New High!!! Awesome investment!!!
$HD news out on 25 NEW Distribution Centers OBVIOUSLY to me the Third Megadeal1.2 Billion in spending by $HD to catch $AMZN and $WMT on next day delivery using $PLUG my guess
"**Devastating news for HOME DEPOT !Now interest rates are rising which will further slow sales !see fake number from last month revised lower !Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department said that sales of new homes in October fell 3.1% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 563,000 units, down from September’s significantly downwardly revised sales rate of 574,000,000 homes; the previous report pegged September’s rate at 593,000. Economists were expecting to see a sales rate of 591,000 units"
HOME DEPOT WILL BEAT ON UPCOMING EARNINGS.
why are ppl cheering the jobless report? THIS rally is got to be fake
You have a lot to learn about the maintenance of a house!
good day and positive projections into holidays
When it’s in a free fall you stop and address the problem and restart when corrected
@Mitch I'll take the 5.10 gains today beat out my largest holding which ended in red looking great into HD earnings
Who else is here because of Cramer?
time to load HD.
I have been buying since stock was trading at 20$ and never sold this is a darn good company.
What really stood out to me was comparable sales
"interesting since Friday the SEPTEMBER 2019 calls had 60,000 contracts open,,,suddenly today its 34000, wow,, someone flipped them fast,, CNBC pumped that option up"
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BAIL OUT WALLSTREET.
Home Depot is making a huge move upward. Can't wait until earnings!!!
SO R SAYS TO SELL HD ON A UPGRADE FROM C AND NOW SELL HD ON A DOWNGRADE. WHAT A TOOL.
"to good a company to be under $275, the big mutual funds should and will start loading up in the weeks to come,dividend and growth rate make this price a steal"
ed is getting muted to make a better mb
To sell or not to sell hmmm what a dilemma
Buy the dip! Nice trend up
it's a bubble
Wow going in the RED now!
"I guess I'll hold...LOW is up, HD should go back up by end of the week...slight miss for big box brick and mortar retailer like HD is actually great news compared to anyone else except WMT, maybe costco."
"“Sales to our Pro customers accelerated meaningfully compared to the first quarter, and grew double-digits compared to the second quarter of last year,”https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/big-sales-gains-at-home-depot-amid-covid-19-pandemic"
Why board so quiet? lol
Guidance:Home Depot ( HD ) is also projecting sales growth of about 3.3% for fiscal 2019 and diluted EPS growth of about 3.1% to $10.03.Lowe's expects FY revenues to increase by 2%.Just saying the Street seems to have set a much higher bar for HD than LOW's yet HD appears to be the out-performer imo!
They will fall short of expectations. Be prepared
It all had to do with what the manipulators want. They sell huge blocks of stock then pay analyst to blog bad news and it’s down enough they reverse course .
Look at HD rock!!!
"What the H*LL is going on in the last 15 minutes of the day........we were $280 a few days ago, what has changed? I guess will buy more again if dips to $261 again.No news on HD that will cause this retraction."
My area is flooding and raining the whole week..Go $HD..selling lots of sump pumps and pipes and vacuums..it gonna smash 2nd quarter 
irritating how this keeps retreating from $200+
"just how good is 8 cents profit?8 x 4 = 32 cents.32 / $16.6 => 1.9% return, sucks1.9/ 5 % acceptable maybe x $16.6 = $6.61 value based on earnings..........dividend$16.6 x 2%/ 3.05% 10 year => $10.88 value based on its dividend compared to the 10 year, which might actually be higher"
Here comes $ 360.00!!! GO HD GO!!!
Strong results regardless. Company is doing well overall. What a giant.
It's an overreaction to the tax bill that came out today where they are limiting the mortgage interest deduction from 1 million in mortgage interest to 500k. Hardly going to affect home depot. Toll Brothers on the other hand would be affected.
Big shorties squeeze!! Could be 235 by end of next week.
Each day with Trump is sleazier than the day before.
Boycott Amazon.
$215-$220 next week after earnings
I think it'll be green by eod
is it better to buy WMT or HD?
Has anyone gotten their December dividend check yet? It usually arrives before Christmas....
"The Street , Fools and others like them cause a lot of unnecessary losses"
Who says HD isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesom-eSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.

"Think the housing market is improving still although interest rate hiked... as long as the housing mkt gets better... more houses are being built - HD will benefit from it. More houses may also mean more pools :) I know not every house has a pool, but in general, that is how the trend goes... POOL stock is also another stellar buy on the housing strength. Both HD and POOL made fresh record high on Friday."
Home Depot just on CNBC options action. Heading lower and this hardware store possibly crashing !!
"Guarantee HD will beat with massive revenue growth thanks to the stimulus. Unfortunately, outlook and growth is going to sink it like a rock. $280 by close tomorrow..."
Very strong consumer confidence number just out
"no worries, good news is good now, bad news is even better, 100BPS cut, thing going to hell, market not at all time high and stocks down only 5% from all time high, MAY DAY!!!"
"Ouch lost 2.50 today... went by a Lowe’s today there was wasn’t a parking spot, they must be giving stuff away!!!"
"I’m not so sure about Cramer, he’s not someone I’d put a lot of faith in, but do what you want!!!"
HD 2018 low put in April should see a bounce
this stock is awesome!!!!
"HD is down 35 bucks from it's high, it would not sell off this hard if they declared bankruptcy. This selling is way over done."
It’s probably a pump and dump if the figures don’t support it.
"When $PLUG #Hydrogen Trucks CRUSH $TSLA in 2024 , don't say you didn't know $AMZN went #Hydrogen along with $WMT and $HD"
HD stock - 3 steps forward 4 steps back.
This thing is going back to 160 and I'll be buying then.
"The next day after attending one of Dump's Nuremberg-style agiprop circuses, the Dumptards flock to Home Despot to buy bbq's, tools and housewares all made in...China."
It will go positive by end of day
"HD stock is done for, the dividend isn't even attracting buyers."
1st time HD has lost more than my Apple or Cat no worry greatest gains this last year
just left a packed Home Depot here in the Poconos. I asked the employee in the lumber section if things slowed down and he said not at all. why this stock is dropping is a mystery to me.
no real news is there an institution that is putting out negative calls
THIS SLIGHT CORRECTION FOR HD IS HEALTHLY FOR THE NEXT LEG UP IMO!! BBBY HAS NO LEG UP!!. NEARTERM.
"Stop the Voting Scam, Don't Vote for the Shill Candidates of the Power Brokers. It appears the Power Brokers of both parties are trying once again to shove their preferred candidates down our throats.Upset with our Presidential Choices?- Then just don't vote in the November Presidential election!!!!????Quite frankly this may sound juvenile and myopic, but there is a method to this madness.First of all, the power brokers of each party assume the candidate of the other party is so repulsive, most of their party members will surely support their hand picked candidate.Secondly, one party will lose and if the voter turn out is low the losing party may think twice before again shoving a candidate down own throats.Finally, if voter turn out is less than 50% of all registered voters the winning party's candidate cannot claim wide spread support for his or her platform which could influence their decisions during their first term.Think about it folks, we do have an alternative to having the party power brokers and their empowered elite friends constantly shoving their candidates/shills down our throats!"
"Love to see HD getting Slaughtered LOL,LOL,LOL told you it was coming because of Nutso Nancy the disaster for America Pelosi , What Crazy Nancy has done is Treasonous . Nut Job Nancy is Totally not fit for Office."
I mean 287
9% below all time high.
Triple bottom today at about 19.70. Moving on up.
You can't have too many shares of HD. What a great company.
"This issue with RBG seat and the democrats response and threats is a sign of what our future will become under a dem administration. If you disagree or do not fall in line with the left ideals.........you will be threatened, cancelled, impeached etc. Extreme positions like shutdown govt, pack the court, no covid releif, statehood for territories will be how the dems get power and keep power, Calls for unrest, violence, radicalization to force alignment being called by AOC, Pelosi and Schumer will be the tactic all too common. The mantra: GET IN LINE or WE WILL COME AFTER YOU!We are teetering on a very dangerous way of life."
very high pe for a retail store.
Starting the up a penny down penny often means well you know
insane
"Money should start flowing in value+growth stocks. HD, AMZN, MSFT and AMD will start moving up"
Sell your shares here and buy Lowes products and stock...HD is an anti Trumper
Looking for a 3rd. Qtr. stock split
The stock has has a huge run. Its a quality name and a core holding. Its nearing a buy point. If your a weak hand your going to regret it. I sold too early at $196 but I will buy it back possibly today in the $170 range its oversold. I would NOT be a seller at this level.
"OMG! Price catch the same level as BABA! but, but, it looks like still has some space..."
What you are Buying???What you are Shorting ???Where this is going???What will be the outcome????You are buying $AMZN future stock........You are SHORTING against China........THIS IS GOING MUCH HIGHER OVER TIME WITH $amzn and $wmt and $HDThe outcome in 2024 is #Hydrogen kills $TSLA Trucking in China and Europe and USA$PLUG with $AMZN funding and partnership ........UP we go
"Home Depot DOWNGRADED by WEDBUSH and FACTORY OrdersDissapoints for appliances !Orders for computers and electronic products fell 1.9 percent and bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components declined 2.6 percent."
HD going up! will be back at $190 soon.
First time in 10 years they miss? Thumps up for yes thumbs down for no.
Stock will rise at least a few dollars this week because of Hurricane...No way around it.
9:00 AM was previous announced
Easiest short ever thank you bag holder
According to my financial advisor Homer should close above $180 by the end of the first week in April and then will move higher into the summer months.
"Lowes is an extra 2 miles from my house, I'm done with HD."
Went on Saturday to a local HD I’ve never seen that parking lot so full of cars before. Even during the summer months I haven’t seen that many cars as I did over the weekend.
With all the Democrats out there burning and looting destroying others property HD will be busy supporting those that will have to Fix it all just in time for more burning and lotting again when TRUMP wins in Nov...
TUSK a better buythan HD for florence play
I’ve been to 2 of local Home Depot’s. They were packed with people. They’re the only thing open...everyone is stuck at home trying to do home projects. Where else do you go... everyone else sales are down depot is up.
Home Depot is down 6.24% to 214.26
220 and higher will be its new price.

"HD set to explode to the upside, tremendous quarter, tremendous guidance, back to new high."
Look at HD rise!!! GO HD GO!!!
huge drops throughout the markets overeating to a tweet hold strong hold long
Stevie - you don't think that there is lots of lying and hate on the right? And you gotta be totally in lala land if you don't recognize that Trump is a serial liar.
"Side mount garage door openers...They came out a few years ago and they are a Wonderful product. i nevermeasured one, but they around 20"" long and 6"" wide and they attach andturn the torsion tube above the door and to the wall. We've probably put15 in over the last few years. We put one in last Friday and yesterday. Some of these homes have a 40 foot long driveway, but the builders didn't push many of these garage doors out far enough. We've cut down the rails on a lot of openers, which is a pain. The one yesterday was an old, old black case Stanley that butted up to the beam. The opener also comes with a plastic light case that attaches to the front of the beam and lights up when the door opens. They have two models and the one we put in yesterday had a battery backup, in case the power was off.They are spendy at about $500 and 550 installed, but they are well worth it."
"WALL ST LOVES THE HOME DEPOT. WHY? BECAUSE IT MAKES THEIR LITTLE OLD LADIES, RICH AND HAPPY KEEPS THEIR JOBS SECURE SO THEY CAN GO TO THE HAMPTONS EVERY YEAR."
Was hoping to add under 300 but I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
time to sell ?
See the message...housing permits highest level in 12 years. That means that HD will be a steal at this level.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/us-housing-starts-total-1point314m-in-october-vs-1point320m-expected.html
Interesting read on what Lowe's has been doing with their store employee base.https://www.businessinsider.com/lowes-employees-morale-store-restructures-2019-10
"This is one piece of #$%$ company. I just received a letter from Home Depot informing me that I have not used their credit card in the past 10 months. They informed me that if I did not use the credit card before the first of the year they would reduce my credit line, and that would affect my credit rating. I do not like to be threatened. What a great way to treat a customer. Lowe's is a little further from my home, but they are getting all my business. I just got through cutting up my Home Depot credit card."
"Great run, time to raise some cash , move some of your 401k to cash, Big drop coming. EU kit a Wall Slowing"
Trump is insane. Remove from office.
Big bounce higher coming.
what an outstanding 1month growth as a long term holder HD is showing it strength
Andrea Kramer of Schaefer’s investment said negative things like HD tanked on the last rate cut. Where do these people come from??
"We desperately need a huge HD stock buyback. We need to use the current amount proactively and add a huge new program. If we are going to willing let labor costs sky rocket for no reason (unemployment is high), shareholders need a buy back to offset the labor cost disaster."
GOLDMAN.LAST GOOD EARMNING FOR HD
"Bought 69 shares at 191.00 ,This is a 250.00 stock in 6months. Great div, and with interest rates so low.people will be doing refi after this virus goes down, Lots of projects coming .Plus its hurricane season Get in now."
I'm still counting on the share price of HD exceeding that of Tesla by the end of the year.HD repeatedly sets a new 52 week high. Tesla repeatedly sets a new 52 low. They cross in the middle somewhere between $215 and $244.
Forward P/E 17. That looks fairly cheap. Folks are talking about Interest rates. Even now Interest rates are historically low. In the 80`s Interest rates were at 9 %. The money will be made with the Lower end existing homes 60 K to 200 K and many of those will be remodeled in some fashion or another.
Will their be any rebuilding on the Big Island ??
THE HOME DEPOT HURRICANE FUND GIVES A MILLION MORE TOTAL OF $2 MILLION TO HELP HURRICANE VICTIMS AND THE STOCK GOES DOWN..THAT´S GRATITUDE!!
Are we going to hit a new all time high by close
"Why did HD stop installing roofs,siding and gutters??? Can somebody tell me why????"
Ugly day but holding strong
Home Depot is thriving over the next 12 months very strong position and growth
Wow...this is going to fall hard and fast once they rip the rug out. Hope it goes higher so I can nail 3 levels of PUT strikes!
"Four cashiers & a Greeter watching Four customers checkout themselves at the self checkout...OMG, What idiot thought this was a good idea?Customers scanning pretty much what they wish in their carts, while Four cashiers AND a greeter are GOSSIPING!"
52 week low! Have no idea what the low will be but the PE ratio is getting to its normal range for this category! If you have some cash on the side I would start nibbling if you like the stock and don't think the sky is falling!
Will it or won't it...hit. 300!
would take a bloody h03204 miracle to get over $327 in next 40 yrs
In at 34 Dollars sold 1/2 at 190 Dollars THINK i will hold been GOOD to me.. Like to see a 3 for 1
I bought HD in 2005 at an average cost basis of $35 per share.The annual dividend as $0.40 per share at the time. Now the annual dividend is $6.60 per share.I figure that I'm making over 18% annually just on dividends.I only wish I had bought these shares in my ROTH IRA instead of in my Traditional Rollover IRA.
Where's the split???
yep. HD gave back gains all the way to Aug or Separate level. weren't we feeling happy back then? look at the 6month and 12month ago charts.I still feel happy. things go up. and things go down. HD is good long term hold
who is hating this co. today
"Reminder that $1.65 quarterly dividend will be paid March 25th to shareholders of record at close of business on March 11th. To be eligible, you must own HD by EOD tomorrow, March 9th."
Going to be a great week for HD. 21 times has bounced off 33 RSI. Going to trend up.
Thought I was checking the chat board for Home Depot on the stock finance page. apparently I stumbled across the CNN chat board
I don't support the HD boycott. Americans have the right to support an orange bungling buffoon and incompetent racist if they want to. It's one of our freedoms in America!
Nothing but great news in report!! Let's Sell!!!! ??????
I expect div increase of between 20-25% (4.27-4.44 /yr) (1.06 - 1.11 /qtr)Likely announced on Feb 20th along with earnings.
They should’ve halted trading days ago until they had a grip on the virus and cure
Earnings were great. Can't argue with that. Plus announced $6 billions in buybacks. This should close up today.
thanks appl for offsetting HD negative results from last report
"Another new high above 238. Building materials/homebuilders are in their sweet spot right now. Hang in. It ain't over. HD and LEN are two of my larger positions.But, do not ever forget that they are cyclical. It's been a lot of years ago now, but HD fell more than 50% in the previous decade when bad times hit."
"Hey nomansky, what call option strikes and dates are you buying now?"

"HD's price drop today in response to proposed FED Tax cuts is a total crock. A haircut to a homeowner's tax deduction is not money slated for home improvement spending. It is money that will be absent from discretionary spending across the full retail spectrum. A bunch of crooked idiots that write stories to drive prices down, and even bigger idiots who bite on those stories and sell their shares at a reduced price."
HD will be at $ 280.00 by the end of August 2020!!!
Cramer lmao
Hurricanes love HD saled
I don't get how the earnings report justifies this stock action?
And you thought that was bad
Here comes $ 240.00!!!
Store Traffic at an all time Low!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Data. just out!
Store where 2x4 went in less than a year from 2.5$ to almost $6... cannot be a good investment.
"Stopped by Home Depot for a quick pick up. Long line outside. People standing with umbrellas waiting for their turn. I just turned around and left. Will need to come back another time. Unless you need supplies, you do not want to go there just to see things and entertain yourself there."
"The good news was baked in like I said, they are lucky they crushed numbers otherwise this would be down 10%"
are stores busy?
Citi raises target pps to 269 on HD. Margin improvement.
Thank God Trump is President if demtards get in HD will be at $130
This will bounce back after the conference. It was obvious sales forecast for 2020 would be down if Q4 19 was lower.
HD higher highs and lower lows. Looking for 235 in the not to distant future. Sears gone! Penny's next. The strong survive.
"One of the reasons bond interest is not higher is that these too much helicopter money in the economy. To stimulate higher interest rates, either reduce currency or increase the velocity of money. One way to increase velocity of currency is tax unused currency. Example: Tax unused currency that is unused over say $10M. & idled 5 years or more. When currency is pulled out of the economy and sits idled in a bank, you have high unemployment, dying. To have a rebust economy, we need velocity of currency."
What a lovely glitch that turned out to be. Loll thank u market manipulators!!
Sold at $290 with election mess and virus thought I would cash out HD and sit watching for a time to get back in. Know you should not try to time but possible change in tax situation also influenced me.
Is HD stock splitting again?
"Third Megadeal is OBVIOUSLY $HD with 25 NEW Distribution Centers announced by #HomeDepot this am....ONCE THIS THIRD MEGADEAL is announced, what will the price be then?????"
I am laughing at all the posts last month from conversation s about slamming and selling this stock. Great company.
200 baby i want it
Should see a split real soon
Talked to a little old lady a few years ago who loved that Merrill had her in HD stock probably in low double digits. She loves what the company did for her finances. Merrill also had her in Whole foods before the Amazon buyout. Good broker.

"Prob have some hedge funds needing to sell last day or two. Remember, things always stretch higher and lower than the fair value point. Sears and Kmart going under is a plus. No new competitors entering this market. HD solid share in home improvement space. Wonderful entry point for long term investor. My 3 cents."

HD usually treads water in July and most of August and then pops when the hurricanes start rolling off of west Africa in late August and September
Buy and hold for long term. It’s a no brainer.
"Lumber limit up again again, demand can't keep up. Good for HD as they can probably raise prices on their lumber inventory and increase margins."
"I spend a lot of time in HD stores. New homes are NOT their business. The DIY guy, storm damage repair, small contractors are their staple, less new homes mean more fixer ups. Who goes to HD to buy materials for a new house?"
Waiting till this hits $135. before i get in home sales are a disaster
beat out my other big stocks great gain today
Where will this stock be if Warren gets elected? 1. 15 dollar min wage2. Ban on stock buybacks3. Health insurance tax4. Repeal trump tax cuts5. 7% additional tax on corporate earnings That EPS would drop 90%. Probably the best short out there if you think Warren can win next year.
Cramer KILLS investor $$ again !
"From a technical standpoint HD is a buy rn. Candle dipped below bottom bollinger band, should see a reversal soon"
Timberrrrrrrrrrrr
what happended gains just could not hold
"The Home Depot. The Big Orange Menace, just like The Big Orange Menace in the White House.Both have negative shareholders' equity. Negative equity. The company is worth less than what you shareholders own. If this nasty, illegal using company that sells Chinese junk were to close tomorrow, you would get nothing. In fact, legally, the break up lawyers could technically bill you for the difference. Merika Merika Merika. All Chinese junk and as many illegal installers as they can get away with. Merika Merika Merika."
Make it a 6 for 1 split
Bought a few things from Home Depot today. One of the products was defective. How many people do they offend by selling junk.
Well Cramer I’m not so sure about your trade...
Lots of people urging to buy calling today the dip. I'm uncertain if it doesn't have more weakness. I'll be waiting for a bit on this stock.
"Seniors have less money this year, maybe due to lower tax refunds?"
Up $5 tomorrow
No question the best stock on the Dow
I want in but not at this price. Looks like more bad news filtering in over the next 3 months to me.
the street seems to like Alcoa earnings. perhaps we will get a reprieve from the selling tomorrow
What’s up with HD ? Cramer said they’d nail earnings and go way up ??
Nothing changed just Bug money ripping off the little guys
Are we moving towards the $200 Marc?
why did this drop back down so much? I thought it had a great report?

"1300 dollars to put in a roller on a garage door!!!!A young Asian couple bought a new home a few months ago. The vertical tracks were too far out and a bottom roller came out. A company came out and charged them 1300 dollars and the young wife paid them, instead of throwing them out the door. A few days later, the roller came out again and we went over and moved the tracks in and charged her 50 bucks. The online rating companies and the bbb (what a joke) have an A+ rating for this rip-off company. When you screw customers, you screw GOD and they will pay the ultimate price in the end...."
loser stock
I sure hope HD doesn’t bend to the left wing thugs that call themselves religious leader and push lies about the Georgia election laws. Let’s hope they stand up to leftist intimidation

"I am an ex-NASA engineer who last worked on the COBE mission.If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"
"Gentlemen, any predictions here prior to earning on Tues?"
HOME DEPOT STOCK HITS A NEW HIGH TODAY @ $274.95.
need a split
This won’t go up to the run up to the next earnings call
Hopefully this will go to $250 then split to $150
HD will be a $400 stock soon. Heavily undervalued
Well I'm opening up the wallet and adding shares. With a guaranteed $5.44 annual divy this is too attractive to ignore!
"HD has done this drop and jump at least 3 times since July....HD drops to around $270 and then builds back to around $290. If HD gets back to resistance, it will break this time around to get over $300 and all time highs, The housing numbers have been stellar and report that home upgrades and investments are going up. HD is a winner in this environment."
"Triple Bottom. If there isn't a breakout now, we're in the Bear."
"Up, up and away!"

Red on Monday buy $180
HD is rocking!!!
dead money for awhile.
I live in central FLA and Lowes and Home Depot are both very busy all day I think people are home and working on home projects and yard projects.
Home Depot is packed all the time these days. Real estate market booming = HD sales booming.
"As expected this quarter, the cost of lumber ate into HD’s gross margins. I expect a similar story when LOW reports tomorrow. However, I expect both HD and LOW to be able to pass these costs along to customers without much consequence. Even if they can’t this is a temporary headwind either way. Lumber costs will come down overtime as production comes back online with economic reopening and the housing boom gets closer to maturity. HD is up despite a rising cost of goods sold. While not everyone can afford to build a new house or renovate, those who can are doing it and doing it in large numbers."
Bought 100 180 call Jan 2019And will check back after one year.
No business reasons for it .
Democrats hate Trump they want markets down before midterms..Deep state vote Republican or where screwed

Outstanding earnings report and down 2+ % ???
Lousy housing starts. Building permits down down down! People are holding onto existing homes and improving them. Good for Home Depot! Hold or accumulate!

History usually repeats itself as we go ex-dividend and a market pop fhis should be good for a few points.

since when did Home Depot become a tech stock? ridiculous valuation.
why is it down?!!!
Still a better buy than $HD and all the other American DIYs. Just look at the chart!
Pull Back is almost over. Recovery later today or tomorrow. Then RALLY BABY.

"You can always trust big companies. Big companies have your back. Like Equifax, who just compromised the records of 140 million Americans, three times more than Home Depot. And, Wells Fargo, which opened 4.5 Million fraudulent accounts without customers' permission. Remember, Home Depot lost the records of 40 Million Americans. But, you can trust them."
Hope tomorrow Will have a better day ..
zero idea why folks would be selling lowes or hd so cheaply. not even up 1%. i can get that by monday when this storm cuts thru the US.

"This stock used to grow a good 20% a year or more before the pandemic. Now, due to large growth in sales in revenues and earnings it has a tough time growing even 10%. That makes zero sense, media should quit trying to say the clearly organic growth in the company is due to the pandemic! What a joke is being played on long term investors! The stock price is close to the pre-pandemic levels, it makes zero sense!"
Who wants to get rich in America anymore if you’re expected to pay almost half your profits in taxes???
"HD stock will never ever go down again. It is the greatest company ever. If there is a recession people will fix up their homes instead of buying new homes. If there is a boom people will fix up their new homes they just bought. No matter what happens people will but stuff from HD. Real estate market crashes? Won't matter. UE goes up? Won't matter. Put your life savings into HD stock. It will never, ever go down again. Guaranteed. You cannot lose."
HD's earnings were pretty low for a $320 stock
"Short or long magnetic levels....A must have in garage door work for leveling out the horizontal rails on door installations. i picked up a couple short magnetic ones at HD a couple weeks ago and tested them on the closest shelf. Test it one way, then turn it around or upside down and test it another way. Even if the shelf isn't perfectly level, the bubble should be the same. i did the same test on a couple that were half the price at O'Reillys yesterday and they were way off level. You might pay a little bit more, but buying junk isn't $$$$ smart...."
Look....the drop is shrinking.
Conference call at 9 am...
When broader market sells off soon you can reload at $180. Free up the buying power and sell at all time highs.
The big boys are coming in
nice spot to pickup some shares
"Trumpers support The Home Depot, a company that hires billions of illegals, and its CEO dumps money into the Trumpenstein campaign. Get it?"

"Wow, just think if Home Depot had experience sales people or tradesmen working in the store.$$$"
The hedge funds and mutual funds have to buy the HD and apples of the World. Why because their clients want to see those blue chips in there. Plus if you don't perform and take risk and lose you are out of a job. That is why the top performing mutual funds have the apples amzn goog fb hds in them. Save plays and they keep THEIR JOBS even if they don't always perform. WHY because every one else owns them!! Ackman and Einhorn took big hits and redemptions years ago not playing by the rules!! what R doesn't tell you is if something bad happened to the market people run to flight to quality stocks like HD!!
Nice little pop off today's lows.
OUCH BBBY TO FUNNY!!
"Q4 earnings coming up. Yup, I'm buying more."
"LOL,LOL WOW looks like I was right again LOOK at BBBY going higher and I told you BBBY was a lot safer than HD at the prices they are trading at . Now the only thing left is for HD to tell you they are going to miss earnings LOL and HD to drop like a rock , Why because the slow down at HD is bigger than is priced in and HD is going to need to drop BIG time LOL,LOL, LOL"
Sometimes in the short term the Stock Market is a joke. Why is this stock down almost 20% from the high when it keeps increasing estimates? Hold for the long term. It will be back up to new highs eventually. It just may take a while.
"Buying more into this dip. Nice dividend. It'll be up 10% - $300+ by the late spring. Always good for HD sales. Major home improvement projects from new roofs, decks, landscaping, BBQs, spring cleaning supplies, etc."
Boycott what you dummies..HD never made a statement on the law..Its the nut job Libs trying to force Companies to go allong with their lies..HD is a solid Stand up company not weak Coca cola or Delta cavers..Get the facts straight dumdums
Better prove me wrong or HD could drop $50-100 and fast. LOL Looks like BBBY just might be the better investment at the price the stocks are trading at BBBY could go a lot higher and fast more than double and still be trading under value and HD for sure has gone to high and to fast and WAY over Value and could drop more than $50-100 easy LOL For sure BBBY today is the much better bet for your hard earned money
"People, HD has practically NO ASSETS. It doesn't own most of the properties, it doesn't own the inventory. They are nothing but an orange logo, a few aprons and a bunch of software. HD is almost like a crypto currency. You can own it, but you don't really own anything except the brand."
300 or 315 by friday? this is only 5- 10% away
"Lowes is down today tooHD has some strong support just below at the 50 day moving average, so we'll see"
This is not supposed to soar today because the NE storm ? HD supposed to make alout of mouny as reason of that.
Is this like a savings account? what a weird stock to land on. im going to tell some people about it.$AAPL $TSLA $NIO $DPHC $RKT $MSFT $HD

This one will going up also if the new buildings decline the stock market is the new gamble place for smart phones.
"Big guys are trimming HD, given that HD has been up more than 400% since Sept. 2011...See ya @ 180 ..."
"LOL,LOL,LOL Cramer is now bagging to get suckers in the market , Wall Street knows this market is going to tank and soon. Market Tanks Warren wins and Trump loses in 2020. LOL they want to try and keep the balls in the air , Not going to happen with the massive slowing that is now taking place , When the DEM wits catch on to stop spending is the only way to get rid of Trump and they have stopped spending Very easy to see . Trump the Trump even the DEM wits know how to Trump the Trump , my wife was just asked to stop spending to get rid of Trump LOL,LOL,LOL It is now spending to stop spending and you will get rid of Trump LOL, LOL, LOL, That for sure is not going to help HD and you can see it in their stores Trump the Trump just stop spending LOL,LOL,LOL All the poor billionaires will get TAXED to DEATH LOL,LOL,LOL"
I hope home depot wore a rubber when they decided to #$%$ all their employees on the same day.
"Multiple analysts lowered their PT on HD that's the news for the drop. I think JP Morgan was one, lowered to $285 from $300. The other was similar."
Trump has been a MAGA failure for the middle class that put him in office to stop all the illegals flooding into our neighborhoods. We have more illegals flooding into our neighborhoods than ever before. We are now spending 100's of billions every year now on more and more illegals. Our schools system is over run with illegals to the point our own American children are not getting the education to be successful in life. Trump ia a MAGA a failure are returning high paying jobs back to the USA matter a fact GM is still moving high paying jobs out of American a MAJOR failure .
Why is Yahoo Finance showing HD trading $1.12 higher than CNBC? Got to be careful on this site.
Trump should fire the SEC
I have been shorting since the failed squeeze! I don’t have any position now! What you all think?
And just like that were 2-3% below ATH!
Maybe they think this company is going bankrupt. Who knows analyst are crazy nowadays
"Hurry buy , Buy , Buy Buy if you want to lose lots of money LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Credit Suisse downgrade. Relax, HD will be fine"
HD will bounce back this week.
"The real Fact are the Wall Street con men are going to be the ones that get stuck holding this way over priced stock , Why because the last one out gets stuck holding the bag."
All you idiots said the stock was going to be 265 after earnings￼

The Orange Menace has millions of lines of software designed to figure out what you losers want and charge you the most possible for it.Get a clue, Hoe Moe Depot losers. You don't get a deal at the Orange Menace, ever. There are supercomputers out there figuring out how to get your money.You have been taught that the local stores will rip you off and charge more. The opposite is true. The Orange Menace profits by making you buy cheap junk and having it installed by illegals.I have so much business that I don't care other than to watch you lemmings get completely hosed by a million lines of software and then have the inferior junk installed by illegals who will be three states away by tomorrow."
Bs stock the only way they make money is from short otherwise it’s bs way overvalued
"People are unemployed, unemployed people don't go spending money. This is going to be a vicous cycle."
Got a love Home Depot had it for years! In love with the dividend!!
Consumer feedback: happily paid $120 for 8-9 ft Noble Fir (Xmas tree) at Encinitas HD yesterday. Local (Del Mar) prices were 3x higher. Becoming loyal to the Depot.
I hope it goes up tomorrow
HD up $20/share! Really. Why should there be any bailout of this casino?
I don't understand why HD is being punished for doing right by their employees. So we stock holders lose a little in this quarter who cares Co. is solid and will keep going up
"Simple, buy now, you may have missed the best opportunity to grab this stock at 191. I grabbed 50 shares! In the last week my sprinkler system broke and I repaired. I put up blinds, bought some paint, white marble rock chips and some stepping stones for my atrium. Home Depot in south Florida is everywhere, love shopping there"
What’s the deal with the downward spiral? HD has been plummeting for days!
I wish I had some loose change
R was and is wrong as usual.
Work for Home Depot for $11 an hour back in 1996 to 97 contribute about $15 a week for 15% discount of stock now have over 320 shares. wish I never left to start my own Plumbing business...
"Notice the recent articles here about HD with titles like ""Five Stocks I'd Sell Right Now"" and the strange drop in HD's stock price, despite Wells Fargo's Monday rave review and ""Outperform"" announcement, beginning around noon Tuesday. Now there's no new news but the stock is suddenly up 3.5%.There's so much manipulation of the market going on now it's worrisome. Those of us who do our homework, buy on company fundamentals, and hold until those fundamentals get weak or the price gets too high don't get whacked much by the manipulation, but it's there. If you don't believe me, note that even G W ""Business will self-regulate"" Bush fined Merrill Lynch $185,000,000 for intentionally misleading investors and he and Obama similarly fined others, including J.P. Morgan Chase, so wealthy clients could scoop-up stocks cheap or sell them high, but our corrupt Congress has ensured that individuals can't be prosecuted - so the same crooks are still at the brokerages and investment banks hatching new schemes!So, more than ever, do your own homework before believing any media article or video."
"Since Ken Langone is a never Trumper, I would sell your shares at this point in Home depot time send a message"
Why is HD keeps going down?
27 DEC 217.5 Calls STILL Surging. lol
I wish some one would teach these people a GameStop lesson
"""Home Depot shoppers threaten to boycott after learning the co-founder gave millions to help elect sinful Trump"""
Where is the momentum? Announce a 4 for 1 stock split soon to keep the momentum and excitement!
"This stock is getting ridiculous! 1 step forward, 2 steps back!!@@! Some hedge fund is probably shorting this big time!!!"
With the housing market crumbling these guys go below 160.
"Watching the decline is painful, but still up 20% YTD."
"I just heard a fast money guy on CNBC say that HD is booming right now because everyone is remodeling in this age.....however....I go to HD 1-2x a week in the last 6 months due to house updates and before COVID I would notice the parking lot is 1/2-3/4 full after work on weekdays and FULL on weekends.At the beginning of COVID, they started a line and it would take 20-30 minutes to get in and the parking lot was MAYBE 1/4 full.Now when I go (3 different stores depending on stock) the parking lot is barely 10-20% full and th eline is all of 5 minutes max. No more wait for checkout either since they opened 4 self-checks (used to be just PRO checkout and desk (5 people) and the garden center checkout.I don't see how this is gonna blast out higher revs and profits with 1/5th to 1/3rd the traffic."
Kudos to the longs that bought the 210 dip the other day.
should go up or down today???
"Cramer and cnbc, owned by comcast, spying on my computer, phone, and television Z"
Just another insiders making mega bucks
amazing buying op. this won't ever come around again. buy all throughout this pandemics. Easter has come early to deliver a golden egg.
HD has been in a sustained uptrend since Hurricane Harvey. Its due and i knew this was coming just a matter of time. I sold at $205 with mixed feelings but I added to my position in Broadcom which was a good move. Looking to start getting back in around $175-180 and would love to avg down to $140.
HD is a solid company and a great stock. Probably goes down a bit more but im not waiting. Adding to my position.
I sure wish my crystal ball was working. LOL
Where is @dave? You had such a big mouth this morning? Where is the stock at now? To embarrassed to show your face?
LOL SAD SACKS HOLDINGS ARE CLOSING STORES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... U MAKE ME PEE MY PANTS BOY!!
Haven’t been around HD stock very long. What’s the outlook post-earnings?
"Home Depot share buyback program. On Wednesday, December 6th, Home Depot has announced a share buyback program. The amount of stock purchase will be equivalent to $15 billion. Home Depot …http://thestockmarketinfo.com/home-depot-share-buyback-program/"
"If you own shares of Home Depot, do not EVER, EVER, EVER, once in your life complain that Mexicans are stealing jobs from Americans. Home Depot is one of the biggest sources of illegal labor in America. They do it in a sneaky way, of course, by farming out installations to all illegal labor shops. For example, HOM Solutions in the 70 block of North Washington St in Denver. It's all illegals all the time. Has been for years. If you own shares in Home Depot, you are pumping fuel into the illegal installer engine. If you own stock in Home Depot, you are part of the illegal problem. Nothing more to be said. You are the problem. Not Obama, not Bush, not Democrats, but YOU. YOU are the problem."
Seems to pull back after earnings.
add more on market strength. No reason it can't hit 300 in Fall. Good luck to all and enjoy your weekend.
"I don't post much on these boards, but I did want to say I love this stock! Been buying a little each year since 2008 from my paycheck with my employee discount, and this thing has paid off for me! it was around $18 or $19 back then when I first got in. What other stocks do you guys have or like?I am definitely long in HD and love the dividends!"
Haven't been to Papa John's in years. Home Depot is now on the same list.
Tariffs are good. Buy American..
"such a slow stock... too pricey ...I own both HD and Low , but Low gave me 7% more return right now"
"Hey Home Depot, HIRE some checkout people!!!Customers shouldn't have to share filthy wands at the self-checkout area.People still sneeze into their hands (in their cars) and then touch these wands.Come on Home Depot, do your part to top the spread please!"
I have been sitting on HD for years. Nice steady growth. Can there be a better time to buy more on a drop like today a few weeks before earnings?
How does $LOW have a 40 PE ratio? $HD is is only in the 20's. Ripe for a pullback. only thing going for LOW is the stock buybacks.
All my 220 calls are awesome. Thinking of buying some 225 calls
Slowly bleeding...run is over on this one. Heading back to normal $210 levels...
250 by spring 2020...
higher interest rates=lower price. could go to $125.00 or less moon shot to the bottom
Was in one of their stores the other day and they screwed up again. What gives ?
Bill ain't getting no Jello Puddin' Pops in da Big Houz !!!!!!!!!!!!
If the ex ceo keeps insulting half the clients and supporting the chetto maybe time to short.
"The sky is Falling get to cash before the crash ,SPY has double tops and will have a massive drop."
A retest of 207.25 would not surprise me
Below $190 next 2 weeks too 2 months.
If PE hits 20 I'm in for more.
will HD look at a possible split now that it's settled over 200
They need and make money with HD. Fast convenient product ready and available
Home Depot is doing things right. they stopped their 10% off promos and embraced online sales during the pandemic. The stock price has done phenomenal and looks like it will continue to increase as sales seem to be booming. let's break $400 this year
making money off of the tragedy of others?
"SP500 is confirmed to be in the Island Reverse, 6 DMA just down crossed 50 DMA, tomorrow is quadruple witching day. Look for market to do down next week. So far every time market wanted to go down, it was reversed by some effort, like FEDs money policy, retail spending increases, etc. The stock market is detached from economy. Market is going up and economy is going down. Plus second wave of COVID 19 after restart, things are on the negative side. Be prepared for a big drop."
what has happened today I know the market is down but no specific news on HD what gives
So much death and destruction since Trump became the illegimate POTUS. almost like God is punishing for not allowing Hillary to be POTUS.
R just never gets that you have to pay a fair price for a great company. Why because over time they go up thousands of percent. NOT DOWN 90% LIKE BBBY!!!...LOL
I was working with idea of a split but things have changed over the last 18 years stock splits are not what they used to be. But a little back of the envelope calculation puts a 3:1 split at 240
"This is one reason Cramer sucks. He is in the entertainment industry. So he floats the idea of a stock split out there. When it doesn’t happen, a few investors get discouraged and the stock goes down. Unfortunate."
HD is a great company. The goal is to have patience and stay for long term.
best of my stocks hold stay long
had to add some more!
A lot of people are at home redoing their decks. This will go up
"Who told me to short this stock? If we hit over $178 ..I'm going to have to cover fast! I know we won't get to $178 If we do I""ll eat my hat!!!"
with 12 days to go with these daily gains if continued we will hit 300 by dividend day
Why is this cratering
"Home Depot's Myinstall.I was planning on having Home Depot install my new hot water heater. The person on the other end could hardly understand or speak English. In fact, what she quoted me wasn't even what i wanted. Guess I'll do it myself."
Nothing’s changed except people saying stuff . Fake news so they can justify manipulating the stock
"If you're a ""newbie"" to HD.. Just buy in at the open and put it away for the next 5 years.."
"This Stock has priced in Infrastructure of 3 Billion, Numerous downside risks. Trading with Wild Speculation."
anything under 205 BUY IT
Go HD futures are looking Green
A beat on housing sentiment should help. 58 vs 56 estimate
"Well, that was exciting. Should have bought AMD like I did. They don't rip people off, use illegals or rely on natural disasters to make their earnings."
"I bought some shares this morning near open, I'm already up $867.30 lol."
$300 after Earnings me thinks
The housing market is strong. Contractors have to buy from HD. In and out of seamless. Same store sales up 5.4%.
I must go to Home Depot at least a dozen times a year minimum
In a few years HD will be earning about 12.50 a share put a 21 times multiple on that! and the div then we be up over 30%! that is how u get rich sad sack!! what will bbby b earning in 3 yrs? or M?
looks like a buying day
"Fuel cell models The underlying reason I am in $PLUG is the ability to SCALE the model$FCEL will never EVER compete against Wind, Solar, and nat gas in commodity electricity pricing.........simple, will NEVER EVER SCALE$BLDP has some potential........""""""some""""""----- but their GUIDANCE shows they got NOTHING SCALING.......a bunch of testsNow, $PLUG CAN and WILL scale with China and $AMZN and $WMT and $HDLong term, the FUTURE is #Hydrogen Trucking with #Nikola, not $TSLA$TSLA will deliver potato chips around town......#Budweiser will deliver 80,000 lbs of BEER with 800 Rolling Billboards of #HydrogenIn 2026, YOU will wish you SOLD your $TSLA and bought $PLUG"
HD is at an historic high today!
haha institutions are starting to SHORT HEAVY love it. HUGE SELLS AT THE BID!
Better be buying back stock hand over fist HD!
run to 300 then split runup few days later?
Analyst comments triggered the selloff
Lumber prices are up today.
come on 220 EOD
Stock split?
Would all the cheerleaders just go away.
NOT GOING ANY HIGHER
"Why is HD down so much, I've read some of your opinions on this forum relating to vaccine and Covid impact on home builders and home improvements....which counter-intuitive says a better/open economy will increase home market.I have another take, it has been announced by AOC and Buttegieg that they will create a sort of blacklist of Trump supporters to enact a cancel and ostracize action against them. Both Bernie Marcus and Langone are major supporters....possible?"
Govt has made it clear....homeowners gonna be flush with cash to improve their home. ISM number thru the roof. They're trying to bring economy down. America is too strong. Dem's can't stand it. Look for new troubles to arise. They want Pres Trump to look bad. They'de sacrifice anything to regain the POWER! Trump 2020. imo
"Employee purschase plan this week, that will probably boost the price a bit."
did lowes not payout extra to their employees like HD?
Make you a bet this thing will come back and barely be down at the end of day.
"compare lumber prices, lol"
This stock sucks. I love the company. But when I get out of this one I will not buy HD again.
Nice!! Very nice. 179 incoming !!
EVERY TIME I GO TO HD. IS EMPTY HERE IN NEW YORK
"The market is a casino, no longer about fundamentals."
"HD PT raised to $265. Analyst points to booming housing mkt, consumer confidence and ""its a BRAND people trust! I always looked at LOW, however, after doing much DD I've discovered LOW is a ""left"" leaning company. I love Ken Langone' and his commitment to America. HD is a conservative company. Yes, HD is brutal on Little merchants etc, however, isn't that spirit that made America great? My values, as a Patriot, coincide with HD's values! Thank you, President Trump! Trump 2020"
Div announcement usually around 2/20. On basis of coming year's expected earnings and historical payout ratio I expect div to be raised to 1.06-1.09 range.
crash and burn time again. ONly few of companies doing well. Rest very little traffic period.
"Great for me I will buy from Home Depot, who cares about what the co founder did....."
"Don't understand today's decline....I'm long term holder, love the 2.5%+div....I'm buying....still think long term it goes to $310 - $320"
Per CNBC options market is anticipating a move to $230 for 12/6
Chart looks like we are headed back to $150 level. I hope that's wrong. I'm in at much higher levels.
Yes- got my 220. Taking some profit. Holding a bit for a possible run up to 225.
"wheres christoph, lol those lumber prices...lol"
"Look at $HD, a crazy chart"
"This is freaking nuts. If HD continues to dive, the ball game is over. We could be looking at a crash. If no improvement in HD price by days' end I am bailing out completely."
need 90
Credit Suisse is no longer a credible source
check GBT.
Tommorow over $200
Hd sells hardware. Not shirts and video games. How and the hell can amazon really compete with a brick and mortar store like that?
"Easy money - Sell at open, buy back at closingTons of longs are trapped over 166"
Buy 250 calls for this week. You won’t regret it. Flip flop
"Reportedly, HD bought dogecoin at .05"
Stanley black and decker falling ah..
Not sure if this is the place to ask...but I've been wondering why HD's book value has fallen so low? What am I missing?
just purchased a pile on the dip. good luck to us!
Taking a little profit today so to avoid decay. I’ll buy back in on Monday 225 calls
I can't wait till earnings again May 16. The numbers will show how strong HD is . $ 160.00 before earnings.
"Hurry buy HD before Wall Street down grades it tomorrow or next week , You know it's coming after they down graded CAT and DE LOLThat's got to really suck buying today at all time highs and getting down graded tomorrow or next week LOL"
It is so nice to see home depot over $200.00.I am afraid the future will knock us back down. The institutions who own many 10s of thousands of shares will sell and take there profits. When this happens HD will nose dive back to 180s. I have been long with HD for over 30 years. It is honestly the best investment. I would love to see HD stay over $200.00 for quite some time. Go HD !!!!!
....tough times in the market and I don't see a short term rebound...important not to trade out of panic...maintain a long term view...
The only up stock in my portfolio ie: appl and cat as examples we need more positive days to make up the losses from last quarter report stay long hold long
Will easily pass 300 next week.
nice to see HD holding green with such a red market
They always lead you up to the sell off just before what should be a great call but will be back before hand.
"my original $7,000 investment is now worth over $50k. dividend reinvestment and not touching this stock for 25 years."
"buy home improvement things must be buy in stores, you can't buy online, because you must be seen it and checking it, so Amazon didn't affect HD, there are lot of buildings and house need improvement now, the gardens need improvement too, American too broken, need change, so HD stores very busy now, covid-19 didn't hurt HD, so strong buy HD can make a lot of money, target price $500,"
Don't let these people scare you out of HD long-term looks good. With massive gains why pay taxes. Traders like R lose money 90% of the time. He tries from what I see to time the market in falling knife stocks like BBBY!!!...LOL
How we feeling about earnings report?
300 by next week
"HD remodels 1600 kitchens and bathrooms per day with their subcontractor network. Just saying, most remodels range from $15k-$35k"
#$%$ is it down????
don't know but tomorrow's opening looks red
HD up $3.31 - LOW down $.28
Is everyone on this board scared to come out and laying low you’d think the opposite but what do I know
not good
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-donates-half-million-120000959.htmlYeah, karma is a boomerang. Look for continued consistent price support even at new highs."
Hopefully the idiots are buying back some stock at least.

what happened to all the gloat?
here we go up
"The East Coast Winter freezing, causing power outages, Snow & Ice accumulation, busted pipes everywhere, which causes structural damage. All these will be good for HD."
Stocks and roller coasters.....weeeeeeeee!!!! All in!
Low PEG growth rate of 1.3 is much better than HD 1.75. Both are growing very well but Lowe is faster. I have seen Lowe seems to position with higher end product than HD. Is my observation correct? It is following HD and implemented self servicing check out now. Lowe is less dusty than Home depot when I compare the store. Location wide HD seems to have picked better location. Which one you will go to and which one you buy>? .
"Tomorrow opens at $174, then $176"
my 12 month target $245
"it won't be long before a large buyback is announced, to good a company to be at this price, over $250 before end of year"
"Started a position today. If it never gets passed this again, we are doomed...."
selling of HD is grossly overdone
R boy with all the stinkers u buy no wonder u still trade at 70 plus!..lol
Home Depot to not go up waiting for a Lowe's earnings report tomorrow
Lowes taking market share? I've been told by more than one
"LOWE's should be at 70 not 90, they miss on earnings, bought 90 puts."
Go LOW and HD. New highs for the summer and a great stock in a down market. $ 160.00 coming fast.
Why has HD been so weak the last 3 days while the market has run up over 600 points?
**ALERT**Mammoth Appliance maker WHIRLPOOL tanking on Earnings !Whirlpool Corporation (WHR) 177.38-12.81 (-6.74%)Follows 3M and US Gypsum from sandpaper to particle masks to masking tape to roofing materials to plastic wall hangers to electrical connectors from 3MDrywall from US gypsumAppliances from Whirlpool beware home depot is hugely ovepriced for any disappointment !
unreal what happened today
Glad I'm not shot HD
A lot of support around 211.75
"It's good to hold on this price. But a guy said to buy at 205, I suggest under 198."
Do we sell later today or hold over the weekend ?In other words is all the hurricane damage priced in ?
"Bought at $171.42 450 shares, good luck guys"
Long term buying opportunity. I have been wanting to buy Home Depot last year or so and haven’t found a good entry point. A little father drop and I’m in.
HD is up 5.09% to 200.29
sell now and take your profits this will not hold much
why can't HD hold in the green today not complaining with having added from March lows
More downgrades coming. Lookout below.
"climbing very confident ,tomorrow morning around $295 easily"
Low's taking it on the chin like HD yesterday. Earnings don't count.
Analysts expect 45.9% earnings growth in 3 years from $HD https://simplywall.st/NYSE:HD/home-depot
Looks this will close red today.
as property and other taxes rise in blue states home construction suffers..corona cant be blamed
why is HD falling?
Hearing of issues at Indy stores
"What a ride!! Stay in your lane HD, stay out of politics whether blue or red, black or white. I purchase my stock as a home improvement machine not a political nightmare. For employee morale and wise investors, SPLIT!!!!!"
this is the perfect time for a two-for-one split. this will allow more small investors to buy Home Depot stock.
Panic sellers and shorts played today....Home Depo is just a massive money maker..Now at this price you'll see the money fly back in
just wondering whether it can hit 290 or 300 next friday?
Depression has started! Food lines are starting to begin. Vaccine is at least 12 - 18 months away. The question now for HD is: how many stores will be shuttered over the next 1 - 2 years?
R is old and senile and has to KEEP WORKING!! Me I retired young on stocks like HD. Best of breed. Housing market looking good .
"General Motors to cut 4,000 jobs..Our finances are starting to see a squeeze..."
HD really needs to get their share price in line with with LOW . A logical way to do this is a split. Remember institutions take notice of share price especially in the quantities they buy. HD needs to listen to shareholders who by the way are customers as well.
Notice LOW rebound today but is not in the dow
EPS carrying the economy. Carrying it. Don’t mess with that. EPS Down future recession.
"Big Joe slayed HD again, can't wait for tomorrow to do it all over again $$$$$$$$$"
This stock is pure example of huge run up before earnings and will fall tomorrow. Been doing this for years
"Strong housing market, hurricanes galore (unfortunately) should bode well for HD. Why is HD below $278? This is nonsense, HD should be over $300 or at least it needs to hold in the $290's.....cant seem to break out from resistance.THis is all about the shutdowns and election worries..........and once the political #$%$ weaponizing Covid.....HD will go back up. Pain for a few more weeks until election settles down."
When hit over 200.00 or more split time
"Another 8 shares, thanks HD! Keep the dividends coming!"
Always BUY HD at the end of June.....Just look back at 5-10 year charts and you will see lows right around end of June early July then its off to the races. Waiting here to BUY
"if we beat more than 10%, we will see 310-320 tomorrow."
"Relax. Once Trump is started on medication for his personality disorder and cognitive loss, this stock will go higher."
HD is down 4.90% to 214.63
Big new high @ 339.72 pre-market.
Eric is looser
want to wake up tomorrow with the hurricane not doing a lot of damage and HD up 1% from wherever it closes
AMZN just crossed $1600.
"Keep averaging down bag holder loser, I shorted 277 will not cover 245, thank you bag holder"
Just had a very bad experience with the delivery team the HD chose. And later found out it's really the problem with the upper management. I had much better experience with Lowes for accommodating the customer. I will never come back to HD. They will not learn until customers are getting divorced with them.
250.00 by eoy...
Can we think SPLIT FOR home DEPOT.
Home Depot will keep raising prices.People will keep buying Everything is great Buy Buy Buy
Good to see that insiders and some of the big players were able to buy uber cheap shares and now can sit back and watch this thing go to 310. Bravo! Well done!
The best short in the house now! Make 50K easy
"stock will be down today 100%, no guidance, so Trump administration put moratorium on eviction, everyone went to home depo buying furniture with the check. AHAHAHAH"
HD fake news evolving. Sounds like some big short player is losing his #$%$!
Just sold my 200 shares of US STEEL and increased my HD position. How'd I do??? I just think HD benefits on either end of the tarrif issue.
".001% below the all time high! Chooo, Choooo!"
when does new dividend get announced?
But they don’t go down on great company with good numbers unless it’s being manipulated. since Jan every time this stock goes up 3 -5 they sell and force it back down
"I guess It is going to bounce back very soonIf you use BB (20,2%) 1 yearYou will see it is about to touch the bottom line"
what a loser stock stuck in the muck
How about Home Depot stock high quality products instead of their brand labels made specifically for them. They sell more junk it that store then Dollar Tree !!!!
More like trash depot
You guys enjoy. Off to Menards.
"if this does not hold 127.50 today I will be stuned, my stop is set."
"OK, this looks like increased worker costs...and what is with the thumb downing? How dare you! I could cast a pox on you and cause you to lose all your $."
"With all the splits over the past years, not recently, my cost is now $16/share. Great company for long haul."
we reached new ATH and people are still bashing HD buy and hold long
"Guys let me ask you something, how did you learn about investing? I am new to this iv read a few books and am still reading more..teach me please, give me some advice"

No guidance fluke quarter
slow and steady great dividends what else can you ask for
The market is acting ridiculous lately. HD could have announced a cure for cancer and a buyout by Buffett and probably still would have gone down.
"Yes HD beat. However, those numbers are primarily the result of the stimulus. This entire market is riding on the coattails of the $1.5T bill. Correction is imminent this quarter. However, infrastructure package could be the saving grace..."
"not good for HD business in Texas.. most of contraction , remodeling done by Mexican in Texas. legal or illegal.. lets see how will effect HD and Low's business.

"yes , agreed this is crazy ..Low is up 2 days in the row and I thought Friday was the bottom sell off ..:(..very frustrated"
"Ouch what happened today, any ideas?"
HD WILL SHOOT TO $300 IN MORNING
Bye Bye Home Depot. Any business associated with Trump I will not patronize.
at least at my store which is in a hot zone.
Home Depot going to get hit hard
"While I still believe HD has better business model at this point in time than LOW, HD should not discount LOW performance they have made great progress and have outperformed HD. I don't understand why HD has not split the stock . The shareholders should definitely push for this. Plus the stock would go back up in short order and surpass LOW."
green day tomorrow??
Don't get me wrong. Good company. But way out over its skis here.
C’mon nasty weather!! Bust up more of those houses!!!
Lowes CEO gets paid 15 million to close stores and he is not even qualified to be a CEO...51 store closings after seeing that i will shop at home depot
Love  Home Depot stores
"home depot is trying to make up for lost garden sales from last qtr, but that wont happen. nobody plants new flowers in this heat. they missed and cant blame anything but themselves and not the weather."
"Another good one. The Home Depot is called to install a staircase in Northglenn, CO. They completely screw over the customer. $1200 for a simple staircase.The lady calls me and says she asked the installers to restretch the basement.A poorly installed job by guess who, The Depot, installed a couple of years earlier. A terrible installation.She says, can you stretch the basement. It was a simple job. I charged her $60 to tighten up carpet with the power stretcher at the base of a staircase.She says, ""I need to pay you more than that, The Home Depot wanted $700 dollars to fix this.""Seven hundred dollars to fix a job that they screwed up in the first place.And, the best part. You know they aren't going to fix it correctly. Some dummy with a kicker will make the bubbles go away for a few months.This is the power of The Home Depot. Never do it right and never come back and fix it.And, The Home Depot, ""installers,"" are instructed to never, ever, ever, ever, ever sell side work. And, yet, they did and this customer is completely screwed. Not once, not twice, but three times, because there are still monkeys coming over to mess up her staircase."
Bought 200 before the close
239 to 212 hardly a bloodbath..150 is a bloodbath and where hd will be in a few months imo..
"“Baird states Outperform On Home Depot, As Firm Notes In light of potential demand improvement in H2, we believe there are opportunities within building products given also reasonable valuation“"

could we get a new 52 WH by today or tomorrow?
Home Depot stock price target raised to $250 from $240 at UBS
will go under 260 today
IS HOME DEPOT FILING FOR CHAPTER 11. OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LOW is soaring! Go figure!
who thinks we see 195 to 200 by Friday
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-is-spending-1-billion-to-give-thousands-of-its-workers-a-raise-125112440.htmlContinuing to build loyalty in their talent pool will only benefit #HD shareholders for the long haul. An employee who feels valued and relevant is more likely to show up, deliver optimal performance, and identify with the larger HD team culture. Although #HD does not disclose specifics on employee pay, bear in mind they offer an exceptional benefits package and stock options(unlike their competitors). Loyalty pays. And any buy on dips will pay as well for the long term. Fundamentals are sound, P/E is reasonable, option vol allows for an added kick in return."
"That might be all she has for today, sorry no 218.00. At least it is green...so far."
Seems like Lowes is catered more toward women just my opinion
"I can think of no company that deserves this shellacking more than The Depot. The company has used more illegals in its history than any company in America, including meat packing houses."
Anybody have some insight why the sell of today ? You’d think this be rallying hard ?
SO EXPECT HD TO SHOOT TO $300 BY MORNING HD IS VERY BUSY STORE RIGHT NOW WITH BUILDERS VERY BUSY
SELL it to the greedy idiots chasing.
SEL SEL SEL!!!
What time is it HD SLAUGHTER time
Needs to split
Aint nobody going to flock to Sears to buy Amazon enabled appliances.
Taking my profit.
Don't sleep on $TBL Taiga. it's where hd and lowes buy materials from. another 30% comp year so far. You're welcome.
Existing Sales missed by a big margin.This indicates rising rates are already biting into housing demand with the fed on track to raise more this year.And Nike had very bad news to say about future orders and inventory levelswill be interesting to see if HD can retain it's lofty stock levels..
HD is killing Lowes
M BBBY KSS RCL DRI DIN SPG LK!! GO AHEAD BUY A COMPANY NOT BEST OF BREED LIKE THESE INVESTORS DID AT MUCH HIGHER LEVELS AND LET ME KNOW HOW THAT WORKS OUT. THOSE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ARE PROBABLY OUT OF A JOB!!! YOU NEVER GET FIRED FOR OWNING HD!

Those same crooks are looking to buy back at the lows they created
"what is the anticipation for Labor day sales, a side for the Independence Day weekend, Labor is the second biggest promotional period, from what my ProDesk rep tells me."
We have caught a bottom. In just under 173. Now HD 177!!! Nice. We said that April Low was the bottom and we were right .
"I got in at $19/share via the ESPP for the 13 months I worked there as a teen, maxed the contribution at 20%. Timing is everything as they say"
Im sorry but it’s troublesome to me when they make money to mislead .into making bad business decisions when nothing at all has changed
IRA's and 401k's to CASH before the CRASH. Winter is going to the markets

Double bottom from April 17 lows. Both Wm%r and rsi show oversold condition
"I would just wait to buy any shares of HD, A massive drop is now coming and you just might get shares of HD under $100 by the time this massive drop is over LOL, LOL, LOL It is now time to just wait to buy anything ."
"HoeMoe Depot longs go on and on and on and on about being pro-America and pro-jobs, and pro-kkkkristianity and pro this and pro that and bicycle races and a few people who received college money.The truth is much different. They are pro-Mexican and pro-illegal. This company hires billions of illegals every single day. If you are a long, you need to man up and admit that this company rides on the back of non-English speaking illegals"
Now Just 12 days and the worst president in modern times vacates the White House. What a mess Trump has to clean up.  pray for Trump.
Why is Yahoo so far behind in conversations !
futures heading up let's hold gains into tomorrow
Incredible buying opportunity. Poor earnings and virtually NO price movement. VONTOSTIK!!!!
we had good gains considering the overall market
just remember Home Depot raised their prices during a pandemic and screwed their customers and employees in the process cutting their pandemic bonus just as the virus was killing more people than ever while raising prices to screw their customers at the same time.
Wonderful...I bought 1000 shares at 210. What do I tell the wife ?
"The Home Depot is the consummate reason that America is in decline. It claims to be all this and all that and all American, when in fact, it buys most of its products from China and then hires illegal Mexicans through questionable labor shops to install the products.If you deny these facts, you are part of the problem. You are a disillusioned Trumper. The Home Depot donates millions to The Trump Depot in order to keep these inconvenient truths quiet.Go ahead and vote for this loser again and watch more of your true Americans get kicked to the curb.If you buy anything from The Home Depot, you are not only part of the problem, you are MOST of the problem."
Some idiots out there keep saying that after the pandemic ends Home Depot sales will suffer. That's a bunch of bull.If it drops below 250 I'll add more to my position.
Oh boy we'll see 300 in march!
"Tomorrow Fri, short will have a feast here"
I cannot and will not advise a Client to Hold this. I am saying take profits quickly.
This is a God send for anyone wanting to buy stock in one of the best Companies out there financially. Plus another 10% Dividend increase. Huge Uptrend coming! Buy while it's still under 270.
If Lowes is closing some stores is this good for HD?
"HD reported phenomenal sales & earnings in the 4th quarter and guided higher for the year 2018. They also increased their annual dividend- This is certainly a ""bullish: sign!"
Most long winded post are slightly annoying but I give you credit short seller. Your points were well said and made good sense but the mkt does what it does so we shall see in the morning
When’s earnings?
Went to he today. As always Mexicans are lining up trying to get work. As always Lines are all the ways full. Business as crazy as ever and 15 years of going to Home Depot. The stock in only go higher.￼￼
I bought this one back in 08 at around $40/share and sold at $60. Ugh. Learned my lesson. Got back in a couple of years ago at around $120/share and do not plan on selling this time as long as the company stays best in class. Go HD!
This stock sucks
I have a feeling HD will see a pullback now. What yall think? google aw-esomeSTOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
This stock will be up to the moon !!
There was no business or financial reason for this drop it had something to with the Street Analyst saying his Charts looked like a selloff coming and he got paid to say that
I thought low ball buy at 160 lost tons
HD record earnings and performed well with great growth... why does this stock drop price? very strange
My HD is always busy.
Last quarter HD stock dropped after ER so I am a bit skeptical this ER too! Plus it have had good run already!!
I bought HD when it was $40 and Lowes was crushing it. Hard to believe it's still at $190 after the latest correction.
Wrong direction
What is the likelihood of a dividend reduction??? or worse?
"Analyst Actions: Stifel Nicolaus Lifts Price Target for Home Depot to $255 From $230, Maintains Buy Rating"
Buy $HD NOW! Their next earnings will beat from surge of rope sales by $NIO investors 
100% disagree w/owner- call me never home depot- not stock not customer- headed to lowres
"Recently, Trump's tax reform plan was approved. Do you think people will be willing to spend more money on house decoration or related? So $HD stock price will increase soon? I just checked Finstead website, it indicates that IT and supply chain improvements face implementation risks, which could affect profit growth if peers surpass Home Depot’s capabilities. How do you think?"
CGC up 35% in 2 days bc they’re being sued
"New housing starts are lower and AMZN effect hurt investors. Too many unknowns at the moment and no one is willing to buy at these inflated levels. HD is too volatile at the moment and with the market topping out and traders talking about August and Sept market collapse....well, HD will head lower probably in the $130's before any buying comes in. Goos short candidate."
Home depot is a cult stock like a Apple. Sell it regret it later because long-term it always trends higher! portfolio managers have to keep it for their core clients who want to own it. Make a mistake thinking OUTSIDE the herd and you get FIRED!! HD is safe earnings and dividends trend up! R wants you to buy stocks like bbby that LOST 85% of its value in 5yrs. BTW how is bbby doing today boy!!..lol Sleep well owning long-term imo great company.
That's why it's not a good idea to post the price of your short on this board
Virus will have no effect on hd earnings imho if anything we beat. One of the few essential retailers open. Place is packed and people are loading up on paint. The lines are deep.
"Can't fight the FED when the printing press is on. HD typically does great when the rest of the market is down which was the case yesterday too. You can actually see into the close as the markets were finally turning green is when you saw this drop from 243 to 239.33 and it still was way overbought. Made some good $ riding this up,but reality is it's already trading higher than what most have their price targets set at."
let's start the upgrades
"HD has a free cash flow yield above 4 percent, making it a decent income stock, and when you look at free cash flow since 2012, it has risen every year since then. That is the kind of stock I like. More free cash flow every year is a very good thing."
Hurricane Michael winds ramping up. Probably will be 125 at landfall and with a much larger wind field than Florence and a much faster forward movement stormesurge and inland wind damage will be unprecedented.
I sure bought this falling knife
Back in my day if a washer or dryer got wet you let them sit for a day and dry out. Same with a lawnmower and a weed whacker. You didn't put them on the curb and expect the gubmint and the insurance people to replaced everything. No wonder it's going to cost $180B billion dollars to fix that mess. What have we turned into when everything has to be replaced by the gubmint just because it got a little wet.

"What Bill The Excuse Machine failed to mention in his tear jerking, heart rending testimonial to the kind hearted Home Depot company is that when you buy flooring there, not only do you get some of the lowest paid illegals around, you also pay through the nose for the flooring. Pay the most, get the least. In the construction world, HD is considered the place to go when you absolutely cannot find work anywhere else."
"Good reports from CAT, MCD and GM. If HD closes down today I'll eat my hat! Then again in this market anything is possible!"
"Be careful if you buy Ridgid tools. My drill stopped working and went to HD. They charged me a diagnostic fee, supposedly reimbursed if cover by lifetime warranty, and then sent it off. It has been over two months and no resolution. Although the lifetime warranty may sound attractive but if it takes 2-4 months for resolution it is pretty much useless IMO. When it was diagnosed as not repairable HD should have went and pulled one off the shelf as a replacement that day."

Any talk about a dividend increase?
It will keep dropping
The Dow Jones was down over 300 points just a few minutes ago. It looks like it’s starting to come back.
"It is the stock of the week, HD is no doubt will go higher because of Texas and Florida. The reason is the velocity of the storm is still over 150 miles per hour, and the path looks like gonna hit South Florida. How they gonna move over 100,000 people out of the storm. I hope no body got killed because they know in advance over 72 hours."
Many on this board are calling for a stock split. I'm opposed to it and not only because doing so is a matter of having two $100 bills or twenty $10 bills.I want to laugh at the Tesla loons when the share price of HD passes the share price of TSLA.
Let's let all the h 2 o backs and worlds poor flood into the US. Sounds like a great idea.

If that were the case, you would see tons of companies splitting right now, while the truth is that NONE are splitting!"
Dorian did create millions of $ in hurricane preparation sales and none of their stores were damaged. l live in NC and HD's shelves were empty of the storm related necessities and tons of plywood were sold along the ocean front.
HD and CAT weighing on the Dow this morning. Maybe we will get something good from Kim and Trump meeting or Jerome Powell testimony this afternoon. Market had a big run recently so a little selloff is due. I didn’t think the HD report was bad as they actually beat EPS on adjusted basis and revs only a slight miss only disappointing part was same store sales. Spring generally improves the sales.
...a good day for HD
Love hd

Don’t work abt this company guys... as long as the housing market keeps churning buyers and sellers of new and existing homes there will be home improvements. If it pulls back another 10percent that would be amazing

I regret not buying this a month ago
32% dividend increase and 15 billion buyback plus a duopoly. Only a fool would sell HD IMO.
Nice 179. Let's see 180!
I think stock split would be a good move especially now early spring
"Hey, Atlanta is a big football town. Guess what, Atlanta, You got schooled. You got ridden like a rented horse. You were embarrassed. All that rise up, brotherhood krrapp amounted to nothing. And, Homoe Depot played you like a fiddle. They threw in a few bucks so that you would shop there forever. You are losers and so is Homoe Depot. Get a team that can win and then you can complain."
don't believe doctor money. he's a short seller and trying to fool you!
Pathetic.... If earnings are good everyone jumps out!
Big Joe will be watching closely. Round 2 .
More likely scenario is amazon buys Home Depot.

Kudos to HD...employees are the engines!
Getting hammered again. 4th day in a row. Low is green. Not by much but HD is probably the worst dow component last 4 days. The selling just does not stop. What am I missing? Why is this stock plunging?
"market has topped,,, thats it folks,,bull market is stagnant now"
Have all the short sellers jumped yet?
Disappointing! Didn't make sense at all! It is a good investment for at least over 2 decades! Something weird happens! Head up HD!

Why is there no buying in HD ..?? I only got this week to exit option 195 call .. thoughts ?
Jist bought the expiring 338 call option
NO stock goes straight up.....jeez people....was the earnings a disappointment...yes....does it justify todays decline....no in my opinion but the selling will have to be washed out for the stock to bounce.Still solid company so dont listen to these idiots saying $200 or $180 coming.....jeez what idiot shorts we have.
Has HD split? LOL!
HD is down 4.92% to 223.26
I know a person who lost 2 million in LK. I sleep so well with the HOME DEPOT.
"75% of analysts who cover HD have positive view of stock. Why are they not coming out with BUY recommendations?Why are they allowing the 25%who have a sell or hold rating to force the stock down? Wonder how many hedge funds have a stake in HD? As you know, the hedges are not having a very good year. Lastly, if a quality stock like HD is getting hammered, is there any hope for the markets? Don't think so. Am about to bailout entirely."
"Old news, they are already down ~10% because of it. Guidance is lower but the changes they are making open up for a bright future. HD will smash earnings next year! Don’t get scared out of your shares"
"I don't care what one paid charist says. I expect HD to beat, double their current dividend in 6yrs, or so and head toward 300 in a few yrs."

i finally got in. just a little bit. nice dividends. It should do very well.

The liars are everywhere!https://www.thedailybeast.com/lev-parnas-helped-rep-devin-nunes-investigations
All this Trump talk about getting rid of illegals. What a joke. The Hoe Moe Depot couldn't survive one day without its illegal flooring installers. Trump isn't going to do anything except stick it to the middle class. Illegals have been putting in flooring for The Depot for so long that now they are having anchor babies who are going to be the next generation of flooring installers. What a crock.
Housing numbers reported today were a blow out....should bode well for HD and Lowes. Having the builders performing strong may be what HD needs for breaking past resistance of $247 and get over $250-$260.
Why down 30 points from 52 week high?
Is there a split coming soon?
I acquired Home Depot shares for a long time now… I certainly appreciate the dividends
"In a earlier statement I was trying to make is hold on to your HD stock and not worry what the share price is at. In the years to come HD will do good for you. If you reinvest the dividends to buy more stock, you will get to where you want to be. If you look into DRIP plans you can buy the stock when ever you have extra money to invest for just pennies., no broker. This is a great way to invest.Go HD and make investors happy!!"
Home Depot is one of the best stocks right now. Very little down side risk with a potential 5% pop in the next month. I bought two nice blocks last week.
I am guessing a 2:1 or 3:1 stock split when it hits 300
"HD baby! Heading into Feb23 Earnings, NOT coming in too hot. Coming in just right ~10% under $301 Analysts DCF price. We’ll see it head toward $300 here in February. KAPOW! "

"HD and MAS (Masco)? Any of you HD folks know about Masco (MAS). A big supplier of the type of things that HD and LOW (and other hardware type places) sell, things the DIY'er guys like me buy a lot of. I got a load of KraftMaid Kitchen Cabinetry for a remodel a couple of years ago, and later learned that they (MAS) were the supplier of stuff like that the we got from LOW for use in our projects. Look them up, to me they have an amazing breadth of stuff. Once I stumbled onto Mas as the big supplier of this stuff, I got into MAS shares at about $34 in Jul 2016.. It is now about $38.50 or so. OK for me in a not so good year. It tracks pretty well with HD. Read on.. and look into it.

sears gross sales in appliances is 500 mm. because the big A took over those sales HD and Lowe's have given up 10B in market value. Yes overdone seems to be an appropriate adjective.
"LAST YEAR I GOT THE GREATEST DEAL FROM HOME DEPOT ON AN ELECTROLUX WASHER, AND DRYER! ON SALE. PRACTICALLY GOT THE STANDS FOR FREE.

NOBODY LOWES INCLUDED COULD DO THIS THEY DON'T HAVE THE SCALE!"

Will they acquire xpo? At what price?
every item that is sold in HD is imported from China. isn't this effected by tarriffs?
Goldman says HD going to 245. those guys are smart.
Its not good to throw a big miss when that quarter contains the summer huge selling season for repairs and remodeling. Aren't 3rd quarters usually a beat for them? Could be a sign of worse things to come.

Home Depot is down 4.90% to 214.63
"Oh, and HD is up plus $5 today... monster!"
"where are acquisitions since market prices dropped, lots of bargains out there"
I am planning to buy around 180. Sold all today at good profit. But...
Tariffs are history and I HD margins soar. Fed keeps rates low and house building takes off.
172 Getting close. Should see a nice bounce off that 172
I’m diversified HD and Lowe’s will unfortunately benefit from this. I’m not ashamed to make some profit it is what it is!
"Tariff won’t hurt. We have need, will buy."
Home Depot to change their name to Home Cheapo. They sell garbage.
Jim Cramer - CNBC HD 1 of the stocks he mentioned for a stock splitPossibly right after earnings as it hopefully pops to the low 300's
"The correction’s finally made this is a good level to buy in. $HD seems to bounce up from the 100 dma no matter what. So as they build up their digital, I expect growth."
HD will have a great summer season and earnings coming on May 16. ( 12 business days from now ). This will be another earnings beat and strong forward earnings projection. To $160.00 before then. Store traffic is awesome at LOW and HD.
"See, the drop is getting smaller."
Nice jump up in price today. Also jump in option calls today. Things are looking up. Was hard to be patient but it is paying off.

What's going on after hours....
HD reflects what to come in an elevated US housing market
lets go back to the appology tour double digit unemployment turn the gov over to Latins and Africans they can tell us how its done. Latin America and African Society has totally failed their people. So we want then to show the USA? Crazy liberal thinking crazy.
HD charges higher than other places
Sold half my position after hours yesterday. Then another 1/3 of what was left this morning. Now just holding 500 shares.
time for a split?
why are we dropping every day now??
wow this is really unacceptable. beats earnings and has a higher outlook. this is when you know this market is rigged by high frequency trading and mm
Home Depot shows the Stock Market is overvalued. It's definitely overvalued and needs a haircut!!! Irresponsible and Irrational exuberance for too long.
Why does HD drop after every earnings report
Sold Short HD today at $240.40. Why? Because this is set up as a perfect earnings release sell-off for tomorrow. Stock is seriously over-valued and close to a 52 week high. It has no upside potential from $240 unless it beats EPS and revenue by a mile and offers very strong guidance. That is not going to happen and so the stock is destined to go down tomorrow. 2-8% depending on how the actual numbers come out. Stock goes down even if the earnings report is very good. That's why I love selling short these bloated stocks that are just waiting for an excuse to sell-off.
"All baked in, also amzn is closing in"
This will hit $90s next week
Better hope 246.15 does not fall! Major support needed.
Looks like my $153 entry was the good choice I made... Selling it at $193 was the bad choice! HD is here to stay folks. GLTA!
At least 30% down today bad earnings
A friend of mine told me he is stepping down as the Millwork DH in his store and they want to cut his pay after being there for twenty years. Keep in mind he hasn't been the Millworh DH all that time. He's come up through the ranks. Can HD legally get away with that kind of sleazy move?
"Who on earth is going long in this market. Lunacy. Safer to juggle running chainsaws.BTW, as the sun comes up over the horizon, Home Depot once again sends billions of illegals out to install flooring products. How long can they keep the charade going??"

Surprised this is selling off into earnings. Low inventory of houses. People fixing up their own homes and a great season for it.
HD cut to Neutral @ Guggenheimn...no price target.
My only pet peeve about HD is a on weekend hard to get customer service on the phone. Either don't pick up or have you on hold. But as think as a shareholder that they are so busy! Going to have them put a storm door in for me soon. Trust them because they stand by their contractors.
Looks like Low is going to catch up to HD
I do agree that Bernie Marcus and Home Depot have been generous. How do I give to the Trump Foundation? I heard a rumor that it was closed down for possible illegal activities? Is this awful rumor true?
I will never cover till 220 and I’m been generous there’s too many dum bag holder
Double your money with the $155 June Calls!
Citi upped HD price target.
"HOME DEPOT EMPLOYEES Please get down on your hands and knees and thank President Trump for your upcoming $1000 bonuses and additional bring home pay. Instead of a 75% Communist Bernie tax or a 55% socialist Hillary increased tax on your paychecks you now have more of YOUR OWN MONEY to spend where YOU SEE FIT ! NOT where a Lib Dem COMMUNIST POLITICIAN decides where your money should go. Dems want working Americans money to go TO , 11.5 Million gang members Millions of Child Molesters PEDOPHILES RAPISTS KILLERS and Shariah Islam Tists who Kill Gays Transgenders Lesbians their own daughters wives and all women who disobey Shariah law or get raped and Sanctuarry cities of crime."
Is there any Longs left on this board ?
"This morning: ""US Housing Market Index jumps to 71, highest level since Feb 2018, 95th percentile of historical readings."""
"Lowering interest rates is a market manipulation or inflation of stocks true value. Trump knows this and wants this for his reelection the plot. Trump is a socialpath, who will plot, scheme, lie, manipulate, what ever it takes to put himself ahead of the pack"
**ALERT**Goldman and Jp Morgan is selling off hard today..I always pay attention to them as their employees are not most of the Presidents Cabinet..Did you see Macys and Kols and Dillards tanked huge yesterday ?And today Nordtrom and JC Penney ?HD is very expensive and any disappointment in earnings will cause a huge drop in this stock imo !
Once the analysts come out...this will close green today.
home depot has to be affected by this huge slowdown in retail sales do you disagree ?http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-shares-tank-after-earnings-sales-miss-2017-06-22?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
The real fact is the SPY has now made it's double top and a massive drop is to come . It is now time to sell any move high in any stock you and it will be that way until after the 2029 election
No split.....that won't happen.
How does Home Depot have over a 10% net margin when every single other big box retailer is half that or even less? Is that a mistake or something fishy going on.

Hurricane Michael will make Florence look like Childs play
Should split after earnings
Heluva turnaround
"lots of tornados in the midwest last week. feel bad for the families, but also realize a lot of building materials will need to be purchased"
The HD employee Stock fund all sell at the same time
"Personally, I think it's a $80 a share stock. It's overvalued, as is the whole market which is inevitable a bubble waiting to burst."
what is wrong with vraiphil???so much hate??
Lets hope one million homes are destroyed by Hurricane Mathew. it will be great for HD stock!
1 week chart is impressive!
"Well those are mixed numbers...just about any other company would beg for them...but it is a slight miss, will do better next qtr for sure...hard to say where it will trade today. Flat?"
Please keep on the green only about 20 to get back to high
HD is down 4.92% to 227.11
stock has another year of growth ahead due to the hurricanes in FLA and the floods in Houston TX
Dipped below its 50 sma (154.34) on the one-year. Its 20 sma is 152.36. A death cross occurred on 6/23 when the 20 sma fell below the 50 sma. Double-bottomed yesterday from mid-April. All we need is some decent volume and perhaps an upgrade or two ahead of earnings in August. Unfortunately the media seems so focused on driving down all retailers that aren't part of Amazon's network. I'm finding this even in the restaurant biz and there are some strongly beaten down stocks in this arena as well. Buckling up for a wild ride!
HD goes up $8 to capture a $1.65 dividend?
MY EOY PPS TARGET FOR HD. 230-240 AREA IMO. GETS IT ALL BACK!!! WHAT R YOU GOING TO BUY IN RETAIL?? M OR BBBY OR KSS? COST IS TRADING AT 30 TIMES EARNINGS OR SO. GAINING MARKET SHARE ON LOWE!! WHAT FOOL WOULD SHORT THIS STOCK?
Its the top of the housing market.
Every. Single. Time. There is good news or positives earnings or good press on HD it closes red or does a daily fakeout. So silly. 1-2 months from now we should be higher once mom and dad get scared away.
Bag holder
unload which you still can. The fun and games are over. Shorts are back in control.
Last split was almost 18 years ago and stock has tripled since then. Time for another.
Hd is overvalued to its prospects.The whole market is very thin
https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-building-boom-is-sending-lumber-and-steel-prices-through-the-roof-51618482600?mod=article_inline Further proof to Stock Genius he has no idea what he’s talking about and that he’s a moron.
Dow just gave the bear butterfly chart. Look at it.
"good time to get out, this will drop back for a while this week"
"HD prices are grinding downward, Anyone notices every day someone dump a big load at the open and jacked the price up again. The Big Boy are in a distribution process."
These after hour wild swings are #$%$ I don't believe any of them Yahoo needs to get it together
Bag holder you will never ever see your money again been short since 283 will cover 200
Can't wait for the upcoming split announcement!
"Where is my message from yesterday,Yahoo?"
Quarterly Earnings is 11-13
I’ve never seen HD get sold off every time it goes up $5 or $6 bucks but been happening more than ever since January . I can’t see it stopping . HD is doing well numbers are good and only thing is big money /fund managers and manipulators
This stock has been sick for a month now. Just imagine when we get a 3-4 down days in a row. We may be headed to $165 soon.
this company hires thousands and thousands of Americans and makes Mega dollars for its investors. it's one of the big success stories in the United States. I can guarantee you the people on this site that complain about it to the nth degree have no invested interest and nothing better to do.
How’s your 409k doing
Wow the spinsters are out early trying to turn a HUGE earning beats somehow into a negative. Solid reason for same store sales being less. Just imagine if they had normal weather. This is long term liquid gold.
Can anyone explain why HD book value has been on a steady decline from nearly $12 to just above $2 in 5 years?
Started buying it when it was $18 a share
I have several open calls open all surging higher
Joking of course
"HD with strong earnings the past quarter and also strong earnings in prior quarters in 2020 in the height of the pandemic. So explain how HD would say ""unsure how consumers will spend"" when we are vaccinating and putting COVID behind us. Simply shooting self in the foot with a stupid statement in guidance. I remind HD of the following:1) springtime home clean up and refreshing2) record snowfalls throughout the country3) Texas freeze and damage repairs4) record home building5) Covid cases on a downturn and vaccinations increasingI will simply add more down here but HD needs to stop hurting investors with wrong and stupid statements every time it builds value."
Any predictions ?
"Been working for home depot almost 23 years. This is the first time I can say ""employees first"", not customers first They are really trying to make it a safe working environment right now."
"HomeDepot, now--""Order Online, Pick Up in Store""...future? ""Order Online, Same Day Delivery by LYFT"". Let's say you are a contractor, plumber, janitor, super intendant, maintenance person and you need a part immediately and can't or don't want to leave the work location or don't have a competent person to go get the part--well--Order Online, Same Day Delivery by LYFT. The Holy Grail of Same Day Delivery will be achieved."
"Here’s my question. This stock has ran so much. I wonder even if earnings knock it out of the park, it pullbacks a bit?"
Going back up and higher tomorrow!
Argus new target $320
We need to see 261 again this month!
Can’t wait for earning. This baby is my Chipotle.
The news showed very low flood coverage insurance in the affected areas in Texas.Thus no money to buy anything.
R THE FOOL WHEN YOU GO BACK IN HIS HISTORY WAS PUMPING M AT 16+ AND BBBY AT 11! SO IF HE BASHES HD THAT IS VERY GOOD!! B/C HE IS ALWAYS WRONG!!!
great report. wimpy reaction
When is next ex dividend date?Thank you.Wish they'd copy Costco $10 per share.
Earnings where good as always
"HD, Lowe’s, and Amazon are my only stock right now. I cannot complain!"
Panic selling will starts when HD dropping below $152
"when do shares have to be in your account to get the dividend, I currently own a few but want to add."
In certain parts of the country lumber getting scarce and weather hasn't helped. HD has backorders but not specific on the products. A good time to dabble.
"I am customer of HD fir Past 24 years! I can tell with confidence that it’s service is the best of all Lowe’s, Aco, Menards, you name it! Large variety, low prices, best customer service. Lowe’s is the worst with high prices!"
LOL Poor R I will pass the hat for him!! I asked him last week if he had any core holdings so I guess no. Unable to retire YOUNG like me this poor old guy is still trading at what a guess a advanced age!! I do respect my elders so I will go easy on you!!...lol
why did it just drop $4. per share?
Bad news for Home depot !watch out for the pump and dump !dks sporting goods tanking ah !tj max tanking ah !ford laying off 10% !http://www.kitco.com/news/2017-05-16/Gold-Holding-Steady-After-Drop-In-Housing-Starts-Building-Permits.html
"Bill The Excuse Machine (tm) put me on ignore because he has no answers to my posts. Yes, Home Depot longs delight every time there is a fire or a hurricane. Look through the hundreds of heartless posts here and it becomes clear. And, yes, Home Depot uses billions of illegals. Not directly, but through sketchy labor shops. Hey, Bill The Excuse Machine, tell me that The Home Depot didn't know they were hiring illegals to do thousands of flooring jobs every day and I will say that you also didn't know the girl was eleven years old."
nice break above the 50 day average. giddy up to 187 possible with no tape bombs or trump blow ups
this is much undervalued... accumulate on d dip. 280 next week and 300 by yearend.
"Just like there are tax loss sellers at the end of the year, there will probably be some tax sellers this year. HD has had a good run and there will undoubtedly be some traders who seek to take their gain in next years tax favorable environment. That being said it will provide long term investors with a buying opportunity. Looked it up and posted elsewhere here that HD pays one of the highest Fed taxes of almost anybody except the oils, thus adding to their profits next year. I do not think that has been fully priced in yet. I have had way too much profiit last year to add more fuel to the fire so HD is a company I will keep and just ride it out for the long term."
320? Did HD do a 5-4 split?
"Man I love hit stock, I want more, a lot more but my cost basis is 157 and I don't really want to raise it. Would love to see it drop again."
Earnings are out
LOL just wait when the FED cuts and the market TANKS. LOL Why ? Easy you always sell the news even more so when it's priced in a 1/2 point cut and the FEDs only give you a 1/4 way to little and to late. As the DEM wits go into super saving mode to crash the markets just like in 2008 LOL
325 before the weeks out.....
I think $250 tomorrow
40 min. still to go now in the red it couldn't hold
I'd be ok with a gap fill to 228....
"Has anybody here had damaged items delivered by ""non stop delivery"" from Home Depot?"
Had to break though that 211. Now we got some clear skies
Lumber Liquidators Holdings (LL) 19.90 -4.17 -17.32% <<<<
"Have a good feeling, hurricane season is in full effect starting out with 2 major storms this week. Also through this pandemic many people took to themselves to do home projects and earnings are up"
Where does the traders believe this will end up today?
Look at HD rally!!! Housing sales are up!!! This should be very bullish for HD!!! GO HD GO!!!
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-expands-livestream-workshop-120000392.htmlKarma is a boomerang. Not worried by today's trade, consistent volume and predictable profit taking by those in for the short term. Range has been more elastic with the background of a rudderless larger market. I would expect more similar price action as the US election approaches. A solid buy and hold, they are ready for the dark C19 winter to come in all respects, analysts continue to love #HD for so many reasons. One benefit of these wider swings is more opportunity for option writing."
"The Home Depot down cycle is stating and any moves higher should now be sold.. Sell the rips and get the most you can before the big drop caused by the DEM wits and the FED always ends the same it is never different . DEM WTS, DEM WITS and power."
Stock split soon!
Would we be in the green anytime this week ?
Home Depot is down 4.92% to 223.26
Great earnings report. They beat on top and bottom mile by a mile. Down $5. Go figure. The report was excellent. Now everyone thinks they can not repeat 2020 once we have a vaccine. Anyhow the stock is trading @$274. That is $17 below the high despite they best Q3 ever.
still up 80 plus per share in the last 6 months hold long
and down she goes I'm a long and hate to see this
They should have treated their customers better and they'd still have them and their kids
My thoughts are HD is simply on sale. It will go up more than it goes down. Long
"as long as co-founder supports a rapist, past child molester and huge sinner..I no longer support him and his company."

"NKLA, now is a publicly traded company.NKLA, manufactures electric trucks, has $10 billion in advancetruck sales. NKLA, will rival Tesla in truck sales.HD, has peripheral sites next to HD buildings some with surplus land,a natural for NKLA, showrooms across USA and Canada."
Housing and market crash imminent! 2022 = the great depression 2.0. Thanks.
I've had Home Depot for about 15 years bought 450 shares overtime… The dividend speaks for itself… It goes up and up it's always a nice bit of profit to put back in like I do. I figure by the time I'm 66 Lord willing I'll have a nice little bit
"Words of consolation to those who bought at $209.I hope you lose everything. I hope you bought on margin and are ruined. This company has spent decades hiring illegals and day workers, all the while spouting off about how they are pro-America. Yeah, pro-South America."
nice after hours gain
I didn't know this but HD is more attractively priced in relation to its true value than wellover half of the stocks in its industry. Now that's sayin' somethin'!!
"This stock cost me some money after earnings miss (weak weather sales), making my stop limit hit by literally 2 cents. Then it spiked to what we have today. Genuine question for you gents: How much more upside to you possibly see with HD? Obviously thinking about acquiring some more shares. Too late to the game?"
"Cramer and the fools on CNBC bash Tesla. Cry it’s double GM, etc. They’re so upset for a myriad of reasons. Nothing will stop Tesla, never. Buy and Hold.$spce $rtn $ba $hd $nvda $aapl"
I totally agree w/ those of you who truly love HD and stand by your bullish standings and cant get a true value out of HD b/c of us day traders.However everyone else is making money doing the same and its JUST TEMPORARY & those of you who stand by HD....in the long run YOU WILL WIN
"The future doesn't look so good. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Obama."
"You have to be a complete moron to buy this stock at this price. It is ridiculous. 43 million people out of work, 15% of people with mortgages asking forebearance. This stock is going to #$%$ the bed at its next earnings. Grow up and wake up."
Serious extreme weather across the country will require a whole lot of fixing up soon.
"Trumper Ken Long-gone is now a crying baby because his messiah is a unpatriotic, coward and traitor...go cry somewhere else! STOP the 'orangeman!'"
Will this company ever split again?
earnings are out - beat across the board and raises dividend 15.7% to $1.03 per share! https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/the-associated-press-home-depot-beats-street-4q-forecasts.html
How about bumping the dividend instead of a buyback. 2% is okay but 4% is better...
What was HD management thinking? After the recent bloodbath is it really necessary to come out now and again issue a lowered guidance outlook? Baffling that they so minutely brought the number down yet reaffirmed comparative sales! I just don't get this management! Meanwhile Lowe's keeps singing its own praises!
How's that boycott working out for you clowns? Big new all-time high for HD! 315.48!
great gains today
The market punishes winners- what the hell is going on with the rigged computers who are doing all this selling off
Border Tax:Great !!! Now maybe we can get on with REAL tax reform that will positively affect all of us....M3
"It was at 185 a few minutes ago and then BOOM, it shoots up to 189 WHAT, didn’t give me a chance to buy the 190 call"
Trash. This thing is going to crash hard
"Hilarious. Google search somehow and miraculously changes the overall rating to four stars, but most of the postings are horror shows about how flooring jobs were completely botched, no support, all illegals, etc.https://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/home_depot_floors.html"
"I’m thinking this stock should be around 50 bucks, all of us would buy it at that, I sold all mine for a big profit, this stock is like musical chairs, I hope you have a seat in front of you when the music stops, because you’ll need one!!!"
Let's see what happens with earnings being announced this week. It could be a great buying opportunity. Many retailers have taken a hit and this week is full of retailer earnings. If it takes a big hit I'd buy on the 3rd day after earnings
I frequent my local HD and it's been packed! Long line and long lists to buy. Spent over 6k in the last few months remodeling my basement. This will keep going up!
green tomorrow?
BREAKING NEWS !!!!!!!HD OVERPRICED for ANY SLOW DOWN !https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowes-lay-off-delivery-workers-across-country-181145149.html
THANKS FOR EVERYONES INSIGHT OF HOMEDEPOT STORES BUSY UP HERE IN THE NORTH LOTS OF PEOPLE DOING PROJECTS AND KEEPING BUSY GREAT DIVIDENT LONG TERM THIS IS A NO BRAINER BUYING A LITTLE AT A TIME AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE
I'm a contractor in Southern Cal. and HD is ALWAYS busy!!! Love HD! They will have another great Q. HD hasn't opened many stores in the past few years....just wondering if they will or if they have another growth path idea.
Ridgid lifetime warranty is pretty much useless. Especially when it takes 2-3 months to get your failed power tool replaced.Don’t fall for the glorious marketing. I’m cutting my losses and buying a different brand from here on out
"The stock price of, HD and LOW was doing just fine before the COVID"

Considering the fact it bested revenues in this climate is nothing short of outstanding!
"Back in my day, if you got flooded and didn't have any flood insurance, you manned up and said, hey I chose not to get flood insurance and that was that. You didn't sit around waiting for a FEMA bailout. You got a shovel and you cleaned up. My oh my things have changed. Half of Texas wants the gubmint to buy them a new house and a plasma TV and free cable and new cars just because it rained a little bit."
Just picked up a few shares at 311. Waiting for the next big move below 300 to add to it!!
"Don't get sucked in only sell the RIPS this wall street game is over and a big reset has started , Massive drop coming Get you IRA's , 401k's and TSP to cash before the crash"
"Few weeks ago it was around 162. Slow quarter and slow construction activities due to winter, shutdown , upcoming earnings are keeping , this one in check. Hope buyback may help, but how long?"
"HD is down because lumber is really high. however, lumber usually gets really low around winter, so this dip is not for long."
Loaded April 16th puts on this one. I think it’s time HD took a breather.
245+ COMING. Those little old lady CLIENTS love to see HD in their portfolio. Want to keep your jobs keep the hd appl msft of the World in there. Duoply can't get better than that. Fool R would have you buying bbby at 11!! lol
"Hey, Carl, tell us how you determined that HD is over priced!"
Thing HDs in Texas and Louisiana will be rolling over the next couple of weeks. Year ?
Prediction: “We expect continued increased demand/frequency and follow thru sales as homeowner segment finishes and takes on additional projects as pandemic slowly recedes”$270 by end of week.
The Street loves the Home Depot. their little old lady clients love having it in their portfolio. Plus they never get fired.
Got my 225 you all!!!!

"Sold my 4,000 shares I picked up for $25 per share in 2009, for $176 per share, yesterday. $604,000 profit, so I'm a happy camper. That said, I'm not a big fan of the business practices of HD and feel the P/E and valuation is way too high for a retail stock. When capital gain profit taking starts, to offset any capital losses for 2017 taxes, I don't want to be anywhere near this stock. This is my well thought out analysis. Take it for what it is worth. Good luck, all."
Why down so so so much
I hope HD is buying back shares. Long term stock holder! They should also announce a new buyback plan!
260 after earnings
LESS STORM DAMAGE THAN FIRST THOUGHT.....
What happen? I thought HD is strong stock
Why doesn't HD give military discounts. Was in the army for nine years and they say because my id care doesn't say service related I can't have 10% off except on holidays. Funny when I was in the US ARMY for nine years and dodging all kinds of threats from our enmies and I protected there lazy butts from harm and fault for freedom. I won't buy from any company that doesn't US ARMY veterans or any veteran. Sad state of affairs with HD.
Home Depot is a Buy under 90.00
"cramer has been told by his buddies to make it look weak because they SHORTED IT,,,he is crying like home depot is in trouble after a great quarter and blaming amazon will get into home depot type selling products,,get real,,,its called the hyper run is over and they want it all down"
Well at least the Big Guys made more $
"I've redone many homes over the years. I am not buying paint, or flooring, or cement, or solvents, or appliances or nails, or ... from amazon. Maybe tools but there are other sites on line that are cheaper for the same tools than amazon. This drop in share price is horesheeeet!"
HD Best of breed and in time going much higher!! since every year earnings rise. I told you not to listen to that fool R. Look at his bbby today!!!...lmao
"Watch out for deliveries of merchandise to your home. HD will not reimburse you for items that were never delivered, every though they say they were delivered. To be safe ship to the store for pick up. Big SCAM!!!!!!!!"
250-270 in the stars imo. Best of breed and big yearly dividend increases when many are cutting or eliminating theirs. Like apple or a amzn core holding in which you can sleep at night.
"Home sales weak??Not in the Seattle north to Marysville area. Yesterday we put in a garage door opener for a regular customer in Everett. They did a NICE remodel, put the house on the market and in a few days received 8 offers. The house sold for 410k. The building in this area is RED HOT...."
People are thinking that wind has lessen. I thinkthat the water surge will be MORE devastating. HD UP LARGE tomorrow !
The Biggest Home builder in the US DRHORTON is tanking even as the market soars...hmmmmmmm
So what time does dividend kick in/want it now!!￼￼
"New home salesare down, but the small remodel guys are busy, busy, busy and HD parking lots are full...."
Why down day today when rest of markets doing ok ?
"Went to home depot yesterday here in NJ, 11:30 am on a Tuesday it was packed!! and everyday I drive by I look parking lot is 3/4 full. Inventory was hit or miss depending what your looking for? me it was a chain saw they only had about 4 gas type. I ended up ordering from amazon, but of course i own them too. lol"
4-1 split!
"Haha this over bloated frothy market can't move upwards on anything now lol, it's over folks, there are too many REAL threats to the economy right now that are most definitely NOT priced in, like rapid inflation, rising interest rates that will rise higher and faster than expected, gasoline is already up 40% since Democrats took over, the border is flooding America with 3rd world cancer, and America's debt is climbing faster than Obama up Kamala's legs. Expect absolute market carnage by October and a complete depression starting in 2022. Thanks and ""I told ya so"". Hehe."
"Mammoth Midwest appliance seller CONNS tanking huge !16.38 -2.50 (-13.25%)Retailers are tanking across the board michaels, caseys general store, land end,francescas, freds all tanking..This can't be good news for overpriced HD can it ?and why is gold up so much again today ?"
ridiculous.
It’s no telling how much this stock would be now if it wasn’t for the Analyst and the manipulators they work for
"If down to $180, buy 500"
Burn
"Not good, we just went below the 100 SMA. Looks like next support is $135-136."
"LOL Clueless Joe Biden is toast , Trump is now toast and phased himself right out of the 2020 election , Warren wins when she picks Harris as her VP , Warren and Harris win by a landslide and all the billionaire bob's get TAXED to DEATH LOL,LOL ,LOL Warren / Harris 2020 Look out Trump you just got Trumped"
Existing Homes sales FALL !And they adjusted last months sales LOWER to make this months drop lookless severe !!!Yikes ! They blame inventory it's everyone is tapped out !http://www.marketwatch.com/story/existing-home-sales-tumble-to-2017-low-as-supply-crunch-bites-2017-08-24
300 today will be a milestone all time high!
Nice divy coming up and a great entry price too!
With all of the hurricane damage and they believe HD will have bad numbers? Really?
HD now 178. We are ecstatic with our purchase under 173 this morning. It's all gravy ! We have a caught a bottom. 220 in May 2019
"Large Consumer cyclical + largest US import companies had great quarters.$WMT$TGT$HD$LOW$DG$DLTR (don't like Dollar Tree Fundamentals, two of the above companies have beat earnings.)These big Five retailers have little ""middle man"" expenses + anticipation of tariffs results in increased Import Volume at cheaper costs."
this was a very bogus analyst call from credit suisse this morning
Careful rumor is institutions are going to start shorting heavy between 219-220. Don't be greedy
"Winter is coming, Time to move your 401k to CASH before the CRASH, Seen this playbook before Market going to drop like a rock"
Cramer says decent quarter bad conference call!
Slowly going up. A buying opportunity!!!
Hey clowns keep buying
Dividend tomorrow $$
220 is the new support
Anyone care to guess at upcoming dividend increase ?
"How about that DOW, flat as It-Will-Annoy-You."
Is Amazon just in charge of the market now? Bezos farts in a direction and people chase the scent to see where it leads?
"BOYCOTTING AMAZON YET? Amazon plans to take everyone's business. They won't be selling lumber, but tools, etc, they will. Boycott the monster Amazon."
come on hold into close we were up so much today don't sell off
If stimulus is announced then watch the big pop up. +10 my guess
Conference Call At 9:00 AM ET
"Just went long HD at $238.68, with 300 shares. Expecting a very positive earnings release tomorrow morning, resulting in a price pop. Hopefully to around the $250/shr level. This is a well-run company that is shielded quite well from international and political problems. An earnings beat and positive guidance going forward are in the cards, and the market should reward the stock tomorrow."
Devastating news for Home Depot !http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-tumble-in-april-after-soaring-to-10-year-high-in-march-2017-05-23
"I'm a value investor. I just went all in today on HD stock. Like always, any solid stock paying a nice divvy is going to increase in value especially with a strong economy. I expect 2H19 will be a big surprise to the upside in GDP terms. Mark this post."
over reaction....reported solid growth...housing market is solid.. can't fix those houses without HD.
almost at 52 week high
How is the HD doing. The longs must be very depress that HD is getting hurt.
how can it be ?impossible
The tax credit for Home Depot is going back to stockholders.
Buying some midterm put options in case it drop continuously
WHAT THE DODO R FAILS TO TELL YOU IS THE BIG BOYS CAN'T TAKE A LARGE POSITION IN BBBY PERIOD. HAS A SMALL MARKET CAP. EVEN 10% OF THE CO WOULD DO NOTHING FOR THEM. THEY NEED THE BIG DAWGS LIKE HD.
Uh oh no tariff in guidance yet. Lucky market positive or be 170’s
"My local HomeDepots have a military discount even though it took me years to find out about it. However, I have to show up in person to use it. Since I’m handicap my grandson picks up what I order online. So I lose my military discount. Conversely when I order Omaha Steaks there’s an obvious link to TroopID discount. If a much, much smaller business can be veteran friendly why shouldn’t HomeDepot?"
PE way to high for what’s going on in market. Could sell 110 soon
NOT GOING ANY HIGHER U FOOLS
"It will be sell the news , because really nothing was done . Time to SELL,SELL,SELL , the rips and NEVER EVER buy the DIPS"

"The CNBC ""pros"" are aggressively promoting the stock up here. They are chasing the top - as usual. SELL it to the greedy chasers."
"Sell on landfall, is what hurricane investors do. Except since everyone knows that, everyone starts selling early. This could go all the way back to $200 by Monday."
"I think those of you, who are feeling bullish on home depot, are in for a rude awakening in coming months"
269 coming like CITI said imo.
Like HD here but not the head and shoulders pattern formed since 2/1. Guess I'll be waiting till next opportunity.

Will go green EOD guys. GL longs
shorting 200 out of the gate on the jump. short 200 more if they give it another pump.
Last piece of advice better off buying a quality 100 dollar company then a 10 dollar company. As my mentor Buffett would say better to pay a fair price for a good company then a good price for a fair company. Longs i imo would add on dips like today and hold tight. That dividend imo will double again in 7yrs.

Home Depot is tainted and MM's are moving it higher so they can sell before earnings. If earnings miss HD will be at $132-$134
Strangely HD.BA is doing well
"Fed lowering rates, congress talking about stimulus, household debt at its highest ever. Is this really a healthy economy?THINK NOT ME"
Why is everything except Home Depot coming back?
HD getting into politics will cost share holders in the long run. Loosing the all star game yo CO. CO voting laws are more restrictive than GA. Stupid move on HD part.
"I've been in HD for many years, and wow! Its been a great stock for me. It's going to dip at times, but my bet is it'll continue to be a great stock, with good growth and excellent dividends. Re-invest dividends, maybe do some covered calls when its near highs (then begin to fade)."

Bitcoin will be used at Home Depot very soon$$$$
Any they are blaming the opioid crises?
So over sold and undervalued. I’ll bet this is trading in the 270’s near 280 or better by Christmas. Great gift to myself.
Home Depot is expected to drive top-line growth because of the integration of Interline Brands and penetration of adjacent customer product segments (such as commercial). The catalysts for EPS growth are the firm’s efficient supply chain and improved merchandising technology. $HD https://www.finstead.com/bite/The-Home-Depot-HD-stock-forecast-prediction-august-8-2018

"Now that Obama only has 14 days leftlets review some of his handiwork the past 8 years and you decide.1. Still 50 million Americans on Obama food stamps.2. Still 13 million on welfare.3. Obamacare total disaster.4. Now 4-wars raging in the Middle East.5. Record national debt under Obama now almost $20 Trillion double what it was when he took office.6. Worst GDP the past 8 years of any president in history. Under 3% all eight years.7. Weakest military under any president since Jimmy Carter.8. Russia , China, Syria all making Obama look weak as a president.9. One scandal after another Ben Ghazi, Solyndra, Hillary's illegal email server to name just a few.10. Obama failing to enforce immigration laws bringing millions of illegals and Middle Eastern refugees into the USA.11. All time low relations with Israel our best friend in the Middle East.12. Now Obama saber rattling with Russia and they have more Nukes now that in the USA.May God help Trump cleanup the mess"
Anybody know when the dividend will be paid?
Up over 50% since March lows. A little overdone don't you think with people not doing those planned renos for the foreseeable future.
Time to SELL and lock in profits. It's crazy overvalued now
"Boycott!!!! I doubt it will do anything to move HD management (or the stock, over the long term). However, I really do think that corporations have an obligation to speak up when Republicans try to destroy democracy."
Winter is almost here. Normally slow time for construction . It may be buying opportunity to add to my position. Long on HD.
Tens of millions of illegals in construction jobs taking American jobs.

Home Depot is down 4.90% to 254.13
loving HD. Bought this several years back. held on to it during the crash. now I'm :-)
HD TO 245+ IMHO. R THE PUMPER OF BBBY FROM 11+ GOT WHAT HE DESERVED THERE IN THAT DOG STOCK!! NO WONDER HE STILL WORKS AT 80!!
HD stock should fly according to the crazy left liberals Iran will start to destroy american homes ..Building materials will be needed..
"If you have the extra $, you can play the churn like a channeling stock. Wait for a 5% downturn and buy 100 shares...dump it on the 5% rebound. Watch the bigger funds who control billions. They know their presence in a stock is worth a % pop and their closing a position can result in a % drop just on the copycats. Good churners lately: AMZN, GOOG, NFLX, FB, TSLA, DE, HD."
HD is a solid company.....but has never guided down for years.....if lowes beat top and bottom....then they are taking market shares
I don't see how this goes down today. Still $6 off 52 week high and all the recent price target bumps were just confirmed by the earnings/guidance/sales growth. Maybe the conf call will help I think it starts in a few minutes.
I just purchased more Home Depot stock today just because of Bernie Marcus screw the Democrats and the left angry mob this is a true American Back Home Depot
"I WON'T FIGHT FOR HD AGAIN UNTIL THEY TREAT US VETERANS WITH HIGH SECURITY THREATS AGAINST US, LET THERE LAZY BUTTS TAKE WHAT IS COMING TO THEM."
"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."
$200 very pleasing to the eye and pocketbook!
OH OH!!!! 3 day rule is in effect. Good luck to everyone who is long
I expected a drop - but actually had a lower target price. Put in an order at $201. May revise that up once this starts to climb again. Figured they would be due for a minor decline around this time... Next quarter - Christmas sales - could be back up.
"Went to Lowe’s this week for a small project and I nearly fell over at the price of lumber. $LOW and $HD may be flying high right now, but I don’t see how this doesn’t eventually (and very quickly) begin changing customer habits — it completely changed my plans."
"why is it against the rules of this forum to say the phrase, ""Buy dips and Sell rips?"" What is so bad? Thanks for the feedback. Yahoo has been censoring my posts"
Sales are Home Building Stores FELL1.5% and just released homebuilder sentiment fell!
Did any catch the fast money final trades today? I got HD but I didn't hear the others.
Don't forget about this eventually it will hit HD as appliance sales are falling huge http://www.marketwatch.com/story/orders-for-durable-goods-fall-to-5-month-low-2017-05-26
HD up over $2 on very strong volume. Are the bulls back in force or is there News I’m not seeing?
HD reached an all time high at 233.80
I can say I do sleep better at night owning HD and LOW at these prices. Both to do very well this summer. Crowds in both stores this weekend. Good sign.
Real estate Has ALWAYS dropped off this time of the year
I hope their buying back shares!!!!
HD will weather fine. The analysts should love the buyback news. Give it time to digest. Only down 2.5% now is nothing
"It looks like our over all economy is in big trouble. HD is suppose to be doing well but the stock seems to flounder around. I have owned HD for almost 30 years. I still own all of the shares I started off with. I now watch the stock market very close. I am afraid our economy in general could come to peaces. HD has been very good to me but, I fear the economy shows some real weak areas. I hope I am wrong"
R invests with the broken clock theory trying to be right twice a year. I always win boy remember that!!
"It’s time to sell this, and take your profits, then run!"
"Great Company, Great Stock but already hit 12month consensus price targets with the very highest being $180. Caution!"
Is new direct of chair a good news? Will stock rally tomorrow?
"How far will the dollar collapse when the DC swamp passes their 3 to 10 Trillion dollar infrastructure bill? This will put our country at about double our Gross domestic product in terms of debt. This is going to damage the American economy to the point that we will run out of people to purchase homes or products of any kind from Home Depot or Lowe's. Will you let your winnings RIDE or will you take safe harbor. My opinion is that with the next PlanDemic, the Government will; ""In the name of propping up the Government"", demand all citizens (i.e. the middle class) turn over all accumulated wealth. It happened before and you have to live in a bubble to ignore the Mad Dash our Congress has towards bankrupting our country."
Would be nice to close above $200! Stay safe everyone!
I am watching for a bottom (or a double bottom) in HD shares .... I like their dividend payment. any guesses or observations?
"Trumpers I mean HD longs I mean Trumpers I mean HD longs I mean Trumpers, your company is one of THE WORST abusers of illegal labor. You are right up there with meat pack plants, pool cleaners and lawn mowers. Your abuse of the system can only be called reprehensible. Merika? Merika? Merika? Try, Mexican Depot, the place where you go to work if you have NO PAPERWORK.Don't worry, Bernie gives millions to Trump. Nothing will change until The Orange Man is gone."
Glad I didn’t buy when it was $195.
Housing is dead. Millennials are not buying.
"Yesterday, the “know-it-all’s” in the financial media were boasting that the retail markets for this holiday season will reach a trillion dollars in purchases. And the markets still tanked. Now, it’s over “worries” over retail/technology sales. And so tanks the market.Seems to me that the Craig computer algorithms that create these swings are also writing the financial news releases. Right now, the DOW is actually UP just a tad, after having been down almost 500 points earlier. And it will still reel out of controlHow about deregulating everything and let the individual investor’s nest egg just be damned."
The stock should recover a bit mid morning....a bit of an overreaction
This is a definite buy on weakness!
After the earnings beat the stock went flat and down a little. That's not good. So all signs lead to sell. So therefore it is time to buy HD!
I could’ve had my Stock in a Drip as to have had it with Amerprise. In all the year probably twenty I can never say they made me some money
"New all-time at 307.50! Hoo, hoo!"
"I am a bit shocked at HD price action, I understand the housing market concerns as well as many products in HD come from China! But I would think hurricane damage, owners home fixing, and more importantly SEARS bankruptcy would offset some concerns. My discipline says do not touch until I get 3 days of stable price, so I may buy some more but not until settles."
"""Small fry"" investors can buy fractional shares of stock with no commissions. There is no reason to split a stock anymore. Splits are worthless."
"HD is a stock that just keeps on giving. I have owned since 1988. It is all in a drip plan. It has paid off big time for me. In 1999 I bought stock for my grandson in a drip plan when he was born. I figured it would help pay for his education. I put money in the stock up until 2002. I had purchased about 200 shares in total. We had one split in that time. The stock took of after that point. DRIP plans are the way to go. He decided against college against my better judgement. He owns his own construction business with no debt. He now owns all of the stock while feeding it every month. His plans are to keep the stock in a DRIP plan. He plans to keep the stock as his retirement. There is no telling what it will be worth in 40 years. The moral of this story is HD is a great stock while using the DRIP plan. I wish I could have been in his financial condition at 23 yrs. old. HD can do the same for you, if buy and hold on to the stock while reinvesting your dividends."
"If you support Home Depot, you support socialism."
"I wonder how all the people that lost their homes to fires and hurricanes are going to re-build and/or fix if the homebuilders are predicting a slow down? I guess I can see where there might be a slow down in the building of new homes because many states typically are dealing with colder weather (cold, snow, ice)....so spring & summer are always better for building in a number of states but California, Carolinas, Florida, Texas all have homes that need fixing or replacing....."
Look at HD rock!!! This stock will be at $ 260.00 tomorrow!!!
great day would load liked it to hold higher but it has been beaten down for no reason and will continue to gain in the days and weeks to come
This is not going to do much till about mid January
There goes that retirement in HD...All shareholders gonna be in the breadline soon...
So HD is doing better when economy is collapsed lmao this stock is infested with bag holder
Am I imagining this or is Lowes closing in on Home Depot for the last couple of months?￼￼
now buyers move in ;)
Bin laden just went walking by and said and you thought I was a terrorist? I only killed 3k of your people. Trump killed 150k and is smiling pretending he didn’t. And that’s just to start.

"Looking for another dividend increase next quarter, Go Depot!!!"
More selling or coming back ??
"Hurry BUY, BUY, BUY HD needs to make that double TOP so we can have that MASSUIVE DROP LOL"
"Still oversold given the downgrade.""Credit Suisse’s Seth Sigman sees less reason to be enthusiastic about the home-improvement industry in general. He downgraded both Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s to Neutral on Wednesday, with target prices of $204 and $111, down from $222 and $115, respectively."""
HD and Walmart should Team up with Microsoft and bring in IBM. Use there strengths and kick the #$%$ out of the FANG stocks.....
.... oops... all about guidance
Amazing how this is still down...
Looks like HD will hit its 52 week high today. only need about 40 point should be easy in the next couple hours.
PE is only 28.
they might break a sales record. lets see..
"An interesting article about why we better choose HD over LOW. Might be of value for HD investors, a quick read: https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/082218/home-depot-remains-better-value-lowes?t=yfzhanb"
"If you are a Democrat, pencil-necked former Home Depot CEO Bernie Marcus called you stupid. Think about that the next time you want to buy overpriced flooring and have it installed by illegals. Now, THAT is stupid, Bernie."
SEL SEL SEL!!! Housing market is going to crash!!!￼
Home depot fundamentals looks good. Also look at this article to evaluate HD based on Macro https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/072818/macro-indicators-predict-economic-crisis?t=yfdaur
"hey fat Al has come a long way from his fatness and cheap velcrow suits; now he has mansions , private jet and millions in his accounts yet for 30 years of his hucksterism not much progress for his black supports. BLM founder 4-5 mansions all in white neighborhoods what going on there!"
there is low volume. a lot of people that are in and bought premarket are holding.
needs to hold 170. looks like a triple bottom. Needs a good market not crazy like lately
HMNY........do your DD and make lots of $$$$$$$
HD is going to sell tons of merchandise because of Harvey and Irma. $165 this week!
Looks like good entry point
Did you see the bounce off the intraday low? This stock is a rubber ball and gonna bounce up to 250$ and beyond. Not gonna retreat from here. High volume at this level and will trade 3x ADV if it touches 236$ again. Home Deep mints my money!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-home-depot-hd-5-153003212.htmlNo denying the fundamentals are positive. Expect profit taking going into the C-19 rate-rising weekend. Hedge your longs.
Any chance we back to $285?
I was expecting $3 to $4 up today..as ER is tomorrow and it will blast..
"Charts look good on this. Up on dark red day....oh yeah, let's rip!"
with is going with massive sell off
Maybe if you don’t have to wait to get in sales would of been even more. No waiting at Lowe’s stores ! Sign up as a pro contractor so you don’t have to wait!
"HD is a fantastic stock to own. I wish I had purchased more HD when it was 35.00. I have never sold any part of my HD stock. I just reinvest the dividends. It honestly pays off in the long run. I am not getting rich, I am very comfortable at this time. It is nice to know I have HD. If your young or middle age please think about a drip plan with HD"
Does HD report Premarket or after hours?
Today ex-divy
Cramer said HD and Lows would be fine
I could only imagine how many people lost their money who bought up last week. I guess that this is what happens when stocks are inflated with buy backs and no fundamentals. People lost 100 bucks since 2 weeks ago on this stock and it is heading down even more. Too many business closings and unemployed started. No one really knows how deep this recessions will be. The damage is deep and would affect every business and their revenues. Many will be bankrupted in just days.
Ig their working seesawing it back down
"BTW, shills, the, ""FREE INSTALLATION,"" shell game is just one of many ways The Home Depot shakes down customers. Of course, nobody will install anything for free. They simply jack up the price of the carpet and get it out of your hide somehow.Also, there are many restrictions to the FREE INSTALLATION shell game. Only applies to special order carpet, only for a minimum of so many square feet, etc, etc. THEY WILL GET THE MONEY OUT OF YOU. NOTHING IS FREE.And, as I have said, this is one of many shell games they play. Stay tuned to learn about the others. When you buy carpet from the Home Depot, you have NO CHANCE WHATSOEVER of saving money. THEY WILL GET YOU."
storm hitting east coast should increase demand for housing supplies. hopefully it combos with the ex date next week to give us a boost
Hopefully they will announce a split
"This is the safest value, growth and dividend play and yet people chasing NIO, Tesla and what not! No wonder m oh st of the investors say I lost in stocks!"
"""One of the biggest US homebuilders just sounded the alarm on a slowdown — here are the housing stocks traders are betting can sink further""Homebuilder stocks were under pressure this week after Toll Brothers issued a warning about a slowdown in the housing market, and an analysis of short interest in the sector suggests there is more pain ahead."
It works for me
MS upgrades and it craters...sad. Welcome to the casino
HAHA You people are Funny...
Read the Peter Lynch book. Did you know that in the 70's and 80's walmart traded at 30 times earnings and went up over 50 fold and today near a all time high. Point is the HOME DEPOT is not expensive imo since you have to pay up for best of breed.
"All of you Pro-American Trumpers MAGA Blah Blah Blah and every day, a million illegal Mexicans go out and install flooring For The Home Depot.You Trumpers talk a good line, but it's all about money. You couldn't care less that swarms of Mexicans are here, right now, installing flooring products for The Depot. You are all a bunch of phonies. Probably drive Harleys in your Halloween costumes with Freedom Rider garb. Big excuse to get drunk because you aren't good at anything else. Honest Americans who install flooring get thrown to the curb.I hate Home Depot and never shop there. Cheesy Chinese junk and a bunch of drunk, has-been ""handy men,"" standing around giving bad advice. The flooring products are laughable.The only saving grace is that Depot customers who dare to buy flooring will get a terrible installation and pay retail for it. You go, Freedom Riders.This company is a complete disgrace."
"Dumped 10 dollars on great earnings , #$%$ ! Lost myself in some options today ...... can?t believe this , unreal"
this is the only stock that doesn't see hard corrections like other big companies.
Barons said the Bull Market May Not be dead but all know it was a correction where the right people got what the wrong people had.
August or September. dang Yahoo misspelled for me again
This is the best buying opportunity we’ve had in awhile!
MUTUAL FUND MANAGERS WANT TO KEEP THEIR JOBS GO TO THE HAMPTONS ETC. FOR THAT U BETTER HAVE HD IN YOUR PORTFOLIO. 245+ IS NEXT. BBBY HAS TO SELL PROPERTY TO SURVIVE!!! JUST LOOK AT THE SHORT INTEREST IN THE STOCK!!!...LOL
"Oh, pleeeze! Is Home Depot tanking because of it’s management, performance or business plan? Or is is tanking along with the rest of the market just because of what’s being said and done in the White House?This just ain’t Home Depot. Most other solid stocks are being hammered, too."
HD is up 7.54% to 195.47
Easily $200+ within next 6 months. Don't believe the naysayers!
"Home Depot will lead the Dow higher for the day, however we will end up seeing more losses by the end of the week"
last chance below $250......storms are a coming already across the Atlantic.....people have been pack8ng these places .....spending that Trump money he sent....
got to be fake drop
Just buy February itm contracts. Or buy this dip. It will go back up.
"Look what you dopes put in the White House. And this POS won only due to technicalities in the antiquated, useless, obsolete electoral college system. Thanks a lot, Bushbots."
spring a good time for HD..like Christmas for other retail
It’s the market not the companies!!!!!!!
Pretty sure it wont break 284 anytime soon.
"Ha ha ha. This company actually has negative shareholders equity. I had never even heard of that terminology until it was brought up here. As a long, you own less than nothing."
PEOPLE SHOULD BUY THIS STOCK ON THE DIVIDEND ALONE.
This will hit $237 by tomorrow
"Bought a position in HD, at the close, today. Have been waiting to get in and after the dip, looked like the right time. Let's see how this plays out."
"What is ""sad"" is when people exploit a tragedy that HD had no role in (from a liability standpoint) in an effort to try to manipulate a stock."
That high was short lived
I love HD. Buying more today as soon as more funds clear....
"This will all be over in May. Let the shorts have their fun and buy only the stuff you know will come out on the other side. Idiot shorts everywhere, even Chinese shorts who can barely speak English. Yoo betta watch out cause market go zero! Take a hike!"
Plummeting like a house imploding...
Slowly going up AH 
"I always wonder about the, ""contractors,"" who buy things from The Depot. Really? No contractor I know would touch that junk. The only, ""contractors,"" who buy Home Depot junk are over-the-hill drunks who act as handy-men, because that requires no insurance or real knowledge and they have the customer order ahead for product because they can't float a few hundred dollars worth of junk."
I used to love Home Depot but now I feel they’ve gotten a little too big for their britches
Democrats can go pound sand I'm done with them and the ridiculous attacks
"$HD is getting seriously overvalued. If you're looking for a bargain in home improvement, $HBM.DE trading at 8x earnings vs 28x for HD. With a far stronger balance sheet."
This stock is so abused by traders and speculators and manipulation. Unbelievable what a bad idea it is to buy this stock at $208. Must be all trumpers buying it. I wouldn't touch this with a thousand foot pole.
"As usual, there is a Home Depot and Lowes next to each other in Riverdale, NJ. I pull into the Home Depot, the place is packed with a line outside. Heck with that, I went to Lowes and there was maybe 20 cars in the parking lot. Yes, I own HD stock and yes its frustrating having to shop at Lowes, just don't have all day to get in and out of HD>"
Sleeper set up. Grab weekly 290c now @.19
Nothing can go wrong Buy Buy Buy Please keep it going.
"Planning to go LOng on this baby before the close today. An earnings play, I expect a very good earnings report, EPS and Revenue above consensus, and positive guidance going forward, to give us a nice pop tomorrow."
Wallstreet crooks pumped so high so that they could short soon
"This stock is a no-brainer now after the dip it's taken. I don't care if interest rates creep up a little more. With all the hurricanes and rebuilding needed, this stock can't go anywhere but up. Plus, if people aren't going to build homes as much, they'll be renovating.."
Home Depot is the Costco of the construction business.
These analysts are clueless. HD and LOW downgraded to neutrall from credit Swiss. I’m buying this morning!
"The Covid lock down hoaxathon - Tyranny crimes against humanity. FLU cases down 95 percent , Some say computer generated event 201"
"The sell off in HD Stock is really pretty stupid. Really, from 215 to 180? $35 bucks a share is like 15% that is nuts. This company is solid and will continue to perform as the underlying business is sound and everybody needs what they sell. Stuff breaks constantly and needs updating replacing. This is a market segment that every homeowner spends 2-3K a year on their homes regardless of good times or bad times. That has to be sourced. Really, where else are they going to go ? Sure Amazon and Walmart will have some sales, but really?"
Awful quiet
Own 550 shares of Home depot! I love it too!
LOL R is just a small potato cheap scotch drinking trader PERIOD!! Warren Buffett my mentor made most of his money in a handful of stocks!!! and did he sell a single share of coke when it traded at 40 times earnings years ago? No and ko hit all ltime
"New home sales....i completely blew it when i mentioned on the board that home sales were down in the Seattle to Everett area. A local real estate agent called today for a spring change and we talked for about 15 minutes on the Housing Market. He sold five homes in the last month. He mentioned that back in April there only 700 Market listings and prices definitely shot up. He said that now there are 2100 Market listings in the Seattle to north of Arlington and prices have leveled off, but the Market is still Hot and that's nice to know and Edmonds is still SWEET. Over 11,000 garage door service calls in the whole area and ZERO bad checks and we don't take credit cards. That has to be a world record...."
There’s a major housing shortage if housing starts have slowed it’s temporary bc of supplies and will be addressed to meet demand. You can bet on it .
"Buy AZEK, vertical integration is smart."
Looks like the run might be over!
"Don't worry Cramer said all who bought last week will make money next week.. He also said that Bear Sterns was a safe place to put you money two weeks before they were killed by the FED. When questioned later about his call, he said he was talking about the bank. The bank! All stock show and he was just talking about the bank!."
"No job, no savings, retirement cut in half, cant pay my mortgage....but hey, my lawn looks great and I just repainted the shed!!"
"21 year average is over 20%? why would one sell, unless it's keeping you from something else?"
Upside potential baked in at this level...down side level unlimited especially if the FED and those who loaded in the 150 level pull the rug out from underneath retail investors to collect their return. I'd be very curious to see how many of HD purchases were placed using a HD CC where consumers will be very likely to default on if they follow the same tends other credit sectors are currently seeing. Last week mortgages payments being late jumped by 50% next reporting is in June...China and Trump renewing trade wars throw into the mix and the highest unemployment rate and counting in history....
I just ate a peruvian pan flute to prove my point
Options market is predicting big move up in the next 5 days. Huge call volume for week out.
"HD appears to be transitioning to full self-check, and now many of those are card only (no cash). From my conversations with the staff I don't believe they like it and I always see shopping carts with merchandise that appear abandoned near the check-out. I do know that my local Ace Hardware has a lot of staff, no self-check and generally competitive prices. HD stock has been good to me, but I'm unloading it."

"All in on $225 puts for 12/27. Everyone please sell your shares. Insiders are selling at an alarming rate. Company cannot figure out e-commerce. They're banking on being big enough and selling enough in store to keep them ahead. However, their management is too old to execute. They're pulling a costco in terms of online and that's not good for HD who is not as diverse at Costco's business. They literally need to just copy Target and they can turn it around. I can see this being a big loser overall next year with the only thing keeping this at 200$ is the dividend. I'm never a bear but wow. Millennials and Gen Z prefer Lowe's too because a lot of them don't like how the owner of the company is friends with Trump and management doesn't believe in investing in it's workers to have good turnaround rates."
"I hope that dip to 204.65 was so they could buy back a ton of shares, huge volume"
Where was the earnings call held on the west coast
InvestorPlace and Barons have different opinions on HD
218 looking like a nice entry point.
Back to 210 by the end of the week where it belongs.
"A long time ago, if your house got damaged, you either had insurance or you paid to get it fixed. What's gonna happen this time? Seems like the people who are gonna get stuck with the bill are the people who don't live there. Gotta hand it to poker faced TX governor for trying to shaft Hurricane Sandy victims and now sits there with his big Texas hand out, begging for $180 Billion dollars. Amazing how times change."
LIKE COSTCO YOU NEVER WANT TO SELL HD IMO!!
3m (mmm) is tanking huge as they dropped their annual earnings forecast from 10.54 to 8.68 to 9.03 a huge warning and the stock is falling big ah. Now if you go to Home Depot you will see a large amount of mmm products there from particle masks to sandpaper from plastic wall hangers to blue masking tape from electrical connectors to sealing tape from hearing protectors to roofin material so be careful hd was a 35 dollar stock 3 years ago and can take a huge tumble on a similar warning ..Also see it was on the top 5 stocks to sell list published yesterday ..

Did anybody have a doubt? HD killed it..
"Home Depot just raised there Div. $1.03 per share,"
"What a difference going to a Home Depot in Reno vs the Bay area. People working there actually speak English, know where things are, and actually help you."
If you don't wish to become a loser I urge you to dump shares of HD pronto before the deluge.
"Surely Home Depot looks for the best prices, in order to compete on a global scale."
"How to lose a service call in one easy lesson....i received a call from a lady that wanted us to come out to reprogram her two opener hand units. i asked her if she was married and replied in the positive and told her how he could reprogram them in a couple minutes and save 65 bucks. She said that she also had to reprogram her car. Many cars program differently and we end up calling the girls at Home Link (1-800-355-3515 a free service) and they walk the customer through the process. i asked her if she wanted their number, but she replied in the negative and hung up. If we weren't so backed up with garage door work, i certainly would have taken her $$$$. i've never seen a husband that couldn't push a button...."
I shop Lowes mostly because of military discount. Is this a nuance that could affect the price?
"While I usually feel political posts should go elsewhere, I will make an exception. Working with the U.S. intelligence community on several projects I could not resist giving my thoughts about what has been going on in this country for quite a while. Disclaimer: I voted for neither Presidential candidate of the major parties during the 2016 election. ""Who rules America""?After forty years of observation, readings, and conversations, it's the elites via their organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.They are the primary drivers behind the efforts to impeach Trump. They are using their assets in the Press, the intelligence community, the media, etc. for the impeachment of Trump.They had heavily invested in getting the Clintons into power. The Trump election and the Brexit were major blows to their plans for a one world government run by their shills like the Clintons, JImmy Carter, George Bush I, etc.They cannot control Trump like the others. During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an add in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because unlike Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, the Clintons, etc., they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans.We have met the primary enemy and they is us!"
That 170 a few weeks ago was intraday.
"SHEP. HERE............................. If you have a huge profit in Home Depot shares and plan to leave them to your children someday, you might want to check out the STEPPED UP BASIS change that the D's want to do. They want to control the Senate so they can get the STEPPED UP BASIS taken away. So, that when you die, your heirs will pay tax on your stocks based on what you paid for them. Now, if you die, your heirs can sell your stocks tomorrow and not owe any tax."
Strong Sell rating.. Will not see $135.90 again this year. .
I tried to buy a new $1000 bathroom vanity top today. none of their contractors wanted to install it. they're all looking for the big killing. so home Depot loses the sale. it's a problem
overvalued by about 30%
Value too high for circumstances
"Crooked lying corrupt Trump is ruining the economy...impeach, please..."
When is the last time you went to Home Depot.The parking lot is filled with costumers.This stock should climbing instead of dropping.This is nothing but ridiculous. There sales have to be booming.
"Housing booming. what's not to like? Blowing it's competition away, see LOW! They raised div. Trump 2020=HD 300+ yr end. imo"
Looks like a good open this morning. Maybe we’ll shake off any ex-divy date dip.
"Wild, wild west for HD today. I still believe that HD is the NO-BRAINER STOCK AT THE MOMENT."
Yahoo Finance says Home Depot to pay big on Georgia voting law.
With business’s closing they should’ve closed the Markets and start up went over. Just another example how everything favors the top 1%
Dividend yield rising
A 23 PE and 10% earnings grow and a 2.4% dividend. And this after tripling over the past 5 years. This company is a long term investor's dream at current price. I go there weekly for supplies and can never find a parking spot <150 ft from front door. You pajama boys are lost!
Coming down. Hold firm
"My next Stock Split Sherwin Williams 3 for 1 split on the close of business on March 23, 2021. Reason from the Board of Directors is to make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader base of investors. Sherwin Williams share price 249.75"
How many of you are buying shares tomorrow and betting on Cramer's strategy? I've never bought this stock. I did look at charts for the past 3 years and it did go up after Thanksgiving. Nervous and need advice.
I was really hoping the sell off would be over strong company all around ready to see money and investors move back in
Anyone heard if HD is considering filing for bankruptcy? Joe Biden has been saying this for years...
HD will test 113
"The Depot is the Home for drunk handymen, clueless DIYs and illegals.How about having a vodka/burrito/tile installation fiasco? Nobody with a clue shops there. Just get drunk and have Mexicans show clueless suburbanites how to put tile and LVP in incorrectly. Over charge them as you usually do and if anything goes wrong, there's no warranty."
"More of us women are shopping at the 'depot' THAN ever before. Plus I just had my kitchen remodeled by the 'depot' It was so easy to do! All I did was make an appointment with the ""kitchen designer"" and she spent 2 hrs with me and my dimensions and Home Depot's Design center came up with a total 'NEW COUNTERS AND CABINETS' Plan for me!! It was the most pleasant experience. When the workers were finished they cleaned up behind themselves like pros. Plus Gennifer (MY DESIGNER FROM HD) called and made sure I was satisified with the work... It was an amazing experience!"
By 11 this will be over 300
"what is the status of the Hurricane? they say it should intensify as it hits land. will lift home improvements stocks as it recks havoc and oil should recover, as it reopens rigs that closed."

BOYCOTT AMAZON
Value investor....why is it there is always a village idiot like yourself that claims a particular stock will drop even after the largest drop in 10 yrs?? It is just stupid....nothing goes straight up or down so even if the higher growth days are behind HD at least for a few Q's after a 5% drop it will bounce.....wall street is forward looking so after the selling subsides which usually takes a day or two to get margin calls out of the way a stock will usually begin to recover.....
Reverse split coming son.
"HD has a high PE, pricey here"
"HD is a great company. However, it is overbought. You can blame the analysts for sky high valuations on these stocks and the reason they fall after a record ER. $280 is a better valuation..."
"ATT HD IS THE OF THE DOWN 30%IF YOU BUY IT AT THIS POINT YOU,LL GET THAT 30 to 40% HD IS A HOT BUY NOW …."
Powell is bringing up market
Is anyone buying under $150 today? Or waiting for $145?
Any thoughts on the week to come?
Any idea why HD so strong today ?
"In the old days, Texas used to talk about seceding all the time. My guess is they wait for their $180B Billion handout before they start that rant again."
EARNINGS Next Tuesday! Look for blowout quarter!
"Up 100 points from the recent bottom, making a new all-time high at 252!!"
purchased more early then a second time then a third..I may go for 4 and 5 tomorrow..
"I work in realestate. I don't own any properties, but manage for realestate investors/developers of single and multi family homes. What amazes me is that people are renting $1000 and $1,300 homes instead of buying. These are people with good jobs. I was talking with some of the tenants and they work in the plumbers union making good money and a couple with her spouse work for Fedex. These people are not buying, but renting. I think this is a trend. Home sales may be low because people don't want to buy, but rent. I have a friend that I tell all the time...""You should buy a house instead of renting."" He doesn't want to. He is happy renting. So many people would rather rent than buy."
Iremember when this stock was around 90 bucks a share....def missed the boat on this one.

blue light special
Need massive sell off here. Take markets back to reality. Daily head lines hope for another virus treatment etc. Just to pump markets up. Uts not reality. Thousands of points in Nasdaq. Need at least 3 thousand Nasdaq sell off here. Dow a thousand or or 2 thousand here.
"This is great theater. Welfare Mart and The #$%$ Depot have been trying to create a steel wall that blocks these companies from other retailers and protects their use of illegals. Welcome Amazon. Hey, I hate Amazon, but I can't wait for them to take down the Orange Slave Market. Independents like me have had enough of these criminals ruining America from the bottom up."
10 percent overvalued; fair value is 165; when a stock fails to rally with good earnings next stop is down
Right now feeling pretty good about this stock and the strength it showed Friday. Could run up to 240 - 250 before earnings in November.
$HD Upgrades Guggenheim Securities Buy USD 310
"Home Depot is a powerhouse. Real Estate market is strong with low rates. Overreaction at its finest. Trump will push back Dec tariffs and this will be back up in no time. Look at the 5 year chart, only trending up and will continue."
"$220 close, that would be nice."
Hoping for a very positive financial report on the 25th. Looking for Home Depot to hit $250 and raise dividend. They have not disappoined me very often in 30 years. Go Depot!!!

Sales are up more than 50% since 2019 but stock price is barely up 10%? Some hedge funds are playing games with us longs.
This must’ve been a Zack attack making Motley Fools of investors
"Just bought and plan to hold for quite a while. I own some $HD as well, but I sort of like going with the higher growth company and one that can be a bit agile. I prefer Lowes personally to HD bc of the good lightening and friendly people. I think we are going to see a run up in real estate and investment in property and homes over the next 5 years, and I can't wait to buy more $lows. I also like a company that treats its employees right, bc tenured employees are happy employees, and happy employees create happy customers."
Not a single sell rating. All buys and outperforms only a few ratcheted down targets.
Why down so much today?
"The best thing about a President Biden will be the taxing of unrealized capital gains. Also, raising the capital gains and dividends tax rate from 20% to 40% will go along way towards solving income inequality. Anyone that can afford to speculate on Stocks can also afford to pay a LOT more in income taxes. Biden 2020 - Harris 2024"

"Honestly the top and bottom bands are so far apart this could go down to 202 range easily with any pressure.

I am remodelling my kitchen and HD is scheduled Granite Counters Top in April! YA.
Do any of you longs here deny that HD willingly and knowingly uses illegals every day and in large numbers. This ought to be interesting.
And what is the short ratio on HD???
"Siting on $600K cash looking for 12 good quality large caps to buy! HD is on my list, going to buy ten $5000 buys as market crashes.

"I?m long on the housing industry in the United States. Biden?s infrastructure plan calls for 640 billion over ten years. Also, we have a growing population as well as a good portion of millennials planning on purchasing homes in the next two years. Also, Home Depot and Lowe?s both sell lots of appliances which are #$%$ (not their fault) which will inevitably make people come back for more to replace them. All these factors combined with a strong balance sheet and solid dividend history makes Home Depot and Lowe?s some of my top holdings."

Ouch. I'm glad that HD is in my IRA and I have no immediate need to sell.
"Target popping after ER. They're Amazon proof, buy HD and Lowe's aren't?"
HD should get a lot of the free reno money to be handed out in Texas thanks to the US taxpayer. Glad that Trump is behind bailing out Texas. Probably would turn down California if hit by major earthquake. I expect 20% Increase in profit for the next 4 quarters.
"not sure who the Michael is but 1989 Home Depot did a 3/4 to split if you had two thousand shares it became 3000 in 1993 for two became 4591 same thing became 6092 became 8000 in 93 they had a 443 split equals 10666 shares in 97 did a 3/4 to split which equals about 16,000 shares 98 two for one so you got 32 thousand shares and in 1999 or 3/4 to 48 thousand shares so none of your math is correct"
US. Retail sales fell 1.2% in Dec. -AP
"People need to relax. This isn't a day trader stock nor is a less than 10% fall a crash. Besides that, no HD executive consults yahoo finance chat rooms for advice. You are wasting your energy. If the fall is so intolerable, here is a tip: sell. It is your right to do so. Otherwise, suck it up and be a big boy and deal with the fluctuations. No stock ascends every week."
WOW want a day
20-25% div increase coming on Tues 2/20 should provide a boost.
"$240, then $250, then $260 by Dec 1. This is the biggest home renovation season and HD is the only home supply store that matters. Also, it's now a tech play. And it's also an energy play. Also, its going to start selling fake meat at checkout lanes. Going through the ceiling! Buy before you can't afford it anymore"
do i sell or just keep riding the wave???
Careful kids....almost time to start shorting heavy at the bid. Lock those profits in!
"Not a definite buy until under $138, will watch though. I give it 2 weeks."
"If you are a Home Depot fan, here's what I want you to do: Put a big sign in your front yard that says, ""I knowingly and willingly support Home Depot's use of illegals to install flooring products.

"Don't want to put cold water on the bulls, Its will be back to $139 for a pull back."
Sell your shares of HD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #$%$ is about to hit the fan.
Income statement is rock solid and strong.
Unbelievable how barely if not unknown analyst can say short sell or almost anything and trigger a selloff
SANP just like I said better grab some... moving up fast INTV also... Cranking..
wanna buy in not sure if it will ever go back to 200-201 thoughts
"Can someone explain me why good valuable companies like LOW and HD are dropping? I was shopping today. WM, Costco, LOW, HD all good value on sale."
My DaD said that Home Depot Increased it's Quarterly Dividend by 15.7 Percent. (I didn't know that)He also said that x-dividend date is 3/7/2018 payable on 3/22/2018.  <--My Dad (He's a tough dude!)
Cases and Hospitalizations are spiking in 20+ states.More bad news coming on weekend.More shutdowns likely!!10% drop on Monday!! Black Monday!!
N I C E... Doing well for to say Thank You HD...
Looks like More women are now shopping at Home Depot than men are these days. I even see them in the Plumbing aisle!
Peeps going back to the office means less time working on projects ??
Buy HD and LOW for the summer. Best low risk stocks to withstand markets ups and downs. HD will be 160 and LOW will be at least 95 in May. I own both but HD is my favorite. Strong reviews will make these two good for months to come. Tax reform will add more to the PT's.
Recession looming... higher gasoline prices always screw the economy.
certain HD stores currently matching 11% rebate that Menards offers.
no worries 1 down day is not a trend I added back in March at crash lows so it's all gravy
I expect these stinking analyst to continue to cast clouds of doubt
"Get the builders across the country to stop buying for one week? If that don't help, stop for two weeks see if that don't change prices."
I think HD only should pay minimum wage to all employees!
outstanding gain today in a red market
310 this morning!
Nice premarket.. Should see HD do what lowe's is doing a 4-5 dollar bounce back ++
Guys we need 487
Went by Home Depot to buy a tool today to support the “Buy”cott. Ryobi makes some wonder battery operated tools. Nice to have an excuse to buy a another one. Parking lot was over flowing. Stock looks good to. Nearly 19 billion in cash generation last year and growing.
Those HD calls wow. I called it
Oversold
All their commentary both good or bad hasn’t effected the company business but the stock price and cost the average investor money.
"Hello boys , time to short H D, Dimbo Cramer is recommend it , sure to put money in the bank"
holy CR@P!! 15.7% div increase..stores profits open more than 1 year grew by 7.5% BEAT ACROSS THE BOARD.
What a buying opportunity......
Should be a stock split soon
This is bulldung!!!
Looks like it’s making its way back to the $180’s
"HD stores are very busy, SO HD EARNINGS sure be very strong, it can reach history high after EARNINGS report,"
"Wait for conference call, Coronavirus impact???"
"Home Depot which is ran by a conservative crushed earnings and raised its guidance. Lowe’s, which is ran by a liberal is closing stores...the more you know."
So glad I added at March lows
When cramer says something is good it usually crashes. sorry
Is HD making a turnaround
Don't get caught without a seat! The music is about to stop and drilling will start.
"Google for ""flooring installer shortage.""The industry is undergoing a crisis level shortage of qualified installers. Thanks, Depot.Fifty percent of new installers drop out and pursue other careers.Major complaints? The pay is terrible (Thanks, Depot,) too many illegals who work for free (Thanks, Depot,) lack of paid training (Thanks, Depot,) etc, etc, etc.The Home Depot almost single handedly ruined this trade. Ironically, they have one of the worst reputations when it comes to quality. Bernie could have trained 1,000 installers with the money he gave to Trumpenstein.Instead, he expects broke 18 year olds to travel 1000 miles to some half baked flooring school and spend six weeks away from their family while they earn nothing.Thanks, Bernie.What a short sighted, stupid company this is."
"3 big down days, what’s the problem?"
"Looking for a stock split soon. This will make HD even more attractive. Existing home sales rising. More home improvement projects and traffic in all the stores. I don't care for Cramers "" Had Money"" side show but even he touts both HD and LOW recently. Good safe stocks to have and hold."
Also failed to mention increased same store sales. What am I missing?
Money Monday great start to the week before earnings
Where are all the bashing trolls from yesterday??
"Craig Menear, chairman, CEO and president. “We also achieved the highest quarterly net earnings in company history. ""Street's reaction doesn't make sense!!!"
"why are we down, now?"
Below 300 by Friday
Looks like 185 is coming
"HD was selling for 3 cents a share in 1981that's a factor of 6833using margin you could be up 6833 x 2000 = over 13 million$1,000 x 13 million = $13 billionI actually thought about buying it and sitting on it, because the little hardware stores suck in comparison in a lot of ways, and the prices were too high, because of their overhead.Crazy huh?"
"What worries me about HD is the condition and sloppiness of the stores.Lowe's is a neater, better organized store."
"Housing market is at a 12 year high, this is an over reaction. It will stable out in a few weeks."
"175 puts went through the roof yesterday, Sheesh, seeing that now."
"Don't get caught in the trap. This is WAY OVERBOUGHT rsi currently over 75 and trading ABOVE the top Bollinger band which sits at 211, the next support band is all the way down at 209.58."
getting crushed again
"buy! 8 billion.. more like 18... trusts me, I'm surveying the Michael damage from upstate Georgia."
How could HD be down with the market being up 250 points!!!
Here comes $ 240.00!!! HD will have big earnings next week!!!
Man #$%$ ......
Buying HD shares this week.Adding to my AZEK position too.
Trump will move those Tireff fore DEC cleare to get in to make a lot of money
"love going to home depot, my second home !!"
Lowe’s did better than HD
"Earnings up 86%, Sales up 33%. Helicopter money just starting to flow in. PE 26. High lumber prices are a pass along cost and fewer home starts is a good thing when you can't stock the store shelves fast enough. The rest of this year will be nuts."
why low is up and HD has not go up like Low yet this morning
"I bought this in 88 and have held ever since, never bet against HD. I make more off it's dividend than I do my pension. I'm benefitting from many stock splits though. I'd like to see a 3 or 4:1 split, it's time."
Was certainly due for a drop based on housing starts and downgrade but 4-5% is too much. Look for a retrace upwards towards the 187.5 level. However a close 185 or below and it looks like it will break down into the 170s soon.
"Thank god I got rid of this stock yesterday when it was at 285! Waste of time... By the timeit hits $300, you can invest your money into other stocks that will give you better returns"
Time to spilt!!
"HD is a great company, but I think it’ll pullback before it makes new highs."
I will cover my short 200
Likely heading to 147.
The fed is taking away the punch bowlNew home sales fell for 3rd consecutive monthFalling markets reduce wealth effect and less non essential spending at hdLowe’s warned Bd is nextUS new-home sales fell 0.6 percent in February
Hurricane Jose already category 4. Home Depot going to rise even more.
Crazy price.
"PE=28 and should be 15 ,strong overvalued."
share buyback speaks volumes.....no meaningful investment opportunities out there for HD. Management will try to say we are undervalued....Maybe so but that's because growth will be curtailed because of lack of opportunities. Need to diversify?
"No one wants to pay 300$ a share for this stock, time to split it and get it down to the 40s so that investors who just look at the price will buy it. It's just psychological for investors, why would I buy boring HD for 300$ when I can buy exciting Apple for a 100$. Smart investors know the answer but not everyone does."
Buy back under 100.00
I gotta assume solid earnings will pop this right back up
holding strong will be fine in the long run this is just a blip in strength of the compamy
my only green in today's drops looking forward to 300 by div
HD going to $175
NO STOCK GOES UP IN A STRAIGHT LINE. BEAT OR MISS IMO HD WOULD HAVE SOLD OFF! SOLID CO WITH ANOTHER BIG DIVIDEND INCREAE COMING IMO. TWO DAYS OR SO DOWN THEN WE IMO STABLIZE.
Another new all-time on the open. Stay the course.(As an aside - have you seen the video of the remains of the Dallas area HD store that got leveled by the tornado? Ouch!)
Phil Mcrakkin. I wonder if Phil was a contractor for HD and they fired him. He has been posting negative remarks for more than 2 years now.
"Home Depot has no assets. It is simply a computer algorithm mixed with some half-azzzed marketing tards.Buy cheap Chiner Junk and pimp it on AM radio pro-Trump feeds.Donate a few pallets of water to hurricane victims.Throw a million dollars at Tour de France riders until you find out that they are doping.Fling a few million bucks at Trump until you figure out that everyone hates him.Nice company. Low wages, little training, bare-minimum benefits, no career path."
We should see $203.75+ tomorrow
Bad earnings report. Big drop today
So I’m guessing someone leaked something? Up 7 bucks
"Hmmm, looks like the profiteers who bought above $160 have left the building. Good riddance and you had better hope the illegals stay in case you want The Home Depot to (poorly and incorrectly,) install your flooring."
I’m staying till 400
Amen!
why is home depot dropping after that beautiful earnings report
I just spent 48 minutes on a computerized phone call...AND I COULD NOT BUY ANYTHING!Wanted to send my nephew some tools he needed but I couldn't order. #$%$
"GARAGE DOOROPENERS...Chamberlain-Liftmaster Belt Drive openers with the one pc. rail.HD doesn't carry the one pc. rail, so why don't they get their act together and start carrying them?? That's the only way to fly...."
Price of a 2x4 has dropped slightly. What does that mean?
How can you hold HD liable. people rent cars everyday and you don't have to do a background check to get a rental. this is stupid. said news....but still...the company is strong and shouldn't be punished for it.
"Americans who go to HD, how is it? Is it always buzzy?"
$HDTarget Raised by Citigroup Buy USD 288 » USD 375
Nice bounce of that 246 low today looks promising
Buy when others a fearful
"In 25 years of investing, I've never despised a stock this much. When it craters, I will run the streets naked with delight."
"My local HD stores, 3 of them, are looking good with new flooring displays and new kitchen displays. Have to spend money to make money!"
"Overbought, sell signal issued on daily, unlikely to close high enough to negate it, short @ 304."
HD reached an all time high at 217.59
how this stock has struggled or has it peaked for good
Home Depot should just relocate to Kansas or someplace.
Still has room to drop not quite yet
need to check out MIK people at home doing projects in covid close down
"HD China buys will hurt either their bottom line or increase costs. This does not bode well, blame it on Trump and if a long term trade war starts prepare for 52 week lows and expect $150"
i remember that one time i bailed at $230 and was called an idiot on here hehe
"This would be a time to take profits in HD, wait on a pullback."
How about a stock split ... 2-1 or 3-2 it's been a long time
SO MUCH 4 BEING DOWN ON EX DIVIDEND .
Building with the future company SPCE. Make money with a future space project. Buy SPCE now.
"only down 4%, those earnings were terrible"
Buying in the Dip ??
"If you have The Hoe Moe Depot install carpet, you WILL be ripped off. Your carpet WILL be installed by illegals. You WILL pay more than at the local store. And, if anything goes wrong, you WILL spend three hundred thousand hours on the phone with an untrained loser whose only job is to say NO, so you will NEVER get anything resolved. You WILL never get your problem resolved. Funny thing is, most of you WILL buy flooring from The Hoe Moe Depot next time, which is fine by me, because you are too stupid to be my customer, and as soon as I sense that you are stupid, I send you IMMEDIATELY to The Hoe Moe Depot where you will be ripped off, and if anything goes wrong, it will NEVER get fixed and you will spend years on the phone with clueless teenagers who are taught to say NO."
"Based on yesterdays action and todays premarket, new construction has resumed, renovations continued and repairs are being made."
Did the CEO invest in Lowes to make a killing at Home Depot shareholders expense!
Buy under $200 this coming week 
HD is a right wing extremist enterprise.
300 by tomorrow or today?
"HD. A MANIPULATED OVER PRICED STOCK, WHERE IS THE SEC"
"I say. a great day to be bold, and add to HD. increased Div by 10%. still a great co.//.FYI. I am a very long term holder."
nice 5 day gains
"I don't understand HD stock.This stock should be climbing.Every time I go to HD, the parking lot is jammed just llike it was a new Grand Opening."
"U guys feel with new lockdowns and the holiday season Comin, Home Depot can bring outta this channel and test new highs"
CNBC is so negative I can't watch it anymore had to go to Fox business what's happening.
Timber We need Buyers
Seems like much is needed to excite Home Depot stocks to where it is now.
"If anyone who reads this is in Florida, stay safe people! Best of luck. As always, Best Regards. $BABA $JD $AAPL $TGT $AMD $HD"
"Time to let them take HD higher and get ready for sell the RIP LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
5 out of the last 8 earnings the stock went lower after.
"Where are they now? Definition of naysayer: one who denies, refuses, opposes, or is skeptical or cynical about somethingThere are always naysayers who say it can't be done. ."
Time to load up for that nice dividend
My plan was to sell at $277.50 which gives me a 50% profit. No I'm thinking I should keep this until it gets at least to $300.
Fundamentals are looking pretty good compared with its peers. http://www.stockfa.com/stock.php?symbol=hd
HD has no rioters at their stores....only people that work and make things better know where they are anyway
Kroger Third Megadeal????20 NEW Wharehouses ???? I'm changing from $HD to $KR for $PLUG Third Megadeal
"Where will u buy building supplies? There are only about 10 big suppliers and HD is one of the best. You have to consider all of the HURRICANES, TORNADOES, FLOODING, FIRES, HAIL and other natural disasters. Most people have insurance to help them in rebuilding their homes. Think about all the items you have in your house. REFRIGERATOR, OVEN/ STOVE, MICROWAVE, DISHWASHER, HOT WATER HEATER, WASHING MACHINE, DRYER, KITCHEN SINK, FACETS, TOILETS ETC. PEOPLE WILL BE BUYING."
"This smells.....i don't trust media. They wanna destroy USA just to beat Trump. They want POWER. They don't want us to have anything good, it would lessen their control.....Trump 2020. imo"
had a hard day but all good from last quarter good gains
They won’t meet expectations. Or at least most hedge funds don’t think so. There all selling right now
Powell reiterating feds to be patient on hikes
"Just my evaluation on this, when you need something at HD they have the parking lot full of rental equipment, so the customer ends up parking a mile from the store, you can go to ace hardware pull up front and get what you need, and there price is usually the same or even cheaper."
Nick. RH. Is a generic App. Get the TD ameritrade app
LMAO THIS ANALYST opinion...thx for the bash now the SP will fly
I need this little horse to run 3%
"HD stock has been stagnant for 2 years now, this pullback was inevitable. Growth is gone. I sold my shares a couple months ago."
"If someone can't wear a MAGA hat to work, no one can wear an anti Trump hat to work. if one view is hateful, so is the other view.Don't you love the left. Every time they don't get their way, they cry, protest, boycott, threaten, bully, throw eggs, etc etc.No wonder no one can stand them. Its hard to believe anyone believes all the lies they spew. I'm glad to finally see millions of hard working Americans finally stand up to them, and stop letting the left push us around."
At least 283.55 now! We need 4 bucks more please
"The Media , Democrats and Liberals do not control investors."
"Selling this Short ahead of earnings. Stock is significantly over-valued and right at a 52 week high. Very dangerous position for an earnings release. Even if they beat on EPS and Revenue estimates, a pullback in price seems likely. Fair value is well under $230.00. Will hold through earnings release and look to cover my Short at under $230."
i didnt know hd sold apple phones in china??? on sale again low interest rates is going to help hd
"No worries! Remember... Dec.?, Feb.?, Apr.?, July?, Sept.? We are going to be just fine. Time to buy a little more."
Why the hell don't they split the stock already . It's been over 20 years. Plus it would be more competitive with LOW and it likely go back up quickly. C'mon HD do the right thing.
Lowe's gonna lap Depot again 
FORGIVE R HE IS A 70+ YEAR OLD TRADER WHO HAS NO CORE HOLDINGS AND BETS ON IFFY COMPANIES. HE BASHES THE TOP TIER COMPANIES IN AMERCIA AND BUYS THE LOSERS!!!!!...LOL HE IS A EXPERT ON ONE THING THOUGH LOSING MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!….LOL
Ask the FDA to label beer ingredients. First you must get the FDA in charge.
"Fantastic price growth. Realistically, how much more can this grow? I’m hesitant to buy at these prices"
"Odd that the perception is a weaker than expected Irma won't be as good for HD as if it had the devastation it expected. Tens of thousand of people have damage to homes and businesses - which is terrible, but lesser damages are good for Home Depot - people and small local independent contractors can fix minor to moderate damages themselves, and they buy from Home Depot. If Irma had wiped Florida off the map, then you get huge companies come in and rebuild and those aren't the types that buy from Home Depot"
Yes!!!!! It broke 220!!!! Time for break out to start. 225 next.
"Keep buying moo. Just wait until next week when banks start getting rushed for liquidity and those bankruptcies starts adding up. Non have ever experienced this and it is taking atoll on every human and their lives. This have a long way to go before it gets any better . Bankruptcy, foreclosure, massive job losses and businesses closing down for good. You ain't seen nothing yet."
HD is on fire. Back to 235 by Jan.
L
Market is deeply disturbing...very irrational trading activity....will be a very interesting first few months into new year....
No volume
HD will Rally. We saw the same thing happen with Amazon Earnings. It ended up rallying. Earnings are not as important as the FED Liquidity Drive. All Markets up today and this will be up and end of day or tomorrow.
Sure listen to R NOT!! he was pumping M at 19 and bbby at 11....lol he will disappear imo soon. He also posted trash on the msft board. Sure sell the top companies in the World like HD and buy #$%$!
$100 stock based on latest performance. Their on-line sales are dead.
"If you are not boycotting Amazon, your head need to be examined because you are plain stupid."
This share price is stupid. Should easily be 195 range.
"haha Bernie! Another old man badazz wannabe! Better lay off the Viagra Bernie! Youve made it quite obvious that youre Dumber Than A Democrat! This spring we will be upgrading the 1st of 25 apartments my son owns at about $25k per apt...NOT a fuqin DIME will be spent at Home Depot!!! Too bad for your shareholders huh?! Many of whom I bet will be shorting this pos on your eh hem, political news!!!"
"Pretty Dismal Growth114 billion to 119 billion in three yearsOne GOOD caveat, you will be spending MUCH more on Hydrogen FuelCells to facilitate better return and quicker customer online experienceWho is Home Depot supplier???? Same as Amazon and Walmart with Hydrogen FuelCells"
HD is paying for their upgrades with Stock manipulation
Insane not to take some Profits.
A lot of stocks have dropped on good earnings reports this summer. Good news is that such stocks normally bounce back quickly.
go green
84 RSI and trading above top Bollinger this never ends well for longs
PAY NO MIND TO THE SHORTS STOCK DOWN 5% TODAY AND UP 138% SINCE 2015.
"It has barely moved since the correction....when it gets to 150, then we can talk about a sale."
Well your the only one worried about it.
Wow what a crater! Down a messily 5% lol! The negative press amazes me. BUY on this dip! 
Big new all-time! 317+!
Can someone please explain to me why everyone thinks HD will split stock?
I welcome 221. It just means put options will be cheaper on the 220 strikes. Getting ready to lock and load! I love Wallstreet greed
Had to buy at $182
"Relax people !!!! This qtr was proof that HD is ABSOLUTELY killing it !! ...and its not likely to slow down anytime soon..... Let the early sellers get out, and it will lift later today......"
U.S. June housing starts rise 8.3 pct !! Q2 Earnings for HD on 8/15/17 will be a beat. Target Price $165
"Trump figures if he starts a war with Iran, he can't be impeached."
HD tighten up your rental process.
Dec 11 -13 gave us 3 days of opportunity to buy the lows in 210's. Excellent support level
22PE is high
"I think what people are failing to realize is, yes demand for HD products is there and parking lots are full - however products are scarce and there are empty shelves. And if they can fill a shelf, the cost to do so is higher (geez look at lumber up 300%) Have you tried to get your hands on a appliance lately."
The market is overlooking that when interest rates rise people tend to want buy homes quicker and those push prices up. When prices go up it leaves some out of the market leading to existing home owners not able to sell but to reinvest those gains in the home. Where else do people go buy home material? HD. I am long HD just bought a couple calls for June. Stock heading over 200 in next days.
I don’t understand why the price of a stock is falling when junk companies are out performing the market.I understand this is not a day trading stock but mgt needs to have a meeting soon.There is no reason for a stock to be down!
HD AN OVERPRICE PIG
Home Depot reached an all time high at 273.17
Looks like some shorts are covering
Forgot I bought a 320/300 call debit spread lol
"I hope HD can hold the $200.00 mark for a little while. It seems HD goes up slowly, then all of a sudden the market goes sour and HD goes down with it.I have owned HD since the 80s. This is a great stock to own and hold.It seemed that HD was stuck on about $35.00 for years but it broke out and the rest is history. The dividends are great. I bought every share thru a DRIP plan.You should look into DRIP plans. It does not cost you to purchase more shares. If you are a young man this is the way to have a retirement that will not break you.All of you that are going long with HD, I wish you the best of luck for the future."
HD is being a punk right now. Just stuck in a trading range today I need to break out￼
HD heading back over $290 very soon.
"COVID and Money printing unlimitted money printing, think about what they have done to small players, covid most likely is a Hoax, based on behavior of stock market, since we are at all time high and super bubble just kept growing bigger by the FED"
"How will property damage affect earnings due to hurricanes this year? is it all ready factor in? stock plummeted after last hurricane, could we see the same again in share drop? The Fed's interest rates are not helping matters."
We trade with MM's. Meaning we trade with a group within minutes of their buying
"Still long on HD. If it dips further, will pick up some shares. Didn't expect them to guide down for the rest of the year."
"I took LOW for the earnings as I Figured they would get some stroke. But, I believe that HD has the superior setup."
what a nice end of day turn around
"As long as interest rates remain low the housing boom will continue. And they are expected to remain low for a very very long time. That is good news for the homebuilders and the companies that help with home improvement projects like LOW, HD, and SHW. Will sales take a hit after the economy reopens? Somewhat, but there will still be extremely high demand for these 3 companies' products. I remain a bull on all 3 for the long haul and you should be too. HD will take out $300 a share soon and the train will be leaving the station shortly."
17 million more unemployed from March.Bad news look out below.
Unfortunately politics have entered into the Home Depot. Not the stores fault but the sore losers from the 2016 election still cannot get over it. Grow up and stop acting like little children. I did sell my HD stock as political situations usually get worse for a while. Sit back and wait for a better entry level to re purchase the stock.
HD is way OVERBOUGHT
"Shorting HD, LOW, and SHW when the soil is this fertile with a renovation and housing construction boom is like sticking your hand down a running garbage disposal expecting it not to be a bloody mess. My price target for HD over the next year and a half to 2 years is $400. The housing cycle has a long way to go to full maturity. Right now we are only in the 1st inning. All of HD’s products such as lumber, home furnishings, pesticides, tools, etc. are in extremely high demand. I see inventory turnover dramatically increasing as we get further into the cycle. It has already increased dramatically over the pandemic. HD is both a COVID play and a reopening play."
When's the split coming?
SELL SELL SELL!!!more tariffs!
"There service is bad and sometimes even terrible. I avoid it if I can but I can't buy 2x4, plywood, light canisters at the hardware store so I guess that is there advantage.. The people there know nothing, they are either just out of high school or making money after retirement. They have pushed out most of the small hardware stores like ACE. They make money selling volume to the small contractors who buy lumber and then other products."
"So sales are up 25% to $132 billion for the year and the stock is overselling because of some comments about not knowing what the next year will bring? Last year's outlook was a much bigger unkown and it ended up being record setting. Retail sales are beginning to boom, home sales are increasing in value faster than ever, and rates are going no where. All of this and HD is only trading at slightly above fair value AND with a 2%+ dividend."
Irrational selling. Hoping for a rotation on the buy side soon. This is getting silly.
"HD in many index funds, etfs, can't help but go down on a day like today"
"Just in ""Home Depot also hiked its dividend by 10%"" Go Depot!"
Sure dump a company HD that went up 900% over the last 10yrs. Not to smart imo.
HOME DEPO THEFT LOSSES I THINK ITS HIGH ????? ANY FIGURES
Be very careful my friends. dirty game they play. Take that $ and spend it for your kids.
Good news priced in already ?
We need 288
"HD has no exposure to the China trade, no reason for shorting nor selling"
we running today. perfect entry to ride till earnings
"For the clown posting this morning that HD is up again for no reason - here's one of many reasons: Wells Fargo on homebuilders: "".. we have just laid the foundation for this cycle. Per our analysis, there is a long tail ahead, with demand support for 2.3M housing SAAR through the rest of the decade, while supply side consensus is much below at 1.5M"""
Earnings and tropical storms the only catalysts you need for this stock
It might split now if the price continues down
mid 150s looks good
Good call Cramer!
Bad bank and manufacturing #s and you still are buying an overbought bloated pig at the top. Guess you need to learn the hard way that greed doesn't pay. Shorting more at these levels!
Too far too fast sometimes stock price needs a rest
And the fires and now floods
"I've been boycotting The Home Depot for years. They use millions and millions of illegals to install their products. They do it through shady labor shops. It's a well known ""secret,"" in the trades. As more of my associates learn how it negatively affects their lives, they have stopped shopping there as well. Besides, most of the products are junk. The flooring installation tools, for example, and adhesives, etc are super low quality and pretty much useless."
"I don't get it, Lowes misses and goes up $8, HD hits the mark and goes down $8. Can someone explain this to me?"
"over the past 8 years this stock, lowes and other home improv sector co's all benefited from fed action and QE. this game has changed and now works against them. lock in profits and await clarity."
Not much volume but heading towards all time high!
Big Joe been shorting this since the HOD and I am just getting started. Easy pickens. Going to unload heavy at the bid. GLTA!
Like I said people buy puts or sell shares in this dumpster fire. they can't figure out online and it shows. they don't invest in security at all.take your money in biotech or semiconductor this is terrible.
Love this stock! Why anyone would short it is beyond comprehension.
this junk will fall to $20
Life hack. Always believe the opposite of whatever the media claims.
It’s those after hours short sellers you have to worry and like an unfair advantage
"Ok now I know I have better odds on the blackjack table then the market,,for the fact you do your research the earnings report is positive and the stock drop harder then it has in 2 yrs. BS. I will lose for the last time on HD I will never trade it again for the trust in investors fact."
We should see a split after earnings
Hd will crash with the market
I blame the democrats
Anybody Stupid Enough to Sell HD stock now should see a doctor and stop trading. This Storm Harvey will put a huge amount of cash in share holders pockets. Example. every ducking Named Storm to hit USA has had a very positive effect on Home Depot. Better Buy Quickly..
I’ve haven’t seen HD pumped and Dumped every time it goes up a few $ before

"I have been a customer for over 14 years!!! I charged and paid every month, over $75,000.00 ( which has been cut into little pieces). I was in their store in Brookhaven, Ms in Feb. One of their employees owed me, and I had a guarnessment on them. I walked upon her, surprised, didn't do anything but walk away from her etc..she.called POLICE TO ARREST ME!!! STORE VIDEO SHOWS I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HER OR HARRESS HER...SHE CALLED POLICE AND TRIED TO HAVE ME ARRESTED !!! FOR BEING IN THE STORE. STORE video will show I did nothing!!! Police didn't arrest me, know me, and left. THIS IS WHAT HOME DEPOT DOES TO LONG STANDING CC HOLDERS IN MISSISSIPPI!!! DON'T SHOP THERE.. LIBS ALL THE WAY! GOING TO SEE A LAWYER!"
Value line says HD number one in safety and has A+ FINANCIALS. Read it for yourself.
"Currently, HD stands at 246.50, how much will the price go higher immediately after they announce earnings ? any Guess ?"
Great long term stock. Stress free capital gains and nice dividend.
sell HD and invest in a saving account at .50% interest....yeah right. This'll be back when the hysteria is over.
Wait till the 10% tariffs hit you nearly everything in Home Depot made in China
Someone determined for HD to go down relentless selling for no business related justification
"Home Depot stores in Florida say their shelves are almost empty as buyers are frantically buying lumber, generators and everything else."
I love this stock 
"do you hear split, what a great company h.d."
Great online ordering process. Much better experience than AMZN and on Lowes you can't find anything.
No lose trade here. Hold for long term if it comes down. If it goes up hard sell or hold.
Seems like a good day to lose money!
best of my big stocks today beat out CAT and Appl I'm ok after a rotten week no big deal it's what the market does
What’s the pop after hour?
So you like Money check out SANP. Find plenty...
This is imho a FOREVER hold stock. What investor trades in and out of his winners? WFC upped HD pps target to 235.
Why did the market bring HD to $150 today? The answer is simple: the Maximum Pain for the HD options expiration this coming Friday (you guess) is $150. This is the level where the WallStreet insiders are making max profit and everybody else are losing.
This would be a good point to start or add to position
You are an idiot. The white house and GOP are eroding every right and freedom we have. Trump is taking credit for Obama having to work for 8 years to clean up the last GOP mess.
the billionaire Dems sell or what?
By 2020 this nonsense won’t happen or even a issue it’ll be something else
HD delivers online. I order and they deliver. No need to go in the store.
"What about the ex-CEO donating $30M dollars to the Trump syndicate? Why? What does he want from Trump? Nothing is free. Nobody, especially a former CEO gives away this kind of money without expecting something in return."
When does the buyback start
What has been happening to Home Depot? They don’t seem to make any more gains now. They can’t get past their last high.On top of that Lowes seems to be creeping up on them very quickly.￼￼

"I have been going to my HD in New Jersey now for almost 5 yrs straight and have always been able to park somewhere near the front ,Since my HD has been open during the pandemic i have seen the cars and trucks multiply in their parking lot making a once very accesible HD now that you have to park in the nose bleed section way out and walk a 200 yards to get to the front entrance , just as all HD,s they are doing a massive service to all homeowners and most homeowners have time on their hands to do projects just because of the boredom of stay at home , i bought 100 shares last week at $235 after dumping my Tesla stock and figured this is going to be one hell of a stock when this is all over ! Great time to be in this thing if their ever was an opportunity the opportunity is now ! Good luck fellow investors !"
Loaded heavy on 220 and 222 puts around HOD will short heavy as well into the reversal. I plan to get paid 3 ways on this crash mark it
lowes is doing very poorly also
Why this not 5 up there was 8 cars parked in curbside Hd
disappointed with hd. Thought this stock price would be around 300 by this time.
low volume
Only 279 today :(((
been a heck of a run last month.....laughing at all the idiots that were selling back in december
If we can take out $179.25 today we should see the mid $180's by the middle of next week.
Up 80 dollars since March 4th
How it is lost $5 today? 282 now!
I got my profit $165.60 and good luck yo all.. better be sorry tomorrow
Was hoping to pick up shares at a bargain price of $299. After listening to most recent guidance I thought it was impossible. But the market God's are sometimes kind and now I have a shot to buy shares on my terms. Wish me luck.
Big discount of HD at that price their investments will pay off and so will ours
Home Depot reached an all time high at 250.86
14% below all time high. Considering the circumstances not too shabby!
"Hold on tight, will make a comeback!!"
"When it comes to growth I prefer LOW over HD, when it comes to dividends I prefer HD over LOW, so I compromise and own them both. Both are still reasonably valued to undervalued when looking at their PEs, both have tremendous potential due to pent up demand for housing construction and home improvement...in short I expect both companies to benefit tremendously from economic reopening and be able to sustain and grow their current sales numbers achieved during the pandemic. I also expect inventory turnover when it comes to lumber to improve dramatically with resumption of lumber production at normal levels, which will decrease prices. There is no bear case to be made here. Their entire inventory of products will sell well over the next few years and there will be massive P/E multiple expansion as well."
Is the sudden price drop due to going Ex-Dividend? Drop is higher than the dividend amount of $.89
"The fact is it is now time to get your retirement money safe , before the massive drop that is now coming. I would not be buying any stock now and wait for the massive drop that is now coming. Things are slowing fast as the DEM wits stopped spending and have started hoarding cash . The next to come is layoffs and they are already starting a massive slow down. It's like someone turned off the buying machine."
Bet lots of shorts getting rich. I got to old to short. Got stomach ache
Just when I added we get this. My timing is terrible.
"Look at 1 month chart, every time moved few bock then next day drop like rock."
unreal drop on this starting to liquidate high flyers and starting a position now.

"Someone should hold the Credit Susie’s analyst personally balky responsible for this mess. $8.00 per share earning, 50% payout at @4.00. Show me a better ratio? As a long time HD vendor and stock owner since 1983, let me tell you, I have made 65% of my retirement on HD and my ex-buyers have millions from their 401k’s. Disregard the newbie comments on this great company"
"I suspect all the bears thumbs downing positive posts about HD are the same person with multiple aliases. Only an idiot would say HD is going to 0 in the current environment. It is a 99 percent likelihood that Home Depot, Lowe's, and Sherwin Williams will all be trading at much higher prices several years from now. There is almost zero downside risk investing in these 3 companies right now. The only way the housing market boom doesn't continue for a very long time is if an asteroid strikes the US and wipes out half the population, the super volcano in Yellowstone erupts, etc....that's the only hope shorts have for these stocks not to go higher. Given a natural disaster on that scale is incredibly unlikely it is almost certain suicide to bet against the homebuilders and retail building suppliers right now."
Someone said $300 a share......hhhmmm
"VERY HEAVE VOL, UP going back 228 to 230 HEAVEY BUYING"
"Up scope on HD, and LOW too. Nice to own the duopoly.."
"WOW is construction really slowing that's not good for Home Depot and Lowe's no wonder why the traffic is falling off the cliff at HD LOL LOL , Get ready to tank LOL"
here we go baby
"Earnings coming up, will. see how well we’re doing!"
"hey vraiphil, are you poor? all that suffering for a carpet, I can help you. I bought 1000 HD shrs at 35 , that so far gave me a profit of more than 100000, and not counting the dividends. So stop crying and buy some, and change your stupid carpet."
Another day goes by and the GOP says where oh where oh where are all of those illegals that we need to deport in order to excite The Base? They are really hard to find. Follow a rusty white van from the HD loading dock to the house. There's a few in plain sight.
Just think how bad the earnings numbers would be without the stock buybacks? The Federal Reserve can manipulate the stock market but cannot put spending money directly into consumers pockets. Please trade accordingly.
HD sux..I lost money on the stock a few months ago....Same thing happened then… Good earnings but the stock dropped
"Thanks to crooked Trump, we're tapped out. Maybe next year."
Home Depot and Costco are too expensive merchandise with low quality and few selected options. There are much better available for seamless delivery and service starting with Amazon and eBay. Online services from Home Depot and Costco. Online is terrible. We do not buy to return but Costco and Home Depot are far more expensive and less selection
Being telling you guys it will drop to 145

with housing slowing and 10% import tariffs no reason in the world this should not test 5 week lows of 160.53..Do you disagree ?
"Retail sales will slow upon the vaccine’s arrival for stocks like HD and LOW, but that’s not a reason to be bearish. These stocks did well prior to COVID and will do well after. That’s the classic mistake shorts think about stay at home stocks. They assume they are going the way of the dodo after this ends and that they’ll give up most or all of their gains since March. That’s just not the case. If there is a significant pullback it’s a dip to buy, not short. Don’t let the short term scare you out of a buying opportunity."
I'm out thx for the stimulus check.
new high 291.44
Why all the selling?
"Looks like HD had a lot less people this weekend, Surprised it was not packed with people"
"buy, buy, buy"
Housing starts up huge !! HD will rise into earnings....
Anyone have any insight why the sell off is happening here? Bad earnings coming?
Gonna die laughing at shorts if when this ends up in the green today 
retail is getting slammed in ah. M and KSS posted bad holiday sales.

Big moves coming in before er
Without LOW Mgmt help we go down again. Low is a prefect example of the PR we need:1. Add a huge amount to the buyback.2. Talk about margin improvement not additional wage increases.3. Provide good guidance for Q4.It is sad how horrible this Mgmt team has become. One day we dump HD Supply. Now we buy it for more than we sold it.... increasing wages to associates while leaving shareholders with nothing.
"Hey, at least this ain't Hurt Locker. Ticker symbol (FL)"
This could take awhile
Buy anyway because market never goes down.
Low 3% Hd 0.9%Low better for investor
Stock down 30 bucks in a few weeks. #$%$! This is one stock I owned that had a lot of confidence in. Great last quarter. Always growing. Store always crowded. Rolling out more products. I know market down a bit but HD down much more. What gives?
Shorts sure jumped on this bandwagen! Squeeze coming soon!
Buy now.
$30 loss in 4 days? They attack conservative co's. The press/Dem's hate America! imo

"It's all churn. There is no solid direction because there is no conviction. All is spin, all is political, all can be brought down by rumor and innuendo. All can be brought to naught by the appearance of being on the wrong side of the latest cause célèbre."
"With southern and western states pulling back on their openings amid skyrocketing C19 numbers, HD potential only increases. Only 20 percent of their biz is pros, making them immune to housing starts numbers when they become more like housing stops. A well positioned online presence when leaving home becomes impractical. Their sheer volume assures fewer breaks in the supply chain. And yet more time at home, whether you are an owner or a renter, will trigger the impulse to finally do those repairs or upgrades. $$ that were spent on dining out, travel, and entertainment preC19 will be diverted into home improvement."
"Just got back from a HD in LA, Seemed like business as usual...Of course, I got hosed down when I got back to the office."
Remember amazon got into selling appliances HD dropped for no reason. Now beat the street earnings and gave good guidance shares dropping? Thinks good time to buy on this pull back. MM controlling Hd.

"This bad earnings report is a direct result of serious boycotting due to Bernie Marcus’ aggressive pro trump stance and enormous investment in trump’s reelection. He caused this and we investors have been hurt. I observed the decline of in-store customers at my own Home Depot store. Bernie also publicly insulted all Democrats, and we are stock holders and customers. Not good."
"Why HD will eventually explode way over $300 in the near future, expect $300 at this ER and reflected in the rest of 2021 expect $350 targets:1) record snowstorms throughout the country: shovels, snowblower, salt, heaters etc2) Texas freeze crisis: heaters, pipe/plumbing materials etc3) exploding new home markets: building supplies, wood, cabinets, appliances ect4) springtime outdoor clean up: mulch, plants, fertilizer, sod, topsoil5) springtime home repairsOnce investors digest the ""payroll investments: and look at the points above one has to believe HD will pay and reward investors well."

existing home sales down 3%? there's hardly any houses for sale in my area of Pennsylvania!! how can something SELL when it's never been up for sale?
Real estate sell off #2 to begin any day now. Do you remember the time HD was empty ? going to happen soon very soon. The real estate market is topping again. The layoffs are already starting in the mortgage industry. Book your profits now !!

"Yes, people are home doing vegetable gardens and painting rooms. They are NOT doing $60,000 kitchens and baths. You decide how Home Depot makes its money. This stock is still too expensive for a three month shut-down of all commercial activity. I sure don't have ay contractors coming to my house in the next three months."
HD will report great earnings on 5/16/17. Long and strong HD. Last earnings report forecast was great for the next 2 years. Stores have great traffic. People doing lots of home improvements inside and out. $ 160.00

Greedy longs giving back their gains.I warned you home  sales collapsing and fed raising rates causing houses to be unaffordable and helocs rates spiking up removing disposable incomes for Home Depot on top of all this a trade war with China where 75% of everything hd sells is made....
Buying this dip. Awesome quarter and raised guidance
"Nothing but short.... anyone going long on HD is an absolute fool. The charts tell me to short. Common sense tells me to short. Fundamentals tell me to short. Very poorly run stores at this time tell me to short. Short, short short is the only thing to do here."

We will probably see more decline. I am long with HD. HD has been good to me for the last 31 yrs. I honestly do not feel good about the stock market in general. Biden does not have a clue about the economy. The liberal Democrat party is going to be bad for America. Joe has yet to take any questions from the press !!!

YES I SEE ALL TIME HIGHS IN THE HOME DEPOT DOWN THE ROAD. WHY BECAUSE EARNINGS GO UP EVERY YEAR AND BEST OF BREED AND A SAFE HAVEN!! ALSO THE DIVIDEND RAISE YEARLY ALREADY A 10% RAISE!! PLUS NO PORTFOLIO MANAGER EVER GETS FIRED FOR OWNING THE HOME DEPOT!! SOME STOCKS THAT LOOK CHEAP ARE VALUE TRAPS. JUST LOOK AT GM TODAY SUSPENDED ITS DIVIDEND!! AGAIN NOT THE HOME DEPOT.
"I hope everyone isn’t running for the exit, this could get ugly!!"
I am adding a bit today. Love me some HD. This earning report was honest and transparent and not as bad as some think
buy back when we get CAPITULATION.............................
"I see this downdraft as an overreaction. True the move over $200 was too much. A move back to the highs is reasonable for the year in my view. Those who believe HD is tied to housing starts are misinformed. %50 of the housing stock is 50yrs or older. renovation will persist for some time, higher rates mean those locked in lower will not move unless they must. Bring HD to $165 and I will Double my position."
"Whole country is in the dumpster, nothing good or constructive is going to happen until Trump is in the dumpster!!"
you'd have to be crazy to sell this stock
Buying back stock when your PE is 25 is just plain foolish.Not_A_Short
"I would love to add to my HD # of shares but, the high price is keeping me from it. If HD would split and drive the price down you would see many more people getting in. I have a little shy of a thousand shares but, have not purchased any shares in the the 3 or 4 years. I stated buying in the middle eighties when it was dirt cheap compared to today's prices. I have done it all with the DRIP plan. I want to purchase more but, the price keeps me from doing so.You may say that sounds dumb to you but, if I spend $2500.00, I would like to get more than16 shares. It is a mental thing. I have friends who want to buy HD but the high cost keeps them from it."
Wish I had never bought this
Will never buy this trash again
Looks like we're going to have to re-test support @ $184.00 a few more times.! ( ( (((
regardless. we have less money this year and no raise since Trump took office..first time in many years..Thanks crooked lying corrupt Trump.
"I?ve been in this Stock since it 50 bucks, usually don?t pay much attention to what it does. Lately it is getting the #$%$ kicked out of it, pardon my ignorance but could someone please tell me why"
Wow HD looks like a sweet short. Not only a topping pattern but a picture perfect head & shoulders pattern to boot! Out of the money puts!
time to soar shorties !!! haha... 
Can you say split
A DEAL WILL BE THIS YEAR TRUMP WILL BE REALECTED AS PRESADENT MERRY CHRISTMAS
New highs after earnings imo. Plus a flight to quality.
Thoughts on if and when Home Depot will split its stock?

buy Hd today ..this is great opportunity to buy on the dips
opportunities like this don't come around very often! buy buy buy
"i know it's unimportant to unedumacated ""investors"" but have any of you people seen the progression of the decimation of hd balance sheet? they've stripped out essentially every dollar of equity and spent it buying stock from whom? not you. wait till the recession.. they are broke!!! $40 bb in new debt plus the new 15bb to come. they're like the ""rich"" people down the block that spent all their money then disappeared one night and the house got foreclosed. check out mcd and boeing if you really want to see american financial tragedies. these three firmsTOGETHER have zero owners equity . passe right?"
"Always remember the goal is to sell high and buy low. With the massive slowing HD will miss earnings this Q , Earnings will be lower than last year and the stock is a lot higher , Does not look good when you miss earnings at all time highs LOL. Kind of always hurts the stock price. Look for HD to warn. Slowing has been massive. Hurry BUY, BUY, BUY and prove me wrong. Wall Streets rich clients are almost out and Wall Street will be building a very big short position, before they start selling in mass"
One more thing for them to worry about
Who got played buying prior to earnings? I did.
And tomorrow it will drop by 7.00!
"Looking toward #HD earnings release August 18th before the bell. With recent consistent price action and weekly new highs, a miss may incite some profit taking, especially in the dog days of summer with thin volume(where are you going? who's going anywhere?)...Zachs expectation in line with street consensus looking for YOY growth between 6.6% and 8% at avg $US 3.38 ps. Whether meet or beat, I'm staying long and writing time val. With a fairly active history of #HDStockSplits, you will have to be in it to win it if that's on their minds."
Can you say split split split
HD reached a 52 Week low at 153.74
This stock is a never Trumper and you should SELL and buy Axsome therapeutics NOW
BOYCOTT SUPPORTERS OF SINNERS LIKE TRUMP!
oooh this is fun. thanks for the discount everyone
"So, Rush Limbaugh claims that Hurricane Irma is fake news. Well, get a fake snorkel and a fake generator and some fake Oxycontin and a fifth fake wife and ride it out, fatso."
By Earnings HD shares will be trading in the $245 rangeI would take a 5 story dive before I would short this cash rich and cash register-humming monster
The manipulators on HD like Fleas and Ticks on a stray Dogs back
How likely is a 3:1 or greater stock split announcement during the May earnings call? Last split at the end of 1999 when the stock traded in the $60s. Bullish for all the right reasons. Not difficult to see how HD business will benefit from the economy restart.
With the Trumpbolt boycott of Home Depo we should hit 400 a share before Summer.
"Wow, HD opens a distribution center in Dallas. That now makes 60 distribution centers. Why not 185 like amazon. Think how much more revenue HD could capture if they could distribute on a timely manner. Get with it HD. Even Walmart figured it out. They have over 150. I am tired of looking at the HD site and finding out that my product I would order will take 10 to 15 days to receive. Thus I order from another center."
Great buying opportunity on this dip
LOL don't sweat it best of breed. Stock up 12 fold last 10 yrs. Buying back over 6% of shares. Raise the dividend double digits. Stores always packed face it. Good time imo to add. I own a boat load and not selling ever. Do you think Buffett is selling anything today?
"HD!!! Stay home winner! IQST, PCTL!"
companies must be believers via massive share buybacks.
To all HD hourly employees. Congratulations on your bonuses. Enjoy the extra $$$. Just remember who was responsible for this when it comes time to keep the House and Senate in GOP hands.TIA
Can the GOP criminals prop up the market through the election?
hd longs got too greedy thinking it would go up forever..
"I was at the Brewster, NY HD yesterday around 2pm. Store and parking lot was 3/4 full. I saw numerous contractors with their pen and pads getting stuff to keep them going on the job. A necessary evil to start, keep and finish a job. If HD can come even close to perfecting ""express delivery"" this will be explosive for the bottom line. What I saw yesterday at the HD store was a huge untapped opportunity to fill. I know my contractor would use this service."
Lowest tax return ever. Little for any project.
I have started closing down stock accounts that I have had for almost 30 years. I will leave some stocks open so I can get back in when Biden and his liberal left people are gone.. The market in general will have a big correction. I will go to bonds for safety.
1.7 in 8 minutes??? What gives?
"Another Hurricane developing (Hurricane Florence)in Atlantic, East coast should monitor."
Let’s not forget that HD started the year at 172… So folks who are selling here who bought then are still locking in a tidy profit.
"As someone who is renovating his bathroom and primarily using HD as a source for materials & tools, I feel it is appropriate for me to say “you’re welcome” for individually raising revenue and SP. lol I’m joking of course, but I’d be in a much better position if I had bought shares when I started the project! Cheers from team ACB"
HD is a solid company. Bought the dip in mid December and so far so good.Check the 5 year performance chart on HD vs the S&P 500 and that tells you what you need to know!
Hurricane Michael turned out to be worst storm in years. Made others look like a walk in the park. Rebuilding will take the next several years and HD will play a huge roll and keep earnings strong
Time to double down smoke and mirrors
It’s about time that they brought it up
"I never visited this board because HD is such a solid and steady investment that it seemed not worth my while. Well, it's like most other Yahoo boards: 75% of the posts are from disgruntled employees posing as investment experts. I've owned HD since it was trading at $35. There has always been someone to say that it couldn't go higher or couldn't continue to be a successful company. I have done well owning it, and also spend about $10k per year on materials at the stores. If I didn't like the experience or quality, I wouldn't be in the stock. As for Sears, they have been losing ground on appliances for years. This is probably a smart move for them. However, I don't think it's going to move the needle too much. They don't manufacture their own product, so they cannot differentiate that much other than on the periphery. Tieing into Alexa sounds good, until you think it through. What are you going to voice command your appliance to do? You have to load a dishwasher, dryer, and washer. A refrigerator runs full time. The news blurbs talk about using it to turn on the air conditioner. But, if you are into that feature, you already have a Nest thermostat. And, as has already been pointed out, people don't really want to make major purchases over the internet, so Amazon is not going to drive a lot of sales, anyway. Sears already has an Internet presence, and so does everyone else."
KHC Just cut its dividend!! but HD a 32% raise!! I like it! and t what a penny raise a year.
325 open! Any takers?
Any news on a dividend increase???
"AMZN will beat HD one day in the home improvement space, its only a matter of time. They already offer tools and appliances and other stuff. Its only a matter of time before they offer lumber and contractor supplies. My local HD was a ghost town over the holiday weekend meanwhile AMZN trucks are everywhere now."
Pressure down to 963 with last recon pass
250 by July 15th.
This will be a 300.00 $ by next year buy now 
I'm dumping my shares. I'll buy back in 170 range.
"What happened, did the illegal carpet installers finally get deported?"
I predict 300 today.
Wonder how much Goofandhammer got paid for cooperation
Anyone buying here? Just you Mnuchin?LOL.
Why isn’t the current dividend of $1.36 ￼reflecting in the price of the dividends on Yahoo board? It is still at $5.44 per share it should be that plus $1.36￼￼We should be up to $6.80 per share.￼
"expect a new 52 week high today guys , all expectations were beated"
"I have a feeling HD will see a pullback now. What yall think? Yo you should really check out aw-esomeSTOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
3rd straight month of Housing Starts and Building Permit drops !the fed is raising rates which always creates a recession They are going to unwind their massive 4.5 trillion ballance sheet which wil lraise interest rates on houses and everything else !!the party is over you just don't know it yet..https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-06-16/housing-starts-drop-for-third-straight-month
" You can Thank loser lying Obama and democrats for this. I can't even begin to imagine how something like this could possibly happen, can you? 18 &17 year old illegal aliens rape 14-year-old in school. Mainstream media did not even cover the story.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-school-rape-suspect-dad-arrested-immigration-review/"
"I didn't know this-->>Aside from home-building activity, Home Depot's recent acquisition of The Company Store foreshadows an interesting segment in the works - soft goods. Decor-oriented products comprise nearly 25% of sales, certainly a substantial amount. However, decor products alone only made up about 3% of total sales. With the acquisition of The Company Store, Home Depot is making a move into the softer side of things, attracting a new type of customer. Furthermore, the fragmentation in the home goods market gives HD with consolidation potential, allowing them to steal market share from larger players in the game such as Home Goods (TJX), Wayfair (W), and even Target (TGT). Although The Company Store is solely based online, the possibilities remain endless given the rampant growth across e-commerce. LOOK OUT AMAZON!!!"
Stimulus checks are being spent at HD. All time highs will continue.
ex-div date slide
HD and LOW are to home improvement as Visa and Mastercard are to credit cards..
Next quarters earnings won't cover the dividend.
"I was in at $249, sold half at 314.6. Good profit"
Thank God for you longs that weren't on margin that Trump hasn't recalled the illegals who form about half of Home Depot's installation team.
"Good afternoon, i am new to investing so maybe someone could provide some clarity for my question. Would it make sense to invest say $4,000 in stocks like amazon Apple Facebook Home Depot etc, or stocks more in the $50.00 range? I guess I feel like these stocks are so expensive you really only make money if you own hundreds of them and that would require thousands of dollars..."
why the price is different from rh
Hd is a good example of a wayyy overblown market.
"Home sales declining. Home owners will be less likely to renovate when property values might decline. That will have a negative affect on HD and the debt level is worrysome, especially with higher interesr rates. As a long time shareholder, I would rather see company use cash to paydown debt, instead of increasing dividend and buying stock back. Poor decision. Anyway, I am out. Good luck to you all."
construction BOOMING down south..HD Never shut down..Are you kidding me with earning
HD needs a stock split again to get the price under$50. It's been a while since the last time.
Good reports hurt!! HD and LOW both ravaged. Time to buy!!!
"Bought HD on this pull back. Great price. Amazon just got Kenmore-big deal. There is Samsung, LG, GE, etc which I a prefer better than Kenmore. Besides, I want someone to delivery, install and dispose of the old one. It will take Amazon some time to get these services in place. People shop at HD for so much more than just appliances."
R to the MUTE pile
GRWG same sector
"Watch all the profiteers come out of their spider holes. Mexico struggling with a disastrous earthquake, Puerto Rico almost erased from the globe by a hurricane and HD couch traders will try and figure out how these deadly events can add a few pennies to their accounts.Meanwhile, HD offers FREE carpet installation. FREE. People show up and do hard work for FREE. It's a miracle. FREE carpet installation done often by illegals who Trump wants to throw out of the country. FREE carpet installation. Never mind that these (often illegal,) grunts drive fifty miles and have to deal with irrational, shiftless baby boomers. FREE!!! Everything is FREE!!"
From the Fly: The stock was last down over 2.4% to $150.43. At that price next support is at the session low of $149.77 and then at $148.41. Resistance is at $151.77.
"I have a hard time shopping at the store. The inventories they show on line are never even close to the product they have available in the store. I needed light fixtures (20) pieces, Online inventory says (40). I go to store they have 4 good ones and three damaged ones. They tell me try other store that has 30. I go there and they have 2 damaged ones. How are they making money? out of stock , damaged products. Then i go to auto checkout. OMG! scanning was fine. insert money and no change comes out, employee comes over and the front lower panel of the machine is open and i could of got my own change or more. She finally slammed it shut."
Futures up big!
$146-$147 a good entry point.
When will the stock split
Long holder of HD looking forward to strong quarter report
as of 1125 pm futures up about 75 pts. Looking for opening call for earnings dividends
This is absurd. HD kills earnings. Did I miss something? Expected at least a 5% bounce today.....
Looks like Bill saw ghost of his sinful past. all the women that accused him of raping and molesting them and Hillary was the enabler. Glad they'll never be in the White House again.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4PEqFQXZoFk
"spent 8000 dollars for hd stock in 1985, with drip worth 300000 today drawing almost 8000 dollars in dividends"
"As usual, another 260 torsion spring order out today....GOD BLESS AMERICA!!Can you say that??"
This drop is all about SPECULATION!!! They assume housing will slow down because of the interest rate hikes!! WRONG! They are building everywhere you Go!!

"All those hurricanes and fires, all that misery and destruction and you fools only brought in $250 million extra? You had better start hoping for huge earthquakes, meteor strikes and biblical floods. What a joke."
much rather look at HD thru year long glasses. we have been thru this many times. have been buying since 1988 when I joined the co. you have to love the dividend
"I was thinking of taking a position in HD, but just got an email from HD that says in order to support the CV19 crisis, they're NOT going to be offering any sales that would bring customers into the store.I guess offering sales to customers who might need things the most and coming up with some kind of curb side pick up or heaven forbid delivery,... would be detrimental to those being impacted by the crisis most in need.I can't invest in a management that has such a convoluted vision of business (aka a thinly veiled gouging) and public service."
7 Days till their BIG earnings numbers come out.
We have moved most of our contracting ordering from Lowes to Home Depot today for many reasons... Lowes has gone to the dogs these days...
"This company has banked its entire future on:o Uneducated consumers.o Shameless use of labor shops that use illegals.o Hard handed tactics. (Try to get a flooring warranty issue resolved.)o Chinese products.Now, all the longs are boo-hoo we've been treated unfairly.Yeah, how about your customers.This company owns few of its stores, and barely any of its inventory. So, where is the value?If you bought in the $230 range, consider it an education."
Looks like the same dollar a day downer to about 20 with analyst commentary to cover
futures holding....looking forward to tomorrow
"Yup, on its way to 220, then 225."
"Love clueless dudes on TV , That have no idea they are about to get slaughtered . LOLHow because the DEM wits have started hoarding CASH and will be doing ZERO home improvement this years all to crash the economy just so they can win the election and get back in power."
I look long term daily numbers are fine but it does not define my investment decisions we will be ok
HD is grossly overvalued:target $180
that was ugly
HD in big trouble...lawsuits coming!
When they sell it’ll be premarket trading $4 or $5 drop probably. Idk really know just guessing and has happened a few times
Someone asked about divy. Just announced recently...HD ex-Dividend for $1.36 on 03/13/2019 pay date is 3/28.
going down afaik
Where's the MOMO now? Still short and holding. Looking for $312 - $309.
Are appliances even that big a part of HD sales?
Get her hammered and drill !
$300 by year end and if Trump gets reelected economy will continue to thrive and HD could see $450+ in 2 years.
Like the Home depot long term just can't add at the current pps. margin of safety.
home depot to have a 2 month black friday deals. looks like this stock is headed to 300 straight end of this week
it's a miracle hd up premarket
WHERE IS THE BOTTOM ?
this has to close above $150 to continue higher
hd will be over 200 by end of the year.Buy now...
if you did not get in this week on the massacre of the share price still time... why put money anywhere else you know HD isn't closing up shop plus you get paid to hold for awhile during stupid moves in the market
Oversold!
"my safe harbor these days....$GSK, $HD"
Even if HD crash I’m still 30 ahead so why sell now let the mm scammer pump it
The first dividend payment which I received from HD in 2005 was for $20 at ten cents per share on 200 shares.The dividend payment in December 2019 was for $816 on 600 shares.I hope that Warren Buffett does *NOT* make a tender offer for HD.
Going to be up huge!
Well this sucks
If you want to make money sell HD before it drops like a rock and believe it or NOT buy Macy's . HD has big downside and Macy's has very big upside with buy online curb side pickup . Macy's is going to surprise to the upside and HD has construction slowing even more and will surprise to the down side
SHORTING
HD is eating Lowe's lunch.
Jim Cramer said that when Lowe's reports and they disappoint which is expected home Depot may go down in association. If so this represents a bottom and time to load up on home depot
Up $5 on Friday?

"Watch for the analysts upgrading, HD going back to 235 before Christmas"
Slow and steady back to the top.
Who here believes we make a new all time high this year thumbs up for yes thumbs down for no
LOW new $15 billion buyback program. See sales up 22 percent for the fiscal year. I bought the wrong stock. I own HD. Where is my buyback? I guess all the money went to associate increases.
If this China tariffs continues. Lowe’s and HD will be hit hard. It’s my sole belief.
This will go to 1000000 fed will print more money
Just mentioned by Pete as his recommendation on final trades on CNBC.
What is it with Lowes catching up The Home Depot? What the hell is Lowes doing that Home Depot isn’t doing? Can’t figure it out.￼￼￼
"I’m done, I’m out. Good luck to all you Kong’s. Moving to Verizon and Disney now."
Hd is going to slide wayyy down with this market.
HD stock sucks!
Slashed? Really? Ok its one thing to have huge sales during a viral outbreak but it another when we have RECORD fires throughout california and oregon..and flooding all along the southern coast. There are 232 home depots in california..and i SEE RECORD SALES QUARTER 3
Buyback and dividend should help minimize downturn I think analayst comments will be most important.
HD sales to rise 123% in the hurricane zone stores. Buy all you can NOW. net benefit to all stores combined is estimated to be 3.5% higher than current estimates.
it's bad when good news makes HD go down
HOME DEPOT GONNA NAIL IT BEFORE THE OPEN.
Well is this isn't a clear SELL HD at 300 I don't know what is. No brainer here to sell.
Big Joe is watching. Almost time to start shorting this heavy and placing puts. Patience pays off.
"Buy near peak! Sure, place your bet!!!"
Que tu et bete.
Just found out that my wife is inheriting some 3300 shares of HD along with a few other stocks - WOW! Her Aunt was collecting a check for over $4500 every 3 months.
"There is an old Wall Street saying: Markets do not bottom on Fridays. So, buckle up for Monday."
HD is the only company retail company that can at will raise its prices and people will still buy the stuff your prices go up all the time in business is booming does booming and with all this tax incentives people spending a fortune redoing their house is now so Home Depot is just going to go one way and that's up well over 200 and then split
I’ve never worked at McD’s but I’ve done well with HD stock. I’m not Surprised!
It will bounce back to 273 today lolll no reason for the 6-7pt drop
Anyone else daytrading Home Depot. The trading pattern is the same every day
The R story. he sold his HD for a gain at a much LOWER price and the stock ran away from him. Happens often in great companies when you trade in and out. 250+ coming imo. Tariffs going away.
If you think they dont destroy earnings and this thing doesn't sky to all time highs you shouldn't trade stocks
up we go 200 by January
It’s unusual that it hasn’t took off like it normally does leading up to earnings
Home Depot is down 4.91% to 270.29
"If more people are gonna be working from home during / after this virus thing, I'd think some would do a bit of remodeling.... when they might not have otherwise done so."
oh my this is lovely
close to dumping stock I have a substantial Postion and it just goes down everyday setting stop loss at 264 and out I'm soo done with this
HD is down 8.21% to 195.41
Thinking about selling. Bloated
What’s up wit RH? It’s through the roof!
"One thing I've learned over the year is there doesn't necessarily need to be a reason for a particular stock to fall. There are so many creative option plays that can weigh in and media spread fear. This Amazon threat however needs to be addressed by management! They must express to investors that they are not seeing any loss in business from any threat by online vendors! They don't even have to call Amazon out as they can take the initial Trump response after the disaster in Charlottesville. They can vaguely refer to the threat as ""a major online retailer!"" This is the second time that HD has plunged after Amazon was placed by the media as a threat! Management should not stand by idly and not address this media-inspired bunch of baloney!!! And at the $150 area HD is a screaming buy!!!"
This stock is in desperate need of a incremental buy back. The current price swings are incredible.
Its time Yahoo started putting all the conversations for us to see. Many people have complained but Yahoo does nothing !!
$177.99 ain;'t $178!!! My had is still in one piece and I didn't have to cover!!!! LOL!!!!
"it's doing a dead cat bounce right now, a lot further down to go"
"For those that have been in both HDs and Lowes stores, you know why HD is going to drop like a rock tomorrow after earnings. Lowes is just a better store."
Elon Musk is fined by SEC rfor the same thing these analyst do making comments that influence the stock price but just.in a negative way.
Institutional’s like Blackrock and Vanguard
Maybe we get a SPLIT Tomorrow
Is HD buying AZEK?Great synergy.
...wish I had more money to put to work..great buy at this price heading into earnings next month...
we had a strong come back from the red looking forwards to earnings and new highs
"Hold tight, and don’t sell!"
I can't believe what is happening. Parking lots are always full. People buying all the time.Market is crazy.
"Home starts falling rapidly wirh higher interest rates, Bad news for HD."
Massive gains coming. Tom Lee of Fundstrat just said yesterday that we are in for a “Face Ripping” Rally by the end of this month. S&P moving towards 4200 like an electron magnet. Shorts will literally be incinerated
Folks. My ID here defaults to JOHN with a capital J in a Circle. Don't know where those things came from. but there too many John's sharing it. Does anyone know how I can edit my ID???
"Guess what Home Depot's revenues have done over the past 5 years? They have grown consistently over the last five years, with a CAGR of roughly 6%. Yet the growth does not stop there, as HD is faced with new opportunities, providing further upside."
The SEC picks out one person every once in a while like Elon Musk and Martha Stewart but sit on their hands while these analyst does daily much more manipulation costing small investors millions
"Wow, what a great deal...Picked up some more shares today @ $173, get the tax preferred dividend tomorrow. Some hedge fund must have pulled the trigger on a big blosk of stock to get this ""Flash Crash"" today. They probably had a short position to cover. Oh well, that's how it goes. Yes I know it will retreat tomorrow when it goes XD, but not $4.46...Good long term point to add some more anyways unless the new tax plan and new Fed Chair muck things up."
"Dow Futures over 100 pts. HD $165 this week. IRMA + HARVEY is selling out lumber, plumbing, bath accessories, kitchen appliances, roofing. List goes on and on. Made huge amount of  last week alone with my Oct. $160 calls. Holding over 100 contracts!"

"I love President Trump. He boomed my puts to heaven, now all the rich Trump friends will leave this garbage stock and move to defense stocks. lol at the people thinking trump cares about you and your little cash in HD. He cares about his friends and he already told them to sell their stock in anticipation, so like I said follow insider trades. Just go to nasdaq.com"
"Look at the volume traded today, the street is burning people to save their own ar sches.It's not a free market anymore"
Take the Chinese #$%$ off the shelves and put American made back.
Today I went to HD. Parking lot packed!!! People are working on their homes!
"Down because of the lawsuit regarding 2x4's and 4x4's. Dumbest thing I've heard in a long time. Anyone, anywhere who has purchased lumber before understands that dimensions vary some and are always a bit smaller."
QUIT WINNING AND BUY !!!
Investors are forgetting HD is still be affected by China tariffs and with Trump now suggesting cutting China off totally HD could be caught in the cross hairs big time.
288.25 SHORT
Hi
head fake after hours
good solid company stock to own. will likely hold on for a few more years before cashing in

ITems in Hd/ Lowes/ groceries stores etc. Their would be massive employment her and now. ONly fools ring their own items. Why would any one in their right mind do this. Take jobs away period. YEs fools millions of jobs gone because of stupidity of customers and greed from companies period. Wake up America.
Recap on HD stock prices after earning reports. A brief pump at the opening and collapsed afterward. Now prices got stalled even on daily low volumes traded. Big boys are in a distribution process to unloads to the amateur retail investors.
"When HD dropped to $250 a share just weeks ago, I bought some, but I also diversified and purchased other companies that have left much to be desired. I should have just bought more HD, for more gains!"
"HD IS THEIR ANY NEWS, WHY DID IT DROP"
"This company sells trash and always discontinues there siding and flooring so if you need to replace any you wont be able to,,Sucks"

So what happens when we bomb Iran next week. How far and fast do you think HD drops before it finds a bottom ? For sure not worth the risk at this level. You know it's coming because it has to .
"HD stock is now $30 from the previous high. The Mgmt team wanted to reward employees. However, the compensation increases are hurting margins. Instead of increasing the buyback and or the dividend while increasing pay, the Mgmt team increased labor cost without a need. They killed shareholders. The stock continues to plunge as Wall St. Feels labor costs are out of control. Why are we doing significant increases to hourly employees when there is so much unemployment?"
Congress should investigate this market behavior
bummed broker misheard my call to buy at low.....looking great uptick
I’m afraid to see how far we drop if the market drops. I hope earnings can get us moving up again.
Congrats guys. It looks like a great buying opportunity.
This stock is always bubble not blame the administration
IFYOU HAVE CHANGE BUY HD AFTER HOURS RIGHT NOW BUY BECAUSE U WONT BE ABLE GET IN AT THIS PRICE TOMORROW MORNING
"I love how ""The Street"" will publish conflicting stories about the same stock within 10 min of each other."

Incredible run for HD!
"Looked at the chart of HD again, and now I like what I see!! RSI and MACD moving up with stock breaking out and silver cross occurring today!! Got back in at 279 and change!!"
"If you don’t have the guts to post your position, and we don’t care about your negative opinions. Otherwise just state facts with article links to back your negative views."
"CEO supports a president that is doing more damage to our Democracy every day. Trump is a Lyin', racist, tax cheating, Putin loving, narcissistic, anti American, incompetent, #$%$ that never should have gotten elected! I guess it doesn't matter if you a CEO worth 94.5 million. I feel so much better that I sold all my stock in this company. Hi to Lori!"
Existing home sales are -3.4%. A big miss
The stock only went from $150 to $245 in a few months. Their are waiting lines to get in to home Depot.
"Peaked, down from here"
"Amazon is like the bull in the china shop.Every market they enter, mayhem and havoc ensue. It started with books.Then came electronics,clothing and a couple of weeks ago groceries .Now it's home improvement leaving of wake of disintermediation in it's path.I don't remember any other business having such an impact before."
" American's never forget Obama doubled the national debt in 8 years. The U.S. national debt is over $19 TRILLION.It’s so bad that if every U.S. citizen were to try to help and pay that off, every single one of us would owe $61,129. That even includes children.Sad but true."
When are they going to have a stock split?
Today I gave respect to Ken Langone for standing up to defend our nations Constitution. I was very shocked to hear that Ken did not support Trumps dirty deeds which caused his followers to invade our sacred house the Congress and the Capital which killed 6 people. Where is Bernie Marcus?
this is just a nother rung on the ladder to Aisle 300. we have so much upside left in the Deep! watch out short
why'd it suddenly drop?
"This is too hot, will drop soon."
"Running back up again, would be nice to reach 300 this year and keep climbing"
Fluke quarter and management knows it no guidance for 2 quarters lumber prices going up means Home Depot going down sell the news of great numbers this quarter here people
Slow down in construction and shut down are not good for the company.
China will do whatever they can to keep them buying their products
Another #$%$ day for this one. Should short the s... out of it.
"24 PE is not sustainable for a depot. not tech. sooner or later, but enjoy now"
"With a 52 week Hi of 207 off by 25 and, all of the good news about profits, dividends, and upgrades, this stock is headed for 140.Nothing tanks a stock like an Upgrade"
JPM cut forecast for cuts $HD and $LOW. Earnings will go up and stocks will still go up due to share buybacks.
"If you are a Home Oh Depot long, stand up and be counted. Tell the world that you support The Donald and that you support The Illegals who install Home Oh Depot products. You can have both if you have no conscience."
When is the next 3 for 2 split?
"HD sunk, as it has done for several previous quarters on a pessimistic outlook following earnings, Compare this to LOW, similar earnings but an optimistic outlook. The glass is half full."
Kramer says HD is a BUY premarket today guess he is correct GO HD GO
what a good day / month
Just got in there’s a lot upside from here. What’s with all the haters here ?
Adding here under 180 imo is a buy!
Why is there momentum in this stock if the projected earnings growth is zero?
I'd like homedepot here but I also thank Anthem is a good buy today
I did
Over 240 by New Year. Ride the trend back up
These are institutional coordinated short sells
192 close / 14 million shares still need to be covered
"Years ago, we used to fix Home Depot flooring installations. They are usually horrible and shoddy. We used to feel bad for the customers and come in and fix all the problems, which are numerous and amateurish.Unstretched carpet, bad seams, bubble carpet, weird repairs, badly done staircases, bad trimming, etc.No more. No more. No more.Our strategy has changed. We don't fix Home Depot jobs any more. We refer such problems to the most expensive carpet repair people in the area.Home Depot customers, most of whom think they are getting the deal of the lifetime, need to learn the hard lesson the hard way.You got completely screwed and now you want to pay a local guy ten dollars to fix a completely butchered installation.Well, too bad. Not my problem. Call Mexico and ask for a refund.Home Depot customers are among the stupidest in the solar system. If your carpet is messed up, it's your fault and you own it. I will not fix it."
How critical to HD (storm related sales) is the fact that the storm was downgraded. Does that convert to less sales?
R PUMPS BBBY BUT SOLD IT AND WENT TO CASH BEFORE THE RUN-UP! YOU ARE TOO FUNNY!! I CALLED HIM OUT ON THAT BEFORE AND HE ADMITTED IT. LIKE SAYING I SOLD APPLE AT 100 BEFORE IT WENT TO 250 THEN TAKING CREDIT. MARKET IMO UP ANOTHER 3-5% BEFORE THE END OF YEAR. GOOD LUCK.
I think I should buy hardware companies. Rebuilding efforts will be high later this year. If trump gets re-elected it could be another riot in the fall and rebuilding in spring. Then another 2 or so riots over the next 4 years. Leftist love rioting
Very easy money on the 212.50 puts bought on Wed. CHACHING!
"Joe The Home Oh Depot lover admits that he uses illegals. Hard working illegals. Illegals who work really hard. Hard working illegals who work really hard.Joe, who foots the bill for these illegals? Who pays for these illegals who have no liability insurance, no car insurance, no health insurance, no nothing. Joe, I'm sure you don't give them any benefits. Who pays for all of this? People like me, which gives me the right to call you out as a hypocritical skkkkkkkkkkkkumbag. I'll bet you have an American flag flying in your front yard."
I guess the stock did a 3 for 2 split looking at the current price.
"I get it, amazon enters a market, everyone in that market gets killed on the day of announcement. Keep in mind, amazon is not entering the market. They're just selling sear's appliances. Sears is still dying. Lets not forget, HD is the premier company with tons of experience, a stellar management team and a fortress balance sheet. They are not going to lay down and watch amazon walk on them. Today was a complete overreaction. More market cap was taken off the stock than the value of their appliance business in total. I upped my position by 33%. Sears is not striking a comeback, even if they're selling through amazon. In the end, sears is still dead. This deal means very little to HD's overall business and profitability. Stock will be much higher by earnings report in my opinion."
"Real Americans realize that The Hoe Moe Depot relies on waves and waves of illegals to install their junk. Meanwhile, Hoe Moe Depot longs are bullish bullish bullish this and that and at the same time cry about Americans needing work. If you own stock in this company, DO NOT EVER COMPLAIN THAT ONE AMERICAN IS LOSING WORK DUE TO ILLEGALS. For every American who loses his or her job due to illegals, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. I realize you are too stupid to do so, but think about it."
"Like with all big companies, the bigger they get, the sloppier they get. AMZN is setting itself up for a huge fall. Prime delivery is already getting sloppy and inconsistent."
maybe cut in half next ...
Announce a massive buyback PLEASE!
anyone that's ever worked with lumber knows that these lawsuits are #$%$
Chooo Chooo this is now the express to $200!
"This is Spring Season and sent hubby with a to do list for gardens and mulch. HD was busy and workers said busy all day long. If we get any good news, any good news.....hopeful that Trump will announce some FDA fast tracking of some existing drugs that are showing promise as a anti viral cure which already went through people testing. Then HD will easily jump to $180 tomorrow at a minimum possible back to $200 after Trump announcement set for tomorrow."
Best merchandiser on the planet. HD has been an investor darling since Day One. Generous dividend payouts to shareholders and it feels like fair compensation to Board members given business success. See page 62 https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/2019_Proxy_Updates/Final%202019%20Proxy%20Statement_vF.PDF
"At least analysts are defending the stock.....I've seen what happens when they turn against a stock. Pretty confident of a rebound next two weeksWall Street by and large came out quickly to defend Home Depot’s stock, long a top play for many strategists. Some have reasoned Home Depot will continue to benefit from favorable dynamics in the housing market, ranging from low interest rates spurring remodeling activity to a pick up in building activity in 2020.“The macro nature of their business is in better shape,” Gradient Investments portfolio manager Jeremy Bryan said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Gradient owns Home Depot shares.To Bryan’s point, U.S. housing starts rebounded in October and housing permits rose to a more than 12-year high, the U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday.Others remain bullish on Home Depot’s longer term execution and how it’s doing well in the age of digital shopping.“We expect some weakness in HD today, given the underwhelming results and likely downward estimate revisions. That said, with HD viewed as among the highest-quality names and with some macro tailwinds, we think the downside damage to the stock could be mitigated,” Nomura Instinet analyst Michael Baker wrote in a note to clients.Baker’s bullishness was echoed by Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski.“3Q comp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations. We believe shares down in the pre-market create a buying opportunity, as we interpret lighter 2H results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments vs. a softer macro picture. These results don't change our view of a favorable industry backdrop with ongoing home improvement center share gains across most categories,” Matuszewski said."
"hyperextended move up in history of this Stock. While the Market has pulled back, this is right near it's high."
"Close at all time highs today and see $250 tomorrow, Merry Christmas everyone!"
Its the top better sell.
RIP Home Depot. That's what people get for not supporting their local mom and pop home hardware stores. Shows you how all the money goes to the 1%. Despicable! I want it stopped right away!
Just wait now that the weak impatient hands have left
"Looks like a beat to me tomorrow, will lift markets higher."
It's time to sell this off guys
If Florida get hit hard this could go to $300 even though it will be blood money
"HD and LOW's lumber businesses should skyrocket in profitability as the housing construction boom picks up, and this should far outweigh the increase in costs of goods sold due to skyrocketing lumber costs"
140 is the time to buy this overpriced stock. HD has more problems and few solutions other than mass. Their business model has built in a 20% screw up factor. When managed properly most of that 20% could be turned into profit.
"I'm so sick of these click bait autogenerated articles. A 4% pre market dip is a ""plunge"" and the sky is falling. I've had HD for almost 10 years and I'm not closing out any time soon. There's too much instituional money in HD and their economic moat is enormous."
"It has been very uplifting to see the newbs get owned.This company has made billions by hiring illegals, getting in bed with China and paying workers nothing.And, it has negative shareholder equity.What's to love about this? Maybe the overpriced orange buckets."
"don't forget that there is nothing left on fed reducing interest rate. last couple years, fed reduced the discount rate which pumped up housing prices with lower mortgage rate.now, mortgage rate is not going down any more so housing price is not moving up.this will impact construction as the margin to flip houses, new construction will be squeezed. then, you will see a lower traffic volume in HD, L, Ace Hardware soon."
"A nice little surprise would be a $5 dividend! If it doesn't happen it will be over $5 next year! Just keep buying me some more shares, tick tock!"
Guesses at a bottom?
"The Question you need to ask how come Untied rentals is getting slaughtered , Constructions id now slowing big time"
What were you guys thinking? That it will go to 260 after earnings? Lol baggies
I finally took a position in HD this morning!

Sell now is what we're recommending to Clients...I suggest go to cash immediately
"HD from $152 to $222 in less than 1 month when- 25 million Americans out of job- worst pandemic in our living memory- Economy in worst situation since 2008/09If this is not market manipulation I can't think of a SINGLE REASON why HD moved 50% when the WORLD is going thru the worst and GDP contracted worst since 2008-2009! If you are smart SELL, book your profits. This is coming back to $160 mark soon"
Went to Home Depot over the weekend. There was a line pouring out of the entrance.

"Market needs to find its bottom. Then, we should get some respect reflected in share price.."
dividen day
Did everyone on this board sell at $218 ??
"HD $3.86 actual vs. $3.08 est. is a huge beat!!! Was hearing whispers about increase rev. but lower earnings because of increased cost of lumber and higher wages. Nope, the Home Depot values of taking care of people first win again."
HD GOING BACK TO $270. MARK MY WORD.
NEWS FLASH!! HD STOCK WILL SPLIT!!!

"HD at P/E 23, CWX.to at P/E 11..... with much higher growth rate and being an acquistion target. Both are great companies"
"HD presents a positive outlook as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, HD is projected to report earnings of $2.59 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 13.6%. Coronavirus has massively impacted the offline retail business which is why the sales trends don't correlate with the stock price. But with the vaccine coming into the picture, this will definitely change in the next few months. Track the performance of the stock here: https://zyne.com/stock/HD."

How come home depot dont got a listing on the tsx? Their a Canadian company no?
what a bludgeoning. Think this can go lower or find support at 160's? The market is a mess right now. Sell on good news!
"My dad bought Home Depot around late 80's/early 90's and has held ever since. He has always told me what a great company it is and how he was amazed the very first time he went in one. When i was a kid he proudly showed me the shareholder annual reports which showed a thriving company. And he talks about how many employee millionaires the company has printed. And the story of HD founders. Lowe's, despite its success, has never been a favorite of my dad, he always says their service is the worst even though sometimes they do have what he needs. I remember back when Nardelli ran HD into the ground and my dad was not happy at all, but he held his shares through it all. That time is long gone now. Nowadays, my dad says all the baby boomers renovating their homes and the long term endless need for more homes in this country means HD will continue to thrive for many years to come. We also talk nowadays about how resilient HD is, being mostly immune to the Amazon threat in a changing retail landscape. The company is also doing well at ecommerce and has a strong contractor/commercial business. Interestingly, HD and Lowe's today are pretty much it when it comes to this sector, yet the regulators don't seem to mind it being a bit of a duopoly. As i am now old enough to have real money of my own to invest, and i continue to build out my own long term portfolio of individual stocks, i will soon be a shareholder too. Yes, it has run up a lot in recent years and it goes down in recessions when the market goes down but this is one of the great American success stories. If HD goes down in the near future i will consider it a truly great opportunity, but if not, I will still consider it a good opportunity to buy."
They blamed unfavorable weather as reason for many store misses? LOL Where? Lying #$%$....fact is people don't have money...living paycheck to paycheck and government subsidies
HD has great gains in just the last 5 days I'm happy
"Bernie Marcus just had to share his right wing political views with the world. It's not all about money, Bernie. It's about competence, it's about restoring respect, it's about reading the daily security analysis - it's about doing the job of being President and not just figuring out how to protect the 1%. Trump wakes up every morning and tries to figure out ""what can I do to benefit Trump?"" Anyone voting for this miscreant should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves."
HD beats earnings again lowes misses earnings again.its so simple whos doing better
"Europe was up, let’s not be beaten."
Anyone adding on this over reaction to x-div day?
RDUNCE I AM FEELING SORRY FOR YOU TODAY BOY!! U PICK THE RIGHT DEPRESSED STOCKS AT THE RIGHT PRICES THAN CHICKEN OUT!!!! VERY SAD.
Another day goes by.Another fifty million illegals go out in their rusty vans. Pick up carpet and laminate at The Home Depot labor shop.To install Chinese Made junk.In the houses of Trumpers. People too old and too lazy to do anything. Blue hairs.And everyone screams Merika Merika Merika.Yeah. It's true. And some Bushbot threatens me with fifty tons of nothingness.
Visa is tanking !you are on deck !
Did HD do a 3-2 for stock split. This thing was trading near 210 not long ago. I didn't see my extra shares yet.
Better hold $320
"Why so bearish? Idk, maybe I’m wrong I’m bullish at these levels. I think it’s a steal truthfully. Oh well carry on"
"There is no comparison between Home Depot and Loews. Home Depot dominates with outstanding service and selections. Look at the parking lots when you drive by... Packed at Home Depot. Just had a blow out quarter, and the experts are bashing the future of this stock and our economy. What gives?"
That guy should he actually have rich clients be minding their business assets instead of texting all day like a teenager with a new cell phone
Wth is going on
Just bought HD right here.
Amazing how a 1.5% pull back when the market dips draws out all the MORON TROLLS... Are there that many who are #$%$ they didn't buy in when this all started?
How can housing be down with all the hurricane damage. Manipulation to get stock lower
"I guess if you already own share you want them to blow $1.17B a year on dividends and $8B on share buybacks. At the same time it seems STUPID to me not to pay off the long term debt and short term debt and to make some appropriate investments. I'm impressed to see internet sales up 24% to a total of 6% of sales. Earnings is 3.6% if you multiply $1.69 x 4 and divide by the $187 or so price of the stock to annualize the earnings, not much to brag about, but not bad, but doesn't justify the massive PE. They are trying hard to PUSH the price up, it seems. Pay off the debt, sock away $10B, get ready for the recession, get ready to deal with inflation. The short term thinking isn't very impressive. I think they need a new CEO. It goes back to the 3.6% annualized earnings, not so hot. Something in the numbers seems weird. 3.6% earnings when you annualize it, but same store sales up 7.5%. Please tell me that's not inflation's real number. They did come out with some numbers recently for the month that if you take the month and multiply by 12 is around 6%. Of course, they said the numbers go up and down, but what if it's real?seriously, $$1.69 x 4 / $187 = .036, that is 3.6% return, which is a PE of 27.7revenue is up 6.86%, why is earnings only 3.6%?I think a company has to pay off their debt (like a country should) and let the share price do what it does, let it dive. Don't try to appease the day traders. Just let the stock price do what it does. If it tanks and the debt is being paid off, great, it becomes a much better deal."

Does HD get a lot of merchandise from China?
The 5-day charts show HD and LOW steadily moving up as we get closer to PAYDAY. May 16. $160.00 per share is guaranteed for this summer. Maybe more if good news about Tax Reform. Could be big jump in the markets for all stocks.
"HD , institutional and Hedge funds already know what it’s going to do that’s why they have prob selling big blocks and get back in before earnings"

"HD has been a real miracle for early investors, what’s next?"
Hmmmm....what's next?
This will bounce back next week. Delayed Tariffs and Investor conference. Let’s the shorts get exhausted this week.
6% below all time high with a recent $1.36 dividend payment. Not to shabby at all!!!!
"I'm up 5% in eight days, with a div locked down and on the way! Not too shabby... HD is a keeper!"
"LOW and HD are bulletproof. Lockdown or reopening both these names will thrive. As long as the housing market remains robust these names along with SHW will be able to grow in fertile soil. It is a losing strategy to bet against either one of these names for the long haul. I own both and will buy every big dip. Those who can't see the forest because of the ugliness of some of the trees will remain no richer than they were when they first got involved. If you don't like money, short these 3 names."
"Due to low tax refund, some spring projects put on hold."
Popping back up to 235ish by Thursday
HD was doing well until the housing number hit the wires! Then dropped like a lead balloon! The feds just don't get it!
CEO just killed this company by being offensive to it's customers! Look no further theme what happened to PAPA JOHNS!
Great earnings!!!How high will we go from here specially with today’s big bounce!!!

Getting clocked!
"HOE MOE DEPOT longs, this is just the beginning of a long, slow slide downward. You have been fleecing Americans for too long now and it's payback time. All the illegal installers, all the fake veteran discounts, all the doing and screwing and substandard junk is about to come back to haunt you. No more bottom of the barrel Hampton Bay junk, no more screwing over local installers, no more predatory credit card rates, no more lying about free installations of this and that. You are a huge horde of liars and miscreants."
I added more at the lows in March knowing the strength of this company happy closing in green
"Over sold,, weak hands bailing out,,, New hands will latch on, and gain the new increase in price, and the great div. I am not worried, been up and down with HD over many year. Still a great company."
"R you are a pain in the behind. I wish you would find another site to harass people. I will bet you the longs with HD will come out on top. I have owned every single stock I purchased with HD since 1989. HD is a stock you can retire on. People pay no attention to R. He simply is a guy with nothing to do but harass folks, stay long. !!"
"lets see HD was 233+ now 212,, thats a big drop with big players who paid the 233 number, so they have no clue what they buy like everyone else, The shorts are the ones who know reality ,,"
Go home depot. I have been long since last earnings report. Knew it would bounce back. Upgrade by Wells Fargo to $265. Earnings report Feb 25th.
Any future stock splits?
split?
Certainly was a nice little head fake after 1:00 PM. They covered a few shorts and then pulled the bids in the market. Selling picking up some steam with the Dow down 275 points.
"Just goes to show how fast AI programs and just a little possible collusion amongst top money managers can reallocate fund. There is no fore warning of such things nowadays.

That was cute. Fri triple witching option players live for that...."
Keep buying as the stock plummets. But you must be somewhat long. Be patient and you will be rewarded.
Home depot keeps rising as consumer confidence falls....Wonder who is right ?Did you see Largest Car rental company HERTZ today (HTZ)Did you see this ?Seems to confirm earlier warnings from Dennys Cheesecake Factory Bojangles and so many others as well as huge slowdown in car sales from all 3 US car makers...http://www.gallup.com/poll/210047/economic-confidence-index-2017-low.aspx?g_source=ECONOMY&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles

They just hired one of Home Depot’s previous top guys. There is only so much dough in the space and now Lowe’s is being perceived to get a bigger piece of it. Right now don’t fight the FED. The whole sector is tied to what they’re about to do.
you almost 16 dollars this week alone with projecting blow out earnings glad I am long and continue to reinvest div
They’ll make that employee $1 billion back in the stock trades
dividend date is TOMORROW!
NO FED CUT = SELL
Buying opportunity!!!
added more at 260. long this great company that's on sale. Messes with my low cost basis of $151 but was looking to add shares. I think this is it! If down again tomorrow I will buy more of this core holding for long term.
"Devastating news for overpriced Home Depot AH !“Whirlpool shares down 3% after earnings miss, worse-than-expected outlook“"
recession would be good buy opportunity.
Its ok to shop at home depot. Lowes but NOT JC penny and MOM AN POP SHOPS. Discovery coming to a theater near u ? Please tell us how this Junk science proves anything . Wearing a mask u breathing in C02 u exhale .Ridiculous FRAUD
start shorting @204.45 - every #$%$ stock is a junk now
Just (12) business days till great earnings and 2 for 1 stock split. Target $160.00 near. Great stock with great earnings.
"One major fact to always remember , It is always better to pay taxes than to not have anything left so you don't have to pay taxes. Big gains always go away in a recession. . Over priced is over priced. Wall Street is downgrading construction they did CAT and DE today and HD's turn is coming maybe tomorrow or next week. It is time to get your 401k's out of the market and you don't have to pay taxes on the gains until you start withdrawing the money. If it's a tax gain it is always better to pay taxes than not have any gain late just because you did not want to pay taxes. The fact is people in the last 3 weeks have started hoarding money and if the DEM wits really want TRUMP to lose all the have to do is stop spending. FACT."
Would like to add. The problem is lately hd stock just does not go down.
"Every human on this earth NEEDS Food, Water and Shelter. HD sells candy at the registers, water (LOL) and almost everything and anything shelter related. Shareholder and dividend re-investor since 89'. I'll just keep buying more shares 4 times a year like clockwork. Talk about a passive investment that I can go too anytime to see how its doing! Not at all concerned about the SHORT term with this stock."
HD is going to tank. Lowe's shifted before HD away from. China. watch how this plays out...
"Charles, if you bought 300 shares then this morning you are already down 3k. Can you afford to lose thousands of dollars in such a short period of time. ? When they reported last time it was good earnings but some of the analysts said on SA that this Q might not be so good."
SHORT HD SHORT IT SHORT IT
"The left. The party of Universal Love. Don't ask what their end goal with that means. It will make you sick.For now, lets say universal love is all people loving all other people equally. Yet for some reason, that doesn't apply to President Trump.So you see, as usual, those on the left say one thing, but don't mean it.If you are on the left, and you really mean Universal Love, you would say to the president ""Peace and Joy be with you.""During the debates, he should ask the other candidate ""do you believe in universal love. ""And ask, ""if you believe in universal love, why do you hate me, and millions of conservative US citizens ?""""why do you call us deplorable ?"" ""why can't you accept us, as we have accepted you ?""Force the other candidate to answer that question."
Maybe Lowes will hire Bob Nardelli.
"LOL,LOL,LOL poor suckers LOL,LOL Told you it was coming and HD is going back under $100 LOL,LOL,LOL"
Book Value $3.06 how do I get some lol
Existing home sales fall big !Lowes tanking !

**ALERT**An EARLY WARNING for OVERPRICED home depot from 3M !3M Company (MMM) 197.625-12.375 <<<<<<<<<<3M longs were smug and got smoked today !A HUGE number of items from 3M are sold at Home depot !From Masking Tape to Roofing Materials from Sandpaper to Particle masksFrom Electrical connectors to wall hangers...WIll you be snookered out of your gains ?
what time does HD report earning tomorrow?
If I do have a problem they fix it and sometimes compensate me. Just a great company.
This will go down to 245. It will be a buy then.
Don’t understand the selloff but decided to add more at 176. Didn’t they beat by 25 cents on an adj basis last quarter? The subsequent selling on fear going forward was grossly overdone and undeserved
so we start back stronger than ever
"#$%$, why r we down 3%?"
You people see that bounce off 172? We have bought. 6 ppl. 400 shares in at 172.90
Market Realists are a low grade analysts company and are paid a nice commission to try and I say try to manipulate stocks for buyers.
Split coming soon
just getting pulled with market
"Come to your senses. This thing is over in a month. SPRING is virtually here and, the SUN is warming things up to HOT."

"These money managers thinks this is a cheap way to play $HD:https://www.twst.com/news/spencer-stewart-sam-stewart-award-winning-portfolio-management-experience-tell-ok-sell/""Yes, a la Home Depot in the U.S., a la HomePro (BKK:HMPRO) in Thailand. They are the largest pure-play building materials retailer with 26 outlets serving a population of 260 million. The rest of the market is totally unorganized. The core underlying theme is that many emerging markets have been subsistence income countries, and they are just switching into some level of discretionary spending. And you probably heard from many people about this tipping point, but the point is, they’ve got 26 stores. They are the largest in Indonesia — versus 2,000 Home Depots or 100 HomePros in Thailand."""
"PE 26.47, this is a strong buy right now"
Just loaded up another 270 shares @ $184.75.
"Is today an indication of nexts weeks earnings report, I think so!"
It is a great buy with not much competition. I love to go to HD . Remodeling projects help an has reasonable P/E. Somebody dropped a bomb to buy back at a lower price. I bought some more to existing position.
Watching the news this morning massive rebuilding will be needed across Florida and Ga supplies needed from HD
Once again HD beats expectations for the millionth time in the last decade and it goes down on this news. #eyeroll

If they cannot get it together and stop the nonsense, after this 15 days we MUST just open back up the economy, isolate the most vulnerable, hand out the hydrooxychloroquine and let this run its course. The destruction of the economy will be far worse than the virus."
China will not be told what to do from Trump!
After they cause a selloff their consensus is getting better
300 tomorrow!!!
"Thanks for pushing HD down low enough for for me to turn my small day trading investment strategy into a sizeable profit yet again. I love this stock.Anyone that thought this was going to continue to tank is delusional. Good earnings=good stocks, but sometimes investors can get swayed into dumping shares on a whim."
Resistance at 239. Closing above this will be a very bullish signal. Enjoy the ride or buy more on any pullbacks
still up almost 50 dollars ytd no worries will spike after earnings be long stay strong
"I am the greatest just look a BBBY screaming higher and HD is still under $235.49 LOL Make sure to sell the rips in HD and NEVER EVER buy the dips in HD or you will get stuck holding this way over priced stock LOL, LOL Citi's Analyst needs to be locked up pumping HD all the time know Citi's rich clients would be selling."

"Just unloaded my investment in HD!! I was waiting for a breakout and I got it!! What a whipsaw, CRAZY, ride since the post earnings, insanity, lows!! Good Luck if you still own this puppy!! I'll be buying in again if it retreats off of its SUPER Overbought conditions!!!"
only back to june 2020 levels
This stock is being straight up supported by money from a weird source. That means you will be left holding the bag. This thing is absolutely ridiculous!

"Howard: There are a lot of short term investors . One event doesn't measure a companies value. I've had Home Depot for over 20 years, wish I had more shares. Lowes performance has a long way to trudge. Floor sales personnel are difficult to find."

"Chart looks terrible................death cross and if support breaks here, you are looking $30 lower, IMO."

Home building materials will surge as existing home sales increase. Buy HD and LOW and hold both till earnings. July CALL options are very active and a good investment in a down market. Both held up well today. HD is not a tractor supply comparison. Looking good Ray!

"@invest do you post anything positive anywhere Mr Shorty .. your entire reaction list is negative.. you hate AAPL, HD,GOOG, MSFt. LOW, T, etc..."
Formed a nice tri-point on the weekly chart. Price will climb up from here.
Can we say stock split 2 for 1
"Here's how it works, longs. Home Depot spends trillions a year on image. Meanwhile, they farm out their installation work to labor shops. In the Denver area, HOM solutions does the dirty work. All illegals, all the time. At the same time, the company is embarrassingly pro-Trump and the administration talks about deporting anyone who can make a burrito, and yet the abuse goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I would post the HD horror stories in the Denver area, but it would far exceed YHOO's ability to handle the message."
might dividend be impacted???
Supply chain! Going down at least another 20%
Home Depot reached a 52 Week low at 180.15

"I love it when, ""contractors,"" talk about buying products from The Home Oh Depot. It means you are picking up a few copper elbows or ten feet of Romex or twenty feet of MDF baseboard for that next huge job. OMG, I can't imagine putting my name on that junk in a real world environment. Why don't you have an account with a real supplier. Home Depot is the catch basin for the cheapest, nastiest Chinese junk available on the open market. Are you turned on by the concrete floors and the ""professional associates,"" wearing aprons? Here's a hint. Follow these aprons to the local liquor store and watch what they pour into their food holes every night after work. Then, tell me about all the valuable advice they give you on, ""the floor."""
Where are all the doom and gloom guys who swore this would hit 140 and lower after the Amazon / Kenmore scare then again a week later when the Lowes ER pulled HD back down again?
"After some comments that were said on CNBC about HD being cheap, I looked in to this further and it looks like both $HD and $LOW are both below their true value. hurricane just helps it gain attention to accelerate the price."

Buying opportunity may present itself on IBM's drag on the Dow if this occurs. I think it will be short lived.
Housing numbers thru the Roof..I'm in Home Depo constantly no other place like it..
nice gains today
"I don't know about all of you, but I have to believe people are still doing an awful lot of repair work to their homes, rebuilding and/or replacing due to the summer fires that raged up and down the West Coast. Home Depot will benefit from that for at least another 6 months. And do you think all the insurance companies have settled all the claims and written all the checks? I sure don't think so. Not yet. Fierce market over reaction by the algos--investors need not worry--the fundamentals are fine and not broken. Stay long and strong."
"Are you ready for a great FALL in the stock market. Because the recession has already started , People have just stopped spending. All the signs are very clear now.

Wow I guess it was priced for perfection. Great earnings and raised and still down after being up almost $5 pre-market. I don't get it.
what is likelihood that the dividend will be reduced or maybe increased?
"Home Depot uses illegals. Billions of them. Every day. Without shame. Without remorse. Without any fear of reprisal.Home Depot longs pretend to be oblivious to this indiscretion and berate people like me who help reveal the problem.If you are a Home Depot long, please do not ever equate The Home Depot with a pro-American poise. This company knowingly and wittingly uses illegals and pretends to know nothing about it. This is not pro-America."
"Sale will not last long, HD will continue to print money"
Another downgrade today. They may be taking it under $170. Unbelievable!
rsi is a great indicator for the this. chances are we are bottomed at 180

She'll make a great fit for THE HOME DEPOT!!"
Some comments from Powell on Capital Hill now hitting market
This is going thru the roof when shorts have to start covering!!!
P.S i was hoping H D would split .
Warren Buffett holding period for core holdings ko axp is forever. Peter Lynch said you run with your winners and not buy the weeds! bottom line is the Home Depot is a FOREVER holding.
Cramer said Home Depot and Lowe’s are fine but HD will probably go down on earnings
surprise or demise ??
"LOL 2 more trying to get their rich clients out before the crash < HURRY BUY, BUY, BUY so my rich clients can SELL, SELL, SELL"

It’s almost as if management is trying to force the stock down
"HD price down here is an ""OUTRAGE""..... that is an ""OUTRAGEOUS BUYING OPPORTUNITY""LOL"

A new down cycle has now start never buy only sell the rips or you will get stuck holding way over priced stocks. A massive drop is coming. Make sure you have some cash to take advantage of it . The clueless are always separated from their money.

One of the BEST companies in the world........they can teach you how to have backbone too!!!!!

watch out and the share u bought 150
what's a good price to get in on HD?
"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/is-home-depot-stock-a-buy/I respectfully disagree with PT@Motley when he suggests we may be experiencing home improvement fatigue, that whatever was meant to be done has been done, and that price expectations are already baked in to #HD at current levels. Sales of new and existing single family homes are still on a tear and close to 14 year highs, inventory is at a premium in many areas at all price points. Additionally, time from pending sale(under contract)to close is usually 2-3 months, so I suggest there's still plenty of upside for #HD."
Anyone got a reason for why this is trading like this today?? And Lowes is up?
all items sold in home Depot are marked as made in China. how come it is not effected by tarriffs?
saw 200 in premarket earlier. Congrats to all.
"Jeez, Bill ... this thing has lost 13% of its value in the past two weeks. What the heck is up with that?"
Whats the dividend date?
In your face R. Taking a little profit here.
"LOL at the dude who sold his shares at 180 that he had owned from 20....This is a position you hold for life, even if you trim down your position. HD is always a good play."

Everything in HD comes from China and Mexico. Tariffs will hurt big time
It looks like a double top in the recent chart. can we break above this resistance?

total F39049032G GARBAGE STOCK DOWN HARD FOR NO REASON
It’s a good company so just watch the charts. Formed a death cross on 11/23 which is almost always a signal of weakness to come. Wait until the charts stabilize before buying more. WAB is another one for the long haul and in the same downdraft.
My guess is that HD is due for a pullback in the short-run. if you guys have questions you should ask awe-someSTOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
HD is going to fall for at least 5 to 7 days if you look at previous misses. LOW took HD management and is the new Home Improvement king.
"I did recommend HD at $135 to my friends, it is $155..according to chart this should pull back $150 area short term imho.. long term still looking good..I don't think management wants stock split.I always buy from home depot .I don't see many people this year shopping inside the store.. maybe they are shopping online.. lets see what the earnings will brings."
Great buying opportunity!! Wow thank u mm’s
"When it came to Home Depot's use of illegals, Bill The Excuse Machine used the lamest, oldest, tiredest excuse ever, notably that white Americans are ""too lazy to do manual labor."" Really, Bill The Excuse Machine? Truth is Americans don't want to work for what The Home Depot pays its illegal installers .... you know, the ones that Trump keeps saying he'll get rid of. Trouble is, Trump and Bernie are friends ... those illegals aren't going anywhere anytime soon, Bill The Excuse Machine."
Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein went to prison.. Why isn't Donald Trump in prison also?
"I have owned HD for more than 30 years. The stock has been good to me because I go long on every stock I have purchased. HD does worry me in the last 6 months. I honestly see no reason for the drop in price. Five years from now I want even remember November 2018. If your a real investor, go long !"

"Last 2 days RSI on the 20 day have been 80...OVERBOUGHT and being held up by computer algorithms. When they pull the rug out this will fall fast and hard like last time. Wash,rinse,repeat. 218.74 support, then 216.98, then 215.08. then 213.22"
I didn't see anything in the earnings or in the cc to warrant this move today!
I went to Home Depot an hour agoThere are more employees then customers inside the store I never seen HD this empty like thatI was very surprised
Slightly disappointed in div increase. Expected 20%. Key is weather this will propel to new all-time high (207.60)
I m holding good earning. I will buy more if it drops
cramer cramer cramer
Pick up some at 249 today
"Just judging by the ridiculous number of home improvement posts on FB in my town and the surrounding ones, people are spending a lot of money on home improvement or buying homes that need $100k in work. Mainly HD and Lowe's will be the beneficiaries of this. Plenty of room left to grow this year."

There are more dumbest things to come. the big boys will try to flush the week hand s when it's get below 152
With the low interest rates and consumer confidence still high home depot should do well and be the stock to own next few months!

Don't love today's sugar rush in advance of earnings, but weekly (and more recently daily) new highs with serious volume continues to confirm investors are dedicated to the quality HD represents. One view on a split-increases float, boosts institutional ownership and potentially provides further price stability. Looks like current institutional ownership is below 50%."
This stock is still too high.
Buy low sell high! Might be ugly soon
any bad news at earnings and watch out $135 ! Will buy straddle options on 8/14
I'm doing my part to keep the USA out of recession or depression.I've spent ten thousand dollars in the past six months on renovations to my home.I'm not done yet.
Market is giving back much of its gains from yesterday. Media spreading doom and gloom!
"The stores don’t have any customers, everything in there is made in China, I’m not touching anything in there!!!"
"LET'S KEEP THIS HURRICANE OUT 2 SEA, HURRICANE SEASON DOESN'T END TIL NOVEMBER 30TH."
Can’t believe it’s only at $180. Should have been above $215
"10 year yield is climbing. Builder stocks are hurt. Surprisingly, HD did not decline much."
"My investments are bought with my eyes. I shop at 3 local HD's and also shop the 2 local Lowes. I'm a 30 year plus stockholder in HD. The reason I continue to hold HD over Lowes is everytime I visit both stores in the same day which is often, I rehab houses, HD has more customers period! For you jokesters I have 20/20 vision."
Second hurricane coming. People need supplys
what just happen? huge buy or what. $1.00 in 1 second!
"Home Depot, What a powerhouse that company is."
"Hey VIAGRAPHIL, pucker up a billion longs are about to crawl up your wazoo."
Buy now to get the recovery upside.
"Double Ouch, not looking good again today!!!!"
Why is this down big AH?????
"Comparing to the other companies in this industry, HD looks pretty nice, cause they do not lose positions and try to expand. I think within the home improvement retailer industry, HD is one of the largest and best companies, and as a proof, I've checked an article about it https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/082218/home-depot-remains-better-value-lowes?t=yfdaiana"
204. Came in 1993 Thinking about selling.
Is there a split announcement ?? Why up so much
New all-time above 320! Yow!
"Please it doesn't matter when you BUY HD, over the long run it's just going higher. Building will never stop. things burned down, blow up, flood, etc, etc, These are facts, buy and hold."
Thieves!! That’s all I can say. Steal ur shares cheap and then spike. Watch this soar to $280-290 in a week
"Finally HD will approach $300 going into earnings next week. HD has tested $289 a number of times and failed retreating back to low $260's. If HD can break $289 by EOW with a decent ER to follow we may finally hit $300, and get out of this trading range.And if the analysts give HD a raise in estimates we may finally be rewarded well. Thoughts!"
This is going to be tasty to short soon. RSI over 70 overbought and trading above top Bollinger. Greedy gets you nowhere longs...learn quick because this is going to buckle fast and hard shortly!
This is crazy. My local HD was packed this weekend. Only thing people can do is work on their house.
"I am a woman also and always did things myself windows, siding, and one whenever I went to the store it was always full of cars… That's why I bought it and I'm so glad I did"
"I loath to shop at Home Depot. I would never own the stock of a #$%$ company like this.They eliminated the checkers, then they stop the customers to inspect to make sure you didn't steal anything. I see all kinds of products online but those are not in stock at the store. If I want the damn thing shipped to me, I'll buy it online elsewhere for a better price. I went to your site to see if I can get it at the store. Then there are the installers. They hire the cheapest labor they can get to come into your home and screw stuff up and they do a lousy job on the install. Years ago, had carpet installed. After they left, my bedroom door closes all by itself, it never did that before. It must be related to the big BOOM, I heard during the install. And, my freshly painted baseboards now need another coat. Fast forward to today. My carpet has ridges in it due the carpet not being stretched at installation. I have older carpet in the living room that lays flat on the floor. My house needs, carpet, window treatments, patio doors, new hot water heater, etc. The list goes on and on but I won't do anything until I have to because Home Depot sucks. And in case your wondering, the others suck too. These days, it's all about screw the customer and treat them like criminals, they don't deserve no better. And finally, at checkout, I always have to choose if I want and email receipt and/or printed. The reason is so HD can spam me with offers at mt email address. What genius thought of this? Why not just print my receipt without me having to click to get it? Again, it's all about screw the customer, take em for everything we can get."
maybe u smart people could help me. why is this trading so high when it has a negative book value?
HD will come back and crush these guys...
Media won't tell you: Chinese Spy Developed Extensive Ties with Democrat Intelligence Committee Member Eric Swalwell
No reason for HD to go down. Added more. A buying opportunity!
As a long I ride the price up and down without fear of losing my low cost interest invested
SEL SEL SEL THIS HORSE MANURE COMPANY!!!￼GOING TO $140! Housing market bubble!￼
Talk to me like I’m stupid. Which is easy. As soon as I crossed into the 50’s it happened. Home Depot’s inventory is 95% from China. And with this tariff war happening. Shouldn’t the HD pre market be plummeting?
"I’m pitching this for my program, perfect stock"
"SMG blowout earnings today should drive HD over $300 sooner than later. Once investors and analysts absorb the signs, will drive HD to new highs. Just to remind all:snowstorm sales......springtime bump.......MG earning/revenue beat.......upgrade to $310."
7% increase in dividend announced ain't too shabby.
I am not a shareholder but I’m outside of Home Depot right now to pick up some mulch and it is packed here. Business is booming for sure here
ex dividend day tomorrow
Hey guys - Lumberg here -- Wasss Happening? I'm not sure this whole internet thing is going to work out -- M'Kay? But gotta an idea -- A store like a warehouse -- lots of home building supplies & people with orange aprons and ... wait for it... You Do It YOURSELF -- gonna be BIG

"Home Depot Making Stock Holders money on stock price just fine, I wonder if another dividend hike is coming in the near future?"
My American crew is shut down and cannot afford to shop Home Depot anymore The illegal immigrants are packed in our local home depots like sardines. I know this is not Home Depot fault.
HD Price cut by JP Morgan from $203 from $208 today. Guess that's why were down $4 today!
"home chepo stock stinks, bought for a quick pump due to high options"
its headed to 160
Brick and mortar retailers trading at all time highs must be a sign of a market melt up and top?
"Let's take a look at ""CYDY"" its on the move today big time..!"
come on HD let's keep +4and close at +5 what an outstanding day CAT right behind
HD is a great Co. and Stock but will go up as it approaches earnings the drop back basically follow the same pattern but bottom line ending up higher in each cycle
Check that $3.+ to +$4.34 (2.23%)
"Big correction coming...Gold Prices See Modest Rise Following Significant Drop To December Retail Sales Neils Christensen Neils Christensen Thursday February 14, 2019 08:37Kitco NewsShare this article:(Kitco News) - Gold prices are modestly higher, after the holiday shopping season wasn’t as jolly as economists were expecting as U.S. consumers bought less during Christmas.In a delayed report due to the month-long government shutdown, the U.S. Census Bureau said that retail sales in December declined 1.2%, significantly missing expectations. Economists were expecting to see a 0.1% rise, compared to November’s increase of 0.2%.Core retails sales, excluding autos and gasoline, dropped 1.2%. Even the report’s control group, which strips out autos, gas, building materials, and food services, dropped 1.7%."
Why is HD red AH ?something must be going on here...
*ALERT*Look at my post down below from 6 hours ago when I warned you that Home depot could be a pump and dump and you will see I was right..Everyone who bought today is now under water.Read how housing starts and building permits were MUCH less than expected and the PREVIOUS Months data was DOWNWARDLY ADJUSTED !Home depot sales only up 5% while earnings did rise a lot the other retailers are screaming about the slowdown and it has to reach HD in the coming quarters making upside very low downside very high imo.
Hate to be holding this bag when news hits the wire that there won't be another rate cut by the Fed tomorrow. OUCH

pending home sales up 1.5% fwiw
"guys, actual earning is 2.68. The reason why it dropped to 2.08 is as follow:""It's to support its associates during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took the following actions:Expanded paid time off for all hourly associates with additional hours that can be used at their discretion and will be paid out at year-end if not used;Provided additional paid time off for associates who are 65 and older or deemed to be at higher risk according to CDC guidelines;Provided weekly bonuses for hourly associates in our stores and distribution centers, and doubled overtime pay; andExtended dependent care benefits and waived related co-pays.As a result of the actions taken to support our associates, the Company incurred a total of approximately $850 million of pre-tax expense, or approximately $640 million after tax, equaling $0.60 per diluted share.""==> Actual earning should be 2.68.The provision would be reversed at year end so long term stock. How many companies out there think about their employee as HD?"
"On another note, I’m hearing from a few financial gurus that it is time to sell shares of HD due to an eventual drop in share price to $140 level. OK gang, what are your thoughts?"
took profits on all large cap holdings from last year HD
Powell is burning up the USA economy....
This market sucks.
HD going up today.
If the price is 250 or lower I'm buying more. This is a 300 stock.And the tech is pulling it down.
"kinda glad we didn't get a beat or I would be adding at 255 plus a share. take this as strong opportunity to buy into new year. as fund managers rebalance and boomers take mandatory withdrawals in early dec, bet they add to HD with 5% divi and lower entry positions. also gives opportunity to average up and save some capital gains."
"Time to buy. Prolly another bounce off at 173-174 bottom, with another $5 rise. Make a little cash off the movement."
HD will be back over 220 in May 2019. We are holding long!
Awesome earning $HD 
"Obviously some profit taking. my guess and only a guess, on its way up to $200.oo"
Buy HD today and get ur dividend!
Straight up from $245....time to SHORT it!!!!!!
Parking here in Jupiter fl. HD very hard. Store very very busy. Just put this one away!
Democrats and liberal media are out of their minds..without them we would fly
I bought this at 182. Down a little but with the spring coming up and contruction and home renovations getting under way i only see this thing going up. Im a contractor and let me tell you this type of retail stores are the only ones that aren't going to be effected by amazon. When you're onsite and need a tool or part you don't have time to log on to amazon and wait for the tool or part to get in. You just drive a short distance to your local home depot and buy it right away. Unless......well amazon buys lowe's.........

I truly wish the message board that yahoo produces would become up to date. It sometimes takes weeks to catch up. You can not depend on yahoo for financial news. The political news leans so far left that it makes me truly laugh.
"Crazy how much it has risen in the past two months, when lumbar drops this will follow suit but until then continued upward trend"
Market starting to fall.... Can HD stay green today?
Buyers have spring fever!
as a long-term investor today was a big hit back to last week price not worried HD will come back before earnings
Where's the guy who said 275 when we were at 205 Ouch! Thats gotta hurt a bit.
Its a beat
glad for today's gains way oversold but solid company love the dividend increase hold long stay strong
Everyone seems excited about the underdog Lowes..they expect big surprises but HD will beat earnings estimates and Lowes will not.
"Not rocket science Robert. 200 becomes 100 and more people can buy the stock. More buys mean higher stock price. Had you bought 100 shares of HD the year it went public and reinvested dividends. You would have 32,600 shares of HD at $206 a share today so for a $1,200 investment around 1982 would not be $6,715,600. That's what stock splits do for you"

This blood is on Cramer’s hands!

best of my stocks today
one little green day and rite back to red
HD is up 6.56% to 162.13
We could see $215 at the close
"In the last 3 months HD is trading pretty much the way the stock market trades everyday. The previous year the market would be down 200 points and HD would be up 2 points. I am wondering what is going on. HD continues to beat expectations but, trades ever which way the market trades in general. I have owned HD since the late 80s. I love HD. I own every share since the 80s. I go long with about 8 different stocks. I purchased every share thru a DRIP plan. If anyone could enlighten me as to what they feel is going on with HD, please do. All of you who are going long with HD, I wish you the best for the future. HD has made a lot of people happy over the last 30 years."
Why the heavy drop????
The slight revs miss was so mere it’s hardl visible. 27.22 vs expectations of 27.53 billion and eps was inline. Enuf already!

Terrible stock
Just sold all my HD. Quarterly report shows weaker consumer traffic and lower revenues going forward. Housing starts much lower and this will hurt HDs ultra high expectations on Wall Street. Expect a downward trend....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-growth-slows-customer-153000817.html?.tsrc=applewf
"So here's a little truth about the $1 billion. I'm not sure that amount in incremental or additional cost, in fact, they are reducing costs. They have been paying hourly employees $100 per week ($50 for part time). That ended last Sunday. In its place, they are giving each employee an extra $1 per hour, but here's the kicker, they are not giving raises in 2021, so the people will have to wait until 2022. So actually, most associates are taking a pay cut. They were once getting $400 per month (pre-tax), now they are getting $160. So exactly how is this costing them money, sounds like a savings to me."
Prepare for huge COLLAPSE on Tuesday post earnings !
I urge all patriots to boycott Home Depot. HD has taken a stand against maintaining integrity in our electoral system. I will be closing my credit card account with HD immediately.
Today it's taking down all the stop limit losses expect a bounce mid week keep buying at this price easy 5% at the end of the week
What time is the CC?

"If Trumpf were to ever clamp down on illegals as he promised for an entire year, every flooring installation in Denver would have to be canceled. Fortunately for the illegals, the Home Depot CEO contributed VERY HEAVILY to the Trumpf campaign. Jeez, what a coincidence."

It's a Bubble and the Bubble will burst. 80 dollars is fair value so I believe it'll be a good time to take profits because it's going lower..Much lower. Immediately advising Clients to Sell.

Any idea what dividend inctrease will be?
Beside COST HD has the best management team. If anything they will gain market share from LOWES.
I can’t imagine Lowe’s all of a sudden being the Darling of home improvement .

"Priced for perfection and we are in the 11th year of an expansion with a recession overdue. Fed has little ammunition left to fight one off. The orange man in the WH is coming unhinged and picking fights with everyone and his brother. If democrats come to power and they likely will, the will reverse some of the corporate tax cuts to give a tax cut to the middle class. You made money? Take it and run. Don't have a position, stay on the sideline and wait."
"I’m hoping the brass announces a 3-1 split, it would bring additional interest to this stock. It’s been pretty stagnant for 6 months.."
We will have to back fill back down to $176.25 to justify yesterday's 2.8% move. Hold on to your hats!!!!
52 week low after earnings.
Sadly MOST of the trash on this board voted for the #$%$ TRUMP the phony liar...truly sad.
"How about the HD slogan. "" Did you find everything""? How about the employees ask if you found anyone to help you in finding a thing? The employees are low paid and have no reason to work hard, some do but the majority run and hide when they see a Customer. I waited over 20 minutes to get someone to just get some help. I ended up getting out of the store and going to ACE right across the street."
"HD based here its just the DOW is down today with pressure from the likes of MSFT, JNJ etc. HD is being bought here and has ALWAYS moved into earnings. GUY Adamai on Fast Money called HD a must own heading into earnings on 8/15/17. Jim Cramer keeps talking it down to a P/E of 20 but guess what at a full year earnings of $7.13 which is their guidance this year and a price of $146 we are already at a P/E of 20. Jim Cramer is an idiot but bottom line is Barron's already stating that Kenmore has no effect on HD earnings and will never have an effect. HD is basing here if not it would have been down hard again today."
"It's the irony of it that just goes to show how easily we humans are controlled by greed and fear, 2 great things to overcome in life.....peace and happy weekend to ya all :)"
Home Depot is no longer selling masks and closing earlier that sounds like a real winner to me!!!SEL SEL SEL THIS PIS POOR MANAGED TRASH!!!￼
Lumber @ 1100 per MBF....JP says inflation is “tame” lmao! Come back to earth Jerome...
"HD and WMT crush estimates and both in the red. Moshe, Abe and Saul must want cheaper shares. Give it a few days when they are done buying. HD will be over $300 by fall."
3 for 2 split is very probable after earnings report
If HD stays down here on just a stupid Amazon - Kenmore relationship which has no effect on HD revenues? Then its time to sell everything and get out of the market. This is irrational trading at this point.
"A little confused as to why HD has drfopped so much, but I am pretty sure it is not because they announced a pay hike for their associates, especially those who make min. wage. I'm sure it will come back strong like it has in the past."
"CASH before the CRASH LOL,LOL LOL Dump the HOME DEPOT going to drop more than $100 LOL,LOL LOL, super slow down. Sell the rips and for sure NEVER EVER buy the dips or you will be the fool holding all the way to the bottom"
all I can say is WOW Outstanding
"We are 1.3% below ATH with the spring market just sprouting! And we have a dividend payment coming very soon. The 3 basics of life - food, SHELTER, water!"
Stupid Drop .... Adding to my position. Should be over $200 by the middle of next week.
I hope Craig Menear is home weeping about Trump
This is a great earnings report for their slowest quarter. Record numbers for 2018. They took a .16/cent charge for a 2015 acquisition. Without this charge they handily beat numbers. $15 billion buyback announced. Dividend raised dramatically to $5.44 a year. As a long term stock holder I am VERY VERY happy! I will continue to reinvest the dividend. If you don't understand investing you shouldn't be in the market!
"Everyone, rush out to buy your new Kenmore from Amazon, haul it in from your front porch (good luck) and haul out your old one, and put it on the curb for the garbage pickup and then install. Give me a break!!! who will do that BOYCOTT AMAZON"
HOME DEPOT FOUNDATION INCREASES THEIR COMMITMENT TO $2 MILLION AND THE STOCK GOES DOWN..WHAT GRATITUDE!!!!

"WOW already down over $7 and going to drop even more you better Buy, Buy, Buy , Pump, Pump ,Pump so you can get more suckers to over pay for this stock LOL Are you ready to drop like a rock as Home Depot has to warn about earnings LOL"
"Positive and sustainable trade today with consistent volume approaching record highs. As other brick and mortar retail languishes in a sea of C19 spirals, the weekend provided additional HD buy recommendations from both tech and fundamental POV. Net insider purchases vs sales numbers at 2:1 ratio. Institutions hold 70%+. At a price earnings ratio of 24, still in line with overall S&P . at 22."
Actually housing starts should drive HD up more. HD plays a bigger roll in home imporvement and rebuilding not new home building
HD debt load is too much.....be careful
Housing market in good shape HD will follow up
hope so

You can also bet that this price drop on HD has nothing to do with the business and everything to do with GREED

"Investors Business Daily says not to buy this until it hits $293. I always thought buy low, sell high"
Still optimistic for $300 by years end.
Purchased 140 October $160 calls. Huge option buying at $165 calls
"Considering the climate, HD is doing very well. The extra costs (that’s eating into profits) to help employees are temporary and will payoff in the future."
"T is holding up better than I thought, on this down day.Some of my other holdings are moving against the down market.I am surprised. $DLR, $HD, $GPC"
We got far less tax refund. All projects on hold if at all this year..
hd$210 then 3for1 split
hd about 90 bucks too much
Bought at 252. Nice gains! but whats next in terms of price point now that we have reached 300? I feel no pressure to take profits now but just curious how much further this thing can go.
"The main road near our home has 2 Home Depots in a 5 mile stretch. I was at one of them twice in the last week. People are rolling out carts with doors,drywall. lawn fertilizer and everything else you can think of. We live right outside of Chicago and people are working on their homes like crazy. Very busy around here. The wife wants a flower bed made out in front and in the back,bordered with new flowering bushes and mulch. Also want 2 bathrooms painted. Everyone down our street is working on the property. It's boring sitting around doing nothing. If I have to put it on the credit card I will. HAPPY WIFE,HAPPY LIFE."
"HD EARNINGS very good, why investors sell HD? building houses and gardens too broken, American people need a lot of money to repair them, SO American economic have huge room to growth, American need vacation house, SO American economic growth is construction growth now"
purchased this 2 years ago. it's done well!
"Connect the dots. Washington Times: Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus is a Trump supporter ...Ken Langone: Trump could turn out to be one of America's best presidents.What's being done about the tens of thousands of illegals working at Home Depot? Nothing. Ask Ken and Bernie ... oops, they're too busy buying off the president."
"Extremely positive existing home sales data today continues to add fundamental support. Coming weekend biz reviews will bring new longs to the table... a week of ""quiet"" summer trade brought great earnings and an increased dividend. Some argue #HD is spending too much in expanding infrastructure for supply chain. I believe it shows great foresight....pre-deployment of resources when we can't see around the corner will always have it's detractors. I'm all for it, and believe this measured layering in of support underscores why #HD is a quality addition to any long term portfolio."
$200.00 a share here we come !
Why the heck is this down?
R touts a stock BBBY that lost 84% of its value in 5 yrs. Second half HD expects improvement in earnings.
Sold @$235 today. Buy back around $200. GLto all.
"I'm gonna try a keyword, folks. If this actually goes thru, my apologies. Atlassian."
why LOW been doing better than HD stock past couple days?
HD makes earnings but bad consensus. Lowe’s misses earnings but a good consensus hmmm
HD going back to 310 support....
sad as it may be bad publicity by someone who used an HD truck should not affect the price. this person could have gotten a vehicle from anywhere. not HD fault for renting to someone. what are they supposed to perform background checks on a rental?? they can't discriminate either...so stupid and sad.
George Soros is a nut case

How high? Sales blowout strong earnings..251?
Don't sell at this moment. Low is up over 1.25% HD should be too. MM controlling Hd.
GOOD EARNINGS but will finish down on the day
HD is one of the best companies in the World. I don't want to here about over valued because as Buffett learned from Philip Fisher you have to pay up for a great co! HD trading around 21 times earnings for a long time and just look at those returns. Not to mention the significant increase in dividends.
"Numbers were solid, it is just the current overall market sentiment."
"Just like ROKU, the report is good and rise in pre-market, then go south within minutes. This market is crazy, it does not matter how the report, the big guys take control. Let's wait and see how HD will be by end of day. GLTA"
has not split in over 20 years and won't split now!!
"Did you get snookered in at $184? Jim Crammer is yapping about The Depot. That is the kiss of death. It it weren't for hurricanes and fires, this is a $150 stock, tops. People, it's a plywood store that lies about free carpet installation and uses illegals by the train full."
This ab the time everyday when it pulls back a bit
"Honestly, I could care less if you people buy flooring from Home Depot. All I said is that it's often overpriced, (which it is,) and it will likely be installed by illegals, (which it will.) Also, that ""Free Installation,"" nonsense. OMG, that is the biggest lie to ever come down the pike. To whoever came up with that masterpiece, does your mother know you lie like that?So, if you want to buy flooring at Home Depot, go ahead. You are not the kind of customer I want anyhow, because you are obviously an uninformed bottom feeder.But, PLEASE STOP USING ILLEGALS. YOU ARE KILLING REPUTABLE SMALL BUSINESSES."
very good report and it will reach ATH in 2 weeks.
"Hey SF,How is that shorting going for you??"
Today Wells Fargo raises target to 260 from 250 and Baird went from 230 to 237.34 yesterday and were down? Absolutely no logic!
Trump cut seniors out of our tax break on the IRS Form 1040..less money for home improvements.
every company you just posted I can go on amazon amd find thier products for cheaper.good luck ordering a washer. 2x4 or insulation. building materials. go so.somewhere else mark none of the companies you posted have products near home depot
"Good luck shorties ! Stock is a holding ground, for now... Sprlng is in the air."
"Home depot share price going up, yield percentage going down. See another dividend increase soon! Go Depot!!!"
"morgan Stanley raises price target to 320, im buying more now"
"there should be a surge in flood related damage materials.Drywall, lumber, paint. auto should benefit. Time to get in now. you cannot deny the damage done. in addition, the hurricane season is just getting started."
anyone here shop at home depot.
"The biggest boom to HD is its ""pro desk"" not appliance sales. This AMZN noise is getting old. Contractors want wood, shovels, sheetrock now not via mail order! Give me a break! HD earnings will soar! If you sell into this mania you're doing yourself a huge disservice!"
FED Liquidity is Stronger > than a small HD Miss.Earnings really have not mattered for earnings season anyhow. The Rally has been all about FED Liquidity.
HD: overbought distributionshould see 203 -205 by friday
I've been spending a lot at home depot and Lowe's both. I don't know if I'll get my job back but getting some personal work done at home from landscaping to kitchen cabinets buying materials and tools...They are doing well in the pandemic ....
Short squeeze coming
BLOWOUT EARNINGS NEXT WEEK!
All the Home Depot employees sell at the same time
Are the estimates already baked into the stock price?
"you guys can't be serious if you're paying 20x ""earnings"" for this right now"
Yahoo finance does not keep up there sights. Sometimes they are a week behind. Yahoo what is the problem !!!
Not selling till $350What a run
Covered my HD short sell at $238.00 for a nice little paycheck From $240.40 to $238.00 in less than 24 hours. Not a huge win but I win 75% of my short sell plays. It all adds up. So easy. Why invest in a stock? Why trade long? Selling short just before earnings on bloated overvalued high expectation stocks will let you triple your money every 6 months. I'm bragging but it is true and if some of you are smart you can try the strategy for yourself. Don't follow the herd. The herd never knows best.
"HD looking to buy Office Depot is a no brainer. At $5-6/share synergistic, accretive, lower PE and increases cash flow"
HD knocked it out of the park. Great same store sales numbers!
Quiet
HD is down because of options expiration...
Hopefully a stock split coming soon
"Apple is on fire! The rest of the market just doesn't seem to ""get it!"""
Who else has curtailed building plans due to the price of lumber? This may impact HD and Lowe’s quarterly earnings this quarter.
Got into this on that sell-off in March. Has done remarkably well. Will keep this as a long term position.
Not many people understand how a strong social system makes a country a better place foe all living there.
finally a green day
Why cant Home Depot offer an employee discount of even 5 percent?Might improve morale more than the Halloween party after hours.
Housing starts should rally HD
The Street trying influence ppl to get them to sell like always
Simply you’ll get a different perspective right after you acted in the previous perspective
12/26-am; 27-DEC $217.5 Calls Still Winning--Futures Up. lol
What's going on with HD? What's the new?
So stupid selloff today!!!
Ig tomorrow it’ll be down another $1 or $2
Please 320 today

Who’s going to HD after being vaccinated?
insane drop
Pham that would be me lol good luck
Can we say split for Home Depot. Lets Hope.
Next stop 250. Any positive @earningd? 275 by June not unreasonable in this market. Investors R buying TOP QUALITY stocks the most. Housing booming=HD 300+ by TRUMP 2020! imo
HD continues to underperform when market advances and sells off much greater than market average when it declines. Not a good indicator for short term price appreciation. I am long at much lower price and have been selling calls as only way to make income from this situation
I'll take another 2.00 plus today
"OMG, this is priceless.People paid almost $240 a share for this. Hilarious. The company has NEGATIVE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. What is so confusing about that concept? It means you own less than nothing!!!!"
"HD is going up. It is the best in its kind, and with housing/renovation increasing, it is a sure win."
HD Getting Hammered today
UNP miss same day HD hands out bonus
China tariffs just raised HD prices 25%.
home depot waste so much money on their flight department its a joke 3 45+million dollar jets just acquired a new one in sept for 45 million + that's not counting the operating cost per year which is staggering. they just sold one for 10 million and was sold by broker for 11.5 million less than 2 months latter... then also ask the ceo why they need such a large jet to fly 1 or 2 people ...walmart a corp much bigger operates a fleet of smaller more economical jets go figure..... they don't believe in teleconferencing one jet in is in sarasota then miami today...just a waste.. if they had to fly first class they wouldn't find the reason to leave the office. Take the lead from GE and get rid of the jets!!!!
"Shaggy and Susan please see Dr Phil, maybe he can fix your brain’s...."
home depot is a lowes killer
"No don't sell BUY,BUY,BUY and prove me wrong LOL , LOL , LOL way over price and constructions is slowing LOL LOL. Citi upgraded only to get their rich clients out . They get paid big bucks to know what's really going on and they should lock CITI's analyst up in jail for pulling a CON job on poor suckers that got CONNED into buying because of him. Wall Street CROOKS , If you got sucked you should sue Citi and Citi's analyst for pulling a CON job on you."
It's time to clear up the confusion about stock splits. When a stock splits although the share price is the same in theory you do gain more shares. This is very important and this is how the vast majority of share holders accumulate more shares over time. HD shares after a split would likely rebound just as they have done before In the past. Now this may take some time. After all wouldn't you rather 2 or 3 times the shares you had before a split. And again the price will follow. Plus Institution investors look at share price and look favorabley when a company splits it's stock.
futures green let's have a positive day when we open
"LOL. You can't find a parking spot at a HD for over a year. Fraud Street is too funny. They will blow out all sales and earnings expectations....again, and it will only get better with all the helicopter money on the way."
looking forward to blasting past estimated earnings the acquisition of HDS should be a boost
"Too much on line sales focus by the CEO... no one buys toilet seats, 2x4’s, screws, plants, water heaters, etc etc on line. Put more HELPFUL and knowledge employees in the aisles... also, put more cashiers and express lanes in the stores. Back to basics Craig!"
Should be a split soon
"HD, LOW and Harbor Freight....The 3 Kings. What the heck is an amzn??"
Total over reaction. Great conference call. Will be up in the next few days and continue its uptrend.

Long term stock holder that will continue to hold another 10-15 years. My dividends will gobble up more shares.
Looks like Home Depot has moved into Canada in a big way with over 180 outlets! Wow! Anyone know how many stores they have in the US?
This is simply following the old strategy of selling on the good news! Long term investors will be rewarded.
2.65$ EPS VS 2.62 EPS exp
HD definitely over LOW. Bad guidance and comp sales from LOW this morning! ouch! Will buy HD if it dips much by association!
"“New-home sales fall more than forecast “Purchases of new homes fell more than estimated in September to the weakest pace since December 2016, adding to signs that a lack of affordability is crimping demand"
"sure why not... if Tesla is worth $300B+, why not HDSeems like just the other day (1 year ago) it was a $200 stock, now headed for $300, again... why not"
This is most likely not going to go below 220 again until there’s a market crash.
I started in 1990 and have bought monthly ...i recently retired and I can say nothing bad about home depot..it was one of the first stocks I bought because the parking lot was always full..after 30 years investing it has been a big blessing in retirement from nursing...still adding!
With Home Depot reporting sales of $23.9 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 a 7.5 percent increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016! Now with the blowout JOBS number today seals the deal on what to expect for 1st quarter's earnings. CHEERS! +'+'+''
"I like how the big box stores post information about their products, like sizes, and weight, and even assembly instructions.Sadly, for a long time now, the site on Home Depot will freeze when you do a search, and then tell you its locked due to a Long Running Script. This used to be common years ago, but Home Depot is the ONLY site where that still occurs. FIX IT."
You are FIRED
Spring/summer shopping hasn’t even begun yet. Hopefully delayed construction costs due to lumber prices don’t cut into profits.
tsla + hd = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I feel hd will benefit from the infrastructure spending currently in the works. Good things to come

Maybe us longs will get lucky and you’ll not return

I'm glad I signed up for payroll deductions to buy HD shares. HD has helped many in charities as well as investors !!!!
Pisanni on CNBC just said the 15Bil buyback is huge and about 7% of the outstanding shares

"Welfare Mart just dumped 40,000 skilled employees. Pharmacy techs.Retail is great, right? Home Depot is simply a brand. It owns little to nothing. It hires illegals (albeit indirectly,) to install Chinese made junk via shady labor shops.The Home Depot doesn't really have anyone to fire in order to improve revenue. Except the underpaid slaves with the orange aprons.Booooyah? All American company? More lying, more deception. That is the real power of The Home Depot."
"This ones going down below 45 in the next 6 months, I assure you."

"I went to HD to grab some boards. They made me go all the way to the other side of the store to get in. Then to get out, I had to go all the way back through the store to make sure I was exposed to as many people as possible out of an unprecedented abundance of stupidity. Then the keypad had a clear piece of plastic over it for my protection. The plastic was nasty and curled edges and filthy. For my protection. Thanks."
Anyone have an idea why HD is doing worse than LOW? I sure don't.
What the heck is a going on uh!
"Guys - Splits are mostly ancient history! No One wants one - you gain nothing and it increases the company admin costs. Institutions own most of the stock and they don't care. With zero or close commissions, there is no demand for a split."
markets just want to sell off regardless of earnings
Can't say you weren't warned
What’s up with this board? Nobody has been on it.
HD plummeting now. Another month of corona and and it'll be back at 2008 prices...absolutely hilarious
"All you flag waving longs, this company has been brazenly using illegals for twenty years or so to install flooring and other products, so put the FING flag away until you come clean and start hiring Americans."
Fed says housing is slowing and still intends to raise interest rates. Glad this stock pays a dividend to off set an impending down turn in the nations economy.
Where are those geniuses who gave me thumbs down when I posted that I opened a position at $182 after earnings?
HD reached a new All Time High at 209.69
"Some idiots here on MB just don’t get it! HD management has built a strong online presence for HD way before COVID... with its superb customer service, variety and low prices, it beats Lowe’s hands down! Spending on labor goes in to customer service and cust service is everything 4 successful retail. See what Amazon build with d same and Walmart following the suite! I would buy HD at these prices with closed eyes. Amazon is strong buy too at current prices!"
People dont like change but people want homes the increased rate was coming..people adjust no worries
Many people think they are insulated from china trade wars in Home Depot but I would estimate well over 65% of everything sold in Home Depot is from China.From screws and bolts to laminate flooring from electrical connections and appliances to particle masks to cabinets to ceiling materials to plumbing supplies..To hand tools everything from China but more important I’d necessities go up in price then non essential toy sales drop.. be careful he investors 35 to near 200 is a fabulous gain that may be in for a serious correction....
just like last earnings report everything was good. Does not move it was up $3 premarket now it's negative
Should see a stock split soon
home depot sells hgher than lowes a lot of items
Daily  bear market sell off begins....
What do you guys think? Will HD run up as holiday season comes around?

That speaks volumes about the quality of People that live around here.my Wife and i were extremely fortunate to buy our house in 76 for 24,950 bucks. Another one, a large split level on a large lot, came along a month before 9/11 for 210k. GOD BLESS AMERICA and the WORLD. Please Pray for the Trumpster and his staff. The evil ones want to chew him up and spit him out...."
HD will be fine.250 by middle of july.guarenteed.

So the bonus and the offshore tax hit will affect earnings by 19 cents per share. Hear that all you knee jerk scared of your shadow investors? if that concerns you please sell today....don't wait until earnings and panic and pull the plug and do stupid #$%$ like you did with amazon and Kenmore and all the other non pertinent news that came out in 2017 and needlessly hammered the stock.
dividend coming too
I should have got the clue. When HD repeated a promotion in doors department back to back in quick sessions.
"Just sold out, it’s gonna flatten out for a while and there are better buying opportunities out there"
Relentless selling since the Mgmt team hike wages for associates and was not able to increase the buy back due to purchase of HD Supply. How many times have we bought and sold HD Supply?
"I think the market is overreacting. It is problematic to see such an emotional market in a decent earnings environment. I'm not selling anything. But, it's right to be leary of buying in just yet."
A stock that is bloated to the moon.Due for a major drop
4 percent of HD's customers make up 40% of their revenue. Check the contractor association websites and they don't paint a rosy picture for contractors during this pandemic. Earnings may show a real struggle from the contractor side of revenues for 1st quarter and 2nd quarter outlook. Just something to think about.
Pending home sales for January up 4.6% vs 0.8% estimate. You'd think we'd see a little spike here! I just don't get it!
Open letter to Hoe Moe Depot longs. Please stop using illegals to install products. Do not pretend to be some kind of ultra-American if you are a Hoe Moe Depot long. You have used illegals for decades and it's time to stop. Stop it.Stop being hypocrites. Stop pretending that Hoe Moe Depot is pro-American as this company uses illegals day in and day out to install products. Get off the pedestal. Stop the madness. You are all pro-Trump except when it comes to Hoe Moe Depot using illegals to install products. Grow a pair and stand up for your country.
HD up $4.23 - Lowes down $0.26 - The tides are a changing!
I think HD will pass COIN today.
"I don't know this guy, but this is easy reading: https://www.runningwiththemoney.com/post/is-home-depot-a-buy"
Cramer said its going to go up as its only due to lumber deflation based on call
u folks have fun.
Hey will you Biden fools go do some more loots or riots so HD stock can go up more. These loot fools are about STUPID..
new Chicagoland terminal opening Bedford Park for Lumber receiving rail service
"HD’s down $6 this morning despite good earnings and a dividend hike. THE problem is the lack of an incremental buy back. The market above all wanted and expected an incremental buy back and Mgmt did not deliver. They hiked wages, modest dividend increase but NO INCREMENTAL buy back of shares."
The fact is the stock needs to hold in here. The next stop is around $165 but it could also rally from here. Look at CAT it dropped like a rock after a blowout quarter till it hit support at $150
oversold buy back
No successful business is going to limit themselves to suppliers from one Vendor or Vendors from a single Region
BEARISH Head and Shoulders pattern confirmed this morning as HD breaks right shoulder to the downside!! Price target: 290-295!!!
When was the last time Home Depot had a stock split?
Time to short it
Since I acquired HD in the early 90s I've seen so many negative comments about it that if I has a penny for each one I'd be close to Mr. Buffett's wealth. When Yahoo! cane out in the middle 90s they have attracted a lot of gootballs.
Did you remember to SELL any move higher Will Robinson. What a GREST double top HD now has. Are you ready for the GREAT drop did you remember to SELL any move higher TICK TOCK only time now before the GREAT DROP. Game over Wall Street is SELL CYCLE mode. SELL any move higher
why isn't this stock going up??
HD recent price movements have gone beyond understanding! I've been holding long for over 6+ years. Never seen such trends..
I smell a dead cat...
Home Depot is up 5.09% to 200.29

THE SKY IS FALLING!! RUN!!!!!!!!!
"HD at the Mohegan Lake, NY location changed the cashier's lines that now have the employee on the same side as the customer. So the customer now has to walk around the cashier. I told the cashier that this is not going to work and she stated the reasoning was that they wanted the cashier to be closer to the customer. Not only was she close but she was in my personal space. Talk about inconvenient. I am a 20 year plus stockholder and have to say this is not how to create customer value. I will be speaking to the managers"
