can someone help me understand the aapl  amd connection made in the paragraph below i’m bullish on both mu mentioned as well thanks for the help apple has big plansnews leaked today that apple aapl has told some of its suppliers to expect the production of more iphones and other apple devices—something like 20 to 30 more the good news is that aapl shareholders might see their stock get back into its upward trending ways of the past two years the chart below takes the approach that an astute analyst would and goes looking for sympathy plays—stocks that are related to aapl and are likely to see success alongside the tech giant two that come to mind are micron mu and advanced micro devices amd the charts speak for themselves but it seems clear that these two companies should likely grow in 2021 if apple does

its being reported today that the iphone 12 became the world’s bestselling 5g smartphone model in october despite a delayed launch which resulted in only two weeks of sales during the month the iphone 12 pro which was also launched alongside the iphone 12 was the second bestselling 5g model for the month according to varun mishra research analyst at counterpoint research monthly market pulse service the iphone 12 and 12 pro together captured close to onefourth of the total 5g smartphone sales in october click on image to enlarge2 x counterpoint chart iphone 12 1 5g phone in the world the iphone 12 also entered the top 10 bestseller list of 5g devices for januaryoctober 2020 attaining the seventh position this is a big achievement considering the new iphone series was available for only two weeks in october samsung’s galaxy note 20 ultra 5g which was the bestselling 5g device in september slipped to the third position several factors drove this huge uptick for the iphone 12 series there is a large pentup demand for 5g upgrade especially within the ios base which is now getting converted into sales this was complemented by strong carrier promos especially in the us which accounted for over onethird of the iphone 12 and 12 pro sales for the month all carriers were offering the iphone 12 for 0 through a mix of the tradein and unlimited plans china and japan also saw strong initial demand for the iphone 12 series compared to most of the other 5g models which have a regional presence the iphone 12 has a wider market coverage – it is available in over 140 countries thus helping sales the iphone 12 series has also given a push to mmwave the iphone 12 and 12 pro for the us are capable of mmwave support as a result the penetration of mmwave capable smartphones increased to 12 in october compared to 5 in september the popularity of the iphone 12 also means that there will be a large installed base of mmwave capable devices in the us this is important because it gives operators an incentive to deploy mmwave infrastructure rapidly the high throughput and low latency provided by mmwave will help unlock the true potential of 5g with the mmwave network and devices in place it would lay a solid foundation for apple to leverage the power of mmwave in segments like arvr going forward the demand for the iphone 12 series is likely to remain strong through q4 2020 especially during the traditional christmas season in december strong sales for apple will also drive the volumes in the premium segment raising the global asp due to the late launch some of the sales will be pushed to subsequent months thus maintaining the momentum of the iphone 12 series in early 2021 as well through the iphone 12 series apple has also given a muchneeded push to the 5g smartphone market which cornered its highest ever share of 24 in the global smartphone sales in october

hey anyone shorting aapl today
from gene munster todaysimilar to the iphone upgrade program we believe over time apple’s delightful hardware tradein experience for mac ipad and watch will evolve into hardware subscription offerings for these devices eventually we envision the company merging its services offerings alongside hardware subscriptions to create a 360° bundle think of this as paying a monthly fee to apple for most of your tech needs…apple is the only company that can make this work given their service and maintenance logistics along with seamless hardware and software integrationtoday about 55 of the company’s revenue can be purchased as a subscription by adding mac ipad and watch subscriptions that number will approach 85 this dynamic will increase apple’s revenue and earnings visibility which should in turn expand their earnings multiple our 200 price objective is based on 35x our 2022 eps estimate of 570…we believe mac and ipad growth rates will stabilize around 10 over the next few years representing a step up from flattish growth prepandemic
after spending an entire week going back and reviewing about 25 years of apples financial statements from the 1990s through 2020 all i can say is wow never ever bet against it underestimate apple apple is the home of ipod iphone ipad mac airpodsand the soon to be announced apple glasses and car all those under one roof and so many other products that have become significant in american culture without a doubt own it dont trade it

apple app store revenue grew 31 in december a third straight month with 30 growth this brings the growth rate to 31 for the decqtr a notable improvement from the 25 growth in the septqtr worth noting street models call for services growth of 19 in decqtr vs 16 reported in septqtr we estimate total app store developer revenue grew to 48bn in december up 31 yy vs 32 in november 30 in october revenue grew 28 in 2020 an acceleration from the 21 growth rate in 2019…netnet continued growth in the 30 range could support upside to our 18 services growth estimate in the decqtr especially as apple care headwinds should moderate given the iphone launch

i love the fact that apple and message boards talk very little about apple and what impact it will have on the healthcare industry in the coming years as tim cook said in a interview i really believe that if you zoom out to the future and you look back to ask what has apples greatest contribution been it will be in the wellnessandhealth areathe growth of apple will continue for decades

there is a good chance in my opinion that apple will boost dividends more than normaltheir announcement to be net cash neutral over timeplays into adding to payoutsthe board keeps approving more buybacks and apple buys around 80 billion in shares each yearthey still end up with a lot of cashif they double payouts to about what microsoft pays it would definitely help them achieve that goalwith more bottom line growth due to in house m1 chipsand new cell chipthey will need to boost dividend or buy more shareseither is good but raising dividend will boost share price even morego apple

forward pe 29 that’s not bad considering it’s performance and the dividend payout ratio of 24 is easily sustainable i’ll have to look a little harder at it but is my gut feeling that you could hold apple in place of bonds in your portfolio and likely outperform  with greater safety than holding a diversified bond portfolio i think that’s what buffett has done
it is very obvious to me that the majority of this message board want to be in tesla stock instead of apple why not tesla goes up every day elon musk manipulates the stock every day by tweeting and engaging his shareholders while tim cook does nothing tesla is a very small small cap that moves very fast the next 100 increase will be tesla not apple stop being jealous and start taking a position in tesla bubbles can last longer than you think

if you are a stock investor buckle ininvestors have enjoyed an amazing run stock prices are up by nearly a third over the past 18 months and seem to be hitting new record highs daily and the runup has been almost a straight line with stock price volatility—the ups and downs in prices—the lowest it has ever beenbut if you are an investor soak all of this in because it will soon be nothing but a memory the stock market is due for a significant correction—defined as a greater than 10 decline in stock prices—and stock returns in the next several years will be very pedestrian if they increase at all

impeached next 
based on all you people out there who are thinking about selling your apple shares based on what apple does or does not do we all don’t need to hear about it just sell your shares i for one do not think insightful speech is helpful to anyone and i for one will buy more apple shares if they do band apps that have insightful speech
word of advice apple is going to rally in the next few weeks and maybe a little after earnings depending on what price it gets to by then be ready because its going to fall again just like every other time but as we all know its going to rally again my son loaded up on jan 2023 125 calls when the stock was at 105 what i mean by loaded up is 60 calls he paid an avg of 12 it was a total of 72k you can look at the option price now and see that he has made pretty good money he will probably sell those right before or after earnings we will have a correction in february or march thats when you load up again if you like playing options of course holding the stock is the best way he also bought 600 september calls for tesla when the stock was at 410 he paid 80 for them and they went as low as 40 he sold them on friday for 154 could have sold them at 195 but its ok he made money good luck to all the long term holders

i’m thinking apple blows away earnings q1 2019 was 128 that’s with iphone 11 launching in sept q3 meaning initial sales of iphone 12 pushed to q4 reports also indicate apple raising iphone 12 production by 30 and app storeservices up another 30 also m1 and covid remote worklearning not in q4 2019 this makes me ballpark a 30 increase in eps for q4 2020 vs q4 2019 resulting in q4 eps increase of 40 resulting in q4 eps of 168 resulting in trailing twelve months pe of 38 at a stock price of 145 this doesn’t take into account large increases in free cash flow and net cash i mean every report about lead times and number crunching says every product apple is selling is crushin it any thoughts

my realistic outlook on apple heading into earnings week i think it will go up but not as high as some claim yes this is the first earnings report since iphone launch as well as the launch of the new imacs watches ipads and all the accessories for those products now a big part of revenue that plays a factor here is the stores which have not been open for quite some time they’ve simply relied on their own website partnered companies such as bestbuy and the cellular companies i don’t think 175200 per share will happen i expect similar progress as netflix a 16 increase which puts at 150ish especially when taking in these factors 100 billion report come wednesday is no impossible but i think it’s a overreaction i think it will be close though
gop aiders and abettors will never be forgotten

what apple really needs to do to strengthen its technology leadership in semiconductor industry and the entire tech sector is to buy this fastgrowing semiconductor company that has products with high demand made by cuttingedge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level making it a steal and great fit for apple and a great contribution to the us even if apple just got 25 ownership of the company it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and topnotch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this companys major moves in the future it would be similar to american companies and institutions ownership in asml one of the most important semiconductor company in the worldrumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global hightech gem this small super tech may double in price in a swift it already has since we started covering it one year ago closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon read our last analysis and you’ll seehttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5529995unitedstateislosinggoldenopportunitytobemajorshareholderofworldsbesttechcompanyhttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5519600biginvestorsswarmnvidiageofchinaafterastonishingprofitgrowthinq2andq3httpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5495008gequalcommtiappleshouldacquiregeofchinafordirtcheappricenowhttpsseekingalphacominstablog40777835gathoncapital5490372geofchinaenjoyedstrongprofitandgrowthamidcoronavirusoutbreak

in response to richard hs question how can apple build a car in such a short amount of time and the battery system as well well there are very reliable rumors that apple has sent a group to china to visit meet and talk with nio electric vehicle manufacturer about possibly working with each other to develop one for apple since nio has been added for six years now and is one of the highend cause in the ev market even ranked number one over the other six companies with tesla actually came in number six in overall quality and customer satisfaction so that it is always that possibility that if that merge would have happened in building a car together it would be beneficial to both companies big time because doing it alone apple is now stepping out of their boundaries but doing it with a successful and highly rated proven vehicle manufacturer it could be very viable and profitable time will tell happy new year everybody

the stock is up more in premarket than all the gains from yesterday with still a week until earnings this is looking very good now its just a matter of when it explodes not if thanks to everyone who sold me their shares at 127
it’s my view that apple needs to return money to shareholdersat least 50 every yearthey don’t that much in the balance sheet funds are reducing because they see better return elsewhere does tim cook have an answer for them
i see liberals desperate to save apple monday will show how the constitution should be respected regardless of your totalitarian beliefs we the people will have a voice

100 12680 long and strong
whats wild to me is that people that cant even spell or use punctuation correctly think their assessment of current market conditions and aapls financial wellbeing is anything remotely worth listening to if youre looking for answers read through the literature your broker provides
the tim cook army is coming for tesla tesla has only a limited time to try to fit into that oversized bubble of a market cap it current has because when apple comes out its going to come out swinging look what happened when the iphone first came out  blackberry pretty much lost massive business the entire smartphone industry shifted thats what could happen and it will not take decades for apple to make a destructive entrance by partnering with existing manufacturers it is relieved of having to construct massive foundries which cost billions partner to reduce costs and improve margins the apple way the smart way

an opinion and a question i own 300 shares of aapl that i bought at 11500just to see if i could make a few bucks on it ive been watching it for 3 or 4 months now and if dumped it today id pocket around 6kwith earnings coming out next week and all of the chatter about the stock going up im wondering if it would be smart to sell around 50 shares now or before wednesday to pocket my gains put an order in to sell it all at some given pricemaybe 120 or 125 or just let it ride the problem is that every time apple announces earnings the stock goes up and then it takes a dive this particular earnings report is somewhat special because of the new line of iphonesbut that doesnt happen every year i like to have money in my handsnot just watch it on paper the dividend from apple is a jokeunless you own enough i have a lot of money invested in closed end funds that pay anywhere from 6 to 11  and thats where i make money the 82 that aapl pays is not exactly my cup of tea im not in the market for the futureim in for right nowim not a kid any more any and all comments would be greatly appreciated

whats the better investment apple or bitcoin there is some wild talk claiming bitcoin will give apple a run for the money by the end of the year of course i dont want to believe that i honestly dont understand what makes bitcoin or any of the cryptocurrencies as valuable as they are like who needs a 50000 coin i know theres more to it than that but why the sudden growth in value what changed over by the last couple of months why would investors choose bitcoin over apple gambling for quick gains again risk of the world currency collapsing i had thought bitcoin was just a thing to pump because it gained and quickly lost value over the last couple of years now people are saying its going to be worth more than all the major tech companies in a year or so anyway i find these types of unusual investments quite interesting no matter ill be sticking with apple maybe apple should be buying bitcoin instead of buying back its own stock apple can turn 20b into 200b in a few months seeing how fast bitcoin is moving up in value so crazy

have held aapl for many years i ordered an iphone 12 pro tracking showed it clearly got derailed stolen somethingbut it didnt make it anywhere near me called apple instead of sending me a different phone they said theyd investigate no word nothing 2 weeks i later i called them back and they said theyd have to investigate ie not that theyd continue the investigation that they said they were going to start 2 weeks prior that theyd start an investigation and it would be at least another 2 before they concluded their investigation but probably longer hence they treat the complete failure of the carrier they choose in this case ups as if it is the phone one pays them for  and their phones arent inexpensive the two are utterly unrelated there was nothing to investigate w respect to the fact i didnt receive the phone their customer service was half of what made their phones so desirable that half appears to be slipping into the abyss of nonexistent at this point their competition must realize that all they have to do is best the iphone and offer their device at a much lower price point  bc customer service isnt a consideration im holding but im keeping a very watchful eye bc unless their digital services and nonphone devices look like they can make up for what i predict will be a yuge slow down in their phone sales  i will consider selling

for those tha feel the impending correction of tesla in the immediate future im not here to bash tesla love the company have the utmost respect for musk especially in the direction he has been able to push forward in what i am here for is to explain what is going on with valuation anyone saying tesla will go to 20k is just ignorant i know tesla doesnt trade on fundamentals but think about this for a moment tesla has been the most shorted stock ever when they hit the sp500 bigger funds begin to buy in making those that recently have been short unable to continue and have been forced to buy back the stock at a loss increased price this will not last much longer eventually you will have some big time shorts currently just micheal burrell come in and this will fall hard it will get back up but do you want to risk that much depreciation look at the numbers you should invest where you can make 100 to 400 over a year can you look at teslas market cap and really believe all the big hedge funds that are now buying in are going to hold when it reaches 30 or more  than what it is now and how hard do youthink this will fall ive been investing in spacs for less than a year what do i know right i do have a portfolio that has gained 756 and they arent sitting in overvalued positions they are reinvested into companies with the potential for 3 to 400 returns for the year currently my latest position was in hcac warrants hcacw i bought them at 18 also bought more at 35 they are at 47 now they already merged with canoo and will likely get to 10 to 15 in the near future everyone should have seen by now hyundais surge nearly 20 billion added to market cap just on the rumor that they are in talks with apple heres the fun part canoo is doing the engineering services for hyundais ev sector they have designed their new skateboard platform for them they have their own as well and will be a disruptor in the market in so many ways but just think about this aapl has talked about their monocell as superior battery tech they are now talking with hyundai musk has said that monocells are impossible and canoo tweeted the new year in with ready to keep engineering the impossible in 2021 as if to give musk a heads up then of course left with thisjust read between the lines but the rumor and sell on the news im not here to pump im here to help those that have a gut feeling right now listen to it its made me 756 for 2020 and im already up another 60 since then canoo is goev warrants are goevw roll your profits over and gain another big run them when tesla has had its correction we can be ready to jump back in again

im gonna give you an opinion take it or leave it you make up your mind tesla has been the absolute most shorted stock like many billions lost and with this new surge up i believe it is due to shorts unable to take it any longer this cannot go like this forever at 500 post split this had a potential downfall to 300 at 850 nothings changed and the downfall is still 300 so i urge you to at least take profits and if your a new trader do some math you would have to reach 1600 to get 100 i generally invest only in companies that can potentially reach 400 per year you wont see that with tesla on to some advice take it or leave it aapl is getting into the ev spacs with hyundai spilling the beans that they are in talks with apple about batteries etc goev or canoo will be providing the skateboard and engineering services to hyundai for their next evs and likely for apples a company that has a market cap of 3 billion now do you think a 700b company would be a better investment or a 3b company i can see canoo going to 40 to 50b market cap pretty quickly  next 5 years do the math can tesla match that are they going to be providing everything ever produced that is where their market cap is going ive been in canoo warrants at 18 and averaged up to 35 anything under 5 is a bargain just some advice take it or leave it go with your gut your subconscious or whatever you want to call it

pessimists who say it will take apple years before project titan becomes a reality are completely missing the point apples been working on the tech since 2014 and apple doesnt need to build billion dollar foundries like tesla it can just partner with extisting auto makers in creating the vehicle think of how amd and nvidia design their gpus and then have other manufacturers like tsmc create the product same thing applies here

aapl has passed the old low and slow pe days and rightfully so as they have been a strong performer from all aspects the car battery segment is still wide open in a high growth industry  the industry is projected to grow at 25 over the next 10 years i would think it would speed their market share by buying a good existing player such as nio this could push their market cap by more than double maybe by three times in less than two years nio has established themselves as the quality leader in china including tesla which has dropped from excellent to fair in 2 years apple and nio would establish first place world wide in quality and and on board accessories and give them a higher tech pe

only six business days until earnings so maybe apple wii rise into earnings i wouldnt go by today because almost all stocks were up and apple wasnt up as much as some other tech stocks not that it matters apple will continue to rise i have no doubts the holiday quarter will be strong but dont look for a netflix type of share gain because netflixs market cap is around 300b which is nowhere close to apples 22t market cap apple practically buys back netflixs market cap in shares every six months i keep thinking about what sort of acquisitions apple could be making with all that money being used for buybacks apple could own all the american car companies by now im just saying if apple wants to get into the auto business money wouldnt be an obstacle i know its not that simple but it sounds rather interesting because of the ev craze in the marketanyway the next couple of weeks should be exciting if apple had done really well for the holiday quarter but im always wary about wall streets expectations of apple im hoping for decent results and good guidance for the next quarter which investors will appreciate

apple will be the topperforming faang stock in 2021 this is the third consecutive year we’ve made this prediction in 2019 apple was the top performer and the stock is set to repeat in 2020 we think apple will come out on top again in 2021 based on four factors• the accelerating digital transformation means more people are working and learning from home providing a continued tailwind for the ipad and mac businesses about 25 of total revenue we believe these two segments can grow at 10 plus in 2021 and 2022 compared to flat growth in the last few years• 5g enthusiasm will grow in the back half of the year starting a two to threeyear iphone upgrade cycle• while street fy21 revenue growth estimates of 15 are in line with our expectations we believe consensus estimates for fy22 of 5 yy revenue growth are too low we expect those estimates to inch higher throughout fy21 ultimately we believe fy22 revenue growth will be closer to 10• growing anticipation of new business segments that likely won’t launch until 2022 at the earliest we expect hardware subscription offerings that build toward a 360° bundle along with growing optimism around a massive expansion in the company’s addressable market with apple car

reuters copy info fyigltahuge newsreuters  apple incaapl is moving forward with selfdriving car technology and is targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology people familiar with the matter told reutersthe iphone makers automotive efforts known as project titan have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch at one point appleaapl drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals doug field an appleaapl veteran who had worked at tesla inctsla returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019since then appleaapl has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers two people familiar with the effort said asking not to be named because applesaapl plans are not public applesaapl goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as alphabet incs waymo which has built robotaxis to carry passengers for a driverless ridehailing servicecentral to applesaapl strategy is a new battery design that could radically reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicles range according to a third person who has seen applesaapl battery design apple aapl declined to comment on its plans or future products making a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for appleaapl a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world but has never made a car it took elon musks tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making carsif there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that its probably appleaapl but at the same time its not a cellphone said a person who worked on project titan it remains unclear who would assemble an appleaaplbranded car but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles and there is still a chance appleaapl will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker rather than the iphone maker selling an appleaaplbranded car one of the people addedtwo people with knowledge of applesaapl plans warned pandemicrelated delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond apple aapl has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system including lidar sensors which help selfdriving cars get a threedimensional view of the road two people familiar with the companys plans said apples aapl car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances another person said some sensors could be derived from applesaapl internally developed lidar units that person said applesaapl iphone 12 pro and ipad pro models released this year both feature lidar sensorsreuters had previously reported that appleaapl had held talks with potential lidar suppliers but it was also examining building its own sensoras for the cars battery appleaapl plans to use a unique monocell design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials one of the people said apples aapl design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery giving the car a potentially longer range appleaapl is also examining a chemistry for the battery called lfp or lithium iron phosphate the person said which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithiumion batteriesits next level the person said of applesaapl battery technology like the first time you saw the iphoneapple aapl had previously engaged magna international incmga in talks about manufacturing a car but the talks petered out as applesaapl plans became unclear a person familiar with those previous efforts said magna did not immediately respond to a request for commentto turn a profit automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to appleaapl which would be a newcomer to the automotive marketin order to have a viable assembly plant you need 100000 vehicles annually with more volume to come the person said
apple go green 
ill buy more electronic car upup
they keep saying apple cant continue to grow but how cant they grow as it would be difficult to have a company become their competitor at this point we have everything hooked up to apple
picture apple  1000
will it break 139 this time if earnings are up by 30
at the earnings call all anlysists care about is iphone if the iphone is up we going to fly if not we will go down

what’s the average annual return of apple shares i’m looking at starting to invest in either apple or an etf like arkk just wanted some input i read on google that it was like 42 average annually for the last ten years  still new to stocks and what not  thanks 
2 weeks before history making record earnings the climb upward has begun
apple is in oversold territory it corrected about 9 i expect a retest of 135138 in 2 weeks
all the bank stocks hitting high even in zero interest environmentindustrials cyclicals materials anything you name it at 52 weeks high only big tech is sitting out as funds are rotating out of big tech it’s frustrating to see daily decline on green day’s which is why we vent out but we all know the big tech will have an average 3040 yearly return in 510 years the issue is most of us are short term investors hopefully we see some strong buying next week during the shortened trading week and get ready for blowout earnings aapl amzn fb google
all of a sudden everyone is happy with apple for those of u who gave up u do not deserve to be a long term share holder 
expiration day is always the best day to buy aapl it’s a nobrainer winning formula that will pay off especially this time in the weeks and months to come
aapl raised iphone production 30  the number will blow the lid off
wimi nio aapl get in tomorrow earnings out going to the moon pm yes

nice vshape today might end green today great dip buy today
150 after earnings this entry is a gift
apple has become so innovative but it does not surprise me at all technology is just unlimited just like one ufo expert said we only know 11000000 of what they know now i may not believe in ufos  but he made a great point ultimately robots will do everything for us from planting crops to finance and accounting and health management and surgeries and flying and driving and groceries and cooking and cleaning and calculating etc etc etc
back to 150 range
get on the train buy buy buy  it’s going to the moon 
next month 160 
long way to 140

those new 1600 checks will spike apple product sales only 15 of those getting them really need them they should do this all over the world
announcement made 
no questions because the teleprompter cant be fed that fast
aapl is a core holding in most funds because apple continually pushes the envelopeapple has a big incentive to figure it out if india works out for apple the company’s enormous 2 trillion market cap will look measly in the notsodistant future
making cars is not the same as assembling phones cars are hardware intensive phones are software intensive apple would need to have complete control of any car factory you cant do some cad design in palto alto and phone the guy in china with next months quota i dont believe the reuters article need direct confirmation from cook
upgrade jan 19 2021 rbc captital upgrades aapl 145 both near term and long term bullish good luck
not much discussion of apple here any idea where can i find actual discussion of their business and not a bunch social commentary
see my predictions about this amazing company i wonder how many thumbs down i got and how
going up today
im amazed by all the naysayers when apple decided to get in the cell phone business coming from computers there where many people who said they are making the wrong decision they know nothing about cell phone and they were late to the party fast forward and now apple is the leading cell phone company and all the naysayers are praising them now this company has foresight to expand into an emerging market in which they showed patience and watch the trial and error of everyone else especially tesla before they threw their hat in the ring im a putting my money on apple and will send ignore a bunch of no visionary know it alls who think the entire globe revolve around their limited and narrow way of thinking apple service an entire world of people and is in business to make money off the entire world this is why we invested in the company to begin with to make money not because of a corporations political leaning because we all know the only political leaning a corporation care about is their bottom line
over 60 of this stock is owned by institutions they bought more last week do you really think they are going to let their investments drop even further especially right before earnings are released it looks really bad for them they will push the price up this week
i need some honest advice i am very inexperienced at buying stocks decided i would invest families christmas money in stocks instead of putting in bank account is this a good time to buy apple stocks
huge sell off next week and in coming days aapl 100 after earning
not much of a santa claus rally for apple but its nice to see apple sitting with a pe of 40 and a market cap of 224t thats pretty solid in my opinion im certain earnings will be quite good so i have no concerns at all with apples share price not moving back to alltime highs id like to see apple at 135 before years end but its ok if it doesnt get that high theres no rush when it gets there doesnt matter but it will get there soon enough
tsla will pass apples market cap just a matter of time
it sure looks like apple is about to take a breather like 122
it will probably end the end at 133134 where i hope it finds support if not it will go to the next support at 131 once it hits these support levels it will go up and climb to 140145 of course its nice if it doesnt dip and just goes up but i think this dip will happen very soon today probably or first week of trading in jan i hope it stays at the support levels before climbing again
i remember paying 514  share for aapl for all my shares but that was before the 71 split  41 split i thought that was too expensive back then now look at it

apple doesn’t do big acquisition and hence doesn’t need a big balance sheet of 100 billion dollars plus they are generating at least 50b cash every year it’s time to return cashwith juicy div and buyback

apple makes about 160 billion per year just selling phones so making 2 billion per year selling cars is a game changer unless apple is going to figure out how to make 25000 per car in profitthis just doesn’t make much sense apple is all about nosebleed margins and huge profits cars don’t fit thisapple should buy eose and tap into 800 growth in green energy

apple will have its best quarter of all time  again it’s coming i don’t think many appreciate the iphone 12 demand  shortage thats out there or the combination of its services or the reduced shipping pack sizes or the fact its mini phones with low prices have insane specifications or the amount they save by not shipping a usbc charger block and its become the most environmentally friendly company ever but i really like that few see it’s going to again post stellar quarter after quarter and is responsible for most of the markets overall ytd gains if the rest catches up a bit apple will continue even higher

with earnings about a week away i just wanted to share some thoughtsfirstly about analyst expectations folks if apple reports massive revenue its great for us dont get me wrong but some analysts calling for 100 billion or more in revenue thats kind of unrealistic its almost like theyre setting up apple to fail what if apple only reports 85 to 90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price and lets not forget apple did not provide guidance for this quarter so expectations are too unrealistic were still in the middle of a pandemic were not out of the woods yet if apple can perform as good as they did last year id be satisfied but if they do even better then that then id be very pleased secondly i believe the selling is way overdone we should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements the stock held onto the support level very well technically so i believe the stock has a lot more room to run theres so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth the continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long runthird i mentioned this in the past but i dont believe apple will comment about project titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers so dont expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on i know many are eagerly waiting for this but stillfourth when earnings are announced pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that arent being focused on as much like apple fitness i believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future definitely not priced in at this current priceown it dont trade it apple long

i havent been interested in apple for a long time because i dislike the changes that have been made over the years ive been a mac user since the early 80s and i think they have become the antithesis of their original mission however i am pleased they took a stand to protect our country from insurrection i wont get into political battles here i just want to say that i think apple made the best move for the nation and i am buying contrary to this backlash because i believe the price will rise
lithium iron phosphate battery technology will revolutionize the ev market because it does not contain cobalt like current battery technology  cobalt is expensive and is mined in the congo which is considered to be a conflict mineral that companies are banning apple’s decision to go with this battery technology is a game changer for ev’s and it will dominate the market because it is also a lower cost technology that can makeevs very affordable compared to current gasoline cars

it appears as though ibm and intel are in wall streets doghouse so maybe those dumping investors will take a longer look at apple one can only hopeintel looks to be on a slippery slope if they have to compete with tsmc and amd intels new ceo is making some bold claims about turning things around but that wont come overnight intel has been falling out of favor for a few years with their inability to fab at smaller chip nodes intel isnt going out of business but is no longer on the cutting edge of fabrication having to ask tsmc for chip fab help doesnt bode well for intelintels new ceo doesnt want some rookie company like apple showing them up in chip design so the fight is on talk is cheap apple has been designing arm chips for a decade so apple is up to the task when apples base m1 cpu is giving an i9 fits i think intel is going to have to go back to the drawing board

semi conductor sector is hot very hot why do i talk about the semiconductors sector on apple board it is because microprocessors aka chips aka semiconductors are more and more widely used even being widely used in autos these days  and when they are hot and selling fast we know the end users such as apple etc are hot and selling their products rapidly
a house does not count down the tree that gives it shade126 has been the line in the sand  the pivoteight trading days until earnings  127i think the time for trading is now suspended everyone got fat at the table anywaystay long
for all of us specially the young people  had you invested 1000 in 1965 with warren buffett who would be worth more than 70 millions now because his annual return has been over 23 plus percentage from that time till now granted 1000 was lot of money that time and the minimum wage was about 2 an hour but if i had common sense i could have saved up that kind of money by tightening my belt a little bit just a wee bit so you can start investing now today  join a 401k or 403 b plans etc invest monthly etc and pretend like that money was not there or it wasn’t for you to spend
take the opportunity to buy more semiconductors today as well there is a severe shortage of chipssemiconductors in the world according to an article in a chinese daily a short while back that’s because its expanded use in computers robots autos iphones  graphics simulations  artificial intelligence cloud computing and hallographic technology etc etc etc
the strategy should be to own core holdings such as apple microsoft intel nvidia qualcomm wmt costco home depot paypal visa mastercard target google etc etc etc and also buy mutual funds there are great family of funds out there among them is fidelity some of the great funds in fidelity are select software and it services otc fidelity select semiconductor blue chip growth growth fund small capital growth consumer discretionary fidelity nasdaq etc etc  if anyone of them are closed they will guide you to a similar fund which is open once you do that then sit back and relax and watch it grow enjoy life concentrate on your family and work take up golf and sking and join toastmasters club etc etc or take a vacation

apple will do pretty well on earnings but it appears netflix is going to put apple to shame in share price gains despite all the streaming content competition thats pretty impressive i dont know why apple cant load up on video content for their appletv service apple has over a billion active devices on iphones ipads desktops and laptops to serve content to i keep hearing people say apples streaming content is rather thin apple cant just grow subscribers with original content because thats too expensive apple needs some classic content to fatten up its library i still watch xfiles magnum pi the rockford files etc good shows are always watchable even if theyre decades old how can apple compete with netflix for new subscribers if there isnt much content to watch so netflix shareholders will likely see 15 to 20 gains in share price on earnings thats where the big money is going and its perfectly understandable apple may be ignored netflix is much easier to move than apple isi think apple needs to doubledown on streaming content to pull more subscribers that seems like a nobrainer to me will apple get even 8 share price gains on earnings i sure hope so
the apple  is growing i knew it would hoping for some dips to buy more but i don’t think it will happen anytime soon  like the song by the 5th dimension “up up  away”

iphone 12 sales soar in china to close out 2020the strong demand is expected to continue through lunar new year which bodes well for apple investors apple sold north of 18 million iphones during q4 a staggering number which would suggest that apple took more than 20 market share to close out the year a combination of pent up demand and a host of 5g models are likely driving the iphones robust sales the momentum is expected to continue through chinas lunar new year holiday on feb 12 which would give apple another quarter of staggering sales similar to q4

cbs this morning interview of tim cook was actually organized to facilitate another announcement that announcement was not a new product but something bigger and better than that gayle told her cohostsshe gave no indication of what such an announcement could be but the circumstances surrounding the interview have led some to speculate on what may be announcedmost likely the announcement relates to the ongoing fight against covid19 analysts said it could be that the company is preparing to announce that its stores – many of which are closed around the world – will be used to help deliver the vaccine for instanceanalyst neil cybart noted that such an announcement “makes sense” since the interview was conducted virtually but with ms king sat in an apple store vaccines “are certainly more important than new products” and the company has offered to help with the pandemic in the pastprevious efforts have included the development of the bluetooth contacttracing technologies that allow phones to be used to track potential coronavirus exposures and the design of special face masks for staffmr cybart also noted that ms king “is a big hitter for cbs” and that as such it is likely the interview would really be used to announce something significant
