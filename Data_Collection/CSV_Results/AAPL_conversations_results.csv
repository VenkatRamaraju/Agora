"Our group bought at this level. we added FB too and AMZN . Big rally ahead ...machine learning sid this is hedgies games,,SHORT SQUEEZE will happen soon"
Any business school major knows that hiking the dividend is the most optimistic thing management can do to express extreme confidence in the business going forward. Look for good things to come from APPL in 2021.
Apple is killing me. How much more can I take. Thankfully my su and ba shares have been up to offset my apple play. Holding but adding su today . Common apple enough already
Tomorrow will be a great day
Might need to keep some cash ready!! Gonna buy for sure if this goes below 127 
Does anyone have any decent fundamentals as to why Apple is dropping like a hot potato?
WE were here in 2008. Warren arrived in 2016.Not bad!
"Apple car? Maybe apple shoujd just sell the tech to Kia, not really an apple car?"
Going to be an up day today
"Honestly the signals were there to sell Apple. Off good earnings, stock dropped and then continued to drop as Dow and Nasdaq rose. It was just a matter of time before markets gave some back taking this down like this."
Guys having the patience of a 5 year old will not make u money in the stock market....it will lose u money.
I’ve worked hard to accumulate 2307 shares and I’m not giving in and selling any. I can’t wait for the next split. 9200 shares. Holding for 5-10 years. Don’t need the money. Still 60k in the green. Sleep well longs
"be patient. times will tell. end day buy at high or low, bearish or bullish ? in long u will benefit"
Fear not. Uncle Joe has promised Neera Tanden the top position in his new Sicherheitsdienst bureau.
"You don’t sell AAPL in this market climate, much less on a Friday. My friends who sold a year ago w/pandemic news, or in March (after vomiting) wound up leaving millions on the table. Learn from their loss"
"Everybody set your shares for sell at 300. So that way lenders cant bet or lend against it, Please. this is enough, i am sick of big boys playing with apple. Play with something else. Not apple."
I’m guessing most here bought in the $130s-$140s? No wonder why your bltching! If your long your gonna have to wait for the big gains! Those you bought under $120 don’t really care
"I agree, Buffet is the wisest investor of all time, when he thinks Apple is overvalued bubble and running to the exit, you better run as fast as possible."
This is all Wall Street has? A dump after the greatest quarter in human history? LOL
"today all the wise minds in the world are not going to change the direction of the financial market now that we have joe bazoka in the white house ,, can not wait for 2024 ... any body but a democrat will change the marketr by at least 5000 pts, look gas up look interest rates up illleagal imagration.up somebody let out prisons mental hospitals,,,, having a market mind .no matter.... every one not wanted here .no 19 test ..."
A blip of green. We need this to reach 160 by April end
"Good news ,the gropin JB is up and awake."
"Apple longs know not to panic on days like today. The drop is due to options and day traders. These dips are opportunities to accumulate. When a company has solid fundamentals and record setting earnings and growth, you know you have a good investment. Just ask anyone who's been holding for 5+ years. Own it don't trade it."
MARKET GREEN MAGIC FED TALK
still looking good boys! We are well on our way!
iCar is coming for sure... see you at $200!
"So we have an agreement between two companies to partner on an EV that, if it all works out, will produce a product in 10 years. Massive investment by APPL and massive risk, so why is the stock popping on the announcement?"
"I sole 10,000 shares my complete holdings. Maybe I'll buy back under 100, this is sca-roo-roo-roo'd."
"Current ABSURD Valuations are not sustainable!A HEAVY MARKET CORRECTION is imminent!DO NOT BUY the US Stocks in this MEGA BUBBLE, at these PEAKED prices!US Stocks DO NOT WORTH THAT MUCH!$AAPL $TSLA $JPM"
"The trolls are out today, lol. AAPL stock will hit $175 this year, i am not worried. Best thing to do is hold long and not watch daily movements. Apple had the best earnings on the planet as usual.. 111.4 Billion revenue in 3 months."
"AAPL CLOSES UP OVER 141 TOMORROW. THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARY OF COVID 19 CASES GOING DOWN, STIMULUS AND OPENING STORES IS AAPL. WITH 111 BIL IN EARNING LAST QUARTER. AAPL SHOULD BE AT 155 RIGHT NOW"
Muting MASA was the best trade of the day!
"Latest rumor is Nissan, with its Tesla-beating Ariya EV model, is putting itself out there as Apple’s potential partner"
"Record date for dividends tomorrow , have a felling it will help bump volume up!! Hoping to see $140-$142 tomorrow!"
"apple may never close up again. this is the new reality. I would short it every day, until the trend changes."
Can you imagine if aapl had Tesla PE ratio ?? Aapl should be at 6578$ !!!
"Anyway the price is already six months the same. You can sell now, buy something else, make some money and return back here to buy apple in september 2021 and price will be the same. Why waste your time and money for nothing on apple. There are some others opportunities growing every day."
"Hopefully, we cleared out the village but, there are probably a few snipers left."
"Dear, Apple stock holders. Instead of watching AAPL ( Bullish or Bearish ). Why don’t you promote their business at your personal social media platforms. Isn’t Apple stocks are your business?"
this is the type of market that turns people into daytraders. down for two weeks. why hold stocks anymore? should just daytrade buying at bottom of days dip around 9:38am and selling the recovery move on the daily. that would be way more profitable than holding shares.
"Read all about it. All Apple stores are opened for business. So products are selling , the sales up and revenue up all results into more bottom line income. So your choice buy the best equity or sell it and latter feel sick."
"dang it!!. i wanted to buy after hours under 137, any way I bought at 137.38. This is classic manipulation of smart money with market makers. They will stop out all retailers, so they can cover in premarket. The force of retailers will wipe out institution like gamestop. I hear 150 in pre market. I know their intentions.. buy load up with both hand. There is no way price can be before earnings despite tsunami earnings. Gut feeling tell me a BIG SHORT SQUEEZE Is coming to AAPL"
"Wow, it’s hot here...aapl is not tsla, just buy the dip and you will be rewarded...at certain point aapl feels as safe as bond..."
Just remember this people. It’s not who votes￼. It’s who counts the votes!!
"Apple climbs steadily. It doesn’t do 10% gains in a day. Those of u calling for 160 by Wednesday are being far too optimistic. It will get there, just not Wednesday"
"You are dreaming if you think this action is from investors with long time horizons,"
this wont stop until some sort of news comes out and knowing cook we will have to rely on rumors instead of actual news from apple. down another 1% today. at this rate we will be down 20% next week from the 145 ath which will be around 118. about to print 130-131 area if it breaks 130 its down to split price 124 as support.
Watch the Dow pull back a bit tomorrow and shave another $2 off Apple. Stock is in trouble. Rising markets and this is down $20 in the same period. That’s a WOW.
"If EV Apple car is not rumor and real thing, than can it reach $5,000 per share? This a big thing they are not only going to make cars only but all the technology and hardware component, batteries and all can also be retailed of sold to other EV. imo"
"If apple has a partnership with kia to build apple ev, would it make a positive push?"
"People selling off now, this is going to tank big time. Hope I'm wrong have 1800 shares."
"So 19 days ago - APPL touched $145 (all time high) and on that day, we closed at $143. We have been RED 12 days out of 19 days. RED days, on average we lost $2 dollars a day. On green days, we gained an average of $ we lost $1.May God help us :("
enjoying game stop very much. I have made 200% in 7 hours already. I love the excitement. apple is boring.
"Market sell off. Most everything, especially tech stocks are taking a hit. We’ll be back. The only thing you can do now that makes sense, buy more. Apple will move, this is just a breather."
"I hate watching APPL flounder like this. But... I look at the history and performance of the stock, so I will just wait it out. I'm sure it will go back up at some point !"
Nice finish at the end. Me thinks the selling is done. If you are not yet into Apple or if you are looking to add this is a great entry point. $200 by year end 
I hope this downward trend continues all week.looking to load up.......insane drop with the best ER in their history...
How much lower will aapl drop tomorrow?
BEING HONEST HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TRUMP WAS BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY !
I am not buying a new car until 2024. Watch out Tesla here we come!
"Lot of us take financial seminars to learn more about investing and here is the secret and it costs nothing : (1) stay long (2) buy and hold your core holding . Over 31 but I will list a few=Apple, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, nxp, Marvell, Qualcomm, Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, Target, Microsoft, etc etc and then invest in mutual funds such as from Fidelity etc etc . Buy Blue Chip Growth, Growth Companies (if closed to new investors it will guide you to an alternative), Fidelity Select semiconductor (a severe shortage for semiconductors is expected in 2021 and onwards), OTC, Fidelity Select Technology, Fidelity Small Capital Growth etc etc. Then sit back and relax enjoy life minimize stress and watch your investments grow. Make sure you add to your investments on a regular basis. Then take over other hobbies like reading, golfing, camping, swimming, yes going to Church, spend more time with your family and friends etc etc"
It's Apple Dividend pay day! Some may shun that dividend....but it grows EVERY YEAR. My dividend yield vs. my cost basis is now in excess of 4%.....In another 10 years or so it'll likely be above 10% or more.
"As far as I’m concerned, these prices are a gift."
"Apple's returns past 4 years:2 year return: 244%3 year return: 188%5 year return: %407%Every year we hear the same story. Apple is a dinosaur stock that's overpriced and won't move up much more. Yet every year, Apple proves the doubters wrong. Apple is in the midst of a super cycle. It will enter the EV market within the next few years and has yet to unveil its AI products. Its new M1 chip is said to be revolutionary and leaves its competitors in the dust. Its EV battery which its been working on since 2015 will be a major disruptor in the industry that Tesla will not even be able to compete with.With Apple, I've learned that you have to stay patient and stay long. Never mind the short term chatter. You will be handsomely rewarded for your patience."
Is it true Apple Bought 2.5 million in bitcoin?
Just thrown down $15grand on Apple ! This company has a massive future !
Apple should be up least three tomorrow . It’s ready to breakout
next week will start out bad and then it will level off in the 115 range
"0 shortable shares at AMC something big is brewing, buy early."
Oh my. We are GREEN!
"Dividend pay out next week, so i expect this to jump next week. before the 8th of January record date!"
My 2 cents! AAPL $130 by Friday. No brainer!
Someone tell me why we didn’t climb like AMZN and GOOG stocks are?????
If the market cannot support a strong company like aapl then the canary has died.
Hyundai & Kia build quality & assembly are far superior to Tesla! They build safe dependable quality cars.
here come the day traders for the quick flip. they buy every dip.
Paper loss don’t hurt! I still have all my shares that will recover. Rental income sure does help in these times. Holding without any pain
"Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple Squeeze out the shorts before they Hammer this great company Stay positive and focus on the technological pipeline "
Apple won’t go down on Asian news! Their the ones that opened their mouths to begin with. Apple  never said anything about talks with Kia. Their stocks should go down not apples
70.4% appreciation ytd. Maybe that’s why we’re not going anywhere fast now. Chill out y’all
"Apple iCar will be a smashing success. Those already in the ecosystem will buy it. Those not in the ecosystem will buy it, becoming ecosystem members who’ll then buy iPhones and Macs. All will happily hand Apple money via endless subscriptions and services. The stock, it will soar, to the limits of your imaginations it will soar."
"Amazing Amazing earnings. 100Bill quarter. What other company can make that claim? The markets are very volatile right now, otherwise Apple would be up to 150 after hours. Keep your eye on the ball. This is the most profitable company in U.S. history with a massive pile of cash and is on the cusp of entering into AI and EV. Buy the dips and ignore the short term noise. This should meet or beat all the bullish price targets by the end of the year."
The way Warren Buffett has been unloading his AAPL positions is very scary. I am going to sell my positions and will look forward to enter around $100-105!
But please save me some good prices special Apple friends ... I can’t get in premarket. Sound good ok thanks. Then we go to the moon. 10amish 
"Take a look at the yield curve people ! It’s another possible explanation for some of the red !Fundamentals are excellent for apple so buy, hold and enjoy  "
"let's go.....drop to 120, I want to buy back in."
The same hedge funds complaining to the SEC about how they got victimized by GME....are the same guys who colluded with other hedge funds to drop Apple.
"if they dont ring the bell fast enough, I guess we will see red today.......15m volume in the last 10min...purely dumping...."
Buffet says AAPL is one of his crown jewels. Thanks Warren my Family Jewels are swelling after todays run up!!
Great news for apple  imo maybe lucid is still in play or something better 
I think it is a solid buy. Forget shorts this is long term money in the bank.
"If you're freaking over this, you shouldn't be handling your own investing. Now, take a look at a 1, 2, or 5 year chart of AAPL. STILL worried??? Good grief."
Classic....let's make the call options expire worthless by selling off the last 10 minutes. SMH.
On the way to 150 by Friday
"The US stock futures started sliding again.Same pattern for the last three days: major averages drop early in the morning and then slowly creep up towards the close.Tomorrow morning, the major averages are likely to drop again. Will we see a slow recovery towards the close tomorrow? Don't bet on it."
"Aapl is extremely undervalued, will close positive. Trade accordingly"
I wouldn't be worried except that the entire market seems to be held up by stimulus checks and fundamentals don't seem to mater at all!
Beautiful bounce to add more short. $124 bounce expected the test lows $118 then down to $112 We will see robinhood holders plays out.
All good. Up tomorrow. If for whatever reason it is not then buy the dip.
"Now is a time (just like around this time last year) the smart investors in the market (there are so few of us) are dollar cost averaging our buys into AAPL until the market smartens up, like it did last Spring"
Like anything in life....it’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.
"Buffet called apple one of his family ￼Jewels. Even though I’ve been frustrated with Apple performance of late, I can’t sell it."
seems like tech stocks getting a little love this morning.... and its a friday to boot
see you at $140 tomorrow
"Nasdaq composite up 220, apple up 82 cent. money flows to Google, Amazon and Tesla."
AAPL HAS MAJOR SUPPORT AT 118.00 from there next stop is 145 by June 2021
130 by week's end
"This is not the stock to trade !!It’s for long termWait for 2 years, you will be rewarded with $100-150 further upside from current price !!"
"my GOD Dow is up 130 points I thinkit S&P will turn greeny green too soon. We will see what beloved Apple does but don't be surprised whence yo see it go up. The shorteeeeees if the office next door are throwing jabs at me, teasing, taunting, jumping like wild beans, laughing. Yes siri bob when they go home to mama tonight the lady will welcome them as ""my hero made moneyeeeeeee too day"". We longs need to haveit a back bone or these smart shortteeees will continue to eat us alive. Thanko"
"All major techs are down, not just Apple, at some point this will end too, MAAGA stocks are the future for the next 10-15 years and they will comeback!"
"Again. Bought 2 iPad Air 4s, 3 Earpod Pros, 1 Apple Watch SE, 1 Apple TV HD, 1 Family Apple Fitness+ year sub, and 1 Mac Air M1. All for Christmas. One guy for his family. Earnings will be through the roof."
Making some quick decisions within the next 14 minutes: Should I buy more Apple or Fidelity Blue Chip Growth with Apple as a major holding! I think I will go with a 50:50 ratio. Both are great and fine investments
"Look at the one year picture and this is about to go for a huge increase (if you believe in the graphs), but if not consider Apple advantage over the car manufacturers that have to become tech companies to survive"
"I will never sell my apple stocks, apple is success, if you sell you will regret for sure"
All you nay sayers missed the boat before. You won’t buy a single share and your account will still be nothing 10 years from now. Invest and keep on buying.
It’s interesting how all the troll boys magically reappeared 
Dropped $3 in last minute - heavy manipulation for end of month and options expiration.
"too many cheerleaders here, market is crashing as its built on record margin debt"
I told ya Apple was going to $115 before it would see $150.....It's headed there. SELL SELL SELL
Today AAPL printed both $136+ as an intra day high and $134+ as an intra day low.Now two extreme trends of two are open. Look at the historical prices.Has anyone been noticing the dwindling volume? Today's volume was 10% less than Friday which was 50% lower than previous days.
"I’ve lost a few thousand today on this. I don’t care all that much as it will recover in time, but it can’t go without being said this is pure criminality once again by WS. Their over leveraged positions were exploited by some smart people on reddit and once again smart money is paying the price. Unbelievable"
"Katy Huberty:”Investors are likely to underestimate the financial impact of a potential Apple Car, especially when considering the effect that Apple’s entrance into other markets has had on the addressable opportunity. Simplistically, Apple typically expands the size of any market it enters. At maturity, the iPod shipped more than 3x annual peak units of its predecessor, the Sony Walkman. Despite an ASP of more than three times the feature phone market, smartphones surpassed the peak feature phone market size less than 10 years after the iPhone launched. Apple Watch shipments today exceed the entire Swiss watch market. In other words, applying a market share figure to the current EV market forecast is likely to vastly underestimate the size of Apple’s car business in the future.”"
Really liking the Apple TSMC partnership to produce HQ AR devices.
"Since we reached the all time high - we’ve been red most days, 12 to be precise. Where we lost on average 2 dollars a day. We’ve had only 7 green days where we just gained on average a dollar. So yeah - gives up a dollar, takes back 2 dollars "
I won't buy this again - sold last week with no regrets - just too many better growth stocks to buy!
Board announces dividend increase !!!!!!
Price target mid $60s back to fair value
"Nasdaq crashed Huge, so did S&P at the end. This kind of delectable action I saw in March 2020."
"I have just finished work, as I was leaving I thought to myself what does my Brokerage account have in store for me today. Maybe this is the day we see my biggest holding bounce! And we are trading sideways "
Looks like a rough start. Buffett trimmed AAPL
Here we go! Finally a full Green Day!
"I am completely positive that this is only a temporary correction. Those who sold today and now have tons of cash in their bank accounts, what are they going to do with it? Buy 10-year treasuries for 1.5%? While all the moneyprinting is happening and will continue for months and possibly years? No way. They are going to go into stocks again once they think the market has bottomed out."
Opening above 135 tomorrow folks.
"Today could be turnaround day. Leave it to Wall St to schedule this on an unexpected, typically (manipulated) down day like Friday."
Put buyers have entered. They seem to disappear when the market is green though. Nancy already bought her calls I’m telling you all. Buy the calls folks. Buy the calls.
"They need to recover about half the shares it split. Everyone in their mother owns apple now. Supply and demand, no demand plenty of shares."
Hopefully by the grace of god I can buy shares tomorrow before this blows up mad I didn’t get in today
Apple is a great stock it will is over $150 by end of March. Go Apple.
Terrible stock. I feel like I’m wasting the opportunity to invest in something else.
Will AAPL see under $100 middle of March?
Apple tractor announcement needed asap
Until Apple ? makes an announcement on a car don?t believe any media outlets! It?s all #$%$ When Tim Cook is ready he will let us know.
"I mean the 1 year RSI did reach low 20,s just on 0 fundamentals change to the company was all based on premature bond yields."
Like clock work time for it to rebound and end the day higher today.
"market down for last few days, vaccines are here, stimulus coming, why down ?"
100% hedgies will cover sooner than retailers in premarket. 150 breakout is imminent . Having tsunami EPS/revenues is truth. Truth will prevail and reign. EXPECT AAPL 200 in Q1. Classic breakout a week after earnings. Machine learning said AAPL will break 150 this week. buy now
Don’t let emotions or fake news make you sell the number one company in the world. Apple may dip or fall but always comes back. Don’t say I shouldn’t have sold!
Remember to buy more and hold. hedgies game is dangerous . They will have to cover huge soon. Buy and steal their prey. The more u buy the more risky for them. SHORT SQUEEZE WIL COME...tic toc
$400 by December 2021. Please remember me when that happens. All pundits will be scrambling to take the credit. Give the credit to whom it is due
Looks like Dan Niles single handedly tanked the futures with his CNBC interview awhile ago. Bodes badly for today.
Down $5 dollars minimum today. This stock will never recover from these drops in a year.
"who ever thinks apple will not make its way back to 140's and beyond must be delusional,this company is not overvalued and once it decides to dominate the EV market it will be worth 3 TRILLION DOLLARS [in my Dr. e voice from austin powers :)]"
Holy! its gonna finish green!!
"Should Apple drop after earnings, I will be in line to buy more. Anyone else?"
"Something interesting and incomprehensible is happening with ""Apple"", these daysthese after the excellent report, the stock had to take off."
"This is the first time I bought 75% of my portfolio on a single stock, Apple. I had been told to diversify, but this seemed to be a no brainer. I had lost a lot of money buying Apple expensive and selling cheep, and this was supposed to be the perfect opportunity to balance the books. Am I going to the extreme by not being more conservative?"
"As an APPLE Long I have to wonder why my 2117 shares of APPLE@103 avg actually goes down again when things are bullish and my OTC stocks like TSNP/HUMBL shares @0.15 avg are now $1.07 and bullish??I LOVE APPLE but APPLE always has such a positive forward pipeline but no matter how great APPLE tech is we shareholders never get the predicted KABOOMS. Too many shares and the expected sell the Apple news makes for bored rich Longs to search for the next APPLE stock .BUT APPLE LONGS know that “The next APPLE “ will likely be from APPLE.. Lesson learned years ago, NEVER DOUBT OR SHORT APPLE EVER. Eventually Apple always make the bears pay for their APPLE short mistake. Time again for Aapl short to pay back LONGS every dime plus a couple $$ interest. Come on APPLE burn the short interest the hate APPLE SURPRISES.GREEN APPLE MONDAYLONG APPLE LONG LIQUIDMETAL LQMT"
$137. And we still have 3 full trading days till earnings
Yahoo finance “Tech stocks rebounded end of day........” meanwhile AAPL over here
It’s going into a buying frenzy can possibly open $127 to $128 or it will get there by 10 am
"I've been holding Apple for 20 years. This pattern is predictable:-) Stock runs up to big announcement-) Stock falls the day after big announcement-) Stock recovers within a short time (for me, even a year is a short time. YMMV)-) Stock overall performance is higherThus, anyone who recognizes this, and adds to their position the day after, is doing very very well. I still own 7000 shares I bought in December 2000. But over the years, I've added SIGNIFCANTLY MORE, during times like this. And I retired at age 45 (now 57). My only market talents are: Intelligence and Patience."
Shorts working hard to keep this price down! Let's squeeze them! It's going to run to $140...I'm Buying.
"Every day this week, the next day's intra day high was higher then previous day's close.Except for one day the spike was higher than $2"
"History is often a view into what is to come.Before earnings, it was posted many times that once in the past AAPL had great earnings yet because retail was heavily invested in call options the; markets took the stock down. Okay, this has happened.However, markets rallied the stock the following week. If so, this week should be a good one for the longs. Let's see if this happens. Good LuckMany puts were sold on Friday. This is also a good sign of a rally. But nothing is definiteEvery coin has two sides."
"Been an apple long for years. I think its time to trim, this company has stopped rewarding its longs. Better money seems elsewhere. I'm not selling all, but Im tired of being overweight in a co that does not reward for the sacrafice."
I guess from 140 to 122... 2$ more than im selling everything n shorting from 120 to 100 so I’ll break even
Looks like a Rough day ahead.....
"AAPL will be Tesla’s biggest competitor in the EV market. be patient, AAPL will dominate the future"
Apple will not go over 142 before Friday at 4 PM that’s option expiration those 142.00 calls will not be in the money. If you know anything about options.. Much good news this morning and did not affect the price going up. ￼142.00 a bunch of good news this morning it’s all about options expire Friday for Apple will Go. over 145 next week￼
I think a lot of our problems is because apple / Tim is very secretive about their future plans :/
Apple's Annual Shareholder's Meeting will kick off on February 23
Guys I know a lot of people don’t like hearing this but when the vaccine is fully out there will be a lot of unemployment which leads to huge dips so make sure you have a lot of cash on hand
We might see 130+ today... load up guys!
"institutions and funds are day trading now. You heard of softbank and Saudi Sovereign fund? They are cashing banks, energy and industrials propping up shares by 20-30% in the last 3/4 weeks. Retails are following them. But that would end badly as Nasdaq cannot be behind Dow for a long time. So, stop day trading big tech and go long to make money. Nasdaq is gearing up for big up days...just watch."
195 Billion in cash which will lose 10% in fiat currency deflation with another 3 trillion in M2 money supply being printed. Apple will lose 19.5 million of their fiat currency. Put it in bitcoin and Apple will gain 200% for the next 5 years and the share price will go up $300-$400 dollars. It’s a no brainer
Shorts and bears on this board being muted at record pace today
"Oh my God Fox News is reporting an upbeat report to shareholders from Warren Buffett. He is investing more in his company and is very very very bullish on America, Fox is predicting a great week ahead based upon this bullish report. Also Fox says bond is not the place to make money"
"strong balance sheet, great earnings, one of the best company, why is trading down makes no sense ."

"All you iCar fanboys need to come to the realization that the Federal Highway Administration will not have the research or legislation to allow self-autonomous vehicles on public roads in 2024. The Apple vehicle — if it comes to fruition — will be initially focused on short-haul transit on repetitive private thoroughfares like college or business campuses, parking shuttles, or warehouse material handling routes. You are not going to be owning an iCar in 2024."
A blooming APPLE a day keeps the shorts at bay. To my long holders of AAPL enjoy the journey and the best is yet to come.
Is there some kind of manipulation?
Will load up more on Monday. This whole GameStop sheet will end and everyone will buy Apple at a discount. Apple will run up to $150-$170 February
So the heads are telling you to sell big tech due to inflation concerns and buy leisure like airlines and hotels. Marriott and ALK air are at a higher SP than they were pre pandemic. You do the math!

"Earnings ""Blackout"" window during earnings reporting.It seems there is no SEC restriction but a company imposed one. Most companies impose a ten day window before and two day window after restricting stock buybacks. However, If a company has a established program there is no restrictions what so ever."
looking on the bright side ... could have dropped 8% like TSLA
Apple = Open for business from Maine to Miami from Seattle to San Diego. Business as usual across the USA. 
"Listen up, if we band together and start buying AAPL, we can turn it into another AMC or GME. Let's have a Yahoo's revolt on the shorties! Let's do it!"
"“ Robert Paul Leitao: In my brief reading, it looks like inflation fears spooked the market into the close. I’ll go back to a point I made earlier: As rates on virtually risk free instruments begin to rise, the opportunity costs of investing in equities also rise. There’s nothing “wrong” with Apple. It’s just no longer a momentum play (for now), there are no near-term catalysts for the stock (that are known at this time) ahead of March quarter results and it’s not an income stock. Great company, great long-term appreciation play, but not a COVID recovery play. Apple at times is an ATM for the market. With a market cap of over $2 trillion, it’s among the most liquid and easily tradable equities on Wall Street. Need cash for the glamour/momentum stock of the day? Sell Apple. But buy it back maybe later.”"

"Price target upgrades coming from everywhere, this is going to 200$ soon, very soon."
Apple stock is like a coiled snake . ready to spring up. People want to own Apple. America’s most iconic company. It’s Un-American not to own this stock. Historically all protracted lulls in the stock price have been followed by massive gains. Me thinks that’s what we are looking at here before a mad rush to $200 
Not a big fan/user of all the over-priced Apple products... but I LOVE this stock. My Apple gains paid me more this year than my actual job. Thank you Apple

"We'll, I was right to be conservative about Apple's share price movement, however I never expected the market to be in the dumper on the day Apple reported. It's not a big deal to me but I'm sure there are plenty of unhappy new Apple investors out there wondering why Apple stock is down on nearly perfect earnings. I'm guessing it's a market macro thing that just happens to include Apple and nothing directly due to Apple's fault. I've learned to live with this market weirdness and Apple has always risen above it. I have no idea when Apple will start to rise based on earnings, but I know it will eventually. Were Apple's numbers not good enough? I doubt that. Is there profit-taking going on? Maybe. I'm Apple-long so I'm not going to lose sleep over whatever is happening today or tomorrow. All the guessing of how much Apple was going up on earnings didn't quite work out for today. The future is too difficult to predict with any accuracy. I have to admit I didn't think Apple would drop on near perfect earnings, but that's just how things go. I'm not concerned about it and I'm going to happily look forward to tomorrow."
Nice little turn around today. Capitulation in the making?

"I know many of longs here are determined to hold AAPL for a long time. That's one valid way to make money in this game.So here's a strategy that will enhance that strategy.1. If you have 100 shares, sell them, say at $125.2. Wait until you think the market has settled down. Buy back 100 shares.3. If you buy back 100 shares at $110. You will have $1500 cash and the same 100 shares of AAPL.4. If AAPL starts moving up after you sell at $125, you can buy back your $100 shares at any time, like at $127 or even $130. Because you're a long-term investor, aiming for $150, $200, $250 (right?) a few dollars of loss shouldn't matter.You still have a few days to sell above $120. Waste no more time of just holding rain or shine.. (Don't listen to the shills who tell you not to sell ever. They are telling you to hold while their bosses are unlodaing quietly.)"
Why is Apple in talks with Kia and Hyundai? Why not partner with an American firm?

Stimulus is definitely coming. Vaccines are being given and we are full stream going upwards. and beloved Apple and etc. and etc. and etc. all them companies doing great. Thanko

My only thought on a vehicle that Apple may be involved in:Apple knows more about advanced and practical batteries than any other company in the world.
People that are saying apple is overvalued is a joke compared to other companies. Why aren’t you on Tesla or other companies who’s valuations are purely based on speculation of what’s yet to come. Yet apple is a company that is printing money and is a good play long term

I started to pull the trigger at $120.00 but had doubts.........after news coming out about iPhone 13 no more doubts. If she dips like that again I will but not very likely. 140 is probably the next stop and very soon.......
its going down because the market hates apple at this time and is selling to raise cash to buy back cheaper shares.. same game different year... get ready for a significant pullback.. 30-35% because tim cook never talks about his company. he would rather see his share price get hammered when the market corrects which it will. its too easy to manipulate the share price by the big boys. retail investors like us just have to buy dips and hold for the next move higher.

What company is a better company? PE is in 30's? Tesla is 1400. Appl is making more money than any company over 1 billion a day 7 days a week 365 days year. I'm not saying we should be 200$ but we will be heading higher shortly. It's a matter of time before we head higher and everyone starts to load up again. Good luck to all.
All bears are saying there is a market bubble all bulls are saying this will go to 300 within a year.Let’s be realistic here. Apple is a very safe investment for the long term and it will always be a great investment. Apple is adapting to the new market coming out with a ev car that will compete with Tesla and have a similar run.Apples financials are amazing and people will always be buying Apple for retirement and will be buying their new products in the future. Invest in the long term and you will be happy
I'll be happy was a $2 increase in stock price this week. Slow and steady wins the race.
Apple is so oversold. Whoever is selling or shorting is gonna get hurt badly 
Coming up 130 ...don’t listen to shorties ...red days are gone ...this is one time opportunity to buy at this price ...150 next month !!
Apple is outperforming all other FAANG today - still way oversold. Resistance at 130.

"AAPL is an option-driven stock—which means writers are banking on the long interest to produce a steady income leveraging their huge position—a position they’ll never close (they cannot—biggest company in the world), so they care less if pps rallies uncontrollably like TSLA—in fact it’s not in their best interest. What AAPL needs to go up is for short interest to overtake"
"All of us need to come together and buy the hell out of AAPL. Buy atleast 10 shares a piece is all I am saying. If someone owes you a favor, have them buy AAPL. Even if we could collectively buy about 5000 shares, we’ll keep the tanking at bay and lose less if not make more on our calls."
Made all my losses back from last week plus more already! Told you keep buying those dips it’ll make us rich!
I come home from a day trip to Baltimore only to find AAPL up over 7 bucks.... YIPPEE !

$GOEV wasn't about $AAPL until people made it about $AAPL. The $30 price target was in place long before the Apple partnership talk story broke. Now all of a sudden the Hyundai deal isn't enough any more? The Canoo story isn't about $AAPL. It's one of the few companies that has a sizeable B2B business alongside an extensive consumer EV platform. At best $AAPL would be the cherry on top down the road. My lesson was to buy the dips and hold.
"Apple's performance in the latest quarter showed strength in all product categories. The recent release of the 5G-enabled iPhone 12 family led to a 17% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales. Likewise, Apple's latest M1-powered MacBook models caused Mac sales to surge 21% year over year. And services revenue jumped 24% year over year, driven by strength in App Store sales, advertising, and cloud services. For more hot stocks like (AAPL) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."

"Just remember, the minimum wage up here in Canada is already $14/hr. Has that made it easy for people to afford rent and everything? No! It is just more paper in the economy.

"Have to repost this accusation of Rod Hall and Goldman of double-dealing:“His commentary is so absurd, so asinine, so ill-informed in the face of the facts that there has to be something more than a rogue analysts being given a long leash.Goldman may be covering themselves through arbitrage and hedging by making a market for Apple, handling their bond sales, acting in an advisory capacity and trying, as usual, to suck the blood out of both ends of the body too quickly.”"
PRESIDENT DAY HOLDAY IS COMING MONDAY. THIS WEEK IS SHOPPING SPREE FOR APPLE PRODUCTS. I will buy at the opening tomorrow. Classic breakout at earning date level 142-145 tomorrow. Expect 150 tomorrow. I will buy more for sure. Waiting for more money to be wired.

"Apple bought back $27B in stock in the recent December quarter. Imagine if Apple had spent half that amount on video content. Apple+ probably wouldn't be sitting near the bottom of the SVOD heap. It's just hard for me to understand why Apple isn't spending more on video content when they can clearly afford it. Does Apple actually want to compete with Netflix or is Apple only willing to put up a half-hearted attempt in the SVOD market. With the high number of active devices Apple has, they need to make their Services more attractive to subscribers and turn AppleTV into a high-end streaming device. I know Apple is committed to buybacks but they need to consider other productive alternatives of getting investor interest. The SVOD market is hot. "
Buybacks buybacks and more buybacks....go Apple!
This is just a blip in AAPL:'s history By years end you'll look back and wish you bought more
Apple  will be $200 again! You just have to hold and wait. History won’t change for this company.

I don't understand till this day. How is that a millionaire/biliionaire can come on TV and tell the world that they are selling their shares. That creates a selling pressure especially if your name is well know. This should be illegal.

"It quite simple some companies like aapl ,msft, V ,MA if you look at there lifetime chart they always have revisited there 52 high , why you might ask it’s because of fundamentals.Not saying a 50% drop isn’t possible on any stock or the entire market for that matter.But if that does happen guess what these companies got the cash to buyback a whole lot of shares at discount....."

Stock should be 127 rn based on that bs drop on Friday.

"Added more this week , they are called growth stocks for a reason . Apple is the definition of that & will continue to grow over time .it will out perform many of these so called value stocks that are benefiting from a temporary rotation in asset allocation."
Sad that a company like GME that was about bankrupt just matched Apple share price again. Manipulation at its finest.
Just bought some more. Have no idea why we've just been bumping along the bottom since earnings....
Longs don’t sweat pullbacks. It’s just an opportunity for Apple to buy back more shares on the cheap.
Based on 27 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Apple in the last 3 months. The average price target is $150.52 with a high forecast of $175.00 and a low forecast of $80.00. The average price target represents a 12.04% increase from the last price of $134.35.
Buy buy buy Apple to $160 by May
I am hoping this stays around even going into earnings because they will crush expectations. I am looking for at least 5%-6% gain when earnings are announced!!
"This day hurt. But I think the worst is over. I think we hit the low. If it was gonna tank to 125 or 120, today would’ve been the day to do it and it didn’t happen."

"Everyone, shut up the stock will come back. I have my life savings in this company and get angry about the past performance as well. It's the market, too many other distractions, Tesla boom, Bitcoin and all the get rich quick schemes. They will pass and when they do Apple will be the eye of their eye. It will. Stick with basics, good earning, plenty of money and great products year after year. It all comes down to that."
"Appl TV would get a huge boost buying CBSVIACOM There whole TV Movie Division would compete with best. Then there would be a stock Spin off separate from Apple Tech.Apple would own maybe 50 to 65cstock ownership. CBSVIACOM is a,huge Asset. to Apple."
"Waiting on my target price so that I can buy a few more shares. Apple is a great company and these purchases are for my son. The dividend is ok, but I'm mainly excited about stock appreciation per share; big investors who hold a huge amount of shares rely on the dividend but I'm a middle class so my lesson to my son is apreciation. Have a good one everyone."
"Yesterday morning on the bell I sold half of my aapl shares after 9 years. I'm sorry whoever invest in this 6 months ago today is going in red. If you invested in Tesla on the same time you would be already doubled your money. We are now in a new decade and investors will find something new to invest. Apple is done. This stock was great from 2010 to 2020.This is not volatility, this is bleeding slowly, on green market days 1% down, on red market days 2% down."
"This is ALL options related, pure and simple!"
"All I can say is wow. All weekend I was excited thinking this week is the week and I just now looked at the share price. I was expecting green and up maybe 1-3%. NOPE. It’s Aapl we’re talking about. It’s red and down a quarter %. But wait guys, I know, in 10 years, I’ll be thankful and most likely dead."

Could some of the posters here at least take a glance at the fundamentals of this company before saying ridiculous things like “this is going to $500” or “a short squeeze is coming”At $500 a share it would have a market cap of OVER 8 TRILLION DOLLARS.

"Currently, Market is ignoring Apple's business achievements. When it takes notice of it, the stock will rise."
Last time AAPL seen RSI under 30 was when market tank in March last year. What a buying opportunity this presented to us!
Don't understand how the whole market can dump 25% in the span of 10 minutes. How is it even possible to coordinate that?
Apple does not do well in February. Upgrades will start in March for the 1st quarter.Expect consolidation in march and retest of the highs in April/May.
"Could it be any more obvious that there was manipulation DURING the session when algos run, when AAPL takes off AH?"
"Pleasant finish to the day. Did not see this coming. I really don't care what tomorrow brings. The past two weeks we've seen glimpses of the potential of aapl. Next week it will be fully unleashed. FYI, my unleashed means a gradual climb. If you want 10% days you are invested in the wrong stock. Congrats to all with the patience to realize gains."
AAPL is overdue for a $3 to $5 up day from these levels. Have not seen this much red in AAPL in a long time especially after the best earnings and revenues EVER!!!

Let’s not forget we just had the best earnings in history! History! Multiple analysts have raised price targets once again! Glad I bought on the dip last week and May also add to my position on Monday depending upon how fast the share price rises!￼"
"I think AAPL should partner with NIO. They are already a leading EV company in China. They do not have any marketshare in USA. Apple can totally bring them to USA from which NIO can benefit, while Apple can brand it and make it compatible with all Apple devices and integrations., I think it will be a WIN WIN situation for both companies and can bring a great competition to TSLA."
And why is this down 4% on top of the 4% yesterday?
The only sad part is with all the dips and averaging down a million times...you won't have any money for when it reaches 2 bucs...
Wow how many will upgrade their iPhones when they get $1400?

"ALL 3 Indexes (DOW, NASDAQ, S & P) futures are up nicely ! Since Apple is included in all 3, it could be Apple having significant influence on all 3. I think it is likely. Stepping up buybacks, in all likely increasing dividends and the large institutions that had to cover their Reddit facilitated ""Short Attack' by selling some Apple positions should be returning very soon. Maybe as soon as, beginning tommorow. I am very bullish on Apple right now.  Apple Long & Strong  !"
game stop is the safest stock to own during this violent pullback. it will make new highs soon. up 58 percent today.
"its not the stock splits....funds are dumping anything close to 1T valuation. So, I guess a break up is what we need to sustain the value. Funds are chasing 50-100B companies for a higher valuation in 5-10 years. They think all big techs are capped sort of. All big tech can do $100B buyback each and buy all weak hands. 17B shares are just too much compared to 100 mil daily trade."
They better be buying back shares
last chance to buy before tommorow
Has Apple found some support here?
"long time shareholder and watcher-think only thing to move the needle right now is bitcoin acceptance!! Strange that AAPL needs a catalyst, always moved on its own merits but now it seems price is going nowhere without one."

I’m tired of stocksMoving on hype instead of fundamental. I’m long apple and will collect these divs until it does something.
Getting out @ $120+ is still way better than $50 when this Bubble is busting completely. Save your yourself from this biggest bear market of the generation before too late !
Desperate Apple may have to start buying more of their own stock - just no light at the end of this hole - much smoke and mirrors though! I wouldn't be surprised to see $110 soon!
"Buy more its going green and when it goes people are coming, this money invested is real. TESLA will work too out if Elon doesn't get into trouble."

Keep in mind that AAPL solid profit Q over Q , Fiscal year over FY is your core, your backbone of calmness and confidence. Apple rocks! in product and service.

This selloff has gotten really out of hand and not 1 peep out of this dope Cook.
Bought 50 share of Apple first time I just have to be a part of a Trillion Dollar company 
Apple dropped 37% 2x in the last 3 years . But now the PE is highest since 2007. Bag holders stand ready
"I bought:2,016 shares at .43 cents in Oct 20034,060 share at $1.81 Sept 20051,680 shares $3.13 Dec 2006(...all adjusted for splits)I haven’t been able to buy anymore since 2006 BUT I have let all my dividends reinvest giving me a cost basis of $6.46 a share that currently totals 9,002 shares. My Apple stock is currently at $approx. $1,113,500 ANDMy total profit to date on my Apple stock is currently $1,055,487! That’s 1,816.39%Needless to say I’ve see A LOT of big swings in the price of my stock and many many times I’ve had family and friends tell me I was crazy to hold onto it but now I’m the millionaire and they are still are chasing day trades to catch up. Morale of my story is buy and hold for the long term...you won’t regret it."
"I’m just not gonna feel good anymore heading into the close. Even if Apple is up 10 dollars with 2 minutes to go, I know the powers that be are perfectly capable of taking it away. EFFF THEM!"
The stock got ahead of itself and the P/E is still to high. This isn’t a ultra high growth stock and typically trades on fundamentals. That’s the facts. The P/E will come down with the next earnings report. Just hold on until then
"Question, sell $AAPL calls tomorrow or keep them a little longer?"

"Why SENS will dominate DEXCOM AND ABBOTT CGM in 3 to 5 years!CGM market is still in infancy. DXCOM, Abbott, Medtronic and Roche only grabbed <10% of CGM market today; the total number of possible diabetics who needs this device are enormous. More and more insurance companies are buying into importance of CGM capabilities in reducing medical complications. The total costs related to diabetes costs just in America annually is Hundreds of billions of dollars each year. It’s much cheaper for insurance companies to pay upfront fees to get CGM implanted then pay for treatments for leg amputations, diabetes blindness, end stage kidney failures, cardiac complications secondary to untreated diabetes. There are many more conditions causing billions of dollars in Medicare due to uncontrolled diabetes. CGM device is literally life savers for millions of people around the world. Currently there is vast untapped markets for both internal and external CGMs in India, China, Middle East, Far East, South America. CGM growth will be exponential over the next decades. Lastly, Medicare will be paying Providers almost twice more to implant Eversense CGM then Dexcom CGM. Main reasons for this? It cheaper in the long run to implant Eversense CGM. Dexcom requires very expensive external sensors changing out every 7 to 10 days. Eversense CGM, no sensor change needed during lifetime of Eversense implant. Great bargain compare to Dexcom G6 or Abbott Libre"

"Should have dumped last week, now this is clearly heading to $100-$110 range next week and lower as time goes on."
Theres alot of posts here from older investors. Their not lying. This stock is the real thing if your younger buy n tuck away. Accumulate. It splits every so many yrs. thats where the money is made.

Growing tired of the mindless drones repeating the apple carcheers. Why car and not refrigerators or washing machinesor electronic back scratchers orprogrammable vibrators?I’ve done real well with AAPL so far with what they’re doing and hope that the future is going to be not worse than the past and the business and planning should be left to those whose job calls for it.

"This is a good buying opportunity, a strong support is being formed here following a dip after historical earnings. Plus apple took this opportunity to sell bonds and buy back shares. This I going to climb steadily from this point forward."

"Apple has reportedly begun talking to suppliers of lidar self-driving car sensors, as part of its effort to build an electric vehicle, according to Bloomberg. Common on many self-driving vehicles and prototypes, lidar sensors are used to determine the vehicle's distance from objects, people, and other vehicles. The technology also is used for other tech, including a few iPhone models. Apple was talking with several lidar suppliers working on next-gen hardware, according to Bloomberg. The report also said Apple has developed in-house much of the software needed for self-driving vehicles. But a vehicle launch may be at least five years away, Bloomberg reported, citing internal Apple sources. In recent weeks and months, reports have also claimed Apple was in talks with several car manufacturers about building Apple-branded vehicles."
"Yep, I am buying AAPL with all my margin power tomorrow . Time to squeeze shorties . Q4 was huge and still under this price???come on!!. Shorties will pay the price for playing with the price tomorrow. Any dip during intraday I am buying more and holding. AAPL 200 is coming , I know that 2021 is a bullish year. Especially Stimulus 3 is coming, it will boost revenues higher than before $3,600 per child, that's a lot to buy on apple products"

"With Buffet selling AAPL and Ark Invest continued selling as recently as Friday 2/26, they both agreed that current price can still go down. The plunge on Friday at the end of the day tells you where this is going next week. The current trend is downward and can fall to $95-$105, but long term (in 5-10 years) AAPL will remain the flagship of all tech products and will continue to trend up. However, I do believe that in order for AAPL to go from $2T to $4T, they will need a new product category (cars, VR headset?) which could still be years away."
I am buying with margin and holding for the whole year. Shorties will cover soon ...MONDAY pre-Market will open 135-140 range

"AS I read this board, all I hear is ""options"".Maybe this is my fault, discussing 1000% returns in four days. 100% everyday.As the board historian, let me share my experiences with AAPL, Many times, AAPL can go up or down in price yet both the calls and puts fall in value. Why? The premium erodes once the earnings are released.ALso, when everyone is on the same side of the trade the markets kill the action. One time , earnings were great yet the market postponed the rally until the calls expired for the next week.As posted last night, After today's am rally, you may want to sell half of your position to pocket yo recover principle and some profits.Yes, we did post Investors have the filed until AFTER earnings. But this is an entire different subject"

"Oh, I’m here. I told you what would happen today. You are dealing in RIGGED markets. Apple has been doing this late slide for 7 MONTHS NOW. 7. Systematic!! Daily."
Cancel your sell orders for a week and watch this going to $150 100%
All Apple stores are now open in this country and people are still going to short the stock?
how Apple went from 127 to 145 after MLK weekend? get ready for a repeat next week!
It could reach $200 by end of this year!!!

AAPL is a little sleepy today.
Friday $150!!
I’m lmao at some of the people who post on this feed ! It looks like the Buy high and Sell low mentality is very much alive amongst Apple investors If you are in the Red just wait ! 
"The more the shorts get excited and post more frequently, the more I know AAPL is trading at a discount and it's time to buy some more! I love all my Apple stuff, including my iPhone 12 Pro Max I just got. And, an Apple Car in the future sounds awesome to me. I bought in at $142, and am patiently waiting for this to get back up there. It may be time for me to average down and buy some more!"
"When will Rod Hall admit he was wrong, very wrong?"
"$132 is the new 50 day moving average.Stock price must get back over this. Ideally, $135 is the line in the sand"
"Apple P/e 35. Tesla P/E 1247. YEah.......you do you, I'll do flight to Apple."
Just doubled my AAPL position again! Keep lowering my cost basis. Looking forward for the nice climb up that I think this is overdue for. Good luck all!
I requested wire to be transfer tomorrow. I want to buy more AAPL at 10.00ET. banker said usually money arrived in morning . I hope I can buy before 150 breakout. AMZN was upgraded to 4000 and stocks is following AAPL pattern . Machine learning said after earnings usually takes few days to break a new high before earning date. AAPL will break 150 ...no question.
Do people realize by pumping up a $5.00 stock to hundreds will only hurt a company to access future capital. No fundamentals have changed for Nokia according to executives within the company. This needs to stop. The SEC Needs to halt all stocks that are being played with for 30 days while implementing new trading laws for hedge funds.
I'm disappointed apple hasn't blown up after earnings but i'm sure it will go up through the quarter like it always does!
Anyone have a good explanation of the huge dip in the market this morning?
Apple is being dragged down with all the overvalued tech stocks even though Apple is not overvalued
Hold people...don’t understand people selling after a slight upward trend
Apple should be valued at 1500 PE as it is an electric car company.
Did anyone see Rick Santelli on CNBC just now? did you notice his right eye and the shape pf his mouth? looked like he had a stroke.
margin calls from record margin creating ever more forced sales
"all these tech stocks were pumped during pandemic so it's time sovereign funds will pull out, watch out."
Big Div increase announcedHere we go
Dow fair value plus 237 points . Nasdaq fair value plus 87 points
"Love to see AAPL go into the EV auto sector. Apply their technology and transform transportation,be it personal or business. Transform our cars to the next generation,better than the star ship Enterprise."
Looks like it will finish down around $1.50 or down around $3. Day traders are tugging up and back.
130.00 USD was the bottom. Now up up up!
"Low volume, no buyers. It's not a sell off, this is a stand off."
Warren has made over 2billions on dividend. tell me now that aapl isn't a buy?
"Inflated Bubble is completely Collapsing, Sub-100 will be here very soon."
big buying day coming up we have seen the bottom
There has got to be something wrong with you if you do not know to buy AAPL at this price.
When your cost average is $112 and your long!!￼
Just heard Warren Buffet is dumping $PFE $AAPL $GM $JPM
This has been consolidating since its split and high around August. It touched a new ATH not long ago and soon that will become new support above $138.00 with a market cap above $2.3T. PT at $150-$160 market cap of $2.5T-2.7T for 2021. (This does not factor buybacks of stock) which is a positive for bulls!
"ARK is unloading aapl at breakneck speed. Another 116,653. Not liking our prospects."
"buy now. Hedgies are covering . Expect Moday huge pop. 145 or maybe 150 fresh start...load up now, Use margin if possible. Let's squeeze out all shorties"
"Yikes, 8 months ago AAPL was $129 ..."
"Almost 20% higher er than analysts consensus, great job apple "
I think AAPL stock will be 147$ very soon
Inflation is bad for companies that can’t quickly pass on inflated prices to the consumer....does that sound like Apple to you? Also...stocks are assets...what happens to assets when inflation kicks in? Currencies devalue against them... treading water a lot better than holding dollars and drowning:
"Many overthinking things here... blowout earnings, vaccines, and stimulus all are bullish signs for apple and the stock market I do think the market is over priced however short-mid term I see it only going up just look at futures today... Apple will continue printing money recent sell off means nothing other than a buying opportunity ."
Of course Buffet sold Apple. He had to . He had major losses in the airline industry .. so he had to sell his most profitable position so his share holders wouldn’t lose . He just took some profit .. like everyone does. Sell your shares and walk away. Have a great day . The rest of the smart money will stay and hold. We will be just fine
"It's Apple stock that saved Berkshire and Buffett. They sold airlines and bank stocks at low prices, missed out on the recovery. But they held on to Apple. Now they are making the mistake of reducing Apple position."
"#GHVI flying to $$$ #CCIV, #EXPI, #TSLA, #AAPL"
"Green Day’s going forwards, not the band!"
"Wallstreet shorting apple on the news is typical. I hope wallstreetbets army make them pay by buying apple. If then Robinhood bans apple trading, they are in a big trouble."
"Another $2-$3 gain coming tomorrow, up and up until earnings and then BOOM!!!"
So much of market prices for stock is about sentiment. Increased earnings over time change the sentiment and the price goes up but it's hard to know which is the driver of the I believe Apple is trading at some of the highest multiples that it ever has currently. If it is due for a pause in the increased price then it doesn't mean you should worry it will eventually consolidate and then go up again. Relax and be patient.
Apple in another consolidating pattern. Breaking out above $137 will be from a triple resistance. $160 by end of Feb likely.
"oversold by a large margin, look at the technicals. good time to buy. NASDAQ won't keep falling like this"
If apples down tomorrow no big deal. Sometime before the weekend will see $130
"If you are not in $AMC by now you are missing Golden opportunity, we will not stop till squeeze happens. If you don't believe watch."
"Fisker's Market Cap is only 4 billion.. AAPL could easily buy it and improve it. If AAPL partners with an Automaker, that Automaker will be AAPL's competition as well... that makes no sense to me. Only concern with Fisker is the lack of information we have on their technology. Lucid would likely be a better buy but will they sell to AAPL?"
"I bought into AAPL at $142, bought more at $136, and then doubled my position at $132. Don’t miss today’s buying opportunity if you can at this awesome price around $130. I wish I had more money free to get more, but I don’t right now or I’d be buying some more today. Good luck all!"
today's 13f filings will show Buffett sold more than expected. he is selling every quarter now.
Apple will bounce tomorrow ! $145 by noon Bullish!
"Apples second quarter of 2021 will never match the second quarter of 2020! This dog can’t even get to $150 after massive holiday earnings! Why? Cook has nothing left! No colors, sizes, 5 g has come and will be old news after current quarter ends! 200 billion doing nothing! Cooks has no Successor which is honestly needed badly at this point! No Innovation!"
Back making coin boys. Good day Apple!
Call options are growing. This is going to be great time to buy and capture some cheaper shares.
To $145 here we come
Will close green. Apple is the place to be! See you at 150 in the ides of March!
Slowly but surely will get up over 150.
"Between 9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down at one point (44.4%) down on 4/9/13. from its all time high Steve Jobs had just died in October 2011 and Tim Cook had taken over the jobs a few months prior. Apple would not recover until Apple announced the 7 for 1 stock split in June 2014. Conclusion: Apple ran after the stock split and those who were patient were rewarded. Apple's stock gain during 2014 was 37.72%Between 2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down (32.1%) from its all time high on 5/12/2016. Conclusion: Apple started to run in the beginning parts of 2017 and rewarded stock holders with a huge 46.11% return by the end of 2017.Between 10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, Apple was down from its all time high and at one point during late December 2018 was down (38.7%).Conclusion: Those who hung on saw an epic 86.16% return in 2019.Between 2/10/2020 to about 3/16/2020, 36 days, Apple was down 31% from its all time high. The world was in panic over COVID. Then the first first stimulus came 3/23/20 and Apple recovered.Conclusion: Those who were patient were rewarded with an outstanding 82% return of Apple is 2020."
"Sell, all the way to $77.03."
MasterCard is up almost $11 and they reported $1.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Apple reported $111 billion in the stock is down. I don’t know about you but this doesn’t make any sense to me￼￼￼
Haaaa back into the $140s. Longs it’s all good. Apple  shows how strong it is.
"If you can do the match calculating the compound increase e.g. 115% ^ 20, you should know you will do well in the future by buying and holding. The strategy of making money quick just doesn’t exist. But long-term compounding increase is far more powerful."
People are selling before the weekend so they can buy higher on Monday. Makes no sense.
Have a great weekend. Stay Safe
Could investors get a special dividend? Apple  has lots of cash to reward us long term holders
"I'm in today, first time, bought 40 shares,. This is a solid investment, no doubt."
Don’t get stressed about this pullback people. It’s not the End of the world it’s a chance to buy some cheap shares ! I know the red is frustrating but despite what the conspiracy theorist on this page say it will turn around !
"100% AAPL will break 130 today. AMZN is leading. Sentiment is huge. Pretty sure this game from smart money will give up very soon. EPS/revenues were huge in Q3, Q4. No reason this low but games from hedgies. Well, they will be punihsed very soon. Due to who cover first. They will fight like a dog who cover and buy..buy in advance and watch a movie. But you gotta buy more"
Don't worry Warren stock will suffer tomorrow. Airlines and Cruise Lines are not ready for people people still won't travel. It will be years before they get to par. I'm hoping to stick with Apple but tomorrow will be the tell all.
132 easy today had we not got the last minutes hiccups on Friday!!!
Why is the market down?
Will be an up day today
"I see a lot of Hyundai and Kias around where I live. I could see an Apple car doing well, and taking a portion of the market. Interestingly, I think this news means even more potential shortages of chips for these vehicles as manufacturing can't keep up."
Apple stores moving into target!!! Incredible company!!!
apple has only 11% of China phone market and dropping
FRIDAY 117.00
How is it that airlines report record losses and they are up 5%. And Apple reports record numbers and it drops?
130 maybe today. lol shortie cover
I am accumulating as I said. Good price I bought. I am not selling. I am buying at any 0.25 cents pulls. AAPL will pop above 150 eventually. Q1 is 200 at least. Buy more and accumulate
BIDEN PRESIDENT = 40% CRASH IN THE STOCK MARKET
Going up ?To the moon and beyond !
Hedge funds buying in heavy on Apple right now
Buffet probably learnt a lesson that trimming such a small amount from such a huge holding is actually more harmful to BH’s portfolio value (negative reaction to news and AAPL shares decline).
"Simple explanation.Algorithim players attempted to rally stock but had no luck.So, they will be content playing mini ""V"" like today.Earlier $135.54 to $133.71 back to $135.41 then late day dip for tomorrow set up.HIstorically AaPL could tread water for four to six weeks"
"My bought NIO for the first time today on a red day. First time playing with stocks.I bought 100 NIO, 2 $tsla and 50$pltr...and yes 30 $aapl.Wish me luck, I need it. Using my school loan money.I am looking at $gme..any recommendation?I have 500 dollars left."
"A low volume short cover assisted pump job. A pre-split stock price increase of $24 per share on zero news? Interesting, lookout below."
"Alert to my 39 mil customers. We will drive AAPl stock up tomorrow , bucking any downtrend in the Nasdaq or Dow Jones. Let's do it"
any prediction for tomorrow?
"well, sold about 20 percent of my apple last few weeks. glad I did"
I was surprised to see this down again today especially inlight of their supplier SWKS results last night. Market is impossible to predict as logic never seems to prevail but like they said earlier on CNBC the analysts all raised targets ahead of earnings instead of waiting for results which drove it up ahead of the release. This won’t stay down long however. 111 bil revenues? Unheard of!
"To be honest, I hate AAPL and Cook, and tech in general but it does seem to me that this stock is due for a rebound from here."
Isn’t It amazing how quickly the market goes from worrying about deflation to worrying about inflation?
140$ coming right up!
3 more hours to Run Before Another wave of Tech Bubble 2.0 Crash. 1 more day of Bag-holding= 1 more day of suffering for your Wallet.
"I can feel a breakout coming. People that bought in the $140s and you feel bad don’t! Please hold. Look to the future, look at apples chart history"
"Who bought the dip under 120 congrats, who missed it u wont ever see again this stock under 120."
Moon?
Can anyone help I’m with Charles Schwab and I own Apple stock and they have raised the margin equity to 60% which on Apple is crazy it has always been 30%. Does anyone know where I can go to buy Apple and keep my margin account at 30%. Schwab has never increased the margin rate to 60% on Apple which is very high. Thanks for any insight
"With the release of strong earnings, I have added Apple to my portfolio. Any price under $130 deserves incremental share purchases, with a 12 month target of $160."
Mr B! anything else!?
No none saw this coming. No Apple long saw this coming. Not even close. Looking like sub $120 tomorrow. If I said this on earnings day...the laughter would have been hysterical.
"Lets all follow Cathy....Sell $aapl, $fb and buy $pltr... To the $30 by Friday. Best case scenario, $30 by end of Monday."
"Mass Dumping into Close, Tomorrow and rest of the week will only be Worse, never Bag-hold a severely inflated bubble."
"Also month end investments for 401k, 403b, IRA, deferred compensation plans, tuition withholding will start taking place today because of a short month. All that goes into the market. Billions upon billions of dollars . I was notified mine was coming out of my account today. Also Fidelity mentioned an increase of over 19% in new accounts openings in 2021. Which means more people are investing for the future"
At some point the government will stop printing money and the market will need to survive on it's fundamentals.
what does Tesla do when Apple begins selling a self driving electric car with Hyundai vertical integration and apple tech?
Dang expected to wake up seeing $145. It’s all good we’re going to eat today
Falling Apart Again.
Why does everyone assume Apple is going to make a car? Maybe they just want to sell the software experience total package regardless of what brand you buy. Makes way more business sense strategically! Think different
"Jeff Bezos, founder, chairman, CEO, and president of Amazon is the richest man in the world. Once in a meeting with Warren Buffett, he asked America’s most prolific investor, your investment thesis is so simple. You’re the second richest guy in the world, and it’s so simple. Why doesn’t everyone just copy you?” Warren Buffett responded Jeff by saying, “Because nobody wants to get rich slow.”"
Futures rising nicely and I smell money !Ahhhhhhhh !
"I hold shares but when it comes to ev's I have to wonder how do phone manufacturers think they can become auto manufacturers? sorry, just doesn't make any sense."
"It's pretty simple. Buy and hold this best brand in the world, sit back and relax! Don't let the market ups & downs bother you unnecessarily. If you want quick profits, go and risk it all with GME, AMC and etc.Tim Cook reminded the world last night (once again) that even with the blow out quarter, there's so much market share that AAPL can tap into in addition to new products in the works. Just look at AAPL's stock chart for the last 5-10 years. Don't listen to all these short term naysayers that are just trying to #$%$ out so that they can make a quick buck. They probably accessed this board on their Apple device. :-)"
"Down 10 out of the last 12 trading days, today will make it 11 out of 13 . Sad !"
"Market is a mess but once it finds its support, AAPL will be back up and reaching for $150 this year. When has AAPL stock ever failed us??? NEVER and it’s not about to this year. $150 in 2021. Mark my words"
"Looks like March is going to be big for stocks with many catalyst like stimulus, chips deal, more vaccines, oils stabilized"
AAPL is going to the moon.
AAPL at this price is a long term discount. I'm a believer.
"Apple incorporating features in their watch where it can detect your blood pressure by just putting your finger, they are going big in medicare."
It’s rising
I added more to my Apple holdings at 142 close to the all time high. It's yielding much more than the average bank/broker money market and I feel confident that it will more than keep up with inflation.
"I am Resigned to the fact that AAPL is not performing as expected. I am just about on the thread of letting go but my instinct tells me to hold on a bit longer. We are retirees and AAPL is a major holding. Still ahead, hopefully my instinct is on the right track. Good luck to all."
I just couldn't hold my hands and keep adding on dips ....This is golden chance guys...
Seems like more money may be headed into APPL products and services I believe https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/house-democrats-aim-to-pass-1point9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-on-friday.html
Dow turned positive and S &P and Nasdaq will follow suit . I am sure Apple will end higher
Turns green in few minutes
With Apple Quickly bouncing off the 118 this is a good Sign! ￼Hopefully this correction is Over! The only good thing about this correction is Cook got to buy back shares cheaper.
If we close green today - $130 + is coming sooner than except!!
Going to hit $130 tomorrow people
"Well, as much I think the last 2 weeks of trading have been pure nonesense for AAPL (they should be 140$+ after those bomb earnings and EV development), looking at the 6 month chart shows AAPL is doing just fine as always haha, long forever!"
MSFT reporting day before AAPL along with FB reporting the same day as Apple could create a magnificent psychological synergy that will invigorate the price action post earnings maybe into next week. Could AAPL be having an 8 day winning streak like TSLA?
AAPL shorts better cover by Friday or have the dividend substracted from their stock accounts.
"Will they call it ""Joe's Fresh Market Crash"" when all the dust settles after the carnage and the massive losses in personal net worth are calculated?"
Why is the market down anyway?
128 open for tomorrow!
Unreal
Meanwhile AAPL 5G super cycle has just started and new Iphone 13 release in the fall
I bought AAPL for $700 a share in 2012. That was the peak and it dropped 40%. It did not return to $700 for 2 years. 2 years of waiting to break even! I wish I didn't sell those shares. Now the same share (a little over 8 years later) has split to be worth $3375. I regret my impatience now.
"This stock has more power than this, it's the best on the Market. Wait till this thing does boom, and when it does it will be worth the while."
"futures being green tells alot, same for NASDAQ being green. might see apple green"
"Saying Apple is just a cell phone company is like saying Tesla is just an auto company. I own Apple but not TSLA as they are profitable, growing and innovative. Tesla is innovative but the valuation is hard to stomach. GL"
This is a $200.00 stock.
"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. sold $14 billion of bonds to take advantage of cheap borrowing costs, tapping the market for a third time since May as it looks to return more cash to shareholders."
You guys are pretty funny with the Uber hyperventilating routine. Buffet’s stake in Apple doubles in a year...he takes a measly 6% off to rebalance and that gets spun into the crash is here? Where were you “this is the Enders” when Cathie wood scraped her Tesla trades to rebalance?
"Apple will beat Tesla in the fully autonomous car race. And like everything Apple makes, it will be first class."
Intense selling for a month now and AAPL looks very oversold.... expect snap back rally very soon...
"Nasdaq Composite is skyrocketing again, Despite Terrible $TSLA and $AAPL earnings."
"No worries everyone, let it come in, Buffett lightened up some, but understood with steepening yield curve big money is lowering the multiples. We had a great run up in 2020 and expected some retrenchment in the high 120's low 130's. Be patient. GL"
I’m holding for ten years today won’t matter - will be back at 200 before you know it .Long and strong !!! Ups and downs apple always wins .
Anyone here know anyone who bought an AAPL product in Q4?Anyone here know anyone planning to buy an AAPL product in Q1?
A lot of sell the news post earnings shorts still hanging in there....that squeeze is building....
Guys.. I am a prime example of why you should invest in apple. I use Samsung phones and apple products for various reasons.. And by far Apple is the superior product.. This company is as strong as any company you will ever invest in.This is not a GE or a blackberry or GM.
It’s interesting how people are posting negative comments  I’m sure they’re not even listening to what’s going on at the shareholder meeting right now :/
Too many misguided investors are buying poor performance companies and drive price way up. Here is the winner with quality and tomorrow we see $170.
"I am selling most of my AAPL, so hold, it will probably go up as soon as I sell."
Let's do 140+ today. Apple is unstoppable! GLTA!
Who just dumped 30 million shares of aapl? What a huge vote of confidence.
"Splitting a stock adds no value whatsoever. All it does is give the false impression the stock is now “cheap.” By any metric, this stock is NOT cheap. It will probably trade sideways until it runs up before the next earnings report"
I haven’t felt this depressed in a long time :/
All technical indicators leading up to today screamed massively oversold. Target is 130 ish to hit new support. Breaking through that would be mid 130s. Target for a bit longer time frame is 159 based on the previous wedge we saw. My only regret is I didn’t have more cash when it went really low!
"the thing is, doesn't yield/inflation affect consumer goods companies and real estate more? when your interest rate go up, less people can afford to buy houses from loans and goods are too expensive which cuts at these consumer goods, yet tech goes down? so illogical. in fact I read study that in an moderate 2-5% interest rate environment, tech does the best"
$400 by December 2021
Just started my first position in AAPL. Lets go!
Market feels so weird right now.. Think its Time for another market crash? Like last year
"Seriously, if you are worried about Apple at these levels, you shouldn't be investing."
Never bet against apple. I do exactly what financial experts say not to do and invest in one stock and one stock only. That stock is Apple. Being young and foolish with money several times if I kept my Initial $50k investment in Apple in 2010 I would be a millionaire easily with buying 5000 shares at that time which today would be worth over $600k alone not including dividends and reinvestments which would total well over a million at this point. Just looking at the chart it seems Apple goes through these phases of sell offs in Feb and even through March to April before it picks up in the summer and then again early fall and end of winter. I lost about $25k in the last two weeks and today was another rough day. But hold and do well. Sell and maybe you will save some further losses in short but long term you will always lose. 68% chance of apple going up over next 21 trading days based on trefis data.
AMD and Apple trade the same
145.04 AH 8:15 Great day tomorrow for all AAPL longs! Shorts get toasted!
What are you going to do Cook?
Why you all are chasing the cannabis stocks I swoop in and add to AAPL while it’s down.
Way oversold at 121!!! Wow what a gift!!! This should be back to 130-140 end of week
"Follow Buffet's investing discipline: Always buy when it's cheap, Sell when it's become a bubble like Apple & Tesla, hence why Buffet is running to the exit and bought Verizon instead."
A guy buys Gamestop and becomes a millionaire overnite...You buy Apple after a 100 billion quarter and then lose your money...Is there any justice in this world
"Too big of a Bubble, Sell off won't stop until Fair value between $50-$60."
I've sold my position.
apple was robbed by the market makers. we should of been up 10% after earnings.
Looks like my God post bit the dust !Soon my account will be frozen again and then 10 seconds later I’ll open a new account !Thanks  for playing !
"Should fall under $100 quickly, Too overvalued. Fair value $50-$60 as pre-split price around $200-$240 which was the Pre-Pandemic level."
Omg it’s going down sell before the historic earnings Not!  Go Apple 
$spy $qqq watchBig tech namesPopAnd drop tommorow sorry but the yearning to own them for more than one day is over $tsla $aapl $msft $googl $now
"With all the future revenue and profit Amit Daryanani and other analysts are forecasting Apple to accrue in the coming months and years, it’s incredible stockholders would be selling their shares here"
"Yep, perfectly normal... Middle of pandemic stock market at its highest ever. No jobs, no restaurants, no business property taxes. There is a freight wreck train heading our way."
Some AAPL chart technical analysis for you. Look at the 3-month chart. The 50 day SMA is on an upward trend. The past 2 day’s candlesticks have long lower shadows (wicks) indicating a bullish setup. I think later today or beginning of next week we move up. Not an expert. Just my analysis and opinion. Good luck all!
teaming up with FSR to make the car . . .
"$32,650 - thanks !"
what not to like?--Revenue: $111.44 billion versus $103.12 billion expected--Earnings per share: $1.68 versus $1.42 expected--iPhone revenue: $65.68 billion versus $60.33 billion expected--Service revenue: $15.76 versus $14.89 billion expected
Except for one shoe manufacturer all you declared their quarter this morning beat estimates. About 80% beat by a wide wide wide margin. It’s like hitting across the park never to see the ball again . Market set to rocket to the sky . Job numbers coming out at 8:30 eastern time. People are being called back to work and more and more jobs being created
I am confident that AAPL will be $180 by end of the year......
Big companies have gone down the tube before look at Sears so many if apple looses it customer base it to will be history
Terrific report. Congrats to Apple management. MSFT was a tough act to follow - but you did it.
"Apple is not a trading stock. It’s a long term investment. It’s a wealth builder. If you want a quick pop, go to Vegas and bet on red."
"One thing I’ll say for the future...when Warren sells for whatever reason, might as well dump it too. Stock will go lower."
They going to release news on the ICAR today tomorrow kind of thing it will be over $150 bucks
"So lemme get this straight.... Facebook publicly admits Apple has it by the short hairs, Buffett signals that Apple is still Berkshire’s prize holding by a long shot, the company destroys all earnings records, the stimulus train is still running full steam, and there are totally new offerings (airtags, glasses, cars) on the imminent horizon..... and you’re selling this stock because....you hate minting money?"
Awful performance.... Is Apple heading down the drain with BlackBerry?? Can it ever survive? Continuing to fall in after hours market
The good will bounce back higher. The bad will not.
Apples Quarter Financials higher than predicted $140 here we come 
pay STOCK HOLDERS all cash reserves and divide company up befor apple is forcest to like ma bell
In apple for the first time ever at 100 share @ 131. Adding more at 127. I see $200 a share 2022
"Back to late day dumping. No question it’s a problem that has breached “it’s just the market”. Systematic selling in the final hour, final 10 minutes over such a prolonged period of time tells me there is a functional problem somewhere within how AAPL can be manipulated. This has becomes such a common occurrence with zero feel of getting out of it. Longs no longer check at 4pm. They check at 3pm, 3:30pm and 3:50pm as they know it’s going lower."
"Great Buy right now. Nothing stopping Apple, maybe some dips, but just look at the chart.. Apple is a success story and always will be. Apple EV coming soon to tackle the car market that by itself is going to be huge in a few years. In the meantime, new Apple tech, computers, pads, iPhones. All will be good. It is the standard of technology."
AAPL to Mars (the moon is so yesterday).
Biden bear market is here to stay.
This weekly Friday “manip-dip” is the best day to buy into AAPL
"I have invested in apple for 34 years. when you see obviously game stop start moving quickly, you have to buy it , to make some big money, while apple is losing money day after day."
The current price for Apple on Frankfurt is $128.08. So i think the market will be normal tomorrow!!
Apple stock is not trading.. Its for investing.. If you want to trade and short there are many better alternatives. This stock is for the long term investor.. Its climb is slow but steady and sure . Peace.
How far is this going to fall? :(
"Dont sell your stocks, tomorrow is a big day for us!!This year, Apple will host the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February 23, 2021 at 9:00 am P.T. in a virtual only format."
Apple hired VP Product Line Cayenne Bei Porsche AG Dr. Manfred Harrer to advance Apple’s EV vision
At the moment maybe is better to play on GME. At least retail have it under control.
All dips in Apple since the beginning of time have been buying opportunities.
"LOL. It's down 20 cents and Shorties think Apple is dead. Do you need glasses? Check the chart, Apple is always green! 137+ after lunch!GLTA!"
I think Apple is rethinking Kia because it's bot a great name like Benz.... or Jag.... they will surprise everyone with a great partner... and Cook once again boom to $175.00 So cover now before the big announcement boys
"Buffett needs cash to play some of the rest of the market and so decides to trim his AAPL holdings by 6%. Keep in mind 1) that's what you typically do with profit and 2) that a lot of that money just got redistributed into 5G by dropping $8B on Verizon. I don't think he's walking away from AAPL so much as he is trying to further diversify his play on 5G.We'll see how long it takes to play out, but at least the Buffett trump card is now off the table with a bit of damage done but probably a lot less than many were concerned about."
Sales force tops earnings but still falls. We are going lower tomorrow
"I told you to buy and accumulate on Thursday and Friday. Fake drop last Friday was classic from shorties hedgies, so they already covered partial last Friday. I hope you bought at pulldown and accumulate. HOLIDAYS expenditure is building more revenues in AAPL and AMZN. Apple will breakout 150 for sure. Shorties can not messed with truth (esp/revenues since Q3, Q4). All their game end up losing for them cuz there will be some one like the force of long retailers who will punish them eventually like Game STop traders. This time AAPL will fly above 150. Buy on Tuesday and hold. Never sell. Just buy at pullback as well. that's extra money even"
I never owned an iPhone but I think Apple is a bulletproof investment for the long run. I bought in today. Have a nice day everyone.
Wash trading AAPL at the same price is how writers of options in both directions derive their income. They also did this in 2012...for 4 years! Just be patient hold. AAPL’s uptrend is on their schedule
Apple won 77 Patents today covering a Next-Gen iPad and/or iPhone with a Backside Display & New Touch Bar Configurations
last chance to buy ... today will be 150
"Something is in the wind , Talked about on Bloomberg news Rumor $AAPL + $FSR in some form. Like over $TSLA"
wow...First green apple for a long time...although just a small one.
Can we please have President Trump back? PLEASE!
"Apple has reached its all-time high and that's before earnings report Wednesday when it should explode, as I said one month ago get in at 120 now you better get in at 139 because it's going to 150 and upwards shortly, I've been in this stock 12 years so I'm pretty familiar with the cycles and then this cycle says going up !"
"Funny how people are obsessed with iphone, but don't even realize that this is the year that apple takes over the high end windows desktop."
"ok just as I thought . Dow is well under 30,000. it will continue down til 20,000. wait and see . there will come a time to invest again, and there will always be hot stocks but Appl will go down to $100 per share next 6 months approx. sorry"
"I'm fairly new to stock, is this something good to invest in while its prices are lower?"
I’m looking to start a position in AAPL but am concerned about a trailing P/E ratio of 32. Looking at the last 5 years this ratio was in the 20-25 range. Using the current earnings of $3.69 per share that equals a share price range from $74-$92. Even using the high end of $92 the current share price is +32%. Does the near-term guidance from the company really support a $121 share price?
Joe if we open the economy there won't be any big lines of people waiting for food.
Bought the Apple dip! Thanks Warren Buffet!
Geez people. Apple board remember. I’ve held this “pig” as some of you call it. I’ve sold some two years ago and paid cash for my house. I’ve got a good decent amount for when I retire. I’m not a suite and tie guy. Just a regular blue caller guy trying to make a living. I worked in Apple computers for a living in 97-99 My point. It doesn’t happen overnight. All these big gains and trading sideways ups downs. It’s all good. Doesn’t faze me a bit. I’m long on Apple. I do better holding than jumping around swing and or day trading and trying to time the market. Just more my style. Have some patience. It always paid off for me. In the meantime it pays me a dividend. To each their own. Good luck.
This stock has literally corrected almost 10% since earnings peak. The slow bleed is unreal. This is the greatest short at the open stock you can find. Futures were up 200 points and this #$%$ couldn't even gap up $1.00!!! Now what March or April for the earnings Run up/Sell off?
"if bitcoin is ok, so shall be the market"
I would be selling right now. buy gamestop and Baidu.
"Apple stock, watching paint dry!!!"
Buffett adds more shares . Appl long. Trump 2024
PLUS AAPL will be buying back more stock next week.
As we come to the end of this glorious day I have a question. We hitting $140 tomorrow? Where’d the big talkers run off to?
it is very frustrating to watch a stock take months to move to all time highs but the hedge fund managers can take it down and wipe out months of gains in two days. the downward movements are violent in this rigged market.
New product announcement in March with the AirTags. Keep buying.
average for 600 shares is 135...looks like a long time to get there now
Is this down because they paid the dividend today?
"apple doesn't go higher on analyst upgrades. always down. but wait to you see what is coming, that will rocket the stock eventually 64 points in a 4 week period. sitting pretty."
Must have major cahones to short an apple stock.
"Most stocks have recovered and went higher since the Jan 27 market turmoil (due to GME); however, AAPL has actually gone lower since then (look at the chart). This is actually quite concerning as it is breaking below the upward price channel, and there is no obvious support point. Mr. Buffet selling is not helping either. The main thinking here is that AAPL is already the world's largest company at $2 Trillion, it is not as easy to double (to $4T) as smaller companies do as the economy reopens after pandemic."
"Apple's Hyundai-Kia report has been made public and the share is only up less than a gallon of milk. And GME no revenue on the verge of collapse gets exploited to approximately $500 within 48hrs of the Robinhood insurgence. What remains to be seen is whether when the current report sinks in will Apple with real revenue, cash pile, and real growth expansion race to $400+ within the next 36hrs."
"Darth Vader, I got scared and sold all my Apple stock."
Rumor is Apple to purchase $5 billion worth of Bitcoin as Tesla did to hedge declining dollar
Below $150 is a good price to buy and hold long
Can we all give a shout to a $140 weekend? stay strong stay long.
Apple will be back to $140 in March.

"Powell and his friends at the Federal Reserve and the stimulus checks signers in Washington D.C. are getting ready to blow the whole market up. Only 9% of the ""Covid"" (common flu) Relief Bill is going for covid spending. Where is the rest of the pork going? Who is going to pay for this?"
Waiting for $110. Berkshire Hathaway should be still releasing shares at that price.
Call me the eternal optimist or what ever. But I am thinking AAPL will be gaining in the PM and may actually close green. Save your negative remarks till after the bell.
The action last few days was like in the pandemic// a sign a near bottoM and major tech rally is here $spy $aapl $amzn imo
This economy is about to boom.......because I get my first vaccine shot a week from today. This means the Las Vegas economy will spike in late March.
"I only own 800 shares of AAPL so, this dividend increase doesn't mean much to me. It's extra lunch money but in reality ( for me) big deal. I'd only interested in the share price."
175 end of week Big news. Bitcoin and EV Apples in

"The iPhone Just had a huge quarter - CNN today Feb 22.London (CNN Business)Surging iPhone sales in the final three months of 2020 pushed Apple ahead of Samsung as the world's biggest smartphone maker, according to new research.The launch of the 5G iPhone 12 series propelled Apple to the number one position in the fourth quarter, Gartner said in a statement on Monday. The last time Apple was the top smartphone vendor was in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to Gartner's data, which tracks sales to consumers."
I wish we don’t close red :/
"If it doesn’t make sense that a stock is dropping....that’s called a buying opportunity. Use your brain, not your emotions. Apple had $112 BILLION in revenues last quarter. That’s fact, not emotion."
Seems like a lot of people here have AAPL as their sole investment. They are waiting for a big rise in share price and are getting frustrated.
"I need to find a new chart, this Yahoo chart works sometimes"
Nice to see some tic returning to tech stocks today
"First of all if you got in yesterday thinking this would go up, I say to you what took so long? Secondly, why in the world would you buy a 140 stock to make a ton of money overnight. Truth is the destroyed estimates on earnings yes. Doesn’t always translate immediately to share price. Oh but it will. Just don’t watch it tick like a clock. Apple is King!! Remember that"
will we open at 125 and close at 130?
"Apple is the only Stock I feel safe with, even when I bought it at 135 and watched it go down to 119. It never disappoints in the long run. Did I wish my entry was at 119, of course. But I still feel like I am with a winner even I have to wait one year for it to come back."
Either big iCar news coming so stock manipulated lower in the meantime or something else big enough.
short term cup and handle is formed. Upwards channel established. This week should be fun
Tim Cook and Apple should have bought VIAC and added Paramount+ content for Apple TV+. VIAC stock is absolutely on fire and he could have purchased this company for pennies on the dollars a year ago. Now it will cost $125-$150 a share for VIAC.

"Oh my God what a great article dated February 22, 2021 in Benzinga and trending on yahoo now.?The author is Shanthi Rexaline “why Apple will hit a $3 trillion market cap by the end of 2021”."
"Apple stock fell 1% last week to 135.37, with volume drying up. After tumbling following earnings at the end of January, Apple stock rebounded from its 10-week moving average on Feb. 1. Every day in February AAPL stock has closed just above its 21-day line. But AAPL stock hasn't closed above its 10-day line since Jan. 28, even as the 10-day and 21-day converge.With the 50-day line and 10-week lines also catching up, Apple stock could be poised for a key technical move up.The 138.89 cup-with-handle buy point remains valid. But Apple stock could be working on a new consolidation based off the Jan. 25 peak of 145.09. Investors also could use a move above last week's high of 137.88 as an early entry.Apple's RS line isn't leading but has held up better than most tech giants."
"All our government run institutions are corrupt and some are collapsing. Schools, law enforcement, infrastructure etc."
Apple is better off without Hyundai. I’d like to see an Apple + Honda EV
More p/e appreciation coming. Look at Tesla's p/e.
"appl high should be at $155, and being at 140 by now. not sure why it isn't."
If you had bought 1 year ago you’d be up 60%. Not bad eh?! This selling pressure will pass too
I don’t think Apple is gonna build an actual car but rather partner with with a manufacturer and supply the AI for a fully autonomous vehicle.
"Terrible, good Company bad stock. Hope it stops tomorrow, just for a while to save the Company from disaster. I'm not sure what to expect tomorrow."
Apple us selling its low margin phone division to private group of reddit investors for 100 million. Apple stock to drop 50% on the news when published

"Very disappointed in Apple. Yes long term stock it’s amazing, but it’s getting its face ripped off relative to the market/market sector"
I don’t understand... is it really going down because hedge fund selling to cover their loss on FOMO stocks?
Fantastic comeback. The bottom has been found. Upwards and Onwards amigos.  
You know it’s going to dump in the final hour. If you don’t....you haven’t been watching for past 7 months.
"I can't imagine selling AAPL or MSFT after their positive reports. Whatever happens tomorrow, I'm guessing they will both be higher in 3 months. Obviously, I'm a buy and hold type."
$ROKU Bounced off nicely from the 50dMA. Profit takers and weak hands are now flushed out.

"Apple’s privacy enhancement means you are moving your IP address from one company to another, but the iPhone maker is more trustworthy than Google.Google doesn’t have the best reputation when it comes to privacy.

AAPL will buy FSR which already has stylish electric concepts that are going into production... all AAPL can do is make FSR better and it's already a stylish E-Automaker to start with.

Will open $130 plus tomo
When will Uncle Tim pay a real dividend???
Screaming Buy !!
"After this pure manipulation today, people will start to be more careful with apple."
Be strong Apple team.  A sell off is unnecessary. Don’t contribute to tanking the stock. Prices will be back at 142 + in a hot minute especially if people don’t panic today/tomorrow and give into FUD. Hold and even buy more if any good opportunities. That’s how we win on this one! 
Buy and hold forever. Compounding will make you rich in the future.
"I have been in apple stock for 34 years now. in the first 10 years, I was losing my shirt. I retired because of apple at 42. I know a lot of technology people. this will be trading at 201.50 by the end of the year. you should be buying at every 5 dollar drop from the highs in big quantities. the future news is outstanding to come."
buy and HOLD....accumulate... shorties have to cover soon. EPS/revenues are king. FAke drop. BUY BUY accumulate.
move out of the way bears
I believe many here that are talking down AAPL are not all short (really who would short AAPL and sleep well) but investors wanting in at a lower price. Either way as a long its a win win. If it goes lower great we add. If it goes higher great we add. When you open your trading account in 5 years AAPL will be much higher than it is today.
Sell.The food gate will open any day to unleash the deluge of sell orders of biblical proportion.You don't want to hold this bubble stock all the way down to $14.
Apple has more cash flow than GM market cap. Apple will have something special for the auto sector.
"great day traders stock, run it from 121 to 124 with volume,, $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ to be made"
"Stores are opened, Iphone 13 coming soon, Apple E-Car, apple new charger and aaple buyback stocks. This stock soon or later ""ll hit 155.55$. Apple  is boooooming."
It appears that $500 headphones were not the answer. Need something fun with a cool factor.... the ibutt plug?
"I have to laugh. ROKU finally turned a slight profit and has about 50 million active accounts. Now given a price target of $500 up from its current price of around $450. Don't get me wrong. I've used ROKU devices for years because they worked well with my PLEX server. However, it's hard for me to understand such a high share price with such weak overall fundamentals.So what gives with Apple's streaming strategy when Apple has almost 1.5 billion active devices they could target for Apple+ subscriptions. I just don't understand why Apple+ is lagging. Why isn't Apple loading up with competitive video content? Is Apple going to say they don't have the money while doing massive share buybacks? What is Apple thinking about when any company with cash can purchase decent video content. Why would Apple be easily beaten by ROKU unless Apple is clueless about what it takes to attract subscribers? I'm not angry, but I am puzzled with Apple's lethargic attitude towards increasing video content. It doesn't seem like rocket science to find content that would interest subscribers. If Apple could get even 10% of Apple device users to sign up for Apple+, they would blow away ROKU'S subscriber numbers. SVOD on AppleTV, iPhones, iPads, iMacs, and MacBooks should be easy-peasy for Apple. I honestly can't figure Apple out in this case. Good content is king. An empty video library is worthless. It seems as though Apple is simply giving away streaming subscribers away to rivals when there isn't a good reason to do so."
Charts would indicate that this is the typical 1-2 week pullback that AAPL goes through ex-dividend. That occurred on 2/5 with the stock slightly above $137 the day before. May have a few more trading days to wait before the buy volume starts returning.
"Huawei #1 phone company, leading sales in china"
Tony Balooga is saying that Apple’s Q2 will be even bigger than Q1. So keep your arm out of that wood chipper. Slower moving analysts will figure this out too.........but you’ll already know.
This makes me consider 'flipping' some shares with these price bounces ... risky ...
Slightly annoyed by the EOD sell-off but then again I am happy to be able to buy more at discount. Thank you to whoever sold!
Down a buck and people are panicking? I would get out of the market and buy an index fund or bonds. Good lord get a grip.
Record earnings and this is what Wall Street does unbelievable.
"Tesla missed earnings, and the stock is up huge. apple has blowout earnings and the stock is down. it makes no sense to me."
Nasdaq Fair value down 0.40% which is not much and mind you showing improvements. So hold tightly with your shares because turnaround is and will happen
Buffet Apple shares make upHALF of his portfolio.... yes I said half...he cannot possibly let it go past 50%...even 25% is huge let alone 50%
"Oiur group is buying. Accumulate is the key Always always save cash to buy a low price. Covid is dropping. Aapl stores will open soon. This pullback is healthy, it will rebound. Hedgies games won't last, cuz truth will prevail. Truth is eps revenues in Q3 , Q4 were massive and price still this low? Better buy at open . Aapl 150 breakout will come quick"
Record earnings and this has went down ever since...strange
There are billboards in Indiana just across the IN/Michigan stateline thanking the Governor of Michigan for all the business that she has created for Indiana by shutting down the state.

"What a gift this was this morning!!!!! Wow thank u for the pullback, finally took a position in this!!!"
"Amit Daryanani note to clients: “App Store revenue grew 30% in February, another strong month in what has been a great 6 months for the App Store. We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to $4.4bn in February; up 30% Y/Y (vs. +40% in January, +31% in December). The growth in App Store revenue remains relatively broad based, with all categories reporting impressive growth with the exception of Music (+10%).The App Store is only one piece of the services business, but with QTD growth at 35%, we see an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates. The Entertainment segment (41%) remains the best performing segment, likely driven by tailwinds related to numerous streaming service launches. China remains the slowest growing of the major Geo’s with revenue +24%; however, it is still well above the single digit growth rate reported for much of 2020. The solid growth in China also comes despite a difficult comp (lapping COVID tailwinds) and the 24% rate is an improvement vs. the 20% in January.Net/Net: We think growth 20%+ is looking increasingly likely.Maintains Outperform rating and $163 price target."
"Dan Ives: “iPhone 12 strength not slowing down; more good news on the horizon. Apple’s stock has taken a breather since its jaw dropping performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, we view this as a short term blip in the stock’s upward trajectory as our Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength we are seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, we believe Apple will hit $3 trillion in market cap by year-end.”Maintains Outperform rating and Street-high $175 price target."
"Anyone still remember March 2020, We are going to refresh our memory, only this time the FED has no more bullets to save the market and we will truly be back to 1929 !"
My limit got set. Won't see 127$ again.
"So what next week, guys? $140?"
Why can’t Apple team up with Porsche for the iCar?
iCar expected to be coming off the assembly lines by 2024.
I sure hope tomorrow moves up...
"Too many young investors and/or traders on this board. Apple may not rise 50% in one month, but it will deliver fantastic returns in the long run. Look at the 5 year chart and tell me what it is you don't understand. Who cares about daily moves. The long term picture is what matters most. Own it don't trade it. Apple long!"
If Jim Cramer recommends to buy a stock just do the the opposite and you’ll beat the S&P 500 every year￼￼.
"I always look at week to week performance of any company's share price. Can't wait to get the Sunday paper and look at my various holdings such as Apple, nvidia, Microsoft etc etc"
"Only six business days until earnings, so maybe Apple wii rise into earnings. I wouldn't go by today because almost all stocks were up and Apple wasn't up as much as some other tech stocks. Not that it matters. Apple will continue to rise. I have no doubts the holiday quarter will be strong but don't look for a Netflix type of share gain because Netflix's market cap is around $300B which is nowhere close to Apple's $2.2T market cap. Apple practically buys back Netflix's market cap in shares every six months. I keep thinking about what sort of acquisitions Apple could be making with all that money being used for buybacks. Apple could own all the American car companies by now. I'm just saying if Apple wants to get into the auto business, money wouldn't be an obstacle. I know it's not that simple but it sounds rather interesting because of the EV craze in the market.Anyway, the next couple of weeks should be exciting if Apple had done really well for the holiday quarter but I'm always wary about Wall Street's expectations of Apple. I'm hoping for decent results and good guidance for the next quarter which investors will appreciate."
"Wait for earnings call, that will make it move."
Unless you are in options I see nothing to worry about. If you don't have any funds just hang tight. stock will be fine. If you do have funds. Buy a few shares on the way down. Don't try and time it.
It’s green because the Car deal is still on with Hyundai and Bmw have a shot as well this stock will double anytime it wasn’t at $400 before the split
"Apple already has both the long-range/fast-charging battery, and lidar-based autonomous systems technology to beat Tesla. It’s just a matter of which auto manufacturer to “share” it with, to delay the inevitable piracy ALAP"
Will AAPL hit 175 this year?
Apple is a stock that you should hold forever. Same as MSFT or GOOG.
Futures and down massively... another blood bath tomorrow. Hopefully they go up before future closes.
"Lets state facts. Apple may hit 130 today. We are in the middle of reddit revolution and it may lead to a correction. hold the stock we will be fine. Yes it hurts, we know this."
"The best indicator of electronic and the technology is the chip sector. First China stated that there was a severe shortage of chips, then the United States government said they were experiencing chip shortage, then GM and Ford said they were experiencing chip shortage and then the United States government is being asked to help open more chip manufacturing facilities. What is that telling us? It is telling us electronics such as I-Phones are in big demand that’s what it is telling us. Buy Apple but also invest in the Chip sector such as FSELX with Nvidia as a major holding. You can also look at other Family of Funds"
"My only stocks Green, airlines and pot!"
Could very easily hit $130 today! One step at a time
"AAPL might be in trouble by using slave labor in China, OMER does not, and will perform better:[1] Narso approval July 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties. [2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by June, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end. [3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself. Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued, here."
Nice comeback. Warren will regret trimming Apple.

ladies and gentlemen happy days ahead . yes siri bob. there is no needy to be a potato head and disagree with Babba. Next week we could surely dearly see beloved Apple zoom by $150. We had a bubba zoom call and all the Babbas agree. Thanko
"Based on Current trend, Apple will cross 150 in a month"
16 billion shares outstanding and Apple drops 3 points in 2 mins at the close Friday. That’s crazy and wrong.
And that $1400 stimulus check goes to . . . . A new Iphone or watch. Yep.
"You guys sleeping on apple , this is the best company in the world people"
"You would think everyone would be pumping last second additions of this company to their profile before earnings tomorrow but it seems we have an adverse affect here. However after seeing Nasdaq, SP and Dow you can see that half the market is tanking and half the market is rising. This is more broad than just Apple, it’s something else. I’m holding all my shares and calls (calls will be executed come Thursday for me). I see no problems here, just a matter of time really. GLTA and hold! SCARED MONEY MAKES NO MONEY!"
"Remember last week when the analysts said there’s no reason to be bearish? And then the market had a heavy sell off. Now this week they’re saying there’s going to be a major sell off? Yea, watch the market be up 2% this week. Gonna jump in this before it’s back to $130 by weeks end."
Services profits increasing. These publications about Buffett are a deception. He sold a bit and then turned around and made major purchases of Apple. He has a history of doing this. Stay long my friends. I am constantly buying Apple on the dip. Thankful for my fortune and will stay the course. 
"Making lemonade out of lemons.someone sold 100,000 Jan 22 $107.50 puts for $7.65 and $113.75 puts for $11.40They keep the money ( millions) or MUST but AAPL at $100 or $102"
VZ pays a 4.4% dividend while AAPL pays .67%That is what Warren may had been thinking?Here we have our own cash dividend: Da Vinci and Van Gough!
It’s all up hill from here to December... Fast recovery is the name of the game... Airlines are the most essential industry in the entire world...

BEYOND INSANE THE #$%$ MANIPULATION. DOWN 5 DOLLARS IN LAST 2 SEC. SEC SLEEPING ON THE JOB.WHOEVER SOLD THEY WILL GET REAMED FROM BEHIND BIG TIME ON MONDAY. AAPL WILL BE UP 8 TO 9 ON MONDAY
Stay strong!! It’s been a rough month and it’s probably going to get worse :/
I strongly think this will be green tomorrow.
"loading in more in the coming days. minor setback, major comeback."
"apple is on a death spiral. sadly, after holding my shares for so long I sold it all. I can't take these two and 3% drops on a daily basis. I am out."
"Looking in mirror lately, you get the sense we're all just algos?"
"One thing I’ve learned is not to ever, ever, ever, ever worry about apple share price. It will rise again. Take a break and look back in a week or two."
"The technicals still show AAPL in a bullish position..Just do your homework and, ignore the board haters."
YO guys and girls futures are slightly positive now. surely and dearly a great day tomorrow. also I behlievth it will be an up day tomorrow. also as yo recall we had some issues in february year of our Lord 2020 but we rebounded sharply. thanko
"Pre market at this early is not in any way a signal of a negative opening 9:00 AM Tomorrow. Low numbers of shares are traded at pre market. So relax and let the opening bell be your guide for early trading. As we all know the market is due for an upside, so stay positive."
Tim Cook says Apple is working on something that will be even bigger than the iPhone
Massive share buy backs when it goes down  thank the shorts and sellers to make it happen 
You all should have sold. This will go back to $100 soon. Powell's song and dance was to give the elites once last chance to sell to you retail bagholders.
"In my view, it is not a matter of if but when Apple takes a position in Bitcoin. Warren Buffet is one of Apple's biggest investors that has voiced his opinion that he will not invest in Bitcoin, although he does not have to because he can reap the benefit from Apple taken a large stake in Bitcoin. Eventually, Tim Cook will hold out but cannot appear to wait too long knowingly giving the impression he did not know it was going to continue to become more valuable and pay much more than what he does not have to. Bitcoin is current and what is on the other side of the pandemic, so it remains to be seen whether he will soon buy for what is inevitable or be reluctant and later recall he has made the biggest mistake for the Apple shareholder over the long term. While Apple has a massive market cap Tesla's investment in Bitcoin will soon bring its market cap to over a trillion and the rest will be history. Keeping in mind it took Jeff Bezos decades to amass his wealth and Elon Musk surpasses him in less than two decades. In comparison, Apple could have the same fate as far as it a market cap Tesla could possibly outpace Apple's market cap and it will be Tim Cook's failure to have invested in Bitcoin.The longer Tim Cook does nothing to invest in Bitcoin all note how Tesla shares and market cap rises and at what rate, according to Elon Musk we may all become the witness to my comments sooner than later.Tim Cook does hold Apple's fate with his decision will he advance to do the right thing or will leave it a chance and invest and potentially lose investors, best be wary Sears was once king and Sear is now becoming a distant memory in retail and know ever discuss whatever eCommerce may exist."
“Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.” - Buffet.Above statement applies to current situation of $aapl stock.
the rotation to reopening stocks has started. I dumped apple and bought Spirit Airlines and made a fortune to last month
Yields dropping. Tech stock popping!! Hoping for new highs Monday.
Like 10-15 red days in a row for Apple?
"Baby steps on the buy side, weighted safe on the sell side. No conviction buying. Took 20 minutes to go from -1.80 to -1.50. Took 14 seconds to go from -1.50 to -2.00."
"Apple’s iOS 14.5 is set to launch very soon, with a bunch of really cool new features for your iPhone. As new iOS 14.5 features continue to be revealed via the beta release, it looks likely that this could be Apple’s most stunning iOS 14 update yet for those who care about security and privacy.That’s because Apple confirmed this week that its Safari browser is going to be even more private by bypassing Google’s Safe Browsing in favor of its own servers. Specifically, the new iPhone privacy feature redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance user privacy and avoid giving any data to Google.Previously, Apple would send an encoded version of the site’s address to Google’s Safe Browsing to be compared with Google’s list of fraudulent sites. But the issue with this was, Google could see your IP address. The new Apple feature means Safari will protect this information when you browse on your iPhone, resulting in more privacy (and less reliance on Google)."
Lmao at hedge funds and the losses they have sustained ! It’s only funny because of how they have destroyed apples earnings day
Appl eclipses Samsung as top smartphone vendor for 1st time! MW
Why can't those exchanges just take away the sell button and only allow these MMs to buy and hold? i thought that's how it worked? did they change the rules again? can't even cheat to win without cheating at cheating.
How long will this correction last.? Do you guys think a crash could be coming soon?
Not a buy over 94.
"Rates keep going up, AAPL will have another Misery tomorrow."
Some big guys shorted this heavily ...it was very clear in last 5 mins
The funds are simply milking the long interest in Apple. It reminds me of Paulie in Goodfellas running up bills on the restaurant’s credit then reselling out the back for pure profit...Wall St-style racketeering
"No volume, no action. A very bad setup for the traders and option buyers. I still feel the market overall is overbought and due for some unpleasantness but mostly I am still fully invested. Did trim some holdings this week. In the long run you can't beat Apple because they earn more money than any company in the history of Earth but that does not mean it is immune to larger forces if they come to bear on the market. GLTA."
Investors be happy for the traders. They are our friends.Have a great weekend
"Joe thinking and actually doing are too different things. Doesn't doctor Jill, ha ha, have connections with the teachers union? Is that why the schools aren't open? Private schools are open. I know Joe if ya go against the union you won't get their vote."
Futures slightly down but don’t worry that always happens in premarket Sunday after a down day on Friday. I honestly believe Dow will be up over 4000 points next week and S&P and Nasdaq will do even better percentage wise. This is my years and years of experience talking
after watching MSTR why wouldn't you want everything you own to make a bitcoin related announcement?
So much for the market collapsing with a Democratic win. Sanity and a strong economy on tap for the next few years.
Don’t get me wrong I love Apple and have been a shareholder for 7 years. I just don’t like Tim Cook and all the secrecy about products and the future development of the company. Most news is always rumors by analysts doing investigative work and leaks.
One question. Will AAPL be a $200 stock by March 2025? I’m raising my hand.By averaging in a new position under $125 that’s a 15%+ annual return. As an older INVESTOR this looks quite promising for ten to twenty percent of a retirement portfolio. A major regret was not holding Apple over the years. Live and learn.
We were supposed to be at 150$ with mind blowing profits ....way way way over due now !!!
"Looks like the Tesla, Apple & Amazon shares of my primary portfolio is going to give another impressive return for this year as well. In 2020, I made a little over $900K with my portfolio. January 2021 is not even over yet and I've already made $192K already. I guess KARMA is just rewarding me for the decade of my life which I spent back in the early 2000s working like a dog (while being really sick) in order to put my now ex-wife through med-school. She then decided to pay me back by running off after she graduated & found a job in 2011..."
and so it begins again- done with all the profit taking.. time to fly!
"Apple is the future , own only 500 shares. Not taking profit. This is a 20 year hold stock."
It makes complete sense it's dropping. 600 companies underneath it's wing. Weighted on all major indices!
I sold every share this morning - just couldn't stand to own it anymore.
Classic manipulation with stock price folks.........Goldman and other hedge fund(s).
Not worried. This company has so much cash. Just need AAPL to dip a bit more so I can buy!
Stop speculating people! When apples ready they will announce what car company/companies they are working with. ￼
If you are having doubts about this stock. Look at Apple’s 1 year chart.
BUYY AAPL TODAY BEFORE THE BREAKOUT TO 150. THX FOR ALL 12 MIL CUSTOMERS
anyone have a handle on how options expiration is shaping up for AAPL? Are there any large option positions that will influence this weeks trading? Usually there is with AAPL.
I know why it fell down like this.I bought APPL first time in my investing career so that it fell down from the exact same day and still falling down. It will go up right after I sell. Anyone wants me to sell?
Apple can put mini-stores in 1500 Target Stores........and make even more boatloads of money. There is no Apple Store in my town......but there is a big Target Store.
"After listening to those Democrats grill Powell for a while today it dawned on me, “You don’t want to be in the market while they’re in charge.”."
ARKW sold BABA and TECHY today and bought more JD
Buffett sold on time
"go all cash people wereabout to haveabigbig 25 to 50 percent crash . does thisscare you march 2020 low dow jone 18,000 now 31,500 up almost go all 14,000 point nasdaq march 2020 low 6,800 now high 13,300. bitcoin march2020 low 5.500 nowhigh 48,000 all still no correction we arewaywaywayway over due for ascaryscary 25 percentstockmarket crassh and #$%$ 65 plus percent correction crash to bit coin all frofty market"
I never trade Apple. I invest!So i set it and forget... and i wait for the dividends.
"Longs you are good for this week definitely! I sold my $130 strike calls today, so it’s guaranteed that Apple will go above $130 tomorrow. The market has never missed a chance to lean me over a balcony rail and plow me like some school school"
"At the end this will move to $150 then $160 , the quarter and future are very very bright buy this now ."
Is anybody paying any attention to the Apple + Kia partnership? 100000 in 2024 joining the Apple eco system is massive ! Can we see it reflected in the stock price please 
"Just as the value of debt is driven by the expectation of return, so are the share values in the exact same way. So as you bear in mind the higher the shareholder requires the lower the value of the stock should be. The MRP are showing 5.6% officially while market return last 10 years is showing 10% plus. Clearly the yield on the 10 year treasury bill has definitely not been 4%, but more like 0.04% if that. In fact if you add fees it has been negative"
I posted yesterday that I thought Apple would reach 170 through earnings Wednesday and I feel even more confident that it will reach that target. I’m buying call options for the Jan 29 170 strike. Only time I will play the options but that’s how good I feel about it. Agree?
"I'm not excited over a dividend in the area of 1% , Timmy. It's only 7 tenths of one percent right now. If I want dividends , there are at least 5,000 stocks out there with much better dividends."
"I won’t lie, it bothers me that Cathy Wood sold 500,000 shares of Aapl.She didn’t do that because she thinks the stock will bounce back on Monday?She’s acting on the belief that a correction is coming!I’m trimming into any strength next week !Xxxx !"
Target 170 by official Apple Car announcement this month.
"The sell off today is amazing. Unreal. And it still going. PEople say buy, there is no buying all selling."
"Up $2, down $2....yawn. Long"
The problem is the Dow. Hitting new record highs while this is down $14 from recent high. You better hope the Dow maintains because there will be a LOT more pain for Apple if the Dow decides to give back.
"If I sell my Appl tomorrow, will I still receive my dividends?"
more than slightly tired of this.
I sold it $112 and bought it again at around $136. Don't know should I stay in or sell .
Going into earnings negative is better!
I've owned since 2002.This ain't my first rodeo with Apple.Just relax people. By the end of 2021 Apple will be north $175.Mark this post.
Regardless of Thursday’s AAPL performances it will be in the $160s by early March.
No reason why this shouldn’t be at 140 right now. Buy the dips as it’s hugely discounted
the question this week is will apple announce an online March event for the rest of the M1 Macs
Don’t listen to the shorts on this board if you are trading then sell it and move on. If you bought as an investment just hold it and buy the dip on the way down to previous support levels. They all know it will run back up to 150-170 area when the official announcement comes about the car partnership that will stop the downturn. They just want cheap shares and shake out weak hands
Today we will outperform the Nasdaq!
"Here it comes. Right on que. Can’t hold. Drops are easy, gains are a crawl. Something is WRONG here."
Imagine if we had a button to press to clear out any “sponsored post” or posts written in all caps claiming it’s the end times. 
The downtrend from the $140's remains firmly intact. There is a support level at $101 that will be battle tested. The trend is your friend.
Take my advice keep buying Apple . Will be double by Christmas 
"Stock is 24pts off it’s high, how can u think it will drop more? Anyone shorting at 144 did well, cover now or lose ur profit"
hey apple gave me ten bucks yesterday for free. pretty cool eh
Hey guys the Nasdaq futures are down. Guess what that means for aapl today?
Market open tomorrow ?
GME and AMC traders will join AAPL. They are rich now
Thumbs up if you got some sweet discount shares today. Thanko.
I just bought my first 27 apples today. was well below the moving average. why not..
"1.5%+ Yield is Better than S&P Dividend Yield and it's Risk-Free, if you wonder why we are collapsing."

10 day and 20 day moving average cross - green tomorrow
"Sadly, I think it gets worse before better. I see NO bottom whatsoever. It’s been 7 months of systematic selling into close. You would need to see a good few weeks of strength into close to think a bottom is reached."
"We are one step closer to ""The Apple Car"".....Apple is partnering with Hyundai-Kia to build electric/autonomous vehicles. Oh boy, this is going to be good."
Buffett published his investment firm owns 5.4% of Apple.
bought AAPL at 128.69...huge volume ..hedgies are scare due to AMAZON...APPLE will follow AMZN performannce. Hedgies will cover soon....buy buy before them
"Blowout quarter and NOTHING for the shareholders but decreased value. Nothing criminal here, keep it moving"
Last two days AAPL closed at $125+.IF not today then tomorrow
DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES! MMs ARE STAGNATING PRICE TO SCOOP SHARES. EVERY HIGH-PROFILE INVESTOR IS EYEING AAPL. PLEASE LISTEN.
"How are you all doing today.I myself, am a bit relieved.Lets have a good weekend. CYA Monday."
Most posts here extremely bearish—means it’s time to buy.
129.80 was a good buy. I am glad
$150 by end of day!!!
Is $130 support? Its bounced off that a couple of times already.
Looks like it BOTTOMMED....................................
Those Democrats sure no how to make the stock market go down. Apple strong even if they don’t like Apple.
"We don’t know where the stock will be in the next few days/weeks, but we all know where it’s going to be in the next few years (somewhere higher!). Stop speculating and start investing!"
my only regret of last week was I didn't have enough money bit still bought the dip but wantted moooorrrrrreeeeeeeeeeee>>>>>>>><<<<.....
"So when exactly Lucid will be selling its EV compatible to Model 3 of $TSLA? Year 2025 according to the company. By then, Lucid needs to compete with 30 different companies including $AAPL. LOL"
If Buffet sold 6% who cares. He still believes on Apple and have a largest stake in Apple on his list. Everyone know what is Apple from 1976. Even nobody in this earth exist without cell phone and same will be the future. Children born would like to see ipad and iphone when they are born. who cares about the car. Cell phone always rocks!!
Who's shorting Apple? I thought shorts argued before Congress that shorting provided economic benefits to stocks and kept their valuations in line. Apple earns more money than any company in history and the shorts are all over it. Why? Shorting Apple provides zero economic benefit and only hurts retirees who may need their money sooner. Time to outlaw shorting. Also time to regulate hedge funds. Why do they get a pass on regulation? They own politicians. Maybe the Wall street short killers should break the shorts in Apple.
"With another monthly opex today, here’s to hoping weekly & monthly call interest surrounding the blowout ER has subsided, allowing big money to ease up on the price fixing. Now AAPL can trend higher naturally..."
130 eod lets go tim apple
All the bubble stocks are getting killed. The money from them will flow to safer stocks like AAPL. Been long and strong since 2011. AAPL doesn’t disappoint long term INVESTORS.
Could you please imagine if Apple bought Bitcoin?
apple will close on the high of the day. Friday's trading was once in a 150 sessions.
"Bloomberg: Buffett Singles Out Apple Among Top Three Valuable HoldingsBy Katherine Chiglinsky , February 27, 2021, 12:38 PM EST￼Source: AppleBerkshire Hathaway Inc.’s holding in Apple Inc. has become so valuable that Warren Buffett eyes it on an equal footing to the sprawling railroad business he spent a decade building.Buffett has amassed $120 billion worth of Apple stock since his conglomerate started purchases in late 2016, while only spending $31.1 billion building that stake. That places it among his top three most valuable assets, alongside his insurers and BNSF, the American railroad purchase he completed in 2010, he said in his annual letter on Saturday."
Don't think shareholders meeting will be worth much. This market has it's mind made up. Really.
$150 per share tomorrow!!!
Hello all! I’m new here and just wanted to know how you all feel about Apple pursuing EV? Do you think it will actually happen? TIA
Looking at Apple going forward one has to be excited at the prospects of the products coming out to include Apple Glass and the Apple Car. I'm not a short term trader and invest in companies over the long term. This stock is cheap at these levels and one will see by year end. As the analyst from Wedbush stated he could even make a case for a 225.00 price target. So if your looking for an investment going forward that is safe Apple is it. They are even likely to buy back stock as I hear in regards to the bonds they sold. So you might want to beat Apple repurchasing stock which will push stock price higher.
"Today before earnings $145. After earnings $150, 2021 years end $200. Not Tesla but slow and steady with dips along the way. But future big earnings expansion with addition of smart glasses and much later Apple Car. The saga will continue! Stay long!"
"I have been holding apple a long time with no action. Sad, waiting , waiting. waiting for it to move and it does zero for way to long. however, I also know December of this year . Only 10 months if the stock market is still behaving well . It should be $190. $200.00. easily"
cup & handle on the chart break topside soon.
Can someone please explain to me with fundamentals why Apple is not recovering from its downturn for the last 3 weeks. Like this is not how investing works where you lose your gains and get them back a month later for a minimal return vs other investments
The experts come out of the woods LOL. ￼
"When Warren Buffett sells 57.16 million shares of AAPL it's not because the stock is heading higher. DAHH!!! Wake up and smell the stale coffee folks. Although Apple is a great company, for awhile it'll be fighting downside gravity."
"Apple is not building a car, rather they're building the next platform for technology and services delivery -- their technology and services. That's the end game here. They always control the hardware for their products and the car is no different. They also don't focus on always having the best specs but rather the best overall experience. No doubt that this will be any different. It will be a great car but maybe not necessarily the best in terms of range and/or performance. But, that doesn't matter. Apple is focusing on the in-car experience -- especially once full autonomy becomes reality. Nobody else has a bench as deep as Apple when it comes to delivering that experience."
It's a dip. When a dip happens You buy great companies at a discount prices with the money you don't need now and can live without.... Hold it for 3-5 years and you will be handsomely rewarded!!! Apple happens to be one of those great companies. Don't time the market! Don't wait to buy... buy great well run profitable businesses and wait!
"Let’s go AAPL, let’s squeeze out shorties, you got true believers rooting for you!"
"I stand to be corrected. apple RSI is only 37, any thing under 30 is a strong buy. 200 day moving average is 111.54, and 131.76 is 50 day moving average."
"INSANE, AAPL WILL BE UP 8 -10 TOMORROW. EVEN ROBINHOOD INVESTORS ARE BUYING VERY BIG"
$145 was a momentum driven artificial high. Just look at a chart and it’s plain as day. It will get back to that high. Just gonna take time
"I recommend to Yahoo that they close the message boards, or put a posting limit per day. one obvious poster is abusive."
"Let it drop, Let it drop.The next bottom is $115.We buy and hold for the April ER.The target at April is $15030%+Buy low, sell high.This is AAPL"
Nasdaq has really detached from the Dow. Not I remember seeing such a HUGE divergence.
Apple has been working on an autonomous electric vehicle since 2014 nonstop as it’s continuous patents prove. So Apple has 6 years development already on Project Titan.
I bought this and added to it on margin at 144. Any idea when I will see gains again?
rumors are tiger lost control of his vehicle when his stocks are broker told him how much he was losing on aapl. I'm sure you tiger won't read this but we are pulling for you you have done many good deeds for America.
"The market never had mercy for pumpers only think "" Stocks only go up."" When it crashes, just accept the reality that tomorrow may very well be worse than today, that's the risk you signed up for as a bag-holder."

"Strong Sell, Tomorrow $115 or Below, Never Bag-hold a Falling Bubble."
Wow! Today earnings everybody beat by a wide margin including E-Bay etc.

Anyone who is unsure about Apple stock should consult the technicals ! The RSI and MACD are both telling us Apple stock is teetering on the oversold and is due a bounce !
"AS ECONOMY OPENS UP, AAPL STORES WILL OPEN NEXT WEEK. STIMULUS CHECK TO BUY IPHONES AND IPADS AND MACS. CAR IS COMING. BUY BIG HERE BEFORE 180 IN MARCH"
"AAPL trades in trends of three. Last two out of three days there was a $125+ close.Feb 25, 2021 124.68 126.46 120.54 120.99 120.99 147,306,500Feb 24, 2021 124.94 125.56 122.23 125.35 125.35 110,691,500Friday is weekly option expiration. Little or no premium.Good Luck"
Watching Apple stock is like watching paint dry - painful!
"Too low volume in premarket only 400k shares at the moment traded. At 9:40 when they dump 2 milions shares to 127 massive sell off will start. Be smart, buy under $125."
Ok guys! Just relax.Apple still sells phone.Still makes a good amount of money It’s probably still going to sell more this quarter We’ll be fine! Stop with the negativity:)
Bad timing. The hedge fund guys probably sold their apple shares to make up for the lost causing apple to drop. We should trickle back up with no problems.
"So, market is UP. Fine, I have shares in 24 stocks out of which only 5 are green and that too none of them exceeds 3%. Are you kidding me? How can it be with each major index gaining more than 1%. Strange"
175+ by next earnings release for sure
"Time for $115 or lower tomorrow, Next Week we will be in the $100-$105 best scenario, Worst case we are heading below $100."
Kia ? Hyundai? Really ? For anyone with a car hobby like me I can’t think of a worse choice to not add value and respect to the prestigious Apple brand.
Thank you to all those who sold so I could buy at discount.
Down 16% and climbing. Probably retest the 118 low from last week again
CNBC halftime report 3/2/21: Josh Brown says without a doubt Apple is the greatest stock in the world!
"Apple reported per-share earnings of $1.68 and revenue of $111.44 billion.Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.42 a share on revenue of $103.27 billion, according to FactSet."
Another red day. Bulls will blame rates even though rates were down yesterday.
"ayo, imagine selling a company that netted $25b in one quarter and is now expanding into the EV industry LOL"
"Gene Muster on CNBC analyzing AAPL earnings, check it out!"
Shift to cash....This is not going to be an easy fix....Short sellers have to sell good stocks at the end...The only solution to this is to STOP short selling totally....That has been the money cow and now tables have turned 
Futures up!! $130+ tomorrow
Oh my God trending now article by Jeff Cox “Personal income jumped 10% in January 2021 while INFLATION WAS IN CHECK “. WOW this should drive the market up. It does say part of the increase was caused by stimulus. Yes but only part probably a small part and then no inflation either.
"Remember AAPL, AMD, MSFT reported a great Q, hedge fund shorts trying to scare the the herd................."
I am very bullish on Apple now because we are seeing progress on the EV front ! The partnership with Kia is very good news !
I keep saying have to find some green. That’s over. Down over $18 since earnings and no bottom in sight. AND...the Dow is green today. You’re in trouble.
"Goody Morning to my sisters and brothers on this board (I no longer sayeth brothers and sisters because sisters come first). anyways I thankit my lucky stars or whatever that I have been buying more Apple and Technology.

The forward P/E of Apple has come down to around 27. That is more inline with its historical P/E and should signal we are close to a near term bottom. I wouldn't be selling here
Aaple proved that blowout earnings mean NOTHING!!
Grea buy point for long term holders!
"I’m starting to see apple as an average at best investment. I have 1400 shares and since earnings it’s gone down about 10 a share. If I had put this money into DraftKings,Upmet, mro. I’d be up 50,000. That apple tanked after earnings tells me they are just a consumer able goods company, has been."
"As I recall, AAPL had a great report last quarter beating all estimates and yet the stock sold off by 8 -10% the next day. Curious about thoughts for the upcoming report and the market reaction. I am holding 2500shares for the long haul, but also have Feb calls ranging from 125 to 145. Would appreciate your thoughts."
OPINION ---- Options: Sept. 2022 strike 130 and 140 --- Hold until after earnings? or sell prior?

"I bought back in November at $122/share, and didn’t panic sell or take profits at $145 area, or freak out when it dropped below $120 last week. This stock will change our life by the time I sell our families shares! APPL Strong   #Buy&Hold"

The idea is to have stability, a good/great return and to be happy and feel secure. Then you do other things in life such as golfing, studying, reading, writing, relaxing, swimming etc etc"
"AAPL fundamentals and press releases are positive. Unfortunately it does not relate to the stock in any positive manner. It dropped $19 in less than 3 months. My stop loss is in, hopefully a turnaround tomorrow, but the stock downtrend must be stopped. Unless you are really LONG, enough is enough. I know it will bounce back but as a retiree for my wife and I it’s a different strategy. Hopefully tomorrow starts the upside trend."
apple board approved div increase. let's go!
"apple is a $2T company. y'all are expecting 20-30% gains in a week, which is absurd cause that would mean growing thing company by $700B in a short amount of time. have reasonable expectations. apple will go up over time. $140-145 right now is reasonable in the short to mid term."
"my god, all this complaining! This is a fantastic entry level. Just buy and hold"

This is the first time that I am making $$$ on AAPL and TSLA guys! Bought them on Friday by the close....check NIO XPEV BLNK....NVAX
Buybacks enhance the equity position of Apple longs. It doesn’t do much for the traders though. Personally happy with the buybacks.
People will be buying March and April to get the divi increase at the end of April
"Fret not, my clueless investor friends!My name is the Great Whambami, renowned psychic and prestidigitator. I am here to reassure you, and to tell you what the future of Apple holds. Looking into my crystal balls, I see movement tomorrow! Yes, movement. Much movement! Yes, yes, I see! The stock will go up some and then down some, and then go up some more and then down some more, and it will repeat this process for a full six and one-half hours before settling on a final price that is different than the price at which it started.I ask not for your money, giving you this valuable insight, only that you use this knowledge wisely.Regards,The Great Whambami!"
Will turn GREEN today on analyst upgrades today!!!! Wait and see!!!

The market was run up by robinhooders and now it’s gonna to correct. Leave some cash on the side
Trust me - the last thing you want to do is make a decision based off what some losers on this group keep saying  Long story short!! This will climb! Back to $145+ Pin this! Check back March 15
Doom and gloom is over folks. Apple had strong earnings and is printing money 24/7. We will see 140 USD in a few days. Fundamentals rule!
"Doom and gloom is over, 130.00 is the new bottom. Let's attack high 130ies and go ATH in a few weeks. It's just a matter of time! That's way you don't short or play options with Apple. Just patience!See you hat 150 USD!"
Wall Street should be focused on stimulus. New iPhones for everyone
This recent price action is from two main factors. Hedge funds selling long stake in big tech to raise capital to offset losses in reddit stocks and tutes see huge potential in future quarters so they are depressing stock for their own gain. Major accumulation happening. Wait until the next 13F get released and see how many more shares the top 5 holders are accumulating.
SOON selling exhausted and with all the upgrades we resume uptrend. thx. buy here
I am accumulating at any pullback too. Hedgies are mad retailers are eating part of their prey...I like that comparison. It's true. They will cover squezing to 170 in one or few days.trust me

no reason for the selling. China new year and booming economy and opening stores soon and %g roll out should take AAPl tp 170

Apple PLEASE 
let the squeeze begin.
Apple is getting a ton of CNBC coverage today. Buy now or pay a whole lot more 5 years from now!
Green here shortly
What’s the next resistance or gap down level? Looking for a floor to go all in. I’m hopeful that it hits $99 so I can scoop up a quick 100 shares.
i wonder where this is going- All the rotation stocks are so over valued at this point seems this should be a good buy pretty soon.
I think Netflix set the tone of the market for at least one year if not years to come. Excellent results from Netflix. And there is a vast expansion of the application and use of technology including and specially the semiconductor sector of which we cannot even dream of let alone think. Cars are now not only mechanical but also electronic. Since I am ancient and old I never thought I will see this age of technology. My advise stay fully invested forever and watch your investments grow through leap and bounds.
One of the funniest things on the internet are all the geniuses who think they're smarter than Tim Cook AND Warren Buffett.
"Huge earnings, huge pullback, dividend, world’s best EV on horizon. Look for months of uninterrupted upswing now. Enjoy!"
"Down on an up day and further down on on a down day. Stay long. Apple will recover soon as it always does. Fundamentals for the company and future prospects have never been better. Wedbush is predicting they will announce their iCar within 3-6 months and once the stimulus passes, it should be huge for Apple. AMZN had a similar reaction after their record earnings and the stock has slowly recovered and going up. I predict same for Apple because at the end of the day, fundamentals always matter."
bounce back tomorrow. going to sleep? check the futures
"Sold all my apple to buy AMC  fire sale , I'm up $7k already "
Apple will report its next earnings on May 3rd. The stock will be at least $150 before the report. I’m totally comfortable waiting 2 months for that.
I joined appl as an employee in May 2020. My stock grant was 350k over 4 years. That is now worth over 500k.

when is enough enough. sell
"it's funny, when this stock is at 140s, everyone was buying...now its 120, suddenly people get scared, nothing fundamentally changed, and simple as it is: 120 is cheaper than 140..."
Just 36k in red. Come on!!!
"I was told to buy and hold an apple, but my arm got tired and it eventually rotted. What am I missing?"
"If you are long and seeing this destruction and not at all concerned...you probably own 1 share. Otherwise, you’re not happy watching this."
This is $200 in NO TIME ! 
Definitely $150 or more this week
I used to laugh at the guys claiming to be up a million from apple...now I'm one of them. Life changing decision to buy it. The crazy thing is the future still looks bright. Could the best be yet to come?
AAPL is not immuned to correction too ...
Apple buying back in Billions see you at $200 within 60 days buy and hold
"Are you kidding? Why is the stock price dropping? Are the usual shorties trying to drive the price down. Investors, hold on to your shares. that was an extraordinary earning for 2020 with or without the Covid-19!"
"Market Sell Off Accelerating, Clear sign of Tech Bubble 2.0 Crash just getting started !"
I just bought after hours. Co-workers told me about AAPL beating earnings . I agree with them AAPL will break 150 tomorrow or Monday. Tomorrow I will buy at the opening if i see any pullback. I want to accumulate more if drops. Electric car will send quickly than tesla. Price will surpass 200 breakout quickly. Price will correct soon due to revenues as of today.
The car thing seems like it's a long way away. Cant believe it would have a big impact on share price until there was more concrete information. I mean it is a 2.3 trillion dollar company...takes a lot to move the needle and sustain that move. So...any time frame estimates on when this car might become reality?
Vold day from apple. How about we all escape our problems and fly to Cancun? Just like Ted Cruz.
"Looks like shorts have started to cover, hold your shares $150 incoming"
"Guys don't get all excited! Lots of good sentiment and news today helped this propel to 127 today. We need to see where the support is reestablished. Without that we all saw what the big boys were capable of doing in 3 seconds from last Friday. So relax, watch the direction and protect your money!"
Stocks take the elevator down and the stairs up. Just part of the game. $150 will come. Just gonna take a while
AAPL needs to reclaim $132
AAPL will cross $140 by Friday and will settle close to $145
"This is going to turn soon either by some news or just a sign of being over sold, not sure if today or tomorrow or Monday, but it will."
"Question. I noticed that if aapl finishes above $130 next Friday, there is over 200,000 call options that would be in the money. How significant would this be the following Monday?"
The algos are obviously set to drag tech and AAPL down as the Dow goes up. It is so obvious it is laughable. AAPL is too easy since the split to whipsaw around. Huge mistake. They should reverse that decision.
$AAPL in pre-mkt still below Friday's 3:45pm ET price.
"Central to Apple's car strategy is a new battery design that will ""radically"" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range, according to an engineer who has seen Apple's battery design. Apple's patented “monocell” design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple has also innovated a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, according to the engineer, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries."
AAPL had the chance to by TSLA according to Musk... now they have the chance to buy Lucid after it goes public. I'm gradually accumulating just in case.
Keep telling myself to sell every stock I own and put it all in Apple
"Been holding Apple since iPhone announcement in 2007Now at 4,874% return on my investment -Not too bad. Will continue to hold at least 10 more years and sleep very well at night not worrying about day to day price changes. Apple is a long term play folks so quit worrying about day to day price changes."
115 coming soon
You have to understand I am sure apple is working on something huge. Buy or you will say I should have guessed they are. Could see a huge spike in there shares. Go apple
impossible to predict in either direction daily for apple. I don't know how long this correction will be.
"Apple will become a 10T company in the future, that’s all what I care. Ignore all fluctuations and just buy and hold!"

Ex-Dividend date for Apple shares coming up fast. I certainly hope those shorters like paying the dividends out of their own pockets...!
 should pledge to plant a billion apple trees and donate fruits to the homeless and impoverished. Help heal the earth and the communities. 
We need 140 this Friday ....come on aapl ...let’s skyrocket now ...
There has bee days when Nasdaq is red all day....but Apple is green.
AAPL is still up$6/share vs on month ago.Big boys don't cry
10 year year is now 1.42 because the fed start control the 10 year yeld i watch today didn't move at all it's BS the fed suppress the 10 yeld. will see how long will last + the dollar getting stronger and oil is moving down
"once I get to the office in the morning. i will send to my group an an email to buy AAPL in pre market as well. This price is the deal of the year. it's just a matter of time it will break 150 in blink of an eye. 200 is coming in this Q1. covid cases is dropping. In the west nom death today. Apple stores will open soon. The truth will prevail, Esp/revenues are truth and correction will send to 200 at least. Dividends are good while I am waiting for price to break 200 in Feb."
buy the dip. stock market goes up every year so Aapl will go up.
"Look at the 1 year AAPL chart, and make a guess as to where we’re headed pretty soon. I see some good upside potential in our future! This is a great time to buy and hold I believe."
If it somehow touches 120 (the 200 moving average) back up the truck!
Dollar cost average for the next 5-10 years and don't look at the price.
"P/E of 35 is pretty good value. Not selling as much hardware, but increasing revenue from subscription services year over year"
This is the thing at least for me. I’m retired and don’t need income from stocks or mutual funds. I’m loaded with Apple shares and mutual funds. I have lots of passive cash income from real estate and other income so when Apple dips I buy more. When Apple hits $200 end of year I’ll be very happy
Bond rates are up. We are in a bubble. Be smart guys. Or go long term and in 10 years and you’ll be fine
I’ve never seen it this bad. This is worse than early pandemic days when everything got initially beat up.
Apple crypto?
Who have 16M shares to unload in one minute?
Remember when Buffet dumped the airlines at the bottom? He’s past his prime. This will close above 130 today and will close the week above 135! Book it
"Last thing I heard Apple management & BOD worked for the stockholders. Yet Tim Cook is quite free with our money for his political causes. $100,000,000 is Apples latest give-a-way & it comes out of our pockets. Sure Apple makes a lot of money and management already rewards themselves with hundreds of millions in stock bonuses. Yet they feel the company should donate to Tim Cook's political causes rather than have him donate his own money. Tim does an excellent job but he should EITHER get his bonus or use HIS bonus to donate to liberal causes IMO."
Selling at the end of the day is a bearish sign ala candle indicator
I called it. I had a feeling it was going to close around 121.80.
Recently invested in Apple and ENZC... ready to sit back and watch the growth
Apple is going to double anytime on news of the ICAR wait for it stay invested
I’m guessing Apple  will release details on AR glasses before any car design. And that’s fine
I am taking a poll and survey. how many shareholders want a 1 to 4 reverse split to go back to 4.3 billion shares outstanding float.
"Wow so far my account down another $4,865. today. Since earnings down $44,871. Now some cheerleader tell me to stop crying. What a joke."
If we can hold green thru 10:30 should be OK for the day.
I’m 20 and apple makes up like 30 percent of my portfolio but is see people say the stock is lagging with the market going up because it’s so over valued should I sell and wait for it to even out because it’s been lagging the last month or just long haul it like I have been for 2 years lol My ark funds have been sky rocketing
Apple is NEVER EVER 1st to market. Apple lets the market work out the bugs and then enters the market knowing they can improve it DRASTICALLY!
The downtrend remains firmly intact. The trend is always your friend.
longest market rally over
OMG OMG. I buy more. Enjoy your peanuts
Is there any way of knowing what the current price for aapl is in the futures. I know the S&P is up
Apple heading to $90.
"Too many traders not enough Apple investors. Multi-year bag holder, dividend raise coming soon!"
I have invested in Fisker (EV startup) and Apple let’s see who will give better return. Currently Apple is -10% while fisker is +1%. Quite opposite of what I thought.
AAPL making tons of money just not shareholders???
"Why $132?Programs buy and sell target numbers.AAPL dipped below 50 DMA (Day moving average) as AAPL dipped from $132 to $118.Now if you want it to run,,,Reclaim $132"

"I just want to say:(1) Stock prices always fluctuate.(2) Apple is volatile!(3) With great risks come great rewards(4) Its reached its all time high many times - i don't see why it wont again!(5) Keep holding!! Don't sell!Consider it a business. Some days we sell things and make money, some days we have no customers and literally make no money. But at the end of the day, see the progress month over month or quarter over quarter.Hope this helps some of the newer investors (who probably bought at $140s."
"In the past, historical records have been a good road map."
Patience my friends. My limited experience combined with old timers advice is to hold. Long term we will be rewarded.

"what is happening with apple, nio and Tesla."
I know it’s old fashioned to mention PE ratios but look at the PE of AAPL. It’s pretty high compared to its historical average. Not giving any future guidance yesterday was a mistake and hence the stock is down

One of the safest investments. I bought at $142, and doubled my position at $136. It it goes down more, I buy more. Simple."
Is AAPL $145 yet? No? Ok. I’ll check back Friday.
I think very good time to buy
This is hilarious. People thinking AAPL will go negative this year
Apple will lose permanent market share if google adds a crypto exchange first. Millennials love digital crypto.

"ticker gold pe of 13 versus apple 34, apple is overpriced"
Looks like the easy money making in stocks from last year is over.
Half of Buffett portfolio is Apple...half!!...its amazing that Buffett only sold 6%...to hold half your portfolio with one stock is unheard of but Buffet said he considers Apple his third company and the greatest business in the world
Well it’s not earnings and it’s not lack of products or lack of future ingenuity... what we are seeing is proof that the market is a funny thing doing whatever it wants and none of us have a clue what it will do next
Well Warren Buffet was the ultimate risk to common AAPL share holders due to his huge stakes. AAPL should have directly bought shares back from him!!!
"Sorry to break this to you, but by tomorrow's cash open, the US stock futures will be down . . . again.Don't you see, longs? This stock has peaked already. This stock will hit $14 next spring."

AAPL is Zack's Rank 1 (Strong Buy) today and is now top 1% stock. Not surprised!!
This was at $127 a week before earnings and $120 shortly before that. Why is everybody getting weird here. It may still have sone downside but always comes back. Sometimes fast and sometimes slow but ALWAYS comes back
Frustrating. Should be following up gains with solid green markets.
Disgusted.
These are dream scenarios that happen occasionally and you have to take advantage. A blockbuster ER and the stock sells off. I have been in Apple a very long time and every time this scenario plays out it turned out to be a massive buying opportunity. Me thinks that’s what we are looking at here compadres. 
I previously said $150 after earnings over 1 month ago. Now i believe AAPL will hit $155 after earnings tmrw.
Apple market cap gonna be 3 Trillions soon
My estimates for earnings are: Sales 108 Bil - 115 Bil and EPS of 1.50 - 1.70 !!!
They are piling into Apple today! about time. Big quarter coming
"Apple should rip higher back to $140 and cruise to $185 by the end of the year. New target ""Mini Apple stores"" and all retail apple locations open. Iphone supercycle, stimulus, M1 chips, apple india, More updates on apple car throughout year, AR glasses coming."
I just do not understand why AAPL does not go up with the market anymore. Never seen market up every day to new highs and AAPL is red most of the time.
"Too many bargain buys to sit on the sidelines, AAPL is definitely cheap here."
I see that President Joey B ordered 36 Darth Vadar outfits for himself ....He wants to look sharp and send a message to you 75 million outlaws who dig individual liberty...
Waiting for for a great green day!
The Dutch Consumer and Marketing Agency (ACM) has announced an investigation into Apple's claims that the company requires developers to use its in-app payment system in exchange for a commission of between 15% and 30% of revenues.
"I remembered seeing the PE ratio of apple was around 32.8... on the weekend. Today, the PE ratio suddenly increases to 34.86. Why? Is it because the value of aapl stock increased today? I would appreciate if someone can explain this to me. Thanks in advance"
"Every one, the price of AAPL is reflected on the dividend payment distribution today. It’s normal for a stock to be down on paying day of dividend, so relax, hold long and you will be rewarded."
Apple Inc said all its U.S. stores were open as of Monday for the first time since March last year. WOW!That is good news. So we are now part of the reopening trade? Fingers crossed.
"COOK OR EXECUTIVES NEED TO REVERSE THE SLIDE OF AAPL STOCK WHEREAS MSFT IS AT ALL TIME HIGHS. NEED ANNOUNCEMENT OF CAR DEAL, NEW PRODUCTS, MASSIVE BUYBACKS, ANYTHING. IT IS GOOD FOR THE INVESTORS WHO ARE CUSTOMERS"
"Cook on Political Contributions: We do not make them. Do not have a PAC. Apple advocates in different ways.9000 US suppliers, supports 2.7 million US jobs"
Apple can do better than Hyundai and Kia. Apple has never even released a statement about any sort of EV deal. It’s basically fake news. This will have no effect on share price .
what's going on...all techs are red...are pl saling tech and buy Tesla and Bitcoins? Billions went into Bitcoins this week. Even Boeing is green with all the issues they have and negative Cash balance ...no revenue but only debt. It is up $12 today.
"I am buying at the opening, first minute. MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZE IS COMING. Tic toc. My 1st entry is the first minute. I will set stop buy order every 0.25 cents for a $3 rise. if pulldown , I am buying at pullback and accumulate and steal hedgies prey like hyenas. The lower you buy the more money you will make. Hedies knows AAPL is heading 150 breakout first then 200 in Q1. So every time, it pullback, you should be happy buying. Don't sell anything but buy more. if you can by more than your original position. I don't care if drop, cuz we will buy more. Truth will prevail. Truth = EPS/revenues. We are hyenas buying accumulation at any pullback. SMart money will end up their game. Buy only"
We sitting on mountain of $$$ I believe icar would be revolutionary car!!! You know Apple products always quality and very very modern!
Bought 50 more shares today at $120.
Will the morning gain hold today? Or is it another repeat?
excellent buying option to load more at this price
"Look at the 1 year, 2year, 5 year chart. Apple is consistent! Long term growth"
"Don't get Trapped by Wall Street & Buffet, tomorrow and beyond you will wake up to the same repeated bloodbath, Stop Feeding the Ultra Rich !"
"#$%$ wow. Just checked. Are you kidding me? Down another $1.70 already. So in 3 weeks, I?ve lost $16.09 a share. Thanks Apple."
"Curling back up boys, load the barge before it's too late"
Get ready To test 110 this week with apple And I think we close on Friday around 107
"On earnings day, AAPL could be 145$ (or more!) per share! Morgan Stanley target price is 152$."
"Keep short and sold, we'll keep buy the dip and wait. That's the market. I'm going for long for now. AAPL is still a good investment as always."
Correction on tech stocks is over and MAR-APR normally are the best months for the market. I bought AAPL INTC QCOM TWTR SNAP BA TSLA by the close - Best to all!
"Despite our day, AAPL will still outperform the market. Buying on the discount."
"Just think of how overvalued AAPL of a Bubble has become, $130 is the same as Pre-split price of $520 (4:1 Split) Pre-Pandemic with good economy AAPL was always trading in the $150-$200 range pre-split, so now it has gone up almost 400% in much worse economy. Dump this Bubble !"
Stimulus bill passing in the house today plus 10 year treasury below 1.5% plus options expiration should help us to have a great day!
"AAPL is firing on all cylinders and no logical reason for selling off. Introducing 2 new macs soon, upping divy, WWDC and slated as top global cellphone company surpassing all other providers. I don't know when this ridiculous rotation thing will end but my bet is sooner than later."
"One day soon the US congress will legislate by asking, ""What does the Apple board recommend?"" The President will simply ask, ""What are my marching orders for the day, Tim?"""
"Apple has all the attributes of a long term winner. The car or components that Apple supply will be THE world leader, and the stock is held at the mercy of a few hedge funds"
Apple should buy GE before Warren Buffett buys GE. GE will double or triple in a V shaped recovery later this year.
WATT a day... up 97%Energous ( $WATT ) jumps on news that Apple ( $AAPL ) is working on a wireless charging attachment for the newest iPhones....
Best ever record breaking quarter and we get hit down for a month ! Market scam !! Wow ! Long and strong - Apple and it’s shareholders will win in the end .
If you guys an investor don’t need to look at the stock set it and forget it and wait until you retire and enjoy the wealth and for those trader good luck
"If you don’t believe AAPL being wash traded, how else do you explain 16M in volume at such a stagnant price in the last hour, when AMZN, GOOG, even TSLA, only had volume in the 100k’s??"
GE is up 50 cents today. GE makes airplane engines that don’t explode.......and Boeing will need a boatload of them.
"I bought yesterday, I'm buying today and will buy every red day."
"Time to buy some $AMC is now, not going to get a better price after open. Cheers."
Remember what I said!? Apple is one of the few companies that make money!! It’s only time when people realize that all the money they put into airlines and cruise companies will take a long time to give a good return.
get those cheap May calls.....morgan stanley says $190 target for 2021.They will be right for sure.
That moment when you realize that gme was a safer bet than aapl
Two of the biggest investors in the stock market pulled out of Apple a bit. Something must be up. I must know something.￼￼
Thank you shorts us Longs really appreciate the dips can we get the stock back to 90 for a week so we can buy more
Some joker said Apple was down after hours. So I looked up and it is down 9 cents . That’s down? I then did an experiment. I took my big back side up from my sofa and looked around for pennies and guess what I found 17 cents. I need at least 50 cents to buy a bag of chips. So 9 cents is immaterial and carries no weight or bearings but the little rabbit  who reported Apple bring down after hours caused me some anxiety which was utterly unfounded
and the mayhem continues after hours
"Apple is a hold and accumulate, not a trading stock."
"122.09 is apple's 200 day moving average. I expect the short term bottom will be there. I have never seen a company that had blowout earnings, trade below the 200 day average ever."
Apple always does the opposite of what people expect. I think we might just fly tomorrow!! Plus dividend day is coming up so that’s going to be us a nude boost too. We have lots of products coming this year also + we had a good ER so that should keep us over $132. GLTA!!
"When market is bad even outstanding earning will not move the stocks, lookat Zoom and others, Apple was no different."
Remember when the market was supposed to crater if 81mil patriots elected Joe?
"this stock will not move, UP OR DOWN, until major news comes out. Boys we're floating in the waves at this point."
Surprised but not shocked!AAPl has dipped three or four times to $126 to $127 only to rally back to $137+ in a few days.Why?Long term puts were sold for 15%.
"They can't contain the Red Hot Inflation, Rates are skyrocketing, Stock Market will Crash Harder than 2008, Run !"
INVESTORS AND WS ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE RECKONING FORCE BEHIND THE AAPL CAR. IT WILL TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY. AAPL DESERVE A PE OF 100 AT LEAST. AAPL OVER 141 TOMORROW.
"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares are on track to hit another milestone in terms of market capitalization, according to Wedbush Securities.The Apple Analyst: Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating and $175 price target on Apple shares, with the bull-case price target at $225."
"Most people fail to realize apple always performs in the long run. Go ahead and pull up the 1 year chart, the 2 year chart, and the 10 year chart. quit worrying about short term volatility and pay attention to what matters, the long run and the massive success apple is going to have and has proven to do so."
"Always remember. If you have trust in a company, everyday is a great day. Green days give you profit on your investment. Red days are great too, because you can increase your position at a discount, to make bigger profits in the future."
APPLE BAGGIES DURING LAST 15 MIN OF TRADING FRIDAY
"Giuseppe, get back to your day job. You don't get paid to leave dire Yahoo finance warnings."
Wedbush says there is 85%+ chance that Apple will announce apple car with Hyundai or VW by JULY this year.
Will close green.
Wedbush’s Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance:“I believe six to nine months from now we’re looking at a $3 trillion market cap for Apple.”
Great quarter for AAPL. More upgrades coming in the A.M.!!!
"All fund managers sold Nasdaq and all technology stocks at the last 10 minutes today because they want to lock profits for their companies and get a huge bonus for themselves by the end of February. They will buy back on Monday, March 1, then everything will go up to the same level or higher than before 10 minutes at close today."
Why woukd anyone sell at 118?
Why isn’t Apple getting credit right now for manufacturing their own chips during this shortage?
This may actually close green lol
Green at the close !
AAPL has decided in rise dividends!!!! buy buy.AAPL 225 is coming
"I hope we don't go over $132 by Friday because I don't really want to sell my AAPL shares off, but that's the strike price I sold my weekly covered calls at this morning because we were down so much. I hope we close out Friday at $132.99, and then I'll sell my next set of weekly covered calls with a $137 - $140 strike price."
Lol comical. Laughable how oversold now.
First 5min in green and then 125 with massive sell off to 122 and next week stop $119. Be smart. Don't buy too high
"As expected, the push in the last stretch of AH swallowed the 145 resistance level! Sleep well fellow true believers you deserve it as we'll look forward to some serious scorching tomorrow! Peace!"
Going to come the day soon that Apple is going to takeoff like a rocket and when that happens shorts get burned and stock ￼keeps going up it happens every year. Unfortunately it’s been a long time since it has happened.￼ it might have been no games in six months but four months from now it can return 30%. Just hurts when this happens.￼￼
Facebook working on a Smartwatch for next year. Who is worried?
Does anybody know why aapl is up today?
I lose 1500 a day when it .90 in the hole.. How is this stock really worth it.
Apple analysts are pretty good and forecast avg 175. Apple has corrected 18% after blowout earnings. Apple projected to increase TAM with car. Secular story intact.
told u guys it wud start on red and go to green panic sellers 
"AAPL is winning, so is OMER :[1] Narso approval July 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties. [2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by June, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end. [3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself. Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued, here."
Feb 26 options players do not wait until 1600 hrs.Historical prices indicate a $125+ close but there are always rogue players in our midst
"warren buffet was asked why, though it is so simple, no one listens to his investment strategy. his response: because no one wants to get rich slowly. if you buy aapl, buy it to fund your retirement; buy it to pay for your kids' college; buy it because you believe that it will continue to innovate... because it will do all of those things. just not tomorrow."
"Growth, growth, growth. Thank you Apple employees and loyal Apple customers!"

Big selloff in all tech stocks ... aapl approaching 20% from high .... bounce and new highs coming soon
Buy it up and hold. Anyone really believe this thing won't average higher than market returns over the next 10 years?
3 minutes to earnings. A bit nervous but optimistic.
"What was that, Apple cultists? You're telling me to ""Just wait until next week, Apple stock will pop right back up...""?Didn't you lot just told me that LAST FRIDAY?!"
Will APPLE CREATE A SEARCH ENGINE TO DOMINATE GOOGLE? Imagine if APPLE discontinued using and paying Google by creating iSearch. Apple has mentioned it as a possibility before. Can you say APPLE WORTH $5 Trillion......?!Long Apple
Our next stop is 119. Then 115. And final destination 104.
You would think someone like Warren Buffett would manage his portfolios in a more responsible manner.
"A Counterpoint report has stated that Apple managed to sell over 9.5 million iPhones in the US market alone in December 2020. This gave the iPhone 12 maker a huge 64% of the market share, leaving Samsung in second on 20%. Google managed to claw back some share thanks to the Pixel 4a and Pixel 5, but Motorola and Alcatel are firmly in ZTE territory."
Dr. Jereme Siegel is always right. He correctly predicted that we had bottomed in March 2020 and boy he was right. He is also bullish on/for 2021. He had a PhD in economics from MIT and is a very distinguished professor
nice work boys
"no update, no news, more secretive = $AAPL in the works... Do you see what I see? "
Having perused all the Apple coverage of late and been paying pretty close attention to the price movements...it's abundantly clear to me that there is an unprecedentedly aggressive and coordinated agenda to bash loose shares from weak hands...and in the face of that I get a warm fuzzy feeling each time I add.
"@68-69 will be the bottomThat’s the true support line Then , correct a rise from there a healthy reset is good to add more shares GL"
"Hi I am new here. I would like to get in and get little bit Apple stock in my portfolio. But to be honest, my ideal buying price is around 128$. Now is about 132$. Should I start a small amount today or better wait till Monday and see what’s going on ? Thanks!"
Besides making autos with other auto companies apple will also acquire a number of companies this year. $400 on its way by December 2021
one day doesn't define one year. apple will be $200 soon
Anyone else wondering why Analysts have not upgraded AAPL / revised their PT after earnings & blowout quarter?
VIX is down 4.38% a sure indication that Nasdaq and S&P will rise sharply. VXN is unchanged
dividend needs to be raise to attract new investors. aapl should trade above 200.00.
Apples hardware engineering chief steps down to work on mystery project? What’s that all about? Someone needs to ask Tim at the call tomorrow ￼

"When Warren buffett sold apple in december and bought Chevron at $84 it was a good move. Chevron is trading today at $105. He is already 25% in profit. And whoever bought apple 7 months ago, now is 2% in red."
"Apple will be up just as much as MSFT, if not more after earnings."
"South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd reported its highest quarterly profit in over three years on Wednesday, with help from increased shipments of Apple Inc's new iPhones."
"There we go, it is the end of the day, and the FED starts to PUMP the US Stock BUBBLE artificially!The US Market is EXTREMELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!DO NOT BUY US STOCKS IN THIS MEGA BUBBLE!The VALUATIONS ARE ABSURD!$AAPL $JPM $TSLA $AMZN"
"Apple may touch 135 and go beyond by earnings, it’s not unrealistic, apple went beyond 135 and fell back without any bad news about apple. Earnings are going to be great with immense 2021 projections. They got brilliant additions like MagSafe accessories, apple fitness services, apple chip and on and on.. I suggest buy the dip, this stock is not going to ditch you."
"Good for Apple. A wealth tax is long overdue. You simply add up the value of all of your personal possessions, home, cars, stock portfolio etc. and pay 2% of that every year. It’s long overdue. Vote blue in 22."
"I have the futures pinned on my I-phone it says the following:- Dow=unchanged, Nasdaq =unchanged and S&P =unchanged. Why? Because the future market does not open till 6:00 pm eastern time"
Just buy on the dips forefront of all things technology/health etc... 500 shares $33 to $109. Apple is next generations future.
Theres no reason to be invested in this anymore.. i think this will fluctuate between $115 and $145 for the next year or two
"Time for shopping folks, load up your cart and enjoy the juicy profit later this year when they announce the new EV"
A lot of shorts!! Luv it!!...we are going higher fast!
Apple is not the innovation it used to be.
anyone help me understand why Apple is getting hammered badly this past week after posting such a stellar earnings quarter?
"Ad David said. let's accumulate on AAPL at 0.40 cents . AAPL is poised to break 270 today based on his machine learning. I am buying before hours at 0.40 cents discount. I won't sell AAPL at all. 200 a share will come in Feb based on leaks he heard. Apple new car, new phones, new news will surprised today. Also, I am buying CRM, MCD at the opening."
"Apple is flying up. $120? No way, 111 billions sales for 3 months, just think about if"
"Remember March, 2020? We're back in a bear market."
When a company like Apple has so much money that it doesn't know what to do with it and is trying to return to cash neutral. That's a usually a good sign that it's a good investment.
Buy the dips and own Companies that look to the Future !
"Guys stop panicking, hedge funds sold due to last day of month. Monday will be good because they need to rebuy."
ive had it with the stock market im done. im selling everything im never buying stocks ever again.
"130+ after hours, bears party over lol"
Listen to how people are talking!! Apple is going to be fine. Hold don’t sell. Something big is happening for the better.
"Before some of you start attacking me, let me be clear that I'm long and I do own a respectable amount of AAPL shares. So GOOG crushed earnings, the stock is skyrocketing AH. Apple blew earnings to smithereens, the stock went down in flame and has not recovered much since... Literally WS is bearish on this stock and it will continue to do so, until Apple comes out and announces iCar."
"Apple Car will be a 100% Apple product. Outsourcing the car to a third party manufacturer is a brilliant move and will save the company billions in capacity build out spending. More importantly, it will allow them to produce 100K cars in year one. How long did it take Tesla to meet the 100k mark? Years because they had to build out their capacity and spend a ton of capital doing it. Hyundai-Kia has a firmly established global car manufacturing infrastructure that will allow Apple to scale rapidly. In addition, Apple will likely be working with other manufacturers as well. This is no different than Apple outsourcing the iPhone to FoxCon. Iphone is an Apple product, not a FoxCon.Most importantly, if reports are true that the car will be fully autonomous upon release, then Apple will be ahead of its competitors. Tesla has been promising fully autonomous for years now, but has not delivered. Combine this with their purported monocell battery, and Apple Car will be years ahead of its competitors in its first year of operations. Apple brand loyalty is unmatched."
"Trading inside a 401k is protection for short term trades !It’s nonsense to get Taxed, just because you execute a profitable short term trade ?If you don’t take the money out of that acct, it shouldn’t matter ?With a 401k it only matters when I take a Distribution !As it should be !"
THE MARKET IS UP 350 POINT AND AAPL ID DOWN $ 2 THIS STOCK IS DONE I TOLD YOU
"Talk is for a completely autonomous ev. Great, though I hope they give you the option to drive! To some it is still a pleasure"
Will close green as every friday!
After last 10 min on friday really don't know what to expect today. It can jump to 126 and last hour can fall to 120.
I don't know.. but it's looking more and more dangerous to be in tech.. $fb $goog $amzn $twtr $nflx $zm $tsla
"Looking to sell in the next few months only because I need the cash for a down payment. Ya’ll think I should do it right after earnings, or wait till March?"
"Remember when your mechanic used to give you stock tips back in 2007?Well now we have all these kids in Reels, TikTok and reddit etc. telling us how to invest our money...If it sounds like a bubble, smells like a bubble and looks like a bubble guess what. Nobody cares about earnings anymore, its all about printing and more money printing until they pull the plug..."
"ALERT:Skyworks beat estimates big time due to AAPL. Tomorrow, for a change AAPl will buck the downtrend and closes over 140. They made 111 billions in a Quarter. this is not Gamestop or Facebook. Chines new year and opening economy will take AAPl with the supercycle to 170"
I guess the reason the stock is in flatline mode is due to the fact that many investors are not happy with the direction aaple is heading in the car business. bummer.
I started investing in April since July 2020. It always drops and then jumps even higher :) I’ve seen it 4 times. It’s a little longer this time but it’s similar to the time it dropped in september / October 2021. Everyone back then said apple is finished. But you know what? It’s not. It’s making a lot of products. Lots of revenue. Lots of cash! They can even but a few islands and start an apple resort  so sit back and relax. We’ll be fine by mid March :) earnings also coming up soon
"Apple has always proven Doubters wrong for years, Future is only brighter with Apple getting into new market like AI & Apple Cars. The Apple Brand itself is the world's most valuable assets."
It will end higher today. Today Powell is the disruptor
You wished you had put your money in aapl back in March 2020.Don’t ignore this opportunity...unless you think the market will never recover and all of the fund managers who hold appl will just sit back and accept huge losses.
"Sorry it's down but since I wasn't pulling any money out of the market anyway, it's time to just not look at the accounts for a few weeks and go for a bike ride. Since AAPL is a solid company, I'd recommend you do the same since there are no losses until you sell."
"Apparently (from what I've heard), once we are all vaccinated, we will no longer use or purchase any Apple phones or services because we will be too busy having way too much fun. I'm selling all my Apple stock. It's clearly over. Putting all my money in Cruise stocks. Way better companies."
"Whoever bought on stock split 6 months ago, today is going in red."
"I kinda love this kind of trend - slow, steady and up !! Unlike the craggy zig zag from Tesla RIOT GME"
"When a dip like this occurs with AAPL, that has nothing to do with the performance of the company which was shown to be outstanding in their last earnings report, it's just a BUYING OPPORTUNITY!"
Wow great time to buy .
"Why is it when AAPL shareholders speak their minds that might not seem positive, they will get attacked. Mind you/attackers, whether a shareholder owns 1 or 10,000 shares it shouldn't make any difference. As shareholders, we have the right to say what we want about this or other companies out there, so long we own shares of those companies."
Apples stock price collapse has just forced me to pull my retirement papers. Time is not endless TO MOVE. Find some green now so I can get retirement back on track. Each $5 drop has added a year. Coming up on 4 years added in a few weeks. FIND GREEN. TOMORROW.
Apple  reports right around 430pm good luck to all remember long and strong
Me waiting for a green day like it’s been forever :(
"Is AAPL $145 yet? No? Ok, I'll check back next week."
"See that little graph to your right on the Summary Page? Click ""1M"". Theres your clue. and there are 12 easy reasons that I can point too that will cause it to go down another 100%. 12 that never fail and already in full swing...."
There’s gonna be a correction. Apple P/E ratio is too high for the markets currently. more downside to come
"People the last line on the release reads.....,,Apple in discussions with 6 other Japanese car manufacturers...lol so amazing how people just bypass that...lol"
"Amit Daryanani further estimates that Apple should be able to grow services at a 19% compounded growth rate through the September 2024 fiscal year, at which point revenues from the segment would top $100 billion. He thinks that will include $29 billion from Apple Music and $6 million from Apple Pay.He also expects Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ to gain transaction over the next five years, with 80 million to 90 million subscribers each. At $100 billion, he adds, services would be 30% of Apple’s overall revenue and 45% of gross profit."
Congrats to all shorties. Free fall all the way to 119. End of March 104.
"ok, what's the bad news? obviously good news has no rewards for aaple shareholders. so, what is it going to stake to stabilize the share price? I think raising the dividend would have a possitve impact for current investors and future investors ."
"Most of the stocks today fallen by 5-15% today including $tsla $amzn and $aapl. So no worries, it is going to go back to $30 when the market turn to normal. Take a break..."

"Oh my God article by Max Cherney in Barron’s dated February 22, 2021 “8 chip stocks that are still cheap in a semiconductor shortage “. When chips are selling so well that means the end products such as Apple which use chips are selling well ."
"Apple is creating a buy-in point. Let history be your guidance, Apple always erupts 2-6 days after earnings. Patience folks and you will be rewarded."
"this is not a correction of the major averages, but most high fliers are in a bear market already. dexcom, ring, zoom, nvidia, docusign, peloton, fastly, teladoc, Tesla. apple is down only 15 percent."
It’s hard to understand the logic of these AH sellers given the stellar results for Q1 by Apple across all performance benchmarks.
apple car would sell like hot cakes. get long
Pretty soon there will be downgrades as stocks are valued too high
Double the 10 day average volume and closed almost green. Sleep well longs
Stocks are cheaper now from six months ago. Hahahahahaha
A PE ratio of 34 is way tooooo expensive.....needs to come back to 6 or 7
What do you think Apple is gonna do with all of its dollars eh? It’s gonna buy the safest asset it can think of. Itself.
I have 574 shares of appl at 108. I planOn buying onThe dip tomorrow Thank you.

Apple is about average with the market situation today. Let see if it comes back up green a .01 that's the test todayTesla rolled right back yesterday and sunk afyer hours but digging itself fine now.Walmart is destroyed.
ever apple did something like +10%
Apple will rock this week!
When futures open at 6:00 pm eastern time my predictions are that the Dow will open at +200 points and Nasdaq at +85 points
It's not corrected yet. Bottom is around 94.
stock is down because of the giant options position at 135 expiring today
I just wish there’s no sell off prior to close :( this is very depressing :/
1 minute silence to those who sold their shares expecting a drop in last 2 minutes :-) :-)
All the Kia haters why would Apple go to a luxury brand they will not be able to meet the demand with supply. So they go with Kia and Hyundai as they can produce more vehicles that are also reliable. It also taps into the Asian markets.
Apple is the no.1 phone maker on the world again: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/apple-beats-samsung-in-phone-sales-for-first-time-since-2016/
Check TNX or rate on 10 year treasury going up last month. This is why all FAANG are down last month!I expect bleeding to stop on Friday and comeback in March/April.
If you crying baby’s are blind next 5 years will mileage step to the future next big jump in a tech and apple will be the biggest player in the game . No matter what price will be this week next week next month just buy buy and hold . It’s will be min 5x in 10 years
Guys I am new to stock market.. just want the experienced advise that is it still a better idea to put the money on Apple?
They just beat by 8 billion in revenue! That's more revenue the GME made all of last year LOL.
"European stocks looking good again today, hopefully another good day from AAPL again this week, will pump more into it at open who’s with me?"
"Analysts' up price targets seeing Apple at the forefront of digital transformation.. Best days ahead:Loup Ventures says Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) strong earnings report is evidence of the accelerating digital transformation in the fact that the revenue upside was driven by nearly one of the company's every product categories. Price target of $200.Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty maintains an Outperform rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and raises the price target from $152 to $164 after yesterday's FQ1 report.Huberty notes that the active device installed base (10% from 7% in last year's period) and customer loyalty is still above 90%.The broad-based revenue recovery in Greater China points to sustained higher engagement and market share gains, says Huberty.Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar (Overweight, $135 to $160) highlights the double-digit sales growth for all categories with the 17% Y/Y iPhone revenue boost indicating strong iPhone 12 demand. On the call, management mentioned that supplies remain tight for the iPhone Pro and Pro Max.Kumar notes that FQ1 gross margin came in well above expectations on the higher revenue and improved product mix, and Apple's margin forecast was largely flat for the current quarter.Evercore (Outperform, $160 to $163) says ""there is no need for Reddit mentions with a performance like this.""Analyst Amit Daryanani calls gross margins the ""sleeper upside.""The analyst thinks the lack of guidance for iPhone and Mac sales suggests material acceleration in those markets, offset by modest decelerations for Services and Wearables.Apple shares are down 2.4% pre-market to $138.64 in what is proving to be a notably volatile week for the Street.On the earnings call, Apple management said current quarter growth should accelerate on the year and follow typical seasonality on the quarter. The company said it expects Wearables deceleration in FQ2, coming down from those record holiday-driven sales.Background: Apple's FQ1 revenue hits all-time record as iPhone sales smash estimates"
How low is this going to go?
"I believe the Apple offering to the auto market will be a hardware unit suited to the level of vehicle installed. So when you buy an electric Ferrari it will come with a choice of Apple or Google interfaces, but the tech under the hood will be Apple. I do not believe that Apple will tie themselves to one car manufacturer and multiple contracts will exist. there may be a mass uber type self drive vehicle produced by Apple which is leased by cities en masse which you can call with your iphone whenever you need transport"
"Let me guess, today will be buy the dip day lol"
Is it possible that WS is selling great stocks to cover GME positions?
AAPL has printed $130+ twice as an intra day high.AAPL trades in trends of three 90% of the time
"Oh my God the stimulus package passes the House and I am hoping it will pass the senate but the democrats have a majority in the senate too. Markets will rocket to the sky come Monday March 1, 2021"
Farewell to $130 . . . forever.
"Apple #1 stock on Robinhood, hence, volatility."
$AAPL is going to have $100b in free cash flow this year. Remember that before you buy any other stock.
If you aren’t buying this aapl dip... well I just don’t know 
Beautiful closing!!
"Looks like the sell off will continue into Friday (today) sell your shares now and buy back in before market close and increase your position at least a buck or two per share. The correction is sure to continue up to as much as 115 then come mid March is expected to be back into the 130, 140’s"
"Law enforcement is unable or unwilling to protect you, schools are unable or unwilling to teach our children, infrastructure is unable to transport increasing levels of service. At least the government has enlisted help from Blueshieldto distribute vaccines."
"If the apple stock price is now lower then six months ago, that mean in september 2021 should be even lower. Why waste your money now, if you can save and buy same shares for less. Just need to wait."
"if today’s end red, which is likely. Out of the last 16 trading days, 4 have been green."
Aapl crushed it. Patience. The reward is coming.
DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY FOLKS. It will end higher today. Thanko
"The high-end innovative consumer technology in Apple’s roadmap, including its VR headset, is like no other, one-of-a-kind, and impossible to reproduce from competition without heavy investment. Even if it could be copied, it’s all carefully patent-protected. This deserves AAPL a much higher multiple"
super green in London atm..might open at 139 today and climb to 140
Simply one of the best companies on the planet you sell your shares i will be buying them.
Apple bites back! As my Granny Smith would say when she was living in Fuji. It’s all delicious amigos and a big gala. Hehe 
"Guys you have AAPL shares.. chill, have some faith we’re coming out of a pandemic. This is closest to the cheapest price you will see once this correction is done."
+3% in London
"I once read a quote, ""Even the sun shines on the back of a dog's a--""It's true! The markets rarely does not give every side a winning moment. Some are fleeting while others are long term.This will pass"
Two weeks from now we’ll be sitting at mid February levels like this never even happened I’m not sure what they panic is all about
AAPL to the moon !
Apple is up 4.91% to 127.21
"I know this is a long term hold, but I don't think Apple has been green for the past 2 weeks."
loosing money with this stock
perfect chance to buy today!
Seek help Sam !
"I sold yesterday 1700 shares. I shouldn't of. I'm getting back in today on any dip. I was up 30k, and it went down to nothing. Was angry. However, there has been so much going on Bitcoin, Tesla boom, and other quick money that took away fro Apples great earning release. Ending up losing 2k overall. If I would of stay would of been up 1.4k."
buy buy buy
"Know your audience!There are traders and investors here. Most daily messaging has to do with traders. Why? ""Everyone must wet their beak!""It can be confusing at times."
You can’t short Apple this will open $124 plus on Monday and will reach $130 by the end of the week
Newbs are mad Apple stock is following traditional market forces instead of their beloved reddit 1600 PE ratio stocks.
Can't believe you people didn't understand how a market would react to socialism...
Great buying opportunities... market down bc WB thinks is over valued and he’s parking his money into divy stocks like VZ and CVX. With the stimulus due and also reopening as the vaccine is showing the light at the end of the tunnel I picked up more AAPL and TDOC on sale.
"Re-open trades day. $AAPL and $CRWD are the only thing red today for me.Re-open, EV, Solar, Spac, bitcoins are all up.Lets hope that big tech sell off stops, AAPL valuation is great."
117 Friday
Elon proved how easy it is to manipulate a stock in this market climate
"Last week was the last time you’ll see $120, hope you took advantage"
"If true, is this the next meaningful catalyst for the share price, I wonder. “Ives put the chances at 85% that the tech giant would announce a relevant partnership or collaboration within the next three to six months.”"
How they could approve cook again as the ceo is beyond belief. This guy needs to change his style and support the shareholders. All of this secrecy over product development has to stop. They are always late to the part with new products. Time for Tim to retire
So much negativity retail is shorting into capitulation. Wouldn’t be surprised if we end positive today.
why is Aapl down?? we have so much cash
Take profits off your winners in the equities markets to buy bitcoin and then get fleeced on BTC and left with nothing. That appears to be the plan for the next transfer of wealth.
I can feel Tesla money starting to flow into Apple
Anyone seeing APPL soaring next week?
"If you’re selling into this profit taking, you will miss tomorrow’s run: all positive, new stimulus checks for the economy, COVID decreasing, businesses reopening, don’t be fooled."
Positive today....Green.
Once Cook comes out with an official statement on a car agreement Apple  stock will take off big time! Will you be chasing?￼
"FYI-Until the ""Up Tick"" rule is reinstated from the 2010 adjustment, ""we-us"" the little retail investor are at a extreme disadvantage to the big institutional investors, ie; Hedge-funds-ETF's-Shorts. The Clearing Houses and Market Marker's get all the inside information from the trading platforms way before we see or hear anything! The SEC needs to step in and revamp this rule so retail investors are on equal ground. This will not happen by it's self! We need to push for this! Here's an article: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.aspIn the mean time Apple is still one of the best investments available! $150 coming soon! Cheer's Longs"
"Guys, looking at total margin debt is totally ignoring how many retail investors have entered the market."
"We all know Apple has the brightest future, with the most promising innovation, and least likely to get a formidable competitor. Eventually the market will realize this as well"
AAPL is extremely undervalued. Stock should be around $150 if we didn't have a recent pull back in the market. Expect them to hit $150 in 2021. ZERO DOUBTS. GL!
"stock price still high.. pre split, this would equate to 480.. so 120 is good given the stock ran up to 500 split."
"They only thing going against Tesla cars is the price. Let's see how this batch of low priced cars turns out? We will see. Don't laugh Tesla, you don't want to compete with Apple, they are a giant."
$60 bill worth of Apple stock was dumped in final 14 mins of the trading day. Not a great sign for the market.
Hyundai/Kia builds quality cars as good as any car company. I’m sure they will build the AAPL Cars that will be # 1 and in high demand. GLTA

"Warren Buffett isn’t known to prognosticate on where interest rates are heading, but he warns fixed-income investors “face a bleak future.""“Bonds are not the place to be these days,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.His warning comes amid a sharp rally in long-term interest rates that saw the 10-year Treasury yield recently touch its highest level in a year. Though it's worth noting interest rates have been trending lower for nearly 40 years."
Someone unloaded almost 4 million shares at $130.16 today... just the narrative of apple. Has been for years
"Remember the three rules of Apple investing: 1) buy Apple shares, 2) Hold no matter what, 3) repeat"
Apple’s enormous cash position leaves me sleeping easy at night as I accumulate more shares with each dip.
For the first time I regret not selling at 140 
"march crash 2020 18.300now feb 2021 32,000 still no correction we areduefor ascaryscary 30 to 35 percentcrash coming months"
I am terrified that I am going to wake up one morning and see Apple down 50%. I never thought I would feel that way about this company but lately that’s how I feel. unless cook comes out and says something about the company I’m definitely cashing in a couple of thousand shares. too much invested to lose it.￼￼￼
10 years from now. These prices will seem like pennies to the dollar. HODL AAPL.
"AAPL better turn this around tomorrow. One ugly stock and acts like it is the worst company in the world, not the best. I maintain that the split was a huge mistake on Cooks part as it has only made the stock easier to hold down."
"Can you imagine if Apple comes out and says ""Hey shareholders, we have an electric car project and we are spinning that out to our existing shareholders. Each shareholder gets 1 to 1 share in the new co"". Now that would be spectacular!"
"Cathie Wood of the ARK fund dumped Apple and used that money to load up on Tesla. She knew she would get much higher returns from Tesla than she would from Apple. As far as she was concerned Apple is a washed up, low-growth company with no place in her winning fund. She's the new Wall Street darling stock picker praised for picking winners and dumping losers. So far, she's been right in her choices. Tesla is totally outperforming Apple over the last year, so Cathie Wood is the newly-crowned Queen of Wall Street.Does Apple still have what it takes to challenge Tesla this year? Cathie Wood says NO. It's going to take some Apple magic to pull some great product out of its pipeline to score a big win. Currently, Wall Street is in love with EVs, so it's going to be tough for Apple to change big investors' mindset with just a handheld device. If any company can make a miracle happen, it will be Apple. Warren Buffett vs Cathie Wood. Let the fight begin to decide who the top stock picker is."
Don’t worry! Apple will bounce back to new all time highs here soon. Apple is one stock I’m not afraid of owning in a recession!!!
"Long 3427 shares. Dear Apple cheerleaders the board is getting a little angry about the stock performance. Please repeat again, buy it don't trade it, Don't look at it for 5 years, I've owned it since Blah, Blah, Blah. Good luck people but that stock split, share price reduction enabled the manipulation of this stock. Funny though it had no effect on Telsa. This stock needs a good juicy leak about something good."
"Man this is great news!! Project Titan is soon to be!...since 2014 Apple has been working on Titan yet no one knew..., what a game changer"
"There is absolutely no reason in the world why Apple should be down if the posting world record profits this past quarter and the outlook is only Rosie, within a week this will all change when people realize this is the diamond it's always been and is going right back up!"
"Flipper, we are up over 20% in the 6 month chart, how dense can you be?"
Have to laugh at the IBD article under AAPL entitled “Dow Jones Futures: Be Ready for a Stock Market Rally Pullback or Melt Up”...they’re not covering all the bases; AAPL could just stay the same...
Told you all to relax :) next week will be even better. This thing will keep rallying until next earnings call 
New investors just look at historical prices to relax.You are witnessing a chess game between traders and option players
"Again, there’s no reason to panic on this stock. It follows technical analysis like a textbook and the company is extremely good on fundamentals. Even if it ends up red again today, I’m not concerned at all."
Let’s go to $136 nowww
Apple is just growing into its valuation. This just takes time.
APPLE is a muthaphukin trend setter as you all know already.. you wont see this price for very long!
"Cook: we're proud of our record as one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In the last four quarters dividends total over $14 billion, and since we reinitiated the dividend in August of 2012, our dividend per share has more than doubled. We think that's a strong statement about our commitment to growing shareholder income over time, and we plan for annual dividend increases, but we don't think that dividends are the only way that we can create value for shareholders."
Wow. Just wow. No bottom whatsoever. This could be $110 before we know it.
Will higher tomorrow and for the week
"Is it true that Apple has a 900 mile Electric Car Battery that takes 30 minutes to go from dead to fully charged? Is this where Elon Musk says “Well Played, Apple”."
I’ll be back at 9.30am: that when it all starts. Usually apple ends up green when it’s red pre market 
ALL APPLE STORES ARE NOW OPEN - 270 -- THIS IS GOING TO JUMP AGAIN TOMORROW.
We need to go to $138 today please
Any way i truly believe in apples n their technology who else would u rather bets on ??? APPLE BABY

Looks like this historic record quarter reality is starting to set in. In a few short trading days getting AAPL under $150 will seem like a dream.
"The factory will start producing 100,000 cars in 2024 with the ability to ramp up to 400,000 cars. Apple will get a new multiple along the way. Pushing the stock into orbit, Where are all the Cook bashers? Hehe "
"I SOLD ALL MY Apple , GOOD LUCK TO ALL."
I’ll be shocked if AAPL is not up $3 or more today
"Just saw the news about what is moving the chip equipment companies. It was on CNBC. ""The Biden administration will target chip shortage""!! There is going to be a MAJOR chip equipment spending cycle over the next 2 years. Great companies , strong balance sheets. It's still early....LRCX, KLAC, AMAT are the best companies in the space. Still a lot of room to run. This is why these stocks are up 7-10% today."
"Analyst EPS 5X next year. Apple Fi tech better than 5G, no WiFi required. Super long term stock"

Alright! Now we're talking!
there is a bubble and the only way out of this one is to make it bigger and people still can't accept the fact so they are offloading but it isn't going to help because the fed is going to keep printing cash with nowhere to go
Looks like all the money is coming back to tech
I don’t think I’m comfortable buying anymore dips. Simply because:1) I have no money money left for any more dips2) we’ve not seen a green day for a long time! In the last 25 days - we’ve had just 3 green days which is a little depressing.
"Patience is a virtue, Apple is the best company. Shareholder for 15 years. Long and strong"
just hold people...do not sell...all will be fine...u sell u loose.
It should break 138 today!!
"I hold, yet weep softly."
"The rumour of the Apple car is out, but Apple cant sit on it forever. The patient investor will be rewarded soon with a confirmation and a production plan from Tim Apple."
I know I keep writing this but the reason aapl is losing the last almost year is because of censorship we Americans will not stand for it. each individual phone has a way to block but when a public tech stock or company censors journalist and honest news to persuade a national election we say no . you don't get my $$.
I just dumped all my aapl stock and took a 2k loss. I made money previously trading Apple but now this stock is WAAAAY too complicated and manipulative for me. For the first time in a week I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight and NEVER look at Apple again. I'll get my 2k back elsewhere from a stock that makes more sense. Lesson learned!!! I'm also getting more afraid of the market bubble. Good luck to all of you that have more courage than me.
The way I understand this is that Apple isn’t rushing into the electric car business but rather making a fully autonomous car that will hopefully be ready in a couple of years. It’s a great idea. Will investors like it? Definitely is my thought
I hope this week sets off a bunch if algorithms and makes this stock pull a Tesla.
hahahahahahaha
The Fed say rates staying low! What gives? I hope Timmy is buying a boatload of stock!

"Icar: they won’t have to do this, but could you imagine a small discount for all Apple customers? 100,000 gone in five minutes....or less."
"Apple is full of surprises. Just as we were surprised to find out that they are actually making a car, we might be surprised to learn that it will be available for purchase several years sooner than most expect."
Been longing since 49.24 and keep buying when I see a dip. Easily beat the shyet out of all day traders in terms of yoy growth rate.
MAN it feels good to see green
I think we close green today.
Looks like the 10 year bond yield is lower. Excellent news for stocks
"That's according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. On Tuesday, Ives raised his price target on Apple stock from $150 to $160 -- but outlined a bull case for it to climb as high as $200. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 7% over the stock's closing price on Tuesday of about $124"
Probably goes green before noon!
Apple investor shareholder is tomorrow don’t sell
"Yesterday was the lowest volume since Dec 14th.It appears the action will centered around $135 strike price for awhile, going forward.As the ""Board historian"" I have seen AAPL do this over the years Sometimes this may last a month or even six weeks."
Lol now rates fall _ futures up 200 Back to ATH soon
"great new week  keep it, this month it can reach 145 $ "
I saw it trending south so I sold & went to $$$ - investing 101 - always protect your Capital- always
Advanced Modigliani technical analysis indicates apple will go through 140 for a 146 short term target
Anybody think we will see 140 this week?
Does anyone here ever plan to sell their shares of Apple? Or do they just plan on accumulating it until they die and leave it for somebody else to purchase the toys of their dreams?I'm just asking because everyone says they will never sell their Apple shares and hold them forever. No one ever talks about a long-term plan to accumulate and purchase something that they've always desired.
"Just remember that if Apple Car captures just 2% of the car market, that will be equal to its entire iphone sales. And we all know that Apple isn't going after a measly 2%. They're going all in."
If we close at $126 we are going to $130 tomorrow
Hedge funds gonna sell today? GME doubled in AH yesterday and it’s still climbing
Buying interest in Apple is now 92% in the pre market session 
"Bloomberg: Apple has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years and Apple has developed on its own most of the necessary software, underlying processors and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for such a sophisticated system...."
"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."
Apple gets a price boost to $160 from Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani who says the Apple Car will be 'a computer on wheels.'
AAPL has closed two times at $125+.Expect a third
"I am all for APPLE building a car but but are they really going to call it an Apple, who in the hell would want to drive a car called an APPLE. They need to come up with a more catchy name"
"Like Netflix, AAPL needs PE ratio of 80."
We need a Wall Street czar who can do oversight the trading irregularities. Apparently SEC is not capable of...
If Apple could pull in $110 billion this on Jan 27th earning report or about $6.47 p/shr. share price could hit $160.
Joe's job numbers are rolling in. it's just the beginning
"People are obsessed with tech shares, while they should be focusing on purchasing agricultural sector stocks... nobody is paying attention to them, but they're very undervalued."
$140 seems very far at this point 
I have 40 different stocks in my Fidelity account. 37 are green in pre market trading. Guess which one is not.
Just a quick calculation. Last week Apple was up $5.03 for the week. Remaining weeks in this year =46. If you multiply $5 with 46 you get $231. Add the current price of $137 and you get $368. I have been saying that Apple goes to $400 by year end. Remember I am just using the Random Walk Theory so don’t jump all over me you shorts and day traders . However I will stay with $400 by December 2021
The basis of my prediction is that yesterday was a bounce with a lot of the people who bought in the 120 area wanted some profits. It will head up again today
Told everyone this was overvalued and not safe. 6 months of doing nothing. It will be back at 75 bucks soon.
Not only are there open now - now moving into target stores- 17 stores to start
Markets are closed today
"If you want to invest in apple, wait for $119, otherwise you will hold the bag for long time."
AAPL to the Moon.
"The week before Thanksgiving I was saying I would be happy if Apple was $140 or so next Thanksgiving (2021). At the time it would have been about a $26 a share increase. Some people have recently posted about it not moving much positively recently. Its up a lot already. If you are a trader not a holder, this stock is probably not for you."
"Still pricy, boycott is alive and going forward"
Maybe it’s a good think Cook is keeping quiet! Something big is cooking at Apple . Long holders get rewarded ￼
You know why they told you to diversify your portfolio? Because you will always hold the bag in few sectors.
So Apple is trying on the shoes of several auto manufacturers. Soon there will be a partnership announced. Apple won't settle for a back seat. Sell if you must or cant stomach the volatility but know that Apple is not just a cell phone company and will reward its shareholders!
"the reason Buffett clarified his position about apple in his shareholders letter this morning was that I emailed him 2 weeks ago that I was highly concerned about his recent selling of apple stock. I told him professionally that he was suppose to be a buy and hold investor, and never sell mantra philosophy. lastly I am happy that he addressed all my primary concerns that I referenced in his shareholders letter today."
Apple's iPhone 12 Pro range to grow smartphone sales 50% worldwidehttps://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/02/apples-iphone-12-pro-range-to-grow-smartphone-sales-50-worldwide
"20-yr holder of Apple here again. Didn't you know that we had an 81-day lull between last Sept 1, 2020 ($136.69/sh) and the next high on Dec 28, 2020 ($136.87)? And the mid-lull loss was 20.4%? ($106.84 on 9/18/2020)And that was followed by a 16-day lull, to Jan 21, 2021 ($139.07)We're on day 17 of another lull. Don't be surprised if we lose 20% or more before it bounces back.AAPL Always Bounces Back."
Tony Balooga is right. Apple makes big runs. Buy it. $140
Anyone betting on Apple to at least get back to 143 - 145 range by end of Q1?
this stock is due for a bounce anytime soon
I've said it before but worth repeating .... This Company had nothing but AMAZING news for months and just trickled up even with the best quarter in HISTORY ! A whisper of ANYTHING negative and people run for the hills !! I'm not selling a single share !! Wall Street knows this a 200 a share stock and they are manipulating it down to buy back in cheap . Not fallin for it ..Greatest Company in history !!
"Tools were rediscussed today that had been previously hundreds of times before over the past 12 years for cash flow and how to ""Make lemonade out of lemons"".It does not help to complain but to ""take what the markets offer"""

Why should anyone listen to longs after this
"Apple will become the defacto standard for cryptocurrency transactions, with its access to world-class software and a secure ecosystem. Apple will become the leading ubiquitous platform individuals use to acquire crypto assets, handling the know-your-customer laws and other regulations with Apple offering a closed system that prevents nefarious activity, improves asset security, and has instant access to buyers and sellers."

Here we go again. Apple will plummet as hedge funds have to have cash to cover for their losses again on Gamestop. GME UP $60.00 today. So far!! This market totally out of control.
"I read where the child tax credit will be raised and then paid out monthly in advance.If they started paying out the EIC monthly as well, that in theory would keep people from starving and help with monthly bills too?That’s money your paying out anyway.That would however cut down on bigger purchases with big tax return checks but if I know America, we’ll just charge that bling bling and worry about the bills, monthly ?Lol"
Before making any decisions when it comes to Apple keep the record earnings in mind and remember the innovative pipeline they are going to churn out ! There is so much Upside to Apple stock over the next 5-10 years so buy and hold people ! People power can squeeze out the parasite shorts !
"There you have it, AAPL was in a downward trend for weeks. I sold yesterday, it goes up!"
we cannot even keep two green days in a row....who is selling at this point...
"Has anyone checked ""the coiled spring"" ?It might have been stolen.AAPL under 100 next week. Then resume buying."
Very nice. I keep adding whenever it hits in the low $120's. . Just buy and forget . thank me in 2027 .
Fasten your seat belt.
Apple should be trading around $200 based on current 2022 forward earnings....mid 30s PE at forward 2022 eps
I think July 4th will be “Masks Off” day. 85% of the population will have been vaccinated or already had Covid by then. The economy will come roaring back. Invest for this.
200M more shares bought back and retired. Apple can buy back half its market value in 8-9 years
"Just be patient, it will bounce back soon and will bring new ATH eventually!"
"LOL...Apple longs waiting for 3pm, 3:30pm and 3:50pm thinking “up”...?"
Flat for the 6-8 months
Apple shares are used to Manipulate the Dow both ways..This stock won't move 15% in a year. it is only good for trading short term..
Come on baby $126
HOW is apple 120$?! Thanks for the discount i'm buying lol
The stock market is an online casino
Friday doesn’t bode well for market or Apple. I expect more bleed.
"Today is non farm payroll report. The biggest market moving news event. If it beats expectations market will go up big including Apple if it misses, market will tank including Apple."
If this can break thru $125ish next resistance $130. The 180 day chart is spot on. The bounce off $120. goes back to 11/09/2020. And it was lucky we bounced next stop was low $ teens.
which car companies will be partner ship with Apple? Nio or Toyota?
Sorry I’m confused. Why is everyone commenting that they should exit tomorrow? Sorry I’m just wondering if there’s something I am missing. Comments from the likes of Da Vinci and B is appreciated:)
After 50 days nothing much has been done . Stimulus bill has not passed and Social Security including reversing the windfall elimination tax has not even come for consideration. Meanwhile our beloved seniors and our beloved handicapped are waiting to see a S.S. Reform and are passing away ( like one of my great friend did last week Monday )
"Pot stocks selling off, my guess profits buying Apple . Everyone knows it’s the best stock in the world"
Sold all my apple today at $123. Glad I did.
I sayeth it is going to over $200 soon. The folks in the office next door namely the shorts and the day traders are scrambling to cover. One namely BJ actually told me that this aint a time to go short any longer. Thanko
"Almost a perfect ""V"" today. I guess algorithm players needed to reload?Intra am high was $134.77 then a $3.30 dip to $131.40 but then almost a $4 rally to $135,47.Tomorrow IF there is no dip AAPL could rally $4+ as was suggested pre-market today.No harm but WE posted ""No am dip."" WE need to do better! Algorithim players did well and stock closed up $2.18"
Bloomberg: Apple in active talks with multiple LIDAR sensor suppliers for self driving vehicles....
"Wed January 27, 2021, 8:19 PMSamsung Net Profit Misses Estimates After 5G iPhone’s Debut(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s profit missed analysts’ estimates and the company warned of weaker first-quarter results as smartphone competition intensified and memory prices remained weak."
"Easy to hold when you are in your 20’s 30’s even 40’s but in 60’s and in 70’s where your savings are in the stock market your ceiling of tolerance is not as high even with the safety net of a great stock as AAPL. just look at yesterday and today, truly a disappointment. So regretfully my wife and I will be faced with a decision to hold or sell APPLE tomorrow. We truly hope for a positive AAPL day as it will postpone any forced exit from this great company."
"I am accumulating on AAPL every 0,25 cents. I am stealing and eating hedgies prey. I know they will give up in their game. SHORT SQUEEZE is coming. 150 breakout is imminent. Q3, Q4 record sales history and this price? hold tight your hourses. They will be in desperation soon who cover first in a big fight. You seat and buy more if drop"
Couple of highlights I took from the call. Luca (CFO) wouldn’t give any guidance BUT he said that March is always the best month for Apple Services. Which also their highest margins. So that bodes well. Also Tim wouldn’t call it by name but it was obviously what he was talking about when he said they are going forward with some very exciting new product. Can you say Apple Car. Any news coming out or Cupertino in the next month or two about Apple Car will have the stock soaring. Cook just needs to utter the word car and the stock will take off. Hehe 
Thumbs up if you still believe apple is worth minimum $150 a share
Don’t sell longs! Hold
"Strong Sell, the market has clearly signaled this Tech Bubble 2.0 is Starting to explode, Get out while you still can, tomorrow will only be worse."
"Todays action tells you how fast this stock can go up or down! I am not saying the correction is over, no one knows that, but this can also happen on the upside which will make $150 a cake walk when its ready."
"Always Don't think just back up the truck in time like this For Apple, Apple has proven time and time again over past 2 decades to burn Doubters. Load up before too late, It's Apple !"
Dow futures down big ...Nas futures up big. All $$ flowing to tech today.
The 10 year treasury note is up almost 10% today. I guess that is what this is all about
I guess the apple cart has a flat tire.
Thinking of selling my AMZN shares and buy AAPL leading up to AAPL earnings then selling on the news and putting money back to AMZN for their Feb 2 earning release. Sensible?
"Aapl being sold off to pay for short covering of amc, gme, bb, nakd, ino, srne and others."
it is a time to buy buy buy
"Apple car, 5G leader and super growth in China should see Apple at $200 ps soon."
"Too big of a Bubble, AAPL will become the next GE, same stage of pre-2008 GE was Biggest company of the world pre-2008 then falls off dramatically."
"Feb 25, 2021... 124.68... 126.46... 120.54... 120.99... 120.99... 147,306,500Feb 24, 2021... 124.94... 125.56... 122.23... 125.35... 125.35... 110,691,500Feb 23, 2021... 123.76... 126.71... 118.39... 125.86... 125.86... 157,859,100IF tomorrow AAPL can rally out of the open without a am dip it can easily see a $5 to $6 play.THis would translate into 100 to 500% on algorithim play"
Smart money sold a long time ago. hahahaha
Why Apple selling bonds when they have 76 B cash?
For me it’s look wirde. It’s will be aian few red days on all tech stock not becouse of correction but becouse they will have to get money from slow growing sure stocks to cover GameStop short positin . This happened last time
AAPL and MSFT made tons of money before and during the pandemic and will keep making tons of money after the pandemic. Stick with the best is my advice
"What a company APPL is. 28.8 billion profit on 111 billion revenue. More profit than Netflix entire revenue, 6.64 b. AND DISney total revenue ( 20.86 billion ) combined this Quarter. APPLE is a money making juggernaut folks, make no mistake ! FMV $180-200 price is coming. Soon."
This might run now especially news on dividends and the low was 118 which I missed never looked at the markets yesterday but if this gets into 128 then it’s moving Pennies won’t move this to the next level especially if Nasq is up today
My cost average is $25 and I'm not even considering selling a single share....stay in the game folks...AAPL hasn't let me down in years...
Does all of this matter in 10 years?
Good volume before market. I think huge upside coming today for Apple. It’s being talked about in Reddit’s wallstreetbets.
Aapl will never buy btc or tsla because they dont need to invest in fraud to deflect from their wonderful business
Not really sure what tomorrow is going to bring in store for us :/
Apple is out of favour. Great time to be buying!
This is comical dumping. That’s all it is .
Apple just released news on the ICAR Analyst Says ‘Apple Car’ Could Generate $50 Billion USD in Revenue by 2030
"Hey guys, who did aapl dip the last minute? Seemed like a sudden drop last minute..."
Don’t be surprised if pre market turns positive prior to bell. I really expect AAPL to gain some of last week loss. In fact this is going to be a positive week. And February a strong month. Positive Long.
"Kinda tired of appl. Gonna sell a lot of my shares when it reaches the $140 mark. Growth has been terrible for 6 months, and I figure it has something to do with the post pandemic increase, which was one of the most disproportionate increases I’ve ever seen."
Well ! Shorts are scared now even before the spike ...Expect a 10 - 15$ rally in couple of weeks ...you will loose everything if you think it’s going to 100$
Is there anyway apples hitting $140 before 4pm today??
"if you looks whole history, the worst kind corrections they have is bout 15% to 25%, we had our 20% correction already, even if it goes to the worst scenario, I dont see it breaks through 110, but more likely it will challenge 131 first"
AAPL at $145 by Friday.
"Most people on this board are probably day traders. Apple will ALWAYS perform in the long haul. Be patient and in 20 years, your retirement will be beautiful. I have owned Apple since 2007 and am a very confident and happy shareholder."
"Looking back on the last 4 earnings release, only one time was there a slight pullback the next day. I think it was April’s. Very slight, the other 3 were up the next day by 3-9%. So I’m thinking $148-$150 at closing bell Wednesday and a $158 close next Thursday."
"No retail investor is buying Apple for a 21 cent dividend UNLESS he holds a huge position. You are buying for stock price appreciation, not dividend."
"I am not selling, it has nothing to do with diamond hands. Apple has innovation, loyal customers and a fine ecosystem."
I thought today was going to be a relaxing day. Instead down another $4k pre-market. This stock has absolutly lost it's shine. No longer interesting to anyone just dead money now for a FULL 6 months.
"I'm normally not a disciple of Yahoo Finance but if you view AAPL there you will see that Apple's outlook for short, midterm and even long term is NOT GOOD. Their color rating rating bar as to valuation also lists Apple as HIGHLY OVERVALUED. Accordingly, I'm taking my loss ASAP and moving to another target."
"Fast growing, bad valuations stocks; Tips for old farts like me:1. Diversified, Diversified, Diversified.2. Buy stocks in 100 shares lots, not options because premiums are huge.3. Sell covered calls options, used the cash to diversified.This allowed me to participate in EV, Solar, SPACS, Bitcoins and cash in each week or each months with the covered calls. $AAPL, $MARA, $TSLA, $DRIV, $TAN, $RIOT, $BLNK, $BEEM, $SI, $MOGO, $GBTC, $BTCC-U.TO, $BEEM,"
This stock won't make you millionaires
"Holding through this pullback, any guesses for those who hold until 2030?$300 is my target."
This news on store opening and Target should run into the 130s especially when Senate today approves the stimulus the rest of week will make markets run if vote happens after market closes then another 800 upswing tomorrow
apple will be at 201.46 at the end of the year. something big is happening. 118.39 is the bottom for the year.
what's everyone's thoughts for tomorrow??? I would like to hear. Please answer if you can. thanks
Another day of Not capitalizing on green markets. Disgusted with this action.
Big rebound expected for Monday morning.
Buy more AAPL shares! Jesus saves. JESUS SAVES!
Should see a nice bump tomorrow! Both Amazon and Alphabet had earnings beats. Apple should see a ripple effect from their earnings beats?
When I saw the movie with Bruce in it (he was a flying tax cab driver) I laughed at the concept. Never the less the movie was very nicely made (my opinion). Now that concept is taking shape. Avoid the highway and fly. Apple will play a huge part in this concept. Drones are already carrying goods to and from . Chip Technology will play a huge part in all this . Chips are in such short supply on account of their expanded usage.
I ain’t selling! This thing did $111 billion in one quarter! Nothing short of a Mona Lisa when it comes to the execution of a masterpiece brilliance of Apple. Deserves a much higher multiple!
Stop trying to stop the second doses of the Pfizer Vaccine. Do the job right. Stop messing with people who want to get back into the economy.

"Shanghai , Nikki and FTSE up pretty big time while the entire Asian and European up. All in green territory a sure indicator as to where we are headed"
Honestly people only complain about the stock price because they got in after the split. People that have been in this stock for years seen massive gains.
Most stocks are making a come back today but Apple sitting at $129+.
Been through two bear markets and they start when companies report great earnings but they sell off anyway. Hope this isn't the case.
"Apple staying good above the 50 days MA and 100 days Ma, 200 Days Ma For the Longs Apple is going to continue to Grow. For Day Traders you better go and play something else if you want more up and down. Good luck to all, I buy more each time Apple Dips."
I don't really care if the price goes up after earnings report because I'm not selling any of my shares for at least 5 to 7 years anyway.
"""What did you learn about the border today Mr President "", ""A Lot'-There you have it from CNN. He had no clue what was going on."
People will buy Apple today. Like Disney and McDonalds. Comfy and feel good stocks. :)
If you are waiting for the bottom to drop out on this you will be disappointed. This isn’t some fly by night company here. When has Apple not came back and made highs? It always does
Stock hasn’t done anything so far this year. Down a little over 2 percent year to date.
Apple expected to post its ever first-quarter with more than $100 Billion revenue Wednesday!!!!WAY TO GO APPLE!!!!
And we have 3 full days of trading before earnings $. This is more exciting that being a kid on Xmas morning
Market during the pandemic has done great!! Now as the pandemic has disappeared the market crashes??? 
"on a technical basis, apple has broken down right now regarding its 50 day moving average."
AS COVID HOSPITALIZATIONS DECREASE AND VACCINE ROLL OUT AND GAMESTOP BUBBLE BURST. AAPL CAN JUMP 10 -12 POINTS
Future is looking bleak the empire is collapsing
"This should of went up at least $20 . I use there phone and there products are the best quality . They crushed earnings , what's going on here ."
Happy earnings eve apple fam 
How much dividend increase are we talking about here?
Have we not seen this “V” pattern in the past 23 days ?? Same algorithm nothing changes ...disappointing February..
Can there be 2 positive days in a row? Can't remember the las time that happened.

YouTube rumors as well. $CCIV Lucid Motors Partnering with $AAPL Apple!?! - YouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vbtiIr6Ev8
Not only it was a blowout... But Apple is still in the ‘early innings’ amid strong 5G iPhone sales. 1Q 2021 is going to be yet another blow out! That is with discounting any announcing regarding iCar.
You new investors are pansies looking for overnight returns. I'm old and am still investing for at least 5 yrs out. Worked for me these last 50 yrs!!!
"Well you all shorts better be prepared for whats coming. ZACKS say apple is now a strong buy. Previously, it was buy."
"I think, soon $AAPL price will be reach to 182$! I’m in long too!"
"20-yr holder of Apple here again, with some more analysis of past data. Let's focus on periods where the stock price didn't produce a new high for over 6 months (120 trading days). Since December 13, 2000 (my first purchase of AAPL shares), there have been 7 such periods:5/21/2001 to 3/5/2004, 712 trading days (3 years!), with a 50.7% loss inbetween (4/17/2003)Any sane investor may have bailed in April 2003, having lost half their money by then. But it recovered so well, the stock split x2 on 2/28/2005...one year after the new high. The iPod was coming into its own.2/16/2005 to 8/12/2005, 123 days, with a 24.3% loss inbetween (5/12/2005)Surprising, after the split on 2/28/2005, the stock went into a lull, bottoming out in 5/12/2005, but recovered by 8/12/2005.1/13/2006 to 11/16/2006, 213 days, with 40.8% loss inbetween (7/14/2006)People were getting bored with the iPod. The hype of the new iPhone rumors drove the price up going into 2007's iphone release. The price rose throughout most of 2007, more than doubling by 12/28/2007, but then the next lull happened...12/28/2007 to 10/21/2009, 457 days (almost 2 years!), with 60.9% loss!! (1/20/2009)Again, lots of people bailing out on that tailspin, but Apple was starting to overtake the iPhone market with its 3GS. This was the heyday of Apple, because we didn't have another extended lull until...9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, with 44.4% loss (4/19/2013)I think Steve Jobs' passing had a lot to do with that (Oct 2011), but they did introduce the dividend in June 2012. There were some gains in that 480-day period, but they never reached the previous high. Still, it didn't revover until the announcement of the June 2014 x7 stock split.2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, with 32.1% loss (5/12/2016)Another two year lull...but only 32%. And now the last one...10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, with 38.7% lossBy this time, today, in 2021, I don't care about lulls. APPLE ALWAYS COMES BACK. AAPL had that 31% drop with the COVID stuff in 2020...only lasted 70 days or so...who cares? Golden buying opportunities, all of them!The moral of the story: APPLE ALWAYS RECOVERS. I see people here lamenting that it hasn't gone up every single day since the latest split, lol. We hit 142 recently, and that's PROBABLY going to be a new high for a while! Look, we're due for another lull. And that's OK. If you're a smart, patient, long-term investor, you'll be fine, and you'll be buying more soon, lol."
It’s really funny to watch how people are crying about small correction . If you planing to hold apple very long 3-5 years it’s only buys opportunity’s for thouse few weeks so enjoy the raid and buy some more .
"What Apple really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Apple (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Apple just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Best company in the entire world! 150 before Next earnings!
"I am glad the week is finally over...all tech investors lost 2 years life expectancy compared to 1 yr as reported during covid. On the contrary, Wall Street people will be living longer as they stole our money. Just sad..."
It's time to bring out the thoroughbred again....Giddy-up Apple!
Deep in red whoever bought 6 months ago. Good to have money in the best company in the world.
When 110$? lol
"WITH AAPL STORES OPENING UP , STIMULUS CHECKS, CHINESE NEW YEAR, AAPL UP 6-8 TOMORROW. THX FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT. MANAGEMENT"
See ? The sell off is premature there was no real reason to sell aapl off at this rate.Now is the time to hold.Let this baby get back in at the least neutral territory.
Been hearing 145 -150 since Sep
"Same thing happened when Buffet sold about a million shares a while ago, this is just a game, that's all! Would not be surprised to see a comeback by end of the day! also, big options expiration on Friday, so the action does not surprise me."
122.09 is the 200 day moving average. I will be 99.2 % invested in apple by that point. it won't go lower than 122.
"Hedge funds are desperately pressing the price down by selling off their stakes in ""good"" companies like $AMZN, $AAPL to cover their losses. I am buying these as well LOL."
This is the time to test your true loyalty to this company. As for me and my house we are holding long !!
"Why does Apple’s cloud pale in comparison to MSFT, Google, and AMZN?"
"Those that bought like me on the ATH, don't panic sell. Apple has always bounced back to reach new ATH."
I thinkit it is normal for Apple to act like it is doing. But remember last year also it took off and yes it will take off again. Thanko
Great days ahead of us. You will start seeing a buying spree. Keeping money under the mattress or in a bank will not do anything or much for you hence the bankers are rich. They take your money invest in the market and get huge returns while they pay you about 0.75% annual interest. Get out and invest so you can see your money grow
Stimulus package passes the house. Very positive affect on the market come Monday
All you new ‘young’ get rich quick ‘investors?’ You have lost nothing unless you sell. Exactly what Wall Street expects you to do. Investing is long term not one week.
Let AAPL bust $136-$137 by Friday. I got the $130 calls to cash in on.
"In Frankfurt the current price is $127.50. Hope, today it will reach $130 in US!"
If it didn’t fall below 120 - that was your sign!! But now or buy later at 150
Wedbush $200 target. Wedbush's Dan Ives has always been right. Believe him.
By the time the sheeple get done selling AAPL buy value stocks they will be overvalued. Then what will they do--analysts will then say buy the fallen tech sector. Such games but just buy and hold long term --ride AAPL's cash machine over the years and forget the ST WS noise!
"Look at t our old reliable road map...historical prices.As posted yesterday, when it was $133+, every time AAPL dips to $133 as an intra day low. it runs to $136 to $137 the next day.Algorithim players want AAPL higher this am...it may gap aat the open"
No red tomorrow! Green all the way
And you thought Reddit was collusion. This sell off in markets was initiated by systematic COLLUSION from hedge funds and institutional funds. This isn’t one fund that said today is the day. The SEC is worried about Reddit and GME. LOL.
But but but the 5G supercycle!
This flux in price you are seeing is a hedge fund buying up shares of apple for apple’s buy back program. They shake the tree and get shares then apple buys them and retires them. You didn’t think apple buys them with an E*TRADE account did you. How else do you think apple get all those shares bought back?
"The UK government’s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is to purchase 11,000 iPhone SEs."
Bought 300 at 123.80
Weak hands always throw in the towel at the wrong time. Then come back months later bemoaning the fact they sold and they coulda/woulda/shoulda have 1000 shared at the then current $300 price level. Jeje 
Go outside trade for 2021. If you are stuck on stay at home then you might underperform.
One's nature!Today for a third time AAPL intra day low was $134+.Now it needs to print $136+ as an intra day high since it had printed tow already
I added to my long position that has been growing since my first buy in 2016. I have been waiting for a pull back like this to add. Messes up my nice and low cost basis but this is my best and largest holding. Glad to throw more money into it on the pull back. Long core holding and best stock next to my amazon and microsoft and LAM Research.
"Should open strong, dip a little before noon, then go higher in the afternoon into the close."

"I’m listening to this conference call right now. All sounds amazing, but stock not moving ..."
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
We will see $142 this week!
I been waiting to hit my target which was 120 and now guys I’m confident for uptrend and I bought all options thankfully I’m 250% up and it will raise more I didn’t wanna talk before cuz I don’t wanna be the bad guy but facts speaking and charts never lies
Cash on the sidelines will eat this alive in the first 30 minutes. Expect a head fake at the open.
"Notice how with mathematical precision, AAPL gets algorithmically constrained to a tight range, always in the red, every Friday?? It’s like the strawberries..."
"To newbies of AAPL. Don’t be intimidated by negative posts, they are by short sellers and those with other motives too long to list. Hold long and be assured you will not regret it."
Apple is known to under perform post split! Give it some time and this stock will be back to 500 a share.
Rumored talks with several auto manufacturers may signal Apple has something they may all want to incorporate into EV vehicles. Never underestimate Apple.
That spike at close was the big money manipulators giving us a signal — AAPL up big tomorrow. This is the week — same big week as last year
"just hold on it, don't believe on short-term, play long term and gain much more up for me 27% Keep it till end % it will double your money soon. long term,"
3 weeks straight of going down of course only when i first buy it
"Apple is a really simple stock. Buy and hold forever, buy more if you’d like and just continue holding. There’s no point in watching it or fretting. Remember there were bears all over this stock when this was $140 PRE split. Save the sleepless nights for the Apple bears."
house passing bill means nothing the senate already rejected it based on the min wage which was supposed to be stripped out I am still bullish on apple
This pullbacks getting BrutalShaking out the weak hands then fundamentals will take Apple longs to the moon 
If $aapl apple can hold 120 and $amzn 3100 it will be positive. $tsla is going to 200 and $fb might be green today as it was first to top
Got a good feeling longs will be treated tomorrow!
Look at the volume on the $130 calls and look at the price action and people say this is not related to options!
"Ridiculous pricing. How can you not buy the dip. One of the safest smartest lucrative buys out there rn. Set and forget!Long or short term trader, Apple is mission critical to for ones portfolio ... although I reco long for the real wins. GLTA "
This was never gonna be up today. The stock is consolidating. This takes time.
There is a head and shoulder top on the nasdaq and it is breaking support. Algos are about to trigger SELL SELL SELL.
Down on a low volume day. For the record: AAPL got sold off over 10% after posting the greatest earnings report in the history of capitalism. And GME stock (company is in pre foreclosure) went UP 140% What does that tell you about the market? Of course a rhetorical question...Market hates Apple right now. This can last for a month or more. But when she breaks– it will be fast and furious.
"This was good years ago , and I like buy Apple products but I’m tired of watching sticks fly by everyday while this sits at 120 something for months. Yeah we know you have 5000 shares you in 1990 so your holding"
stock needs to drop under 100 for attractive returns.....unlikely soon as too many are invested in this stock and most anchor to most recent high of 145.
I put limit buy orders at $125 every day. Looking out long term 20 years. I’m only investing in AAPL this year
"This seems to be retracing last year’s chart in the Feb and March timeframe which worked out pretty good, so I’m up for a repeat!"
"that's the last time we'll see 123 for awhile lads, I hope you loaded the boat"
"Lately AAPL could cure cancer and still drop in price. Not sure what this market wants from them, but they are obviously not giving it to them."
"Great day, hope tomorrow is better! GLTA"
Tomorrow =this week Alphabet and Amazon will beat all expectations and take the market to the sky . The saying used will be “market rocketed to the sky “.
how long does the down trend continue!? AAPL is way oversold
WHY? Is this for real? This stock cannot hold a gain since earnings.
The market just likes to do this a few times a year. No biggie.
"The market absurdly associated AAPL with TSLA today...due to their parallel stock split. Once this misguidance gets resolved, AAPL corrects back up"
"There’s already an Apple Nissan dealership in York, Pennsylvania"
I think Apple should start it own crypto coin and give shareholders one coin per share to get things started.
"Once reality sets in, people will flock to get more Apple shares. Everything is funky right now but make no doubt, Apple is a cash machine! Like money in the bank."
I was skeptical of the theory that hedge funds are selling Apple to cover their enormous losses on Gamestop. But it makes sense. Apple is the biggest holding for theses hedge funds and they have been forced to cover billions in losses. Same thing is going to happen today based on the huge premarket surge in GS.
Apple goes through periods where the market appears toHate it and is unloved. And sort of just consolidates in a range before it rockets higher. I think we are now in that period sinceWe moved from the previous consolidation around 116 to the new high 145. We are consolidating now in the 130-135 range
"EXTREME, MASSIVE BUYING ORDERS FOR TOMORROW. OVER THE WEEKEND, AAPL WILL HIT ALL TIME HIGHS ARTICLES. IF YOU CAN GET IN BELOW 130, YOU ARE LUCKY"
"aapl is good, my mistake was only adding a bit today, I hold 1/3 dry powder xp"
It’s still $1 higher than it was a month ago. I wouldn’t be “backing up the truck” like some fan-boys are posting here. Smart traders wait for upside momentum before adding more
apple's biggest losing streak ever in the last 5 years. don't expect a positive day for 5 more days.
What do you think Apple stock will be worth in 5 years and 10 years ?
"Buffett lightened up on Apple at the end of 2020, but it's still his biggest bet. And analysts think it's still a good place to be.Shares of the iPhone maker are up more than 60% in the past year to 126.29 a share. That easily tops the S&P 500's rise. And yes, Buffett trimmed his position in Apple by 6% in December. But it's still a massive $115 billion position for Berkshire as it owns more than 5% of the company.Recent weakness only makes it more attractive to analysts. The stock is down nearly 5% this year. Analysts, though, think it will be worth 18.2% more, or 149.33, in 12 months."
"we got to go along with many that are asking the great T. Cook , what have you done for us lately??"
"with as many shares to trade and making profits swing trading, exactly why is there any incentives for Apple to have any sort of real movement to the upside?"
60k down in 6 days and counting !!!!
I sold all my shares with apple saved my money
Is Apple’s drop today a buying opportunity?
#AMC - Majority of US AMC Theaters are now open at 40% Capacity. AMC will start showing profits within the second Quarter. AMC target price within 2 Quarters will be $10. This is based on 0 dividends. Short Squeeze will be highly likely. $TSLA $NIO $GMC $NNDL $AAPL
Flat. I’ll take it. Now we move onward and upward. Earnings days at $&#@. Always beat up tech stocks.
If stimulus passes
"I don't own any AAPL devices,but I love the stock!"
Bought a January 29 170 call option. Feeling pretty optimistic this cracks 170 after earnings. Thoughts?
I remain amused.
Traget $150
Why is Apple up 3.00 after hrs
Well there goes our green day :/
What if the expected revenue is 100b and Apple reportedly came in 110b? Will the share price up 10% 
What an amazing buying opportunity. Didnt think I'd see low 120's again
You like money? Buy Apple.
"Stock hasn’t done anything, stock price was the same around August."
Max pain for longs today its a blasphemy that this was even up yesterday
"Meh. Bill sold, Warren sold.You Bill or Warren? No.Solid company with best of class management?Yes.Thor has spoken."
Bill Gates sold half of his holding in appl and Warren Buffett sold a big amount of his so they don't see much growth at all in appl. Appl should be around 105 right now so its way overpriced and will probably be around 103 in a month if not sooner.
"My bet is that at some point if this bs continues, then companies like Apple COULD end up going private again. I guess that's why they keep the cash pile"
I thinkit we will see a great week ahead. WOW what a turnaround late yesterrday and the shorts and the day traders were screaming as beloved darling Apple turned positive. I think some of them missed their trains going home to mama (they call their wives mama and husbands papa) . Yo bro shorts and day traders listeen to me and do not short Apple next week or ever again. Thanko
@Annie shush. how many times will you be wrong about apple?
"At its Q4 2020 call, Apple confirmed $64.7 billion in revenue, a record September quarter: Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2020 fourth quarter ended September 26, 2020. The Company posted record September quarter revenue of $64.7 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $0.73.2 days ago￼iMore › apple-could-announce-...Apple could announce first-ever $100B quarter at January ... - iMore"
I really hope all 4 Network News shows lead with the “Ted Cruz flying to Cancun” story. He should resign tomorrow. Non Negotiable.
The fact that Tesla rebounded quicker than apple is shocking since there earnings was nothing compared to MSFT fb and apple
This better find green tomorrow. I don’t care what the options do or the markets.

Daniel Ives raises AAPL to $175.
"APPLE is only a ggod looking stock on my portfolio ,,,,,But is not leaving me any money, so next week GOOD BUY"
"Make you feel any better? Article on MarketWatch. ""Zoom Video stock heads for longest losing streak on record"". Not sure...Apple take second place?"
"I'll buy back in tomorrow, I should of never sold, got scared."
APPL running to $190 after earnings like morgan stanley was saying. They always predict well.
And when the price quietly drops within range Apple will remove from the exchange
"Shorting stock is a sucker bet. You pay interest, and you go against the whole market which is going up trend in the future. 2 negative edges are going against you and you will just do much worst over time."
We're well below the 50 day moving average so it should start to turn around now.....if history repeats.
I expect apple’s stock price to stay upwards of $185 by June 2021.
Apple shows price consolidation last 10 days. I expect 140s next week.
All of Monday's gain will be wiped out this week.. Back to $120..
"To be serious for minute. Hey longs and guys that claim to have been here since 1980. Ever considered some may have bought a month ago or last week at 145 or 140? You guys know it all, that?s granted. But people buy 1000 shares at 145 and a month later they?re $12,000 lighter in the pocket. Again, we?re not as smart as you. (Sarcasm) But this is suppose to be the bluest of the blue chips. You don?t really think people have a right to complain? Now you?re stuck between a rock and a hard place because the real pricks will want to say ?should?ve bought at a cheaper price?, but let?s not forget, you longs proclaim aapl stock to be God like. So according to you there is no bad but in price. So let people complain and #$%$"
"Strong earnings, great products and a huge amount of cash in the bank. But yeah Apple is dead! See you at 150!"
Weak hands sold because of the employment data not knowing that we live in the strongest economy known to men and this situation will not last forever. As I write this post our baby is crawling back to 130 USD. Apple is unstoppable. Buy and hold! See you at 150!
"Buy more now, this will end green today and we will be smiling tomorrow."
"Every Apple Store in the United States is open for the first time in nearly a year. It was 353 days ago — March 13, 2020 — that Apple closed all of its retail stores outside of Greater China.While some Apple Stores offer in-store shopping appointments and others can accept Express pickup of online orders only, all 270 US locations are now open in some capacity as of March 1, 2021. Apple Stores in Texas around Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio were the last to reopen today"
"Even AMZN with some bad news that CEO Bezos is stepping down, at first AH went Red then reversed and trading over 62. I am more than certain that AAPL is going to kept depressed until Mr. COOK utters the word ""iCar""."
you literally can't lose money with apple unless you sell the stock. I had an uncle 5 years ago flip out when it went under 100. it then went up to 500 and split. so check your apple shares in 5 years and if you lost money. you were right
10yr is down today so whats the new excuse for this being down?
"So yup it is exaggerated, the inflation rate and economy is nowhere near ready for the fed to raise the rates , the small bump in the yields is actually a sign of beginning economic recovery but we are long ways still from overheating since we are still have an actual unemployment rate of 10%."
"The analysis are wrong about apple, they bullish reports are all lies. I read them from last week and not one thing was true. The stock went the opposite way. The bearish analysis say sell this quick and buy back at 70. I think I will believe this one."
everyone is selling the work-from-home stock to buy airline stock Etc. the rotation has started. the crash then rotation will be huge. some will lose a fortune others will make a fortune. Johnson & Johnson will get its one dose vaccine approved on Friday. after that Apple will crash
Some kind of big news coming. Apple  will reward long holders
shorts starting to cover already do not sell them your shares hold and be rewarded
Car gonna be mentioned at sh meeting?
Apple is down 18% from its high
Apple shares are doing exactly what it did after the last time it split back in 2014. Back then after splitting Apple just sat there and went NOWHERE for almost a year. I practically pulled my hair out and it took great restraint on my part in not selling. I didn't sell and Apple eventually resumed its climb around 2015. History repeats itself...
Lucid apple partnership
Huge hedge fund buying in right now stop selling you can see the pattern they are picking up shares cheap cancel your sell orders
Nasdaq fair value down only 67 it is showing improvement hold on to your shares because they will start going up massively
"To every thing there is a season. Turn turn turn. BA and CAT looking good. AAPL, well...."
"You can thank me for AAPL going up. It started to climb up right after I sold my covered calls at a low premium, and for a lower-than-I-really-wanted-to strike price."
History shows stocks are the best investment. Look back last year. Live and learn.
"If you think this price is a great buy opportunity, you are wrong, you can come back in six months and buy cheaper."
MSFT was down by $10 yesterday but its fully recovered by $12 today but this stock is ????
"There is some concern that Apple's share price will climb into earnings and then pull back. In my view, the prior will not repeat in 2021 Apple's new mobile supercycle and the underlying evolution of EV and AI will hold up the share price and bring about a bigger share price for Apple than last year and another possible share split approx end of this year.The opportunity for an exceptional new high before the end of January remains very positive with only one more day to go to set another new trend for the year."
I bought Apple because I thought it was the safest! Guess not! Maybe I shoulda bought efn carnival that had no revenue
Apple  rewards long time investors. You just have to hold for awhile.
For change were green after hours. That’s a very good sign.
Can you imagine Elon Musk as a apple CEO. Stock price would be $500 by now.
If you haven't gotten in to #NOK nokia 3 am isn't too late. It's going to blow up tomorrow.

"This is my Apple diet of the day and no kidding, everyone loses weight on this diet without going hungry !I start the day off with 2 packets of Apple cinnamon oatmeal, microwaved in water 1 1/2 minutes and I add 1/2 cup frozen blueberries after oatmeal heated.Roughly 305 cal breakfast.All other meals consist of homemade soup that is restaurant good !I take a coffee cup add 1 1/2 inches of water I add a couple of shakes of steak seasoning, 4 or 5 cubes of frozen chicken breast meat ( store bought in bag) I add frozen California mix vegetables, filling up the coffee cup to about 2/3 full and then microwave 2 1/2 minutes.I then fill the coffee cup 6/8 full with chicken soup broth ( store bought in container) I heat another 40 seconds until starting to boil again and then serve.That soup is only a 50 calorie meal so even if you have that 4 or 5 times a day you aren’t getting into any real calories.I often have a single serve bag of 100 cal popcorn in the evening too.I’m easily staying under 700 calories a day and often under 600 cal a day?I’m not a Nutritionist but I don’t believe that this diet is harmful at all ?If you added another serving of blueberries in the evening that’s only 85 calories per cup.2 months on this diet and I have yet to go hungry !Enjoy !"
No Problem. This is ready to Skyrocket. March is key. My overall Basis 131.
It’s not a bad start. We’ll get to 130 this week :)
"AAPL should be up as much as the other FANG names today, if not more. Something or someone, or a conspiracy of AAPL shareholding companies, are holding it back...and I for one am tired of it"
The stock price is lower now than the after split price six months ago. I never thought I'd see that happen.
"I put a order in for 130, Just in case"
Apple doing more price consolidation before the next blast!
Like I’ve been telling you. You’ve got a problem. $123 and under $120 by Friday. There IS a problem in the market with tech.
"I bought at 136.21 healthy pullback. yep 150 level will be broken. buy buy...I like MCD, and MCD...these 3 will command the correction. EPS /revenues were huge for AAPL, and still at this price? expect a huge SHORT SQUEEZE EVENTUALLY"
Apple might see slower growth after stay at home tech boom and stim handout money printing. PE highest since 2007 iPhone 1 debut
I wouldn’t get too excited because the futures are up. This thing went down on up market days lately. It needs to get over $138 and stay over it for a week or so before major money is convinced it’s moving higher.
"Owning Apple stock over the long term is the equivalent of having a tree that grows money on it's branches in your back yard. I've held my Apple shares since 2006 and my investment of $89K have grown into almost 3/4 of a million dollars. I'll reach Apple millionaire status when Apple shares get to $200/sh, presumable by summer of 2022..."
If your smart you will gobble up the shares now before Apple makes Mr. Musk look like a little kid owning Bitcoin. Apple will come out with the I-Coin before you know it. Everybody will want to own it. Guess who Mr Cook is giving first dibs on the I-Coin ?? Shareholders....... The time is coming without a doubt. I have a feeling Apple is working on it right now...
Just bought another 20shares. Will keep on buying as much as I can.
$175 This year.
the buyers will come in at a record. no one wants to sell here as the stock will move up big time
"""Morgan Stanley hoisted its price target on the stock to 152, from 144.."""

"Not every day is a green day, wait for next week buy this week."
"In this game, giving up early is better than holding onto your losing positions."
"Yes I am upset about the 6 month performance (not long enough for some). But a silver lining. Look at a 180 day chart, bounced right off the $128.-130. support level. Let's hope this holds, held this line thru January when it dipped from $138. to $128. exact same pattern. Sadly market looks weak."
There's a reason smart money is dumping. $AAPL is no longer a growth stock and shouldn't be valued with 35 PE
People trying to time the market lose over 92 percent of the time. Long term play on Apple. Trying to time a low point is not the best idea.
All those buy the dip/drop people have been wrong since earnings. Why on earth would anyone believe a word from them today?
"Yep! Now at an 11% drop after fantastic earnings. I've said it before, fundamentals don't mean a thing anymore. The market is driven by emotion, and hedge funds."
Is this ever going to see green again ?
So if you are off the grid how do you cash in Bitcoin? If there is war who gets the money?
"Every year someone says "" Apple is done, start selling.."" and every year they're proven wrong. Just buy AAPL and hold it for years. If you bought AAPL three years ago, who've tripled your money."
"The last three earnings releases we have seen the SP increase 10 days after earnings, November we saw $10, July we saw $19 and April we saw $4. I have a feeling we will se 160-170 in 15 days."
Up $4.00 pre market....glad you sold last week?
"Apple buys SNAP, VIAC, SONO, DISCA.....then I woke up from my dream!"
I seriously hope aapl does a buy back. Too many outstanding shares.
"at least the Nasdaq composite is not down 250, like earlier in the session."
"When you go long with Apple stock, you go LONG! I've held my Apple shares since 2006 and have been through 2 stock splits with Apple. I've held Apple through thick & thin and have not sold a single share. Patience truly is a virtue!"
Apple will be from this year same as KO. Good company with dead stock. KO is trading between 40-50$ for ever. And apple will trade between 90-110 for ever from 2021.
"The nice thing about Apple is whenever it goes down, it has a 100% track record of making a new high after."
"CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 first quarter ended December 26, 2020. The Company posted all-time record revenue of $111.4 billion, up 21 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.68, up 35 percent. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue."
"Next Week $110, Keep Bag-holding this Sinking Ship !"
"Let's agree to agree today. The last four days the intra day high has been higher on an average of $2+ each day except for one day it was only higher by $1+.So. Let's agree to allow the overnight algorithim players ""wet their beak"" before the option expiration games commence.Thank you"
"Cant believe all the apple shorts on this board. Guys, look at the 5 year chart. These short term dips mean nothing."
"I purchased at 136$ , "
Once the deal is finalized and Tim makes an announcement on the partnership the stock will move to 160
Apple has been way over sold for the past two months and the way the market has been acting most smart investors want a safe haven for their money. I believe investors want a strong company with a great balance sheet that's profitable and has proven products! AAPL meets all of those plus a dividend!
"I am a New trader , bought aapl at 144. Should I sell when it’s up and get back in when it gets low? Or just hold them and buy more when it dips? Sounds like a great company to hold long term? Appreciate your guidance"
Apple flying up
Grabbed more apple this morning. God I love clearance sales!
"If she break 125$ massive sell off is coming, and stock buy back will be triggered under 120."
Just started my life long AAPL hold 24 shares at $123 goal is 76 more shares within the year
I think 130 by thursday
THE ONLY REASON WHY THE MARKET WAS UP TODAY BECAUSE THE FED START BEGUN CONTROLLING THE 10 YEAR YELD ALL DAY WAS STABLE. IF WAS NOT FOR THE FED WAS ALREADY GOING TO 1.60
Apple had a whole month of price drops for buybacks...retire those shares Luca!!
Here is a fact for AAPL INVESTORS: In a span of only one year Apple more than doubled its market cap. 1/03/20. 1.172 Trillion. 1/25/21 2.4 Trillion. Need I say more?
I just bought more. The waiting game I don't play. I knowit come next week I will regret if I don't makeit my move right now today pranto right away. So here I am ladies and gents too buyin more. Thanko you.
We need some announcement :/
"Ok, apparently the leadership in stocks are giving us a fire sale. The big picture is to buy and hold. Don’t be bully out of your shares."
Great time to by AAPL I believe! Buy great companies that are down a little bit for no real valid reason. That has made me a lot of nice gains over the years!
"Like many stocks APPL beats on all financial measures and falls the next day. Here's why: There is no such thing as free money by figuring out the stock market. The algorithms know this and the AI understands human thought and reason,,,,,,,so Amateur investors took a position in APPLE ""knowing"" they were going to beat the earnings estimates. The stock would pop and they could cash in. So........the computers simply said let's take it down, they are amateurs and will sell at a loss. That's how the game works. Not just with Apple but many other stocks."
This is not a big deal. Shake out the weak hands so the longs can buy. Wish I had more cash.
$140 plus this week
All futures are green!
Shouldn’t Kia news make apple go up today
"This does not make any sense, apple beat the revenue expectations in almost all sectors, yet the stock is falling ?"
Buffet not losing faith in Apple. Just giving it a responsible haircut.

"Short squeeze will come to AAPL. The truth will prevail. EPS/revenues are truth, and current earnings doesn't reflect the current price. AAPL should at least be 170 after hrs. But the shorties will be wiped out eventually like gamestop . Keep buying at pullbacks and accumulate. The fed has nothing to do with AAPL peformance. Customers love apple products regardless covid or not. Quarantine or not. Apple price should sustain in uptrend mode cuz APPL beat Q over Q. Fiscal year over FY..buy"
The 1-day AAPL chart right now looks like it’s giving the shorts the middle finger! DD completed. We’re going up from here!
"yo sisters and brothers, some of the shorts and day traders are now my friends and most of them are going long now. they think it is risky to short now. I sayeth I agree with them. Thanko"
"Apple is going to have a great week, hopefully makeBack most of our losses from last week. The proof is in the pudding, it’s not overvalued it’s undervalued!"
"In July of 2008 my nephew and I were helping a local troop build benches along a trail and had to haul our tools and materials in about 2 miles. We reached the site and realized we forgot the level. My nephew whipped out his iPhone 3 and saved someone running back for a level. I bought a 3s that same week. I remember my nephew joking that it also makes phone calls.That it what the next big Apple product must do. Maybe it will be an EV. But it can’t just be an EV, it will have to entertain me, it will have to look good on me, it will have to be autonomous, it will have to give me a neck massage. And then if I can say facetiously that I can also drive it, then Apple will have the next winner."
"if apple only do a reverse split of 1 to 2 , we would then have the similar amount of shares like Microsoft. Microsoft has 7.7 billion shares outstanding, apple would have 8.6 billion shares outstanding. we would be trading like a Microsoft equivalent. tim cook's mistake was a 2 for 1 split would of been perfect, over a 4 for 1 split. believe me I have tried many times to change this. tim wanted less volatility."
"This is not a stock you bet against. Apple keeps on buying back their shares to reduce their float. Buffet is not selling, I am not selling, and I recommend that you do not sell either. My return since I first start investing in this stock is almost 600%. I have held the stock since 2013."
Chairman Powell rumored to be considering retiring. After today's experience with the leftists you can see why.
It starts tomorrow 4:00 PM. AAPL closes 140+ and no looking back. Forward and on ward.
Everything going back up. Did Powell say something good?
apples raising their dividend!!!
This is Buffet's largest holding. Makes little sense to sell on the fact it got so large in his portfolio he sold and diversified a bit.
"Today's drop is part of the healthy pullback of the uptrend. Uptrend continues to 200 in Q1. Not every day is green day in stocks. It has to go gradual to be healthy, I will buy more at the opening. I feel Nasdaq100 has beat earnings by majority. I feel correction and short squeeze will come eventually to AAPL. EPS/revenues speak!!! no reason this low with solid earnings. Divergent here. Pop will come. I will accumulate every $1, in the end 150 breakout will come tomorrow or Friday at any given time. You will see"
"Eh , the P/E ratio from aapl is probably still the lowest compared to 95% of all the rest of nasdaq tech stock.So if anything aapl going to act more like a innocent bystander casualty."
"So, does it make sense to sell long term aapl take the profits then buy more shares at the bottom?"
Guys is there going to be a 2021 stock market crash?
Does anyone know why Apple would be down after good news from their earnings call this evening?...
Warren dumping more APPL today. Glad I'm invested in big oil too (XOM).
Hold the line folks. Don’t sell unless you need bail bond money right now. Don’t let shorts win
Who else here has 2000 shares or more? I bought from $107 until $129. Finally have 2319 shares. Holding for at least 5-10 years. Can’t wait for the next split. That’s why I’m not upset with price action. GO APPLE  longs
I stil fell bad for whoever who sold at 118 lol
Tim Cook: 2020 was 'Apple's top year of innovation ever'https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/19/tim-cook-2020-was-apples-top-year-of-innovation-ever
"If Apple makes a car, will it come with Windows?"
"Samsung’s phone hardware is clearly superior to that of iPhones. However, I still prefer iPhones over Android devices because I just cannot trust an OS developed by $GOOG. Long term — $AAPL stock may rise in 2021."
"APPL reiterated Outperform rating and a price target of $175 at WedbushWedbush analyst Daniel Ives notes that Apple's stock has taken a breather since its ""jaw dropping"" performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, the analyst views this as a short-term blip in the stock's upward trajectory as his Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength he is seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, Ives believes Apple will hit $3T in market cap by year-end. Importantly, with his estimation that 350M of 950M iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, the analyst thinks this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for the company. He also believes there is an upward shift of ASPs for iPhones in this cycle as the iPhone Pro continues to be the predominant model sold globally, which bodes well for top-line numbers heading into the March and June quarters. He has an Outperform rating and a price target of $175 on the shares."
Wow.A sale!Time to accumulate more shares!
another huge green day coming
"So, Apple goes down with blowout earnings across the board but Game stop rockets higher for absolutely no reason whatsoever."
"When news breaks tomorrow that I just ordered new M1 MacBook Air, this thing will fly. Have to admit, a bit surprised by the AH action but almost all my tickers are red today."
"Notice: Texas is using 23% alternative energy, wind turbines and solar. Well, wind turbines are frozen and solar is covered with ice and snow. Unreliable energy sources. I watched some guy yesterday trying to scrap of snow and ice from his solar panels up on the roof. Don’t believe the hype of alternative energy, unless you have good old naturally made fossil fuels and or nuclear."
"150 USD by next week. Great company, great dividend, great products!"
"even with record breaking earnings and EV news, it does not spike much. Why? If you were Cook and you plan a massive shares buyback, wouldn't you rather pay a lower price?"
"Can we have 150 today plz, thanks!"
In the next 4 years Apple will be in the Robo Taxi business. That alone justifies a $4T market cap.
new iPhone 13 with 1TB
How ya like them apples
APPL IS AT A DISCOUNT SUPPORT WAS AT 118
Never saw a stock go down with every record breaking up day like this one...Be prepared to lose half your money when the correction comes
we will have green pastures monday
Apple car 2023
"My God tomorrow is going to be a great day . As of now both the VIX down 6.02%, VXN down 2.62%. The Asian and European markets all up big time . Shanghai up 1.43%, Nikki up 1.91% and in Europe FTSE up 1.77% and CAC up 1.27%. WOW . A very up week for us starting tomorrow"
Trust the process and hold my people.
"Yields keeps going up non-stop, Fed has lost control and rest is all Save yourself Free Fall Mode from here."
If Apple ends positive today there is a 88.89% chance that Apple will end positively next week. Actually my predictions are it will be higher between $7-$14 next week
"“The iPhone 12 was Apple’s most successful device launch to date, and drove Apple to a record [European] share high of 30% in Q4 2020.” FYI"
Sargie warned you about the trillion share split and what to expect...Now you'll get your just dessert
"Hold strong for future performance. Once Apple successfully enter the EV car market, Tesla will eventually be like Nokia of yesterday."
"Best days for Apple are ahead. Pipeline stuffed with cutting edge technology like paradigm changing battery tech, autonomous autos, super fast chips, AR glasses and on and on. Plus they’ve got their China and India markets back in gear. Giddyup!"
A month of Apple stock on sale buybacks...must be buying back boatloads
higher than average volume selloff today.
"It happened again someone pulled the trigger in the last minutes of trading today , Apple dropped like a rock what is going on where is the faith. Had to be a big hedge fund, or someone with no direction. I am very mad, am I alone?"
So Buffett actually bought massively into Apple vis a vis Berkshire buy backs.... yeah....
CUP AND HANDLE ON AAPL. buy buy..hedgies intention detected
How much do you guys think will one apple stock be worth at the end of the year
Oh my gosh is this stock predictable in the final 10 minutes.
What did I tell you? Back to 60
Bought 500 stocks in March 2017 @ $35. Still wanna hold. I think not bad 
"Google Amazon tesla, all companies that actually create something are down. FB is down because zuckerberg suddenly realised he controls nothing, Apple and Google do. Hold on Apple will rise"
Apple lead the market down for a month now it will begin to lead it up. Bottom is in
eventually everyone won’t look to the government for help. wall street will take over and pump everything higher.
"Buffett trimmed his AAPL holding.No wonder AAPL has been below its all-time high.Try selling 10,000 shares in the market. AAPL will plunge."
"finally, this week is over..."
"If memory serves me right it was 104 at the split, 140's at its height, and is it's given back half of its post split value. Painful, but still ahead of the game."
if it finds support at 123 it's probably going higher if not.. goodnight world
Sure would be nice if Apple participated in this rally. ￼
Apple teamed up with Fiskier
"KIA and Hyundai are horrible cars, Apple will join forces with a greater company that has greater quality cars like Toyota, Nissan, Honda, etc. Even maybe with Tesla. Stock will rise tomorrow because of this news."
Apple will go up just be patient it's the best stock out there keeps going down keep on buying it
"My favorite, why not go up  $AAPL $WIMI $NIO"
Love this stock whatever I made for the last 5 months lost it in few days lol
Every quarter every analyst makes there predictions always states Apple Dosent look good. Problems with China Problems with store closings problems with anything And every quarter since 48-50 quarters Apple seems to shove itUp there Tail pipes
"Apple will be $500 in 5 years from now. The P/E is as high as it is because they are no longer viewed as just a hardware company (that's old thinking by investors that refuse to do their due diligence). If you're not buying at these discounted prices, you're going to miss out on the long term. And if you're selling with a little downturn, you just don't belong in the markets."
Apple Still Won’t Reinstate Parler In App Store
A year ago today Apple had a P/E ratio of 25. Right now it’s forward P/E is over 30. That tells you pretty much everything you need to know. The large institutional investors will decide where the bottom is. That’s all there is to it
Mark my words. This happens the week before every OPEC meeting where there is speculation of production increases! Just the strategy they use over and over.
All we can do is hold :/
Apple always gives you this buying opportunity. IMast March in the pandemic crash it went down 30%. Then a smaller correction in sept down 20-21%. Now another small correction from the 145 ath. It will probably retest 116-119 again which is where it consolidated after the split. Although it did drop to 103-106 area when it bounced in the sept correction but that would be 30% don’t see that unless the market craters 10-15%
Rumors of March 17 Apple Event
Nice finish for the day.
An up day buy and hold
I haven’t seen a GUTTING like this in Apple...ever. If it dropped it was tied to a company specific issue. This one is worrisome.
"Fun day for a buying spree!! I came back long in HOTH!! I also took new longs in $ZM!! I remember selling at big profits several months ago at $150!! Ironically I feel like the $382.22/share I just paid was smarter than the $100/share I paid for it less than 1 yr ago!! I also more than doubled up long in $VGAC!! I’m up over 100% since last March!! Planning on 25% upside for this next year! $CCL, $CNK, $AAPL, $FB, and $SDC are my other longs!!"
"I am completely out of Apple at this time and I don't like it. I did some rebalancing in Bitcoins, EV, solar but I will get back into the stock using all of my covered calls premiums I collect. I may buy some calls at first before the stock."
Breaking news: First images of the new Appl Car
New acronym alert: FAWOPM. Fumbling (sic) around with other peoples’ money. Applicable first and foremost to Cathie Wood.
"So Buffet sells 57M shares in a span of roughly $108-135 range, averaged around $120. Since 1/1/21 range is roughly $126-144. Then it comes out and the stocks falls from 134 or so to now 129. $5 per share on his remaining 887M. Doesn’t seem to be the most savvy play in my mind anyway. I was complaining about MSFT not moving for awhile I think this is entering that territory but won’t be for long. The company is too good. Once everyone tires of the bright shiny stocks jumping and diving 40-60% in a day they’ll be wishing they had this AAPL."
"I get a kick out of all the ""experts"" on this thread. Heres the real deal. 2021 Apple will end MUCH higher than it is now. I'm going golfing."
"Tim Cook became CEO of Apple on August 24th, 2011. To be fair I decided to start Tim's performance starting 1/1/12. The return for Apple during this period is 34% annually. At the 10 year mark $10,000 invested in Apple will be about $175,000-$200,000."
Apple card iphone pro max homepod mini ipad pro apple music tv+ and the future CAR LOVE ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Some vicious whipsaw action going on today, huh. Time for someanti-depressants?"
"remember apple will only go up 70 points in a condensed 4 week period. don't trade it daily. do nothing, and you will be pleasantly surprised."
Apple ramping up stock buybacks. Another low interest bond sale for 14b. Buying back and retiring 300m in shares this quarter as opposed to the 200m last quarter.
"144 by Friday, shorts will cover by then to avoid paying the dividend out of their accounts"
My dream re-entry price is approaching and I remain bullish as a long term investor in Apple.
I'm doing lots of DD tonight on the EV game. I'm a valid investor not an EV expert. I have a family member telling me to sell my Tesla shares and load up on Apple...... he works at Kia in PA..... any insight that anyone has...??
Share holder conference call starts in a few minutes. Any care to post summaries?
Haven't sold a single share and won't for at least 7 seven yrs. I will be 61years old next week and I will eventually want to retire.
"It's always ""next week"", ""next month"", ""after they report"", etc.In the mean time the stock does noting on stellar sales and future earnings.The stock is too big now to show any meaningful gains.People are not buying the narrative any longer.They want Musk, they want cash now, like Tom Vu"
Hunter Biden will be Apple's new CFO since he's a big fan of Apple laptops and his dad just made a phone threatening phone call to Tim .
"My big institutional manager told me she loves days like this, welcomes them as buying opportunities."
"If the Democrats would stop dragging the anchor on the $1,400 checks.......Apple could sell tens of millions more phones."
So happy I bought at the lows today hahaha
125 pinned right in the split price. Nothing gained in 6 months
10 year treasuries' yields about 1.4%.AAPL's dividend yield about 0.6%.Lots of money will be withdrawn from AAPL by bonds investors who had been parking their money in AAPL while real interest rates e in bonds were low.Sell.
I thinkit I will sell one of my cars and buy more of Apple shares folks. This car will bring in big dollars folks. Car collecting dust. Apple nice and clean and go up and up . thanko
I’m buying every single dip becouse 2024-2025 will be amazing year . If you don’t like go invest in Magic company’s with no products and no revenue . See you at 4 trillion apple cap
$35 is fair value
Watching this thing hug max pain like it’s Tesla....I sure am good at bringing enough action to put a stock in park nowadays.... that’s gotta be a marketable talent right?
"Apple should buy Viacom to boost Apple TV/services segment. I think Shari Redstone wants to sell, and whoever ends up with all that content could be one hell of a juggernaut.I think that’s the kind of kickstart the stock needs since the split."
On to $150 today
APPL shares were trading at $133 six months ago and now below 130. I think time to move my money somewhere else.
Short term action blows but stay long!Not a day trading stock!
"Elon Musk tweets about digecoin, bitcoins, Reddit stocks etc...he’s one of those current events need to be in the center of it all huh?...that’s why Apple will overtake his company....if you’re not laser focused with Apple right behind u then it’s game over"
The Apple car will be their downfall.
Woefully undervalued... Just had a 100 billion plus quarter... Apple is easily a 3 trillion dollar company by end of 2022
Apple had its best Q in India. Up 100% yoy. They sold 1.5m phones. It’s like 2008 in US. Once people start using it and loving it and word spreads....look out
"Look at the chart, do you see it EVER stay down for long? No. One of the best companies in the world. If you sell, you know nothing at all about investing.."
"This stock should up DOLLARS not PENNYS .... 80 cents with their earning, news and this type of market !!"

I posted a buy for fsr an hour ago because they're working with apple on the Tesla competition. Yahoo removed it. Well it went from $28 to $31 since then. What's up yahoo?
Imo Apple would be a good look for Lucid. Though it was a rumour.
Dividend next week. Of course I'm reinvesting it to get more shares. What's not to love about Apple. The longer you hold the greater your gain will be. Not even a worldwide pandemic can stop Apple. Invest and forget it. Apple long! Own it don't trade it.
pessimism will get you no where. I say by tomorrow’s closing we are 140+.
"Apple reopening stores, when they closed them the stock dropped $5. So what happens ommorrow? t"
"So let's review AAPL pricing culture applied to cars, they will high value priced. May be made in GA but FoxCom still has a Wisco commitment so EV innards made there? AAPL Scvs applied to car, goes by itself to pick up food order instead of expensive Door dash delivery? See, hypothesizing after market Friday can be fun along with a winning Superbowl bet, GO CHIEFS !!"
So much for leading the global smartphone market :/
$TSLA $WIMI $AAPL Is this good price to buy?
 Apple is king of the mountain 
Could this be the start of the correction red red everywhere on the boards
All Buffet did was keep his original shares of AAPL and cashed in his profits to reallocate and balance his portfolio. Thats just smart management. The APPL position is still his top position and if he sees it sell off more he is likely to sell something else and buy more shares of APPL at a discount. Thats what managers do!!!! If your trying to follow his trades your always a Q behind.
"If you bought in tbe low 120s like I did , all the gains are gone practically, many people are selling, Buffett reduced his position, great company bad stock now, most likely it'll be between 115 and and 120 in a few days ."
Just realized there’s a cap on how many stocks you can buy at any given point. So if 7b are going to be used on buybacks it’ll grow by $2-$3 every day for 2 weeks!
I think Hedge funds have sold AAPL short. AAPL can spike anytime to cover position. Very risky and dangerous these days to play short sale. All the numbers are obvious and leaks from the institutions not very difficult to ignite the buyers an players. There are big players behind this game. It cannot be possible without the involvement of big players
I have a strong position in apple. Getting tired of watching everyone make money while apple goes down.
"Average down, average down, average down is all I see as my next moves on this stock"
I suggest sell. Tomorrow is going down another $5 dollars. Bond yields are too high
"Biggest Bubble about to Pop, This is just getting started."
"In my opinion this sell off in FAANG and other big tech has overshoot to the downside. The 10-Yr Bond is still very low despite the fact it came up a lot % wise. It's up from 0.5, which is very very low.$AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $NFLX, $AMZN."
"On only 15 cents a day average, on 1.000 shares its 35K a year. And APPL will do much better 2021. I am long and loving it. Do the math."
A Apple holder...but Looking at the charts since Apples split 9/1/2020 Shares have only gone up $2.00
"From the buffet letter - Berkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock late in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.Our cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.Despite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding.6But that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21⁄2 years, you now indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. As these reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSF and BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well."
Boeing now GREEN!!!!!!! THEY HAVE ENGINES FALL OFF PLANES AND GO GREEN. From $89 to $218.
DREAMS COME TRUE!!! EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY AND TODAY IS MINE!!
"ALERT: AAPL WILL GO UP 6-8 AT LEAST TOMORROW, THE SLINGSHOT UP WILL BE SEVERE. TRADE ACCORDINGLY. THX"
After hours $128.00
"Speculation is that markets dropped today because many hedge funds got destroyed with unexpected losses and needed to raise cash quickly, hence selling of long positions"
when this Appl split in the summer then dropped we concluded it's bail out time. while Microsoft and others grow this aapl is dropping. good earnings and all.
To go this long without even a hint of green... either Buffett liquidating or the powers that be holding the leash on this thing with an iron grip to force the rotation meme a little longer and throttle the markets enough to get the stimulus out the door.... you decide lemmies!
"KIA is probably having an ego problem. They may have chickened out of the car deal with Apple because they didn't want to manufacture a vehicle for a different brand. They proabably want a KIA car to be synonymous with them. Well that's alright Apple has plenty of other manufacturers it can go to. I can see a similar problem occurring with Japanese manufacturers who pretty much hesitate in making big deals with American companies so we can probably count Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi out of the equation as well."
Just watch. This will be much higher tomorrow into close on Friday. They blew their numbers away on every aspect. Own it don’t trade it. This qtr validates this company will be the first 3 trillion valued co.
Apple should buy Mclaren.
I bought more !Love this Company !
Of course the retail traders are the last to know.Wait until the news breaks.Down a minimum of 10-15 bucks a share.
"So to anyone who’s sad seeing apple not perform too well everyday. Don’t worry. It’s normal. I started investing in apple since 2019 and year over year, it does do well. Better than most of my portfolio. So don’t worry. Also / look at this as a business. Somedays you’ll sell a lot of stuff and make good money; some days you won’t. But at the end of the day, what matters is how you did well year over year or month over month. Happy Friday. I’m out today."
"Last year, AAPL dipped from $82 to $51 to now at $130-Year before there was also a dip as well s the year before.It happens but in the long run it hits new highs"
"no worry, it will go back up tomorrow"
Like I said a dead cat bounce. Still wont sell thou.
"not optimistic for this week....next uptrend resist is 128, 131, we need to break them in order to see a clearer picture...."
I still see this at $150-$165 by the end of the year. Apple will be buying back billion of dollars in stock and the super cycle will continue through 2021. Remember Apple just had the most profitable quarter in US history.
"$100 should be here in a week or two, The ultimate support level to watch is $70-$80 as fair value is about $60."
"OK, back when the Gamestop debacle was in play I hypothesized the reason that AAPL dropped was due to hedge funds selling off stocks to pay off their short losses. Even after a stellar financial report that could feasibly justify a drop in price.(9%) Now weeks after the hedge fund issue AAPL is still dropping, now down (6%). I have to ask where the justification is after such a fantastic quarter, in an up market, no less."
Why AAPL share holders are so depressed?? Buy more shares at $120 and you’ll be fine.
I am not buying into the fear of an impending market crash that the press is pushing so hard for the hedge funds. The MMs are so desperate but this market can not be moved as easily as it once was. There are so many new investors entering the market each day especially since the pandemic. I see so many young people now interested in investing and starting positions. Make fun of the robinhooders all yall want but they are strength in numbers.
"What Apple really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Apple (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Apple just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Perfect time to announce a car partner
Only been doing this stock thing for 8months. Is +$7/share good for apple after holding for 5months? Im up 5.5% for apple.......seems low for a stock such as apple with the hype people say regarding the company and constant quarterly outperformances.
"Why would anyone even consider selling apple? I mean really, where do you think it will be in a month or two- or next year? There’s no safer play in the market as far as I’m concerned."
"Whats our predictions when the covid relief bill is passed with $1400 checks, $15 wage, and tax cuts?"

"AGAIN, COOK WAS HIDING. AAPL HAS BEEN DOWN 25 DAYS IN A ROW AND COOK IS GETTING MORE BONUSES. COOK IF YOU CAN NOT RALLY THE STOCK, YOU NEED TO RESIGN. THE COMPANY PERFORMANCE IS TIED UP TO STOCK PERFORMANCE."
That’s it folks . Now we rise up . Easy green tomorrow
There are some stocks that don’t do anything for awhile... look at nvidia it was a 25 dollar stock for over 6 years I believe. But the thing is Apple has been giving massive returns over the years. The only ones that are complain are the people that jumped in after the split lol
"Lol a PE ratio of 37, way too cheap for this growth stock."
Ever since last quarters blow out earnings this thing been a dog!
Seriously undervalued stock. You can buy it at any-day and will do very well in the next 5 years
"Article out that specifically mentions increasing the dividend, but then nothing else about it. I'm wasnt expecting more than a 6-8% increase. Any thoughts in light of Cook specifically mentioning it? For perspective it would take a 50% hike just to get it to a 1% yield at today's prices."
Ongoing AAPL rally justified in spectacular fashion yesterday and resumes today...
"15 minutes before the close, I sold April covered calls in QS and used to money to buy calls in $AAPL, $MSFT, $CRM, $DIS on the weekly in case we get a reversal tomorrow. Little play for fun with free cash from the covered call."
"Looks like it’s up to Facebook, Tesla and Apple to save this market."

"WellI'm kinda disappointed, i bought 10 shares at their all time high of $141 just 4 days ago, then it started going down slowly"
The sad part about Think is that he sounds like the people in Germany and the Soviet Union who ratted on their neighbors and he evidently embraces the same tactics.
"I LOVE, SO HAPPY FOR THOSE WHO SOLD THEIR SHARES AROUND 120. YOU GOT SCREWED AND YOU DESERVE IT. AAPL OPENING ALL THEIR STORES IN TIME AS THE STIMULUS CHECK GO OUT . EXPECT ALL TIME HIGHS OVER 150 AT LEAST BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS. UP 8 TOMORROW"
The ONE DAY an Apple long sees a glimmer of hope....he gets unequivocally KICKED IN THE TEETH in the final 4 minutes of the day. 6 hours and 26 minutes....all flushed in 4 minutes. Not a good sign.
"Thursday is unemployment numbers and if its a beat , market will go up. Friday is non farm payroll, if its a beat look for market t seing to upside 30-400 points, if its a miss opposite is true. Non farm payroll is the biggest market event ( comes first Friday every month). So if you think unemployment numbers and non farm payroll is will be less then predicted. Shorts ( bears) will do great, if you think its a beat then bulls and longs will do great."
"Are people taking apples new m1 chips for granted. Higher margins and more control. Creates better growth for apple services as laptops, mac mini and imac will work flawlessly with apps. Apple products will work better together than they already do."
I don't think that market can continue to rise at those levels with the reddit thing running in the background. We need a resolution on this.
"the markets will obviously start back helping the economy post covid-19 and 20, but the Dow is very high,. golden rule buy low sell high. lif you must buy something get a bargin look at gold right now."
$103 Billion earnings report expectation tomorrow  show me the green  baby!
"My realistic outlook on Apple heading into earnings week. I think it will go up, but not as high as some claim. Yes this is the first earnings report since iPhone launch, as well as the launch of the new iMacs, watches, iPads and all the accessories for those products. Now a big part of revenue that plays a factor here is the stores, which have not been open for quite some time. They’ve simply relied on their own website. Partnered companies such as bestbuy and the cellular companies. I don’t think $175-$200 per share will happen, I expect similar progress as Netflix, a 16% increase which puts at $150-ish especially when taking in these factors. $100 billion report come Wednesday is no impossible but I think it’s a overreaction. I think it will be close though!"
"Last night ( Jan 28th California time ) I was showing my wife how to trade after hours on here brokerage account. As we were placing our order i noticed a 7,736,716 share @ $137.09 and I asked myself was that a hedge fund buying or selling ? Keep in mind that was a billion dollar transaction. After seeing what Aapl price did today, I am certain it was a buy."
Petaluma CA becomes first city in America to ban new gas stations only electric allowed...and so it begins
"I’m pretty new to investing. I usually put $150 a week in. Should I buy a few shares of this, or buy something like $AAPL since their stock is pretty cheap right now + they will have some events coming up in March/June"
SEC does nothing for the individual investor. They make rules to allow big business to cheat investors. How about the same access and rules for everybody?
"A huge Dutch pension recently made big changes in its investments in publicly traded securities.PGGM of Zeist, Netherlands, initiated a position in electric-vehicle giant Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock, increased investments in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) stock, and sold more than a fifth of its position in AT&T (T) stock in the fourth quarter. The not-for-profit cooperative pension fund service disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"No, that's not what we want. Keep the dividend the same just buy something that will help with growth. Please. Come on guys why you guys so happy?"
I can hold my apple stock until the end of the world if I have to ! I just think people should take this opportunity! Before it goes away ! Buy low sell high kids ! Business 101
APPLE going GREEN today- Buy at a discount NOW.
GME is a LOT more fun today. Gee even IBM is up. What is the matter with AAPL?????
"Chase those hot stocks....you will lose long term. And in 5 years, you’ll wonder why you didn’t do the simple an obvious by buying and holding Apple."
Apple has the greatest quarter ever and stock drops 10%. They say they might make a ev car and it pops. Welcome to 2021.
SELL SELL SELL. After today it is back towards $115.
"Apple (AAPL) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The average yearly gain for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks is +24.93% per year since 1988.Says Zacks!Will have a positive effect throughout the rest of February!10, 7, 5 percent gains for the next 3 quaters!"
this is the end of apple. remember BlackBerry. Tesla will be the new leader in market cap this year.
Here we go folks hold on tight!
Very nice !
Ok not sure what some people are talking about but Apple is about to announce who they are finalizing to build the ICAR this thing can possible double pretty quick it’s been to $400 before split it can get there again easily
"Apple is in discussions with multiple suppliers of self-driving lidar car sensors, according to people familiar with the matter, a key milestone toward development of its first passenger vehicle."
Chart is very clear for tomorrow. Lower then $120.And because of friday could be big sell off.
"People....,Apple had a HUGE 14% run up to earnings....of course there is going to be some sell the news profit taking....this stock will be $185 by year end....patience"
"When Apple drops, I accumulate. It’s like picking low hanging fruits from money tree. It always taste so good when it’s ready for me to take a bite."
Never sell Apple. Buy and accumulate boys and girls.Enjoy your tendies.
Nice strong finish. Cook has got to go!!!!!
"Anybody that tells you that this stock market action is not related to an Alzheimer’s patient being president, doesn’t know what they’re talking about."
I hope the Dems can renegotiate because the Senate will never approve a wage hike as long as Moscow Mitch breathes air?Blame welfare on Republicans !
#$%$ is happening pre market people ? I?m working so have I missed some news ??
"Just to be clear, Apple stores are only open to pick up purchases only. I’m bullish $AAPL but will wait for correction to pick up more shares"
wow up .50... I bought @139.... feel like sniffing glue now.....
Yay VR!
"Tim opened this up to day trading firm, hedge funds and market manipulators with the split....and man o man are they manipulating the stock."
Apple will enjoy a delayed reaction rally. Buyers will flock back to AAPL when they realize the “meme investing strategy” isn’t working
It seems people are making more money shorting than investing in fundamentals
100 shares at 130. Not worry about it. Long term
Once market has a correction Apple will hit 100...... maybe $90 a share. Mark this post dreamers....
Told you we’d close green. The weaklings with lack of heart were flushed today. Onward and upward!
"I don't think people here appreciate enough, how advanced apple tech is vs it's competitors. Vertical integration to the max."
"Stock market so unpredictable, Apple had the best report among all the best stock and it went down, for sure it is just a temporary problem."
Turning green soon. Up big time tomorrow and the whole week. Close to 90% companies beat expectations. Economy opening up. Vaccines on target. Stimulus on its way. Businesses opening up. Hiring is and will pick up. What more do you want you negativity spreading doom and gloom people
This is the moment that is life changing. Step up to the plate now. Or watch others hit the ball.

Significant AAPL holders dumping the stock to make a quick buck off Bitcoin. Signs of a market top and impending market crash. This won't end well.
"Dear Tim,Please buy back as many shares as you can to prevent hedge funds from manipulating your stock on a daily basis and treating it as their personal piggy bank. P.S. please announce Apple Car soon. We need some momentum.Regards,Apple Long Investor"
Apple is now the Big Dog in global smartphone sales. Bigger than Samsung. Like a Steamroller.
I think AAPL buys NIO in future. If any company has a business model that would fit AAPL in the EV space it is NIO.
I bought apple on Thursday and now m worried about the market due the rebellion thinking it might crash! Should i sell all my fundamental holdings and buy back or wait to recover
"If Apple had never split its stock, shares would have been trading at $27,957.44 as of Friday's close."
Apple approaching 128 down 17 from the 145 ath or 11% and the market is not even in a correction yet. If the market really turns south Apple will drop another 10% from here and settle around 115-118 area where it built a base months ago.
"been trading for 20 years. You have to buy now. ACCUMULATION will be explosive , spring loaded against shorties . Buy with margin if you want. AAPL will break 200 in Q1. Trust in EPS/revenues from Q3, Q4"
Hedge fund has to sell apple to cover their short in GameStop and other crazy stocks. This may explain the price drop today.
Have been with Apple since 2004 Apple has success on every thing they touch this car will be unique and no company even Tesla will have the technology Apple has filedPatents on that’s why they filed You’ll be amazed what’s coming Apple stock holders have patience it always has paid off
"apple will fall more, to the 112. I am long, but I am the same guy who told you that after earnings people will sell. Reallity is that i can make money on other stocks. Not to blocked them here."
"CASE IN POINT--------->> Bloomberg: ""Apple Inc. will invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors Corp. as part of a collaboration with the South Korean carmaker on making electric vehicles, the DongA Ilbo newspaper reported, without citing anyone."""
"There is a reason Buffett doesn't own semi conductor companies such as INTC or AMD. He never liked the amount of money/capital expenditures they required to retool/build foundries. Apple now has decided to no longer outsource some of their chips and spend to build their own foundry. Additionally, they are shopping around for EV capacity. If they say they are going to build a EV plant....it is a sell."
"If the volume is falling and the price action tightening then one should conclude..?Friday volume:2/12...60 million2/05...75 million1/29...177 million1/22...113 millionLet's review AAPL for 2021. looking at 2021 open, intra YTD high and low and today.1/04...$133.571/25...$145.091/29....$130.212/12....$133.37Conclusion:open for discussion.Have a nice day....."

did you also realize today that apple's trading volume is the smallest of the year. every one knows cook is just playing with Elon musk. excellent vision and strategy by cook. they don't do acquisitions over 3 billion ever.
This is exciting!
Why the market selling off today? Media better come up with a reason quick...they missed the backroom meeting late last night...
tim cook is doing a spectacular job. he is brilliant. wait to you see what's coming. ceo of the year. obviously I won't tell you what's going on.
"Great news!!Foxconn Technology Group will develop an electric vehicle with Fisker Inc., part of the manufacturer’s efforts to boost its automotive capabilities at a time when technology companies including its main customer, Apple Inc., are looking to expand in vehicles."
Who want to make a bet that apple will drop to 125 by Friday

Can someone explain how options calls or puts expiring did this in 10 minutes and for what reason. I don’t understand options
Does anyone have the calculation what the apple share price would be today from inception if we average out all splits etc from day 1
Short the open we go to fresh lows

"apple will be at 200 this year, however the 64 point gain will be done in a 4 week time period. so don't waste your time day trading each day. just sit and relax and buy and hold only."
Apple made 600 billion in the last nine months and gave shareholders nothing
End of the year we will look back and say $144 was a good buy price and $127 was a steal!
Great news!! Apple shares surge as Wedbush sees $225 bull case ahead of FQ1
In third world Apple brand is taken as a sign of prestige. Owning Apple product means earning a prestige there. I believe this company’s R&D can revive fossils and bring those prehistoric life back on earth.

APPLE SNAPPING BACK. BUY BUY BUY PEOPLE HEADING TO 160 PLUS
my stops were taken out at 135 and 128 for a nice gain but got suckered back in for a very small position at the opening this morning. There's a definite sell trend going on and I shouldn't have ignored the market momentum. Markets recognize Biden.
My portfolio is bleeding In this Biden bear market.
Only wish I would have bought more today. Excellent quarter and couldn’t ask for better news!
Do NOT forget that Apple’s Q2 will include 3 full months of 12 Phone Sales instead of 2 months.......AND almost ALL of the Holiday Gift Cards will be redeemed and counted as Sales in Q2. Q2 will be another grand slam blowout quarter.
138 today
Will open over 140 USD tomorrow. Great company!
This is becoming Brutal! Technicals are oversold and we are still heading down? Hopefully the coming EMA will act as support ! Positivity is key people! It’s Brutal now but it will turn around ! Technicals are oversold !!!
Market is going to be UP BIG next week. Enjoy
"Look at the six month chart, Apple is due for a breakout soon"
oh my. The correction has just begun. Long way down to realistic valuation. Enjoy the ride!
"Good news after good news. From a $100B Quarter, to discussions about partnerships with various automakers. There is no reason for this stock not to be moving up, unfortunately I have to believe that the MM's are holding it back for options to expire. It's unfortunate that GME was the play that publicly displayed their power, and now we can see it happening here, as well as amongst other stocks. Either way, 50 $140 Calls for Feb 12 here and hoping for a positive week next week."
Last chance to get this discount ...don’t regret ...buy buy !!
The gravity of the M2 printing presses will destroy Apples cash hoard. Watch and learn tools buy Bitcoin it’s digital gold
Those questioning (unnecessarily) quality of Hyundai/Kia is why Apple wanted them quiet. Apple enforces highest quality control as always. Reminds me of Chevy-badged car I bought in 1985 discovered later was an Isuzu—was actually most reliable
You shorts are done
"Listen, I signed up for the risk of being thrown into the pit of fire, but I didn't think I'd actually be thrown into the pit of fire."
took profit from amc to hold long with Apple!
I told you guys.. will close green.. cup was clear! Next week big
It’s funny because the odds of apple going to $225 are almost impossible this week. If for some miraculous reason they come out and state they are partnering up with GM I wonder what would happen? Ironically enough an analyst did come out with some news hinting of the sort. I don’t have my hopes up but it would be awesome to see!
"I am buying at the open tomorrow. AAPL is so cheap vs its earnings beating Q3, Q4. correction will come. I am buying and holding"
Poor Joe shorted at 110...he’s paying your dividend and all that margin interest too...ouch
I would like to see apple trading down again. I am getting use to seeing negative days.
"I first bought Apple shares in 1990 or so... adjusted for splits, at $0.55/share.There is no sense in whining while the stock price idles."
"Intra day AAPL has had a 18% correction in a few weeks.Enough is enough!People are getting hurt,"
APPLE will turn GREEN by EOD!!!
upside potential to $235 in three weeks
"Dow is only one is doing ok, Nasdaq is still under pressure ..looks like all day pressure until close.."
Apple needs to buy Bitcoin asap before it misses the boat. Its going to 250k/coin and Apple can secure some additional earnings for next quarter by buying bitcoin.
Tired of people saying I have apple at 20 bucks for 20 years....Who you trying to make feel good?
Anyone have a price target on this before Friday 4 PM? ￼
Australia iphones sales are super high
"it's down 2% on a day people are scared 13f will show major holders sold. A bit of temporary fear, nothing a Mac Pro can't fix."
"Apple seems to be a great marketing company buying all parts from other companies, paying to use others' patents, buying patents from others, charging a premium for the assembled-by-aapl cult merchandise. Making money on apps created by others. About patents all I remember is apple's outdrawn fight over their ""patent"" on rounded corners on their phone. Being an assembly company with great marketing is making a lot of money - nothing wrong with that! Why is aapl called hightech company - wheres the beef! Just asking..."
Well the surge or drop should be starting soon. Wonder which it’ll be?
"If you don’t have a vision of future, don’t jump in. Apple will be a 10T company, that’s all what care. Buy over time and hold!"
Apple has 76 Billion of cash sitting around. They need to put at least 5% of that into Bitcoin. This would make the stock go up.
"This is exactly what those Robin hooders and whoever is complaining are talking about !!! Sell off during business hours , drive the price down and pick it back up when most of us can't !! Nice"
Don’t buy! They took your money LOL
Tim could thwart these mid-quarter manipulations by coming out with mid-quarter guidance and how successful the quarter is going
Good entry point to increase position?
Today is reversal day.
https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/11/apple-developing-new-terahertz-radiation-sensor-tech-for-non-invasive-glucose-monitoring
Even bigger drop once market opens
I paid an average of $18.37 per share for all my AAPL stock. I’m gonna continue my long term goal.
"Every one keep in mind that after hours consists of a few hundred thousands shares traded in total. Regular trading day with AAPL alone is in the tens of millions of shares. So rest assured that tomorrow AAPL will not disappoint, it will be up and continue its ascent to much higher levels in days months and years to come. Stay long and prosper. "
"The decline came despite glowing reviews for the quarter from Wall Street. Barron’s counted at least 16 analysts raising their targets for Apple’s stock price, and we may well have missed a few. The company had double-digit growth in every product category, with record revenues in every geographical market. It reported a huge rebound in sales in China, and achieved gross margins that were more than a full percentage point higher than expected. The company continues to repurchase vast amounts of shares: Facebook (ticker: FB) announced a $25 billion buyback program on Wednesday, but Apple bought back that much stock in the December quarter alone. ------- Then it must be Hedge Funds & brokers?"
Nice move up today. Board member Al Bore must have invented something even bigger than his internet.
"I'm done with this, they are clearly baiting you to buy and keep dumping as it goes lower to profit off retails. Stop Feeding Wall Street and Buffet. You are donating your lifesavings to feed the Ultra Rich as Apple sinks."

Put your money in Depends stock.JB changes his 6 times a day.
I hope all the kids loaded up today for their retirement in 50 years.
Almost positive because Bloomberg had a great article on Tim Cook and Apple. Will rocket to the sky tomorrow
"The point is we were in terrible pain last whole week and saw a glimpse of hope today. Not that we wanted to sell at 125 or so. On a day like today when NASDAQ was green and a good 8 hour of stable market, this type of last minute action requires regulators intervention. This is not fair for all of us. This big guys have been playing unfairly for years. That needs to stop. I pray and hope some positive actions in the horizon for today’s manipulation"
"On days like this, it's best to turn your screens off and not look at the price. Just remember the fundamentals of the company are exceptional and the company will be announcing new products in the coming years. With Apple, you always win long term. Even the greedy hedge fund managers and MM's can't manipulate the price if you hold long term. No super computer or other advantage they have can beat a long term holder."
No logical reason why this didn’t shoot higher off earnings. Now it has to claw back.
yep. All apple stores are open. Buy buy and hold. Short seller intention detected. They will have cover today. Big pop last Monday is the starting point
"I find it amusing to hear people asking why Apple's stock went down after announcing a terrific quarter. It's an investor's choice to pick a stock they think can make them money in as short a time as possible. It's said that Gamestock and AMC are making billionaires out of the top investors and those companies are #$%$ investments. Stock manipulation can make and break billionaires. Making money from stocks doesn't require a good company investment, sometimes it just requires good luck and maybe great risk-taking. For me, Apple is a low-risk investment that pays off year after year while Gamestock and AMC may be bankrupt companies six months from now. OK, Apple is down after a blowout quarter and that doesn't make much sense to most people in the short-term. They just see they lost some money. I just see it as a blip in a year's stock movement and how Apple is strengthening itself for the future. By any standards, Apple is making an awful lot of money and that's good for me as a shareholder. I don't have to worry about Apple going out of business soon and I'm guaranteed my dividends. As I've owned Apple since 2004, plenty of market oddities have hit Apple but Apple has always recovered. Many other stocks didn't recover. I feel certain at some point this year, the blowout quarter will boost Apple's share value when it's least expected. Patience is needed when owning Apple. It's something shareholders need to get used to instead of getting frustrated or overly concerned. Three years ago everyone was saying Apple had nothing in the pipeline but they were all wrong. Apparently, Apple can still keep secrets. Apple is busily working on projects behind the scenes and the may be game-changers for all we know.Anyway, put the holiday quarter behind and move forward. Apple is still the market cap leader by a good amount with plenty of cash to work with. Don't be too disappointed in Apple because investors didn't respond to Apple's earnings report. That's their loss because they're busy trying to fulfill their greedy nature with get-rich-quick stocks. It's nothing I want to be involved in. I prefer to own companies that have solid fundamentals and pay dividends over the long-term and that's definitely Apple.????"
You just witnessed how the cards are completely stacked against the small investor and day traders. Incredible manipulation by funds end of month options expiration on all nasdq stocks rendering all calls worthless.
Revenues basically flat over past 3-4 years. Don’t understand how it could stack up with such valuation. Buffett is right to switch back to old economy stocks. I-car is a big unknown by 2025. By then Apple might become an orange?!
Hard to believe we are down ore in AH after the beating we have seen since earnings.
"Remote guidance with mobile terminal AR has been applied in various B-terminal scenarios such as factory overhaul and maintenance, and Apple first publicly used AR to guide product design remotely.Using the LiDAR camera module of the new iPad Pro 2020, mobile AR is more stable and accurate than ever before, and the effect of marking with AR has obvious advantages over normal video calls."
Does anyone know why the market dropped soSuddenly late this morning? I didn’t really hear anything on the news
Apple is dead for the next year. Folks are going where the action is and that's what I am going to do. Selling the last 1000 shares of my Apple and putting it all in CLSK. Good luck to all who stay with stale Timmy and his lack of new products.
THE FED TRY TO SUPPRES THE 10 YEAR YELD THE CORRECTION IS ALREADY OVER . THE MARKET IS ALREADY RALLY AGAIN
"It is early, more than 5 hours to market opening bell, there was in past trading days nice turn around to the upside so early trading will indicate direction of Apple today. Hope is eternal."
Looks like it will take a crack at $130 tomorrow.
If this is down when the market is green what'll happen if the market is red?
Would you recommend buying now? I was considering waiting for a pullback/correction but also feel like this is going to jump after earnings. Any thoughts?
You know there is a problem when 600 point jumps are the only thing to get this higher and every other Dow day means red Apple.
wow NASDAQ - 210 I told you apple  was going to lose all the gains of yesterday
WE THANK EACH OF YOU PANIC SELLERS THREE PAST WEEKS.
Where is the 5G supercycle? hahaha
I have my share since 2009 bought it 108$ before 7 and 4 splitsDont sell keep it long
Apple reopening stores starting Monday 2/8
Approaching a solid support around 126. Most probably will bounce back to 130s from there
No buying. Across the board. Very disconcerting when the after hours yesterday saw strong buying. Not a good sign.
MOON BABY LETS GOO $AMC HOLDING HARD BABY $CTRM $TSLA $AAPL
How many people out there have apple as more than 25% of total holdings?
Let’s say apple knocks it out of the park on earnings. How much is already baked into the price?
The funny thing is people on here that say they are bearish on Apple and root for it to go lower 100% have no options shorting it. So then I ask why? Do you want to see the whole market go down?
News is out that Apple is developing a VR+AR headset to be sold next year. Read the description on Bezinga website (yahoo doesn’t let me post the link here). The product features and capabilities sound very exciting.
Report also says Apple has moved on to discussions with 6 Japanese automakers.....much better
Just bought more AAPL to double my position. I averaged down from my initial buy in at just under $142.
"The real potential of iRobot is in the long term, not in the ER.but I would be happy to see the nice results.not selling before Terra is out and running for 10 years at least...IRBT is the $AAPL in the Robot industry."
Stimulus is on it’s way by the 1st week of March 2021 and the market will rocket  to the sky
A sell the rips market. Keep a close eye on the exit door if you risk holding. A very dangerous market is here.
Whoever is selling Apple shares right now are most likely hedge funds liquidating shares to pay for AMC and GME.
The weak hands sold cheap Thursday & Friday and now it’s headed higher.
$110 next week.
"Wow, a huge beat! $1.68 EPS, revenue of $111 billion, and net income of $28.7 billion. DURING A PANDEMIC, ladies and gentlemen! Every single reportable segment/ region was up with the Americas being the biggest as well as every single sales category with iPhone taking the lead. This should put an end to criticism that the company is not a growth play. Growth was everywhere compared to prior year's quarter (when there was not a pandemic yet). They also paid $30.5 billion in buybacks and dividends. I don't care that it's down after hours all I know is that Apple is a behemoth and that the future will be brighter than ever. I have even more reason to buy more shares now. This isn't a stock you trade. This is a stock you invest in and accumulate. Own it don't trade it."
"big bounce after hours yesterday, lets see whats in store for us today!"
"No so called expert can predict the market on a daily basis, but the great top corporations are an open book as to information needed to make a wise educated investment on a long term basis. There is no question that AAPL is one of these companies. Bottom line invest in Apple long term and you will be a winner. In AAPL case history does repeat. AAPL is without a doubt a long term winner."
just bought 500 more
Google pay adds a crypto tab.Looks like Google will be the first company to add the crypto exchange. To the victory goes the spoils.
you don't know investing if you're selling APPL after that earning report...and 5G is still an infant...
JoJo asked Dr.Jill for a stingray bike so he can go find Cornpop again.
I guess it could have been worse
Never ever sell Apple when the market panics. They want your cheap shares. It happens every year or so. Just hold it and buy the dips like this. Listen to the folks on this board that have heldThis for years. Don’t listen to the shorts and bears
If a stock you own goes down and you laugh  then you’ve done your proper research.
Never seen that happen with a FAANG stock. Happy I did not buy today.
"APPL flying high again, not only the Apple products doing well but think about Apple car and how well that will be welcomed"
"We have not broken $140 since the end of January. Come on AAPL, time for a good break out."
"My prediction is AAPL going to make a car with Toyota and take over the world. Toyota already has some AAPL features in their latest vehicles and the CEO of Toyota admittedly said their EV program was slow even though they were the first to launch, but failed measurably because TSLA ate their lunch, so now is their chance and get AAPL to take back the market share. This partnership would benefit both companies greatly and people will love it due to the reliable sticky brands involved."
"seein comments 'waste company' ,'awful company' etc. while they are following their stocks with their apple brand tablet laptop computer smart phone looool you guys are taking big L."
Apple now on a tear. We shook out the weak hands and this family jewel is ready to shine. Like a lovely shiny green Emerald. The most precious of the precious stones. This train has left the station . 
"Looks like bottom was reached today, time to buy!"
"Learn from me young Robinhooders. I bought AAPL a few years back when it split. Was eager to get in at $98 but couldn’t due to banking restrictions. Was finally able to at $131. Held it for a year and got impatient and dumped it. Then it ran up as you know and split this last time. I lost out. Bought it again this time for my kids with a long hold time horizon .... like 5-10 years. I won’t miss the boat on this again. Be patient. With a car on the horizon, this could run up significantly and split again. Remember though after this next split the float will be enormous. Big floats (ie PFE) are very very hard to move. I think you’ll see this happen to AAPL and without a dividend, it makes it impossible to own for income and hope for massive growth cycles continually. I say one more bull run is left in this stock. A good 5 year run then after that, I’d look to other tech stocks for strong returns."
dont worry big movement toward 150 then 180 will come soon once everyone loaded enough! such a phenomenal company!
I only come around when it's time 2 short & that being said $aapl $115
Fox News says apple has a new target price I think they said 171
I do not understand how Apple had the best quarter ￼￼ever had over $1 billion￼ and still going down
"I've bought and sold Apple over the years. After the 7 for 1 split, I bought to hold longterm and have added 20-50 shares every time I sold another stock. I'm still holding and adding, and now have over 2,000 shares. There are 29 stocks in our portfolio and Apple is one of 3 that is absolutely not for sale. The other 2 are Microsoft and Target."
Mark Cuban is pretty much saying that the stock market is a Casino and valuation doesn't matter... I so don't agree
Any update from shareholders meeting?
Nasdaq sees Green soon. Buy..buy..
Apple is just like the old trains. takes too much time to start rolling but it is for very long distances
Dividends are right around the corner if I am not mistaken
Buffet sold some not all. Not a concern.. I do think the stock has been a dud for a while now. The day I sell the stock will move up 5 pts. Still holding .
yo ladies and gentlemen I do not understand the logic of them shorts and day traders. If yo have say $1 to $2 millions say $1.5 million why not invest long term and get yearly benefit from it rather than taketh so much risk and also lose them dough. Buyeth mutual funds or ETF and they give yo great returns often and mostly over 20% year in year out. Mr. Warren giveth to yo 23.3% yearly since 1959 . Spend those returns on running yo house rather day trading and shorting and getting high tension and what not? Yes! No! May be! Thanko
Hold that green baby
I am out. All in cash. Will buy back when these change for nasdaq

APPL should acquire Nokia to help American national security. Nokia Mkt cap is only $22B. It’s only 1% of APPL Mkt cap. It also helps other countries’ national security from China. Is it possible for APPL to do so?
Price target adjusted to $160 from $140 by Deutsche Bank
"Been investing for over 20 years. Been on these boards daily for probably about 5. One thing is for certain - never have I seen such strong “in the moment” sentiment as I see now. Everyone assumes that what they are seeing or feeling now will last in perpetuity. That’s patently FALSE. Want proof, just go back and review what your life and society were like 5, 10, or 20 years ago.Don’t know about you all, but just because the VCR is eating up my tape today doesn’t mean I won’t be easy streaming in 8k in due time."
We need a week of 3000-5000 point down days.All the new covid $$$ players will go back to their basements.
Thanks to Powell's speech it is going to be an up day
Why would anyone sell Apple after hours when it’s going to $130 plus within 48 hours cancel your sell orders!
"I'm telling you guys, next Sunday, we'll hear there's an online Apple event the following Sunday."
Warren Buffet could have sold Apple for billions of reason but non of those reasons are based on Apples fundamentals. So man up and hold folks! You don't have billions worth Apple in your portfolio you need a few years to get there!ATH in two weeks!
"I’m very curious as to how Aapl will perform Monday after that mighty dump, late Friday ?"
"AAPL’s one year chart is no worse than the two “meme” stocks of years past—AMZN and NFLX—in fact identical. But among those 3, AAPL is the best investment, with promising new technology in both short & long term, and a PE less than half the around 80 they enjoy"
The investment in the Kia plant is a major redesign based on Apple specs. Apple is now a player in the monster EV marketplace.
Placed an order for more shares today
"sooner or later it will recover with better gains, nothing to worty about on a company with that strong fundamentals"
Collab between fisker and apple? $FSR $AAPL
You have to ask yourselves where is the stock going to be in three weeks to 3 months?￼ I think in one month the stock is over 135. What are your thoughts?￼
I don't have much but just $110K in the apple with $110 average. I am 30 years old now. Can anyone tell me how much it will be if I don't sell a single share till I am 60?
"Here we go, GL!"
Apple is the only stock that did not recover today. It's still getting hammered. Wall Street really fixed us good.
"Strong Sell, The last to sell will be 2008 Victim, Bear Market Cofirmed."
Beautiful. Will be a green day tomorrow
Thank You board for okaying dividend raise.
Apple stock reacts like Pfizer. Too many shares.
"The problem with this drop is that it’s unknown what is causing it. Previous battery issues, production issues, sales issues have hurt the stock. This drop is tied to nothing....which is actually more worrisome. I’d rather identify why rather than some underlying issue."
I have closed my positions.
yo ladies and gentlemen market closed tomorrow but cometh Tuesday we will rise sharply. Thanko
Consolidation period is officially over. Time for lift off.
"I wish Apple would make a play at Viacom/CBS. They could show the premiere's of the new Top Gun and Mission Impossible. Throw in Showtime, CBS Sports etc..and they could blow up AppleTv+."
"buy this dip in KHC, 5 percent div, look at the chart."
Perhaps the investors that believe the market is open tomorrow should eventually consider moving their investment money into a managed target fund. Looking forward to Apple’s conference call on the 27th. The AirTags sound interesting; hope we get some info during the March event. Good luck & great investing!
Longs don’t try and figure it out! Just hold long it will rebound on news and or announcement
Apple’s “1984” Super Bowl commercial for the Macintosh 128K will be surpassed by the “2021” commercial for the iCar.
"AAPL to use Kia to make its cars like they use Foxconn to make their I phones, the cars will be all AAPLdesign and engineering."
This will continue until AAPL is allowed to buyback after the SEC blackout due to earnings
"Apple recruiting for 6G?? Interesting move! Apple trying to catch up again. And why are they advertising in San Diego? Because Qualcomm has been working on 6G for years and Apple is trying to pirate other peoples original ideas. Same old Apple. It's OK for Apple to make mega bucks, but when a competitor makes a buck, Apple is being taken advantage of. Biggest leaches on planet earth."
"Up next week, mark my words...."
"Apple deserves a max multiple of 20, given it's estimated growth rate. Max intrinsic value = 4.68 * 20 = $94. Buffett says don't buy till it drops to 80% of intrinsic value. .8 * 94 = $75"
Reminds me of the XOM bashing all last year. But in the case of apple I don't think it'll be sustained all that long. Trying to slow the inflows into this thing is like trying to stop Niagra with your hands.
"I had an issue with airpod pro yesterday, called in for a support they shipped the replacement on the same date. Today, I received my replacement airpod and listening music. I bought more shares today."
"Do not sale hang in there. Yes there are some problems with the developers over the charges for Apple store...they filed law suits last year but because of the COVED and the elections it pops up now. I am not worry I trust Apple they know what they doing. Apple plans to release two new MacBook Pro models equipped with an HDMI port and SD card reader in the second half of 2021, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who outlined his expectations in a research note obtained by MacRumors. The return of an SD card reader was first reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman last month."
Hopefully AAPL will bottom around $131 and move higher or consolidate. That's the bottom of the trench!
From monday we start again to count red days.
"Long holder since 2008 & I’ve seen this activity many times. Just hold. Apple is solid & always comes back, higher"
Where are the fan-boys who said last night we are going to $150 today?
"Rain or shine, buy or don't sell AAPL.Don't listen to the shills who pretend to be retirees who became millionaires by buying and holding AAPL shares. They're not real investors."
"I need help from the gods above... I made a big mistake, and the life insurance is the only thing I can offer my family. I'm preying for help... God , be there in the morning for me, I know I made a mistake... Please help me with this"
AAPL has peaked. Downtrend has started. Questions are: how long will it last and how low will it go?
Why.?... why?... I can’t find any single reason that Apple goes down today. I’m sticking to that.
CNBC did a good job talking up possible Appl-Hyundai joint venture!More good news.
"My core holding are Apple, SNAP, and VIAC among others. My newest stocks are Draft Kings and Palantir for the future. I try and invest in stocks that will be #1 dominate player in their sector. Bottomline, this strategy has made me a lot of money. The key is to buy and hold and never buy at 52 week highs."
maybe amzn and alphabet earnings will give aapl the freen light for the 150 sp... next hours will be interesting
No way. Apple will lead us out of this correction just like it lead us into it for a month. Next stop back to the ath 145 area
"LIKE YESTERDAY, LAST 40 MINUTES, AAPL WILL START RESUMING UPTREND AND CLOSES POSITIVE"
"It's amazing how these other companies without making any money or little money are at all time highs, while Apple, Amazon are struggling to go up, gut feeling says this is going to change soon!"
Will close green today! Ignore the noise! See you at 150 USD!
"Earnings Whispers says, ""Apple (AAPL) reported 1st Quarter December 2020 earnings of $1.68 per share on revenue of $111.4 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.41 per share on revenue of $102.6 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.52 per share. Revenue grew 21.4% on a year-over-year basis."" SO WHY SELL??????????????????????????????????"
"Media: ""Warren Buffet sells large stake in $APPL.""Media also forget to mention he still retains 50% of his investments in Apple, smh."
To everyone asking how this could go down after great earnings. That's not entirely true. Apple went up big time in the week heading into earnings. The institutions new apple would have a blowout quarter and they bought big time heading into earnings. That's how it always happens. If everyone started buying once the earnings were out and there was confirmation then investing and trading would be a joke...and easy. Simple as that. Stocks go up into earnings when the outcome is still unclear and the risk/reward is much higher.
"Once again, other FANG stocks achieving ATHs on 100k’s of volume, while AAPL stuck rangebound on 17M volume...sound suspicious??"
Are the fences coming down anytime soon around Fort Nancy in Washington D.C. Is she still scared?
If this anomaly does not reverse by mid day tomorrow than some group is manipulating this stock. With the out of this world earnings there is no reason for this retreat. It just doesn’t make sense.
"Finally a green Apple. Held off selling yesterday, February was brutal but hopefully March will make amends. I believe the worst is over and the months ahead will benefit holding long. (I hope). Good luck to all."
"With surgical precision, Wall St will pin this right at 129.90"
"12 to 18 months from now, $125 is gonna look awful cheap. Panic if you want. I’m not"
My portfolio is already overweight on apple but I will definitely add on if the down trends continue.
I am sure tomorrow the market will go down like last week was up 450 points then next day down 550
"Tomorrow is a make or break day. If AAPL is up tomorrow I will hold , if down by 3PM I sell. Still ahead and will take profits."
Powell did his job well. going back up
Futures pulling out of a dive! Could be opening better than expected
Numbers do not lie!Look at where AAPL was this time every year then in Dec of that year
Would not be surprised to see 125 today based on call/put ratio!
Apple has not grown the top line in any meaningful way in the last 3 years. This is not a growth story.
"Apparently, big guys have been reducing the size of their AAPL holdings, like Buffett. As recently as a few months ago, AAPL was about 1/100 th of Nasdaq 100. The ratio is about 1/104th now."
Even if no one buys AAPL stock the company buys plenty of it back periodically.
I really think Apple is going to transition into the health sector. Apple watches are the first step. Next is a database for medical professionals. Going to the doctors check up? Doctor can scan your Apple Watch and plug it into the database and boom! Incredibly accurate medical diagnosis leading to improved morality rates and longer healthier lives.
"The resistance at $138 will soon be broken. Apple hasn’t really had any definitive price action above this high for 6 months but when it does move beyond it, it will be vicious."
"Apple is simply the Nike of the tech world (that’s a compliment). There are always new upstarts, but all the cool kids know and will pay for the top brand. Simple as that.Back in the mid 90’s I kept hearing Nike was peaking....yeah, that’s what they say about Apple now. Look where Nike is 25 years later."
"Science says that I now have almost no chance of getting Covid and almost no chance of transmitting Covid. So why do I need to wear a mask anywhere? Very soon, 85% of the population will be like me. Time to re-evaluate the entire mask thing."
Volume has been huge. This translates into consolidation.AAPL hit an intra day year high at $145.01 then dropped 10% to $130.21 this past week.A 10% dip is not uncommon for AAPL after a run to a new high.
FSR is only worth 4 billion and has stylish concepts going into production.. AAPL will likely buy them.
Street is thinking that Apple profits topped out in the last qtr.Still my PT is $150 by 4/15.
You just can’t trust premarket.
"no one expected a $8 billion beat in revenue, it should be green shortly"
Hope Timmy is up and running. Hope he is haveit breakfast and is gearing up for a great and positive day for beloved Apple. Timmy makeit a statement Timmy. Thanko
Let’s hope that the hedge funds that sold Apple this month buy it back tomorrow since it’s month end for trading. Some rebalancing back into tech may happen and help out the stock price
"These losses are not going to get better. Apple is the only stock that got devastated by Wall Street. All the others are rebounding nicely. Apple end is near. It was good for many years but now that SPLIT ruined it severely to a point it CAN'T recover. Too many shares out there with ZERO ""0"" DEMAND. Shame there."
"Never seen AAPL stuck in a rut like this, even w/stellar earnings, since 2nd Obama admin...like we’ve gone back in time"
"Just curious, did we elect a president or a king. 43 executive orders in a week and a half and who’s writing these orders certainly no him. Sounds like a dictatorship to me."
Knew Apple will pop right back above $135+ tomorrow. Time to load up and get on the train to $150+ in a month is today.
THE FED BUY EVERY SINGLE STOCK PRINTING AND KEEPING THE RATES 0 FOREVER
Now what!! LOL!!!
"Crash , Boom, Bam! The hole in the Titanic is getting bigger! If it does not hold the $119 level then see you back at $109! Apple will never beat the 2020 second half numbers in 2021! No more colors or sizes and 5 g is joke! Cook needs to Retire! Who is You successor Mr Vanity?"
Fisker that there is 3rd partner ... and that partner is NOT a contract partner...Note...NOT a contract partner. read between the lines....I suspect $AAPL or $FB or $MSFT or $GOOG
"Notice how these seemingly random flash crashes never happen just before or during earnings? Especially wouldn’t jibe with AAPL’s blowout ER...awfully suspicious, like these are pre-scheduled cycles"
"Clearly Beginning of a Bear Market, the big boys always win as they are first to run and sell high to you, the last to get out is always retail Bag-holders."
"pretty sure retailers will squeeze out AAPL institutions above 150 in pre market. Watch...Solid EPS/revenues command ...buy after hours, I bought mine at 136.76"
"Holder Shares Date Reported % Out ValueVanguard Group, Inc.

I still have my shares, and haven't lost nothing."
The sellers who sold in the last 3 minutes on Friday will pay a much higher price to get back in on Monday. March 1 starts the climb up.
AAPL will be green today. Selloff here is way over done for the earnings they produce.
longest market rally ever is done
$FSR + Foxconn + $AAPL = Winners 
"stocks open higher, except apple. Sigh"
It’s funny I see institutions buying  the last time I saw this was back in November and then this shot up!
Apple never said they were in talks with anyone! Tim Cook hasn’t said anything.
"This is one of the best firms on earth....their performance history is a solid proof...whenever it breaks 130, I start to add more position"
weak hands will never be rewarded
AAPL is an excellent investment but Hunter dad’s economy willsink it with the rest of the economy Free cash for everyone!
"I watch 25 stocks, and this is the first time that every single one of them is deep red."
so because they are going into EV this gets another 20% upside I assume.. just wondering seems like the norm
GO APPLE ! Probably close green
"Looking at the 50, 110 and 200 Day Moving Averages, no wonder AAPL is ""treading water"" like it always has for years after a new move into a new option strike price level.Look at the volume it has fallen off a cliff."
Almost cant remember the good old days when Apple was green for 2 consecutive days.
"Hmmm saw Cathie Woods sold AAPL, anyone know how many shares ? Thanks"
"Open today around $138, drift to $137, close $139. Friday will be $141."
"Something very wrong with AAPL, Buffet is dumping, So are the big boys one by one. This is end of Apple's run like GE back in 2008 when it was still world's biggest company."
"When a great stock went down, you need to ask yourself what has changed overnight or in recent month. For AAPL, Apple released the most advanced ARM-based M1 and this big change will lay the solid foundation for the next decade, tech people are thrilled about it. The only change was Warren Buffett took his profit from Apple and invest in other buiness that all investors are doing all the time. Long term investors can see the future where the shortsighted day traders who want to make money quick are blind to see it. And as always, moronic short term traders will lose more than they can make."
Watch for the big jump before close
Showing relative strength today even though we are down. Probably because we have sold off enough in the last couple of weeks
$122 is the 200 day moving average. That’s where this is headed before it climbs again. Cheerleading isn’t gonna change anything
Careful for the market makers and banks going into the close those of you buying this dip...
The shareholder now has the brutal burden of absorbing the backlash to their Orwellian app store edicts. If it wasn't broke . . .
yeeeeeeeehaaaa! it’s about time. Hopefully the turnaround is from now on! now raise the dividends!￼￼￼
Owning Apple is like getting waterborded for 8 Hrs every trading day.
who here bought an apple product this year? i know alot of people who bought tons of apple products including friends and family. i know apples earnings wont disappoint
"As I see it, there were only 2 major sales in the last 2 days. 10 million and 5 million shares sold in two tranches. Who is selling?"
$8 BILLION revenue beat! Simply amazing. Hold your shares until you are retired. Ignore the ups and downs. What a juggernaut
"Wow, the drop only moved us back to Jan 6th 2021 price level. I'm looking for 120 before buy any shares with the change in outlook in inflation!"
"Apple Eclipses Samsung as Top Smartphone VendorThe introduction of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 12 family helped the smartphone giant overtake Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. as the top smartphone vendor in the holiday quarter, according to Gartner, marking Apple's first time holding down the top position in four years."
"You can say that the elections wasn't stolen....but, the market doesn't lie."
New AAPL multi billion market coming with AAPL Wallet getting into crypto exchange business.
Those who sold last week need to get back in immediately
Mr B. No buyback??? No car?No acquisition or hints?That's it he left us to dry...
Your not going to make a fast buck trading Apple. This is for long term holders that are patient.
Within 12-18 months Apple will have a 3 trillion dollar market cap. It’s inevitable. That puts the share price around $180. That would mean some serious cash for Jim Younger
GUYS I SOLD AAPL. I GUESS THIS RELEASES THE ANCHOR EFFECT AND WILL GO UP NOW.
How long will the fed pump money money into the market through open purchases. It will have to increase interest rates soon otherwise Powell credibility will be lost.
"AAPL is leading Nasdaq 100 lower.The ration, Nasdaq 100 / AAPL has been getting larger. (The larger this ration, the weaker AAPL is to Nasdaq 100.)A few days ago, it was about 104.Right now, it's about 106.A couple of month ago, it was 100!"
"Meanwhile, back in the Oval Office. The finishing touches are completed, and the new basement decor perfectly simulates Joe’s home in Delaware. Complete with overstuffed chair, mini refrigerator and a black and white Smart TV, the kind with channel changer attached to the front. He’s kept completely informed. Why today, he’s going to look in to that Texas thing."
"2trillion market cap, very difficult to double that with cheap phones becoming more popular"
"apple is the name of innovation, and people asking for a piece of their balance sheet through a special dividend unknowingly are wishing it would fail. Apples place in this world has been set as numero uno, and if they do not invest heavily into the next tech, which includes e.v (and they will knock them out of the park), they would lose their spot. stop begging for a quick div and hold for excellence"
"Down -12.3% , good thing it wasn't bad earnings."
these are bargain prices its gonna run to $150 when shorts start to cover
Sure I can buy the dip but I would much rather be selling the peak ?Lol
"KIA is back on — confirmed! Last denial was simply their dose of humble Apple pie. AAPL rallies to 140 tomorrow (bye, bye shorts...see you in Attica)"
How low will this go? Any chart experts here?
I suspect this might automatically get removed but thought this was interesting animated pie graph about buffets portfolio .https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lozpsj/oc_warren_buffetts_stock_portfolio_at_berkshire/
Better start covering now shorties.
How could AAPL fall so far after the best earnings of any company EVER!!!!!
Kids ignore speculation AAPL is a gold mine
"Nasdaq rally starts today, buy technology."
Pure manipulation last 10 min of Fri session as usual
Look back at my comments I predicted Apple 110b revenue. And someone commented that t is too high a prediction.. look what now?
Months of gains wiped out in 48 hours. Typical.
Too much to ask that a lowly company like AAPL go up 2 days in a row.
Come on Apple back to $125. Margin calls due
"As the ""Board Historian"" allow me to discuss what has happened in the past.Except for the release of iPHONE 6, AAPL eventually pulls back each fiscal year. THis year also may be the exception.Whenever everyone is playing weekly calls for explosive rally the BIG BOYS postpone that rally until the following week. Therefore, a smart move would be to sell 50% of your positions that are probably up 200=% to date at the gap up in the am.A conservative play for whomever bought at $126,you can sell a Jan 22 $145 call for $21 tax deferred cash per share in your pockets tomorrow.. This gives you 30% return on AAPL for 2021 but you must give AAPL away at $145 + $21 = $166.It was posted ""Investors have the filed until AFTER EARNINGS. . It has had a 15% run."
$145+ this week.
"Apple and Tesla, The Biggest Bubble of all among mega cap, Don't chase Bubble for it will bursts into ashes along with your $$."
i think big tech gonna sell off tomorrow again
AAPL Performance snapshots:Last 6 months: $ 95.00 to $137.09 (44.3 %)Last 3 months: $111.00 to $137.09 (23.5 %)Last 1 month: $135.98 to $137.09 (0.82 %)Last 5 days: $137.14 to $137.09 (-0.04%)Last 1 day: $139.52 to $137.09 (-1.74 %)Reasonable earnings during previous pandemic impacted quarters.Blowout performance this quarter…. AAPL deserves better !!
"Notice.The highest volume was on 1/22 when AAPL dipped to $130.21 10% from 1/25 intra year high of $145.09.Experienced investors knew AAPL traded in mini ""v's"" and often pulled back 10% over the years.They waited and were rewarded.The ""algorithim players"" hit a home run then as well.That was yesterday. today is today."
"AS MORE FACTS COME IN, AAPL WILL START JUMPING TO 160. BUY HERE BIG TIME. THX"
APPL should be too smart to get into low margin car making business when the field is so crowed with excess capacity in the world as far as the eye can see. EVs won't gain popular support unless mandated or unless 5 minute charging is possible. Even then EV manufacturing will be limited by key resources. AAPL think of a better idea in a market less crowded and with higher margins.
Is the jump today on all apple stores opening? or something else?
"Apple to partner with Lucent, Washington Mutual, and Enron next week,"

Goodluck tmrw
Back up the truck and load up the shares. Apple is happy to buy back their own shares. A year from now prices will be higher. Shareholder since 2011. Trust the process. Apple is printing money every seconds .
alert: let's start the big buying here plus the buybacks
Tim Cook said that they have plans to increase the Dividend
"The volume of retail trade can’t set AAPL price accurately, because it’s overpowered by wash trading of manipulators making weekly option premium income. Once wash trading no longer cost effective for this purpose, AAPL will trend higher"
"Be patient with apple, they will come through. Had great earnings report, went down for no reason."
"Apple highest PE since 2007 debut of iPhone 1. Highest price to free cash flow, highest price to sales, highest price to book. Apple was pumped due to zero rate mania."
Apple: The Master of head fakes!
A lot of impatient & whiny people in this forum.. it’s Apple for god sakes HOLD & RELAX
46 is losing stamina and the market isn't happy with his America last policies.
"People are disliking my post !!! ------------------ TRUTH is TRUTHI am a wellwisher of apple !!! Investing in apple since 2016.But the reality is reality - This stock was 137 in September and now in the range of 135, it hasn't moved and that's the truthDisliking my post will not increase the stock price.There should be something fishy on this or it requires something different effort !!When the market is up - apple is red when market red- apple is obviously red-- I know apple has a 75% gain last year - But it has declined for 6 months and we should accept the truth. Not having any positive effect on the share price even after having 110 billion revenue is something fishy again.I am hoping till Monday, Tuesday of next week if it's gonna take any better direction - otherwise, I think there are a lot of opportunities out there to grow your money."

"AAPL will go up to $126 on Monday March 1, 2021"
"That movement at the end was not 'manipulation' (your code word for whatever you don't understand in the markets), it was overwhelming sell demand. Just look at the volume, that wasn't an artificial depression of the price. There was a LOT of Apple stock getting sold at the end of the day."
Get Ready for AAPL $50-$60 when everything is said and done.

Apple has dad a 10 percent correction. Time to move up.
"Traders said that while today’s ugly session could be the start of an orderly pullback, we could be in for some surprising moves due to the nature of the selloff. As one trader explained, ""Hedge funds were reportedly forced to sell to raise capital amid the historic short-squeeze on Wall Street, but while today’s selloff was scary, these liquidations often end with spectacular rallies like in the wake of the ‘volatility apocalypse’ exactly three years ago.”"
"Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia."

Lots of comments about why this stock doesn’t just keep skyrocketing...we’ll look at the chart around the time of the split...it took off...trading at all time high PE valuations and has the highest valuation on the street. Patience is key with Apple. Company is firing on all cylinders right now.
"Being the ""Board Historian"" all I can say is this has happened before where AAPL treads water for a month or 6 weeks at a new strike level price..You saw what happen when the stock price was ""muscled"" to $144...it dipped 10%.I think the next earnings report may be the catalyst to run it to a new high.There is such as much money to be made in a tight range as in a wild gyrating one."
apple needs to seriously buy a hollywood studio and start pumping content into TV+. i wouldn’t worry about an AR headset right now for $3000. if they started making shows and movies and putting it out every week. they could take over netflix.
I will buy 2 new Apple Cars. One I will keep new in the box to resell on E-Bay in 10 years.
This is a great buying opportunity!
I’ll have 1500 shares after the dividend later this week. I will hold them another 4 years at least.
Apple and Tesla should just partner up on cars and satellite internet service. Both would go to 10 trillion market cap.
Apple will eventually have their own Banks and Cars for purchase. They more cash than any other company publicly traded. I think it’s still the perfect investment for the next 20 years. Ps support @118 were good
Is this a good place to enter AAPL? It has broke below the 50 SMA. Never have owned it. Why is it selling off when other tech stocks and market in general is near its high. Are we about to see a big correction? Any thoughts appreciated.
Green today.
What target price should I expect after earnings report?
150 june 2021
Pam muted!
Blooodbath Monday. A lot of pro trading friends cashed out today.

We can realistically see 150 tomorrow
you Appl stock holders are in bed with China you need to wake up until China changes it's diplomacy Etc. you really should support the USA friendly businesses. just do some research maybe and you should have a change of heart. besides Appl is still the same price per share it was 8 months ago and the Dow is near record highs.

"For those who sold last week at a loss, they basically have no idea about investment strategy. They don’t know what the business they were holding and they don’t know the values business generates over time m. All they can do is staring at the most useless thing called stock price and speculate the future. Most of time, they are making wrong bets. Stock price is the result, not cause. Fundamentals are the real cause that serious investors should focus on."
"Some amateur traders on this thread. I've been invested in apple since (2012) and has split twice. I sold too many shares once to take profit and I regretted that. This is a golden buying opportunity, never hit the gift horse in the mouth. Most other stocks are a temporary distraction. Look at their bread and butter products coupled with their enormous potential to branch into the electrical vehicle future. Aaple will have huge pops in consecutive days leaving you #$%$ if you are on the sidelines."

Days over. The abuse starts up again in 8 hours.
Apple has always gone up in the long run. Not sure why everyone is so worried about a few bucks.
"Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If you day trade stocks you get no values and your trading strategy will fail eventuraly. If you buy cheap stocks and you get no values either, the longer you hold the risker it will be. But, for a great business like Apple, the longer you hold, the more value it will generate. Eventually, the price reflects the intrinsic value and makes you rich."

"Apple has been working on an EV for years... now is time to put the vehicle into a production facility...all will be surprised with the vehicle when it comes out as a prototype sooner than later... it will be amazing.

How many red days in the past 2weeks?
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again ... ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR APPL NOT TO BE AT $150.00 RIGHT NOW!
"tomorrow, the AAPL casino opens for betting, up or down?"

AAPL is my largest stake but WKHS is definitely very interesting and relatively cheap at 16.80Holding for 60 bucks.
"The motto here is ""Everyone wets their beak.""Last month it has been a traders sandbox. Earlier I showed the four pyramids with $136 being the ""line in the sand"" With earnings on 1/27 after the close, this week may follow a different script. There may be a steady run-up into 1/27.Just a hunch"
Last Friday was the weakest dead cat bounce I've ever seen. This is heading to the 100 day MA tomorrow. $124!
I would love to see an Apple Car Teaser during Sunday's Super Bowl. Unveil a hint of the secrecy.
Some thing coming soon that will raise AAPL to new Highs. GLTA
"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported better-than-expected fiscal-year first quarter results, aided by strong iPhone momentum, especially in China.The Apple Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty maintained an Overweight rating on Apple and increased the price target from $152 to $164.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and $175 price target.Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated an Outperform rating and increased the price target from $150 to $160.Needham analyst Laura Martin maintained a Buy rating and hiked the price target from $140 to $170.Why Apple Could Be Set For Double-Digit Growth: The combination of larger installed base, fully refreshed product portfolio and continued working and learning from home trends suggest Apple is on track to report strong double-digit growth over the next several quarters, Morgan Stanley's Huberty said in a note.The iPhone's strength, especially in China, and across-the-board Services upside contributed most of the beat, and gross margin expanded about two points, the analyst said.Although Apple did not provide formal revenue guidance, it said it expects normal seasonal trends, suggesting revenue of about $76 billion to $78 billion, she said.This is about $3 billion ahead of the consensus, Huberty said.The active device installed base growth accelerated from 7% a year ago to 10% and services monetization grew at the fastest rate in several years, the analyst said.Customer loyalty remains well north of 90% across Apple products, she said.Morgan Stanley now estimates 2020-2025 revenue CAGR of 10%, thanks to accelerating installed base growth, improved services monetization and a recovery in China. Higher gross margins are sustainable given growing FX tailwinds and a continued mix uplift across products, Huberty said.""Net, we raise our forward revenue and margin estimates with FY21 EPS increasing 6% to $4.47 and FY22 EPS increasing 8% to $4.61, both materially above consensus.""Buybuybuy "

"Way oversold, Should be back above $135 quickly, tomorrow. Apple always rises above when there are doubters."
Most of the US markets are down since last week and it’s related to US economy! I guess.. personal opinion!!!!
After lunch is when the Algos will start buying! After all it’s the close that counts!
Way too many down days recently. I think we are due for a massive up day soon like a 5-6% move up back to 138
"Hilarious. Don’t care if we’re down. I’ve been in since 1999. Huge upside starting tomorrow. Best guess, and educated one, 165 in 2 weeks."
am I the only one who is glad cheap kia is not producing apple cars?
When will the carnage end? When the 10 year yield stops moving up and starts to move down. Patience
this is happening because of big hedge funds there manipulating the the stock by selling millions of shares and then buying them back when there down 10 to 20 % don't be fooled by the we need to start a Reddit tread on Apple so the big hedge funds loss the billions instead of the small investor
Best company in the world.
Futures recovering fast...might have a nice rally tomorrow...
Was anyone really convinced it will go down for long. This thing is made to grow.
7 weeks gains temporarily lost ... ;-(

"HOLD THE LINE, to those trading it, as long as we hold above 132.50 stock is in an upward trend. Recent sell off low volume. Investor Day a couple weeks out. Hold the Line."
either it gets worse than March or this is like buying in March
Trend line support break? Me thinks so.
When the stock does this in after hours be prepared for the mighty loss to follow in the morning. It will sink and we have to digest it. It starts to become normal to lose every day. My gains are almost null. What a great investment APPLE is. I like the picture pal.

"So there are three fun possibilities for Apples  future: 1. The car. 2. AR headset/glasses and cryptocurrency . That’s not including iPhone sales, services and the watch! Being long is a no brainer!"
"Its been months since Apple announced a 4 for 1 stock split ..All the good news , RECORD earnings , raising their dividend and still hasn't come close to any of the price targets ! I think it's in the group of most manipulated stocks now . Wall Street says..... You think this is easy money ???? We sell on purpose and will let you know when it will rise ! No reason this should be in the red after all these months !"
"Hey People you still don’t understand, AAPL don’t need stocks, they earn $ 111B per quarter! "
Many newbie investors scoff at Apple’s dividend payout. What they don’t get is how annual raises to said dividend increase your yield VERSUS your cost basis. My cost basis in Apple (after the split) is about $28. An .82 annual dividend against a $28 cost basis is pretty darn good. Now consider that same cost basis in 10 years when Apple is paying $2 per share in dividends annually.That’s how this works.

Oh Good CNBC right now. Every trader is trimming Apple. Say expect $120's wonderful.
Here's the article from Barron's. I wouldn't want to mislead anyone in thinking these were my original thoughts. Cutting and pasting is so dishonest.https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-bought-tesla-apple-microsoft-stock-sold-att-51613063598?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
Apple diluted it's shares so bad trying to get more investors and affordability. That's wasn't a smart move in that they are buying their shares back. I hope this stock rises to 200 this month where it belongs.
I have a feeling Apple is going to overdeliver tomorrow ...
"Remember when it went from 126 to 145 in 5 days, its going to do it again, from 135 to 155. Its coming soon to a theatre near u!"

Buy the company of products you love and own. Apple products are by far the most intuitive
It’s a love hate relation with Apple stock. You have to be patient. It’s the most widely owned stock by retail investors and marketManagers. It’s usually the biggest holding in most large cap Index funds. You have to have the stomach to hold this stock long term. Just buy it and stop watching itEveryday unless you are trading it

"If gme goes up, then apple will go down cuz the big hedge funds who tried to short GME will have to sell their blue chip stocks to cover"

Why should apple make and sell a car when they can license technology to all car companies instead and avoid lots of liabilities auto companies always gets?

Going to be hard for this to make a move up in the future too many shares outstanding. I think the last split was a mistake.
Why anyone would short apple is beyond me
"Apple tends to launch its tablets in Spring, and it looks like next month will see a new iPad revealed. And, surprisingly, it could be a new iPad Pro. That would be a surprise because it’s only a year since the last Pro upgrade, which saw the introduction of a LiDAR scanner and two cameras, with an updated processor. Serial leaker Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, who has a pretty strong track record for new releases tweeted that “AirTags are still on for March” and, when quizzed about iPad Pro, said, “Also March.”The Pro will have a miniLED display. With miniLED, each pixel is individually illuminated, giving rise to deeper black hues and greater contrast levels. This is a really exciting development.Plus, it’s possible that this will come alongside a new iPad mini, which hasn’t been updated in a long time, so it may make sense to reveal the two models together. This iPad mini, rumors suggest, will have a much bigger display, 8.4in against the current 7.9in, with slimmer bezels and Touch ID."

"I think Apple has a great strategy for EV, recall Tesla started off by buying GM/Toyota plant in Fremont CA. Apple partnering with Kia to manufacture EVs in Georgia or just building models there is a great strategy, by chosing Kia, Apple is guaranteed to lead in the technology required for the venture, at the time Apple will be dominant in Microprocessors, G5, Smartphones space ... thinks its a great move with lots of synergy to fend off ANY competition"

"Daryanani maintains his Overweight rating and $163 price target on Apple shares.Apple's growth strategy in recent quarters has been driven in part by expansion of its services business, which includes subscription offerings in music, video, gaming, and fitness, among other things.

And the early signs on services revenue for the March quarter are looking good, as well.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note Tuesday that Apple (ticker: AAPL) App Store revenue grew 30% in February for ""another strong month."" He estimates that App Store developer revenue was $4.4 billion in the quarter, up 30%, after gains of 40% in January and 31% in December.The analyst notes that Wall Street models call for services growth to decelerate to 16% in the March quarter, but he thinks the ongoing strength in app downloads point to ""an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates.""Daryanani estimates that Apple should be able to grow services at a 19% compounded growth rate through the September 2024 fiscal year, at which point revenues from the segment would top $100 billion. He thinks that will include $29 billion from Apple Music and $6 million from Apple Pay.He also expects Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ to gain transaction over the next five years, with 80 million to 90 million subscribers each. At $100 billion, he adds, services would be 30% of Apple's overall revenue and 45% of gross profit."
Sadly it not long ago that Bears were saying this would be under $100 because 70 million people were going to return in their iPhones. It’s like when people say they are quitting social media for good.

Buffet, Gates, Cuban hedge funds, sellingtheir technology stocks and buying oil, crypto currencies andBetting on higher interest rates.“Free money” that Nancy and Chuckie Shmuckie are throwing around is going to cause motherof all inflations.

New month! Futures should be green! Go Apple 
Buying and buying. If it goes down tomorrow i am buying again until it reach the dip. Future of earth is with apple who cares about the Mars! Period!
"So, Hyundai today unveiled the IONIQ 5, which is very impressive by all means. Even more so is the platform beneath it. If $AAPL and HyundaiKia get together, then $TSLA is really, really toast."

New all time high and they haven't even reported earnings yet.
I think in just about two weeks all sorts of folks are gonna wish they never panicked and sold their tech
"I have said this hundreds of times, this is not a stock you trade. The pattern of some selling after great earning is predictable, but if you are a new investor this is the time to load the boat for the future. Who sell's a stock that just made around $112 billion in a quarter and is in a 5G super cycle? If you do sell it, where do you put your money? This stock will run to $170 by the Spring and I believe be approximately $200 by the end of the year."
"After Berkshire trimmed , look at the $ value $ As of September of last year, Berkshire Hathaway owned Apple stock valued at $111.7 billion, up from shares valued at $73.7 billion in September of 2019. Even after selling shares last quarter, Buffett’s investment in Apple is valued at around $120 billion, according to Bloomberg.Selling off small pieces of its stake in Apple gives Berkshire Hathaway funds to invest in other equities, although the firm still concentrates on investments in established, mostly non-high-tech firms. Buffett also has trimmed investments in some banks, including long-time favorite Wells Fargo, and beefed up investments in health care stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, while selling his remaining stake in Pfizer.Along with the Apple trim, Buffett opened new stakes in Verizon, Chevron, Marsh & McLennan, and EW Scripps. The Verizon stake was a big one, with Buffett paying $8.62 billion for 147 million shares. The carrier's stock now accounts for 3% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.Additionally, he dropped Pfizer, JPMorgan Chase, Barrick Gold, M&T Bank, and PNC Financial entirely and grew stakes in T-Mobile by 117%, in Kroger by 34%, and in Merck by 28%."

We’re marching towards more Stimulus !AAPL going up !
"Between 9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down at one point (44.4%) during this period. Steve Jobs had just died in October 2011 and Tim Cook had taken over the jobs a few months prior. Apple would not recover until Apple announced the 7 for 1 stock split in June 2014. People who purchased the stock in late 2013 through the mid point of 2014 are up 500-550% today if they held all shares.Conclusion: Apple ran after the stock split and those who were patient were rewarded. Apple's stock gain during 2014 was 37.72%Between 2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down (32.1%) at one point in this period. Conclusion: Apple started to run in the beginning parts of 2017 and rewarded stock holders with a huge 46.11% return by the end of 2017.Between 10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, Apple was down from its all time high and at one point during late December 2018 was down (38.7%).Conclusion: Those who hung on saw an epic 86.16% return in 2019.Between 2/10/2020 to about 3/16/2020, 36 days, Apple was down 31% from its all time high. The world was in panic over COVID. Then the first first stimulus came 3/23/20 and Apple recovered.Conclusion: Those who were patient were rewarded with an outstanding 82% return of Apple is 2020."

TSLA should be $142.00. Apple should be $800.00.
MSFT is the right place to be now. Apple down trends may likely continue until 124 ranges.
The daily candlesticks on AAPL's chart for the last 2 days have long lower shadows which I believe indicates a bullish setup. I think next week is going to be a good AAPL week. We are definitely overdue for one. Good luck all!
I'm hoping this turns green tomorrow just for a penny would be good.

"I got some Apple in the 126 and change range a few couple of weeks back. My cash basis is 27 dollars or something 3k+ shares. But if it happens to drop again to around that price, I’ll be buying!"

Just sick and tired of apple  lot of hype but the stock price went down a lot.
Apple down 18% from highs with recent record earnings & revenue report. I would bet from here it will hold up better than the average stock in a correction. I will buy another 100 shares for every 5% decline from this price.
"Let's go Apple, I think some fresh news will help. Maybe a Bitcoin investment, or an agreement over the new electri car (hopefully with FORD). Something to boost our confindence moving forward.

Was this simply a set-up for Monday? Before this happen we warned to take profits on Feb 26 options; didn't we? Why? Because this has happen before."

My only disappointment is that I don’t have more $ to invest in appl. I’ll be even more disappointed in the next few months when this is back to 140.

Hasn't done anything but trade sideways since the split ! The only good thing is it gives a dividend !
Apple was mentioned on WallSteetBets over 10000 times over the GME saga. that's a lot of paperhands retail investors who probably bought in the 140s.
today is the washout day.... if it gets down to 120 I will do some buying then again at 116 if we continue the correction. right nowdown 16% on our way to 20-21% correction.. that puts this around 116-118 where it will bottom for now. just be prepared. the buyers will come in quick and move this up 5-7 bucks in a day.
Where is Tim? Apple stock getting gutted and he’s playing with Facebook.
Hi guys. Just a quick question here. Sorry I am new to trading. What is the target date when analyst rates the stock? 
"I wonder why the market continues to indicate down. Hmmm. What’s different? We did all the right things. We elected an dementia patient as leader of the free world. No, that couldn’t be it.... Maybe the conflict Joe has with his son and China? No, that couldn’t be it... Maybe it’s the Chinese influence as a whole inflected upon American culture at large, education,finance, Research and development and corporate usurpation? No, that couldn’t be it... etc"
"The numbers should blow away the estimates, but what will really matter will be how the services sector is doing? What Cook says about services will determine how investors react to the earnings call IMO? Hardware purchases are a big chunk of Apples revenue, but services are the the future! I think the direction that the share price takes after the earnings call will be determined by what cook has to say about Apple's services sector?"
Now it is oversold!!!
People this stock was at $400 before the split what you scared for it will get there again takes time and this is a great and SAFE investment park it and leave it alone
We all know any day this stock is due for a massive breakout. Any day..... wait for it 
Having cash on the sidelines is nice. I think tomorrow things will change. People will load up and back over $140 this week
"IMO, if you have money in the bank ,move it ALL in AAPL.Who agrees?"
"Truly amazing!Before earnings, the Jan 29 $130/$135 call spread was 80% at $4.Here we are!"
This is so depressing :(
"I fully expect this to take off once earnings is released. If it happens to dip some, just means we buy more shares. If you are in Apple, you arent in here for a quick buck. You are ok with the build and stack approach."
What percentage of this stock do you think is owned and controlled by institutions? 80%? More? It seems like they just sell millions of shares to scare people into selling then immediately buy it back.
"Apple has won 3 Project Titan patents today relating to 3D AR Windshield Display, a Next-Gen Airbag System & more"

The strongest and most profitable action an investor can take at this point is to simply hold.

"Yes, Apple will increase their dividend during their Q1 earnings.....as they do every year and WILL do every year for the next 25+ years. It’s one of MANY reasons that holding Apple = winning."
Hope some miracle happens to get this to 150 ...
"NOTHING is normal with this current market–All of AAPL gains erased in the last 2 minutes because of????WS has become a casino. Fundamentals, record earnings, PE ratios mean NOTHING now.Have a great weekend."
Futures is starting to not look so good yikes. We all know what happens to apple when futures are not good.
I would buy aapl at these lower prices but I’m too overweight and told myself not to anymore. Re-opening and better economy only helps Apple as more people are willing to spend and people who have pulled money out of stocks will re-enter the market. Buffett selling is just his underlings locking in some profits. They sold when it was higher and they will buy back in eventually. And they have more shares after the split. If aapl never split twice in the past decade it’s price would be over 3800. It’s a statement to a company that has great consistent revenue even in a downturn and great operating margins compared to other businesses.
Why buy an overvalued bubble stock. Oh because it's Apple.
As soon as the options rake sweeps the board clean and you all give up...she spikes.

"DOWN EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST 7 DAYS. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. COOK DO SOMETHING TO INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES MORALE OR RESIGN. REMEMBER, HAPPY INVESTORS ARE HAPPY CUSTOMERS"

another great shorting experience
Lol AAPL is roughly 10 points away from. It’s resistance of $140 with an ATH above that and people claim this is going down the tubes just because of a little haircut. This consolidation will seem like a gift in the future. Apple is going to continue to do what it does which is make great products for its customers and all the Apple fans will continue to support it. Invest and hold long term not only because of capital gains taxes but also to reap the fruits of an excellent American Enterprise.
"People have been telling me AAPL is done ever since I bought my first shares at $3.08 in 2007. I'm glad I never sold, and glad I've added along the way."
There’s better stocks them apples so you can get a better returns for the quarter of the money that you buy Apple stock when you can double your money easily they have a positive EPS 
"Slowly but surely AAPL is showing a comeback, hopefully  by market closing."
We are going up today

I'm so glad that my Apple & Amazon shares finally decided to wake up from their 5 month long hibernation. These 2 stock have gone nowhere since August and my Tesla shares had had to shoulder the burden for my portfolio. Now Apple & Amazon can take over and give my Tesla shares a break.
5 out of the last 6 days in the red
"Don’t like how AAPL seems to be getting bought and sold in sync with TSLA, as in same investment bucket. You can’t group a stock with PE +1000 with one only 34"
Another poll - How many are long AAPL? How many trade AAPL?
Apple needs to keep going down. It’s overvalued. Everything is overvalued. Excited to make money in this market crash
"Apple will be at $135 by the end of this week. And in the ball park of $137-139 before earnings. You can see an upside from the earning of 5-8%, making this stock go to $147 to $155. I am ready to bet on this. Dan From web bush said this quarter will be a blockbuster!! $116-125 billion in revenue. Let’s go"
Get ready for a stock split at Microsoft. The Microsoft Shorts are getting Clobbered.
"Sooner or later, everyone will have to come back to tech since entire S&P index depends on tech valuation."
Didn’t see anything on this big news....Apple hires former Porsche VP of chassis design...
"I-Kia will be great for customers, not so much shareholders. It's a money pit to make, market and service cars. On the contrary, Apple's money stack is very high. No rush to buy at these inflated prices."
"Based on the record setting quarter, I'm revising my dividend forecast. Beginning with the April/May dividend and continuing for the rest of the year, Apple will most likely raise the quarterly dividend between 8 to 12%. If I'm correct, I will claim full bragging rights. :)You don't necessarily invest in Apple for the dividend itself but hey at least it helps. I've always reinvested my dividends in the past, and have had zero regrets at this point."
Apple + Kia
We can thank Buffet’s comment. Apple = His Family Jewel. 
Interesting video on CCIV and apple.... $CCIV Lucid Motors Partnering with $AAPL Apple!?! - YouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vbtiIr6Ev8
"When it dipped just below it’s 200 day moving average, it made a nice bounce up. That is a sign of strength and was good to see. Will it hold is the question"
BOTH AMAZON AND APPLRE BOTH HAD GREAT QUARTERSWHY ARE BOTH STOCK GOING DOWN EACH DAY
"Wells Fargo & Company is very positive to AAPL and gave it a ""Overweight"" rating on January 28, 2021. The price target was set to $155.00 → $160.00. Over the last 30 days, this security got 25 buy, 0 sell and 10 hold ratings."
"the market is favoring small caps now. large caps like apple are out of favor. why don't you sell now, so I could buy more shares."
If you want to make money on Apple you have to wait years. That’s how slow this stock is. Once I break even I’m out and getting in a real money maker.
"I was warning you all morning. This was 5 hours ago:""Massive sell off is coming. Today $124, EOW $119."""
i’ve been in the stack for 10 years and this is one of the worst performing years that I’ve ever seen an apple. i’ve never seen them not pay off in six months.￼￼
AAPL is ready to break trend. Buy buy it will hit new high today. AMAZON will send AAPL above 150 load up with both hand. Borrow from grandma if you can
"All of these Wallstreet Bets stocks will crash, they have no fundementals. Stay the course, buy high quality stocks and etfs. The diligent investor will win in the end. $MSFT $NIO $AAPL $ARKW $VGT $TSLA $TQQQ $XLK"
If Amazon pushes up great earnings all techs are up tomorrow even aapl
"Investors day tomorrow. Could push price 10% up in one day if something new, or could continue bleeding to 119."
"Once again, may I direct your attention to a one year AAPL chart . . . or a two year chart . . . or a five year chart. After the last earnings report, do you really think it is going to stop all of a sudden?111 BILLION in revenue!Own it and sleep like a baby!"
I feel sorry for the hesitant people who didn’t buy last weeks discount.
"Who believes AAPL best 4-years are to come? Vote thumbs up! If you believe AAPL best 4-years have just passed, vote thumbs down!"
I Don’t need to sell and don’t need the money! Holding 5-10 years. Can’t wait to see the splits and accumulation of shares.￼
"Let's see, incredible quarterly report, stock price drops 4%, will open lower tomorrow. My opinion, some manipulation at play. No rational reason a stock should drop that much after a great report, even in a down market; unless the fundamentals no longer mean anything."
"Expert and market maker, smart money and shorties insitution knows AAPL will gap up after hours above 150. AMAZON will send indexes huge due to consumer expenditure in the rise despite covid. Now with new stimulus will grow even higher indexes. I am loading on AAPL, AMZN or MCD at any pulldown to buy more"
Apple = 
After Fed economic policies update 2 PM the market will U turn upside. Stay positive relax and stay AAPL long.
"this stock is gonna sweep the earnings, i cant wait for the faces tommorrow when people rush to push this to 170... apple car or no apple car, apple delivers"
Good news is the ^TNX closed down today
$4.00 a share drop in last 2 minutes with huge volume.... Someone is manipulating the stock??
Stock hustler analysts are frantically pumping their books on all the business news TV shows today. A solid indication of fear. One day does not break the downtrend from the 140s for AAPL which remains firmly intact. Stimulus was already priced into the market 2 months ago.
"""With stimulus, go big. Interest rates are 1 percent, can we make more than 1 percent by investing in the American people? yes, we can."
I just picked up some more AAPL on the dip. I couldn’t resist the bargain!
The bad news was the lack of guidance and the color cook gave on the callAbout poor wearables and services revenue for the next quarter. It’s been red ever since. If we break 130 today the. It’s down to 124 split price. Thanks Tim Cook for the shareholder value. That would be nothing since august
The SEC needs to halt all the kiddie stocks that the kids are betting on for 30 days. It’ll be coming. Watch
get ready to see apple report it's first $100 billion quarter in history
"I was at Walmart earlier today. The store clerk in electronics said that they have been out of iPads, many of the apple watches, xboxes, and playstations for about 2 1/2 weeks. Apple, Microsoft, and Sony should all have a good fourth quarter."
i’m long apple never selling
"BofA’s flow data showed on Friday, that when hedgies sold Apple to cover their shorts, big money was buying. Deep-pocketed investors pumped a record $4.2 billion into big technology stocks last week, especially AAPL, taking advantage of the slight pullback."
"buy and ride to $150, it's just a matter of time. after the split in 2014, apple was saturated for a while until it took off. don't jump onto the boat too late"
Apple went to Kia for the best deal and now apple will be going to other car companies for a better deal like Honda hopefully
"Sorry guys, but when I see some of you hope for 140$. You will never see again apple on 140$. I am not bearish, I hold Apple stock from 2011, but be realistic, nothing more can push apple stock price. If after record earnings stock price is tanking you know what to do. EV? Tesla is 10 years ahead with this compared to apple. Next stop here is 125$, and then fast sell off to 119. Today we sit on same price from 6 months ago."
"You all need to calm down. Apple is the number one owned company in the world. This means that plenty of scared retail owners get shaken out when the shorts come out to play. Right now, the shorts are playing with us. Eventually, they get tired and find a new target. ESPECIALLY, when they get squeezed when some positive Apple news comes out. Just wait. This is the best company in the world."
"Once Covid is history, people will put discretionary spending much more on stuff that they couldn't enjoy during Covid... things like travel and leisure. Apple's product sales will go down. Long $DIS, $ABNB, $BNKG, short $AAPL"
"This is how the ultra rich gets richer, the poor becomes even poorer, they control the market they dump high you buy high from them, then they keep selling as it lower and lower to profit off you. Say no to such wealth transfer !"
"Nah , aapl reached oversold territory"
"Oh good up .24 cents Friday and back down again today on a green day. This stock is such dead money. 6 MONTHS you could have bought BA, C, JPM, DKNG, CVS, URI, FB, XOM all legit companies and gained."
Apple stock is not a Blue Chip stock anymore. This thing moves like it's a LAGGARD!
This is good. Really good
"A korean company, LG innotek, that supplies camera module to Iphone just posted a HUGE earning surprise. If you know what that means"
"I have an idea, let cook to release bad news about iPhones being delayed or a recall and I guarantee that the stock will go up. Bad new = invest in the company. Not going to be around next year, let’s invest in that company"
118 to 128 today. Glad I took it.
Look at those futures! Are they for real?
"Tried trading this stock several times , big mistake . Missed out on some big moves . Apple is the definition of a growth stock !"

Even if AAPL is down .80 today still for the week we are up 6.00. So on 1.000 shares you are up 6K. Stop complaining just hold long and average out a hefty profit. APPLE will NOT disappoint.
"don't be like this stock. their car will compete with many car companies. the middle East will continue to drop the barrel price for oil making the electric cars uneconomical, no matter what green deals are inforced."

Fixed-income investors worldwide – whether pension funds, insurance companies or retirees – face a bleak future."""
Sea of red today.
"why Apple is on the down trend, even though the market is very GREEN?? Any thoughts?"
Take advantage of the ups and down swings guys. Will trade sideways for a bit cuz nasdaq went up too fast
"Buffett has sold 95 million shares in the last 2 quarters. at this rate, his holdings will be done in 4.5 years."
Previous posts about that algorithim play were an explanation not an Enticement to play.People can get seriously hurt if they are inexperienced.
"We thought they would stop wasting our time and money after 4 years, nope."
"Buffett is betting on 5g technology with Verizon and t mobile. his apple trimming by his managers, makes no sense. apple is the biggest beneficiary."
Power hour folks! Let's do 130 by eod!
"Yahoo message boards are poisonous and of no use. There are many better than this. Try Investors Hub or, The Lion."
"If you're an optimist, at least you can see the Dividend % increasing as this Tech Titan continues to Tank! When will it turn around....where's the bottom? Timmy???"
"I'm not one to try to force predictions from patterns, but this is a textbook cup and handle, even with low volume on the handle side. Soon the March event will be scheduled and the forces will combine to what I think is a steady melt upwards toward the high 130s, and probably a 140s rally the week of the event."
Post your positions.Me I have 2000 shares at average cost of 129 a share holding for 10 years.Remember stay strong and classy.
Any serious catalyst coming in for rebound?
Let’s close over 130 USD!
iPhone 13 could be Apple’s first with an always-on displayhttps://www.cultofmac.com/735202/iphone-13-could-be-apples-first-with-an-always-on-display/
I forgot about the done deal vote of the stimulus package and you add that we’re in the oversold territory = a solid bullish reversal day!
"I own about 8,200 shares and will never sell. Apple is a long term hold. Buy the dips and enjoy the ride. Patience is key."
NVDA just forecast next Q earnings above analysts' expectations
"I'm the schmuk that bought Apple at $144.50 and added to my shares at $130, $123..... It's been a difficult month."
"Appl, amzn, googl, msft all selling off as the bubble has popped on all the crazy high flyers with no PE’s, mostly everything that cathy woods is invested in. This bubble pop dragging down whole nasdaq. But aapl, amzn, googl, msft not in a bubble and are the most profitable companies in the world. Hold on tight as these companies will bounce!!!"
"This correction will reverse soon. Since the early 1900s, the S&P 500 has tended to fall 5% from recent highs a few times a year -- and notches a steeper 10% or more plunge about once every year to year and a half. These events are always temporary and reverse course again quickly. If looking for a “crash”, that already happened last March."
Nasdaq lost all Monday gains (+400) last 2 days. It might run sideways until they pass the 1.9 T stimulus!!
When guys like this are buying and sellingstocks we've hit a top for sure pal.
New unique products from AAPL will take the stock to new heights in the next month or so.....I will keep buying on the dip.
This thing will be lucky to hit $150 in Q3 of this year. It’s all there in the fundamentals if you care to check. This stock is fully valued at around $125 right now
the stock is highly manipulated apple headquarters should take actions.. I can't believe there is shorting everyday over 1$
I’m just waiting for Apple’s iCar event to happen one day. Then you guys will see this stock rise up to $200 and you will be wondering why you sold your stocks because you saw a few red days.
"If you're not buying the AAPL dip I guess you don't care about making money. That was the best quarter in the history of the Iphone and they still took AAPL down. This quarter is proving to be much like last quarter...the good quarters are being punished as if they were bad. And of course the GME short squeeze has a stranglehold on real winners such as this name. The market is long overdue for a sanity check in the bubble names like GME, AMC, BBBY, NOK, etc. AAPL will be bought back once the dust settles and the shorts who think they are winning right now will be smoked. AAPL is real gold. GME is bricks that are painted gold."
Will Apple get to a $10 Trillion market cap this decade?
Definitely my most boring stock but I’ll just hold and forget about it this time.
"It all comes to an end - March 1, 2021. We’ll start flying then "
Today for sure it will hit 125 due to option calls ....next week easy 135 ...recovery will be fast as it will be pumped huge in premarket as per previous trends ....this is the best chance ever to make money ...get in now ..
"why couldn't Apple board tie Cooks Stock option to stock performance? They are giving him free stock, why would he care if prices is the same as 6 months ago? End of day, it is the stock price that evaluates a company, not how great your products are or how much money you make."
We will probably retest the 118 low from the Tuesday flash crash and the market will probably open down big. Nasdaq will be down another 300-400 which will put it over 10% into correction. Next week we recover. Just do some shopping on this dip
Is still a good time to buy at today's price around $136.68 per share?
"Bang, Bang, Bang . . . and AAPL will be $95. (One shot is worth $10.)Holding is not advised. Too precarious."
buy the dip. i don't think one stock has gone down since March. government will just print more money if Apple goes down.
Great day to pick up some more BABA and $AAPL! Many others on sale but I’m liking those 2 today - I did complete the BABA trade but hoping AAPL comes down to $125 first!!
"I would never short apple, but I think this is too much? Why does it have a 40 PE ratio? It historically was between 10-20. Can anyone explain?"
"Apple selling bonds? Not quite sure why they need to do this now with 80 + billion in cash!The tech giant said it will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including buying back stock and paying dividends. It may also be used in funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition and repayment of debt, the person said."
"This is classic manipulation. Oh wait, posters only say that when the stock drops. My bad. LOL"
"my friend say he will nevernever buy aslowslow moveup applestock again ,he willbuythetop15 high flyerstock everyday for a50 to 300 percent move up ,everyday thierisalway15 high flyer stock . my friend sold apple because it move up too too slow for a couple of dollar $2 moveup. and then bought gme sold it made 85,00o yesterday he said if he held longer he would have made 150,000 thousand"

Longs ride it up and ride it down! Enjoy the ride longs. Soon it will be back up over $145 and you will be glad you held. Once Tim Cook announces car team it will blow past $150

"well, you guys in usa know better. What about the news from R&D departments? We hear that apple work on self-driving cars. It may cause a fast run on stock when there is some clear information about it. I think there must be some news like that for higher prices"
"Guys why do any of you care about the day to day on apple, come check back in 10 years, it’s apple for god sakes, why would anyone day trade it? It’s APPLE, compounding interest for 20 years and see how your doing"
"where are the buybacks, where is the car deal? Cook do something to the stock"
"Apple TV + is just in it’s beginning stages. Right now Apple is giving away free subscriptions to people who buy a new iPhone or other Apple products. Netflix was doing something similar but with there free monthly trials. Apple is a much bigger company and Apple TV came out very recently. When Netflix first came out, it’s share pricewas about $10 a share. Apple’s current stock price doesn’t even reflect the amount of money they will be bringing in from investors. This is guaranteed monthly income from future subscribers. In less than 5 years we could see massive stock price growth from just Apple TV +. Apple has also partnered with studious around the world to deliver the best content. One of these studios is Wild Brain! Wild Brain delivers children’s content such as Snoopy series, teletubbies, and massive content on YouTube. If you want to check out Wild Brain’s stock ticker, here it is: WLDBF. I highly recommend investing in this. Wild brain could be the next Netflix."
Here we go boys and girls... I've been waiting for this pull back. Time to start buying
yesss baby!!!
When is Yahoo going to put the bearish signal on Apple... goes down every day.....
Did people forget stocks go up and down? Why’s everybody complaining. You chose to go into this company..
"Tomorrow, trend higher headed back to all time high"
I’m not a expert but from what you all can see on stock market is a big chase for easy money Speculation stocks etc cannabis company’s without products from space ... when this will all over all them will buy back apple Microsoft google amazin etc .
"Think , do not worry I still have 450 shares of Apple. Holding ABNB cash for buying back great stocks for another round of correction next week!"
"Agree, AAPL after the Split is on the same level of a bubble as Tesla, gone up 400% in a year while the economy is getting much worse than 2019 is pure Bubble."
i dont hold a lot of shares but given the price drop i can at least accumulate shares and build a good position for the future.
Down 4 on 70 millions shares. Worry when its down 5 or more on 300 million shares.
"I was warning you for days that apple is going down,I'm telling you this from 132, first will go to122 and than 119. Listen to me. First buy need to be at 119. Then you buy each time you can. The lowest we can expect in $104, but $119 is crucial for this correction. Don't panic. Be smart."
margin calls forcing more sales of stock on credit
"How is this so hard to understand, APPLE is range bound because no news is on the horizon for a little while. If it goes up, there are people to sell, if it goes down, there are people to buy. Any historic peaks are caused by transient events and do not necessarily indicate steady state behaviour."
"Fair Value $175 for 2021, $225 for 2022. Will be crazy not to back up the truck."
"Last time AAPL printed $133+ as an intra day low, the next day it printed $137+Given tomorrow it option expiration, I think that is a far reach but maybe $136 is not ."
Let’s go green !!
It’s no point to cry everyday . If inflation will go up money will be safe in stocks and this will happen
what happened toward the end!? why the sudden drop?
A lot of volume in apple 
Apple fair value is right around low $120s. Will stay flat until at least next earnings.
Pretty simple stuff here kids. 10% run up the last 5 days into earnings. Profit taking (sell) on the news. The idea of the market is to make $ not spending all your time bashing each other based on if you are long or short. Been in appl for years both long and short and currently long. Great report today and won’t lose a minute of sleep because it’s down AH.
Like I said...you better hope the market indexes don’t dive. It will drop this to sub 130 by weeks end.
Profit taking about to dry up
"APPL , pure manipulation by the company, stock drops 3 dollars a share as soon as the Company starts buying, this is also against the law. They cant bid down the stock in the closing minutes....but they do..."
I hope they have been loading up on the buyback!
the lowest volume of the year today on a analyst upgrade from RBC.
"So Apple is gonna make a car huh. With every car company in the world now taking production off line due to the chip shortage, ""where are you going to get the chips"". There's a chip SHORTAGE. My point here is that the chip shortage will last longer than most people think. New chip plants need to be built. I am buying LRCX, KLAC, and AMAT. Do your own DD. GLTA"
Bill gates trust sold aapl. Good luck diamond hands
"Apple is the pinnacle of American Enterprise. They will be like investing in JNJ in the 1960’s. Just one of those stocks you can buy, hold and compound forever."
"down bad on options, still i have faith that it will do a quick reversal at any moment"
Apple has over 1 billion users of their products on the planet. These are individuals who want the best products and are willing to pay a premium to have them. If they get 1/4% of those current Apple customers to buy their cars that is 2.5 million cars per year alone.
"no one want no one want apple anymore even last friday it sold off last hour of trading buffet andbill gatesold apple last week. because apple slowslowslow run up run down a few dollar every day, more down now becauseevery one isdumping apple no one want apple anymore thelast 4 week, because everyone want the top 15 highflyer stockthat come out everyday that goes up 50 to 300 percent everyday, why make afew few up anddown with apple when you can get ahighflyerstock that can go up $15 to20 to $100 50 to 300 percent up in a day or everyday ,no one want apple anymorre in 2021apple will crash below $70 in 2021 same with fang stock no one want fang stock anymore"
im glad this gamestop nonsense is over so people finally can start focusing on real growth stocks like apple
"almost down to the split price around 125... so a 20.00 haircut in three weeks or about 13% from 145 ath, and the dow is not even crashing or correcting yet. appears that apple is giving the correction it needs to continue higher.. my guess is we test 118 in a market melt down that would be 20% from the ath. the last time it took a downtrend it stopped around 22-23%. so maybe 10% more from here around 115-118 area."
Seems like 130 is a floor for now. Stay long stay strong 
"Apple could multiply their dividend 8 fold, and it still wouldn’t make a dent in their cash position"
"Cramer himself admitted on CNBC that he’s “never seen the guns like this. They can break shorts.”Speaking of GME, AAPL about to do the same!"
We just need Mr. Cook to say something. I hate that they let the stock tank and don’t PR along the way. Like help investors out with some Bitcoin news or hey we saw x number of signups from fitness +. Just say something
"So the past two weeks were great weeks for banks and energy sector. Once that does, all the money comes back to tech! Have a nice weekend!"
"After all that said and done, I’d rather see AAPL gain slowly but surely and at month end every month it’s averaging $8. Do the math end of year easy over 200. Nice slowly but surely and the longs always perpetually win."
"the market is a joke, cruises stocks all up solid companies down"
What’s going on in the market?
"Helping my fellow AAPL shareholders today with a purchase of the airpod max... Great for walking to dog, gym and airplanes for when travel comes back in the fall and winter "
Imagine they increase the current dividends about 10%? What would that make to the stock market.
"This is the ground level. When the iCar, iTrucks, iPlanes, itaxis, iMcMansions and iAirtaxis fill the world, it will be trading 500x what it is now."
Adding to Apple position tomorrow....these earnings just confirmed how undervalued Apple is
VXN is down 6.68% and VIX pretty much flat! A pretty sure indicator that the S&P and Nasdaq will rise today. Also Dow futures fair value is +140 as of now
"The Downtrend is crystal clear, You Buy high They keep Selling, non-stop cycle baiting to donate to Wall Street as Apple goes below $100."
The lousy SEC didn't investigate on last Friday's actions?
Now you know why they sold 15M shares in last 10 min on friday.
"Markets closed on Monday so I’ll be busy muting shorts, political posts and dubious negativity of AAPL. Tuesday we take off. "
"Like I said, 2021 ain’t apples year. Gotta wait to 2022 for the big gain again"
I told you all ! We need a short squeeze because today’s short positions are just a series of reckless bets ! They are only doing it because they can get away with it ! If people band together and try to squeeze them out who knows what would happen 
Best company of all time. No better place to put your money.
"Buffet and Cathie Wood selling, looks like i better of taking my resources somewhere else"
Big money and smart investors seeing APPL as way over sold are starting to pile back in! We will see $130 in the next few days and $140 next week!
Tony Bernstein talking about upcoming iCar and why it’s a very positive move by Apple and will transformThe Auto industry

"AAPL will always be a great, steady long-term hold. Do people think they will stop innovating? No way."
"Trend has reversed; now AAPL goes up; and those who only watched today will question why they didn’t buy at 133 or even 134, when AAPL was cheap"
What performance?? Shares have not moved anywhere in the last 9 months...Cook getting free shares which is why he does not care about share prices or investors sentiments.....We need $2 div and 100B buyback to reach $150....too many shares outstanding
MSFT rallied this morning right into end of day for their earnings report. Tomorrow lets see AAPL do the same. Good Luck
Tired of buying in dips. No more money to invest. Will just wait for the time
This stock has been a monster for investors with 80%+ returns in 2019 and 2020. A little lull in the stock is normal and a great opportunity for a new investor to jump onboard.
That is a first in a long time appl closed up today.
"Dkng up $12. in 3 days why did I sell out to add to AAPL last week. :( Yeah I'm trading !!!Since I bought in 2000 shares Sept 1st 2020. I have been down ALL but 5 or 6 days. Apple event and then earnings. It's not that AAPL is bad, it's the oppurtunity cost holding it. Dividend is tiny."
Can we move on now? Let’s Vaccinate 3 million people per day. Let’s be happy about something. Let’s go to Vegas.
I don’t think I’ve seen a final 10 minute slide like this from Apple on this magnitude.
I told you 4 hours ago massive sell off is coming. And this is when nasdaq is only 0.8% in red. Wait to see when will drop 2% in one day.
"If there is one thing Apple is great at, it’s figuring out how much disposable income you have for upgrading your phone and timing it’s obsolescence (constant glitching and battery death) to exactly the moment you can afford to upgrade"
"I rember back in September 2019 reading how aapl 18 pe, was historically high, and cant be sustained for long. I think it was around 55, split adjusted, then. now we got a 34 pe, thanks too fiat money. Can it go to 60 a share in a market crash, easy. I really hope not, but I'm not adding at this point."
this is the best market of all time. acting perfectly. 76 % in apple now.
"I wonder if people know what a portable gas powered generator is.......or an electric space heater is......or what a 50 foot extension cord is. Together, they can really make a difference. When the power goes out. What a great birthday or Christmas present idea........or $1,400 stimulus check idea. Buy one for yourself and one for each of your adult children who own a house. At some point you will be a hero."
thats how the market works now... 10 minute flash crash so they can cover their shorts and buy long positions and now we grind higher.
The drops are just enormous. Hard to justify holding.
"If Apple can’t rise today, it will be a while before it goes up. Dow is up over 200 and Apple is down."
Buy crm folks .. great bargain price

Is this a record for the amount of red days in a row??
It’s AAPL just hold forever and stop checking
Been long on Apple for quite some time - now on the sidelines - capital gains bill coming soon. Be worried - Apple is a market bellwether.... the market has begun a long overdue correction. Take your gains now -dangerous times ahead
YOO guys! if i want to open a position in APPL should i wait for a dip or buy right now.. its for long term
People panicking and selling for a bad price

"wow, 15m shares dumped in the last 10 mins"
Best part of being an Apple investor? You literally get paid for doing nothing.
"Apple is definitely not going to pursue its own search engine in a distant future, because Apple CEO Tim Cook is having some top priority projects under his wing now, such as Apple cars, Augment reality, podcast and streaming, healthcare and so on… So he doesn't like his work to be done in a rush and ended up a lemon which will tarnish ""APPLE"" brand reputation.Apple will continue it's to growth and thrive… Reputation is part of its biz moat."
"AAPL MADE 111 BILLIONS LAST QUARTER, OMG. SUPERCYCLE 5G IS IN THE BEGINNING. TO 170 ALL TARGETS RAISED"
Apple will transform the Auto industry as we know it. just think about it . They did it with the iPhone and they will do it with the iCAR.. The iCar will be so far advanced over any other EV out there and it will tie in with Apples ecosystem seamlessly .... Just watch
"WS lie about rising rates hurting tech. A company’s value is the sum of its after tax discounted cash flows. If one raises the discount rate it impacts equally the discounted cash flows of all companies. Rising rates does lower cash flows for companies with debt since interest expense increases. Therefore, a company like AAPL with no net debt is not impacted at all and to the extent competitors’s interest expense increases, AAPL wins!"
Apple partners with tsmc to make AR devices
"We better support them, Apple is going to donate 350 billion to America."

Told ya to short the close of the day. Never made such easy money.
Up $3.45 one day and down 43 cents the next ain’t nothing. That’s a normal market move. More news about their car plans is imminent. The next couple of months should be a fun ride
Hang in there longs don’t sell at a loss. Big news is coming. Apple won’t let down its hardcore holders.
"I'm going to continue to buy Apple as the company going forward has products like the Iphones, eye glasses and even the electric vehicle that will make this stock price look cheap. Then on top of it the subscription fee for having an app on there phone. They clearly have a ""MOAT"" there and some might even say a monopoly. No Apple has a lot of money and clearly there options to include even stock b uy backs are numerous. Investing is a slow get rich process and not a get rich quick scheme. That's why I would tell investors I have been investing for forty years and compounding my investments have paid off handsomely for me and I hope for you investors also. Good luck."
Nice W shape. Watch it close green.
apple is hiring engineers now to work on 6g technology already. apple will be over 201.45 by year end.

"Oh my God Target is being termed as “explosive results “. Profits up 66% sales up 21% in the last quarter and great future trend expectations. WOW! People are buying everything and anything specially electronic. But there is no need to talk to the shorts , the nay sayers and the doomy and gloomy people because that’s what they are . Now there are over 77 vaccines available around the world and they are all or mostly working. In the Great United States people are going back to work and business establishments are opening up and stimulus package is definitely on its way . So he focused and stay positive. By the over 90% of the companies met or beat expectations with overwhelmingly beating expectations in the last quarter"
"I bought about 1000 shares at $130 in early 2015. In the months following, my 130k investment went to 90k. Just 6 years after that initial investment, it’s now worth about $540k.The moral? Do nothing. HOLD Apple."
Apple always a winner. Just buy and sell it in 30 yrs!
haha Dow Jones really thought it could pull apple into the red. nice try Dow 
Been watching the 1 minute candles and there’s a pattern. There will be about 3-4 uptrend candles followed immediately by 1-2 red candles that completely eliminate the gains of the green candles.

Keep buying and hold!

"Apple Stock Could Surge 62% to $225, According to This AnalystShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have already climbed 79% over the past year, but will surge to new all-time highs in 2021.That's according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Today, Ives raised his price target on Apple's stock to $175from $160, but also laid out a bull case for why the stock could climb to as high as $225. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 26% over the stock's closing price of about $139 on Friday. It's his compelling argument for the bull case, however, that should have investors more excitedlives cited the potential for ""eye-popping"" iPhone sales, saying that checks of Apple's supply chain in Asia showed strong demand for the device. The analyst now believes Apple could have sold as many as 90 million iPhones during the December quarter, roughly 35% over the analyst's already robust forecast. Ives sees this upward trend continuing over the March and June quarters.""We believe based on the current trajectory and in a bull case Cupertino has potential to sell north of 240 million units (~250 million could be in the cards -- an eye-popping figure)"" Ives wrote in a note to clients, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in [fiscal year 2015].""Will Apple stock hit $225?There have long been prognostications of a supercycle for the iPhone maker. It has an installed base of more than 1.4 billion active devices, with the iPhone accounting for an estimated 950 million of those. The current thinking suggests that as many as 350 million iPhone buyers could upgrade their device this year. To put that number in context, Apple sold roughly 185 million iPhones in 2019. Given the demand for a 5G-enabled iPhone, and the number of devices due for an upgrade, it's certainly possible Apple could sell 89% more iPhones in 2021 -- but that's certainly a high bar."
Appl should buy a big pot company.
At least tomorrow we won’t be red

I think APPLE SPLIT was a mistake. It has not been trading normal since then.
I bought more AAPL at $125. It's now $121. So what! It will go up if you just leave it alone.
First its Vanguard then Buffet now Gates selling off Apple. No wonder it is struggling. All this hype about 5G and selling everyone a new 5G ready phone and the start of the super cycle is all BS. Apple is bleeding..
Too much negativity! Hope Shorts get trapped at the door!

Stocks no longer move based on earnings, but based on what people feel about the stock and where it will go. How many times have we seen a stock beat earnings by 1 penny and it rallies while a stock like AAPL smashes earnings and drops like crazy. The market is today irrational and all those charts means nothing."

I own a few shares, and a $20K drop per 1000 shares is painful, I don't care how ya slice it. Now I know you only lose if you sell, and I am still way up from when I bought in 2014....yet making me regret not selling some at $140 plus. I do not see a bottom yet."

"Wake up people! Hyundai is not that cheap plastic car that first came out 20 years ago. They are great cars. You want higher quality? Hyundai has had it’s own separate luxury brand Genesis for years now....the same way Toyota has Lexus, Honda has Acura and Nissan has Infinity. My friend has a Genesis and it’s really nice....just as nice as the other Asian luxury brands I’ve listed. The Genesis G70 was named the 2019 Motor Trend Car of the Year. Google it. My point is that they already have the ability to make very nice high end quality vehicles. Genesis just came out with a new SUV the GV80....very nice. Google it. Now consider the fact that Apple just posted a $100 billion revenue in one quarter and has a market cap of 2.25 Trillion. Think of the quality of an iPhone or iPad or iMac....top notch. Now put all those things together and just marinate on it."

"What is happening now is a result of over inflated expectations of returns due to stimulus. Under the last 10 year market rate of return Apple stock is worth $49 based on a future cash flows, but if you take the last 50 years, Apple stock shows a valuation of about $150 on current cash flows based on the past 5 years net income growth rate. This stimulus is not helping, inflation is running away and it is being written down as something else.. Shareholders are trying to run away from the stock with this knowledge in hands, but will have no way to fix the lurgy as that will take Apple below book value and then be asset stripped"

But only 6% #$%$ It?s still number one in his portfolio."
What time RED?
"Last apple event was 5 months ago, and was announced 7 days before it happened. iMacs, apple tv, mac Pros..."
AAPL WILL BE UP 5-6 TOMORROW ON THE CAR NEWS
"yep, I am buying AAPL at any pullback. Every 0.40 cents I am buying. 150 gap-up tomorrow will happen. 20 years exp in wall street. Market maker knows that. tons of order to be cover after hours...buy buy"
All in short
"People don't understand why the new iPhone 12 pro is never before seen levels of utility. 12 pros have a lidar built in, allowing extremely accurate bokeh, autofocusing in a tenth the speed of Samsung, enables full ar gaming and productive apps, and more. aka apple glasses."
Shorts are out in full force! Sleep well tonight boys! I know I will!! AAPL will rock going forward!
Why are top and bottom lines flat for the last 3 years? This is neither growth nor value.
"To my fellow Apple investors the more I think about it I am convinced that the preferred green fuel of the future will be Hydrogen, it is the most abundant substance on the planet and extremely efficient. In my opinion the company with the best manufacturing green process is HYSR protected by patents. Don’t take my word, do your own due diligence and you will probably agree. Good luck. I personally believe that they have as bright a future as Apple."
I’m very sure that this will jump up 10% when you least expect it to 
150 after earning who agrees with me on this. Super positive and bullish on it.
Hoping for a steady $2-$4 a week increase in stock price over the next month.

AAPL can fix two critical past mistakes when they failed to buy TSLA or NFLX. Buy DIS
"Analysts saying last Q revenue could be $112 Billion...that would break the all time record over 2019 Dec....if that happens, see you at $200 instantly"
"rally based on margin loans, collapsing"
Just points up again how disastrous that last split was.
Expect a huge market rally in MARCH if the 1.9 T economic package is approved.
"This stock has been heading downhill since the last quarter profit announcement. What is going on.,,should be green with the all time high profit earning."
Apple now discussions with 6 Japanese automakers about building Apple Car. Maybe Toyota and Apple create separate subsidiary joint venture......basically start their own iCar company together....how great would tgst be!
FUTURES WILL BE UP 500 COME THE MORN!!
"unbelievable that AAPL could be in freefall, almost 10 days in a row, someone is exiting a huge position in this stock, when will it end , ? way oversold on RSI metrics."
Anyone buying more shares at this price?￼
"Apple also declared a cash dividend of $0.205 cents per share and said that it had spent over $30 billion on total shareholder return, which includes share buybacks, during the quarter. Apple’s first fiscal quarter is typically its largest of the year and includes critical holiday sales during December."
"Tired of people saying Tesla has a huge head start. Apple has been working on the car for years, more than they’ll let on, and would not be doing it if it itself wasn’t the one with the huge advantage."
Pre market positive up move on EV news. Should have nice gain today and continue tomorrow. 
"Shorts can thumbs down, cry, kick and scream but Apple is heading north. Close above 131 is more then possible"
130 today boys
"just speechless.....alright people, I cannot look the screen anymore....I didnt have any faith in BP but it help me make money these days....I have huge faith in aapl, but it keep bleeding....where is end, if we really touch 100....it will really blow my mind....because it will be the worst correction in aapl's history"
Next earnings they should give guidance. Hold longs!
"People will be running from Bitcoin now, it's tanking. Hello APPLE !!!"
"I can explain, after selling shares yesterdayI own 2 of the Feb 19, 130 call optionsThis is holding down the stock.I control the price of AAPL from my house with $2000 worth of calls.The price is now capped until Feb 19 at 142 - it can not and will not rise above that level"
"Apple is smart to delay their autonomous car a few years, as it will likely not be an EV design due to the growing impracticality of lithium supply. Instead Porsche invented a cheap synthetic fuel that lowers CO2 emissions 85% likely to become the new standard"
Any longs here that bought in the $130s $140s? Don’t be upset. Look at apples  chart see how it dips and recovers. It’s always going higher on the chart even with large dips. You will be happy later this year when it’s $170-$200
Do you guys know any good long term growth stocks like 30-40% return each year Apple is definitely one of them
Anyone remember when this was green?
got great volume on an increase in SP. Could be starting to run!!
"Pay a living wage and eliminate Welfare ?If you have children and refuse to work, we’ll find homes for those kids with Responsible Adults and you can go live in a Tent City but you aren’t going to be Homeless in plain view of working society!Most want to work and contribute to society but wages are less than 1/3 of a living wage ?Republicans are the Problem on Wages and low wages are perpetuating the need for Welfare ?Vote Responsibly !"
Stop thinking its Apple. The broader NASDAQ is red. So Apple is taken with the index. No stress..
"Pay attention to MSFT reporting after today's close. If they will eat up expectations (expected as I sure hope cause I own a decent amount but not as much as AAPL), then watch AAPL AH people trying to catch up. That would translate NOT only AAPL will blow earnings to smithereens, but A MAJOR LIFT OFF GO APPLE!!!"
Car manufacturers are a dying legacy with no upside. Stick to the IPhone and the crypto wallet exchange and reap billions to the top line and bottom line
shorts have to cover today or pay dividend next week
Anyone else waiting on their dividend deposit? Haven’t seen mine yet.
Right now Apple is trading at a net cash forward PE of 23....talk about being undervalued for the number one ranked brand in the world also with the worlds stickiest products....
"If you look at the AAPL chart 3 month and 6 month high-low channel, we are at the low end of the channel in an overall upward direction. AAPL is due to swing back up soon to head to the upper part of the channel. Good buy time!"
The earnings is blowing up!! EPS 1.68 vs analysts consensus of 1.41. This is HUGE!!!!
Back to 60
Desperately need a green week :/ we should really be at least $140 :/
My prediction is $175 by December 2021!
Will Apple go under if rates keep going up??
Thank you Apple.......
"Obvious bear trap, just like last year around this time. Investors with guts made a bundle"
"AAPL upgraded again to 171 by RBC yesterday. the only is up, Any smart seller will get burned"
Millennials legit think a CEO’s job is stock pumping on Twitter now. The elon effect...really classing up America.
BTW Apple serious about EV market been talking with Lidar companies all week per Bloomberg10Trillion $$ market
"After blowout ER, AAPL’s usual MO is to drift upward over the course of the qtr, just enough and under the radar to gratify patient longs, and frustrate weekly option gamblers..."
I’m thinking if Buffett and Ark also apple has to buy back sharers this can pass $150 if it goes on a run
Hopefully tomorrow is a better day! Take care ya'll
"I don’t know if any of you have money managers or not but if you do, you should think long and hard about a Panic Correction Strategy, now, without emotion because apparently, they think riding investments down like the Titanic for 6 months is somehow advisable ?Panic Corrections have a completely different set of rules in comparison to normal day to day Market Trading !Once you know that your in a Panic Correction, you likely will already be down 25 or 30% and maybe 2 or 3 months have gone by but Panic Corrections usually last around 6 months, so even if you just exit the Market and wait for the turn around day, at least you stopped the bleeding ?Personally I would completely exit my long positions for a loss and then buy SDOW and try to make up my losses for the remainder of the 6 month correction and then on the turn around day, sell SDOW and buy your Long Positions back at Fire Sale Prices !Your Money Manager likely will say that nobody can Time the Market but when it comes to Panic Corrections, you absolutely can time the Market and they know it too !The Market goes down every day for 6 months until stocks become so cheap that big money floods the Market with buying !The turn around day is like a flag suddenly going up !It’s very obvious!It’s very suspect to me that they don’t have you making money from a Panic Correction, given that they trade Professionally ?Keep in mind that they will follow your instructions, should you decide to go against their suggestions!You should look forward to Panic Corrections !It’s the easiest money you’ll ever make in your Life, if you just put a little thought into it ?Never forget that Man is trying to deceive Man and the Banks & Investment Industry is Wild Wild West crooked !Lol"

"I've been reading the board w/o commenting,But I want to echo what was posted last WEekend.WE posted that the traders had the filed for a month while the investors waited for their turn which WE said was this week until after earnings.Today I read many discussing options. Since Tuesday's open the weekly calls are up as much as 1000%. The $130 calls were .65 on Tuesday morning..today they are over approx. $7. Some returns were so much higher.Then the sale of puts was a slam dunk.Tomorrow for our UNITY to stand fast there will be no pullback."
"Berkshire Hathaway cuts 6% of holdings of AAPL. This was announced today, so obviously insiders yesterday and prior to announced trades today sold. Also how AAPL will perform tomorrow is anyone’s guess. I for one will wait it out at least till tomorrow trading."
Get real folks! Apple is doing no worse than other tech stocks. Nasdaq down big. Big money rotating in and out of tech. In a day or so it will rotate back in and Apple will have great UP day. Doesn't take a genius to see this!
Oh my God zoom beat by a wide wide margin. It is up 7.2% in pre market
"As COVID vaccines roll out and the economy gets revved back up, AAPL will struggle to be Comp quarters from 2020. This is what I see is driving the stock price down.Not interested in  or  Just looking to see if any open minded people can answer a simple question.Where will Aapl bottom out? aim VERY a interested in buying, any chartists out there that see anything telling.This is still one of, if not THE best company in the world. Good luck to all longs! Thanks!"

I was a new shareholder after split. I started my position at $106.00. I WILL TAKE MORE LOL
Dividends this week! More shares to my list
"Compare Apple’s year over year growth (not stock price) to Microsoft or Amazon, it looks like Apple has reached it’s top. That is why there was talk about the Apple car after earnings because their current business model yet great is maxed out."
I’ve been in AAPL for many years and have held and added. It is a gold mine that keeps giving.
"Remember, they acquitted the criminal in chief on the weekend, the world loses confidence in America once again."
Days like yesterday this give Apple a chance to buy it's own stock back with their massive free cash flow. dips in the price are great for long term holders.
let's see rather good news by Powell and somewhat optimistic approach from tim apple let's see if it closes green today
"if you think apple will reach 150s in the fall this year, you could buy now before it jumps to 130s very soon"

Bear trap. Time to buy some more AAPL I believe!
Drop the mic! Boom Kia apple

Wait... hold for 10 years and then see...
I sold all my apple stocks and I bought Nokia aswell.
Well the stimulus passing the other night plus what buffet had to say about Apple plus the jj approval should give the market a good boost tomorrow. The ig Dow futures are 108.8

"Bitcoin payment card, ""BITPAY"" now supports Apple pay for in apple retail purchases since December 2020."
I sold 260 shares of apple at high today!Did not lose money but did not make alot...onlyabove $1k but I am comfortable. Apple has zero innovation and fat cash cow company that does nothing to innovate. I will put this money into $AMZN f or BETTER GROWTH year to year.Good luck everyone Ciao!
AAPL should be leading the way out of this Nasdaq decline not participating in it!
"There is no better long term investment plan than buy as much AAPL as you can, as soon as you can, and hold. This goes up over time. In no time, people will be saying, man, I wish I had bought Apple at $140. It's a no brainer!"
"Latest report from Nikkei is that Apple is in discussions with at least six other automakers, which might include Nissan, Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota..."
"at 1550 hrs on Friday AAPL was $124.48In ten minutes, the algorithim players took it down $3+ to set up next week's trade or just to ""double their fun"" with the expiring Feb 26 options?WE posted $125+ close but did warn this may happen at 1228 hrs on Friday.Why? Because it has happened before."
"Besides today is the last day of the month that people's cashing out, these shorts are trying to recuperate some of their losses of the billions lost to GME and AMC. You sell, you loose. There's no reason AAPL should be in the red today and yesterday."
Apple has blowout quarter and barely budged and Google earnings gets a thumbs up and an Amen & is up 7% pm.
Looks like KIA wants AAPL for their EV solution. This make 2 big car markers now. AAPL is way under value since it is now an EV play as well. New target for for AAPL is $220
We are waiting for that green candle to 140...
$200 by the end of the month!
Amazing the amount of novices that sold on the March trend line head fake yesterday.
"Get out while you can, you will thank yourself you could get out @ $120+ while you can when this Tech Bubble 2.0 bursts AAPL all the way to $50-$60 which is very usual for a typical bubble bust phrase."

I have faith in Apple let’s go green!

Apple wins again!The North Dakota state senate voted 36-11 on Tuesday not to pass a bill that would have required app stores to enable software developers to use their own payment processing software and avoid fees charged by Apple and Google.
"Up nearly 500% in 5 years, 72% in the last 12 months, 17% in the past 3 months, 5% in the last 30 days... Seems like a healthy stock to me."
Stop the political posts!
I honestly think the correction is over. Exactly the same thing happened last year around this time. Listen to Jereme Siegel distinguished professor and a PhD in economics from MIT who said in 2020 “we reached bottom in March 2020” and he was right as he always is. Now he has said 2021 will be a great year for the stock market
"It is my understanding that the peeps who jumped all over these recent high flyers--AMC-Gamestop-,,, may have had MARGIN accounts -containing AAPL-AMD ,,, and over leveraged themselves--got called on it--and now have to sell their shares in these companies --to answer the margin call!!! GREED--NO GOOD!! Just my 2 cents?? Apple--long and strong!!"
Good earning expected ... like MSFT .. i bet

"Apple is a cash machine for me at least. Own Apple since 2016And yes I did sell some. Got my capital back and then some, I mean some! Still own a few hundred shares at $0 cost!"
If fed can manipulate all bonds and inject 100 trillion then this is going to new highs

APPLE TO $170 . BUY BUY BUY
"Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding is Apple Inc with shares held of 887,135,554."
Should have sold at 140.
Cook also needs to raise the divi In April during the next earnings call to something other than .21 or .22 cents. Maybe share in those profits with a special divi to its shareholders. The stock has done virtually nothing now since the split around 125. 6 months of trading sideways since the ath of 145 which he caused the current downtrend with his color for the next quarter and no guidance. Oh services and wearables were not going to be good. Boom down 20 bucks in two weeks. Tell me that’s shareholder friendly.
Thinking of making my next desktop computer an Apple branded one. Anyone have one and make recommendations either for or against?My main usage would be to create gaming projects using the Unreal Engine.

"I have a question for anyone. I have 5 contract expiring tomorrow deep in the red and Etrade isn't filling my request to roll them. I've already emailed Etrade about it and I'm still waiting for a reply. I don't want to sell at such a steep loss. Any thoughts on this? I just started trading options and did very well with Apple, Ford and blackberty a last week. I got excited expecting a good return based on Apple's earnings expectations. Did not expect a company with such amazing earnings to drop. Lesson learned"

If this shows no gain by Friday I'm selling and buying Lemonade instead. This is way oversold and manipulated to make a steady profit.
is apple going up today after today's financial results of Q1 2021?
This is why you need to capitalize on 300 point Dow gains...because tomorrow it looks like a 300 point loss. I expect under $135 tomorrow. So annoyed about earnings action and the reason I can’t stand earnings days. Tech always gets trounced.

I have wanted to get in here for the longest time and I decided to recoup my initial investments in my portfolio and for once I timed it okay. My first purchase was Apple and I was embarrassed to not have owned it. I’m smiling now

"Buy Apple, Hold Apple, Profit from Apple To all opponents of an apple short squeeze. There is an average short interest of just under 100million shares. Hedge funds hold the bulk of those positions!

AAPL should be $150 per share.

The only action on apple is for the short traders. Every month or so the longs get one day. Time to change
Options Friday strikes again (last 15 minutes)
"Volkswagen CEO says he's not afraid of possible AppleCar EV. He laughs and says putting wheels on a Mac Pro doesn't turn Apple into an EV automaker. Of course, that's a fact. Most of the traditional automakers are secretly laughing at Apple for thinking they can actually build a car anyone would want to buy. Apple isn't going to get any respect. I think big investors aren't happy how Apple is wasting resources on an EV that will take Apple years to develop when it could be doing things that will turn a profit much sooner. I only know that it will take many years to develop an unknown EV product, especially if Apple is as picky as usual when deciding on a working partner. I'm not concerned about Apple's EV project because it's such a long way off and could easily become a HomePod on wheels that's too expensive and not do enough in terms of autonomy. By the time Apple sells an EV, every automaker will have many models for sale and Tesla will be the dominant EV automaker by a huge margin. I simply hope Apple knows what it's doing."

"02/08/21 Apple assumed with an Outperform at RBC Capital RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves assumes coverage of Apple with an Outperform rating with a price target of $171, up from $154, which the analyst states is a ""Street High"".

"Don’t worry about the short term drops. The market is gaining huge exposure in the younger community due to GME, NOK, and AMC. These people won’t simply stop investing once the volatility is gone. Their money will be spread across the market, especially well known names such as Apple. Hold and enjoy the ride."
This is the Apple i know. 145 very soon.
Apple will be close to green at the opening bell
Just start buying a little with each 5.00 drop. 125 then 120 then 115 is the bottom
Please stay under 129 till next week!!!! I have 50 covered calls riding on this!
The problem continues to be not making hay on solidly green markets. Throw in a red market day and this will be down $3 plus. It’s gotta stop.
"With 16.77 billion outstanding shares, this thing gains $16.77 billion in market capitalization for each dollar up. So forget about getting $10 or $20 jumps in a day. Mountains can be moved. It just takes longer"
It’s days like this that I envy the gas station clerk who doesn’t even know what a stock is.
"Bought 500 shares today, this will definitely go right back above $140 next week with revenge rally."
Going under $100
"Bought the dip at 137.75, AH ....you kidding me? Big beat, best necessary company in the world! Too easy..."
"Longs, you can sell well above $100 today.Sell every single shares of your AAPL holding today and be grateful that you could sell above $100 a share."
"For all of you panic sellers out there, take a look at the charts. This drop today has nothing to do with AAPL fundamentals and is simply algorithmic trading in response to bond yields. Stop creating such a panic and learn a little about investing."

Tested 121 low from last week and bounced around 121.43
Dan Ives /Wedbush just raised Apple bullish price target to $225!! He is one of the most accurate analysts out there next to Gene Munster.
will this whole week be a tech sell off? apple is still overvalued
Here i was thinking Texas is one of the strongest states in the US for there energy independency turns out there the weakest.This is what happens when greed is unchecked.Not only did texans lost power on a fair winter week but they also get a bill for 9k$ electricity on energy that they got use for a hour to warm up before it was shut off again.All of sudden Texas became the riskiest state to live in.
$FSR Fisker confirmed that $AAPL is going with Hyundai-Kia
"Historical records show the next day after AAPL dips to $33+ the next day's intra day high is $4 to $6+ nigher.Today, WE are not greedy. $136+ would be fine. But the algorithim players have a mind of their own"
"In a few months when apple will reach again 2T market cap, this will be the bigest news."
Buffet dumped AAPL and million folks just follow him....Buffer is now Pumping CVX + travel/leisure stocks like RCL CCL NCLH UAL ALK DAL LUV SAVE AAL BA LVS MGM + FCEL BLDP PLUG.....
Where is Apples News about shareholder meeting? No statement about Div increase or share buyback?
Have a nice day.UNITE and PROFIT.
I was actually mistaken about AAPL’s cash. When you include short term investments their cash is $91 billion. Free cash flow is $73 billion. Again I ask what case do AAPL bears have here?
It will cost trillions in the grid to support mass EV and take decades. Meanwhile Emerging markets like India will be consuming oil at a rapidly increasing rate. I predict the US will have rolling blackouts with EV and oil will go to the moon. Copper and lithium will be scarce. Food shortages. Hence commodity super cycle until trillions invested to upgrade global grid. Sshhhh
"I’m tempted to put more money into this right now but I think I should wait a few weeks and see. Either way it’s PE is 35. Which is historically high. But, compared to current values it’s actually under valued."
Really
$118 tomorrow
Option market is not buying this head feint.Will be higher today- closes in the green
Should I buy Apple pre earnings or wait till after they report? Will Apple be able to meet the high expectations of investors?
"I will take it easy and not go for broke. Tomorrow, I’m going to add to my MSFT.If things look OK, I’ll buy SHOP on Weds if it things look better and it’s still cheap.Thursday AAPL.If they rebound quickly then, I’ll just be happy for that and not use my free cash."
Good Friday usually almost always means a great week ahead specially when Apple was down midday and suddenly took off and ended higher on Friday.
Futures are uppy up folks. Looks like the short folks and the day traders are also covering. Thanko
Absolutely horrid 2 weeks since earnings for this stock. Better find a way to some green. This looks to continue next week. Lot of weakness. Perplexing.
WILL CLOSE POSITIVE. THX FOR THE 1.4 mil supporters
I've had 5000 of this since 2014 and I've held on through ups and downs for the dividend and the upside. The past month has hit me pretty solid and the thought of cashing in on a couple of thousand shares has crossed my mind and I came close to jumping ship yesterday and this morning and didn't. Don't like trading I much prefer investing.
Dow turned positive. Lots of Nasdaq stocks turned positive too. Apple is not too far away. We will end positive today.
"I know it's tough to trust people, but ANY mining company right now is not a bad investment. I am not telling you what to buy, but start looking into metal miners, primarily Lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickelThese are what makes EV's go vroom vroomAlso if you wanna know a good oil buy in $CDEV on dips, they have ER on 23rd, they have 4% fed owned property, so good luck banning fracking Energy/Metals folks... it's the next $AAPL"
"OMG, it’s green!!!!!!"
"This is not cool anymore. New generation wants video games, weed smoking, star wars travel cars, speculation not tethered in boring reality and not interested in earnings none sense"
It’s just panic sale. If you’re long - don’t worry. We’ll be fine next month (hopefully)
"When the iPhone 11, in 2019, AAPL was trading at $217.73. Two months later, the stock was selling for a 21% more. A year after the 1st iPad was released, price was up over 42%.When AAPL runs, it runs fast and hard."
"IMO, the GME, AMC, hedge fund shorting squeeze isn't over. Hedge funds need to raise liquidity to disentangle themselves from the hole they're in. This is IMO the trigger for the tech selloff, the rest is people scared of holding the bag as technology goes through a healthy price rebalancing. I could be totally wrong but this is the way I see it."
Definitely $148 to $150 next week

"Apple is falling like a rock in a lake with no bottom. I have no other option than wait for this stock to go up because I bought in higher. I want to be optimistic, but last couple of days have made it hard to look on the bright side."
Why reason why AAPL keeps on dropping? Even today when all indexes are up
"Funny, Buffet sold SOME shares of AAPL at a profit in the last quarter of 2020, news comes out on 16th feb , 2021, and people panic sell!!! He is buying them back now most probably and will tell us that news in the next quarter!!!"
You invested in the stock market stop bithcing! If you long it always comes back! Relax and hold. Said this a million times. Sell if you can’t handle it
"Why is this down ., while the whole stock market is up ? I swear my luck and my options trading whatever I do goes south"
FORD CEO on CNBC saying they are working with AAPL
"So Apple & Hyundai/Kia ehhhh,......... I would prefer Apple partner with ANY American car manufacturer instead"
"It's nice to know that Warren Buffett is an Apple cheerleader but I don't think that's going to be a catalyst for Apple stock. Buffett doesn't have the pull that he used to have because he's made a few mistakes on some big purchases. Cathie Wood has easily topped Buffett in stock picks and runs her fund to make big money in a hurry. She dumps non-performing companies in a heartbeat. Companies need younger cheerleaders who are willing to tweet every day to pull in greedy investors looking to make a quick buck. Gene Munster doesn't have what it takes as he's more like a broken record when he talks about Apple and almost no one listens. Top fund managers and CEOs use social media to pump their stocks day in and day out. All Tim Cook talks about is privacy and big investors find that topic as boring as heck. Privacy doesn't make money for Apple but causes a ton of trouble in the news media.Oh well, it's a new month and Apple has some new products on the way that should be in high demand. Apple will likely have another decent quarter coming up. Fingers crossed."
As of now it is exactly $500 pre-split
"Post on Reddit , thay are going to group together to drop AAPL."

Great comeback today
The market went unnaturally high for 3 days. Apple’s growth last week was more realistic. Monday be ready for a huge drop. Except AAPL

I am going to wait on what it looks like mid day today. Any price can be set during pre-market.
Interest rates going up.AAPL's stock buyback program will be hit hard: the cost of borrowing money to buy its own stock will rise dramatically. Servicing the existing debt will become unmanageable.Bankruptcy becomes a distinct possibility.
buy it is going to be good
"APPL closed Fri @ 139.07 + 2.20 on significant volume of 114.46 million shares and then moved up after hours another 1.29 to 140.46.

"Apple may be more interested in mobility services, including a robo-taxi division, as it has shifted its focus in recent years to paid services to boost revenue amid a saturated smartphone market. Apple is already an investor in Chinese ridesharing giant Didi. And in 2019, Apple acquired Drive.ai, a self-driving startup that had worked with Lyft on a robotaxi pilot project.Apple has poached employees from companies like Porsche, Google's Waymo and Tesla, including the executive who once oversaw development of its Model 3 car."

Can't believe this stock ever goes down. Best company in the world.. If $TSLA is worth its price then this should be $1000/share. Investors today are crazy.
EXPECT AAPL UP 6 ON MONDAY REGARDLESS OF THE MARKET. THX
Should be up $10
I don’t think you can short apple at 121 and get away with it. However shorting at 140 is a different story. If you didn’t when it was at 140$ why do it now?
Wow! Dow +580 Nas +250 and Apple can't climb even $1 ?????

Bloomberg reporting Apple investing in Kia
to have the best you got buy the best .aapl all the way. buy now don't listen to the pundits.
"People would be shocked to realize from 2012 to 2016 Apple was basically dead money, far underperforming the market. I'm not saying that is going to happen again, but come on, at 2.3 trillion how fast can it possibly grow from here? Who is jumping in at these prices to drive the price higher? Be realistic. Projections are calling for 4-5% growth in 2022...4/5%....no one is paying a premium for that. I'm in it for the long term, but there are far more explosive growth stocks out there if you are looking for immediate returns."
Apple just sold $14 B of bonds according to Bloomberg. My guess is that they took some of this money and bought back stocks cheap esp. on Friday.
Reuter’s report “U.S. based stock funds attract $7.8 billions investments last week. Confidence in investing is growing and over 90% of the companies met or beat expectations (based upon three years average) and not based upon any kind of lowered expectations
MOMENTUM is BULLISHYesterday should had not been a surprise.Most times when the algorithim players take it down on Friday's close there is no am dip but a $6 to $8 rally.After hours and pre-market look positive.Have a nice day
What if we go 10% up on TUESDAY !!!
Apple is a stock to hold.. not gamble!
Apple is going to buyback stock with the bonds they sold at 1.85%. It doesn't take much effort to get a return on investment at that price. Further they believe stock price will approach 180-200 level by year end with the company going forward with electric vehicle in 2024.
Sell team coming in
I'm selling when Warren Buffet sells.
Anyone think Appl can past 130 by this Friday ( realistically or not)?
"Last night and earlier today, WE did comment about how this happen years past and could happen today Then the earnings report was great too but markets took stock down to kill option premium.

Apple had way better earnings than Google and Amazon. Sometimes things just don't make sense.
"oh ye of little faith! aapl is a long term play... not a short term day-trading stock. the 1-, 3-, 6-month charts are all screaming buy. but if you don't have a long enough time horizon to let this grow you shouldn't be buying it in the first place."
Buffett is adding billions into Apple dont sell people hold on to this one
It’s time to stop watching the markets and develop other interests. Spring is around the corner!
Here is the real question will APPL hit $100 before it hits $150? or $150 before it hits $100. 5G says $150 to me.

Thanks to those who got scared and sold! You ultimately made this stock go higher.The lesson? You HOLD Apple....... ALWAYS!!!
$appl needs to be waited until July. (I) Apple camp up so fast last year (2) people are betting on risky assets not on the safe asset like apple.
I took my dividend and bought 75 more shares yesterday.....You short term gamblers don't understand this company.
the more negative comments i see here the more i buy this stockwhen will they learn humans evolve
"I've held apple since 2013, I don't know what's wrong with this stock rn, expected it to drop usually start of the year but there wasn't even a run after record earning. sigh."
Buffet took profits
My price target on this green apple today is 128+!
"I don’t care if you’re long term or wanting to make a quick buck. But with upgrades and price targets going up, it’s hard to believe this thing can’t go up 1-4% every once in a while. This is one of the big boys. I’m not expecting that everyday or every week. But once every 2 or 3 weeks a 2% or 3% close would be nice. Nada was up 3.30% today. Intc was up 3.06%. Bidu up 1.82%, avgo 1.77%. When’s the last time aapl’s been up 2% to close the day? And this wasn’t even a great day for the markets."

"Apple is not Big Tech like everyone makes it believe there are not like a FB, Twitter, they actually has physical technology like computers, phones, watches that provide a monthly subscriber as if it was a gym on your watch. Also, they are getting into the car business soon. Apple is trying to be a house hold brand and within business, school they are changing their computer system more and more to Apple product. My niece goes to a private school and the school is requesting the students to bring their own iPad to school."
1$ moreLet's do it
"i have hard time understanding of why AAPL. stock price is crashing , while at the same time too many financial expert are upgrading the price target to 150 to 170"
This company is a great iphone maker.
The $3.45 gain Thursday would have been a $13.80 gain pre-split. Keep that I’m mind when you think it “only” went up $3.45
Let’s be honest. It was a good day. It could have been worse but it’s holding on strong :) hopefully next week will be better. Happy weekend!
To the moon lol
I am thinking the sell off was precipitated by short sellers liquidating their positions from profitable companies to be able to cover their margin expenses. This should start heading towards a 3 trillion+ market cap by next week.
I bought apple 20 years ago.....I am a believer and expect the stock to see 200 again in 2021

"When Apple decides on a suitor for it's ICAR, the stock will start moving up."
Go read the warren buffet letter to shareholders he posted this morning. He explains his Apple position the sale of a small portion of the stock and that his stakeHas actually increased in size even with the small sale. They still own 907 million shares or a 5.4% of Apple. This is good news and with the stimulus it should continue the move upward

We are buying at the opening tomorrow. Also we will set buy stop orders order every 20 cents in the way up, Also, if pullback , we are buying every 50 cents pullback. In the end AAPL will break 145, then 150 then 200 in Q1. Hedgies games will end . Trust in EPS/revenues in Q3, Q4. That's truth. TRUTH will prevail ad lead. Tic Toc. Bulls continues"
"Came from Amazon which was doing nothing. In with 16,000 shares of Apple at 128.87 yesterday. I think it looks good for me and was a great price to get in. Will wait until it gets to 140 and then cash out with a good gain. I think it will get there soon. What do you guys think?"
I get people are depressed by the open but you should all bear in mind the ex dividend day is today and you should take a hard look at the options market ! It explains the dip ! This dip is an opportunity people ! Don’t let the big boys be the only takers !
Heading up slow and steady get on the train folks
"this is the first time ever in history, that the highflying technology stocks are in a bear market, without the major averages, not being close to a correction yet. I am very concerned."
Thank you Buffett he just gave this stock a huge boost $130 plus here we come 
Apple reported great numbers. Not sure why Apple in the after-hours market is down slightly.I guess people would rather pay $900 for Tesla and $389 for GME.Things will be fine and Apple will move up tomorrow.
"I’m in $TMO, $SDC, $CNK, $AAPL, $CCL, $RCL, and $DAL... it’s all about the opening up... no reason any of these can’t reach 100 week highs and AAPL and TMO just keep on cranking HIGHER in the meantime!!!"

"If and when Apple does eventually make a car, they should call it the ""Pi"" as in 3.141592...... and make it in America. Then they could market it as being as American as ""Apple Pi"" and begin selling them at an introductory price of $31,415.92."
"So if you want to use the last 10 years market return as your guide to setting MRP rates then you will find Apple stock at about $49 using current cash flows with 5.8% growth, but if you use the last 50 years as the MRP setting for your ke then you will find Apple value at $149 per share. The last 10 years is more indicative due to the stimulus money printing going on in the last days. Or you can ask Tim to giver you an estimate of the office chairs an HQ at Infinite loop. I used to drink at a little cocktail bar in the parking lot some years ago when I was building Hiway 85. love Apple, over priced, great to trade"
"People really need to relax, 1% in an hour means nothing"
we been in downtrend for a month already....has there been such long down period in its history? JPM just set 150 target again today...but it's moving in the wrong direction now....bleeding everyday....
Hope this doesn't go too deep today. Had enough all month
Any opinion on the feud between Apple and Facebook
"This is how the conversation went in the firm. ""Tank it, it is over 124. It will be back next week anyway. And the sec...yah what about them. They never anything anyway."" 2500 shares for five year. Let's go."
As the skittish sell I will buy. No questions asked.
if this ends green i will donate 10$ to my local homeless person
"THINK, I made money big time today by selling Aapl and bought ABNB before the ER when it was down at $183 and today I sold at $209!!!! Cashed out $10,400 in one day!"
"So cheap, buy more shares, the federal reserve will pump S&P 500 again"
The recent price action on a widely held stock like AAPL indicates a major market crash is nearing. Get into cash like everybody else is.
Great job today!Algorithim plays paid off 100 to 300%.MOre to come next week.Close was a set-up for Monday
what do you guys think about a possible lucid collab on the apple car?
I am going on record here. NO WAY NO HOW IS APPLE DOWN TOMORROW. Tomorrow AAPL will not disappoint. 
"If the market is 6 months forward-looking, this says that Wall Street is already conceding that the Jobama administration is killing the economy for at least the first half of 2021. Who voted for this big government nightmare? If there is a bright spot, it's that a sailor will choose any port in a storm and that makes AAPL one of the best places to stash your cash while you wait to see what other shoe will drop in DC."
"@TD101, it’s because of the 10yr rate to 1.49%. And that’s obviously no risk. But Apple is no risk as well. Stop mongering fear"
I think something BIGLY will happen very soon.
"If you forget the pre-split euphoria, then the stock has been steady. Sep/Oct 100sOct/Nov 110sNov/Dec 120sJan/Feb 130sThis includes two significant blips (in October and last week). I don't think any long term holders would be disconcerted. Solid fundamentals and P/E expected to come down in future."
Looks like it’s positioned to be a very green day across all areas
"When a stock goes from $108 to $142 in 2 months, u can’t be surprised when it sells off a little. That was a huge run up. Don’t worry"
Odd how the Hunter investigation disappeared.
"91% buying interest pre market. The EV deal with Kia. Amazing financial results reported. Properly diversified technologically. Very Healthy looking technicals. Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple  Because the future is bright "
According to JP Morgan Manufacturing PMI which came out on Monday was a whopping 60. Last time it was 50. This indicates manufacturing is picking up by leaps and bounds
IF NASDAQ recovers tomorrow +200 then APPLE will see 150s! it depends on overall market.
"Bought in 2012 for $130,000. Today is worth over $800,000. Need I say more?"
Nasdaq has gone up too high. Will trade sideways for a bit before it runs to $140. Just taking a break. Be patient
Apple has good consumer electronics business. The news of not hooking up with Hyundai is good news as car making is really a low profit margin business. I think it’s a blessing in disguise that the talk with Hyundai has stopped.
"apple will be much higher next week. RSI is 29, the same number it was at the bottom of last year's market crash. this was the final fireworks on the downside."
"I heard Toni Sacconaghi on CNBC today. If you don't him, he's purportedly the #1 Apple analyst. I have followed him through the years and he's never been right, always bashing the company, always wrong. I could never understand that. Today it was different. He made a very strong case for the car, etc. Make the effort to bring up the video. It's good."
as noted..... 130+ today....135-140 by end of the week....time to buy is now
Apple retiring shares every day.....and the beat goes on...
wake me up when it finally passes 150.
Man i was so close to selling today. I know theres gonna be some other days like today. Ima need a beer and a smoke.
"I used to watch Apple and be concerned if it dipped... now after having some experience with it, I have decided that I really don’t care what it does on any given day because it’s an incredible stock. I can step away on a vacation and not worry about it because it’s such a good long term play. Own it! Don’t trade it!"
Hope for the best here. I'm hoping this goes way up today. IT's the best stock in the game.
Market up big and Apple is down? Has WS lost faith in Timmy?
"Crash is coming runn!!!To the poeple who say this ur super market made money in covid, what about the biggest company in world ?Put ur money in apple and sleep on a cold pillow. Enjoy the ride"
Get ready to fly! Apple will lead the market today $$$$$
When those machines kick in this will go right back up.
Unbelievable everyday red
"A huge correction or crash is definitely coming, as sure as the sun rises in the morning and long overdue...there's only been 38 of them since 1950 where the market has lost between 20 and 80% of its value. So when you lose all that apple money you won't be rich...you'll just be old..."
"This is Apple people. It’s the worlds biggest company so it’s always going to be a slow grower. It’s the worlds best company so the fundamentals will always solidify the foundation. Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple Be patient and don’t let Emotion take over!"
"Apple's market share is going to explode in the next decade and new products will only feed the growth. Remember, post 2020 a trillion ain't what it used to be!Never, ever argue with success."
if msft earnings are any indication aapl should blow away earnings. This stock after hours and throughout the day tomorrow is going to explode.
If you are in the red people just wait ! This is Apple ! You will be alright in the end if you are patient ! It’s not a loss if you don’t sell !
"After spending an entire week going back and reviewing about 25 years of Apple's financial statements from the 1990s through 2020, all I can say is WOW. Never ever bet against it underestimate Apple. Apple is the home of iPod, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Airpods...and the soon to be announced Apple Glasses and Car.... all those under one roof... And so many other products that have become significant in American culture. Without a doubt, own it don't trade it."
Any news on AAPL doing any share buybacks? Just asking for a friend.
"Warren Buffett Says Berkshire's Apple Investment Shows The 'Power Of Repurchases' 03/01/21 11:11 AM March 1, 2021 02:28 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long IdeasBerkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett over the weekend wrote his annual letter to shareholders and highlighted the “power of repurchases” using Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an example.What Happened: Buffett said that Berkshire began buying shares of the iPhone maker in late 2016 and by early June 2018 owned more than one billion shares (adjusted for splits). “Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple,” wrote the veteran investor.The cost for acquiring that stake was $36 billion and since then Berkshire has enjoyed regular dividends averaging about $775 million annually and has pocketed an extra $11 billion in 2020 by selling a small part of its holdings. The continuous repurchase of shares by Apple and the consequent shrinking number of shares outstanding has meant that Berkshire now owns 5.4% of the Tim Cook-led company. “That increase was costless to us,” wrote Buffett.Why It Matters: Berkshire’s third-quarter operating profits declined 32% to $5.48 billion from $8.07 billion a year ago. The company repurchased $9.3 billion worth of stock in the period. Since Berkshire also repurchased its own shares during the past two and a half years, its shareholders now own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than they did in July 2018, wrote Buffett.“This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,” revealed the Oracle of Omaha.Buffett also pointed to Apple’s publicly stated intention to repurchase shares and thus Berkshire shareholders would find “their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.”"
"Tim Cook is taking his sweet time on the Apple car, it likely won't be released until 2023 or 2024. Tesla will be making over 1 million cars a year by then, Gigafactories up and running. Hyundai, Huawei, Nio, Toyota, Honda and Ford will all be in full swing manufacturing EVs. Slow and cautious will definitely lock Apple out of EV gains, bad decision by Tim Cook to move slow in the EV market."
"Losses don't stop here, progressive taxationthe world has never seen is upon us..."
APPLE IS at BARGAIN PRICE. IT WONT LAST TOO LONG!!!
"Apple’s Q2 even bigger than the quarter they just reported? Yes. 1. Q1 only had 2 months of 12 phone sales. 2. Chinese New Year. 3. 90% of all Holiday Gift Cards sold in Q1 will be redeemed in Q2. Gift cards are not counted as sales until they are redeemed. You heard it from me, Tony Balooga first. Q2 will be Apple’s biggest quarter ever."
A lot of 'yall getting sold down the river. We close Green or close to it.hoodwink (ˈhʊdˌwɪŋk)vb (tr)1. to dupe; trick2. obsolete to cover or hide
Don’t worry after 23rd apple will spike to the moon 
Think maybe if the nasdaq goes up a thousand points aapl could go up a dime?
"Last quarter we had record earnings. No guidance given mainly due to COVID, however, COVID is getting put under control all over the world. Much better days are coming."
How to figure aapl stock price using Goldman Sachs’ Rod Hall’s target...use a 2x factor ...his latest target is $85...so in reality the year end target should be 2 x $85.=$170/share. I see aapl floating around $140-150 before earnings announcement...with some drop off after announcement..before further build up. A more likely case is the higher $200/sh bull case that some analysts have been pushing.
"Nasdaq futures were 80 implied open at 8:00 pm. Now they are 44. I hope by morning they are green, and we are in for a huge up day."
"People always look back and go “man I wish I bought Tesla at $200” and don’t notice Apple sitting here with a 10X potential over the next 2 years given it’s exposure into health and fitness, entertainment, cars, music in addition to its core business, which hasn’t even reached its full potential in India and China the 2 most populated countries. WAKE UP"
I just don’t believe that people will be able to buy an autonomous EV Apple Car in 3yrs. Maybe it will be for commercial use in the beginning. I don’t know. 2024 seems too early 
"We can't put food on the table, but when that $1400 comes we're buying the latest I phones!!"
AAPL and MSFT all I need take me to the promise land...APRIL! Take for the cheap prices....Terrific
"Let's review the Action since Jan 19 when the intra day low was $126+.Yesterday it ran to $145+ that was a 15% move from Jan 19th. Then it dipped down to $136.But it pivoted and rocketed for a perfect ""V"".Today, it behaved similar. It ran to higher then dipped. It should close in the greenLast week, there were no dips. Yesterday I do not post and there was a $$8.50 dip from intra day high"
2021 PE is now around 20 based on $6 earning....is it still like a 50/100 PE growth stock? It’s a no brainer. I believe it’s consolidating now. I am expecting a big tech rally any day..like 500 points up NASDAQ ....any day
Wow this stock has lost -$25/share since a month ago
"this should pop over 131 this week according to the candles, maybe even tomorrow.. buy now"
"Apple has made me rich. AND I was able to retire very early. I'm certainly not complaining.Now you day traders, on the other hand, that think every stock you pick should automatically head north, well, you're getting an education now, aren't you?"
Heading on up. There's still time to buy more lads.
"if an apple is going to have another lull,why not sell and buy back when it starts growing up. Does that make sense it does to me."
"Too Overvalued of a Bubble to begin with $130= Pre-Split $520, was trading around @ $150-$200 in 2019 with 10x better economy than today."
Apple is due for a break out to the 150 level. Then 160 shortly after.
Literally at support level.
"Hedge funds covering their short position in GME, AMC, BB, BBY, Nok.They have to resort to selling stocks like Apple. The market to say the least is broken for now. I hope this will not be new normal."
Someone with cash and confidence could have made some money today!I only had one of the two.
Assuming people are taking quick profits. Will see a green close.
"All large UK companies will have to pay 30% more tax to pay for covid , but not till 2023 , not sure what's in store for Apple"
Holding and watching my portfolio climb and climb.
Never expected this to go GREEN today on how it started out but I'll take it !
Green in a red pre market what does that tell you? Anyone that shorted Apple  is getting worried.
"Revenue beat by 8 billion, who else can do that?"
Anyone here who bought 6 months ago at $125? Sorry for you guys.
Thanks  Apple for 4 free shares. Every share adds up.
"Cmon apple, lets retest the days LOWS again!!"
"Happy investing very good perspective but here is the reality no matter how or who try’s to manipulate this stock, It will fly to $200 plus sooner than later this year guaranteed"
"Alert, AAPL WILL BE UP 6 DOLLARS ON Monday on news of electric car deal"
up 142k today ... bless all the longs!!
"No need to panic, let the shorts leave and we will pick up the money end of today/tomorrow"
"stimulus package approved, vacationing the world $150. shortly"
RBC Capital just raised AAPL target to 171 from 154
Who's accountable for the stocks performance?
The US Market is INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!A HEAVY CORRECTION is imminent!The FED is PRINTING $5 Trillion Per Week to PREVENT the Market Correction!$AAPL $JPM $TSLA
hope it holds or goes up in the next 50 minutes. That would be real nice.
Wow. Feels good to see a green 
just want to give aapl a thumb up before calling it a day! really a great firm on the right track! listening to their earning is much better experience than FB....
Market always repeats itself. We will retest the low and then the high but will take a little time. Don’t be surprised by a 7 dollar up day soon
All the shorts who were hoping for an AAPL crash last week should know that this company will have revenue and new products forever.
$200+ by the EOY
10 year yield probably needs to fill the gap at 1.19. RSI challenging 2017
"I think we see 118.00 again, don’t you?"
Possible rise to tomorrow both sides of congress gonna pass the stim checks ( for whatever that’s worth ) GL all
Not unusual. These are the people who are new to the market or can’t afford to lose anything. They over react to the herd. Patience. Let the storm pass. It always does. Look at the 20 year history for comfort.
This happens all the time. Apple goes down after earnings and then whipsaws back up to record highs. The company is firing on all cylinders. Long term investors have never. ever. been disappointed by Apple. Take a gander at the chart back through time. Apple has never been better poised for profitability than it is right now.
If anything Apple will go up with the news!
Why are shorts here everyone knows you don’t trade Apple Its long term
How many market up days and were stuck here. Apple should lead the market
"As I know during the pandemic, the Apple store was the only store has lot of customers lining up to get in every time when I walk passed. It is about the brand, the supporters. Unless there is another brand surpass the Apple and some really bad news that hurt the Apple image. Otherwise, Apple stock is very safe to keep. I don't ever listened to the what they called themselves :"" Annalists "". The most important is the Apple has a very solid finance foundation."
"What to do, what to do? Usually it is best to do nothing ...But I am very tempted to flip some shares anticipating a small drop later today so I can buy them back a bit lower ...What to do, what to do?"
buy the dips!
On the bright side - Mac is coming with Face ID

"Only in America do you find people wearing $150 sneakers, drinking $5 cups of coffee, typing away on their $900 cell phone complaining on their social media accounts that they are oppressed and capitalism has failed them."
The best ER in the history of mankind and this has done nothing but fall......HARD
Both AAPL and MSFT posted awesome results
This is making next few weeks look even more Bearish. $130 broken released the Floodgate for $100 and below over the next few weeks.
glad I made in apple what I lost in amc today
looking real good today lads
"Everyday this Bubble is bursting down south, this is Clearly Beginning of Tech Bubble 2.0 Busting."
GE is bringing good things to my portfolio. And the V shaped recovery hasn’t even started yet.
All European and Asian markets up except for one each being down albeit slightly. Some of them are up real real big time. Very positive affect on our market
"Honest to God feel sorry for people who sold last week. You know we live in the biggest and best economy and market in the world, that the economy is opening up, that more people are going back to work, stimulus is on its way and that close to 90% companies met or beat a three years’ average expectations with overwhelmingly beating expectations and you know investing in the stock market will make you between reasonable to very rich (ask Warren Buffett he has given an average of 23.3% return to his investors since 1959) and you want to sell ? Don’t do it. Go long. Stay long. Thank you"
"They fooled people with split shares. Look at the chart August 31,2020 till date today..."
Elon musk owns space X. Isn’t that the company that had a rocket explode yesterday? Yea I’ll pick Tim Cook over risky musk any day.
i guess all the shorts when back to their trailers
"No way out. The problem for the market is that markets have priced in a speedy recovery back to pre-recession norms, no secondary outbreak of the virus, and a vaccine. If such does turn out to be the case, the Federal Reserve will have a huge problem.The “unlimited QE” bazooka is dependent on the Fed needing to monetize the deficit and support economic growth. However, if full employment and economic growth get quickly reached, the Fed will face a potential “inflation surge.”Such will put the Fed into a very tight box... a no-win situation.The surge in inflation will limit their ability to continue “unlimited QE” without further exacerbating the inflation problem. However, if they don’t “monetize” the deficit through their “QE” program, interest rates will surge, leading to an economic recession. This is what Ms. Sue had to say and I agree with her."
Buyers coming back in a big way. Shorts better cover quick!
I bought at 132.90 thinking it was bargain then added at 129.80 now I run out of money to average down. I got $20 dividend though.
Article on “Apple’s biggest mistake was not buying Netflix.”They can fix that by buying $VIAC while it’s still cheap. A drop in the bucket for Apple.
"Apple Car on-road testing increased substantially in 2020. The number of miles driven went up 2.5 times. It’s another sign the company is getting more serious about its self-driving vehicle.Apple told the California Department of Motor Vehicles that its autonomous vehicles drove 18,805 miles in 2020. That’s up from 7,544 miles in the preceding year."
down in the morning and up in the afternoon with higher close seems to be the daily pattern now
People if your long Apple 5 years or longer holding you shouldn't be upset with the price right now! Relax.
aapl is up +1.73% in Europe...
"Apple's is not only the world's Biggest company, it's the power house for Innovation and Growth for all facets of Tech, from your everyday Smartphones, Computers, Headphones to Future AI & Apple Cars and Satellite etc. All facets of Tech is dominated by Apple. Back up the Truck !"
Can someone please guide me on this? I hold 50 shares of apple but did not get any dividend ok last February 5. I trade in IBKR. I am planning to ask the customer support. Before that wanted to check the dividend amount I should have received for 6800 $ market value
So the hedge funds dumped to crush the calls. That makes sense.
Agreed Apple has been working on Autonomous electric vehicle since 2014.....they have continuous patents to prove it.....Apple may be even no ahead of Tesla... who knows?
"WITH ZERO SELLERS ON THIS NEWS AND HIGH VOLUME BUYERS AND SHORTS DEVASTATED, AAPL CAN BE OVER 150 IN 2- 3 SESSIONS"
Thank you America  for the opportunity that I took by getting up 4 in the morning for the last twenty years. Where I am now millions of miles away from homelessness which is very common scene in every nook and corner of California. Contrary I am proud millionaire on a fully paid house mainly because of my hard work and Apple’s miracle. NEVER SELL APPLE!!!
"Record $100 bill+ qtr and it drops 3% lmao wierd. I think its got more to do with Fed Chairman's comments yesterday and ppl just being cautious with Apple valuation and investing elsewhere, though the valuation seems more than justified!!"
"Impact of Apple Watch was underestimated when it came out at first. Same will happen with VR set. Expect utilization for things beyond video games- it will be used for all kinds of training in every industry - medical, airlines. Engineering etc etc. it will be everywhere"
Day Traders closing will be here in 1 minute to drop it into close.
yo guys hold on it will end higher today. Thanko
Gene Munster says buy buy buy Apple today on CNBC. He also like Zillow and Unity Software. He think Zillow could be $400 in a few years as home purchases and the closing aspects is done through Zillow.
"Pay no attention to the low life scaremongering shorts, AAPL will do just fine for many years to come. Will go up another 1000% the next ten years just like the last 10 years."
"This company is going to $200. Buy now and get in cheap. Soon all of the GME money will be pouring into AAPL, as it is the best investment you can make in the entire stock market."
"Majority of the options were bought for last week and this week, so it looks like Apple will not move until next week."
FYI - I bought APPLE long before Buffet did - - - He just bought More..... I knew Apple was Great Years ago..
"Why would are people trying to sell at this stage, with the stimulus about to pass people will have money to buy iPhones and buy apple stock."
Lol unreal
Trump was better for the economy :/
4:13 AM no major news on AAPL to explain pre market sell off. Apple has been sliding too often for comfort. As a long holder there should be no serious concern but as a retiree with a profitable position it may be time to take profits.
unfortunately apple hadn't done anything at all since the split. Im sure it'll turn it's corner but I was really thinking it would have been much sooner already. I expected it at this point around $200. per share based on how well they did during covid
"Real Apple investors know, the difference between this stock and 99% of the others is when you see red it's time to Buy!. Win-win situation"
"After that 4-for-1 split last August I ended with exactly 5,000 shares of Apple. I sure am glad I had the patience to wait out Apple's recent 5 month hibernation. My shares of Apple just made me a little over $20K for my portfolio today. Gotta love the excitement & stomach ulcer of investing!"
I will be selling Apple and buy Tesla!
"Apple is not the stock to short it, u should own it! My average price is 76. Not even a crash will get close to my average price, I wont sell it if goes higher and wont sell if it goes lower."
"With ARKS unload of its AAPL shares, expect red in following trading days!"

"Just chill out, long term investors should be happy "
Futures looking strong
"I am back in. Used covered calls premium on EV, bitcoins stocks to buy back in AAPL. I feel better now, I did not like having no Apple stocks."
Honestly if this goes down to $100 - I might find money to buy more 
Digital wallet exchange -500 million cost with a 5 billion bottom line enhancement? Apple should have already announced it? It’s a no brainer
On the bright side - another $6 run like Monday and we’d be back to $130
Current price of Apple share at Frankfurt is USD 124.46!! Hope it will go up this whole week!
"Hedge funds raise capital on long positions cause of selloff.May not be done yet, but expect a huge day at some point next week, on the UP SIDE>>>>>>>>>>>>>"
for those of you that don't know or are in denial major stock holders like buffett would crash the stock if they sold all in one trade. because they get discounted prices and other advantages ( we don't) the are restricted as to dumping too much too fast
WB trims Apple and JP Morgan to buy Chevron? Hehe. When every Fund and ETF are adhering to ESG investing and staying away from the Oils. Me thinks Warren whom I greatly admire at 90 years old is losing the plot. 
Janet Yellen pushes for stimulus package. Market will rocket  tomorrow

"Investors need to think of three things:1. Time horizon2, Risk tolerance3, Cash flow requirementsI remember once a friend from Italy called me that he was sitting on someone else money for a short time and wanted to make a score.I told him I could not help him.Why? I did not have ""tomorrow's paper""!"
"you yuppers that quote your business professors p/e , earnings etc. sweet sounds of wall street means nothing when your stock is being unloaded by Investers with common sense. this is a big tech stock doing business on China and continues to censor Americans. that is why you we lose money on aapl."
Apple to close today above 140 and we see 150 by March Best company of all time
Warren said he wanted to be the 1 shareholder in apple. he is not doing that. something has changed.
"Ok, when was the last time Apple stock got smashed after quarterly results?"
"Fantastic Day from Apple. Really driving up the price at the end. Investors throwing money at the Apple Car, All wanting to be taken fir a spin "
"I bought apple in 2011 worth of 63000 Canadian dollars at 221 and at that time I phone 4 was at its peak . for some reason I listen to a friend who told me to sell because these phone companies are not good for long term . look what happened to blackberry from 180 to 29 at that time . also Samsung is coming up with similar phone with better camera. I got scared and sold my apple at 236.if I kept my 285 shares of apple, today after 7:1 split in 2014 and 4:1 split in 2020, I would have 7981 share at price 135.37. this will be worth 1,080,509.86 today.so please do not make my mistake and panic and sell.Apple is here to stay and grow. billions of loyal customers , high quality products, great innovations, diversified services, EV in the horizon.I went back to Apple at the beginning of Pandemic and loaded with 1200 share below 300 price.will never sell Apple"
"Why would Apple tie themselves to tesla which doesn't make a profit and its vehicles are vastly overpriced. the nature of electric motors that they have hugely increased torque over gas engines, so these videos of Teslas beating Ferrari gas cars is all blurb until ferrari run their own electric system, and this is all areas that Apple will want to stay out of, they don't want to be messing in that field, their business is the brains of the automobile"

"Hello....investors? Over here. You know, the company that has $195.57 billion in cash on hand and just made $111 billion dollars in three months...more than most companies make in a year! Buy me already!!"
Apple needs to announce buybacks with that $14B in bonds like yesterday. At this point the stock price isn’t rising organically from operations. A huge beat does nothing to the stock price. Hope AAPL doesn’t become the next CSCO or even worse XOM.
The only green is the hedge funds taking profits
This should make all small investors in Aapl really mad. Don't you see the big money boys have gotten together and MANIPULATED Aapl and other stocks from 145 down to now. Complaining to the SEC will not do any good. (I tried and got zero results) Congress has got to get involved to straighten out the market. Prices should go up and down based on earnings and expected future results. If Aapl exec are smart they should buyback 2 B as promised between NOW and 160.
So current year high estimate eps at 4.76 gives Apple an after net cash PE of 37 at a 185 stock price....$185 at year end sounds about right to me unless of course Apple blows past the high estimate. Which they always do.

"Why does APPL need need to getin to a new businesses which is ahighly competitive, and challenging enterprise and compete with the likes of Toyota, GM, Ford,Tesla and a hundred others when they can concentrate on audio/video, drivability controls and drivetrain management systems and have all the other manufacturers as customers and not competitors?Computers, communications, ITis APPL domain and they should stick to it instead of venturing of in to new frontiers with new partners."
"Let me share with you a story.I had found an old friend after 20 years. Eventually we discussed the stock market. I suggested AAPL but was more consumed in day's action...put/calls. etc.She did not understand and lost money. I finally said ""Just buy AAPL and hold it. Don;t worry you will make your money back. Split adjusted AAPL was $4- then"
Here we go!
just hold and you'll be fine
"When taking into account my entire family and all of our clients, we have made over $10 million dollars off AAPL alone. That's why I have zero tolerance for shorts on this name...when you make money like that it's game over. Shorts will never see money like that, not even close. The best they can hope for is pocket change, at worst homelessness. If AAPL were the only stock you ever owned and you owned enough at a cheap enough price, you could hang up your business suit and retire to Florida. Vs. being short you could be forced to fly a sign at a highway exit. You have to decide which sounds better: retirement or begging for money. The answer to anyone with a brain is obvious."

Who were the people who sold apple yesterday for 119 ? They will regret for sure
apple will be up 4 points on Wednesday in a 200 points Nasdaq composite rally.
"It will be interesting to see if investors retaliate against Apple for stopping talks with Hyundai/Kia for an EV partnership. That's what happens when investors get excited over something and it turns into nothing. I'm just thinking the whole thing was fake news from the very beginning. Fake news started by Facebook to payback Apple for messing with ad-tracking. Anyway, it was amusing how some analysts were saying how much money Apple would make from an EV. Talk about counting chickens before they hatch and Apple doesn't even have any eggs. Tesla owns the EV market and the only wheels Apple has is for the Mac Pro. Apple has plenty going for it right now and that's what investors should focus on. Forget that pie-in-the-sky AppleCar. 2024 is a long way off. By then, Tesla will be the car equivalent of Android OS and AppleCar won't even matter. Apple now needs to hammer X86 laptops into junk and double-down on streaming content. Apple still has an outside chance to challenge Netflix, Disney+ or Amazon Prime Video thanks to all those active Apple devices.Apple's EV chances are near zero with Musk running Tesla. Tim Cook is too busy pushing privacy which almost no one cares about. Tim Cook is doing the best he can but he's no match for Elon Musk. Musk can sell ice to Eskimos with tweets. Apple just needs to get those Apple Silicon 27"" iMacs and 16"" MacBook Pros with beefed-up M-series chips ready for sale. Apple can't touch Tesla but can certainly give AMD and Intel computer makers a run for the money."
wait .until 110 to buy.
As per analyst if there will be 10% downside for entire market then $aapl already had 10% down side from it's all time high. So coming days it will be upside. Stay calm!!
Stimulus passed overnight! $1400 each. Watch the iPhones fly off the shelf’s
Apple will also continue to research and buy companies which are well run and will positively affect its top and bottom lines. Apple will end 2021 at $400 per share

"Looks like Apple and $MSFT are taking a breather while the rest of the market moves higher  I expect sideways movement for a month or two. Then, when we get closer to the next ER expect another surge. At least that’s been the pattern as of late "
Why do people want apple to rise up like crazy? Go to Tesla for that. Apple isn’t as overvalued as Tesla or other hyped up stocks. It’s mostly always chillen around the same price. Seems like a positive to me.

"When fully autonomous vehicles become a practical reality, it will forever change the way we look at the car. The car is the next platform and Apple knows it. They want to control it, not just build an operating system for it. Instead of driving, the ""driver"" will be free to consume media of all sorts and that is square in Apple's wheelhouse for the build out of its services and media offerings. This is definitely Apple's long-game -- not to just compete in the EV market for the sake of building another EV. Just IMO, of course."
What’s the excuse today or this week?
Appl stock stuck at support levels between$120 and $125. It goes up then gets dragged down to these levels by the end of the day.

look at this dow up 425 and apple down 1.52... cook should retire... all he cares about is social activity on twitter. never comments about his own company. just lets wall street manipulate his stock every day. at lease musk opens his mouth to get his stock to move now and then. thanks tim for nothing in 6 months.

Anyone who stayed long since WE first came here in 2008 is up from $4 ( split adjusted) price"
Lol you all acting like Buffet and Vanguard sold off all there shares where in truth they just took a very little for profit something any healthy investor does no?
Just sell $120 here buy back $80

"Many factors have combined resulting in fall for AAPL in last 3 weeks:1. Buy the rumour sell the news phenomenon happened on earnings call.2. Stock went till 131 and rebounded to 137.3. Last week, WB and Institutional buyers dumped lot of shares as they booked profits in AAPL and invested in recovery stocks.4. And, lastly this week the general trend of sell offs in all big tech companies; money moved to bonds, recovery stocks and commodities have dragged down the sector."
Hopefully since Apple is doing a buyback on stocks the share price will start to movie upward
For the week Apple was up $5.01
i want to buy some calls today for the earnings. Morgan Stanley has a target of $190 for AAPL. I am looking to add some $160 weekly calls today. May be get 200 of them during the day today.
So many geniuses writing negative things so they can buy in cheap because they own zero apple shares don’t listen to them
feel sorry for those who sold @118
When will apple begin to go back up? And is it worth it to buy more apple stocks as I just bought apple two days ago?
Apple makes big moves.......10 point moves. (Used to be 40 point moves) We are almost at a double run down. Ouch! Get ready to buy for the next two runs up to $140.
"Apple is the future , EVs, phones , Computers , ubiquitous company . If you love the products that's why you invest . Don't lose sight, this is an investment ."
Not selling a company that just netted 28.5B in a quarter. Apple allows me to sleep very well at night.
"Rising channel from last sept,low end is now 122ish should start moving towards highend of 148ish.RSI was looking good the other day,MACD looks like it wants to turn.Hang tough fellows it cant get much worse.I'll be holding until next earnings at least and continue selling those covered calls."
maybe we can make more money with this stock
Anyone here invested in fisker (FSR) new was Apple  linking up with them?
"“Typical March trading comes in like a lion and out like a lamb with strength during the first few trading days followed by choppy to lower trading until mid-month when the market tends to rebound higher,” Hirsch writes.March also sees “triple witching: occur on the third Friday, when stock options, stock-index futures and stock-index option contracts expire simultaneously.Ultimately, seasonal trends suggest that March will be wobbly and could be used as an excuse for further selling, but on that downturn may be cathartic and give way to further gains in the spring.“Further consolidation is likely in March, but we expect the market to find support shortly and subsequently challenge the recent highs again,” writes Hirsch, noting that April is statistically the best month of the year."
"I don’t trust this at all but I don’t need to do anything right here.If it takes off I make money and if it drops below 120, I’m a buyer again !Bring it on !"
Geez finally my account goes up $20K today!!! Whatever the reason this bounced perfectly off $120. from 11/9/2020. Got to break thru $127. to head to $130. next resistance.
People the PLUNGE PROTECTION TEAM has arrived!!!
"Wow. Just wow. Just looked at pre-market and it’s red. What a shock. And for all the longs that say “wait 5 years or 10”, if that’s your attitude,mthen why are you here?"
Sheeple young managers selling because they don't think on their own. Someone told them watch 10-year bond yield and sell if it goes up never asking why would Apple's value change more than other stocks if that happens. Why should I sell given tremendous cash flows and new markets and products on the horizon--no someone said this was the conventional thinking and I'm sheeple.

At the rate Apple retires shares outstanding...it could completely buy itself back in like 20 years.... unbelievable cashflow

"I do not believe Nissan turned Apple down on EV project. Nissan is known for the worst CVT transmissions with multiple failures with cars just at 50k miles. Apple would not partner with Nissan junk. Nissan makes great trucks, but their cars are failures over last 10 years since CVT transmission"
"Slow and steady, bought 5 more shares Monday, all I could afford, but wow, good timing.. :-) cheers... Goal is 1,000 shares by the time I retire...."
How are the money losing companies continuing to go up￼￼? But apple had one of the best quarters in history and it continues to lag.
"Love Apple stock and products. I did close my long position today only because the market feels long in the tooth and overdue for a bad day or two. I am a buyer again in the Mid 120's if it falls back to that. I could very easily miss out on an upward run too. Just a gut take, nothing more."
I've sold my position in AAPL and have assumed the position in $PLTR
If March 1st starts a upswing for Tech especially for Apple which is down 5% it’s a run till April 1st Quarter
"I have wondered why Apple even bothered to split its stock the last time. We haven't seen any appreciable gains since the split that I've noticed. I'm not certain but Apple seems as volatile now as before the split. The split just left Apple with more outstanding shares to keep buying back. Apple still isn't made up of a higher percentage of institutional owners as before the split. I'm not complaining as I've been through splits since 2004 so I have accumulated plenty of shares due to those splits. Are investors actually buying more shares at this price than if Apple's share price were 4X as much? I'm just trying to figure out if anything much changed since the four for one split. I honestly can't tell except for the fact I have more shares. Tesla's split worked very well as investors kept buying more stock, but it didn't work for Apple as investors, for the most part, stopped buying Apple after the split. So, I wonder if Apple got what it expected from the split, that's all. Do most of you long-term shareholders think the last split was worthwhile, so far? Maybe further down the line it may matter? I'm just curious."

"It's to close to sell zone, I'm not losing my original investment. There's no way I'm getting stuck in this. If the correction is 50% we are all finished for a long time."
Stim package  guarantee pass Buy side is strong  People buying on the dip last few weeks. I did !
Everything is temporary. Enjoy today. The downward slide will continue. $75 by Labor day.
This will open $125 plus Monday everyone reinvests on Mondays 
Double bottom at 135ish. That’s a buying signal ppl. 150-160 next two weeks
"I think majority of the traders on the GME board do heavy drugs! Its crazy what some people write, they think its going to 50K! lol"
PLEASE announce a new massive buyback!
"When most of the posts on here are complaining about the share price, and saying how bad AAPL is, that’s when I know it’s BUY time!"
"If you are new to investing ignore the analyst's and the reactions of inexperienced investors about Apple. I have been buying Apple since 2013 and have never sold a share. I have been through several lulls and market corrections. My total return for Apple has been 525%. Just sit back, ignore the noise, and enjoy the ride! If you want my newest forward thinking pick for the next decade it is Draft Kings!"
Predictable. Same pattern for weeks. Just close your eyes...for 6 months...you'll be okay.
Apple should have bought Netflix and Tesla many years ago but they are arrogant and always want to do things their own way. They are finding out that this is not always the best way.Microsoft found this out years ago when they thought they could use their money to push out Google and dominate internet search. Not so easy.
Shorts are toast tomorrow!
"Let's see, last Friday the stock was up over $3.00 and ended the day $.27 up. So today, it was over $5.00 and I predict it will end the day up $.51 What a tease based upon nothing!"
"Guys relax. If you look at every stock that performs well over the long term, you will find some dips like this. Invest in Apple if you feel like it has good growth potential, which I think it does (think next iterations of M1, possibly cars, etc.), just wait and don't obsess over a dip."
Are we not up five or six dollars per share from one month ago?
bought more at 134.04 . ACCUMULATE is the key. Trust in EPS/revenues. Those number don't lie. hedgies will get burned soon. 401K money is bought already. They will cover huge soon. Buy buy
Why anyone on here thinks this is one of the high fliers blows me away. All the other hyper growth tech companies are gonna run up much faster at this point. Apple is a buy and hold for excellent growth and security. When many of these others get wiped out and drop 70-80% you’ll be real happy about holding Apple.
Ok guys ive been memeing in my past posts truth is im also an aapl bagholder. My cost basis is at 126.5 so im glad were up.
"Apple stock is the canary in the goldmine tomorrow. Watch closely. Full disclosure: I bought apple on Tuesday and sold tonight after the market closed and after I heard GameStop was full on for trading tomorrow. I got into GameStop last May and have been riding that bull. In my opinion apple will be one of the first indicators there is a problem in the market tomorrow. It is quick and easy for institutions to get large shares in and out without moving the needle to much. In other words,, there might be selling of apple to cover other risks in the market. I am not an financial advisor or trading professional and please take this advice after you conduct your on Due Diligence. I’m just an average dude making my own observations. Moreover, I have never shorted a stock and have zero intentions to short apple now or in the future."
"Been a long time lover of AAPL since 2010. They won't allow stock to move to quickly but here is what's happening ROOKIES. The stock is in a heavy consolidation mode. Higher highs and higher lows. If this pattern is not broken to the downside soon, this stock will POP. Problem is, it will test your patience and move sideways until it doesn't. Only thing holding it right now are the options traders, too many have 140 calls for this to zoom past that number. Expect expirations and this to move accordingly. Thank me later folks, FerrariJoe is out."
"AAPL should avoid slave labor in China, OMER is made in the USA :[1] Narso approval July 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties. [2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by June, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end. [3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself. Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued, here."

Well who cares anyway. I'm going to own this stock for 40 more years. Glad unlike you people I have a good job and i'm not dependent of stock volatility
AAPL is tanking because of good vaccine news?
"Google has so much cash and so little debt compared to its competitors... over $100B cash after debt. That’s what pushed me to buy at $1500, and glad I did. Forever holding $GOOG $AAPL $AMZN"
"I'm glad I invested in Tesla, today 5% up. Nasdaq green, s&p 500 green, and we are tanking again."
"I see a lot of comments that demonstrate a lack of understanding of the company, its long term performance and its forward earnings and its leadership. I bought years ago at $9. I sold some about 10 years ago because I was over weight. Stock splits do not make prices rise but they are a strong indication of a company that has done well and expects to continue doing so. The lull is merely profit taking and a nervous reaction to the Reddit gang. It is ok to buy and best to hold. Sell if you are out of balance or need cash but this stock is slightly under valued presently and will do well in the medium term as it normally does. There is no negative news. There is only speculation on how to value the automotive move, if it happens. Cook is a creative steady hand. I am again overweight on the stock but am comfortable with that. Enough with the lemons, coiled springs, etc. You sound like cheer leaders or uniformed goofs. Do some research and use logic not emotion. There, got that off my back!"
Relax. Remember when it was $116?
"Hopefully, you Longs didn't panic...This is a poisonous message board."
"Le me share a theory with you. Megacap stocks, including AAPL, will tank in the coming days (short-term) because big funds who have been playing the shorting game will be forced to raise cash to cover their bets. And they will probably start by selling some of their 2020 winners. I would not be surprised if that impact is so strong that we go below the 50 day EMA and could even touch the 200 day. So nothing to do with the stock's intrinsic value or future prospects, but rather the rather futile short-term liquidity needs of hedge funds.Let me hear your thinking on this."
"The transition to EV's will take decades. The grid must be hardened, charging stations have to be deployed in vast numbers and battery technologies must be dramatically improved. Apple has some of the best minds on the planet planning many years down the road so take a breath and enjoy the ride!"
"""Not taking risks is the biggest risk in market"". So don't get panicked after this volatility in $aapl price. Stay long!!!!!!!!!"
I can finally see the $140s right around the corner again!
3 great market days and aapl is up 2.5%. Thanks aapl.
Could still close at $130

Apple is a major player with immaculate financials. It was also one of warren buffets main earners for 2020 despite him shorting a portion of his stock. Long term buy even still even now.

"I’ve been holding for a few months before the split and got in at a high price $130’s for about $40k worth. Was planning holding for a long time but need to money for a quicker short term investment with MRNA before the ER in 2 weeks. I have already a larger position with mRNA but want to add short term. I’ve been very involved with mRNA and confident it will rise at least another $10 before earning minimum which will give me a quick $10k gain. So, see you guys later but will be back in hopefully a few weeks at around the same $130ish price with AAPL."

"I hold Apple and Microsoft stock from 2011, and I am in profit more that 475k. Today I will sell half of my Apple shares and move the money somewhere else, probably Tesla. Apple gave its best and I think thats it. Yes, it is the richest company in the world, but if after 110b ravenue stock price is tanking something is not right. After stock split 6 months ago price is almost the same. Even Warren Buffett sold twice in the last 12 months. Maybe apple car can affect something, but they need to be fast, because competitors are strong."
"Earnings days are rarely good days....regardless of the numbers. Can’t explain it other than tech stocks do not have risk/reward equality. The risk is high, the reward is low. I’m not sure it’s worth holding any tech thru earnings."
Apple is nearing $2.5 trillion market cap. Trailing is Microsoft half a trillion behind. AAPL long the beautiful journey continues. Stay long and celebrate.
I’m celebrating AAPL not down as much as the other red tech stocks for the day...have I finally cracked?
BOUGHT 133 CALL FOR JUNE WORTH OF $10000 - MY BIG RISK ;*
Just bought another 5 shares today. I know it is not much but it is all that I can afford right now. I will buy more in the future once I gather more cash! My goal is to own 100 shares. I’m just 70 away from it!

AAPL is trading below the 50-day SMA (simple moving average) of $131.98. There should be some upside price movement here soon to get back to the 50-day SMA and above in my opinion. This seems like just a good buying opportunity to me.
I bought some $ABNB today before the ER and surprised that numbers came in strong with great guidance. Bought 50 shares at $185. It maybe a shift from big tech like $aapl and $amzn. BUt NIO and $tsla is for long.

"Whoever bought on stock split 6 months ago, today is going in red, very sad. They make you gamble in speculative companies instead to invest in best company in the world like apple and relax."
I'm looking in the pipeline and there is nothing there that is going to move the stock up ! Hope i'm wrong for a change
It’s a beautiful thing owning Apple. This stock is going to $200 as sure as eggs is eggs. IMHO. 
Just buy at market auction! Flat revenues and earnings over past 3 years. Only share price support in 2020 was massive share buybacks. Finance 101 teaches that share buybacks indicate lack of investment opportunities !

"Apple's Project Titan is in process and in Sunnyvale, California Apple purchased an old Pepsi Plant and surrounding areas. Apple knows as it has hired personnel from Volkswagon, Tesla and even Porsche that the production involving the electric vehicle is a go. Apple doesn't like to announce negotiations or plans that they are working on and Hyundai I believe was pressured by Apple to tell the press there were no negotiations going on. Will see what happens but CNBC had a creditable source which was even confirmed by another source. So in regards to the Hyundai negotiations I wouldn't take them off the table as there definitely was something there and where and when the vehicles were going to be built. You haven't heard the last here."
"Let me clarify the statement ""The field is in the hands of investors""Over the past month, many were playing mini dips and doing very well with that algorithim play: 50 to 100% a day.Since trading has been suspended the algorithim play from Tuesday close to Friday close returned anywhere from 100o+% and higher in four days. AAPL Jan 22 $130 calls ran from .65 Tuesday at 1559 hrs to $10+ iintra day high closing at $9.05.Anyone reading these boards who played options should have had this play. I hope so.Let me explain this statement. WE, this community, agreed to no dips and letting AAPL run until after earnings. No, this is not a ""Ponzi scheme"" as someone posted.Where ever AAPL settles it could be $5, $10 or $15 higher from here, AAPL will be AAPL, trading in mini ""v's.It may never see this level again. Earnings play?Be here n 1/27...my lucky number 1027 was my police badge number until ...!"
"Apple will climb back to 145 by Wednesday, then up to 155 by Friday before trading sideways for one week ahead of another major leg up."
Apple is at war with Facebook over privacy polices. Apple does not like it. Apple is attacking FB's revenue model. I hope that these two are coming to an understanding and let the market roll. Check out the Business Insider.
Red or green?
"AAPL is about to have a ruthless revenge rally, let this be a lesson to those who panic sold, if nothing fundamental changed about the underlying, then there is simply no reason to sell."
is apple taking over Viacom?
I bought shares today (friday 5th) am i getting dividends?
$15 minimum wage gone is actually good for businesses in managing expenses. Most of middle class spenders are already above $15. So this wouldn't affect consumption.
if Appl isn't making stock holders $$ on days like this you know the big buyers are not buying. That should tell you something.
"buffet sold apple last week thisweek bill gate trust sold apple both selling now because too much risk now see no value now. no one no one want apple anymore it just move up very very slow or down a few dollars here and there now. everyone is now selling dumping apple now because everyone want to buy everyday new top 15 high flyer stock everyday now likethe bitcoin stock or gme amc koss that will go up 50 to 300 percent on any giving day now , ifyouwantto makebig money you haveto buythe top 15 high flyer stock every day no one want apple nowwill crashbelow $70 in 2021,same with fang stock no one them now ,LIKE MY FRIEND SOLD APPLE AND BOUGHT GME MADE $85,000 IF HE HELD LONGERHECOULD HAVEMADE $150,000"
Apple has to close over $125 today - it hasn’t seen a day like that in weeks. I would be surprised if it doesn’t close over. 125￼￼
hope today's rebound is not a trap...tmr is looking challenging to keep the momentum now...we been down for weeks and deserve couple uptrend weeks ahead
How low today? Lol
"TOLD YOU TO SELL APPLEBY YOU HOLDING APPLE YOU LOSSING ALOT LOT MOREMONEY , TOLDTOLD YOU TO SELL APPLE YESTERDAY IF YOU BOUGHT SYMBOL RKT FOR SAME MONEY AS APPLE.

way way oversold. let the weak hands sell. due for a big reversal
Is it a market crash. What’s with this bond thing?
"so of you write relax have patience for 8 months now. look at Microsoft, Tesla they are going up . but the great aapl is sauce."
Biggest problem is people chasing trends and not investments in the market right now. Quick cash instead of long term.
Is this a joke? A company with best everything is falling for the last 30 days
"yo sisters and brothers futures slightly down but I thing it will turn positive. remember friends it split 4:1 otherwise it would be $540 , In case yo did not know I tookit $135 and multiplied by 4. This Apple Computer maketh so easy to do just about anything I want to do. Thanko"
Apple is unbreakable! A few bucks down here means nothing! Toxic bears and shorts will learn it the hard way when our baby hits 150 USD in a few weeks. Stay tuned!
In a perfect word..?Gap at open then runs...NO am DIPS
Pretty much everything up except AAPL and TSLA. I can understand TSLA being down but not AAPL. Not too concerned though. This thing is a cash machine
Dividend increase and a $100 billion share buyback coming.
AAPL going up with high volume (over 145 million so far today). Seems pretty positive to me
Have a nice day!
"As earnings season winds down and once again Apple proves to have the best results and most potential, buyers will pile back in again...nothing better"
Love how a massive amount of people will hold strong on their shares with a terrible company like GameStop but people see a dollar drop on the best company in the world and will start to sell. SMH give me a break
Tim Cook is selling his apple shares and buying Nokia instead.
it's nice to see a flat day no wild ups or downs ill take that over negative
This sell-off thing goes comedy and a joke...
"With earnings about a week away, I just wanted to share some thoughts...Firstly, about analyst expectations. Folks, if Apple reports massive revenue it's great for us don't get me wrong, but some analysts calling for $100 billion or more in revenue, that's kind of unrealistic. It's almost like they're setting up Apple to fail. What if Apple only reports $85 to $90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price? And let's not forget Apple did not provide guidance for this quarter. So expectations are too unrealistic. We're still in the middle of a pandemic. We're not out of the woods yet. If Apple can perform as good as they did last year I'd be satisfied, but if they do even better then that then I'd be very pleased. Secondly, I believe the selling is way overdone. We should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements. The stock held onto the support level very well technically. So I believe the stock has a lot more room to run. There's so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth. The continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long run.Third, I mentioned this in the past but I don't believe Apple will comment about Project Titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers. So don't expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on. I know many are eagerly waiting for this but still.Fourth, when earnings are announced, pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that aren't being focused on as much like Apple Fitness. I believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future. Definitely not priced in at this current price.Own it don't trade it! Apple long!"
"Here on out, AAPL will be following the recovery pattern from the last week of March through April 2020. Please trade accordingly"
Keep in mind Hyundai makes it’s own luxury brand Genesis. Those cars are no joke. The Genesis G70 was the 2019 Motor Trend Car of the Year. Really? Yup it sure was. https://www.motortrend.com/news/genesis-g70-2019-car-of-the-year/?galleryimageid=2311041
Maybe if Tim Cook changes the company's name to GameApple Stop then the share will rocket 200% in 2 days on practically zero profit earnings reports...!
Why is Apple down this week. Two plus trillion market cap. Thanks for any info.
At least it displayed a bit of afternoon strength.
"For those who not aware, Bill Gates sold half of his shares in Apple"
"Interesting.News how Warren and Vanguard trimmed a few shares and AAPL falls past 50 DMA and upward tend indicator.Now it is down $2+ in pre-market.WE may see $127 as per ""historical prices""."
Everything points to AAPL treading water here $135 for near term. Today and yesterday the algorithim players had their 100+%+days.How?They made lemonade out of lemons
"I love how this board is so negative when price drops like Apple will go belly up, but when it goes up a few bucks everyone praises how great Apple is. Buy and hold. Patience is key. I wouldnt panick until Buffet sells his shares. This is a buy and hold stock that WILL make you money."

Warren Buffett sold 6% of his Apple holdings...
There are a bunch of scared people that were chasing IPO's with sky high PE's or a negative PE. When people get scared they run towards the greatest company in the world. I have been long since 2013 and hold every single share!
"Just like the iPhone, Apple will take as long as it needs to produce it’s perfect car￼.It’ll probably pair up with a leading contract manufacturer like Magna, to produce a futuristic car with a paragon of technology that we don’t know we want yet.Tomorrow’s sp is not so relevant"
Apple is set to give Tesla a real run when it comes to e-cars. They have married with a major car company that knows how to make cars in volume. They will also have the Apple appeal for younger folks and also the luxury feel that attracts Tesla customers. These new cars will be a MAJOR hit and solidify Apples position for the next 15 years. You won't be able to touch APPL below $1000 a share if not double that once cars are selling.
Tomorrow premarket itself it will be pumped High 135 or 134.5 and then 137 likely possible ....Friday again options day so can’t expect much ...so technically they baked in 50% of the hike before earnings ...
"AAPL will pivot, as it always does, then run to new all time highs"
Apple stock price dead for the next 3-6 months.
Apple has sold the most call options today on the market for going up next week!
The biggest problem with these amazing growth stocks is the rising interest on bond yields. Also the rising interest puts pressure on future profits of Apple. This way people are moving back to more price steady dividend stocks to neutralize the risk in their portfolio's. Personally I dont think we hitted the bottom yet. We will definitely see some bigger lows. Maybe even in the 100 range.
Where's the $127 support from AAPL
Market green and we’re still struggling :/
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html
Breakout coming
Once the hype over GameStop is over. People will be taking their money and investing it in companies that actually make money like Apple.
Great buying opportunity. I think the bottom the analysts called was $110. We shall see. only because of institutional sell off that will probably buy back in. That's fine with me the dividend will buy me more shares. AAPL long.
"2 trillion dollar company and some noob say it is a trash... 0 debr, fine cash flow, cool products!!"
Could Warren Buffet cutting his position in Apple be the cause for the drop these past two to three weeks?
We’ve just seen 3 green days over the past 10 trading days :/
"You can buy apple end of March at $104,wait for 12 months and sell at $125. That's nice 20% profit. Or you can buy today one of the Airlines, sell on friday for 15% profit."
What will tomorrow bring?
Highest PE since 2007 iPhone 1 debut.2020 earnings were from stim checks and covid stay at home. Not sustainable
Kudos to $AAL for allowing $OPTI employees to utilize the Rapid Test product recently during travel. Dr. Drew complimented the $AAL team as well. The patent also for the UV-C that either $AAPL or Samsung is in talks with through $OPTI will change the world for the better. Big shout out to which ever one of them had to courage to move forward with the UV-C patent technology in cell phones and tablets. Big money and safety for all.
Buy buy HEDGIES will cover soon. They're toast. They are nervous.. MARKET UP AND AAPL RED...AAPL will gap up in pre market. Shorties will cover in huge legs. They won't let money overnight. BUY BUY soon

the 145 to 118.39 huge pullback is finally over. the markets are done pulling back.
"Yahoo is reporting that Melvin Capital lost 53% of its worth shorting stocks in January 2021. I think that was between $4 to $ 5 billions with a B.For God’s sake brothers and sisters do not short the market. Stay long and be happy. I used to short and always lost and was always unhappy. My spouse threatened to leave. Today I have core holdings such as Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Microsoft, NXP, Marvell, wmt, Target, Amazon, Costco, Home Depot etc etc and then large amount in mutual funds. There are some excellent families of mutual funds such as Fidelity etc . Buy Blue Chip Growth, Select Semiconductor, Select Software, OTC, Small Capital Growth, Growth Companies (if closed it will guide you to a compatible Fund) , Fidelity Select Technology etc. Quite a few of them have Apple as a core holding. Investing with Fidelity etc you sleep like a baby. You simplify your life and let the experts do the investing. You just tell them which sector you like and then the experts who are employees of these funds do what they do best i.e. research for you . I look at the managers’ profile and I am impressed with their backgrounds and education. As for me I have never been happier as I am now. Thank you"
"I’m not stressing, this is a blessing in disguise. Will eventually leave lots of room for growth to the upside and we all get a discounted price along the way, up until it’s time for AAPL to take off again. Patience is key"
"apple is down today because the 13d filings are later, and it will show large investors are selling off apple. also the Nissan news was bad."
"Buffet trimmed his AAPL holdings by 6% because it was too overweight in his portfolio. If you think this is a reason to panic and sell, you don't need investment lessons, you need a shrink. I'm buying, thank you."
they are selling out of the value stocks and back into growth like apple and tech stocks to rebalance at monthend. the close should be interesting
Did everybody mark dividend hunter / dig’s post from this morning ?

When Buffet sold WFC in the low 20s is when i was buying. Bought WFC at $22 right after the news Buffet sold. Now up 54% on WFC. Will be the same with AAPL. Buffet just trimmed a little AAPL but still holds as his biggest position.
"Tomorrow's reaction when everyone sees that Apple made $111 billion in one quarter, beating estimates by $8B..."
Dividend increase 
Looks like it will turn positive. Meanwhile I am so jealous because my uncle Warren is accumulating more and more as he sees a great buying opportunity. Honestly where could you go wrong. Similarly all the pension funds and mutual funds and ETF are buying too. Uncle Warren is needs to adopt me . I would love to go with him to Dairy Queen while he develops his strategies
Congrats to all the Apple bag holders. It looks like you're only going to lose about 2% today. As for tomorrow...bend over and assume the Apple stock holder position.
today will run 5%+
Institutional investors don’t normally dump like that unless the need a load of liquidity in a hurry.
Why big boys keeping AAPL stagnant? When we all know that this is going up all the way to (((($200))) before December 31. All LONGS should accumulate right here. MOney in the bank is getting ZERO return but AAPL Dividend plus growth both imminent. IMHO we will all regret to keep our money in the bank getting dead every day. IMHO very strong buy ...Buy and forget it for couple of years and see how your money is grown. imo BUY BUY BUY
My entire portfolio is up today except for you guess it! AAPL
"Apple up at least $3 tomorrow, the corrections are done. The March to $150 begins"
AAPL has devalued about -18% so far this month! Fire sale!
Major trouble for apple record earnings and it’s been on a free fall ever since. Just imagine next earnings will not be as great I can see this going low
Tim Cook should announce REVERSE SPLIT 4-1 to decrease number of shares.Since that doomed split on 9/1 the stock has not been acting normal.
I guarantee there are lot more than usual who will be peeking in at 3:30pm and 3:50pm. LOL.
"Did you know there’s no real outbreak of COVID in China? I hear the new saying is “Come do business in China, CoronaVirus free”, CEO of Moderna stated that Covid is with us forever. If that is the case and China can continue to effectively contain it, how does this effect their economy and society over 5-10 or say even the long term effects over 50-100 years?"
I wonder if AAPL is going to have a positive day again. Convert your retirement plans to cash before there is nothing left to convert.

How much more can apple go up...will it take five years to breech 200? Just wondering. Why would anyone scared of a temporary little dip?The only sure thing with a company’s stock... “it will go down AND it will go up”.
Da faq was that massive dump at the close.  not even a share holder but this action with Appl worries me

All the smart ones are jumping in today. Next week will be much higher!!
Hopefully yesterday’s announcement will keep it over $133. I personally think that it will only fly after this is officially confirmed by apple or Kia/Hyundai. Should happen soon!

Apples  time to pull a Tesla and breakout. Hold on Tightttt
Hmm we had a $144.34 after hours 
I'm so glad I sold all my Apple Holdings on Wednesday this week. Apple looks like it's in for a big dip.
$111 Billion revenue (IN ONE QUARTER) on 39% gross margins for a $2.3 TRILLION company ! Long & Strong STILL. More upgrades are sure to follow. Forget about any short term hiccups there MAY be. We're good Apple family. Cheers !

These past 3 weeks have been a great stock buyback and retire for Apple...keep bringing down those shares outstanding and although it’s a meaningless number the market cap too.
Buffett trimmed some apple to go heavy into 5G. No shock there.

"@Sean, this thing is up 75% in the last 2 years. Now u cry because it’s not up today. Sell your imaginary 5000 shares you’ve had since 2006. u are way ahead"
AAPL is doing what is has for 12 years. It is forming a new base. Look at that 12 year run. $4 to $133+ todayDead money? Hardly.Meanwhile ( Steve Colbert) algorithim players have their fun.

After these numbers can’t wait to add to my position tomorrow. Need to act in the morning because will be green by end of day.
"Tesla is turning green here soon. I think Walmart is a better buy than Apple right now, Walmart is down $8 and at the floor. Apple is free falling every day. Yeah you all say it will come back, but I think your wrong. This stock is finished, Wall Street hates it and it shows."

"Exactly one year today a CNN financial expert announced the reason the stock market dropped was because of Trump’s policies, hmm>?"
What is wrong with Apple Market up 400 points in this thing can't even move up at all we should be at 140 by now
good to buy the dip. the Fed will always do more stimulus if market goes down. Yellen doesn't want banks to lose money. she gets millions of dollars for speeches she gives to banks and hedge funds.
I hope for 4% red tomorrow. Shorting more. Only if the all market is green then apple will be only 2% in red.
"Asian markets are crashing tonight.Hong Kong is down 2.59% now.Tomorrow, longs will regret not selling today.Just like last year, we will have a major crash in March. This time, there will be no fake recovery.I feel sorry for the retirees who are counting on their AAPL holdings."
Like I said...solid green markets. No gains. If the markets turn south for a few days...this will be sub $130 fast.
"Last Friday, mid day. we posted to take profits to end Mexican stand-off. Stock flatlined going into close then dipped $2- on Monday.

"During a one year pandemic, accompanied by an instant recession, record unemployment and untold business closures Apple prospered. The current administration will lead us into another recession and, once again, Apple will prosper. Why?

Up 55 cents lol. AAPL is due for a spike up to 150. Should be over 145 now easily.
Thank you Apple..........
"There is just no interest in buying this stock at a higher price, just dips. Revenue and earnings growth in 2021 is already baked in with consensus growth in 2022 and 2023 at 5%.

"4 years from now your going to look back and say, I remember when Apple announced they were coming out with a car. You will either say I’m glad I held my shares buying more along the way and dividend accumulations. Or Damm why did I sell? The choice is yours! See you when the car comes out. I’ll have at least 2500 shares or more.￼￼"

"Apple Fun Fact: At the beginning of the 6+ SuperCycle, Apple stock was at about $400 per share. Split adjusted, Apple stock is $4,000 per share today........3 months into the 12 Phone SuperCycle.

Apple is 3 months into the second 2 year SuperCycle........$200 per share is not just doable, it’s probable."

Relax everyone. This will hit 147-150 within a few weeks. Lots of profit taking today from everyone who bought prior to earnings.
I want to buy at $125/share - I’m adding every $5 drop... come on shorts!!
"Just bought 500 more Apple and am in the long haul Now I have 3000 ,Min 3-5 years ,I think its one of the greatest ethically and professionally managed companies in the world .People who are panicking and selling should not invest in stocks .Warren Buffet just reduced a very small part of his Apple holding ,Nothing to Panic .It could be any number of reasons and its still his largest holding ."
se 6/18 125 puts I sold for $12.35 last week are looking sweet today.
"Well at least we know it wasn't about AAPL. This just happened to be the canary in the coal mine indicating the big guys were pulling profits for the time being. Good thing though is AAPL is also the go-to for the large fund holders when it's time to turn the overall market back up. Only question is where is the bottom and with a P/E of only 33 relative to most of what else is out there and having already crossed the 50DMA, it feels like we're close on this market leader."
"When I got in years ago I took a round trip back to my cost basis after being way up. Bought more, stayed long and now Im up over 400% AAPL is a long term hold."
WELCOME TO THE BIDEN CRASH. BYE BYE 401K $aapl $amd $spy
Something seriously wrong when the market recovers and Apple does not participate.
"I bought 200 shares at 137 and plan on holding for 10 years minimum. Don't step in the boat if you can't handle a wave or 2. Hope they team up with GM, my other long term bet."
Sell before she starts sinking further from 130.
Lordy Lordy Dow is up and soon NASDAQ and S & P up too. By the time Timmy finishes his tea all three indexes will be greeny green. Thanko
Let's go Apple Love green Apples. Hit that 140 mark soon!!!
If Buffet sells another chunk next quarter you know something is up and he's getting out. The only reason he doesn't unload his full billion shares on the market is cuz he knows it would send the stock reeling down to $20 bucs...so he's decided to give you the beaten slowly...ain't it cool
I like how the comments shift when a stock price shifts... From Negative to positive and the other way. In every forum the same. It shows that people still invest with emotion.
"time to sell Apple shares I feel , before they drop anymore"
"Someone put some call bearish , spire in 5 days at 120 if that not happened that company need to buy more and more and aapl stock will be higher or if happen we will be down again will see "
"Buy apple, hold apple, profit from apple Squeeze the shorts out of this quality business "
"Won't end well, Big Apple Bubble busting, Crash imminent."
Today is like a dog shaking off the fleas. The longs are back in control!!!
"Newbie question... I bought AAPL @ $114 and own only 75 shares, normally after earning people will sell or hold?"
I bought a majority of my first initial shares at $106-110 after split. So many of you are babies!!!! Lol
"Kia doesn’t make any sense. AAPL partnered with BMW to have the first wireless CarPlay solution. They partnered with BMW to provide the first phone/car key solution. I would have thought they would partner with BMW on project Titan. BMW is known for high quality cars, “the ultimate driving machine”. Kia is know for low cost, cheap plastic cars and if you look at BMW vs Kia in terms of brand quality and loyalty and compare it to what AAPL stands for, I have a hard time believing Kia is the right company to partner with."
Wall street now punishing big tech for supporting Democrats and sleepy Joe. Tech best be careful right now after giving Tens ￼ of millions to them.￼￼￼￼
Every time I buy it go down then I sell I went up. Please give a advice. Many thanks
all the selloffs on below average volume. the semiconductor stocks and banks are at all time highs.
Apple started the year at $132.69. I believe it ends the year around $165.
"It keeps dropping to the bottom of the Bollinger Band and pops back up. The trend is up from early trading today. It’s gonna close next to even, maybe a small gain. My guess is as good as yours"
"Sad to hear Fry’s electronics is closing. In my early years with Apple, we would go there all the time to get parts. (And groceries)"
"If you don’t have a simple investment strategy, you won’t even beat index fund over time. The simplest strategy works the best! Buy and hold good business!"
Turning around nicely. Meanwhile Warren Buffett etc are increasing their holdings. Warren is the smartest Investor in the world and so are people from Fidelity investments etc. These smart investors are definitely increasing their positions as more and more people start 401k and 403b plans . Fidelity accounts have increased by 19% because the greatest people on earth know that they cannot only depend on social security to maintain a standard of living which they would like to enjoy in their retirement years. Great people we Americans are!
"Based on a hunch, Apple stock will trade at 1000 per share, at least, by the year 2025."
If the buffet letter doesn’t move the stock on Monday along with the stimulus passing last night then the stock is broken and so is the market
AAPL or IBM? both are in low 120 both pays dividends at different rates.I own AAPL shares purchased at 132.90 and 129.80 now deciding to average down AAPL or establish positions in IBM.
"This is a waste of time, Tim Cook needs to focus on the stock not MArk at Facebook. Jesus, we need the stock to thrive not tank on stellar earnings."
If the rates keep playing about & NASDAQ continues dropping we’re gonna have a painful day longs
"I prefer buffett to Warren buffet , at least I only lose $19 versus his underperfoming stock"
Guys is it okay to buy Apple at 134.60
Ford and gm are moving higher due to them releasing news constantly about ev cars and partnerships. Cook just doesn’t get it with all the secrecy around his future product development. He could be moving this stock well higher than it is for his shareholders but he doesn’t care. This is what I hate about him and his style
Now a 15% ($21.00)decline in a month with NO uptick due to a great financial report. And still dropping.
What’s going on with Apple
"The stock price fall from 145 to 132 had little to do with the company's fundamentals or earnings. They had the best earnings quarter in company history. The steep fall from 145 to 132 was directly related to the GameStop trades. The big boys had to cover their short positions in the meme stocks and decided Apple was the lowest hanging fruit to raise funds to cover those positions. As such, they sold Apple reluctantly. In a normal market, Apple's earnings should have taken the stock to low 150's. So if the market stabilizes this week, I look for a big jump in Apple price. Apple looks very underpriced relative to its peers and earnings and hopefully will make a quick recovery to reflect its stellar past quarter."
Green ! :-)
Down 16% today to 122 and change from 145 with no end in sight. I guess they want to retest 118 again. The market is so predictable. Buy in buy orders for 118-119
It was nice to get some last Thursday at $121. I love when that happens
"What did I tell you??? It will be back to 70.You can't involve in politics, fight against 100 million people conservatives and think you can win the market.People are ditching iPhone and Apple product."
This is about the same timeframe the breakout occurred after the 2014 stock split...history repeating
I have the ability be patient. That's why I'm rich. Apple and patience go hand in hand. The most successful investors are patient. The posts on this MB are indication of how unsuccessful these posters are.
"How many competitors does Apple have in vehicles? 20 and they will never rise to the top without dumping billions. How many competitors does Apple have in a crypto wallet exchange platform?, 3 and for 500 million Apple would be at the top and add billions to the top and bottom line. It’s a no brainer"
Charts tell my to buy.. so I did.. bought sep 130 options... charts dont fail me now.......
"I agree that the news about Buffett selling SOME shares is a huge overreaction. I'm taking the opportunity to accumulate on as many dips that I can so I plan to buy a few more shares on Friday this week. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Apple, it just recorded a record breaking quarter. And Warren is still holding about half his portfolio in Apple. Money managers rotate their portfolios all the time. Who cares, buy the dip."
Apple will have yo buy back 250 billions in stock to be cash natural
"To everyone who’s frustrated. I checked again. Institutions have begun buying apple stock again! We should start to see this go up hopefully next week. Like today, EP wealth bought $120M worth of apple shares. Lots of buying and just one or two institutions sold.Stay strong!!Before anyone asks - I checked on marketbeat :)"
"In just 1.5 hours, $55B GONE."
Just bought an IPad today... Adding a drop in the bucket but Doing my part. 
"apple will be going back to 118.39 for a bottom test, then 201.49 at the end of the year."
Unbelievable
Did they announce the actual dividend increase yet?
Gonna be a long 4 years
"Don't get nervous boys, 2021 Q1 will be very strong since the iPhone was delayed until November for release."
A good time to go fishing. Aapl will be there when I get back.
A sell off based on NOTHING
buy now or forever hold your peace
"Apple's annual shareholders meeting is set to take place on February 23, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time,"
"There is no reason for the market to be down. Unemployment claims are lower , new jobs and returning jobs being created. Over 90% beat expectations based about three years average (all that bs about lowered expectations does not hold water) there is stability in the political scene and the Senate is evenly divided which means it will be very hard to pass a stupid bill such as tax increases, stimulus is on its way, Covid cases are down , vaccines are doing well (I got both my vaccines sine I am high risk and also work in a high rise areas and I have had no side affects whatsoever), yes Warren sold 85 million shares of Apple but he still holds 900 million shares of Apple. And what did he do with the money after selling 84 million Apple shares, he reinvested the money into the market which means great confidence in the market. I think some people trying to run the market down may also be jealous of the current administration. Stay invested and you will reap the rewards"
Apple being sued the stock is sideways it just doesn't seem like it's a stock I can believe in
"market is based on record marget debt, imploding"
Apple Commits To Yearly Dividend Increaseshttps://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2021/02/28/apple-commits-to-yearly-dividend-increases/
i have been considering buying apple for a while .. i see years of growth and a bright future for this company. today i got in people who think apple is only a phone ..... we are going to be shocked what the future will do!
People are very impatient it seems. You act like this is supposed to go up $5 every day. Price ran up when split was announced and still at the same levels. Only takes one day for this to recover all of the last 2 week losses.
"As I have said before, AAPL going down... down... down...."
People really need to get a grip and stop looking at Apple day to day or month to month and bellyache.. Just buy it and keep adding when you can. It’s a core investment that you shouldn’t swing trade. It’s always made you money (if you’re smart) and will continue to do so. Just buy and hold. Come back when you’re ready to retire.
"Of interest to some:NewScientist reports that the Perseverance rover is powered by a PowerPC 750 processor, which was used in Apple’s original 1998 iMac G3 — you remember, the iconic, colorful, see-through desktop."
The fact Wall St can pin this at 129.90 with such precision today means this is not going down to 119 as shorts and prospective buyers are thinking. Just buy it here
I told you all $4.50 today and another $15 overnight This stock will be trading at 80-85 dollars here soon maybe 60
"Yield pulling back , stimulus 1.9 trillion and apple stores starting to reopen nowhere else to go but up."
what is wrong with the stock it should be screaming with the results of the last quarter
$100 coming...$90 coming...lol...some of you been bashing and mongering fears last couple of weeks...it’s a rock solid company...don’t bet against it
Meanwhile Warren Buffett is fully invested in the market. We still owns 900 million shares of Apple. Yesterday he made some big purchases of two companies. He is fully invested in the market
Apple is a great stock to write calls with. I’ll take this correction and write my calls and collect that ￼ premium to reinvest with.
I bought 100K of Yugo stock today on margin.I read on Reddit that Yugo is the next big thing.
"Am I taking profits after earnings? No I am not. My shares are not for sale, thank you for your interest. Apple longs know to own it don't trade it. This is such a simple but poorly understood statement. Holding long is how you keep your cost basis down and this is how huge gains are made. In the case of Apple, holding long has been a blessing. And besides if you sell out you might miss the Project Titan reveal whenever that happens. So in short, own it don't trade it."
I guess you buy high. Sell low. Buy higher?
Down about 10% from recent high so time to increase purchases tomorrow....Its so satisfying adding to my Apple position
I'll be living off the dollar menu for the next few months I geuss
"6 months wasted with this investment. Feels like I went to work for 6 months and got paid nothing. Not only that....it’s a loss, so I feel like I paid to work. Either get going next week or retirement papers are pulled again. Let’s go, doggie, time does not stand still."
"Kia is the Perfect partner. Let Tesla fight it out with Mercedes and BMW Audi and Lexus and their ilk. Because that’s what’s coming down the road. Apple/Kia will be an every man’s car made in a total robotic factory. Kia builds a first class economic car. Apple will eventually spit out 400,000 cars in Georgia. PLUS the same in other plants around the world as they get going. The genie is out of the bottle. And if Tesla thinks they have a loyal following. What do you think Apple has! Hehe "
up 63% YoY. computers moving $$profit to recovery stocks. Stay long.
AAPL could literally come out with a toilet seat tomorrow and sell millions. This is a buy and hold and continue to accumulate and reinvest the dividends for life and then pass along to your children when you’re gone.
"All my friends think I am crazy . I just put all my eggs in one (apple) basket ..need to leave alone for one year ..no looking may be look 3 mo, 6 9 mo....anyone agree..? leave no look one year..."

Friday they stole ur shares!!! Amazing how fkd up these wallstreet crooks are!!! I added on the dip!!! Always add apple on dips!! 25 off the high!!! Back to 145 and higher!!! Let’s go!!!
bought 30 shares last week. caught the dip at 141.98 yesterday and bought an other 50I have also 200 calls hopefully we will see double digit after hours
I’m an AAPL stock holder. I strongly suggest that AAPL remain an electronics company and leave political and social media to others.
Eventually those that need to or want to sell after earnings sell and what’s left are core holders who never sell. Once the weak hands are out we jump to the next level....happens every single time
Is that green I see ? Oh boy
$150 or bust
"If you think that apple is horrible, take a look at Amazon. It looks that they plan all year to hold down tech stocks."
"Over reaction as always, it takes patience folks............"
Dont sweat the last couple days. This is a 400.00 stock. 200.00 eoy!!

Who wins today? KC -3 over 56?
"The March 5th, $132 strike price calls for AAPL are looking pretty good."
The last 5 minutes will tell.
something big is coming down the pike. load up. 150.00. don't sell.
Head fake. Green will be back soon. It’s kind of like a game
"$OXY holders will benefit from this rotation. As long as the 10 year continues to rise, people will avoid tech stocks like $AAPL and $TSLA. Great for value stocks; like OXY."
shut down facebook. they are gathering all your information. dont ever buy their stock. Thats why facebook fears apple
A pullback + great earnings + Apple car = at least 140 tomorrow
Some day this stock will go up.Companies with low or no earnings are shooting up.Apple with amazing earnings seem to bore people.I don't get it.
Did you buy the dip?!? You had a golden opportunity today!!!
"I used to send a lot of love letters to Tim Cook but, he never responded to them. Not once. I almost sold my 2 shares of AAPL out of anger of being rejected."
Will spike before the March Event
"In the past years, like Snapchat, Facebook and apple company has already begun to increase investment in the field of AR, now AR and VR is ready to scale, the market will be at a 59% compound annual growth rate of growth in the next five years, from $3 billion to more than $28 billion in five years, at the same time, the whole virtual sector revenue will reach $400 billion by 2025."
"what will a apple car cost, will a average people can buy it? in 2025?"
Pre-market weakness on news Warren sold a few shares?50 day moving average is $130+Maybe there the algorithim players if they have not already will pivot then run.Have a nice day
why is apple down so much? i thought this was basically a safe haven.
The selloff is just short term traders selling off AAPL shares to chase reopening garbage. Maybe some forced rebalancing from funds. Whatever. The reopening trade is getting ahead of itself while big profitable tech getting more and more attractive. Buyers will get a clear head soon! Just a blip in the Innovative AAPL story.
"Yo. Apple needs Kias production facilities. It’s not going to be a Kia, it’s going to be an Apple made car in a KIA factory. I also heard they hired some OG porsche designer to lead the design. AAPL proving again that it will always be relevant, whatever industry they choose to enter, they make products better. $500 within 5 years."
"What a joke the stock market has become. Value no longer matters, just hype and momentum."
Blowout Quarter. Apple is a Steamroller. $150 by Friday. Apple gaining market share in China!!!

The problem for anyone who watches the ticker....you’ll get an ulcer going forward as the dred of the last 10 minutes hits where you KNOW it will drop. The only solution to stop the ulcer is sell at 3:50pm and buy it back at 3:59. Do that for the past 7 months and you are a millionaire.

Thoughts on Tim Cook as CEO?
Just added 450 shares at 133. See y'all back in the 140s fam.
so powell will speak and markets will go back up? or down ? which one
I honestly did not expect it to stay strong over $130. 
AAPL partnering with Hyundai/Kia never made sense since there have been major problems with quality and engine fires. I don't see AAPL partnering with GM or Ford as they would be competitors. Buying an existing Electric Start-up makes the most sense.
Game and AMC shorts have to have covered by now...nothing holding up the stocks once shorts have covered....amazing stuff
So RH only allows you to buy one share. How do all you Robin Hood kids feel now. You better prey RH doesn’t go BK. If they do kiss your accounts and money goodbye. So happy I never opened up an account with that gong show platform.$GME $AMC $NIO $PSTH $AAPL $TSLA
"Apple Inc. is one of Berkshire’s top three most-valuable assets, at $120 billion, Buffett said. The technology company has said it intends to repurchase its own shares as well."
Is it possible it goes to zero?
"The rise of Gamestop and AMC Entertainment shows what type of a market we're dealing with. If that stuff isn't gambling then I don't know what is. Those stocks are basically junk and no one should be buying them but they're making some people very rich, at least on paper. That's not investing and those stocks will probably drop rather quickly when whatever game is being played ends. Playing the market like a casino is quite foolish and it's rather dangerous if they're buying on margin. I'll just play it safe with Apple even if it takes longer to make gains."
Look at what happened in September. Much the same sell off and it recovered nicely. Relax. Apple is a strong profitable company with a bright future. That's why you bought aapl stock in the first place.
AAPL breaks out of the handle yesterday and already back tested point of breakout and resumed higher highs and closed green on big volume. Buying dip. Lets see some follow through today. Good Luck
I’ve never seen a final 4 minutes like that in my life. I will tell you. SOMETHING is wrong.
Glad I sold some Apple yesterday. Tired of stagnation. Bought some more TSM

Looks like Timmy's job has been saved...if had gone any lower the board would be looking for a new coach....let's get this fruit back up to the $140's! Everything looks good for this Tech Titan so there was really no reason for it to tank other than rotation but even that made it highly unusual how far down it went....
So what is the open price tomorrow now that the futures are up and climbing. I say up 3 bucks
Have a nice day
"when should I sell, don't like the current trend"
"Remember:1) Buffet still has a lot of stake in Apple.2) he sold some last quarter also and everyone was worried back then too.3) we’ll be fine soon :)4) this should start climbing up sometime mid March and early April (before the next Earnings call)5) it’s a financially stable, profit making company. Go study their balance sheet and you’ll feel better."
Most of the Media (which controls the stock market at the behest of big money) all over the place have already aligned this decline with the DotCom bubble...next three weeks are going to be filled with drinking days.

Maybe Apple should buy Viacom

Don’t sell your golden stock! $170 coming
165-170 friday I’ve been with Apple and this is the best earnings ever from Morgan Stanley
$126 today and $135 2 weeks
And just like that. Go Apple. Own it. Don’t sell it.
aapl will be 200 dollars in 3 months.
aapl needs to start buying and storing physical silver for the future of its business because current prices are a thing of the past as silver moves to its true market value due to the reddit phenomenon.
Every time I've ever tried to times the market I've lost. So I just go back to the three rules of Apple investing: 1) Buy Apple shares 2) Never sell Apple shares no matter what 3) Repeat.
I got in with some call optionsHope us can get back on track

Why do people not understand this is a looooong term stock. Just keep buying on the dips.
When do we see this recovering to the $145 it was last week?
"For a guy holding aapl since 2004 I’m very pleased. I won’t sell until aapl hits 150/shr, then I’ll reach about 6000% gain on most my empl. shares. In the meantime dividends + social security are good enough to live on along with other stock dividends. No complaints, thank you Apple.! And thanks for a lucrative career! Life is Good."
I am planning to hold aapl for years and just started my investment during china xi jp virus. Im not rich I am on a monthly budget. At first sad to see it going down but its actually good bcuz I want to keep my avg price lower while I collect more shares
The manipulators can’t let the AAPL daily chart look too much like a cardiac normal sinus rhythm lest it appear too obvious...
"Very sad to say, stock market will crash for several weeks because of bitcoin hype. Wall Street institutions just have to cut positions in other stocks to buy Bitcoin. Sadly, Apple is the #1 stock so far, and institutions have to pull out some money to buy bitcoin as requested by their clients."
Well it looks like Kia and Apple to build Apple Car in Georgia Plant in 2024.
"Dear Tim Cook....please miss all future earnings so the stock will go up after you report. Even if Apple makes $150B next holiday season, just tell the street that you missed."
I know many people are not buying aapl bec of the number of outstanding stocks they have. Thank god they are doing a stock buy back. Too many shares are out there. Does anyone know how long this process takes?
After split Apple is no longer a growth stock.
"Soon AAPL is going to be very bullish, all of the great news recently, a stellar earnings... all of these things haven’t just been forgotten. It’s on its way, and its close"
"the good news is that the RSI now is 29, the same amount at the end of the March lows. a tradeable bottom will be Tuesday."
Early hours is going to be awful. $4.00 easy down before the bell. After tomorrow down $12-19 dollars. Continues till Friday under 100. My prediction is 60-70 per share by Close of business Friday.
"Google is up over 6 percent after earnings. While AAPL smashed records up down left right last week. The whole GME and AMC fiasco overshadowed our chance to see Apple going over at least $150 a share. I feel we are so short changed. If AAPL announce their earnings today, it will be a different story."
"In conclusion. We long term holders must remember even if this dips on earnings. We have a long term plan stick with it, and let's pray for next week."
IBD was wrong—AAPL neither “pulling back nor melting up.” Why doesn’t someone print the real truth: AAPL is tightly rangebound by being wash traded by big money until they decide to stop...
Who sold last week with weak hands? Chasing is no fun! That’s why you hold Apple 
I will hold for the next 5 years atleast!
talk about evaporating holdings!!! That final couple minutes was unreal!
snagged shares 130
"The millennials need to raise cash in order to buy the airlines and cruise lines and hotels. Where do you think they are getting that money from. They're selling apple. Also, it's very unlikely apple's Q1 will be anything like their Q4...which had tons of tail winds. Think about how many people were buying apple products between holiday shopping and back to school shopping for their kids who are doing online learning. Normally back to school shopping is trips to the gap and jcrew and maybe a new backpack. Instead that money was spent on a new a sweat shirt (who needs to look good when zooming in) and devices for home schooling (iPads, MacBooks, etc). I'm long and welcome this pullback but just find it funny when so so many people can't figure out why the stock pulled back after a huge earnings. It's called buying the rumor and selling the news. Happens all the time. Stocks run up in anticipation of a big print and then pull back after the news. And this specific case...it's going to be hard for apple to match last quarter, further dampening the urgency to buy right now. Apple will still be higher at the end of the year though."
"I currently have 299k in APPL stocks, purchased during the fall of 2011.What do you think the chances are, given a 15 year timeframe, for this to grow to 1 Million ?In 15 years I will be at, or very near, retirement."

So Apple 2022 5.17 eps gives us an after net cash mid 30s PE at a $200 stock price with current business model. Awesome now through in Apple Car and VR/AR.....need I say more?....crazy not to own Apple at these prices....when it’s at 300 in two years you’ll be doing the ole shoulda stuff again lol
Green :)
"Oh my God article in Benzinga by Shanthi Rexaline “why Apple will hit a $3 Trillion market cap by the end of 2021”. Article was dated February 22, 2021"
"just keep buying, you'll be glad you did 20-30 years from now"
Options are lookin ripe... shrt mggts
I’m going to just sit back and pray. That’s all that can save us right now :/ too many people taking profits every time this goes up a dollar or two :/
"apple did this right after splitting back in 2014. if anything, patience will be the key for long term growth. buy now and flourish later"
I’m an long term holder . I do believe appl is over priced . After months of speculation I’m almost certain we hit the correction phase . Enjoy the new highs . Good luck
My largest stake is in AAPL but CHPT & WKHS is Future unfolding and both have massive potential !

I think the last time this stock closed strong on a day...was about 7 months ago.
All I want is for this to stop closing RED.
AH close =$138Open AM = $140
Apple has gone up 100 fold since 2004. All I ask is that it kindly do the same in the next 10 years.
Positive day today and a great short covering
Well not a bad day. Definitely a good start for Monday!! Happy weekend longs!!
"That’s fine. Even if apple goes to $50 a share, I will continue to add."
Gonna be a good day today
"You can’t keep a great stock down—it was only a matter of time. If AAPL ‘has’ been under manipulative pressure for almost 5 months now, those manipulators have either lost control to retail investors, or relinquishing on purpose for the guaranteed capital gain to come"
Every time Apple has a good day the media wants to knock it back down. and call it overvalued....
"These redditors talking about nokia... please, hype only lasts for so long. Quality products and quality companies last for a life time. Tell me one person you see walking around with a Nokia? I’ll keep my iPhone thanks"
Apple announces 1:5 reverse split. Wants to trade at $600 level again where at least it moved up on a weekly basis.
Buying more at opening bell.
buy Apple and hold it. For life.
"Nasdaq composite 13,000 will not hold today. going to 9500 in several months. sell everything, buy gme frenzy only."
I'm loading up the barge Monday morning
Once $OPTI announces a deal with $AAPL I see that alone taking Optec to over $5. With the PPE deal and another plus share buyback plus uplisting to NASDAQ. This is 100% worth over $10 in next couple years.
"The VIX is coiled up set to rocket while the marketindexes have topping formations, this will be epic.The appl bagholder hotline facility will be busy 24/7."
"Motortrend on Apple car project:“what is Apple doing? Becoming a next-gen Tier 1 supplier. It's going to create the electronic guts of the machine—the automotive equivalent of ""Intel Inside,"" which made that software company hugely rich. Apple may be playing four-dimensional chess here, envisioning the vehicle-to-vehicle autonomous communication architecture of 2030 and beyond.”"
Apple oversold like many other stocks imo
It’s gonna trade between $122-$130 until the 3rd or 4th week of March then run up until 1st quarter earnings. It will touch its high of $145 at that time imo
I’m long and have no complaints. Bought in between $107-$$129. We should be thankful we got out of the dreadful $120s. Who else sleeps good at night?
"For some reason Apple stocks is not exciting me anymore,they’re making a lots of money but the stock is down the toilet and now they’re trying to get in to EV vehicles Bad idea."
Bloomberg reported that apple is in talks with lidar sensor suppliers. iCar is one step closer?
BFI at 250 mil MC. think people start to eat out more this year?
FB beat top and bottom and down AH due to increase in expenses outlook. TSLA missed EPS and way down. AAPL should show everyone how it's done.
Last 24 hours nothing but Great news about Apple
Typical hedge fund manipulation on expiration day...but no one says anything about this ..stock drops from 143 to 130 on the great earnings ever and 196 billion in cash...
Is it possible that some of these senators are under heavy medication before they appear on TV? Lol!
I’m guessing investors that did very well with the Tesla run up they would shave some profits and buy Apple  at a discount.
By noon tomorrow Apple will have 5 or 6 new Analyst Upgrades. $200 price targets
Considering the strong move yesterday after hours...today’s drop is extremely disappointing.
This could easily be a $200 stock by end of year. Fundamentals are fine. This will come good
Now we can get on with the $1.9 Stimulus
Whoever read my earlier post!! I was right 
"""""V"" Historical Prices:Dec 29: $138.19Jan 06: $ $126.86Jan 25: $145Today: ?When? : $138+"
Premarket doesn’t mean anything watch when it opens it will be over $125
It a long holiday weekend. I think I’ll have a beer and listen The Climb by Miley Cyrus as I watch AAPL go up into close today. Hope no one holds a short position over the long weekend. I think Tuesday is going to be an outstanding Green Day for AAPL. Good luck all!
"The market was emotionally if not technically overbought and AAPL as the market leader has to lead it down. That said...AAPL makes more money than any company ever so in the longer term I am not terribly concerned but in the short term it may be a bit unfun for a while. When it turns there will be joy again in Mudville but too hard to tell now when that might happen. The overall stock market went way up during a time when the economy lost a lot of ground. That fundamentally did not make sense but that's what happened. I suspect this recent tech selling is a function of that and a regressions to the mean, however painful, is normal and healthy in the long run. GLTA."
the stock went straight down in 3 minutes from 124 to 121 at close. had to be manipulation with someone wanting shares. thoughts?
"Just like Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch… every one of the Apple product in the past made a new technology to be part of human life. This time, when Apple introduces iCar is the time EV officially becomes part of our daily life."
I’ll buy in around 80 we are not to far away when the numbers come out interest rates are rising as usual when democrats are in office gas is up I went to home depo to buy ply would couldn’t believe the price of materials we are looking at a wild ride coming
"Nasdaq way down, excuse for funds to push it lower before great earnings so it can spike big time back to ""only"" $150 tmr."
All Cook has is minuscule dividend rumors. Could care less about small shareholders. Time for someone new. He ain’t Jobs 2.0
Warren sold AAPL but bought VZ which is an AAPL indirect play; isn't it.Maybe he wanted a higher cash dividend?
I am the best.
"The US stock futures started sliding again, renewing today's lows."
Two years $200/share.
this is why EVERYONEDUMPING APPLE NOW no one no one want apple now when you got high flyers like GME KOSS AND AMC AND SO THAT WILL GO UP 50 TO 300 PERCENT ON ANY GIVING DAY
"Did you guys see the new legislation from Chuck Schumer (the Endless Frontiers Act). Legislation to help us better compete with China. He makes specific reference to semi-conductors. This is gonna be GREAT news for the chip equipment companies (LRCX, KLAC, & AMAT). Do your own DD. GLTA."
"Apple needs to step up and address all this EV speculation! They don't have to divulge any specifics, but they do need to let shareholders know what their ambitions are in regards to the EV market. This has gone on long enough, either they're planning on entering the market or they're not. Put this speculation to bed!"
"No Nissan car deal. No Hyundai DealI hold Apple. Great companyI also hold TESLA to play EV. And that’s ok, Apple Doesn’t need to do everything right now. Want a broad tech play.. Apple.Want EV Tesla...Phones and service = AppleElectric/Autonomous Vehicle =TeslaAny questions???"
"To anyone in the industry, Cook is obviously vetting each automaker to see which can protect Apple’s IP the best. Hyundai failed...onto the next"
big red apple
AAPL closed twice this year at $126; Jan 6 and yesterday.This pre-market is a perfect set up for a third?
Breaking 130$ soon...All 271 apple stores opened since pandemic for first time
"apple is like a Cadillac. big, comfortable and slow."
130 130 130 today
I own stock but would never buy their products.
AAPL Will hit $160 by summer. Just need to announce an EV partner.
This stock is finished for a long time. I don't want to sell and pay capital gains but may have to in order to save my investment.
lightest volume ever since the split. also the smallest trading range. this will reverse once the reddit chat room investors stop chasing momentum stocks.
today is ex dividend right ?
"Don’t be put off by a couple of red days!Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit From Apple This is a long term Hold people! Be patient !"
"overreaction today, should see some green tomorrow!"
"Oh good all Markets up. AAPL red. Wait until usual 3:45 sell off. Imagine a down market day, -5 points?"
"Yes, AAPL is manipulated, but those manipulating OWN the stock and will likely never close their position. Remember that when you seem convinced the shareprice is down for the count"
"Thanks Trading with Rayner. I've been watching some of his stuff on youtube to see if I can improve , and today I reasessed my whole risk management thanks to him and got out of that trade just before the end drop"
"You know you have issues if you are offended by a bottle of maple syrup and the label on it reads, “Aunt Jemima”."
Hoping for nice power hour close near green
"This will come right back, when everyone realize a good investment. BTC is down majorly"
"Apple may very well surprise everyone as the late EV entrant that ends up with a truly autonomous, affordable vehicle for the masses that is also highly profitable for Apple. Tesla could end up biting the dust in the end. Question: what is a good price to pay for AAPL and how much is the autonomous business worth ??"
"is it possible that this stock will fall below the 119 level of Tuesday, if so there is no support till below 100>"
"This is so frustrating. Stock futures for tomorrow point to another down day, which means Apple may go further down. I can't believe this, Disney comes out with decent earnings (no where near what Apple achieved) and their stock goes up almost $5.00."
"A iPhone is a computer you carry.An iCar will be a computer that carries you.AAPL will double in value on the iCar.EV, modular, autonomous, micro-factory built, subscription: No huge factories, design/engineering is simple, low capital cost, no more dealers, car salesmen, service departments, used cars, parts departments, finance departments. All that's needed is a brand, some capital, digital communications system and a supply chain.Apple will rule the space."
"buy before too late, no joke. this correction is a great opportunity for future gains and seeing NASDAQ recover more than half it's losses shows promise in the following days."
Did anyone see aapl up over 10 bucks in after hours and then it went back to up 48 cents?
This year I am not buying apple products but stocks. OF course yess yes yes
I’m thinking that at least 30% of all Government Stimulus Checks will go straight to new Apple I-Phone sales........but it could be more. 80% of Americans getting the checks don’t really need them. Used car dealers will do really well. Buy LOTZ. They sell used cars.
Long term investment.. no worries
PT for Friday $129
It has gotten past the 3:30pm demarcation. 3:50pm awaits.
Dow turned positive and Nasdaq is next and Apple too. Just believe in Tim Cooks
I just go on same directions with hedge funds. Shorting all the way down. Pleasure to see how easy you can make money.
I made the mistake of selling after a earnings dip back in 2008. Not doing that again.
"Buffett also says that Berkshire sold a small portion of its AAPL stake at the end of 2020, pocketing $11 billion. Because of Apple’s buybacks, however, which reduce the total number of outstanding shares, Berkshires ownership of AAPL has increased to 5.4% despite that sale:"
Apple appears to be the only tech stock in the Green today !! Money flowing in before blow out earnings report next week.
"This is an Apple gift— just some sectors rotation. All good with Apple and will be for at least the next few years. Best thing to do is buy all you can of it and hold. I held apple for years and only regret is not putting everything i own in it! It has its ups and downs, but just as always it will suddenly turnaround and achieve another all time high. Easiest stock to just park it and count your money later."
"Apple can surge another 25% by adding cryptocurrency services to its Wallet app, RBC says.Yea, I'm in!"
"AAPL is arguably the safest, valuable stock on the market. No need to panic over this."
If we open our eyes we will realize that we keep getting upgrades from different sources and agencies. Stay invested
Analyst all called it where FAANG would all crash after Covid....... As Interest Rates go up these companies will all start to lose money
Apple strong in sea of red
"This is astounding, what other company is reporting $100 billion quarters?? Makes no sense why this stock is down in AH."
CEO...if you can step in and do a buyback or release some new to stop this bleeding that would be great...sincerely yours a long term shareholder.
So am I correct in stating that Hedge Fund people will drive the market down until they can buy in on cheap stocks like AAPL run it up and sell once again. Rinse and repeat.
Undervalued
"90s dot-com bubble is here again...1. Shiller P/E multiples are highest in two decades.2. The VIX averaged 30 last year vs 25 at the height of dot-com bubble. Peak this year of 37 eclipsed high of 33 in 2000.3. S&P market-cap concentration at all-time high makes index-tracking funds vulnerable to swings in just a few companies.4. Bullish stampede of IPOS like dotcom era. In 2020 there were 538 IPOs, including 248 SPACs, themselves a frothy indicator5. Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric: simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product. ""If the ratio approaches 200% as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000 you are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.6. 90% of options buyers lose money. Put/call ratio is seen as a contrarian indicator. Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4 vs 0.39 in March 2000 at the peak of internet stock buying mania.7. Margin debt balances are hitting all-time high of $778 billion 37x the $21 billion in March 2000. Also margin debt to cash in customer accounts is now 72% more debt than cash vs 79% in 2000."
"Higher high’s and higher lows, this is a very good sign!"
"It was just talked about on Bloomberg News, $AAPL + $FSR Rumor? Hmmmmm I'm in."
Apple is a great play long term with a competent Washington administration - something WE don’t have now and WONT have for 4 years!!!
let's break $128. then $135 by Friday
Hubert MS raises Apple $8 to $152 sees basically blowout quarter
Terrific results. Solid quarter and greatly positioned for the future.
"for all those who are wondering why this is happening. the big players have to cover their losses, which they got from what is happening over at gamestop and co. that is why they have to sell the best they have. its actually an opportunity for smaller investors to get apple for a bargain."
we could go to $142 this week folks. keepit yo fingers es crossed and may yo longs reach your destination.
This is why you must be patient
"Both Berkshire Hathaway and ARK Invest have trimmed AAPL shares, may be its growth is stalling?"
"By wash trading enough shares to lock AAPL price below 140 through opex tomorrow, those institutions are violating the Commodity Exchange Act, of 1936."
"These times come and go.IF I wanted to buy now I would not but sell a Jan put for $20+. If stock dips further, you get to buy the stock at anther $20 discount"
"Hyundai Corporation's business fieldsTrading; Ships, Automobiles, Machinery, Plant, Electric & Electronics, Chemicals, Steel & Metal, Coal, and other raw materials etc., Project Organization; Power Plants, Roads, Off-Shore Facilities, and Industrial Plants etc., Resource Development; LNG in Yemen/Oman/Qatar, Coal Mine in Drayton Australia, and 11-2 Gas block in Vietnam etc., Overseas Investment; Qingdao Hyundai Shipbuilding in China, Inti Industrial Complex in Indonesia, #$%$Hyundai Coil Center etc."
"During this pullback, consider a pivot from trading to investing unless you think aapl and other solid stocks will never ever reach their former levels. Don’t forget March 2020 and the millions made by people who understood the market and took advantage of the opportunity."
"Cathie wood sold over 160,000 apple shares this week"
"Just like in March through July I went heavy into purchasing stock. Up 350%. This week purchased so far 2000 shares of apple on top of 1700 I already had. Purchased 3000 RKT on top of1000 I already had and 1500 Wells Fargo on top of 900 already had and 1000 DraftKings on top of 1000 already had. I will continue buying. This is how you make wealth. Buy when everyone is selling. I’m still 200,000 on house money. Even after this week. So my point, weak people keep selling. Can’t thank you enough!"
Looks like 145 today Hopefully 148-149 tomorrow We will be in position for the 170+ Look at NFLX no Cash Flow yet but subs went up to 200 million Stock popAt earnings $72 Apple is going to produce there best earnings ever in history think about that the most I’ve seen Apple jump is $38 + imagine if even that on 150 we would have Friday to finish it off
"Should expect a Strong Rally back above $135+ tomorrow, Load up before too late."
CUP AND HANDLE BREAKOUT...BUY AAPL NOW...HEADING 132 TODAY
The King say kiss your appl money goodbye
"Think ahed people ! Don’t be spooked by the short term recent news! Yeah apples had a couple of down days but the future is bright ! This week record, growing earnings were reported and the future is filled with new technologies and even a Car or 2 Apple stock is going to boom over the coming years so Buy apple, hold Apple and profit from apple!"
All apple us stores are open as of today for the first time since March 2020!
Looks like we will be in the 145-147 range for ER tonight. And I fully expect ER will be blowout with some added extras and tomorrow AAPL opens 160+.
Kia has very high Quality similar to BMW AT 1/2 the price or less
Knowing cook the divi increase will be to .22 from .205. Thanks a lot. The divi needs to be like 3% or 3.75 /4 or .93 cents. They make so much money they need to reward shareholders .82 cents is a joke
"Cook discussing environmental initiatives, recycling, carbon neutrality by 2030 - Discussing privacy initiatives, promoting privacy laws, nationally and internationally"
I don't see how Facebook can have a case. Apple is asking the users if they want to share there data... I am glad Apple give us the option.
I don't like that Buffett is selling 57 million shares each quarter now. he is definitely selling his position.
"today was an important lesson for all.It really speaks volumes how option action rule stock action.It was the option action that drove AAPL to $145 before earnings. But every coin has two sides. Everyone was on the same trade and the markets did what they always do when that happens - went the opposite way to kill the premium.This has happened before. As the board historian I did warn on Tuesday and pre-market on Wednesday.Despite that, WE were wrong. WE apologize"
History teaches us how little people learn from experience. The last year was a global economic disaster yet people dipped into their pockets to purchase Apple products. Think about that. When fear gripped the entire world people opened their wallets and handed Apple their BEST quarter ever. Apple is truly an amazing enterprise .
"Hoping for $150 end of month, $160 end of June. $170 end of September and $190 end of year. Very realistic figures and extremely good return."
"Honest to God feel sorry for those who sold. I think $200 is on our way as soon as July 1, 2021. For the people who sold please get right back in because it will get better and better and it will go higher and higher. Meanwhile I have been buying more and also mutual funds with Apple and or Nvidia as a major holding. The decision is yours not mine though."
every one should be very careful on what you are posting. tim cook reads the comments on weekends.
"Apple silicon will bring Apple to a 10T company. It takes time but just buy and hold. Forget about getting rich quick, btw."
My spidey senses are tingling for at least a 140 close today/tomorrow
I would prefer to see the Dow and Nasdaq move up simultaneously than what we are seeing here
Unbelievable!!I think today’s was very good price to buy AAPL
AAPL hardware in biggest demand in yrs! ...and we are not in common 5G mode YET... Worldwide!
Eccellente day for Apple!
"Didn’t Trump say the Market would crash without him ?Well guess what, he lied again !Big surprise !"
"The Kia no go is GOOD news!!! We want a better choice, I don’t see how this will have any negative impact, only positive!!!"
The best stock for shorting at the moment AAPL. You can not miss. Congrats to all shorties. Must be a pleasure shorting the best company in the world. But you have only $20 more. At $104 big reversal.
"Market deep green, Apple deep red again."
This reversal will send AAPL to 150 breakout tomorrow. Hedgies have to cover soon cuz tomorrow other will buy in mass. Tic toc. I am buying at pullback aside of what I have. I am accumulating every 50 cents
"Message to all the weak hands! APPL is totally manipulated by the big boys, so keep selling your shares and letting the Hedge Funds and shorts scoop them up! That's a real smart thing to do! Yeap, they are taking all the profit you were going make if you just held it for another 30 days! Sorry you miss out. But you can always buy back in at $150.. Cheer's Longs~!"
simple...HOLD...this will correct it self.~B400+ billion in annual sales with 30% revenue growth and 25 %margin...this will be up in 4-5 days...you know this company is a leader and innovators....your money is safe as long as you leave your emotions out of it.they are fundamentally sound.HOLD!!!
"the upcoming move in apple will be so astonishing, that you wished ,you had all your money in this stock. you had 5 months to load up the boat, and every one including myself was complaining every day. life is beautiful."
Apple stock acting the same way like it's products.. Tottaly independent and different from any other company...
The next Shopify and Zoom Combo!VERB!Please do your research!Only 40m shares!GltaFiona
Stop trading apple. Don’t buy it or sell it. Eventually the funds will get the message we are not playing their games. Obvious manipulation taking place.
Reduced my position size overnight to manage risk but I feel good about this momentum.
President Xiden went Michigan today. He needed to drop off a suitcase full of cash to the Wayne County election board of commissioners.
"Steady , up from split , quoting percentages ...... Compared to other ""Big Tech"" this stock is very frustrating !! Only thing I can think of with their Blowout earnings and positive news is ""THEY"" are holding it down for now !!"
"As just posted, new intra day highs follow double digit ""V"" action"
this isn't looking good lads
Picked up more $CCL $DAL and CVS yesterday... today doubling up on $AAPL $VGAC and $CNK... I’m loving the opportunities!! The future is looking ‘wicked’ bright for all of these!! Long and Strong!!
$140 soon
"Ahem! Apple sunk from$145 to $131 during four trading days, that's TWELVE PERCENT market cap that has evaporated, or 400 BILLION DOLLARS in a two trillion dollar company. During normal times this would be panic time, but after the GREATEST QUARTER IN COMPANY HISTORY it's an outrage. Bernie Madoff was secretly named COO, by any chance?"
"I am eager to buy at the opening. 150 breakout is coming before President day . Shopping spree start this week before the holiday. If pulldown , I will buy more to accumulate. Always reserve cash to buy more at any circumstance. If rally since the opening, I will buy more with stop order at 140.05 cuz this puppy is heading 145-150 breakout level"
"@Anonymous silence...we haven't forgotten what you said yesterday. you said ""$120 tomorrow"" so what happened?"
"Big Apple fan. Love the products, money maker, but I’ll admit the stock is a head scratcher. I get that stocks don’t move up big every day. But just released best qtr. of all time. Today Nasdaq up 209 points. Tesla up 4%, FB up 2%, Goog up almost 6% AH, NVDA up 2% and yet, AAPL is up a 1/2% and down AH. It’s getting real old."
"Anyone ever wonder if WSB didn't do the thing with GME?The US markets been tanking since they did their ""thing"", WSB is the only anomaly viable"
Omg....my April calls at $122.5 is shedding value every single day...Man I thought this horse will trade for $150 by March end but I guess it won't even cross $130 by that time! Nkt to mention my June Calls!Any thoughts?
I will be buying some appl today
Big mistake so far selling my ROKU and Pinterest to get more shares of APPLE. Oh well.. good luck everyone
The smart money coming back to apple. Apple is a cash machine
"Good news is AAPL is only a few dollars away from $126.I guess everyone and everything misses ""home"".This year is almost replicating last year's action last Jan.The good news i whenever people start selling high premium puts the ""pivot"" s very near."
I AM losing 500 DOLLARS PER MINUTE :(
Hedgies just taking their revenge since the GME debacle...you wanted a casino of chaos and now we have it...but won’t last forever
Market opened higher Apple is down but the day just started by end of the day it will be sharply higher. Anybody who thinks Apple is not a strong buy must either be from a different planet or a person with no balance and a financial thought process .
"It would be so nice when APPL starts moving in an upwardly trajectory...I've had this stock for about 3 years now, and I don't remember it ""idling"" this long before, especially, after the blockbuster earnings report this last quarter."
"We will be green before close, so predictable; tomorrow and beyond upwards. $200 is so realistic short term."
Boeing loses an engine on one of their planes and their stock goes up. Apple blows out sales and beats revenue over 100 billion and their stock goes down.
"$150 price target, lots of new products to announce. Guys, hold and don't check the price until October."
"Apple shares outstanding history...Take a good look below for those who constantly complain on here that 16.79 Billion outstanding shares are why Apples share price does not increase every day/week.... On 9/26/2015 Apple shares outstanding were 22.32 Billion. Think about how much Apples stock price has increased since 2015. Complain all you want, but stop using the too many outstanding shares argument, it's not valid.... Apple will continue with share buy backs, reducing the number of outstanding shares going forward.

Applied Materials makes equipment which manufacture chips there it is a very important company and a very important indicator. They also mentioned chip shortages. Very very upbeat presentation
all you shorties better cover TODAY 131.50 is the 50 ma. COVER before the pain gets so great.
If your selling because Buffet sold you don't get that his sale was months ago. 3rd Q 0f 2020. For all you know he's buying back in now. Buffet sold the airliners at the very bottom. Do your own DD. Sales happen for many reasons including allocation. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth! Buying opportunity IMO.
Wow Goldman sach was quick to give MSFT and hot upgrade BEFORE earnings mind you solid beat all around for the company round of applause  Now Goldman has been awfully quite about apple and no upgrades after record quarter 
No support before $110 at best
Solid close Friday. Lost $3 in seconds. Will happen again today
Buy buy buy
"i hpold my apple shares and write calls everytime we get to 125, easy fast returns weekly and i still never sell my shares"
"AAPL $TSLA $AMZN (my top 3 fav) all under selling pressure today, but the dip!!!Might want to keep your eyes on ACRX in 2021, with basically a 100% monopoly with U.S. DoD:ARMY, AIR FORCE, NAVY, COAST GUARD... REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Sept. 14, 2020, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals:- DSUVIA now available to all branches of the military- Availability expanded beyond Milestone C approval for Army sets, kits and outfitsACRX Short Interest have been doing everything they can to keep ACRX down... Add ACRX to your ticker watch list!"
Buffet sold WFC in low 20s. That was when i bought WFC stock. I am now up 64% on WFC. He only trimmed AAPL to buy some Pharma stocks but AAPL is still his biggest position anyway.
The weekly and monthly chart on all indexeshave classic topping formations to permita genuine 1-3 year bear market....
AAPL is poised to gap-up on Monday above 150 buy in advance. Smart money knows that...pretending goind down buy AAPL will hit new high...140 at least breakout
"Soon the tide is going to turn and stocks like Apple, Amazon, Tesla are going to be leaders again. So who ever is loading up will be very happy, let me see how many thumbs down I will get? LOL!"
What would be a good entry price?
I think AAPL should partner with Tesla to built the car that everyone will love.
VOlume indicates a rebound
This thing should see it’s high of $145 before April earnings report. Maybe by late this month
If APPLE enters crypto’s market anywhere and AAPL GOES PARABOLIC just on speculative potential aloneX100 if Apple were to “buy”Bitcoin......Long Apple
"N New reports indicate Apple could unveil a bumper earnings report at its call on January 27, possibly making it Apple's first-ever $100 billion quarter.First, from LLD:This three-monthly ritual might grab a few more headlines than normal because analysts expect Apple to generate sales of more than $100 billion a single quarter for the first time in its history. Russ Mould, AJ Bell Investment Director. ""If the consensus forecast of $102.6 billion is attained, that would equate to year-on-year sales growth of 12%, the fastest rate of advance in ten quarters.The report cites Apple's iPhone 12 launch and expected double-digit percentage increases in sales from services, wearables, and accessories"
I hope Apple has been suspending stock buybacks.
The last three times Apple stock had an RSI of 40 it was a turning point in the stock. Current RSI sits at 41.97 as of close friday. The engines are revving.
"Unless you bought APPL 10 years ago, you shouldn't buy it for dividend. It's growth stock. Capital expenditures for EV, health, service infrastructure, etc."
Apple going to be 123 on Monday
"CAPITULATION....ASIA HUGE TONITE. ASDAQ FUTUERS HIGH. EXPECT APPL 145 IN PRE MARKET. TRUTH WILL PREVAIL AND LEAD. EPS, REVENEUS IN Q3, Q4 ARE TRUTH."
"AAPL , AMZN and FB make 15% of SPY. Spy will breakout 400 tomorrow. Shorties will cry again and again. Never defy unicorns with huge earnings.. BUy buy AAPL 200 will happen"
market crash will take a long time to recover
"Like buffet, I placed a large bet on Chevron weeks ago, but Apple is my largest position. Like me therefore, buffet needs both apple and chevron to perform, or his chevron bet is a wash....get it? Apple won’t be long in the mire."
"All big boys are now dumping AAPL, retail Bag-holders will suffer the immense pain all the way below $100."
"With AAPL we have all the time in the world, daily drops mean discount before more new high, learned a lot from decade investors here who testified to hold."
Is it over for Apple?
The perfect car company for Apple to partner with is (drum roll) ............. Tesla! You know it makes the most sense. Musk approached Apple several years ago about buying Tesla. Cook had no interest at that time. Can you imagine how well an Apple/Tesla car would sell! Ufffff. Call it the APPSLA. We are now taking deposits. Hehe 
200 day moving average is at $112....if sell-off continues it could reach this support level.
"Apple is down because Cathie Wood isn't pumping it. If Cathie Wood and Elon Musk joined forces, they could easily move the market to do their bidding with just a few tweets. It's quite amazing how investors will listen to these two people when it comes to stock value. I honestly believe if those two both said to sell Apple, the stock would fall like a rock, although it would eventually recover. How two people have such short-term influence over the market is beyond me. Apple doesn't have enough pumpers standing on the sidelines and spreading the word for Apple. Of course, as long as Apple is buying back shares, I'm OK with that.Apple is doing more than fine in selling products and Services and all their retail stores are still not open.I firmly believe the stock will rise by the end of the year to close in on the $3T mark, about $170 to $180 no matter what is happening now with the stock. I like to joke around about other stocks being better short-term but overall Apple is solid and reliable with relatively low risk involved. Apple isn't the only stock like this but it has been for me. I think it's best just to wait it out and Apple will surely shine at some point this year. Purchase other stocks if you can't wait. There's nothing wrong with that. Just don't complain if you miss the opportunity before Apple rises. I missed out on Tesla like an idiot because I didn't think it could be worth more than all automakers combined. 730% gain? No way! Stupid me. No one to blame but myself.I'm sure Apple will gain at least 40% to 50% this year and that's decent in my book. I'm happy to wait for that even if other stocks do better and there won't be many large caps doing that.Sorry for the long post. It's your choice not to read it."
Top analysts all agree AAPL is way over sold! Apples RSI is between 30-35 which definitely confirms this! I'm loading up to average as the big boys are coming in!
Is the Kia news official? This news came out after closing? Would like to hear from Apple.
I heard rumor that Cathy Wood and Reddit are buying Apple shares.
"Buy tomorrow!! People are gonna have cash and will want to put it somewhere, no better stock than Apple. Over 200 at the end of the year! We will get at least back to $126 tomorrow"
I found an old post dated July 2009 . AAPl was at $6.25 then
"AAPL touching the MA20. Last three times it did this it broke out upwards. Today was the time to buy, tomorrow if you are lucky."
Apple and Lexus sounds about right...
"People selling the word's most successful company with the best products, best innovation and largest cash position on top of that and buying bitcoin? I don't get it--please explain."
"How do you make money?You can buy the stock then pocket 13=% tax deferred cash?Rather than buy the stock here, sell a Jan 22 put for $20. YOU keep the tax deferred cash but may have to buy the stock if if dips but at a 15% discount or keep the cash if it settles here then runs.Algorithim players need no advice. These guys/gals are great."
"so many shorties on this board coming out, they completely forgot about the history of apple and performance after split. hopefully it bites them back"
The P/E needs to drop into the 20s before this stock bottoms out. That’s all there is to it.
"Good Morning. All I have to say today is ""Hope this Goes UP"". Let's see when the other stocks bounce back where Apple rests."
"I am not a big player in any one company but I have been buying/selling for a long time and my feelings on Apple is that it is a stock that is being manipulated. Consider: Apple has said in words and actions that they want a lower prices stock and the performance of the stock over the last 6 months defies all normal market actions and reactions. I am gonna keep watching what I can but I am convinced that there is a balancing act happening. I know that you all wanna believe this and that in future performance but I think its time the small holders of this stock start acting. If the name on this performance was Amazon or Google or just about anything else this stock would be selling at a price over 2 bills. Someone or some thing doesn't want Apple targeted for short term profits. They want long..... period. Before you dismiss me as a crackpot, just think about it and all Apple has achieved in the two previous periods."
"For those of you with time: I bought 500 shares of MCHP in 1993 for $13.00 . It split 7 times since then. Like most people do with stocks, I sold a couple years later for a nice gain.But, if I held onto those shares, my original $6,500 invested would now be worth $2.6 million today."
Ok. Officially frustrated again!
"If you want Apple to give you some love, you have to love it unconditionally by holding it through tough times and good times. Apple will give you a lovely life if you can do that."
"I believe $AAPL is worth $250 + Folks, it’s all free cash flow derived from operating income. It’s not asset sales, it’s not unrealized marked-to-market gains on the balance sheet, it’s not bolt-on acquisitions; it’s a high margin, free-cash-flow-generating machine with exceptional governance.The cash flow statement tells you everything you need to know. Shout out to the folks that appreciate the perfection of the business vs. the appreciation of the share price."
"Hyundai Kia statement regarding discontinued talks doesn't appear to be effecting investors all that much? Apple has never come out and confirmed their EV ambitions, however this news does offer something very positive. Although this announcement postpones a deal with someone, it does confirm that Apple is trying to get into the EV business. Just a matter of time now before investors know for sure where all this is headed!"
just bought 1000 at 120.99.. I feel good about it..
Making huge loses but I know in future I will make huge gains. Patience is the key guys.
Head fake. Should go up after open. Wonder when Apple  will buy stocks? And will it be noticeable in the price jumping?
People are complaining about no guidance. How can you do it with uncertainties? We didn’t provide any guidance last quarter why now? The results would be the same. Beat! Beat! Beat!
Wisdom of crowds: Will AAPL provide positive or negative surprise on next earnings? Please vote with thumbs up or thumbs down. Curious what this group collectively believes.
AAP at 100 will be a 30% hit. AAPL regurlarly drops that much.Wait for sub 100 to buy. I am thinking more like 60-75 due to the current political situation.
Thank God Apple had blowout earnings !!!
Can apple finish green today?
"If you don't have shares in $amc right now get some, Monday is going to start the massive squeeze. Nothing is going to stop it."
"why do you guys think that AAPL should keep going up?!? one of the most widely held positions and those earnings were already baked into the price. just have to look at the upgrades which took place BEFORE earnings vs after them. i've been a widely successful trader for over 25 years, made a small fortune, and AAPL is one way i have amassed that fortune. but they are overbought here, should be trading closer to $120, and are funny enough taking FB down with them as the spat between Cook and Zuckerberg continues."
I haven’t seen one talking head address to collapse into close. That hasn’t been seen since 2008 and no one is even mentioning that 4 minute chart at close???
Put in a day order for $127.75....positive it will fill today.
Gonna be a blood bath in tech today. 20% market drop coming. Keep your power dry so can buy really low.
"I'll ignore this blip. Historically, it's nothing."
"EU markets green af, futures green, nasdaq green, spy green. Guess who will be red.... again!"
"If you sell you lose, if you hold you’ll be alright !"
"Its funny how everyone believes in a company when the price goes up, and when the price goes doen its the worst company ever ? "
"Apple has to have something up their sleeve. Wouldn't you think so? Apple is the most negatively impacted stock in the market, most stocks bounced back nicely today. Great cash and earnings but won't fly. Tim needs to get to he bottom of it and see what's Cooking ! Hope he comes up with something by morning, it would be swell."
Time to buy
"Another way to look at it, no matter what the big4 fund holders of 5 billion shares of AAPL do to its price day to day for their weekly income, they are NOT losing money on it long term, so just ride their wave"
Apple and Microsoft share price appreciated more than 5 times in last 5 years whereas gross revenue increased by 2 to 3 times. It seems stock price still on high side compared to revenue growth. Some correction is expected in near term on fundamentals.
"Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple Long term it will make you rich "
GO back and look at Dec 28 posts. WHen AAPL was $136 it was suggested to sell Jan 22 calls in case this dip did happen again. Now they can be closed out or not.WE were respecting AAPL's nature nothing more with that suggestion
Tim Cook feels so good about the market and where Apple is going short term that he kept the dividend pay out at a whopping .58%%%%%%%%%%%
41% Say They Are Not Willing to Receive a Coronavirus Vaccine
Ouch! Alotta big boys gonna sell their apple to cover the loss from the gamestop squeezeGet ready for another downer...
135 coming this Friday for sure ...
All the more reason for the Reddit crowd to jump on Apple for the blatant manipulation by the hedge fund managers of this stock price. The co blows out earnings and they tank it to shake out weak hands since they probably shorted it at 145. Time to teach them a lesson with the most widely owned stock on the planet
Apple is headed to $400 by December 2021. The futures are up sharply. They will be up even more sharply same time tomorrow
If we go green that will be something.
"Apple is still the future, a few bad weeks does not change that"
Apple best company on market will exceed 200 in no time this bubble is real and it’s not because of stocks like amazon or Facebook or Apple it’s because of the small cap stocks that people are making into mid caps that don’t post any number that come even close to being worth it
Gas prices $5.00 by June or $4.00 by June ... who’s betting? Love the key stone pipe line choke and squeeze
"I can sell and it will immediately jum 6%. I'm ready to sacrifice my gains for you. But when it will jump, I will buy again and it will drop 15%"
My primary portfolio made $79K for the week. My Amazon & Apple shares woke up from their 5-months hibernation and started shouldering the load of my portfolio and gave my Tesla shares a chance to rest.
no jobs = no buying $1000 phones
"Still trying to establish a bottom after Buffett reduced his stake by 6%. Looks like it's getting close. At the end of the day, this is still the company that blew out Q4 sales and earnings, tested new highs less than a month ago, and has a big 5G year ahead of it with a chip technology that is all the rave."
"It is announced today that Apple’s hardware engineering chief will step down to oversee a “NEW PROJECT”, he will report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Bringing his successful formula from the iPhone and iPad to a NEW APPLE PROJECT is a good thing."
"I'll take the temporary hit , but I'm not selling my tech for the whopping 1.4% yield on the 10 year !!!!!"
"Now that the hedge funds got all their options covered, can we please have control of our stock again?"
"Power hour folks, let’s close green!"
Maybe AAPL can start selling their chips to auto manufacturers since there’s such a chip shortage.
In five years when we're looking at 300 most of the noisemakers will be long gone...no pun intended. I've bought and sold stocks for 45 years and AAPL is one core holding I won't trade. It's a legacy stock for the grandchildren.
there is no crash coming. semiconductor stocks and banks are still looking strong.
apple product is loved by young people. apple stock is loved by old people.
"Funny true story my uncle 83 yrs old calls me last week. He knows I day trade stock and tells me my aunt 82 yrs had her dad gave her some apple stock back in the that he bought for like 20 or 30 cents. He said thought it was like 100 or 200 shares. He asked me if I thought it was worth much. I said uncle get off the phone and call your financial advisor you might be in for surprise. Calls me yesterday said the FA said they 7,430 shares of apple at over 1 million. Tells me well that seemed to be a good investment. I almost died. Crazy"
what happened to AAPL??????
"1000 dollars to invest in Apple or Tesla. Which goes up more in one year? Thumbs up for Apple, thumbs down for Tesla."
"Apple sold a bunch of bonds yesterday, taking advantage of low rates. The proceeds will probably be used to buy the stock. AAPL is an incredible engine for price gains if you're a long-term investor. It has lots of work to do to continue the miraculous growth. Services have to be big. Apple Pay and TV need to get moving. I'm not sure where AAPL is on a car, but I think something big is coming. Although the price is getting very high, I'm banking on Cook and Company to keep new products and innovation coming."
"May be a good AAPL day. We are overdue for a nice up day. Often, a little premarket red ends in a green day! Good luck all!"
We were supposed to be at 150+ with all those events and revenue profits ...I’m sure atleast 135 is possible this Friday ...next week 140 should be great ...
138 On Apple car news.
hopefully apple and tesla will shine and pull the market out of this tailspin. if all the earnings AH are great then the dow will be up 500 tomorrow.
"As expected, slack in Verizon subs was picked up by TMobile, which added more subs than its rivals and handily outgrew the broader wireless industry. TMUS reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter Thursday evening, and had pre-announced strong subscriber results in early January."
Joe good plan to open borders to spread more virus as we stay locked down and we can go even more broke in the middle of a pandemic that you promised to shut down by paying for their vaccine and giving it to them first.
"The big drop on friday was the fault of kathie wood, she just sold her apple shares. I am not afraid apple will still be the future"
"Earlier this week algorithim play from $118 to $126+ paid off 500 to 800%.This is ""making lemonade out of lemons!"""
$137 closing target for today. This scam is strong.
Some people are saying the futures are green. I read the market sank. I’m hoping it recovered. GO AAPL.
Watch aapl is going to close at 0.01% green that way they can mark a green day :P
I’ve been invested long enough in Apple to see a $10 gain in one day
Some good news and this will rise. Hold long and strong. A great company for these times
Today Nasq will be upAAPL will close over $145 tomorrow $148 if we can get to $149-150 we are in position for a pop bestEver earnings this will move $167-175 +

Ok down to 122 from 145 or about 16%. Broke the split support at 125. I think they will push it down 20% now to test 116-118 again where it consolidated after the split.
Ready to buy the intra-day dip... reopening all the mac stores and new high storage iphones are real news and game changer. Good Luck
"Hopefully the market / investors are not banking on results of retail sales, if so, is Apple a flawed investment?"
"Selling shares in the company with the most money, the most patents, the most innovation in the pipeline is in one word nuts. Don’t listen to any sell advice here—they’re daytrading gamblers, trying to prop their own ulterior nearsighted losing strategy."
I don't know if this is the place to say this. I'm just trying to help people. The stock market is in what is called a hyperinflation bubble. I remember this is 2001 and 2008. Back then people or our country did not have as much debt. Our country is in debt $30 trillion dollars.. The average person in in debt 70K (billionaires included meaning 99% of the country have a personal debt over of 100k). It is not sustainable. There will be thousands of new millionaires but hundreds of thousands left bankrupt. I sold all stocks etc. They will print more money but the value will keep going down. I still own a lot of real estate. I think it will go up once the market crashes because: Where else would you put your money? Any thoughts?
"There is a disconnect now that all industrial, banks and energy stocks went up way more than pre pandemic level. Dow is all time high while Nasdaq is 1000 points down. Guess what? We are looking 400/500 points up Nasdaq any day. Institutions chasing you into the so-called value stocks and they will dump in the nick of time. They will be back to growth of tech....that’s the truth...I am holding all my tech holding...you should too"
"Lesson for future.The volume falling everyday was the indicator this was going to happen.Once again, WE are surprised as everyone but this is what momentum does; pivots on a dime and trades in a ""V"" pattern"

Apple/Kia will undercut the Tesla in price. A car for the masses. Almost every Apple sale comes out of Tesla’s hide. . ‘Bout time Musk is taken down a peg hehe .
Hmmm. Futures looking bad. But then again - apple doesn’t really depends on the futures anymore
did anybody else buy calls before closing yesterday?
Should I buy now ?
Yesterday’s losses will be recovered today. I know it can be very frustrating to roller coaster what seems almost on a daily basis but for those investors who are patient notice that slowly but surely AAPL is showing gains and will in the long run pay off handsomely.
"Bond yield rising signals Inflation is rising dramatically while our economy has not picked up much strength at all. If this keeps going on, we will run into the worst case scenario- Stagflation like 1929."

Massive buy 150 soon
Baidu went from 120 to 346 in 2 months bc of a electric vehicle announcement.
"In less than 1 month, $348 B evaporated"
apple definitely going back to 135+ soon. people worry about Warren buffet sold some shares but if you really know him he never trims shares when he has negative view on a company he sells all. what he did in Q4 was simplying rebalancing. no need to panic.
"Great time to buy some AAPL on the dip in my opinion. Had a great last earnings report, and the average price target shows a lot of upside from here. Good luck all!"

"Humans have been on the planet for 200,000 years.It took until the year 1800 for the global population to reach 1 Billion people.In just 220 years after 1800, the global population is at 8 Billion....or an 8x increase.The global population has doubled , as recently as 1974, from 4 Billion to 8 Billion.I'm thinking it doubles again in maybe 20 years (??)...from 8 Billion to 16 Billion.Apple recently reported that there are 1.6 Billion active users of Apple products...that's 17% of the global population.If you think Apple is done growing, I think you're mistaken.Last quarter, Apple saw an increase of 30% in Japan and 50% increase in China.I think Apple is just getting started."
Another red day. See you all tomorrow!
Apple is the king. When Apple wants privacy they get privacy 
"great earnings, blowout quarter, good news about icar with kia and still it goes down. mms want cheap shares before it explodes higher. you cant have a weak stomach when owning this stock however it always makes money for its investors you just have to buy and hold and be rewarded"
"The Apple return from 2010-2020 was amazing. However, in order realize the gains like I have, you have to have patience. Can you imagine if I had sold in 2013, 2015 and 2018 because I did not enjoy my annuals gains? Imagine if you were a new stock holder and had purchased stock in these years and sold in that same year. You would have lost out on 2014, 2017, 2019 and 2020 huge gains. The key is to buy great companies when like Apple and be patient. Stocks do not go straight to the moon!

Tomorrow will be the massive sell off, then is time for buy, under 125$, the best I think 119-120. Otherwise you will hold the bag for a while."
Joey's recession is here. He's gonna make Jimmy Carter look like an economic genius.
Make no mistake FED is buyer and seller of last resort....unlimited counterFIAT in complete control against honest money earned buy the citizens/we the people
you guys think APPL will beat on earnings tonight???
Bad week ahead...
"As an employee at AAPL, we get to use up to 10% of our base salary to buy company shares at 15% discount of price since July 2020. That is a approximately 50% gains ;)"
How low will this go! All they talk about is how overvalued all the technology stocks are
Let’s do 140 USD in the pre market folks!
"Personally, I’m not too thrilled about Apple going in the car business. Historically automobile manufacturing is very low profit. I hope Apple knows what they’re getting into."
It was a painful feeling hearing price targets increase as the price falls.
Looking like a red day
"Possible names for Apple cars include, Red Delicious, Gala, Honeycrisp, Golden Delicious, Pink Lady, CandyCrisp, Earligold, Empire, Enterprise, Evercrisp, Goldrush, Ginger Gold, Jazz, Jubilee, Liberty, Melrose, Opal, Rome, RubyFrost, Snowsweet, Straberry, Sundance, SweeTango."
To anyone who’s recently invested in this stock: don’t worry!! Don’t look at the market everyday. Apple is not supposed to rally every single day!! This was a bad month!! Hopefully March will be better :)
i am scared
Just like there are sell off there will also be a rally at some point as well this is quite normal.Especially if the company fundamentals are this great.
So how much will our dividend go up? Longs only please
"Apple’s sinister plan is working—cause a massive chip shortage in the auto supply chain, then release their M1 chip for autos as only alternative, forcing Apple’s ubiquity across the auto industry"
"Taking a look at the recent wedge formed on the 1 year, its very possible apple will be north of 145 within two weeks"
And who got that vaccine fast tracked Joe by cutting all the government red tape ?
"Day traders giving stocks a short boost, they will tank again after Powell speech.$TSLA $NIO $BNGO $IDEX $OCGN $VXRT $AAPL"
Maybe today is beginning of payoff from great earnings. Patience is a virtue.
Hmm. So I checked and some institutions have started to buy back today. I also saw some buying yesterday but it wasn’t a mix of institutions buying and selling. Hopefully this should go up later next week :)
I own stock in one of the biggest most profitable companies in the world. Not worried.
Apple is getting annoying. I know I know Apple is a retirement stock and undoubtedly will continue to rise but its crazy they can report the best quarter is the history of the company and lose $20/share on the SP
126 tomorrow-> 135 Friday ...load it tomorrow! Last and final chance ...
Hopium and prayers is not a strategy
"Who says money doesn't grow on trees? My Apple ""tree"" has generated a considerable amount of wealth for me since 2006 and it continues to do so. I also planted a Tesla tree in my yard in 2013 and that one started to bear alot of fruit last year as well...!"
Ok so now all big tech reported short term trading is over now back to the trend higher
The lower it goes the more I accumulate. It’s that simple.
"I have been trading for the past 8 months, started with 12k as it's all I have to be dedicated to the stock market. Went up to 18k, and decided on Monday to sell my first put on APPL exp 2-19 strike price to 131$, collecting 65$ premium.My goal was to have a blue chip stock in my portfolio to generate passive income by selling weekly calls 2-3$ above my buying, in this case 131 so I would sell weekly calls at ~133$.I am surprised how it went so fast below 130 but hell, if I am scared of APPL going to 0 is better to quit this gig and just focus at the 9-5 slavery job.Since most likely I will be assigned the 100 shares at 131 the plan is to hold them as long as possible and sell covered calls as I mentioned above.Does anyone have any hint or recommendation for me at this point? Thank you!"
Good chance we go green today. Everyone knows apples  the king!
This is merely hedge fund retribution on retail guy for the massive losses they suffered from Reddit boys on GME. It’s basically “I see your move...now take this”.

"The hedge funs and shorts are trying every thing to keep us away from apple with negative news. We should squeezy the heck out of them on this, Apple has the tail wind to fly to $2500 easy and it is dirt cheap now."
Stimulus passed in congress market up next week......
Doesn’t the dividend come in to play next week on the 11th. That should be about 23 shares for me I think￼. 
Maybe if the market goes down this will go up? Sellers have some pity and hold out for a higher price.
We need more short interest—please buy puts so institutions allow AAPL shareprice to go up
"after careful due diligence analysis, I am reducing my year end price target from 201.45 to 132.76 . apple is doing nothing wrong. the market conditions have changed. good luck on your investments."
Picked of 50 additional cheap shares. Didn’t get near the daily low but I’m happy
Listen carefully....THIS is what happens when your stock does NOT take advantage of rising markets. Textbook. Now it gets trashed further on the way down. It is imperative to “make hay” on green markets.
Tried everything they could to drop it afterhours tomorrows low 934 am than the shorts cover and AApl finishes day at 145 upgrades galore
Remember that Apple is just 3 months into a 2 year SuperCycle. $200 is not out of the question in 2021.
Future is green across the board. Bloomberg reports. Future is bright for investors and economy.
"Apple sold $14 billion in corporate bonds. Some of that will be used to buyback shares. Probably a dividend increase as well. If they think this thing goes higher, I’m gonna believe it"
Apple does not need 200B cash....not that they are doing acquisitions left and right! Do 100B buyback now and $2 dividend per year. Plain and simple
None of these downward moves will matter in 10 years. long and strong baby.
Tim Cook please help the investors! you are letting this ship sink!￼￼
Shorts out in full force today. Here’s one ....

apple to close today over 130!
"Haaaaa. Wait until Tim Cook starts talking about 4th quarter sales , then guidance. You haven’t seen nothing yet!"
Mark Cuban is trying to make sense of something that makes no sense at all. He also thinks he is smarter than every else.
v-shape recovery???
Apple stock will be flat until at least the earnings and maybe longer.

Buy  because at this discount price and Apple CEO Tim Cook will have much success finding partnerships on Apple car deals.
"Every coin has two sides. While the Da Vinci Strategy put a 15% tax deferred cash dividend in your pockets it has put pressure on the stock price upward momentum. Watch the open interest everyday to see if investors are closing or selling.If you sold a Jan 22 covered call at the time you bought the stock is the recap:Jan 22... Dec 28.... Feb 19.... Change $135.... $21.70.... $15.40.... $6.20$140.... $19.51,,,,, $13.70,,,, $5.80$145.... $17.45.... $12.05,,,, $5.40$150,,,, $15.70,,,, $10.60,,,, $5.10Stock hit $138.19 then closed at $136 on Dec 29th then ran to $145, so these calls were much higher when they were sold. I watch thee everyday. Until recently, the Jan 22 call had a 15% premium to market pirce. Now that is 13% But also the price change was too.IF Da Vinci Strategy was used when stock was bought, the price change was offset mostly by the profit on sale of the calls.For example: When the stock was $145 the Jan 22 $145 calls sold for $22. So the Investor who sold these is hedged down to $145 - A$22 = $123. AAPL has bounced off of $136 to $128 five times"
"Disastrous February for Apple, I hope with March comes renewed positive growth and the LONG wait was well worth it. Cheers to spring and AAPL."
Sell on any pop. Apple is in deep trouble. if you don't sell now pretty soon you won't have anything left to sell.
The options casino is responsible for today’s Red !
Apple will closed at$133.00 today because strong volume with o/I price range $131-$133.00.
I keeping telling you guys sell and then sell again
Yawn....Buying more
"Volume tells a tale.

Guys i want to remind you of something. Do you remember when was a changes of institutional ownership? It was around $117 last year. Hedge funds will short this to $119. We cannot win this. Just give them what they want and then we go back.
From this point just only Green and UP !! Need 150 as we all fraking deserve it ...
"1 billion iPhones in use. Even if Apple can get $1 a month from each one, that is $12b on services in a year alone, a very high profit margin business. What happens when that average revenue per user goes up? Or we reach 2 billion iPhones in use? Sleeping Giant!"
I recently sold a condo and put the entire $190k in appl at $128.80. 1475 shares. I guess my taxes will be covered for the sale by next year. Life is good

"Eod 124,eow 119."
You guys are frustrated because u see Robinhood bubble stocks(nio/Tesla/pot stocks) etc making big bubble gains but Apple will not be doing that. Apple is not nor will it ever be a bubble stock. It trades as it should alongside earnings. Sure it has an iCar in the works so why isn’t it skyrocketing like Tesla or nio etc because those bubbles are driven by emotional Robinhood gamblers. The stock market is not a get rich quick anything. Apple by its very nature will not bubble up like these other “stonks” or whatever those bubble players call them.
"Just talked to Mr Sidwell at Goldman Sachs. He said they have put huge buy orders for AAPL in the morning from the money they made at AMC. This is how they make their portfolio less volatile. Also, he said that there are no signs of a correction this is just a regular day at the end of Jan. They are re-investing their profits from AMC into Apple and Starbucks in the % ratio of 70 and 30 each. So, congratulations to those who held on today."
Monday we open up $3 but really it’s even because of that last 10 min bs!!!
"I'm a long term holder here....and I'm holding long into the future yet for these reasons:1. Best tech brand2. China trade war easing. Apple gonna pick up more momentum there.3. India just getting started4. 5g just getting started5. Apple has all the tech we're using daily in our lives (phones, laptops, earphones, etc.) It's essential.6. Increasing dividend. Every single year.7. Stock buybacks8. New products to come (EV, AR/VR headset, services)9. Apple finding ways to lower costs (M1 chips, production in Vietnam, etc.)10. Apple values privacy...and the world is waking up to privacy being important because we all know that the likes of FB and TWTR and even Google abuse your data."
don't know why it kept going up every day anyway
In all my years of trading the performance of APPLE after a stellar earnings report is truly baffling. I still believe that either this afternoon or tomorrow AAPL will again get on track to perform as investors had hoped.
Anything 120 or under was a gift.
No last minute selloff today. The trend has reversed itself and should have some legs from here
"Been a pleasure all , I loved communicating but I am moving my portfolio to AMC . only keeping 5% Apple. big Squeeze coming soon . on sale for $8.90"
Today was a reward for patience.
Apple MM's need to stop attacking the call options and focus on taking it further ...Its been weeks now we are stuck and this kind of trend will impact new and long term customers as well ...As people get frustrated every day !
Thank you!!! Go Apple !
AAPL's very high forward earnings multiple and growth rate unfortunately is not sustainable.....Cash in your chips and move on to more undervalued names. Good luck to all.
MDI rep clued me into this stock at .79. as a 74-yr old day trader i was in and out many times early on. Not any more. This and $AAPL are my only sacrosanct holds. Glad to be along for the ride. Reminds me a little of $MRNA over the past 8 months.
Melvin capital selling 2.5 billion in shares to cover loss in short positions
Apple car is real. Let’s go to $1000
"What do I mean by algorithim play?When a stock is taken down and one thinks it will pivot, these "" Algorithim players"" sell high premium puts and buy cheap calls. This is NOT for the inexperienced. I only mention this to educate everyone what is happening.Puts loose the value by 50 to 90% while the calls run 50% to sometimes as high as 1000% based on the move.These plays are best done on Friday because the weekly options have lost most of their premium with eight hours left. Yesterday that $3.50 dip at close was a see-saw effect based on this with only minutes until 1600 hrs.Last year there was a 1800% play from Feb 23 to March 26. This year there was a 1000% play here in Jan, Two moves in this time frame.Maybe next year? I do not know"
For the love of Pete....relax dudes! IT's APPLE.
Just could not stop myself. Had to buy more Apple Tesla Bitcoin and DogeCoin. Great day for Apple coming.
GOOD time to buy
Looks like Apple will creep up form here. Dow is almost green. We might have a Green Day all around.
I don't understand who shorts Apple I owen it for last 19 years and financially I'm retired and I'm sure for younger investors if they willing to wait longterm they will have the same luck God bless Apple stock
as soon as jerome powell says interest rates won’t go up anytime soon like he said not long ago market will fly
buying the dips!!!!!!
"It’s options Friday, that y Apple is down, and in the long run Apple will go up, as lot of analysts have upgraded their price target for Apple after the earning reports."
AAPL recent trading action is a classic example of stealth distribution. This is textbook. It is becoming clearer that the historic all-time top was indeed hit over 140 and will be going downhill from here.
"analyst upgrade, downgrade, hype articles- nothing can prop up aapl shares. Funds accumulated billions of shares and a 1% reduction of 170 mil shares is worth 2 days havoc on prices. This will continue until Apple work toward buyback and reduce the count. I dont think split was a good idea. Apple shares are too many and too readily available which is why its stuck and keeps going down even on green days. sad but true..."
"It’s all a rigged market, folks. Take from the little guy and give it to the big guy."
"WE did post ""Field is in the hands of investors""Yesterday and today's action is very healthy. It was a long week for the traders last week. They needed to ""wet their beak"""
hahahahahahaha sell sell sell sell
apple to the moon

"$1000 iPhone, im this economy people will buy cheaper phones"
Has anyone looked ahead to 2nd and 3rd quarter earnings? I bet they do just as well as the 1st.
Long term hodlers do not be scared of this noise in the market. Sit back and enjoy 12000% for 20 years
"At a forward PE of 31, Apple is trading above its historical PE of around 24. Don’t think that doesn’t matter because it does matter. That’s why it’s trading sideways lately. I’m patient so I’m not worried"
Dow turned positive. Next S&P and then NASDAQ. Yes siri bob yes yes yes. I just bought more of apple. Thanko
Spin the action how you want...stock has done what no long predicted. Down about $16 from earnings. Not good.
"I’m getting the sneaking suspicion that all these dips (on no news) are scripted and staged...by funds that hold over 30% of AAPL and the rest of the market—Vanguard, Blackrock, Berkshire, and State Street. The success of the little investor depends on their guts and stamina. GLTA"
AAPL will be green monday morning. Just face it! :)
"I sold 1700 shares at 123. of course should of held on for a few more hours. I'm hoping to buy back at around 115I got tired of down every day down -2.15, - 3.02, -1.89......and so on . Then 1 up day .16 cents. So I bailed out only to get back in at a much cheaper price. My opinion this will fall to 110-115 before the rocket ride which I will be on."
Warren Buffet and Vanguard trimmed their positions in Apple but are still the biggest holders of the stock.
"Be patient. Reality will again set in. Cruise liners are acting like they are back in full swing but in reality they are suspended in the US indefinitely. The reopening trade has stocks like RCL, MAR, ALK and AAL running up like we have forgotten they were just asking for government funding to survive a few months ago. Throw out AAPL and MSFT as they have crushed earnings and are rich with cash. The pigeons will soon come home to roost!"
apple is not going anywhere and today is the only chance for this gold stock .. i added 4k and my average is 110$.. we gonna win
"I think Apple should buy GE for $23 per share. Keep Medical, Renewable Energy and Digital......and spin off the rest. Apple would make $100 Billion."
the market magically floats back up. so just learn to buy when it goes down. nothing to do with earnings.
Texas is about to spend $85 Billion rebuilding their Electric Grid. Prime beneficiary?...GE.
"You people need to relax. Apple makes big runs up and down. Before the 4 for 1 split, they were 42 point runs......up and down. Sometimes back to back. You can set your watch with these runs. Now they are 10 point runs. Apple has now gone from $140 to $120. That’s back to back down runs. Apple is in a buy zone now......but if somehow you get the extremely rare triple run......down to $110, then buy hand over fist and ride the 30 run that will follow. Apple is not hard if you follow the big runs. Apple makes big runs."
So this stock has lost about -15% of its value in the last week or so
"Apple stores theory: they are opening up stores inside of target. They already have a presence in Best Buy. During covid/shutdowns apple realized people have no problem ordering online. So... why have all the extra expenses of physical locations and employee salaries? Keep the online sales going, and just have pop up shops in target/best buy. This means more profit which means better stock prices/dividends for us"
"Good afternoon, I look forward to pumping liquidity - there will be growth preceding the split"

"This joint venture is so synergistic in many ways. Speeds the manufacturing ramp up that has plagued Tesla, allows Kia and Apple to build on each other’s significant battery technology, capital funding won’t be an issue like Tesla has had, logistics of “software” and “hardware” design, engineering and integration will be concentrated in USA, a sales and service international network already exists, both brands have loyalists worldwide, etc."
"Markets are going down. Jerome Powell might as well go home and shovel snow out of the driveway, the Federal Reserve is creating a nuclear bomb of inflation. The White House Economic Chaos Team needs to make those stimulus checks out for $10k just to cover the food and gas price increases coming."
We’re balling tomorrow son.
Ouch... Up $3.00 after hours. That sure caused the shorts to come out in record numbers to bash Apple on the forum. Do they really think they can change a few people minds To sell? Your posts here will have NO effect on Apple stock price. You would be better off laying in bed and praying for a price drop tomorrow....
Tomorrow might be another blood bath!! But stay strong my fellow friends!! It might take a few weeks to see $140s. On the bright side - we’re just 10 dollars away!
"Well, it’s done for the next 6 months. Will take a LONG time just to get back to $140. Awful situation."
At greg this stock isn’t tesla. Did you ever go to the tractor pulls? They just pull n pull with a steady momentum. Apple just keeps pulling slow n steady to finish line. Yr after yr. its a trustworthy stock thats relatively safe that you can hand down to your kids or grandkids n still have some for yourself.

Be patient my friend."
Who is in the right mind think AAPL will go down with robust earning. It should be flying right now. I will hold until it splits again. I never worry about aapl. I am hoping to go down more so i could load
Financial analyst expect Apple to earn .98 cent per share on next qtr . earning report in May. Apple will definitely blow past this consensus. LONG Apple and load up the truck.
