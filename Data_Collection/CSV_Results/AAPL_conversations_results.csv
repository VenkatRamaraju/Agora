my realistic outlook on apple heading into earnings week i think it will go up but not as high as some claim yes this is the first earnings report since iphone launch as well as the launch of the new imacs watches ipads and all the accessories for those products now a big part of revenue that plays a factor here is the stores which have not been open for quite some time they’ve simply relied on their own website partnered companies such as bestbuy and the cellular companies i don’t think 175200 per share will happen i expect similar progress as netflix a 16 increase which puts at 150ish especially when taking in these factors 100 billion report come wednesday is no impossible but i think it’s a overreaction i think it will be close though
i think netflix set the tone of the market for at least one year if not years to come excellent results from netflix and there is a vast expansion of the application and use of technology including and specially the semiconductor sector of which we cannot even dream of let alone think cars are now not only mechanical but also electronic since i am ancient and old i never thought i will see this age of technology my advise stay fully invested forever and watch your investments grow through leap and bounds
if this is an indication how ws is behaving prior to earnings just wait and see how they’ll react when apple announces the icar
holding strong 
consolidation period is officially over time for lift off
tomorrow premarket itself it will be pumped high 135 or 1345 and then 137 likely possible friday again options day so can’t expect much so technically they baked in 50 of the hike before earnings 
you can’t keep a great stock down—it was only a matter of time if aapl ‘has’ been under manipulative pressure for almost 5 months now those manipulators have either lost control to retail investors or relinquishing on purpose for the guaranteed capital gain to come
never trade apple 
with earnings about a week away i just wanted to share some thoughtsfirstly about analyst expectations folks if apple reports massive revenue its great for us dont get me wrong but some analysts calling for 100 billion or more in revenue thats kind of unrealistic its almost like theyre setting up apple to fail what if apple only reports 85 to 90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price and lets not forget apple did not provide guidance for this quarter so expectations are too unrealistic were still in the middle of a pandemic were not out of the woods yet if apple can perform as good as they did last year id be satisfied but if they do even better then that then id be very pleased secondly i believe the selling is way overdone we should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements the stock held onto the support level very well technically so i believe the stock has a lot more room to run theres so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth the continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long runthird i mentioned this in the past but i dont believe apple will comment about project titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers so dont expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on i know many are eagerly waiting for this but stillfourth when earnings are announced pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that arent being focused on as much like apple fitness i believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future definitely not priced in at this current priceown it dont trade it apple long
my primary portfolio made 79k for the week my amazon  apple shares woke up from their 5months hibernation and started shouldering the load of my portfolio and gave my tesla shares a chance to rest
