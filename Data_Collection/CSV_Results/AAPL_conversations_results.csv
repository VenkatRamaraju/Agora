Recent headlines and conversations for AAPL
"As expected, slack in Verizon subs was picked up by TMobile, which added more subs than its rivals and handily outgrew the broader wireless industry. TMUS reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter Thursday evening, and had pre-announced strong subscriber results in early January."
"RSI is almost 75. Support is around 126. Its about time institutions set the hook and reel this baby back in to the 120's, maybe lower."
BlackBerry was my favorite brand. I bought a BlackBerry priv 2 years ago and this is the worst phone i ever have. I hope BlackBerry gonna be a good canadian brand like it was in the past and not become a cheap brand like $aapl .

Apple Supplier Foxconn To Build $270 Million Plant In Vietnam Amid U.S.-China Tensionshttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2021/01/22/apple-supplier-foxconn-to-build-270-million-plant-in-vietnam-amid-us-china-tensions/
"BofA’s flow data showed on Friday, that when hedgies sold Apple to cover their shorts, big money was buying. Deep-pocketed investors pumped a record $4.2 billion into big technology stocks last week, especially AAPL, taking advantage of the slight pullback."
Dips after every earnings release then with in a week always makes new high check the quarterly pattern on long term chart if you don't believe me.
"A new stimulus plan will be revealed this evening Thursday Jan 14th possibly after hours. I'd say the market rallies tomorrow or end of the day today. Either way, skies are looking GREEN. Apple long! Own it don't trade it."
Great results...$150 soon
Apple/Genesis quality will turn some heads. Tesla quality control vs Genesis = Jag vs Lexus.
It’ll be a great quarter even though expectations are high
Market is overreacting to tepid news from the Fed. Down 2%. We're down 1%. Don't panic. This too shall pass.
"Don’t panic people ! Be positive, accumulate and hold ! You’ll regret if you don’t Buy apple, hold apple, profit from apple People power can squeeze out the shorts"
"Once reality sets in, people will flock to get more Apple shares. Everything is funky right now but make no doubt, Apple is a cash machine! Like money in the bank."
"Really? That was the big announcement? Don’t get me wrong, but I expected something more relevant for the company..."
"This chart on Apple is like $2 away from a complete technical breakout. The old closing high is $134 and change. When you review charts over 40 years for any technical breakouts, they tend to do a 15-30% move after the breakout. It may be a good time to hold on and not trade it daily."
I wish this stock could gain like it looses
"Apple's iPhone 12 sales exceed Wedbush's 'bull case scenario,' expected to boost stockSales of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 12 have exceeded Wedbush's ""bull case scenario"" for fiscal 2021, based on Asia supply chain checks, and should boost shares with December results coming shortly, analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Thursday. ""We believe Apple saw a robust Christmas/holiday season not just on iPhones, but also had a strong AirPods performance that will be another product tailwind heading into 2021 for Cook & Co,"" Ives wrote. Asia checks suggest the supply chain is expecting low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds for the quarter, comfortably ahead of the 80 million to mid 80s range expected in mid December, 75 million expected in late October and 65 million to 70 million range expected three months ago, he wrote. ""This is roughly a 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts. For the March quarter we believe builds for total iPhones ticked up again another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60 million to 70 million range. For the June quarter we believe initial builds are in the low 40 million range with potentially an upward bias. We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis,"" said Ives. The Wall Street consensus is for 217 million iPhone unit sales in fiscal 2021, but Wedbush sees potential for up to 240 million units, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in FY15. Importantly, with our estimation that 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, we believe this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for Cook & Co.,"" said Ives. Wedbush rates Apple as outperform with a $160 12-month price target and a bull case target of $200. Apple shares were up 0.5% premarket and have gained 82% in 2020, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.24% has gained 6.6% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% has gained 15.5%."
3 minutes to earnings. A bit nervous but optimistic.
"So who is buying the KIA, errr I mean Apple car?!"
Bought in at $138 - hope It was a good move
Breaking 144$ before noon?
Seriously undervalued stock. You can buy it at any-day and will do very well in the next 5 years
Amazon reports first 100bil and starts to rocket. Apple does it and it goes down hahaha. I don’t know why I’m still holding this stock
I'm in at 137$ only 8 shares. long and will be adding
Great company
The power hour we've been waiting for!
Never again will I go all in even with a company like this.
Last Bargain before earning
"Wait for earnings call, that will make it move."
"For those who are trading AAPL, don’t sell till after earnings. If we hold the line like GME, we can run this up strong."
Apple futures are completely meaningless as we all learned last week
Hoping for a dividend boost and a ton of share buyback. 
"today was an important lesson for all.It really speaks volumes how option action rule stock action.It was the option action that drove AAPL to $145 before earnings. But every coin has two sides. Everyone was on the same trade and the markets did what they always do when that happens - went the opposite way to kill the premium.This has happened before. As the board historian I did warn on Tuesday and pre-market on Wednesday.Despite that, WE were wrong. WE apologize"
"There is absolutely no reason in the world why Apple should be down if the posting world record profits this past quarter and the outlook is only Rosie, within a week this will all change when people realize this is the diamond it's always been and is going right back up!"
I voted for BYDON loving it
Singapore’s floating platform shop is filled with people queuing Everyday. So is the Changi Airport shop. Apple will beat the earnings by a huge margin.
this will open green
Tony Balooga has now raised Apple’s price target 4 times in the last 2 days. This is unprecedented.
All the more reason for the Reddit crowd to jump on Apple for the blatant manipulation by the hedge fund managers of this stock price. The co blows out earnings and they tank it to shake out weak hands since they probably shorted it at 145. Time to teach them a lesson with the most widely owned stock on the planet
Algorithim players move today?AAPL has dipped six times to $126+. So i do not expect a new trend to start.AAPL has yet to print $131intra day low or $132 as intra day highI think a move to $130+ is very possibleToday is Friday. Premium on weekly options is at a five day low.
I thought all Republicans said the markets only will go down with a Democrat Pres?....lol.How much are we up so far?
$140 today
Keeep calm 1$ down we call this Market
HUGE BEAT FOR MSFT. $3 BILLION REVENUE BEAT
A. Thru the roof Apple earnings this afternoon....B. Down day todayC. Apple up Thursday 10%. No brainer
Tony Balooga just raised his Q1 EPS estimate from 27 cents per share to $1.08 per share........a 400% increase. Tony says the market is underestimating the Bulldozer like power Apple has in the marketplace.
This will not see 130s after today.
"To all those who claim they are buying. You Must Be The Only Ones! No sense of urgency at all. Look at the charts no resistance until 130-132ish. I afraid that is where this is going. Already down 10 points from it's high. First Cramer said spac's needed the money so they sold Apple. Today it's hedge funds selling for liquidty to cover shorts in the reddit attack stocks. So what now? We all talk up how great next quarter is going to be?? Yeah Ok, I hope I am wrong."
Elon proved how easy it is to manipulate a stock in this market climate
"FB, MSFT,APPL all had earning beat, APPL has the best ER of all, FB , MSFT are up while APPL is down , I don't get it."

"Cleared out the weak hands, on our way to $150."
Bring on the upgrades. Investors need other people to tell them that earnings were great and brand clearly winning in market and expanding on multiple fronts.
Slowly slowly everything turning positive . The biotechnology just turned positive
Green by 8:30 this morning
market didn’t react much to intel sales increasing 33%
"As I stated earlier in the day I expected a muted response. Great revenue & earnings. Some of that was baked in. Given a generally wobbly market sentiment its a hard environment for giant leaps. However, after the dust settles and people get real with the new Washington the money will flow back into stocks as there is simply no place else to get a return on investment."
Apple will turn the market futures positive after the close....same old same old ...they always try to drive the markets down before good news
$162 after hours
Crack 3.00 after hoursThis will roll to 140 tomorrow and 150 by Friday
"the MM are keeping options worthless this Friday, but next week, this stock will skyrocket past 160. Buy now or forever dream."
"I have said this hundreds of times, this is not a stock you trade. The pattern of some selling after great earning is predictable, but if you are a new investor this is the time to load the boat for the future. Who sell's a stock that just made around $112 billion in a quarter and is in a 5G super cycle? If you do sell it, where do you put your money? This stock will run to $170 by the Spring and I believe be approximately $200 by the end of the year."
"Why is this down???? Apple beat records on every end, top and bottom. products sales on everything, all time highs! and this is . down￼? The situation is unacceptable"
How to figure aapl stock price using Goldman Sachs’ Rod Hall’s target...use a 2x factor ...his latest target is $85...so in reality the year end target should be 2 x $85.=$170/share. I see aapl floating around $140-150 before earnings announcement...with some drop off after announcement..before further build up. A more likely case is the higher $200/sh bull case that some analysts have been pushing.
munster said they blowout earnings and has a 200 pt. probably by the end of the year.
Historical records point to $133 to $134+ as intra day high soon.This pre-makret dip is a good sign
Get yourself a little insurance from the market droppingSDS goes up when Market Goes down
Look at that chart for IPV....going back to ATH of $20+. We are voting to merge with AEVA SOON. AEVA makes the first 4-D LiDAR and it's 2 founders are former APPLE Engineers.....$GOEV $AAPL
Looks like $130 0r $131 for today!
Still up above $2.1T market cap. If this goes under $2T that’s a buy. Going to $2.5T after earnings. Very possible like TSLA to add that much value in short time!
"Don’t forget today is month end because January 31, is a Sunday. Big money pouring into the stock market fromIRA, Pension plans, 401k and 403b plans for February 2021 today"
Kuo: Apple to work with GM and European car manufacturer PSA
We need to reach $138
"I know for a fact all of us longs are sat here laughing a little inside every time we see these shorts lying and trying to panic everyone as if AAPL is about to fall of the face of the earth all because it hasn't reached a price we'd hope for over a period of just a few days...We shall all be rewarded very greatly for our patience, time is money."
$140 tomorrow and $150 after earnings...apple and Facebook strong
Tesla misses on earnings watch Apple take off now
"Wow just passed 1,000 people in the forum!"
Go Apple!!!
"Apple going this high is scary . It brought the whole market down in sept. When it hit 138.Do you think we are in a bubble? Cathy wood doesn’t, think so , and she is a lot smarter than me ,there's so may people warning we are at a top ."
"India, car, watch - glucose, iPhone sales records, batteries, all in a pandemic. Gonna be huge!"
"sell the news... previous 5 sessions, apple has gone up almost 20%. This is already baked in and I do not believe it has any room to go up further. Look at MSFT it's only 4% gain after blowout qtr. The past few months there were no stimulus, lockdowns, etc and millions unemployed and no way can afford an iphone..."
Absentee Voting by Smart Phone ?Finger Print Recognition ?Problem Solved !
Hoping that I’m seeing the start of Tesla bubblers realizing how lucky they were and now deciding to park their lucky gains in Apple.
Apple and Microsoft share price appreciated more than 5 times in last 5 years whereas gross revenue increased by 2 to 3 times. It seems stock price still on high side compared to revenue growth. Some correction is expected in near term on fundamentals.

No Dip = $4+ todayDIP = Falls into red
Remember Cramer don’t run the stock market! Do you think warren buffet listens to him? Don’t think so.
stock price is at 140 from phones and computers. when ev innovation plans are announced this will skyrocket to 500+
Today was a new closing high for Apple at 136.87. While the intraday high still stands at 138.79. Overall a nice day for Apple.
And I thought this was going to pop today. Guess not lol.
"Still, appl should ring the $138 .. In addition to AAPL-Car news we have the microchip SHORTAGE and AAPL produces their own.....Margins UP again.."
Another red down day for this Oinker Apple stock!
"Yes, When AAPL was at $137.40 I did post to take profits on Jan 22 calls.Then AAPL ran to $140.Who knew?Anyway, by taking those profits on the Jan 22 calls off the table the market makers were not going to close AAPL below $135 which they were trying to do.Option expiration is very tricky. The trick is to be first"
"The JNJ vaccine is one dose, easy to store, and keeps 100% of those who take it Out of the Hospital and the morgue. What else do you want? Let’s go. Mass Vaccinations. 2 million a day."

Apple will be 175+ by the time they announce the Apple Car in March
"I am selling my AAPL as I have lost money. To many shares. The glory days are gone. Made more money on CHWY, BYND which I sold. Had it will AAPL. People with 1-2 thousand who bought @ 140 are getting killed."
160 pretty soon
Much ado about nothing!
"We have the Apple Car and before the Car we will have Augmented Reality. Both of these have massive TAM’s. ( total addressable market). All this on top of their legacy businesses, iPhone, Services,, Mac, IWatch .....,.. Buy/Add/Hold and repeat. "

"Sell off coming, future guidance will be a big disappointment. Still looking at a 12%-18% correction before summer."
Apple expected to post its ever first-quarter with more than $100 Billion revenue Wednesday!!!!WAY TO GO APPLE!!!!
I’m guessing most here bought in the $130s-$140s? No wonder why your bltching! If your long your gonna have to wait for the big gains! Those you bought under $120 don’t really care
"Tim Cook says there’s a big announcement coming tomorrow, stay tuned. "
Thanks for the shares at 136!!
"Tesla missed earnings, and the stock is up huge. apple has blowout earnings and the stock is down. it makes no sense to me."
"In conclusion. We long term holders must remember even if this dips on earnings. We have a long term plan stick with it, and let's pray for next week."
Can you not use Parler in a browser? This would be a major flaw if they didn't build a website along with the apps. Apps make you subservient to the corporate powers that control the OS. The web is freedom.
is stock going to trade up going in dividend record date? anyone trade it before?
This company is a powerhouse.

I think Hedge funds have sold AAPL short. AAPL can spike anytime to cover position. Very risky and dangerous these days to play short sale. All the numbers are obvious and leaks from the institutions not very difficult to ignite the buyers an players. There are big players behind this game. It cannot be possible without the involvement of big players
APPLE is in oversold territory. It corrected about 9%. I expect a retest of 135-138 in 2 weeks.
Why does GS keep Rod Hall employed. The journalist over at Apple 3.0 nails it when he calls GS Rob Hall a st show
Don't Panic ladies. A greener closing today and much more greener tomorrow 
"Yesterday was triple witching when stock, index and ? (Any help) monthly options expire.This on top of the social/political climate issues was a real head wind to our rally attempt.The early am algorithim rally was there but it was short lived. It started to look like a ""W"" shaping up but there was no interest at the end of the dayWhat surprises me is how AAPL dipped back to $126+ in after hours.If it prints $126+ on Monday that will be the seventh time in past how many days AAPL traded between $126 and $130+Some laugh but a dripping faucet fills a bucket too!"
"Sounds like the green new deal is taking the wind out of the market. Oh well I didn’t vote for him however, several of my dead relatives did..,,"
This is nothing but a minor blimp in the long term scheme of things.
"As the news and eyes fade away from GSTOP and AMC, and Tulip Mania 2021 takes a Prozac pill, this stock will go to 137 maniana...."
"So much activity in GME and AMC, Apple ER will be overlooked. I'm long AAPL but good lord, check out the volume on those 2."
buy here before we go over 150
Buying more now and if it goes into the 120's buying even more. Best Q1 report in the history of mankind will spike soon.
"True market manipulation by WS - sell it and watch for weak hands, then buy it again low. It is always done on AAPL. A company that blew all UNREASONABLE high expectations; and yet got rewarded by hammering its stock."

"ytd returns. Google 21%, Amazon 3%, apple is 1.5%. gene Munster said we will have the largest return this year. it doesn't look it."
RSI is improving ! Don’t be spooked people !!
"There is talk of the next AppleWatch having non-invasive Glucose Monitoring. That would be huge for diabetics or anyone who is interested in tracking their blood sugar. I really can't believe Apple has found a way to do something that is practically the Holy Grail in health tracking, something that many medical companies have been trying to do for years and failed. It almost sounds too good to be true and I hope it's not some internet prank. AppleWatches will be flying off the shelves and plenty of people will be upgrading right away just to have that feature. I hope Apple has the feature thoroughly patented so their IP isn't stolen immediately. Apple would become hugely valuable to the health community if this story is true. I know there are going to be plenty of doubters, as usual, who'll claim Apple is committing fraud or something. Anyway, I can't wait to hear more details about this Glucose Monitoring AppleWatch."
"This Friday, Apple $167. Buy now or going up n up starting tomorrow. Bye bye Low prices"
gme profits will go into apple. then Apple will skyrocket
"Short squeeze this week boys!! $135 by next week. Patience pays off, now it's our turn. So many people have shorted shares like @SonnyBlack. Once this thing starts to go up this week, it will go even higher once they have to start selling off. New all time highs!!"
MSFT coming up soon!
"Dividend pay out next week, so i expect this to jump next week. before the 8th of January record date!"
Should’ve bought GameStop - dang it
TSM up 10%. This is the bottom before earnings. Today all major stocks + or - 0.5%. Apple will be green by EOD. Very good buying opportunity especially calls either for short term or long term
wowwwww futures tonight look good
I wish we don’t close red :/
An AAPL a day keeps the doctor away...
"Over 60% of this stock is owned by institutions. They bought more last week. Do you really think they are going to let their investments drop even further, especially right before earnings are released. It looks really bad for them, they will push the price up this week."

"Easy to hold when you are in your 20’s 30’s even 40’s but in 60’s and in 70’s where your savings are in the stock market your ceiling of tolerance is not as high even with the safety net of a great stock as AAPL. just look at yesterday and today, truly a disappointment. So regretfully my wife and I will be faced with a decision to hold or sell APPLE tomorrow. We truly hope for a positive AAPL day as it will postpone any forced exit from this great company."
A SHORT SQUEEZE OF AAPL SHARES ON REDDITT IS MORE THAN WELCOME
"Talk about stock manipulation... These analysts were reporting the stock down after earnings, despite the fact that they were up... Probably just to scare the price down so they can quick get in."
It’s funny how they are so desperate and are prioritizing impeachment of a former predent when there are a lot more important things to deal with in the house right now like vaccine rollout or stimulus. Maybe rejuvenate those 35000 jobs elsewhere which you purposely lost just to stick it to Tump.

Need to go back to $138. Let’s go
Apple I love you
Apple just sold $14 B of bonds according to Bloomberg. My guess is that they took some of this money and bought back stocks cheap esp. on Friday.
Maybe today is beginning of payoff from great earnings. Patience is a virtue.
Should see a nice bump tomorrow! Both Amazon and Alphabet had earnings beats. Apple should see a ripple effect from their earnings beats?
You shouldn't be scared for a companies that are making profits YOY like $aapl and don't get panicked of this drops in price. It will be back with bang.

I’m glad this backed off some and reset just before ER. That means it will pop big on a great ER. 160+ Is very possible tomorrow AH. I expect we see 145-147 during day tomorrow.

"Agreed! Apple did announce ramping ramping up production.""Apple's iPhone Sales Could Blow Up in This Market in 2021""""A huge jump in 5G smartphone sales in this market could be a boon for Apple.""Jan 26, 2021 at 10:28AM""The iPhone 12 lineup has generated impressive sales for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the company is expected to raise production significantly in 2021 to meet the strong demand for its 5G-enabled offerings. That's not surprising, as Apple had a huge installed base of users ready to upgrade to 5G-capable smartphones -- and the company gave them a great reason to make the jump with the well-priced iPhone 12 lineup."""
way undervalued. This should reach 200 by May
might hit $142 tomorrow and on its way to $150
Going green at the open! Follow the smart money and you will prosper

"Before some of you start attacking me, let me be clear that I'm long and I do own a respectable amount of AAPL shares. So GOOG crushed earnings, the stock is skyrocketing AH. Apple blew earnings to smithereens, the stock went down in flame and has not recovered much since... Literally WS is bearish on this stock and it will continue to do so, until Apple comes out and announces iCar."

"All you iCar fanboys need to come to the realization that the Federal Highway Administration will not have the research or legislation to allow self-autonomous vehicles on public roads in 2024.

You are not going to be owning an iCar in 2024."

Apple stores will open soon. The truth will prevail, Esp/revenues are truth and correction will send to 200 at least. Dividends are good while I am waiting for price to break 200 in Feb."
Musk Tweets again this time about DOGE and the stock goes nuts.He will be in jail at some point.
"The biggest institutional shareholders of AAPL (Vanguard,Berkshire,BlackRock & StateStreet own 30%) never intend to permanently sell a single share. So they care less if AAPL price goes up. So how do they derive a nice ongoing income from their position? By using every illegal means necessary to suppress AAPL to the same price forever..."
"Warning —SHORTS COVER NOW ! You are ABOUT TO BE VERY UNHAPPY.Apple and Hyundai in talks over electric vehicle partnershipJan. 07, 2021 10:01 PM ETApple Inc. (AAPL)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor1 CommentHyundai Motor (OTCPK:HYMLF) is up more than 20% in Seoul trading after the company confirmed that it is in early stage talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about working together to develop a self-driving car, without any firm plan in place yet.Reports suggest both electric vehicle production and battery development have been discussed on an initial basis about a car that could potentially be released in 2027.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives thinks Apple is looking at a handful of strategic EV partnerships and collaborations globally with existing automakers, including Hyundai.More from Ives: ""We believe based on our investor conversations over the last few weeks that many on the Street would rather see Apple partner on the EV path, than start building its own vehicles/factories given the margin and financial model implications down the road, coupled with the strategic product risk around such a gargantuan endeavor. This speaks to our view that the chances of a strategic partnerships with the likes of a Tesla, VW, Hyundai or other auto manufacturers in China (e.g., Nio, Xpeng) are in the 70%+ range over the next few years and could lay the groundwork for a dual path (start building its own line of EV autos post 2025) over the next decade if this EV/autonomous venture is successful with consumers.""The electric vehicle sector is red hot right now off the Apple buzz and Blue sweep in DC."
Remember if CANOO is rejecting $AAPL means it is something bigger than $AAPL
"These ##$%@ are desperate. They, the institutions, the hedge funds/etc. are making it look like it is crashing.. they shut down WSB.. they are desparate.. they are trying to take out stop losses on other stocks they have shorted to get the stocks right now... THIS IS LOW VOLUME MANIPULATION at its finest.... relax"
My replies keep getting deleted. Gee I wonder why. Goes with Apple taking our Parler. I am selling apple for aligning with big tech censorship. Sell outs
Apple will continue cruise to $140 by tomorrow because bullish sentiments are building up by trading volume against the o/I indicators. Do trade cautiously. super long Apple.
"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put the odds of an Apple car unveiling by 2024 at ""35%-40%,"" given challenges on manufacturing, batteries and regulations. But he strongly believes Apple will announce an EV partnership in 2021, with Hyundai potentially the first and more to follow.Ives named Tesla (AAPL), Volkswagen (AAPL), Nio (AAPL) and Xpeng (AAPL) as potential partners on an Apple car.I Vote for $NIO + $AAPL"
"as usual: record earnings, but the stock drops like a rock ..."
"After all that said and done, I’d rather see AAPL gain slowly but surely and at month end every month it’s averaging $8. Do the math end of year easy over 200. Nice slowly but surely and the longs always perpetually win."
"Although we won’t see 140 today, I venture to say 140-145+ is very doable by week of 2/19. Perhaps 150 by end of February."
"I’m not saying that AAPL will get to 3 trillion soon, but do you guys think AAPL will be the first to get there?"
"buy all the Apple shares you can for the next couple years, before they release the new Apple car...."
In the next 4 years Apple will be in the Robo Taxi business. That alone justifies a $4T market cap.
145 tomorrow 
beat earning but still go down...why?????Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): FQ1 GAAP EPS of $1.68 beats by $0.27.
"If you don't have shares in $amc right now get some, Monday is going to start the massive squeeze. Nothing is going to stop it."
"""Morgan Stanley hoisted its price target on the stock to 152, from 144.."""
the buyers will come in at a record. no one wants to sell here as the stock will move up big time
Fantástico Day! All time high heading into ER on Wednesday. Should be more where that came from mañana. Enjoy the ride up amigos! Giddy Up! 
Institution investor￼ are buying slowly before earning. Hold your share 150+ after earning.
Get in today. $145 next week!! No way this goes down before earnings on Wed!!
"Holding 1/29, 135's Calls. How do I excersize??"
Apple is nothing without a capitalistic system. Their involvement in politics should always align with creating share holder value. I'm assuming with their new racial equality 100 million dollar project they are going into the inner city house holds to fix the dysfunctional family dynamics? I'm sure Apple leadership wants to get to the root cause of this problem rather than pander to the left? Let's all just make money!
"If you forget the pre-split euphoria, then the stock has been steady. Sep/Oct 100sOct/Nov 110sNov/Dec 120sJan/Feb 130sThis includes two significant blips (in October and last week). I don't think any long term holders would be disconcerted. Solid fundamentals and P/E expected to come down in future."

Apple will zoom pass $250 soon . Guaranteed!
"Am not happy with Mr Tim Cook, why?:• he chose to withhold this info and opportunity to announce EV-Kia during last weeks Earnings Call, hmmm, why?• ""Kia!"" a low-end brand and demographic...""Apple,"" THE premium brand and demographic.I will never own a Kia or Hyundai... I choose quality-of-life and living in premium-level vehicles... Lexus+Acura+Audi"
"The stock is now far from cheap, and could fall short-term. No worries long-term though."
It’s green wow
"Looking to sell in the next few months only because I need the cash for a down payment. Ya’ll think I should do it right after earnings, or wait till March?"
136 gets us to 140 and up up up and away
Going into earnings negative is better!
Here is a fact for AAPL INVESTORS: In a span of only one year Apple more than doubled its market cap. 1/03/20. 1.172 Trillion. 1/25/21 2.4 Trillion. Need I say more?
AAPL will gap-up huge on Monday Trust me. hedge fund will fight to cover who cover 1st. Buy buy I told tis morning...GAME IS OVER..they are covering
next quarter will be even better
AAPL’s net cash and free cash flow are truly breathtaking. $35 billion in cash and $71 billion free cash flow. They could easily afford to pay a 4-5 percent dividend like ABBV if they wanted to. Will they? Highly doubtful but it’s a thought. Either way hopefully this EV is a good use of putting that mountain of cash to work.
"The numbers should blow away the estimates, but what will really matter will be how the services sector is doing? What Cook says about services will determine how investors react to the earnings call IMO? Hardware purchases are a big chunk of Apples revenue, but services are the the future! I think the direction that the share price takes after the earnings call will be determined by what cook has to say about Apple's services sector?"
Tells me it will be red tomorrow too
The car thing seems like it's a long way away. Cant believe it would have a big impact on share price until there was more concrete information. I mean it is a 2.3 trillion dollar company...takes a lot to move the needle and sustain that move. So...any time frame estimates on when this car might become reality?
"THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE FLAW OR BAD GUIDANCE IN THE EARNING REPORT. THE SHORTS , BEARS AND SELLERS WILL BE DEVESTATED. NUMBER ONE STOCK TO OWN IS AAPL. EXPECT UP 5 TOMORROW"
Be strong Apple team. You win on days like today by holding & buying opportunities 
Shorties about to cover more $135+
Expecting another massive share buy back announcement. That plus record sales are worth a few more points.
Greatest company in the world. Their earnings report next month will show why
I bought this and added to it on margin at 144. Any idea when I will see gains again?
I believe this will come back in a big way starting tomorrow and Friday
"10 days. 17 EO'S. One annoyed neighbor. Cutting the legs from under the SEC. 2 market bloodbaths. Big Tech selloff.

"Market distorted, Dow stuck in range. AAPL better deliver or huge correction eminent."
Revenue records all around
New high tomorrow
"Short squeeze will come to AAPL. The truth will prevail. EPS/revenues are truth, and current earnings doesn't reflect the current price. AAPL should at least be 170 after hrs. But the shorties will be wiped out eventually like gamestop . Keep buying at pullbacks and accumulate. The fed has nothing to do with AAPL peformance. Customers love apple products regardless covid or not. Quarantine or not. Apple price should sustain in uptrend mode cuz APPL beat Q over Q. Fiscal year over FY..buy"
Does anybody honestly see Apple going down to 120-125 range? My average is 115 and I want to add more I just hate to average up
Apple taps Porsche’s VP of Chassis Development as ‘Project Titan’ car production rumor heats up
"this stock is gonna sweep the earnings, i cant wait for the faces tommorrow when people rush to push this to 170... apple car or no apple car, apple delivers"
Apple should do another major buyback. They have tons of cash.
"The M1 laptops still have a delivery time of 1-3 weeks (and have since the launch), what a great sign of exceptional volumes! The silicon Macs will be huge for Apple in the coming years (with M1X coming soon..)."

Wedbush on Seeking Alpha see's 225.00 price target for Apple! Woo!
WIN WIN BUYING BEFORE THE EARNINGS. AAPL CAN PULL A TESLA RALLY AND TRADE ABOVE 165 POST EARNINGS. UP 6-8 ON MONDAY
Imagine panicking when the share price is slightly down
Still loving the low volume. Lots of people holding is going to drive this way up on earnings.
Tomorrow $150!!!
All the smart ones are jumping in today. Next week will be much higher!!
NOBODY BUYS ANYMORE A LAPTOP OR IPAD OR MOBILE PHONE BUT AAPL. AAPL WIL BEAT BIG AND GUIDE BIG. CAN GO UP 12 DOLLARS POST EARNINGS. TRADE AT 160
Can anybody guess how high will Apple go next week and the week following that because results are going to be outstandingly great!
Rally looking good...but now jealous media will fight back about how many ‘trillions’ Apple is worth...wait for it...
"Apple cannot be stopped. Don’t question it, just buy more."
No logical reason why this didn’t shoot higher off earnings. Now it has to claw back.
its time for 160
How is it possible the NASDAQ is up about 550-600 points in a few days and AAPL isn't moving in line with it. Biggest stock on the board and miniscule.
The big squizzz is coming to APPLEJust watch
"Only 111 billion, no big deal. I can make that much in one dream."
3 great market days and aapl is up 2.5%. Thanks aapl.
"Not sure what Cramer had to say about AAPL here that caused this thing to crash, but the fact of the matter is that nothing fundamentally changed. AAPL is still expecting a blowout earnings report and every one is raising their price targets for AAPL. This still has the potential to hit $160 by the end of the week."
TWO WORDS PEOPLE; APPLE CAR. SHARES ON DISCOUNT TILL 2027.
just hedge funds selling to cover short positions
Funny. No upgrades for Apple. Funds selling Apple to pay longs in gme amd

Just read the article about apple selling bonds to buy back shares. I really would like to see a hike in its dividend which I feel is rather meager. Something similar to AVGO's possibly

I just started trading options and did very well with Apple, Ford and blackberty a last week. I got excited expecting a good return based on Apple's earnings expectations. Did not expect a company with such amazing earnings to drop. Lesson learned"
Red will be the color of thr day tomorrow.Cook will need to come up with something more substantial than this to get the shares moving.He has no game.

Apple doesn’t know how to go down. It’s just going up.. plus Apple car. Maybe two to three years later it’s gonna sky rocket again and change all the EV market
Apple support. Looks like we will go back up again

Please repeat again, buy it don't trade it, Don't look at it for 5 years, I've owned it since Blah, Blah, Blah. Good luck people but that stock split, share price reduction enabled the manipulation of this stock. Funny though it had no effect on Telsa. This stock needs a good juicy leak about something good."
Last time I was trapped 136 .... it fell to 106

I suggest buy the dip, this stock is not going to ditch you."
Say goodbye 6 figures options ends today
"aapl cars 2027, aapl forever on discount until then, buy all you can"
Ahhhhhhh it hurts- should’ve bought GameStop
how much did they paid as dividend ps?
"Apple may very well surprise everyone as the late EV entrant that ends up with a truly autonomous, affordable vehicle for the masses that is also highly profitable for Apple.

Let’s go to $136 nowww

I'm still holding and adding, and now have over 2,000 shares. There are 29 stocks in our portfolio and Apple is one of 3 that is absolutely not for sale. The other 2 are Microsoft and Target."
"Before earning, at 140. After earning 150 or more. Hold tight"
hot stock market. easy to make money these days. down days are rare
AAPL will be above 150 in January!all chipmakers are threatened by AAPL! All social media platforms and Ad industry are controlled by AAPL! AAPL is the king in both hardware and software!
I made the mistake of selling after a earnings dip back in 2008. Not doing that again.
"I think majority of the traders on the GME board do heavy drugs! Its crazy what some people write, they think its going to 50K! lol"
for we consumers the best world is one of competition for our bucks. so we need to keep gasoline engine cars and trucks .. plus the battery and metal models to fight it out. the oil rich countries will lower the barrel price. as the markets dictate.
Tomorrow =this week Alphabet and Amazon will beat all expectations and take the market to the sky . The saying used will be “market rocketed to the sky “.
Love how a massive amount of people will hold strong on their shares with a terrible company like GameStop but people see a dollar drop on the best company in the world and will start to sell. SMH give me a break
Up day tomorrow
why is this not in the green yet !!
We will have so many upgrades in the morning lol
Please finish GREEN today. Even a penny. Yesterday restored some faith.

Kia will build the carsin the US under the control of APPLE. Nothing to do with the Kia autos, but kia seems to makegreat cares with little problems."
That’s ur warning right there... don’t fall for those who says “Stocks only go up” that May be true but not on the environment we are in!
The entire market was green all week this week and this pathetic oinker of a stock that is Apple couldn't even manage to make some hay. Next week everyone will sell and the market will go down and Apple will nose dive again! (Shakes Head)
"So, why is AAPL up close to 3% in premarket?"
Buy before earnings or miss out
will someone please explain in simple terms why apple is down after blowing out the quarter with unbelievable revenue etc.
Why should apple make and sell a car when they can license technology to all car companies instead and avoid lots of liabilities auto companies always gets?
Happy to load 150 shares Friday at $131.37
"loading in more in the coming days. minor setback, major comeback."
No crazy tweets to #$%$ the market now.
I think we close green today.
Apple will continue to climb in price. It could very well be $200 by year's end.
Apple is on sale! I feel sorry for those who truly believe that Apple will tank. Buy now if you can.
"PeopleTalking about Kia , most likely don’t own a car, never owned a car, never drove a car"
"INSANE, UNBELIEVABLE REASULTS. SELLERS AND SHORTS ARE TOAST. THE STOCK WILL MOVE UP 6- 8 TOMORROW GUARANTEED"
$137.50 After Hours.
"Don't be fooled,there are enormous call options over 135 they want to expire worthless.. That's the reason it struggle so much at that price, once they are removed the skies will clear.. focus on next month"
So this shows you just where we are in bizzaro world. LVS missed top and bottom...stock is up 3%. FB beats top and bottom... down 6%. So let’s hope AAPL misses. That seems to be the only thing that makes a stock move up in this upside down world.
150 after earning
Terrific report. Congrats to Apple management. MSFT was a tough act to follow - but you did it.
I know lot of you are laughing at me when I say Apple goes to $400 by December 2021. The quarterly results will be shockingly great
The iCar Will be a blessing to senior citizens can no longer drive. Want grandma to come visit you and the kids? Tell Siri to send your icar to pick her up!

Apple had way better earnings than Google and Amazon. Sometimes things just don't make sense.
I overheard that with the new president the stock market will crash once to balance out the economy market what do you guys think since im a newbie i get worry alot
"I bought at 132$/share.. spent almost all my money. approx 100k. And it just going down all the time.. Thinking to sell it, coz this going down almost every single day."
Wow CNBC Apple's stock price drop after earnings was equal the sum of money lost by funds thru the short squeeze.Well that's where the money went. :(
Earning probably baked in. Shorties hoping you sell so they can make money off you. Hold tight
Investing 101 - BUY APPLE - HOLD APPLE- OWN APPLE- class dismissed
Looks like a golden buying opportunity as I expect upgrades in the coming days
Those questioning (unnecessarily) quality of Hyundai/Kia is why Apple wanted them quiet. Apple enforces highest quality control as always. Reminds me of Chevy-badged car I bought in 1985 discovered later was an Isuzu—was actually most reliable
Has anyone else noticed there is always something negative about the market when Apple earnings are due?
KIA AND AAPL CAR BEST COMBINATION EVER. AAPL SHOULD BE UP OVER 140 TOMORROW. INSTITUTIONS AND HEDGE FUNDS AND ROBINHOOD INVESTORS WILL TAKE IT OVER 141. AAPL SHOULD BE VALUED AT 200 NOW
who wants to play... at what time AAPL goes positive? I'll start... 1pm.
Did anyone see aapl up over 10 bucks in after hours and then it went back to up 48 cents?
Shorts on here telling people to sell right before earnings...hahahaha
It will be down over $1 today by close.
"Apple always takes a dip after hours. But it's the new Tesla, goes up every day now until earnings"
"They cannot even sell the electric cars they are manufacturing right now. Anybody who wanted an EV car already is driving one. There is simply no interest, just media hype."
The Republican Compromise on Stimulus is still generous !Up to 50k per single and 100k per Family would get the full 1400 per dependent !Better take that deal quick!Nobody is starving at those two levels of pay ?30 single45 head of household 60 FamilyReduce it by 100 per dependent for each 2000 of income above those limits.That’s my plan !Lol
Everything green but Apple. Ends green today.
"Be very wary people ! You are all disappointed about the after hours trading but allowing short term emotional selling into your strategy will cost you money and future wealth ! Turn off that emotion, read the technicals and hold apple forever! It will pay ! Big !"
"so sick of the tv telling us that this cant happen and you have $w , $sq, $pton, $aapl all way overvalued to the point that they think its ok.... whatever people buy what they want get over it"
i have been considering buying apple for a while .. i see years of growth and a bright future for this company. today i got in people who think apple is only a phone ..... we are going to be shocked what the future will do!
what does Tesla do when Apple begins selling a self driving electric car with Hyundai vertical integration and apple tech?
Trading volume was one of the highest.....177 million on the downside. Comments?
tech is going to have themselves a party in the coming days
Great news!! Apple shares surge as Wedbush sees $225 bull case ahead of FQ1
Apple should be up 6 points today.
when @Anonymous said $120 apple today
debating buying 175K worth of Apple.......
Is everyone gonna sell cuz it’s Friday tomorrow?
target price raised to 170 everywhere will close positive bug time
Apple + Kia = Electric vehicle partnership confirmed ............ ApKi Car 2024.......... Apple $555 coming
"After skimming through Apple Bond Prospectus, I strongly believe now that there is a chunk that is going for building the iCar. Even though it is not mentioned, but since when Apple needs $$ for ""Working Capital, Expenditures, Etc...""? The iCar is camouflaged with all the mumbo jumbo words."
Friends don’t let friends short stocks. Your potential loss is infinite.
GET IN BEFORE EARNINGS. CLOSES 145.8 TOMORROW
In apple for the first time ever at 100 share @ 131. Adding more at 127. I see $200 a share 2022
"Stock barely moving after down substantially last week, will we ever see the $150+ price targets from the Analysts?"
I have over 2300 apple shares and it hurts to see it go down but I am glad my cost basis is $88. this stock is undervalued for what it reports
"105-110 tomorrow.I read it on the internet.Right next to the ""BUY BUY BUY"" article on GME."
"imagine, a company with great products, earning based on actual performance beats all expectations year after year. This is how it should be.where as... a game developer that will be gone in a year with nothing but software that could be sold anywhere... go figure! Hedge funds and Market Manipulators don't like it when someone else beats them at their own game...Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman said exchanges and regulators needed to pay attention to the potential for ""pump and dump"" schemes driven by chatter on social media."
"Wish Apple partnered up with Tesla, one fard out of Elon’s mouth would send my low hanging fruit to the moon"
why apple didn't pop even with great 1st Q reporting?I was hoping at least to 150.
this was an extremely disappointing day for us options holders 
Lovin’ it!
"So, Apple was up 85.31% YTD. So, small wonder there is some year end selling. Those that had the foresight to buy Apple before then, have had a terrific year. Others who bought during this year have nothing to complain about with the kind of performance the stock has had. So, maintain your cool and look forward to another great year to come."
Once it hits 400-500 another split 5-1
"Negative coming mark my words today. Nothing positive about this stock, we need a Steve Jobs to stir the pot."
"Translation: This so called ""Apple Car"" is basically a Korean built KIA with Apple branding. I'd rather buy a Tesla. At least I know I'm buying a car built right here in the USA by an American company."
green from here into the close then AH the big price jump
"Definitely $400 on it’s way. No doubt in my mind. Stay focused on December 31, 2021"
Just two words .....FREE SPEECH.
"Never seen AAPL stuck in a rut like this, even w/stellar earnings, since 2nd Obama admin...like we’ve gone back in time"
$137 tomorrow
1-hour to market close ! place your bets :)
And in the end there will only be AAPL.. Looking to enter a huge position today as we will likely see an earnings driven rally like never before.. This will be my hedge against other market activity
Ill be happy if we can close above 139 today
A caveman could see the $AAPL link.. yet wall street is releasing news discreetly in small chunks to flush the froth (ie Retail)...
"Dear Tim Cook....please miss all future earnings so the stock will go up after you report. Even if Apple makes $150B next holiday season, just tell the street that you missed."
"Apple is a great company. Revenues and profits will go up every year. At the same time, PE is high at 35. Over time Apple will continue to go up but perhaps a little profit taking now to finance positions in other places."
AAPL + lidar + new tech battery + Hyundai = AppleCar. An unstoppable force!
Everything going so smoothly last few days. Why this plunge on the day we’ve waited for??? Booooo!
you don't know investing if you're selling APPL after that earning report...and 5G is still an infant...
Futures shows plummet in overdrive...It'd be hilarious if this thing drops 50% aftrer world wide record holiday earnings...
Can we see 140 today?
There hasn't been a stock that has wasted more of your time since the trillion share split...
WILL CLOSE POSITIVE. THX FOR THE 1.4 mil supporters
Hi guys. Just checking in. I bought in at apple a month ago and my target was to make 25% over the year and I am already up 7%..not a bad return. Very happy with my investment
HOLD IT guys!! Don't let them squeeze you! They just want your shares and your money! Stay away shorties!!!!!
Buying another 1000 shares tmrw to do more covered calls!
"MASA has changed his name to Jack, because Yahoo removed MASA from the blog because of his abusive posts, Beware"
"144 will come fast once the bell rings...looking for 145-148 at ER, 160+ on announcement"
140 Today?
This is just a market correction and hedges shorting. I'm holding till 170.
Futures are red. But TBH - I personal love Hyundai.
"In all honesty, like Tesla, post earnings, all the money printing, low interest rates, this thing could run beyond what we are expecting! $200 sooner than we expect!"
"Strength in Apple iPhone sales bodes well for Qorvo, Skyworks, says Oppenheimer Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer believes that the strength in Apple's ($AAPL) iPhone sales bodes well for RF suppliers Qorvo ($QRVO), Skyworks ($SWKS), and Broadcom ($AVGO) as well as core audio supplier Cirrus Logic ($CRUS). The analyst also points out Apple is shipping the in-house designed M1 ARM processor into entry Mac NB, and might be working on a higher performance ARM processor for high-end NB.(thefly)"
"""Everyone wets their beak!""The investors waited patiently this past month while traders traded.Now, it is time for the investors.It is only fair.Have a great week."
Future is green across the board. Bloomberg reports. Future is bright for investors and economy.
145.04 AH 8:15 Great day tomorrow for all AAPL longs! Shorts get toasted!
X's 1.5 volume... another big bite on the apple upside!
Going back to 80 - buy then
200 a share tomorrow at open. I will buy house with cash 
Rangebound until options expire. Next week should see it run.
The road to $200
Watch it close at $136.99
If Joebama can just mumble his way the next four years maybe AAPL can get to $200 by the end of the year.
"Wow. Dow is down almost 1,000 since Joey was inaugurated. Don't worry, only 4 more years of this."
"""The Only Tech Stock You Need to Buy in 2021""""This stock gives investors the opportunity to take advantage of diverse tech trends.""Harsh ChauhanJan 16, 2021 at 12:35PM""The NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector index comfortably outpaced the broader stock market's returns in 2020.

Should’ve bought GameStop SMH
Today is going to be a good day!
"The Dow is down a little more than 4% from its high. AAPL is down 10%. Does that mean anything? When the largest company in the S&P 500 is leading the downtrend, it is kinda concerning"
Let’s go to $160
When people finally figure out that Musk can't walk on water there will be a huge crash.Lemmings.
Many people says this company is overvalued that is over valued.. but they do not understand.. all those small companies not listed in the exchange shut down.. and all the money is flowing to those that are still strong.. they became even bigger monopolies..
I am keep buying and accumulating. Smart money game will end. Buy buy and accumulate....EPS/revenues command....TRUTH -= profit..AAPL is profitable
136 today
2.3 trillion....That is what the company is trading for currently. Some people should look at how the numbers make sense at price share levels of 150 or 200. 99% of publically traded companies that make good money are not even worth 1 trillion. Berkshire Hathaway isn't worth even 600 billion. WalMart is only worth 415 billion.
"My BMO trades take forever to fill because of the volume in those ""squeeze the shorts' trades like GME, AMC, ... AMC volume is at 250 millions..."
7 bil in stocks that’s 50 mil stocks should pump it past $150
"I find it amusing to hear people asking why Apple's stock went down after announcing a terrific quarter. It's an investor's choice to pick a stock they think can make them money in as short a time as possible. It's said that Gamestock and AMC are making billionaires out of the top investors and those companies are #$%$ investments. Stock manipulation can make and break billionaires. Making money from stocks doesn't require a good company investment, sometimes it just requires good luck and maybe great risk-taking. For me, Apple is a low-risk investment that pays off year after year while Gamestock and AMC may be bankrupt companies six months from now. OK, Apple is down after a blowout quarter and that doesn't make much sense to most people in the short-term. They just see they lost some money. I just see it as a blip in a year's stock movement and how Apple is strengthening itself for the future. By any standards, Apple is making an awful lot of money and that's good for me as a shareholder. I don't have to worry about Apple going out of business soon and I'm guaranteed my dividends. As I've owned Apple since 2004, plenty of market oddities have hit Apple but Apple has always recovered. Many other stocks didn't recover. I feel certain at some point this year, the blowout quarter will boost Apple's share value when it's least expected. Patience is needed when owning Apple. It's something shareholders need to get used to instead of getting frustrated or overly concerned. Three years ago everyone was saying Apple had nothing in the pipeline but they were all wrong. Apparently, Apple can still keep secrets. Apple is busily working on projects behind the scenes and the may be game-changers for all we know.Anyway, put the holiday quarter behind and move forward. Apple is still the market cap leader by a good amount with plenty of cash to work with. Don't be too disappointed in Apple because investors didn't respond to Apple's earnings report. That's their loss because they're busy trying to fulfill their greedy nature with get-rich-quick stocks. It's nothing I want to be involved in. I prefer to own companies that have solid fundamentals and pay dividends over the long-term and that's definitely Apple.????"
Hedge Funds are selling $AAPL to cover their short on Game Stop...
Boom
this is happening because of big hedge funds there manipulating the the stock by selling millions of shares and then buying them back when there down 10 to 20 % don't be fooled by the we need to start a Reddit tread on Apple so the big hedge funds loss the billions instead of the small investor
Bought 30 contracts calls 130 Feb 19th expiration. hoping for great earnings and guidance.
definitely $400 cometh yo way . $200 by mid year and then off it goes to the races. By year end see it at $400 or perhaps more. Thanko
137$ pre market lets go up up and up!
Can we all give a shout to a $140 weekend? stay strong stay long.
are calls a good move for over the weekend?
"A $1,400 stimulus check would be nice. Can use it to buy ten more shares of AAPL. Funny thing is that there are so many of us ( probably a majority of us)that have been working all along and have suffered no financial hardship what-so-ever due to the pandemic. The money will be saved or invested and will not do anything to stimulate the economy. Granted the money will be great for those who really need it. Apparently it would not be politically do-able if they didn't give it to everybody."
See! I warned you yesterday morning not to sell $AAPL. It’s moving higher. $145 maybe today or tomorrow
"The smart folks that made a killing with GME & AMC this week will rotate substantial monies into gold standard for investors, APPLE STOCK. There is allot of money there ! Apple is shooting much higher as soon as ignorant and weak finish bailing (if they haven't already). Apple Long & Strong as always !"
"Who can show how the company gets to 1 trillion in sales from 300 billion? Unless they start selling low margin cars, there is no way. Assume average sale is 1,000 dollars....70 million new customers? Really"
Just tried to buy top of line iMac only to find out that Apple is out of stock till beginning of Feb. Any weakness before earnings I'm loading up!
That cup and handle on the one year chart is a thing of beauty
Something has gone off the rails.
137$ coming up
BIG DAY TODAY BOYS
"Apple up at least $3 tomorrow, the corrections are done. The March to $150 begins"
Heard the earnings report is gonna be amazing! Any price estimates for after the earnings are out?
UPGRADE Jan 19. 2021: RBC Captital Upgrades AAPL $145 both near term and Long term. Bullish Good Luck.
It’s funny because the odds of apple going to $225 are almost impossible this week. If for some miraculous reason they come out and state they are partnering up with GM I wonder what would happen? Ironically enough an analyst did come out with some news hinting of the sort. I don’t have my hopes up but it would be awesome to see!
"N New reports indicate Apple could unveil a bumper earnings report at its call on January 27, possibly making it Apple's first-ever $100 billion quarter.First, from LLD:This three-monthly ritual might grab a few more headlines than normal because analysts expect Apple to generate sales of more than $100 billion a single quarter for the first time in its history. Russ Mould, AJ Bell Investment Director. ""If the consensus forecast of $102.6 billion is attained, that would equate to year-on-year sales growth of 12%, the fastest rate of advance in ten quarters.The report cites Apple's iPhone 12 launch and expected double-digit percentage increases in sales from services, wearables, and accessories"
"Tools were rediscussed today that had been previously hundreds of times before over the past 12 years for cash flow and how to ""Make lemonade out of lemons"".It does not help to complain but to ""take what the markets offer"""
"Latest report from Nikkei is that Apple is in discussions with at least six other automakers, which might include Nissan, Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota..."
Crushed it. It will be reflected in price of stock sooner or later.
Volume is LOW. I find that interesting. I'd love to be a fly on the wall at the Institutional / MM's power lunches (virtual although they may be). It will be very interesting to see what happens from 2:00-4:00 in terms of price movement and volume.
Mute all political posters on this board. Don’t reply to them. They will eventually go away
It’s sky rocketing ! Apple is going to be huge! $170 by Feb 11
"PEOPLE, People, people, chill out, its only one day in the grand scheme of things. The one thing I learned in the Army, when all those about you are losing their heads, keep yours. It will be above the 52 week high by end of month."
Shortly there will be many people saying “Why didn’t I buy more!”
"Share holders own the company if unhappy vote out board and CEO, put voter resolutions on how they spend your money!"
South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor said it's in the early stages of discussions with Apple over potentially working together to develop a self-driving car. Shares of Hyundai Motor surged 20%.Hope we see some movement for apple too
"Everyone is talking about Apple playing censorship, and claiming they are selling their stocks. In the short term, sure ... it may have a slight impact, but you're only hurting yourself. People boycott Starbucks, Nike, FOX, sports... and it only creates a buying opportunity for others. The reality is, you'll be back, so you might as well get over it. There's not a tech company in creation that doesn't either censor citizens, bow to Communists, use slave labor, import jobs and undermine American workers, sow dissent for profit, etc. Bank of America stole my home and equity in 2009 during the housing crisis. So, I bought a bunch of their stocks at $7 and sold at $17. The Boycott Bandwagon dropped Stabucks to $5.. now they're over $100 a share. Kaspernik had little effect on Nike... they were around $50, .. now they're around $145. The reality is.. you and your opinions really don't matter. You're all here for the same reason."
"All they do is trying to make people sell AAPL so they can buy lower. When apple beat earnings, I am buying the fk out of it. I am selling apple when they stop m￼aking electronics (few shares possibly). Earnings just confirmed that apple is undervalued."
February could be a brutal month...I'll buy a few shares if it hits 110.
Bouncing back strong!
$140. Hello
"AAPL, AMZN and online retailers will thrive in 2021 and beyond. Everyone I know has one or more apple products and I see amazon delivery trucks everyday in my rural area (2-3 acre lots). The past year has truly been historical."
It will reach 145 again. Dollar at a time
Well this week certainly didn’t go as planned. I still love my Apple and will hold on for another ten years plus. Great company with so much promise.
Come together and be the rally ! Buy apple and hold apple 
In five years when we're looking at 300 most of the noisemakers will be long gone...no pun intended. I've bought and sold stocks for 45 years and AAPL is one core holding I won't trade. It's a legacy stock for the grandchildren.
"if stock market goes down, the government will give away more money. how can you lose buying Apple stock?"
"So Apple is gonna make a car huh. With every car company in the world now taking production off line due to the chip shortage, ""where are you going to get the chips"". There's a chip SHORTAGE. My point here is that the chip shortage will last longer than most people think. New chip plants need to be built. I am buying LRCX, KLAC, and AMAT. Do your own DD. GLTA"
"It’s a tough market...or it’s a manipulated market, one or the other. Either way, AAPL longs will get their just reward"
Here’s the thing with AAPL that I learned the hard way. It’s not a pump and dump. It’s not for millennials with 3 second attention spans. It’s like a great Cabernet. It’s gets better and it’s notes appreciate over time ... literally. So this stock you buy and you put it on the rack and let it collect dust. Then you slowly screw out the cork in about ten years and reap its bounty from your mere patience. It’s that simple.
"Wall street (institutions) darling , AAPL, is punished by short retail traders who are curtailed from trading on various platforms!"
"Hyundai Corporation's business fieldsTrading; Ships, Automobiles, Machinery, Plant, Electric & Electronics, Chemicals, Steel & Metal, Coal, and other raw materials etc., Project Organization; Power Plants, Roads, Off-Shore Facilities, and Industrial Plants etc., Resource Development; LNG in Yemen/Oman/Qatar, Coal Mine in Drayton Australia, and 11-2 Gas block in Vietnam etc., Overseas Investment; Qingdao Hyundai Shipbuilding in China, Inti Industrial Complex in Indonesia, #$%$Hyundai Coil Center etc."
I do like the low volume though. That means lots of people are holding on to their shares for earnings/dividends. Less shares available is a good thing. Will be less to buy once we get closer to next week which should increase the price
"MSFT up $4.53, AAPL + .81, undervalued AMD - .68................. considering selling 1/2 of my holdings to add more AMD."
"Noticeds some BIG obvious AAPL wash trades recurring yesterday, for example 7,736,716 share @ $137.09 = $1B...those are blatant bear raiding wash trades to suppress AAPL’s price and overpower any upbidding...where shares ultimately go nowhere & wind up back in seller’s hands, and yet SEC does nothing—too weak or corrupt...yet even easy enough for me to figure out."
I have a buy set for $122.00
wonder how. many of those voters that lost their jobs voted against the best job creater president. wait till he shuts off fracking ...
147-148 tomorrow151-153 Wednesday160+ or big selloff Thursday ???????????????????????????
Does APPLE BUYBACK SHARES on ex-dividend day ? It would make sense. Tomorrow could have a nice green tint.Long Apple
Just the first of many car deals with multiple car factories.
hopefully apple and tesla will shine and pull the market out of this tailspin. if all the earnings AH are great then the dow will be up 500 tomorrow.
Too expensive and no I'm not shorting.
"The professionals started showing their might already , so Robinhooders and other retailer newbies book some profits right away this week and stay on cash for summer $AMZN $FB $AAPL $IBM $NFLX $TSLA $SQQQ $TQQQ $MSFT they know know how to amass big profits better"
and we have liftoff
This was end of month repositioning plus options expiration plus some selling to cover the Reddit shorts by the hedge funds. Uptrend continues next week until ex divi on 020821
Omg it’s going down sell before the historic earnings Not!  Go Apple 
Just saw $142.99 pre market
"BREAKING NEWS ""APPLE MISSED ON REVENUE"""
Options expire tomorrow.
APPL! Just buy Lucid Motors already! Make the deal before you lose out. They have the Manufacturing facilities aready and they are ready and willing to make a deal. Get this deal done.
"This week I took photos of option prices throughout the day for Jan 22 optionsWhile it was posted AAPL would run going into earnings and AAPL has shown four now five times the bounce off of $126 to $`131+ as high as $138.94l these trades were so obviousJan 22 $130,,, Tuesday close... .65...Yesterday's close...$6,95Jan 22 $135 ...Tuesday close... .09...Yesterday's close...$2,25the $130 call was obvious the $135 call was a surprise.The return was even higher for AAPL dipped to $126 on Tuesday amMy point?When everyone goes the same way' people do well.It was posted last WEekend it is the investors' time this time going into earnings.It is only fair"
how many know they this stock already has 95 to 105 billion plus in revenue for the quarter......we all know it....so what will amaze me is if they beat the estimated numbers which are always low balled and beat by 80% of public companies....the stock will still go up. Like  hundreds will cheer and congratulate all longs! No one will question the valuation....meanwhile Buffett sold tens of millions of shares lower than 145.
I’mSure those who sold are kicking themselves now. You always hold aapl and buy on the dip
"1-28-21. research is still overwhelming "" buy"" & ""overweight "".just sayin'....."
"Sorry bulls on the little people boards (like Yahoo Finance). If you watch the Bloomberg messenger boards...big boys tam e on appl for now. Yes, phenomenal company, it's just if you think it's rallying above 135 into earnings...good luck, cause the smart money thinks you are wrong (and will be happy to use giddy Vega and Theta to take your money in the options market...beyond just a naked short). Good luck to all longs...just tread cautiously. NUMBERS MATTER."
I’ve worked hard to accumulate 2307 shares and I’m not giving in and selling any. I can’t wait for the next split. 9200 shares. Holding for 5-10 years. Don’t need the money. Still 60k in the green. Sleep well longs
"Pre split, Apple used to have 5/6 days of upward movement whenever it started. Do you guys remember it? Good old days!"
In Apple we trust. Rally into earnings.
Every quarter every analyst makes there predictions always states Apple Dosent look good. Problems with China Problems with store closings problems with anything And every quarter since 48-50 quarters Apple seems to shove itUp there Tail pipes
Lmao at hedge funds and the losses they have sustained ! It’s only funny because of how they have destroyed apples earnings day
Money printing asset P/E inflation is here to stay. Thanks FED
Here we go! Up to $136 within 30 minutes
$FSR Fisker confirmed that $AAPL is going with Hyundai-Kia
"Losing all of the gains today, wow ! why the drop"
Short sellers are piling onto apple because its the only company with a market cap large enough to protect them from WSB =D
"Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple Long term it will make you rich "
"When news breaks tomorrow that I just ordered new M1 MacBook Air, this thing will fly. Have to admit, a bit surprised by the AH action but almost all my tickers are red today."
Friendly reminder that Apple is building M1 Macs as fast as possible and you still can’t get a base model Air delivered until Jan 25. That is called HIGH DEMAND. Earnings at the end of this month will be a blowout.
Any way i truly believe in apples n their technology who else would u rather bets on ??? APPLE BABY
"Good news after good news. From a $100B Quarter, to discussions about partnerships with various automakers. There is no reason for this stock not to be moving up, unfortunately I have to believe that the MM's are holding it back for options to expire. It's unfortunate that GME was the play that publicly displayed their power, and now we can see it happening here, as well as amongst other stocks. Either way, 50 $140 Calls for Feb 12 here and hoping for a positive week next week."
"Aftermarket is for amateurs. Apple killed earnings. Tomorrow apple flys 150+. All these shorts are gonna be toast tomorrow. My guess today was a concerted effort by the big houses to broad base sell to trigger stop limits of the little guys for fing with them cause of GME, amc, bb, bbyd. Tomorrow’s another day"
Seeking advice. I hold shares with Apple long term. Looking to do a call option for when earnings come out and knowing this is the first since iPhone launch. Worth a try?
Don’t want to be overly optimistic but Apple might break $150
Great news! Wow
"150$ before or right after earnings, thank god i got in @ 128$"
Anarchy will be the order of the day when people get fed up enough to push back.
To me Apple should be teaming up with more of a premium brand than Hyundai. Apple products are seen as higher end would think they would partner with a higher end brand...
"Basically you want an EV company that has headroom for improvement & price manouver, Kia is perfect for Apple"
"who lost tons of money in the Dotcom 2000 implosion and the 2008 crash? like Groucho Marx said ""I would have lost even more if I had more to lose"""
VXN is down 6.68% and VIX pretty much flat! A pretty sure indicator that the S&P and Nasdaq will rise today. Also Dow futures fair value is +140 as of now
YO SHORTS just about one hour and 30 minutes left to closing and yo ain't listeening. go long and coverth yo short positions. taketh my advise. Amazon and Google cometh with great results and tomorrow upppp it goes . Thanko if yo taketh my advise.
I actually like the fact that AAPL is taking a breather today. I’d be okay if it took a breather during trading hours tomorrow too. Then it’s not coming into ER as hot.
Here we go!!! Closing at $145!
Rally into earnings!Then at 1550 hrs everyone needs to make their own decisions
"Apple needs to do a EV deal with GM. Now that would be a marriage in heaven that would make Steve Job's very, very happy (if he is in heaven)."
what happens to Netflix now will happen to apple in 8 dayswait and see150 is coming
Sad.. a strong Green Day but Apple not acting positively..
Hope Tim talks about the VR headset/glasses at the call.
"don't worry  be happy long term, it will be 150 and above."
I gonna sell this thing! At $170 not $130
"It’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon"
Why is Apple down today?
I just don’t believe that people will be able to buy an autonomous EV Apple Car in 3yrs. Maybe it will be for commercial use in the beginning. I don’t know. 2024 seems too early 
who here bought an apple product this year? i know alot of people who bought tons of apple products including friends and family. i know apples earnings wont disappoint
Wabash upgraded 160.00
AAPL has behaved as AAPL. Earnings are 1/27..that is my lucky number
Sadly it not long ago that Bears were saying this would be under $100 because 70 million people were going to return in their iPhones. It’s like when people say they are quitting social media for good.
"Keep in mind folks Q4 earning won't go in vein, hang in there ! whole market was down today, it will be back in game soon !"
Good volume before market. I think huge upside coming today for Apple. It’s being talked about in Reddit’s wallstreetbets.
"I recommend to Yahoo that they close the message boards, or put a posting limit per day. one obvious poster is abusive."
"The sky isn’t falling!! The price of shares is, if you want to make money buy more!!! Buy now!!!! This will be fine in a couple of days maybe aooner’n"
"Apple strong momentum until end of 2021. Situation same and the world digitisation process is speed up.. Apple will win in 5G, wearables and services... a sure winner"
Consolidation or more market manipulation?? Let’s share some views people ! I say consolidation 
i had a dream AAPL were fliting around 200/share days before earning. I ordered my bank to wire all my money to my brokerage by tomorrow. I have 750k ready for tomorrow. i ordered few laptops and still has not arrived. i asked too many orders on the last week of dec. Pretty sure EPS/revenues already surpassed its consensus. I hope my money come quick tomorrow before any pop or rally. I want a good entry price. I am pretty sure AAPL will head 200
$140 support to be tested again today ahead of ER.
It’s valuation is absolutely justified now by its earning and the future. Actually it’s undervalued. If you want to talk about apple’s valuation then look at Tesla.
"Listen up, if we band together and start buying AAPL, we can turn it into another AMC or GME. Let's have a Yahoo's revolt on the shorties! Let's do it!"
"Apple is not building cars, it is following NIO’s lead and partnering with an expert, KIA!"
"The start of the week might be not move much, but I guarantee you it will move up by the end of the week. People wont risk not being able to get in before earnings week!! I see some shorts getting squeezed out this week. Go MAGA!!(Make Apple Great Again)"
WE posted weeks ago that Sales will be strong
AAPL is a great company. My original purchase was $25 pre split
I’m honestly not very excited about the Hyundai partnership. Don’t think I’ll be buying a Hyundai with an Apple logo on it. Sounds kind of cheap to me compared to what Nio has been putting out.
"Slow and steady, bought 5 more shares Monday, all I could afford, but wow, good timing.. :-) cheers... Goal is 1,000 shares by the time I retire...."
I don’t care what it does! I will hold until the next split like I have all the other splits!
"Let me repeat AAPL, AMD, MSFT reported great Qs, but the herd are running for the hills scare by hedge fund shorts? Yahoo don't delete my postings"
why is whole market tanking now?
Apple  reports right around 430pm good luck to all remember long and strong
Apple is definitely going to be 165-170 by Friday Munster said 200 Strap you’re self in warp speed coming
Bought a bunch of March calls today . I see Apple in the 150s by then
A true winner and very reliable stock 
Apple just wants to stay at $130s forever smh....
What are 10 of your current holdings? Here are mine -AAPLABRBACGBTCCCLGEVMSFTXAMZN
Guys is it okay to buy Apple at 134.60
134.04 +2.08 (1.58%)Before hours: 8:37AM EST
investing and fishing both require similar skills
"Here’s how Apple did versus consensus Refinitiv estimates: EPS: $1.68 vs. $1.41 estimated Revenue: $111.44 billion vs. $103.28 billion estimated, up 21% year over year iPhone revenue: $65.60 billion vs. $59.80 billion estimated, up 17% year over year Services revenue: $15.76 billion vs. $14.80 billion estimated, up 24% year over year Other Products revenue: $12.97 billion vs. $11.96 billion estimated, up 29% year over year Mac revenue: $8.68 billion vs. $8.69 billion estimated, up 21% year over year iPad revenue: $8.44 billion vs. $7.46 billion estimated, up 41% year over year Gross margin: 39.8% vs. 38.0% estimated"
"Told you earlier to purchase Apple at 140 now it's going green and on its way to 150+, I tried to tell you twice!"
The Dow is up 500? The S & P is up 42?.......I thought Dem wins were supposed to tank the market?
"The M1 is killing the Hackintosh community, elevating the video editing community, destroying reliance’s on intel and amd. There’s absolutely no doubt that Apple is on the cusp of a revolutionary change for their product line with the release of the M1. It’s not even their best chip play this year and it’s stellar as heck."
Moving 50 percent of my portfolio to APPL and BIDU. No brainer. Safest stocks with strong continued growth for years to come! 
Managing buybacks on a price-insensitive basis is rarely a good sign forward...
Ya think Appl is buying another 200 mil shares at these prices?
Apple will soar on Monday!
Needham $170 share upgrade this morning.

"LOL  CNBC breaking news “former ECB MarioIs asked to form Government in Italy “.While this could be a breaking news in Italy why is it a breaking news in the Great United States? LOL. CNBC talk about great results from Amazon, Google, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft etc etc as a great and wonderful news and not about a breaking news for Italy only . LOL"
Apple is about to go on two 15 point runs......back to back. We have seen this setup 20 times. Get on the Train.
Stock buyback. Hope this goes to $200 soon
The government cut the legs from under the SEC so this stock is manipulated to stay this low after blowing earnings out of the water
Hedge fund has to sell apple to cover their short in GameStop and other crazy stocks. This may explain the price drop today.
"Yahoo is reporting that Melvin Capital lost 53% of its worth shorting stocks in January 2021. I think that was between $4 to $ 5 billions with a B.For God’s sake brothers and sisters do not short the market. Stay long and be happy. I used to short and always lost and was always unhappy. My spouse threatened to leave. Today I have core holdings such as Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Microsoft, NXP, Marvell, wmt, Target, Amazon, Costco, Home Depot etc etc and then large amount in mutual funds. There are some excellent families of mutual funds such as Fidelity etc . Buy Blue Chip Growth, Select Semiconductor, Select Software, OTC, Small Capital Growth, Growth Companies (if closed it will guide you to a compatible Fund) , Fidelity Select Technology etc. Quite a few of them have Apple as a core holding. Investing with Fidelity etc you sleep like a baby. You simplify your life and let the experts do the investing. You just tell them which sector you like and then the experts who are employees of these funds do what they do best i.e. research for you . I look at the managers’ profile and I am impressed with their backgrounds and education. As for me I have never been happier as I am now. Thank you"
"Lets state facts. Apple may hit 130 today. We are in the middle of reddit revolution and it may lead to a correction. hold the stock we will be fine. Yes it hurts, we know this."
Here’s comes $177.
"KIA is probably having an ego problem. They may have chickened out of the car deal with Apple because they didn't want to manufacture a vehicle for a different brand. They proabably want a KIA car to be synonymous with them. Well that's alright Apple has plenty of other manufacturers it can go to. I can see a similar problem occurring with Japanese manufacturers who pretty much hesitate in making big deals with American companies so we can probably count Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi out of the equation as well."
we should be taking out ATH every day next week...then rocket ship will be lifting off Wednesday after hours.
"Being the ""Board Historian"", this action is perfect leading into Jan 27, Earnings.Three days this week the return was 50 to 200% each day on that algorithim play"
So am I correct in stating that Hedge Fund people will drive the market down until they can buy in on cheap stocks like AAPL run it up and sell once again. Rinse and repeat.
So Apple 2022 5.17 eps gives us an after net cash mid 30s PE at a $200 stock price with current business model. Awesome now through in Apple Car and VR/AR.....need I say more?....crazy not to own Apple at these prices....when it’s at 300 in two years you’ll be doing the ole shoulda stuff again lol
"Apple is the safest investment out there. its recession proof. Even if apple fans have no cash left, they would still max out their credit cards and wait in line 5 hours to purchase the latest overpriced gadget."
I will have the sec investigate apple's 135 options ex.
Apple iPhone Christmas Sales Smash Expectations
"I watched the options trading for a little while now and it seems that there is a huge war between shorts and longs taking place. That’s why the stock price is stuck in the $134-$135 range. Basically the shorts need it to be under $134 by Friday close and longs want to drive it over $135. And while the fight this battle full force, we are stuck in a rut. Who do you think will win? "
YOO guys! if i want to open a position in APPL should i wait for a dip or buy right now.. its for long term
Consolidation period is officially over. Time for lift off.
Feels good on a Monday to own thousands of shares of the best company on the planet￼
"From CNBC:” Intensifying speculative behavior among retail investors is causing concern. Heavily shorted names, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, continued to be pushed higher by amateur day traders in online chat rooms. Some investors are worried about mounting losses by hedge funds spilling over to other areas of the market as those funds sell other securities to raise cash. Investors are also concerned the speculative behavior is a sign the market is overvalued and a pullback is near.”"
The car is revving it’s engine. Vroooom! . Wait till Cook calls a formal press conference to announce the Apple car and partnership. Could be looking at $10-15 pop. Maybe more when you take into consideration the Shorts caught with their pants around their ankles. Hehe 
"Somehow Apple always gets thrown under the bus. People do realize Google and the Google play store did the same, right?"
"As long as you can go up, let us earn a point that satisfied! $GOOG $WIMI $AAPL"
"Overall, Apple shipped more than 3.2 million iPhone units in India in 2020, up 60% year-on-year"
"Why invest in stocks, when a company (Apple) makes money, blows out earnings only see see stock get hammered!"
"Hyundai and Apple are teaming up to launch a test version of the ""Apple Car"" next year, with a production capacity of 100,000 units in 2024."
everyone knew the earnings report was going to be good over a week ago===>profit taking should be over by now?...
"ok kids, a short squeeze requires actual short positions, not 0.5% of float."
"I had heard a report on the radio how Apple will likely be the top growth tech stock for a large company in 2021. Apple should lead all the FANG stocks in 2021 as it did this year. The report also mentioned that Amazon's growth will likely slow in 2021. Amazon's cloud service growth is likely to suffer from more competition from Microsoft, Google, Oracle, etc. The cloud service space is finally getting rather crowded sooner than expected. Apple is supposed to remain strong thanks to an iPhone supercycle and a resurgence of Mac sales using Apple Silicon. Bundled Services revenue will continue to grow along with more active devices (a billion+) and a strong customer base. All of Apple's products are in high demand despite the pandemic. Many analysts thought Apple would be hit the hardest during the pandemic but they were wrong, very wrong. Anyway, Apple is supposed to stay strong at least for a couple of quarters in 2021 so that's good for shareholders. It doesn't seem like there will be any major pullbacks for Apple stock in early 2021. We'll see if that strength holds up."
Thank goodness it's Friday. My heart can't take another day!!!
I added to my long position that has been growing since my first buy in 2016. I have been waiting for a pull back like this to add. Messes up my nice and low cost basis but this is my best and largest holding. Glad to throw more money into it on the pull back. Long core holding and best stock next to my amazon and microsoft and LAM Research.
Apple is doing the right thing against FAKEBOOK so I bought on the drop today. Boolean
Do people realize by pumping up a $5.00 stock to hundreds will only hurt a company to access future capital. No fundamentals have changed for Nokia according to executives within the company. This needs to stop. The SEC Needs to halt all stocks that are being played with for 30 days while implementing new trading laws for hedge funds.
Day Um. MicroSoft up 12 point in after hours after they reported earnings. A foreshadowing of what will happen to Apple shares tomorrow!
"I keep saying tmrw will be better day for apple i need to wait, but i keep getting proven wrong"
Shorts are toast tomorrow!
OWN IT DON’T TRADE IT
"today was the sixth time ( multiple of three( AAPL hit $126+ as intra day low:Aug 26, Dec 16, Dec 18, Jan 4, Jan 6 and Jan 12THese lows were followed with a rally back over $130+"
what a golden opportunity to buy more...started 20 years ago and havent sold a share...
I’m confused. Why do we still drop with good news.
This did not go up because of the EV #$%$. It will go up regardless of that..They are making BILLIONS in profits without EV.
Slowly slowly everything is turning positive. So stay focused and stay invested just like me. Additionally years and years of investing experience tells me to stay invested and focused
Foldable screens coming next ! Better buy now !! It will skyrocket to 150 easy ...
"You know what's un American Joe? Not allowing the votes to be audited, how come Joe? There is nothing classified in those machines."

Hey guys I’m a fairly new investor and I’m wonder why with a great earnings report is the stock going down?
"GME is another Tilray in the making, I am baffled how people are buying this!"
"This company is going to $200. Buy now and get in cheap. Soon all of the GME money will be pouring into AAPL, as it is the best investment you can make in the entire stock market."
Sold Apple at $118 threw that at $NIO and that worked out. Sold all my $AMD yesterday and put that in $AAPL yesterday 
This has been consolidating since its split and high around August. It touched a new ATH not long ago and soon that will become new support above $138.00 with a market cap above $2.3T. PT at $150-$160 market cap of $2.5T-2.7T for 2021. (This does not factor buybacks of stock) which is a positive for bulls!
102-145 range patience it's going lower.
138 coming soon
what a joke for Apple to drop this low! should have taken my profits when it hit $147!
Tim Cook is a very mature decision maker!
APPL running to $190 after earnings like morgan stanley was saying. They always predict well.
I read that analysts were disappointed with Apple's Q1 forecast? Like 95 cents for Q1 2021 vs 67 cents Q1 2020. That is still a 45% increase for next Q. Apple is rocking! Apple P/E will be down to about 27.
170+ wednesday?
today apple jumped due to microsoft.
Poor response after the best quarter of the year ...... what if they miss the next 1-2 low-season quarters ?? Crashing ?? lol
Close green today.
"Seriously, how on earth should Apple fail tomorrow? iPhone 12 has huge demand, same applies for M1 devices. Since iPhone drives 50% of the overall earnings I'd expect great figures."
AAPL will be green monday morning. Just face it! :)
Omg Apple in India booming like crazy.. guys India is the next market.. Apple to 3 trillion

Be patients appl will go back up.
"You can down vote, but highly doubt genuine apple fans will want to buy apple cars made by Kia.iKia? (IKEA )Not a good Idea!"
Gonna be a fun week. First $100B quarter.
"Apple, a company with the highest standards in quality, it partnering with....Hyundai? A mid to low tier car maker?"
Are shorts ganging apple now? Seen they lose a lot on small cap
"I love Apple stock, but the fact that it's my only green this morning with my other solid dividend players red,tells me there truly is a HUGE tech bubble.DIVERSIFY !!"
REMEMBER THERE'S ALWAYS A PRICE TO PAY ALL WHAT THE FED IS DOING ONE DAY .....
"1.4 Billion active Apple devices ""out in the wild""There are 8 Billion people in the world.So...17% of the world's population are on an Apple device.I'm 68. My wife had a knee replacement surgery yesterday.It seemed like everyone at the hospital was either holding a device or was actively engaged with their device.I mean....everyone !!!They were all doing their jobs.....but, every moment between tasks was given to staring at their phones.I will say that my iPhone was a lot of help yesterday. While I was in the OR waiting area, someone in the OR sent me one-way texts updating me on my wife's condition. That was very comforting."
"AAPL shorts don’t get nearly all they ask for, but the fact is they get all they deserve."
maybe $150 is in the corner? long this one for now.
"Don't miss out on getting some NOK before earnings tomorrow, set upfor a run."
Apple is a long term play so sit back and enjoy the ride..
"Apple is expected to have finished 2020 with its most profitable quarter ever, and possibly its first with more than $100 billion in quarterly sales. The period was fueled by an uptick in higher-end iPhone sales and a pandemic-induced surge in demand for its laptops and tablets."
I’m bullish on Apple so I have increased my position before earnings :)
"Apple is the market. Once this thing moves, others will follow."
Apple will have huge earning this year that’s what I feel.
"""I've gone to the poor house from owning Apple stock over the long term"" says NO ONE ever."
"Serious profit taking today on increasing volume. Won’t last long, you’ll see"
Big funds are shaking up money tree off the inpatient investors before they start buying again on good ER. Hold on tight!
Why does WS now hate capitalism?Apple 1st quarter net profit is $33.6 billion. That's not annual net–but a single quarter net profit. WS hates winners.
Do not trade apple ! Hold apple ! It’s a licence to print money long term ! Think ahed people! Don’t let hedge funds steal from you !!!
Great time to buy more
This is not an AAPL post but didn't know where to post it. Is OTC safe to invest or just too risky ?
Best advice I can give on an unsubstantiated selloff. Buy and/or turn the ticker off. Check back in six months.
"$GM $F $TSLA $AAPL $XLE $OXY $XOM & $CVX Don’t fall for the whole “OIL IS DEAD JUNK”. We will transition to green energy over the next 20 years. In the meantime, We’ve just begun thr next secular bull market for oil - over the next 12-15 years supply will be constrained by regulators while they push electric cars - but where does the electricity come from to charge the batteries? Natural Gas....Developing countries can’t afford the electric transition. They will first grow their economies on “old” tech - fossil fuels. Oil isn’t dead. It’s a sleeping giant. Get in now."

$145 tom?
"Rod Hall UPGRADE! Haaaah! Remember, I called that a few weeks ago. Check my message history. No doubt another classic shakeout right before earnings as we've seen countless times so Goldman can load up on the shares for its clients before earnings. This is getting old folks... We've seen it done too many times. Apple long. Own it don't trade it."
155 is seeming more and more possible!
Day Traders closing will be here in 1 minute to drop it into close.
FB upset that apple values privacy. Imagine that
"Aapl being sold off to pay for short covering of amc, gme, bb, nakd, ino, srne and others."
Buy Buy Buy ! Apple is on sale!
I bought more at last Friday dip. I think it was a smart move. A help towards my 25% return year end
We are due for several more price target upgrades. We should at least be holding $143.
"Whoever sold at $103, $110, $120 or the last 2days, will buying back at a higher price! remember this happens all the time. LOL!"
"Well boys I bet right this time. I even bet during nice 127 drop there. combined, my options position breaks even at 136 and takes profit at a 11 to 1 conversion. This means a 155 price this Thursday will net me 189% profit. And most of my options expire in March "
Apple car is real. Let’s go to $1000
what is wrong with the stock it should be screaming with the results of the last quarter
Read the charts. I'll be lucky to get back @ 135. Let what is going on finish.
I will dedicate a musical video to you $AAPL! 
Only wish I would have bought more today. Excellent quarter and couldn’t ask for better news!
I did a call option on apple and made some money. I plan on doing another one on monday morning.
Let’s go...profit takers are out. Time to move higher on those jaw dropping earnings and the soon to be Apple Car....oh and let’s not forget AR too
How rich and powerful can Wall Street be when they can literally control this stock and its trillion dollar market cap to pin the stock price for options expiration. I am sorry but this is why the WSB movement will continue.
Ladies and Gentlemen this action is not about AAPl fundamentals but option action.It is a chess game.Everyone was cautioned this may have happened. Go back and read Tuesday's posts.Good Luck
bought the 3.00 dip. thanks
AAPL had its best quarter in India They will be announced tomorrow at earnings
When Apple  hits $160 $143 will look like a bargain
Today's Barron Article on Apple mentions upgrades to the stock while the Stock Price went down. Goes on to mention that maybe Reddit (WallStreetBets) should mention Apple. The funny thing is they did mention Apple today on there message board for today. Interesting!
"I get a laugh at some of you fools taking victory laps. Any real investor knows and expected this could happen at earnings. If you simpletons took a few minutes to digest the ER, you'd know Apple is here to stay and is only getting better. They blew it out the water. Who cares if a few day trading robinhooders are taking their $200 profits"
$140 by earnings dayWho thinks?
"Ah, have to fight the broader market so gains might be muted, but as anyone who follows the Apple today's price is pretty irrelevant to how the market reacts to the earnings. We'll only know that tomorrow, and even that is just short term noise."
If down tomorrow it’s time to retire from Apple. A retiree Long on Apple. As the song says: you got to know when to hold them and you got to know when to fold them. If tomorrow is even flat I will still hold. All depends on tomorrow.
All new 2023 Applentra by Hyundapple
Let’s start the journey back to $1000
buying all dips
Days like yesterday this give Apple a chance to buy it's own stock back with their massive free cash flow. dips in the price are great for long term holders.
There is nothing wrong with Kia! They are assembling the car and apple are designing it ! Let’s not tank sentiment with conspiratorial drivel !
Nice to see AAPL gaining.Unfortunately the increased taxes levied on capital gains will the little guys.
"No way I’m letting my 10,000 shares go before earnings!"
"Strong Buy,Strong Buy,Strong Buy at this current very very low price because very soon It's going to be $200 plus. (very very strong buy)"
Rumor floating $AAPL wants the name and ticker for their new electric car company. I cant find anything on it but will ride the hype.222k at .0006
"When someone tells me AAPL and AMZN are going to do very well in 2021 I simply respond with a resounding DUH! Both these companies provide exactly what consumers want, when they want it and how they want it. Facebook and Netflix could both disappear overnight and no one would care because there are too many alternatives. Apple will blow away earnings as they build an ever-larger user base along with a bevy of innovative products. Happy New Year!"
Here we go again. Same as last year before earnings release. GS had a sell rating on Apple. Apple went up to $400ish then split 4 for 1. I never listen to GS. They want you to sell so they can scoop up your cheap shares before earnings.
Every one of my posts although polite but critical of the current President is getting removed by Yahoo censor within few minutes.Welcome to the United Soviet States of America!
"NO POLITICS HERE KIDS ...STICK TO APPLE, we can all benefit if we keep it clean and only about APPLE news and direct APPLE money ."
Good Luck
"If $MSFT didn’t go up after there great earnings tomorrow, it means $AAPL & $FB will follow the same."
Wow! Today earnings everybody beat by a wide margin including E-Bay etc.
Aapl to buy bb?
It's earnings week kids! Here we go now.
I sold some of my AAPL position yesterday morning and added to my NVAX position. Should have moved more. Have no regrets.
"During a one year pandemic, accompanied by an instant recession, record unemployment and untold business closures Apple prospered. The current administration will lead us into another recession and, once again, Apple will prosper. Why? Because Apple designs and builds products people have come to view as essential to their daily lives. We are all carpenters and Apple sells hammers."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-invest-3-6-billion-012405952.html
That is a first in a long time appl closed up today.
Why in the world would you pick Kia to build your electric car Apple? Bad move!
"What will you do when the market really take a bear ride? This is just a down day for now. Butwhen the bears take over and it drops 8,000+ points will your emotions stand the test of time."
"Rumor is they may announce the ""Apple Car"" tonight!"
"I had a dream AAPL was flirting around 200 on this Q. Also my machine learning says to buy LMT, CRM and MCD tomorrow. These 3 will outperform AAPL to correction territory this week. LMT at 300 on Tuesday. CRM at 240 by Friday. MCD at 230-240 by Wednesday. Enjoy..I have cash reserve to buy these 4 at any given healthy pullback"
just give aapl a day or 2 and it'll start right back in again going back up north...
"Apple will beat Tesla in the fully autonomous car race. And like everything Apple makes, it will be first class."
"All of us need to come together and buy the hell out of AAPL. Buy atleast 10 shares a piece is all I am saying. If someone owes you a favor, have them buy AAPL. Even if we could collectively buy about 5000 shares, we’ll keep the tanking at bay and lose less if not make more on our calls."
Accumulate accumulate accumulate. Don't miss this rocket ship!  
The little battle between AAPL and FB is hurting both companies
Bought the dip 5000 shares in
There is absolutely no reason for this stock not to be @ $140.00 bare minimum right now!. My theory is all these left wing commie hedge fund criminals lost there shorts on GME & a variety of other holdings recently pulled from APPL to cover positions. Market manipulation has been so exposed by these radical left wing commies there time is almost upAPPL will prevail
I posted yesterday that I thought Apple would reach 170 through earnings Wednesday and I feel even more confident that it will reach that target. I’m buying call options for the Jan 29 170 strike. Only time I will play the options but that’s how good I feel about it. Agree?
"Smart investors look forward 5-10 years, this is smart investors buying in now! Enjoy the ride"
Last chance to buy before earnings. I see $147-$150 after earnings.
morgan stanly target is $190 for APPLE. Need to buy some calls before the earnings because it will move massive after the earnings it seems.
Hyundai/Kia builds quality cars as good as any car company. I’m sure they will build the AAPL Cars that will be # 1 and in high demand. GLTA
Thinking about canceling my cybertruck order to wait and see what happens with apple car !
Toyota sold 10 million cars worldwide last year and made a $400 profit per car. Apple sold 300 Million phones and made a profit of $400 per phone.. So I ask you.......do you want to be Toyota or Apple? I’ll answer that for you. You want to be Apple.
Who’s ready for some dog gone green?
"Analysts saying last Q revenue could be $112 Billion...that would break the all time record over 2019 Dec....if that happens, see you at $200 instantly"
"I mentioned in a post not too long ago that if you want to be an Apple share holder then you need to be willing to hold for the long term AND you need to have a cast iron stomach! The last 2 days with Apple shares is exactly what I was talking about. All you Apple shareholders out there, just sit tight and be strong! If you're a weak stomach bleep bleep then go sell and get the bleep out, and don't come back to the Apple family!"
I put tow hundred fifty thousand dollars in Apple  at 121.a shear and I going to let it ride for two years I think it a great deal at this price .So this is what I would do if I was you it going to start going up and before you know it will at 175 a shear and still going up good luck
All bears are saying there is a market bubble all bulls are saying this will go to 300 within a year.Let’s be realistic here. Apple is a very safe investment for the long term and it will always be a great investment. Apple is adapting to the new market coming out with a ev car that will compete with Tesla and have a similar run.Apples financials are amazing and people will always be buying Apple for retirement and will be buying their new products in the future. Invest in the long term and you will be happy
"Ignore all politics for the moment and concentrate on Apple, Inc. We are headed to $200 and beyond as Apple continues to innovate and increase market share."
It took a few years to get to the top of the mountain and now it looks like AAPL going back down the the other side of the mountain. It was a nice run but it may be time to move on.
Sold @ 108/share. Shooting myself in the foot! Bought back much higher. Holding tight this time!!
Apple should hit $150 by this Friday. There will be upgrade reports issued soon.
"AAPL back to its old weekly tricks of being subjected to manipulation, by big money that cashes in on their holdings every Friday. After this interruption, rally resumes on car mania"
Set your sell limit orders to $2600 boys. So shorts can’t borrow your shares.
Bought 100 more shares
Wow!
Wouldn't it be nice if apple suddenly hit the roof like GameStop?
Investors as well as analysts love Apple.
apple needs to do a major acquisition this year and do a reverse split back to 4.3 billion shares outstanding. I will email Tim cook asap.
Steak and lobster dinner tonight.
Msft up 5% AH...preview of Apple tomorrow
"Earnings days are rarely good days....regardless of the numbers. Can’t explain it other than tech stocks do not have risk/reward equality. The risk is high, the reward is low. I’m not sure it’s worth holding any tech thru earnings."
"I have learned a very valuable lesson here. Always do the opposite on people say on these message boards and listen only to yourself. Missed out on $10,000 profit. Will sell a % at $130."
Kia up 14 percent on Apple investment. Apple goes up ? On this Electric Vehicle News...
This will have to close green to expect a gain tmr
"Cramer said OWN IT, DON'T TRADE IT. Don't SELL!"
Finally a respectable up day! Let’s continue tomorrow!
"BUY BUY BUY, AFTER GME NONSENSE APPLE WILL PREVAIL!!!!!!"
"This GS Analyst really hates Apple - ""Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall reiterated his sell rating on Apple (AAPL) shares late Thursday, arguing that the current iPhone upgrade cycle looks more like a typical redesign cycle rather than the “supercycle” some were hoping for. Hall has been bearish on Apple’s stock since April 2020."""
Apple EV. Will look like a phone. It will never change. It will steal ideas. It will require an  only charging station. It will only play  music. It will only take you to approved  locations. It will never take you to a location where speach is acceptable. It will require a background check to prove you are a lib. Big success.
"Grants for engineering programs, 100 new scholarships, and the launch of company’s first Apple Developer Academy in the U.S. in Detroit.This is a good thing."
THE BOOM IS UPON US. $aapl to $500
I will buy more if pulldown. 200 is coming in Q1..patience
"People always look back and go “man I wish I bought Tesla at $200” and don’t notice Apple sitting here with a 10X potential over the next 2 years given it’s exposure into health and fitness, entertainment, cars, music in addition to its core business, which hasn’t even reached its full potential in India and China the 2 most populated countries. WAKE UP"
Made all my losses back from last week plus more already! Told you keep buying those dips it’ll make us rich!
Great earnings next week and then dividends on the following week. No wonder everyone is buying this now. No more shorting this stock!!
"Those who keep posting about Morgan Stanley predictions, you need to do your research on these analyst. They have been wrong on 3/4 of their predictions this year, or told you wrong on purpose, to manipulate you and take your money. That’s the name of the game, and if you don’t do your DD you’ll most likely lose your money over and over, and that’s not just for MS, that’s for all these big hitters, check their holdings and their track record before taking their advise."
$144+ soon.why?It printed twice the past two days...trends of three
"Funny true story my uncle 83 yrs old calls me last week. He knows I day trade stock and tells me my aunt 82 yrs had her dad gave her some apple stock back in the that he bought for like 20 or 30 cents. He said thought it was like 100 or 200 shares. He asked me if I thought it was worth much. I said uncle get off the phone and call your financial advisor you might be in for surprise. Calls me yesterday said the FA said they 7,430 shares of apple at over 1 million. Tells me well that seemed to be a good investment. I almost died. Crazy"
Tony Balooga says to read the MPW CC transcript just posted on the MPW quote page.......and load the boat real soon. MPW is a rapid growth AND income stock. Very much a Steamroller like Apple.......except in Hospitals.
"Options day tomorrow,there will be a load of covering done.a lot of buying in morning so price will rise but by end of day may be slightly negative.maybe close at 135-136.don’t worry climb next week to 140-150 by earnings call.GLTAGo apple "
SOON selling exhausted and with all the upgrades we resume uptrend. thx. buy here
Scary sign for the overall market that they're flat after a blowout. Check out $SKT as a top 10 short interest play.
I’m long but don’t think car thing will move the stock in the short term .
"I’m guessing most of you are holding permanently/long term.But if not, what’s your exit point?I’ve been holding for over 4 years at split adjusted basis of ~$37.I think it’ll be $150-$160 after a good earnings call (if not sooner).There’s only one I’d roll it into if I sold - MO/Altria because the yield is a very tempting and safe 8% and I was starting to think Apple losing steam in a very overheated market.GLTA."
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again ... ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR APPL NOT TO BE AT $150.00 RIGHT NOW!
Bought 500 stocks in March 2017 @ $35. Still wanna hold. I think not bad 
At greg this stock isn’t tesla. Did you ever go to the tractor pulls? They just pull n pull with a steady momentum. Apple just keeps pulling slow n steady to finish line. Yr after yr. its a trustworthy stock thats relatively safe that you can hand down to your kids or grandkids n still have some for yourself.
Apple on sale today for Monday's green bounce!
$111 Billion revenue (IN ONE QUARTER) on 39% gross margins for a $2.3 TRILLION company ! Long & Strong STILL. More upgrades are sure to follow. Forget about any short term hiccups there MAY be. We're good Apple family. Cheers !
"for all those who are wondering why this is happening. the big players have to cover their losses, which they got from what is happening over at gamestop and co. that is why they have to sell the best they have. its actually an opportunity for smaller investors to get apple for a bargain."
We should be up like $10
please no more daily stock predictions about apple. no one on the message board has been accurate ever. waste of time.
"apple could of bought tesla for 1/10th the price it is today and now they want to join hands with a foriegn car maker, tells you something doesn't it. Launder that money, kick back from overseas so they can't track money easily check, check."
Thoughts on open tomorrow?
Happy earnings eve apple fam 
"Question is, do you risk more at these prices before ER or just hold and ride with what you got?"
"So we are getting higher taxes, higher interest rates, and our retirements are going down? It's only been one week"
Earnings coming up with iPhone 12 Holliday sales....buy and hold
down in the morning and up in the afternoon with higher close seems to be the daily pattern now
Guaranteed $134's tomorrow !
qcom is 151now .on sale
the geniuses on the message board says that apple is purposely holding at 135. calling the sec.
Do you guys think this will drop a little before earnings ? I wanna buy more but not this high haha (new)
hope is not a option
Apple won’t go any more lower IMO.. apple did go up today and fell.. Let’s hope for a better tomorrow.
Most of the stocks are tanking today; hold on and don't panic.
We wont have corrections until retail traders refuse to be hedged by market makers selling them puts $GME $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT $FB
I hold many calls for AAPL March19 150$. Is it possible that the market waits for after that date to limit short losses? Not yet familiar with all the strategies used with options.
Msft up nicely today ... preview of tomorrow for Apple
"it's kind of vad if you have call options. but if you own actuall shares you don't have to worry about this, seriously."
"Relax. “Stock markets do perform better under Democrats than under Republicans. That’s a well-known fact, but it does not imply cause and effect,” says Jeremy Siegel, the Russell E. Palmer Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1952 through June 2020, annualized real stock market returns under Democrats have been 10.6% compared with 4.8% for Republicans. -FORBES"
Stimulus 1.9T push aapl to 150$
The run to earnings has begun. Apple will Beat the 27 cent eps estimate by a mile. Look for a huge beat.
Bngo will go to the moon #bngo #gme #amc #tsla #aapl
Another head fake pre market trying to get people to sell! Hold! I bet we’re back in the $140s today
"When it goes back to $138 and higher this week or next, the ones that sold will buy back! How many times have we seen this tape?"
"Don’t worry :) stay strong. Just look at the 1 year, 6 months, 3 months and one month chart :)"
Shares gonna be snapped up today at this price 
IF everyone who sold Jan 29 calls closed out their trades this would run
"why do you guys think that AAPL should keep going up?!? one of the most widely held positions and those earnings were already baked into the price. just have to look at the upgrades which took place BEFORE earnings vs after them. i've been a widely successful trader for over 25 years, made a small fortune, and AAPL is one way i have amassed that fortune. but they are overbought here, should be trading closer to $120, and are funny enough taking FB down with them as the spat between Cook and Zuckerberg continues."
"Welcome To The Cancel Culture Board. Speak against the beloved fruit and you get ""Sell! Go Somewhere else. AAPL is for longs (term) only. Buy GME."" Look at your screens Battling to stay positive!! I'm long 3500 shares and have a right to be disappointed and frustrated! Two earnings in a row followed by a sell off. 6 months at the same price aside from 10 days of hope into earnings. The only go thing I see is that it bounced off resistance at $130. Of course in YEARS from now this will be higher but how about over months like most of the market. I am not saying anything bad about the company, just criticizing the stock performance compared to others. I just realized maybe your all deniers and want to comfort yourself into thinking the stagnent stock price is OK."
Got a good feeling about this week
BUY time for me. LOADING UP 2500+ prior to ER.... #BOOM #BULLRUN $AAPL
"ZERO INTEREST RATES, MORE VACCINES, RECORD BREAKING EARNINGS FROM AAPL SHOULD GIVE IT A VALUATION OF 165 FWD"
"The vast majority of AAPL shares are quietly stashed away in the secure knowledge that they will be worth more with each year that passes. Apple is awash in cash, talent and ingenuity."
got great volume on an increase in SP. Could be starting to run!!
Tomorrow is another day. Isn’t it comforting to know that on a quarterly basis on average AAPL will always show a profit. AAPL for me has been a stellar performer. AAPL long will always deliver.
"I have bought in at 132 and 128..I will buy all dips..remember I am a new one and investor to apple and my target is to make a 25% return.. Will keep you all posted.. My next buy in, if it drops that low would be 119."
What a BEAUTIFUL buying opportunity 
"Apple is going to use KIA as their contract manufacturer. Is going to be like the iPhone. Different components are made by different companies and assembled in Kia’s plant in GA. They are not going with companies like Lexus, Mercedes, BMW because they need somebody to work for them not with them."
The entire market experienced pull back on thursday and friday. I think we have a great set up for a green monday market wide and apple with ride along with that! I say 144 by EOD monday
Looking good pre market
"You would think everyone would be pumping last second additions of this company to their profile before earnings tomorrow but it seems we have an adverse affect here. However after seeing Nasdaq, SP and Dow you can see that half the market is tanking and half the market is rising. This is more broad than just Apple, it’s something else. I’m holding all my shares and calls (calls will be executed come Thursday for me). I see no problems here, just a matter of time really. GLTA and hold! SCARED MONEY MAKES NO MONEY!"
"Not sure why everyone’s ripping on this stock, it has delivered 20 plus (average) annually consistently.invest and leverage, let the compound interest build up for the next 20 years and you’ll be a millionaire depending how much you put in haha"
"Question, sell $AAPL calls tomorrow or keep them a little longer?"
"Does anybody have any reasons as to why Apple just keeps on giving longs blue balls?? I don’t get why Apple is still dropping? Earnings is so close, am I missing something? Was up pre market 1% and now we’re red again... I don’t see any reasons as to why??"
I used to laugh at the guys claiming to be up a million from apple...now I'm one of them. Life changing decision to buy it. The crazy thing is the future still looks bright. Could the best be yet to come?
WILD.TO it’s basically the Netflix of Canada. Apple has partnered with these guys. It’s worth looking into. I see a 1000% gain
"Seems to me if Apple is going to build or incorporate-in a car they would seek the likes of Ford, Honda or even Electrameccanica than Kia."
"Back from the nap lads, what’d I miss......look at after hours price are you kidding me. Looks like we’re riding this into next week. Unstoppable."
"Wed January 27, 2021, 8:19 PMSamsung Net Profit Misses Estimates After 5G iPhone’s Debut(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co.’s profit missed analysts’ estimates and the company warned of weaker first-quarter results as smartphone competition intensified and memory prices remained weak."
"When was the last time you saw someone NOT wearing a mask in public? It's been well over 6 months for me, if not longer. I've asked friends and relatives in other states, and their experience is the same. Yet we have MORE infections and deaths than last year despite CNN, MSNBC, Huffington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR, etc etc telling us all we had to do was wear masks and no one would get infected. There's been side by side comparisons of counties of similar population sizes that mandated masks versus those that did not, and the infection and death rates are about the same. Hmmmmmm."
Computer generated sell off on tech just kicked in at 10:55. Look at Nasdaq and entire tech sector just dropped.
Is Apple partnering with Kia to build an EV car?
"Will explode once ATH is reached. Earnings will prove APPL's value, $200 forward guidance."
Up 170% over past 4 years. Buy and hold!
Wait till you see Apple's mono cell battery.
Take it as a gift that it hasn’t run up off the back of that massive ER. I’m adding tomorrow and been in the stock for a long time. 
Any thoughts on aapl today? Da Vinci?
Don’t be shaken by after hours ! When the normal people with functional intellects get to trade we will see fair price discovery 
"Im hearing big news around getting into electric car market, the next step to apple ruling the world. Anyone been watching NAKD?"
Up 11% (+$200B in market cap) in 5 days on no news. When did AAPL turn into another Ponzi scheme?
"Futures down 165 and 77 thanks Joe keep those green executive orders coming, you can never lose enough jobs!"
"Apple climbs steadily. It doesn’t do 10% gains in a day. Those of u calling for 160 by Wednesday are being far too optimistic. It will get there, just not Wednesday"
Aapl setting for big run after earnings.
Apple is headed to $400 by December 2021. The futures are up sharply. They will be up even more sharply same time tomorrow
Investing 3.4b in Kia Georgia Plant.....
"Those that sold upon Apple removing Parlor, nice job!"
This stock goes down so quick but takes weeks for it to climb. Tf is going on with this one
Most stocks are on top price now. Only Apple is still 10 points below its tip. A great BUY opportunity today.
"You don't buy Apple stock because you like their products. You don't buy Apple stock because you like or dislike their political views.You buy Apple because you want to ""make money"".....it's that simple."
AAPL is in rally mode
"Apple also declared a cash dividend of $0.205 cents per share and said that it had spent over $30 billion on total shareholder return, which includes share buybacks, during the quarter. Apple’s first fiscal quarter is typically its largest of the year and includes critical holiday sales during December."
"I heard Toni Sacconaghi on CNBC today. If you don't him, he's purportedly the #1 Apple analyst. I have followed him through the years and he's never been right, always bashing the company, always wrong. I could never understand that. Today it was different. He made a very strong case for the car, etc. Make the effort to bring up the video. It's good."
big traders playing after hours ... low insignificant volumes to make us retail investors believe something is wrong and then we sell they buy at discount..................HOLD
Please keep apple down so I can keep adding before takeoff
We need to go to $138 today please
"WellI'm kinda disappointed, i bought 10 shares at their all time high of $141 just 4 days ago, then it started going down slowly"
don't forget to sell before earnings. expect a 10 points drop in after hours.
Futures once again looking good!!
i got calls at 141 jan27
"Going to sell my x, cat and tlry to buy more aapl!"
Nice discount if it drops when market open  buy the fear always do not buy the rally  sell the rally but Apple did not even rally
"1) buy AAPL, 2) Hold (no matter what), 3) Repeat"
Before making any decisions when it comes to Apple keep the record earnings in mind and remember the innovative pipeline they are going to churn out ! There is so much Upside to Apple stock over the next 5-10 years so buy and hold people ! People power can squeeze out the parasite shorts !
If aapl isn’t up tomorrow then no other stock deserves to go up tomorrow
Not unusual. These are the people who are new to the market or can’t afford to lose anything. They over react to the herd. Patience. Let the storm pass. It always does. Look at the 20 year history for comfort.
Algorithm players expected $130+ after $126+ intra day low at open.

I suspect a prototype concept car out in 2022-2023. He’ll they probably have one now partially built. You know gm and Ford design cars two years ahead of when they go into production
"Peter Lynch, one of the greatest investors of our time for those who don't know him, said let your winners run. That means never cut or reduce your holdings when you have a winner. Always remember that. Let the winners run. That basically translates to own it don't trade it. :)"
AAPL is a little sleepy today.
So happy to see futures are green!!!
"Guiseppe is crying very hard. Shorts are out to night for a reason futures green, big bounce back Tomorrow. Watch apple jump big going in dividend record date 8th of Feb."
bounce back tomorrow. going to sleep? check the futures
138 close this week
I guess if you wanted to buy you could buy now or tomorrow at $150?
AAPLE always does better 3 days after earnings!

"Multimedia and rouge investors are using bad news for the reddit trades to drive the prices down for a better buying point of Apple stock ,then one pulls out another and takes over long or short."
We open Green tomorrow!
"Just in case you are wondering, if they raise corporate tax, Apple will just let is money offshore like it always did. The only impact it will have is they will stop to bring profits to the US... zero impacts on EPS."
Bought 1000 shares at close
"Apple's latest AR/VR patent can capture biological information such as chewing, blinking, smiling, raising eyebrows and opening mouth."
I will never sell my AAPL but we are only up $6.00 from post split. Hoping we recover next week.
Volume has been huge. This translates into consolidation.AAPL hit an intra day year high at $145.01 then dropped 10% to $130.21 this past week.A 10% dip is not uncommon for AAPL after a run to a new high.
"Well well well, BLM activist arrested for participating in the riot at the Capital, guess cumala will have to start a fund to bail them out."
Hold Tight to Apple ! It’s going up $169 by Feb 11 !
"All markets are going down. Apple as well but only less than 1%. When the whole market is going up again, apple is going higher than other"
"This will close $130 today, then $134 end of weekand then pop around $140 to $140-$144 around and after earnings.Thumbs up if you agree."
"$145.05 After hours is all time high. Or 4 cents below it, close enough."
"Canaccord boosts Apple target to $150 from $145 on 'strong' iPhone demandCanaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley raised the firm's price target on Apple to $150 from $145 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. Apple continues to demonstrate the strength of its product ecosystem, Walkley tells investors in a research note. The analyst anticipates ongoing double-digit growth for Macs, iPads and services. He increased estimates for Apple ""with strong demand for the new iPhone 12 products."" iPhone sales in Q1 could reach double-digit growth despite a tough comparable, Walkley says. He believes Apple shares are ""compelling"" for long-term investors."
"Let’s see if I got this right January 27 Apple announces its best ever quarter and since then, two days later, the stock is down over 10 points.Why?"
"Looking back on the last 4 earnings release, only one time was there a slight pullback the next day. I think it was April’s. Very slight, the other 3 were up the next day by 3-9%. So I’m thinking $148-$150 at closing bell Wednesday and a $158 close next Thursday."
At the end of the day fundamentals will rule. AAPLS fundamentals are very strong. the smart thing to due when AAPL goes down like this is just buy more. Ot will well be worth it in the long run.
I don't mind this hanging around this level for now. When earnings come it will explode possibly 10%....$140.00
"I made a big mistake buying this stock a month ago, i was ahead 30k and now its diminishing to nothing. Tesla was the stock to own, Wall Street played it perfect and made plenty on it. Apple will be like P&G, stable but no real gains for a long time. They need to get the Icar out and then we can relive Tesla all over again."
AAPL hardware in biggest demand in yrs! ...and we are not in common 5G mode YET... Worldwide!
"If you sold today, you’re weak. Q4 earnings are coming out for apple shortly. this stock will soar. apple + holiday season = boost in stock price."
"I can't imagine selling AAPL or MSFT after their positive reports. Whatever happens tomorrow, I'm guessing they will both be higher in 3 months. Obviously, I'm a buy and hold type."
From the UK is there some holiday today?
"After blowout ER, AAPL’s usual MO is to drift upward over the course of the qtr, just enough and under the radar to gratify patient longs, and frustrate weekly option gamblers..."
This will fly to $300 plus by the $AAPL news soon $NIO
apple needs to break up the company into 5 operating companies. each segment will increase shareholder value to 3.5 trillion market cap.
"APPL makes a profit and pays their debts is what I like about owning AAPL. A few years ago one of my competitor's did 10-15 times the business that I did but in a short while they were in bankruptcy, but I was making profits and paying my bills."
Tomorrow will be interesting.after hours volume was almost 20 million. I read some one posted a few hundred thousand.People need to post facts.Good Luck
"Monday will be a great start for earnings, let's hope it breaks 145.."
This is just a pullback and it’s an oversold pullback ! Income investors should hold hold hold !!
Beat with good guidance and we’re looking at $150 - $160 if we don’t get near prior to.
We are the Champions.
Nice finish for the day.
Good news is you might get a $2000 check. Bad news is your taxes probably going up $4000.

"cook likes that the stock does nothing each day. I told him to surprise the market, and he wasn't interested."
The market is a very strange- earnings & numbers mean nothing-highly manipulated
Apple is up very big over the last couple of years. Odds are you have big profits. Nothing wrong with taking some and planting a few seeds in the baby Apples of the world. Apple won’t go up 100% this year.......but lots of other stocks will go up 200% this year. Find a few. Build your wealth.

Market sell-off so investors have more money to pour into Apple after the bell tonight.
Giddy up after bell. Thumbs up for green. Thumbs down for red.
"Too many calls that need to expire worthless this week, so price will be wash traded flat. But option action negligible next week, so AAPL allowed to climb Monday"
"Friday’s closing will show AAPL at 140+. The nay sayers will Still be in their perpetual denial a bunch of morally decayed greedy lying shorts. Longs, our perseverance is our Virtue. Be long stay long and be rewarded."
21% growth yoy. Unreal.
AAPL raised iPhone production 30% - the number will blow the lid OFF
Close up $5+. You can do it.
Tesla up again. only 35 points. 100 % invested in Tesla. this is too easy. momentum chasing momentum. this is a dream come true. it is like a broken slot machine paying off each day.
"As earnings season winds down and once again Apple proves to have the best results and most potential, buyers will pile back in again...nothing better"
"Futures turned green, by opening bell AAPL and all three indexes will match. Green Day tomorrow."
When we get to 400 wake me up.
Don’t bet against America.
Should be at same price of amazon and Tesla!
adding apple will be 150 soon
Other car manufacturers are drooling for iCar and they can’t wait to jump on it. They will bend over to Apple. As long as iCar is in the pipeline we will skyrocket to Tomorrowland!!! Let’s go!
"Unbelievable! $AAPL Mega BUBBLE got PUMPED again! AAPL is the The MOST OVERVALUED and the MOST CROWDED, MOST OVERBOUGHT BUBBLE in history..."
Keep in mind Hyundai makes it’s own luxury brand Genesis. Those cars are no joke. The Genesis G70 was the 2019 Motor Trend Car of the Year. Really? Yup it sure was. https://www.motortrend.com/news/genesis-g70-2019-car-of-the-year/?galleryimageid=2311041
Apple is going to buyback stock with the bonds they sold at 1.85%. It doesn't take much effort to get a return on investment at that price. Further they believe stock price will approach 180-200 level by year end with the company going forward with electric vehicle in 2024.
The best company on the planet should be down when the overall market is green . This will close green but pennies .
this should easily be over 160 after this enormous ER
Up up up ....Casino gamestoppers welcome and buy a real stock ... actually best ever stock in history....
Some people are saying the futures are green. I read the market sank. I’m hoping it recovered. GO AAPL.
"FED Manipulation reaches maximum level! Despite so much terrible news, Dow Jones BUBBLE gets PUMPED by 1000 points in 2 trading days. It used to take 10 years to add 1000 points. Now all US Stock indexes are getting PUMPED like a scam micro cap company every single day!$AAPL $AMZN $JPM"
Shorts are out in full force! Sleep well tonight boys! I know I will!! AAPL will rock going forward!
It's because of all these GME Robinhood kids that Apple is taking a tumble like this!
I like AAPL's privacy feature. FB needs to be destroyed.
for all who are selling their shares due to apple's decisions regarding parlor or any other media platform. go ahead and sell your shares . the insignificant amount of shares you have will make no difference to a company who has 17 billion shares outstanding and 2.3 trillion market cap. basing your investment decisions on emotions and not DD you will lose everytime.
social media has completely changed the dynamics of the market. you really dont know in which way your stocks could be targeted
Holding strong on a -300 Dow.

And again the proof that this is an univestable market .. no logic whatsoever. Wait until dust settles
"Futures looking good, tomorrow will be a beautiful day."
"Happy investing very good perspective but here is the reality no matter how or who try’s to manipulate this stock, It will fly to $200 plus sooner than later this year guaranteed"
"The Price of Oil is Skyrocketing FOR NO REASON! Now they PUMPED Oil BUBBLE well above Pre-Pandemic levels, DESPITE Shrinking Demand and Skyrocketing Supply... Now we have a Massive Oil Price BUBBLE!ENJOY! KEEP GAMBLING in this Stock and Oil BUBBLE!$XOM $AAPL $AMZN $JPM $CVX"
I hope this week sets off a bunch if algorithms and makes this stock pull a Tesla.
"what's fugazy is AMC is up 300% from reddit, and Apple blows away earnings and can't stay above a downside close.."
Futures green because of Apple 
It can only be a good for Aapl that the new administration is so proactive with fighting Covid and pushing for helping Americans in their time of need.
"AAPL sold 18M iPhone 12 units in China market in Q4, exceeding expectations..breaking news an hour ago"
My advice for what’s it’s worth...your portfolio only needs 2 stocks....AAPL for growth and ABBV for growth and dividends. Your % mix dependent on your age.
"just have patience I have over 300 stocks my average is $110, it will sky rocket. I will keep it long term.in past I had 1000 stocks of  Had to sell it needed money, made almost $90000, I am back in investment and I know this stock will not disappoint you. long term and u will gain more than u expected."
Tomorrow I bet stock will rebound!
I told everyone to buy Google and Amazon before earnings and I was 100% right.
"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Kia Motors' stock just had its best day in more than two decades after news media in South Korea reported that it was closing in on a major deal with Apple.The automaker's shares closed up 9.7% in Seoul on Wednesday, reaching 97,700 Korean won ($87.70) per share. That's the highest level since August 1998"
LETS GO!
Don’t be surprised if it drops right before earnings.... stay in y’all!!
You don’t trade Apple. Hold. This will be taking off eventually and you won’t want to miss it. Beet quarter ever abs we drop...yah...ok.
I am already making money. Bought at 15 minutes prior to market close... took a cut off massive gains with GME/AMC and purchased GOLD/AAPL.... I am already up afterhours.. .TY... APPLE BOOM
"Just for comparison purposes, about Apples P/E of 40. Amazon P/E 95, Netflix 87, Tesla 670....got it??"

I love the smell of profits in the morning.
"listen to the news and their call , they have awesome future plans are coming. Apple a day keeps the doctor away... Apple stock will keep your worries away ..keep investing"
Apple has 16.79 billion outstanding shares. It dwarfs any company I know of. I’m wondering if the last split wasn’t such a good idea after all
"Lots trade and view this board....over 114 as I write this....Here is my question....How many have an idea about Stock VALUATION, vs just hoping the stock price keeps going up? Give a Thumbs up for Valuation, Thumbs down for you just care about price."
"So some are complaining about down .43 cents today.It was up 3.45 yesterday.Some people on here aren’t investors at all,they have zero perspective.Stocks fluctuate,good ones move up more than down.Apple was up 80% last year and 100% in 2019.What do you want?Buy GME or take risks with FD.V or other speculative stocks.Apple is not speculative,it’s a investment.Learn the difference."
I bought after hours. Trust in truth. Truth = beating EPS/revenues Q over Q is facts. I am accumulating since yesterday. I know shorties will be wipe ou very soon in pre market like gamestop or delta airlines. So keep buying is the key. It will gap-up in pre market above 150. trust me. Ive been in this one 20 years. Just keep buying unicorns
How you not buy AAPL when Pelozi with inside info is buying it... we are going to $200 in 2021
Begging of a historical run
"Too good to be true, just bought more shares..."
Is this the AAPL forum or a Trumpet support group?
Best part of being an Apple investor? You literally get paid for doing nothing.
"One thing I’ve learned is not to ever, ever, ever, ever worry about apple share price. It will rise again. Take a break and look back in a week or two."
"Bought the dip at 137.75, AH ....you kidding me? Big beat, best necessary company in the world! Too easy..."
"Gotta love stocks like Tesla that are magnetized to their price targets. Apple, it goes the other way. Joke."
"Smashing Top line earnings: 104B, 1.53 per share. Add in: dividend increase, new projects apple car and VR, 2021 year long projections"
Come on Apple! 
Verizon beats! Probably due to 5G iPhone sales
"Apple App store continues to post strong revenue growth… The average sell price (ASP) per download grew 29% y/y, which is a high level of growth compared to historical, with ASPs up 44% y/y in China and 26% y/y ex-China. Overall, we model Apple Services revenues growing 18% y/y in the Dec quarter. We model a slight slowdown to 15% y/y growth for the Mar quarter, but then back to high-teens y/y growth for June and Sep quarters (17% y/y, each). While we expect Services revenue growth to remain strong, other categories which benefited from COVID19 work from home (like iPad and Mac sales) should continue y/y comps in 2021."
Is there a phone alternative that does not have operating software owned by Apple and Google? I want nothing to do with these companies.

"The only thing that makes sense in these uncertain times is having the newest, coolest Apple Phone. Everybody needs to have one. It’s the key to success and path to happiness."
I get people are depressed by the open but you should all bear in mind the ex dividend day is today and you should take a hard look at the options market ! It explains the dip ! This dip is an opportunity people ! Don’t let the big boys be the only takers !
easy to cancel Facebook and Twitter. apple on the other hand won't feel anything from this
17 B shares? What a joke. NEVER should have split this
"Based on the record setting quarter, I'm revising my dividend forecast. Beginning with the April/May dividend and continuing for the rest of the year, Apple will most likely raise the quarterly dividend between 8 to 12%. If I'm correct, I will claim full bragging rights. :)You don't necessarily invest in Apple for the dividend itself but hey at least it helps. I've always reinvested my dividends in the past, and have had zero regrets at this point."
I am not buying a new car until 2024. Watch out Tesla here we come!

GREED--NO GOOD!! Just my 2 cents?? Apple--long and strong!!"
Apple + Kia
"Big Apple fan. Love the products, money maker, but I’ll admit the stock is a head scratcher. I get that stocks don’t move up big every day. But just released best qtr. of all time. Today Nasdaq up 209 points. Tesla up 4%, FB up 2%, Goog up almost 6% AH, NVDA up 2% and yet, AAPL is up a 1/2% and down AH. It’s getting real old."
"Great to see every short on here singing the blues. Attempting to convince average joe in believing that the ""apple car"" is old news. Shorts are on there hands and knees right now praying they can scare off enough people. Good luck you shorts this is going to the moon now and I can't wait to see you all pay the price for it."
Apple car with KIA is fake news!
Don’t let hedge funds steal from you! Buy Apple Hold Apple and Profit from Apple 
Who wouldn’t want to own it??
The fact that Tesla rebounded quicker than apple is shocking since there earnings was nothing compared to MSFT fb and apple
Of all for car makers Apple joins up with Kia? Thought Apple was American proud. Disappointing for sure!
"A golden opportunity to dump this zombie cellphone company for a couple of bucks higher. An honest question, what is the synergy with a cellphone company and a car manufacturer?"
Come On AppleGo Green
Notice how Zacks (and everyone else) strongly recommends AAPL as a great investment...but they leave out we have to put up with this manipulation #$%$ every Friday
200 by October
TSMC is to report earnings this week on Jan 14th. If they post solid numbers expect Apple to skyrocket as well.
I believe Apple will be green before the end of the day.
Wedbush raises price target to $175.
Hold on to your shares Sally...you'll never time the market. You don't sell Apple. You buy and HOLD!
D Day...for new high for Apple

No resistance all the way to $142. Bought another 200 chips ! Blue sky is the correct answer. :)
AAPL is profitable and running on all cylinders into the future. Everyone who owns it should be pleased.
It seems almost every time Apple is expected to have record breaking earnings the market is down.
Just amazing. Now down over $8 since ER
Game Stop profits will rotate into AAPL and TSLA on any pullback. Young guns are gaming the system. Good to see young players making money and getting into the markets. It’s easy to get rich over a lifetime. Just reinvest dividends and let compounding interest work it’s magic.
Love the stock and the company but men this thing is volatile
Appl watch rumored to feature blood glucose monitoring. HUGE if true. Gamechanger! LFG!
"the slow decline is shareholders with hundreds of millions in Apple stock selling out to sub 100 lots, over and over"
AAPL being punished for generating $111B has proven that the market has crossed over from a majority where fundamentals used to matter to a roulette wheel of crowdfunded future speculation. I think this was driven by TSLA multiplying 18x in 15 months. Now the majority of the market are just looking for the next similar return
$145 SEEMS FAR AT THIS POINT:/
"everything is out of stock. stimulus 2000= aapl at 160, as aapl product will be in more demand. up over 145 tomorrow"
All you need to know about investing is Tim Cook & AAPL. Today is another big day for AAPL. GLTA
going back for new 52wk hi just in time for a record Quarter.....hope people are taking their position now
Shorts are having a rough day...
"Scare tactics. This drop is directly correlated to what’s happening in the broader markets and the fact we just had earnings. Give it a few days, we promise"
If Apple has blowout earnings what do you think it will do to the stock price today?? AH??
Apple: Oinker stock!
watch this take off tomorrow.
don't put your full trust in Yahoo after hours glitches happen not just with Apple hold long stay strong great earnings coming
If Apple is actually building an EV they should in my opinion install electric generating solar windows and panels to extend the mileage and lower the cost of operation. I read that the Chinese EV companies are moving in that direction. The company that came to my attention recently that appears to have the most advanced technology is Clearvue Technologies CVUEF. I hope Apple doesn’t let those Chinese competitors get the jump on them.
Rumors is heating up againI car with Hyundai Should apple acquire nflx or pton?
Sean is a real downer...no idea why he even here????
Just not our day.
If anybody tells you this is going down on here is because they are shorts!!
Definitely $400 on its way. Futures turned around beautifully and why shouldn't they!
It held 130 on the worst day the market has seen since October. I’d say that’s pretty phenomenal as a long play.
"It will be almost in 3 years. Tesla and China's NIO, XPEV, LI will flood the market with electric vehicles."
Nice day aapl
"No rush to buy at these prices when car will not be available until 2024. With earnings past us, I'm not seeing catalysts for markets to go higher."
"Totally dumbfounded today! Dow and Nas soaring .... FB, MSFT, NVDA up big! AAPL posts record earnings, upward revised price targets and it can't go green! Total insanity !"
"$4 dollars is a hard stay. Hoping this closes up $8 and continues through next week until earningsWE ARE MAKING UP FOR WHAT WE LOSS, then earnings."
Hope this is just an early hour consolidation
A winning equation? $GOEV + $HYMTF + $AAPL = $TSLA + the rest of EV
Car
This is very scary right now
price upgrades. $150-180
very confused by this drop from 143 to 133 after those earnings.. have investors completely lost their minds? I wish I had a fortune to move over into this right now. My other holdings are strong and I don't want to sell but this discount is making it extremely tempting.
FEBRUARY 19th $130-$135 CALLS. BUY THEM CHEAPER AS AAPL GOES LOWER.AVERAGE DOWN. 
"Cars, cars, cars  another good day to be an Apple long. On the way to 200 eoy"
The stock price of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has received a price target increase from $140 to $155 by Wells Fargo.
This is a coiled spring
The lack of guidance was the trigger. I’m long and don’t care about today. Ready to buy more
"Today's drop is part of the healthy pullback of the uptrend. Uptrend continues to 200 in Q1. Not every day is green day in stocks. It has to go gradual to be healthy, I will buy more at the opening. I feel Nasdaq100 has beat earnings by majority. I feel correction and short squeeze will come eventually to AAPL. EPS/revenues speak!!! no reason this low with solid earnings. Divergent here. Pop will come. I will accumulate every $1, in the end 150 breakout will come tomorrow or Friday at any given time. You will see"
Got in big at $107-109. I’m so excited. 2307 shares
so when will earnings be public tomorrow pre or post ?
Designed by apple made by Kia
I’m guessing investors that did very well with the Tesla run up they would shave some profits and buy Apple  at a discount.
"Big money will not invest in tech companies embroiled in social engineering.It is as plain as that.Cook think because AAPL is so large, it is teflon."
"Reddit’s army has joined. Shorty, you know the drill! Let’s go!!!"
Adding 500 shares @131.3 last Friday. I will hold at least a year until Appl reach $200
Apple car  beep beep to $1000 one day
Patience fellow longs. Next week we will see this return to where it should be.
... and”hedge funds” is the scapegoat phrase of the day once again on this message board. Lots of novices need a boogeyman to make sense of things.
$8 BILLION revenue beat! Simply amazing. Hold your shares until you are retired. Ignore the ups and downs. What a juggernaut
Nice move by apple to kick the sell side analysts and shorts. Will cross $200 by end of year
"Apple is falling like a rock in a lake with no bottom. I have no other option than wait for this stock to go up because I bought in higher. I want to be optimistic, but last couple of days have made it hard to look on the bright side."
Heading to 150 today let’s go 
Oppenheimer increased its price target on Apple (AAPL) to $160 from $125 following better than expected Q1
"This year is definitely the year of APPLE. As a retiree it is such a pleasurable experience to check AAPL quote on my APPLE phone numerous times a day and I am practically never disappointed, now that is a routine every retiree should experience."
Will day traders wake up and understand Apple is not a trading stock? Look how fast it can turn! Could be on the wrong side of the trade more times than not! Longs win
 Apple  $150 after earnings! Easy
Once the hype over GameStop is over. People will be taking their money and investing it in companies that actually make money like Apple.
Should I buy more shares Monday?
News flash for new investors: Stocks occasionally go down too. Even the best ones.
it's time to see lift off
Apple VR
Lol the nasdaq barely up not even .01 and people are talking about Apples performance. The bounce will come and it’ll be a vicious!
This guy says this is the best time to dump aapl after record earnings and a sudden 5% dropfor no reason.
Bank roll $150.
"If Apple can win 2% of the global ev car market, will be equal to iPhone business. Put that in your pipe and smoke it! Stay long stay strong "
enjoy those dividends!!!!
"Yo. Apple needs Kias production facilities. It’s not going to be a Kia, it’s going to be an Apple made car in a KIA factory. I also heard they hired some OG porsche designer to lead the design. AAPL proving again that it will always be relevant, whatever industry they choose to enter, they make products better. $500 within 5 years."
"FB & AAPL will report strong earnings report, $AAPL is still at discount price, not a bubble at all ."
CNBC just had a big segment on Apple . Everyone expecting a breakout
Not only it was a blowout... But Apple is still in the ‘early innings’ amid strong 5G iPhone sales. 1Q 2021 is going to be yet another blow out! That is with discounting any announcing regarding iCar.
Dividend increase and a $100 billion share buyback coming.
when the Apple Car comes will this skyrocket or plummet?
One word : Buy !
Apple is a Tech Company Period !Tim Cook took Apple into the Political Theatre Tim Cook should Step Down and then Enter Politics as and individual Then Apple can return to being the Great Tech Company that it is !!APPLE NEEDS TO BE NON POLITICAL PERIOD
“The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient”. Warren Buffett
I was expecting much much much better.about 150 billion. This stock will sell of 80% tomorrow
"Apple is definitely not going to pursue its own search engine in a distant future, because Apple CEO Tim Cook is having some top priority projects under his wing now, such as Apple cars, Augment reality, podcast and streaming, healthcare and so on… So he doesn't like his work to be done in a rush and ended up a lemon which will tarnish ""APPLE"" brand reputation.Apple will continue it's to growth and thrive… Reputation is part of its biz moat."
So happy I bought at the lows today hahaha
I previously said $150 after earnings over 1 month ago. Now i believe AAPL will hit $155 after earnings tmrw.
"my entire household...wife and sons are all apple people....i am microsoft, andriod and google /google phone all the way...but this company looks like the value is there...show me the money"
"Jump on the bandwagon, AAPL is going higher...Goldman and the biggest holders are all prepping for the “surprise” rally."
"Apple has been working on an EV for years... now is time to put the vehicle into a production facility...all will be surprised with the vehicle when it comes out as a prototype sooner than later... it will be amazing. They will raise the bar on battery life, interface and have style like their other products..."
"wishing everybody luck tomorrow..., this needs to move..."
If it gains $750 billion in market cap it will be a $3 trillion company. Probably happen before you think.
"AAPL we be fine. Temporary weakness. Also, Pick up some TTD Calls before earnings imo."
Where can you find after hours info?Thanks
Bring on the buy backs!

"On days like this, it's best to turn your screens off and not look at the price. Just remember the fundamentals of the company are exceptional and the company will be announcing new products in the coming years. With Apple, you always win long term. Even the greedy hedge fund managers and MM's can't manipulate the price if you hold long term. No super computer or other advantage they have can beat a long term holder."
Just bought shares
Any one knows tomorrow at which time apple will announce its report?

Apple reached an all time high at 143.07
Aapl up $3.00 pre market ...this could be a really good opening.
Accumulated...
"As the ""Board Historian"" allow me to discuss what has happened in the past.Except for the release of iPHONE 6, AAPL eventually pulls back each fiscal year. THis year also may be the exception.Whenever everyone is playing weekly calls for explosive rally the BIG BOYS postpone that rally until the following week. Therefore, a smart move would be to sell 50% of your positions that are probably up 200=% to date at the gap up in the am.A conservative play for whomever bought at $126,you can sell a Jan 22 $145 call for $21 tax deferred cash per share in your pockets tomorrow.. This gives you 30% return on AAPL for 2021 but you must give AAPL away at $145 + $21 = $166.It was posted ""Investors have the filed until AFTER EARNINGS. . It has had a 15% run."
consistency... a small dividend... a moat... and a must-have iPhone familial relationship... AAPL seems like a very profitable utility company... in perpetuity
"I’m rich now, like you Thanks for all the moral support to holdLove you all !"
"I fully expect this to take off once earnings is released. If it happens to dip some, just means we buy more shares. If you are in Apple, you arent in here for a quick buck. You are ok with the build and stack approach."
"Owning Apple stock over the long term is the equivalent of having a tree that grows money on it's branches in your back yard. I've held my Apple shares since 2006 and my investment of $89K have grown into almost 3/4 of a million dollars. I'll reach Apple millionaire status when Apple shares get to $200/sh, presumable by summer of 2022..."
Join me in a big WOW!
Apple will be the first $3 Trillion company after the ER next week...SPY will be over 400
"Goldman raised their PT on Apple from $75 to $85 this morning based on brisk China sales. Grudging as it is, even they recognize a blowout earnings report is coming!"
Maybe ride an up market wave today rather than drowning in it!
Kept trying to tell option traders to not hold for earnings. This is why. But you guys think im trying to short the stock. Long term apple will go to the moooon.
"Green air, less jobs, stock market taking a hit...but you just wouldn't listen"
Fidelity States that their Account Holders increased by 19% in 2020. So more people are investing for the future
Do any of the underinformed cheerleaders here that keep buying at these levels know that in 2018 the earnings were greater than 2020?
Wow what if apple makes chips and software for EV. Every other EV will have software and chips from another company. Apple could do it all. Throw in apple battery tech and things may look very profitable.
140$ coming right up!
That’s why the hedge fund guys didn’t receive any sympathy from people when GME squeezed was on. How can apple put in a record earning and still not going up while Tesla missed and has gained more than 10% since that? The powers that be doesn’t see this manipulation?
"Almost only counts in playing horseshoes and grenades.While AAPL dipped into $126+ in after hours, today it looks to gap at open and run128.44 +1.30 (1.02%)Before hours: 7:42AM EST"
as a long who supports Apple if you hate the stock then sell and get off the MB tired of reading all the negative #$%$
pre market looking good
Deal with it! It’s going higher next week! Buy Buy Buy!
"So, you mean all we had to do was print enough money to expand our national debt by 25-40% to get projected GDP growth of 2.6% through 2025? What a great return on investment!! Why not increase spending by 100% or 1000% WHOOOPEEEEE!!! SMH"
This economy is about to boom.......because I get my first vaccine shot a week from today. This means the Las Vegas economy will spike in late March.
Frustrating. Should be following up gains with solid green markets.
"Mr Powell hasn’t said a single word that wasn’t already known. Call it what you want, this is profit taking."
get on the boat before earnings or you will be left waving goodbye from the dock!
I expect AAPL will be back over 137 by close today
Looking at Apple going forward one has to be excited at the prospects of the products coming out to include Apple Glass and the Apple Car. I'm not a short term trader and invest in companies over the long term. This stock is cheap at these levels and one will see by year end. As the analyst from Wedbush stated he could even make a case for a 225.00 price target. So if your looking for an investment going forward that is safe Apple is it. They are even likely to buy back stock as I hear in regards to the bonds they sold. So you might want to beat Apple repurchasing stock which will push stock price higher.
I know it’s old fashioned to mention PE ratios but look at the PE of AAPL. It’s pretty high compared to its historical average. Not giving any future guidance yesterday was a mistake and hence the stock is down
"Profit taking and shorting is why it is down! I’ve seen this time and time again! Tomorrow I will repurchase share I sold at $139! APPL will go up! Just gotta have patience! With all the news...did you really think the share price was gonna skyrocket? Sell the news! In any case...ain’t nothing stoping AAPL! Long and strong is best method! I just like to sell when there is a significant bounce in price, then buy back in a few dollars less! Good luck all!"
think stock will double this year?
"bought more shares on the way up, lets all get rich on this stock"
Apple in discussions with numerous global automakers
"It went down foe a week, it could very well creep up all week into earnings"
I guess all these new investors have never seen an after-hours mismatch before 
"with no commission fees anymore, its easy to average in a little at a time"
Apple will closed at$133.00 today because strong volume with o/I price range $131-$133.00.
"Will skyrocketing by Monday after all the calls expire today, look at the volume!"
"The decline came despite glowing reviews for the quarter from Wall Street. Barron’s counted at least 16 analysts raising their targets for Apple’s stock price, and we may well have missed a few. The company had double-digit growth in every product category, with record revenues in every geographical market. It reported a huge rebound in sales in China, and achieved gross margins that were more than a full percentage point higher than expected. The company continues to repurchase vast amounts of shares: Facebook (ticker: FB) announced a $25 billion buyback program on Wednesday, but Apple bought back that much stock in the December quarter alone. ------- Then it must be Hedge Funds & brokers?"
"a company like Game Stop ,with little substance is skyrocketing and aaple can't even cross 150.00 give me a break."
"Unfortunately, it is going to be a down day for Apple today. Just a rumor about the investment in Kia. I predict price, at the end of trading, $132"
"Earnings call after the bell, gonna be a good one $150 is in the horizon"
$400 by December 2021
Record quarter 
Look back at my comments I predicted Apple 110b revenue. And someone commented that t is too high a prediction.. look what now?
glad I got in before earnings
"Up $2, down $2....yawn. Long"
Apple to $140 today on late session surge.
AAPL annual meeting is 2-23-21. As a share holder you have the right to vote in an election that might affect your investment. If you are a shareholder don't miss your chance to make your choice. As an example Al Gore is up for reelection to AAPL board
"The weak people who are selling right now do not have the constitution to be in the stock market! Buy, hold and stay the course ! Turn that fear off and apple will take you to the moon "
"You can look at it as a $3.45 a share gain or you can look at it as it added $54 billion in market capitalization in one day. Either way, it’s a super strong day"
“HOLD DON’T TRADE AAPL!” Thanks Cramer FOR NOTHING!!
"Good day today. No end of session selloff is always bound to happen eventually with AAPL. Just a matter of patience, time, and keeping the faith"
"iCar, iHouse, iHealth, iWife, iKids, etc. Apple to da iMoon."
Trending on yahoo yesterday evening was an article as to the United States government experiencing a shortage of chips and are acquiring more and more of them for their usage! All this is great news for the technology sector because an increase in the demand means an increase in production and sales of Apple products such as I phones etc.
Biden says will send out $1400 more dollars per person. Trump tax cuts resulted in middle class keeping average of $3000. Biden ending those tax cuts. Biden’s new plan will increase minimum wage to $15 just when small businesses trying to open and save themselves. Biden’s plan will increase tax on many small businesses. All this will result in less hiring and unemployment. Biden’s plan will increase tax on your stock profits. Sounds like great plan to further destroy the economy.
Bears set to lose more during this earnings season.
I have a feeling Apple is going to overdeliver tomorrow ...
"There is some concern that Apple's share price will climb into earnings and then pull back. In my view, the prior will not repeat in 2021 Apple's new mobile supercycle and the underlying evolution of EV and AI will hold up the share price and bring about a bigger share price for Apple than last year and another possible share split approx end of this year.The opportunity for an exceptional new high before the end of January remains very positive with only one more day to go to set another new trend for the year."
"Just think...Apple is manufacturing their own chips instead of sourcing from intel. Apple is not a one trick pony, and they're ramping up productions, and Apple is also considered a stay at home stock. The future is bright! Good Luck."
Get ready for a stock split at Microsoft. The Microsoft Shorts are getting Clobbered.
$150 this week
So far the 3 days of APPLE CENSORSHIP Cost investors approximately $4.00 a share in profits. How much longer?
I'm proud to say I've never used an Apple product and don't ever plan to. No company has been from it inception more anti free market that Apple!
HERE WE GO! CONGRATS!!!!!!!
alway believed good news delivered before market opens and bad news after the market is closed.So why is Apple delivering news after market close ?
"It is hard to believe that someone is still buying the US Stocks at these INSANE VALUATIONS, in this MEGA BUBBLE! Keep Gambling!$AAPL $TSLA $AMZN $BLK $JPM"
We set the all time high this week. The ER speaks for itself. All the rest is noice. I’m raising my target to $201. Just to beat Gene Munster by a buck. Hehe 
$200 by July.
S. S. Reforms via executive action is overdue
Be very selective at this time; in the market. Buy AAPL. That's it for now.
shut down facebook. they are gathering all your information. dont ever buy their stock. Thats why facebook fears apple
Pretty simple stuff here kids. 10% run up the last 5 days into earnings. Profit taking (sell) on the news. The idea of the market is to make $ not spending all your time bashing each other based on if you are long or short. Been in appl for years both long and short and currently long. Great report today and won’t lose a minute of sleep because it’s down AH.
18mm iphone 12 units sold in china last quarter (20% higher than estimates). earnings will destroy estimates.
"Makes sense AAPL with blowout earnings drops, companies with huge losses gain. I guess this the bizzaro world."
GET THOSE FEBRUARY 19th CALLS CHEAP BEFORE THE EARNINGS RUN STARTS 
Apple will trend higher all the way to our Apple Car announcement in March
"i've been down on $aapl for a very long time, ""BUT"" i like it right now, stimulus and a pull back, i don't doubt $150 in a few weeks following the stimulus uptrend"
Zuckerberg is throwing a temper tantrum because he doesn’t believe people should have any choice of disabling tracking & advertising (where you talk about something and an adds of what u were talking about randomly show up on your device). This stock should be SOARING on news like that!. Especially since not all of us but some of us on here all know Zuckerberg is in bed with team corruption.
Apple going to be 150$ day after earnings. Just wait and watch.
AAPL Very Long--waiting to hear who they will partner with -Their versionof the E Car--
150$ after earnings...
"Apple longs know not to panic on days like today. The drop is due to options and day traders. These dips are opportunities to accumulate. When a company has solid fundamentals and record setting earnings and growth, you know you have a good investment. Just ask anyone who's been holding for 5+ years. Own it don't trade it."
"this should be at $160 by now with the earning beat, not 139, sometime fundamental, common sense doesn't work."
Big bounce coming on Monday.
The big flush starts in 25 minutes.AAPL below 130 and the Dow down 1000+.Buy late next week in the mid 120's. You can't fight this.
Dan Ives /Wedbush just raised Apple bullish price target to $225!! He is one of the most accurate analysts out there next to Gene Munster.
Results from Amazon and Google due today. Rocket up the engines we are headed to another galaxy
Have to laugh at the selling right before the mother of all ERs! Apple is about to report over 100 billion in sales!
easy 170$ ...come one apple ...
I dont think German or Japanese carmakers want to be Apple's another Foxconn.
Last five years... not a single day (that I could find) where NASDAQ closed up >2.5% and AAPL up less than 2%. Something propping the NASDAQ up or pushing AAPL down...
 announced the new Iphone 14. Just like the 12 and 13 except different color and more expensive. Never underestimate the simple people. The richest company in the world with one average product. Amazing
"We'll, I was right to be conservative about Apple's share price movement, however I never expected the market to be in the dumper on the day Apple reported. It's not a big deal to me but I'm sure there are plenty of unhappy new Apple investors out there wondering why Apple stock is down on nearly perfect earnings. I'm guessing it's a market macro thing that just happens to include Apple and nothing directly due to Apple's fault. I've learned to live with this market weirdness and Apple has always risen above it. I have no idea when Apple will start to rise based on earnings, but I know it will eventually. Were Apple's numbers not good enough? I doubt that. Is there profit-taking going on? Maybe. I'm Apple-long so I'm not going to lose sleep over whatever is happening today or tomorrow. All the guessing of how much Apple was going up on earnings didn't quite work out for today. The future is too difficult to predict with any accuracy. I have to admit I didn't think Apple would drop on near perfect earnings, but that's just how things go. I'm not concerned about it and I'm going to happily look forward to tomorrow."
"What gets me with partnerships with Kia/Hyundai, I remember them mentioned something about Apple’s BREAKTHROUGH BATTERY . What is that all about hmm..."
Does anyone know why apple's price jumped after the market? thanks
"In Law enforcement, we love self driving Apple cars. Let’s say you have an overdue library book, or an unpaid parking ticket. We just send a command to the vehicle, the windows roll up, the doors lock, it drives you straight to the police station."
Remember no one can fight a central bank printing of money  shorts will bankrupt
thinkjng $143 by friday. hope i’m wrong and it’s higher 
MSFT was down by $10 yesterday but its fully recovered by $12 today but this stock is ????
I am off this page for the day unless AAPL turns around. I hope and look forward for the upside on Monday. Have hope and a good weekend everyone.
"Isn’t it fun when all the shorts, naysayers and Goldman analyst fans scurry back under the baseboards?"
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html
"With earnings about a week away, I just wanted to share some thoughts...Firstly, about analyst expectations. Folks, if Apple reports massive revenue it's great for us don't get me wrong, but some analysts calling for $100 billion or more in revenue, that's kind of unrealistic. It's almost like they're setting up Apple to fail. What if Apple only reports $85 to $90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price? And let's not forget Apple did not provide guidance for this quarter. So expectations are too unrealistic. We're still in the middle of a pandemic. We're not out of the woods yet. If Apple can perform as good as they did last year I'd be satisfied, but if they do even better then that then I'd be very pleased. Secondly, I believe the selling is way overdone. We should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements. The stock held onto the support level very well technically. So I believe the stock has a lot more room to run. There's so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth. The continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long run.Third, I mentioned this in the past but I don't believe Apple will comment about Project Titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers. So don't expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on. I know many are eagerly waiting for this but still.Fourth, when earnings are announced, pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that aren't being focused on as much like Apple Fitness. I believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future. Definitely not priced in at this current price.Own it don't trade it! Apple long!"
Apple Stock  price target $180 by official EV announcement. Apple Technologies will be used in every type of vehicle in the future. Battery and Super Sensor Technology...This is the Future like smartphone Technology 5 years ago...Look at it now...
Time to go on a green streak
Is it to early to have a cold beer wait till Wednesday
Does anyone know why Apple would be down after good news from their earnings call this evening?...
Hopefully yesterday’s announcement will keep it over $133. I personally think that it will only fly after this is officially confirmed by apple or Kia/Hyundai. Should happen soon!
buy AAPL on the earnings dip
I am very bullish on Apple now because we are seeing progress on the EV front ! The partnership with Kia is very good news !
Apple needs to stop buyback at this extreme Market cap. They can’t retire many shares at this valuation. Then buy or contract with arrival ciic to produce their cars. The future of manufacturing and design.
"I have posted more than once on this page in regard to pullback, Rule of Thumb: check AAPL quote daily of course, but to truly measure AAPL progress make it a point to check quotes on an exact by-weekly basis and realize how beautifully AAPL is gaining in value."
So who even cares about the pre-market? $150 + today.
"Simple explanation.Algorithim players attempted to rally stock but had no luck.So, they will be content playing mini ""V"" like today.Earlier $135.54 to $133.71 back to $135.41 then late day dip for tomorrow set up.HIstorically AaPL could tread water for four to six weeks"
"Transparency + Unity = Profits for allSince 2008, this has been our cornerstone to success....$4.58 a share spilt adjusted.Yahoo has denied us using our original posting name; WE moved on to this one.Yahoo denies us access sometimes for hours or days (last Feb for days). WE always come back."
"FB and AAPL will be down 10%.Bad day to be reporting, unavoidable."
Have a nice week
"Apple selling bonds? Not quite sure why they need to do this now with 80 + billion in cash!The tech giant said it will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including buying back stock and paying dividends. It may also be used in funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition and repayment of debt, the person said."
Anyone good at reading charts? Under the 30 minute interval I placed a simple moving average with 200. I noticed since feb 1st it’s been riding that moving average. What does this typically mean? Pattern wise. If there are any meanings to this
My life goal is creating a company and create a stock thats looks like a house
"I think they have a cash problem. The issue is the future investment projects may generate more revenue, but they won't generate the same profit margins and free cash flow."
"C'mon true believers, if this is how WS is swallowing the stocks prior to earnings, then it begs the question: What will they do when Apple confirms the building of the iCar?"
"#AAPL will get hair cut tomorrow, be ready for it."
"Lesson learned! I’ll admit it, I panic sold in March and never bought back in for a long time. I missed the huge rally.  When we did buy back in we had significantly less shares. So we gambled again, sold Apple and bought Tesla to hopefully make up what we lost in March. In Tesla we made enough to get back and more where we were in March and it was so nerve wracking!! Moral of story....don’t sell Apple! "
The current SP will look like a bargin this time next year ....
yo ladies and guys too this is babba here. Please shorteeeees cover yo positions . I ain't kidding non whatsoever. This babe is going up and up and up. Then stimulus comin then economy opening up then employment growing and so on and so forth. Never never short anything specially my beloved Apple. Now drop down and give me fifty pushups and we can become friends again. Thanko
In 12 days this board changes back to normal (a long board)
"144 by Friday, shorts will cover by then to avoid paying the dividend out of their accounts"
Remarkable this is actually sitting here down a few dollars. I think wall st is still trying to comprehend these incredible earnings and numbers. All this before they start buying again in massive chunks. Add more folks.
10 years accumulated more that 15000 stocks till date Thats call saving account
"Help me understand this, FB loses 1 million customers and misses revenue projections and they are up $13; Apple blows out their numbers 111 billion and yet Apple is down $3"
"This is just part of why we aren't seeing this stock boom right now. While the pandemic was good for Tim's pocketbook it is not indicative of Apples current worth or future performance. However, historically, it's one of the best places to put your money in order to make money."
"So you’re going to sell your Apple shares in the first inning of a 5g SuperCycle and a month away from 85% of Americans getting a $2,000 check.....80% of whom don’t need it. Well you may want to get a brain scan too, because somethings wrong with you. :-)"
Finally a big scary selloff!!! We needed this $aapl $fb $jpm $googl to reset and refresh oh $tsla is gonna go to 300

"I guess Apple could have teamed up with Ford,Tesla or GM but why do that when you can team up with Korea."
Still above technical support! Can’t break Apple! Shorts will be screaming in a few weeks.
I got both Tesla and Apple but Apple building a car with Hyndai-Kia looks like second class to Tesla
Support between 136 and 138Then we are heading up again ! Don’t worry people just hold for the long term ! It will pay off !!!
Apple  hasn’t hit bottom yet - it’s coming- be patient
is now a good time to buy?
Bull case raised to a high of $225 for Apple
Go apple
"This is not the rise in share price that most everyone was thinking. Biggest blow out in earning per quarter by any company in history. I expect this will trade in a range 138-140 till next week. Options expire tomorrow and that usually means a down day, but who knows in this market, when you least expect it it goes through the roof even on a down day. We could be sitting right back at $145 by eod day but i do not think this runs till next week."
"This is not a stock you bet against. Apple keeps on buying back their shares to reduce their float. Buffet is not selling, I am not selling, and I recommend that you do not sell either. My return since I first start investing in this stock is almost 600%. I have held the stock since 2013."
"This time last year, AAPL was $80 then dipped to $52 and is now $132.Throughout the year it had bigger dips then this week. Relax"
AAPL still cheap as compare with other high tech
I need some honest advice. I am very inexperienced at buying stocks. Decided I would invest families Christmas money in stocks instead of putting in bank account. Is this a good time to buy Apple stocks?
"Nasdaq composite up 220, apple up 82 cent. money flows to Google, Amazon and Tesla."
"Once this breaks through the hold of shorts, it will roll."
"Should Apple drop after earnings, I will be in line to buy more. Anyone else?"
It will turn green AH
"NIO was just upgraded by Morgan Stanley to $80, plus they set a new record of over 9,000 plus vehicles produced last month and after hours it is skyrocketing, plenty of time to get in before it shoots the moon tomorrow, Good luck."
The rest of the earnings this year will be beat! Dividends coming in a couple weeks
"Every one keep in mind that after hours consists of a few hundred thousands shares traded in total. Regular trading day with AAPL alone is in the tens of millions of shares. So rest assured that tomorrow AAPL will not disappoint, it will be up and continue its ascent to much higher levels in days months and years to come. Stay long and prosper. "
"It’s options Friday, that y Apple is down, and in the long run Apple will go up, as lot of analysts have upgraded their price target for Apple after the earning reports."

"I agree with Mr. Sidwell. There is no reason for a selloff right now. AAPL should thrive in a work from home environment. You go out for a walk/run early in the morning, stop at the corner Starbucks and grab a coffee. You then come back home and finish your school project on your Macbook. Later you put in your airpods to listen to some sick tunes on your Apple Music App. Meanwhile your Apple watch is always on your wrist tracking your calorie expenditure and is taking care of your grocery payment with Apple Pay. Im pretty sure you are storing all of your important work on iCloud because it is safe there. If you still think Apple is going to get a correction after reading this, please by all means sell and be bearish!"
Such a great opportunity to load up.

Apple: .5% short floatIdiots: Shorts will have to cover! Gap up to $150 premarket!
Don’t be surprised if pre market turns positive prior to bell. I really expect AAPL to gain some of last week loss. In fact this is going to be a positive week. And February a strong month. Positive Long.
Evidently the science is saying open up everything since Joe has been installed.
"5 Trillion Dollars sitting on the sidelines hoping for a pullback to jump in. I’m a long term Long, whether we go up now or later same difference. After “that” ER this stock will find itself right-side-up in due course. "

I sold my tech stocks today. Made lots of money. Going on a cruise this Summer and enjoy my profits.
pretty crazy how message boards and the retail investor have overtaken Wall street and the corruption! i’m loving this. only a matter of time when the retail investors will pump Apple to $1000 a share
"Owned for a decade, never sold a single share. I have kept adding, great cornerstone stock."
Wrong pick for car makerShould have been Toyota
"Slowly but surely AAPL is showing a comeback, hopefully  by market closing."
"The late morning sell-off was a shorty trap, AAPL traded higher highs for the remaining of the day. Good Luck"
Hope there will be more sympathy and love for the seniors by increasing S.S. Payments as promised to them during mid year 2020
"Hedge funds raise capital on long positions cause of selloff.May not be done yet, but expect a huge day at some point next week, on the UP SIDE>>>>>>>>>>>>>"
SEC should make new regulations: stocks must be held for at least 24 hour before resold. The markets would become more investment driven then speculative trading driven.
Massive revenue beat. Should go to $200 easy now.
this is going to touch 150 tomorrow
Buy it up and hold. Anyone really believe this thing won't average higher than market returns over the next 10 years?
Don’t sell! Buy and sell if it goes up to average down :)
Apple to close today above 140 and we see 150 by March Best company of all time
Haha how many of you guys think it will fall haha
buy the dip $AAPL
This is going to see a nice lift before and after the closing bell. Love this stock it just gives and gives. Just like me to my divorce attorney! Lmao 
Thinking of selling my AMZN shares and buy AAPL leading up to AAPL earnings then selling on the news and putting money back to AMZN for their Feb 2 earning release. Sensible?
Downvote me all you want but with the Buffett indicator higher than 2007 we all know who will be the last one laughing.
"Morgan Stanley analyst Katie Huberty explained the profit potential for Apple in a research note she issued in January. “Smartphones are a $500bn annual TAM. Apple has about one-third of this market. The mobility market is $10 trillion. So Apple would only need a 2% share of this market to be the size of their iPhone business,” Huberty wrote."
Ok peoples. I expected this stock to go up with such a great report.why isn't it?
I am thinking the sell off was precipitated by short sellers liquidating their positions from profitable companies to be able to cover their margin expenses. This should start heading towards a 3 trillion+ market cap by next week.
Man talk about trolls. Had to mute SEAN. He’a just an angry name caller.
seems like many investors are selling out of their stocks to get a piece of GME and AMC.
"Tomorrow is option expiration.It would be nice to see AAPL finish out the week like every other day this week, before games are played with the close and option expiration."
By Wednesday it will going to hit $150
Anyone think they will up the dividend?
Now we are waiting for NEW Higher TARGET PRICES ... It's direct competition to TSLA in IndoChina ..KIA has its Distribution Networks Around the GLOBE / real dealerships!!
Could this be the start of a major market correction?
"One thing I’ve learned about trading apple is never bet against them, “you hear me shorts”"
Apple to $200! Strong year ahead and analysts pumped about the stock.
"Over 5.7M shares traded so far AH, and we're still have 3 hours to go!"
It’s fun to see the shorts triggered when reality sets in.
Apple will transform the Auto industry as we know it. just think about it . They did it with the iPhone and they will do it with the iCAR.. The iCar will be so far advanced over any other EV out there and it will tie in with Apples ecosystem seamlessly .... Just watch
"Unbelievable results, mind boggling!"
"That's according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. On Tuesday, Ives raised his price target on Apple stock from $150 to $160 -- but outlined a bull case for it to climb as high as $200. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 7% over the stock's closing price on Tuesday of about $124"
"To all you people wondering what's going on with apple, this happens a lot with apple more than 60% of the time it drops in the day and week after earnings.."
Upgrades coming.
it is very frustrating to watch a stock take months to move to all time highs but the hedge fund managers can take it down and wipe out months of gains in two days. the downward movements are violent in this rigged market.
"Over 4.5M shares traded and still green, great indicator!"
Pyramid scheme with AMC Gamestop. Kids buying in others selling and making big bucks. Young people throwing away their money
Theres that awesome apple drop we’re all to used to and love by now. Amazing.

Good day.
What day in February will APPL pass $150? I just want to put it down on my calendar.
any idea why this would pull back before earnings?? people taking profits? not aware of blow out coming?
"$136.66 critical now.Above this point, longs can feel hopeful."
"Gotta love it. After the hedge fund 's satisfy their margin calls caused by the Reddit Army, AAPL will move to $150. The hedge funds ALL hold large positions in AAPL and they have to come up with the money somehow... The pain being inflicted upon the despicable #$%$ is probably the most satisfying event I've seen in the markets in my lifetime and is worth the few days it will take for AAPL to resume it's inexorable march to $150 - $160 in the near term."
"Price action....are the gains going to hold today, give some back during the session or rally and close at all time highs?"
is apple going up today after today's financial results of Q1 2021?
shorts covering quick. 2%-6% gain tomorrow 
"So let's review AAPL pricing culture applied to cars, they will high value priced. May be made in GA but FoxCom still has a Wisco commitment so EV innards made there? AAPL Scvs applied to car, goes by itself to pick up food order instead of expensive Door dash delivery? See, hypothesizing after market Friday can be fun along with a winning Superbowl bet, GO CHIEFS !!"
MDI rep clued me into this stock at .79. as a 74-yr old day trader i was in and out many times early on. Not any more. This and $AAPL are my only sacrosanct holds. Glad to be along for the ride. Reminds me a little of $MRNA over the past 8 months.
The FOX Business channel had an interview with Ford CEO claiming a relationship with Apple. Interesting drawings.

probably will go sideways tomorrow so remaining calls will expire worthless..hopefully next week will show earnings gains
blackhat hacker shows how apple software in EV would fail in about 30 seconds flat.
The Market is going to tank boys. Take your profits and take a break.
Apple: “Hyundai...did you let leak we had discussions regarding an EV?”Hyundai: “What?!? Us? No. Come on. We’d NEVER do such a thing to give our stock a lift. Apple: “If that happens again you can kiss any possible deal goodbye.”Hyundai: “Yessir....we’ll walk it all back in the press tomorrow.”

"Dan Ives of Wedbush raised his price target on Apple's stock to $175 from $160, but also laid out a bull case for why the stock could climb to as high as $225."
I counted 8 upgrades yesterday with an average stock price of $160.
"Dow and S&P futures green, Nasdaq down 10. Coiled spring fixin’ to bounce!"
Cowen pt raise to 153 from 133.
Don’t let short term disappointment steal your long term wealth ! Hold your nerve and hold apple or you will regret it in 10 years !
Earnings on the 26th will be with the iPhone 12 for the first time. I expect a blowout Q.
Aaaah. I feel so optimistic right now. @B @Da Vinci @ Jimmy @ 
shorts will have to pay the dividend next week
Repeating Falsehoods from Fox News & Social Media is not protected under Freedom of Speech?You think you can spread lies about somebody and the law should be on your side ?Grow up and get an Education !
"AS I read this board, all I hear is ""options"".Maybe this is my fault, discussing 1000% returns in four days. 100% everyday.As the board historian, let me share my experiences with AAPL, Many times, AAPL can go up or down in price yet both the calls and puts fall in value. Why? The premium erodes once the earnings are released.ALso, when everyone is on the same side of the trade the markets kill the action. One time , earnings were great yet the market postponed the rally until the calls expired for the next week.As posted last night, After today's am rally, you may want to sell half of your position to pocket yo recover principle and some profits.Yes, we did post Investors have the filed until AFTER earnings. But this is an entire different subject"
If the numbers didn’t stop at 8pm this thing would be $150 now.
"Reminder: Apple is repurchasing roughly $20 billion per quarter or about 150 million shares at the current price. Go look at the capital return history on Apple's Investor Relations website. If anyone is upset or salty, please go ahead and sell your shares and/or short all the shares you can. Thank you. We stand ready to buy the dip."
Wall St is so manipulated. Great company with record quarter goes down while GameStop skyrockets for no reason
$400 on its way. No doubt in my mind.
"There are some discussions in this forum about Apple pullback after Q3 earnings were released.2 factors:I - electionII - WS was disappointed that Apple delayed the release of 12; and the fact Cook did not give some type of guidance - Since when Cook gives guidance and discusses products under development? So weasels on WS punished the stock badly subsequently, and now they're buying them back and a few more before Q4 earnings.I believe this time is different, not only because we all know that Cook (not if but when) is going to come out sometime this year and announce the iCar (weasels don't want to miss out); but there are also rumors that they're looking to acquire some key Cos that would perfectly fit their products since they have tons of cash.Conclusion: depending on your financial situation, if you can then I would hold. If Gene Munster (he made many millionaires and billionaires in the Bay Area) believes that this will surpass 200, then, and based on what he has wizardly done previously, I'm banking on that it would blow the 200 to smithereens before the end of 2021."
Apple bears wrong again for the 3rd consecutive decade . Truly sad!
Get to $145 already. You know you want to...
"Apple hasn't moved since the split over Labor Day weekend. It's gone 5 months and hasn't gotten past the split # of about 135. Everyone wants to talk about the 1 year growth, who cares it was all hype do to the split. Now we NEED HUGH EARNINGS to get this to 150. Five months is a long time to tread water. Comments please"
Can we close above 137 today ?
"145+ by Friday, shorts do not want to pay the dividend."
"Something interesting and incomprehensible is happening with ""Apple"", these daysthese after the excellent report, the stock had to take off."
Apple technicals are looking better ! Who’s ready for a sweet bounce? 
"Years ago, when the P/E was 12 I argued here everyday, multiple times a day, how AAPL deserved a much higher P/E. Now, AAPl's P/E is almost at historic heights The argument is once again the same but reversed. The argument is the P/E is rich but earnings will drop it. There is no reason for this price actionOnce again, people have different risk tolerance, time horizons and cash flow requirements. No one can decided for another.Good Luck"
post your earnings predictions. I say 150.00
This aapl super cycle is for 18 to 24 months ..just the beginning of sales of iphone 12!!!!!!!
Record earnings and this is what Wall Street does unbelievable.
"I’ve lost a few thousand today on this. I don’t care all that much as it will recover in time, but it can’t go without being said this is pure criminality once again by WS. Their over leveraged positions were exploited by some smart people on reddit and once again smart money is paying the price. Unbelievable"
"Between tomorrow and Friday the Dow will be up 3000 points and guess what the Nasdaq and S&P will do even better percentage wise. Beware shorts beware because you will get squeezed like a squash and the margin calls will come pouring in like a torrential rain and lightning. Please kindly remember I warned you. Each and every human being looks for stability and so does the country. Even animals looks for stability. Case in point ! My new puppy began to hide treats under the table , under the sofa etc. He had to be persuaded that there is no need to hide the treats because the treats are “stability flowing “. Once he got the message he quit hiding things. We humans are like that too. We need conclusive stability to get going with our business"
Ex-Dividend date for Apple shares coming up fast. I certainly hope those shorters like paying the dividends out of their own pockets...!
"I would rather a Hyundai EV over a tesla. Why: I am not rich, I do not have patience for quality issues from Tesla, and Hyundai's drive themselves on the highway."
Apples  time to pull a Tesla and breakout. Hold on Tightttt
Poor Joe shorted at 110...he’s paying your dividend and all that margin interest too...ouch
"The motto here is ""Everyone wets their beak.""Last month it has been a traders sandbox. Earlier I showed the four pyramids with $136 being the ""line in the sand"" With earnings on 1/27 after the close, this week may follow a different script. There may be a steady run-up into 1/27.Just a hunch"
Rod Hall bearish on Apple for soooo long. Years and years he’s been a vocal bear. Man the amount of money he has lost for people over the years must be staggering
"NO WAY APPLE is going to compete with TESLA. 1st they have to compete with google. Their code base is not open source and making an iphone is different from a car. Secondly any manufacturer they get will have an IC engine base that they would need to get rid of. 3rd UNions to deal with. 4th. Apple, just needs someone like Lucid motors. NOT a Hyundai. Might work, but surely not a hit. They might get a car sometime around 2026 . By that time NIO/XPEV/Li/Volks/Renault and TSLA are going to be way ahead. Apple has the advantage to develop software, but do they have the data. NO for FSD."
Will sell my Apple shares in the coming Monday.
"SHORT, $FB $AMZN $TWTR $AAPL. P/E to high its time for the bubble to pop,"
"Added more, now have 3000 shares."
Still 2 full days to earnings reporting Jan 27. after market closes. Good Luck
"I'm guaranteeing this stock will be green before the morning hits you'll be sorry you did not get in at this low price, You'll See"
Heading towards 143
Flat. I’ll take it. Now we move onward and upward. Earnings days at $&#@. Always beat up tech stocks.

What are apples usual dividends pay outs
"According to a new analytical report published this morning, Apple is likely to break previous iPhone sales records during its FY first quarter, setting up the company for what could be the biggest year ever for the iPhone. Although Oct-Nov 2020 global sell-through was down YoY, it declined by only low single digits. That is positive considering the four to six-week launch delay of the iPhone 12 versus the iPhone 11. There is now the possibility of a December sales surge, driven by the new iPhone 12, which would bring the quarter’s sell-through number into record territory. 2 x counterpoint research chart dec 23 2020 The popularity of the new model is evident when comparing iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 post-launch sales in the US market on a YoY, week-for-week basis. Jeff Fieldhack, Counterpoint Research’s Director of US Mobile Devices and Carrier Strategies, commented: ""The iPhone 12 consistently outperformed its predecessor during the first six weeks from launch – with the exception of week two, when strong early demand and ample supply delivered an exceptional sales week for the iPhone 11."" He also noted that ""Double and triple-digit weekly sales increases for the iPhone 12 over the iPhone 11 – despite 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max shortages – is sending a strong signal, and we believe the iPhone 12 will bolster global quarterly shipment growth for all iPhones to 21% YoY."" The US out-performance bodes well globally, and Counterpoint Research expects record iPhone shipments for the quarter to be driven not only by North America, but also China, Japan, India and Europe. Peter Richardson, Global Head of Research: ""What we’re seeing is a combination of things driving iPhone growth globally. These include pent up demand for a new 5G iPhone with both operators and consumers hungry for the new iPhone products, attractive prices on the iPhone 12 aided by bountiful promotional offers. iPhone SE sales also helped momentum together with iPhone 11 longevity, and solid Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance."" While acknowledging that Apple faces issues, especially around supply, Richardson added that Apple ""is well positioned to mitigate the risks. The iPhone Pro and Pro Max are on backorder in the US, but lead times have dropped significantly over the past three weeks. Power management ICs remain constrained, but Apple is likely a favored customer going to the head of the line."" Lastly, Richard stated that ""The India Wistron controversy is not material and Apple is managing the situation. And in terms of their output capability globally, it is better than last year on increased hiring, overtime incentives and factories running more hours."""
Possible to see 144 next week?I bought in 143
"don't be like this stock. their car will compete with many car companies. the middle East will continue to drop the barrel price for oil making the electric cars uneconomical, no matter what green deals are inforced."
My two calls at 147 expiring 19 February fells very bad... I need a big rise at least 10 bucks...
The perfect stock if it paid reasonable dividends. Maybe someday be nice if it was at least a .50 a share per quarter
We could very well hit new highs before ER
Bought some puts chains last week in anticipation of further down trends.The market is overbought.
Wow just looked at Apple we are heading to 150 today
"Apple's iPhone 12 supercycle reality 'meeting the initial hype,' says Wedbush Outperform rating and $160 price target on Apple shares with a ""bull case"" target of $200.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the firm's Asia supply chain checks on iPhone 12 5G demand point to a trajectory that now exceeds his ""bull case scenario"" for units in FY21, contending that it appears the iPhone 12 supercycle ""reality is meeting the initial hype"" so far. Based on recent Asia checks, he believes the supply chain is anticipating iPhone unit builds in the low to mid 90M range for the December quarter and for the March quarter he thinks builds for total iPhones ticked up another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60M-70M range, Ives tells investors. While the Street is forecasting roughly 217M iPhone units for FY21, based on the current trajectory and in a bull case, Apple has the potential to sell more than 240M units and ""250M could be in the cards,"" added Ives,"
"A new CBS interview and video claim Apple will make a 'big announcement' on Wednesday about a ""major new initiative"" that will be ""bigger and better than a new product.In the video, CBS Gayle King speaks briefly with Cook following violence at America's Capitol building last week. Cook stated in response to the attack that it was key ""people be held accountable for it"" and that the event was something we should be ""very serious about."" More interestingly, at the end of the segment, King stated that Cook had actually interviewed with CBS about a different topic, a ""big announcement"" coming Wednesday, January 13."
$150 next week
"OPTION TRADERS ARE EYEING AAPL STOCK OVER 155. AAPL NEED TO TRADE ABOVE 145 THIS WEEK. AAPL MADE 111 BILLION IN ONE QUARTER AND DOWN 10%. GOOGLE BEAT AND UP HUGE, TESLA MISSED AND UP HUGE. COOK DO SOMETHING TO THE LAGGING STOCK OR RESIGN"

"Google has so much cash and so little debt compared to its competitors... over $100B cash after debt. That’s what pushed me to buy at $1500, and glad I did. Forever holding $GOOG $AAPL $AMZN"
Apple  will rollercoaster all day until earnings. Then blowout to the upside
"Apple car gonna be great. Endless revenue streams, another “hook” for their ecosystem. Not a low-margin waste of time like some have said."
I am the one who predicted Apple’s 110b revenue 3 days ago.. now with India in apple’s radar. The next earnings I predict will grow in every product sector again. With India sale growth also. 
"Great news= Apple CFO Tim Cook says Parler could return to App Store “if they get their moderation together “. Business insider January 17, 2021 by Tim Levin"
I was actually mistaken about AAPL’s cash. When you include short term investments their cash is $91 billion. Free cash flow is $73 billion. Again I ask what case do AAPL bears have here?
Best economy in the world. Best market in the world. Largest economy in the world. Largest market in the world and rather than being grateful some of you are chronically complaining. Even if God sends you maina you will still not be satisfied and won’t quit complaining
"tomorrow, the AAPL casino opens for betting, up or down?"
Don’t get discouraged too much by early futures numbers.. pre market only opens in 10 hours. Reversal is possible here

"The more the shorts get excited and post more frequently, the more I know AAPL is trading at a discount and it's time to buy some more! I love all my Apple stuff, including my iPhone 12 Pro Max I just got. And, an Apple Car in the future sounds awesome to me. I bought in at $142, and am patiently waiting for this to get back up there. It may be time for me to average down and buy some more!"
Avail of this great buying opportunity. Tomorrow will be an up day . Don’t forget the biggest and the best market and the biggest and the best economy. And with 50:50 in the senate and an almost even in the house there will be deadlock and the market likes that. Already the Democratic senator from Wisconsin ( I believe) is opposing the president on stimulus so says yahoo news.
Months of gains wiped out in 48 hours. Typical.
"They only thing going against Tesla cars is the price. Let's see how this batch of low priced cars turns out? We will see. Don't laugh Tesla, you don't want to compete with Apple, they are a giant."
"I’m listening to this conference call right now. All sounds amazing, but stock not moving ..."
"I am tempted to pull everything out of the market.Biden giving the store away, the fed making monumental mistakes,Washington DC going socialist.What can go wrong."
Apple had its best Q in India. Up 100% yoy. They sold 1.5m phones. It’s like 2008 in US. Once people start using it and loving it and word spreads....look out
"Thanks to the LiDAR, in addition to the improvement of the shooting effect, the expression effect of APPLE's AR application will be greatly improved in terms of visual presentation and interaction with the real world by combining the Pro level camera, motion sensor and iOS architecture.The AR experience on Apple mobile will also be the next stage."
Relax. Remember when it was $116?
Hedge funds sale shares after hours back and forth for small losses to drop the price. creating a lower buy in as we know this going up and hoping retail investors sell. No risk as they already know the earnings were awesome and lost of reward. This is APPL it will go up.
I ALWAYS SAID STEVE JOBS WAS THE GENIUS AND TOOK AAPL TO THE MOON TIM COOK IS NOBODY AS NOTBTALENT NO INNOVATIONS EVERY YEAR AAAPL PHONE IS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY BUT MORE EXPENSIVE
Apparently it doesn’t matter that Canoo DECLINED the buyout off from $AAPL. Speculators are going to pump this no matter what 
Absolutely no doubt that this stock is set to reach 250$ and beyond.
"quick, another press release about a car"
150$ today 
"If apple really does develop a apple car , you will see people selling their best stocks just for a few shares. Easily $300"
"Hopefully GME, AMC, and the like won't manipulate the news again tomorrow. Enuf already!"
If breaks $140 then nothing can stop AAPL to $160 at Earning Report day. IMHO
"Apple’s iPhone fourth quarter sales in China hit 18 million units according to DigiTimes. The momentum is expected to continue and get a boost through (February 11th to February 26th) the Lunar New Year Holiday.

"Where is the 185 upgrade ?Oh , it’s coming !!!"
It won’t go below its 50 day average around $131.5. Just some profit taking after earnings combined with market dip at the end of month.
"The transition to EV's will take decades. The grid must be hardened, charging stations have to be deployed in vast numbers and battery technologies must be dramatically improved. Apple has some of the best minds on the planet planning many years down the road so take a breath and enjoy the ride!"
"Hilarious. Don’t care if we’re down. I’ve been in since 1999. Huge upside starting tomorrow. Best guess, and educated one, 165 in 2 weeks."
Just added $BABA to my $AAPL $CCL $RCL $AAPL $TMO $CNK and $SDC L00King to the future for sure!!
Yo Trumpsters! Thanks for covering my aapl and amzn stocks!! Parler is really missed on these 2 companies platforms.
I never trade Apple. I invest!So i set it and forget... and i wait for the dividends.
"Just curious, did we elect a president or a king. 43 executive orders in a week and a half and who’s writing these orders certainly no him. Sounds like a dictatorship to me."
AAPL's involvement in EV and autonomous vehicle will take this stock to $400 easily by end of this year!! This is in pipeline!!
$AAPL > $TSLA
"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on 01/27/2021 declared a dividend of $ 0.2050 per share payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 08, 2021."
For next week stocktwits Apple’s sentiment index is up 2.19%. Also stimulus on its way. Inauguration brings stability. Both houses will vote on bills . Both houses are evenly divided and markets like that. Quarterly results will be outstanding
Watch GMC tomorrow. The Reddit and Robinhood investors are going to get clobbered in a very big way.
"Apple has today announced that New Year's Day saw a new single-day spending record of over $540 million on the App Store, as the company celebrated a number of highlights from its various services in 2020."
No way MMS were going to let it close above $140 today. still excellent Friday close and on to ER week.
car insurance company would be better to own.
"don't let them scare you out of your dividend, AAPL has been up every day this week and will be through Friday"

Tomorrow's the BIG DAY! I know you guys are excited. Good luck to all Apple longs and new investors and.... let's goooooooo Apple!
one day doesn't define one year. apple will be $200 soon
the dow will be at 21000 in about 5 months
I guess Apple should have missed by $8B to go up.
I will be praying for my apple stock this weekend. kindly do same
Anyone look at how much competition is coming in cars? The economics of the auto industry are not good. This company is making bad moves.....making their own chips and then going into the auto market with an Apple car. Huge capital outlays in the future. They should pay a special or big dividends instead of going off on lower margin higher risk projects.
NASDAQ futures up 84 points while @Anonymous is crying over his old tweets knowing he's wrong
If only poor people around the world had invested in Apple just 10 years ago.
Haaaa back into the $140s. Longs it’s all good. Apple  shows how strong it is.
Oh ya also for those who sold don’t forget to set aside 35% of those short term earnings for both the fed and state tax guys....
"Hi everyoneMy first smartphone was a iPhone 4 Since then I’ve been an Apple fanboyI own everything and I follow everything from leakers, jailbreaks, ...From a hardware and software perspective I know about everything there is to know about Apple.What I have NO experience in, is in AAPL stockI’m considering buying a fairly high stake in shares since I’m a fan of the product and I think the M1 processor, being a A14X variant will take the functionalities like ‘continuity’ and ‘handoff’ more advance and closer to ‘the Internet of things’-visionAlso, their privacy could stand in a possible ‘Google-Facebook-Amazon’-meltdown after the recent ‘big tech’ criticismI’m thinking to hold for +- 10 yearsYoung investor here, owner of BioNTech stock since November."
The Feb 05 $150 calls are gold at current price...
any think the stock up tomorrow buyyyyyyyyyyyy
"Katy Huberty:”Investors are likely to underestimate the financial impact of a potential Apple Car, especially when considering the effect that Apple’s entrance into other markets has had on the addressable opportunity. Simplistically, Apple typically expands the size of any market it enters. At maturity, the iPod shipped more than 3x annual peak units of its predecessor, the Sony Walkman. Despite an ASP of more than three times the feature phone market, smartphones surpassed the peak feature phone market size less than 10 years after the iPhone launched. Apple Watch shipments today exceed the entire Swiss watch market. In other words, applying a market share figure to the current EV market forecast is likely to vastly underestimate the size of Apple’s car business in the future.”"
As a retiree investor in the market for close to 40 years I am so disappointed in AAPL performance on day of and post earnings report. I truly regret to say that my wife and I will sell our holding tomorrow if Apple’s disappoint lack of positivity continues.

160$ after ER
All other ev car makers face stir competition atleast 10 percent world share goes to apple perfect time for ev icar
Guyzz! Let Me show somethingAs far as Shorted shares volume The GME is third behind the TSLA and AAPL!Now read this:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/
Hopefully since Apple is doing a buyback on stocks the share price will start to movie upward
I expect apple’s stock price to stay upwards of $185 by June 2021.
"Apple has never released any information about its AR glasses devices, but according to relevant patent information leaked by Apple, and apple's frequent acquisition of AR technology-related companies, it has become an open secret in the industry that Apple is developing an AR glasses device."
"It will be a delayed upside, once the GME, AME and others settles down. But I support crushing short's of hedge funders. They've been running the show forever and thumbing their noses on retail investors. No hate messages only gloating. Lol"
Here we go with the Bull Run! Put a saddle on it and Buy! Apple going up!
These earnings lower AAPL P/E ratio instantly. 111.4 billion in one quarter is amazing.
This is going trend higher right through Feb and straight into our iCar March Hyundai autonomous vehicle nees
Monday February 1st HUGE rebound. This just end month selling
Apple at $2166.84T it will easily add $350 billion in new market cap after ER.
Just ran some math. If Apple beats estimates by 16 cents then with the current PE that puts the stock at $156. Without multiple expansion or an even higher beat then I believe this would be one of the best short term outcomes.
"Shares are going up because the new iphone 12 is incredible. I have upgraded every couple years and the 12 is the fastest, longest battery and incredible camera is incredible. I have buying aapl for years and have 6377 shares. Go fellow longs!"
How is this NOT UP?
Ongoing AAPL rally justified in spectacular fashion yesterday and resumes today...
Apple building up its autonomous supply chain.....6 Japanese car companies now included.....
under 130 today
Shorts better be careful!
Besides making autos with other auto companies apple will also acquire a number of companies this year. $400 on its way by December 2021
"So let me understand this correctly. Some people criticize Apple for having a PE of 40 and price to sales ratio of 8 or whatever. But then you have legit Wall St analysts that raise price targets on another stock that already has a PE ratio of 1,500? Do you know what this tells you? It means we are underpriced and nobody cares about PE or price to sales ratios. Accumulate all you can, while you still can."
144 coming up
Thanks for the buying opportunity!
Apple shares are doing exactly what it did after the last time it split back in 2014. Back then after splitting Apple just sat there and went NOWHERE for almost a year. I practically pulled my hair out and it took great restraint on my part in not selling. I didn't sell and Apple eventually resumed its climb around 2015. History repeats itself...
Buddy says he's waiting for 125. 00 to move in. I said no chance.
More price upgrades!!!!
DTRAIN : clearly anonymous is playing Apple short . In some way . Wrong play bro
Pre market positive up move on EV news. Should have nice gain today and continue tomorrow. 
"great earnings, blowout quarter, good news about icar with kia and still it goes down. mms want cheap shares before it explodes higher. you cant have a weak stomach when owning this stock however it always makes money for its investors you just have to buy and hold and be rewarded"
NASDAQ will lose another 600 points tomorrow. Great president lol. Don't call me a Trumper I don't like anyone that's unqualified to handle my future.
"for those tha feel the impending correction of tesla in the immediate future, I'm not here to bash tesla, love the company, have the utmost respect for musk especially in the direction he has been able to push forward in. What I am here for is to explain what is going on with valuation. anyone saying tesla will go to 20k is just ignorant. I know tesla doesnt trade on fundamentals, but think about this for a moment. tesla has been the most shorted stock ever. when they hit the sp500, bigger funds begin to buy in, making those that recently have been short, unable to continue and have been forced to buy back the stock at a loss (increased price). this will not last much longer. eventually you will have some big time shorts (currently just micheal Burrell) come in and this will fall hard. it will get back up but do you want to risk that much depreciation? look at the numbers. you should invest where you can make 100 to 400% over a year. can you look at Teslas market cap and really believe all the big hedge funds that are now buying in are going to hold when it reaches 30 or more % than what it is now? and how hard do youthink this will fall? I've been investing in spacs for less than a year, what do I know right? I do have a portfolio that has gained 756%. and they arent sitting in overvalued positions. they are reinvested into companies with the potential for 3 to 400% returns for the year. currently my latest position was in hcac warrants (hcacw) I bought them at 1.8. also. bought more at 3.5. they are at 4.7. now they already merged with canoo, and will likely get to 10 to 15 in the near future. everyone should have seen by now hyundais surge, nearly 20 billion added to market cap just on the rumor that they are in talks with apple. heres the fun part. canoo is doing the engineering services for hyundai's ev sector. they have designed their new skateboard platform for them, they have their own as well and will be a disruptor in the market in so many ways but just think about this, #AAPL has talked about their monocell as superior battery tech. they are now talking with hyundai. musk has said that monocells are ""impossible"" and canoo tweeted the new year in with ready to keep engineering the 'impossible' in 2021 as if to give musk a heads up. then of course left with this:just read between the lines, but the rumor and sell on the news. I'm not here to pump, I'm here to help those that have a gut feeling right now listen to it. it's made me 756% for 2020 and I'm already up another 60% since then. canoo is #GOEV. warrants are #GOEVW. roll your profits over and gain another big run. them when tesla has had its correction we can be ready to jump back in again.."
"Algorithim players still need to be nimble.However, we have seen Thursday in the past run $4 to $8.Why? Fuel from option players.Late last night someone sold 10,000 Feb 5 $140 puts for $13. I would track that trade throughout the day"
apple car would sell like hot cakes. get long
Absolutely Fantastic!!!
Buy High and Let it Fly! Apple on a tear and $150 now on the radar screen in lieu of a blockbuster ER. 
Monday AAPL will see its biggest gap up ever.
Didn’t we already know this news? Oh well won’t complain. Hope it lasts till the market opens. My calls were not looking good up until 30 minutes ago
"Seems like we should see $145-150 through Wednesday, then ""maybe a 10%-12% jump after earnings."" Conservative estimate (I hope!!) for Thursday morning is $160. "
"Can you even fathom the quality of an Apple car? GAME CHANGER! Can I get Trademarks on Apple Spice, Apple Core, Green Apple, Apple Appeal, Apple PI, Apple ADAY......"
Just bought 300 new shares
msft and aapl. I think these are the two best companies to own for the future. They're into everything and have great management.
"Longs owe so much to the shorts....thank u for being who u r shorts and please, please never change"
Futures up 1% on Nasdaq if this isn’t up 3% and start acting like the company didn’t just have the best earnings of all time for any company im going to lose it
forget the market for today it's going sideways for everyone.. come back tomorrow
"Apple's Hyundai-Kia report has been made public and the share is only up less than a gallon of milk. And GME no revenue on the verge of collapse gets exploited to approximately $500 within 48hrs of the Robinhood insurgence. What remains to be seen is whether when the current report sinks in will Apple with real revenue, cash pile, and real growth expansion race to $400+ within the next 36hrs."
"100,000 Apple Cars to be built starting in 2024 with Kia in West Point, Georgia. Fantastic! You can guess what that will do to the stock over next few years. Hope Elon Musk was wearing his adult pampers when that news hit the wires. Hehe "
"Hard to lift 16 billion shares, easy to drop"
I feel Apple will be over 200.
How fast they can get to market & distribution model will be key issues. It really does sound like a good business combination because Hyundai is much more than just automotive. Built in distribution channel. Advanced tech. Hyundai very familiar on getting vehicles through NHTSA. Much more logical business combination than others in the past. Other manufacturers should watch closely.
APPL going to 150$. Easy money boys.
Me too I am buying more at the opening. 150 is the fresh start. Anything under is xmas gift and discounted. I hear 200 in Feb-March
Lots of speculation about what would trigger the next major market crash. Look no further than the White House for your answer. Good luck.
This is an opportunity to buy more!
Someone the last 5 days has shown America exactly what his policies are. The people who act invest real money in the markets are showing you exactly what they think about those policies. Tomorrow will be a bloodbath in all 3 markets again. Be prepared for the bear markets coming. Young melinials are about to see a pretty bear market.
FYI if you listened to the shorts you will keep loosing money. LONG AAPL
"I am massively overweight AAPL this week, got calls on JUL16 for earnings, longs calls in 2023JAN20 and went long with calls on the weekly this week. So far so good."
They keep saying apple can't continue to grow but how can't they grow as it would be difficult to have a company become their competitor at this point. We have everything hooked up to apple.
$200 this year easy
How long ago was it that Tony Balooga and “Trade Accordingly Harry” we’re going back and forth about buying or selling Apple at $172? Two years? Remember Harry buying me a new boat and a Triumph TR4? Well all that is true. Apple stock has gone from $172 to $520. My gosh.........Apple is dwarfing other stocks and Steamrolling most investor’s portfolios. And you wonder why some people are “Trimming the Shade Tree” or “Collecting a few Golden Eggs”? This is just a normal Apple profit taking pullback. There is nothing wrong with Apple. Smart investors don’t have more than 20% of their net worth in one stock. That should be a rule never to be broken.
The march upward is on.
has printed $140+ twice this hour. Sellers of $140 calls are keeping it down?They need to close out their trades
All price targets increased $160.00+ 
BUY AAPL HERE BEFORE THE BREAKOUT TO 146.. BUYBACKS AND 111 BIL IN EARNINGS AND OPENING ECONOMY AND THE CAR. AAPL TO 180
Doesn’t take a genius to see that stocks are being manipulated. Earning mean nothing anymore. Next time Apple goes up is x date in February? Give me a break at next to nothing dividend. Tic toc time will tell long....
It's results like this after a record earnings report that turns investors off. Then Wall Street wonders why GameSpot happens. I say turn the bulls loose tomorrow on AAPL. Who's with me. Big move up tomorrow!!!
Not selling a company that just netted 28.5B in a quarter. Apple allows me to sleep very well at night.
This thing will be at $165 within 3 to 6 months. Easily
Hold Apple till retirement and then only then start taking bites from the Apple 
last chance to buy in the dip. never ever again under 131.
Good day for AAPL
How can I download the free speech Parler app ?Is it on the App Store ?What happened ???
so what changed with Apple between the last 2 weeks and today? LOL!
Waiting .....
Good day today! Long and patient.
Slickdeals guys! AAPL on a flash sale. possible price mistake!! get it while it lasts!
I’m not so sure about this:“JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee says Apple will ‘go big or go home’ with its electric car.The analyst says that the car will be completely autonomous and be built by Apple itself.”
I am long. Thanks for your 10 years work.
Does anyone know if AAPL is doing a buyback since they cashed in their bonds? I tried looking but couldn’t find any info
I think earnings were already baked into the recent climb. I think if they didn't beat projections it would have been ugly. Now we can continue our strong steady climb to 200. I got no problem with that.
Things that confuse me:1. Apple shorts2. Yahoo deleting my posts that don’t agree with their preferred narrative.
AAPL launching $3.000 virtual reality headset next year.
"Soon AAPL is going to be very bullish, all of the great news recently, a stellar earnings... all of these things haven’t just been forgotten. It’s on its way, and its close"
what should the Apple car look like?!
My question is why we are in $135 yet???
hmm... thought about putting some money into apple because I saw so many of my friends making money in tech... Everyone telling me not to get fomo now.. so I guess I'll wait for this to drop big.. seems like something big is going to happen in tech..
Canoo? #GOEV??
"Sell today.EVs won't fly. (Electricity is still generated mainly with fossil fuel, and EVs being heavy with batteries, tires wear fast, producing rubber waste.)"
Good buying opportunity!
"Let's look at AAPL average gains for the last 10 years. For the first 8 years, AAPL averaged 18% yearly gains. For the last 2 years, AAPL averaged 83% yearly gains. So the last 2 years grew more than the previous 8 years and those were very good years. New investors have a very unrealistic view. The 18% reality will only disappoint the ones who have only experienced the unrealistic euphoria of 83% expectations."
I have to believe this till test the $130 area by tomorrow.
What happened to parlor? rotation out of tech? Apple dead money?
"Let’s talk about Photon Control (PHO.TO), you should look at the fundamentals of this stock and its emerging market guys"
"Lets counter the shorts, hedge funds and after hour traders. Don’t sell. Do like they did with GME and make a social group on Reddit. « Financial Power to the people thanks to social média »."
"Bought apple shares, still have some money left"
We will see tomorrow. The reality has been that the stock just CANNOT hold daily gains. Closed up $2.62 after hours. Let’s see where it finishes tomorrow. Tired of this nonsense action of late day collapsing.
"In my opinion, while $AAPL may possibly go up in 2021, its high flying days are over."
I live in a smaller town and I know at least 8 people personally who spent their stimulus checks on new I-Phones...and that is just me in a small town in one corner of the country....imagine how many others did it too...I think the next two Q's are going to be blowout for AAPL and price will hit $250
"Bought a boatload of Apple in 2005. With all the splits that would have made it under $2. We BOTH retired early 50s because of this move. . Still our biggest holding for growth. We do all of our own trading as a money manager made us zip after a number of years. Moral of story....Buy Apple...you’ll never time it properly....just buy. That’s ok. Own Apple. Buy the dips. Don’t trade, Apple and you will be rewarded. "
"If someone wins the Mega Million lottery for $1 billion, should he invest half his winnings in Apple? Asking for a friend."
"Wednesday Jan 27, 2021 after market Apple earnings :) Despite expectations being high I believe Apple will beat!"
"I set a buy order at 137, 188, 138, 140. When Apple flight , flight quick. 145 today will happen. My keyword is not fast to catch good breaking point. Also I'll buy at the 1st candle. I don't care if drop, i have extra cash if pulldown to buy more"
"After spending an entire week going back and reviewing about 25 years of Apple's financial statements from the 1990s through 2020, all I can say is WOW. Never ever bet against it underestimate Apple. Apple is the home of iPod, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Airpods...and the soon to be announced Apple Glasses and Car.... all those under one roof... And so many other products that have become significant in American culture. Without a doubt, own it don't trade it."
"We will see another $3-4 tomorrow and Wednesday. After the bell on Wednesday, another $5.00. I think we will be sitting in a range of $151-155 on Thursday."
I expect close to 100 billions in sales watch the move
"yep, I am buying AAPL at any pullback. Every 0.40 cents I am buying. 150 gap-up tomorrow will happen. 20 years exp in wall street. Market maker knows that. tons of order to be cover after hours...buy buy"
Apple reported great numbers. Not sure why Apple in the after-hours market is down slightly.I guess people would rather pay $900 for Tesla and $389 for GME.Things will be fine and Apple will move up tomorrow.
Opinions on possibility of an apple search engine to rival google?
145 after hrs as I predicted Friday If we hit 150 tomorrow as I said You’re looking at 175-180 earnings maybe 185-190 Friday
"1st time appl owner, going to park some $ here for awhile. quarter was just tungsten steel strong"
Break out is coming
Will someone just buy some shares at $140? :)
"Stocks going to be $160 . Amazing earnings , Gov printing money !"
$12.50 increase in share from last 4 days. $150 next end of week.
"how do we go down when we crush earnings ,how,oh well just stay long i guess,god bless all"
Canoo $GOEV had talks with $AAPL to help create their EV car
Apple 7 watch to have blood glucose monitoring!!!
"I have owned aapl for many years. it was 2018 or early 2019 when it crushed earnings, and pounded the stock from 110 to 95. It took 2 weeks to make it back to 110. oh, buy the way, that was pre 4.1 split. what does that tell ya."
"Can you imagine if Apple comes out and says ""Hey shareholders, we have an electric car project and we are spinning that out to our existing shareholders. Each shareholder gets 1 to 1 share in the new co"". Now that would be spectacular!"
Big congrats Apple with historic earnings last night massive WIN let’s go fam 
"This is a total Joke, there is something screwy with this. There is no possible excuse for the stock failure of Apple. I'm thinking this will soar sometime soon."
Wasting your whole life watching this one boys...You could've doubled your money on a thousand other stocks in the past seven months. Guess is that apple must have the most uninformed investors...
"of this is such a good stock why is it below what it was last August. Buy other stocks beyond Meat, rad, sirli Rd are even better, get has nearly doubled in 6 months. This stock needs to spread the wealth"
Dow futures are up. Apple will open green. AH is just noise anyway.
Is Powell scheduled to speak tomorrow ?How about Yellen ?They usually tank any good news.
"Last week hedge fund crooks used AAPL, undervalued AMD, MSFT to bail out GME shorts after a great Q reports. In some cases limiting AMD to 1 share buy for the day, I hope today everyone pile up to buy this companies and destroy the hedge fund crooks..................."
aapl will stay between 100 and 155 until their EV is out. that's the next catalyst. Expect a huge drop as they lose the class action suit bricking iphone batteries for the 3rd time.
"Earnings will be epic. Cant wait to order my new Macbook Pro, new Magsafe, faster M1 processor. Outstanding technology that cant be denied."
This time AAPL will get to $700.00!
"Another great day, ifYou sold shameOn you! Another $3-$5 day tomorrow and Wednesday I bet we see $8-$10 more!!!"
"The three rules with Apple stock: 1) Buy, 2) Never sell, 3) repeat."
"Record 1st quarter, 2nd quarter earnings will most likely beat the estimates. New products coming, with undoubtedly others in the works we don't know about? EV car on the way. I see growth! Stock prices are forward looking, and IMO Apple's share price should be considerably higher than what it is! Seems like investors just aren't excited about Apple's future! Hopefully investors wake up soon?"
"Just $10 more today, who's having a coronary owning GME today? Jeez.."
Who thinks Apple will touch. 150 before it hits 110￼. Again?
It’s hard to understand at times with MSFT soaring and AAPL lagging behind 
Some thing coming soon that will raise AAPL to new Highs. GLTA
i want to buy some calls today for the earnings. Morgan Stanley has a target of $190 for AAPL. I am looking to add some $160 weekly calls today. May be get 200 of them during the day today.

Good earning expected ... like MSFT .. i bet
tomorrow will be a fun day
As a long term Apple shareholder I am disappointed that they have joined the move to ban free speech. If they are not going to make Parlor available then I will be selling my shares.
"@tanya look at Tesla and FB now, they are green"
"For you younger investors, learn from my mistake. I bought 500 shares of AAPL in 2004 and sold them in 2008 after making $50K to build out my basement. Those shares if kept with splits would now be 28000 shares and $3.5M in value on an original $48K investment. If you are looking 10 years down the road, I would hold. If you want to be whining like me later on, go ahead and sell."
Bought back in after a while. Let's gooooo......
Once the deal is finalized and Tim makes an announcement on the partnership the stock will move to 160
Short term thinking does you no favors with Apple. 30 day chart? Who cares?Take the long view.
What is happening? Market is up . This is down. Market is down. Then it’s down. Do people forget earnings is coming? Why still shorting and selling?
I think once we hear it from Tim Cook the lift will stick
Sellling is way overdone today. Bought a bunch of shares at $132 a few minutes ago. Thanks sellers!
"Don't chicken out and sell, YALL know AAPL will just keep hitting new highs all year long."
Does anyone else think the GameStop short squeeze is going to crash the market?
"earnings coming up, iPhone 12 was not on last earnings"
All the analysts are praising Apples strategic approach to the EV market and theyBelieve this will be disruptive technology to the car market because that is what Apple isFamous for doing..
"So let me get this straight. The so called ""Apple Car"" (basically a Korean KIA) won't be out until 2024. That's 3 whole years away. Tesla is already selling their 4th gen EV right now. By 2024 Tesla will already be selling their 5th gen EVs. Meanwhile Apple is just coming to market with their 1st gen Korean EV. Can you say: Apple Newton?!"
Apple will provide the hardware and software on the autonomous car that Hyundai/Kia will make. When the talks are finalized.
The market will only return to normal when GME hits 20 dollars again.
When will I receive my dividend - Let’s do the math - 40 Apple shares x .20 cents = $8
apple may have done better with zero earnings
"Impeachment gets voted and done so fast, stimulus takes months! Lol"
"Perhaps if you just posted about aapl in an aapl stock channel your comments wouldn't be removed as off topic or unrelated... Politics have their place here, as far as policy and affect. But your opinion of the former or current president has nothing to do with the happenings of apple. But, hey if it makes you feel better wearing the tin foil and saying its a conspircay, wrap that hat tight! But I'm going to continue cleaning up the boards."
FUTURES are green! Nasdaq is 90 and counting! Guess who is pushing it?
Let them try and short AAPL. The revolution will spread to all stocks and all sectors.Down with the Shorts!!!Down with the Hedgies!!!#biteit
Tomorrow at this time apple will be up 7-8% in AH
It’s a love hate relation with Apple stock. You have to be patient. It’s the most widely owned stock by retail investors and marketManagers. It’s usually the biggest holding in most large cap Index funds. You have to have the stomach to hold this stock long term. Just buy it and stop watching itEveryday unless you are trading it
Apple stock has turned into an Oinker lately. It's time for Apple shareholders to seriously think about divesting some of their Apple shares into other stocks...!
"This is unreal, Apple should trending upward from recent earning...going to place all my shares GTC for $1000 to protect it from being borrowed."
TSLA and AAPL partnership?? Both companies did a stock split offering back last year and now announcing ER same day...I think something is brewing between the 2
I’ll be adding more today
Lol just scaring you before good results and then it gets right back up.
Outrageous. AAPL has the best revenue fever but continue to stop after earnings. That goes to tell you how much the market is stealing your money. Whatever they want to do to play your heads. Stealing our $$ every day. This should be at 200 already.
thank you apple finally you give me 100%
"I have made tons of money investing in AAPLE over the years, but always looking to invest an early stage companies ready to take off. One company t that could dominate Hepatitis B vaccine market is DVAX. It is only $500 million market in the US to treat 900 thousand patients. However, there are 150 millIon patients in India, china, Korea still needs treatment to prevent liver cancer"". The market for HEPATITIS B vaccine is enormous. Europe is planning to approve HEPLISAV B vaccine next month. For the past 30 years only Hepatitis B vaccines dominating the markets were from. GSK AND SANOFI. THE BIG GIANTS OF PHARMACEUTICALS. However, DVAX Heplisav B is so much better it will completely dominate the Hepatitis B vaccine market in 5 years. All current Hepatitis B vaccines require 3 shots over 6 months period. Fortunately, Heplisav B only requires 2 shots over 30 days. US Military and DOD will be changing over to Heplisav B vaccine. I am pretty sure all military in the world will switching over. Military operates first by thinking Readiness. HEPLISAV B reduces members readiness time by 5 months with one less injection. Also current Hepatitis vaccines are only 78% effective. HEPLISAV B is over 92% effective in less than 30 days. No competition..game over for GSK AND SANOFI HEPATITIS B VACCINES. If you want to make money in 5 to 10 years, DVAX is good bet."
Watch for powerful guidance. No headwinds
I bought at $108.00. I will buy MORE. Apple is legit.
If this anomaly does not reverse by mid day tomorrow than some group is manipulating this stock. With the out of this world earnings there is no reason for this retreat. It just doesn’t make sense.
"Love to see AAPL go into the EV auto sector. Apply their technology and transform transportation,be it personal or business. Transform our cars to the next generation,better than the star ship Enterprise."
"The ""PARTY"" starts in a few minutes.......I hope this stock hits 160+++++"
EBAY PYPL didn't beat nearly as much as AAPL and they are in orbit.
"People....,Apple had a HUGE 14% run up to earnings....of course there is going to be some sell the news profit taking....this stock will be $185 by year end....patience"
AAPL & NAVI both on the rise!
AAPL earnings in 2 weeks ... Jan. 27. Buy on dips. BUY ON DIPS and hold going into earnings.
Up between 9 -12 dollars tomorrow easy
"Long. My average is 120, I’ll load up more if it goes below that. I’ve actually added some above that and I rarely add any at a higher rate."
Bought the dip today. with this company I've learned you buy every dip.I'm in this via FNGU. can't get enough of the run ups
138 by friday close
People selling AAPL right now are acting as if they didn't just sell an iPhone to every Indian with running water 100% growth YoY. Developing nations are finally ready to stunt some airpods.
best stock ever. power of trillion dollar maket cap
"In a new report from analytics firm Flurry Analytics, the iPhone took nine out of the top ten spots for smartphone activations this Christmas."
$vldr is best of breed lidar like $evgo is best of breed ev tech. Get to know the names folks $aapl does
"Anybody who is long on apple why do they come on to this chat? u bought apple put it in the fridge, it won't go bad."
"told you guys, this will reach 145 again. This is a sale lol"
Now! WE can make just as money leading into earnings as later.Stay Long.Let it RUN
"The rumour of the Apple car is out, but Apple cant sit on it forever. The patient investor will be rewarded soon with a confirmation and a production plan from Tim Apple."
MARKET TO RALLY EXTREMELY BIG AS GAMESTOP COLLAPSES. SOMEONE WILL DEFLATE THE BUBBLE
"See, what did I tell y'all earlier. The market is up hundreds of points and Apple can barely keep it up with 1 point or 1%. That's just sad!"
Rumored talks with several auto manufacturers may signal Apple has something they may all want to incorporate into EV vehicles. Never underestimate Apple.
Apple share price done. Flat for the next year.
"hedge funds buying all the shares cheap,when they are done. it will go up.. they're doing it to AMD also.. both great earnings.."
"Another beat! So predictable. Really, why do I bother with any other equities?"
what just happened? Everything just went red.
"Although I don’t mind it, but can someone explain to me why futures are up? It makes no sense."
It’s over. Cash out and buy something with value that’s under priced like $OXY or $XLE. Stay away from $TSLA. They’ve never made a profit except through selling tax credits....and $AAPL is the newest bubble. Who is buying a $1500 phone without a job?
"What I like best about this market is, stocks fall a lot faster than they go up."
During uncertainty the Friday sell off will be a norm. The money in the bank gives comfort and security.All will come back to buy Monday for another round.
What are you all panicking about? the ER isn't even out yet.
New records are coming
Apple is forever a worthy brand and it is always best for investors. No other brand can come closer to it.
Tomorrow premarket itself it will be pumped High 135 or 134.5 and then 137 likely possible ....Friday again options day so can’t expect much ...so technically they baked in 50% of the hike before earnings ...
looks like it will turn out to be a green day after a small sell off at the open. then the buyers will come in. multiple price target increases this morning. good for the stock
Futures down 1+ percent across the board. Could be another 500+ down day tomorrow. Apple will probably test 127-128 area if the market does not stabilize. That puts Apple down around 13% off the 145 high. Reversals are now swift in this market. So the open will be bad. Hopefully it triggers oversold programs to start the buyer instead of relentless selling
"ask yourself, what portion of your office parking lot is kia/Hyundai. mine is 40%."
"why is apple getting crushed ah went it blew away earnings,why,dont get it,im thinking todays drop and apple dropping ah after hitting a home run with earnings is a bad sign for the near term stock market,i think its starting to sink in that taxes and regulations that are coming,especially corporate taxes and the dems holding control in the whitehouse,house and now senate with kamala having the deciding vote spells trouble coming or else u are ignoring reality,god bless all"
I’m a patient guy but the fact that the stock isn’t able to hold gains let alone get out of a trading range is very frustrating
"11000 people lost good paying jobs on keystone pipeline with onecareless stroke of a pen of clueless, geriatric. Millions will be paying at least double for energyfor the next 4 years."
"Shorties move on elsewhere, long live the Longs."
Holding and watching my portfolio climb and climb.
"report isn't even out yet, patience"
Rewarding day for us longs! Let’s keep this up through earnings
Close today over 137.
"Retail investors, as we are called, please do not sell before market your shares of $AAPL today. Hold, good day ahead! Buy buy buy right now!"
"A properly planned VR set is another game changer.....VR could be huge, the applications are endless."
Looks like this historic record quarter reality is starting to set in. In a few short trading days getting AAPL under $150 will seem like a dream.
The problem with any business that Apple might stray into......is that it won’t be as good as phones and the App Store. Being a Dermatologist and getting full surgery pay for each little suspicious bump on somebody’s back is the only business more lucrative than what Apple already has.......So buy up dermatology practices.....or Buy Back Apple Stock!
Going to $138 today
Apples best earnings ever they said look for 175-185
Still a great time to buy in regardless of the car news
Sell this and buy GME. You won't regret it.
I don’t understand... is it really going down because hedge fund selling to cover their loss on FOMO stocks?
Shorts will cover at the end of the day and we will hit 137.00
140$ by the end of this week if not even more!
Headlines: “Tim Cook sounds slightly sheepish about how well Apple did in 2020”
"people are selling lmao when earning comes and apple hit 200! iPhone 12 pro max! sold out, headphones, home mini, apple store, apple music apple is an amazing company to invest so much supply and demands"
"About 4:35 Apple have will AMAZING earnings ..... Then ... Everyone will start running their months ... It will go up about 15 bucks , then 7 , then 12 , then 5 , then 12 again . Watch"
Check the stock price in September 1st 2020. 6 months with no progress? What's the problem? Lack of guidance?
apple product is loved by young people. apple stock is loved by old people.
Down on a good quarter? This should be an indication to buy the dip. AAPL will be $200 soon.
"I have to say that I’m surprised. Feels quite surreal:-futures where green-better job report than expected-all time high record breaking ER yesterday, in all reagions, in all products-beat analyst expectation by a mile-analysts between 150-200 price pointI guess that just means I’m holding"
Yikes; sinking like a stone. Was Bernie Madoff named CEO on Monday or something?
Opens at 137.60 tomorrow hits 140 then closes at 139.Friday 141 close and shorts lose.Go apple  Image every car with 5 iPads in it.
"AAPL is just building another strong bas for the next leg up.. post earnings, I'm happy as a clam!"
"Alright people, here it is:Monday: close 145$Tuesday: close 153$ Wednesday: close 160$Thursday (earnings boost): close 175$ or moreThe predictions have been shared, mark this post!"
Bought the dip!heading over to AMC see if I can add more to aapl today!
I hope AAPL takes a Super Bowl ad slot to announce new products or even their EV Apple concept car 
Money willStart flowing from Tesla and Facebook
"Given that true, production ready, full autonomous driving is achieved only by huge amounts of data getting fed into neural nets and Tesla is the only company who has huge amounts of data getting fed from a real world fleet AND given that Apple's venture into vehicles will be all about the interior user experience, which will be best experienced in an autonomous vehicle - I predict Apple is going to license Tesla FSD and Elon would welcome Apple helping him achieve Tesla's goal of pushing EVs from 4% to at least 50% by 2030. I don't think level 2 or 3 is what Apple is after. I don't see another viable option. What do you think?"
Pins..Wha Hoo!!!. I knew this ticker was going no where but up when I bought at 35 when my 17 year old daughter told me this is what her and all her friends were using. Follow the trend. Pins is going nowhere but up..

Why is this down - I’m conflicted and confused. Can any one shed light. No robots auto response please - Thanks
I am out. will by back when stock price is lower.
Always never fails fund managers manipulate this before earnings to make out like a bandit. It’s unbelievable
"What other company produces and sells more than $1BILLION a day??? Tim Cook & Company continue to defy Moore’s Law. AAPL going higher, just maybe not today cause all the HEDGIES uneasiness"
Buying more
According to a credible analysis Apple will 170$ because of high IPhone 12 sales.
Twitter and FB are disposable products that can be easily replaced/boycotted. AAPL is much more diversified. I'll stay with AAPL.
Apple the laggard stock doing what it does best on a green market day: Go Down!
every push above 135 is met with relentless selling pressure to keep it under 135.... guess we close right around 135 or so.
"So many disappointing comments on here even from some of the long term holders, relax please.Apple is going to be fine, don’t give up so easy, if u have been in the stock long enough you know in 6 months it will be higher and 1 year even higher and so on!"
"Excerpts from the Motley Fool. 1. You still have to wait forever to get an iPhone 12 Pro Apple is reportedly ramping up production for the iPhone 12 in the first half of 2021. Combined with other factors suggesting very strong iPhone sales for the quarter, the higher ASP should lead to iPhone revenue significantly outperforming. And considering iPhone accounts for 50% of revenue, and typically closer to 60% in the first quarter, that should have a meaningful impact on its revenue versus expectations. 2. Suppliers are posting big revenue numbers Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, Foxconn, announced record revenue for the month of December. The Taiwanese company, which trades as Hon Hai Precision, reported sales of 713.8 billion New Taiwan dollars (about $25.5 billion) for December, and quarterly revenue of NT$2 trillion. That beat expectations of NT$1.8 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Foxconn's outperformance is also in line with the greater-than-expected demand for the iPhone 12 Pro. The company is the exclusive supplier of the high-end devices. Meanwhile, Dialog Semiconductor raised its fourth-quarter revenue outlook from a range of $380 million to $430 million to between $436 million and $441 million, Barron's reports. The chipmaker cited increased demand for 5G chips as the reason. Considering Apple accounts for the majority of its revenue, it's a pretty good bet those chips are going in iPhone 12s. And in late December, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said his Asia supply chain checks ""have now exceeded even our 'bull case scenario'"" in a note to investors. 3. New records in the App Store Apple reported record gross sales for its App Store in its annual new year update. In the week between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, iOS users spent $1.8 billion in the App Store. That's up 27% from last year, and an acceleration from the 16% growth in sales in the same period in 2019. The company also recorded $540 million in sales on New Year's Day, up nearly 40% from last year. Those numbers indicate a lot of new iPhones under the tree this year. It also bodes well for Apple's all-important services segment -- its fastest-growing and highest-margin business. The App Store is Apple's most profitable service, generating gross profits well above its subscription services like Apple Music or Apple TV+. So outperformance on that front should lead to better-than-expected earnings. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty notes, ""If we keep the rest of our December quarter Apple Services forecast unchanged, the latest App Store data would imply December quarter Services revenue of $14.84 [billion] ... 40 [basis points] ahead of consensus at $14.78 [billion]."" It's very likely, however, that stronger App Store sales are a good indication of stronger sales of Apple's other services. It looks like the iPhone supercycle may be a reality this year based on the early results we've seen and other hints at strong demand. And that'll bolster Apple's entire business -- and the FAANG stock -- when it reports its full results on Jan. 27."
2 days from 127 up ... 136.5 ...Remarkable
Keep telling myself to sell every stock I own and put it all in Apple
"I'm going to continue to buy Apple as the company going forward has products like the Iphones, eye glasses and even the electric vehicle that will make this stock price look cheap. Then on top of it the subscription fee for having an app on there phone. They clearly have a ""MOAT"" there and some might even say a monopoly. No Apple has a lot of money and clearly there options to include even stock b uy backs are numerous. Investing is a slow get rich process and not a get rich quick scheme. That's why I would tell investors I have been investing for forty years and compounding my investments have paid off handsomely for me and I hope for you investors also. Good luck."
Woefully undervalued... Just had a 100 billion plus quarter... Apple is easily a 3 trillion dollar company by end of 2022
"I can retire with my Apple shares. But I want more and more and more so I'm never selling any shares I own. If this goes down, I'm buying more. I'm even going to buy the ICar."
"So, the news about the car is all fabricated #$%$Three times they tried this and all three times the manipulation failed.Back to 125 or lower for Cook folly"
"Congrats to all apple shareholders on the 111B Q report! Though, I'm wondering why were down on the aftermarket? Shouldn't apple shares increase in price right now?!?!?"
Until the election results are corrected the stock market will continue to slide! Long time stock holder with buy order in at 120.
"in response to Richard H's question, how can Apple build a car in such a short amount of time and the battery system as well? Well there are very reliable rumors that Apple has sent a group to China to visit ,meet and talk with NIO electric vehicle manufacturer, about possibly working with each other to develop one for Apple,, since NIO has been added for six years now and is one of the high-end cause in the EV market even ranked number one over the other six companies with Tesla actually came in number six in overall quality and customer satisfaction, so that it is always that possibility that if that merge would have happened in building a car together it would be beneficial to both companies big time, because doing it alone Apple is now stepping out of their boundaries, but doing it with a successful and highly rated proven vehicle manufacturer it could be very viable and profitable, time will tell, Happy New year everybody!"
WE WOKE... TWITTER GO BROKE!!!!!!!WHO'S NEXT $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL
Because we had a record breaking quarter this should recover pretty fast plus EV on the horizon
Facebook not looking good! Maybe they have a sell off and it brings money to Apple 
Are you too excited for these companies to rush into the market ? Hmmmm because I am!!!
"whatever is going on right now is due to shorts selling, report isn't even out. ignore everyone who says they missed"
Basically copied Nancy Peliso position on DIS AAPL TSLA
I will never buy another AAPLE product. I am currently awash in apple products. I will never buy or use another google product as well.
Aapl gets rid of Parler and the stock is exploding upwards!!
Will APPLE CREATE A SEARCH ENGINE TO DOMINATE GOOGLE? Imagine if APPLE discontinued using and paying Google by creating iSearch. Apple has mentioned it as a possibility before. Can you say APPLE WORTH $5 Trillion......?!Long Apple
Ouch $$135 call writers unhappy today!
"Apple is being shorted. Redditors and Robinhooders make this jump past 1,000. "
(ADOM) 0.44 /CHEAPEST of all Electric Vehicle gems =2000% UPSIDE...
So most of the regular investors bought Apple after what happened with game stop our they punishing the little guy in retaliation?
Apple/Kia will undercut the Tesla in price. A car for the masses. Almost every Apple sale comes out of Tesla’s hide. . ‘Bout time Musk is taken down a peg hehe .
That's $AAPL. Bad market tomorrow. Never know. I like day trading better. No stock is too good to sell.
AAPL is currently priced at just north of 20% earnings growth every year for the next 10 years. The last ten years were 16% growth with the greatest growth in 2011 to 2015. Apple .s a 2.5 trillion company where is all that cash going to come from to fuel that 20% growth…stock buybacks i don't think are the answer.
Hyundai & Kia build quality & assembly are far superior to Tesla! They build safe dependable quality cars.
My spidey senses are tingling for at least a 140 close today/tomorrow
Patience investors. The cream always rises to the top.
Something seriously wrong with this picture. We have the following :https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2021012715206/apples-iphone-12-helped-deliver-a-record-1114-billion-quarter-2nd-updateAnd yet it drops almost $5.00 after hours.
Are we not up five or six dollars per share from one month ago?
I have a small sell order in at 152... maybe I will up that to 165
Sometimes I wish Apple  would report earnings in the morning before the bell. My accounts not set up for after hour trading.
What happened AH?
APPL on sale? Always a good bargain
"Based on Current trend, Apple will cross 150 in a month"
17B shares !!!!! Cook never should have split this
decent bounce today. I hope the rest of the week is as good!
Glad FB is up 4% but not Apple the best company in the market. Absurd
I ain’t selling! This thing did $111 billion in one quarter! Nothing short of a Mona Lisa when it comes to the execution of a masterpiece brilliance of Apple. Deserves a much higher multiple!
earnings not matter anymore. look Microsoft . RED :)
THE MARKET WILL NEVER GOING DOWN ANYMORE UNTIL THE FED WILL NOT DECIDED TO STOP TO PRINT AND RAISEBTHE RATES FROM 0 WILL BE NOT BEFORE 2023 . UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PEOPLE'S WAITING THE MARKET TO DROP WILL TAKES YEARS. I AM NOT SAY THAT WILL GO TO 35.000 BUT WILL STAYNIN THIS RANGE GOOD TO COLLECT THE DIVIDEND BUT NOT TO INVESTING. IF YOU DIDNT INVEST LAST MARCHBWHEN DROP STAY AWAY NOW AT 31.000 IS TO DANGEROUS TO INVESTING

"Don’t forget the month end is near which means a massive infusion of cash into the stock market via 401k and 403b plan , IRA, pension funds etc etc. That should drive the market higher . And Fidelity has stated new accounts opened were up by 19% last year which means more conscious Americans are beginning to think of the future rather than just depending on S.S. And finally my uncle Warren is always looking for opportunities to invest. Every time he is eating ice cream at the local Dairy Queen he is contemplating his next investment and his next move. No wonder he smiles a lot. Watch him laugh . It is a combination of smile , grin, chuckle and laughter. That’s what success does to you ."
Why we have $142 yet? Should be $150
"Do yourself a favour and don’t wait to buy AH or tomorrow, order now before it does exactly what MSFT did yesterday"
I know Apple has reacted the same after ER in the past. Just crazy how they can have record earnings and drop two straight days. The market is a weird place

It’s been playing the same game for months. I personally is very tired of the pattern. Can’t wait to get out. I don’t want to gain a fine. Just let me break away even at this w. Got in almost 5 months ago at 133. Can’t wasting my time and watch other stocks goes up. AAPL l surrender. Can’t stomach it anymore.
"Look at FB and msft ! Really cannot understand what's happening after that earnings report. For those of you who say ""soon green"" what are your reasons ???"
"Vanguard, Blackrock, Berkshire, and State Street have corporate control over 50% of the US stock market! These giant index fund businesses have too much shareholder power. Their trade activities should be audited at all times for compliance, and perhaps they should be prevented from selling any options at all"
I will see you at $150+ after earnings. Merry Christmas
"Congress, the SEC and big hedge funds rigged the Stock Market to ILLEGALLY steal from taxpayers. Reddit proved they are “CROOKS” by exposing GAMESTOP. They won’t change their corrupt rules because they will incriminate themselves. They undermined the Stock Market causing honest pension funds and small investors to lose Billions. Who will invest in a Rigged Market? Where is our POTUS?"
If they don’t talk about the car. Down goes apple. Still a great long hold.
"AAPL should get up to $140 by the end of the day heading us into the weekend. If not, I would think this trades in the $140 to $145 range next week. Hopefully, even higher. Good luck all!"
does this mean Apple gets a Tesla valuation on top of it lol

AAPL WILL LEAD THE MARKET HIGHER. BE PATIENT AND WATCH YOUR MONEY GROW. GLTA
"A new report by Flurry Analytics states that nine of the top ten smartphones activated on Christmas Day 2020 in the United States were iPhones.Christmas Day in the United States is the single greatest day for new smartphone activations, so it represents a unique opportunity to analyse consumer preferences.The iPhone 11 was the most activated device on Christmas Day, with activations five percent higher than the trailing average of the period between December 18 and December 24. This is the second consecutive year that the iPhone 11 has taken the top spot, followed by the iPhone XR. The leading premium device was the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which has continued to see ""strong and long-lasting demand.""This ranking is in line with normal trends, as Apple's newer and higher-end devices generally only surge around launch due to early adopters. The iPhone 12 has made gains as users gradually replace their existing devices in the months after launch. Some smartphones, such as the iPhone XR, were not more popular than the trailing average for that device, meaning that it was not necessarily a popular gift for Christmas, but rather just a popular smartphone.The only non-Apple device to reach the top 10 was LG's budget K30 smartphone. Overall, budget devices dominated the top ten, with the iPhone SE and LG K30 seeing 34 percent and 181 percent surges respectively. Flurry believes that the success of past years' models, such as the iPhone 11 and iPhone XR, indicates that American consumers were more price-sensitive this holiday season.One notable exception from the top ten is the iPhone 12 mini, which has seemingly failed to catch consumers' attention as much as other devices, perhaps due to its discount of only $100 compared to the larger iPhone 12.This year, smartphone activations were down 23 percent year-on-year. Flurry speculates that this may be due to financial hardships, more limited family gatherings, or more spread out gift-giving this year.Flurry Analytics uses data from over one million mobile applications, providing insights from two billion mobile devices per month, and it will soon report on the full month of December to give a fuller picture of smartphone activations."
Just bought more $AAPL
Apple will be the leader in VR AR EV SW HW whatever they want 
folks don't worry be happy. We will see better days folks. Thanko
"I've bought and held AAPL for over 10 years. During that time I've gained on average $100K per year. However last year I averaged $100K PER MONTH! I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it makes me think of Warren Buffett's familiar quote: ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful."""
Just think of it this way: lower share prices in the short term are good for long term holders because it means Apple can buy back its shares at cheaper valuations.
almost down 10 bucks in just one day
Today AAPL's bonus package indicates AAPL's profits are well above projections for 2020
The rebellion needs to spread into Apple now. The manipulation of this stock is brutal. The shorts are trying to keep the price down with relentless selling pressure even though the company earnings was the best quarter ever. People need to hold and never sell their share and keep buying to drive the price up to eliminate the short sellers.
"Remember what buffet said, he has seen 7 republican presidents and 7 democratic presidents, he said all the news and #$%$ only has a short term effect that effects the newbies and the panic investors and the option purchasers that are too bullish. Be a smart investor, dont be greedy, know the power of compunding interest. slow and steady growth. AAPL has always been a mover by earnings, and stablizes itself in a zone until the next one."

Apple diluted it's shares so bad trying to get more investors and affordability. That's wasn't a smart move in that they are buying their shares back. I hope this stock rises to 200 this month where it belongs.

TSM is not interested in Intel design business and Intel can keep that to themselves to keep their business secrets but why Intel adding more cost to their chips by fabricating their own chips instead of outsourcing to TSM which can fabricate better and cost effectively.

I'm a little confused. Apple expect to have record quarter. Why are people scared and selling. Do you think apple will stop selling services phone and computer? And when the finally announce an icar then that's a whole nother market to dominate. Scared money don't make money. 100 billion in a quarter and people are running scared? Go figure. If you are so easily manipulated then I can only imagine your political views .

"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported better-than-expected fiscal-year first quarter results, aided by strong iPhone momentum, especially in China.The Apple Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty maintained an Overweight rating on Apple and increased the price target from $152 to $164.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and $175 price target.Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated an Outperform rating and increased the price target from $150 to $160.Needham analyst Laura Martin maintained a Buy rating and hiked the price target from $140 to $170.Why Apple Could Be Set For Double-Digit Growth: The combination of larger installed base, fully refreshed product portfolio and continued working and learning from home trends suggest Apple is on track to report strong double-digit growth over the next several quarters, Morgan Stanley's Huberty said in a note.The iPhone's strength, especially in China, and across-the-board Services upside contributed most of the beat, and gross margin expanded about two points, the analyst said.Although Apple did not provide formal revenue guidance, it said it expects normal seasonal trends, suggesting revenue of about $76 billion to $78 billion, she said.This is about $3 billion ahead of the consensus, Huberty said.The active device installed base growth accelerated from 7% a year ago to 10% and services monetization grew at the fastest rate in several years, the analyst said.Customer loyalty remains well north of 90% across Apple products, she said.Morgan Stanley now estimates 2020-2025 revenue CAGR of 10%, thanks to accelerating installed base growth, improved services monetization and a recovery in China. Higher gross margins are sustainable given growing FX tailwinds and a continued mix uplift across products, Huberty said.""Net, we raise our forward revenue and margin estimates with FY21 EPS increasing 6% to $4.47 and FY22 EPS increasing 8% to $4.61, both materially above consensus.""Buybuybuy "

"Apple new 52 wk high :-) ACRX record volume, & up 25%! ACRX being acquired? ACRX news leak!!!"
$AAPL closes week at 136-138
"Investor's Business Daily: Among the Dow Jones stocks, Apple and Microsoft are among the top stocks to buy and watch in February 2021. I have to agree and I'm a buyer at this ridiculously low price!"
"I should’ve bought before the days end, gotta try and hop in quick on Monday, next week looks like it’ll be a monster week."

Apple and Kia partnership will be announced very soon
Don’t miss the train .. Jump in early morning BB the future .. to the moon Blackberry and Chinese search engine giant Baidu have agreed to expand a partnership that aims to give automakers the tools they need to launch next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.
PLUS AAPL will be buying back more stock next week.
"770,000 filed for unemployment vs 830,000 expected. Oh my good God we are getting there towards 100 % employment and people will need and buy things they need such as I Phones etc. My my we are on our way."
No guidance is the reason for the pull back? They never give guidance. It will be positive after the opening bell. The future continues to look very strong.
A lot of shorts!! Luv it!!...we are going higher fast!
"There we go, US Stock Futures Magically jumps within 3-4 seconds. Another day, and The Price of Everything is Getting PUMPED across the Board! Enjoy US Stock and Oil BUBBLE...What a PONZI SCHEME!$AAPL $AMZN $BLK $JPM"
"I’m pretty sure we will have and uptick in share price this week, between profit taking and sellers needing money to cover elsewhere I feel that is all behind us! Let’s not forget we just had the best earnings in history! History! Multiple analysts have raised price targets once again! Glad I bought on the dip last week and May also add to my position on Monday depending upon how fast the share price rises!￼"
"Pay attention to MSFT reporting after today's close. If they will eat up expectations (expected as I sure hope cause I own a decent amount but not as much as AAPL), then watch AAPL AH people trying to catch up. That would translate NOT only AAPL will blow earnings to smithereens, but A MAJOR LIFT OFF GO APPLE!!!"
"Freaking oinker of a stock. The market goes way up, it goes sideways. The market goes down, it goes way down. I'm seriously considering divesting my 5000 shares of Apple which I've held since 2006 into other stocks! I'm fed up with this oinker Apple!"
Could it be one of those 6% + days?
"John Lawrence, doubling his position in AAPL."
Look at a 10 day chart. Apple is not down. CNBC is a TRADERS news platform. They're talking about it being down as if it didn't run from $128 to $145 since Jan 20th
Buying Opportunity!
Yesterday I sold my last 1000 shares of CHL and bought 200 shares of AAPL with the cash. Looks like I made a big mistake.
"“Apple's Macs enjoyed a bumper fourth quarter of 2020, according to IDC, with shipments reportedly up almost 50% year-on-year, and helping Apple to become the fastest-growing major computer vendor for the entirety of 2020.”More M series macs coming out this year, with real ‘pro’ stats. I’m personally very much looking forward to new 16 inch MacBook Pro"
Going to be an explosive earnings report.
The way I understand this is that Apple isn’t rushing into the electric car business but rather making a fully autonomous car that will hopefully be ready in a couple of years. It’s a great idea. Will investors like it? Definitely is my thought
Apple  160 after earnings report
uh.. the struggle is real
"$200 by year end given no major natural disasters or worldwide crisis. 5G phones are kicked in with new super cycle, this time services, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, Apple News, iCloud, and Apple TV. Just hold apple and don’t trade."
A message to all retail traders ! Shift the short squeeze from GameStop to apple and the system would not be able to shut you down ! They would have no control and the hedge funds would pay a heavy price for robbing us common folk !
Today Nasq will be upAAPL will close over $145 tomorrow $148 if we can get to $149-150 we are in position for a pop bestEver earnings this will move $167-175 +
"What many of you seem to be missing is the new rising tax burden on corporations and individual investors (YOU) is going to weigh heavy on the market. It doesn’t matter how much money a company makes if the government takes away most of it. I remain LONG Apple, but I am not optimistic."
Monday will be $150. I am all in on apple 
My take: they'll park this at 137.50 tomorrow to kill all the options. You're dreaming if you think this is going to gap up to 150.......like I said...it's about killing the options contracts for 137.50 / 140 / 142.50. Tomorrow is end of the month...triple witching hour in the Options world.
Unbelievable earning result! Great job Apple! We will see this stock flying again soon.
"APPLE EARNINGS ARENT EVEN OUT LOL AND SHORTS ARE SAYING ""MISSED"""
"AAPL is once again proving to be a disruptor. Love the new privacy feature and big middle digit to FB. I'm going on six months w/o social media. Don't miss it at all. Feeling happier & more connected. ...and to the Republic for which it stands, ONE nation, under GOD, indivisible, with liberty & justice for ALL. A bet against America has never gone well. Let's support what keeps us together & makes the world a better place while getting rich."
Apple gets a price boost to $160 from Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani who says the Apple Car will be 'a computer on wheels.'

"Now transferring data from my older iPhone SE (second generation) to my new iPhone 12 mini. Same size iPhone, more display space.I have 5G connectivity, baby. 5G."
"why is Apple down again. I think the analyst are all wrong about this Apple,"
"Apple is not a good stock to own anymore, things are changing just like COVID did to the worlds. People are going for the quick money and that's all there is too it. Look at all the quick hitters that made people rich, Tesla, GME, AMC and many more. Why buy the Apple and PG stock when its a waste of years waiting for a $10 gain. F this. READ THIS"
VIX is down 4.38% a sure indication that Nasdaq and S&P will rise sharply. VXN is unchanged

"i have hard time understanding of why AAPL. stock price is crashing , while at the same time too many financial expert are upgrading the price target to 150 to 170"
What a STINKER Apple stock is. Solid green market days and it goes down. STINKER!
Lets pray for a good earning and hope that will push to 140.
The market isn’t reviving anytime soon. It might have one jump left in it tho
Apple rises with the market and falls with the market. Long term it’s doing fantastic but will go down during a selloff. Next week will be interesting. I’m thinking things turn green next week but I ain’t no Warren Buffet
@Dennis muted no brain no experience and nothing to learn from him. This is not a casino
Shorts better cover down $4 30/40mins ago and now less than $1
"Strong Buy,Strong Buy,Strong Buy at this current very very low price because very soon It's going to be $200 plus. (very very strong buy)Bullish"

Why is APPL being shorted?
Sounds like a good short squeeze coming tomorrow. Send aapl to 155.
CNBC did a good job talking up possible Appl-Hyundai joint venture!More good news.
"So you’re telling me $AAPL put them on App Store? I’m super bullish and in! I’ve had on watchlist FOREVER since NFIN, pt 15"

"We are one step closer to ""The Apple Car"".....Apple is partnering with Hyundai-Kia to build electric/autonomous vehicles. Oh boy, this is going to be good."
Apple has gone up 100 fold since 2004. All I ask is that it kindly do the same in the next 10 years.
"AAPL  Up Up and away. What a beautiful day. Those who are long, celebrate. It’s going to be a beautiful ride."
Still down AH - book it - Boolean
big money going scorched earth. see who blinks first. they got $$$$. 20% correction to put the hurt on. big recovery 2nd half.
Executive order to increase S.S. Payments should happen soon as promised before the elections. Also reverse the windfall elimination tax
Apple is at the highest point  and it is still Low now.
"Comparison between MSF ( Real ) / APPLE (estimates) :EPS Increase Q1 2020/21 : 20% / 12%-20% ( 20% considering the always analysts 0.10 error )Sales Increase Q1 2020/21 : 6% / 12%Projected Sales 2021 Increase vs. 2020 : 10% / 16%I Think Apple has better numbers than MSF , the EPS will be the ""weakness"" ratio. At least Apple shouldn't fall..... If someone has other vision please share.TX"
150 on earnings
170 tomorrow AH
"145 today and 150 tomorrow, and there is nothing U can do about it."
AAPL short percentage to outstanding shares is real low but with 99.9 million shares short it ranks only second behind TSLA with total number shares shorted
AAPL breaks out of the handle yesterday and already back tested point of breakout and resumed higher highs and closed green on big volume. Buying dip. Lets see some follow through today. Good Luck
DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES! MMs ARE STAGNATING PRICE TO SCOOP SHARES. EVERY HIGH-PROFILE INVESTOR IS EYEING AAPL. PLEASE LISTEN.

"Google and Amazon report this week. If they report great earnings Apple could see a big bump this week! Hopefully this Reddit matter subsides, and the institutional boys can stop selling to their top holdings to cover their short losses?"

I have a feeling the stock is coiled and will rip up tomorrow.
Apple -7 points (-5%) for the week but nasdaq - 550 points too (-4%)
What would be a good entry price?
"Not 150$ yet? Lol funny... guess market is brain freezed, nonesense..."
The after hours buy volume is incredible!
"Need honest opinion, as a youngster I put all my money around 20k and bought some 3700 calls expiring Feb 19. Already down 50% on them. What should I do?"
I recently saw that the talks with Kia have been paused.... might be a good buying opportunity next week.
just want to give aapl a thumb up before calling it a day! really a great firm on the right track! listening to their earning is much better experience than FB....
Apple is getting a ton of CNBC coverage today. Buy now or pay a whole lot more 5 years from now!
"just like every Friday for weeks, good looking setups get run over every time."
I put a sell order for all my shares at $$$165.00
So Tim Cook was not a good CEO for the past few days based on some of the posts and just became a genius after hours? LOL.
"Steady , up from split , quoting percentages ...... Compared to other ""Big Tech"" this stock is very frustrating !! Only thing I can think of with their Blowout earnings and positive news is ""THEY"" are holding it down for now !!"
I wonder if Apple going to use different car manufacturers?Entry: HyundaiMid: Mazda/ToyotaPremium: Tesla
cramer writes 5g is gaining momentum. apple is a top 5g play
Bill gates has Apple  apple cars will be needed for climate change
"Yesterday was the lowest volume since Dec 14th.It appears the action will centered around $135 strike price for awhile, going forward.As the ""Board historian"" I have seen AAPL do this over the years Sometimes this may last a month or even six weeks."
"Amazing Amazing earnings. 100Bill quarter. What other company can make that claim? The markets are very volatile right now, otherwise Apple would be up to 150 after hours. Keep your eye on the ball. This is the most profitable company in U.S. history with a massive pile of cash and is on the cusp of entering into AI and EV. Buy the dips and ignore the short term noise. This should meet or beat all the bullish price targets by the end of the year."
This will continue up after inauguration when people realize the sky is not falling.
The market is reacting the the White House press conferences over this past week. You can't get anymore anti-business friendly. Elections have consequences.
I’ll have 1500 shares after the dividend later this week. I will hold them another 4 years at least.
You can tell alot from job posting...
If anyone discounts we are in a bubble just look at $pltr todayFyi $spy $aapl $amzn
"Even a smooth rollouts of coronavirus to every citizens, it may not help Apple share rise to $200.00 unless Apple CEO Tim Cook announce to materially sign contracts to build Apple car."
so glad I bought 500 more shares yesterday
Not a big fan/user of all the over-priced Apple products... but I LOVE this stock. My Apple gains paid me more this year than my actual job. Thank you Apple
This is exciting!
The reddit trade stocks are crashing
Take a look at Netflix. That's Apple after their blowout earnings report.
if i do the math- apple gross profit a day... $600million A DAY!
Monday will be strong reversal aapl 137 138 just pray this my guess
"No revenue until 2023, nothing to see here - Buy $GOEV instead, possible $AAPL partnership through Hyundai."
GameStop pre market compared to Apple just sums it all up really
Yeehaw! This is getting good! Stay strong lads.
After Fed economic policies update 2 PM the market will U turn upside. Stay positive relax and stay AAPL long.
"Why wouldn’t Cook, knowing AAPL shareholders have been cheated this past week, come out and say (or leak) something like Musk does simply to drive shareprice higher?"
I will betcha that AAPL makes a deal with Ford instead of Kia. I think AAPL is going to buy Ford for the Manufacturing Capacity.
"Prediction: Apple's venture into autos will fail. It might be a failure on the same level as ""New Coke""."
125 billion in sales for the quarter would be insanity. 20% margin 25 billion profit....17 billion shares is 1.47 EPS
Tomorrow we see $170.
"South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd reported its highest quarterly profit in over three years on Wednesday, with help from increased shipments of Apple Inc's new iPhones."
Apple is a major player with immaculate financials. It was also one of warren buffets main earners for 2020 despite him shorting a portion of his stock. Long term buy even still even now.
"This stock has pretty much had positive momentum forThe last 5 years after earnings for this quarter. I don’t see any selling happening after earnings release, at least not enough to lower the SP."
Markets are doing great and Apple lagging like always. Watch when we have a couple red days Apple will be way down. Unbelievable
News is out that Apple is developing a VR+AR headset to be sold next year. Read the description on Bezinga website (yahoo doesn’t let me post the link here). The product features and capabilities sound very exciting.
If you were selling this morning...you probably have no business owning this stock or any stock.
Send message by not buying Apple products for 6 months. When sells drop next quarter maybe they will think twice about censoring.
Haaaaa this will keep the shorts away. Like bug spray
"So, market is UP. Fine, I have shares in 24 stocks out of which only 5 are green and that too none of them exceeds 3%. Are you kidding me? How can it be with each major index gaining more than 1%. Strange"
There was a lot of action at $137.50 .
Long term play sell 150$
"As announced yesterday this bear trap market, it is going to be a slaughter for shorts..."
Up $3.45 one day and down 43 cents the next ain’t nothing. That’s a normal market move. More news about their car plans is imminent. The next couple of months should be a fun ride
And why is this down 4% on top of the 4% yesterday?
Thank God I decided to wear underwear today!
"AAPL is the most widely held stock in the market and is modestly tanking on decent numbers. Ummm, get a clue this market party is over. Look at the VIX for confirmation."
4:30 longs
"Lot of us take financial seminars to learn more about investing and here is the secret and it costs nothing : (1) stay long (2) buy and hold your core holding . Over 31 but I will list a few=Apple, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, nxp, Marvell, Qualcomm, Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, Target, Microsoft, etc etc and then invest in mutual funds such as from Fidelity etc etc . Buy Blue Chip Growth, Growth Companies (if closed to new investors it will guide you to an alternative), Fidelity Select semiconductor (a severe shortage for semiconductors is expected in 2021 and onwards), OTC, Fidelity Select Technology, Fidelity Small Capital Growth etc etc. Then sit back and relax enjoy life minimize stress and watch your investments grow. Make sure you add to your investments on a regular basis. Then take over other hobbies like reading, golfing, camping, swimming, yes going to Church, spend more time with your family and friends etc etc"
why are they saying apple is in talks with kia? isn't this deal done?
"If you want something good ($$$), then you mid term patients is priceless."
Whoever is selling Apple shares right now are most likely hedge funds liquidating shares to pay for AMC and GME.
Cup -n -handle formation is the most bullish of chart patterns. We Got it... The right side of the handle to form as we get closer to earnings. $138 by next Wednesday
Will go back up to $137
Thank you to ever sold. I got back in apple for a great price

European stocks are up which usually is a good sign
"Given that earnings report, no one would had thought AAPl would be down 10% rather than up 10% .That's the markets. You can never expect the irrational to act rational"
I'm proud to have a pair of 
"I used to watch Apple and be concerned if it dipped... now after having some experience with it, I have decided that I really don’t care what it does on any given day because it’s an incredible stock. I can step away on a vacation and not worry about it because it’s such a good long term play. Own it! Don’t trade it!"
I am hoping this stays around even going into earnings because they will crush expectations. I am looking for at least 5%-6% gain when earnings are announced!!
"It's a pretty healthy consolidation since open today, more buying will come in last hour of trade. Microsfot & Amazon earnings will fuel AAPL close to 150. Holding long for a 100Billion+ quarter !"
Fully autonomous APPLE car 2024.  HOLD.
Nice to see everyone in a good mood. What’s no to like?

Too many misguided investors are buying poor performance companies and drive price way up. Here is the winner with quality and tomorrow we see $170.
Now 6 more months of stagnation?
Looks alot like the AAPL chart pattern of February to July 2015….tomorrow will confirm or not
Slowly going up!!!
GameStop will crash this week with people taking profits. Money will flow back into fang.
"Hello....investors? Over here. You know, the company that has $195.57 billion in cash on hand and just made $111 billion dollars in three months...more than most companies make in a year! Buy me already!!"
Every time I buy it go down then I sell I went up. Please give a advice. Many thanks
Can’t waste 500 point Dow days like this. utterly DISGUSTING action after good earnings.
Will AAPL hit $145 after earnings on Jan 27?
funny how the market takes a breather and shorties think it's the end of the world
I think APPLE SPLIT was a mistake. It has not been trading normal since then.
Can anyone explain why the stock price went down after they smashed revenue estimates on their iPhone and Macbooks?
Miramar and then comes Taiwan. Where does apple get there chips.

this GME saga proves the game is rigged and will fail.
Own it. Don’t trade it. Just sit back and relax.
Apple announced they are ramping up the pace of Bond Sales as stock Buybacks seen rising - per Bloomberg News today.Excellent news for share holders as this will continue to drive the share price higher
Saw this coming but of course bought more before earnings. A company that continues to outperform others time and time again. A year from now this won’t matter that we’re down today
"40 years and he hasn't done a thing.""I am going to act, and act fast ""Yea right."
Hope it goes 135 tomorrow...

Dow down 120....Apple up $1.15. Nice.
Sure am glad I have me some Apple!
time to enjoy 
Bought this stock back in the days $3500 worth of Apple stocks .... after splits I’m now sitting at $1.3 Million! I’m not selling but what’s happening right now is really scary! Big hedge funds are selling tech stocks and shorting the market to make up the losses from meme stocks like GME AMC etc etc. they will force retail investors to sell .... don’t come with the “hold don’t sell” people get very emotional when seeing red days... meaning a gap down on Monday can easily cause a crash! Don’t forget that Robinhood is limiting buying but you can sell all your portfolio. This is a trap! Trade wisely!
"Amazing! now let the stock work for you and go watch your netflix! Don't expect to see huge spikes right away, it will go up when the institutions will have to secure their #$%$LT investment"
Muting (MASA) was the best trade of the day!
"No one is getting rich trading Apple. The only ones sitting BIG pretty are those that bought a couple hundred shares before the last 2 for 1 split. They currently own 11,200 shares or about $1.5 million."
 goes  even on Friday !! Heading off to the Moon. See ya Shorts 
Apple needs to announce buybacks with that $14B in bonds like yesterday. At this point the stock price isn’t rising organically from operations. A huge beat does nothing to the stock price. Hope AAPL doesn’t become the next CSCO or even worse XOM.
Apple supplier TSMC is skyrocketing right now on an earnings beat. I called this a few days ago. What implications does this have for Apple? Take one guess. Apple long! Own it don't trade it.
"Too many shares available, co should be buying to stop some of the big traders from pushing the price, making aapl a trading stock. Its happened to many good co's."
Un American act by Apple should’ve picked an American company to partner with.
"pain will slow at lunch time, hedge funds selling to cover short positions"
Positive day today and a great short covering
"Earnings ""Blackout"" window during earnings reporting.It seems there is no SEC restriction but a company imposed one. Most companies impose a ten day window before and two day window after restricting stock buybacks. However, If a company has a established program there is no restrictions what so ever."
here for the long haul. $200 by end of year
AAPL is a buy and hold stock. If you like trading frequently put 20% in AAPL and stop looking at it and leave the rest for trading.
"Trend of three!Last two days, Rally at open, dip then closes in green"
"AAPL $200 by jan 1, 2022. Earnings report will be a $20 pop"

"The coming massive tax increases on corporations individuals and investors is not good for Apple. They can be the greatest company in the world, and perhaps they are, but when the government starts siphoning off so much of your money it’s a strong headwind."
all Apple does
Earnings coming... Buy before the 52 week high comes everyone
"It is announced today that Apple’s hardware engineering chief will step down to oversee a “NEW PROJECT”, he will report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Bringing his successful formula from the iPhone and iPad to a NEW APPLE PROJECT is a good thing."
"“Apple’s key differentiator is their integrated self-driving system, developed over 14 years, in its own software, sensor hardware and chip technologies. The goal lets a user input their destination and be driven there with little or no other engagement, according to engineers familiar with the project."""
Anyone know what app subscription is best for looking at level 2 trades and real time info ?
Bad luck for AAPL investors ! Great earnings news on a down day in the market! Should be up 5% in after hours! Just keep the faith and AAPL will be fine!
yo ladies and gentlemen both Google and Amazon up big in them premarket. Goody good for my beloved Apple and yes siri bob for the whole market. Thanko
"the old adage was diversification on wall street. all you need is one winning small cap like Tesla and your lifestyle has changed forever, after investing 1 year in it. Tesla has made amateur investors smarter than professionals, with the obvious wealth it created to the masses. Tesla up 11 days in a row, up another 40 points pre market. a broken slot machine that pays off every day. elon musk now over 210 billion dollars. Hyundai up 19 % today on the apple announcement. what is apple up. sell all apple and buy Tesla at any price. going to 2500 in 3 years or less, 12500 pre split."

"Today, we celebrate! "
"Kia would only *manufacture* the car to Apple specs—a car *designed* by Apple. In comparison, the Korean motor in my Chevy Bolt EV is very well designed, and body assembled to a very high standard (much higher than Tesla’s); Apple’s would be comparable, just better operating system than ALL competitors"
Kia ? Hyundai? Really ? For anyone with a car hobby like me I can’t think of a worse choice to not add value and respect to the prestigious Apple brand.
A mashed earning caused a drop but iCar boosted up the stock price. I love it!!! Stay strong!!!
Apple is against free speech parlor you pay the price along with the whole text sector Apple Facebook Twitter Google check out the prices today
stock is down because of the giant options position at 135 expiring today

Where’s apples upgrades
Same old. Same old. Crashes into close.
This is going up !! They made 1.8B in sales in holidays just from APP STORE!!
I get it... this is just because AAPL reported exceptionally good earnings!! Crazy market ... over 10$ down from before the earnings :(
Well Done Apple ! Well Done on record earnings! Stock will be $160 by end of next week!
"Take the opportunity to buy more semiconductors today as well. There is a severe shortage of chips/semiconductors in the world according to an article in a Chinese daily a short while back that’s because its expanded use in computers, robots, autos, I-phones , graphics, simulations , artificial intelligence, Cloud Computing and Hallographic technology etc etc etc"
Just wait until all the upgraded price targets for AAPL come in after that earnings beat! The share price will jump up after every new price upgrade that comes in!
love apple - for the long run
No matter what - AAPL is going to ring above $150 - and there is nothing U can do about it.
"this stock will be red today, guaranteed. I'm telling you all Apple is no longer a desired stock. Too many shares outstanding."
"dang it!!. i wanted to buy after hours under 137, any way I bought at 137.38. This is classic manipulation of smart money with market makers. They will stop out all retailers, so they can cover in premarket. The force of retailers will wipe out institution like gamestop. I hear 150 in pre market. I know their intentions.. buy load up with both hand. There is no way price can be before earnings despite tsunami earnings. Gut feeling tell me a BIG SHORT SQUEEZE Is coming to AAPL"
"I have 250k I made from GME that I cashed out EOD... should’ve held since it’s up 50% AH but oh well... thinking of putting it all into Apple and using my 1200 shares to buy COvered Calls with them and live off the premiums, what do you guys think ?"
"So, Apple goes down with blowout earnings across the board but Game stop rockets higher for absolutely no reason whatsoever."
"Market needs hope and hype both...Tesla, other EVs, Roku- you name it. These companies feed market with both. They are engaged and rewarding for shareholders. In the name of secrecy, Apple is not engaging with market. They shut down Hyundai and always tight lipped, why? Times changed and lots of things changed from 10-15 years ago. May be they need to change that strategy now. It’s time, high time."
Unloading half my position. Hate giving back and this market looks ready to do just that.
Futures up I think this is a good day for AAPL
"Apple, own it don’t trade it."
"Why does APPL need need to getin to a new businesses which is ahighly competitive, and challenging enterprise and compete with the likes of Toyota, GM, Ford,Tesla and a hundred others when they can concentrate on audio/video, drivability controls and drivetrain management systems and have all the other manufacturers as customers and not competitors?Computers, communications, ITis APPL domain and they should stick to it instead of venturing of in to new frontiers with new partners."
"sooner or later it will recover with better gains, nothing to worty about on a company with that strong fundamentals"
"People, take the time and skim through the Apple Bond prospectus, and you will see that the iCar is embedded and camouflaged deep inside behind their wordings!"

LiftOff tomorrow ? What say you ?
Wow. Nice start with pre .

"Last night ( Jan 28th California time ) I was showing my wife how to trade after hours on here brokerage account. As we were placing our order i noticed a 7,736,716 share @ $137.09 and I asked myself was that a hedge fund buying or selling ? Keep in mind that was a billion dollar transaction. After seeing what Aapl price did today, I am certain it was a buy."
"As I recall, AAPL had a great report last quarter beating all estimates and yet the stock sold off by 8 -10% the next day. Curious about thoughts for the upcoming report and the market reaction. I am holding 2500shares for the long haul, but also have Feb calls ranging from 125 to 145. Would appreciate your thoughts."
"Can't hold because of profit takers. People just don't get it, I guess more shorts own this than longs?? Never was like that. I'm selling when Warren Buffet sells."
"Besides today is the last day of the month that people's cashing out, these shorts are trying to recuperate some of their losses of the billions lost to GME and AMC. You sell, you loose. There's no reason AAPL should be in the red today and yesterday."
every one should buy Amazon and Google today before earnings. expect tremendous upside. like taking candy from a baby.
Carter on options action said Apple has a triple top now. Retested 138 three times and now broke above it. Very bullish. He sees it hitting 150 in earnings.
"they are killing options and hedge funds selling to cover losses on short positions,we will wait. stop selling......................."
Back to the $140s. Just be patient
"It appears as though IBM and Intel are in Wall Street's doghouse so maybe those dumping investors will take a longer look at Apple. One can only hope.Intel looks to be on a slippery slope if they have to compete with TSMC and AMD. Intel's new CEO is making some bold claims about turning things around but that won't come overnight. Intel has been falling out of favor for a few years with their inability to fab at smaller chip nodes. Intel isn't going out of business but is no longer on the cutting edge of fabrication. Having to ask TSMC for chip fab help doesn't bode well for Intel.Intel's new CEO doesn't want some rookie company like Apple showing them up in chip design, so the fight is on. Talk is cheap. Apple has been designing ARM chips for a decade, so Apple is up to the task. When Apple's base M1 CPU is giving an i9 fits, I think Intel is going to have to go back to the drawing board."
"The grift has ended with 74,223,744 marks."

The investment in the Kia plant is a major redesign based on Apple specs. Apple is now a player in the monster EV marketplace.
"Up next week, mark my words...."

Let’s say apple knocks it out of the park on earnings. How much is already baked into the price?
"This monster is the biggest cash cow I've ever seen. There's no stopping AAPL at this point, its just too massive and Tim Cook will drive this above and beyond everyones expectations."
 if you think the stock will explode after earnings.  if you think it will drop

APPL always trades lower after earnings. Nothing new. TSLA as well. They will both skyrocket.
Shouldn’t Kia news make apple go up today
"Newbie question... I bought AAPL @ $114 and own only 75 shares, normally after earning people will sell or hold?"
trading sideways the day before earnings is nothing to over analyze...
Futures point to a huge sell off on Monday. Sell at the bell and take your beating. Buy back in March for $80.00 per share. You will make back what you lost but just get out now. TSLA to $345.00 soon. But stay away from TSLA as well.
I bought today for 135.89 and sold for 137.25.
"I liken the growing E.V. sector to a bunch of small sharks—maybe a few medium-sized sharks like Tesla—feeding on a whale carcass. Then comes along “Deep Blue,” the mega great white, or Apple, and all the other sharks know feeding time is over and leave."
"AAPL will gap at the open $1 to $2. AAPL had pulled back $2 from Friday's intra day high to set today up. AAPL has printed $134+ twice as intra day highs and $133+ as intra day lows.

Kia news is big! Apple car picking up steam
"Started closing some long positions on other stocks. Not AAPL, yet. But, we WILL have a significant pullback in equities PRETTY SOON, I'd say."

Apple has over 1 billion users of their products on the planet. These are individuals who want the best products and are willing to pay a premium to have them. If they get 1/4% of those current Apple customers to buy their cars that is 2.5 million cars per year alone.
Went to the mall and all stores were empty with the exception of the Apple Store.
Look at Microsoft. Up $15 after hours yesterday. Shows you what down markets can do to a phenomenal earnings report
Seems like 150 at tortoise close before earnings :)
"All the bank stocks hitting high even in zero interest environment...industrials, cyclicals, materials, anything you name it- at 52 weeks high. Only big tech is sitting out as funds are rotating out of big tech. It’s frustrating to see daily decline on Green Day’s which is why we vent out. But we all know the big tech will have an average 30-40% yearly return in 5-10 years. The issue is most of us are short term investors. Hopefully, we see some strong buying next week during the shortened trading week and get ready for blowout earnings. $aapl, $amzn, $fb, $google"
Hedge funds were/are selling AAPL/AMZN/MSFT etc to cover losses . Wait until they BUY backBUY all dips
AAPL hit all time high of $140.36 after hours. Next stop is $150.
My primary portfolio made $79K for the week. My Amazon & Apple shares woke up from their 5-months hibernation and started shouldering the load of my portfolio and gave my Tesla shares a chance to rest.
They’re trying to hold it down before earnings. They’re still trying to get your shares. Hold don’t sell!
"Apple's returns past 4 years:2 year return: 244%3 year return: 188%5 year return: %407%Every year we hear the same story. Apple is a dinosaur stock that's overpriced and won't move up much more. Yet every year, Apple proves the doubters wrong. Apple is in the midst of a super cycle. It will enter the EV market within the next few years and has yet to unveil its AI products. Its new M1 chip is said to be revolutionary and leaves its competitors in the dust. Its EV battery which its been working on since 2015 will be a major disruptor in the industry that Tesla will not even be able to compete with.With Apple, I've learned that you have to stay patient and stay long. Never mind the short term chatter. You will be handsomely rewarded for your patience."
Hedge sold AH to create panic then scoop them up on the morning. Weak hands always got played again and again. #HistoryRepeated
Before advice to short or Something elle look Tesla is doing the same as Apple
"I am a New trader , bought aapl at 144. Should I sell when it’s up and get back in when it gets low? Or just hold them and buy more when it dips? Sounds like a great company to hold long term? Appreciate your guidance"
Apple bought back 200 million shares in the quarter. Every 5 quarters+/- there is a billion less shares available. I hope Apple announces adding to the buyback! Once again their goal is cash neutral but with no time frame.
European stocks higher today which is usually a good sign too
How is it that airlines report record losses and they are up 5%. And Apple reports record numbers and it drops?
"That was a delicious dip. Keep panic selling newbies, I want desert."

Elon musk owns space X. Isn’t that the company that had a rocket explode yesterday? Yea I’ll pick Tim Cook over risky musk any day.
Investors need to start focusing on earnings. A little over 3 weeks away. Big upgrades coming.
"You can’t keep a great stock down—it was only a matter of time. If AAPL ‘has’ been under manipulative pressure for almost 5 months now, those manipulators have either lost control to retail investors, or relinquishing on purpose for the guaranteed capital gain to come"
this always happens... classic market manipulation at its finest..keeping price down to burn 135-140 calls expiring Friday
"Apple Car will be a 100% Apple product. Outsourcing the car to a third party manufacturer is a brilliant move and will save the company billions in capacity build out spending. More importantly, it will allow them to produce 100K cars in year one. How long did it take Tesla to meet the 100k mark? Years because they had to build out their capacity and spend a ton of capital doing it. Hyundai-Kia has a firmly established global car manufacturing infrastructure that will allow Apple to scale rapidly. In addition, Apple will likely be working with other manufacturers as well. This is no different than Apple outsourcing the iPhone to FoxCon. Iphone is an Apple product, not a FoxCon.Most importantly, if reports are true that the car will be fully autonomous upon release, then Apple will be ahead of its competitors. Tesla has been promising fully autonomous for years now, but has not delivered. Combine this with their purported monocell battery, and Apple Car will be years ahead of its competitors in its first year of operations. Apple brand loyalty is unmatched."
Do not be surprised if Apple opens down tomorrow and close positive at the end!
"Apple is a cash machine! You Don’t trade Apple. You invest in it! It will go up. Stay long & strong. $111.4 in rev. India the next China, Icar, Apple ev car breakthrough battery. All positive! Don’t miss out on these. Buy and hold!"

WEBUSH: THIS IS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. AAPL WILL BOUNCE BACK OVER 141 TOMORROW.
AAPL is the future of the EV industry.TSLA is the past
apple is being strong armed by the big hedge funds to bring the price down so they can steal our hard earned money and buy it back 10 or 20% cheaper hey look you know Apple is a two trillion dollar it just had a great earnings report so why would a person sell it other then if you really need the money to pay bills other wise or your a short but besides that there is no reason to give these big hedge fund your money this stock should be at about 160 to 180 a share these hedge fund need to be taught a lesson like the reddit community is doing to game stop
The options casino is responsible for today’s Red !
this is the end of apple. remember BlackBerry. Tesla will be the new leader in market cap this year.

"Analysts' up price targets seeing Apple at the forefront of digital transformation.. Best days ahead:Loup Ventures says Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) strong earnings report is evidence of the accelerating digital transformation in the fact that the revenue upside was driven by nearly one of the company's every product categories. Price target of $200.Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty maintains an Outperform rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and raises the price target from $152 to $164 after yesterday's FQ1 report.Huberty notes that the active device installed base (10% from 7% in last year's period) and customer loyalty is still above 90%.The broad-based revenue recovery in Greater China points to sustained higher engagement and market share gains, says Huberty.Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar (Overweight, $135 to $160) highlights the double-digit sales growth for all categories with the 17% Y/Y iPhone revenue boost indicating strong iPhone 12 demand. On the call, management mentioned that supplies remain tight for the iPhone Pro and Pro Max.Kumar notes that FQ1 gross margin came in well above expectations on the higher revenue and improved product mix, and Apple's margin forecast was largely flat for the current quarter.Evercore (Outperform, $160 to $163) says ""there is no need for Reddit mentions with a performance like this.""Analyst Amit Daryanani calls gross margins the ""sleeper upside.""The analyst thinks the lack of guidance for iPhone and Mac sales suggests material acceleration in those markets, offset by modest decelerations for Services and Wearables.Apple shares are down 2.4% pre-market to $138.64 in what is proving to be a notably volatile week for the Street.On the earnings call, Apple management said current quarter growth should accelerate on the year and follow typical seasonality on the quarter. The company said it expects Wearables deceleration in FQ2, coming down from those record holiday-driven sales.Background: Apple's FQ1 revenue hits all-time record as iPhone sales smash estimates"

Today’s email from apple. “Support black businesses with Apple Pay. “ Apple might as well be calling people racists with that one. As if they assume people don’t. Wth do you get off sending something like that? I’m done with you hacks.

"Guys, this is not finished. Has nothing to do with fundamentals.Hedge funds are desperate to raise cash to cover their loss making short bets, and AAPL is one of the stocks, if not the stock that is most owned by these funds. I would stay away from most high tech large caps for a while, especially the ones that have provided sizeable gains in 2020, which they can now sell showing a profit.Long - term I am very bullish on AAPL, but there will be better entry points. I am starting to think that we might go all the way to the 200 moving average line. Of course most of the other stocks will follow, but this one will suffer more because it's where cash can be raised faster, for the sheer size of their investments here."

AAPL Jan 22 $130 calls ran from .65 Tuesday at 1559 hrs to $10+ iintra day high closing at $9.05.Anyone reading these boards who played options should have had this play. I hope so.Let me explain this statement. WE, this community, agreed to no dips and letting AAPL run until after earnings. No, this is not a ""Ponzi scheme"" as someone posted.Where ever AAPL settles it could be $5, $10 or $15 higher from here, AAPL will be AAPL, trading in mini ""v's.It may never see this level again. Earnings play?Be here n 1/27...my lucky number 1027 was my police badge number until ...!"
"Apple is a liberal company and will always be. Apple alone has made me a millionaire and where I will always vote for conservatism over socialism, I plan to hold onto my shares. Apple disguises themselves as a liberal company, but we all know they are the most dominate capitalist company of all time. We also know that they market their products to people with money. They only have 15% of the cell phone market in the world, but 85% of the profits. Their market cap is 6% of the entire world economy. Wrap your head around those facts! Yes, I voted for Trump as he is pro business and capitalism and I had a 40% annual return over 4 years. I can guarantee we will never see a stock market run again like the last 4 years. However, I feel like Apple can continue to do 20% plus annually over the next few years with the 5G super cycle."

Don’t get upset longs. Our time will come. Apple  will probably jump $7 out of know where.
"Wow, a huge beat! $1.68 EPS, revenue of $111 billion, and net income of $28.7 billion. DURING A PANDEMIC, ladies and gentlemen! Every single reportable segment/ region was up with the Americas being the biggest as well as every single sales category with iPhone taking the lead. This should put an end to criticism that the company is not a growth play. Growth was everywhere compared to prior year's quarter (when there was not a pandemic yet). They also paid $30.5 billion in buybacks and dividends. I don't care that it's down after hours all I know is that Apple is a behemoth and that the future will be brighter than ever. I have even more reason to buy more shares now. This isn't a stock you trade. This is a stock you invest in and accumulate. Own it don't trade it."
I wish i have more cash to buy more shares
"4 years from now your going to look back and say, I remember when Apple announced they were coming out with a car. You will either say I’m glad I held my shares buying more along the way and dividend accumulations. Or Damm why did I sell? The choice is yours! See you when the car comes out. I’ll have at least 2500 shares or more.￼￼"

Consider the news on earnings is already built into the current price. An upside will depend on its future guidance.
"Apple and the big guys always had the way of taking out all the small investors before the earnings, and all the other stocks might be up and that changes the investors to put money else where. But when the earnings do come out, all the small investors come back to ride and thats where the stock skyrockets. Always been the case and always will be. buy your options on the 26th january for 29th january that has strike price above $1-2 of the stock. you will thank me later."

"The sobering reality: AAPL is a computer hardware manufacturer that derives 85% of revenues from phones, pads, and macbooks. Based on forward growth rates of 8-9%, it deserves about a 13 multiple. The stock is worth $56 right now."
"I think you need to realize that AAPL is now a blue chip stock. A good one, but not one that's price is going to jump up like crazy anymore. It's too big to do that now. It's up 3% since the beginning of the year and some of you on here are going nuts that it's not more. It's a great long term investment, not day traders dream anymore."
"Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty and team have a few thoughts on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) potential venture into the automobile industry.""A noticeable percentage of Apple revenue in any given year comes from products and services that didn’t exist 3 to 5 years ago. An important point when you start thinking about Car and Health and AR.""""Investors never credit Apple with the revenue coming on the back of $20bn+ of annual R&D investments… including investing in new areas like autos.""""Apple has a user base of about 1 billion installed iPhones, last reported to be growing at around 9% annually. So when Apple users buy multiple products (iPhone + Airpods + watch + Mac) the churn essentially goes to zero. This is very relevant when we talk about entering new categories like Car.""Huberty also notes that Apple would only have to nab 2% auto mobility market share to match its iPhone revenue.She also thinks Apple is more likely to vertically integrate in auto due to its existing tech (operating system, processors, battery, cameras and displays), instead of striking partnerships.What about margins? Huberty says Apple would only make a move if it could generate double-digit margins at scale with long-term upside. As for timing, an Apple Car isn't anticipated for four or five years.On risk to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Huberty thinks the pair could grow the market together and doesn't expect a Blackberry-type flameout when Apple enters the market.Apple Car developments and potential auto-tech partnerships are expected to be a big theme in 2021."

I think today's stock action after historic earnings is a sign of things to come. I don't think this is due to Gamestop and other shorted stocks. AAPL is the most widely held stock and this trading action is very concerning.
"I kinda love this kind of trend - slow, steady and up !! Unlike the craggy zig zag from Tesla RIOT GME"
All time high ending into ER. Delicioso amigos. Roll on $150 
$145 was the historical all-time top of the mountain for AAPL. The process of going down the other side of the mountain will be painful for those who refuse to let go. Selling commoditized cellphones will not take the company through $145 and higher. Analyst hot air pumps are getting less effective at moving the stock. Release the bag. Good luck.

"Big money can apply downward pressure to AAPL at will. They do it on any given Friday for OpEx profit. When they do it on no news days like today, it’s to accumulate for major event—ER"
I would hope to see 150-160 after earnings!
"People who say that Apple is a ""safe investment"" are completely wrong. Their P/E ratio is 40+ and price to book ratio is around 36. They operate in a highly competitive industry and their products are prices well above competition. In most places, an apple gadget is considered a luxury good because there are many cheaper alternatives available. Safe investments are money market instruments."
The big funds always need AAPL .. so why sell to them cheap?
Tim Cook came out to say the growth will not be alot for services and wearables.. I think he just wanted to make Apple drop for the time being. Always for a stellar earnings Apple wants to buy back shares.. and always does at the cheap.. like after citron report release 
"Hang Seng was up 900+, what's up with that?"
"$150 coming folks!! Adding to my position, holding for the next 10 years!!!"
The last few months the market has been looking to sell APPL versus buy. Frustrating
"So Tim Cook will make an ""exciting"" announcement tomorrow which is not a product. I'd hate to kill the hype that all of you are anitcipating, but I don't think it's Project Titan. It could be confirmation of the record setting App Store sales this past holiday, or the new stores they've opened up in other countries."
I bought more at 132.14 what a good deal. Every 0.40 cent I am buying accumulating...AAPL is cheap. Solid earnings is truth regardless what happen in the world. AAPL bullet proof .
Going higher ! Get on the rocket! $160 by March !
AllMajor analysts have AppleAt $150-$175 /share range
"Apple won't keep up with $nok this year, do yourself a favor and adjust 401k's and purchases accordingly."
"The stock price fall from 145 to 132 had little to do with the company's fundamentals or earnings. They had the best earnings quarter in company history. The steep fall from 145 to 132 was directly related to the GameStop trades. The big boys had to cover their short positions in the meme stocks and decided Apple was the lowest hanging fruit to raise funds to cover those positions. As such, they sold Apple reluctantly. In a normal market, Apple's earnings should have taken the stock to low 150's. So if the market stabilizes this week, I look for a big jump in Apple price. Apple looks very underpriced relative to its peers and earnings and hopefully will make a quick recovery to reflect its stellar past quarter."
"If I sell my Appl tomorrow, will I still receive my dividends?"
Raised price targets as earnings nears.  $150.00+
Does anyone know why the market dropped soSuddenly late this morning? I didn’t really hear anything on the news
Stimulus $$ = iPhone upgrades!!
Huge Sell Off next week and in coming days Aapl 100$ after earning
Market is completely mixed up....ahem GameStop and AMC. This will probably be the best ER from any company this quarter and yet look how we get nothing in return. Its truly sad what the market has turned into. Still long no matter what... this company is leading tech.
"buy the dip 132-133There is 205,000 calls at 135 strike price, these will not pay out.Casino wants them to be 0"
Why is Tesla going up when Apple had a blow out quarter? Simple.Tesla has 947.8 million shares outstandingApple has 16.79 billion shares outstanding
"Longs get gets 2 scoops of ice cream, everyone else gets 1."
Buybacks. Apple is the greatest company
"Google is up over 6 percent after earnings. While AAPL smashed records up down left right last week. The whole GME and AMC fiasco overshadowed our chance to see Apple going over at least $150 a share. I feel we are so short changed. If AAPL announce their earnings today, it will be a different story."
The P/E argument?After earnings the pros on CNBC said they could not find one thing wrong with the earnings report except with the Forward P/E at 32 that was rich for AAPL.WE made that argument in Jan 20 and earlier this year also after it first ran to $138.BUt the P?E will fall with great earnings and stock buybacks. But this takes time.Last night the Jan 22 $135 calls closed at $22 to $24 . Shareholders if they need cash may want to sell a covered call for Jan 22. THis puts tax deferred cash in your pockets until you close out the trade or the stock is taken from you. Your stock giveaway would be the strike price + premium of sold call. For example $135 + $24 = $159
"Apple will do pretty well on earnings but it appears Netflix is going to put Apple to shame in share price gains despite all the streaming content competition. That's pretty impressive. I don't know why Apple can't load up on video content for their AppleTV+ service. Apple has over a billion active devices on iPhones, iPads, desktops and laptops to serve content to. I keep hearing people say Apple's streaming content is rather thin. Apple can't just grow subscribers with original content because that's too expensive. Apple needs some classic content to fatten up its library. I still watch X-Files, Magnum P.I., The Rockford Files, etc. Good shows are always watchable even if they're decades old. How can Apple compete with Netflix for new subscribers if there isn't much content to watch. So Netflix shareholders will likely see 15% to 20% gains in share price on earnings. That's where the big money is going and it's perfectly understandable Apple may be ignored. Netflix is much easier to move than Apple is.I think Apple needs to double-down on streaming content to pull more subscribers. That seems like a no-brainer to me. Will Apple get even 8% share price gains on earnings? I sure hope so."
"As expected, the push in the last stretch of AH swallowed the 145 resistance level! Sleep well fellow true believers you deserve it as we'll look forward to some serious scorching tomorrow! Peace!"
India‘a extraordinarily strong results point to a total blow out quarter . I would not be surprised to see this at $160+ before Friday close .
$150 next
140 tomorrow!!!
Having cash on the sidelines is nice. I think tomorrow things will change. People will load up and back over $140 this week
"Today is a Chess game.Noting more; nothing less.After open, if and only if the right moves are made, everyone can do very well.What are those moves?Think about it"
"I think to my knowledge buying back share would be better then dividend, beacuse the less share the higher stock price. Although i like the dividend, but rather buying back share bc we have 17 billion plus share. Any honest thought would be Appreciated."
This weekly Friday “manip-dip” is the best day to buy into AAPL
Margan Stanely Up grades AAPL $152: AAPL positive earnings play with positive Price Target Upgrades supported by Apple's ramped up productions. Good Luck.
Do you think earning are priced in after yesterday's drop? Or is this running tomorrow?
I was surprised to see this down again today especially inlight of their supplier SWKS results last night. Market is impossible to predict as logic never seems to prevail but like they said earlier on CNBC the analysts all raised targets ahead of earnings instead of waiting for results which drove it up ahead of the release. This won’t stay down long however. 111 bil revenues? Unheard of!
"Just bought some, long term I hope this works out"
AAPL is poised to gap-up on Monday above 150 buy in advance. Smart money knows that...pretending goind down buy AAPL will hit new high...140 at least breakout
cup and handle formation here to rocket to 160!
"Thats weird i told you guys 3 hours ago this would hit 130. It all good, they cant hold the most valuable company in the U.S. down. This take a while to recover from...we know this. hold and relax."
AAPL - Slow-moving stock. Check STMP.
And the Oinker goes down some more in AH. Could this stock stink up the room or what?!
"Call option volume for this week on $137 all the way up to $145 is huge with the $140 calls having the most volume, does this mean close at $140 on Thursday?"
Market is crashing today! I hope strong recovery tomorrow will help Apple earnings announcement.
Weren’t Apple’s earnings better than Tesla’s? Who is still pumping Tesla? I want them to STOP.
"Blowout quarter and NOTHING for the shareholders but decreased value. Nothing criminal here, keep it moving"
This looks like a nice buying opportunity
"If Trump TV launched as an IPO (media, website, etc.) would you invest?"
If earnings for last quarter will be 100 Billion dollars then AAPL will cross $200 very very quickly.
"Open today around $138, drift to $137, close $139. Friday will be $141."
Why this is happening? There is no bad news today and the whole market dropped. People are selling because they are just blinded by the tricks streets uses all the time. Can someone please tell me why anyone would sell AAPL now knowing the earnings is coming within 2 weeks.
"The selloff is manipulated, guys. Hold it and buy the dip!"
"Apple will invest 4 trillion won to secure access to Kia's U.S. facilities in Georgia. The companies are eyeing a production run in 2024 with an initial capacity of 100,000 cars per year, though the plant can ramp up to a maximum of 400,000 units a year, the report says."
"I have wondered why Apple even bothered to split its stock the last time. We haven't seen any appreciable gains since the split that I've noticed. I'm not certain but Apple seems as volatile now as before the split. The split just left Apple with more outstanding shares to keep buying back. Apple still isn't made up of a higher percentage of institutional owners as before the split. I'm not complaining as I've been through splits since 2004 so I have accumulated plenty of shares due to those splits. Are investors actually buying more shares at this price than if Apple's share price were 4X as much? I'm just trying to figure out if anything much changed since the four for one split. I honestly can't tell except for the fact I have more shares. Tesla's split worked very well as investors kept buying more stock, but it didn't work for Apple as investors, for the most part, stopped buying Apple after the split. So, I wonder if Apple got what it expected from the split, that's all. Do most of you long-term shareholders think the last split was worthwhile, so far? Maybe further down the line it may matter? I'm just curious."
The pandemic accelerated Apple’s business!
I should of shorted it early today would of made a few grand.
Yesterday they announced sales and profits up more then 20% vs 2019 but the price is 2.4 lower today? Why is that? The bubble is popping?
Got a good feeling longs will be treated tomorrow!
OUCH STOP THE BLEEDING ALREADY. ENOUGH.
They earn more $$ than any company in the history of planet Earth. I never quite get the Apple bashing? Buy and hold seems a wise strategy.
"The Apple car, one can only imagine the cockpit design and the Apple eco interface! "
Prediction... Not only will Apple car be the coolest car ever with a brand new battery tech that far outpaces Tesla... I bet Apple also is very competitive in its pricing of the car too!
Just another opportunity to buy while you can.
Imagine selling lmaoo
"Looks like Apple getting a bump from MFST crushing earnings. I'm not sure if there is a correlation, but if there is...this is going to be a good week."
Excited for blockbuster earnings today!!!!!!!!
Close over $137
Long and strong!
We started out the week at 132/share and ended at 136. That's a good week.
Apple goes through periods where the market appears toHate it and is unloved. And sort of just consolidates in a range before it rockets higher. I think we are now in that period sinceWe moved from the previous consolidation around 116 to the new high 145. We are consolidating now in the 130-135 range
"Why is this down ., while the whole stock market is up ? I swear my luck and my options trading whatever I do goes south"
The people saying “be patient & buy the dip” are very delusional.... liquidity problems and hedge funds are selling tech stocks to cover their losses trying to short meme stocks! They bought at March/2020 lows and already selling so they don’t go bankrupt! This can easily crash the market! Plus we now have manipulation problems where Brokeages are not letting you buy 30-40 limiting to 1 share per account and only to sell! We could see a huge gap down starting! Trade wisely!
MARKET SELLOFF
could of sold last night at 138. no one has confidence in apple anymore.
IBM cometh out with great results. Just cometh out.
"$NOK is the future and the future of 5G, installing satellites on the moon through NASA. You can thank me later, cheers."
"Am I missing something here this kind of move parabolic before earning. If it continues like this, this could be over 200 by 2.15.2021. I say that to say people are usually cautious before earnings so who is buying this like this??? Don't get me wrong I am long and I am not complaining."
What is happening to the market
So market makers will drag apple down today and tomorrow so calls don’t end in the money then make it moon Monday absolutely awful
glad I sold at 135. looks like the market is gunna take a big drop
Apple reported great numbers but unfortunately the market rewards poor performance these days. Look at AAL.
I don't mind holding my 170 shares.. I'm only sweating for my 140 calls
Bought a January 29 170 call option. Feeling pretty optimistic this cracks 170 after earnings. Thoughts?
New all time high ! yessssssss !
Dow is down over 600 points just today. Its down over 1000 since Joe became pres. This is Joe's economy. We owe the downfall you the liberals. Good job.
cup and handle even stronger today....cup shows $154+
"Like many stocks APPL beats on all financial measures and falls the next day. Here's why: There is no such thing as free money by figuring out the stock market. The algorithms know this and the AI understands human thought and reason,,,,,,,so Amateur investors took a position in APPLE ""knowing"" they were going to beat the earnings estimates. The stock would pop and they could cash in. So........the computers simply said let's take it down, they are amateurs and will sell at a loss. That's how the game works. Not just with Apple but many other stocks."
"I’m holding my apple close, and my enemies closer."
To be able to wait long time and have patience for what ever is coming down in the short term is GOLD. Next stop $160!!
Load up
I will not be selling my shares . Hang in for another day - like tomorrow maybe .
450 shares of aapl and loving the ride up
Apple reportedly in talks with multiple Japanese automakers over 'Apple Car'https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/05/apple-reportedly-in-talks-with-multiple-japanese-automakers-over-apple-car
Better hope this exceeds ER on Wednesday. Analyst hype is driving up the price and any hint of weakness will crush it.
#bngo #gme #amc #tsla #aaplBngo going up. Lets goooo 
"Lesson of the the day...if you're a public traded company, don't make more money in three months than most countries make in a year because the street will punish you for that."
I sincerely hope GameStop stock falls back down hard to nothing and wipe out ALL of the gains for those bleeping GME traders. It is because of them that Apple stock has taken a tumble like this...!
"folks go it long and don't fallit for those short folks. relax and be happy. I thinkit Amazon and Google cometh with great results and them Dow, them NASDAQ and them S&P will rocket to the ask. Have it faith. Thanko"
wow! What a day for apple!!
Apple’s “1984” Super Bowl commercial for the Macintosh 128K will be surpassed by the “2021” commercial for the iCar.
I got 6 shares at 135 last week lol
Buying interest in Apple is now 92% in the pre market session 
Big rebound expected for Monday morning.
Microsoft up big after hours. Apple is getting a lift from it. Tomorrow should be an excellent day
Hit $150 after earnings we will.
Apple autonomous car is on its way! .....it’s so awesome!....Project Titan been in the works since 2014 kept secret by Apple until the media finally was able to expose what’s going on
Alright people what made this tank after hours?.
"No need to panic, let the shorts leave and we will pick up the money end of today/tomorrow"
AAPL is going over 160 on ER. GUARANTEED.
Have a nice day
Finally ! People are waking up pre market
Is it possible that WS is selling great stocks to cover GME positions?
"Remember when it went from 126 to 145 in 5 days, its going to do it again, from 135 to 155. Its coming soon to a theatre near u!"
Glorious Wednesday “ AAPL to hit 155 today Like if you agree
7 out of the first 10 post are about politics. It’s getting old. It’s over. This is about aapl.
Futures slightly down but don’t worry that always happens in premarket Sunday after a down day on Friday. I honestly believe Dow will be up over 4000 points next week and S&P and Nasdaq will do even better percentage wise. This is my years and years of experience talking
The earning can’t be better than ever. 2t valuation company growing 20% YOY. What else do you want?
Apple now discussions with 6 Japanese automakers about building Apple Car. Maybe Toyota and Apple create separate subsidiary joint venture......basically start their own iCar company together....how great would tgst be!
"Only six business days until earnings, so maybe Apple wii rise into earnings. I wouldn't go by today because almost all stocks were up and Apple wasn't up as much as some other tech stocks. Not that it matters. Apple will continue to rise. I have no doubts the holiday quarter will be strong but don't look for a Netflix type of share gain because Netflix's market cap is around $300B which is nowhere close to Apple's $2.2T market cap. Apple practically buys back Netflix's market cap in shares every six months. I keep thinking about what sort of acquisitions Apple could be making with all that money being used for buybacks. Apple could own all the American car companies by now. I'm just saying if Apple wants to get into the auto business, money wouldn't be an obstacle. I know it's not that simple but it sounds rather interesting because of the EV craze in the market.Anyway, the next couple of weeks should be exciting if Apple had done really well for the holiday quarter but I'm always wary about Wall Street's expectations of Apple. I'm hoping for decent results and good guidance for the next quarter which investors will appreciate."
The ecosystem Apple is going to create is going to be nuts what’s next Apple houses?
"Apple's market share is going to explode in the next decade and new products will only feed the growth. Remember, post 2020 a trillion ain't what it used to be!Never, ever argue with success."
All the bubble stocks are getting killed. The money from them will flow to safer stocks like AAPL. Been long and strong since 2011. AAPL doesn’t disappoint long term INVESTORS.
Have a nice day and weekend
Greatest earnings beat of all time BOAT and it may plummet to double digits...
"Apple wants a car with the Apple name on it. They want it to be revolutionary. Apple will NOT buy GM, F or any other manufacturer due to the inherent problems with debt, unions, etc. Apple will partner, as they often do, with manufacturers who can meet Apple's stringent demands. Apple is agile and global in every thing they do."
get ready to see apple report it's first $100 billion quarter in history
BELIEVE 
"Everyone panicking over intraday red, just be patient it’ll come back sooner or later. Nothing is forever remember that"
Bought 100 @ 130.24
"Once algorithim players are set AAPL should run, maybe $144 by Friday"
Got to think the mms tanked the market on purpose to teach the retailers a lesson for what they did to the shorties. The mms have all the ammo and control the algos retailers will not win this fight
Count 45 seconds and this stock will bein the red all day.
Upgrade: Wedbush Dan Ives Upgrades AAPL to $175. Good Luck
"Guys, AH trades mean nothing. Volume is way too low. We will be big fat green end of week."
"Definition of Long-term Investment:""A sure-winner short-term bet gone sour.""(Longs her just realized that they've wasted six months of their life.)"
expected was 1.01 it changed to 1.41 why?
Bought some AAPL today. I think this will be $135 plus here pretty soon. Good luck all!
Typical hedge fund manipulation on expiration day...but no one says anything about this ..stock drops from 143 to 130 on the great earnings ever and 196 billion in cash...
Everyone should just relax and enjoy the dip. You know that long term Apple is the winner.
I thing the whole GME thing will teach short sellers a lesson. This will be good for true investors.
We’ll see AAPL surge above140 all the sudden!Happy New Year ️️️️ 
all futures up including nasdaq. All other tech stocks are booming today whilst apple cant move 1%
Options.....Lots of outstanding calls with expiration dates over the next few weeks. I briefly glanced at it yesterday. Many more calls than puts in the $140 to $150 price range. They probably will let them expire before anything significant happens. The earnings release the other day was EXCELLENT and the price goes down? Hedge funds also probably helping keep it down by hammering the bid.
"New all time highs after earnings. iPhone 12 has been selling at record numbers and the services follow iphones sales. Redesign, 5G and stay at home pandemic have caused sales to surge."
$153 after earnings.
To anyone out there is your interactive broker account working right now. Mine is not
I am thinking sell right before earnings hopefully near the $150 mark. At that much the good news is already baked in.
so manipulated by the institution and shorts. teach em a lesson and do that short squeeze on this AAPL buy and hold
What’s going on AH’s? Wow
haircut has now reached 8% i guess shorties want it down 10% around 130 it will bounce hard after today shorties had their fun time to get out
SEC rules prevent AAPL from buying back stock for so many days after earnings. This may be the reason for this assault?
142 to 137 after hours–on a 111.4 BILLION BEAT?!! This is criminal.I'm selling all my shares of AAPL and buying GameStop in the morning. (insane).
How much stock is Appl buying back every year?
"If AAPL earnings come through next week...that'll ignite the breakout...if so, a powerful next leg up. Good Luck"
AH because of MSFT earnings I presume?
Gotta love it. Big guys cry about the Reddit army then you see APPLE have a blow out earnings and it’s down 2%. Wonder why lol
"Great trading stock in the last few months. As long term investment not really. From the stock split 5 months ago goes slow, I really don't know who is happy with this. I bought on 127 two weeks ago and sold on 143, 10 days later. Same today, will buy on 130-131 and sell on 150 in 2-3 weeks. Easy money. Just patience."
cmon apple
$AAPL and Hyundai/Kia working on Apple Car...LG (another Korean company) manufactures batteries for Tesla....Looks like the Tesla bubble will burst sooner rather than later.
"David Jagielski dated February 2, 2021 in Motley’s Fool “New Investor in 2021? Here are 3 stocks to build your portfolio around :J&J, Apple, Comcast “."
I feel for all those robinhood investors who bought in soooo high on game stop their gonna lose their #$%$
Typical Apple investor waiting for his ROI...
"Lets do the math, Citadel alone say they lost 70 billion already on contracts originally worth in the sub billion. That kind of load, coupled with a bit of sell-the-news, and many brokerages stopping trading on US stocks due to volatility, I can see why the market is down. Tesla 5D is identical to AAPL."
"Will sell my Apple shares at a loss on Monday, I don't care will still sell!!!"
150 tomorrow who agrees
"So Apple has a blowout massive quarter and is down but But American Airlines is up,64% PM. That makes sense."
Tomorrow will see green. Investors Can’t pass up the $111.4 rev! Up we go!
Just realized there’s a cap on how many stocks you can buy at any given point. So if 7b are going to be used on buybacks it’ll grow by $2-$3 every day for 2 weeks!
"Apple car, 5G leader and super growth in China should see Apple at $200 ps soon."
"There are people writing a story about the poor hedge funds and how their margin calls are our problem on this feed ! Block out that noice, buy apple, hold apple and profit from Apple A hedge funds reckless bets are not our problem! Morally or financially! The market will deal with them !"
Looks like the weak stomached Apple share holders decided to sell & jump ship today. These people may make a couple of bucks in the short term BUT they will never get rich. To become a truly rich Apple millionaire you have to have a strong stomach & a willingness to hold your Apple shares for the long-term. You can't be jumping in & out of the market and sell your Apple shares every time your shares go up a little bit...
I’ll buy at 100 it’s price in 7 days after the coming crash

"AAPL is the best growth stock around.. However, everyone forgets about AAPL's dividend: $.82/ share. Yeah its low but expected to grow close to 10% / year for next 3-5 years st a minimum. In early 2014, if you had only 1000 shares, today you would have 28000. In 10 years the dividend on that money will be returning $2-3/share or $56,000+/ year. Not too bad for the greatest growth stock around. Buy and hold forever and live off the dividends"
"Let the politics go and concentrate on your investment in AAPL. People are addicted to apple products and the addiction is spreading. Buy an iPhone and you'll think about an iPad, apple watch and every other Apple product that's seamlessly compatible. Apple may be the most creative company on the planet and you, the shareholder, own a part of it. The COVID recession proved once and for all that people will not forgo technology. It also demonstrated much of our economy can function remotely which increases the demand for seamless work products. Every doctor I know uses an iPad and it's the dominant platform found in most hospitals. Apple stuff works so enjoy your shares and keep politics off this forum."
appl if you pass 141 i will have enough money to drop out of college at 18. hopefully you will smash 150 and i wont have to work a day in my life.. i got my full portfolio on earnings calls. bought 141 strike calls at 136.80

"I haven't been interested in Apple for a long time because I dislike the changes that have been made over the years. I've been a Mac user since the early 80s, and I think they have become the anti-thesis of their original mission. However, I am pleased they took a stand to protect our country from insurrection. I won't get into political battles here. I just want to say that I think Apple made the best move for the nation, and I am buying contrary to this backlash because I believe the price will rise."
A lose retailer that sells videos games and hardly makes any profit now has a valuation of $24 Billion. ROFL!
I'm still accumulating. Let these mutual funds and traders drive the price higher. What's coming in the next 10 years pales in comparison to today's performance. Own it don't trade it.
Cramer has some influence on traders that watch his show but you think warren buffet listens? NO!
Huwawei sell much less smartphones. That is good news for Apple.

"Man, I was thinking about selling after 50k out of my 500k of Apple RSUs just vested. But I think I’ll wait a bit more after this Apple Car news"
Wow... Utterly disheartening... Speechless.
that was awesome interview... the car henrik designed for $AAPL he is is going to manufacture with someone else soon
as warren always stays... you need to be greedy when others are panicking. and jimmy chill will tell you no one ever made a dime panicking. just be cool and watch it rally back to the 140s and retest the highs around 147. it will settle to a new ath in the 150s to split the new pt range 150-160.
i expect the markets to go crazy after the reddit stuff. FOMO and all the free money/low interest rates.retail investors can create their own hedge funds and pile into certain stocks.
expiration date on feb calls ; hedge funds at work no biggiecatch a few shares wont see prices like this after today!
"Guys Apple always saves the market. It did in 2018, 2019, and 2020, for the last three years, when everyone thinks the market was going to crush. And now, it will do it again. No need to worry. Apple is a long-term investment for sure."
"$BABA $AAPL $AMZN all going to $100,0099,9900 end of decade"
$400 coming soon. All the glowing reports I read about the market this weekend specially the technology sector reinforces that
Where they getting the batteries from?
"I am just curios, does anybody have an idea of how many shares Aapl owns because that is better than cash earning what 2 or 3%."
How bout a special dividend of $10 ???
Solid performance - Iphone sales - in India/China and all other metrics up. Ultimately good performance will be rewarded. The stock is a steal at the current price. Race to $200 by end of the year!!
Don’t worry ! FB CEO just said on earnings call that Appl their biggest competitor! I urge everyone on this board to read these comments! Apple controls the keys to advertising! Think about that ! Not just a hardware producer ! I expect a lot of FB investors to be buying Apple stock instead of FB !
The recovery in price is never as swift as a price reversal. It will take months to get back to 145 unless some kind of news leaks out
My estimates for earnings are: Sales 108 Bil - 115 Bil and EPS of 1.50 - 1.70 !!!
"Bets ar ein, 6 straight days of UP/GREEN, today will be sideways as the bettors wait the results after the bell."
Perhaps the investors that believe the market is open tomorrow should eventually consider moving their investment money into a managed target fund. Looking forward to Apple’s conference call on the 27th. The AirTags sound interesting; hope we get some info during the March event. Good luck & great investing!
AAPL at $145 by Friday.
"Who says money doesn't grow on trees? My Apple ""tree"" has generated a considerable amount of wealth for me since 2006 and it continues to do so. I also planted a Tesla tree in my yard in 2013 and that one started to bear alot of fruit last year as well...!"
So Apple went from $.82 a share to $.20? What a joke.
apple is a cash making machine
We’re not in a bubble?
Oh my God Netflix up 10% after hours. Beat all benchmarks. Very positive affect on the market in general and the technology sector in particular tomorrow
What the new Apple car willhave the option to do!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QAnIjwwzupI
Unless you need the cash hold long. And if you have cash to spare buy AAPL and also hold long.

"Give it up shorties, I know you are lurking around. Not tonight and Not tomorrow, this is a well deserved party to longs!"
Apple trading today hasn’t even exceeded average daily volume!
"Last thing I heard Apple management & BOD worked for the stockholders. Yet Tim Cook is quite free with our money for his political causes. $100,000,000 is Apples latest give-a-way & it comes out of our pockets. Sure Apple makes a lot of money and management already rewards themselves with hundreds of millions in stock bonuses. Yet they feel the company should donate to Tim Cook's political causes rather than have him donate his own money. Tim does an excellent job but he should EITHER get his bonus or use HIS bonus to donate to liberal causes IMO."
best sales in india and china. best quarter ever. 23 +% of worlds iphone share. only way but up.
MMS already working it hard to get price under $135 for opex.
"ALL 3 Indexes (DOW, NASDAQ, S & P) futures are up nicely ! Since Apple is included in all 3, it could be Apple having significant influence on all 3. I think it is likely. Stepping up buybacks, in all likely increasing dividends and the large institutions that had to cover their Reddit facilitated ""Short Attack' by selling some Apple positions should be returning very soon. Maybe as soon as, beginning tommorow. I am very bullish on Apple right now.  Apple Long & Strong  !"
"On earnings day, AAPL could be 145$ (or more!) per share! Morgan Stanley target price is 152$."
maybe amzn and alphabet earnings will give aapl the freen light for the 150 sp... next hours will be interesting
"Congress is now saying that the stimulus check for $1,400 should be coming in March 2021. Fuel up the engines we are going to the outer limits of the solar system"
"For those that are new to Apple, it always drops after earnings if it has a run up before it. Doesn't matter if it is good earnings or NASDAQ is up 5%. Apple is not a trading stock, its kind of like an old IBM stock. Stable so it doesn't move much, depressing sometimes but it will deliver. I consider it as my ""bonds"" position since I don't have invest in real bonds. Buy EVs if you want action and if you want more action, try reddit stocks, haha."
Patience you must have if you want to ride to 200.
This is pretty close to pre-split price. Don’t think it will go down much lower. Apple usually goes up for dividend payout. Should go up next week
Correction isn’t here yet it’s just a pull back
Tomorrow it will be trading high!
"Don’t sell after hours. Tesla, Facebook and Apple will ride in the next few days."
The Market is really enjoying Obama’s Legacy coming full circle ️ Your Welcome  The chosen one.
"I've been reading the board w/o commenting,But I want to echo what was posted last WEekend.WE posted that the traders had the filed for a month while the investors waited for their turn which WE said was this week until after earnings.Today I read many discussing options. Since Tuesday's open the weekly calls are up as much as 1000%. The $130 calls were .65 on Tuesday morning..today they are over approx. $7. Some returns were so much higher.Then the sale of puts was a slam dunk.Tomorrow for our UNITY to stand fast there will be no pullback."
"guys were in the middle of a market correction an retailers/short sellers at war with each other, what do you expect, give things a chance appl not going anywhere with 2.3 trillion market cap trust me"
I predicted 135 Friday 145 by Wednesday then earnings push another 15-20 looking at 160-170
"Here is a reality check for those thinking this stock will go to 200 and a 3.5 trillion value on roughly 300 billion in sales and a 20% net margin, 60 billion net income and 17 billion shares, EPS of 3.53. PE of 57 with a growth rate of 15%. Take a look at the last 4 years of sales. For this to make any sense, how are they going to double sales? No one at the company is talking like that. Cars....yeah....well the margin isn't going to stay at 20%. Tesla car margin is close to zero. Some think business is so easy....just say you are goign to make electric cars and in a few years 300 billion in sales? Come on. Even at 75K a car ASSUMING THEY OWN THE ENTIRE SHARE OF REVENUE....that is 4 million cars. Tesla sold 500K last year. THIS IS A BUBBLE!!!!"
AAPL will report record profits.The stock will tank.That is the world we now live in.It isn't a redit fave so it will tank.
"Just talked to Mr Sidwell at Goldman Sachs. He said they have put huge buy orders for AAPL in the morning from the money they made at AMC. This is how they make their portfolio less volatile. Also, he said that there are no signs of a correction this is just a regular day at the end of Jan. They are re-investing their profits from AMC into Apple and Starbucks in the % ratio of 70 and 30 each. So, congratulations to those who held on today."
"I'll never understand this is a cash cow, all it does is make moneywhy sell???"
MasterCard is up almost $11 and they reported $1.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Apple reported $111 billion in the stock is down. I don’t know about you but this doesn’t make any sense to me￼￼￼
"We will be green before close, so predictable; tomorrow and beyond upwards. $200 is so realistic short term."
Buy now. Will only go up now. Profit takers are gone
Un-fing believable that Tesla lost less % today. I’m taking a stock market break
Soooo whats the deal for earnings??? Puts or Calls? What price??
If you thought this was a good day for Apple WAIT TILL TOMORROW.....
This is good aapl is staying around $128-$130. Aapl is spring coiled ready after earnings. It will be buy the news on this.
150 by earnings.
"This stock just won't keep ticking, it drops significantly."
Why do people not understand this is a looooong term stock. Just keep buying on the dips.
"I will put it to you this way, if we run up 50 percent up from here say 200, you are knocking on the door of a 4 TRILLION dollar company. Seems to me that this would put it at around a 50 PE ratio and very very very expensive stock."
"If Apple can break $150, well look out. It might go up in chunks of $10 for awhile and reach $200 in no time if that happens."
New reddit instructions. Sell all of your apple shares and put everything you have into silver.
Do they report pre market or after market tomorrow?
Joe and Sean have $125 puts so they trying to scare people into selling to drive the price down. Lol you are on the wrong board. Retailers don't drive the price up or down.... Hedgies do.
In a perfect word..?Gap at open then runs...NO am DIPS
Sell sell sell.........Apple will disappoint this time around. Expectations are too lofty. Tomorrow it will open below $125.......
"If you are wondering why AAPL would choose Kia, it is because they have the Manufacturing Capacity infrastructure. As soon as the deal is finalized, the name will change to something like ""The Apple Auto Corp."" The Kia name will go away. This is only for the infrastructure."
Street is thinking that Apple profits topped out in the last qtr.Still my PT is $150 by 4/15.
Easy $135 tomorrow.
"'A combination of pent up demand and a host of 5G models are likely driving the iPhone's robust sales. The report suggests that the momentum is expected to continue through China's Lunar New Year holiday on Feb. 12, which would give Apple another quarter of ""staggering"" sales similar to Q4.`"
This stock is the foundation of my portfolio. It's the one stock I never worry about. Have plenty of great runners but when they burn out those profits go into AAPL.
what not to like?--Revenue: $111.44 billion versus $103.12 billion expected--Earnings per share: $1.68 versus $1.42 expected--iPhone revenue: $65.68 billion versus $60.33 billion expected--Service revenue: $15.76 versus $14.89 billion expected
Ready 4 Wednesday shorts? Make sure 2 cover!
I repeat $400 on it's way
"It will start moving up after this week calls expiration, look at the volume of calls expiring 29 Jan."
see you at $140 tomorrow
The street doesn’t like cautious outlook: Apple is just being prudent
"Get ready for 10.00 a gallon gasoline. The nut case signing all the executive orders that he hasn’t even read is about to bankrupt America. These executive orders are coming from the squad, Pelosi and Harris. You’ll be selling shares of apple just so you can fill your tank."
Do we see 140 tomorrow?
APPL just had 10% CORRECTION. Do you know what happens after that in 2-4 weeks?
After hours
this is one I never worry about . Long term green hold.
"I already earned 10k with Apple in December what else to hope for its like I got the 150 price everybodys hoping for already. Bought new 27 inches Mac, iPad and iPhone watch."
"This is astounding, what other company is reporting $100 billion quarters?? Makes no sense why this stock is down in AH."
We need a short squeeze.
Blowout number on Housing Starts. The de facto number I always look at for a precursor on the economy. The Party continues and Apple soars compadres. Enjoy the ride up! 
"Another $2-$3 gain coming tomorrow, up and up until earnings and then BOOM!!!"
"Goody Morning Ladies (and guys too). The office next door where the shorts and day traders lodge ain't sayin much today. I being kind hearted said to them ""fellas yo want me to get yo some donuts"". May be little bit sugar will make them jumpy and they will then decide to coverth their short positions. Because frankly, surely, dearly the margin call cometh soon so need to cover yo short positions. Thanko"
A lot of drama in the comments. I have held AAPL for 15 years. It is earnings day and this normal volatility. Given the general market downturn today this is a minor dip at the end of the day. All of the guidance is good. Likely the results will be also. The world is not ending and China is not controlling the POTUS. Give me a break. It’s the stock market. If you can’t handle risk or fluctuations then go home.
A blooming APPLE a day keeps the shorts at bay. To my long holders of AAPL enjoy the journey and the best is yet to come.
"aside from their recent actions, $AAPL is still a great holding. its name i want to be (and currently am) long."
Whoa just saw the Kia news...3.4b investment Feb 17th?
Goodluck tmrw
Buy before the formal Hyundai announcement and Earnings release.
Apple price target raised by Wells Fargo to $160
"Today is non farm payroll report. The biggest market moving news event. If it beats expectations market will go up big including Apple if it misses, market will tank including Apple."
I wonder how much stimulus is headed straight to Apple products.
"Hope this doesn't tank, then we all know manipulation is a problem."
I don't really care if the price goes up after earnings report because I'm not selling any of my shares for at least 5 to 7 years anyway.
no doubt the stock will be 140 or so on earnings date...just buy and relax from here until next Thursday...I think some big gains are coming after this ER
"coming back up ,"
"140 and up, good to go"
New price target is $155.00
"For those keeping count.... Almost 8,200 shares now. My biggest regret is not getting into Apple earlier when I could have."
Word still getting out about car! Tomorrow will be huge
guess I should sell and get into AMC
"GME tanking as AAPL rises, good news"
Apple will not go over 142 before Friday at 4 PM that’s option expiration those 142.00 calls will not be in the money. If you know anything about options.. Much good news this morning and did not affect the price going up. ￼142.00 a bunch of good news this morning it’s all about options expire Friday for Apple will Go. over 145 next week￼
poor shorts in the office next door. Big brief cases with lap top groaning and knaing their teeth in agony liketh it is our fault. I sayrth go long fella and beeeee happy. Thanko
Gamblers go TeslaInvestors go Apple
Expect to see 137 today....over 140 by ER next week....170 post ER...play accordingly
Next up iCar....March here we come
Oh my God VXN and VIX are down big time now a sure indication that Nasdaq and S&P will rise sharply today
Unbelievable price. I added to my position. Will be $200 this year.
"apple finally peaked at 145. it is been a complete disaster. sell apple, buy Tesla and sava."
"Truly amazing!Before earnings, the Jan 29 $130/$135 call spread was 80% at $4.Here we are!"
The only way Apple was going up today was if they did 300 billion in revenue for the quarter. The move was built in and they sold on the news. Soon though a move upward is coming
This makes no common sense garbage stocks go up and the best earnings and profits and strongest company in the world stock tanks it should of exploded..very confused. Still buying for long term very disappointed for today
Sell the news is over....earnings fundamentals will prevail as always and we start trending higher....
"I plan on accumulating sub $145 hoping for $155, what you all think?"
Nasdaq goes down 50 Apple goes down 3-5 dollars gotta love it haha. But nasdaq up 2 days in a row and barely moves!!!!!
yo ladies and guys too I talked to all the Babbas today and we all agree a big short covering tomorrow will send market skyrocketing the next week.
"The Apple Badge on a car alone is worth 500,000 vehicles. Apple users are loyal to the core. Getting them to switch is like pulling a bone away from a Rottweiler. Ain’t happening, Cars have become Technology on wheels. Long term who do you think wins that battle? I thought so. Hehe "
$135 soon
"Wedbush Dan Ives raises his price target to $175 from $160 with an outperform rating, nice!"
"You elected him and now you’re going to pay the consequences. Inflation, job loss, rising interest rates, declining property values and a major market correction. Congratulations"
Guess who profits from the keystone pipeline shut down....Warren Buffet.Do your research..
what are the best call options? i like Feb 19 $140 they should double maybe triple easily from today's price that's been the pattern into earnings every quarter for some time with exception of last quarter
CNBC SQUAWK BOX great report this morning on continued talks between Apple and Hyundai for EV.
Disgusted.
A great buying opportunity today before market open ...this bargain low price won't last long ...buy more on the dip
Sold my remaining shares at $139. Might get back in tomorrow if it dips to $135. I love Apple but i'm so tired of this stock its been stagnant for 7 months. I'll buy back in tomorrow at $135
So current year high estimate eps at 4.76 gives Apple an after net cash PE of 37 at a 185 stock price....$185 at year end sounds about right to me unless of course Apple blows past the high estimate. Which they always do.
AAPL is Zack's Rank 1 (Strong Buy) today and is now top 1% stock. Not surprised!!
Anyone else wondering why Analysts have not upgraded AAPL / revised their PT after earnings & blowout quarter?
If I didn’t promise myself not to buy any more Aapl stock because I am overweight in it in my portfolio I would buy it at this price. Unfortunately I need to to focus on other stocks right now. AAPL won’t stay low. Even if there is another bear market people should still dollar cost average and AAPL always recovers fast. One of the most stable tech stock besides MSFT.
We r waiting for next wave of AAPL-Short-Guyzz.. NO MERCY..$180?
"Good company, Ok management but P/E a little elevated given their current growth rate. Safe long term bet I guess"
"APPL closed Fri @ 139.07 + 2.20 on significant volume of 114.46 million shares and then moved up after hours another 1.29 to 140.46. Objective analysis indicate AAPL will go much higher, buying more on Monday. “Buy it don’t trade it” will make you rich without RISK...IT REARLY WORKS! Tim Cook and AAPL are the best of the best. Thank you Tim Cook for keeping AAPL # 1. Great # GLTA"
$140 LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
I expect 160 $ on the 27th after earnings 
A positive day today. Additionally a big sharp rise next week after the inauguration. Market loves stability but also loves the composition of the H and S. No clear majority. Then quarterly results will be great. They have been great so far. Next week they will come pouring in. Also next round of stimulus checks on its way. I am buying a lot either my core holdings or mutual funds from Fidelity
"Icar: they won’t have to do this, but could you imagine a small discount for all Apple customers? 100,000 gone in five minutes....or less."
"while $GME $AMC $BB $NOK are crashing down, apple is preparing for takeoff! 150$ here we come!"
I BUY EACH TIME APPLE DROPS HAD APPL OVER 30 YEARS.
question will you sell now pay tax on short term gains or hold an chance the stock dropping??
Aapl is to me the short term creme de la creme because if for whatever reason the markets doesn’t agree with the technicals you can easily switch to a longterm strategy..
"alright to all the noobs talking about selling, we are seeing a market correction, has nothing to do with apple. apple has never disappointed with earnings and the outlook is fantastic. if you cant take a 2 or even 10% loss, get the hell out of the stock market"
Aapl drops 3.5 % in one day equals almost 90 billion $ traded in one day that is 5 x the whole market cap of gamestop!!!!Gamestop media #$%$ is not the reason big tech sold off.
Show me the money
buy on the today's dip. be patient. TODAY WILL END RED.
its only a loss if you sell it. just buy the dips people. once it turns it turns fast in either direction. the way the market trades now the dips happen fast to panic selling. the RH traders are on to this manipulation by the big boys.
Longs here that have held for 5 years or more please tell people here how important it is to buy and hold. I’m a new long bought from March 2020 up until $129 I’m excited about the splits/dividend snowball effect
"It's not the shorts, its the market makers, if you look at GME for the past few days, you will see that WS can manipulate any COMPANY on the up or downside, that is the bottom line, Apple is no different. Its driven by options this week. If you had any doubts, GME confirmed it!"
Guys sell at the money Calls then!
Breaking news: First images of the new Appl Car
"The volume of retail trade can’t set AAPL price accurately, because it’s overpowered by wash trading of manipulators making weekly option premium income. Once wash trading no longer cost effective for this purpose, AAPL will trend higher"
"It's pretty simple. Buy and hold this best brand in the world, sit back and relax! Don't let the market ups & downs bother you unnecessarily. If you want quick profits, go and risk it all with GME, AMC and etc.Tim Cook reminded the world last night (once again) that even with the blow out quarter, there's so much market share that AAPL can tap into in addition to new products in the works. Just look at AAPL's stock chart for the last 5-10 years. Don't listen to all these short term naysayers that are just trying to #$%$ out so that they can make a quick buck. They probably accessed this board on their Apple device. :-)"
Apple has blowout quarter and barely budged and Google earnings gets a thumbs up and an Amen & is up 7% pm.
"Does AAPL plan on using the electric generating glass from CVUEF to power the next generation iPhones,iPads,computers or electric cars?"
I agree... It is a great company!... The market is just erratic....
Big (smart investors) looking into upcoming earnings. Getting in before Apple  jumps over $145
apple is invulnerable to any recession. people will line up to buy $1000 phones
It should be going up with such a good report
"Expert and market maker, smart money and shorties insitution knows AAPL will gap up after hours above 150. AMAZON will send indexes huge due to consumer expenditure in the rise despite covid. Now with new stimulus will grow even higher indexes. I am loading on AAPL, AMZN or MCD at any pulldown to buy more"
"The smart investor will jump on this while it's still at 140 because in one month it will be $165, mark this post!!!"
Can anyone explain to me apples 14 million debt deal ? Is it good for the stock or bad ?
tomorrow regular hours up $5.....after hours up $20
apple is unwatchable and totally manipulated. don't day trade this stock. leave it in the drawer.
Apple says Xmas sales are higher then any other years combined.
If Apple car is announced you’re looking at 140-145 by Friday
More Republicans coming forward to support impeachment. UH Oh....
Apple like a stallion being held back! He gonna break loose when earnings announced
"Ahem! Apple sunk from$145 to $131 during four trading days, that's TWELVE PERCENT market cap that has evaporated, or 400 BILLION DOLLARS in a two trillion dollar company. During normal times this would be panic time, but after the GREATEST QUARTER IN COMPANY HISTORY it's an outrage. Bernie Madoff was secretly named COO, by any chance?"
Dang expected to wake up seeing $145. It’s all good we’re going to eat today
I predict the car will only come with white paint.
LETS TAKEOFF
"All the other stock are killing it except Apple. PEanut gain for the day. Can someone help me with this, I just don't get it. Is there someone purposely after this stock in a bad way. We can't gain any ground and hold it."
I thought this was about Apple but I see it’s turning political. I don’t want the vaccine so you can have mine. The Tuskegee Experiment was enough fir me. I hope they have enough for you Dennis!
A house does not count down the tree that gives it shade.$126 has been the line in the sand - the pivot.Eight trading days until earnings - 1/27.I think the time for trading is now suspended. Everyone got fat at the table anyway.Stay long
"Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple People power can make price discovery happen"
I agree. Buy after hours and accumulate is the key. Smart money will gap up above 150..you will see
Bargain under 150. Load up.
See yall at 155
Come on!! We need to go higher
 Apple is king of the mountain 
Go whine somewhere else Kevin. This is an Apple stock forum!!
I always get annoyed when I buy a stock and it doesn’t guy up right away
Fasten seat belts...3T here we come.
what's going on?! I hope this isn't the iCar rumor again.
I wasn’t totally convinced that the new 5G phone was going to sell this well. But it is. It’s being subsidized heavily by the carriers. Probably because it uses more data because it’s faster.
"CRAPPLE by Kia. Not responsible for rollovers, water pump leaks, radiator leaks, serpentine belt slips inaccessible oil pans or inferior ball joints causing loss of wheel. Other than that buy buy buy!"
Tim Cook needs to focus on our stock price not Facebook.
target raised to 150 by canccord. AAPL will jump to over 142 before earnings and then to 148. get in right now before it is too late
111.4 Billion quarter and the Wall street crooks sell it off anyway. You could not possibly come up with a better quarter than this. In the mean time the crooks of WallStreet took GME to 300 today.
VIX futures are down 10.5% WOW a sure indication that Nasdaq and S&P will be up big time today

"People don't understand why the new iPhone 12 pro is never before seen levels of utility. 12 pros have a lidar built in, allowing extremely accurate bokeh, autofocusing in a tenth the speed of Samsung, enables full ar gaming and productive apps, and more. aka apple glasses."
"Crazy low valuation...Future PE below 10!! CVS will benefit from vaccine roll out and fully integrated omnichanel for health care with now integrated AETNA acquisition.....great New CEO (from AETNA). Do your own DD but very bullish on this pick for 2021! Also like Loblaws in Canada, $FDX and $AAPL since it was 11 PE 5 years ago......"
VIX and VXN both unchanged. A great  indicator the markets will rise sharply today
"ayo, imagine selling a company that netted $25b in one quarter and is now expanding into the EV industry LOL"
"The FED has PUMPED Oil price from $1.00 to $60.00 in no time, Despite Shrinking demand and Exponentially rising supply!Inflation is skyrocketing! There is MASSIVE STOCK BUBBLE! There is Massive Oil price BUBBLE!$AAPL $JPM $TSLA"
People selling here. Smh
Drop the mic! Boom Kia apple
I still agree with the forecast of 192$ target
CNBC is fake news!
To everyone complaining that Apple not remove a particular app....can you please get out already. Don't let the door hit you on your way out. We come here not to read about political nonsesnse. Please sell your shares and/or short the stock already. Thank you. I'll buy the dip. See you at $3T market cap in the near future.
"Don’t listen to shorts, same thing happened at open yesterday and we closed on the high point. Give it an hour or 2 for the volatility to cool off and she will climb up fast towards the close"
This will be down big tomorrow. Shaking all the weak hands out..
"Every one just relax, AAPL will do what we longs all hope for. AAPL will not disappoint,"

Apple price raise from $140 to $170 by Cascend!!
"Did you know there’s no real outbreak of COVID in China? I hear the new saying is “Come do business in China, CoronaVirus free”, CEO of Moderna stated that Covid is with us forever. If that is the case and China can continue to effectively contain it, how does this effect their economy and society over 5-10 or say even the long term effects over 50-100 years?"
I got a feb 26 call that’s already itm. Does it make sense to get a put for this Friday incase it drops after earnings ? Let me hear your opinions
In third world Apple brand is taken as a sign of prestige. Owning Apple product means earning a prestige there. I believe this company’s R&D can revive fossils and bring those prehistoric life back on earth.
Strong resistance at $138. Will it pass today?
I'm so glad that my Apple & Amazon shares finally decided to wake up from their 5 month long hibernation. These 2 stock have gone nowhere since August and my Tesla shares had had to shoulder the burden for my portfolio. Now Apple & Amazon can take over and give my Tesla shares a break.
We rally tomorrow the numbers are just too good.....just watch
"FOR THE MORALE OF THE CUSTOMERS, INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES, AAPL NEED TO BE UP AFTER A 111 BILLION IN EARNING. COOK DO SOMETHING OR RELINQUISH YOUR PISITION"
They keep selling I keep buying. Gives me that tickley feeling down there!!
All the Kia haters why would Apple go to a luxury brand they will not be able to meet the demand with supply. So they go with Kia and Hyundai as they can produce more vehicles that are also reliable. It also taps into the Asian markets.
"Revenue beat by 8 billion, who else can do that?"
"Stock still trades for 30 times earnings expected in 2021 of 5.14. The stock traded at 15 times earnings from 2015 to 2017. Yes it has great growth during the pandemic and 5g cycle, but it will fade."
Why would anyone sell before earnings this is going to $160??
How come we are down $10 from the all time high with the best quarter ever during a pandemic ?
"i told you to reserve cash so you can buy now..opportunity to buy now: AAPL, V, CRM...Uptredn contunues...Solid earnings on AAPL and all FAANG has been roboust...buymore"

"Does anyone know, or can confirm, that APPL is working on VR glasses?"
"Haaaaa. Wait until Tim Cook starts talking about 4th quarter sales , then guidance. You haven’t seen nothing yet!"
On its way to $400!!!!
What Apple has done to Parler - i will never invest in their company again. Shares products etc. there are plenty of great other companies out there. Freedom of speech is something not to be taken lightly. Apple has no business being political. All of the social media companies have no business being political. FB Amazon Google Apple Got rid of all that could be any of support to them and won’t be part of their money making machine. At the end of the day they only reason they make money is because of each individual. They should be paying the people not your liberal party In the government
"Buy the dip!! It’s an opportunity to have more stocks. Apple is huge and huge plans for 2021. Apple is not just iPhone now, they are in hardware and number of services."
See you should be buying companies that lose tons of money. They go up like 150 points a day.. like that makes sense.
$138 Today
I requested wire to be transfer tomorrow. I want to buy more AAPL at 10.00ET. banker said usually money arrived in morning . I hope I can buy before 150 breakout. AMZN was upgraded to 4000 and stocks is following AAPL pattern . Machine learning said after earnings usually takes few days to break a new high before earning date. AAPL will break 150 ...no question.
"Ok. The whole car thing is a bad idea. Apple is not an car company. Next, who wants a Hyundai? Seems like a bad idea. Just getting cheap cars so they can jack up the price."
Let's go Apple Love green Apples. Hit that 140 mark soon!!!
SELL THE NEWS.....MARKET GONNA CONTINUE IT'S SELL OFF TOMORROWTHE CORRECTION IS DUE ... BE CAREFUL
MSFT indicator - tomorrow AAPL smashed earnings!! Huge !!
"imagine buying calls right before the market closed, they will have a good day tomorrow"
Looks like America is back on the path to become one giant Detroit City.
"IF Apple has an earnings call like Netflix did, we’re looking at $165 immediately; and that’s if no gains before earnings (~18%).Everyone seems to be going all-in on everything big Tech; no issues pushing these stocks to stratosphere."
My brokers servers are down. What is happening to apple people ??
SEC does nothing for the individual investor. They make rules to allow big business to cheat investors. How about the same access and rules for everybody?
I don't believe there has a green day for the market when Apple reports for at least 4 quarters
Knowing how it trades in the final hour...lucky if it holds green.
Need sterling report and bounce in market futures. Held up pretty well today so let’s see.
Bullish on the day ahed ! The Apple Kia deal is great news !
I recently sold a condo and put the entire $190k in appl at $128.80. 1475 shares. I guess my taxes will be covered for the sale by next year. Life is good
Evercore raises Apple from 145 to street high 160....talks about how the Apple Car will be a game changer
"Buy COTY, huge potential upside, easily gain 30% by next week. Still dust cheap."
"Apple is a hold and accumulate, not a trading stock."
"I dumped this a while back. Even when they knock it out of the park, their stock drops. I just don't get it. I'll get back in after it drops some more."
They are piling into Apple today! about time. Big quarter coming
Alert: All the stocks that were up today will fall and AAPl will buck the trend and recovers all the losses. Thanks for trading accordingly
Everything is going to be alright! Going to make some money...
Head fake. Should go up after open. Wonder when Apple  will buy stocks? And will it be noticeable in the price jumping?
Next Monday the rally starts!
"""Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries"" Take a look at LIT, no matter who makes EV everyone needs lithium"
The rank and file here seem a little upset about waiting 5 years for a car deal with Kia to materialize...and it'll start out with 10 cars that need updates
"I think some are missing the point with apple car.First of all,it’s been reported by msnbc that the Kia/Hyundai partnership is not exclusive,apple can partner with other manufacturers.Second,apple is not designing a car,that’s the manufactures job.Apple will design aspects of interior,with occupants in mind.They are designing the software for fully autonomous driving.Apple will supply software,hardware like dash displays and entertainment centres,and services,like apple play,arcade,tv,news etc.This is what apple is good at.The only thing new to apple is the battery design.and if apple can build a better battery than exists today ,the market for it is gigantic.That’s what apple has always done,build it better than every one else.Not often the first but always the best."
One day soon with 10% UP will take care of everything !!!Options are the one killing this stockInvest in the company and support what they are doing- don't bet on OPTIONS
So we have gone up $2 a share since early September. Way to go Timmy. Utter fail.
A 5$ worth GME touched 240$ ...AAPL supposed be 200$ by tomorrow
"I have the futures pinned on my I-phone it says the following:- Dow=unchanged, Nasdaq =unchanged and S&P =unchanged. Why? Because the future market does not open till 6:00 pm eastern time"
"Hedge funds covering their short position in GME, AMC, BB, BBY, Nok.They have to resort to selling stocks like Apple. The market to say the least is broken for now. I hope this will not be new normal."
Those February 19th $130-$135 Calls will be worth a great deal more if AAPL Runs to $140-$150 after January earnings. 
"Every time Apple starts going up, these analysts knock it down. Apple is adaptable, intelligent and innovative. They’re going nowhere but up, I started investing in it 20 years ago when people said it would be out of business in two years and just look at the charts over the long hall. They’ll blow the doors off with the earnings report and the analysts will still say, but....."
"I’m so happy to see the fight between $AAPL and $FB. I hope they run each other into the ground. BTW, when is Tim going to delete the Facebook app from the App Store? Or is he all talk?"
"@Anonymous silence...we haven't forgotten what you said yesterday. you said ""$120 tomorrow"" so what happened?"
Green Apples taste the best
"Options @135 expiring this Friday are heavy. Don't imagine this can push through that amount of money the MMs lose by 135s executing. But, there is no manipulation in the markets..."
Goldman lost another 55 million on AAPL today.Rod Hall sure called it right.
"bought more at 135 thinking that was going to be the bottom. this thing is free falling like a sky diver without a parachute. long term hold. better days ahead, but it could be a while."
Guys if the market opens do you think the stock will go down or up in price.
"I have 4,800 shares @ 37.00.Tomorrow AM I am selling and paying the taxes.AAPL is now uninvestable."
"What's wild to me is that people that can't even spell, or use punctuation correctly, think their assessment of current market conditions and AAPL's financial well-being is anything remotely worth listening to. If you're looking for answers... read through the literature your broker provides."
Got my money in Apple and BCAP let’s get this bread
This thing has had a great run up and some traders are taking profits. Don’t panic. It will probably end up in the green by the close
this stock should be up 10 dollars
ms katy huberty upper her pt to 152 from 144... earnings will beat so we should see 150 after earnings.
"Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers raised the firm’s price target on Apple to $155 from $140 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares.The China Academy of Information & Communications Technology this week released the December smartphone shipment data for December, which reflected another positive data point for Apple’s iPhone 12 cycle, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers tells investors in a research note. China total mobile phones shipped stood at 26.6M in December 2020, a decline of 13% year-over-year and 10% month-over-month, says the analyst. “Continued positive Apple data points” leaving Rakers increasingly comfortable that Apple will post upside to current expectations. He also likes the company’s “continued strong capital allocation story.”"
"This is exactly what those Robin hooders and whoever is complaining are talking about !!! Sell off during business hours , drive the price down and pick it back up when most of us can't !! Nice"
"Could not be more blatantly obvious that AAPL is being artificially bound to a narrow trading range...all for the few pennies in option premiums by Vanguard, BlackRock, Berkshire, and State Street. AAPL option players should show solidarity like TSLA longs and boycott options"
Take my advice keep buying Apple . Will be double by Christmas 
Buybacks enhance the equity position of Apple longs. It doesn’t do much for the traders though. Personally happy with the buybacks.
"even with record breaking earnings and EV news, it does not spike much. Why? If you were Cook and you plan a massive shares buyback, wouldn't you rather pay a lower price?"
"Could it be any more obvious that there was manipulation DURING the session when algos run, when AAPL takes off AH?"
Cannot stop this((((( $165 by)))))) Wednesday. These momentum will continue for entire year until it make $200. I am Long and not selling. still a good buy .. Some one bought 100contract of Apple Option of 2022 that is a very strong sign. Good Buying opportunity
I've just added to my AAPL position. Patience. Stay long.
"INSANE, AAPL WILL BE UP 8 -10 TOMORROW. EVEN ROBINHOOD INVESTORS ARE BUYING VERY BIG"
$FSR spilled the bean!!!! Time for us to take off. Let’s go!
"Dear my Apple compatriots. Do you feel like you have missed out on Biotech revolution?? NVAX AND MRNA are making tons of money and Covid Viruses won't be disappearing anytime soon per Public Health officials. There is one biotech Company that has been under the radar, but it is ready for blast off just like NVAX AND MRNA. That Company is Senseonic. As a diabetic instructor for over 10 years, I would say what Eversense CGM offers is as good or better than what Dexcom G6 or Abbott Libre brings. All CGM currently on the market are great but what sets Eversense XL from other CGM is the freedom from frequent site changes. After Eversense has been implanted it’s good for 90 days. In the 2nd qtr of 2021, FDA will approve 180 day model. Finally in 2023, Senseonics plan to get FDA approval for 365 day CGM. Every other CGM in the market requires switching out every 2 to 4 weeks. Also since Eversense is internal CGM, you can swim or exercise without much restrictions. Other CGM models are external and sensors need to be changed out more frequently. There is always possibility Abbot, Medtronic or Dexcom could buyout the company in the future. If Eversense 365 XL ever get approval from FDA in 2023, it would be very difficult for other CGM to compete with Senseonic. It would be like APPLE in 2007, unveiling revolutionary IPhone that completely changed the smartphone market. I believe Eversense 365 could do that to CGM market in 2023. When Apple announced IPhone to the world in 2007, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and Black Berry laughed at Steve Jobs. We know what happened within 3 years of IPhone announcement"
Could investors get a special dividend? Apple  has lots of cash to reward us long term holders
Hope Tesla doesn’t beat us.
what do we think? Up or down Monday?
My near term target is $180
I wish everyone the best this week looks like a great start
Well goody goody morning ladies (guys too). Up it goes sweetie pie my beloved Apple. Gettin into car making and WOW! and more WOW! Buyeth and keep away yo shares because yo will well. Just listen to Babba which is me. Babba tell yo the truth. Thanko
"Anybody who thinks Hyundai/Kia is not quality has not left their MY Space page yet....been producing quality for 10+ years ....10/100,00 warranty.... is the best in the business because they don't break down often"
Do NOT forget that Apple’s Q2 will include 3 full months of 12 Phone Sales instead of 2 months.......AND almost ALL of the Holiday Gift Cards will be redeemed and counted as Sales in Q2. Q2 will be another grand slam blowout quarter.
end of day to closed at $146.
Holding.
Here is a positive injection. AAPL will be in the positive at closing today.
Needham BUY and target 170 - the first of many to come .
you know it will be down tomorrow- for sure
AAPL will tank tomorrow. Big funds & huge investors need to have the market go down so they can get cheap shares. Looking for a 10% drop in the markets.
Did it really go over $139 or no? I was away today.
We soar like eagles tomorrow morning...see ya all at $150 and beyond!
How many times has the FAANG trade saved the market !!! They are the defensive stocks to buy when the futures are red !
Can Apple just do all of it's own financing similar to what they do with IPhone?
Can Apple come up clutch like Microsoft?
I need to see atleast 138$ to sleep in peace
Now onwards Apple only up
"I think Amazon and Google cometh out with results today. Babba think it will be the greatest cover and the market runneth up to the sky today, tomorrow, rest of the week and yes siri bob rest of the year. Babba buys more and so do most of other Babbas and yo do the same thing. Yo hear! buyeth more and hold on to them shares because people upto no good will tell yo to sell. do not listeen to them for the Mercy of God! Thanko"
AAPL Hyundai car is no different than other autos with Apple car play! TSLA is way ahead here. This is a disaster in the making. It's like saying Nathans is going in the business of Cupcakes instead of hot dogs! Nice secondary line but not really professional imho.
The redness of AAPL shares on Thursday is a certainty.
I sent to my group to loud up on AAPL. Profit taking can not go below pre earning day level. Correction is coming soon. Buy to accumulate and hold. That's the secret. Buy any pullback and accumulate. I am buying at the opening. The short squeeze is coming
It's not automatic to buy this stock at it's high right before earnings report...
"The all time high was $138 followed four days later with a $12 dip to $126+.Then it pivoted to $134+. Last year in Jan 20 AAPL rallied strong $80+ ( $32 pre split) coming out of the box only to dip in Feb to $53 ($212 pre-split)). Now,,,$127+My point?Both times people muscled the stock and it did not workThese mini ""V's"" accomplish so much more w/o hurting people. IT gives new investors a discount price and algorithim players a chance to do what they do best.People whom stayed long had the last laugh!Have anice day"
"Muted DM, the board feels better already."
Thumbs up if this going back to 138 thumbs down if over valued
Apple is set to give Tesla a real run when it comes to e-cars. They have married with a major car company that knows how to make cars in volume. They will also have the Apple appeal for younger folks and also the luxury feel that attracts Tesla customers. These new cars will be a MAJOR hit and solidify Apples position for the next 15 years. You won't be able to touch APPL below $1000 a share if not double that once cars are selling.
Dow will drop 750-1000.People do not like or trust the market adter this.It happened in the 1980's and it took decades before another generation started buying stocks again.
Stay invested and stay long forever. Honest to God that’s what I do .
"If I had a dollar for every conspiracy theorist who blamed ""hedge funds"" for their problems today, I'd be a millionaire. Wait a second... I have over a million dollars of AAPL right now, so I already am one."
"WARNING to all AAPL share holders! Go onto AAPL investor relations website and tell them to buy Lucid Motors before someone else does. They are rumored to make a deal soon with a SPAC and AAPL could own them right now if they showed initiative. Lucid is the future of EV's and AAPL should consider buying them instead of competing against them. Bottom line, would you rather see them make a deal with Cheap Car maker Kia or a Quality name like Lucid? They both have the manufacturing facilities in place. Send the emails folks. This would be a great boost for AAPL if they make the Lucid Deal."
Apple is a stock that you should hold forever. Same as MSFT or GOOG.
another $1 down...100% manipulation..
"Your patience will be rewarded. With Covid still emerging everywhere, online AAPL device sales will only accelerate through Q3 this year. Mark it."
buy it & hold it and next week it can be around 150 
if msft earnings are any indication aapl should blow away earnings. This stock after hours and throughout the day tomorrow is going to explode.
"$AAPL reports BOGUS revenues with ""accounting magic"". However, even those BOGUS revenues are NOT enough to justify current ABSURD Valuation!AAPL has $35.00 fair value!"
"To all call holders, if you don’t want your position to expire worthless, but atleast 10 shares of apple a piece! I am going to do it! Let’s give these WSB guys a taste of their own medicine. Like this post whoever is in! United we stand, divided we fall"
"4:30 when news is normally released , right?"
Wisdom of crowds: Will AAPL provide positive or negative surprise on next earnings? Please vote with thumbs up or thumbs down. Curious what this group collectively believes.
Prior to the Game Stop Event Apple was trading at the 143 level and as a result of the selling that took place in long positions in order to cover short term positions in Game Stop Apple stock was being sold along with other companies as the market declined. Right now Apple is a steal at these levels and stock price will be pushed back up to that level very quickly.
Will you but TESLA EV at $850.00 OR AAPL tech and apple EV AT $137.00?? DUH!!!
Any chance this pulls back to 135 before earnings
Heading up slow and steady get on the train folks
"""A number of equities research analysts recently weighed in on the stock. Wedbush boosted their price objective on shares of Apple from $150.00 to $160.00 and gave the company an “outperform” rating in a research report on Wednesday, December 9th. Needham & Company LLC reiterated a “buy” rating and set a $140.00 price target on shares of Apple in a research report on Wednesday""...Might hit these numbers at the end of this month with record breaking earnings!!"
the Jan 29 150 calls are in play now.....
Loving this slow climb.
Apple will be $200 middle of summer. Last chance
People are complaining about no guidance. How can you do it with uncertainties? We didn’t provide any guidance last quarter why now? The results would be the same. Beat! Beat! Beat!
You guys would know what's going on in the market we should buy the hell out of this and get a group together and drive the price way up
Well it looks like Kia and Apple to build Apple Car in Georgia Plant in 2024.
Shorts don’t sweat. Can you feel the power of Apple? 
"AAPL is always full of surprises. We know the earnings will be stellar.With this wonderful 5 day bump under our belt, are we at the point where the coming earnings factor is just about all 'baked in'?"
Best message board quote of the day:“This was so gonna be in the money if none of this stuff that’s going on happened.”— @Michael
everyone spent there money on GameStop.
There have been so many more money opportunities in the market 3 days in a row this sits hear like a dead whale hoping it goes to 140? This will sit here like Amazon for months the high flying belongs to other stocks now and yes own it too
"Sad I didn't buy more yesterday, but that doesn't matter with what's coming next week."
Today’s action is just a mating dance in lieu of the ER report. Then the real action begins. Hehe. Fly Apple Fly 
"nice gain, glad I bought today... Seems like a cheap price for a possible EV play"
i saw the report from apple and it said that the profit was of 20% compared to 2019. Why is the stock going down then? Can someone please explain!
AMD up big after huge revenue and earnings beat - This plus Msoft earnings bodes well for Apple tomorrow!!
"Each seat will have their own iPad built in station so you can watch and play at the same time. Man, this is iphone on wheels at its finest. #siriTakeOver"

"If Microsoft is up $15 on a strong beat of 3 billion, Apple is going up $20! Let’s go!!"
All the money pouring back into faang Apple included
Options on fire LETS GOOOO
"See, this is why they teach you in MBA school to ALWAYS make a diversified investment portfolio. Yesterday my Amazon shares was sleeping, so my Apple & Tesla shares shouldered the burden of carrying the portfolio. Today my Apple shares sleeps and my Amazon & Tesla carries the burden. Those 3 stocks are the anchors of my portfolio. All of the other stocks within the portfolio are the supporting players..."
"If u remember Apple did the same thing a few weeks ago, then took off! Just hang in there, better days are a head!"
The Earnings Train is leaving the station. Get onboard.
I would love to see an Apple Car Teaser during Sunday's Super Bowl. Unveil a hint of the secrecy.
CONGRATS IN ADVANCE if you are accumulating those FEBRUARY $130-$135 CALLS ON DISCOUNT BEFORE EARNINGS. 
"I did not see Apple trading sideways today coming ! The Kia announcement is good news and this is happening  Bullish for the future though! Despite the blatant, rampant, market manipulation"
"Tomorrow's reaction when everyone sees that Apple made $111 billion in one quarter, beating estimates by $8B..."
"American Airlines loses billions and surges 64% PM and here’s Apple in the red.....rigged market Apple earned $1.68 per share for its latest quarter, versus a consensus estimate of $1.41 a share. Revenue came in well above estimates and surpassed $100 billion for the first time. Apple’s quarter was its most profitable ever, helped by sales of new high-end iPhones as well as laptops and tablets. Apple shares slipped 2% in premarket trading."
I bought apple on Thursday and now m worried about the market due the rebellion thinking it might crash! Should i sell all my fundamental holdings and buy back or wait to recover
"another reason to own aapl long termApple AR headset coming Q1 2022 with LiDAR, says JP Morgan"
VZ report is not a telltale sign of the productivity of AAPL. 80% of new phone sales are upgrades which speaks of loyalty. What you can’t factor is China sales which have skyrocketed along with rest of world with iPhone 12. Price goes up from here post ER
 last three months...going sideways
"I can feel a breakout coming. People that bought in the $140s and you feel bad don’t! Please hold. Look to the future, look at apples chart history"
Great quarter for AAPL. More upgrades coming in the A.M.!!!
"New records, so the price drops by 3%. Geesh. I wish I knew what people wanted to see."
Not to worry. New Revised PTs should be expected which will boost the price. AAPL may buy back!
"quick question, Hyundai owns Kia? or Kia is also on the market cannot find Kias stock lol"
AAPL SHOULD BE VALUED AT A MUCH HIGHER PE PF 100. AAPL TO 200 PER MUNSTER. OVER 160 NEXT WEEK
There was a time when earnings meant something
$4 yesterday $4 today moving like it did before split this is way behind from upgrades for 2 months sat on lows now moving up as long as nasq is up this will rise to earnings when it hits 140 maybe tomorrow then it gets to 145 by Wednesday earnings after the close will pop 15-20 you’ll see Apple around 165-167 Thursday Friday 170 next week if there’s news on Tuesday or WednesdayAnything car dividends making a good pop over 145 maybe hit 150 then we are looking over 170 next Thursday or Friday a 180 stock would blow my Wad
shorts now have 19.5 hours to cover before it's to late
Big hedge funds got they hands in this one trust me.
nice volume coming back in!!
"Wondering if investors in $AMZN, $GOOG, and even $FB and $AAPL are going to transition to $MSFT."
If we used some common sense and logic we will realize that the chip sector or known as the semiconductor sector is hot very very very hot? Why because chips are being used in everything and when the chip sector is selling sizzling hot somebody is buying those chips such as Apple etc etc .My friends stay with technology sector stay with Apple. I get a great feeling every time I think Technology and think Apple. Yes feeling is not enough. One has to look at the ground reality and the ground reality is tremendously positive
Within 12-18 months Apple will have a 3 trillion dollar market cap. It’s inevitable. That puts the share price around $180. That would mean some serious cash for Jim Younger
"Apple is not building the car. That would be a huge waste of their resources when others can do that for them (which they’re actively trying to find rn like Kia, etc.). Where they excel and will outshine others is in their software.They’ll provide the software for the car that’ll be highly optimized and integrated with the apple system it’ll be something worthwhile to see. Furthermore, battery tech is something they’ve prolly been eyeing considering that it’s essential to their lineup for iPhones, etc. They may translate those learnings at a grander scale for the car.Up to you to decide to invest or not. But just remember apple has always surprised and surpassed almost every hurdle they had. I’m thinking if they pull this off it’ll be something else..."
Longs Apple is doing awesome. You can tell by the troll posts here! Haaa the more negative posts I see the better
"I was at Walmart earlier today. The store clerk in electronics said that they have been out of iPads, many of the apple watches, xboxes, and playstations for about 2 1/2 weeks. Apple, Microsoft, and Sony should all have a good fourth quarter."
$175 after earnings. easiest money you’ll ever make.
AAPL could very easily make a deal with Lucid Motors and the should before a SPAC or the likes of Ford Motor Company does. It would be better for AAPL to control them instead of competing against them.
Short sellers must not want to pay the dividend....?
"28 mins before the final bell, still have time to purchase before the rise!!!"
Bought more because why not?
"Folks read this one : JUST BUY APPLE, ESPECIALLY ON THE DIPS!!"
"Earnings coming, we will hopefully see a pre-earning rally next week or one following the good earnings report. I am not worried, nor should you be."
"If u didn’t sell in the $140s, don’t sell now. This thing will come back. It always does"
"After that 4-for-1 split last August I ended with exactly 5,000 shares of Apple. I sure am glad I had the patience to wait out Apple's recent 5 month hibernation. My shares of Apple just made me a little over $20K for my portfolio today. Gotta love the excitement & stomach ulcer of investing!"
This behemoth that has over 16 billion outstanding shares and trades around 100 million shares a day won’t jump 10% in a day. It rises a dollar or two a day on an uptrend. Hang in and watch it slowly grow.
"hold on to apple, $150 next"
Apple in a perfect cup and handle!!!!!
Don’t sell! This is record qtr for Apple and shareprice will reflect that over course of Jan & Feb
who caught shares and loaded calls in the 127s? this guy! (points to myself)
Apple should buy Roku!
"Read a few posts lately regarding Cook & Management. Considering market is up big time this morning, I'm baffled and started to wonder if there is a real disconnect between Apple and market, or market lost appetite."
Tomorrow Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday day after earnings up early than profit takers come in but still closes . Friday more profit takers but will close the week  and at $148.
"Long story in long, strong earnings, strong company, great future, if markets tanks they have capability to come up fast. if you love your money go long with $AAPL, $MSFT, $FB"
Why would anyone short this?
I bought 100K of Yugo stock today on margin.I read on Reddit that Yugo is the next big thing.
Holding thru tech earnings....you need a lobotomy. 3 times in 4 it gets beat up. Just sell it at 3:50pm and buy it back cheaper the next day. Pocket the difference or buy more shares. The risk to reward ration just isn’t there. You need PERFECTION on the report AND markets moving higher. Rarely happens. It’s just not worth holding.
"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated his bullish view on Apple with a $160 price target, and a $200 bull-case price target, representing potential upside of 24% and 55%, respectively."
Terrific results. Solid quarter and greatly positioned for the future.
Apple opened lower in Frankfurt but getting back close to 139 ish at this time
Is it a take off to the Moon. Slow and steady.
Will Apple stock keep going up this week?
A whole generation will be disgusted by SEC if they cannot handle it well!
I think it will not cross 140 because of the options but let's close at $139.99
Margaret the dividend is 0.205
"What a surprise, Moderna saying COVID requires them selling periodic booster vaccines forever...awfully convenient for MRNA"
Tech Titans Rule; and Apple leads the way!
Where is the best site to see stock ratings?
It will run higher. The market is just a little spooked right now.
"So are we ""longterm"" investors that don't like to trade bankrupt companies mentioned on reddit going to lose all our money because now hedge funds have to sell real companies' stocks to cover losses from that joke that just happened?"
APPL should be too smart to get into low margin car making business when the field is so crowed with excess capacity in the world as far as the eye can see. EVs won't gain popular support unless mandated or unless 5 minute charging is possible. Even then EV manufacturing will be limited by key resources. AAPL think of a better idea in a market less crowded and with higher margins.
This is huge for apple .
I didn’t realize that tsla is reporting same day as Apple. Rising tide could send this flying.
All the money is following WSB stocks. No one interested to buy the big techs for now.
Aaaa I feel so good
The volatility will continue this week. Think long term and don’t get too excited each day. Your stomach will thank you
"Think ahed people ! Don’t be spooked by the short term recent news! Yeah apples had a couple of down days but the future is bright ! This week record, growing earnings were reported and the future is filled with new technologies and even a Car or 2 Apple stock is going to boom over the coming years so Buy apple, hold Apple and profit from apple!"
Once market has a correction Apple will hit 100...... maybe $90 a share. Mark this post dreamers....

Shorts working hard to keep this price down! Let's squeeze them! It's going to run to $140...I'm Buying.
The revenue was 10% higher than expected. It’s the Macro environment that got people shell shocked. This will move shortly enough over the next few quarters
"Apple Car.... Nice looking, so cool.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRuLtyIEBDA"
THE SELLERS AND SHORTS NEED TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON. BUYBACKS
"Don’t worry about the short term drops. The market is gaining huge exposure in the younger community due to GME, NOK, and AMC. These people won’t simply stop investing once the volatility is gone. Their money will be spread across the market, especially well known names such as Apple. Hold and enjoy the ride."
I told you guys to sell the news and that we’re going back to fair value around $80. Buy more if you want at these absurd prices but the insolvency crisis is just beginning. I’ll buy the big dip at $80. Good luck to all.

"The last three earnings releases we have seen the SP increase 10 days after earnings, November we saw $10, July we saw $19 and April we saw $4. I have a feeling we will se 160-170 in 15 days."
This should make all small investors in Aapl really mad. Don't you see the big money boys have gotten together and MANIPULATED Aapl and other stocks from 145 down to now. Complaining to the SEC will not do any good. (I tried and got zero results) Congress has got to get involved to straighten out the market. Prices should go up and down based on earnings and expected future results. If Aapl exec are smart they should buyback 2 B as promised between NOW and 160.
Apple should move up nicely tmrw .... all the reporting about KIA EV collaboration... any thoughts?
Still way overvalued. Growth is 10% and stock grown 70%. Will correct in long run.
"Lots of shorts will have no choice but to cover today, they are and have been scared all week!!!"
finally the earnings pop is happening when apple makes this official on their pr tomorrow.
Tesla gets upgraded by Morgan Stanley in after hours. up another 15 points. remember this is equivalent to 75 points pre split. we get 2 upgrades today and we move a tiny amount. Tesla is like a broken slot machine that pays off each day. this is making many amateurs very wealthy. too easy to be happening.
"$AAPL Historical P/E=12AAPL Current P/E=45, but the revenues and earnings are going down and there is NO growth opportunity left. AAPL is a MASSIVE Speculative BUBBLE right now! The stock is trading as PONZI SCHEME!"
Apple $150 Train is leaving the station. High Speed Rail. Get On.

What if the expected revenue is 100b and Apple reportedly came in 110b? Will the share price up 10% 
"Tesla is the tock to own constant gains. Apple is hit ir miss for the short term. If you have 10 years to wait then buy it , it won't let you down."
Both AAPL and MSFT posted awesome results
Not even going to share my opinion on today...
"if you're worried about this market being over bought and ready to crash , there's a good reason , get ready."
This will arise after lunchtime.

This ride up is so well-deserved. I’m so lucky to own a part of the best company in the world. Stay long the best is yet to come...
Once the focus is back on the fundamentals this is going to resume flying again. Won't be long.
Wake me when we get to 200
Remember Blackberry? Of course you don#$%$ no longer relevant. Apple came and changed the landscape of mobile phones just like its going to do with vehicles. Own it and hold long. The future is Apple.
EV car partnerships with several automakers are in fact happening. Apple willPartner rather than manufacture the car which is strategic in its approach since Software and battery technology will be the major deliverable by Apple and carries the highest gross margin

"As just posted, new intra day highs follow double digit ""V"" action"
Does anyone here ever plan to sell their shares of Apple? Or do they just plan on accumulating it until they die and leave it for somebody else to purchase the toys of their dreams?I'm just asking because everyone says they will never sell their Apple shares and hold them forever. No one ever talks about a long-term plan to accumulate and purchase something that they've always desired.
Let’s be honest. It was a good day. It could have been worse but it’s holding on strong :) hopefully next week will be better. Happy weekend!
Apple being taken out to the woodshed today ouch! Stay long stay strong

Do you think this might drop to 130 for the opening price?
Apple Amazon sitting on the most monstrous quarters in history. Better that they lay low until then. Maybe a downgrade next week to shake the tree.
"Well, I can understand the market being down today. Can you imagine all the large corporations that have been manipulating this country from day one. Do you think all the oil companies are happy about the president indicating he would like to go all EV in government vehicles. It’s going to be harder and harder under this president for special interest groups to continue buying politicians!!!!!"
"There you go, Apple finally broke through $135 and it stuck! Yay."
"WITH ZERO SELLERS ON THIS NEWS AND HIGH VOLUME BUYERS AND SHORTS DEVASTATED, AAPL CAN BE OVER 150 IN 2- 3 SESSIONS"
Aapl crushed it. Patience. The reward is coming.
Surprised people are still holding this stock $TWTR $FB $AMZN $AAPL at this time and at these prices.
"Apple is creating a buy-in point. Let history be your guidance, Apple always erupts 2-6 days after earnings. Patience folks and you will be rewarded."
Buffet is buying more.
"Good Morning everyone Wanted to share another technical analysis with you all. Rsi and Stoch have bottomed out. Apple is having huge volume and the short squeeze is green. Meaning we will have upside here. Little bit of sideways trading but for earnings, we will target 145. Post earnings it will continue to fly. Don’t miss out the ride over pennies and buy cheap now. I bought 40k shares myself."
After quarterly results apple normally goes up in 2 weeks etc
Apple will bounce tomorrow ! $145 by noon Bullish!
IF NASDAQ recovers tomorrow +200 then APPLE will see 150s! it depends on overall market.
Futures are in the green strong good indicator for some gains today now let’s keep them till the US session and climb higher!
"Numbers talk!Yesterday, pre-market, WE discussed how the Jan 29 $5 call spread between $135 and $130 was $4...20% risk. Yet AAPl was trading in low $150's at that time.WE concluded the markets were not convinced of a rally after earnings. Based on that observation, we did warn about options.Last night AAPL's low was $136."
"iPhone 12 Sales Soar in China to Close Out 2020The strong demand is expected to continue through Lunar New Year, which bodes well for Apple investors. Apple sold north of 18 million iPhones during Q4, a ""staggering"" number which would suggest that Apple took more than 20% market share to close out the year. A combination of pent up demand and a host of 5G models are likely driving the iPhone's robust sales. The momentum is expected to continue through China's Lunar New Year holiday on Feb. 12, which would give Apple another quarter of ""staggering"" sales similar to Q4."
Began reading posts this morning and 1 in 4 are purely political. I will be busy for awhile muting all political opinions. Opinions on AAPL stock are truly appreciated as this is an APPLE page. PS: 8:30 AM jobs report. AAPL will be up  at closing regardless if report is negative. Stay strong and long my AAPL friends and have a great weekend.
"the fact that this was first reported on CNBC, it reeks of misinformation"
we learned one lesson from all this frenzy. the stock market is 100% manipulated and good news or bad news have really little impact .no different from casino.
"buying opportunity, remember when the world's 5th richest man named apple his biggest competitor a day ago?"

"Entire market is up, and Apple, who’s doing great, is down. Am I missing something?"
CNBC just announced the Apple Car deal. Stock moving
"I think the market just wants to make a correction, no amount of blowout earnings are going to change that.That being said, MSFT and AAPL are good buys on a pull back."
Just showing some love to all my fellow apple longs! Good luck for tomorrow!!
Wont know until tomorrow 4pm where the share price settles.
Will not cross the 140 level today due to options. Next week!
"Margin accounts are Wall Street's way of denoting lending accounts.Scary Truth:If you have a margin account, AAPL shares in it are not yours. Yo don't own them. Your broker does. What you ""own"" is a promise from your broker that you will get paid when you sell the AAPL shares in your account.If your broker goes belly up, you are in trouble.Sell before the next broker run starts. (Every year or so, this has been happening.)"
2777 shares to be exact...so don't trash apple you have no idea what your talking about Giuseppe you have been trying over one hr
Anyone else sick and tired of this GameStop story manipulating the news?
"Main iPhone assembler Foxconn reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue thanks to robust demand for Apple Inc.’s new 5G devices.The Taiwanese company’s sales in December totaled NT$713.8 billion ($25.5 billion). Revenue in the quarter reached a record NT$2 trillion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations based on previously released monthly sales figures, beating the average estimate of NT$1.8 trillion.The strong showing from Apple’s most important production partner suggest demand for the U.S. giant’s latest devices may have surpassed initial expectations."
Lots of upgrades today
"It’s all good, in the upcoming weeks when all these stocks start pulling back, AAPL will be the unicorn climbing to new highs."
140 tomorrow
"Record $100 bill+ qtr and it drops 3% lmao wierd. I think its got more to do with Fed Chairman's comments yesterday and ppl just being cautious with Apple valuation and investing elsewhere, though the valuation seems more than justified!!"
"Humans have been on the planet for 200,000 years.It took until the year 1800 for the global population to reach 1 Billion people.In just 220 years after 1800, the global population is at 8 Billion....or an 8x increase.The global population has doubled , as recently as 1974, from 4 Billion to 8 Billion.I'm thinking it doubles again in maybe 20 years (??)...from 8 Billion to 16 Billion.Apple recently reported that there are 1.6 Billion active users of Apple products...that's 17% of the global population.If you think Apple is done growing, I think you're mistaken.Last quarter, Apple saw an increase of 30% in Japan and 50% increase in China.I think Apple is just getting started."
"AS ECONOMY OPENS UP, AAPL STORES WILL OPEN NEXT WEEK. STIMULUS CHECK TO BUY IPHONES AND IPADS AND MACS. CAR IS COMING. BUY BIG HERE BEFORE 180 IN MARCH"

What is your price prediction for today and for the end of the week
"I guess now that AAPL dropped a little, the general public will stop using their products."
come on. In at 136. Hope I don’t lose.
"The selling in shares like AAPL, AMZN, etc was liquidation to pay for the margin calls.There is still an outstanding debt of over 100 billion dollars that needs to be balanced.The short big boys got their heads lopped off.The real estate crisis we had was about 80 billion dollars. This will be more damaging and the effects will last far longer. Many of the players willnot exist in a few months. No bail outs this time."
Apple has sold the most call options today on the market for going up next week!
"As soon as AAPL call interest disappears, helped by today’s action, obviating need to manipulate its price, AAPL trends higher as usual ... institutions win both ways"
"Apple is not building a car, rather they're building the next platform for technology and services delivery -- their technology and services. That's the end game here. They always control the hardware for their products and the car is no different. They also don't focus on always having the best specs but rather the best overall experience. No doubt that this will be any different. It will be a great car but maybe not necessarily the best in terms of range and/or performance. But, that doesn't matter. Apple is focusing on the in-car experience -- especially once full autonomy becomes reality. Nobody else has a bench as deep as Apple when it comes to delivering that experience."
"This is a good buying opportunity, a strong support is being formed here following a dip after historical earnings. Plus apple took this opportunity to sell bonds and buy back shares. This I going to climb steadily from this point forward."
Apple ramping up stock buybacks. Another low interest bond sale for 14b. Buying back and retiring 300m in shares this quarter as opposed to the 200m last quarter.
"apple is solid long term, no doubt about it, apple will suffer now with rest of market as hedge funds are punished for destroying American jobs and current environment in Democrat strongholds. Join thecharge and make money in leader of 5G charge. NOK buy and hold if you haven't."
"Wells Fargo & Company is very positive to AAPL and gave it a ""Overweight"" rating on January 28, 2021. The price target was set to $155.00 → $160.00. Over the last 30 days, this security got 25 buy, 0 sell and 10 hold ratings."
Thumps up if this is a buying opportunity

I don't understand the huge swing in share price ??? was it just taking profit ?
This will continue until AAPL is allowed to buyback after the SEC blackout due to earnings
why in red ?
Another lackluster day for this Oinker stock Apple! Google reports good earnings yesterday and it goes up hundreds of points. Apple the oinker goes DOWN. I think it's time for me to begin divesting my 5000 shares of Apple...!
"To the people who argues that Nokia does not has enough short ratio to spark a rally like GME, I hope we can reason it out with some simple math:The market cap for GME is <1B. With a 80% short, the hedges get to make ~800M in the event that the stocks get utterly eviscerated. If share prices double, the hedges will lose 800M. This is what it means in dollar terms.Nokia might only have 10% shorts, but with a market cap of 23B, the hedges basically has a 2.4B bet - 3 times that of what they have on GME. TLDR: If the masses have our way, NOK will be more painful for the hedges than GME.Mpreover, there are mounting evidences that the funds are paying to attention to Nokia.(1) Recall the halt that happened 2 nights ago right after prices shot up to 9.79? Prices crashed immediately thereafter. It was obvious that certain circuit breaker measures were triggered by some large players. Measures to scare us off that is.(2) 1B volume traded in a single day and prices stay flat. It is obvious some big players were able to stagnate the prices with ladder trading. Likewise, scare tactics.(3) After hours crashes - only hedge funds can do after hours trade, so why the crash? It is obvious they don't want the price to rise and they are scaring us off with low volume dips.(4) Why was NOK singled out alone with other reddit stocks for a ban if the hedges were not concerned?Hold your lines guys. We are on the verge of victory."
I think market be volatile until new government sworn in that is Jan 20th and positive outlook for Q1 earnings (Jan 27th) will keep $aapl stock start attracting big guys. So we could expect upside from Jan 20th.
"I don’t care what anyone says, apple will be 200$ a share by the end of this year. you decide what you do from now til then, but don’t be surprised when it happens."

Tailwinds: Stimulus Vaccines Overall market growth Phenomenal earnings Apple stock:Still down after recent highsNow we have an apple CAR ?? This should be the catalyst needed to drive this back to the ath and beyond ... congrats everyone
Some arguments here -It’s a cyber security company and market cap is so low compared to others. It has an intelligent vehicle platform which it plans to enhance using AWS. Then why is the revenue going down sequentially compared to OKTA and CRWD which have astronomical growth. Something is not adding up. The CFO also dumped all his shares.I am long but I have my doubts.
Great day guys and girls! Get yourself a whisky and have a great weekend!
"Good TSMC earning bodes well for AAPL, I am looking forward to this quarter's earning."
Hey amazing traders. Stop crying. This was $106-110 after split briefly not that long ago.
Apple is nearing $2.5 trillion market cap. Trailing is Microsoft half a trillion behind. AAPL long the beautiful journey continues. Stay long and celebrate.
How is Apple down leading into their earning smh and somehow Tesla just gain and gains for literally no reason. Getting a bad feeling that Apple is going to report a historic quarter but the SP wont do much

"When the iPhone 11, in 2019, AAPL was trading at $217.73. Two months later, the stock was selling for a 21% more. A year after the 1st iPad was released, price was up over 42%.When AAPL runs, it runs fast and hard."
"""Tell them about the car again"" Yea. Yea, that's the ticket !"

"V good progress today! GG longs, let’s hope tomorrow we can push 140"
We can realistically see 150 tomorrow
That didn’t last ...apple gets no love
Tomorrow.
"History is often a view into what is to come.Before earnings, it was posted many times that once in the past AAPL had great earnings yet because retail was heavily invested in call options the; markets took the stock down. Okay, this has happened.However, markets rallied the stock the following week. If so, this week should be a good one for the longs. Let's see if this happens. Good LuckMany puts were sold on Friday. This is also a good sign of a rally. But nothing is definiteEvery coin has two sides."
"Can you imagine back in 1980 when apple stock went public at 22.00, putting 50,000.00 into the stock and keeping it there for 41 years? I could not even dream of what that would be worth today. A few million i would think."

Remember that Apple is just 3 months into a 2 year SuperCycle. $200 is not out of the question in 2021.

I own stock in one of the biggest most profitable companies in the world. Not worried.
The $AMC $GME profits will come to a safe AAPL soon. This will spike to $170!
I wanna make money but I don’t want gas cars to go away.... I hope we could save gas cars. I will not drive electric.
"AAPl's nature is ""V""s with new highs.The pivot varies depending on many factorsAs posted early this am, anyone needking cash use the Da Vinci Strategy.Anyone who wants to buy more...wait! If this continues we will use the Van Gough Strategy"
how big is $100 billion quarter?
today is ex dividend right ?
Bad timing. The hedge fund guys probably sold their apple shares to make up for the lost causing apple to drop. We should trickle back up with no problems.
Thinking of making my next desktop computer an Apple branded one. Anyone have one and make recommendations either for or against?My main usage would be to create gaming projects using the Unreal Engine.
I'm surprised that this Oinker of a stock was able to keep its gain for the day! It'll probably give it all back tomorrow and go down 5 points.
Probably seen a lot of late buying this afternoon heading in ER.
With the surplus of cash in the economy and diminishing returns of bank interest rates money will continue to rotate into the market. Apples prospects make it a safe haven for this money - $140 imminent.
"With AAPL we have all the time in the world, daily drops mean discount before more new high, learned a lot from decade investors here who testified to hold."
LG Electronics just reported earnings. They had their best sales for displays to Apple since 2017. This may give a positive sign to Apple's earnings report coming up.
"The company reported $64.7 billion for the quarter, the best of the 2020 calendar year. Since then, however, the iPhone 12 has been released, and sales are surging. The company has announced in recent weeks that it plans to increase the production of the iPhone 12 by 20% to 30% to meet the increased demand for the iPhone line.

Dow down 500 and aapl is down $5 . Market is up 500 and us a little more than a dollar.Earnings were sensational and they are buying shares down here to help get us over 150 soon.
"Bought 200 shares last Tuesday at $127.50. Sold today for $143.15. Not a bad profit for 6 days. I might be leaving money on the table, but such is life."
out of curiosity does everyone here know that they are investing in a company which had to put suicide nets into its factories?Is everyone cool with that? Let's continue then...
I am confident that AAPL will be $180 by end of the year......
"No am dip and this runs $4+, as I posted all week to deaf ears"
Now the long climb back up: price action reflected by selling is tough on Apple today. Stay long stay strong 
Let me add if the market was down where would apple be $125.????? Everything is green.
Apple will make quality and real luxury cars. It does not matter who makes cars for them going to be Apple specifications with the best quality. It is going to be a full-blown Apple computer on four wheels.
Anyone selling here has a deep aversion to making money. You buy here. Eleven months from today the stock will be up 100%. IMHO 
"Money, money, money, money, money!"
Tesla cars are made by Tesla!Apple cars are made by Kia!
Looking for two things on Wednesday. Blow out earnings and positive guidance. We sail if those two things happen
I’m an AAPL stock holder. I strongly suggest that AAPL remain an electronics company and leave political and social media to others.
Note to all the pessimistic doubters: Long term AAPL has been a winner year after year. A bump here and there is totally expected as long as the stock recovers quickly and AAPL has done so. So far for me AAPL has been profitable and I am confident it will continue to do so. For my wife and I AAPL has been a positive venture and we both are long with confidence. 
This is what happens....when Apple is struggling we see a lot of bashers...like a lot of them...we don’t go way.. we vent out.. but we still stick...how about these bashers? Where are they today?? Haha
Ouch... Up $3.00 after hours. That sure caused the shorts to come out in record numbers to bash Apple on the forum. Do they really think they can change a few people minds To sell? Your posts here will have NO effect on Apple stock price. You would be better off laying in bed and praying for a price drop tomorrow....

Apple is America!
Its absolutely hilarious that the markets have to go up 100 points before Apple can gain a penny....
This year will be the best year for apple. Look at the first Q. Look back at the numbers of 2018. There is the answer.
Obvious by now the holders of 5 billion AAPL shares can do whatever they want to the price without investigation. Only consolation is that they must allow it to go up at some point this year to retain their fund customers.
There is a reason Intel let Apple walk with their chips. Intle knew a chip squeeze was coming and they could back fill the demand from Apple with higher margin product mix.

big green day for today wait
Question: where will you be when Apple  hits $150? It’s not far away!
When I look up I see something so delicious I see $400 for Apple by December 2021. The problem is the shorts haven’t had any thing delicious in a long time

"AAPL will hit $200.00 after earning, for sure!"
Short term pain action But stay long!
I can feel it......coming back again
RELAX PEOPLE! THE MARKET IS JITTERED AND IS LOOKING FOR A CORRECTION! BUT NOT TODAY FOR APPLE!
I am not even worried about Apple. Because I accumulated a lot of shares through splits that even in a down day I do not care. I am still up regardless!
"Time to buy some $AMC is now, not going to get a better price after open. Cheers."
Remember 30 July was earnings and price up 10 dollars. I thought now will the same. Hopefully Apple will recover and this year we close more then 200 per share.
"Think of the products Apple will release even before the car? New iPhones, pads, watches, and yes the glasses."
Wow hedge fund shorts are panicking!!...big boy heavyweights getting pummeled by middle weights....amazing!! GameStop and AMC etc..
We missed out last peak 136! We don’t want to miss 142 to lock up the profit before the exit door is too full to escape!
Hope y’all bought the dip won’t see 130 for awhile if ever
What are our thoughts on a Friday sell off? I don't think I'm selling till April.

Look at the fed at 1 pm if markets rebound Apple will close at 148-150 Pop will be in high 170s
The numbers are just too spectacular...we rally tomorrow....this stock is way undervalued
AAPL shorts will have to pay the dividend coming up.
24% run up in the past quarter and most don't think that was already baked into todays earnings and closing price????
"When taking into account my entire family and all of our clients, we have made over $10 million dollars off AAPL alone. That's why I have zero tolerance for shorts on this name...when you make money like that it's game over. Shorts will never see money like that, not even close. The best they can hope for is pocket change, at worst homelessness. If AAPL were the only stock you ever owned and you owned enough at a cheap enough price, you could hang up your business suit and retire to Florida. Vs. being short you could be forced to fly a sign at a highway exit. You have to decide which sounds better: retirement or begging for money. The answer to anyone with a brain is obvious."
"I don't make price predictions, but I will make this prediction: if you are trading based on emotion, you are going to lose. And the greater emotion plays into your trading decisions, to more you are going to lose.If you want to make money in this game, you better be thinking and not feeling."

Turning green soon. Up big time tomorrow and the whole week. Close to 90% companies beat expectations. Economy opening up. Vaccines on target. Stimulus on its way. Businesses opening up. Hiring is and will pick up. What more do you want you negativity spreading doom and gloom people
Apple best company on market will exceed 200 in no time this bubble is real and it’s not because of stocks like amazon or Facebook or Apple it’s because of the small cap stocks that people are making into mid caps that don’t post any number that come even close to being worth it
"I bought At 137.08 after hours, I wasted to buy 136 even but it never reached. Now I am buying at breakout of $1 dollar. My next buy order is 138 and 139. I know AAPL will gap-up in premarket above 150. Ive seen in classic pattern after a robust earnings. Shorties will cover desperately eventually. Watch and learn"
"If you're not buying the AAPL dip I guess you don't care about making money. That was the best quarter in the history of the Iphone and they still took AAPL down. This quarter is proving to be much like last quarter...the good quarters are being punished as if they were bad. And of course the GME short squeeze has a stranglehold on real winners such as this name. The market is long overdue for a sanity check in the bubble names like GME, AMC, BBBY, NOK, etc. AAPL will be bought back once the dust settles and the shorts who think they are winning right now will be smoked. AAPL is real gold. GME is bricks that are painted gold."
"I can see the future of quick oil change places will go out of business with EV cars coming. No oil leaks, water pumps breaking, anti freeze. Lots of changes."

If you're a true American and you love this country and your freedom....You'll sell your stocks now and go into cash....get out of the way of the dictatorship that's coming.
Thank God I have Amazon & Tesla and the other stocks in my portfolio to carry the burden because this Oinker of a stock Apple sure as heck isn't doing it!

"With the release of strong earnings, I have added Apple to my portfolio. Any price under $130 deserves incremental share purchases, with a 12 month target of $160."
APPL WILL NOT LET US DOWN.STAY STRONG BROTHERS
I just bought after hours. Co-workers told me about AAPL beating earnings . I agree with them AAPL will break 150 tomorrow or Monday. Tomorrow I will buy at the opening if i see any pullback. I want to accumulate more if drops. Electric car will send quickly than tesla. Price will surpass 200 breakout quickly. Price will correct soon due to revenues as of today.

165-170 friday I’ve been with Apple and this is the best earnings ever from Morgan Stanley
"Many big pensions invested in Apple, they know what is ahead! Don’t let all the negativity getYou down all you new investors, just believe in the process!!! Apple will smash earnings in 10 days, GUARANTEED!!!"
"Looking very healthy pre market Apple people ! Healthy technicals, great news and a bright future !"
Apple deserves a lofty valuation because1. Rates are very low 2. If Apple can build their own microchips ... don’t you think they also leverage low cost debt and do spectacularly3. Phone shipping boxes are smaller ie lower shipping costs4. Loyal customer base 5. Excellent & unbelievable customer service!6. Apple one! combining services is huge!7. The recent upgrade is so hotly in demand that Apple had to ramp up production!8. Continually positively surprises me on the daily! 9. Wonderful “systems” 10. Apple will surely find new things to try! Apple car? Apple VR? Apple Airplane? Theres really no limits and they do it right ie quality and price every time11. The iPhone mini... people are underestimating how popular a powerful & low cost phone is throughout the world!Keep it up Apple! Great Job 
"IMO, if you have money in the bank ,move it ALL in AAPL.Who agrees?"
Thank You Apple - It is RIGHT that facebook must ask if they can track users for AD purposes and what ever else the do... Please implement the change Very SOON...
iPhone sales SMASH expectations!!!! CHOOOO CHOOOOOOO!!!! All aboard!!!!
How about the the CookCoin ?It went public and is going to a billion after lunch.
Alert. Aapl closes over 140 tomorrow. Trade accordingly. Thx
Apple Car!!! Breaking news!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRuLtyIEBDA
To everyone asking how this could go down after great earnings. That's not entirely true. Apple went up big time in the week heading into earnings. The institutions new apple would have a blowout quarter and they bought big time heading into earnings. That's how it always happens. If everyone started buying once the earnings were out and there was confirmation then investing and trading would be a joke...and easy. Simple as that. Stocks go up into earnings when the outcome is still unclear and the risk/reward is much higher.
Should I be worried that the short term and mid-term performance outlook are down and the long term outlook is mid?
If this isn’t even a little green the last two days I’m getting g rid of the rest of my Apple. Sold the first half at $131 months ago and we are just about there again...
"Apple is just not the same, can't even hold during Premarket... Hopefully we can get $3 in AH/premarket, I doubt it though."
"I’m in $TMO, $SDC, $CNK, $AAPL, $CCL, $RCL, and $DAL... it’s all about the opening up... no reason any of these can’t reach 100 week highs and AAPL and TMO just keep on cranking HIGHER in the meantime!!!"
"Are they going to call it ""I-Kia"" and confuse with ""Ikea"""
"Today over 150. And after reporting, hit 160"
This is #$%$. Excellent earnings and stock down and wall street croonies say they don't manipulate market. Come on now.
"Even AMZN with some bad news that CEO Bezos is stepping down, at first AH went Red then reversed and trading over 62. I am more than certain that AAPL is going to kept depressed until Mr. COOK utters the word ""iCar""."
"I made hundreds of thousands in sneezing hedge funds, if not squeezes, this going no where,,I am out for now good luck vary longs.."
MSFT rallied this morning right into end of day for their earnings report. Tomorrow lets see AAPL do the same. Good Luck
Go Apple! 
"Problem for Tesla is......they have loyal followers,but Kia/ Hyundai has way more over 10.3 million cars sold worldwide last year,and growing.Ask a owner,great value and satisfaction google it."
Someone tell me why we didn’t climb like AMZN and GOOG stocks are?????
"Apple should use it's wealth to short Tesla, then just buy it outright for $5 per share."
AS COVID HOSPITALIZATIONS DECREASE AND VACCINE ROLL OUT AND GAMESTOP BUBBLE BURST. AAPL CAN JUMP 10 -12 POINTS
"Hedge fund short squeeze/covering/margin calls/long position liquidation giving opportunity for Apple to pursue share buybacks at lower share prices? If so, should AAPL longs thank those Hedge Funds?"
"Update: CNBC reported Mary Huberty of Morgan Stanley as one of the most influential Wall Street analyst and although her Upgrade is $152, her Bull case is actually $200... which aligns with Loup Venture Gene Munster's price target which is also $200. Good Luck"
Who else here has 2000 shares or more? I bought from $107 until $129. Finally have 2319 shares. Holding for at least 5-10 years. Can’t wait for the next split. That’s why I’m not upset with price action. GO APPLE  longs
Agreed. Once the numbers fully digested and analyst upgrades and PT increases tomorrow we rally to 150 quickly
Apple 135 by 20th based on technical analysis and over 150 by earnings. Load up now.
126 to 142 .... already
Couldn't find a luxury brand to partner with??
I have a feeling price is set in already
Shorts today is your final day to pay... If not then Tomorrow U r going to lose your houses!!
"Just muted more political opinions. Hello, anyone interested in AAPL news?"
FB beat top and bottom and down AH due to increase in expenses outlook. TSLA missed EPS and way down. AAPL should show everyone how it's done.
Who's shorting Apple? I thought shorts argued before Congress that shorting provided economic benefits to stocks and kept their valuations in line. Apple earns more money than any company in history and the shorts are all over it. Why? Shorting Apple provides zero economic benefit and only hurts retirees who may need their money sooner. Time to outlaw shorting. Also time to regulate hedge funds. Why do they get a pass on regulation? They own politicians. Maybe the Wall street short killers should break the shorts in Apple.
Investing in Apple has been like winning the lottery once a year for 19 out of the last 20 years (2008 was a rough one).
There has bee days when Nasdaq is red all day....but Apple is green.
"Rough article in business insider, sounds like Hyundai is getting cold feet. Maybe Apple might be making cars with Kia? Not sounding good. Any thoughts?"
Except for one shoe manufacturer all you declared their quarter this morning beat estimates. About 80% beat by a wide wide wide margin. It’s like hitting across the park never to see the ball again . Market set to rocket to the sky . Job numbers coming out at 8:30 eastern time. People are being called back to work and more and more jobs being created
"I always look at week to week performance of any company's share price. Can't wait to get the Sunday paper and look at my various holdings such as Apple, nvidia, Microsoft etc etc"
"When fully autonomous vehicles become a practical reality, it will forever change the way we look at the car. The car is the next platform and Apple knows it. They want to control it, not just build an operating system for it. Instead of driving, the ""driver"" will be free to consume media of all sorts and that is square in Apple's wheelhouse for the build out of its services and media offerings. This is definitely Apple's long-game -- not to just compete in the EV market for the sake of building another EV. Just IMO, of course."
The problem continues to be not making hay on solidly green markets. Throw in a red market day and this will be down $3 plus. It’s gotta stop.
"When market sentiment is bad, the best company in the world does not move, amazing! that said, we will get to $160 sooner than later! Con call and forecast is going to be very important."
"An opinion and a question. I own 300 shares of AAPL that I bought at $115.00.....just to see if I could make a ""few bucks"" on it. I've been watching it for 3 or 4 months now and if dumped it today I'd pocket around 6K.With earnings coming out next week and all of the chatter about the stock going up I'm wondering if it would be smart to sell around 50 shares now (or before Wednesday) to pocket my gains, put an order in to sell it all at some given price...maybe 120 or 125 or just let it ride. The problem is that every time Apple announces earnings the stock goes up and THEN it takes a dive. This particular earnings report is somewhat special because of the new line of IPhones......but that doesn't happen every year. I like to have money in my hands...not just watch it on paper. The dividend from Apple is a joke.....unless you own enough. I have a lot of money invested in closed end funds that pay anywhere from 6 to 11 % and THAT'S where I make money. The .82 that AAPL pays is not exactly my cup of tea. I'm not in the ""market"" for the future......I'm in for right now.....I'm not a kid any more. ANY AND ALL comments would be greatly appreciated"
"Rob Arnott, founder and CEO of giant investment advisor Research Affiliates, his funds is north of $145B spoke today regarding Tesla and Apple stocks. Read his analysis posted in Yahoo finance""Tesla stock is a prime example of a bubble: Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott""""Apple stock is not a bubble: Wall Street power playerResearch Affiliates' Rob Arnott""And here we are - even with the bullish calls by Rob Arnott (and he is a wizard on WS), Apple barely stayed in the green up .64; whereas Tesla is up 18.39. If this doesn't show us the disconnection then I don't know what else can prove it."
"Still holding on to a 1/29 130 call, should I hold STILL? I don’t want to be caught in the after ER sell off, but the upside is definitely there."
I think we should book profits tomorrow. Post earnings you never know what’s coming
"Stock market is becoming a joke. Company A reports actual earnings, stock goes down. Company B losing millions, stock surges like crazy. What a mess with all the manipulation out there."
Shift to cash....This is not going to be an easy fix....Short sellers have to sell good stocks at the end...The only solution to this is to STOP short selling totally....That has been the money cow and now tables have turned 
It’s rising
What is my quarterly dividend amount on 40 shares $8 wow

One more thing. Apple car

"SLV is the next GME, not AMC, not BlackBerry, not crypto, but SLV. Silver is a hard asset all crowds believe in and all this loss in the market has to be hedged against something, and SLV has a massive short squeeze on the way."
"Kia is the Perfect partner. Let Tesla fight it out with Mercedes and BMW Audi and Lexus and their ilk. Because that’s what’s coming down the road. Apple/Kia will be an every man’s car made in a total robotic factory. Kia builds a first class economic car. Apple will eventually spit out 400,000 cars in Georgia. PLUS the same in other plants around the world as they get going. The genie is out of the bottle. And if Tesla thinks they have a loyal following. What do you think Apple has! Hehe "
"As an employee at AAPL, we get to use up to 10% of our base salary to buy company shares at 15% discount of price since July 2020. That is a approximately 50% gains ;)"

WE tried to rally to $144+; we failed.TOmorrow is always another day

"Personally, I’m not too thrilled about Apple going in the car business. Historically automobile manufacturing is very low profit. I hope Apple knows what they’re getting into."
AAPL and MSFT made tons of money before and during the pandemic and will keep making tons of money after the pandemic. Stick with the best is my advice
A lot of volume in apple 
WHAT DOES POLITICS HAVE 2 DO WITH APPLE STOCK???
"Last quarter, Apple posted net quarterly profit of $28.8 billion. That's $3.703 profit per second... each second..."
Now TSLA should make smart phones .
"Reason to stay long. Up days on no news. Manipulated now with fantastic earnings.... don’t bail , wait, even a few weeks"
Another cash flow option trick rather than buy now?Sell a Jan 22 put for $20+ a share. But WE will wait if this nonsense continues.The trick is to always take what the markets offer. Never try to muscle stocks
Going to $190z do not sell
Some joker said Apple was down after hours. So I looked up and it is down 9 cents . That’s down? I then did an experiment. I took my big back side up from my sofa and looked around for pennies and guess what I found 17 cents. I need at least 50 cents to buy a bag of chips. So 9 cents is immaterial and carries no weight or bearings but the little rabbit  who reported Apple bring down after hours caused me some anxiety which was utterly unfounded
"Apple Fun Fact: At the beginning of the 6+ SuperCycle, Apple stock was at about $400 per share. Split adjusted, Apple stock is $4,000 per share today........3 months into the 12 Phone SuperCycle. Apple has been very good for the Longs, and very Cruel for the Shorts. Tim Cook has been Apple’s CEO the entire time. Apple is 3 months into the second 2 year SuperCycle........$200 per share is not just doable, it’s probable."
"Today's activity was traders and weak hands selling in anticipation of Tuesday's election results. I'm not here to choose sides. Who cares if the capital gains rate will increase? Not me I'm holding long term. That's where longs have an advantage. I'm buying the dips this week. Go long and don't pay attention to the noise. Set your goals, have an open mindset, and you can sleep easy at night."
A very simple rule of thumb and an enjoyable exercise. On a by-weekly chart you will find that AAPL gains will out pace losses on a 70-30% bases on average. So stay long relax enjoy the ride and enjoy and appreciate your profits with peace of mind.
Bloomberg reporting Apple investing in Kia
Is it worth buying at this dip?

AAPL is an incredible engine for price gains if you're a long-term investor. It has lots of work to do to continue the miraculous growth. Services have to be big. Apple Pay and TV need to get moving. I'm not sure where AAPL is on a car, but I think something big is coming. Although the price is getting very high, I'm banking on Cook and Company to keep new products and innovation coming."
"My estimates for APPLE - Revenue 105 B - 115 B, Earning 1.50 -1.60 and strong guidance for iphones, macs, wearables, and services."
Sleepy Joe policies really setting the market on fire!
I checked the price after hours and see a trade at 143.50 around 5pm EST. Does anyone else also see that?
"Apple will make the Apple car a subscription based service so you do not have to buy the car outright you simply pay a monthly fee for its use As I have said many times , Apple only gets into markets they can disrupt the the current business model and provide a more attractive product or service to their consumers. That is the their expertise that has been very successful as we all know."
Advanced Modigliani technical analysis indicates apple will go through 140 for a 146 short term target
Relax everyone. This will hit 147-150 within a few weeks. Lots of profit taking today from everyone who bought prior to earnings.
Daniel Ives raises AAPL to $175.
"The three rules of off Apple stock: Buy Apple stock, never sell no matter what happens, repeat."
I just found a sure fire way to keep Apple shares above $142. I went and put in a buy limit order for some Apple shares at $142. You know the Karma Gods conspire against you whenever you have a buy limit order pending. The shares you're looking to buy will never go down to the price that you want to buy at...!
So how good are earnings going to be with this new Iphone out? We've had a lot of closures of the apple stores over the past couple of months.. what effects does that have on the earnings?
"I do not understand what is so hard to understand about this. Today is options day. This Earnings disaster caused a lot of them to expire absolutely worthless. Offcourse the stock is down! Wait for Monday. Market is going to take a dive especially SBUX and NKE. However, people who profited from them, will re-invest on AAPL. $150 by next Friday!"
"Lol a PE ratio of 37, way too cheap for this growth stock."
The chart looks good for tomorrow
Does this thing ever go up
Once AAPL hits the 150 and 160 target by analyst they will have to upgrade to 200 like Munster already did.
"Reddit no nothings think they can sell today and still get the divi. You have to hold till Monday, ex divi date."
Yes futures recovering nicely. Apple in green tomorrow after initial sell off profit taking
This is a gift as I bought today at $131 and will ride this up and up. I like to see days like this so I can add to my very long position and just smile as the $ come rolling in. As time goes forward so does the Apple share price. If it drops again on Monday I will buy more. Apple is the closest thing to being a long term sure thing than there is in the market for the past 10 years.
Don’t sleep on apple + tv growth. Production starts big post covid. Watch out Netflix Apple car autonomous = apple Uber service
This is complete and utter horse$hit. Where’s the $160 everybody was screaming a week ago?
$AAPL $500 by end of the year and then split
Longs here to
After these numbers can’t wait to add to my position tomorrow. Need to act in the morning because will be green by end of day.
Appears to be several catalysts to drive this thing higher- yet totally underperforming- of late.. concerning..
Market opened higher Apple is down but the day just started by end of the day it will be sharply higher. Anybody who thinks Apple is not a strong buy must either be from a different planet or a person with no balance and a financial thought process .
Looos like the rest of red stocks come back to lifetime for apple now
"Looks like it’s up to Facebook, Tesla and Apple to save this market."
"to the shorts, all I can say is, we still up $5 from 5 days ago!"
"After expiration, we could see a lil pop, Monday. Suspect 140 as new support level."
Apple stocks haven't risen since 1st of September. 5 months with no increase whatsoever.. I think it's about time to start again. Can't be like that forever.
"iPhone maker Apple on Wednesday reported App Store sales of $1.8 billion for the recently concluded holiday season with New Year's Day accounting for 30% of the spending.Cramer said Apple's statements that came out this morning indicate they are going to have very strong service revenues. ""Apple is a buy because it's down right now and it has customers. Themes like work from anywhere, digitization and healthcare make me want to buy Apple even more.”"
Breaking News on CNBC: Apple nears deal with Hyundai-Kai!!
RUMP WALKED BY THE COMPANY AND THE STOCK SOLD OFF
"After Apple's report earnings a share price approx. $160+ will confirm the 5G and pent up demand evolving and existing in its current supercycle. Furthermore, the appears to be plenty of GameStop earnings to float to Apple becoming a more solid investment for those in the know."
Earning report tommorow will be green?
"Good news or bad news, also good earnings or bad earnings... Apple is always red "
Holding my 426 shares and need to get 74 more shares on the next dip!
"relax people, hold till 2025 you all will be rich and look back and say I am glad I did !!!"
"Ever major investment broker wants to scoop up all your cheap shares before earnings, it’s a shame a lot of people are falling for the trick. I am shocked to know people are selling because they panic. Earnings is coming up  and l am sure it will bring it up to the newest high. Be patience. U can express your frustration. But to sell?"
Ex-Dividend date today - hope you have your shares registered!! Just another nice day for an Apple Dividend
if this ends green i will donate 10$ to my local homeless person
This will be a record high earnings in apples history! Prepare for takeoff!
Ok so now all big tech reported short term trading is over now back to the trend higher
Hyundai gets all the capital costs and Apple gets all the profits. The Apple way.
CNBC announced Apple deal approved
Can’t believe Apple isn’t over $150 after hours
see everyone at 150 soon
I just bought few now for the first time. Was it a wrong time to enter? Considering we have earnings reports coming up tomorrow I guess?
Does AAPL report earnings after hours or first thing in the morning?
You gotta buy with all uou can...Apple will be over $200 before we know it!!!
You might be right. Robinhood is stopping sales of GameStop for the safety of the company.
Its simple buy several weeks before the earnings release then sale right before the earnings release then buy again the dip after earnings release then sale again at new highs.
Wouldn't drive a rotten Apple KIA car if it was free with iPhone.
"I see a lot of Hyundai and Kias around where I live. I could see an Apple car doing well, and taking a portion of the market. Interestingly, I think this news means even more potential shortages of chips for these vehicles as manufacturing can't keep up."
A pullback + great earnings + Apple car = at least 140 tomorrow
"CASE IN POINT--------->> Bloomberg: ""Apple Inc. will invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors Corp. as part of a collaboration with the South Korean carmaker on making electric vehicles, the DongA Ilbo newspaper reported, without citing anyone."""
Now it’s time to turn our attention to the Apple Car!!
"Just bought more Apple but also bought more Fidelity Blue Chip Growth with Apple as a major holding, Fidelity Semiconductors with Nvidia as a major holding, Fidelity Growth Company (closed to new investors? But they redirect you to other compatible Fund). God be my witness I lead a no stress or less stress life in terms of my portfolio and investment life"
time to chuck it higher. keeping above 130 is key here peops and faang is back today.
Well who cares anyway. I'm going to own this stock for 40 more years. Glad unlike you people I have a good job and i'm not dependent of stock volatility
Typical Robinhooder trying to process what happened
"Biden isn't going to do anything to upset the markets in the first 100 or so days....guaranteed...even Paulsen says 2021 will be all bullish, then 2022-2024 are going to be the worry"
"Almost 20% higher er than analysts consensus, great job apple "
"Apple will be at $200 by the end of this year... if not higher. Apple will have it best year in 2021 and I see 2022 just as good. Once the hedge funds finish licking their GME wounds, they will buy heavily into Apple. Most of their clients will be looking for a secure sure thing for the next couple of years. In 5 years Apple could be close to $500 or more."
"Retail traders, DO NOT SELL after hours. Apple has shown to rise and Clío after hours but then rise further the next day. AAPL is the market. This is America!"
Just in case if y'all wondering where is the next level?
Do we think we will see a dip or rise when Qtr earnings are released next week?
Half a day of trading was gone and it is still going down. Waiting patiently for the earnings report. Can we see 140?
Some strong selling today keeping the price down. Wonder who is selling and why? I would imagine for diversification. But The Who question remains unless hedge funds maybe to cover certain shorts. Stay long stay strong 
Apple Car Coming Soon!!
"TSLA=The new AAPL. AAPL is an amazing company, but how/Why Did Tim Cool pass on TSLA?"
Can someone explain the earnings report situation to me? Sry still very new to investing.Some people are saying it will dip back down and other are saying it will skyrocket. I'm confused
I have my share since 2009 bought it 108$ before 7 and 4 splitsDont sell keep it long
Calm down folks it’s just a little profit taking ... wait until the upgrades... they have got to be coming... solid company with solid earnings
"Where do gift cards show up in Apple's consolidated balance sheet? As ""deferred revenue?"""
Apple had an amazing quarter! The best ever in history among any smart phone. The eye-opener in this earnings report is that the Apple stores weren’t open because of the pandemic. Imagine if the stores were open and how many more phones they would’ve sold. Unbelievable report. The stock will definitely double this year.
People get so excited over a little correction in the market relax everyone it will all be fine .
Major cover by the shorts on the last trading day of the month and the market will rocket to the sky.
The call options from $140 - $155 have a 10-1 ratio to puts for this week. I wonder what will happen on Thursday?
Higher highs tomorrow and then Wednesday. What a great time to be an apple long term investor
"Pay attention to Microsoft after hours action tomorrow. If it’s sell the news, Apple will probably do the same. If it goes higher after hours, Apple will probably go higher Wednesday after hours also"
"bought 40 shares @128$, will this ever see 150$?"
Doubt they'd do something this big if they didn't have it mapped out for positive growth. Not their style to shoot from the hip.
Apple is not a Blue Chip stock anymore. It's an OINKER stock now!
"For everyone who says Apple doesn’t innovate, electric vehicles limited risk and huge rewards, can’t wait to see some of their ideas"
"Fantastic Day from Apple. Really driving up the price at the end. Investors throwing money at the Apple Car, All wanting to be taken fir a spin "
You guys know what to do when there is fear in the market.. act and buy.. don’t miss it again
Apple  could pull a GameStop
"This is funny!Someone just sold 1,600 Jan 22 $60 puts for $1....Keep $160,000 or must buy AAPL at $59"
I think today is our last chance to buy more. We wont be seeing this again for a while.
Price Target 170
"Kids in your 20’s early 30’s try to accumulate 200 to 300 shares. Keep it, when you are 55 will be sitting pretty."
"Everyone knows this is under priced after that amazing earnings report, I’m buying more"
"Whammo here it is just outApple (AAPL) will invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) to build the Apple car at a Kia facility in Georgia, Bloomberg said, citing a DongA Ilbo report."
Hows that record ER feeling? Nothing criminal here
Time to get to work lads!
"What’s the average annual return of Apple shares. I’m looking at starting to invest in either Apple or an etf like ARKK. Just wanted some input, I read on google that it was like 42% average annually for the last ten years ? Still new to stocks and what not . Thanks !"
"Someone said February 2nd is on a Monday and the market would jump and so would AAPL. xdiv end of week __buy, large swing this week"
And we have 3 full days of trading before earnings $. This is more exciting that being a kid on Xmas morning
Aapl I don’t get it. Spectacular ER and stock is down when it should be up at least 5% with the market
"When bar is high, expectation is high! No matter how strong the result, it only means the successful past and the peak! It’s over the hill from here! HUAWEI is replacing AAPL in ️️️️"
"Yep, definitelyyyyy some totally legit and reasonable price action were seeing, what a great market..."
"Look at the six month chart, Apple is due for a breakout soon"
Why after the dill with kia the stock is still red ?
I seriously hope aapl does a buy back. Too many outstanding shares.
OMG this is gonna b me tonight and at work tomorow
Just found the article on Appl threatening free speech Parler. As a result as a long term shareholder i just sold my entire position after hrs and will never own again. C
I'm doing lots of DD tonight on the EV game. I'm a valid investor not an EV expert. I have a family member telling me to sell my Tesla shares and load up on Apple...... he works at Kia in PA..... any insight that anyone has...??
"AAPL is arguably the safest, valuable stock on the market. No need to panic over this."
"It's nice to see the Apple shares in my portfolio shoulder the burden for once. Ever since the split last August, my Tesla shares have had to shoulder the burden for providing capital gains for my portfolio. My Apple & Amazon shares have been in hibernation for 5 freaking months!"
"Almost a perfect ""V"" today. I guess algorithm players needed to reload?Intra am high was $134.77 then a $3.30 dip to $131.40 but then almost a $4 rally to $135,47.Tomorrow IF there is no dip AAPL could rally $4+ as was suggested pre-market today.No harm but WE posted ""No am dip."" WE need to do better! Algorithim players did well and stock closed up $2.18"
When they paying dividends? And how much? Own 1600 shares
Oh my God Amazon earnings $14.09 per share vs. forecast of $7.23 by Refinitiv. Revenue $125.56 billions vs. $119.7 billions as forecast by Refinitiv . All quarterly information
AAPL historical all-time top put in last week. It's all downhill from here. Congratulations to all profiteers who took a dump over $140.
"WHAT STRENGHT, 150$ next week here we go ladies and gents, the apple show"
Today?Algorithim players put money in everyone's pockets.
Wow what a buying opportunity that was! New support base validated!
"Prepare for a historically massive boost to the economic recovery when Congress finishes this work,"
I don't think that market can continue to rise at those levels with the reddit thing running in the background. We need a resolution on this.
It’s hard to understand the logic of these AH sellers given the stellar results for Q1 by Apple across all performance benchmarks.
Nope the hfms won’t let Apple up past 135. They have it pinned so when the market drops again it will tank hard. Just normalManipulation For This stock. Just buy the dips.
"IDC predicts that in 2021, Apple AR glasses will trigger an explosion in the industry, and light and thin VR headsets will become the mainstream. $WIMI"
Who’s buying a Apple car........I AM ..........brilliant move can’t wait.........
Don't understand how the whole market can dump 25% in the span of 10 minutes. How is it even possible to coordinate that?
"So APPL reports a quarterly beat of $111B in sales, which happens to be exactly TWICE what GOOG just reported, and GOOG is rewarded with a 7.3% stock jump and now higher PE ratio, and APPL gets punished??"
Oh God! Here it goes. The stock is going down and losing all of yesterday's gains.
RUN SHORTIE RUN
Once the BIG BOYS are done accumulating today...this will turn GREEN!!
Looks like the green new deal is being administered through executive orders and kick back Joe just keeps blindly signing away our economy and freedom.
"Ok, when was the last time Apple stock got smashed after quarterly results?"
Anyone appreciates me? I told you to buy aggressively ... two days
Hang in there guys! Red days are followed by green days!! Stay strong!
Pfizer says only 30% of Americans need to get vaccinated to get to 70% heard Immunity because 49% of Americans have already gotten Covid. This makes perfect sense. I know 35 people who have gotten it an gotten over it. I don’t know anyone who has been hospitalized.
How big will their announced stock buy back be this time?
"Three dogs of Tech AAPL, MU and AMD"
Hopefully by the time the car be ready who ever own n buy apples now will be able to buy one with their investment rn my 2021 gold is to have loke 300 shares rn im @145
Basically a last chance to buy at these prices.  WOW! Rocket has been fueled and ready to take off. Stability sets in next week . New Administration takes over. Stimulus (next round) going through. Fabulous quarterly results will begin pouring in. Listen to my years and years of investing experience and go long and you will prosper.
Why is Apple up 3.00 after hrs
GME and AMC traders will join AAPL. They are rich now
"Best results ever and down.. nowadays, we are in a Casino?"
YES APPLE! -- WE ARE GOING GREEN!
I don’t think Apple is gonna build an actual car but rather partner with with a manufacturer and supply the AI for a fully autonomous vehicle.
150 comming
I see there are probably shorts here that got burned last week just sore they lost money! Haaaaa
Remember that there was only 2 months of 12 phone sales in Q1.
Tony Bernstein talking about upcoming iCar and why it’s a very positive move by Apple and will transformThe Auto industry
Apple is just like the old trains. takes too much time to start rolling but it is for very long distances
GS wrong again on downgrading  to sell They want your cheap shares before earnings. $150 next stop!
Anyone have a good explanation of the huge dip in the market this morning?
Shorts are paying u your dividend this week....thank u shorts.....and the brokers thank u too for paying them their margin interest
This will run up to earnings!
Be strong Apple team.  A sell off is unnecessary. Don’t contribute to tanking the stock. Prices will be back at 142 + in a hot minute especially if people don’t panic today/tomorrow and give into FUD. Hold and even buy more if any good opportunities. That’s how we win on this one! 
150-160 after earning.
"So to anyone who’s sad seeing apple not perform too well everyday. Don’t worry. It’s normal. I started investing in apple since 2019 and year over year, it does do well. Better than most of my portfolio. So don’t worry. Also / look at this as a business. Somedays you’ll sell a lot of stuff and make good money; some days you won’t. But at the end of the day, what matters is how you did well year over year or month over month. Happy Friday. I’m out today."
Total BS. Fantastic Quarter. $$$$$$ in the coffers. Great products.Hanky-Panky.
"111 $Billion in sales last quarter.30% increase inJapanese sales50% increase in China sales.40% profit margin.Jeez........Hedge funds dumping AAPL to cover their losses in GME.BIG buying opportunity, here."
speechless!!
"Looks like that was the bottom, hope you got in before history is about to be made."
Your all awesome 
Ok everyone the election is over nothing is going to change. Conversations on this site should be in regard to stocks in particular AAPL. I do not think I am alone in my opinion. AAPL should be testing the year high by the end of the month.
just hold and you'll be fine
"I’m using Apple Watch, iMac, Mac Air, Apple TV, now I’m waiting for Apple car"
"AAPL should boost dividends more than normal. Also, did you see TSNP? It’s a PayPal juggernaut in the making and 35 cents. I hate OTC stocks but it’s the only one I invested in the past 5 years"
News flash: AAPL won’t be sliding for three months based on that ER
"""E=MC2 ... Elite = masses controlled squared""  #MU, #AMD, #AAPL, #AMZN, #TSLA"
Will we hit 140 today??? N stay above???
"I thought this was a board for Apple, not the NFL board? I love football and watching the game now but come on now!"
"Wow, what a quarter. Up or down tomorrow Apple is a company to own."
"Apple forward PE around 28 which isn’t bad considering 5G supercycle, own chips in computers, services booming, eventual car, and wearables booming with VR AR glasses on the way."
"The week before Thanksgiving I was saying I would be happy if Apple was $140 or so next Thanksgiving (2021). At the time it would have been about a $26 a share increase. Some people have recently posted about it not moving much positively recently. Its up a lot already. If you are a trader not a holder, this stock is probably not for you."
$124 tomorrow
Aapl will be at least $140 after earnings.
"What you need to understand is that apple is NOT a bubble, its a $111B maker per quarter actually, whereas tesla makes peanutes compared to its market cap, which is a bubble btw. Dont compare the two!! Never."
If you are not in this stock prior to blowout earnings in a week just stop doing stock market stuff.
Wow here we go
Buy before earning. Make$$$$$$$$
Apple goes up then people sell. Happens Everytime. Never stays up for long
Remember apple ask to produce 30% more iphone than last year and in the Q1 2020 they reach more than 90 bilions
can't wait for covid to be over. it has absolutely destroyed the economy and it's track.
"WEeks ago, ( my computer does this. It capitalizes ""WE"" when typing words?) WE posted $134 as posted twice as an intra day high. and $133+ as an intra day low.ALgorithim players need to close out before 1015 hrs.Anything can happen on Fridays. WE have seen AAPL run $4+ in the a.m. then close down $10.Congress phone call at 12000 about impeachment may be a factor"
Bought 200 more shares today I know it’s gonna shoot up after market. might hit $150 on Monday.
the market is down today because they want it to be....the big institutions grabbed some more shares as the vix was high......they win again as we residential holders have no choice to do anything else but hold
"If you make a bad comment about our president and his economic policy’s , Yahoo deletes it."
"If Apple makes a car, will it come with Windows?"
Goldman Sachs ----sticking to your $75 Apple price target?
Lots of comments about why this stock doesn’t just keep skyrocketing...we’ll look at the chart around the time of the split...it took off...trading at all time high PE valuations and has the highest valuation on the street. Patience is key with Apple. Company is firing on all cylinders right now.
111 billion per quarter and stock still down. Buybacks will start today and the panic buying will take it to 150 this month
"Hope, tomorrow it will be $138... buyback"
This is normal price action leading up to earnings. Plus the price bumps help. It may pull back a little on Tuesday and Wednesday then pop 5% on earnings beat. If there are any misses it will drop 10%
did everyone hear about the Apple-Hyundai deal yesterday?
Excuse me!!!!! what's going on?????
Where can we buy some Kia stocks??
Will be back over $130 soon
"GOOG and now AMZN up big on their inferior sales beats, yet APPL has the numbers to beat them all, and nothing, What gives??"
Like I said...solid green markets. No gains. If the markets turn south for a few days...this will be sub $130 fast.
There are many times more Apple shares in short position than GameStop shares in short position. Don’t be surprised if Apple moves up 100 points in 10 minutes.
"Every time the market drops, ask yourself. Has Apple's fundamentals changed? No they have not. Is Apple still a great company managed by great people? Yes it is. Will Apple continue to make money in the future? Yes it will. So when I see selloffs I see opportunity. Consider buying the dips. Your future self will thank you further down the line. Own it don't trade it. I'm still accumulating."
Apple to $225 forecasts Wedbush..
We are going to rally the rest of week after sell the news....the numbers are just to good
alert: let's start the big buying here plus the buybacks
"Every line of product above expectations except Mac which was in line according to cnbc. China sales up 60%, great entry time as stock goes down after hours ."
Last night 20 million shares traded between the range of $145 down to $136. That is a good sign.STay LONG
"AAPL is the king in town now!if AAPL says no, FB, SNAP, PINS, TWTR and GOOGL can’t make ads money! AAPL EV blueprint has already started threatening TSLA! AAPL is heading 200 in January!"
Unless we have a pandemic next year there is no way they can make their earnings and why there is no guidance....sales were pressed FORWARD so now it gets a lot tougher....much tougher. Boolean
"Master, my Apple stock is down $10/share"
This stock is definitely controlled by wall street no doubt!!
If I had any money left I would buy more Apple! It should be some where in the neighborhood of $150 next week!
What price range do people think Apple will be if and when the iCar is announced??
"Many overthinking things here... blowout earnings, vaccines, and stimulus all are bullish signs for apple and the stock market I do think the market is over priced however short-mid term I see it only going up just look at futures today... Apple will continue printing money recent sell off means nothing other than a buying opportunity ."
"I don't who massively sold their position yesterday, but it's time to add up"
Tony Balooga is saying that Apple’s Q2 will be even bigger than Q1. So keep your arm out of that wood chipper. Slower moving analysts will figure this out too.........but you’ll already know.
Buy now before it hits 150
"I deposited $800 into my brokerage account and will spend it all on Apple Stock. I bought some on the last split so I do have some shares. I'm not rich by any means so I'll buy this stock when I come across some cash. I'm 60 years old so whatever I buy, I'll just hold and hopefully watch it grow over the next 10-15 yrs."
I give up. Tesla rules.
Can you imagine the first two earnings call in 2024 after car sales? Man what a great time to invest
Typical Robinhooder trying to process what just happened- 
"I see an erriee silence in the office next door where them shorts and day traders reside. Ain't nothin funny about that. Last week they glow, they laugh, they dance and this week total silence and mourning as they pull out their lap tops . I told em go long folks but they laughted at me and mocked me like I was a dummy from them swamp. Look ladies and gentlemen go long and hold on because beloved Apple and the great market going up. Thanko"
Short term action blows but stay long!Not a day trading stock!
"Last buying opportunity, next week will be filled with media attention on the apple car news."
"calls expiring, nothing more. no problemos"
"I guess the market don't want day traders and traders for AAPL, AMD, MSFT........."
"This joint venture is so synergistic in many ways. Speeds the manufacturing ramp up that has plagued Tesla, allows Kia and Apple to build on each other’s significant battery technology, capital funding won’t be an issue like Tesla has had, logistics of “software” and “hardware” design, engineering and integration will be concentrated in USA, a sales and service international network already exists, both brands have loyalists worldwide, etc."
China sales up from 13B to 21B. Really no need for debate anymore. Just add on any dip.
I already bought another 200 shares early this morning. Thanks weak hands for the bargain price.
Shift the short squeeze from GameStop to apple ! We would all get rich from it and drive those thieving hedge funds into the ground !
"Apples should be at $297 by now! It is on hedge fund,, lets go Reddit Nation and Sqeeeeeeeeezzzz"
WHY DOWN if earnings beat the expectations ????Can somebody explain that to me PLEASE ?Thanks
Have a nice day.UNITE and PROFIT.
$170 soon to come. Apple broke all time hight 100 billion revenue
"Some of you on this board do not deserve to own Apple, so please sell!"
"AOC and Harris are planning on taxing your 401K as if it was realized capital gains.Then later down the road, confiscating it as reparations."
"Like it or not, Apple will finish the year on a high note. $140? $145? I can’t wait until the earnings end of Jan. Good job to all the Apple investors. May your investments continue to double in 2021! All the best!"
I keep forgetting...Apple doesn’t actually report until 1:30pm EST...? I want to avoid all the message board nonsense prior to the actual numbers getting released.
Wow Goldman sach was quick to give MSFT and hot upgrade BEFORE earnings mind you solid beat all around for the company round of applause  Now Goldman has been awfully quite about apple and no upgrades after record quarter 
ATH today? We ain’t even had a power lunch yet!
Huge beat
"Besides big EOM buys from 401k funds, Apple itself buying back again today too"
"Looks like the Tesla, Apple & Amazon shares of my primary portfolio is going to give another impressive return for this year as well. In 2020, I made a little over $900K with my portfolio. January 2021 is not even over yet and I've already made $192K already. I guess KARMA is just rewarding me for the decade of my life which I spent back in the early 2000s working like a dog (while being really sick) in order to put my now ex-wife through med-school. She then decided to pay me back by running off after she graduated & found a job in 2011..."
Every one calm down. We are all Americans and here on this page as investors. So I ask everyone please respect each other and let’s keep it civil. On this page I for one would like to connect and touch on AAPL. Political left or right should be muted. Again a reminder to all: please let’s convey our thoughts on AAPL. Have a peaceful and a good night. 
Apple in discussions now with 6 Japanese car manufacturers for Apple Car....nikkei
Apple and Hyundai confirmation news starting to spread...awesome! Self driving car will be manufactured in US agreement to be signed in March. This is a game changer!
"*stock drops* shorts: end of the world, yep, you will never see this price again"
$140 next week. $185 after earnings.
"Apple will be at $135 by the end of this week. And in the ball park of $137-139 before earnings. You can see an upside from the earning of 5-8%, making this stock go to $147 to $155.

Is anyone that is a technical trader willing to give your thoughts on a cup and handle formation over the 6 month chart? It looks like we had the handle yesterday (high of 138, low of 108), handle formation <70% of high and now moving up?"

Congrats to all who bought and held through earnings.
What’s happening with Apple stock price? It’s so painful to see the current price even thought it’s just had best earning in Q4.
Apple makes expensive computer and cell phone products. Kia and Hyundai are known for their cheap high-volume cars what kind of a match is that.I think Apple could have chosen a better car company to collaborate with to build the the it Apple car. even general motors would have been a better company to tie the reins with as they have the Cadillac line and I think apple and Cadillac is much more of a match. but then again what the hell do I know
In all my years of trading the performance of APPLE after a stellar earnings report is truly baffling. I still believe that either this afternoon or tomorrow AAPL will again get on track to perform as investors had hoped.
no body in US drives a Kiathe car is a play on the Asia market
AAPL could literally come out with a toilet seat tomorrow and sell millions. This is a buy and hold and continue to accumulate and reinvest the dividends for life and then pass along to your children when you’re gone.
"Markets are green...Apple is red, Just another day at the office this year"
"Apple’s (AAPL) stock fell after CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s earnings call that he expected a second-quarter deceleration in wearables and services sales growth, overshadowing fiscal first-quarter revenue and earnings that topped expectations. WTH?"
"There is no better long term investment plan than buy as much AAPL as you can, as soon as you can, and hold. This goes up over time. In no time, people will be saying, man, I wish I had bought Apple at $140. It's a no brainer!"
Patience and Stay long!This is long term hold stock!
Do you think if i will buy more shares now i will get more money tommorow after earning ?
Face it . Appl is the future . Twitter and Facebook are nothing compared to Apple . We will only rise
We have going to have double the earnings everyone expects! Massive growth! Robinhood forever!
10 Days until earnings!! Can't wait for all of you to come back on this message board and say you shouldn't have sold me your shares for dirt cheap so I could get richer. I am planning on buying a new car with the money so let me say thank you in advance!!
im glad this gamestop nonsense is over so people finally can start focusing on real growth stocks like apple

"Tim cook getting a bonus for the first time, should tell you everything about the ER"
Why is it plummeting?
Whoever got options. You guys selling if it pops past $138 before earnings. Or taking the risk of holding it after
"TODAY :Apple (AAPL +3.7%) has reportedly hired former Tesla exec Stuart Bowers for its car team in the latest sign that the project is moving forward.Bowers was the VP of Engineering at Tesla before leaving in 2019 after a 16-month stint.Apple is several years away from producing a car (some reports suggest five), but is expected to cast a large shadow on how EV-tech partnerships shake out."

"Big money is conspiring to get the market entirely disinterested in AAPL so they maximize their gain from blowout ER, after which AAPL gets bound to a whole new trading range.Be patient & keep buying!"
"I've been holding Apple for 20 years. This pattern is predictable:-) Stock runs up to big announcement-) Stock falls the day after big announcement-) Stock recovers within a short time (for me, even a year is a short time. YMMV)-) Stock overall performance is higherThus, anyone who recognizes this, and adds to their position the day after, is doing very very well. I still own 7000 shares I bought in December 2000. But over the years, I've added SIGNIFCANTLY MORE, during times like this. And I retired at age 45 (now 57). My only market talents are: Intelligence and Patience."
Apple won't have a EV on the road for 7 plus years (Yikes) and by that time Tim Cook will be driving a GM EV to work or more likely at retirement home.

"$135 tomorrow and we are in good shape. Tomorrow is key, can’t give up what we got today. Let’s go!"
I’m thinking Apple blows away earnings. Q1 2019 was 1.28 that’s with iPhone 11 launching in sept Q3 meaning initial sales of iPhone 12 pushed to Q4. Reports also indicate Apple raising iphone 12 production by 30% and App Store/services up another 30%. Also M1 and covid remote work/learning NOT in Q4 2019. This makes me ballpark a 30% increase in eps for Q4 2020 vs Q4 2019 resulting in Q4 eps increase of .40 resulting in Q4 eps of 1.68 resulting in trailing twelve months PE of 38 at a stock price of 145. This doesn’t take into account large increases in free cash flow and net cash. I mean every report about lead times and number crunching says every product Apple is selling is crushin it. Any thoughts?
When do we see this recovering to the $145 it was last week?
"F my call options, i dont even care anymore. I genuinely want to see how low this stock goes after an earnings beat like this. It is entertaining at this point. We have not had a correction like this since october and of course it happens the day or Apple earnings. Sometimes you cannot even get mad, just embrace the frustration"
"All I can say is this: Bought Apple for the first time last August, right before the split. After today’s drop I am up 25.31%. Nothing bad about that.....Apple is solid!"
This will continue until the GameStop mania comes back to earth.

"Disgraceful what Apple, Amazon, Facebook, google, and Twitter are doing. Seems Parler snatched a few million of Facebook's customers (including me) so now they must shut them down? Hard to fight back, but every little bit helps. I cancelled my Amazon account (don't like them anyway), don't shop at Whole Foods, don't read the Washington Post (Bozo's mouth piece), canceled my Facebook account (no ad revenue from me), canceled my Apple music subscription (can use Spotify), and will be changing to Reagan Mail. Like I said, not much impact from one person, but if millions do it, they will feel it. They only understand $$$$. I'm a long time Apple shareholder and not happy with them right now at all."

"The high-end innovative consumer technology in Apple’s roadmap, including its VR headset, is like no other, one-of-a-kind, and impossible to reproduce from competition without heavy investment. Even if it could be copied, it’s all carefully patent-protected. This deserves AAPL a much higher multiple"
"apple is a $2T company. y'all are expecting 20-30% gains in a week, which is absurd cause that would mean growing thing company by $700B in a short amount of time. have reasonable expectations. apple will go up over time. $140-145 right now is reasonable in the short to mid term."
Why is AAPL down? A great quarter with awesome earnings ! Overall market is way up! This should be surging!
"I'm gonna give you an opinion take it or leave it you make up your mind: tesla has been the absolute most shorted stock, like many billions lost. and with this new surge up, I believe it is due to shorts unable to take it any longer. this cannot go like this forever. at 500 post split this had a potential downfall to 300, at 850 nothings changed and the downfall is still 300. so I urge you to at least take profits. and if your a new trader do some math, you would have to reach 1600 to get 100%. I generally invest only in companies that can potentially reach 400% per year, you wont see that with tesla... on to some advice take it or leave it. #AAPL is getting into the ev spacs with hyundai spilling the beans that they are in talks with apple about batteries etc. #GOEV or canoo will be providing the skateboard and engineering services to Hyundai for their next evs and likely for Apple's. a company that has a market cap of 3 billion. now do you think a 700b company would be a better investment or a 3b company. I can see canoo going to 40 to 50b market cap pretty quickly ( next 5 years) do the math can tesla match that? are they going to be providing everything ever produced? that is where their market cap is going. I've been in canoo warrants at 1.8 and averaged up to 3.5. anything under 5 is a bargain. just some advice take it or leave it. go with your gut, your subconscious or whatever you want to call it."

Apple is also increasing production capacity for smart speakers, earphones and computers in Southeast Asia as part of its ongoing diversification strategy, the sources added.In Vietnam, Apple is mobilizing suppliers to expand production capacity for the latest HomePod mini, the affordable version of its voice-activated smart speaker lineup. The device has been produced in Vietnam since it was introduced last year. The Cupertino-based tech giant has already increased local production of its audio-related products, including its various AirPods lineups, sources said."

"Kia doesn’t make any sense. AAPL partnered with BMW to have the first wireless CarPlay solution. They partnered with BMW to provide the first phone/car key solution. I would have thought they would partner with BMW on project Titan. BMW is known for high quality cars, “the ultimate driving machine”. Kia is know for low cost, cheap plastic cars and if you look at BMW vs Kia in terms of brand quality and loyalty and compare it to what AAPL stands for, I have a hard time believing Kia is the right company to partner with."

What reason is there for a 70 billion increase in value pre market? THIS IS A BUBBLE....134 people cheering this price higher each day. Even if earnings are good....the Value is poor 42 times EPS. From 2015 to 2017 this traded for 15 times EPS.

"Interesting reading with everything going on with the financial markets over the past week from Robinhood to the pumping of certain stocks.As a big Apple investor, seeing the price get hit after brilliant earnings is always a bummer but if like me you are a long term investor it will continue to be a great buy for years to come.There are mixed views with regards to the Gamestop and AMC pumping as well as ther high short interest stocks. Personally I feel that this will hopefully going forward create change to how the SEC controls hedge funds and allowing of naked shorting stocks!! These guys are crooks and destroyed companies for decades for their own gain in which most of us have possibly been impacted to some degree over the years. I say let this sort itself out, let the poor take from the rich and maybe they will hopefully learn.Why am I not worried about the short term volatility, because I hold my stocks for the long term and know it will all be fine in time, for some this is a great opportunity to also buy!!"

"Appl is now a very mature company, but is still being viewed by many as a start up. They’re doing great, but just shouldn’t be valued as they are. A mid 30s PE and a 250 PEG are just excessive. They can’t grow quickly enough to bring those ratios down to earth so the only alternative is to bring the stock price down. Appl should be sub $100."

Hope longs held their positions today. Look ahead to end of this year and into 2022. Apple  will be good.
"Why is it when AAPL shareholders speak their minds that might not seem positive, they will get attacked. Mind you/attackers, whether a shareholder owns 1 or 10,000 shares it shouldn't make any difference. As shareholders, we have the right to say what we want about this or other companies out there, so long we own shares of those companies."
Don’t be discouraged longs. GO APPLE 
Currently cringing at the Apple stock price ! Im sad to say this is my portfolios poorest performer for the day and it’s probably got the brightest future ! Urgh
AAPL need to post a blurry picture of its EV prototype to make it soar to $200
"So I have decided that since apple wants to decide who their customers are, I am going to decide who I want to invest my money with. What phone I will buy for myself and my family, What kind of laptop and desktop computer to buy. Apple should stay in their lane and if they don't I would suggest not investing with them someone else can buy my shares on monday"
Hello all! I’m new here and just wanted to know how you all feel about Apple pursuing EV? Do you think it will actually happen? TIA
"The stars are aligned against AAPL.If you can stomach the turmoil by all means hang in there.I have held for about 15 years.It has proven to be a good investment but I think those days are now gone.Like trying to turn around a battleship in a small bay, this stock is too big to make any moves now.The stock split was an error.The Robinhood investors want TSLA, GME,AMC, and hundreds of others.I pulled my original $$ out after the last split but still have a tripple on their money."
$160 after earnings....just checked my crystal ball.
"Sell, not all but some for a profit. They are going to beat, but someone will find 1 negative and the stock will tank."
"Those M1 laptops are selling like hot cakes, I don't if I should feel happy about aapl or feel bad about intc....."
I'm selling when Warren Buffet sells.
"Calm down everyone! Take a look at the one year chart, the current lows are bouncing off the upwards trend line starting from March 2020. Earnings are on the 26th and all reports are showing apple earnings are going to be great! Sounds like some of you FOMOd in at the $135ish price when the apple car rumors came out last month."
likely a good time to buy. Will likely announce they crushed all expectations and yet the price will still drop.
Yep 140 jimmy chill thinks very upbeat on earnings. Carter wirth also thinks breakout above the triple top 138. On to 150 after earnings
Total up for this week will equal to $30
People have zero patience. This is a long term hold. Does it really matter what it hits this week. I’ve had this stock for over 7 years and don’t plan on selling anytime soon. Calm down. And enjoy the ride

"Apple’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021."
Just remember history dictates that Apple may pop after earnings but it will take a drastic hit like 30% if the market corrects 10% in March. And that will be just another buying opportunity. Never sell Apple unless you need money from your retirement funds or brokerage account. Always reinvest your divi on pullbacks.
great earning folks ! a very uppy uppy day tomorrow. Just bought more today. I aint kidding! A up up up day tomorrow. Thanko
2 weeks before History making record earnings! The climb upward has begun!
Oh My - Train Wreck for Korean auto makers -- Bloomberg: Apple and Hyundai hit the brakes on Apple Car production negotiations
a real car company that puts cars out fast and Apple for the software this is beautiful not much room for failure here
"to all those that sold today, apple, twitter, google, Amazon. ya all have had little effect. lol. companies are no further down than any other down day."
160 plus after earning ..undervalued.
"Hold your position and buy more after hours. Shorties will start to cry eventually. Keep in mind that AAPL solid profit Q over Q , Fiscal year over FY is your core, your backbone of calmness and confidence. Apple rocks! in product and service. Trust in fundamentals more than bashers, institutions who want to take risk with no basis just. A monster gap-up is coming to AAPL , just buy more. AAPL has my blessings and all shorties will run away to the hill to cover. Patience . Shorties will cry eventually."
"Oh my God! Investors Place dated January 22, 2021 Larry Sullivan “7 undervalued stocks that could perk up under Democratic leadership =Apple, All State, GM, Qualcomm, Cisco, Lockheed”."
It is maddening. Presumably the price before earnings took into account the earnings estimates. It is hard to find the logic in the stock price moving lower today after blow out profits which significantly beat those estimates. But Apple will continue it’s upward trend after the dust settles.
TBH - $145 seems a little far still 
"Go ahead and sell, keep the price down. I need to wait for my AMC profits to clear anyways before I can buy more shares."
"STOP WHINNING, same old AAPL earnings release pattern, a dip then up to new highs. AAPL should hit 160 next week"
Hope we will see a nice recovery coz the last week was horrible
My savings account hates me this week although my portfolio will thank me in a months time
Bank $150. this week
"Relax longs, we're heading for Green Numbers tomorrow and going forward. DON'T SELL !!"
Currently trying to break a small resistance level. Going to 150 in a month
Monday is last day for me own Apple will sell all and buy all NOK
INVESTORS AND WS ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE RECKONING FORCE BEHIND THE AAPL CAR. IT WILL TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY. AAPL DESERVE A PE OF 100 AT LEAST. AAPL OVER 141 TOMORROW.
Goldman Sachs better NOT manipulate Apple stock with low price target from the recent incredible quarter earning! They have numerous times trying to manipulate apple stock with their ridiculous price projection. Why are they so negative with apple stock?
How about those Giants !!!!!
I bought shares today (friday 5th) am i getting dividends?
"yo guys dow now down 195 points , i sayeth green before opening and why not? Market so fundamentally strong and stable. Close to 90% companies beat expectations . Babba is well positioned! Thanko"
So where would this be if they missed on the numbers? 5 dollars?
200M more shares bought back and retired. Apple can buy back half its market value in 8-9 years
48 percent capital gains taxes would be brutal and send market in a nose dive. . When will we know his exact tax policy
I believe Google crushed all estimates and is up big time after hours. Fuel up the Rocket engines we are taking off for another galaxy tomorrow
"Right on, Tim. You tell ‘em!In his speech, Cook laid into algorithm-driven social media platforms, painting them as, “An interconnected ecosystem of companies and data brokers, of purveyors of fake news and peddlers of division, of trackers and hucksters just looking to make a quick buck.”"

"All this talk about the Parler app has ruined this message board. Does anybody ever talk about AAPL here any more. I have a Samsung plone,phone, my dog is not in this fight. But,I own over 600 shares of AAPL, so I do care. I just hope we don't get a huge selloff on Monday . But,if we do,hopefully we end the week higher."
AAPL futures skyrocketing in anticipation of blowout earnings...after 5mo the beast has awakened...release the kraken
Regardless of Thursday’s AAPL performances it will be in the $160s by early March.
i say 190 by my birthday in May -- anyone else want to play

"Pssst, hey Apple shorties. Do you know what happens if you are currently holding your open short positions on Apple stock when the ex-dividend date rolls around? You get to pay those dividends OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKETS! Enjoy..."
Apple stock price prediction for 2025?
" announced they are taking over the stock market. They will let you know when you can sell your shares and for how much. If you don't like it, you can tweet about it. They are releasing scripted tweets you are allowed to use at your discretion. Any variation of the tweet will cause your account to be suspended. Lastly, they are also releasing information on approved hair styles. The only one approved for men, is called the Bezos. It's the shaved head sleepy eye look. This concludes the morning service announcement."
Just bought some more :P
Expect to be traded $162+ after earnings tomorrow!
Yellen is market friendly and the Fed supports the market. Good Luck
Everything points to AAPL treading water here $135 for near term. Today and yesterday the algorithim players had their 100+%+days.How?They made lemonade out of lemons
"Long hold with AAPL for two years. Was first time position and it’s all part of a well balanced breakfast...I mean portfolio. Have I sold any, sure! And, then I bought in the dips. Yes, I might sell again to hold onto my earnings and then buy again in dips. That said, it’s not the alpha and omega of my portfolio."
AAPL should hit a new high on Tuesday or Wednesday next week following its same old earnings release pattern of dip then new high.
Yup upgrades and increased price targets tomorrow...then all eyes turn to Apple Car
We sitting on mountain of $$$ I believe icar would be revolutionary car!!! You know Apple products always quality and very very modern!
I’ll take 137 close.
I want to do a $150 option call for 03/19/21. you guys think we'll be in the money by then?
For sure AAPL will hit $175.00 before summer !
I told you all ! We need a short squeeze because today’s short positions are just a series of reckless bets ! They are only doing it because they can get away with it ! If people band together and try to squeeze them out who knows what would happen 
"Apple is dead at $135 to look good , hedge funds can pull it Bach to $98 today if they wanted to"
"If this falls to $90, would anyone buy?"
With almost 59 millions in Traded. Can’t even stay put around 131. The question of the day is: why are people still selling AAPL?
Sold and bought Amazon... earnings and split next week time to actually make some money
"Hope Apple car is an innovative product, not a copycat of the existing EV. We all need some excitements from Apple inventions."
"Heads up!I love apple products and have many including the new Apple 6 Watch. But l will not have my 1st Amendment right of free speech stifled for me or anyone else regardless of liking or disliking what they say and do. Apple, Twitter, Facebook, and certain news Chanel’s, etc. cannot be allow to control what we hear or don’t hear. The best way to get your voice out there it seems under today’s circumstances is with the almighty dollar. If we crush their share prices maybe they will learn that they are not God. Believe in our Constitution and BOYCOTT companies that go against personal choice. we have the right to protest the right way, not with violence, but with our money. God Bless America, l hope we are not to late to turn this technology disaster around.Thanks for listening, don’t react, just think about it!"
I thought this was supposed to move on the Kia investment???
Watch for money rotation today from AMC and GME into AAPLAAPL is sound and positive today vs cosmic speculation games...
Close above $131.
"Cramer himself admitted on CNBC that he’s “never seen the guns like this. They can break shorts.”Speaking of GME, AAPL about to do the same!"
"On Monday of this week, I saw some posts claiming a Friday close of $160 - $200. Well?"
"Lol no body wants to let go of their shares and as soon as it starts to dip, people start buying more!"
Strange action after TSM blowout news who is big supplier for apple!
"I am absolutely convinced that these green whack job environmentalist won’t be satisfied until we’re all living in caves again, emitting zero carbon."

The whole market was just cut in half
I'll be happy was a $2 increase in stock price this week. Slow and steady wins the race.
Investors realize earnings will push this over $140 in 12 days? Wow maybe even a special dividend?
Apple will definitely have a huge run next year. $200 dollar price target for 2021 is an understatement. Sit back and relax. We have the world's brightest running the show in the company
Not a good idea to get into car business .I think Apple should stay in its core competence .
I was skeptical of the theory that hedge funds are selling Apple to cover their enormous losses on Gamestop. But it makes sense. Apple is the biggest holding for theses hedge funds and they have been forced to cover billions in losses. Same thing is going to happen today based on the huge premarket surge in GS.
Just announced that Apple is going to build an EV autonomous car with KIA for release in 2024.
What a great car deal!
"Gene Muster on CNBC analyzing AAPL earnings, check it out!"
141 tomorrow. Time to gap back to 145 and head to 150
Apple is NEVER EVER 1st to market. Apple lets the market work out the bugs and then enters the market knowing they can improve it DRASTICALLY!
Hedge funds playing games with this stock
Theres alot of posts here from older investors. Their not lying. This stock is the real thing if your younger buy n tuck away. Accumulate. It splits every so many yrs. thats where the money is made. Believe . Don’t daytrade and watch this everyday. It’s a keeper for ever. It goes up. it goes down. It sleeps then wakes up and goes up. Then it moves a alot at once. I think it always mostly beats the market but i might be wrong.
Green at day's end ????
"Honestly I hope this opens flat tomorrow so I can buy more shares, that earnings call was incredible"
$400 coming soon
Apple will also continue to research and buy companies which are well run and will positively affect its top and bottom lines. Apple will end 2021 at $400 per share
Anyone here know anyone who bought an AAPL product in Q4?Anyone here know anyone planning to buy an AAPL product in Q1?
Looks like 145 today Hopefully 148-149 tomorrow We will be in position for the 170+ Look at NFLX no Cash Flow yet but subs went up to 200 million Stock popAt earnings $72 Apple is going to produce there best earnings ever in history think about that the most I’ve seen Apple jump is $38 + imagine if even that on 150 we would have Friday to finish it off
"Microsoft had a stellar quarter reported after hours on Tuesday and they dropped like a rock on Wednesday, today Thursday looks like Microsoft is heading back up. Speculation can have an affect but solid fundamentals will win out in the longer term."

"Still a lot of shorts that need to cover, hence the bashing going on they are just trying to drive the price down! Take advantage of these dips and buy because once tomorrow hits she is going to run!"
WAKE UP AAPL
I bought 1k shares at $138. Should I cut my losses?

Apple and Microsoft GREEN tomorrow!! Garunteed kids!
"down bad on options, still i have faith that it will do a quick reversal at any moment"
"please, does anyone know ex-dividend date. can't find it"
"Compared to AMZN, Apple has much higher return on sales and a significant better P/E ratio. So in direct comparision the stock should easily trade at the double price, or AMZN at the half of it's current price."
"Apple stock is the canary in the goldmine tomorrow. Watch closely. Full disclosure: I bought apple on Tuesday and sold tonight after the market closed and after I heard GameStop was full on for trading tomorrow. I got into GameStop last May and have been riding that bull. In my opinion apple will be one of the first indicators there is a problem in the market tomorrow. It is quick and easy for institutions to get large shares in and out without moving the needle to much. In other words,, there might be selling of apple to cover other risks in the market. I am not an financial advisor or trading professional and please take this advice after you conduct your on Due Diligence. I’m just an average dude making my own observations. Moreover, I have never shorted a stock and have zero intentions to short apple now or in the future."
150 to 160 range is coming in the near future (think 150s).
Wow guys just ordered new phone for family member- delivery tomorrow!!! Pro max 12 one day delivery!!
MSFT reporting day before AAPL along with FB reporting the same day as Apple could create a magnificent psychological synergy that will invigorate the price action post earnings maybe into next week. Could AAPL be having an 8 day winning streak like TSLA?
"Sorry Tim, my affiliates and me really like our Tesla's... the brand speaks to us and our facade-focused ego... give Elon a call, apologize for ignoring him when he REALLY needed an Apple affiliate/funding... beg him to use his platform to build this worlds 1st higher end ""TeslApple"" EV SUV.My multiples of affiliates will pay cash for these EV superstars... and the ""I want a TeslApple EV SUV"" FREE marketing explodes across therr World.FYI, neither your Silicon Valley nor my demographic WILL EVER wrap itself in a KIA nor Hyundai EV.a high-end iPhone user experience married to a lower-end KIA experience/brand.Tim, WHY dis you AVOID this topic and announcement during Earnings Call Q&A, WHY? I have lost a level of trust in my relationship with what is said/withheld to we stockholders."
"I had an issue with airpod pro yesterday, called in for a support they shipped the replacement on the same date. Today, I received my replacement airpod and listening music. I bought more shares today."
It was a painful feeling hearing price targets increase as the price falls.
A grind back to $140? Smh
Hopefully tomorrow apple still up what do you guys think?
I heard that Apple car will have no steering wheel and fully autonomous. 
Good Morning! Looks like a nice day for Apple again.

"Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple Squeeze out the shorts before they Hammer this great company Stay positive and focus on the technological pipeline "
The swing in the price is usually you small retail players. The Big funds hold on fir a few years so it's you people on this board complainng of the price going down Because you are the ones selling apple not the investment banks
bought the dip and it's already profit :))
"""Apple Estimates Continue to Inch Higher, Driven By Strong iPhone 12 Demand""By Eric J.

Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives today's Bull case AAPL price Target in 12 months : $225 ! FYI
Get ready for take off! 
After hours trading don’t mean anything.
TSLA should be $142.00. Apple should be $800.00.
Get in or get out of the way! Next Stop is 150
"I don't own any AAPL devices,but I love the stock!"
Just goes to show you that blowout record earnings means nothing on a heavily manipulated stock like Apple. Beware all the euphoria leading up to events and then the sell off. Happens every time. But it will recover quickly always does
"Apple is creating a patented ""monocell"" battery design that will bulk up the individual battery cells and free up space inside the battery pack by removing pouches and modules that hold battery materials. This will allow for more active material in a smaller package. Engineers have described the battery technology as ""next level"" and similar to ""the first time you saw the iPhone."""
bout time it went green......'
Past January history suggests AAPL will trend higher this upcoming week and month. And profit-bookers from 30 days ago most certainly will be buying back in
"Pot stocks up 10-20%, banks up 3-5%, twtr, nflx, tsla, snap, dis, GE, tgt all up 3-6%.Appl up 2 quarters, two dimes. For now."
Apples hardware engineering chief steps down to work on mystery project? What’s that all about? Someone needs to ask Tim at the call tomorrow ￼
I've a feeling analyst upgrades will start coming in...
Down a buck and people are panicking? I would get out of the market and buy an index fund or bonds. Good lord get a grip.
"Couples things to note. I’m pretty sure Apple didn’t go with a premium brand since Apple simply needs a manufacturing plant to team up with. Lexus, BMW, etc. were probably charging Apple a lot of money for their resources and Kia/Hyundai were probably more reasonable.￼ Apple ultimately controls the hardware and software have the car and will be fully responsible for the quality control as well. I think this might be a hit.￼"
$TSLA $AAPL $WIMI lol all the bears come out with low future. 
JUST NEEDS TO BREAK $138.30ish. No resistance from there.
last chance under 143 right now...
Anyone who is unsure about Apple stock should consult the technicals ! The RSI and MACD are both telling us Apple stock is teetering on the oversold and is due a bounce !
"Apple sold $14 billion in corporate bonds. Some of that will be used to buyback shares. Probably a dividend increase as well. If they think this thing goes higher, I’m gonna believe it"

The news was initially reported by Korea Economic Daily TV, though Reuters, Bloomberg and others have since reported that Hyundai says it is in some kind of discussion with Apple about a car tie-up."
"I am happy but they have a blow out quarter and the stocks looses 10% then they announced they are getting in the auto business and the stock takes off , oh well I will take it"
Anyone on this board have over 10 IQ?
Love the negative comments from the shorts and trolls! They know what’s coming next week. Today proved it
If Apple could pull in $110 billion this on Jan 27th earning report or about $6.47 p/shr. share price could hit $160.
Goodbye to all the shorts. It was nice having you here but it's time for you to go. Time to sell and make the price go even higher before you get a margin call tonight!!
"Apple is full of surprises. Just as we were surprised to find out that they are actually making a car, we might be surprised to learn that it will be available for purchase several years sooner than most expect."

But for the most part, you'll be glad that you did your best to hold on to your Apple stock and/or your spouse.Then when the marriage is over, she takes half of your Apple stock...!"

this is unacceptable
Cowen reiterated Outperform rating but raise price target from 133 to 153
The economy is not going to prosper under the new administration. Mark my words. He’s already caused the loss of 10’s of thousands of jobs.
"For those that are selling your shares as a protest statement don’t forget all of your mutual funds, retirement accounts etc that hold shares of AAPL and other tech companies."
Patience Weak Hands getting out....bide your time the fundamentals always prevail. Apples earnings just to good.
I hope all hedge funds burn for what they have done to apple since earnings ! Predators!
"So, how long until AAPL is a $4 Trillion dollar company? 2 years maybe? People will be wishing that they bought when this was only $140"
I feel happy when the market manipulators/funds lose money....just praying Apple shocks the market with upside earnings....like BOOM
no reason for the selling. China new year and booming economy and opening stores soon and %g roll out should take AAPl tp 170
I cant remember last time I saw a 3 dollar move in premarket... and just imagine if it beat earnings and give good guidance. This may go over 170 in 2 weeks. And 200 by december.
AAPL WILL BE OVER 145 TOMORROW GUARANTEED. SMALL INVESTORS DO NOT WANT TO MISS THE POST EARNINGS RALLY AND INSTITUTIONS AND HF WILL BUY MORE AND SHORTS WILL COVER AND THERE ARE NO SELLERS. THX
when they announce the earnings report? After market today?
Apple talks with Hyundai Kia have paused as Apple is in talks with other manufacturers.
I love apple.
shorts have to cover today or pay dividend next week
Apples gonna be building there ev’s In kia’s Georgia plant!!! Go apple 
Apples new price target is $155.00 . We will see that soon
APPLE CAR will be amazing game changer sooner than expected! Tim Cook is the BEST CEO IN THE WORLD...
"People selling off now, this is going to tank big time. Hope I'm wrong have 1800 shares."
Does Apple announce earnings before or after the market closes on Wednesday?
"Everyone is an expert fortune teller here on this board. You're either investing in Apple or you're gambling with Apple. Some are thinking out loud, and others are praying out loud for their own agenda. Some are pumpers, some are dumpers. I hope you all take a deep look at what you're really saying AND reading here."
When the number of shares is greater than the number of people living on planet earth...thats usually the first sign to curtail buying
So much of market prices for stock is about sentiment. Increased earnings over time change the sentiment and the price goes up but it's hard to know which is the driver of the I believe Apple is trading at some of the highest multiples that it ever has currently. If it is due for a pause in the increased price then it doesn't mean you should worry it will eventually consolidate and then go up again. Relax and be patient.
"Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia."
Family added - Two IPHONE 12's with all the fixings today......
Can anyone give me a rational explanation for the stock dropping again today?
Don’t forget end of the month is a weekend so monthly investments for the pension plans and 401 k and 403b and future tuition plans and IRA etc will come pouring in today and tomorrow and almost all of it goes into the stock market. Technology is the buzz word
"Okay, can anyone share some insight on what Apple did today regarding it's new $14 billion debt deal? Company has close to $200 billion in cash and they're offering six-tranche deal. Meaning six deals are divided up from low to high risk. Aree they doing a buy back of their stock?"
I am out Apple has lost direction. They can not focus to make anything.
What innovation has $AAPL introduced in the last 3-4 years? Note: slimmer bezels are NOT innovation. Clever product pricing with pricing jumping from 64GB to 256GB storage with nothing in between is NOT innovation.
I thought apple would be $125 today you shorties?
Futures recovering fast...might have a nice rally tomorrow...
Did they mention stock buy backs at all on the call ?
"As I know during the pandemic, the Apple store was the only store has lot of customers lining up to get in every time when I walk passed. It is about the brand, the supporters. Unless there is another brand surpass the Apple and some really bad news that hurt the Apple image. Otherwise, Apple stock is very safe to keep. I don't ever listened to the what they called themselves :"" Annalists "". The most important is the Apple has a very solid finance foundation."
Has anyone looked ahead to 2nd and 3rd quarter earnings? I bet they do just as well as the 1st.
AAPL is in the portion of my portfolio that I don't worry about. Fundamentals are solid and history is on my side. Rest easy friend. Two months from now you will forget this day ever happened.
"Or, do you expect AAPL to go up another 7X in the next 8eight years and be a 16 trillion Co."
Wedbush $200 target. Wedbush's Dan Ives has always been right. Believe him.
"Good afternoon, I look forward to pumping liquidity - there will be growth preceding the split"
Had a bid in on Friday for some shares @$130.00 got so close hit $130.21 will see what Monday brings...I was looking at Apple months ago for around $112.00 was waiting for $100.00 to start a position...think great long term hold.
This is a $200.00 stock.
Y’all should’ve bought in today Apple so cheap. Watch it the up coming weeks due to earnings 
"as i said, apple numbers never disappoint. future looks fantastic. all i need to know. goodnight everyone."
Adding to Apple position tomorrow....these earnings just confirmed how undervalued Apple is
Maybe if Tim Cook changes the company's name to GameApple Stop then the share will rocket 200% in 2 days on practically zero profit earnings reports...!
Do you think the profits from GME will find their way into Apple?
Martin you made the right move keep buying and hold it for long. GLTA
Again there’s nothing that’s going to be a positive market today no news Might see 135 today
Massive beat!!
As investors in AAPL we can agree to disagree with civility. However there are those on this board that strive for the opposite with negativity and disrespect. Keep politics out and contribute to a fruitful dialogue pertaining to the purpose of this page.
Just have a feeling that earnings are going to be higher than the highest estimates....and drive us to 150 within a month
I'll get another 100 if you can hold this price until Friday!
I don’t mind that’s it’s down after hours. I get to buy more cheaper now lol
Highest Close on AAPL was 136.69.... Until todayWe are in Breakout mode.... Giddy-UP
"Possible names for Apple cars include, Red Delicious, Gala, Honeycrisp, Golden Delicious, Pink Lady, CandyCrisp, Earligold, Empire, Enterprise, Evercrisp, Goldrush, Ginger Gold, Jazz, Jubilee, Liberty, Melrose, Opal, Rome, RubyFrost, Snowsweet, Straberry, Sundance, SweeTango."
nothing but good news and this is still trading below $140??
Ohhh is this puppy going up Thursday.....
It’s like Thai stock knows if it goes up to $140 again everyone is going to get out and put there money into something that can gain more than a % a day LOL
"Question.. Should I put a $140 limit sell on some shares in case the earnings report is whatever, or any other reason? I figure if it drops back down to $140, it's probably going lower and I can always buy shares back.."
its only going up from now on.will close 134.50. calls will expire.next week fresh money in the stock and back to 145 in the first 2 days
So why is this going down after hours? Thought today was going to be the big day?
So much for our short term high hopes
I am going on record here. NO WAY NO HOW IS APPLE DOWN TOMORROW. Tomorrow AAPL will not disappoint. 
Last chance to buy before $135
SELL $FB $TWTR $AMZN $AAPL $GOOGL THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN.
"So we have an agreement between two companies to partner on an EV that, if it all works out, will produce a product in 10 years. Massive investment by APPL and massive risk, so why is the stock popping on the announcement?"
"Just chill out, long term investors should be happy "
"Apple reported per-share earnings of $1.68 and revenue of $111.44 billion.Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.42 a share on revenue of $103.27 billion, according to FactSet."
Here we go. CNBC says minorities should get preference in vaccinations.The media has gone off the rails.
Nothing new here. Expect mid $130's this week with a slow climb to upper $140s near June. Aapl is long term.
Are people selling AAPL and buying GME? Bagholders being born every minute. On the road today but hope we're back in the $140's at open.
"unbelievable, RED after great quarterly results."
AAPL about to take the lead in EVs from TSLA--I feel AAPL is a short term strong buy but I also think long term EVs are a loser or low margin and Apple can be in better markets.
"Gee, I’m starting to miss The President. The real President."

Apple to hit 200 by match
I’m thinking the whole market gets a bounce tomorrow.
AAPL shorts better cover by Friday or have the dividend substracted from their stock accounts.
"People need to stop upgrading their iPhones (or other expensive phones) every year or even every 3 years. Buy a new phone when the current one stops working. Seriously people, have you thought about the huge environmental impact of this?"
I see apple to hit 3 trillion market cap soon may be in the summer.
"The hedge funs and shorts are trying every thing to keep us away from apple with negative news. We should squeezy the heck out of them on this, Apple has the tail wind to fly to $2500 easy and it is dirt cheap now."
"no one expected a $8 billion beat in revenue, it should be green shortly"
Bought more this morning and already up two bucks early retirement here I come!
CNBC is coming unglued because a APPL is down 4%. Who cares? they act like apple cured cancer or something. nobody getting hurt here up 62% in the last year.
hedge funds selling like mad
Apple phone sales grow 100% year over year in India? Oh My God.......Nobody even dreamed that could happen. This is a Triple Grand Slam SuperCycle.......And it’s just starting.

Okay! This is what I'm talking about. Let's get moving here. Nice afterhours bump up. I hope it holds.
"Anyone have any thoughts on their electric vehicle, if they pull that off Apple will just be a monster stock"
"Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty on Thursday reiterated her Overweight rating on Apple stock and lifted her price target to $152 from $144. She writes that her checks find that Apple saw strength across its products and services portfolio in the quarter, driven by 5G iPhone adoption, the work-and-learn-from-home trend, and sustained engagement with the App Store."
"Price target upgrades today 150.,160 170."
VIX down VXN unchanged a sure indicator that the market will rise
Just confirmed post by Common sense. One hour ago Hyundai and Apple announced a joint venture in production of electric cars. It’s real it’s coming.
"Check the charts: From August to now AAPL formed a cup and handle, need a little bit more volume for the breakout and confirmation vs the Nas in slight red and being on Friday. Good luck."
Plummeting after hours - oh noooo
"Don't be afraid, I won't sell my shares until next split, it's Apple and it worth the wait."
"Come guys, keep buying.Earnings day is right around the corner"
Aapl will be up 20 by monday

"I hate to be negative, but the futures don’t look good at all."
If Amazon pushes up great earnings all techs are up tomorrow even aapl
"Can we have 150 today plz, thanks!"
After the 4 for 1 split someone said there are so many shares for sale that it will take a long timefor the shares to be bought keeping the stock from going straight up. Is that true????
"just hold on it, don't believe on short-term, play long term and gain much more up for me 27% Keep it till end % it will double your money soon. long term,"
"$AMC just blew up... Margin calls all week, 40% short...going to go up like a $DRY rocket"
Appl is the only red one in my portfolio today 
Back up the truck and load up the shares. Apple is happy to buy back their own shares. A year from now prices will be higher. Shareholder since 2011. Trust the process. Apple is printing money every seconds .
AAPL will cross $140 by Friday and will settle close to $145
"Dkng up $12. in 3 days why did I sell out to add to AAPL last week. :( Yeah I'm trading !!!Since I bought in 2000 shares Sept 1st 2020. I have been down ALL but 5 or 6 days. Apple event and then earnings. It's not that AAPL is bad, it's the oppurtunity cost holding it. Dividend is tiny."
"Long term investors are better served by transferring or splitting investments here and $NOK, 5G and 6G are the future and apple has made alot of people angry about corporate dictating. Smart money is moving to groth and that is coming to $NOK"
Park your money here and in 30 years you'll be all set...great
Mistakes I've made: Married young. Peeing on electric fence. Selling Apple.
Took some of profits from plug and fcel to roll them into aapl. My safe harbor.
Look at last six months chart.AAPL behaves like thisSep 01: $134.18Sep 23: $107.12DEc 29: $134.89Jan 05: $126.35Jan 25: $145.17
The way this market is...AAPL will be $300 by mid Feb....you know stimulus checks went to IPhones LOL
And Apple the Oinker stock goes back to sleep while the rest of the market is green again today. What a dead beat stock!
"will end at 139.99 tomorrow so everyone above 140 strikes will have their options exercised worthless...this is a perfect example of the rationale behind the GME AMC NOK frenzy...i am long AAPL stock and play with the options for a quick buck here and there so no real impact for me but, this is big manipulation nonetheless."
Something is really wrong with this stock
"Article on Yahoo Finance front page: Stocks rise, tech shares leap after earnings.Apparently the person who wrote this haven't been following Apple stock!"
"Just remember that if Apple Car captures just 2% of the car market, that will be equal to its entire iphone sales. And we all know that Apple isn't going after a measly 2%. They're going all in."
Huge announcement tomorrow...but now or be sorry...Apple about to blow!!!
AAPL stock going up slowly this week so far because the big guys were trying to out bideach other for the bonds.
170 by summer
"This should of went up at least $20 . I use there phone and there products are the best quality . They crushed earnings , what's going on here ."
"Apple executive management was acting against company and investor interests when they allowed their political bias to affect their decision regarding removing Parler from the Apple iPhone Apps. If the stock price drops as a result, there will be a flood of lawsuits by investors who see their investments lose value."
Your not going to make a fast buck trading Apple. This is for long term holders that are patient.
Ever ore raises PT to 160
how much higher will this thing go? I just bought today so im hoping it doesnt crash lol
$170 folks!!
Thanks for following my posts on Apple. Now the stock has come down to minor support near 126. If the stock price holds here we are fine and it will again test the highs. Now on the other hand if we break this support area standby until the stock stabilizes before pulling the trigger...
2 substantial share price increases and zero response.If it was TSLA it would be up 10-15 %
Was there a reason why everything tumbled from 10:30 to 11:10??
I wont buy in to a company who supports radical ideas..
Survey of Apple suppliers showed record number of orders for parts. Not worried.
Look at that jump before 8pm
"I need help from the gods above... I made a big mistake, and the life insurance is the only thing I can offer my family. I'm preying for help... God , be there in the morning for me, I know I made a mistake... Please help me with this"

Shorts....
I still don’t see anything why the markets are plunging.
"Designed in California, assembled in the USA, the Apple Car has the potential to become as popular as the iPhone is. So it's not a bad idea to add more shares at ground level here before the project ramps up quickly. JMHO"

"This is when you buy great companies...not when it's up 5%, but down 5%"

"The Tim Cook army is coming for Tesla. Tesla has only a limited time to try to fit into that oversized bubble of a market cap it current has. Because when Apple comes out, it's going to come out swinging. Look what happened when the iPhone first came out - BlackBerry pretty much lost massive business. The entire smartphone industry shifted. Thats what could happen. And it will not take decades for Apple to make a destructive entrance. By partnering with existing manufacturers it is relieved of having to construct massive foundries which cost billions. Partner to reduce costs and improve margins. The Apple way. The smart way."
you guys think APPL will beat on earnings tonight???
"$AAPL will have a strong earnings report, if the stock goes up & up before Wednesday , it could be a less chance to go up after earnings, same apply to $FB"
Why.?... why?... I can’t find any single reason that Apple goes down today. I’m sticking to that.
"pour one out for the options buyers, this ain't a casino boys."

Futures up to start the night. Need another big day tomorrow!
Its down about 80 cents (big surprise) today -9:30 ct but My belief is its going to beat expectations ( think it has last 3 or 4) . I believe its a good Bet(gamble) and just cashed in my checking act. (80%) to buy another 60 shares. There is No common sense in today market but these Hip stocks(Tesla too) keep on climbing beyond real value.. Buy half (might as well sit out-lol) or go with the steamroller of a stock. my advice(which is worthless) -Hang 10.. Ride the Wave.. Good Luck to All of Us. I will enjoy reading the replys( like this spelling better). Much success to All in 2021 > especially in early 2021.
All time high. Long since 2014. If you're long too pour yourself a drink this weekend. Thanks Apple.
It already gained the market cap of tesla after 10 years..I don’t think it’s going to gain anymore..this will be a bull trap tomorrow
This can see 160+ in no time. Managed to hold today which is a good sign going into ER.
more AAPL stock buy back starts today

It would take a coordinated buying effort to stop the inevitable suppression we will see the next two days..."
"Pre market at this early is not in any way a signal of a negative opening 9:00 AM Tomorrow. Low numbers of shares are traded at pre market. So relax and let the opening bell be your guide for early trading. As we all know the market is due for an upside, so stay positive."
Anyone know the time apple reports ? thanks
"I think Apple has a great strategy for EV, recall Tesla started off by buying GM/Toyota plant in Fremont CA. Apple partnering with Kia to manufacture EVs in Georgia or just building models there is a great strategy, by chosing Kia, Apple is guaranteed to lead in the technology required for the venture, at the time Apple will be dominant in Microprocessors, G5, Smartphones space ... thinks its a great move with lots of synergy to fend off ANY competition"
Apple stock is not trading.. Its for investing.. If you want to trade and short there are many better alternatives. This stock is for the long term investor.. Its climb is slow but steady and sure . Peace.
It starts tomorrow 4:00 PM. AAPL closes 140+ and no looking back. Forward and on ward.

DOW & S&P just went positive NASDAQ isn’t that far off of going positive hopefully we see a reversal of yesterday
Glad I didn’t bet on that. Before it’s earning. . Now it’s sell on news. Would have lost $10 g.
Performance of the company is weird. I have both Apple and Samsung phones and Samsung is much better.
"Funny how people are obsessed with iphone, but don't even realize that this is the year that apple takes over the high end windows desktop."
Net margins in the 20s% and operating margins in the 20s% for AAPL. While people tout Amazon that has consistently low margins of 5-6% respectively despite more and more revenue. Only AWS keeps it afloat and the fact that Amazon doesn’t really pay much in taxes. AWS growing less than MSFT Azure this past quarter. If Amazon had to pay more taxes then it’s net margins would shrink even more. If people really understood these numbers and see how much AAPL nets then it is a no brainer.

This is why you need to capitalize on 300 point Dow gains...because tomorrow it looks like a 300 point loss. I expect under $135 tomorrow. So annoyed about earnings action and the reason I can’t stand earnings days. Tech always gets trounced.
You rake in 111 bil in a qtr and the hedgies come after you. Whatever. Not selling a single share.
guys Robinhood traders leaving their platform affects AAPL price in a huge way. they own in the range of 400 billion worth.
"Too many young investors and/or traders on this board. Apple may not rise 50% in one month, but it will deliver fantastic returns in the long run. Look at the 5 year chart and tell me what it is you don't understand. Who cares about daily moves. The long term picture is what matters most. Own it don't trade it. Apple long!"
"AAPL: Apple: A Path To Doubling Its Revenue, Dividend Increases And Buybacks Could Make The 2020s Feel Like The 2010s"

"Good news is AAPL is only a few dollars away from $126.I guess everyone and everything misses ""home"".This year is almost replicating last year's action last Jan.The good news i whenever people start selling high premium puts the ""pivot"" s very near."
this will hit $150. within the month
Getting better- futures
Non event. Things will calm down. Meanwhile Dow is soaring and Tesla is soaring.
"The rise of Gamestop and AMC Entertainment shows what type of a market we're dealing with. If that stuff isn't gambling then I don't know what is. Those stocks are basically junk and no one should be buying them but they're making some people very rich, at least on paper. That's not investing and those stocks will probably drop rather quickly when whatever game is being played ends. Playing the market like a casino is quite foolish and it's rather dangerous if they're buying on margin. I'll just play it safe with Apple even if it takes longer to make gains."
"All the people that bought an ipad, iphone, etc last quarter...will not be buying again this year. Dirps."

"All time high close today......,,Bullish"

"apple will make its move once all the noise subsides. It's not going to react on our terms, it will make its move on it's own terms as it has for years."

Just watch. This will be much higher tomorrow into close on Friday. They blew their numbers away on every aspect. Own it don’t trade it. This qtr validates this company will be the first 3 trillion valued co.

"Apple’s Q2 even bigger than the quarter they just reported? Yes. 1. Q1 only had 2 months of 12 phone sales. 2. Chinese New Year. 3. 90% of all Holiday Gift Cards sold in Q1 will be redeemed in Q2. Gift cards are not counted as sales until they are redeemed. You heard it from me, Tony Balooga first. Q2 will be Apple’s biggest quarter ever."

Uncle mumbles is talking right now OMG even the sub titles are having a hard time. I think we missed a dose.
Hope shorts are out today and get squeezed big time here tomorrow. run to 300 possible
"Apple strategically announced the car launch through a CNBC ""rumour,"" Next few weeks will bring the full release."
Been through two bear markets and they start when companies report great earnings but they sell off anyway. Hope this isn't the case.
Would you say this a time to buy AAPL stocks while it’s in the 140 range ? Or will there be a decrease in prices soon ? ....
Autonomous should lower insurance. Also increase productivity as people can work from car. Also look at arrival that can easily update designs in micro factory without complete overhaul of mega assembly lines.
Have a nice week.
"I'm not often a bag holder but when I am, I'm holding AAPL!!! Looks like I'm going to be holding 1000 shares for a quarter or two. Oh well!"
"Jesus , again friday 3% drops equals 90 billion dollars....This is not including the rest of fang stocks that also sold off.Gamestop total market cap 22billion....No the big tech sell off had nothing to do with gamestop squuezeIt is mathematically not possible."
Time for the breakout! Market has been waiting for Washington to settle. Big run now!
such an exciting stock to watch
People really need to get a grip and stop looking at Apple day to day or month to month and bellyache.. Just buy it and keep adding when you can. It’s a core investment that you shouldn’t swing trade. It’s always made you money (if you’re smart) and will continue to do so. Just buy and hold. Come back when you’re ready to retire.
"This is the first time I bought 75% of my portfolio on a single stock, Apple. I had been told to diversify, but this seemed to be a no brainer. I had lost a lot of money buying Apple expensive and selling cheep, and this was supposed to be the perfect opportunity to balance the books. Am I going to the extreme by not being more conservative?"
Shorts getting B- slapped by Katy Huberty and Gene Munster's price target $200 AAPL! Good Luck
This is about the same timeframe the breakout occurred after the 2014 stock split...history repeating
"With Big Tech Companies Earning Reports coming this week, shorts took the profit and moved there but less they know that $BNGO $NNDM are consolidating and will soar  soon.Also there’s a lot of hype around $GME $AMC which ain’t good for people who tryna enter today or tomorrow. All the Millionaires and Billionaires gonna take up profits soon and will leave them all Better y’all stay in a reliable stock like NNDM BNGO cz they be the next $50 and then $100 soon Don’t forget that $NNDM $BNGO is among top CATHIE WOOD listing for the year 2021 along $TSLA $WKHS $BLNK $NIO $AAPL etc"
Tomorrow is looking 
Aapl should re-release its earnings
Short's trying hard to keep this under $140! They are going to get burned. Big money coming in and they won't be able to cover! What a great buying opportunity! All Apple people should be loading up again.
"And tesla who doesn’t have a blowout quarter and is based on wind farts and blueberries is up 10% since Friday. Market makes no sense, kids."
I predict business in China will be replaced by business in India which is a democratic country with a hungry workforce equally as big as China's. 1.5 million phones were sold there last quarter. With 1.4 billion people and an up and coming middle class I can see 100 million phones sold there. That alone would add a ton of value to Apple.
Apple crushed it. No worries. Happy days ahead.
"Why are people bugging out, this is an investment stock not a trading."
"When a stock goes from $108 to $142 in 2 months, u can’t be surprised when it sells off a little. That was a huge run up. Don’t worry"
Even if AAPL is down .80 today still for the week we are up 6.00. So on 1.000 shares you are up 6K. Stop complaining just hold long and average out a hefty profit. APPLE will NOT disappoint.
Dow up 487!!!! Wow we get barely a fragile dollar up? Come on. Why did I load up into earnings?I thought finally this will act like others stocks and go UP! My cash in AAPL prison again :(
This better find green tomorrow. I don’t care what the options do or the markets.
They just beat by 8 billion in revenue! That's more revenue the GME made all of last year LOL.
"I don't know what's happening, but from 140 I keep adding 20 stocks for every dollar down.I'll keep doing this, so I don't care if I see 120. AAPL rewards the patient ones."
"You gotta love all the Apple cultists on this forum. You say even one tiny bad comment about their company and they give you a bunch of thumbs down (like I care). I own 5000 shares, have been long on this stock since 2006 and even I can see that the stock is turning into a LAGGARD. I've already begun looking for other stocks to divest into and start selling off my Apple shares. Good riddance to this Oinker!"
"Apple sold 18M iPhone 12 units in the China market in Q4, exceeding expectations and achieving over 20% market share, DigiTimes reports.The impressive Q4 sales dented the market share numbers for Huawei, Kiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo, which accounted for more than 90% of China's smartphone market before the iPhone series launch. In Q4, their combined share fell to ~78%, according to the DigiTimes report.Momentum is seen continuing through the Lunar New Year holiday, bringing Q1 2021 volumes level with Q4 2022 shipments, MacRumors reports."
"Apple has reached its all-time high and that's before earnings report Wednesday when it should explode, as I said one month ago get in at 120 now you better get in at 139 because it's going to 150 and upwards shortly, I've been in this stock 12 years so I'm pretty familiar with the cycles and then this cycle says going up !"
Must have major cahones to short an apple stock.
They can’t hold it down much longer! What company would give their left nut for Apples numbers? We should be up $10 with the Nasdaq up 200 plus
￼￼when will apple issue the dividend???? Any body
Can’t imagine what wall street would have done here on a day like today with a miss.
RSI has Apple stock as oversold ! We should have a rally soon !

Breakout coming
Finally!!! Tomorrow will be good!!! GLTA!!
"Anybody crying apple is dead right now, you do realise the entire market is an absolute bloodbath right now right? And that we are still green in said bloodbath"
apple was robbed by the market makers. we should of been up 10% after earnings.
If this is an indication how WS is behaving prior to earnings; just wait and see how they’ll react when Apple announces the iCar!
"Apple's initial vehicle chassis will be based on Hyundai's E-GMP electriv vehicle (BEV) platform, which uses up to two motors, five-link rear suspension, an integrated drive axle, battery cells that can provide range over 311 miles on a full charge, and can be charged up to 80% within 18 minutes through high-speed charging. A high performance model based on E-GMP is capable of accelerating from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 160 miles per hour."
This is $200 in NO TIME ! 
"I am a huge Apple fan. Macs, iMacs, iPhones for the past 13 years. Obviously I get free Apple TV+ content because I buy a new laptop & iPhone almost every year. There is little to like on AppleTV+ because Apple management is more concerned on social statements than entertainment. They will NEVER be anything like HBO+ or Netflix. Apple TV+ will always be an expense and not an income item on Apple's quarterly statement."
"I love how everyone comes out to run their mouths when this has a morning dip, and then it gets quiet real fast..."
"interesting Bullish perspective::""Apple's Stock May Soar In The Weeks Following Quarterly Results""Jan. 25, 2021 12:50 PM ET"" ""Apple will report fiscal first quarter results on Jan. 27. The company expected to see strong iPhone revenue growth. Options traders are betting the stock soars above $160 by the middle of April. Looking for more investing ideas like this one? Get them exclusively at Reading The Markets. Get started today »""Apple (AAPL) will report results on January 27 after the close of trading. Analysts are looking for fiscal first quarter 2021 earnings to climb by 13.2% to $1.41 per share, while revenue jumped by 12.5% to $103.2 billion. The strong growth is expected to be driven by a huge jump in iPhone sales.

But what may be even more important is second quarter guidance. The company has been hesitant to provide forward guidance over the past few quarters. Guidance would certainly give investors the confidence that perhaps management is gaining some better visibility. Signaling that perhaps the worst of the pandemic's economic crisis is behind the company. Analysts are looking for fiscal second quarter revenue of $74.5 billion and earnings of $0.91 per share.""

This is going way over 140 tomorrow

Remember AAPL traded at the same price in 1980 as in 1998. We're long overdue for another quiet period.

Biggest earnings and revenue in history. Going to the sky.
"We probably will see a move up this week, 3-4% everyone who had options going into earnings got sufficiently screwed. It’s ok if it run a little bit now. Plus $130 looked like pretty strong support for now. With earnings like they just had this should have already bounced. It’s always the same story, premiums for thru the roof into every earnings, price comes up a few percent mid after earnings you’re usually at the same price You were when the week started. Same thing w MSFT, up 10% AH and ended up what down next day or up very marginally. Gl all"

Facebook made too much money. We should sell and go buy GME that lost $600 million last quarter. Gotta love the stock market 
"7% yield? Yes pls. I like how T took off when growth stocks collapsed yesterday......I believe in T’s cash generating potential (HBO, 5G) but also think it is a great natural hedge to the likely tech turbulence ahead (although I remain an $aapl and $qqq long......just part of a balanced diet and portfolio! I also like Michael Craft store as a short squeeze with 30% market cap short despite management reporting huge gains on top and bottom line....."
Wfc just upgraded o175!
Blown up hedge funds selling winners like Apple to raise cash. After desperation selling is over Apple will rise.
"Stocks don’t go up in a linear fashion. They go up over time. It’s a small drop with institutional profit taking after a killer quarter. According to Jim Cramer, you don’t trade Apple stock, you own Apple stock, if you wanna day trade, go buy GME."
All good. Up tomorrow. If for whatever reason it is not then buy the dip.
"This does not make any sense, apple beat the revenue expectations in almost all sectors, yet the stock is falling ?"
GME down 50% today. Still 90% overvalued. You’d have to be crazy to buy it now

More p/e appreciation coming. Look at Tesla's p/e.
"Lately, the only “innovation” I have seen from $AAPL is figuring out new ways of upping the stock price. According to CNBC “sources”, Apple did a puny $3 billion deal with Kia. This appears to be a poor attempt to boost the stock price and hope for an EV valuation. Investors see through this. When’s the car gonna launch? What kind of revenues are going to Apple? Lol, this is such a joke."
NOT A SINGLE PENNY FROM STIMULUS PACKAGE GO TO TEXAS AND FLORIDA.THESE TWO STATES DON'T DESERVE IT TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY.
Are we close to the low point for Apple or will this continue for a few more trading days? Looking to buy some more shares.

When does Apple pay out there dividend this quarter?
"Twas the night before Christmas, and all through Apple Park All the shutters were drawn and the offices dark. The lunchroom was empty, the desks were all clean All were working from home due to COVID-19.With A Charlie Brown Christmas already streamed Things weren’t as bad as at times they had seemed. They sheltered in place and polished their gear And were left to remember a remarkable year.January seemed fine, before everything went mad Marking a decade since the very first iPad. February was slow, and oh-so-serene Then March roared in and brought quarantine.Everyone felt miserable, with a shared sense of gloom (Unless you were a VC who had invested in Zoom.) To cheer us all up, Apple decided to show iPhone SE, Magic Keyboard and the new iPad Pro.But there was a slight hitch if you felt desirous; Apple Stores were shut down on account of the virus. April and May left us all feeling uneasy But June brought a virtual WWDC.Without a live crowd, it seemed strange I must say It looked like a keynote filmed by Michael Bay. It brought us great news, stopped us dead in our tracks Not a COVID vaccine, but Apple Silicon Macs.New services, too, were on Tim Cook’s big wish list An Apple One bundle and new Apple Fitness. A bit of a shuffle made some of us bellow Phil Schiller, it seemed, was a new Apple Fellow.As fall rolled around, new gear came in stacks Three keynotes in three months and then AirPods Max. Forget about partridges living in pear trees We got software galore and iPhones with 5G."
"It’s a beat top and bottom. +15 points tomorrow and trapped shorts. Moon, 177.00."
Apple is the king. When Apple wants privacy they get privacy 
Bought 50 share of Apple first time I just have to be a part of a Trillion Dollar company

"If EV Apple car is not rumor and real thing, than can it reach $5,000 per share? This a big thing they are not only going to make cars only but all the technology and hardware component, batteries and all can also be retailed of sold to other EV. imo"
Markets are not convinced!The Jan 29 $130 call sells for $13.95 yet the $135 call sells for $9.99...Subtract the $135 premium from the $130 premium you only get $4 on a $5 spread.If this was a slam dunk this spread would not be 20%
"Sold all of my AAPL and bought GME and AMC.Essentially fundamentals and technical analysis mean nothing now. And zombie companies like GameStop, AMC can be propped up by rouge investment groups with little of no value. Hedge funds who are covering need to sell their winners like Apple Inc. So, until this trend changes–I'm placing my bets on today's action."
Relax this happens every single quarter don’t worry about it.... wait till wait till earnings are reported
Let’s start buying Apple like GME!!!

"2020 has been a banner year for AAPL. 83% upside returns. And to those who had the foresight to hold congratulations. One of my principal beliefs is: Measure your greed, with that in mind for 2021 I will be very happy with a 50% return. HOLD."
A loud BOOM will reverberate around the world at 4:30.
I think the problem is that the market fears a big pull back in Feb. If happens will take all stocks down 10%_20% even good ones like Apple
The entire float is shorted. I think AAPL will increase the divy with good ER and we will see a short squeeze moving the SP closer to $150 by March
"$135 calls were .15 on Tuesday, the high today was $1.80."
This stock makes no sense at all.
"7% down on release of one of the best quarters in the history of Wall St.Time for more upgrades, 200- 500- 1000- 5000?It's all pie-in-the-sky #$%$"

"The Dow went from 20K to 30K during the last 4 years. At that growth rate, in 4 years (Jan. 2025) we should see Dow 45K or better. And AAPL at $560 or better. Right?"
"$147 coming very soon 1000 shares since $75 split adjusted....this is a retirement stock my friends, buy accumulate and hold until 60’s"
"If bitcoin which comes out of nothing can be above 30K USD now, it’s certain that AAPL is hitting 150 in January!"
"Added more Apply to my portfolio this morning on the dip. Made me over a million $$$ in the past 10 years, let's see if I can double that!!"
Calls or Puts? Vertical spreads? Entry exit to play ER? I’m think 140/150 bull call! 1000 contracts!
Today’s volume is running 25% above the 50-day average for this point in the trading session. Stock movements on high-volume days are an indicator of future movement — far better than trying to discern a trend from low-volume days.
"Wow! Never expected over a $1.00 down today, espcially with the Dow up."
this is normal price action for apple holders. newbies are being taught a lesson. apple is the most widely held stock and is manipulated in both directions. it always gives you an entry point on sell offs like this. typically 10-20% discounts just buy it on every dip and hold it. in a bad market correction of 10-15 % apple will drop 30% just the way it is. buy the dips and never sell it unless you are a trader.
OPINION ---- Options: Sept. 2022 strike 130 and 140 --- Hold until after earnings? or sell prior?
I think Netflix set the tone of the market for at least one year if not years to come. Excellent results from Netflix. And there is a vast expansion of the application and use of technology including and specially the semiconductor sector of which we cannot even dream of let alone think. Cars are now not only mechanical but also electronic. Since I am ancient and old I never thought I will see this age of technology. My advise stay fully invested forever and watch your investments grow through leap and bounds.
"So what next week, guys? $140?"
"This is a waste of time, Tim Cook needs to focus on the stock not MArk at Facebook. Jesus, we need the stock to thrive not tank on stellar earnings."
After earnings this is 175
Remember july earning +40$
When the IMac with the M1 chip comes out im going to buy a 27 inch. Excited for that.
Just thrown down $15grand on Apple ! This company has a massive future !
"Almost up a dollar premarket. After Netflix earnings, people are excited about Apple's earnings next week. Short squeeze today and about to take off!!"
Absolute blowout....1.67 eps is just unbelievable....there are really no words...Tim Cook is awesome!
"I'm no expert so I defer to those who are: since I heard President Biden promise to raise taxes if elected, what do you think the capital gains tax will be in 2021?"
Is the Kia news official? This news came out after closing? Would like to hear from Apple.
I’m not complaining because apple is my 3rd biggest holding but you know the market is euphoric when amazing earnings moves the stock lower and a car coming out in 2023 pushing the stock 3% higher
$137. And we still have 3 full trading days till earnings
"My realistic outlook on Apple heading into earnings week. I think it will go up, but not as high as some claim. Yes this is the first earnings report since iPhone launch, as well as the launch of the new iMacs, watches, iPads and all the accessories for those products. Now a big part of revenue that plays a factor here is the stores, which have not been open for quite some time. They’ve simply relied on their own website. Partnered companies such as bestbuy and the cellular companies. I don’t think $175-$200 per share will happen, I expect similar progress as Netflix, a 16% increase which puts at $150-ish especially when taking in these factors. $100 billion report come Wednesday is no impossible but I think it’s a overreaction. I think it will be close though!"
can we see 139-140 today?
If the stocks reacts this bad on the best report in it's history then there isn't much hope for the future of AAPL. The market is totally irrational and it will end badly for the gamers.
"Average in a little at a time at these AAPL sale prices, that is what I am doing."
"Let's see, incredible quarterly report, stock price drops 4%, will open lower tomorrow. My opinion, some manipulation at play. No rational reason a stock should drop that much after a great report, even in a down market; unless the fundamentals no longer mean anything."
"Wake up people! Hyundai is not that cheap plastic car that first came out 20 years ago. They are great cars. You want higher quality? Hyundai has had it’s own separate luxury brand Genesis for years now....the same way Toyota has Lexus, Honda has Acura and Nissan has Infinity. My friend has a Genesis and it’s really nice....just as nice as the other Asian luxury brands I’ve listed. The Genesis G70 was named the 2019 Motor Trend Car of the Year. Google it. My point is that they already have the ability to make very nice high end quality vehicles. Genesis just came out with a new SUV the GV80....very nice. Google it. Now consider the fact that Apple just posted a $100 billion revenue in one quarter and has a market cap of 2.25 Trillion. Think of the quality of an iPhone or iPad or iMac....top notch. Now put all those things together and just marinate on it."
"Earnings update in 10 days, then pop goes the sharp rice and guidance for the rest of the year. Very excited. This was my third spit and things are getting much more serious as a percentage of holdings."

"FYI-Until the ""Up Tick"" rule is reinstated from the 2010 adjustment, ""we-us"" the little retail investor are at a extreme disadvantage to the big institutional investors, ie; Hedge-funds-ETF's-Shorts.

"Buy 132, sell at 135Casino Management."
"All the amateurs here who sold at $126 , how are you feeling ?, THAT WAS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY KIDS "
I really think people finally understand that the stock market is not a free market. Its controlled by big guys. People don't want to pour money in that kind of markets. I think a crash from the markets is imminent.
"Back under 120 is a certainty now, even with record numbers.People are clearing the decks. Too risky."
"Hardware/Services with new products being added regularly.Stock is flat lined, very strange"
AAPL er is good...we can see gains tomorrow and going into next week
"Anyone selling this stock will miss out on a triple bagger by the end of 2024 when Apple starts their car production. If you are selling Apple, where are you placing your bets? There is something nice about having the best company in the world with over $200 billion in cash as your top investment."
"just put in 1.5k in apple, its gonna go up boys"
Is anybody paying any attention to the Apple + Kia partnership? 100000 in 2024 joining the Apple eco system is massive ! Can we see it reflected in the stock price please 
The market spoke today. Apple will rule the waves as we sail into 2021 and beyond.
"When you go long with Apple stock, you go LONG! I've held my Apple shares since 2006 and have been through 2 stock splits with Apple. I've held Apple through thick & thin and have not sold a single share. Patience truly is a virtue!"
reddit in apple??? why no???? come on
"Why did Apple split 4 for 1 putting so many shares out there. How long will it take for theseshares to be bought, someone said there are many billion shares for sale, keeping the pricedown after great earnings. What is the truth, if that still exist."
Ex dividend is on Friday 5th Feb 
"I picked up 180 shares in 2/2012. It’s now split into 5,040 shares"
if Appl isn't making stock holders $$ on days like this you know the big buyers are not buying. That should tell you something.
+6% today
"Some of you are acting like there was no election in November. Remember, Apple‘s taxes are going up, way up. The tax rate on dividends is about to double. These are strong headwind‘s for Apple. Keep in mind, the powers in government today are hostile to industry, and they do not care what the stock market does."
4% up on London at open
"If you woulda taken a fraction of your Apple money and placed it on GameStop, you woulda made a million in a couple months...."
Tony Balooga trimmed the shade tree today. And began loading the boat with LOTZ for 2021. It’s a newly trading car reselling company.. could be another Lithia Motors.
"I agree with Kevin, in regard to pre market numbers. Unless there is a major crises pre market in its low trade numbers is almost irrelevant. Apple daily volume is over 100 million and pre market at most is 1-2% of that volume. I find it almost inconceivable for AAPL not to gain today, it just doesn’t make any sense. Earnings yesterday is the envy of any and all major world conglomerates. With that in mind I am on record that AAPL will gain today."
“Own Apple don’t trade it!” Thanks Cramer for your totally opposite wrong advice.
It is about ready to bust 145 wide open... Pay a particular attention to the last hour of AH.
if i was long tesla id be very worried
LOT OF OIL COMPANY NEXT YEAR WILL NOT EXIST ANYMORE
Just like previously this one is also only focusing on how to steal money in the name o stock market. That is the only thing they care.
I have a strong position in apple. Getting tired of watching everyone make money while apple goes down.
Im glad Tim Cook didn’t give guidance last call. Keeps everyone guessing.
Wow! It’s going up PRE- Market ! Buy Buy! Move your money here!
180 by the end of week?
Did anyone see the kia news on major broadcast? It's still only a rumor and no one is putting it out as fact?
It's pretty obvious big firms are buying up shares the past few days like crazy...they know this is a blowout quarter for revenue and earnings...upgrades already coming even before earnings....they aren't buying now unless the plan is to push this past 160 after ER....hope you are in before the ER...follow the money always
Is this a scam? Market looks strong but individual stocks are too much down. How come
We moving up people 1cent  
Announcement on Kia is rumored to be released on February 17. Time will quickly tell.
I'm not a technical guy. I have learned a bit about financials from reading the intelligent investor. all I know is I couldn't buy an iphone 12 at best buy and the sales staff told me to try my luck in 2 weeks because they come in and then they are gone.
People are buying your shares at a 4% discount how nice of you.
"Today before earnings $145. After earnings $150, 2021 years end $200. Not Tesla but slow and steady with dips along the way. But future big earnings expansion with addition of smart glasses and much later Apple Car. The saga will continue! Stay long!"
Moral of the story next earnings report sell the day before then come back
Dan Riccio is in charge of a secret new Apple project...I wonder what it is?...
Shorts posting now after they covered and lost money! Haaaaaa
I expect AAPL to rise into 2021 & beyond... AAPL is the safest investment for RETIREMENT...
"Ad David said. let's accumulate on AAPL at 0.40 cents . AAPL is poised to break 270 today based on his machine learning. I am buying before hours at 0.40 cents discount. I won't sell AAPL at all. 200 a share will come in Feb based on leaks he heard. Apple new car, new phones, new news will surprised today. Also, I am buying CRM, MCD at the opening."
This is all too familiar guys. This is Tim Cook’s iPhone moment. Look at the cell phone market when iPhone came into the scene. Look how it changed the way we use our phone today. Imagine what Apple can do in the car world. I wouldn’t bet against a 2 trillion behemoth with a vision on this. Apple will turn cars into something we have yet to see. Tesla should be very worried. And for those that is worried about other(Tesla) getting a head start. Apple has over a billion IOS users. Let that sink in for a moment.
"I'm not selling, I am buying"
"FOR SALE: I'm selling my white privilege card. It's over 70 years old but is in mint condition. It has never been used, not even one time. Reason for selling is that it hasn't done a damn thing for me! No free college, no free food, no free housing, no free anything, I actually had to go to work every day of my life while paying a boatload of taxes to carry those who chose not to work! If you are interested, I prefer cash but would be willing to do an even trade for a Race Card which seems much more widely accepted and comes with countless benefits if you fit the profile! Interested? Contact me on my Non-Obama cell phone that I pay for every month…"
Bought 1000 at $127. Holding for a few years
Finally muted anonymous...much better
I don't see how Facebook can have a case. Apple is asking the users if they want to share there data... I am glad Apple give us the option.
"this is recycled news from 2 weeks ago. also, it is not a done deal either. I can't believe we are rallying."
A couple of analyst think AAPL will take a little hit do to the amount investment this going to require and less chance of special dividend . If we get back to $115 I am adding .
"Le me share a theory with you. Megacap stocks, including AAPL, will tank in the coming days (short-term) because big funds who have been playing the shorting game will be forced to raise cash to cover their bets. And they will probably start by selling some of their 2020 winners. I would not be surprised if that impact is so strong that we go below the 50 day EMA and could even touch the 200 day. So nothing to do with the stock's intrinsic value or future prospects, but rather the rather futile short-term liquidity needs of hedge funds.Let me hear your thinking on this."
AAPL will be the first 10 trillion dollar company by 2023 or 2024
Why stop at a $100 Billion quarter y’all? Why not $200 Billion in 5 years or less?
Hope you guys/gals are listening! DO NOT SELL PRE-MARKET. You’ll regret it. 1 Million shares traded so far Pre-Market. A gift to the institutions grabbing them from you. Why would you give your shares away like this?
So our post earnings shorts are back huh?...here comes the squeeze again
$25 by March
"Talk is for a completely autonomous ev. Great, though I hope they give you the option to drive! To some it is still a pleasure"
"For one thing, Apple made it political by banning Parlor"
Couple of highlights I took from the call. Luca (CFO) wouldn’t give any guidance BUT he said that March is always the best month for Apple Services. Which also their highest margins. So that bodes well. Also Tim wouldn’t call it by name but it was obviously what he was talking about when he said they are going forward with some very exciting new product. Can you say Apple Car. Any news coming out or Cupertino in the next month or two about Apple Car will have the stock soaring. Cook just needs to utter the word car and the stock will take off. Hehe 
These are dream scenarios that happen occasionally and you have to take advantage. A blockbuster ER and the stock sells off. I have been in Apple a very long time and every time this scenario plays out it turned out to be a massive buying opportunity. Me thinks that’s what we are looking at here compadres. 
Undue optimism walks hand in hand with the bad investor.
"Shorts are starting to panic and their posts are getting more desperate. I thought this stock was going to take a bit of a dip before going up, but it looks like it might explode today."
"Guys, next week green or red?"
"Wow, I remember thinking of selling multiple times, especially from 12-16 when Apple was really dead money, and just last March during the Covid drop. Fortunately I didn't either time and it's been a life changer. Scary thing is the future seems bright for Apple with the new projects they are rumored to be involved with. Good luck to all."
"Monday will be the start or the trek back to $145, it was imminent that we would have a sell off after earnings and the GME drama didn’t help. I see us returning to some normalcy next week, hope you bought the dip!!!"
On January 12th I thought to myself finally this stock is behaving as it should based on the hype. And it spiked up 15 points over 10 days. Very healthy. It has also back filled any gaps up. We are right at another resistance point. This needs to get above $138. SOON to break thru. MSFT spiked after earnings fell back (never went red) but is now 11 points higher and 6 points off earnings spike! It's not whining to complain about to recent performance of APPL.
"I lost $13k today in apple, but I have the faith in apple. if we all hold on and don't panic it will go up and double this year even Tesla got the wrath of kraken today."
"It is mind boggling - AAPL is down and the WS darling TSLA is up! With all the anticipation of AAPL's earnings. I own both but more of AAPL. I've been reading and watching as well the last few days financial reports regarding this week's earnings, and it seems most analysts have lost touch about P/E and fundamentals. Especially when it comes to TSLA. They keep talking about how exciting to see first time young investors coming into the market and so forth. It appears, they have accepted the unreal bubble that it commands."
AAPL bonds were competing against AAPL stock now that the bonds are sold with high demand the stock will gain back its up momentum.
Typical Apple long waiting for his return...
I sold all my apple stocks and I bought Nokia aswell.
wait i am confused were suppose to buy this instead of GME or AMC ? isn't this detached from any real fundamentals on its price?
Muhahaha! It’s creeping up shorts!
Once we have a signed deal with an auto manufacturer to produce the apple car stock will double overnight
"Speculation is that markets dropped today because many hedge funds got destroyed with unexpected losses and needed to raise cash quickly, hence selling of long positions"
Will this quarter be the best report in aapl history?
"When you see a lot of shorts posting here, there is a good reason for it."
"At its Q4 2020 call, Apple confirmed $64.7 billion in revenue, a record September quarter: Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2020 fourth quarter ended September 26, 2020. The Company posted record September quarter revenue of $64.7 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $0.73.2 days ago￼iMore › apple-could-announce-...Apple could announce first-ever $100B quarter at January ... - iMore"
Buy now or wait after earnings?
The whole market is down folks. Relax. I see a late afternoon rally tomorrow after a slow start
my price target is $200 when it hits 3 trillion. i can wait.
"All is good, buy on the dip if it helps your cost basis. Otherwise,relax."
I’m thinking this will run sideways up until 3:30 then rocket up into earnings.
What a consolidation that morning trade was!
Awesome beat for Apple! I just bought some. $150 plus pretty soon I believe. Good luck all!
"People, the word is that we will have a market correction this month so stay vigilant! This might affect Apple but always remember you are investing in it and not day trading it. Long always!"
Possible GM partnership for Apple
"""Tomorrow"", ""next week"", ""next month"", ""after they report"", as soon as......"
Who thinks Apple will hit 150 within the next week and a half
WOW!! Blow out numbers!!
THEY’RE TRYING SO HARD BUT AAPL WILL BE +5% TMRW! HOLD!Copy and paste this comment so everyone knows the truth.
"The Zone in Golf is not what people think it is ?It’s your Doorway back to God !You experience heightened focus and what could be perceived as Supernatural Ability but there’s a very good reason for that !Your getting closer to Gods Doorway and your messing around with Powers that you can’t possibly comprehend ?Fortunately there are safe guards in place to keep you from stepping through before you die but it is possible that with enough persistent visualization on the golf course, that you will open that Doorway and experience the second level of The Zone ?I’m really not sure how many different levels there are but I experienced all of them, until one day a Beautiful Turquoise Blue Spirit appeared walking next to me on the golf course and when our eyes met, what I saw defies belief ?It was my face inside all that blue energy ?Then in an instant I was 15 ft off the ground looking down on my body with a telescope like view !The Eye isn’t Gods Sight ?It’s your Spirits Sight !I tried in vein to get my body to obey my thoughts but nothing I tried was working !Wonderment quickly faded away and turned into frustration and then anger !Without warning, I blew my top in anger and that’s exactly when God appeared !I felt a Supernatural amount of Nurturing Love!God was everywhere and all around me !It felt like I was being covered with a blanket of Nurturing Love  and I calmed right back down, just like an infant ?I immediately thought to myself, Are You A Woman?In a Woman’s voice, I heard,Why Are You So Surprised?Don’t Women Give Life ?For the record I was stunned speechless !I paused for a moment, not sure if I would ever be able to speak again and then God made me speak!I started blurting out one question after another at a speed that likely can’t be measured and God was responding, Telepathically, so quickly that I often understood the answer before I asked the question !I asked what was next and saw the silhouette of a pregnant woman with a glowing fetus inside !It was the most amazing display of Telepathy that you could ever hope to witness !A Man’s voice chimed in and asked me a single question and when I answered, I saw a wall full of Data that I believed was Programming for my next Life ?The moment that I saw the Data in its entirety, it all disappeared as fast as it appeared and then I started to change inside and Reincarnation was beginning !In a last ditch effort, I yelled as loud as I could, they don’t think I’m Dead do they ?Everything stopped, like a faucet turning off and the Man’s Voice said, You Will Return Upon Death !As I was regaining control of my body, I could hear God whisper, You Won’t Be Believed !I met God as an Atheist and I believed in an instant!Meeting God is like Surprise on steroids !I have in no way prepared you for how surprised your going to be ?Buckle up !"
"Who was it said they were buying $155 calls based on a ""feeling""?"
the only stock that always makes me happy <3
"It's always ""next week"", ""next month"", ""after they report"", etc.In the mean time the stock does noting on stellar sales and future earnings.The stock is too big now to show any meaningful gains.People are not buying the narrative any longer.They want Musk, they want cash now, like Tom Vu"
positive day today folks. short covering folks big time today folks. do be happy folks. great results from apple folks so doubty about it. Babba know best. Market will turn greeny green today.
The best thing $AAPL did to investors is asking $TSM to fabricate the 5G chips for them. That is very cost effect move and smart one too since $TSM is the world leader in manufacturing chips with state of art technologies.
When can aapl start loading up again with buybacks ?
Days like this is what separates the men from boys
$111 bil revenue....wow
I bought a Nokia phone and it works fine.
"IBD ""AAPL is not a buy now, it has underperformed and is well below it's buy point""Ya Think ?"
"Unless you bought APPL 10 years ago, you shouldn't buy it for dividend. It's growth stock. Capital expenditures for EV, health, service infrastructure, etc."
"ALERT:Skyworks beat estimates big time due to AAPL. Tomorrow, for a change AAPl will buck the downtrend and closes over 140. They made 111 billions in a Quarter. this is not Gamestop or Facebook. Chines new year and opening economy will take AAPl with the supercycle to 170"
"We longs have all enjoyed the train ride, a new adventure is unfolding, stay long and enjoy the ride."
"I bought at 136.21 healthy pullback. yep 150 level will be broken. buy buy...I like MCD, and MCD...these 3 will command the correction. EPS /revenues were huge for AAPL, and still at this price? expect a huge SHORT SQUEEZE EVENTUALLY"
"Apple App Store revenue grew 31% in December, a third straight month with 30%+ growth. This brings the growth rate to 31% for the Dec-qtr, a notable improvement from the 25% growth in the Sept-qtr (worth noting street models call for services growth of 19% in Dec-qtr vs. 16% reported in Sept-qtr). We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to ~$4.8bn in December; up 31% Y/Y (vs. +32% in November, +30% in October). Revenue grew 28% in 2020, an acceleration from the 21% growth rate in 2019…Net/Net: Continued growth in the 30% range could support upside to our 18% services growth estimate in the Dec-qtr, especially as Apple Care headwinds should moderate given the iPhone launch."
"anytime Apple is down, you buy. you know it will go up. market is just about money flow and which stocks are in the most ETFS. nothing to do with earnings or fundamentals."
So apples App Store had a 35% increase in Christmas Day. Wonder if that corresponds to a comparable increase in devices.
 buy it & hold it & enjoy the ride  next week it can reach 145 
"With Today's RBC Captital Upgrade and Apple reported ramping up production and earnings coming up, Apple a buy the dip.""Apple to ramp up iPhone production for 2021, plans to produce up to 230 million units""2 minute read Apple iPhones Author Maaz Ahmed""Apple has asked its iPhone suppliers to ramp-up production, as the American tech giant plans to manufacture up to 96 million iPhones for the first half of 2021, according to a report by Nikkei. If the target numbers are met, they would account for about 30% YoY increase."" Bullish. Good Luck"
I Don’t need to sell and don’t need the money! Holding 5-10 years. Can’t wait to see the splits and accumulation of shares.￼
"Shocker! Just now looked at the price and hoped it’d be up by more than a simple 1%, but wow, we’re down. So shocked. Has AApl been up by more than 1% a day this year? Getting annoying."
Don't sell your shares for a small gain. You will miss the big increase that's coming. Shorts will get squeezed out and the price will skyrocket!!

Apple should use hydrogen fuel cells in its cars. Batteries are not environmentally friendly.
building business and iphone sales in India....can't wait until these sales start to kick in next quarter..i look forward to next quarter projections on earnings release tomorrow!!!
app revenue is up 35% yoy for Apple. 35%!...combine this with every hardware product sold out with huge demand it’s going to be a blowout quarter.
let's play when will this become a green apple? i thought yesterday... now not sure about today? long long long fo so long... but still expect more after this history making earnings
Futures red :(
"Am I taking profits after earnings? No I am not. My shares are not for sale, thank you for your interest. Apple longs know to own it don't trade it. This is such a simple but poorly understood statement. Holding long is how you keep your cost basis down and this is how huge gains are made. In the case of Apple, holding long has been a blessing. And besides if you sell out you might miss the Project Titan reveal whenever that happens. So in short, own it don't trade it."
"It keeps dropping to the bottom of the Bollinger Band and pops back up. The trend is up from early trading today. It’s gonna close next to even, maybe a small gain. My guess is as good as yours"
Sign of things to come under sleepy Joe and their socialist agenda. Wait for 15 min wage and economy will really tank
"Hyundai confirms early stage talks with Apple on EV, FT reportsHyundai Motor (HYMTF) has confirmed early stage talks with Apple (AAPL) about building an electric vehicle, The Financial Times' Song Jung-a, Edward White and Patrick McGee report. ""Apple and Hyundai are in discussions, but as it is at an early stage, nothing has been decided,"" Hyundai told the publication, adding that Apple is speaking with ""a variety of global carmakers."" Reports swirled on Thursday that Apple plans to launch its electric vehicle in 2027 and is teaming up with Hyundai to develop the car and its own EV batteries."
this head fake happens so many times afterhours closes $145-$147 by eod tomorrow maybe $150 Friday
"Buy Apple, Hold Apple, Profit from Apple To all opponents of an apple short squeeze. There is an average short interest of just under 100million shares. Hedge funds hold the bulk of those positions! Apple have just reported record earnings and have a amazingly innovative pipeline of product! My point is those short positions are plainly without merit!"
if they disappoint even in the slightest this will drop to 130 easy or less then the entire market will go into a correction down 10%. apple will drop 30% in a correction down to 105-110 before it climbs back out. if they beat and give guidance which I doubt they will do it will be 148-150.
The sleepy one reminds me of the dictator from the Woody Allan movie Bananas.
The market is solid green and Apple the Oinker stock can't even manage to break even for the day. That's just SAD!
WHAT A PIECE OF S#4#$#T!!! This is unreal! $13. in 2 days. Blow out earnings who cares I want to make a profit to!! Money trap! I don't care if you've owned you shares for years. Breaking downward resistance!
$400 by December 2021. Please remember me when that happens. All pundits will be scrambling to take the credit. Give the credit to whom it is due
If you could own only one stock for the next 15 years would Apple? If not what stock would it be?
"Hi I am new here. I would like to get in and get little bit Apple stock in my portfolio. But to be honest, my ideal buying price is around 128$. Now is about 132$. Should I start a small amount today or better wait till Monday and see what’s going on ? Thanks!"
Tomorrow x dividend day
"siri, why is AAPL such a #$%$"
This is wall street showing their hands. Basically saying for those of you who tried to take us hedge funds down this is what happens. They used illegal means to do it and will continue to manipulate the stocks until the movement is broken. Then you will have the media reporting retail investors lost big as the stocks plummeted but wont mention stock manipulation and foul play was the cause. This is being done to discredit WSB around the world to deter people from rallying together on stocks. So disgusting!
another 3.6% in London at the moment
Smells like low of day at close....again.
Apple will be in the red today I can’t deal with this stock. Apple should be in the 160’s already. I can imagine what will happen when we have a couple red days
$138.80 is a buy point. Let’s see if it happens
Looks like we will be in the 145-147 range for ER tonight. And I fully expect ER will be blowout with some added extras and tomorrow AAPL opens 160+.
